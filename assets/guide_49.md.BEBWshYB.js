It comes from the upper Maastrichtian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco, North Africa. The animal is known from a holotype, consisting of a partial jaw bone, and several isolated teeth found in the same beds. Chenanisaurus is one of the largest members of the Abelisauridae, and one of the last, being a contemporary of the North American Tyrannosaurus. It would have been among the dinosaur species wiped out by the Chicxulub asteroid impact and the Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction that followed.  Description  Size of Chenanisaurus barbaricus compared to a human Chenanisaurus is quite a large abelisaurid, measuring , based on measurements of the holotype dentary. It is rivalled in size only by abelisaurids as Carnotaurus and Pycnonemosaurus. Nicholas R. Longrich and colleagues, the describers of Chenanisaurus, identified distinctive features distinguishing the animal from other abelisaurid species. The lower jaw is high, while the dentary is bent in side view. The lateral groove and associated foramina are located high on the outer surface of the dentary. The anterodorsal margin of the dentary is curved downward. The symphysis of the lower jaws is heavily built while the leading edge is vertical in side view. The front jaw points are wide in plan view, encountering each other at an obtuse angle. Holotype partial dentary of Chenanisaurus barbaricus The most striking feature of the mandible is the extreme height, especially when compared with the relatively short teeth. This seems to indicate that the jaw is also very short, with a build even more extreme than seen in the related Carnotaurus. This suggests the jaws were built to withstand a high bite force. The jaw flexes forwardly downwards to terminate in a deep blunt point. At the back there is a deep high furrow above it with a row of foramina that open towards the top in a series of vertical grooves. The high position is a basal characteristic. The outer lower side shows an ornamentation of pits and interweaved ridges. The front interdental plates are very high but they quickly lower towards the rear of the jaw. The tooth sockets are rectangular in upper view. The jaw carries at least ten teeth. These are relatively slender, but the front teeth have a D-shaped cross section with the convexity facing outward; the rear teeth are dagger-shaped and more flattened. The cutting edges are convex and show up to thirteen denticles per five millimetres at the crown base, and up to eight denticles near the apex. They have small blood grooves. The enamel has an irregular structure without clear ornamentation. Discovery and naming Chenanisaurus reconstruction Phylogenetic analysis including Chenanisaurus, based on that of Wang et al. (2017) The holotype is labelled as OCP DEK-GE 772. Individual teeth collected from the surrounding area, two premaxillary teeth labelled as OCP DEK-GE 457 and DEK-GE 458 and the maxillary tooth WDC-CCPM-005 already described in 2005,Buffetaut, E., Escuilli√©, F., Pohl, B., 2005, \\"First theropod dinosaur from the Maastrichtian phosphates of Morocco\\", Kaupia 14: 3-8 were referred to Chenanisaurus due to their similarity to the teeth of the holotype. Chenanisaurus is named after the Sidi Chennane mines where it was discovered and its specific name of barbaricus translates as \\"barbaric\\" and refers to Barbary. Classification In 2017, Chenanisaurus was placed in Abelisauridae in a basal position outside the Abelisaurinae and Carnotaurinae. Though it resembles carnotaurine abelisaurids in aspects of its jaw morphology, Chenanisaurus may belong to an as-yet undescribed group of abelisaurids unique to Africa. Only further research will determine the true relations of this species. Paleobiology Two Chenanisaurus sprinting along a coastline Chenanisaurus was a predator, like other abelisaurids. Given its size, it could have hunted relatively large prey. The lower jaw suggests a relatively short powerfully built head and jaws. Along with the large size of the animal, the proportions of the jaws would have given it a powerful bite force, suggesting the ability to prey on relatively large dinosaurs. Titanosaurian sauropods have been found in the same beds, and were likely prey for Chenanisaurus. The presence of Chenanisaurus in the phosphates is unusual because the phosphates represent a marine environment. Most of the fossils known from these beds are therefore marine animals, such as sharks, fish, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs. The presence of Chenanisaurus in these beds is therefore surprising. It is possible that some animals died and were washed out to sea by rivers; it is also possible that Chenanisaurus sometimes entered the ocean to swim. Other Gondwanan continents, such as South America, India, and Madagascar show a similar combination of titanosaurians and abelisaurids in the latest Cretaceous, suggesting a distinct evolutionary history from the Laurasian continents of Asia and North America. The finding of Chenanisaurus and these fragments of titanosaurids also indicate that in Africa, an abelisaurid/titanosaur fauna existed just prior to the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, suggesting that the faunal assemblage of Gondwana was relatively stable until that point in time. Chenanisaurus' remains were found in marine deposits that comprise most of the Sidi Chennane phosphate mines, indicating that post-mortem, the theropod had washed out to sea, where the holotype specimen became fossilized.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170503213550.htm See also * Timeline of ceratosaur research *2017 in archosaur paleontology References Abelisaurs Late Cretaceous dinosaurs of Africa Fossil taxa described in 2017 ","title":"Chenanisaurus"},{"id":"53638621","title":"Kevin Borich Express"},{"id":"53638632","text":"Jean de Tinguy du Pou√´t (23 March 1875 - 5 December 1951) was a French politician.

History In 1891, the decision was taken to divide responsibility for armament provision (for the army and the navy respectively) between the War Office and the Admiralty, with assets (including premises, personnel, equipment and supply vessels) being divided between the two services. For their part, the Admiralty established a new Naval Ordnance Store Department, based at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich and overseen by the Director of Naval Ordnance, to manage them. As part of this process, the gunwharves at Portsmouth and Chatham were each divided in two between the Navy and the Army, as were storage facilities at Woolwich Arsenal; at Plymouth the Devonport gun wharf remained with the Army, so a new naval gunwharf was set up within part of the Royal William Victualling Yard. Other ordnance locations (including some which were initially divided) ended up either with one service or the other; those that remained with the Army included Purfleet, Tipner and Weedon ordnance depots. A memorandum of 18 January 1892 stated that:Semark (1997). Page 6. ... the Official designations of the Naval Ordnance Depots at the undermentioned places will be as follows: Woolwich: H.M. Naval Gunwharf, Woolwich Arsenal; Priddy's Hard: H.M. Naval Magazine; Portsmouth: H.M. Gunwharf; Plymouth: H.M. Naval Gunwharf; Bull Point, Devonport: H.M. Naval Magazine; Chatham: H.M. Naval Gunwharf; Upnor, Rochester: H.M. Naval Magazine. By the start of the 20th century, however, all these facilities were officially known as Royal Naval Ordnance Depots (as were the smaller depots belonging to the Admiralty, both at home and overseas). It was only in the last decade of the nineteenth century that gunpowder began to lose its primacy in ordnance manufacture. Cordite was patented in 1889 and soon found widespread use as a smokeless propellant; and from 1896 lyddite began to replace gunpowder in explosive shells. Guncotton (patented in 1846 but little used subsequently due to hazards inherent in its manufacture) eventually came to be used in naval mines and torpedoes. By the end of the century the ordnance depots were being expanded and adapted to provide specialist storage magazines for these explosives, alongside substantial separate storehouses for shells and mines. (Torpedoes, and later mines, were stored in their own separate depots.) The storage requirements of cordite and dry guncotton in particular led to the characteristic layout of depots in the twentieth century: as series of small, individually-traversed, lightly-roofed, single- storey buildings interlinked by narrow-gauge railways. Several new Depots were established during, or in the run up to, the First World War, including a number in Scotland, where new naval dockyards had opened at Rosyth and Invergordon.

Regarded as a skilled writer, Blake penned several songs that were later recorded by rock and country music artists, including Johnny Horton, George Jones, and Johnny Cash among others. He also achieved modest success as a recording artist for Sun Records, but failed to record a national hit himself, a fact that frustrated Blake later in his life. Retrospectively, he has received praise for his contributions to rockabilly and was inducted in the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.  Early life  Blake was born Thomas LeVan Givens in Dallas, Texas in 1931. He never knew his father nor did he develop a healthy relationship with his mother. His troubles continued into his teen years when Blake was imprisoned on statutory rape charges. In 1951, he joined the United States Marine Corps. During his service, he lost an eye, either, as Blake claimed, while on tour in Korea or more likely during boot camp. While in the Marine Corps, Blake nurtured his ambitions of being a professional musician by frequently singing and playing on the guitar for enlisted men before his discharge.  Career  He pursued his music career further when he settled in Shreveport, Louisiana to work as a deejay for the radio station KTBS and later for KRUS. In 1954, Blake persuaded the Rhythm Rebels, a duo featuring Carl Adams (lead guitar) and Eddie Hall (bass guitar), to operate as his backing group as he began touring on the live circuit and appearing on Southern television programs to gain exposure. On one such program, Louisiana Hayride, Blake closely observed the approach of Elvis Presley whose momentous performance on the show convinced Blake to adopt characteristics of rock and roll. To capitalize on the craze for rockabilly that began to dominate the American charts, Blake recorded his debut single, \\"Koolit\\", in 1956. \\"Koolit\\" was issued by Young Records in April but it failed to chart. In 1957, Blake arranged a one-off single deal with RCA Records record producer Chet Atkins in Nashville. Atkins hired a collection of session musicians, including Buddy Killen, Farris Coursey and Floyd Cramer to record the rhythm sections. The single, which included the band originals \\"Honky Tonk Mind\\" and \\"All Night Long\\", was given the full rockabilly treatment. According to music historian Shane Hughes, the session displayed Blake and the Rhythm Rebels' potential as songwriters; however, Blake attempted to cash-in on \\"Honkey Tonk Mind\\" by offering it to Johnny Horton. RCA's competitor Columbia Records quickly released Horton's version in April 1957 under the title \\"The Woman I Need\\". Horton enjoyed a Top 10 hit on Billboard's country charts while Blake's rendition was shelved. Under advisement from RCA executives, Atkins released the other two songs recorded from Blake's session, \\"Freedom\\" and \\"Mister Hoody\\", then nullified his recording contract. Undeterred, Blake accepted a deal with Sun Records after Sam Philips met him at a disc jockey convention in Memphis. Blake worked at the label's famous RCA Studio B; he is the first recording artist to do so. Sun Records released Blake's single \\"Flat Foot Sam\\" on September 14, 1957: it sold well in regional markets and earned Blake his first brush with success. Furthermore, it instilled confidence in Sun Records to bring Blake back for a follow-up recording session that resulted in nine songs. Among the sides was \\"Ballad of a Broken Heart\\", his own self-penned composition that was later recorded by Johnny Cash as \\"Story of a Broken Heart\\". \\"Sweetie Pie\\" and \\"I Dig You Baby\\" were paired together for a single in 1958 but it sold poorly. Sensing he had little hope with writing pop songs, Blake struck a songwriting partnership with Jerry Ross to work for country artists. In 1959, Blake began collaborating with Carl Belew, an already established songwriter who had his first major success with Johnnie and Jack. Together, they achieved their biggest success with \\"Tender Years\\". However, they sold the rights to Darrell Edwards who pitched it to George Jones in 1961, taking the song to number one on the country charts. The Blake-Belew partnership is credited with a number of charting hits recorded by Charlie Walker, Stonewall Jackson, Jim Reeves, Del Reeves, and Mel Tillis, among others. Nonetheless, Blake was disenchanted with the music industry, embittered by his inability to record a successful tune himself. He worked for minor labels in the late 1960s before retiring the following decade.  Personal life  Blake suffered from alcoholism throughout the majority of his life. At the age of 54, Blake was murdered by his third wife over marital disputes on Christmas Eve in 1985. He was posthumously inducted into the Rockabilly Hall of Fame.

It denies entry, visa and residency permits to these affected foreigners. The law was a response to the BDS movement which calls for comprehensive boycotts of Israel until it complies with international law. Detractors compared the law to U.S. President Trump's recently passed \\"Muslim travel ban\\" and claimed that it violated the right to freedom of speech. It has also been criticized for failing to distinguish between those who call for a boycott of Israel and those who call for a boycott of the Israeli settlements. Supporters of the law defended it as within Israel's rights to control its borders and as a legitimate counter-measure against its opponents. The law was passed by the Knesset on March 6, 2017 by a 46-28 vote.  Background  The Entry Into Israel Law of 1952 gave discretion to the Minister of the Interior to bar any individual, including a visa holder, from entering the country. Prior to the amendment, Israeli authorities \\"felt free\\" to detain or question critics of Israel when they attempted to enter the country. American academic Norman Finkelstein was deported and given a 10-year ban in 2008, and American political activist Noam Chomsky was denied entry in 2010. In December 2016, Israel refused entry to a Malawian tourist after officials discovered she was active in the World Council of Churches, an organization which calls for the boycott of products made in Israel's West Bank settlements. BDS is a global campaign attempting to leverage economic and political pressure on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian land and the Golan Heights; introduce full equality for Arab-Palestinian citizens of Israel; and acknowledge the right of return of Palestinian refugees.\\"Palestinian Civil Society Call for BDS\\". BDS Movement, 9 July 2005. Archived on 31 January 2016 Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu has made it a priority of his administration to fight the BDS Movement.  Passage  The bill was submitted by Israeli lawmakers Bezalel Smotrich from the Jewish Home party and Roy Folkman from Kulanu. It passed its first reading in mid-January 2017. The Israeli parliament (Knesset) approved the law in its final reading on March 6 by a vote of 46-28. The bill was passed after a heated debate; it was supported by right-wing and centrist parties but opposed by left-wing parties and human rights groups.  Provision  The legislation bars the issuance of visas and residency permits to public supporters of boycotts against Israel. According to the legislation, the ban will apply to any non- citizen and non-permanent resident \\"who knowingly issues a public call for boycotting Israel that, given the content of the call and the circumstances in which it was issued, [which] has a reasonable possibility of leading to the imposition of a boycott ‚Äì if the issuer was aware of this possibility.\\" This means that it does not apply to every individual who supports a boycott; rather, it applies only to those who issued a public call with a \\"reasonable possibility\\" of leading to an actual boycott. According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the Israeli authorities and the courts are given leeway in interpreting the law and eventually deciding how this distinction will be applied. The law bars the issuance of a visa or residency permit for the targeted foreigners, but allows the Ministry of the Interior to grant exemptions at its discretion. The law could also affect Palestinian temporary residents in Israel whose applications for Israeli permanent residency are pending. The Israeli Justice Ministry had unsuccessfully asked the bill's drafters for such cases to be exempted. The law is aimed at not only those who call for a total boycott of Israel, but also those advocating boycotts of \\"any area under its control\\" ‚Äì a reference to the Israeli settlements. Thus, the law also applies to organizations such as the World Council of Churches, which opposes a general boycott against Israel but supports boycotts against the settlements because the settlements are illegal under international law.  Reactions  = Supporters = Strategic Affairs Minister Gilad Erdan defended the ban, saying that, like every country, Israel \\"has the right to determine who enters its borders\\" and that the ban was an effort against \\"those who seek to delegitimize Israel while hiding behind the language of human rights\\". Minister of Education Naftali Bennett supported the law because it allowed Israel to \\"protect itself against conspirators.\\" = Critics = Human rights groups Adalah and the Association for Civil Rights in Israel criticized the ban, arguing that it violates the \\"most basic tenets of democracy\\" to grant entry based on political opinion. Kenneth Bob, president of American leftist Zionist organization Ameinu, said that the legislation reinforces the claim that Israel uses \\"the power of the state to violate the freedom of speech of their opponents.\\" David Harris, the chief executive of the American Jewish Committee who has been active in countering the BDS movement, said that the ban would neither help defeat BDS nor help Israel's international image. The World Council of Churches criticized the law's lack of distinction between those who call for a total boycott of Israel, and those who support Israel but encourage boycotts against products from the settlements.  Impact  According to The Independent, British former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has supported \\"targeted boycotts\\" against the \\"illegal settlements in the West Bank,\\" might be impacted by the ban, along with \\"dozens\\" of other British Members of Parliament. Hannah Weisfeld, the director of British Jewish organisation Yachad, said that given that the majority of the Jewish community considered the settlements \\"a barrier to peace,\\" British visitors with relatives in Israel might be affected by the ban. Olav Fykse Tveit, the general secretary of the World Council of Churches, said that the law would prevent him or other senior leaders of the organization from visiting the holy sites in Israel and the West Bank. The World Council of Churches holds that the Israeli settlements are illegal and encourages the use of boycotts against the settlements. The law also affects Palestinians who need temporary residency permits to stay with their spouses in Israel while their family unification process is pending. Human rights group Adalah said that the law would lead to the \\"separation between spouses and children.\\" The law has since its enactment in 2017 been used on multiple occasions to deny entry to human rights activists and BDS supporters. On January 7, 2018, the Ministry of Strategic Affairs published a list of 20 non- government organizations whose officials would be banned from entering the country. The list included several chapters of the BDS, such as the Palestinian BDS National Committee, BDS France, BDS South Africa, BDS Italy, BDS Chile, BDS Kampagne but also the British anti-poverty group War on Want, the American Friends Service Committee and Jewish Voice for Peace. The list has also been used to prevent Arab MKs from going on trips abroad to meet with groups on the list. Also in 2018, Lara Alqasem, a 22-year-old U.S. citizen with Palestinian ancestry, flew to Israel with a valid student visa but was barred from entering and ordered to be deported because of her history of activism with the BDS movement and Students for Justice in Palestine. She then appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court, claiming she was no longer active in these movements, and the Court overturned her deportation. On 15 August 2019, Israel caused some controversy by refusing entry to two US congresspersons, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, known for their support for BDS. As of 2020, Israel has denied entry to 16 people based on the law, including seven French politicians and European Union parliamentarians.

She studied at Acad√©mie Colarossi in Paris with other Americans and English students. The instructors were Gustave Courtois and Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret. Beaux, also a student, described one night at Colarossi's, \\"We went with Miss Trotter and after passing through a hall of a house, descended into a strange court gleaming with broken statues, and bas reliefs, models standing around with a little flickering light falling on them. Then up and up long dark flights of stairs with only a small flaming lamp on the top step to light us into a vast atelier, where the men were fixing the gas lights not yet lighted. We didn't get started until half past-seven. Had a darling little Italian boy for a model. The most graceful, charming intelligent creature with enormous dark eyes, the brow of Apollo when you could get a glimpse of it under his shock of black hair. He entertained us with acrobatic performances during the rests.\\" In the summer of 1888, Trotter studied with Charles Lazar at the art colony in Concarneau, France. Other students from the Pennsylvania Academy at the art colony that summer were Beaux, Holme, and Florence Est√©.

Samsung officially unveiled Bixby a week before launch but it only made its first appearance during the event. Bixby can also be sideloaded on older Galaxy devices running Android Nougat. Bixby represents a major reboot for S Voice, Samsung's voice assistant app introduced in 2012 with the Galaxy S III. S Voice was later discontinued on 1 June 2020.https://m.gsmarena.com/samsung_s_voice_to_be_discontinued_on_june_1-news-42595.php In May 2017, Samsung announced that Bixby would be coming to its line of Family Hub 2.0 refrigerators, making it the first non-mobile product to include the virtual assistant. In October 2017, Samsung announced the release of Bixby 2.0 during its annual developer conference in San Francisco. The then-new version was rolled out across the company‚Äôs line of connected products, including smartphones, TVs and refrigerators. Also, third parties are allowed to develop applications for Bixby using the Samsung Developer Kit. Features Bixby comes with four parts, known as \\"Bixby Voice,\\" \\"Bixby Vision\\", \\"Bixby Home\\" and \\"Bixby Routines\\" \\"Bixby Voice\\" is the name for the method of activating Bixby by calling it or doing a long press of the Bixby Button, located below the volume rocker. A while before the phone's release, the Bixby Button was reprogrammable and could be set to open other applications or assistants, such as Google Assistant. However, near the phone's release this ability was removed with a firmware update, but can be remapped using third-party apps. \\"Bixby Vision\\" is an augmented reality camera that can identify objects in real-time and potentially offer the user to purchase them online, translate text, read QR codes, and recognize landmarks. \\"Bixby Home\\" is a vertically scrolling list of information that Bixby can interact with, for example weather, fitness activity and buttons for controlling their smart home gadgets. At the beginning Bixby supported three languages: English, Korean and Chinese. It also supports contextual search and visual search. Language and country availability Samsung reported that Bixby would not be operational on the US version of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ when the devices were first shipped to customers on 21 April 2017. Samsung stated that the key features of Bixby, including Vision, Home and Reminder, would be available with the global launch of the smartphones. Bixby Voice was intended to be made available in the US on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ later that spring. However, the release of the English version was postponed as Samsung had problems getting Bixby to fully understand the language. As of April 2018, Bixby is available in over 195 countries, but only in Korean, English (US only), and Chinese (Mandarin). The Chinese version of Bixby is only available on devices officially sold in Mainland China. Bixby Korean was launched on 1 May 2017 (KST).

Life  Johann Erhard Kapp was born in Oberkotzau, a small market town in the hill country between Leipzig and Nuremberg. His father was a carter (\\"Fuhrmann\\"). In 1796 he enrolled at the secondary school (\\"Gymnasium\\") in Hof, a couple of hours to the north of Oberkotzau. However, according to at least one source he was removed from the school after six months and instead taught privately. In 1714 he moved away from home to study at Leipzig, where he would make his career. Among his more noteworthy teachers, Christian Friedrich B√∂rner (1663-1753) taught him Biblical Exegesis and aspects of Church History. Johann Gottlob Carpzov (1679-1767) introduced him to New Testament scholarlship. In an age before university libraries had become mainstream, another Leipzig scholar, Johann Burckhardt Mencke, provided valuable support by allowing Kapp access to his extensive personal library. The denominational context in the Leipzig Theological faculty was by this time one of Lutheran orthodoxy. Thus prepared, in 1715 Kapp entered Johann Georg Walch's College of Historical Literature, obtaining on 17 February 1718 a Magister degree in Philosophy. He was by now also a member of the College of Practical Exegesis (\\"collegium exegeticum practicum\\") headed up by B√∂rner and of the College of Disputation (\\"collegium disputatiorum\\") led by Carpzov, following keenly the lectures of both men. On 20 December 1720 he received a Magister Legens (\\"Habilitation\\") degree in return for a piece of work on the distribution of indulgences. He was now qualified as a university lecturer. He also took the opportunity to produce journalistic output, producing suitably scholarly critiques of leading academics which were published under the heading \\"Nova literaria\\" in the weekly journal \\"Neue Zeitungen von gelehrten Sachen\\". On 14 March 1723 he became an Adjunct professor in the Philosophy faculty. In 1727 he became a fellow (\\"Kollegiat\\") of the Great Princely College (\\"F√ºrstenkollegium\\"). In 1727 he was granted an extraordinary professorship in Rhetoric, and on 5 April 1734 a full professorship in it. In 1735 he was given an additional post as \\"Programmatist\\". One of his responsibilities in this role involved producing biographical compilations for deceased members of the university. Kapp also took his share of administrative responsibilities more generally, serving on several occasions as dean of the Philosophy faculty. He also served as university rector on six occasion between 1734 and 1754, always during a summer term. He died after a long illness at Leipzig on 7 February 1756. By that time he had risen to the position of one of the university's \\"Decemviri\\". His extensive library was auctioned in 1758.  Family  Johann Erhard Kapp married Dorothea Sophia Weise (1709-1751) on 8 April 1738. She was a daughter of Christian Weise, the minister at St. Thomas's church in Leipzig, better remembered by subsequent generations as the church where Johann Sebastian Bach was the director of music for more than a quarter of a century. She herself was a God-daughter of Bach's fifth recorded son, Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach (1732-1795). One child of the marriage was the physician and biologist Christian Erhard Kapp (1739-1824).  Academic focus  Kapp made his name, primarily, with his work on Reformation History, much of which resonates even today. He produced a number of biographical essays on eminent contemporaries which also continue to find readers. When Valentin Ernst L√∂scher died he took over as producer of the journal \\"Unschuldige Nachrichten von alten und neuen theologischen Sachen\\", which he continued to direct till his death. Judged by his academic research work, he was a close follower of Johann Martin Chladenius' Hermeneutic approach. He joined with Siegmund Friedrich Dresig to conduct a literary disputation against Christian Siegmund Georgi in respect of the latter's New Testament exegesis and criticism.

He played three first-class matches for Cambridge University Cricket Club between 1832 and 1835. He was born at Dartmouth, Devon and died at Morleigh, also in Devon. Seale was the third son of Sir John Henry Seale, 1st Baronet, a substantial landowner and MP for Dartmouth. He was educated at Winchester College and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He appeared for Cambridge University in cricket matches that have since been deemed first- class in 1832, 1834 and 1835, and in another of lesser status in 1837; his highest score in five first-class innings was only 7, and there is no record that he bowled. Although Seale matriculated at Cambridge University in 1831, he did not graduate until 1839, when he took a Bachelor of Arts degree. He was ordained as a deacon in 1840 and as a Church of England priest in 1841, and became rector of Blackawton, Devon from 1841 to 1864 and of Morleigh also from 1841, remaining in post there until his death.

They claim Atreya Gotra and Suryavanshi lineage. The name of the clan is also transliterated as Bagale, Bagalya, Bagaalya, Bagaliya, Bagaley, Bagaale or Bagaleya. Family of Bhimsen Thapa and family of Amar Singh Thapa were two influential Bagale Thapa families at the central politics of Kingdom of Nepal. Origin and Genealogy Maharaj Kalu Thapa Kshatri, male progenitor (M≈´lapuru·π£a) of all Bagale Thapa from the account of Bagale Thapa VamsƒÅwali (genealogy) The genealogy traces the lineage of all Bagale Thapas to a male progenitor (M≈´lapuru·π£a) King Kalu Thapa Kshatri, who first ascended to the throne at KƒÅndƒÅmƒÅlikƒÅ on Saka Era 1111. The DDC of Myagdi district also confirms historical evidence of rule of Thapa dynasty of Takam State (1246-1545 B.S.) by founder Kalu Thapa, whose dynasty continued for 300 years only to be defeated by Dimba Bam Malla to form bigger Parbat State.http://ddcmyagdi.gov.np/en/brief-introduction/ =Kunwar legend= Kunwar family legend mentions that their first ancestor RƒÅma Si·πÉha RƒÅ·πáƒÅ was married to a daughter of Raja (King) of Bƒ´nƒÅtƒ´, a BagƒÅle K·π£etrƒ´ on the request by his employer hill Raja. John Whelpton opines that the legend of the Kunwar family's origins, which says their progenitor to have entered hill and married a daughter of Bagale Kshetri, might have linked their family to the Bagale Thapa, a clan of Mukhtiyar Bhimsen Thapa. History Khas Thapas belong to the Chhetri caste of the Kshatriya Varna whose origin lies in Karnali region of Khas Kingdom. Bagale Thapas were powerful and prominent family at Jumla and seemed to have migrated eastwards. In the times of Malla rule at Kathmandu valley, Bagale Thapas were considered skillful at both warfare and administration. Thus, King Jagajjaya Malla attended the services of Kashiram Thapa, a leader of Bagale Thapas to control inobedient Khas and Magar citizens. Amar Singh Thapa, one of the National heroes of Nepal and commander of Western front at Anglo-Nepalese war belonged to this clan. The family of Bada Kaji Amar Singh Thapa consists Kaji Ranajor Singh Thapa, Ranadhoj Thapa, Narsingh Thapa and their 2 more brothers who were also at Royal Court of Nepal. The family of Kaji Bir Bhadra Thapa, commander of Unification of Nepal belonged to this clan. This family contains large number of renowned courtiers and warriors. He had three sons: Jeevan Thapa(died at Battle of Kirtipur), Bangsha Raj Thapa and Amar Singh Thapa (Sardar). The children of Amar Singh Thapa (Sardar) become influential. Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, the most revered among Thapas is the eldest son of Sardar Amar Singh Thapa(sanu). His nephew, son of Nain Singh Thapa, Mathabarsingh Thapa was the seventh Prime Minister of Nepal and niece, Nain's daughter was Queen Tripurasundari of Nepal. The family of Sardar Amar Singh Thapa resided at Bagh Durbar. The recent time Army Chief of Nepal Dharmapaal Barsingh Thapa belonged to this clan.

The Gorkovsky suburban railway line connects Moscow with the station in the east, in particular, with the towns of Reutov, Balashikha, Elektrougli, Elektrostal, Noginsk, Pavlovsky Posad, Elektrogorsk, Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Pokrov, Petushki, Kosteryovo, Lakinsk, and Vladimir. The stations the line serves are located in Moscow, as well as in the towns of Reutov, Balashikha, Elektrogorsk, Elektrostal, Noginsk, Pavlovsky Posad, and Orekhovo-Zuyevo in Moscow Oblast, as well as in Petushinsky District, Sobinsky District, and the city of Vladimir of Vladimir Oblast. The suburban trains have their western terminus at Moscow Kursky railway station in Moscow. In the eastern direction, the suburban trains terminate at Balashikha, Zheleznodorozhnaya, Kupavna, Fryazevo, Zakharovo, Elektrogorsk, Petushki, and Vladimir. The line is served by Moscow Railway between Moscow and Petushki and by Gorky Railway between Petushki and Vladimir. The suburban railway line follows the railway which connects Moscow with Nizhny Novgorod (formerly Gorky, hence the name) via Vladimir. It is fully electrified. Between Moscow and Vladimir, there are two tracks. The distance between Moscow Kurskaya railway station and Vladimir is . The rails are used, in addition to suburban trains, also by long-distance trains to Moscow from the Urals and Siberia. Some of these trains terminate at Moscow Kursky railway station, and others terminate at Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station, arriving there via Fryazevo and Mytishchi. History The construction of the railway between Moscow and Vladimir started in 1858, the stretch was open in 1861 and extended to Nizhny Novgorod in 1862. The terminal station was Nizhegorodsky Railway Station in Moscow, at Rogozhsky Val Street. In 1893, the government bought the railway, and on 1 January 1894 the Moscow-Kursk, Nizhny Novgorod and Murom Railway was created. In 1896, Kursky railway station was opened, and on 14 June 1896 the trains from Nizhny Novgorod started to run to that station. Nizhegorodsky Railway Station was used for cargo traffic, and eventually disused and demolished. The suburban railway line was electrified in stretches. From 1931 to 1933, the stretch between Moscow and Obiralovka (currently Zheleznodorozhnaya) was electrified; in 1933, Reutovo to Balashikha, in 1957 Zheleznodorozhnaya to Fryazevo and Fryazevo to Noginsk, and in 1958 Fryazevo to Petushki. The part between Petushki and Vladimir was electrified in 1959. The poem in prose Moscow-Petushki by Venedikt Yerofeyev, written between 1969 and 1970, is set on a suburban train, which travels from Moscow to Petushki. Every chapter is named for a stretch between adjacent stops. Stations Following the standard notations in Russia, a railway stop below is called a station if it is a terminus or if it has a cargo terminal, and it is called a platform (railway stop) otherwise. =Moscow to Vladimir= # Moscow Kursky railway station, transfer to Kurskaya metro station (Arbatsko‚ÄìPokrovskaya line), Kurskaya metro station (Koltsevaya line), Chkalovskaya metro station; # Serp i Molot (platform), Ploshchad Ilyicha metro station, Rimskaya metro station; # Karacharovo (platform), Nizhegorodskaya Moscow Central Circle station; # Chukhlinka (platform); # Kuskovo (station); # Novogireyevo (platform); # Reutovo (station), connection to Balashikha; # Nikolskoye (platform); # Saltykovskaya (platform); # Kuchino (platform); # Zheleznodorozhnaya (station).

In the Franco- Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, he was appointed chief physician of a field hospital and later given responsibility for a division; when the war was over, he took up a post at the Invalidenhaus Berlin and three years later served as a regimental physician. In 1879, he returned to Frederick William University as Professor of War Medicine, serving from 1879 to 1892 and he helped to treat Emperor Wilhelm I, earning his confidence and treating his son. Emperor Wilhelm II appointed him personal physician in 1888 and the following year, he was made surgeon-general of the Guard Corps. In 1901, he became surgeon- general of the Army and Chief of the Medical Corps. He held a number of other senior or honorary posts in connection with military medicine and founded the German Military Magazine in 1872 to help further knowledge and interest in the subject. In recognition for his service, Leuthold was ennobled in 1897 and received the Grand Cross of the Red Eagle Order in 1903. In 1901, he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. He died on 3 December 1905 in Berlin; his wife, Elisabeth, had died in 1902 and with her he had one son and one daughter.The London Gazette, 15 February 1901 (issue 27285), p. 1145  References  1832 births 1905 deaths German surgeons Grand Crosses of the Order of the Red Eagle Honorary Knights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order ","title":"Rudolf von Leuthold"},{"id":"53639996","text":"Chariesthes similis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

After issuing Flow in 1991, the band members wrote new material separately, sending each other ideas, until more concrete ideas were becoming formed, leading to the band recording Interstate between two studios in 1993 and 1994. Defined by a breezy, wide-open sound, Interstate features sparse, rhythmic guitar riffs, organ playing, drums and thematic instrumentation, in addition to a distinctive compositional style that has been compared to \\"the dynamics of a good conversation\\" by one critic. Additionally, the album has been considered a post-rock album and critics have noticed its display of krautrock influences. Named in relation to the band's collaborative efforts given that the members live great distances from each other, Interstate was released on DGC, their only album on a major label. Several journalists have pointed out the unlikeliness of the album being released on a major label. Nonetheless, the album was greeted with critical acclaim, with critics complimenting its tight, ensemble sound. It was a mild radio success, reaching number 37 on the CMJ Top 75 Alternative Radio Play chart, and has since been accredited as having helped widen the audience for alienated instrumental rock. Background and recording Instrumental rock band Pell Mell, who were \\"deeply involved\\" in the 1990s alternative movement, had existed since the early 1980s, and although based in Portland, Oregon, the band members lived in four separate American coastal cities, composing music by sending ideas to each other via e-mail, telephone or post: \\"Ideas are sent back and forth and when something takes shape, the members then converge in one city to record as a band.\\" By 1995, the band consiststed of four multi- instrumentalists: Greg Freeman, Robert Beerman, David Spalding and Steve Fisk, the thirst three of whom made up the band's trio of guitarists. By the time Pell Mell began recording Interstate, David Spalding had become the band's \\"new key and core member.\\" This follows in the footsteps of the band's previous album, Flow (1991), their final album for SST Records which saw Spalding write seven of the album's tracks. He is credited as a writer on ten of the twelve tracks on Interstate, two of which were co-written by Beerman and two others co-written by Freeman, who also contributed two of his own tracks. In August 1993, the band began recording Interstate at Lowdown, San Francisco, and continued recording in June and October 1994 at Fort Apache Studios, Cambridge. The album was also engineered at both studios and mixed at the latter alone, while being mastered by Eddy Schreyer at Los Angeles' Future Disc. The band's \\"unsurprising ability\\" in self-producing the album, alongside several members of the album engineering and mixing the album with help from Tim O'Heir, contributes to the album's \\"full-sounding\\" and \\"dramatic\\" sound. Music Steve Fisk's usage of a Hammond B-3 helps contribute to the album's sound. Interstate uses only guitars, drums and organ to create its \\"striking and often emotional take on instrumental rock.\\" The record is driven by rhythmic, sparse and evocative guitar riffs, and piano hooks which are then \\"exalted by Steve Fisk's Hammond B-3 organ, occasional mellontronic meddlings and thematic guitar melodies.\\" Several critics highlighted the album's ensemble dynamic and breezy, open feel; Ned Raggett of AllMusic noted a \\"wide- open feeling of many of the songs, suggesting a slightly dreamy America where there's little around but the weather and the land,\\" while Tim Kenneally of SF Weekly similar noted the album works as a \\"sonic analogue to a cross-country road trip.\\" Describing the track structures, Bob Gulla of CMJ New Music Monthly said: The band's press release described the album as possessing a \\"post-rock, guitar centric, instrumental sound design that's difficult to categorize.\\" Indeed, Spin magazine described the record as \\"leaning towards moody surf rock and proto-post rock when [the band] leaned towards any rock at all.\\" Michael Lipton of LA Weekly wrote that Interstate \\"recalled spaghetti Westerns, the minimalist rhythms of '80s N.Y. band Polyrock and a dash of Booker T. organ.\\" Anthony Violanti, writing for The Buffalo News, meanwhile, noted the \\"old-fashioned style,\\" citing the usage of \\"tight guitars, a tough bass and driving drum riffs that all blend in instrumental form.\\" Len Comaratta of Consequence of Sound compared the album to \\"Outer Accelerator\\" by Stereolab from their album Mars Audiac Quintet (1994). Opening track \\"Nothing Lies Still Long\\" has been compared to the Ventures, and is followed by \\"Revival\\", which is similarly rock-flavored. \\"Anna Karina\\" is a slower, wistful track with \\"hints of steel guitar twang.\\" Raggett described it and \\"Constellation\\", which is \\"layered with twangy guitar beats,\\" as two examples of the album's wide-open feel. The band's \\"longtime fascination with krautrock\\" is evident with the motorik drive on \\"Saucer\\", reminiscent of Can and Stereolab, and driven by \\"an incessant beat and driving bass,\\" and \\"Blacktop.\\" Fisk in particular has been highlighted on several tracks, including with his \\"buzzing organ break\\" on \\"Revival\\" and \\"his Hammond work\\" on \\"Vegetable Kingdom.\\" Release Pell Mell were struggling to think of a name for the album, leading graphic designer Clifford Stoltze to recommend the name Interstate, as a reference to the band members living \\"in four different cities [being] able to stay together by sending audio tapes through the mail and traveling to meet for recording sessions;\\" the band agreed on the name. Stoltze then worked with Beerman, himself also a graphic designer, on designing the album sleeve, by pulling together an \\"abundance of materials.\\" The album cover depicts a photograph that Stoltze snapped on a road trip through Wyoming, while other photographs taken by band members are also used in the album sleeve. Taking inspiration from the album title, Stoltze chose the Interstate typeface for the band's name on the cover. Interstate was released by major label DGC on 25 April 1995 in the United States as their first and only album on a major label. Many have commented on the unlikeliness of the album's release on DGC; Ned Raggett wrote: \\"the idea that Pell Mell would have ended up on a company run by David Geffen must have seemed truly bizarre when the band first started, but that's what a little Nirvana can do for bands (and so it must have seemed for many an alternative outfit in the early '90s).\\" Similarly, in 2013, Spin ranked the album at number 13 in its list of the \\"40 Weirdest Post-Nevermind Major Label Albums,\\" with Andrew Earles of the magazine saying: In addition to CD and cassette editions, the album was also released as a translucent gold LP in the United States. The album was a mild radio success, reaching number 34 on CMJ's \\"Top 75 Alternative Radio Play\\" chart, compiled from airplay reports of the most played alternative releases on around 500 different commercial, non-commercial and college radio stations. New Zealand-based independent label Flying Nun Records released Interstate in Europe in 1995, or, in some regions, on March 4, 1996. Critical reception Interstate was released to critical acclaim by music critics, with the album's warm, band dynamic and relaxed feel being frequently highlighted. Anthony Violanti of The Buffalo News rated the album four stars out of five and said: \\"Pell Mell has one of the most original sounds in contemporary music. It's refreshing to see an instrumental band back in rock 'n' roll.\\" Ned Raggett of AllMusic gave the album the same rating, saying \\"it's an ensemble performance at heart, and an excellent one\\" which was the most fine example of the band's talents. CMJ New Music Monthly named the album \\"Best New Music\\", and Bob Gulla's review for the magazine noted the album's no-frills \\"good old-fashioned ensemble chemistry\\" and unexpected feel. Thomas Kerpen of the Ox fanzine was favorable and highlighted the album's \\"great instrumental sounds\\" and particularly the \\"melodic atmospheric guitars, no wonder with three guitarists.\\" Similarly favorable although slightly more reserved, Paul Lukas and Ira Robbins of Trouser Press described Interstate as \\"a solid continuation of Flow's sound, although it has less consistently stellar material.\\" In early 1996, Raoul Hernandez of The Austin Chronicle ranked the album at number 6 in his favourite American, non-local albums of 1995, joint place with fellow instrumental rock band Friends of Dean Martinez's The Shadow of Your Smile. He wrote that the two albums, alongside the music of Dirty Three, The Mermen and The Denison/Kimball Trio, \\"helped bring instrumental modes of rock alienation into the mainstream.\\" Radio series Living on Earth have used \\"Anna Karina\\" as soundtrack music. Mars Simpson of Treble Zine suggested that Japancakes' Loveless (2007) was similar to Interstate, Tortoise's TNT (1998) and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless (1991).

Formed in March 1919, the division became part of the famed 1st Cavalry Army in the fall of that year, and fought in the Red Army's successful counteroffensive against the Armed Forces of South Russia. After Denikin's defeat in the spring of 1920, the division and the 1st Cavalry Army were transferred northwestwards to fight in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, where they recaptured Kiev. During the summer of 1920 the division and the army became bogged down in the Battle of Lw√≥w, which resulted in Soviet defeat to the north in the Battle of Warsaw, and the reinforcing 1st Cavalry Army was defeated when it attempted to intervene in the latter. This began a disorganized Soviet retreat, which the army participated in. The division and its army were transferred to Crimea, where Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel led the remnants of the White Army. After the evacuation of remaining White forces from Crimea, the division was moved to Belarus, where it remained for the interwar period. In 1939 and 1940, the 6th Division participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland and the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. After returning to Belarus at the conclusion of the Lithuanian occupation, the division was destroyed in the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union and officially disbanded in September.  History  The division traced its lineage back to the 1st Stavropol Cavalry Division, formed in October 1918 from the Stavropol Cavalry Brigade, composed of Stavropol partisan cavalry. On 20 January 1919, the division was renamed the 1st Soviet Cavalry Division. After the disbandment of the Caspian-Caucasian Front, all of its cavalry units, including the division, were consolidated into a single cavalry division by an order dated 18 March 1919. On 26 March, the division was redesignated the 6th Cavalry Division. The division became part of the 10th Army and was commanded by Iosif Apanasenko.

It is an example of cloud based quantum computing. As of May 2018, there are three processors on the IBM Quantum Experience: two 5-qubit processors and a 16-qubit processor. This service can be used to run algorithms and experiments, and explore tutorials and simulations around what might be possible with quantum computing. The site also provides an easily discoverable list of research papers published using the IBM Quantum Experience as an experimentation platform. IBM's quantum processors are made up of superconducting transmon qubits, located in a dilution refrigerator at the IBM Research headquarters at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Users interact with a quantum processor through the quantum circuit model of computation, applying quantum gates on the qubits using a GUI called the quantum composer, writing quantum assembly language code or through Qiskit.  History  In May 2016, IBM launched the IBM Quantum Experience, with a five qubit quantum processor and matching simulator connected in a star shaped pattern, which users could only interact with through the quantum composer, with a limited set of two-qubit interactions, and a user guide that assumed background in linear algebra. In July 2016, IBM launched the IBM Quantum Experience community forum. In January 2017, IBM made a number of additions to the IBM Quantum Experience, including increasing the set of two-qubit interactions available on the five qubit quantum processor, expanding the simulator to custom topologies up to twenty qubits, and allowing users to interact with the device and simulator using quantum assembly language code. In March 2017, IBM released Qiskit to enable users to more easily write code and run experiments on the quantum processor and simulator, as well as introduced a user guide for beginners. In May 2017, IBM made an additional 16 qubit processor available on the IBM Quantum Experience. In January 2018, IBM launched a quantum awards program, which it hosts on the IBM Quantum Experience.  Quantum Composer  Screen shot showing the result of running a GHZ state experiment using the IBM Quantum Composer The Quantum Composer is a graphic user interface (GUI) designed by IBM to allow users to construct various quantum algorithms or run other quantum experiments. Users may see the results of their quantum algorithms by either running it on a real quantum processor and using \\"units\\" or by using a simulator. Algorithms developed in the Quantum Composer are referred to as a \\"quantum score\\", in reference to the Quantum Composer resembling a musical sheet. The IBM Quantum Experience currently contains a library teaching users how to use the Quantum Composer. The library consists of two guides: Beginner's Guide, Full User Guide. There are additional tutorials about using the IBM Quantum Experience machines in the github repo for Qiskit accessed from qiskit.org. The composer can also be used in scripting mode, where the user can write programs in the QASM-language instead. = Example script = Below is an example in the QASM-language of a very small program, built for IBMs 5-qubit computer. The program instructs the computer to generate the state \\\\Psi\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(000\\\\rangle+111\\\\rangle\\\\right), a 3-qubit GHZ state, which can be thought of as a variant of the Bell state, but with three qubits instead of two. It then measures the state, forcing it to collapse to one of the two possible outcomes, 000\\\\rangle or 111\\\\rangle. include \\"qelib1.inc\\" qreg q[5]; // allocate 5 qubits (set automatically to 00000>) creg c[5]; // allocate 5 classical bits h q[0]; // hadamard-transform qubit 0 cx q[0], q[1]; // conditional pauli X-transform (ie. \\"CNOT\\") of qubits 0 and 1 // At this point we have a 2-qubit Bell state (00> + 11>)/sqrt(2) cx q[1], q[2]; // this expands entanglement to the 3rd qubit measure q[0] -> c[0]; // this measurement collapses the entire 3-qubit state measure q[1] -> c[1]; // therefore qubit 1 and 2 read the same value as qubit 0 measure q[2] -> c[2]; Every instruction in the QASM language is the application of a quantum gate, initialization of the chips registers to zero or measurement of these registers. = Beginner's guide = The Beginner's Guide introduces users to the terminology and conceptual knowledge of quantum mechanics needed to compose quantum scores. The beginners guide introduces readers to the elementary concepts of quantum computing: behavior of qubits, quantum entanglement, and quantum gates. = Full user guide = The full user guide is more in depth and analytical compared to the beginner's guide, and is recommended for those with experience in linear algebra or quantum computing. Unlike the beginners guide, the full user guide contains quantum algorithm examples, with explanations comparing quantum algorithms to their classical counterparts. Both of the Beginner and Full User Guides can be updated by anyone via the Qiskit GitHub repository.  Usage  IBM reports that there are over 80,000 users of the IBM Quantum Experience, who have collectively run over 3 million experiments. Many of these users are active researchers who have collectively published at least 72 academic papers using the platform. University professors are also integrating examples and experiments based on the IBM Quantum Experience into their educational curricula. Dr. Christine Corbett Moran, a postdoctoral fellow at the California Institute of Technology, used the IBM Quantum Experience while she was doing research in Antarctica.

He often referred to as the father of modern Bokator and is largely credited with reviving the art. San Kim Sean is the founder of the Cambodia Bokator Federation and the Cambodia Bokator Academy. The term Bokator translates as pounding a lion from the words bok meaning to pound and tor meaning lion. At the time of the Pol Pot regime (1975‚Äì1979) those who practiced traditional arts were either systematically exterminated by the Khmer Rouge, fled as refugees or stopped teaching. After the Khmer Rouge regime, the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia began and native martial arts were completely outlawed. After the Pol Pot era, San Kim Sean had to flee Cambodia to the United States under accusations by the Vietnamese of teaching hapkido and Bokator. Once in America, San Kim Sean started teaching hapkido at a local YMCA in Houston, Texas and later moved to Long Beach, California. After living in the United States and teaching and promoting hapkido, San Kim Sean decided to return to Cambodia to revive Bokator. San Kim Sean left the United States in 1992 and returned home to give Bokator back to his people. In 2001, San Kim Sean moved to Phnom Penh and after getting permission from the new King Norodom Sihanouk to begin teaching bokator to the local youth. That same year in the hopes of bringing all of the remaining living masters together San Kim Sean began traveling the country seeking out Bokator lok kru, or instructors, who had survived the Khmer Rouge regime. The few men San Kim Sean found were old, ranging from sixty to ninety years of age; many were afraid to teach the art of Bokator openly. After much persuasion and with government approval, San Kim Sean effectively reintroduced Bokator to the Cambodian people.

Trains could only leave the site going south-eastwards onto the Leeds Northern Railway towards Ripon, but a reversal was possible into Thirsk railway station after crossing the main line between York and Darlington. History The station was opened with the line in January 1848 and initially only served freight traffic with passenger trains starting in June of the same year. Passenger trains continued to use the station for seven years until all workings were diverted to serve Thirsk railway station (on the York, Newcastle and Berwick Railway) leaving only freight trains serving Thirsk Town terminus. The station was part of the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, which became the Leeds Northern Railway and in 1854 amalgamated with other companies to form the North Eastern Railway (NER). The NER was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and became part of the North Eastern Region of British Rail upon Nationalisation in 1948. The original Leeds and Thirsk line was closed in 1958 and lifted in 1959. The goods station at Thirsk Town stayed open until October 1966 with trains travelling down to Thirsk Town Junction and then reversing northwards for onto the East Coast Main Line and into Thirsk railway station.

MDRI is different to HIPC, but operationally related. Countries in the termination point get full relief of their debt with IMF, International Development Association (IDA) and the African Development Bank (AfDB). MDRI was approved for encouraging debtor countries to continue their political reforms. For reasons of equal treatment of Low Income Countries (LIC) the relieved debts were counted when new ancillary remedies were guaranteed by IDA and AfDB. G8 members committed themselves to compensate IDA and AfDB refluxes with further remedies. These compensations will be shared among IDA and AfDB beneficiary countries according to the efforts they make (performance based allocation). How does MDRI work IMF, IDA and AfDB fully relieve the debt of countries which attain (after complying with specific conditions that are detailed in HIPC page) termination point ‚Äî the step where a country is eligible to receive total and irrevocable relief of its debt‚Äî in HIPC's frame. The difference with HIPC consists of MDRI not covering all creditors, only IMF, IDA and AfDB. Besides, under MDRI, IMF also provided debt relief to non- HIPC countries whose per capita income did not exceed 380 $ and were indebted with IMF until the end of 2004. Thus a uniform treatment in IMF resources management is guaranteed. Cost Total debt relief provided by IMF through MDRI lied around USD 3.4 billion, in nominal terms.

Electric fire engines were first proposed in the 19th century to replace the steam pumpers used for firefighting. The electric motor was claimed to be simpler, cleaner, and faster in operation, would save money, and require less maintenance than the steam fire engine. Contemporary battery- operated models also exist.  History  =Schuyler Wheeler invention= Wheeler 1885 fire engine invention American inventor Schuyler Wheeler patented an electric fire engine system in the United States in 1885. He filed his invention in 1882 and the patent was issued in 1885. The system included electrical infrastructure, with electric motor driven water pumps, on a horse- drawn vehicle. The fire-engine vehicle was designed with the same general equipment as a regular steam fire engine of the time, but used electrically operated equipment instead of steam power. It was designed with an electrical regulator, and a switch for the main electric motor that drove the water pump, that pushed water through the fire-hoses used to put out the fire. The electric motor was equipped with several hundred feet of cable carried on a reel. The cable attached to a specially designed electrical outlet box that was nearest to the fire. The box would be located next to the water plugs throughout the city districts in the manner previously mentioned. When the engine was tested, it gave very good results, and is now in use at the factory of the Crocker-Wheeler Electric Company, in Ampere, New Jersey. The company claimed that an electric fire engine of the same capacity as a steam fire engine would be more efficient. =Joseph Sachs invention= Joseph Sachs had also invented an electric fire engine vehicle consisting of a wagon on which a spring-supported platform held an electric motor which operated two rotary water pumps. The motor was supplied with a reel of electric cable and it could be regulated from either side of the vehicle. =American experiments= upright 0.75 There were various experimental illustrations showing what an electrical fire engine could do better than a steam fire engine if the complete system was put into operation. One set up demonstration was at the Crystal palace electrical exhibition of 1892. The Electric Fire Engine Company of Seneca Falls, New York, was formed on 25 June 1890, to manufacture the fire engine apparatus and associated equipment. The Electric Fire Engine Company of America was formed December 1899 in Des Moines, Iowa. It was to manufacture self-propelled automobile electric fire engines and general equipment for fire departments. The Springfield, Massachusetts, city fire department purchased an electric fire truck with an automatic extending ladder that was operated by electricity in 1910. The aerial ladder was long and electrically raised, instead of being hand cranked by firemen to use it. Other city fire departments in the state were watching its tests as they considered whether or not to purchase it for their firemen. The Cincinnati fire department implemented use of battery-powered electrical fire engines, which were claimed to be much more effective than horse drawn engines. =European experiments= Siemens electric fire engine, circa 1891 Experimental electric fire-engines were made for testing in France, Germany and England starting in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use. =21st-century operated models= In the twentieth century, some manufacturers have designed storage battery-operated, self-propelled models, which they claim are a better, cleaner and greener alternative to gasoline and diesel fuel fire trucks. These are said to be better suited for particular types of environments, e.g., hotels and resorts, manufacturing facilities. Harnessing battery power is an old idea, going back to the nineteen hundreds. It joins an increasingly longer list of production battery-operated vehicles. In 2002, the French car manufacturer Peugeot designed an electric fire engine with a futuristic appearance. It is a fuel cell battery vehicle that is designed halfway between a twenty-first century automobile and an ordinary gasoline fire engine. The front part carries two firemen, and the rear is a large water-tank with a ladder on top. The state-of-the-art vehicle makes its own hydrogen and oxygen needed to supply the fuel cell battery that operates the vehicle, water pump, smoke extractors, and electronic equipment. In 2017, Rosenbauer introduced a concept vehicle named the Concept Fire Truck (CFT). The CFT would have all- wheel drive and all-wheel steering, with each of its four wheels powered by an electric motor, with a diesel-powered auxiliary engine as a backup range extender. In 2020, Rosenbauer announced that the production model ‚Äî renamed the RT ‚Äî would begin trials with Amsterdam, Dubai, and the Australian Capital Territory. Background of design considerations When conceived in the nineteenth century, the electric fire engine was proposed to replace the steam fire engine in use at the time. It was to be constructed in such a way that it would use a supply of electrical power that came from a central station whereby electricity could be distributed to various covered stations and city supply points. This would require underground or overhead wiring similar to that used for electric light, trolleys, and other power users of the time. It was thought that the wiring could supply electricity to various outlet posts at strategic places throughout a city or fire protected district. These outlets would supply the necessary current to the fire-engine's electric motor. The vehicle itself was to be hauled by horses and would consist of a carriage wagon with an electric motor-powered water pump permanently mounted atop. There would be cables from the motor that would connect to the outlet post to obtain the required supply of electrical current. =Advantages= Nineteenth-century steam fire engine in Mackinaw Island museum The electric fire engine would have several advantages over the steam fire engine. One was that an electric fire engine could be brought to full power immediately, whereas a steam fire engine took time. It was necessary to keep the fire going all the time to boil the water on a steam pump vehicle, with workmen furnishing coal for it. This was required so that as little time as possible was lost getting the water to boil to produce steam to run the water pump to extinguish the fire. In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation. Other advantages of using an electric fire engine were that it would not produce loud noises, smoke, dust, cinders and ashes, as steam fire engines did. Also, the cost of an electric fire engine would be about one-third that of a steam boiler fire engine. A typical electric fire engine weighed sixty percent less than a steam boiler of the same capacity. =Disadvantages= There were experimental test operations set up to see if the idea was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth- century to operate such a system. Another disadvantage was the possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures ‚Äì which often happened during storms. The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines with electric ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward. The portable electric fire engine would be efficient and practical only if a supply of electricity was available in a city for this purpose. An argument against the high cost of such an electrical installation was that the cost would be lower in a city or district where there was already an infrastructure set up to power electric lighting and electrical railways. The same current supply could be used for the electric fire engine system.  See also  *Alexander Bonner Latta *Charles A.

It was opened in 1849 and is the oldest preserved station building in the state, although it has extended in 1872 and 1896. When it was built, Bexbach was in the Circle of the Rhine (Rheinkreis) of the Kingdom of Bavaria. It was put into operation together with Homburg Hauptbahnhof and the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzische Ludwigsbahn). Homburg station, which was destroyed during the Second World War, received a new entrance building at the beginning of the 1950s, but Bexbach station was preserved. When it was built, it was a border station between Bavaria and Prussia and also the terminus of the historic Palatine Ludwig Railway. Today, it is a through station on the Homburg‚ÄìNeunkirchen railway. The building and its surrounding area have been given heritage protection.  History Station goods shed Land purchases for the railway line and Bexbach station began in 1845. A single-track line was completed to Bexbach in the summer of 1848 and one year later it was extended to the border at Wellesweiler. A year later, the line was connected to the Heinitz colliery on Prussian territory. The most important reason for the construction of the entire line was the transport of coal from the mines located on Bavarian territory in Bexbach, St. Ingbert and (later) also Frankenholz. For many years coal was transported from the mines to Bexbach station in horse carts and later from Frankenholz by ropeway conveyor. With the closure of the Bexbach and Frankenholz pits in 1959, freight traffic at the Bexbach station drastically declined. Today there are two through tracks, three shunting tracks and a siding with a total of 13 sets of points. The goods shed was built in 1872/73. In addition, Bexbach station was of great strategic importance as it was the area of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71. At the north end of the station, a 500-metre-long loading ramp was built in 1870, (Google eBook) which was able to unload more than 50 troop trains a day in the First World War. An equally long loading dock was built in Limbach bei Homburg (Saar) on the Rohrbach‚ÄìHomburg (Saar) railway and in Blieskastel-Lautzkirchen on the Landau‚ÄìRohrbach railway. The line was electrified in 1966. In the course of the Second World War, work started in 1939 on building a strategic railway from Waldmohr-J√§gersburg station on the Glan Valley Railway (Glantalbahn) to Bexbach, bypassing Homburg. This work was abandoned in May 1940.  Entrance building Originally the two-storey entrance building was built as a simple rectangular building in the Rundbogenstil (\\"round arch style\\") similar to those of Kaiserslautern (1848) and Frankenthal (1853). The original plans of the ground plan are no longer available, but recent plans suggest that a central corridor from the \\"house platform\\" must have existed from the establishments of the station forecourt. There were ticket office and other offices on the right (east) side. On the left side, a narrow corridor led to the baggage handling and the waiting rooms. The larger of the two was for the 1st and 2nd classes and included a restaurant. At the end of the corridor was the waiting room for the 3rd and 4th classes, which also included a restaurant. The latter room was a separate extension and was accessible through two doors from the street side and the platform. Later in the history of the building all the waiting rooms were removed and replaced by a large hall. The cast iron canopy of the house platform was built around the turn of the century, but it was removed at the latest in the early 1980s during one of the many modifications of the station. Further renovations took place in the early 1960s and 1977 and the character of the building has largely been destroyed, similar to other Saarland station buildings such as in Luisenthal, Bous, Rohrbach, Lebach and many others. Today, the station building is no longer accessible for public transport operations.  Current condition There are only minimal service facilities at the station and the station is not adapted for accessibility. In the second half of 2011, the platform was equipped with a dynamic platform display.

This was the third local election to take place using the Single Transferable Vote electoral system. Background At the previous election in 2012, Independent councillors were the largest grouping on the council, with a total of 15 councillors, while the Scottish National Party (SNP) had 13 councillors. Following that election, an administration was formed between the SNP and the Argyll First group of independent councillors. However, this coalition broke down in 2013, after the SNP National Executive prevented the SNP group forming a coalition with the Scottish Conservatives and the Scottish Liberal Democrats. Four members of the SNP group (former SNP group leader Roddy McCuish, Mary Jean Devon, Michael Breslin and Robert MacIntyre) left the SNP in 2013, following the collapse of the SNP-independent administration, and sat as independents for the remainder of their terms as councillors. A coalition of Independents, Scottish Conservatives, and Liberal Democrats was formed in October 2013, led by an independent councillor, Dick Walsh. The collapse of the SNP-independent administration led to an investigation by Audit Scotland. A number of councillors who had been elected in 2012 did not serve a full term and resigned prior to the 2017 elections: * SNP councillor Fred Hall left the SNP group in 2013 and sat as an independent. He resigned in 2014, which led to a by-election in the Oban South and the Isles ward in May 2014, which was won by Neil MacIntyre for Scottish Labour. * Louise Lee, who had been elected for the SNP for Oban North and Lorn in 2012, also resigned in 2014, resulting in a by- election in July 2014, which was won by the independent candidate John McGregor, who died shortly afterwards. The death of John MacGregor led to another by-election in Oban North and Lorn, which was won by Iain MacLean for the SNP in October 2014. Iain MacLean left the SNP in March 2016 and sat for the remainder of his term as an independent. * John Semple, SNP councillor for South Kintyre, also resigned after the Scottish Independence referendum, leading to a by-election in December 2014, which was won by John Armour for the SNP. * Duncan MacIntyre (Independent, Oban North and Lorn) resigned for health reasons in December 2015. His seat was won by Julie MacKenzie for the SNP in February 2016. * Iain Angus MacDonald, who had originally been elected as an Independent councillor for Oban North and Lorn in 2012, joined the SNP in September 2014, but resigned in March 2016. The resulting by-election in June 2016 was won by an independent, Kieron Green. Eight of the sitting councillors did not seek re-election, including the outgoing council leader Dick Walsh (Independent), Michael Breslin (Independent, originally SNP), Iain MacLean (Independent, originally SNP)), Vivien Dance (Independent), Bruce Marshall (Independent), Isobel Strong (SNP), Neil MacIntyre (Scottish Labour), and Maurice Corry (Scottish Conservative). Results The SNP became the largest party on the council for the first time, as the Independent group lost a third of its seats compared to the previous election. The Conservatives gained five seats and the Liberal Democrats gained two, but both remained in their respective places as the two smaller parties. Despite the SNP's position, a coalition was formed of Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and Independents, referred to as The Argyll Lomond and the Isles Group (TALIG). Aileen Morton, leader of the group, was elected as council leader. Ward results =South Kintyre= *There was no election for the ward of South Kintyre, a three-member ward, as there were only three candidates nominated: Donald Kelly (Scottish Conservative), John Armour (SNP), and Rory Colville (Liberal Democrat), all of whom were the incumbent councillors for the ward. =Kintyre and the Islands= (Includes Colonsay, Gigha, Islay, Jura, Scarba) *2012: 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xSNP; 1xLib Dem; 1xConservative *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain one seat from Independent =Mid Argyll= *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2012-2017 Change: No change =Oban South and the Isles= (Includes Coll, Iona, Mull, Tiree) *2012: 3xSNP; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: Conservative and Independent gain one seat each from SNP =Oban North and Lorn= *2012: 3xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: Conservative gain from Independent =Cowal= *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 1xSNP; 1xConservative; 1xLiberal Democrat *2012-2017 Change: Conservative & Liberal Democrat each gain one seat from Independent =Dunoon= *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2017: 1xSNP; 1xCon; 1xIndependent *2012-2017 Change: Con gain one seat from Independent =Isle of Bute= *2012: 2xSNP; 1xIndependent *2017: 2xIndependent; 1xSNP *2012-2017 Change: Independent gain one seat from SNP =Lomond North= *2012: 2xIndependent; 1xCon *2017: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 1xIndependent; *2012-2017 Change: SNP gain from Independent =Helensburgh Central= *2012: 1xIndependent; 1xSNP; 1xCon; 1xLib Dem *2017: 1xCon; 1xSNP; 2xLib Dem *2012-2017 Change: Lib Dem gain from Independent =Helensburgh and Lomond South= *2012: 1xLib Dem; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2017: 1xLib Dem; 1xSNP; 1xCon *2012-2017 Change: No Change References 2017 Scottish local elections Argyll and Bute Council elections ","title":"2017 Argyll and Bute Council election"},{"id":"53640849","text":"Asa Keisar (; born September 1, 1973)Sara Toth Stub, \\"Life After Brisket,\\" Tablet, February 16, 2016.Jonathan Mashaal, \\"Shred day-old chicks for money?

He has given many public lectures across Israel in support of veganism as both a Torah imperative to avoid cruelty to animals, as well as it being the Torah‚Äôs ideal for mankind. Early life and education Keisar was born and raised in a National Religious home in Kiryat Ono, Israel.Abigail Klein Leichman, \\"The (Halachic) Case for Veganism,\\" The Jerusalem Post, December 12, 2015.

He served in the Israeli army, and later studied at a Haredi yeshiva in Israel. Vegan advocacy Keisar became a vegan after learning about the widespread animal welfare issues present in today's egg and dairy factory farms. In 2015, he wrote the book Velifnei Iver (translated as Before the Blind, in reference to the commandment in the Book of Leviticus, \\"Do not put a stumbling block before the blind\\"). In the book he makes the case that eating meat and animal byproducts is no longer permitted according to Jewish sources, because of the cruelty inflicted on animals by the modern mass production of meat, dairy and eggs. Based on Biblical, Talmudic and halachic (Jewish law) sources, Keisar's stance is that veganism is a Torah ideal, and Jews should therefore follow a vegan diet. He argues that although eating meat is permitted, not everything permitted in the Torah should necessarily be done, and the Torah permits eating meat only as a concession, in the same way the Torah permits such antiquated deeds as owning slaves or having relations with a woman outside of marriage during a time of war.Liat Ntobitz-Koschitzky, \\"Shouldn't Get Slaughtered,\\" Israel Hayom, September 13, 2015.

Written by the group's lead vocalist Will Gould and guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Miles, it was produced by Neil Kennedy and featured on the band's 2016 third extended play (EP) The Stranger. A reworked version of the song was later featured on the band's full-length debut Eternity, in Your Arms and released as a music video, and a third version was later issued as a single on 9 June 2017. Composition and lyrics Creeper frontman Will Gould has revealed that \\"Misery\\" was \\"a very hard song to write and sing\\". Crediting American punk rock band The Sidekicks for their song \\"1940's Fighter Jet\\" as inspiration, the vocalist explained that he wrote the song with guitarist and backing vocalist Ian Miles by \\"play[ing] around a load and end[ing] up putting together a song that sounded nothing like the one that sparked the idea\\". Speaking about the lyrics in particular, Gould noted that \\"The lyrical content was some of the most upsetting to write for me. After it was complete though, I felt a release, almost a weight lifted\\". Stereoboard.com's Alec Chillingworth described \\"Misery\\" as \\"an anthem, a singalong arena filler and an ode to its namesake\\". Promotion and release \\"Misery\\" was initially released on the band's third EP The Stranger on 19 February 2016. According to Remfry Dedman of The Independent, the song became \\"an instant favourite\\" among fans, with crowds at the band's live shows often singing back the track's refrain of \\"Misery never goes out of style\\" in a way that \\"was beginning to make them feel uncomfortable\\". Speaking about the phenomenon, Gould commented that \\"I was really concerned that our tag line was becoming 'misery never goes out of style' ... I felt like that wasn‚Äôt the message I wanted to send out and have people take away with them.\\" According to set list aggregation website Setlist.fm, \\"Misery\\" is the band's fourth most-performed song at live shows, behind only \\"VCR\\", \\"The Honeymoon Suite\\" and \\"Black Mass\\". The song was later reworked and featured on the band's debut full-length studio album Eternity, in Your Arms in March 2017, as \\"the only track to make it from [the band's] past through to their present\\". Speaking about their decision to release \\"Misery\\" again, Gould explained that it was done in order to extend the life of the song and allow the band to continue playing it live, due to the worry that \\"the EPs will get lost in time\\". The track's position on the album was chosen intentionally to act as the end of \\"side A\\" on a 12\\" vinyl. Consequently, the more positive \\"I Choose to Live\\" was placed as the final track on the album in an attempt to \\"project a hopeful message rather than something that was hopeless\\". The music video for \\"Misery\\" was released on 30 March 2017, serving as the final part of a trilogy including \\"Hiding with Boys\\" and \\"Black Rain\\" which ties in with the story of Eternity, in Your Arms. Will Richards of DIY magazine explained that the video depicts James Scythe, the subject of the album's story, \\"wandering around the city, with some shots of frontman Will Gould pounding his chest in a car park, for good measure\\", describing it as \\"suitably dramatic\\". On 9 June 2017, a third version of the song was released as a single. Critical reception Reviewing The Stranger for Stereoboard.com, Alec Chillingworth claimed that the last two songs on the EP \\"set the band apart from the pretenders\\", highlighting \\"Misery\\" in particular as \\"an affirmation of Creeper's individuality\\". Chillingworth specifically praised the chorus of the track, proposing that \\"It will surely be their calling card once they slide up festival bills and start playing to audiences more acquainted with their music. It's got one of those sun setting over the field, beer in hand, arm round your mates kind of choruses\\". Ticketmaster writer Jessica Bridgeman called the song \\"a standout track\\" from the EP, praising its \\"breathtaking\\" performance in a review of the band's live show at the Camden Underworld in March 2016. Upon the release of Eternity, in Your Arms, \\"Misery\\" was praised by several critics. Rock Sound writer David McLaughlin claimed that the reworked track is \\"somehow capable of crushing hearts once more with its desolate, devastating melancholy\\", while Jessica Goodman of The Line of Best Fit praised it for being \\"still as stirring as the first time we heard it on ... The Stranger\\". Metal Hammer critic Rob Barbour suggested that \\"the inclusion of the year-old \\"Misery\\" in lieu of another original composition is an odd choice\\", although admitted that \\"it would be churlish to pretend [it doesn't] make sense in the context of the album, or in any way ruin[s] its masterful pacing\\".

It was first broadcast in 2016 and was nominated for the Donald Brittain Award for best social/political documentary program at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards. The film introduces Bob Radke and Ed Chambers, two pedophilic men who openly acknowledge that they experience sexual attractions to children, but state that they have never molested one. They live their lives suppressing their sex drives, but still face being stigmatized and marginalized. Content The film features James Cantor, a neuroscientist and sex researcher who \\"conducted revolutionary research that found a dramatic cross-wiring in the connective tissue (or 'white matter') of pedophiles' brains, in an area related to stimuli and sexual response.\\" Cantor explains his program of research findings in the film, showing how the findings led to the conclusion that pedophilia is in the brain and that those brain differences were likely present before birth. He states, \\"The day before somebody gives in to his sexual interest in children, he was a person who was struggling with his sexual interests in children, and that's the day we failed him.\\" Director Matt Campea described in an interview what drew him to this topic for a documentary: \\"They have this secret that festers inside them that they can't talk to anyone about. That's a dark place.\\" He continued, \\"We're at a moment in time here. If somebody is born with something they can't control, we shouldn't condemn them. We should extend a compassionate hand and give them the resources they need to lead a virtuous, dignified life.\\" Release and reception I, Pedophile premiered on CBC Television's Firsthand documentary series to positive reviews. The Toronto Star wrote that the film was \\"so riveting and enlightening, you can't stop watching it.\\" The film was nominated by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television for Best Social/Political Documentary Program (the Donald Brittain Award) at the 5th Canadian Screen Awards.

Plot After attacking Mutsumi headquarters with a tank, Takashi and his rescued wife Mariko hide out with Mr. Shao in Chinatown while Hideshi continues to seek out Takeshi. Hideshi finds Takeshi working in an alligator costume selling balloons. Rie wanted him to get a legitimate job and they are staying at a church down the road from where she grew up in a geisha house run by her father. Rie spends her time caring for a friend from high school who has been hospitalized since being injured in an automobile accident while Rie was driving. Rie's mother died and she does not get along with her step-mother Chiharu Ishibashi, who runs the geisha house alone now that Rie's father has also died. Chiharu feels that Rie blames her for her father's death so she angrily sells information about her daughter-in-law's location to Kenmochi's men for 20 million yen. Takeshi visits his mother Haruko in the care home, where she calls him Iwaida in confusion and reveals that she became pregnant with Iwaida's son and chose to raise him as Takeshi. Hideshi confirms this story when Takeshi visits him but wonders why Mr. Nishiwaki would choose to have Takeshi kill Iwaida if he knew that Iwaida was Takeshi's father. Kenmochi's men arrive at the church but Chiharu has a change of heart and jumps between them and Rie, subsequently dying from gunshot wounds. Hideshi grabs Rie while Takeshi quickly shoots all of Kenmochi's men. Hideshi returns home to his wife and daughter Natsumi in Yokohama. Officer Shiraki from the Yamashita Police Department visits Hideshi and tells him that Yamaguchi from the Hyogo Police Department wants his help solving the Iwaida murder in Kyoto. Shiraki knows that the hitman is Lightning Takeshi, that is to say Takeshi Miwa, Hideshi's younger brother, and has been told by Yamaguchi to keep an eye on the Miwa house. He also wants to find Hideshi's other brother Takashi because of the murder of Kenmochi's man when they rescued Mariko. Hideshi pays off the cop and tells him to release the pastor they've been questioning from the church shooting. He sends Shiraki to investigate Kenmochi, the acting head of the Mutsumi Group, and his involvement with the incident. Hideshi moves Takeshi and Rie to a dojo but Takeshi does not trust Mr. Maki, the head of the dojo. Hideshi's secretary Tono explains that Mr. Maki took Hideshi in and mentored him after he killed the man who killed his father. As he learned karate from Mr. Maki his heart was slowly healed. Tono accompanies Hideshi, his wife, and his daughter Nastumi on a boat ride where they are attacked by three men on personal watercraft. The men circle the boat and shoot their guns into it but do not kill anyone. Hisako offers herself to Hideshi once again in a move to combine forces in order to gain influence with Mr. Nishiwaki and push Omaeda out of power but Hideshi rejects her again. Hideshi is informed by Shiraki that Kenmochi is trying to blackmail Nishiwaki using information that Iwaidi knew which led to his killing. Haruko commits suicide and the three brothers go to her wake together. They honor her last wish to have them bring her ashes back to the family home. Several armed men attack the home and end up killing Takashi. Mariko grieves heavily. Hideshi asks Hisako to get the information from Omaeda. She has one of her dominatrices torture Omaeda until he passes out but he does not speak so they inject him with drugs to get him to talk. He admits that Nishiwaki sold information about the underworld to GHQ during the six years that the occupation forces remained in Japan after the war and it was only through this connection that he could amass his fortune and gain as much influence as he did. GHQ disappeared along with any documents about these activities so only Nishiwaki's henchman Omaeda, Iwaida, and Iwaida's lover Haruko knew about Nishiwaki's actions after the war that would cause him to lose power in the underworld if they were exposed. Hideshi calls Nishiwaki and asks him to go with him to the Philippines to carry out the deal for the counterfeit money. In Manila Nishiwaki has the brothers attacked by a shooter from a helicopter and armed guerrillas on the beach. Nishiwaki offers Hisako the Number 2 position but she reveals that she has higher ambitions as Hideshi and Takeshi arrive to kill Nishiwaki.

Starting Operations In 1359 Florence reacted to extortion threats by the Great Company under Konrad von Landau by assembling an army, with the help of Padua, Milan, Ferrara, and Naples, to oppose them. The Great Company had 500 cavalry and 1,000 Hungarian foot soldiers whilst the Florentine forces under the command of Pandolfo Malatesta numbered 3,000 cavalry, 500 Hungarians, and 2,500 archers. The battle The Company troops established themselves in a defended position at Campo delle Mosche. But after being besieged by Malatesta for several days with no food or water they broke up and fled.

It pictures a young Mao Zedong as one of the common people, ready to take on any obstacle that comes forth. This artwork is a strong example of Chinese communist propaganda and shows the devotion which their culture had to Chairman Mao.  Function  This artwork served as propaganda during the Cultural Revolution (1967-1976). During the earlier years of the Cultural Revolution, Liu Chunhua turned to social realism for creating portraits of Mao Zedong. This method allowed for intelligible subjects and emotionally moving themes that targeted the working class. Chairman Mao aimed to regain his hold after political struggles within his party, and this work focused on the concern of Chairman Mao and the communist party as a way to show the people his goals.  Context  In 1922 an event called The Anyuan Miners' Strike of 1922 occurred. This event was a defining moment for the Chinese Communist Party because the miners' represented the suffering masses that were the focus of the revolution. After the nonviolent strike of thirteen thousand workers, a majority of the miners enlisted as soldiers in the Red Army to support Mao and the Revolution. Nearly half a century later Mao was stuck attempting to correct political fallout from the disasters of the 1950s, including the Great Leap Forward of 1958-1961 . The Great Leap Forward was an attempt to modernize China and transform it from an agrarian economy to an industrialized, socialist society. His party had to reinvigorate communist ideology as a whole. For many years, Mao led China through a time of violent class struggles against traditional customs and capitalism.  Artistic decision making  In order for Liu Chunhua to create this artwork he studied old photographs and interview workers from Anyuan to ensure visual accuracy. He chose to place Mao in traditional Chinese dress opposed to common wear, as this was normal in portraits of him during the Cultural Revolution. An unusual aspect of Chunhua's work is the cool color tones he uses. Warm tones and vibrant red accents were often used in his paintings, however in order to emphasize Mao's determination he chose to use deep blue and purple accents. Chunhua's alterations of the traditional Chinese landscape suggests that he fully capable of leading the country and that he was almost above the world while still remaining practical.  Liu Chunhua  Liu Chunhua was born in Tailai, Heilongjiang Province in 1944. He spent a majority of his childhood focused on art, he attended the Lu Xun Art Academy in Shenyang starting in 1959. In 1963 he entered the Central Academy of Fine Arts where he painted Chairman Mao en route to Anyuan, which has now been reproduced over 900 million times. After his graduation he worked as an editor at the Beijing Publishing House before he joined the Beijing Academy. In 1988, his painting was declared a cultural relic. Chunhua specializes in oil painting and Chinese painting.  References  *Chiem, Kristen. Liu Chunhua, Chairman Mao en Route to Anyuan. Khan Academy. Retrieved 27 March 2017. *Chiu, Melissa.

Christine takes the job and becomes interested in the movies that are playing. Her boyfriend Mark, an investigative journalist, is concerned and confused about her interest in her new job. At the Variety, Christine meets a rich patron, Louie, with whom she spontaneously decides to go on a date. After he abruptly leaves, she follows him in a cab, watching while he meets a mysterious man. Later, she shares her suspicions with Mark that he is involved in some kind of mafia operation. Increasingly obsessed, she follows Louie to Asbury Park, New Jersey, sneaking into his hotel room, from which she steals a pornographic magazine.

His father, Ray, was an esteemed architect and founder of the Montreal- based architectural firm Arcop, which was famous for designing many iconic buildings in Montreal, including Place Bonaventure and Place Ville-Marie. Growing up in an architect's household, especially at a time when his father's firm was so involved with shaping the cityscape of Montreal, Affleck got an inside look at the practice from a younger age than most. For his sixth birthday, Affleck \\"was given the working model for Place Bonaventure\\" which subsequently got demolished in the basement of a house with four boys in it, including animator Neil Affleck. Affleck has said that this showed him \\"how a building was put together by taking it apart.\\" In 1980, Affleck began studies at McGill University's School of Architecture and graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Architecture in 1984 and Bachelor of Architecture in 1985. After interning at Jodoin, Lamarre, Pratte et associ√©s architectes (1986‚Äì88) and at Arcop (1988‚Äì89), Affleck set up his own practice.\\"Nominations: Affleck Gavin.\\" Province of Quebec. Web.

He won the Louisiana-bred Horse of the Year title 4 times, as well as the state's Champion Older Horse three times and the Champion Two Year Old Colt award. He retired as the richest Louisiana-bred horse of all time with earnings of $1.75 million. Background Star Guitar is a light bay stallion by Champion sire Quiet American, who also sired Triple Crown near miss Real Quiet, as well as Quiet Dance who produced, successful sire Horse of the Year and Breeders Cup Classic winner Saint Liam. His Dam was Minit Towinit who was a Louisiana bred stakes winner who ended her career running in claiming races. Two-year-old-season Star Guitar waited a little longer than most two-year- olds to race. He only had two races that year. First was his debut race at the Fair Grounds. He stayed near the leaders and saved his big move until they were nearing the far turn. Then he made a very sharp move at the far turn causing the jockey of the second-place finisher to lose his whip. In the end Star Guitar drew off to win by 6 3/4 lengths. The race was so impressive that in his next start he ran in the Louisiana Champions Day Juvenile Stakes. This time he was restrained early and was eighth at the start of the race after a bit he was let go and went 4 wide and slowly but surely pulled away to win by 1/2 length. His 2007 performances would earn Star Guitar the award for Louisiana Champion Two-Year-Old Horse. Three-year-old-season Star Guitar had a nine-month break from racing before he returned in a 2008 allowance race. He started fifth and then went wide to be third but never got to catch up to the leaders and finished third. Finally in his second attempt he managed a to win by being just behind the leaders and then easily drew off to win by three lengths. Next he went for his second Louisiana Champions Day Sprint Stakes. When the race started he was undeterred and stayed behind in eighth but only moved up to fifth at the far turn but galloped by everyone to win by 3/4 of a length. Four-year-old-season Unlike before, Star Guitar cut to the chase when it came to winning his first race as a four-year-old. On January 3, 2009 he ran in the Dixie Poker Ace Stakes. At the start he settled in on the rail for the majority of race staying in third but dropping back to fourth but back to third being four lengths behind at the final turn. But soon ran by everyone to win by a comformatle length. After that, one potential idea of his handlers was for a graded stakes race that was unrestricted. However, before he could do that he took another win in the Premier Night Championship Stakes by seven lengths. Next were a pair of graded stakes attempts in the New Orleans Handicap and the Alysheba Stakes. Both were failures with third and seventh-place finishes. Soon after he ran in the Pola Benoit Memorial Stakes in which he stayed in second for most of the race and then took over the lead in the stretch and cantered home. In his next start, Star Guitar won the Louisiana Cup Turf Classic Stakes. Two weeks later he won the Evangeline Handicap. The colt's next move was the Gold Cup Stakes at Delta Downs in which he was given top weight of 125 pounds. At the start he was seventh and second to last. Soon he covered ground and took over the lead by a length and at the finish opened up to a two-length victory at the wire. Following his big winning streak he then made one last race before the year ended. It was the Louisiana Champions Day Classic Stakes. At the start of the race Star Guitar settled in on the rail and at the far turn opened up five lengths which opened up to seven and 3/4 lengths. With all of these wins in one year Star Guitar was awarded his first Louisiana-bred Horse of the Year and Champion Older Horse. Five-year-old-season Star Guitar began the 2010 racing season with a repeat win in the Premier Night Championship Stakes. His first big winning streak ended when he finished fourth in the New Orleans Handicap and in the Texas Mile. Following that he never returned to graded stakes race competition again. After that he won the Evangeline Handicap and the Louisiana Showcase Classic. Returning to compete Delta Downs Gold Cup, he finished in fourth place. Following his defeat he returned to the winner's circle in the Louisiana Champions Day Classic Stakes. For the most part he was in second place before taking over the lead at the turn and winning by 1/4 length. Six and seven-year-old-season Following his five year old season Star Guitar never lost again in his career. Some of his best highlights included his third and fourth wins in the Premier Night Championship Stakes, as well as his third career win in the Evangeline Handicap. After winning nine races in a row he was about to finish his career with one final race, the Louisiana Legends Classic Stakes. Starting off he settled back in third, but he began to slip back to forth. By the far turn he began to come back being only two lengths behind. Finally he galloped away winning by 3/4 of a length and breaking the track record at the time. Post racing career After racing he went to become a sire at Clear Creek stud. He has been able to produce winning foals such as black type winners Givemeaminit, Testing One Two and Grade 2 Honorable Miss Stakes Winner Mintit to Stardom. In 2013 Star Guitar was inducted into the Fair Grounds Racing Hall of Fame.

The syndrome appears to be more frequently experienced by men. The term was coined in 1994 on the online question-and-answer newspaper column The Straight Dope, when a user enquired about the phenomenon.  Explanation  There has yet to be any peer-reviewed research on the topic. The most plausible theory is that the shiver is a result of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) getting its signals mixed up between its two main divisions: *The sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which controls bladder function, preventing urination. *The parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) relaxes the urethral sphincter and contracts the bladder, causing urination. Part of the SNS response to a full bladder is the release of catecholamines (including epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine), which are dispatched to help restore or maintain blood pressure. When urination begins, the PNS takes over, and catecholamine production changes. It may be the change in chemical production which causes the shiver, or the switch from SNS to PNS itself which is the cause.

Rieger (11/4/2009) Federal Constitutional Court of Germany: Does a criminal code against the approving, glorifying or justifying of the National Socialist Party violate the right to freedom of expression guaranteed in the Basic law of Germany? And if so, is the violation done so in a way that is constitutional according to the rules laid out in Basic Law? Brief Summary of Court Set Up Jurisdiction of this Court solely focuses on constitutional issues, therefore it possesses the power of judicial review. It is comprised two Senates with 8 members that serve 12 year terms. Each senate has a leader, and he/she plus 3 members of each senate hear every case. Meaning cases have a total of 8 judges deciding. Decisions within the Court must be unanimous, except in rare occasions. Members must be at least 40 years of age and must retire upon reaching the age of 68. Each member is elected by the two legislative bodies (Bundestag and Bundesrat) of Germany. Facts Starting in 2001 an event in the honor of a prominent Nazi political figure was created and to be celebrated annually. This event was a gathering of neo-Nazi organizations and right-wing members of Germany's Democratic Party to pay tribute to Rudolf Hess, a prominent political figure in the Nazi Regime. The gathering took place in the city in which Hess is buried (Wunsiedel) and brought together upwards of 5000 people. In 2004 an amendment to the Criminal Code took place that was used to prohibit the further advancement of this gathering. The amendment itself prohibits the disturbing of peace through the approving, glorifying, justifying of the National Socialist rule whether publicly or in an assembly. Thus in 2005 the gathering for this event was banned on the grounds that it was a significant disturbance to the peace and provided a danger to public security. Law(s) in Question: Article 5 of the Basic Law: 1\\\\. Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures, and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by mean of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship. 2\\\\. These rights shall find their limits in the provisions of general laws, in provisions for the protection of young persons, and in the right to personal honor.... ¬ß 130(4) of the Criminal Code: Any person who, publicly or in an assembly, disturbs the public peace by approving, glorifying or justifying the National Socialist rule of violence and arbitrariness in a manner violating the dignity of the victims shall be punished with imprisonment for up to three years or a fine. The focus of this case reflects upon the restriction of rights through the means of the provision of general law, as the law provided through ¬ß 130(4) of the Criminal Code would fall under the category of a general law, as opposed to a protection of the youth or the right to personal honor. Judicial background Multiple courts dismissed lawsuits of behalf of the complainant, including: the Administrative Court of Bayreuth, the Bavarian Administrative Court and the Federal Administrative Court of Germany. On August 6, 2008 Rieger filed suit with the Federal Constitutional Court on the grounds that his constitutional right of freedom of expression was violated. While the Court rejected multiple files for injunction, it gave a decision on November 4, 2009. Arguments J√ºrgen Rieger brought this constitutional complaint to the Court. He is a lawyer, a neo-nazi, and the main organizer behind these events in honor of Hess. Riegers's main argument was that his free speech was violated in a way that was not constitutional. The amendment to the criminal code could not be categorized as any of the possible avenues laid out in the Basic Law for a limitation on free speech. The main process he seeks to eliminate, as it is the most probable category the law would fall under, is the classification of a general law. He argues that the specificity of this law targeting only the National Socialist Party immediately disqualifies it as a general law. Rieger cites communism as another threat to German Democracy but the law does not ban material on that matter. He even goes further to say that even if the new law is deemed constitutional it does not even apply in this case. Honoring a martyr does not constitute approving, glorifying, or justifying the National Socialist Party. Events celebrating Hess have already occurred without the mentioning of the persecution carried out by the Nazis, and he ensured further events would also stray away from making comments on that subject matter. Decision It is important to make note that Rieger (the complainant) died a week before the Court delivered the decision. In normal circumstances a constitutional complaint dies with its complainant, but there are exceptions to that rule and this case fell under one. Amongst several principles, the most important was that the implications of the decision of this case were significant to a large portion of German citizens. The specific rally cited in this case brought together anywhere from 1000 to 5000 supporters (4), thus the ruling would minimally effect all of those people. The Court did find that the section of the Criminal Code provided did in fact hinder one's freedom of expression. As the right guarantees even the most ‚Äúworthless‚Äù or ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù opinions. However, they found that this specific limitation was justified. They determined that the law itself fails to qualify as general law as its scope and aim are specific to the National Socialist party. Compared to a law that limits political expression regardless one's opinions or where they fall on the ideological scale. However, the Court states that the protection of the public peace is solid grounds for justifying a limit on the freedom of expression. And while this section of the Criminal Code does not qualify as a general law, the historical significance of injustice provided during the reign of the Third Reich provided an exception to this rule. Reaction Within the small town itself there was a wave of relief. Many people would leave town during that August week or board up their homes if they chose to stay. Thus this decision was a welcome one within their community. Politically there were opinions on both sides of the matter. While figures did not go as far as to align themselves with the Nationalist party, some saw this as an unnecessary restriction to free speech. A left wing journalist stated that enough time had passed not only since the events surrounding the matter, but since Germany had set up a democracy for this material to be banned. Also stated was that this created a minority of people within the country whose speech was being suppressed therefore creating an unequal distribution of freedom of expression. However, others like Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann welcomed the decision as another successful move to end the Nationalist movement. Subsequent development in Germany While the National Socialist Party associated with the Third Reich was banned from political participation in 1952, the National Democratic Party of Germany has developed in the past decade and represents similar far-right anti- semantic ideals. However, in early 2017 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled against banning the political party. Citing its waning popularity, and virtually non-existent political power, as a lack of necessity to ban the party. Effectively stating the party lacks the means to achieve its anti-constitutional goals, and is thus not a threat to German democracy. Nazi speech in other courts  In the United States the pivotal case involving National Socialist Party occurred in 1977. In Nationalist Socialist Party v. Village of Skokie the Supreme Court of the Illinois declared the symbol of the swastika to be protected under the First Amendment, which permitted further advances of the party within the US including a planned march in the town of Skokie. In its decision the Court specifically stated that the swastika, and other nazi memorabilia, do not constitute ‚Äúfighting words‚Äù, a term coined by Justice Murphy in the landmark free speech case Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire. This made a clear statement of the Court's protection of free speech involving the NSP, considering the fact that the town of Skokie had a large population of Holocaust survivors. This case was cited by Justice O‚ÄôConnor in 2003 when she gave the majority opinion in Virginia v. Black which dealt with KKK member's ritual of burning a cross. Skokie was cited reiterate the fact that the Court holds a robust interpretation of the first amendment that even protects hateful speech. Within Europe there has been a much more limited scope of freedom of expression concerning the National Socialist Party. Six European nations, and even Brazil, have outright banned the use of Nazi symbols, like the swastika or the flying of Nazi related flags. Several cases have come before the European Court of Human Rights, including Garaudy v. France and Honsik v. Austria, dealing with the denial of certain events of the Holocaust. The ECHR in both cases declared the denial of the Holocaust, or certain events/methods that occurred in the duration of, to be unprotected by the freedom of expression. The ECHR categorized the denial of such events as hate speech and propaganda for the National Socialist Party, and made clear no such speech would be protected. The decision in Garaudy was cited more recently by the ECHR in Perincek v. Switzerland, which involved a man denying the events of the Armenian Genocide. However, this time the Court ruled in favor of the complainant who called into question the events of the Armenian Genocide. It was determined by the Grand Chamber (the ultimate appeal court of the ECHR) that the nature of the speech was not aimed to promote hatred towards the Armenian people through the justification of genocide, but rather called into question whether the events could be categorized as genocide. It must be noted that this decision was not unanimous and dissenting opinions were put forward that saw this speeches intent to insult the victims and felt it should be categorized as unprotected hate speech.

It is found in southeastern Bolivia and Brazil, Paraguay to Argentina and Uruguay. It is recognized as a species by some taxonomic authorities, including the International Ornithologists' Union. Others still consider it to be a subspecies of the vermilion flycatcher. Taxonomy The scarlet flycatcher was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Muscicapa rubinus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The type locality was restricted to Tef√© on the Amazon River by the American ornithologist John T. Zimmer in 1941. The scarlet flycatcher is now placed in the genus Pyrocephalus that was introduced in 1839 by the English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould. The species is monotypic. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek purrhos meaning \\"flame-coloured\\" or \\"red\\" and -kephalos meaning \\"-headed\\". The specific epithet rubinus is Medieval Latin for \\"ruby-coloured\\". The scarlet flycatcher was formerly considered to be conspecific with the vermilion flycatcher (Pyrocephalus obscurus). The species were split based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016.  Description  The scarlet flycatcher appears very similar to the vermilion flycatcher, but can be distinguished by its pointier wings. Their songs are also quite distinctive. Their range and breeding times do not generally overlap with the vermilion flycatcher.

He served as a Deputy Attorney General for Georgia from 1955 to 1961. Early life Johnson was the son of J.D. and Jimmie Johnson. He was born in Carroll County, Georgia but grew up in Atlanta. He graduated from Atlanta Boys High School in 1932. He began attending attended Emory University on a scholarship but that ended with the start of the Great Depression. With the loss of the scholarship he transferred to what was then known as the Georgia Institute of Technology's Evening School of Commerce before graduating from the University of Georgia in 1937. While attending Emory he became a member of Sigma Pi fraternity. He was accepted into Harvard Law School but chose to stay near home and attend Emory Law School because of his father's poor health. While working on his law degree, he became a member of Phi Delta Phi legal honor society and started a Big Brother mentoring program pairing first year law students with older students. The program had the backing of the Emory administration. In 1939 he received his J.D. degree and finished first in his class. He began practicing law in Atlanta after graduation. That year he also married his wife, Stella Darnell. They would have two sons, Ben F. Johnson III and Sherman D. Johnson. Early career In 1943, Johnson enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he served as a naval intelligence officer in the Pacific during World War II. After the war, Johnson received his LL.D. degree from the Duke University School of Law. In 1949 he became a faculty member of Emory Law School. He served as Deputy Attorney General for the State of Georgia from 1955 to 1961 where he appeared in over thirty cases in front of the Supreme Court of Georgia. He also argued tax cases in front of the United States Supreme Court. During this time he served on a congressional advisory committee to study taxation of interstate commerce. Georgia Senate In 1962 he was elected to the Georgia State Senate from DeKalb County and served there until 1969. During that time he was chair of the Banking and Finance committee, vice chair of the Judiciary committee, secretary of the Committee on Reorganization and Efficiency in Government, and a member of the Appropriations committee. From 1963 to 1964 he served on the state's Constitutional Revision Commission. As a senator, his largest accomplishment was writing the constitutional amendment that permitted the creation of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA). Dean of Emory University School of Law =Integration= Johnson was named the fourth Dean of the Emory Law School in 1961. In 1962 he served as co- counsel with Henry Bowden (Emory Law School's Chairman of the Board of Trustees) for the school's lawsuit to permit racial integration. The case of Emory University v. Nash, successfully challenged Georgia's law that denied state tax exemptions to integrated private schools. The result opened the way for Emory and other private schools to admit minorities without imperiling their tax-exempt status. From 1966 to 1972 Emory Law School ran a program called Pre-Start. The program was an affirmative action program that focused on Johnson's integration initiative for the school. =Educational philosophy= Johnson was focused on educational opportunities for those who were not wealthy or whose family circumstances wouldn't allow for a full-time college attendance. As someone who had worked his way through college during the Great Depression, he earned an early appreciation for flexible, part-time education. In 1967, Johnson opened the Emory Community Legal Services Center to provide a neighborhood law office staffed by supervised law students. Aside from providing legal services for the poor, the center drafted legislation, carried out test cases, and recruited students who were interested in providing legal services to the poor. In the early 1970s, Johnson was forced to close the part-time student program at Emory Law School which some thought was needed to enhance the reputation of the school. This was a step Johnson knew would hurt many part-time students. He stepped down from the dean's position in 1973 and re-entered the classroom as a teacher until 1981. During his tenure as dean, the enrollment and budget of the school grew by five times what it had been when he took the position. As a teacher, he was known to be competent in both the academic and practical aspects of the law. Dean of the Georgia State University College of Law In 1981, Johnson was invited by Georgia State University President Noah Langdale and Vice President William Suttles to become the founding dean of the university's new law school. All three knew that a law school at GSU would make possible the return of part- time legal education to the Atlanta area. Johnson served as dean from 1981 to 1985. When he retired he had recruited faculty, admitted the first students, and secured provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association. The school began offering its first classes in the fall of 1982. Other activities Johnson was active in the Southern Baptist Druid Hills Baptist Church where he was a Sunday School teacher for fifty years. He was also a Rotarian. References External Links * Ben F.

Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), is a United States Supreme Court decision regarding political speech of public employees.. The Court ruled in this case that federal employees may be active members in a political party, but cannot allow patronage to be a deciding factor in work related decisions. The court upheld the decision by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the respondent.  Background  Richard J. Elrod was elected Cook County, Ill. Sheriff. As a Democrat, he dismissed four non-civil service employees. John Burns and the other dismissed employees claimed it was on the grounds that they were members of the Republican Party. The previous sheriff, a Republican, had hired them all. Burns and other former employees claimed discrimination due to their affiliation, or lack of affiliation, to a particular political party. The Cook County Sheriff's Office had a tradition of operating under the partisan spoils system.  Constitutional Question  The constitutional question is if the firing of Burns and the other respondents was in violation of the Hatch Act and within the jurisdiction of First Amendment accepted free speech by a public employee. The court was deciding whether these statues should apply to public, non-federal employees.  Decision  Justice Brennan wrote the decision affirming the 7th Circuit Court decision. The opinion stated that the Republican employees were denied a civil liberty by losing jobs due to political affiliation. ‚ÄúPatronage dismissals severely restrict political belief and association, which constitute the core of those activities protected by the First Amendment, and government may not, without seriously inhibiting First Amendment rights, force a public employee to relinquish his right to political association as the price of holding a public job‚Äù ‚Äì Justice Brennan Justice Stewart wrote a concurring decision, highlighting that non-policymaking officials cannot be fired on the basis of political affiliation or belief. The decision upheld the belief that the ‚Äòspoils system‚Äô is unconstitutional through first amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court protected the rights of employees by giving further allowance of free speech by public employees. The decision deemed that the firing of non- policymaking, public employees was unconstitutional, it did not touch on the topic of hiring or promotion. The decision built off Keyishian v. Board of Regents (1967) that deemed it illegal for public employees to be fired for being members of the Communist Party..  Dissent  Justice Powell wrote a dissent claiming that half of the employees in the Cook County, Ill. Sheriff's Office are merit based and are protected from being fired by a new administration. The other half of employees, which Burns was a part of, were hired based on principles decided by the previous sheriff, a Republican. The non-merit employees were hired on basis of patronage and they should be able to be fired on the basis of patronage. The dissent claims that partisan politics at the state level are necessary for the political system to evolve. ‚ÄúThe Court holds unconstitutional a practice as old as the Republic, a practice which has contributed significantly to the democratization of American politics.‚Äù ‚Äì Justice Powell Justice Powell goes on to cite the removal of political opponents from roles by founding fathers, such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and their successors.  The Hatch Act  Congress passed the Hatch Act, or the Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities, in 1939. It prevents many federal employees from participating in certain partisan activities.. Specifically, it prohibits campaign activities by federal employees. In an earlier Supreme Court ruling Justices Marshall and Brennan signed on to an opinion in 1973 stating. \\"It is no concern of government what an employee does in his or her spare time, whether religion, recreation, social work or politics is his hobby, unless what he or she does impairs efficiency or other facets of the merits of his job.\\" ‚Äì Mr. Justice Douglas The court had deemed this as a balance between not restricting speech and making sure that public employees do not over step the boundaries of the office due to political affiliation. The 14th Amendment states that all constitutional rights and laws are to be enforced at the state level.  Subsequent Cases  In Rutan v. Republican Party of Illinois (1990), the state of Illinois put a hiring freeze on public employees without permission from the governor. The new employees being hired were all members of the Republican Party. The court decided in favor of the petitioner adding the Elrod v. Burns ruling that nonpolicymaking government employees cannot be hired based on political patronage.. Heffernan v. City of Paterson (2016) was a similar case that took into consideration partisan acts but a member of the Paterson, NJ police force. Jeffery Heffernan was seen carrying a campaign sign to a sick parent. As a result of being seen with the sign, he was demoted for public engagement of political activities. The court overturned that decision claiming that he was acting under protected speech. Following the Elrod v. Burns decision, the court has stayed with the sentiment that the free speech rights of government employees is protected when they are in non-policymaking or traditionally partisan roles.

They compiled their report and sent it to the U.S. Department of Justice, which assigned a special prosecutor who had relations with a lawyer employed by Firestone, which also helmed the private investigation that Ford had initiated. The special prosecutor charged Newberry of violating the Federal Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which barred candidates for the Senate from spending more than $10,000 during their campaign. Newberry, having spent at least $100,000 during the Republican primary, would be tried and convicted in 1921. However, Newberry would successfully appeal his conviction to the Supreme Court, who ruled in a 5-4 decision that the FCPA was unconstitutional in Newberry v. United States. Newberry was allowed to retain his seat, though faced a condemnation by the Senate for his excess spending. Newberry ultimately resigned in 1922 and was succeeded by James J.

Rice and Menken developed the concept in 2007 during the first discussions about a remake. Performed by Adam Mitchell, Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Emma Watson, Audra McDonald, and Clive Rowe, \\"Days in the Sun\\" is one of four songs added to the 2017 film. It was released on March 10, 2017, as part of the film's soundtrack. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is prominently featured in a flashback sequence about the death of the Beast's mother. In the lyrics, the Beast's servants and Belle reminisce about earlier parts of their lives. Serving as a replacement of the song \\"Human Again\\" from the stage adaptation of the original Disney film, it was regarded as a more sombre expression of the subject matter by music critics. An alternative version of \\"Days in the Sun\\", in which the Beast's mother sings a verse, was made available on the Blu-ray release; it was changed after a test audience confused Harriet Jones with Hattie Morahan, who played the mother and Agathe, respectively. Critical response to \\"Days in the Sun\\" was mixed; some critics praised its content while others questioned whether it was a necessary addition.  Background and release  alt=An image of Alan Menkin speaking into a microphone. In 2007, composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice developed the concept for \\"Days in the Sun\\" during early discussions about a possible live-action adaptation of Disney's 1991 animated film Beauty and the Beast. They wrote it during a meeting in London where Menken attended the West End opening for his musical Sister Act. Menken described the song as a lullaby that explores Belle, Beast, and his servants' memories of earlier parts of their lives; Rice approved of the idea as a way of expanding the characters' backgrounds and emphasizing their emotional connection with the audience. When describing his creative process, Menken said he prefers to conduct collaborations in-person; he said: \\"I prefer to write face to face in the room, I want the feedback, where‚Äôs the title, the exposition, the architecture of the song.\\" Menken produced the song while collaborating with Rice on the songwriting. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is one of four songs introduced in the 2017 live-action adaptation Beauty and the Beast; the others are \\"Evermore\\", \\"Aria\\", and \\"How Does a Moment Last Forever\\". Menken said he only wanted to create more material for the remake if \\"it fe[lt] organic to the medium\\". David Hoberman, who produced the 2017 film, thought \\"Days in the Sun\\" would earn Menken his ninth Academy Award for Best Original Song. A preview of \\"Days in the Sun\\" was released on February 17, 2017, along with a portion of Emma Thompson's performance of the 1991 song \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". \\"Days in the Sun\\" was considered for release as a single but director Bill Condon did not feel it \\"len[t] itself to the process\\". A version of \\"Evermore\\" performed by Josh Groban was ultimately chosen as a single. Before the film's debut and the soundtrack's release, a series of nail polishes was released; a yellow nail polish was named after the song. \\"Days in the Sun\\" was released on March 10, 2017, as a track on the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack; it was made available as an audio CD and a digital download. It is performed by Adam Mitchell as the young Beast, Emma Watson as Belle, and Stanley Tucci, Ewan McGregor, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson, Audra McDonald, and Clive Rowe as the Beast's enchanted servants.  Context and composition  \\"Days in the Sun\\" is played three times during the film. It is first heard performed by Audra McDonald as part of a debutante ball. Director Bill Condon identified it as a lullaby the Beast's mother sang for him and said the court had chosen its most celebrated diva to appeal to the Beast. The song, which Menken called \\"a combination of a lullaby and a remembrance of happier days for everybody\\", is performed again by Belle and the servants as they go to bed. Its opening lyrics explores the Beast's childhood. In the scene, the young Prince‚Äîbefore he becomes the Beast‚Äîsings \\"Days in the Sun\\" for his dying mother. The lyrics include the lines: \\"Days in the sun / When my life has barely begun / Not until my whole life is done / Will I ever leave you\\". The song progresses to his servants discussing what they miss about their lives as humans, and their guilt for not preventing the Beast from being spoiled and eventually cursed. Watson's solo contains a reference to the song \\"A Change in Me\\", which was written for the stage adaptation of the original Disney film, and its related themes. \\"Days in the Sun\\" was also performed as part of a Disney Dream stage production. \\"Days in the Sun\\" replaces the musical theatre version's song \\"Human Again\\", and various critics noted that the new addition was more melancholy in comparison. Santa Cruz Sentinels Bob Strauss called it \\"a melancholy remembrance of freer and/or more human past\\". \\"Days in the Sun\\" is performed in common-time at a slow tempo of 110 beats per minute, and composed in the key of B-flat major. Seven people perform the song, while its instrumental is provided by a guitar and a piano. One singer's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of G5. = Alternative version and sequence = The Blu-ray release of the film includes another version of the song, in which the Beast's mother sings to him. In this version, a sequence showing the Beast's mother singing to her sick child would have been intercut with one of the young Beast singing to his dying mother. The scene and song were changed for the final version because a test audience confused the mother with Agathe. In the original take, the mother was portrayed by Harriet Jones and Agathe by Hattie Morahan. Condon said the changes were a result of his \\"mistake\\". He said: \\"The actresses actually look very much alike, so, sadly when we did it again, even though it is once again Harriet, we had to put her in bed and with dark hair.\\" Jones was retained in the film but Condon had the character portrayed as a brunette to avoid confusion. The actor portraying the young Beast was changed because Condon required the part to be sung.  Critical reception  Critics responded positively to \\"Days in the Sun\\" for its contributions to the character development for Belle and the Beast. Estelle Tang of Elle praised the song as a \\"tearjerker\\", and Refinery29's Arianna Davis called it \\"cute and bubbly\\". Keisha Hatchett of The Mary Sue commended \\"Days in the Sun\\" for revealing the similarities of Belle's and the Beast's family backgrounds. Hatchett wrote that their shared understanding of \\"know[ing] what it‚Äôs like to lose a mother at a young age and feel[ing] like a freak among their peers\\" made the characters' romance more understandable for the audience. James Croot of Stuff.co.nz praised the track for \\"enhanc[ing] the story and allow[ing] the Beast a bit more voice in proceedings\\". Several critics responded negatively to \\"Days in the Sun\\". Crystal Bell cited it as her least favorite of the new additions to the 2017 adaptation. Bell described it as Watson's best vocal performance in the film, but wrote that the idea of the actress harmonizing with McDonald as laughable. She also praised Mbatha-Raw's vocals and felt the singer deserved her own solo. Sarah Caldwell of Vulture.com said that \\"Days in the Sun\\" and \\"Aria\\" were created primarily as excuses to provide more material for McDonald. IGN's Eric Goldman criticized \\"Days in the Sun\\" and \\"Evermore\\" as \\"uninspired and hard to recall after the fact\\".

In 1927 the Cairns Brewery Company ran out of money and a new company, Northern Australian Breweries was formed to take over and continue its affairs under the supervision of Captain Auguste de Bavay. It is a curious feature of the Queensland brewing industry that a great many more of its early brewers and beer entrepreneurs came from distant Victoria than from neighbouring New South Wales.http://www.brewsnews.com.au/2010/11/cub-in-queensland/. The brewery produced a beer called Cairns Draught. The brewery was acquired by CUB in 1931 and was CUB's first brewery operating in Queensland. The Cairns brewery closed down in 1992. In 2010 CUB announced a new brand of beer, Great Northern Brewing Co. Great Northern is named after CUB‚Äôs first brewery in the state. It revives the classic marlin logo of the discontinued Cairns Draught. In the bottles the full strength 'original' style beers are identifiable by the Gold coloured bottle top and a White coloured Marlin fish on its label whereas the mid strength has a Silver coloured bottle cap with a Black Marlin on the label.
