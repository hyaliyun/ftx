This family of strong-form collocation methods is designed to avoid singular numerical integration and mesh generation in the traditional boundary element method (BEM) in the numerical solution of boundary value problems with boundary nodes, in which a fundamental solution of the governing equation is explicitly known. The salient feature of the SBM is to overcome the fictitious boundary in the method of fundamental solution, while keeping all merits of the latter. The method offers several advantages over the classical domain or boundary discretization methods, among which are: * meshless. The method requires neither domain nor boundary meshing but boundary-only discretization points; * integration-free. The numerical integration of singular or nearly singular kernels could be otherwise troublesome, expensive, and complicated, as in the case, for example, the boundary element method; * boundary-only discretization for homogeneous problems. The SBM shares all the advantages of the BEM over domain discretization methods such as the finite element or finite difference methods; * to overcome the perplexing fictitious boundary in the method of fundamental solutions (see Figs. 1 and 2), thanks to the introduction of the concept of the origin intensity factor, which isolates the singularity of the fundamental solutions. The SBM provides a significant and promising alternative to popular boundary-type methods such as the BEM and MFS, in particular, for infinite domain, wave, thin-walled structures, and inverse problems.  History of the singular boundary method  The methodology of the SBM was firstly proposed by Chen and his collaborators in 2009.Chen W, \\"Singular boundary method: A novel, simple, meshfree, boundary collocation numerical method\\", Chin J Solid Mech 2009;30(6): 592‚Äì9.Chen W, Wang FZ, \\"A method of fundamental solutions without fictitious boundary \\", Eng Anal Bound Elem 2010;34(5): 530‚Äì32. The basic idea is to introduce a concept of the origin intensity factor to isolate the singularity of the fundamental solutions so that the source points can be placed directly on the real boundary. In comparison, the method of fundamental solutions requires a fictitious boundary for placing the source points to avoid the singularity of fundamental solution. The SBM has since been successfully applied to a variety of physical problems, such as potential problems,Wei X, Chen W, Fu ZJ, \\"Solving inhomogeneous problems by singular boundary method\\", J Mar SCI Tech 2012; 20(5).Chen W, Fu ZJ, Wei X, \\"Potential Problems by Singular Boundary Method Satisfying Moment Condition\\", Comput Model Eng Sci 2009;54(1): 65‚Äì85. infinite domain problem,Chen W, Fu Z, \\"A novel numerical method for infinite domain potential problems\\", Chin Sci Bull 2010;55(16): 1598‚Äì603. Helmholtz problem,Fu ZJ, Chen W, \\"A novel boundary meshless method for radiation and scattering problems\\", Advances in Boundary Element Techniques XI, Proceedings of the 11th international Conference, 12‚Äì14 July 2010, 83‚Äì90, Published by EC Ltd, United Kingdom () and plane elasticity problem.Gu Y, Chen W, Zhang CZ., \\"Singular boundary method for solving plane strain elastostatic problems\\", Int J Solids Struct 2011;48(18): 2549‚Äì56. There are the two techniques to evaluate the origin intensity factor. The first approach is to place a cluster of sample nodes inside the problem domain and to calculate the algebraic equations. The strategy leads to extra computational costs and makes the method is not as efficient as expected compared to the MFS. The second approachChen W, Gu Y, \\"Recent advances on singular boundary method\\", Joint International Workshop on Trefftz Method VI and Method of Fundamental Solution II, Taiwan 2011.Gu Y, Chen, W, \\"Improved singular boundary method for three dimensional potential problems\\", Chinese Journal of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, 2012, 44(2): 351-360 (in Chinese) is to employ a regularization technique to cancel the singularities of the fundamental solution and its derivatives. Consequently, the origin intensity factors can be determined directly without using any sample nodes. This scheme makes the method more stable, accurate, efficient, and extends its applicability.  Recent developments  = Boundary layer effect problems = Like all the other boundary-type numerical methods, also it is observed that the SBM encounters a dramatic drop of solution accuracy at the region nearby boundary. Unlike singularity at origin, the fundamental solution at near-boundary regions remains finite. However, instead of being a flat function, the interpolation function develops a sharp peak as the field point approaches the boundary. Consequently, the kernels become ‚Äúnearly singular‚Äù and can not accurately be calculated. This is similar to the so-called boundary layer effect encountered in the BEM-based methods. A nonlinear transformation, based on the sinh function, can be employed to remove or damp out the rapid variations of the nearly singular kernels.Gu Y, Chen W, Zhang J, \\"Investigation on near-boundary solutions by singular boundary method\\", Eng Anal Bound Elem 2012;36(8): 117‚Äì82. As a result, the troublesome boundary layer effect in the SBM has been successfully remedied. The implementation of this transformation is straightforward and can easily be embedded in existing SBM programs. For the test problems studied, very promising results are obtained even when the distance between the field point and the boundary is as small as 1. = Large- scale problems = Like the MFS and BEM, the SBM will produce dense coefficient matrices, whose operation count and the memory requirements for matrix equation buildup are of the order of O(N2) which is computationally too expensive to simulate large-scale problems. The fast multipole method (FMM) can reduce both CPU time and memory requirement from O(N2) to O(N) or O(NlogN). With the help of FMM, the SBM can be fully capable of solving a large scale problem of several million unknowns on a desktop. This fast algorithm dramatically expands the applicable territory of the SBM to far greater problems than were previously possible.

W. (Harold William) Gretton (16 March 1914 ‚Äì 1983) was a New Zealand poet, lyricist, writer, teacher, journalist, linguist, diarist and Second World War soldier. In New Zealand, Gretton's tramping songs (popular between the 1950s and 1970s) are still well known today. His Second World War diary is also of note for its social history of military life, along with his soldier's poem 'Koru and Acanthus'.  Life  Gretton grew up near Palmerston North on a dairy farm in Linton. He was the son of the farmer Thomas Henry Gretton and Margaret Gretton (n√©e Geddes). He attended Palmerston North Boys' High School and after Victoria College (1935‚Äì38). At Victoria, Gretton studied for his Bachelor of Arts degree and other interests included running, the University Tramping Club, and contributing to the annual student review, The Spike. He found work as a copyholder and later cadet reporter for The Dominion before attending Teacher's Training College while he was also studying part-time at Victoria.'Words like ferns: the neglected Harold Gretton‚Äô, Les Cleveland, New Zealand Books, Vol. 12, No. 5, December 2002, p. 22. Gretton served in World War II and appears on the World War II Nominal Rolls 1939‚Äì1948. He was called up for military service in 1941 and served in the 2NZEF infantry. He was teaching at Manaia Primary School in Taranaki at the time of his call-up.New Zealand Gazette, 7 May 1941, p. 1209 In 1942, he became Registrar of the Births and Deaths of Maori at Waitapu.New Zealand Gazette, 12 March 1942, p. 671 At the conclusion of his service, Gretton returned to Victoria University and teaching, and graduated with an MA in 1948. He next moved to the Hawke's Bay to teach at Rangitahi Maori District High School in Whakatane, but returned to Wellington in the 1950s to work at the Wellington Correspondence School, and after lived and taught for many years in Taupo at Taupo Nui-a-Tia College from 1962‚Äì78. Gretton married Derkje (Diana) Gretton (n√©e Hof), who was Dutch. He died in 1983 at the age of 69.  Literary output  Gretton began writing poetry as a schoolboy at Palmerston North Boys' High School. By 1931, he could produce competent parodies of Romantic Scottish ballads.Cleveland, p. 22. He published much of his poetry and prose in The Spike: or, Victoria University College Review between 1935 and 1947. In 1944, he co-edited (with Martyn Uren and J. L. Grimaldi) the February issue of the troopship magazine, Down the Hatch, which includes a number of sketches by Captain Peter McIntyre. The magazine was produced on Troopship 82 (Mooltan) which left New Zealand on 12 January 1944 carrying 11th Reinforcements. In 1949, Gretton's poetry appeared in the third edition of the Victoria University College anthology, The Old Clay Patch. He also appears in the Glenco publication, Moa on Lambton Quay: Animal, Vegetable and Funereal Verse (1951). He has tramping songs included in ephemeral songbooks such as the Tararua Songbook (1971) and collections distributed by New Zealand tramping clubs and student organisations.Cleveland, p. 22. Gretton‚Äôs songs were popular with these tramping organisations from the 1950s to the 1970s. In 1967, Gretton‚Äôs tramping songs were included in Shanties by the Way: A Selection of New Zealand Popular Songs and Ballads, collected and edited by Rona Bailey and Herbert Roth; with musical arrangements by Neil Colquhoun. In 1984, his song ‚ÄòA Fast Pair of Skis' appeared in A Thousand Mountains Shining: Stories From New Zealand‚Äôs Mountain World edited by Ray Knox. One privately published anthology of his writings, A Selection of Poems, Songs and Short Stories (c.1985), appeared after his death and printed at the Gisborne Herald. The only copy is held at the Victoria University of Wellington Library. Gretton wrote in many forms, from popular songs and ballads to triolets and other forms of light verse. Gretton also wrote one major post-Second World War soldier's poem, 'Koru and Acanthus', that he had plans for in Italy in 1945 and completed by 1946.Cleveland, p. 23. It appears in The Spike 1947. The poem looks at the apocalyptic effects of war in Europe with reflections on New Zealand's future. His papers consist of notebooks and a diary. The diary is a social history of the war period through the lens of a 2NZEF infantryman.  Renewal of interest  In 1991, Les Cleveland included Gretton's 'No More Double Bunking' in The Great New Zealand Songbook; and Cleveland again mentions Gretton for his war poem 'Koru and Acanthus' in his essay on 'War Literature: World War 2‚Äô in the Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature (1998). Academics Harry Ricketts and Hugh Roberts further included seven of Gretton‚Äôs comic verses and songs in their anthology of New Zealand comic and satiric verse, How You Doing? (1998). This can be seen as the first major inclusion of Gretton‚Äôs work in a New Zealand anthology since the 1960s whose contributors date back to the 19th century. In 2001, New Zealand poets and editors Bill Sewell and Lauris Edmond included two of Gretton's poems in their anthology of New Zealand poetry, Essential New Zealand Poems. In 2002, Les Cleveland contributed an article on Gretton to New Zealand Books. Cleveland notes 'Gretton's poetry is energised by a wry, discerning wit and dexterous capacity for rhyme.'Cleveland, p. 22. Cleveland's essay is the first significant article to appear discussing Gretton's critical neglect. Cleveland notes further that: ‚ÄòToday, Gretton is remembered by many of his generation as the composer of songs that celebrate the pleasures of the outdoors.Cleveland, p. 23. H. W. Gretton‚Äôs tramping songs ‚ÄòA Fast Pair of Skis‚Äô and ‚ÄòNo More Double Bunking‚Äô are also included on the historical website NZ Folk Songs.

It was written by Bennie Benjamin, Sol Marcus and Eddie Seiler. The first recording, by Vaughn Monroe, reached number one on the charts in 1943. The song expresses the hopes for an end to the war. The title is from the refrain found throughout the song as is found in the first verse: The reference to \\"lights going on again\\" alludes to the remark \\"The lamps are going out all over Europe. We shall not see them lit again in our life-time\\", attributed to British statesman Sir Edward Grey on the eve of the First World War. The title of the song may also refer to the longed-for end to the blackout restrictions imposed in London and elsewhere during the Second World War. Lucky Millinder's version reached number twelve on the pop charts and reached number one on the R&B; charts for two non consecutive weeks.  Background  Music was a large part of culture during World War II. During the war, music served as a uniting factor among people around the world; ‚ÄúWhen the Lights Go On Again‚Äù was one of the songs that helped keep up the spirits of those who were struggling. Famous singer Vera Lynn was best known for her music during the war, including popular songs such as ‚ÄúLili Marlene‚Äù and ‚ÄúYours.‚Äù She ‚Äúwill always be remembered by all who endured the Hell of Hitler‚Äôs Blitz, she will always be remembered by the troops.‚Äù Music has long been used to fight conflict and to help further the resolution of conflicts, as well as to fuel the fires of anger in some situations. In the case of ‚ÄúWhen the Lights Go On Again,‚Äù the song was written to give people a sense of hope and calm. Most agree that the lyrics were inspired heavily by the London blackout, which were imposed to combat the bombing raids by the Germans, called the Blitz, which lasted from September 1940 to May 1941. The blackouts lasted through to the end of the war. It was a bleak time for Londoners and the rest of the British people, as it wasn‚Äôt only London that fell under attack during the Blitz. Any city in Britain could be bombed at any time, resulting in a general sense of fear throughout the nation. It was an incredibly anxious time, as Osbert Lancaster says in his book All Done from Memory: ‚ÄúDuring the ‚Äúblitz‚Äù so long as I remained indoors I was ceaselessly assaulted by what psychiatrists so unfeelingly describe as ‚Äúirrational fears,‚Äù but on escape into the wide open spaces they were promptly transformed by the patter of shrapnel into anxieties to which my reason accorded every justification.‚ÄùBell, Amy. ‚ÄúLandscapes of Fear: Wartime London, 1939-1945.‚Äù Journal of British Studies 48, no. 1 (January 1, 2009): 153‚Äì75. This war was called ‚ÄúThe People‚Äôs War‚Äù for a reason ‚Äì it was brought directly to the people of Britain, forcing them to flee the city or face a city of fear.Bell, Amy. ‚ÄúLandscapes of Fear: Wartime London, 1939-1945.‚Äù Journal of British Studies 48, no. 1 (January 1, 2009): 153‚Äì75. Because of all the anxiety and fear caused during this time, the people needed an outlet, and that outlet came often in the form of hopeful songs. ‚ÄúWhen the Lights Go On Again‚Äù speaks of what the world will be like after the war, something that would seem far away at the time to people who were undergoing the stresses of being under attack.  Lyrics analysis  Most people have interpreted these lyrics as being a reference to both the quote by Sir Edward Grey, as well as a reference to the blackout restrictions in England. The lyrics repeated the most are ‚ÄúWhen the lights go on again all over the world,‚Äù which united people from every corner of the earth during what was truly a global war. Within the repetition are hidden the lyrics ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll have time for things like wedding rings and free hearts will sing,‚Äù and ‚ÄúA kiss won‚Äôt mean goodbye but hello to love.‚Äù These were intended to paint a picture in the minds of listeners about how the world would begin again with the conclusion of the war.

Circus Maximus will appear live in some selected shows in the summer before launching a full-scale tour in support of the new album. Glen Cato M√∏llen, the bassist of the band, told about the differences among Nine and the other two albums: \\"Two huge elements in the new material are first and foremost the evolution of the songwriting and the accessibility of the music. When you combine that with a new sound and production, you have a pretty different outcome from what we did on ‚ÄúIsolate‚Äù.

He was Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, and Adelantado of the Kingdom of Murcia. Ruiz was killed at the Battle of Mocl√≠n. He was a member of the House of Gir√≥n.  Family Origins  He was the son of Gonzalo Gonz√°lez Gir√≥n and Teresa Arias. His paternal grandparents were Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gir√≥n, a noble from Frechilla and Autillo de Campos, head mayordomo of King Alfonso VIII of Castile and his first wife Sancha Rodr√≠guez. They are credited with founding the Hospital de la Herrada in Carri√≥n de los Condes.Salazar y Acha (1989) p.82 His maternal grandparents were Arias Gonz√°lez de Quesada and Mar√≠a Froilaz. The family legend states that a noble named Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Cisneros saved the life of King Alfonso VI of Le√≥n by giving the king his horse and thus allowing him to escape what was apparently a battle lost to a Moorish Kingdom. He cut three pieces (jirones or girones, in Spanish) from the King's tunic and later asked the King to allow him to use these in his coat of arms. This legend has no foundations and the events are not mentioned by historians or in popular tradition. Most importantly, the use of coats of arms was unknown at the time of King Alfonso VI and it was not until a century later that this custom became common. Traditionally, the House of Gir√≥n was one of the most powerful families in the area of Tierra de Campos since the time of the Banu G√≥mez.  Biography  He entered into the Order of Santiago de la Espada and was made commander of Oca√±a, Le√≥n, and Castile. In 1274, he gained ownership over the charter of Montiel and the towns of C√≥zar and Alcubillas. In 1275, he was elected as Grand Master of the Order of Santiago, succeeding Pelayo P√©rez Correa. In that same here, Gonzalo was granted a lifelong title over areas in Montiel and was responsible for the repopulation, and the foundation of new localities.  Death  In 1280, Gonzalo died as a result of injuries received during the Battle of Mocl√≠n, which was fought on the 23rd of June of that year in the municipality of Mocl√≠n in Granada. More than 2,800 men died in that battle, including a large number of the members of the Order of Santiago. He was buried in the town of Alcaudete in Ja√©n.  Marriage and Descendants  Gonzalo married Elvira D√≠az de Casta√±eda, granddaughter of Alvar D√≠az de Asturias and of Teresa Perez Gir√≥n, daughter of Diego G√≥mez de Casta√±eda.

An ancient school refounded in 1549 as the Truro Grammar School, after the establishment of Truro Cathedral in the last quarter of the 19th century it was responsible for educating the cathedral's choristers and became known as the Cathedral School. The school closed in July 1982 and the education of choristers was transferred to Polwhele House Preparatory School. History An ancient foundation, the school existed before the Reformation as the chantry school of St Mary's Church, Truro. In 1549, following Edward VI's Abolition of Chantries Act of 1547 which suppressed all chantries, the school was refounded and took on a new identity as Truro Grammar School.\\"Truro Cathedral School traces its descent from a chantry school attached to St. Mary's Church.

With the creation of the Diocese of Truro in 1876 from the Cornish part of the old Diocese of Exeter, the 16th- century parish church of St Mary's was designated as a cathedral. The church was then partly demolished and partly incorporated into the new neo-Gothic Truro Cathedral, built on the same site.Oliver Berry, Belinda Dixon, Devon, Cornwall & Southwest England (2008), p. 263: \\"TRURO CATHEDRAL Plonked like a neo-Gothic supertanker in the heart of town, ...

The buildings were designed by the cathedral architect F. L. Pearson and built in the precincts of the cathedral. In 1925 the headmaster resided at Trewinnard Court. At that time choristers paid no tuition fees and there were two Bray scholarships open to choristers worth ¬£30 p.a. The Hawkins scholarship worth ¬£80 p.a. was open to former pupils studying at a university and tenable for three years. By the 1920s the cathedral school's reputation had significantly increased.Ian Gillman, Kernow (2007), p. 96 During the Second World War, the school took the junior boys evacuated from St Paul's, London, some of whom joined the Truro Cathedral choir.Of Choristers ‚Äì ancient and modern : St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral School, London , at ofchoristers.net, accessed 8 April 2012 In 1949, the school was occupying Copeland Court, Kenwyn, formerly the bishop's palace known as 'Lis Escop'.Claude Berry, Portrait of Cornwall (1949) \\"And at Truro, too, in the chapel of Lis Escop, formerly the Bishop's Palace and now Truro Cathedral School, set among the pleasant greenery of Kenwyn on the northern outskirts of the city...\\"Copeland Court, Truro at britishlistedbuildings.co.uk, accessed 9 April 2012 Until 1960, the school had a large building in the Cathedral Close.

This nocturnal species hides in burrows during the day, and can be an important food for kiwi. They can be identified by a single foretibial spine, three prolateral spines, and four retrolateral spines on the mesotibia, and their tibia lacks a tympanal membrane (they hear only through vibrations in the ground). The female has an unusual appendage on her abdomen, and the male has blackened hooks on his last tergite. They have a two year life cycle, and their diet is largely unknown. Unusually for an insect, the female shows maternal care towards her eggs and nymphs.  Taxonomy  Hemiandrus pallitarsis was first described by Francis Walker in 1871 in the genus Libanasa, and in 1906 W. F. Kirby moved it to the genus Ceuthophilus. In 1938, Kjell Ander erected the genus Hemiandrus, and moved this species to it, under the species name furcifer. This species is therefore synonymous with both Libanasa pallitarsis Walker and Hemiandrus furcifer Ander.  Habitat/Distribution  Hemiandrus pallitarsis is endemic to the North Island of New Zealand. They are widespread throughout this distribution and are relatively abundant. They are often found in burrows in the ground during the day, as they are nocturnal . During the night they are quite active on the ground, but are also found in vegetation such as beech trees, kanuka bushes and on leaves of plants such as kawakawa. H. pallitarsis is often found at elevations below 200 metres.  Conservation  The New Zealand Department of Conservation classified this species as \\"not threatened\\" in 2014. These weta are widespread and relatively abundant, therefore a species of least concern. Because they are nocturnal they are an important and accessible food source for kiwi, in areas where kiwi are present.  Diet  The diet of this species is unknown; other Hemiandrus species vary from carnivorous, to omnivorous (fruit, invertebrates, and seeds), to herbivorous (apricots and grasses), During the summer in the Orongorongo forest (southern North Island) this species of ground wƒìtƒÅ is commonly caught climbing tree trunks, with large numbers climbing into hard beech trees (Fuscospora truncata) . At the same time of year moth caterpillars feeding on hard beech are abundant which might explain this behaviour. Morphology Hemiandrus pallitarsis is morphologically identified by having a single foretibial spine, three prolateral spines, and four retrolateral spines on the mesotibia. Males can be identified by blackened hooks on the last tergite. Adult females have an elbow-like, forked appendage on their abdomen, formed from one of the sternites; this is the only Hemiandrus to have such an enlarged appendage. Females are also distinguished by their short ovipositor, so short it can be overlooked and females mistaken for males, The genus Hemiandrus contains species of widely varying overpositor lengths, which can distinguish between species. H. pallitarsus has no tympanum, and instead can detect sound through its cuticle, which is adaptive for their underground lifestyle. The tibia lack the tympanal membranes or vestiges of other Orthoptera legs. Breeding thumb Hemiandrus pallitarsis come out of their burrows at night and adults will often sit on top of leaves (such as kawakawa) and use pheromones and drumming to attract mates; it is on top of these leaves that most matings take place. This drumming sound is produced by the drumming of the abdomen on a substrate, such as a plant leaf. The special appendage on the female's abdomen is thought to function in acquiring nuptial gifts from the male: these gifts contain nutrients, allowing the female to lay more eggs.. There is a positive correlation between appendage size and nuptial gift size, and therefore between appendage size and the number of eggs laid by a female. This suggest that this structure is sexually selected upon by males, as the larger the appendage, the larger the female's fitness. Females will burrow to create brood chambers under the ground (2.5 centimeters deep at most) to lay their eggs in, staying with the eggs until they hatch (most of the time, until they die). They lay about 50 eggs at a time; the short ovipositor of this species aids in the laying of eggs within the underground brood chamber, rather than into the soil as in other Hemiandrus species. H. pallitarsis shows maternal care, which is rare in Orthopterans. There is continual care of the clutch (by covering the eggs with soil and even moving them should the burrow flood), but there is also physical, aggressive defense of the clutch. Other species within this genus exhibit maternal care too, but only the species which have short ovipositors. Eggs are laid in July, and hatching occurs in September and October (these are winter and spring months in New Zealand). Immature individuals are found most often between the months of December and March and adults are found throughout the year. Juveniles most likely take up to a year to develop into an adult. They then live for approximately two years.

The project is a partnership between the NHS in London, the Mayor‚Äôs office, St John Ambulance Prince of Wales District (SJA), British Heart Foundation (BHF), London Ambulance Service NHS Trust (LAS) and students from all five London medical schools to help prevent deaths from heart attacks, accidents and serious diseases, so improving the health of Londoners. The project brings ELS skills training into London primary and secondary schools using a cost-effective and sustainable model. Teachers and other school staff receive instructor training, equipping them to teach their pupils. Schools receive, at no cost, all the resources and equipment they need to train their pupils. Teachers are supported in the classroom by medical students from London‚Äôs medical schools who are specially trained by LAS. Training is tailored by each school to fit the ages of their pupils and the range of opportunities presented by the curriculum in a number of subjects. Evidence shows that children and young people trained in ELS, particularly if instruction is repeated several times during the school years, not only retain the knowledge of what to do, but also the confidence to step in and perform the actions needed when the moment arises. About 450 (of about 2200) London schools have been recruited into SLL, with over 280,000 pupils on the roll of schools within the scheme and therefore with training opportunities each academic year. The goal of Saving Londoners' Lives is to provide training consistently to every London schoolchild, thus growing a population for London who can act when needed. SLL has been recognised by awards from the Bupa Foundation (winner 2009), Patient Safety Awards (finalist 2010), Lord Mayor‚Äôs Dragon Awards (finalist 2010), Health Services Journal Awards (highly commended 2011) and Children and Young People Now Awards (shortlisted, 2012).

Hendricks Sensei receiving 7th dan from Moriteru Ueshiba Doshu in 2012. She started studying aikido in June 1974 while a student at Monterey Peninsula College in Monterey, California. She had been interested in studying a martial art and found a course in aikido being offered that semester. The instructor was Mary Heiny, who was a Sandan at that time, and who had recently returned from studying in Japan. It was during that semester of study that she heard about Stanley Pranin, who was teaching aikido to a small group of students in his garage in Monterey. She studied with Stan Pranin until 1977, at which time she and Stan Pranin both moved to Oakland to train with Bruce Klickstein and then with Bill Witt. Later that same year she moved to Iwama, Japan, where she became uchi-deshi and a student of Saito. She returned to Oakland in 1979 and continued studying at the same dojo. Over the next 28 years, she returned regularly to Iwama for brief and long term periods of study with Saito. During this time, she also earned her degree in Oriental Languages (with emphasis in Japanese) from U.C. Berkeley. In 1984, she founded the Aikido of San Leandro dojo. In 1988, she embarked on a 6-month European tour, combining travel and teaching, before once again returning to Iwama for study as a long-term uchi-deshi for another 18 months. At present, she is the head of the Division 1 of the California Aikido Association, and is authorized by Saito to conduct weapons testing.

Satellite The satellite has been developed at a cost of , and was launched on 1 July 2013. It will provide IRNSS services to the Indian public, which would be a system similar to Global Positioning System (GPS) but only for India and the region around it. Each IRNSS satellite has two payloads: a navigation payload and CDMA ranging payload in addition with a laser retro- reflector. The payload generates navigation signals at L5 and S-band. The design of the payload makes the IRNSS system inter-operable and compatible with GPS and Galileo. The satellite is powered by two solar arrays, which generate power up to 1,660 watts, and has a lifetime of ten years. Launch The satellite was launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) on 1 July 2013 at 11:41 PM (IST). The launch was postponed from its initial launch date of 26 June 2013 due to a technical snag in the 2nd stage of the PSLV-C22 launch rocket. ISRO then replaced the faulty component in the rocket and rescheduled the launch to 1 July 2013 at 11:43 p.m. Scientists from the German Aerospace Centre (DLR)'s Institute of Communications and Navigation in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, have received signals from IRNSS-1A. On 23 July 2013, the German Aerospace Center scientists pointed their 30-meter dish antenna at Weilheim towards the satellite and found that it was already transmitting a signal in the L5 frequency band.  Failure  The three Rubidium atomic clocks on-board IRNSS-1A failed, with the first failure occurring in July 2016. ISRO planned to replace it with IRNSS-1H, in August 2017, but this failed to separate from the launch vehicle, but on 12 April 2018, ISRO launched successfully IRNSS-1I as a replacement for IRNSS-1A. The cause of failure was traced to one of the feed through capacitor carrying the DC supply to the physics package of clock, malfunctioning due to excessive rise in temperature.

Later that year he became The Sun's political correspondent. He moved to the Daily Mail in 1976. In 1981 he became chief political correspondent of The Times, but the Wapping dispute, over Rupert Murdoch's move of the paper's staff to Wapping, ended this period of his career.

Bevins joined The Independent before its launch in 1986, and was the newspaper's first political editor. Significantly, his newspaper opposed the anonymous lobby system, preferring to find their own sources, a policy Bevins fully supported.

Biography Wardoper was born at West Burton, West Sussex in 1813.England, Select Births and Christenings, 1538-1975 She was married in 1840 to Woodland Wyatt Wardroper a medical doctor in Arundel who died in 1849. A 42-year-old widow with four children, Wardroper had had no nursing experience apart from looking after her own family, nevertheless her general level of education, good organizational skills and appropriate manner were sufficient for her appointment as matron at St Thomas' Hospital in January 1854. Although nursing was still largely a disreputable occupation she made St Thomas' a model of reformed, professional, nursing and in 1860, with the creation of the training school for nurses by the Nightingale Fund at the same hospital, she was appointed superintendent. Florence Nightingale selected St Thomas' Hospital as the site for her new nurse training school, largely because of Wardroper's qualities (and those of the enlightened resident medical officer, R.G. Whitfield). Nightingale, Wardroper and Whitfield worked together to establish the new school, the first secular training school for nurses in the world. Wardroper, however, was not so interested in the school. She was and remained, for Nightingale, a \\"hospital genius\\", for her ability to deploy nurses efficiently throughout the hospital and advise on the introduction of trained nurses in other institutions. She and Henry Bonham Carter, as the secretary of the Nightingale Fund Council, worked closely together for decades to send out teams of trained matrons and nurses from St Thomas' to bring in the new high standards to other hospitals. She took visitors to St Thomas' to show how the reformed system operated, and visited hospitals on Nightingale's behalf which were considering the introduction of trained nursing. Her important role can be seen in \\"S.E. Wardroper, Superintendent 1860-87\\".Lynn McDonald (ed.), Florence Nightingale: The Nightingale School (2009), pp. 141-392. On Wardroper's death in East Grinstead, aged 79, Florence Nightingale wrote, \\"The Reform of Sick Nursing and the Late Mrs Wardroper\\".British Medical Journal, 31 December 1892, pg. 1448 A memorial to Wardroper in the chapel of St Thomas's Hospital was unveiled in May 1894 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, a marble bas-relief representing the Good Samaritan sculpted by George Tinworth in 1893-94.

He was educated at Chester Grammar School, at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MD, and Downing College, Cambridge (from where he graduated MA and became a fellow); Richardson never practised as a doctor. Aged 28, he married Marie Louise Seymour, a daughter of George Turner Seymour of Wraxall, Somerset. They emigrated to New Zealand in 1851 on the Maori and first settled in Meadowbank near Blenheim. Arthur Seymour, Marie's brother, accompanied them to New Zealand and settled in Picton. Henry Seymour, who also returned to Nelson on that ship, was unrelated. By 1854, the Richardsons were living in Nelson. Richardson was appointed to the Legislative Council on 31 December 1853. He was a Member of the Executive Council in the first Fox Ministry from 24 May to 2 June 1856. He resigned from the Legislative Council on 13 December 1856.

It is located in the Karlova Ves borough, next to the Old Town district and the Lafranconi Bridge by the Bratislava Riverfront and it contains over 4,000 plant species (including 1,200 species of cacti) covering an area of 6.6 hectares. Botanical Garden of the Comenius University is a scientific and pedagogical institution administered by the Comenius University. Its purpose is the maintenance and expansion of its collection of living plants, providing educational support and providing expert botanical information to the public. It also serves as a facility for experimental acclimatisation of non-local plant species for use in forestry and orchard farming. Botanical Garden of the Comenius University is the oldest public botanical garden in Slovakia. It is open to the public from 1 April to 31 October each year during the daytime, and visitors have to pay an entry fee.  History  In the 16th century the medical doctor Juraj Purkircher (1530-1578), a citizen of Bratislava (known under various names throughout its history), had a small botanical garden next to his house which was visited by the famous botanist Carolus Clusius during his trip to the Kingdom of Hungary. In the year 1653, the Archbishop of Esztergom Gy√∂rgy Lippay transformed the garden of the Episcopal Summer Palace in Bratislava into a botanical garden designed to serve scientific and popularisation needs. It was the first botanical garden of this type in the Kingdom of Hungary. Botanical Garden of the Comenius University was established on 23 January 1942 by the decree of the Ministry of Education and Propaganda. Its construction was supervised by professor Franti≈°ek N√°bƒõlek, Head of the Botanical Office of the Slovak University, who became its first director. As the most suitable location for its establishment, it was decided to lay the foundations of the new botanical garden at the place around the villa of Mr. Lafranconi in Mlynsk√° dolina. The land lot in question had 6,6 hectares of space, constant water source due to the presence of the river Vydrica and the location was convenient for both students and citizens of Bratislava. Construction was carried out from 1942 to 1950 according to plans by Franti≈°ek Jir√°sek. After the Second World War an irrigation system was built as well as greenhouses and over 3,000 plant species were planted. The garden was opened on 4 July 1949 together with the opening of the Bratislava castle hill tunnel and the Slovansk√° cesta Street. At the end of the 1970s, the garden contained approximately 5,000 different plant species. In the 1980s, the area of the botanical garden was reduced due to the construction of the Lafranconi Bridge. In 1992, the greenhouses were considered technically unfit and they were reconstructed which caused all the greenhouse plants to be planted anew.  Description  The Botanical Garden of the Comenius University has had 5 directors throughout its history, the current one has been Jaroslav Bella since 1991. The area of the botanical garden is also occasionally used for events, exhibitions and open-air summer musical concerts and it is a desired place for weddings. Since 1952, the botanical garden has successfully exchanged seeds with over 530 foreign botanical gardens. = Expositions = Current exposition is divided between greenhouse plants and outdoor plants. Indoor expositions feature for example an exposition of tropical and subtropical utility plants, an exhibition of Australian flora, a palm greenhouse and a cactus greenhouse. Outdoor expositions feature among others a small japanese garden and a rosarium with over 120 species of roses, one of the most popular parts of the garden. = Detached workplaces = Botanical Garden of the Comenius University features two detached workplaces: * Blatnica - is a phyto-gene fund in Blatnica, Slovakia, 8 hectares in area. Research here is focused on the ecology of endangered plant species in natural ecosystems of the Western Carpathians. * Stupava - is a plant laboratory in Stupava, Slovakia, 20 hectares in area. It provides facilities for research and development of new plant species, especially peaches and apricots, and also for research of endangered plant species of the local lowlands and hills. Its dendrological collection includes 238 different species.

Its design is a variant of Santiago Calatrava's 1992 design of a cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge in Seville, Spain. In the Serreria bridge, the pylon is curved backward and back-stayed to concrete counterweights in the roadway. The aesthetic effect of the Serreria bridge arises in part from the curved pylon and the 29 parallel cables supporting the bridge deck, accented at night by spot lighting of the cables and the pylon.

Description The Fiery Serpent generally resembles a glowing, fiery rocket, a flaming broom, or a ball of blue fire. According to the mythology, it is an evil spirit that reveals itself at night. The serpent has been portrayed as a spirit that presents itself as the form of a lost love to widows or women grieving the loss of a lover. In their grief, and their desperation to be rejoined with their lost love, women do not recognize the serpent and become convinced that their lover has returned. The fiery serpent lacks the ability to hear and speak properly. It is told that those who are visited by the serpent experience weight loss, exhibit signs of insanity and eventually commit suicide.  Myths about the fiery serpent  According to Eastern Ukrainian legends, whilst traveling, the fiery serpent throws beautiful gifts to grieving women and villagers, including beads, rings and handkerchiefs. The serpent is often represented in Slavic folk tales as entering a person's house through the chimney. The serpent may bring gifts of gold - but those gifts turn to horse manure at sunrise. In addition, victims of the serpent often experience hallucinations, including visions of supernatural torment, such as suckling on breasts which excrete blood rather than milk. The fiery serpent has no spinal cord and cannot correctly pronounce certain words. For example, instead of \\"Jesus Christ,\\" the serpent may say \\"Sus Christ\\", or \\"Chudoroditsa,\\" in place of \\"Bogoroditsa\\" (mother of God), the woman who gave birth to a miracle. If a child is born out of a relationship with the serpent, then that child is believed to be born with black skin, with hooves instead of feet, eyes without eyelids and a cold body. Such a child is fated to live a very short life.  Sources of information  Myths about the fiery serpent are found in Serbian epic songs in Russian bylinas, fairy tales and conspiracies, as well as the hagiographic Story of Peter and Fevronia of Murom, which is based on folk material.  The origin of the image  Visible manifestations of a fiery serpent show fireballs flying deviated or horizontal, which can be seen rushing through the air in the form of long, wide ribbons of red sparks. The image of a flying dragon was associated with signs of temporary insanity, depression, or hallucinations - particularly in women who have lost their loved ones.  Fiery serpents in literature  The image of a fiery serpent was described by the Russian poet Afanasy Afanasievich Fet in his ballad, \\"Snake\\", written in 1847.

Currently two lanes with a four-lane expansion underway, the N1 is the busiest road in the country and a top development priority. Construction of a larger Dhaka-Chittagong expressway has been proposed to decrease traffic on the highway. Background When constructed, the highway was limited to two lanes of traffic for most of its length. Traffic jams or tailbacks of have been reported. In 2009, it was estimated that daily usage of the highway was 20,000‚Äì25,000 motorised vehicles, up 40% of which were trucks. The Roads and Highways Department (RHD) of the Ministry of Communication is expanding the Dhaka‚ÄìChittagong stretch to four lanes. The target to finish the project by December 2013, however implementation remains slow. The highway forms a critical component of the proposed Asian Highway Network route AH41 and the Central-South-East Asian economic corridor, including initiatives such as BCIM.  Expansion  Dhaka-Chittagong Highway after expansion In January 2010, expansion of the highway from two lanes to four lanes started.

The Supreme Court held, restoring Gnango's conviction for the murder of Magda Pniewska, that he was guilty of murder notwithstanding the fact that he had not fired the shot which killed Pniewska during the shoot out which led to her death, and that the fatal shot had been fired by his opponent in an attempt to kill him. The judgment of the Supreme Court has been criticised over the alleged extent to which it was designed to mollify public opinion, and in the context of debates over the nature of the doctrine of joint enterprise. Background At approximately 6.20 pm on 2 October 2007 a 26-year-old Polish care worker, Magda Pniewska, was making her way home from her place of work at Manley Court, a care home run by Bupa in New Cross in southeast London.Supreme Court judgment at [4] While she was talking to her sister in Poland on her mobile telephone she was killed by a single shot to the head. She had been caught in the crossfire between two gunmen in a car park outside Stunnel House in John Williams Close. The two gunmen in question were seventeen-year-old Armel Gnango, a native of Sierra Leone, and \\"Bandana man\\". The apparent cause of the gunfight was a debt of less than ¬£100. Scientific examination showed that \\"Bandana man\\", not Gnango, had fired the fatal shot. After Pniewska was shot both Gnango and \\"Bandana man\\" fled the scene.Supreme Court judgment at [8]-[9]Court of Appeal judgment at [10] The killing was widely reported in the media as an example of a \\"Wild West\\" shootout.Sky News, \\"'Wild West' Murder Teen Given Life\\", Sky News Online, (23 June 2008)\\"Life sentence for teen killer\\", The Metro, 23 June 2008. Criminal proceedings The police believed that TC was \\"Bandana man\\". He was arrested on suspicion of murder, but there was insufficient evidence to bring charges against him. Gnango was arrested four days after the shooting,Supreme Court judgment at [9] and was subsequently charged with the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\", possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life and the murder of Pniewska.Court of Appeal judgment at [12] In May 2008 Gnango stood trial at the Central Criminal Court before Mr Justice Cooke and a jury. He pleaded not guilty to all charges, although he admitted a lesser charge of possession of a firearm.A. Bloxham, \\"Sister of shot nurse heard her dying breath\\", The Daily Telegraph, (14 May 2008) Gnango testified that he had fired into the air with the intention of scaring off \\"Bandana man\\", that he had never used a firearm before and that he was in temporary possession of the firearm solely in order to sell it to a friend. The jury rejected Gnango's evidence and on 22 May 2008 he was convicted of the murder of Pniewska, the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\" and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life.Court of Appeal judgment at [1] As the jury convicted Gnango of the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\", they must have been sure that he intended to kill him. He was convicted of the murder of Pniewska, even though he did not fire the shot that killed her, under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice. The Crown Prosecution Service described the verdict as \\"unprecedented\\".BBC News, \\"Man jailed over crossfire death\\", BBC News Online, (23 June 2008) On 23 June 2008, at the Crown Court at St Albans, Mr Justice Cooke sentenced Gnango to detention for life for the murder of Pniewska, with a minimum term of twenty years, and imposed concurrent sentences of detention for public protection, with a minimum term of twelve years, for the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\" and a minimum term of five years for possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.P. Cheston, \\"Gunman gets 20 years for crossfire murder of nurse\\", London Evening Standard, (23 June 2008) Appeal to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) The Court of Appeal, where Gnango's conviction was quashed in 2010 With the leave of a single judge of the Court of Appeal, Gnango appealed against his conviction for the murder of Pniewska and made a renewed application for leave to appeal against the minimum terms of the sentences imposed upon him for the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\" and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.Court of Appeal judgment at [4] The court was constituted by Thomas, Hooper, Hughes & Gross LJJ and Hedley J and heard the appeal on 14 December 2009. Lord Justice Thomas gave the judgment of the court on 15 July 2010. The court held that \\"[t]he jury was never asked to confront the question whether the shared common purpose was not only to shoot, but to be shot at\\".Court of Appeal judgment at [59] The court ruled that \\"[t]he existence of a joint enterprise in committing crime A is ... essential to liability. That joint enterprise can either rest on an agreement or common purpose to commit crime A or simple aiding and abetting crime A\\".Court of Appeal judgment at [67] The court considered that \\"simple participation in the affray with foresight, but without a joint enterprise to commit the affray, w[as ... in]sufficient to sustain the conviction\\".Court of Appeal judgment at [61] The court therefore allowed Gnango's appeal and quashed his conviction.D. Warburton, Murder; whether secondary liability by joint enterprise arises in circumstances of mutual conflict between defendants, R v Gnango [2010] EWCA Crim 1691, Journal of Criminal Law, 2011, Vol. 75.6, 457-462 for the murder of Pniewska. On 26 July 2010 the court dismissed Gnango's renewed application for leave to appeal against sentence. However, noting that it was a \\"clear case for a sentence which proclaimed the public abhorrence of the crime being marked by it\\" and the \\"very grave\\" aggravating features of the offending, the court exercised its powers under section 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 to increase Gnango's sentence for the attempted murder of \\"Bandana man\\" to detention for public protection with a minimum term of fifteen years.Court of Appeal judgment at [77]-[84] Appeal to the Supreme Court The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge co-wrote the controversial leading judgment of the Supreme CourtUnder section 33(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, the Court of Appeal certified that the following point of law of general public importance was involved in its decision. The Supreme Court subsequently granted the Crown permission to appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal, and the appeal was heard before a panel of seven Justices on 11 and 12 July 2011. On 14 December 2011, the Supreme Court handed down its judgment. By a 6‚Äì1 majority, the court allowed the Crown's appeal, answered the certified question in the affirmative, and restored Gnango's conviction for the murder of Pniewska. The President of the Court, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers and the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Judge, jointly gave the leading judgment, with which Lord Wilson of Culworth agreed. They held that \\"[i]t is artificial to treat the intention to have an affray as a separate intention from the intention to have a potentially homicidal shooting match.\\"Supreme Court judgment at [43] They also held that \\"there is no common law rule that precludes conviction of a defendant of being party to a crime of which he was the actual or intended victim\\"Supreme Court judgment at [52] and that consequently, under the doctrines of joint enterprise and transferred malice, Gnango was guilty of murder. They also held that it was unnecessary to determine whether Gnango was a principal in the first or second degree, arguing that \\"the offence is the same offence and the defendant is guilty of it\\".Supreme Court judgment at [63] Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood concurred, adding that \\"The general public would be astonished and appalled if in those circumstances the law attached liability for the death only to the gunman who actually fired the fatal shot.\\" He did, however, consider Gnango guilty as a principal. Lord Clarke of Stone-cum-Ebony agreed that Gnango was guilty as a principal.Supreme Court judgment at [81] Lord Dyson concurred with the leading judgment and would have restored \\"the conviction on the basis that the jury must have been satisfied that the respondent aided and abetted the murder of Ms Pniewska by encouraging Bandana Man to shoot at him in the course of the planned shootout\\".Supreme Court judgment at [104] Lord Kerr of Tonaghmore gave the only dissenting judgment. He would have dismissed the Crown's appeal on the basis that \\"there was no occasion for [the jury] to consider whether the requisite intention on the part of Gnango to found a verdict of guilty on the basis of aiding and abetting was present\\"Supreme Court judgment at [126] and that Gnango could not have been guilty as a joint principal.Supreme Court judgment at [132] =Consequential orders= On 19 January 2012, as a result of the judgment of the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal (Hughes VP, Treacy & Blair JJ) restored Gnango's sentence of detention for life with a minimum term of twenty years for murder and reversed the Court of Appeal's earlier decision to increase the minimum term imposed for attempted murder.R v Armel Gnango [2012] EWCA Crim 77 Reaction and analysis Writing in The Guardian before the judgment of the Supreme Court was handed down, Anita Davies speculated that the reversal of the Court of Appeal's judgment would further complicate the law of joint enterprise and might \\"signal approval by English courts for a more American legal policy model for dealing with street violence\\".A. Davies, \\"A more American legal model for gang violence?\\", The Guardian, 25 July 2011. Sir Richard Buxton, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, argued that \\"The Supreme Court approached the case with a strong propensity to find grounds for convicting G[nango] of murder.\\" He described the reasoning of the court as \\"uncomfortable\\", and speculated that the trial judge and the jury would have considered it a \\"real oddity\\". He suggested that \\"Bandana Man\\" killing Pniewska rather than Gnango had \\"turned a man who otherwise would have been a suicide into a murderer\\".R. Buxton, \\"Being an accessory to one's own murder\\", Criminal Law Review, (2008), no. 4, pp. 275-81 Atli Stannard supported this analysis, suggesting that the prospect of Gnango being prosecuted for his own attempted murder \\"surely would ... be a farcical spectacle\\", and that the court's concern for public opinion had led it to make an erroneous decision.A. Stannard, \\"Securing a Conviction in ‚ÄúCrossfire‚Äù Killings: Legal Precision vs. Policy\\", Journal of Commonwealth Criminal Law, issue 2, (2011), pp 299-309 Elaine Freer suggests that \\"it is very hard to see under what common law rule or legislation Gnango is guilty of murder ... [as] the mens rea for an affray is not the same as for a joint enterprise murder\\",E. Freer, \\"R. v. Gnango: The Curious Case of Bandana Man ‚Äî Part 1\\", Criminal Law & Justice Weekly, vol. 176, issue 14, (24 March 2012), p 182 while Alec Samuels considers that the case must be considered in the context of the \\"unsatisfactory state of the law and sentencing around murder and manslaughter\\", and the \\"[t]he basic problem [of] ... how far association amounts to complicity\\".A. Samuels, \\"Joint Enterprise\\", Criminal Law & Justice Weekly, vol. 176, issue 7, 11 February 2012, pg. 91 Dr Jonathan Rogers, Senior Lecturer in Laws at University College London, suggests that an uncertain (quite obscure) route to finding the facts homicide renders the conviction unsafe and contrary to Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the decision was motivated by a desire to mollify public opinion.J. Rogers, \\"Shooting (and judging) in the dark?\\", Archbold Review, (2012), 1, pp 8-9 The House of Commons Justice Committee, by contrast, noted only that the \\"case illustrates the difficulties that can arise for courts and juries considering the cases based on joint enterprise\\".House of Commons Justice Committee, \\"Joint Enterprise: Eleventh Report of Session 2010‚Äì12\\", HC 1597, 17 January 2012, p. 11.

The series is based on the Walt Longmire Mysteries series of novels by Craig Johnson. It centers on Walt Longmire, a sheriff in fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming. He is assisted by staff, friends, and his daughter in investigating major crimes within his jurisdiction. Longmire became the \\"highest-rated original drama series\\" on A&E; however, the network announced in August 2014 that it would not renew the series after the third season. Warner Horizon Television offered it to other networks and Netflix picked it up, starting with season four. Netflix released the sixth and final season on November 17, 2017. All episodes are available for streaming and viewing online via Netflix in North America and Australia. Plot Walt Longmire (Robert Taylor) is the sheriff of fictional Absaroka County. Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear (Lou Diamond Phillips), a Cheyenne man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The Indian reservation has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life. =Season One= Walt's adult daughter Cady (Cassidy Freeman) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally (Bailey Chase) and \\"The Ferg\\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti (Katee Sackhoff), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies. In random flashback scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to Denver, Colorado, where Walt attacks someone in a meth house. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales (Charles S. Dutton) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did. =Season Two= Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski (Lee Tergesen), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he did not kill the murderer, but only beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation, in which Branch is severely injured and calls Walt for help. =Season Three= As Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand (Graham Greene). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence. Malachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defence. Confronted by evidence that proves that Ridges, and not Henry killed Miller Beck, Fales is forced to drop all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot. =Season Four= Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias (Zahn McClarnon), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella (Julia Jones), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker (Callum Keith Rennie), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists. One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the Crow Nation territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan (Ally Walker), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them. =Season Five= Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. Archie (The Ferg) begins a relationship with a local nurse. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Uncovering who is selling Heroin on the Reservation leads Walt to arrest their local enforcer Eddie Harp. Archie is held up at gunpoint delivering Eddie to the FBI, traumatising him. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other. Chance tells Vic where to find a murder weapon so that he can get the death sentence, but Vic gets assaulted recovering it. Walt travels to Boston to confront the head of the Irish Mafia, Sean Muldoon and tell him to stop selling Heroin or else he will divulge Muldoon's identity to the FBI. Some time later a photo arrives for Walt from Sean showing Eddie dead. Tucker Baggett, an attorney and close friend of Barlow Connally tells Walt that the real reason he is prosecuting the civil suit is so that he can bankrupt him and Barlow's real estate company can take over Walt's land for a 36-hole golf course. As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him. He is taken to a remote area of the neighboring Crow reservation, staked to the ground, and left to die. =Season Six= In the first episode, Henry is still being held by kidnappers (lead by Malachi) on the Crow reservation and might die if not found, but is finally freed by Walt with the help of the Crow witch. Walt investigates a bank robbery with some unusual aspects. Based on the use of Jacob Nighthorse's wooden stakes in the Henry kidnapping, Walt still suspects Jacob of being behind Malachi but due to Jacob's fear of Malachi, Henry arranges a reconciliation with Walt. As a result, Jacob agrees to present Malachi‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Pony‚Äù ledger to the FBI as proof that Malachi was using the Red Pony to syphon illegal profits. Walt discovers that Vic is pregnant. Walt starts his trial as does Chance who pleads guilty and then engineers his escape. In finding Chance Vic gets shot, and loses the baby. Another \\"Hector\\" appears, running Jacob and Henry off the road. Walt's civil trial goes badly, but the shooting of Tucker (who is also the attorney for the plaintiff) further complicates matters as Walt is immediately under suspicion. Vic attempts suicide. The death of former sheriff Lucien Connally (Walt's Mentor, and Barlow's brother) upsets Walt and makes him consider retirement. Jacob testifies to the collusion between Tucker Baggett and Barlow so that Walt's land can be taken and used for a golf course. As a result of emails that Jacob makes available, all charges in the civil suit are dropped. The death of the Irish Mob enforcer Eddie Harp appears to have been staged and he is discovered back selling Heroin on the reservation. Walt remains unconvinced of Jacob's innocence particularly after he confessed to having accepted funding from Sean Muldoon the head of the Irish Mob. Malachi kills Muldoon and then kidnaps Henry and Jacob to force Jacob to cede the deeds for the casino to him. Malachi and his men face a final showdown with Walt, Vic, Ferg and the recently re-instated Zach, joined by Mathias' Cheyenne Tribal Police, ending with Walt killing Malachi. Walt and Vic commence a relationship, as do Cady and Zach. Walt retires after convincing Cady to run for the job of Sheriff. Walt leaves searching for the buried treasure that Lucien had convinced him that he had found, while Henry takes over Jacob's casino. Episodes Cast and characters =Main= * Robert Taylor as Walt Longmire, the long-time sheriff of Absaroka County. His character is a throwback to the iconic heroes of classical Westerns, laconic and introspective, with a strong sense of duty and justice. As the stories build, Walt is shown to have a knack for finding the truth behind the various crimes that have been committed. His wife died a year before the series started, and he has told his daughter and friends that she died of cancer. Walt's grief leads to isolation and guilt. * Katee Sackhoff as Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, a sheriff's deputy and a former Philadelphia Police Department homicide detective. She moved to Wyoming with her husband Sean following an incident with her superior officer in Philadelphia. She has four brothers, and at least one sister. * Lou Diamond Phillips as Henry Standing Bear, a Cheyenne who is Walt's best friend and closest confidant. Their friendship began when they met in the sixth grade. Henry owns and operates the Red Pony, a local tavern and restaurant. An expert tracker, his name is described as meaning \\"a bear who protects those whom he loves\\". Henry is initially treated as a minor character, but as the series goes on, his position as a well-respected member of his community becomes a prominent storyline, and he actively helps Walt and Cady on numerous occasions. Henry does not speak in contractions. * Bailey Chase as Branch Connally, an ambitious deputy who comes from a wealthy local family. His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire. After being shot by David Ridges in Season 2, he is shown during the next season recovering and investigating the attack. He was suspended from the force and murdered by his father Barlow at the end of Season 3. * Cassidy Freeman as Cady Longmire, Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time. Later on, she becomes romantically involved with \\"Zach\\" Heflin. In the series finale, her father convinces her to run for sheriff. * Adam Bartley as Archie \\"The Ferg\\" Ferguson, an awkward but hard-working young deputy, who felt unappreciated next to his more senior deputies, the handsome Branch Connally and the former Philadelphia Detective Vic Moretti. His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady.

The pilot was written by John Coveny and Hunt Baldwin, and directed by Christopher Chulack. Coveny, Baldwin, and Chulack serve as executive producers alongside Greer Shephard, Michael M. Robin, and the production companies Warner Horizon Television and the Shephard/Robin Company. The series is an adaptation of the Longmire mystery novels written by best-selling author, Craig Johnson. The story is set in northern Wyoming, but the series has been filmed in several locations in New Mexico, including Santa Fe, Eagle Nest, Espanola, and Red River, and Las Vegas, New Mexico. Buffalo, in Johnson County, in northeast Wyoming, is the setting for some scenes set in the fictional town of Durant, county seat of Absaroka. Casting announcements began in February 2011, with Robert Taylor cast first in the lead role of Sheriff Walt Longmire. Katee Sackhoff, Bailey Chase, Cassidy Freeman, and Lou Diamond Phillips followed, with Sackhoff cast in the role of Victoria \\"Vic\\" Moretti, Chase cast as Branch Connally, Freeman cast as Cady Longmire, and Phillips cast as Henry Standing Bear. On August 26, 2011, A&E; picked up the series for a 10-episode first season. A&E; renewed it for a second season on June 29, 2012, following early success as the highest-rated summer scripted drama debut, and as A&E;'s highest-rated scripted drama. The network renewed it for a third season on November 25, 2013. In 2013, massive wildfires scorched the Valles Caldera National Preserve, which disrupted the series production. Three fires started over a three-week period, two at the same time. The Prescott Fire Department's Granite Mountain Hotshots assisted in preventing the destruction of the area around where Walt's house is filmed. Nineteen of the Hotshots' 20 members were later killed battling the 2013 Yarnell Hill Fire in Arizona. The second season's finale honored them in the closing credits. Production for the third season began in early 2014. Filming of the interiors took place in New Mexico at Garson Studios, on the campus of Santa Fe University of Art and Design. According to the New Mexico State Film Office, exteriors were filmed in and around Santa Fe and at Garson Studios. On August 28, 2014, A&E; announced that Longmire was cancelled after completing its third season, despite consistently strong viewership that made it \\"the most-watched original series in A&E; history, packing almost 6 million viewers\\" per episode, \\"reportedly because it appealed to an older demographic that was unappealing to advertisers\\" and was produced by an external studio. Three months later, Netflix confirmed that it had picked up the series (based, in contrast to A&E;, on its strong appeal to a specific segment of the audience) and would film additional episodes. The 10-episode fourth season filmed on location in New Mexico, and was made available for viewing in North America and Oceania on September 10, 2015. On October 30, 2015, Netflix announced that Longmire would return for a fifth season. Season-five location filming was scheduled for late March to late June, 2016. It took place primarily in Las Vegas, New Mexico, the town shown in the series. Other locations included towns in the surrounding area. The studio work was completed at Garson Studios at Santa Fe University of Art and Design. The 10-episode fifth season was made available for viewing on September 23, 2016. According to Eric Witt, director of the Santa Fe Film Office, season-six filming was scheduled to begin in March 2017. By June, the interior scenes had been filmed at Garson Studios; location photography was underway in various New Mexico locations including Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Valles Caldera, Pecos, and other sites in the northern part of the state. The director was T.J. Scott and the producers included Hunt Baldwin, John Coveny, Greer Shephard, and Michael M. Robin. Filming concluded the last week of June.

Reception =Ratings= Longmire debuted as A&E;'s number-one original-series premiere with 4.1 million total viewers. =Critical reception= In its first season, Nancy DeWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal called the series \\"the best of two worlds: a modern crime drama with dry wit and sometimes heart-wrenching emotion that's also got a glorious setting under the big sky of Wyoming.\\" She added: \\"If it weren't for a few modern conveniences, like cellphones and trucks, it might as well be 1875, so rugged and unspoiled does the scenery look.\\" Newsdays Verne Gay stated: \\"Longmire arrives as silently as a dust devil kicked up by a high wind on the Wyoming plains. With little in the way of fanfare and a lead actor unacquainted with household name status, it must instead rely on a quiet fortitude, much like its namesake.\\" He added: \\"Unassuming Longmire doesn't shout 'Love Me!' but instead works its charms subtly, quietly. There's promise here.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said of season one, \\"there's a sense of place to the show that makes it feel unlike every other cop show on television\\", and he would \\"like to see the mysteries grow more engaging as the series moves along, but Longmire at least starts with a good foundation in Walt, his sidekicks, and the wide, open spaces they travel.\\" The San Francisco Chronicles David Wiegand was critical, writing that the series \\"has the look and feel of a show cooked up by a bunch of bored TV industry types while they were waiting for the valet to bring their car to them at the Beverly Hills Chuck E. Cheese.\\" He added: \\"There's very little drama, and the pilot episode lumbers along like an overfed elk.\\" Three years later, after viewing the first three episodes of season four, a top critic on the Roger Ebert site wrote, \\"It sometimes sounds like faint praise to describe a series like you would a reliable car, but Longmire is just a sturdy show. It is well-constructed all around‚Äîconfidently made, well-acted, and the writing is much smarter than many shows like it. It hums, each episode these three (sic) feeling more well-paced than the one before.\\" At the same point in the series, Mike Hale of The New York Times also filed a favorable review, with particular praise for actor Robert Taylor, described as a \\"modern-day Gary Cooper or Joel McCrea\\". In the aggregate, Longmire received favorable reviews on Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. For example, season four received an average rating of 8.5/10 based on seven reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. =Accolades= In 2013, the pilot episode of Longmire, whose teleplay was written by Hunt Baldwin and John Coveny, was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. The season-two episode, \\"Party's Over\\", was nominated by the Entertainment Industries Council for a PRISM Award for Best Drama Series Episode ‚Äì Substance Use. Also in 2013, the series won the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum's Bronze Wrangler for Fictional Television Drama. The series won a Bronze Key Art Award for its season-two television advertisement, titled \\"The Oath\\". In 2014, Steve La Porte was nominated for a Makeup Artists and Hairstylist Guild Award for Best Special Makeup Effects.

These include charitable organizations, political parties, state intelligence organizations and even governments of Sri Lanka and other countries. Although the LTTE was militarily defeated in 2009, the Sri Lankan government alleges that a number of foreign-based organizations are still promoting its ideology. Early beginnings Established in 1972, Tamil New Tigers (TNT) was the precursor to the LTTE. After it was renamed as Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and restructured under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran, the group staged low key attacks against various government targets, including policemen and local politicians. During this period, LTTE was supported by Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), which considered the militant organization as a tool to pressurize government to agree to their demands. TULF leader Appapillai Amirthalingam introduced Prabhakaran to N.S. Krishnan, who later became the first international representative of LTTE. It was Krishnan, who introduced Prabhakaran to Anton Balasingham, LTTE's longtime chief political strategist and principal negotiator. But this union was short lived. LTTE rose as a more prominent force than the TULF, and TULF was marginalised. State affiliations During the early 1980s, various geo- political compulsions prompted the Government of India to sponsor and nurture the Tamil Tigers by providing arms, training and monetary support through its intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). This relationship fell apart as LTTE declared war against Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF), which was deployed to enforce disarmament of militant organizations and to watch over the regional council. Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan government under President Ranasinghe Premadasa, driven by its own compulsion to see the IPKF withdraw, clandestinely supported the LTTE by handing over arms consignments. This period ended with the withdrawal of IPKF in 1990 and the assassinations of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Premadasa in 1991 and 1993 respectively. Affiliations to other militant organizations Initially the LTTE had received training from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Southern Lebanon. LTTE was briefly associated with Eelam National Liberation Front (ENLF), a common militant front among 6 Tamil militant groups, from 1984 to 1986. In 1986, fighting broke out between LTTE and other groups due to policy differences. This resulted in almost the total annihilation of these groups by LTTE, which was far more effective and superior as a military force. =Links to other designated terrorist organisations= LTTE was believed to have few connections with other terrorist groups, although no association with al-Qaeda or any other Islamic terrorist organisations. But the group maintained interactions with other terrorist organisations through illegal arms markets in Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. It had also smuggled weapons from Pakistan-based Islamists to their counterparts in the Philippines. During the mid-1970s, LTTE rebels were known to have trained from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in Southern Lebanon. LTTE also had connections with Maoist Naxalite movement, which is fighting to establish a Marxist Indian state, and Khalistan movement, which is fighting to create a separate Sikh state in India. LTTE's shipping fleet has provided logistics support to Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, a Pakistani group with al-Qaeda affiliations, to transport a consignment of weapons to the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) in the Philippines. They also maintain close contact with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a group that shares similar goals and ideals to that of the LTTE. LTTE had also sent two combat tacticians and explosive experts to the southern Philippines to train members of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. Other affiliated organizations Peter Chalk, a professor at Queensland University in Australia divided the foreign activities of LTTE into three main areas: publicity and propaganda; fundraising; arms procurement and shipping. While the activities of these operations invariably overlapped, for the most part each section acted autonomously. During the late 1970s, V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to the LTTE. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which later turned out to be an LTTE front organization. International terrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna divides the LTTE controlled organizations into 3 types: front, cover and sympathetic. These organizations were largely helped by the deluge of Sri Lankan Tamil people migrated to western countries as a result of the Black July ethnic riots in 1983. =Main activities= As of 1998, global network of LTTE was thought to be composed of offices and cells located in at least 54 countries. The largest centres were located in major western states with large Sri Lankan Tamil communities, most notably the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and Australia. In addition to these, the LTTE had also conducted activities in countries as far-flung as Cambodia, Burma, South Africa and Botswana. Since the 1970s, it used London as its international headquarters. Eelam House located at 202 Long Lane, London SE1, which was run by Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar alias Shanthan was used as the focal point of LTTE activities in London. Shanthan became the de facto LTTE leader in the UK since 1994 in succession to Kandasamy Ruthirapathy Sekar. Primary propaganda message these offices had to spread to garner the international political support was that there can be no peace in Sri Lanka until the Tamils, led by the LTTE, are granted their own homeland. =In the 1990s= According to professor Chalk, Australasian Federation of Tamil Associations, Swiss Federation of Tamil Associations, French Federation of Tamil Associations, Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), Ilankai Tamil Sangam in United States, Tamil Coordinating Committee in Norway and International Federation of Tamils in the United Kingdom were the most active organizations affiliated to LTTE, towards the end of the 1990s. He, in the year 2000, commented that \\"LTTE international propaganda war is conducted at an extremely sophisticated level and far more so than any counter-campaign that the Colombo Government has, hitherto, been able to organize\\". In addition to propaganda, fundraising has been a major role of the LTTE global network. Some of the 800,000 strong Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora have financially contributed to the organization due to various reasons. Some of the diaspora members, who had personally experienced ethnic riots and ones who believed in an armed struggle and quest for a separate Tamil state, voluntarily donated money to the LTTE front organizations. But others did not want to contribute due to financial hardships or lack of faith on LTTE's goals and methods. These LTTE affiliated organizations used various methods to coerce the people who were not willing to contribute. Under intense pressure or outright threats, these individuals were forced to provide financial support for LTTE operations. Some of the occasions, they were threatened of the safety of their relations living in the Vanni. These organizations also staged public protests against Sri Lanka. One such event, organized by United Tamil Organization (UTO) in 1998, was addressed by 3 British MPs. =In the 2000s= With United States Department of State proscribing LTTE as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997 and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization in 2001, the landscape was changed for LTTE activities in the west. United Tamil Organization in the UK was proscribed in 2001. Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar who ran the British Tamil Association, successor to the UTO was warned by UK authorities in 2004 after he was found to have bought boots and handcuffs for the LTTE police force. Screw was tightened on other non- governmental organizations affiliated to LTTE, such as Tamils Rehabilitation Organisation (TRO) and World Tamil Movement (WTM). In 2007, TRO was designated by the United States Department of the Treasury under the Executive Order 13224, aimed at financially isolating US designated foreign terrorist groups and their support network. Following United States, the Government of Canada formally listed WTM as a \\"terrorist organization\\" in 2008, under the Canadian Criminal Code. Immediately after the banning of TRO by US, Governments of Sri Lanka and Denmark banned the local TRO offices and froze their accounts. In 2005 he Charity Commission for England and Wales investigated Eelapatheeswarar Aalayam after allegations were made last year by a UK MP that one of its trustees, Rajasingham Jayadevan, was working for the Tamil Tigers and that he and another trustee, Arumugam Vivekananthan, had met the terrorist group in 2005. The charity was cleared after commission investigators accepted the trustees' explanation that the 2005 visit, which took place three years before Eelapatheeswarar Aalayam registered as a charity. On the death of LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, Rajasingham Jayadevan has said \\"He will always be a hero to Tamils\\", \\"In the West he was misunderstood but we knew he was the only man who could fight Sri Lankan racism\\". In 2014 Jayadevan spoke of his efforts, with assistance of his local MP and \\"good friend\\" Barry Gardiner, in arranging a British Passport for LTTE chief negotiator Anton Balasingam In 2007, after a 21-month probe, the Charity Commission for England and Wales suspended the transactions, including bank accounts of the London-based charitable organisation Sivayogam Trust which ran a Temple in Tooting, South London. Its founder Nagendram Seevaratnam was found to have strong connections with LTTE. TRO in UK was removed from the UK Charity Commission in 2005. In 2009 the First-tier Tribunal (Charity) overturned the Charity Commission‚Äôs decision to remove Nagendram Seevaratnam from his trustee position and forced the Charity Commission to reinstate him, stating that there was insufficient evidence that these rumours existed or were taken seriously. It added that it was \\"most concerned\\" that significant evidence submitted by Seevaratnam on this issue had not even been translated and as a result was not considered. In 2007, White Pigeon, the successor to the TRO also came under investigation. The Canada Revenue Agency revoked the charitable status of Tamil Refugee Aid Society of Ottawa and Canadian Foundation for Tamil Refugee Rehabilitation (CAFTARR) for supporting the LTTE, in 2010 and 2011 respectively. The Patterns of Global Terrorism 2003 report by the US Department of State, named WTM, World Tamil Association (WTA), Federation of Associations of Canadian Tamils (FACT), the Ellalan Force and the Sangilian Force as front organizations of the LTTE. =Arrests and prosecution= In 1986, the chief of the Coordinating Committee of Tamils-France (CCTF), V. Manoharan was arrested for smuggling illicit drugs into Paris. In 2001, Prapaharan Thambithurai became the first Tamil Canadian to be charged on terrorism financing, for soliciting donations for the World Tamil Movement. He was convicted in 2008 and sent to 6 months in prison. In 2006, Director of Communications of Canadian Tamil Congress (CTC) Sahilal Sabaratnam, a student of the University of Toronto Sathajhan Sarachandran and 8 others were arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation for trying to purchase Russian-made missiles and firearms worth $1 million, for the LTTE. The FBI had identified Sahilal as the financial mastermind of the operation. They were sentenced to 25 and 26 years in prison, respectively. From the prison, he wrote: > We must learn to use alternative methods to violence if you choose to pursue > any political agendas. I solely believe and know for a fact that the so- > called well-wishers who had always stood behind the Canadian Tamil Congress > are believers of a violent solution. Our beloved Tamil people have suffered > the most in one form or another throughout the war. We must stop now. Stop > propagating hate through Diaspora Tamil organisations. In the same year, 4 Tamil-Americans affiliated to TRO, including the director of the American branch of the LTTE, which operated through charitable front organisations, Karunakaran Kandasamy, were arrested for their alleged material support for LTTE, including purchase of arms and ammunition. They had attempted to bribe US Justice of Dept officials with $1 million in exchange for removing LTTE from FBI‚Äôs list of banned terrorist organizations. They pleaded guilty for the charges and sentenced to maximum 20 years in prison. Kandasamy was also the head of the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC). In 2007, two prominent leaders of British Tamil Association, Arunachalam Chrishanthakumar alias Shanthan and Goldan Lambert were arrested in UK. Shanthan was found guilty of supplying bomb-making equipment for the LTTE and receiving documents for the purpose of terrorism. In 2008, Italian Police arrested 28 Sri Lankan Tamils suspected to be LTTE sympathizers, after a two- year investigation. In 2009, Aruran Vinayagamoorthy, Sivarajah Yathavan and Armugan Rajeevan of Tamil Coordinating Committee (TCC) in Melbourne pleaded guilty to offences under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 (Cth) for making assets available to the LTTE. They were sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one year. In the same year, LTTE leader of France, Nadarajah Mathithiran alias Parithi was sentenced to 7 years in prison. And the Coordination Center of Tamils in France (CCTF) was ordered to be closed by the French court. Charges levelled against the suspect included extortion, ransom collection under duress & threat, money laundering & funding a terrorist organization. In 2007 and 2008 court also ordered to cease LTTE owned satellite television stations Tamil Television Network (TTN), National Television of Tamil Eelam(NTT) and Voice of Tigers (VoT). =Post war= According to professor Rohan Gunaratna, in the aftermath of the military defeat of LTTE, its front organizations assumed a new role as proponents of human rights. These groups have called for an independent international investigation into the alleged war crimes committed during the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War. Most prominent of these groups is the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE), which aims to create an independent state of Tamil Eelam in the Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka. Political affiliations LTTE received political patronage and support from the political parties in Tamil Nadu since its early days. It obtained large sums of money from M. G. Ramachandran, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu in the early 1980s. Nedumaran, leader of the Kamaraj Congress helped LTTE set up a camp in Sirumalai in Madurai district, and Kulatur Mani helped to set up another at Kulatur near Mettur in Salem district. The interim report of the Jain Commission, which oversaw the investigation into Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, indicted M. Karunanidhi, the former Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu for abetting the LTTE. In 2009, he made a controversial remark that \\"Prabhakaran is my good friend\\". Other prominent political affiliates of LTTE in Tamil Nadu include Vaiko, the founder of the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK), Perinchintanarayana, leader of the Pure Tamil Movement and Kanimozhi, the daughter of Karunanidhi. Sri Lankan Government allegations Sri Lankan government accuses a number of Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora groups to be affiliated to LTTE. These organizations include British Tamils Forum (BTF), Global Tamil Forum (GTF) and Tamil Youth Organization (TYO). As of 2012, TYO had 12 branches through UK, EU, Asia, US and Australia. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence documentary Lies Agreed Upon (which was created after the Channel 4 documentary named Sri Lanka's Killing Fields), citing a surrendered LTTE cadre, alleged that Veerakathy Manivannam alias Castro, the head of the LTTE international wing, was the person who formed Tamil Youth Organizations in 2002. It also added that Father S. J. Emmanuel, President of the GTF made 2 or 3 visits to Sri Lanka to meet with Castro and conducted classes at the Nathan base of LTTE, on how to deal with the diaspora from Vanni. The documentary also alleged that the persons who run the global network of the defeated LTTE outfit are Perinpanayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan of the Tamil Eelam People's Alliance (TEPA) in Norway, Suren Surendiran of BTF, Father Emmanuel of GTF, Visvanathan Rudrakumaran of TGTE (former international legal advisor to the LTTE) and Sekarapillai Vinayagamoorthy alias Kathirgamathamby Arivazhagan alias Vinayagam, a former senior LTTE intelligence leader.

Wilson received the National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989.  Early life  Chesley Goseyun Wilson was born on July 31, 1932 in the town of Bylas on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in Arizona. His father, Nichol Wilson, was a medicine man and a rancher. His mother, Sarah Goseyun Wilson, died when Chesley was only two years old. Wilson is a descendant of Cochise, Eskiminzin, Santo and other noted Apache leaders. Because his father's work often required him to be on remote parts of the reservation, the pre-teen Wilson was raised by his grandfather and uncles, who were prominent musicians, singers, religious and medicine leaders of the Apache people. He learned about the making of the Apache violin and Apache flute from his uncle, Albert Goseyun. Wilson is the last active Apache violin maker descended from noted Apache musician Amos Gustina. As a teenager, he returned to the home of his father where he learned the skills of a horseman, first as a wrangler and later as a cowboy in roundups. Career In 1953, he was drafted by the US Army and served a two-year tour of duty in Korea, which exposed the young man to many experiences never possible when growing up on the reservation. After his discharge in 1955, he participated in a US government program for Native Americans where he trained as a silversmith and then worked for over twenty years in the San Francisco region and in Carson City, Nevada. He returned to Arizona in 1982. While working as a silversmith and occasionally as a security guard, Wilson continued to make Apache violins in his free time, as well as striving \\"to keep other Apache crafts, customs, and ceremonies alive\\" which garnered his 1989 National Heritage Fellowship, the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. One of his art pieces is in the musical instruments collection in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. He also made a traditional Apache violin for the Governor's Art Awards in March 1991. In 1992, Wilson was named an Arizona Indian Living Treasure. Wilson worked as a model for several years, working with artists Howard Terpning and Ray Manley. His photograph earned the cover of the July 1995 issue of Southwest Art magazine. He was also a model for the Wrangler Western Wear clothing line. He has worked as an actor over the years, appearing in both credited and uncredited roles portraying Native Americans. Wilson is an active member of the Apache Medicine Men Society, and often speaks to Apache youth about avoiding alcohol and drugs, and encourages them to incorporate traditional Apache ways into their lives.

The original route planned for the Worcester and Hereford Railway did not include the tunnel, but its inclusion became necessary in response to pressure for the line to serve the towns of Malvern and Ledbury. Ledbury Tunnel was one of the railway's greatest engineering challenges, being bored through the limestone of Dog Hill; it was opened to traffic during 1861. Possessing a relatively narrow cross-section, the tunnel suffered from a particularly poor atmosphere during the era of steam. Unlike the Colwall tunnel, which was also constructed for the line, Ledbury Tunnel has not been widened, replaced, or substantially reengineered since its original completion in the 1860s. It remains in use through to the present today. History The origins of the Ledbury Tunnel are directly connected to the development of a railway between Worcester and Hereford, which was first mooted during the early 1850s. The original intended route for the railway was actually a much straighter route running directly between the coalfields of South Wales and the industries surrounding Birmingham and the Black Country, roughly parallel to the present day A4103. As a result of considerable lobbying by the citizens in the towns of Malvern and Ledbury, who sought the new line to serve their locations as well, it was decided to change the railway's route to include them; this new route necessitated construction of two tunnels (along with two viaducts and a bridge), one of the former being the Ledbury Tunnel. During 1856, work on constructing the Worcester and Hereford Railway commenced. The need to traverse the Malvern Hills represented the endeavour's largest engineering challenge; in addition to the Ledbury Tunnel, the Colwall tunnel was also constructed for the route. Both tunnels share considerable similarities, both having a relatively narrow cross section and only able to accommodate a single track; trains are particularly constrained by the tunnel's dimensions. The excavation of the tunnel provided a valuable opportunity to study the geology, dating to the Devonian age; findings included significant numbers of fossilised fish, acanthodians and ostracoderms, some complete with the body and tail. The completed tunnel was opened to traffic during 1861, allowing for traffic to reach Hereford for the first time in September of that year. It has a length of 1,200m (1,323 yards), carrying a single line throughout. During the period in which the route was being served by steam locomotives, Ledbury Tunnel became notorious among crews for possessing a poor atmosphere, which was attributed to its unusually narrow bore combined with a steep gradient (1:80) and a bend close to its northern portal. As a consequence of the tight clearance in the tunnel, there are special rules in place for the evacuation of passengers in an emergency situation. On 15 August 1872, a train traversing Ledbury Tunnel derailed and collided with the structure; no injuries or fatalities resulted. Unlike the Colwall tunnel, the Ledbury tunnel has never been replaced or widened since its original construction back in the 1860s. However, there have been petitions and studies for the whole line, including the tunnel, to be double-tracked throughout; it has been observed that any reengineering or replacement programme would incur considerable expense.

Although at the time they were not considered formal schools or sects of Buddhism, they are now regarded as important schools in the history of Ch√°n Buddhism. Most Ch√°n lineages throughout Asia and the rest of the world originally grew from or were heavily influenced by the original five houses of Ch√°n. East Mountain Teaching Huineng tearing sutras The period of Daoxin ( 580‚Äì651) and Daman Hongren ( 601‚Äì674) came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huamgmei. The term was used by Shenxiu, the most important successor to Hongren. Shenxiu (Á•ûÁßÄ 606?‚Äì706) was the most important successor to Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Empress Wu, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period. According to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (ÊÉ†ËÉΩ; 638‚Äì713), was one of the giants of Ch√°n history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor.Á¶ÖÂÆóÁ†îÁ©∂‰∏ÄÁôæÂπ¥ Shenhui, a successor to Huineng claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren's, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu. The most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi Shenhui's influence is traceable in the Platform Sutra, which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng, but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Shenhui himself does not figure in the Platform Sutra; he was effectively written out of Ch√°n-history. From the East Mountain Teachings descend the Five Houses of Ch√°n, via various lineages. The Five Houses The five houses were each defined by a unique method of teaching. Each school's methods were significantly different from the others, though it was not unheard of for teachers from one school to use the methods of another. =Guiyang school= The Guiyang school (ÊΩô‰ª∞ÂÆó Gu√≠y√°ng, Jpn.

Isan Reiy≈´) and his student, Yangshan Huiji (807-883, or 813‚Äì890) (Yang-shan Hui-chi, Jpn. Ky≈çzan Ejaku). Guishan was a disciple of Baizhang Huaihai, the Chinese Zen master whose disciples included Huangbo Xiyun (who in turn taught L√≠nj√¨ Y√¨xu√°n, founder of the Linji School).Ven. Jian Hu. \\"Buddhism in the Modern World\\" Stanford University, May 25, 2006, p. 1 After founding the Guiyang School, Yangshan moved his school to what is now modern Jiangxi. The Guiyang school is distinct from the other schools due to its use of esoteric metaphors and imagery in the school's k≈çans and other teachings. Over the course of Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the Guiyang school, along with the Fayan and Yunmen schools were absorbed into the Linji school. Ch√°n master Hsu Yun, however, attempted to revive absorbed lineages. The attempt was successful regarding the Guiyang school, Hsuan Hua being its most known modern representative. =Linji school= The Linji () was named after Ch√°n master L√≠nj√¨ Y√¨xu√°n, who was notable for teaching students in ways that included shouting and striking in an attempt to help students reach enlightenment. The Linji school is the predominant Chinese Ch√°n school. =Caodong school= The Caodong school was founded by Dongshan Liangjie and his Dharma-heirs in the 9th century. Some attribute the name \\"C√°od√≤ng\\" as a union of \\"Dongshan\\" and \\"Caoshan\\" from one of his Dharma-heirs, Caoshan Benji; however, the \\"Cao\\" could also have come from C√°oxƒ´ (ÊõπÊ∫™), the \\"mountain-name\\" of Huineng, the Sixth Ancestor of Chan. The sect emphasized sitting meditation, and later \\"silent illumination\\" techniques. In 826 Korean Seon Master Doui, a student of Sixth Ancestor of Chan Huineng, brought Chan/Seon (Korean Zen) to Korea and founded the \\"Nine Mountain Seon Monasteries\\" which adopted the name Jogye order. In 1227 D≈çgen Zenji, a former Tendai student, studied Caodong Buddhism and returned to Japan to establish the S≈çt≈ç school. The Caodong school is still a respectable Chinese Ch√°n school and is second only to Linji in number of monks and temples. =Fayan school= The Fayan school (Ê≥ïÁúºÂÆó) was named after Chinese Ch√°n Master Fayan Wenyi (Fa-yen Wen-i), who lived from 885 to 958. =Yunmen school= The Yunmen school was named for Yunmen Wenyan. The Five Houses during the Song Dynasty Over the course of Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen houses were gradually absorbed into the Linji house. Caodong was transmitted to Japan in the 13th century from Ven. Rujing of Tiantong Temple to Ven. D≈çgen leading to the creation of the S≈çt≈ç Zen school. Chan during the Ming and Qing Dynasty Chan in the modern era Both Linji and Caodong are still practiced in China today. Ven. Sheng-yen is an example of a modern Linji and Caodong teacher. Ven. Hsu Yun revived the Guiyang school, Fayan school and the Yunmen school in China.

Plot Rumi's tomb in Konya -- the Adem Dede dancehall, the one in which Ayse has the gallery, is based on the Konya dervish house\\"An interview with Ian McDonald, Jason Pettus, July 23, 2010, Chicago Center for Literature and Photography The Dervish House is a near-future science fiction tale that follows a number of characters after a bus bombing incident in Istanbul during a week-long heatwave in April 2027. The characters have little contact with one another, other than they mostly reside or work in the neighborhood of an abandoned dervish house, Adem Dede, located in Eskik√∂y, within Istanbul's trendy Beyoƒülu district. Most of the characters witness the bombing incident from different vantage points, and their actions are indirectly related to this event. The chapters alternate character perspectives. The primary character threads concern the following characters: * Necdet, an underachieving pothead who is on the bombed bus and subsequently sees djinn while experiencing a confusing religious awakening. * Can Durukan, a homebound boy with Long QT syndrome who feels the vibrations of the distant blast. He sets his monkey-bot to investigate the scene and stumbles onto some dangerous clues. * Georgios Ferentinou, member of the Greek minority and retired experimental economist. Georgios is mentor to young Can, and participates in an intellectual think tank tasked to anticipate future terrorist plots. He is also a member of a group of older Greek men who frequent the neighborhood tea house. * Adnan Sarioƒülu, a scheming big money trader who, along with his \\"Ultralord\\" buddies, devises a scam to sell tainted gas from Iran to his corrupt investors. * Ay≈üe Erko√ß, wife of Adnan, and atheist curator of an upscale religious artifact shop, which is located near the dervish house. A mysterious buyer entices Ayse to locate the legendary mellified man. * Leyla G√ºlta≈üli, a recent marketing graduate whose big interview is thwarted by the aftermath of the bomb. A distant cousin offers her a position in his experimental nanotech company, the success of which is threatened by a contract set upon the lost half of a miniature Koran. The story itself is a thriller, driven by the curious nature and mysterious motivations of the initial bombing, which resulted in no fatalities, other than the suicide bomber. Through the various character experiences it is revealed that the initial bombing was an experiment to test the effects of a hallucinogenic substance dispersed through a nanopowder vector on an unsuspecting population, in order to catalyze hallucinatory religious visions and usher in a cultural religious awakening. The story culminates when Necdet, Can, and Georgios thwart a final attempt by the terrorists to disperse the hallucinogen through the gas pipes of Istanbul. Themes The novel combines old world aesthetics (religious art and cultural history) with high-tech innovations (nanotechnology, auto-piloted cars, robotics), while also addressing the contradictory nature of Istanbul's cultural identity at a time when Turkey has been admitted to the European Union. The effects of progress and technology on postmodern society are illustrated by the variety of disconnected neighborhood characters. The idea of religion as a shared delusion is also introduced through Necdet's unwitting hallucinogenic experience and his interactions with his neighborhood followers.

The novel was originally released in 2007 in podcast format, with a print format releasing in 2012 by Crown Publishing with some elements from the original version altered. Plot The book is set in San Francisco and is narrated from multiple perspectives, largely that of Bryan Clauser, a homicide detective known for his calm, cold demeanor. This is in stark contrast to the personality of his partner Lawrence \\"Pookie\\" Chang, who spends much of his time making wise-cracks and writing the series bible for a TV series he's developing. The two come across a series of ritualistic murders that appear to be initially unconnected but eventually prove to be related to a teenager by the name of Rex Deprovdechuk. During all of the murders Bryan and Rex both have a series of dreams where they see bizarre, monstrous people murdering the victims in the name of an as yet unknown king. Unbeknownst to the others, the monsters have kidnapped multiple individuals including the homeless junkie Aggie James. Rex is extremely unpopular at his school and was frequently the subject of physical abuse by his mother and by a gang of bullies called \\"BoyCo\\". He's initially unaware that he is the reason for the murders but finds himself genuinely enjoying the murder dreams, not only because he's witnessing his bullies' suffering but also because he finds the violence sexually appealing. Meanwhile, Bryan and Pookie investigate the crimes with the help of Pookie's former partner John \\"Black Mr. Burns\\" Smith and find that the murders are being committed by a group called \\"Marie's Children\\". The group is steeped in mystery as any records of the group- and their opponents \\"The Saviors\\"- have been expunged from multiple places. Rex is eventually approached by Sly and a few members of Marie's Children, who tell him that he is their king and is destined to lead them to a glorious new future. Sly and the others help Rex murder his abusive mother and then take him to a series of hiding places before taking him to \\"Home\\". During this Bryan finds that Marie's Children are a humanoid species separate from humanity and that he is one of them. He also reconnects with his ex-girlfriend Robin, a medical examiner for San Francisco. Bryan and Pookie's investigations lead them to Jebidiah Erickson, but the two are fired by police Chief Amy Zou because they wouldn't leave the investigation alone. Despite this, they break into Erickson's house and find multiple stuffed monsters. They are also caught by Erickson and Bryan ends up stabbing the other man as his Marie's Children DNA, paired with the dreams he'd been having, cause him to see Erickson as a threat. Heavily wounded, Erickson is taken to the hospital and Bryan finds that rather than the older man being the reason for the murders, he was actually hunting Marie's Children and was the reason why there were not more deaths in the city. Meanwhile, Rex returns home and is told that all of Marie's Children are born from the same woman: Marie, who serves as a queen bee and is also Rex's birth mother. He is also told that he must have sex with her in order to create a new queen so the colony can spread to other areas. During this Aggie is told that his life is going to be spared so he can smuggle an infant king out of \\"Home\\", as some of the Children do not want the colony to spread and will kill any kings that Marie produces. Knowing that the alternative is death, Aggie readily agrees and later absconds with the infant. The book culminates with Bryan teaming up with Erickson to invade \\"Home\\" and kill off Marie's Children. They ultimately succeed in killing Marie and most of the Children, but the attempt comes at the price of multiple lives, including Erickson's. Robin is also murdered in the process, which leaves him grief-stricken. He decides that he will take on Erickson's role as a Savior (as there are still Children in San Francisco) and assumes his identity, as he feels that he has nothing tying him to his old life. The book ends with the revelation that Hillary, a female leader of the Children, has become a new queen after Marie's death and is being cared for by some of the remaining Children.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Lancaster, the archdeaconry of Lancaster and Morecambe, and the diocese of Blackburn. Its benefice is combined with those of Christ Church, Glasson, and St Luke, Winmarleigh. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History The oldest surviving part of the original church building is the tower, which dates from the 16th century. The body of the church had been rebuilt in 1814, and this was replaced again in 1910‚Äì11 by the Lancaster architects Austin and Paley. This replacement cost ¬£5,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Architecture =Exterior= The body of the church is constructed in sandstone rubble, the tower in ashlar, and the roof is slated. The plan consists of a five-bay nave with a clerestory and a two-bay chancel under a continuous roof, north and south aisles, a south transept with a vestry, and a west tower. The tower is in three stages with diagonal buttresses and a battlemented parapet. On the south side is a stair turret. In the tower is a west doorway with a round arch, a three-light west window, and three-light bell openings. The windows in the sides of the aisles and clerestory corresponding to the nave have two lights, and those corresponding to the chancel have three lights. The east window has four lights containing Perpendicular tracery and ogee quatrefoils. =Interior= Inside the church, the arcades between the nave and the aisles are carried on octagonal piers with no capitals. In the chancel is a piscina and a double sedilia. The stained glass in the east window was made by Morris & Co. and depicts the Four Evangelists; the figures of Saint Matthew and Saint John are based on cartoons by Ford Madox Brown, that of Saint Mark by Edward Burne-Jones, and that of Saint Luke by William Morris. The two-manual pipe organ was made in about 1830, possibly by Renn and Boston. External features In the churchyard is the 18th-century base of a sundial, which is listed at Grade II. The churchyard also contains the war graves of a British and a Canadian soldier of World War I.

Eventually, the Bunnyman returns and causes the group's car to crash, killing Jack a short while later when he rams the vehicle from behind as Jack is working underneath it. The remaining five proceed to travel on foot, encountering a deranged hillbilly, a woman called Melissa and a man who advises them to seek shelter in a supposedly abandoned cabin nearby, saying they will return for them after a trip to the hospital. In reality, the two are disposing of the bodies of some of the Bunnyman's victims. On route to the cabin, two of the quintet spot the Bunnyman butchering bodies and he kills one of them with a chainsaw. Chased to the cabin which belongs to the Bunnyman, the group loses two more members when Mike is killed with a chainsaw, and Tiffany is captured and tortured to death by the Bunnyman and his demented, hunchbacked accomplice, Pops. After the Bunnyman dismembers Tiffany's body and sits down to eat her flesh with Pops and Melissa, the remaining two travellers, Rachel and John, are captured while trying to get Melissa's car keys. As Melissa prepares to murder a bound Rachel, John manages to free himself from his restraints, kills Melissa and takes her keys and car. As John and Rachel flee they are chased by the Bunnyman's truck. Concocting a plan the two pull over and John exits the vehicle carrying an unmoving Rachel who he offers to the Bunnyman. The Bunnyman hesitantly takes Rachel and places her in the cab of his truck, where she springs to life and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors, wounding him, and she kicks him out onto the road and driving away after John gets into the truck. As Rachel laments \\"We're going to need a lot of therapy\\" the wounded Bunnyman is shown walking off into the sunset. The credits then roll, alongside more 8mm footage depicting what appears to be the young Bunnyman and his family.

Like a bitter, out of date Easter egg, it's shiny and pretty on the outside and sickening under the foil\\". 28 Days Later Analysis called Bunnyman an incompetent and frustrating mess, gave it a \\"generous\\" three out of ten, and wrote \\"atrocious acting, zero character development, no tension, zero sense of pacing, poorly written, continuity errors abound, audio problems, ADR and dubbing, poorly written characters, forced tension, meandering story, etc.\\" Gorepress also gave an overwhelmingly negative critique, stating \\"The Bunnyman Massacre is literally the worst film I've seen in years. Decades, even. Why? Well ‚Äì simply put ‚Äì because it's appallingly made on every single level\\".

Overview The WSSP was established in 2010 at the University College London (UCL) by a group of students. It is non-political and non- ideological in its outlook, with representatives in over 40 countries around the world. The foundation also hosts both local and virtual events to raise awareness and support for its activities. Mission In a 2012 interview conducted by Ohio State University, the WSSP's founder Kasim Ali described his organization as a global movement that aims to recruit Somali students and professionals working in the fields of engineering, healthcare, education and agriculture, and enlist their services in Somalia's ongoing post-conflict reconstruction process. The WSSP is also liaising with Somali professionals in business and transportation, among other sectors. Activities =2011 Eastern Africa drought= In response to the 2011 Eastern Africa drought, WSSP operated a food distribution center during the holy month of Ramadan for 1000 internally displaced people in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. Contributions came from Somali students and professionals from around the world, with WSSP youngsters running operations on the ground. =Operation Restore Home 2012= After extensive consultations with Somali stakeholders, the WSSP launched in 2012 its flagship grassroots initiative, tentatively titled Operation Restore Hope. Later renamed Operation Restore Home 2012, the campaign was inaugurated in Columbus, Ohio since the city hosts one of the largest Somali communities in the United States, second only to the Twin Cities of Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul. The initiative endeavors to mobilize around 1000 qualified Somali youth from the diaspora to repatriate in the summer of 2012. Members are then expected to pool their resources and knowledge to carry out projects in the areas of agriculture, education, health and medicine. Enlisted students cover their own ticketing costs, and are scheduled to visit around ten cities in Somalia over a period of three months.Somalia: A Light At The End Of The Tunnel!.

Born in 1919 to parents James William Lewer and Emily (n√©e Brown), David was the younger of two siblings. His sister Phillis was born in 1917, but died in 1950.http://home.alphalink.com.au/~bjpratt/family/lewer001.htm Lewer became a chorister at the Temple Church, London in 1931, remaining in the choir until 1933. Unlike most Temple choristers, he had already begun at City of London School before being accepted into the choir,Lewer, David J - A Spiritual Song (the Templar's Union, 1961) Preface, p. 13 and after his voice broke in 1933, he remained connected with the church for much of his life, initially as Honorary Librarian and a member of the Templars Union, the association of old choristers. Later, he joined the gentlemen of the choir as a Tenor, and remained a regular member of the choir until at least 1982 and the retirement of 'The Doctor', Sir George Thalben-Ball. He remained an occasional member for several years after this. Following his retirement to Dorset, he was an active participent in the choir of St George's Church, Langton Matravers. After qualifying as an architect, Lewer spent his career in architectural practise. Even after his retirement, he continued to work, designing and project managing the building of his final residence, Quality Court in Langton Matravers, Dorset, which was built partially in the garden of his previous residence, Old Forge Cottage. Starting after the Second World War, Lewer also began to write factual books and pamphlets on a variety of subjects, but specialising in his two great loves: Swanage and its history, and the Temple Church. His most famous work, 'A Spiritual Song', is a comprehensive history of the Temple Church choir, and was published by the Templar's Union, the association of ex-choristers, and was conceived particularly as a memorial to Alfred Capel Dixon: he was granted access to the historical records of two of the Inns of Court, the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple by then sub- treasurer of the Inner Temple, Commander Rodney Flynn . It is notable for containing the complete list of choristers from the foundation of the current choir model under Edward John Hopkins in 1842 up until the date of publication: a list which was updated in subsequent reprints. Publications His publications included: * The Lea Valley - footpath guides (1948, reprinted 2011) * A Spiritual Song: The Story of the Temple Choir and a History of Divine Service in the Temple Church, London - pub The Templar's Union (1961) * The Temple Church - Pitkin Pride of Britain Books (1967, reprinted 1971) * Curiosities of Swanage: Or, Old London by the Sea (with J.Bernard Calkin) (1971) * The Temple Church - Pitkin Pictorials (1973) * Story of Swanage: History from Early Times - Harewood Publications (1986) * Swanage (with John Mowlem) - Dorset Publishing Co (1989) * Hardy in Swanage: The Author's life on the Coast - Dorset Publishing Co (1990) * Swanage Past (with Denis Smale) - Phillimore & Co Ltd (1994, reprinted 2004) * The Temple Church in London (with Richard Dark) - Historical Publications Ltd (1997) He was closely associated with the Tithe Barn Museum in Swanage, and was an active fundraiser for the organisation. Throughout his life, he remained close to the affairs of the Temple Church and its choir, and in the early 70's took over the running of 'Temple Camps', summer holidays for the choristers of the church, from his great friend Capt A C Dewar. This ensured he was known to generations of boys.

The poem is usually called the Stanzaic Morte Arthur or Stanzaic Morte (formerly also the Harleian Morte Arthur) to distinguish it from another Middle English poem, the Alliterative Morte Arthure.Ackerman pp. 489‚Äì90 It exercised enough influence on Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur to have, in the words of one recent scholar, \\"played a decisive though largely unacknowledged role in the way succeeding generations have read the Arthurian legend\\".Weinberg p. 111 Synopsis King Arthur holds a tournament, which Sir Lancelot attends in disguise. He stays for one night at the castle of the Earl of Ascolat, and there the earl's daughter falls in love with him, even though she knows Lancelot loves someone else. Lancelot is injured at the tournament, and is invited by the earl to recuperate at Ascolat. Lancelot leaves when he has recovered, giving the earl's daughter his armour as a memento. Ascolat is then visited by Gawain, who has come from Camelot to search for Lancelot. The earl's daughter, still not knowing Lancelot's name, shows Gawain the armour, which he recognises. On his return to Camelot Gawain tells Arthur that Lancelot loves the earl's daughter. When Lancelot arrives at Camelot he receives so little welcome from his lover, Guinevere, that he leaves again in confusion. Guinevere then finds herself falsely accused of murdering a Scottish knight, and must find a champion to defend her in a trial by combat. The body of the maid of Ascolat is discovered in a boat, floating down the river into Camelot, along with a note in which the maid bewails Lancelot's refusal of her love. Lancelot returns to successfully defend Guinevere, and since she now knows that he is true to her she is reconciled with him. The two are surprised in bed together by several of Arthur's knights, but Lancelot escapes, killing in the process all of the knights except Mordred. Guinevere is sentenced to death, but Lancelot again rescues her and takes her to his castle, Joyous Gard. Arthur besieges Joyous Gard, but without effect. The Pope now orders Lancelot to send Guinevere back to Arthur, and Arthur to accept her. Both comply, but Lancelot goes into exile. Arthur takes his army abroad to levy war against Lancelot, leaving Guinevere behind in the custody of Mordred. Gawain, now an inveterate enemy of Lancelot, fights a single combat with him, and is defeated. Word comes that Mordred has crowned himself king and plans to marry Guinevere. Arthur returns home and defeats Mordred's army in two battles, but Gawain is killed. Before a third battle can be fought Arthur dreams that he is cast down from the high point of the Wheel of Fortune. In a second dream Gawain warns him he must call a truce so as to give Lancelot's army time to join him. The next day Arthur and Mordred, each accompanied by fourteen knights, meet to discuss peace terms. The truce is broken by mistake when one of the knights draws his sword to kill an adder. Battle is joined and the armies are so equally matched that both are exterminated, with the exception of Mordred, Arthur, and Arthur's knights Bedivere and Lucan. Arthur kills Mordred, but is himself mortally wounded. At Arthur's command, Bedivere throws Excalibur into the sea. Three ladies come to take Arthur to Avalon to be healed, but they fail in this purpose, and the next day Bedivere comes across Arthur's newly erected tomb. Guinevere, repenting of her adultery, takes the veil at Amesbury. Lancelot arrives on the scene belatedly and visits Guinevere. They renounce each other in favour of a life of penance, and Lancelot accordingly becomes a monk. The poem ends with their death and burial seven years later. Composition and metre The poem is the work of an anonymous writer who lived during the 14th century in the north Midlands. His source was the French prose romance La Mort Artu, but he compressed it to a romance only about one fifth of the Mort Artus length. He probably intended his work for a wide and relatively unsophisticated audience.Stone p. 169Weinberg p. 100Benson and Foster p. 4 He cast his work in the metre of a minstrel romance ballad, each stanza containing eight lines rhyming ABABABAB, and each line having four beats. As the poem has come down to us there are seven places where the stanza is two lines short, but the original poem may not have had that fault. The poet took many liberties with his rhymes, and also used more alliteration than is common in a Middle English rhyming romance.Benson and Foster pp. 4‚Äì5 Manuscript and early descriptions It survives in one manuscript only, British Museum Harley 2252, a collection of texts compiled in the early 16th century by a London bookseller called John Colyns. Close study has shown that the section containing the Stanzaic Morte was originally a separate commercially produced booklet. One leaf, dealing with the burial of the Maid of Astolat, is now missing.Ackerman p. 490 By 1570, the manuscript had passed into the possession of one Robert Farrers.Bruce p. vii The manuscript was studied by Humfrey Wanley, keeper of the Harleian Library, who in 1759 catalogued it with the notation, \\"This I take to be translated from the French Romance of K. Arthur\\"; also \\"I know not who this Poet was, but guess that he lived about the time of K. Henry VII, and that he might have been a Northern man. He useth many Saxon or obsolete Words, and very often delighted himself (as did the Author of 'Piers Plowman') in the Chime of words beginning with the same letter.\\"Johnston p. 19Bruce pp. vii‚Äìviii Thomas Percy, mentioning the Stanzaic Morte in his widely influential Reliques of Ancient English Poetry (1765), suggested that it could be older than Wanley thought, since the first line was, he believed, quoted in the Middle English romance of Beves of Hamtoun.Bruce p. viii Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry (1774‚Äì81) includes a short extract from the Morte, and dates it to the early 14th century.Johnston p. 113 In Observations on the Three First Volumes of The History of English Poetry (1782), and again in Ancient Engleish Metrical Romance√´s (1802), the antiquary Joseph Ritson ridiculed Warton's and Percy's views of the poem's date, and asserted that Wanley was correct in assigning it to the reign of Henry VII. He noticed the similarities with Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, but believed that the poem was based on Malory rather than vice versa. A lengthy but rather facetious synopsis of the Morte, with quotations, figured in the Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805) by George Ellis. Ritson's late date for the poem was there rejected.Johnston pp. 171‚Äì2 A complete edition of the Morte by Thomas Ponton was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1819.Bruce p. ix Influence on Malory It is now generally agreed that the last two stories of Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, \\"The Book of Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere\\" and \\"The Most Piteous Tale of the Morte Arthur\\", derive from his reading of the Stanzaic Morte Arthur and of the Stanzaic Mortes source, the Mort Artu. Some of the high points of those last stories are certainly taken from the Stanzaic Morte, such as the final renunciation scene between Lancelot and Guinevere at Amesbury, and the final truce between Arthur and Mordred being accidentally broken by a knight killing an adder. In places he even reproduces the exact words of the Middle English poem. According to Jennifer Goodman, \\"Malory owes to the stanzaic Morte Arthur an important share of the drama of the closing books of his work.\\"Benson and Foster pp. 3‚Äì4Goodman p. 41  Scholastic reception  Brian Stone thought that \\"with its swiftly moving narrative and realistic clash of character\\" it is more like an extended tragic ballad than a romance. He preferred its ending to that of the Morte Darthur, and considered the poem to be \\"of prime importance in our culture\\".Stone pp. 7, 11 Dieter Mehl referred to \\"The by no means simple, but skilfully handled metrical form\\"; to \\"a rare balance in the structure of the plot, a strict subordination of details to the theme of the poem, and a notable lack of digressions which could slow down the tempo of the narration\\"; and to a \\"conscious simplicity and detachment that distinguish Le Morte Arthur from most other romances and make it so particularly attractive and appealing to modern taste.\\" Rosemary Woolf called the Stanzaic Morte \\"the finest example of the English treatment of central Arthurian subject-matter before Malory's Morte Darthur.\\" Praise from some others has been more measured. Jennifer Goodman wrote that \\"The verse is workmanlike: an acute sense of character and action allow the poet to focus in on the essential elements of fate and personality that combine to create Arthur's tragedy.\\" Lucy Allen Paton complained of the Morte's poet that \\"his supply of rhyme- words is extraordinarily limited\\", and that \\"he lacks the vigour of imagination, the intensity of feeling and the originality in description that the poet of the [Alliterative] Morte Arthure possessed\\", but went on \\"he manifests real power as an easy and agreeable story-teller‚Ä¶Perhaps his most noticeable characteristic is his facility in bringing before us by a few direct dramatic words the human interest of the scenes that he is describing.\\" Robert W. Ackerman judged that \\"Though marred by faults typical of the minstrel style, it tells a moving story vividly and swiftly.\\"Ackerman p. 489 George Kane's opinion was that \\"Never once in its four thousand lines does it attain to brilliance, yet its effect is so unmistakably one of fulfillment and of harmony between intention and result that it must be regarded as a success.\\"  Bibliography  = Editions = *Thomas Ponton (ed.)

Months  Information about the Saka calendar on a Balinese wall calendar Based on a lunar calendar, the saka year comprises twelve months, or sasih, of 30 days each. However, because the lunar cycle is slightly shorter than 30 days, and the lunar year has a length of 354 or 355 days, the calendar is adjusted to prevent it losing synchronization with the lunar or solar cycles. The months are adjusted by allocating two lunar days to one solar day every 9 weeks. This day is called ngunalatri, Sanskrit for \\"minus one night\\". To stop the Saka from lagging behind the Gregorian calendar ‚Äì as happens with the Islamic calendar, an extra month, known as an intercalary month, is added after the 11th month (when it is known as Mala Jiyestha), or after the 12th month (Mala Sadha). The length of these months is calculated according to the normal 63-day cycle. An intercalary month is added whenever necessary to prevent the final day of the 7th month, known as Tilem Kapitu, from falling in the Gregorian month of December. The names the twelve months are taken from a mixture of Old Balinese and Sanskrit words for 1 to 12, and are as follows:Hobart et al, p82Esimeman (1989) pp186-190 # Kasa # Karo # Katiga # Kapat # Kalima # Kanem # Kapitu # Kawalu # Kasanga # Kadasa # Jyestha # Sadha Each month begins the day after a new moon and has 15 days of waxing moon until the full moon (Purnama), then 15 days of waning, ending on the new moon (Tilem). Both sets of days are numbered 1 to 15. The first day of the year is usually the day after the first new moon in March.Esimeman (1989) pp 159,186 Note, however, that Nyepi falls on the first day of Kadasa, and that the years of the Saka era are counted from that date.  Use  The calendar is 78 years behind the Gregorian calendar, and is calculated from the beginning of the Saka Era in India. It is used alongside the 210-day Balinese pawukon calendar, and Balinese festivals can be calculated according to either year. The Indian saka calendar was used for royal decrees as early as the ninth century CE.Haer et al, pp 24, 228 The same calendar was used in Java until Sultan Agung replaced it with the Javanese calendar in 1633.Ricklefs (1981), p.43  Notable days  The Balinese Hindu festival of Nyepi, the day of silence, marks the start of the Saka year. Tilem Kepitu, the last day of the 7th month, is known as Siva Ratri, and is a night dedicated to the god Shiva. Devotees stay up all night and meditate. There are another 24 ceremonial days in the Saka year, usually celebrated at Purnama.  References   Bibliography  * Eiseman, Fred B.

History There has been a Catholic church named Saint Patrick's in the town since 1750. The first building was on a site donated by the first Earl of Clanbrassil on Chapel Street and in 1843, was converted into a school. The then-Parish priest, Fr. Matthew McCann, acquired the current site in 1834. The church was opened for worship in 1842 but was not complete for many years after. Work stopped during the Great Famine and resumed in 1860. It was designed by the Newry architect Thomas Duff, who modelled the interior on Exeter Cathedral, and the exterior on King's College Chapel. Duff died before completion and the architect J. J. McCarthy was chosen to finish the magnificent interior. The bell tower is a later addition, being added in 1903. On 3 February 1867, Michael Kieran was consecrated as Archbishop of Armagh in St. Patrick's Church and chose during his tenure from 1867 to 1869 St. Patrick's in Dundalk as his mensal parish. The completion of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Armagh was left to his successor, Daniel McGettigan. Architecture and furnishings The interior looking towards the nave It is 9 bays in length and has two side aisles to the north and south of the building. The church contains a wealth of distinctive features, including fine granite pillars, tiled floors, a vaulted ceiling and many colourful stained glass windows by acclaimed designers Franz Mayer & Co. of Munich, among others. McCarthy designed the high altar and ornamental screens covering the eastern wall while George Ashlin designed the intricate Italian mosaic walls in the chancel. The sculptor Thomas Farrell fashioned the side altars.

The species was described as new to science in 1988. It occurs in Mexico, Hawaii and Jamaica. On 21 October 2010, this fungus was found near Lamington National Park, Queensland, Australia. Field surveys confirmed that the fungus was widespread in south east Queensland and NSW North Coast and present in the Coffs Harbour region, Mid-North Coast, NSW. It was not found further south in NSW. Host-specificity testing of the fungus on closely related plant species to mist flower within the Eupatorieae tribe, including two Australian native Adenostemma species, revealed that only the invasive plant crofton weed (Ageratina adenophora) developed some disease symptoms, albeit to a much lesser extent than mist flower. A series of strategic releases of the fungus to non-infected mist flower sites in NSW were made in May 2011. Monitoring sites were revisited in May to July 2012 and a measurable adverse impact of the fungus on mistflower was recorded. There was more than 60% decrease in percentage cover of mist flower across sites, with a corresponding increase, by also more than 60%, of the percentage cover of other plant species. Within a very short time frame, the project demonstrated that the white-smut fungus has great potential as a highly effective and self-sustaining control method for mist flower across its range.

She was the wife of Southern Han's founding emperor Liu Yan (Emperor Gaozu), and the daughter of Ma Yin (Prince Wumu), the prince of Southern Han's northern neighbor Chu.  Background  It is not known when the future Empress Ma was born. Further, while she was known to be a daughter of Ma Yin's, no historical record indicated who her mother was. In 913, Liu Yan, who was then formally a Later Liang vassal (as Ma Yin was as well) as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Qinghai Circuit (Ê∏ÖÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), sent emissaries to Ma Yin, asking to marry a daughter of his. Ma Yin agreed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268.

A promising amateur he turned professional in 1988 and won the Wales Middleweight belt in 1992. Boxing career Ellis grew up in Llanedeyrn in Cardiff, and attended Llanedeyrn High School where he excelled as a sportsman. Ellis captained both the schools rugby and football teams before taking up boxing at the age of sixteen. He collected several junior honors before winning the Welsh ABA light-middleweight title as a senior in 1987. In 1988 he challenged for the British ABA Light-middleweight title, defeating reigning champion Neville Brown on his way to the final. He then faced Willie Neil in the final, whom he beat on points despite being knocked down in the first round. With the British ABA title Ellis believed he would be the first choice for the light-middleweight position on the British team to the Seoul Olympics. The selectors wanted to take another look at Brown and Birmingham based fighter Richie Woodhall. Ellis reacted by turning professional, ruling himself out of the Olympics. Ellis took on Frank Warren as his manager and former Welsh ABA finalist Tony Alsop as his trainer on a three-year deal. Ellis' first professional fight was on 25 June 1988, appearing on the undercard to the Barry McGuigan vs Francisco Tomas Da Cruz fight at Kenilworth Road in Luton. Ellis' opponent that night was journeyman Seamus Casey; and the fight went the full six rounds with Ellis declared winner on points decision. Over the next three years, Ellis fought another ten times, winning all but one fight, a draw with future British welterweight challenger Lindon Scarlett. With his contract with Warren expiring, Ellis switched managers, linking up with Barry Hearn. Ellis' first fight under Hearn saw his first professional loss. Fighting against Leeds-based boxer Colin Manners, Ellis was struck and knocked down by a punch on the break. Despite Manners being reprimanded by the referee, Ellis never fully recovered and the fight was stopped at the end of the first round. Ellis came back from this defeat to win his first title when he beat Alan Richards for the vacant Welsh middleweight title on 11 February 1992. He then successfully defended his title against Mike Phillips at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London, stopping him in the seventh round via technical knockout. The win against Phillips came with a cost as Ellis as he damaged a hand in the contest, and along with a bout of glandular fever, he didn't fight again for nearly a year. Ellis returned to the ring in July 1993 to take on Paul Busby at the National Ice Rink in Cardiff, an undercard fight to Steve Robinson defence of his WBO featherweight title. Ellis stopped Busby in the fifth round. Ellis then faced Irish fighter, Steve Collins, again in Cardiff. The fight was a disaster for Ellis, suffering nine rounds of battery from Collins, and resulting in Ellis' second professional defeat. Collins soon after moved up to super-middleweight, vacating his WBO Penta-Continental strap. This allowed Ellis a rematch with Busby for to challenge for the title. The fight, arranged for 28 June 1994 in Mayfair in London, ended controversially in the fourth round when the two boxers clashed resulting in a heavy gash to Ellis head. Ellis could not continue and the referee raised Busby's hand in victory until it was pointed out that under WBO rules the decision had to go to the scorecards. The scores to that point had Ellis ahead and he was awarded the title. A rematch was arranged and this time Busby won on points, taking the title from Ellis. By this time Ellis was struggling with the rigours of coming in at weight, and moved up to super-middleweight. His one and only fight at this weight, a challenge for the Wales super- middleweight title, ended in defeat to Darron Griffiths and Ellis promptly retired from boxing.. He died on 9 January 2018 aged 49.

The name Worfe is said to derive from the Old English meaning to wander (or meander) which the river is notable for in its middle section. Mapping indicates that the river begins at Cosford Bridge where the Cosford Brook and Albrighton Brook meet (Cosford Brook, a local name, is itself the confluence of the Ruckley Brook and Neachley Brook). Course It rises at Crackleybank on Watling Street, just north of Shifnal. It then forms the boundary of that parish with Tong, Donington, and Albrighton. It then passes through Ryton (where it is joined by Wesley Brook), and Beckbury. There it is joined by Mad Brook, which takes its name from Madeley through where it first flows. Soon after, it forms the boundary between Stockton and Badger, before flowing through Worfield to join the River Severn. The river flows downhill to the Severn at an average rate of 10 feet per mile so that between the source and its mouth there is a drop of . The river has two outlets to the River Severn, of which the southern emerging at Fort Pendlestone was formerly the mill leat serving Pendlestone Mill, the ancient corn mill of the town of Bridgnorth and long belonging to Bridgnorth Corporation. Due to the low flow problems affecting the river in its upper reaches, a pipeline was constructed in 1998 between a borehole at Sheriffhales and Ruckley Brook north of the A5. The Severn Rivers Trust carried out remedial works to the river and its banks in March 2015. Six community groups and 27 volunteers installed of fencing, installed numerous eel and fish passes and created of new channelling in an effort to improve the river's ecological status. Sources The river is fed by many smaller brooks within Shropshire; Ruckley, Wesley, Mad, Neachley, Albrighton, and Stratford Brooks, along with one other beck known as Badger Dingle. During the course of these headwaters flowing into the Worfe, they go through various names: Neachley has a Morning Brook flowing into it, Wesley Brook is composed of the River Sal and Hem Brook and Stratford Brook starts out as Pebble Brook before flowing into Patshull Great Pool and becoming first Pasford Brook, then Nun Brook, and finally Stratford Brook. Near where the Stratford Brook joins the Worfe it is also joined by a smaller watercourse which has the names of Cut Throat Brook, Claverley Brook and then Hilton Brook. Cut Throat Brook is so named after the area if flows through, but it is unknown as to how the area got its name. Mad Brook (also known as Madebrook) rises in Telford Town Park and has until 2014, been largely culverted and polluted. This was remedied in a clean up campaign by the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, to return the covered sections to daylight and stop pollutants and run-off from poisoning the waters.

It has been described as \\"one of his most famous pieces\\" and a \\"masterpiece\\".Schimmel pp. 52, 173 It has also been compared to Ahmad Shawqi's Arabic poem Siniyyah for its locating in Islamic Spain \\"the embodiment of the ideal, non-territorial Islamic nation\\" that is, in both poems' world-views, \\"the source of world history.\\"Noorani p. 238 Context of Composition Iqbal travelled to England in 1931 to participate in the second and third Round Table Conferences in London.Schimmel p. 52 He returned to India via Spain (as well as France and Italy), and it was at this time that he visited the eponymous mosque, though by that time it had long since been converted to a cathedral. Nevertheless, it was at what has been described as one of the \\"high points of his emotional life\\"Mir p. 14 that he composed the majority of the poem, as its subtitle clearly indicates: :\\"HispƒÅnƒ´ya kƒ´ sarzamƒ´n bƒÅlkhus≈´s qurtaba men likhƒ´ ga'ƒ´\\", or, \\"Written in the land of Spain, particularly in C√≥rdoba\\". The visit must indeed have inspired him, as the resultant poem is one of the very few occasions in which Iqbal praises art or architecture. Annemarie Schimmel has observed, :\\"He was most critical to the existence of fine arts in Islamic culture, and has admired most those buildings which seem to express the vigorous character of the young and powerful Islam, like the mosque of Cordova, and the Qutub Minar of Delhi. But on the whole the beautiful form as such did not appeal that much to him.\\"Schimmel p. 145 Structure The poem is written in the rajaz metre,Matthews p.173) with the following pattern of long (‚Äì) and short ( Àò ) syllables divided into four feet: :‚Äì Àò Àò ‚Äì / ‚Äì Àò ‚Äì / ‚Äì Àò Àò ‚Äì / ‚Äì Àò ‚Äì with an optional caesura or additional short syllable at the end of each line.Pritchett & Khaliq ¬ß 6.1 The eight stanzas are thematically quite distinct, but linked together in a natural progression of ideas.[A] :Stanza 1: A description of the nature of time, as an unending and cyclical chain of days and nights (\\"Silsila-e roz-o shab\\") which is nevertheless only an apparent reality; everything that man creates is therefore ephemeral, and the end result is annihilation (\\"KƒÅr-e jahƒÅn be ·π£abƒÅt!\\"). :Stanza 2: Here Iqbal focusses on the one quality that transcends time and is, as such, indestructible: true, spiritual love (\\"'ishq\\"). :Stanza 3: It was this love, then, that created the mosque of Cordoba; it is the ability to feel the \\"burning and melting\\" of worship that places man in a more privileged state even than the forms of light (\\"paikar-e n≈´rƒ´\\"). :Stanza 4: The glory and beauty (\\"jalƒÅl-o jamƒÅl\\") of the mosque causes Iqbal to think on the nature and qualities of the true believer, whose refuge in times of trouble is in the declaration of faith (\\"SƒÅyah-e shamshƒ´r men us kƒ´ panƒÅ lƒÅ 'ilƒÅha\\"). :Stanza 5: Here Iqbal outlines the characteristics of a true Muslim. :Stanza 6: The centrality of the mosque of Cordoba to Islamic Spain is compared to the centrality of the Kaaba to Islam generally; while the positive impact of Islam on Spain and Europe are extolled. :Stanza 7: Iqbal bemoans the waning of Islam in Europe, and outlines the great upheavals that swept Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries. He observes that a similar turmoil currently existed in the Muslim world. :Stanza 8: This is a call for revolution and reform, as well as a summary of the poem in general.

The church was included as a contributing property in the Jackson Park Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History South elevation The Rev. Henry Tullidge arrived at Grace Church in Galena, Illinois in November 1834 as a missionary supported by Grace Church in Providence, Rhode Island. The first services in Dubuque were held sometime not long after his arrival. Tullidge served the spiritual needs of people in the surrounding area. St. John's parish in Dubuque was organized in 1845 and a brick church was built on the corner of Ninth and Locust Streets. The parish continued to grow, but the American Civil War delayed any plans for a new church. A parish woman's organization raised the money to buy the property on the corner of Loras and Main Streets. At the time a tenement named Norton's Rookery stood on the site. Construction of the present church began in 1875 and it was completed three years later. The church was designed in the High Victorian Gothic style by New York architect Henry M. Congdon. The rough-cut limestone for the walls was quarried in nearby Farley, Iowa. The church follows a cross-shaped plan. It features a crenelated corner tower, recessed entryways, a rose window, roof dormers, and a shorter tower toward the back of the church that is capped by a spire. The larger tower was also designed to have an upper tower and a spire, but they were never built. Five of the stained glass windows are from Louis Comfort Tiffany's studio.

Following study, Gross painted and produced intaglio prints in Spain, painted in Brussels, and in 1928 returned to work in Paris, and other parts of France, working entirely from life. While in France he developed a working relationship with J√≥zef Hecht and Stanley William Hayter. During the early 1930s he exhibited in Paris galleries, becoming a member of the La Jeune Gravure Contemporaine, designed costumes and settings for ballet, and worked with composer Tibor Hars√°nyi. He co-directed the short film La Joie de vivre with Hector Hoppin in 1934.Artoftheprint.com: Anthony Gross.

In 1940 he brought his family from France to England, to live at Flamstead, Hertfordshire. Second World War Through advocacy by Eric Kennington to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, Gross was offered, and accepted, the role of an official war artist, and produced etchings and oil and watercolour paintings of English coastal defences and troop training. In 1941, with a temporary commission of captain, Gross was attached to the 9th Army and painted within the Egyptian, Syrian, Palestinian, Kurdistan, Lebanese, and Mesopotamian theatres of war, sometimes accompanied by other war artists Edward Ardizzone and Edward Bawden, and later documenting the 8th Army's North African Campaign. From 1943 he transferred to India and Burma to witness the front line battle against the Japanese; these works were the subject of a one- man exhibition at the National Gallery when he returned to England. Later, in 1944 and 1945, an exhibition of 51 of these drawings, entitled India in Action, toured Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Gross accompanied the D-Day invasion of Northern France, wading ashore near Arromanches at 2pm on D-Day. He sketched the beachhead landings and spent the night in a slit trench on the beach before moving inland the next day. Gross recorded the devastation of Bayeux and Caen, and followed the Allied armies to Paris and then into Germany. He witnessed the meeting of American and Russian forces at the River Elbe on 25 April 1945. Gross was, at the time, one of the many war artists who painted a portrait of General Montgomery.

They captured the regional cup in 1954 and the following year, earned another third-place finish. TSV remained part of Amateurliga play, earning generally mid-table results, until being demoted in 1966. They moved up and down between the Amateurliga (III) and the Verbandsliga Bremen (IV) over the next three seasons until settling into Amateurliga competition until the end of the 1970s. The team descended through the Landesliga to lower tier local level play in 1983. Through the 1980s they were an elevator club, moving frequently between Landesliga Bremen and Bezirksliga play. They returned to the now fifth tier Verbandsliga Bremen in 1994 before again sliding to Berzirksliga competition by 2000. Two successive promotions saw TSV rise again to the Verbandsliga by 2007. Wulsdorf remain part of the circuit which was renamed the Bremen-Liga in 2008.

The first installations were completed in 1941, around the same time as the completion of the nearby Battery Moltke, in St. Ouen.Jersey Occupation Trail The batterie site is located at the end of Noirmont Point, a rock headland which overlooks St. Aubin's Bay, Elizabeth Castle, and the harbours of Saint Helier. It was a part of the Atlantic Wall system of coastal fortifications, and most of the concrete structures remain today. The 3rd Battery of Naval Artillery Battalion 604 were stationed here.The Channel Islands 1941‚Äì45: Hitler's Impregnable Fortress The site overlooks the 19th Century Martello tower of La Tour de Vinde. This is the black and white tower visible in the photo to the right. The tower is painted to serve as a daymark. There is no easy footpath from the battery to the tower. Naval guns In 1941, the main guns in the battery were three 15 cm SK L/45 naval guns, with a fourth 15 cm SK L/45 installed later. These guns were originally manufactured by Krupp and date from 1917. The guns were placed on elevated concrete platforms. Ammunition was stored in nearby bunkers, and was manually transferred from the bunkers, via concrete footpaths, to smaller concrete storage bays at the guns. After the Liberation of the Channel Islands, the guns were removed by the British Army, and discarded at the foot of the cliffs at Les Landes, in St Ouen. =Gun no. 1= \\"Gun no. 1\\" in 2012. The path (right) leads down to Ammunition Bunker VII. This gun was positioned on top of a walled concrete platform, with one access ramp, and a small room alongside the gun. Ammunition was stored in Ammunition Bunker VII, and was manually moved from the bunker up to the gun, via a sloping concrete path, to be stowed upright in small bays, just to the rear of the gun. To the rear of the platform, there was a barrack hut, an administrative building, and a personnel bunker. Only the bunker remains in 2012.File:Ni√®rmont J√®rri Juilet 2009 a.jpg ‚Äì Wikimedia Commons To the east, was a latrine structure. Electrical and communications services for this gun were linked to the command bunker. In 1992, the gun no. 1 was recovered and returned Noirmont Point. The recovery work was completed in March 1998, by placing the cannon back on to the gun platform, using a Chinook helicopter. =Gun no. 2= In 1941, this gun was positioned on top of a concrete platform, located to the north east of the command bunker. =Gun no. 3= Gun no. 3 was positioned on top of a concrete platform. The ammunition bunkers are not in close proximity to this platform, so extra storage bays were built below the platform. In 2012, there is no gun at this position. A section of the platform wall is missing, due to demolition when the gun was removed. =Gun no. 4= Gun no. 4 was positioned on top of a concrete platform. MP1 tower MP1 tower with panoramic views. Plaque attached to the tower. The Marine Peilstand 1 tower, or MP1 tower, was used to observe targets at sea. The round tower is around tall, and has four observation floors, each with a wide, and narrow embrasure (for observation purposes only). Each of these floors was assigned to observe for one of the four 15 cm naval guns. The tower has five floors, including a windowless lower floor, plus a further open rooftop floor. Access is gained via a steel door, at the top floor, which is protected by an adjacent embrasure, suitable for small arms. An Oerlikon 20 mm cannon was placed on the top of the tower for anti-aircraft purposes. In 2012, the gun is no longer present, but its steel support can be seen. The tower, built between April and October 1943, is located near the top of the steep sloping cliff, and extends no higher than the headland, which means its profile does not protrude into the sky when seen from afar. The visibility of the tower was reduced further using camouflage. It is one of three completed direction and range finding towers, of this type, in Jersey. Nine towers were planned, but only towers numbered 1 to 3 were built. The towers were to be positioned around the entire coast of Jersey, so that any neighboring pair of towers could work together to pin-point a precise location of a target using triangulation. The position of the target would be passed on to the artillery, so that the gun could be rotated, raised or lowered to the correct orientation to fire upon that position. =Westwall type 101v bunker= This personnel bunker is adjacent to the tower. It was sealed and filled in after the Liberation, and was excavated from 2009, by the Channel Islands Occupation Society. Type M.132 Command bunker Command bunker at Battery Lothringen.

Photo appears to have been taken before the bunker was built The command bunker is located alongside the MP1 tower.Noirmont Command Bunker It featured an armored naval rangefinder, and two steel observation cupolas. A periscope was used in conjunction with the rangefinder, to determine the direction of a target. The bunker was built between March 1943, and May 1944. It has two floors, one entrance, and an escape shaft. It is constructed from reinforced concrete formwork. The lower-floor serves as a living area, and has 9 chambers, which include quarters for troops, 2 rooms for officers, an administration room, a standby room, a room for central heating plant, and a coal store. There is an escape shaft, which is accessible from the NCO's room. The upper-floor includes the operations room, washroom, toilets, first aid room, telephone exchange, and an escape shaft. The main entrance is on this floor, and is defended by two embrasures. The operations room provides underside access to the cupolas. In 2012, only the arms of the rangefinder are original. They were recovered from the foot of the cliffs, restored and attached to a new turret. This bunker has been restored and operates as a museum during the tourist season. Searchlights A searchlight platform, at Battery Lothringen, in 2012. Two searchlights were installed, on concrete platforms, on either side of the headland. In 2012, only the platforms remain. Present day In 2013, the headland site is fully accessible at all times, and there is a public car park at the end of the headland. Some of the installations and interiors are in a restored state, and can be visited at various times ‚Äì usually on Sundays. The gun emplacements can be visited at any time, including two partly restored guns, on display, at two of the gun platforms. Memorials In 1950 the States of Jersey purchased the headland at Noirmont as a memorial to all those Jersey people who perished during the Occupation. A memorial stone was unveiled at Noirmont on 9 May 1970 to mark the 25th anniversary of Liberation. One of the bunkers has a plaque honouring two pilots of 263 Squadron who died on 7 December 1942 when they were shot down as they attacked a German convoy off the Point in their Whirlwind fighter-bombers. There is a memorial to the 16 men of the US Navy's PT Boat Squadron 34 who died on 9 August 1944 when they attacked a German convoy ferrying guns from Guernsey to Jersey. Fourteen of the men were from PT 509, which rammed a German minesweeper escorting the convoy, and two were from PT503.

Starting in 2016, Minerva expanded into postgraduate education by offering a Master of Science in Decision Analysis. In 2017, the school had a 2% acceptance rate and a 57% yield. In 2020, Minerva created its Visiting Scholars year. The one-year program, completed remotely, offers the four Cornerstone Courses (see Pedagogy) to students accepted into a leading college or university who face challenges attending in residence for the 2020-21 academic year due to COVID-19.  Academic departments  Under its first accreditation plan, Minerva's primary academic institution was its School of Arts and Sciences, which included the College of Social Sciences, the College of Natural Sciences, the College of Computational Sciences, and the College of Arts and Humanities. When the Bachelor of Science in Business was approved by WASC, it led to the creation of the School (and College) of Business. In May 2018, the schools were restructured into two divisions: the Division of Arts and Sciences and the Division of Business and Computational Sciences. In late 2015, Minerva's Master of Science in Decision Analysis received approval and regional accreditation. This led to the creation of the Graduate Division, which is currently overseen by Joshua Fost, PhD. Professors are trained to use Minerva's proprietary learning platform, the Active Learning Forum. Faculty retain intellectual property rights to their research.  Pedagogy  Courses are conducted as online seminars capped at 19 students. Minerva applies a 1972 study that shows that memory is enhanced by ‚Äúdeep‚Äù cognitive tasks. Such tasks include working with materials, applying it, and arguing about it instead of rote memorization. All classes begin with a short quiz and end with a second one later in the class, that is claimed to increase retention. The automated recording of student performance allows tracking of progress. Students initially take four ‚ÄúCornerstone Courses‚Äù that introduce \\"Habits of Mind\\" and \\"Foundational Concepts\\" that cut across the sciences and humanities. The four \\"Cornerstone Courses\\" are Empirical Analyses, Formal Analyses, Complex Systems, and Multimodal Communications. In Empirical Analyses, students learn about evaluating and analyzing scientific methods and use that knowledge to build problem-solving proposal. In Formal Analyses, students learn to evaluate and perform data, and perform design thinking skills using game theory and classification method. In a humanities class, students learn the classical techniques of rhetoric and develop basic persuasive skills. Finally, in social science class, students learn about the characteristics of complex systems (which represent our humanity interaction), and leaderships, self-awareness, and negotiation. Minerva encourages students to use massive open online courses to learn what is typically taught in first- year courses.  Facilities  Minerva maintains one residence hall in San Francisco, California on Market Street, as well as ones in Berlin, and Buenos Aires, Seoul, Hyderabad., London, and Taipei. Minerva has no classroom facilities, since all classes are conducted through an active learning platform developed by the school, where students participate in seminar classes of up to 19 people.

In August 1057, King Henry and Count Geoffrey invaded Normandy on a campaign that was aimed at Bayeux and Caen. The size of their army and its composition are unknown.Beeler Warfare in Feudal Europe pp. 46‚Äì47 They first arrived in the Hiemois region of Normandy and began raiding and pillaging towards the two towns. Duke William, who appears to have been reluctant to oppose his overlord directly, gathered a large army at Falaise but took no other action besides keeping scouts out to report the invading force's movements. When the invaders reached a ford on the estuary of the Dives River near Varaville, they began to cross but when the tide came in, the process had only been half completed, leaving the army split in two. William seized the opportunity and attacked the half of the invading army that had not yet crossed. Later reports by chroniclers made the battle into a massacre, but contemporary writers barely noticed it.Douglas William the Conqueror pp. 72‚Äì73 Modern historians have praised William's generalship during the battle, with David Bates noting the battle as an example of William's habit of surprising his enemies with unexpected moves.Bates William the Conqueror p. 54 The main effect was that the invaders retreated quickly from Normandy. The battle also marked the end of the last invasion of Normandy during Duke William's lifetime.Bates William the Conqueror p. 50 After the retreat of Henry and Geoffrey, William was able to extend his influence outside his Norman lands, increasing his power in Maine in the years 1057 through 1060. Other results included Bishop Ivo of Sees switching from an Angevin to a Norman alliance. In the next year, 1058, William invaded King Henry's lands and recaptured the castle at Tilli√®res, which had been lost to the Normans during William's minority.

Between 28 and 34 of those deported survived their continued imprisonment (following their deportation). Because the Norwegian police and German authorities kept records of these victims, researchers have been able to compile information about the deportees.Some discrepancies about the numbers remain. For example, German documents related to the transit of prisoners on the Donau indicate that 530 were deported from Oslo, whereas the list compiled by Ottosen (1992) indicates that 534 were on board, but this includes Helene Johansen and Mirjam Kristiansen, who were deported on the Donau, but on another date. Kai Feinberg, who was a prisoner on the Donau, was ordered to compile a list of prisoners at the time, and his recollection was that there were 532 on board. Mendelsohn allows that some individuals may have been counted twice, others may have been omitted. The list provided here is based on Ottosen's list, with annotations where these are available. It has been checked for possible duplicates based on name and date of birth. In most sources, the number of survivors is commonly cited as 26; Ottosen (1992) lists 26 individuals as survivors, but omits Harry Meyer, who was captured in the context of the Kvarstad incident, and Robert Savosnick, probably due to an error on his part; as Savosnick is listed as a survivor in the master of list of deportees. This list includes all those who the Nazi authorities considered Jewish. A few of these did not consider themselves Jewish. None of the available literature seeks to ascertain which of the victims were or were not Jewish according to halacha.

Johansen and Mirjam Kristiansen were both originally from the Soviet Union and married, respectively to Johan Strand Johansen and Henry Wilhelm KristiansenHenry W. Kristiansen, who were the secretary and editor in Communist Party of Norway. They were all arrested with their husbands as political prisoners in connection with Operation Barbarossa and sent on an early departure on the SS Donau to Ravensbr√ºck. Once there, the two women were identified as Jewish and transported to Auschwitz, where they were murdered in May 1942. Most Jewish spouses of non-Jewish Norwegians were spared deportation, but these (as well as Benjamin Bild) were initially arrested for political reasons. Johan Strand Johansen survived the war; Henry Kristiansen died in Neuengamme on January 16, 1942.

The altered performance was measured by subjective reports, questionnaires, the obtained solutions for the professional problems and psychometric data using the Purdue Creativity, the Miller Object Visualization, and the Witkins Embedded Figures tests. This experiment was a pilot that was to be followed by control studies as part of exploratory studies on uses for psychedelic drugs, that were interrupted early in 1966 when the Food and Drug Administration declared a moratorium on research with human subjects, as a strategy in combating illicit use.  Procedure  Some weeks before the actual experiment, a preliminary experiment was conducted. It consisted of two sessions with four participants in each. The groups worked on two problems chosen by the research personnel. The first group consisted of four people with professional experience in electrical engineering, engineering design, engineering management and psychology. They were given 50 micrograms of LSD. The second group consisted of four research engineers, three with a background in electronics and one in mechanics. They were given 100 milligrams of mescaline. Both groups were productive in ideation but, according to Fadiman, the fact that the participants didn't have actual personal stake in the outcome of the session negatively affected the actualization of the ideas. This is why the actual study focused on personal professional problems that the participants were highly motivated to tackle. The experiment was carried out in 1966 in a facility of International Foundation for Advanced Study, Menlo Park, California, by a team including Willis Harman, Robert H. McKim, Robert E. Mogar, James Fadiman and Myron Stolaroff. The participants of the study consisted of 27 male subjects engaged in a variety of professions: sixteen engineers, one engineer-physicist, two mathematicians, two architects, one psychologist, one furniture designer, one commercial artist, one sales manager, and one personnel manager. Nineteen of the subjects had had no previous experience with psychedelics. Each participant was required to bring a professional problem they had been working on for at least 3 months, and to have a desire to solve it. Commonly observed characteristics of the psychedelic experience seemed to operate both for and against the hypothesis that the drug session could be used for performance enhancement. The research was therefore planned so as to attempt to provide a setting that would maximize improved functioning, while minimizing effects that might hinder effective functioning. Each group of four subjects met for an evening session several days before the experiment. They received instructions and introduced themselves and their unsolved problems to the group. Approximately one hour of pencil-and-paper tests were also administered. At the beginning of the day of the experiment session, subjects were given 200 milligrams of mescaline sulphate (a moderately light dose compared to the doses used in experiments to induce mystical experiences). After some hours of relaxation, subjects were given tests similar to the ones on the introduction day. After the tests, subjects had four hours to work on their chosen problems. After the working phase, the group would discuss their experiences and review the solutions they had come up with. After this, the participants were driven home. Within a week after the session, each participant wrote a subjective account of his experience. Six weeks further, subjects again filled in questionnaires, this time concentrating on the effects on post-session creative ability and the validity and reception of the solutions conceived during the session. This data was in addition to the psychometric data comparing results of the two testing periods.  Results  Solutions obtained in the experiment include: * a new approach to the design of a vibratory microtome * a commercial building design, accepted by the client * space probe experiments devised to measure solar properties * design of a linear electron accelerator beam-steering device * engineering improvement to a magnetic tape recorder * a chair design, modeled and accepted by the manufacturer * a letterhead design, approved by the customer * a mathematical theorem regarding NOR gate circuits * completion of a furniture-line design * a new conceptual model of a photon, which was found useful * design of a private dwelling, approved by the client * insights regarding how to use interferometry in medical diagnosis application sensing heat distribution in the human body The participants also reported following experiences of enhanced functioning: low inhibition and anxiety, capacity to restructure problem in larger context, enhanced fluency and flexibility of ideation, heightened capacity for visual imagery and fantasy, increased ability to concentrate, heightened empathy with external processes and objects, heightened empathy with people, subconscious data more accessible, association of dissimilar ideas, heightened motivation to obtain closure, visualizing the completed solution.  Criticism  According to a recent unpublished review by Matthew J. Baggott, PhD, the experimenters co- administered methamphetamine as an \\"energizer\\" along with the mescaline. This went mysteriously unreported in Fadiman's published work. > \\"[T]he preliminary report of the study indicates that participants received > methamphetamine and chlordiazepoxide along with the mescaline: 'In the > individual sessions the drug regime consists of psychic energizers and a > psychedelic drug (200 mg. of mescaline sulphate in these experiments), > usually with additional energizer at mid-day' (Fadiman et al. 1965, p 4). > The nature of these energizers is clarified later in the report where > methedrine (methamphetamine) and librium (chlordiazepoxide) are explicitly > mentioned (ibid, p B-1). Because the co-administration of other drugs was > not described in the peer-reviewed publication by Harman et al. in > Psychological Reports, very few subsequent commentators have noted this > confound (Krippner (1968) notes the use of 'energizers' without comment)\\" > p.8  Related research  In the overview of the experiment, Harman and Fadiman mention that experiments on specific performance enhancement through directed use of psychedelics have gone on in various countries of the world, on both sides of the Iron Curtain. In the book LSD ‚Äî The Problem-Solving Psychedelic, Stafford and Golightly write about a man engaged in naval research, working with a team under his direction on the design of an anti-submarine detection device for over five years without success. He contacted a small research foundation studying the use of LSD. After a few sessions of learning to control the fluidity of the LSD state (how to stop it, how to start it, how to turn it around) he directed his attention to the design problem. Within ten minutes he had the solution he had been searching for. Since then, the device has been patented by the U.S., and Navy and Naval personnel working in this area have been trained in its use. In 1991, Denise Caruso, writing a computer column for The San Francisco Examiner went to SIGGRAPH, the largest gathering of computer graphic professionals in the world. She conducted a survey; by the time she got back to San Francisco, she had talked to 180 professionals in the computer graphic field who had admitted taking psychedelics, and that psychedelics are important to their work; according to mathematician Ralph Abraham. James Fadiman is currently conducting a study on psychedelic micro- dosing for improving normal functioning. Micro-dosing (or sub-perceptual dosing) means taking sub-threshold dose, which for LSD is 10-20 micrograms. The purpose of micro-dosing is not intoxication but enhancement of normal functionality (see nootropic). In this study the volunteers self-administer the drug approximately every third day. They then self-report perceived effects on their daily duties and relationships. Volunteers participating in the study include a wide variety of scientific and artistic professionals and students. So far the reports suggest that, in general, the subjects experience normal functioning but with increased focus, creativity and emotional clarity and slightly enhanced physical performance. Albert Hofmann was also aware of micro-dosing and has called it the most under-researched area of psychedelics. Since the 1930s, ibogaine was sold in France in 8 mg tablets in the form of Lambar√®ne, an extract of the Tabernanthe manii plant. 8 mg of ibogaine could be considered a microdose since doses in ibogatherapy and -rituals vary in the range of 10 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg adding usually up to 1000 mg. Lambar√®ne was advertised as a mental and physical stimulant and was \\"...indicated in cases of depression, asthenia, in convalescence, infectious disease, [and] greater than normal physical or mental efforts by healthy individuals\\". The drug enjoyed some popularity among post World War II athletes, but was eventually removed from the market, when the sale of ibogaine-containing products was prohibited in 1966. In the end of 1960's The International Olympic Committee banned ibogaine as a potential doping agent. Other psychedelics have also been reported to have been used in similar way as doping. In 1948, Swiss pharmacologist Peter N. Witt started his research on the effect of drugs on spiders. Witt tested spiders with a range of psychoactive drugs, including amphetamine, mescaline, strychnine, LSD, and caffeine. All the drugs tested reduced web regularity except for small doses (0.1‚Äì0.3 ¬µg) of LSD, which increased web regularity.

It was set up in Lulworth, in Dorset in December 1972. It began as a collective but was constituted as a Co-operative under the Friendly Society Act in 1977. This was superseded by a private company in December 1983. It was established after a long personal consideration of the nature of participation and the politics of power in theatre. Its performances were all conducted as theatre-in-the-round, in normal lighting and with minimal use of costume and props. It was a long term experiment in the use of theatre in the round and was driven by a strong egalitarian philosophy. All members were expect to share in all the jobs necessary to keep a small professional theatre company on the road, from administration to finance to performance. It also worked on an open door principle that if there were spaces and people wanted to join, all bar a few basic qualifications, primarily having a clean current driving licence and being able to speak English, they were free to do so. In theory, there was no automatic right to sack people either.  Instant Theatre and other forms of practice  Travelling throughout Britain Ireland and Europe, Word and Action produced plays, theatre, poetry and artwork, specialized in Instant Theatre and ran creative language workshops and courses doing work with schools, businesses and all sections of community, encouraging creativity and language improvement. It worked primarily in schools, but it also worked in prisons, day centres with a range of difficult to reach audiences. In the early sixties the founder RG Gregory had worked with a number of theatre-in-the-round pioneers, including Stephen Joseph, Peter Cheeseman and Alan Ayckbourne. By the late 1960s he had devised Instant Theatre as a way of trying to eliminate manipulation within the practice of participatory theatre in schools. Broadly, Instant Theatre Chris Johnson, The Sun Shone at Midnight, House of Games, 2005 demanded a team of three trained actors each with three distinct roles. The 'Questioner' would gather the first scene of a story through a neutral question and answer process in which they were obliged to accept all answers heard. When enough information for that scene was gather the other two would take on parts with everything else being offered to the wider audience. Parts would include other characters, but also include inanimate objects, such tables, doors, mountains, as well as natural effects like the wind and the rain. The critical thing, like membership of the company, was that all participation was voluntary. No one could be forced or manipulated in participation which often meant that performance included periods of waiting for parts to be filled. But through the sale of Instant Theatre particularly to overseas audiences, Word And Action was one of the few independent theatre companies to survives the severe cuts to community arts budgets in the 1980s. From 1985 the company operated without subsidy and grew to 17 employees at one point with anything up to four performance teams working in different countries at the same time. Throughout its time, the company regularly toured most western European countries, including Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Spain and Portugal. There was even a Word And Action team working in Berlin the night the Wall fell.  The Stories  Although at first the stories were performed and then discarded, in the early eighties the company began to create a record of these 'collective stories'. Arough this time, Gregory began to compile a number of them for comparison and critical analysis to see what value if any lay in any themes and patterns that might arise. Drawing from Jung and other work on symbolism he compiled a collection of 400 stories along with an accompanying commentary. The book, The Group Dream was eventually completed.You can download a short selection of these works here  Recruitment  Although the company did a range of other work from its Dorset base, Instant Theatre became the central feature of the company's from 1980 onwards. Most of the training took place on the job and people recruited came from a wide variety of back grounds. Some were trained in drama and acting, however most were not. Few drama schools and even fewer professional theatre train or work in the round. In addition, the intimate dynamic of Instant Theatre often proved very challenging for traditionally trained actors.

He was usually called Captain Sarlabous in Scottish and English letters of his time. A contemporary French writer calls him the \\"sieur de Sarlaboz.\\" Sarlabous is a place in the Hautes-Pyr√©n√©es where Corbeyran held lands. Born around 1515 in Gascony, his father was Odet de Cardaillac, seigneur de Sarlabous, and his mother, Jeanne de Binos, heiress of Bize or Vize. In Scotland The French garrison of Dunbar Castle guarded a strategic port Captain Sarlabous arrived in Scotland in 1549 under Paul de Thermes to resist the English in the war of the Rough Wooing. He was posted first at Dumbarton Castle, then made Captain of Dunbar in 1553. Henri Cleutin wrote to Mary of Guise saying he did not know Sarlabous personally but the appointment was at the recommendation of the Duke of Guise.A. Cameron ed., Balcarres Papers 1548-1557, (SHS, Edinburgh, 1925), 152-4, 164-5, 306 In August 1554 Sarlabous joined the Earl of Argyll at Dunstaffnage Castle in an unsuccessful expedition to Mull against James McConill, McClane, and their whole \\"folkis.\\"Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, SHS (1927), pp.388-9. On his return to France, in 1558 he served the Duke of Guise at the siege of Thionville. He returned to Scotland to resist the Scottish Reformation. John Knox and the Protestant Lords of the Congregation sent letters from Perth to \\"Serra La Burse\\" and other French soldiers on 22 May 1559, asking them to desist from attacking \\"us natural Scottishmen.\\"Works of John Knox: History of the Reformation in Scotland, vol.1 (1846), 238 Sarlabous and Henri Cleutin were confronted by a Protestant force of 3,000 at Cupar Muir in June, and on Christmas Day 1559 he took part in the recapture of Stirling Castle from the Lords of the Congregation. After Cleutin moved to Linlithgow, a spy for England reported that Sarlabous had 1,200 troops at Stirling under 5 'ensigns.' They marched into Fife and met with 400 more troops on 7 January 1560 who had sailed from Leith. According to Cleutin, they were attacked by 1,500 Protestants. A French cavalry charge won the day, and between 400 and 500 were killed.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.2 (1865), no.572 note, translating Teulet,vol.1, p.404. The young Earl of Arran reported this battle at Kinghorn differently as a skirmish, although the Earl of Sutherland was shot in the arm.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (1898), 280-2, \\"Charlebois\\" in index. John Knox adds that the French landing was at Pettycur Bay, and the Protestants were surprised by the arrival of the second French force from Stirling. Knox wrote there were few casualties as Lord Ruthven arrived with cavalry. A Protestant Dutchman and a French boy were captured and hung from Kinghorn steeple.Works of John Knox: History of the Reformation in Scotland, vol.2 (1848), 5-7 Sarlabous and his soldiers were attacked again on 30 January. Sarlabous was once again Captain of Dunbar, but joined in the defence of Leith.Foresti√© (1897), p.37-47, 57-61 quoting Teulet, Relations, vol.1, p.403. A Captain \\"Charlebois the younger\\" was killed at the siege of Leith in April. On 8 May, Corbeyran got a messenger from the Lords of the Congregation to carry a message in code from Leith back to a lady-in-waiting of Mary of Guise. At Dunbar on 5 June, he welcomed back a Captain Vigneau who had brought letters from France.Two Missions, 67, 147, 175 As part of the peace settlement of the Treaty of Edinburgh Sarlabous was appointed to remain at Dunbar with a reduced garrison of 60 men, while new additions to the fortifications there were to be dismantled or slighted. The townspeople of Dunbar reported to the Scottish council that Sarlabous hindered the work and had refurbished a cave used for storage within the area scheduled for demolition.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.3 (1865), no.409. Sarlabous was also seen at night on 17 August 1560 with four companions close to Berwick upon Tweed, a fortress town on the border held by the English. The commander Francis Leek heard that he had obtained a plan of the town.Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth, vol.3 (1865), no.471. Sarlebous offered a refuge to the fugitive Lord Semple within the castle, who had declared himself a servant of France and as such not a rebel to Scotland. Meanwhile, Castle Semple was besieged by the Earl of Arran. Sarlabous told the Scottish Captain Forbes who came for Semple that he doubted Elizabeth I of England would marry Arran. This marriage plan had been supported by the Scottish Reformation Parliament. He thought she would marry the King of Sweden and Arran would be allowed to marry Lady Catherine, daughter of the Duchess of Suffolk. Sarlabous laid a bet with Forbes of a horse worth 100 crowns that this rumour was true. The diplomat Thomas Randolph thought the story most unlikely, but he decided not to repeat it in Scotland, and got Forbes to promise to hold his tongue.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), 480-3 When Mary Queen of Scots arrived in Scotland, she found Sarlabous out of pocket for the expenses of the garrison, and she wrote to Charles IX of France asking for him to be paid. Some of the money was still outstanding in 1567. He returned to France at the end of September 1561.Foresti√© (1897), 63-64, 70-71, citing CSP Scotland, vol.1 Le Havre Already a gentleman of the King's chamber, and a knight of the royal order, Sarlabous was made Governor of the Port of Le Havre. There he fought the Huguenots in the French Wars of Religion, who were aided by a force sent by Elizabeth I of England in 1563 commanded by the Earl of Warwick. After the death of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley in February 1567, the Scottish spy Ninian Cockburn noted that Sarlabous was receiving more frequent communications from Scottish Catholics.CSP Foreign Elizabeth, vol.8 (1871), no.976. Although some historians have suggested that Sarlabous was directly involved in the assassination of Gaspard de Coligny, Edward Foresti√© points out he was in Le Havre in August 1572. He remained Governor of Le Havre until 1584. He died in 1585, and his heart was buried in the Convent of the Minimes in Tournai, which was founded by an ancestor. Family Sarlabous had a son with Elizabeth Anderson, Jean, who was born in 1561 and declared legitimate by the King of France when he was sixteen. The biographer Edward Foresti√© suggested that Elizabeth Anderson was a lady in waiting to Mary of Guise. He thought her surname may have been 'Henderson,' and she may have been a connection of the herald William Henderson, Dingwall Pursuivant. Equally, Elizabeth could have been a relative of the gunner and carpenter Henry Anderson, both men would have frequently been at the castle.Foresti√© (1897), 81: Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol. 10 (1913), 463, 515.

The LE would mark the brand's first front-wheel drive car since the 2004 Infiniti I35 if the car goes into production. A key feature of the LE is its inductive wireless charging. The vehicle can be charged by parking it over a charge point located in the floor, rather than plugging into an electrical outlet. However, the LE can also be charged through its CHAdeMO DC50kW quick charger. In June 2013, Infiniti CEO Johan de Nysschen said the Infiniti LE was on hold indefinitely as the Infiniti brand was attempting to triple sales by the 2017 fiscal year. In July 2013, Nissan's head of global planning Andy Palmer said the LE is \\"not significantly\\" on hold, but delayed \\"a little bit\\" so that Infiniti can incorporate some \\"interesting advances in electric technology\\" like new lithium ion battery technology that will increase range and lower the price.

Early days Visakha Wijeyeratne was born at Sirimedura, Horton Place Colombo 7 to Dr Edmund Ashoka Bulankulame and Ivy Dunuwille Senenayake. Her father was one of the first Ceylonese medical doctors to pass out from the prestigious University of Edinburgh in Scotland. The Bulankulame family were custodians of the Atamasthana and Dr Bulankulame held the high post of Atamasthana Nilame (chief lay custodian of Atamasthana) for a short term on behalf of his brother. Her mother, Ivy Dunuwille Senanayake, was the eldest daughter of D S Senanayake‚Äôs older brother, D C (Don Charles) Senanayake. She was the fourth in a family of seven and spent her childhood in Anuradhapura. Education She schooled at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya and Newstead Girls College, Negombo during the time when her father was in General Practice. Her post-secondary education was in Agriculture, Farming, Art History, Art and Foreign Languages. She followed these areas of study and practice over a period of seven years at the Farm School for girls in Kundasale, the Heywood Institute of Art under David Paynter, at the Alliance Francaise, Goethe Institute and at the Russian Cultural Centre. Artistic career Rangamma - The last Queen of Kandy Painting by Visakha Wijeyeratne Visakha Wijeyeratne was an ardent artist. Her style was a post-impressionistic style in oil on canvas - using primarily a yellow ochre base colour and building up layers until she finished her product. In 1967 she moved to St. Gallen, a city on the German side of Switzerland. Working and living alone, she trained in hand embroidery, and later headed the department at Schleifer‚Äôs, an acclaimed embroidery establishment founded in 1865. When she returned to Sri Lanka, she started a cottage industry to revive ancient Sinhala embroidery techniques, with Ananda Coomaraswamy‚Äôs ‚ÄúMedieval Sinhalese Art‚Äù as her primary source of inspiration. Her repertoire was in portraits and paintings of infants. In 1974, she discovered that the Sri Lankan art market did not appreciate her painting style, using heavy brushstrokes. She was forced to convert to a more realistic style, a transition she loathed. Her later landscapes and portraits had lost the effect of the heavy brushstrokes. In later years she developed a skill in water colour paintings of scenery and orchid flowers. Her skills lay in painting, sculpture, ceramic art, embroidery, writing, poetry and limerick composition. She taught hand embroidery to students and held language lessons in German, French, Russian and Sinhala. Visakha Wijeyerate was famous for one of the finest reproductions of the 1815 portrait of Rangamma, main consort of Kandy‚Äôs last king, Sri Wickreme Rajasinghe. Her other notable reproductions were of Fragonard‚Äôs ‚ÄúInspiration‚Äù; Carlo Dolci‚Äôs ‚ÄúSt. Cecilia‚Äùand Da Vinci‚Äôs ‚ÄúMona Lisa\\". In 1981, at her peak, she was commissioned to do the portrait of President J.R Jayawardene. Her most notable international exposure was in 1987 when she exhibited, along with 56 Commonwealth artists, at The Bhownagree Gallery of the Commonwealth Institute in Kensington, London. As diplomat‚Äôs wife As an artist, her impressionistic style was greatly appreciated in Paris, where she exhibited on three occasions during her four years as the Sri Lankan ambassador‚Äôs wife. Her paintings were bought by dignitaries in Paris and the diplomatic circle of the early 1970s. Buyers included US Under- Secretary of State, John N. Irwin II, German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Chilean Nobel laureate Pablo Neruda, Indonesia First Lady, Devi Sukarno, and British Liberal party leader, Jeremy Thorpe, to name a few.

Although the PFLP-GC and some other Palestinian factions continued low-level military activities on Lebanese soil, after 1982 the conflict is considered to have faded in favor of local inter-Lebanese Mountain War and the Israel‚ÄìHezbollah conflict. The South Lebanon Palestinian insurgency, which peaked through the 1970s, claimed thousands of Israeli, Lebanese and Palestinian military and civilian lives, and is considered among the key elements to start the Lebanese Civil War. History =PLO militancy begins= From 1968 onwards, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) began conducting raids from Lebanon into Israel, while Israel began making retaliatory raids into Lebanon and encourage the Lebanese factions to deal with the Palestinian fedayeen. After an Israeli airline was machine-gunned by Palestinian militants at Athens Airport, Israel bombed the Beirut International Airport in retaliation, destroying 13 civilian aircraft. The unarmed citizenry could not expel the armed foreigners, while the Lebanese army was too weak militarily and politically. The Palestinian camps came under Palestinian control after a series of clashes in 1968 and 1969 between the Lebanese military and the emerging Palestinian guerrilla forces. In 1969 the Cairo Agreement guaranteed refugees the right to work, to form self-governing committees, and to engage in armed struggle. \\"The Palestinian resistance movement assumed daily management of the refugee camps, providing security as well as a wide variety of health, educational, and social services.\\" On 8 May 1970, a PLO faction called the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) crossed into Israel and carried out the Avivim school bus massacre. =Black September and relocation to South Lebanon= In 1970, the PLO attempted to overthrow a reigning monarch, King Hussein of Jordan, and following his quashing of the rebellion in what Arab historians call Black September, the PLO leadership and their troops fled from Jordan to Syria and finally Lebanon, where cross-border violence increased. =Insurgency peaks through 1970s= Arafat in Lebanon, 1974 With headquarters moved to Beirut, PLO factions recruited new members from the Palestinian refugee camps. South Lebanon was nicknamed \\"Fatahland\\" due to the predominance there of Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization. With its own army operating freely in Lebanon, the PLO had created a state within a state. By 1975, more than 300,000 Palestinian displaced persons lived in Lebanon. Aside being used as an operation base for raids on Israel and against Israeli institutions across the world, the PLO and other Palestinian militant organizations also began a series of airplane hijack operations, targeting Israeli and international flights, carrying Israelis and Jews. The more profound effect on Lebanon was destabilization and increasing sectarian strife, which would eventually deteriorate into a full-blown civil war. In reaction to the 1972 Munich massacre, Israel carried out Operation Spring of Youth. Members of Israel's elite Special Forces landed by boat in Lebanon on 9 April 1973, and with the aid of Israeli intelligence agents, infiltrated the PLO headquarters in Beirut and assassinated several members of its leadership. In 1974, the PLO altered its focus to include political elements, necessary for a dialogue with Israel. Those who insisted on a military solution left to form the Rejectionist Front, and Yassir Arafat took over the PLO leadership role. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine ‚Äì General Command, which split from the PLO in 1974, carried out the Kiryat Shmona massacre in April of that year. In May 1974, the DFLP crossed again into Israel and carried out the Ma'alot massacre. =The Lebanese Civil War (first phase)= The Lebanese Civil War (1975‚Äì1990) was a complex conflict in the form of various factions and shifting alliances between and among Lebanese Maronite Catholics, Lebanese Muslims, Palestinians, Lebanese Druze, and other non- sectarian groups. Governmental power had been allotted among the different religious groups by the National Pact based partially on the results of the 1932 census. Changes in demographics and increased feelings of deprivation by certain ethnic groups, as well as Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian clashes in the south of the county all contributed to the outbreak of the Lebanese Civil War. Beginning in May 1976, Israel supplied the Maronite militias, including the Lebanese Forces, led by Bachir Gemayel, with arms, tanks, and military advisers. The border between Israel and Lebanon was at this time was nicknamed the Good Fence. Fearing loss of commercial access to the port of Beirut, in June 1976 Syria intervened in the civil war to support the Maronite dominated government, and by October had 40,000 troops stationed within Lebanon. The following year, however, Syria switched sides and began supporting the Palestinians. On 11 March 1978, eleven PLO militants made a sea landing in Haifa, Israel, where they hijacked a bus, full of people, killing those on board in what is known as the Coastal Road massacre. By the end of the day, nine hijackers and 37 Israeli civilians were killed. In response, on 14 March 1978, Israel launched Operation Litani occupying southern Lebanon, except for the city of Tyre, with 25,000 troops. The objective was to push the PLO away from the border and bolster a Lebanese Christian militia allied with Israel, the South Lebanese Army (SLA). On 22 April 1979, Samir Kuntar and three other members of the Palestine Liberation Front, a sometimes faction of the PLO, landed in Nahariya, Israel from Tyre, Lebanon by boat. After killing a police officer, who had discovered their presence, they took a father and his daughter hostage in an apartment building. After fleeing with the hostages from police back to the beach, a shootout killed one policeman and two of the militants. Kuntar then executed the hostages before he and the remaining invader were captured. In April 1981, the United States tried to broker a cease-fire in southern Lebanon among Israel, Syria and the PLO. In July 1981, Israel responded to PLO rocket attacks on northern Israeli settlements by bombing PLO encampments in southern Lebanon. United States envoy Philip Habib eventually negotiated a shaky cease-fire that was monitored by UNIFIL. =The 1982 war= The 1982 Lebanon war began on 6 June 1982, when Israel invaded again in direct retaliation over the assassination attempt by ANO (Abu Nidal organization), a splinter group from Fatah) on Shlomo Argov, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, attacking Palestinian military bases and refugee camps affiliated with Palestine Liberation Organization and other Palestinian military movements, including the ANO. During the conflict, over 17,000 Lebanese were killed,http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#Lebanon and the Israeli army laid siege to Beirut. During the war, fighting also occurred between Israel and Syria. The United States, fearing a widening conflict and the prestige the siege was giving PLO leader Yasser Arafat, got all sides to agree to a cease-fire and terms for the PLO's withdrawal on 12 August. The predominantly Muslim Multinational Force in Lebanon arrived to keep the peace and ensure PLO withdrawal. Arafat retreated from Beirut on 30 August 1982 and settled in Tunisia. Aftermath =PLO relocation to Tunisia= The 1982 Israeli invasion in support of Lebanese Christian militias resulted in the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) departure from Lebanon to Tunisia. The creation of Security Zone in South Lebanon has benefited civilian Israeli population as Galilee suffered lesser violent attacks (dozens civilians killed), than previously by PLO in the 1970s (hundreds of Israeli civilian casualties). The relocation of PLO bases to Tunisia resulted in deterioration of the Israeli-Tunisian ties, which had previously considered relatively tolerant. =Israel-Hezbollah conflict= Despite this Israeli success in eradicating PLO bases and partial withdraw in 1985, the Israeli invasion had actually increased the severity of conflict with local Lebanese militias and resulted in the consolidation of several local Shia Muslim movements in Lebanon, including Hezbollah and Amal, from a previously unorganized guerrilla movement in the south. Over the years, military casualties of both sides grew higher, as both parties used more modern weaponry, and Hezbollah progressed in its tactics. By the early 1990s, Hezbollah, with support from Syria and Iran, emerged as the leading group and military power, monopolizing the directorship of the guerrilla activity in South Lebanon.

Its sister paper was Riyadh Daily that was disestablished on 1 January 2004. Al Riyadh is one of the dominant papers in Nejd. History and ownership Al Riyadh is the first daily newspaper that was published in Arabic in Riyadh. Its first issue was published on 11 May 1965 with a limited number of pages. Later, it became a daily publication with 52 pages, 32 pages of which were colored pages. Its current issues are with 80-100 pages. The paper is published in broadsheet format. Al Riyadh is also pioneer in other aspects. It is the first Saudi paper that included caricatures which were drawn by Ali Kharjy, a then-leading caricaturist. It is argued that Al Riyadh gained popularity among the public due to these caricatures at the end of the 1960s. Al Riyadh is also the first Saudi newspaper to open a women's bureau. Al Riyadh is owned and published by Al Yamamah Press Establishment. The company is also the publisher of weekly magazine Al Yamamah. Political approach Al Riyadh is officially independent because it is being published by a private company. However, the World Association of Newspapers considered the paper to be under the direct influence of the then Crown Prince Salman. The association also regards Al Riyadh as a semi-official newspaper. It is further argued that the paper presents relatively conservative attitude and praises House of Saud as many of the other Saudi daily papers. Although Al Riyadh is usually regarded as a pro-government newspaper, it expresses relatively liberal views. Additionally, it publishes very influential editorials, if one wants to have good insight into what the Saudi official view on different matters. Content Al Riyadh employs the following news feeds: AFP Arabic, AFP Sports, AP, DPA Arabic, GPA Arabic, Kuwait News Agency Arabic, MENA Arabic, QNA Arabic, Saudi Press Agency Arabic, Reuters Arabic, Reuters Photos, Reuters Graphics, RSS news, and full-body feeds from PR Newswire, GNN Network and CCN Matthews. The paper heavily covers the news regarding political, social, religious, economic and cultural events. It also provides its readers with sports news. Turki Al Sudairi, the chief editor of the paper, argued in December 2011 that Iran was much more dangerous threat for Saudi Arabia than Israel, since the latter's enmity is limited to Palestinians. On 23 March 2012 Yousuf Al Kuwailit, the associate editor of Al Riyadh, questioned the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's stance concerning Syrian uprising and stated that Lavrov did not seem to be aware of the fact that Sunnis are the majority in Syria. Al Kuwailit further claimed that Lavrov had sided with the devil in this regard. In March 2013, the then Lebanese foreign minister Adnan Mansour publicly argued that the Arab League should reinstate Syria's membership. After this declaration, Al Riyadh described Mansour as \\"the foreign minister of the terrorist Amal Movement,\\" due to Mansour's close relations with the Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri, who is also the leader of the Amal. The daily further claimed that Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, is \\"a terrorist\\". Influence Al Riyadh is regarded as one of the major daily newspapers published in Saudi Arabia. The others are Al Watan, Al Madina and Al Jazirah. Al Riyadh competed with Al Jazirah for influence in Najd and each claimed to be a larger and more influential paper than the other at the beginning of the 1990s. Al Riyadh is described as one of the most respected dailies for local and regional news. Since the paper is edited and published in Riyadh, its target population is government officials, military officials, professionals, academics, businesspeople. Prominent columnists The chief editor of the paper is Turki Al Sudairi and has been for a long time. He is considered to be the most influential newspaper editor in Saudi Arabia. He is also regarded as a pro- government editor. Al Sudairi has been the chairman of the Saudi Journalists Association (SJA) for a long time, and he was elected again for the post on 17 May 2012. Sultan Al Bazie who is the executive vice president of International Public Relations Association-Gulf Chapter (IPRA GC) and co-founder CEO of Attariq Communications was formerly a reporter and managing editor for Al Riyadh. Abdulaziz bin Abdullah Al Uqaili who was the deputy chief of Royal Protocol formerly served at the paper's political desk. Circulation and offices The estimated circulation of Al Riyadh during the early 1990s was between 100,000 and 120,000 copies. In 2001 the paper had a circulation of 121,000 copies, being the third best selling Saudi newspaper. As for 2002, its estimated circulation was 91,000 copies. The estimated circulation of the daily in 2003 was 170,000 copies, making it the largest newspaper in the country. Arab Reform Bulletin gives its 2004 circulation as 170,000. Its 2006 and 2007 circulations were reported to be 150,000 copies. Global Investment House reported that Al Riyadh's 2009 market share is about 8.3%. The paper has a very impressive website, where readers can comment on articles. The website won the digital excellence award in the second rank after Al Jazirah by the Saudi ministry of Communications and Information Technology in 2007. Al Riyadh has also an English-website which was the seventh top on-line newspaper among the fifty English-language online newspapers in the MENA region in 2010. In 2011, it was again among top ten online newspapers, keeping its rank as the seventh. The paper's Arabic online version was the fifth most visited website for 2010 in the MENA region. In 2012, it was again ranked to be the fifth in the MENA region by Forbes Middle East with 123.9 million hits. Al Riyadh has offices in many Saudi cities in addition to its editorial offices in Cairo and Beirut.

In general terms it means a legal action initiated in the court of law for the protection of Public Interest.Nature and Importance of Public Interest Litigation, available at Learning the Law. It is not a body of law or a legal field, matters lawyers work on. Rather, it denotes the clientele they represent. Instead of serving powerful economic interests, it stands for the advocacy of otherwise under- represented or vulnerable individuals, especially those living in poverty. It has grown to encompass a broader range of activities, typically the field of non-lawyers like civil rights, civil liberties, women's rights, consumer rights, environmental protection, and so on. Nevertheless, a common ethic for public-interest lawyers in a growing number of countries remains ‚Äúfighting for the little guy‚Äù.Scott L. Cummings & Ingrid V. Eagly, After Public Interest Law, NWU L. Rev. 1251, 1251-1259, 2075-2077(2006)  By jurisdiction  =Central and Eastern Europe = At the end of the communist period in the early 1990s, the national legal systems of Central and Eastern Europe were still in a formative stage. The most important source of legal authority for the new human rights groups came from outside the region: the Council of Europe, with its European Convention on Human Rights, and the European Court of Human Rights.Edwin Rekosh, Constructing Public Interest Law: Transnational Collaboration and Exchange in Central and Eastern Europe, 13 UCLA J. Int'l L.& For. Aff.55, 80-82 Over time, in the mid-1990s, U.S. experiences became more relevant. The Council of Europe's prerequisite that lawyers use their own country's courts first to seek legal remedies before turning to the European bodies gradually became more than a pro forma exercise, and civil society organizations began to make more effective use of domestic means of adjudication. But by the time local activists were ready to consider the utility of impact litigation, test cases, and other tactics familiar from the U.S. experience, they already understood that their ultimate tactical weapon in any piece of litigation was to use the threat or reality of a supportive decision at the European Court of Human Rights. With this background in mind, it made more sense for the promoters of public interest law in Central and Eastern Europe to talk about \\"strategic litigation\\" than about public interest litigation. Using the instrumentality of the European Court of Human Rights effectively required a strategic approach. Not all human rights cases were likely to receive a favorable ruling; a negative ruling could produce more damage to the human rights cause than no ruling at all. The European Court had a rich case law that could provide clues to how a future case might be decided, and there were procedural aspects, such as the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies, to consider. The core lesson from the U.S. experience for local activists was how courts could be used effectively as a tool for civil society engagement in governance. = Italy = The changes to the Italian electoral law from 2014 to 2017 were both \\"caused by actions born from the bottom (...) the result of a methodical, studied and concerted action. It has been featured by university professors, constitutional and electoral law- makers, parliamentarians and other elected representatives (...), representatives of civil society and ordinary citizens. Their names are, as voters, in more than twenty introductory pleadings (quotations or appeals)\\", Gabriele Maestri, ORIZZONTI DI TECNICA ELETTORALE: PROBLEMI SUPERATI, IRRISOLTI ED EMERSI ALLA LUCE DELLA SENTENZA N. 35 DEL 2017, Nomos, n. 2/2017. all of them brought pro bono. =China (mainland)= Public interest law (ÂÖ¨ÁõäÊ≥ï) is an accepted term in China, where the basic institutions supporting the rule of law are still extremely nascent. China does not have a common-law system in which lawyers are expected to play a key role in ‚Äúmaking law.‚Äù Nevertheless, a small but effective community of lawyers has gained acceptance of public interest litigation as a legitimate means of resolving social issues and contributing to a harmonious society, and non-governmental actors have significantly improved the enforcement of rights for migrant workers, women, children and those suffering from environmental degradation, among others. For example, public interest lawyers in China have filed lawsuits in court successfully challenging workplace sexual harassment and the involuntary confinement of healthy people to mental hospitals.Congressional-Executive Commission on China, 2011 Annual Report, Parts II and III (October 10, 2011), available at ; see generally R.P. Peerenboom, China's Long March toward Rule of Law (Cambridge University Press, 2002) Chinese reformers believe that one avenue for speeding the development of public interest law is implementing an associational standing rule by which organizations can instigate lawsuits to protect the interests of its members. Currently, China's Civil Procedure Law is undergoing revision. One of the proposed amendments would create a form of associational standing. In theory, the new law would give domestic NGOs the power to file lawsuits in their own name on behalf of their members, but the proposed amendment has engendered spirited debate and its fate is unclear. =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong public interest law is an emerging field. The chief vehicle for pursuing public interest claims is judicial review. This is the process by which decisions of the government are challenged in the courts. There has been a surge in judicial review cases since 2000. Environmental issuesSee for example, Society for Protection of the Harbour Ltd v Town Planning Board [2004] 1 HKLRD 396; Clean Air Foundation Ltd v The Government of the HKSAR [2007] HKEC 1356. and minority rightsSee for example, W v Registrar of Marriages [2013] HKCFA 39; Vallejos Evangeline Banao v Commissioner of Registration & Anor [2013] HKCFA 17. are among the most litigated areas. One of the pioneers in public interest law in Hong Kong was Pamela Baker. In the late 1980s she litigated a series of landmark courtroom cases challenging the government's treatment of Vietnamese refugees.Robertson, Geoffrey. \\"Pam Baker\\", \\"The Guardian\\", Saturday 27 April 2002. Retrieved 4 April 2014. In 1995 the Hong Kong Human Rights Monitor was established with the aim of promoting better human rights protection in Hong Kong. Today, the majority of cause lawyers who represent citizens and social groups in human rights and public policy litigation on a consistent basis in Hong Kong are also members of political parties or active participants in social movements outside the courts.Tam, Waikeung. \\"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong\\" 3 [2010] 35 Law & Social Inquiry 663, 664. In Hong Kong, the Legal Aid Department provides funding to legal services for those who pass the means and merits test. The two Legal Aid Schemes that it operates, namely the Ordinary Legal Aid Scheme (OLAS) and the Supplementary Legal Aid Scheme (SLAS) have facilitated the practice of public interest law through narrowing the resource inequality between economically disadvantaged litigants and the government.Tam, Waikeung. \\"Political Transition and the Rise of Cause Lawyering: The Case of Hong Kong\\" 3 [2010] 35 Law & Social Inquiry 663, 673. However, NGOs and charitable organizations are not eligible to get legal aid.Kong, Karen. \\"Costs in Public Interest Litigation: Whose Pocket Should be Picked?\\" 39 HKLJ 767, 768. The NGOs and Charitable organizations contributed to opening of avenues for people who deserved justice but lacked interest to approach courts and helped them in becoming petitioners to get justice. Apart from legal aid, the Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong jointly provides the Duty Lawyer Scheme which offers free legal representation to eligible defendants on the first day of court appearance. They also run the Free Legal Advice Scheme at their Legal Advice Centres within nine District Offices in Hong Kong with the aim to provide one- off preliminary legal advice to the general public without imposing any means test. The Hong Kong Bar Association and The Law Society of Hong Kong operate their own Bar Free Legal Service Schemearchived and Free Legal Consultation Scheme respectively where enrolled law firms and barristers specializing in different fields volunteer to give consultations on a pro bono basis.Chung, Eugenie. \\"Why Hong Kong Needs a Pro Bono Clearinghouse\\" 40 [2010] HKLJ 719, 731-732. In addition, unlike in the United States where NGOs and public interest law groups routinely bring public interest lawsuits on behalf of aggrieved individuals, in-house counsel working in NGOs and charities in Hong Kong are not allowed to directly represent the people these organizations serve.Precht, Robert. \\"More public interest lawyers can help ease Hong Kong's social tensions, South China Morning Post (17 September 2013). Retrieved 4 April 2014. Some commentators believe that the inability of NGOs to directly represent clients in legal proceedings has dampened the growth of public interest law in Hong Kong. Law schools in Hong Kong also organize various programs to promote the idea of pro bono legal service to students. Pro bono committees of law firms in Hong Kong also meet on a bimonthly basis in the Hong Kong Legal Community Roundtable, a forum for international law firms to discuss development of pro bono work in Hong Kong and the region.Mayer Brown LLP, \\"Pro Bono Update\\" (Spring 2010), page 19. =India= \\"Public Interest Litigation\\" or PIL right since its inception in the Indian judicial system, has shown some good examples of safeguarding the rights of the people of India and has strengthened the position of the Supreme Court of India as preeminent guardian of Fundamental Rights enumerated in the Indian Constitution. It was introduced in India around 1979-80 by the Supreme Court judges, Justice V. R. Krishna Iyer along with Justice P. N. Bhagwati. And since then there had been instances when the Courts are keen to decide the matters of public importance without delay, as the case in Shyam sundar where the court accepted the matter even when the application was made by a letter sent through post. = South Africa = South Africa has seen significant public interest litigation throughout its constitutional history. During colonial and apartheid rule, public interest litigation was used as a tool of struggle to resist unjust laws. During the late apartheid period from 1979, three public interest organisations were formed: the Legal Resources Centre, the Centre for Applied Legal Studies and Lawyers for Human Rights. Despite the hostile political environment and a legal system that was inimical to public interest lawyering, they achieved some notable successes opposing forced removals and contesting the system of pass laws and other racist laws. However, even as early as the late 19th century, litigation had been used as a strategy for resistance, especially by early black lawyers, many of whom were among the founders of the African National Congress. Following the transition to democracy, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa introduced radical changes to the legal system that have facilitated public interest litigation, including a justiciable Bill of Rights, broad rules of standing and flexible remedial powers for courts. Since 1995, the South African public interest litigation sector has grown, with a number of specialist organisations being established, alongside the older generalist organisations. South Africa has since seen extensive public interest lawyering seeking to give effect to the transformative promise of the Constitution, in particular to enforce socio- economic rights and shore up democratic institutions. =United States= Brandeis (center) in his office 1916. ‚ÄúPublic interest law‚Äù is a term that became widely adopted in the United States during and after the social turmoil of the 1960s. It built on a tradition exemplified by Louis Brandeis, who before becoming a U.S. Supreme Court justice incorporated advocacy for the interests of the general public into his legal practice. In a celebrated 1905 speech, Brandeis decried the legal profession, complaining that ‚Äúable lawyers have to a large extent allowed themselves to become adjuncts of great corporations and have neglected their obligation to use their powers for the protection of the people.‚Äù Edwin Rekosh, et al.,ed. \\"Pursuing the Public Interest, A Handbook for Legal Professionals and Activists\\" (Scott L. Cummings, The Politics of Pro Bono, 52 UCLA L. Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004) In the late 1960s and 1970s, large numbers of American law school graduates began to seek ‚Äúrelevance‚Äù in their work‚Äîwishing to affect the social issues that were so visibly and hotly debated within American society at that time. They defined themselves as public interest lawyers in order to distinguish themselves from the ‚Äúcorporate adjuncts‚Äù referred to by Brandeis.Rekosh, supra; See also Joel F. Handler, Ellen Jane Hollingsworth & Howard S. Erlanger, Lawyers and the Pursuit of Legal Rights 24-39 (1978); Note, The New Public Interest lawyers, 79 Yale L.J. 1069, 1069-70 (1970) Summing up the movement's history in the United States, Stanford University Law Professor Deborah Rhode writes: \\"Public interest lawyers have saved lives, protected fundamental rights, established crucial principles, transformed institutions, and ensured essential benefits for those who need them most....In virtually every major American social reform movement of the last half century, public interest lawyers have played an important role.\\"Deborah L.Rhode, Public Interest Law: the Movement and Midlife, 60 Stan.L.Rev. 1, 13-14 (2004) Public interest law is institutionalized in the United States. Nongovernmental organizations that work to promote and protect human rights using the U.S. legal system, fight to protect the environment, or advocate on behalf of consumers, call themselves public interest law organizations. A large community of lawyers practices public interest law in the form of providing legal aid free of charge to those who cannot afford to pay for it. However, the grim reality remains that lawyers are underpaid and grossly overworked, offering perfunctory representation. Clinical legal education, which is well established in the United States, provides opportunities for law students to do practical legal work on basic legal matters as well as more complex public interest issues, such as women's rights, anti-discrimination law, constitutional rights, and environmental protection, among others. Some law schools have public interest law centers, which advise law students interested in pursuing public interest law careers. Pro bono programs at bar associations and law firms provide opportunities for commercial lawyers to donate time to public interest law activities. =United Kingdom= In law, public interest is a defence against certain lawsuits (for instance some libel suits in the United Kingdom) and an exemption from certain laws or regulations (for instance freedom of information laws in the UK). Also, judges in common law systems can make judgements on the grounds of public policy, a related term.

In this state he served the Collector of Darbhanga, Saharsa,Finance Secretary and Chief Secretary. While on deputation from the state to the federal government, he served as the Land Reforms Commissioner in the Ministry of Agriculture and the Planning Commission from 1970 to 1975. He opted for voluntarily retirement from service in 1982 while holding the post of Director of LBSNAA. As Chairman of the Committee on Land Reforms set up by the Planning Commission, he created a sensation by stating bluntly in 1972 that lack of political will was the reason for failure of land reforms in India. He became Chief Secretary of Bihar but left for a lower paid job in the Government of India when he found that the conditions he had stipulated for functioning effectively were not being observed by the political executive. As Director of Government of India's National Academy of Administration he took voluntary retirement on finding that the government would not punish a trainee guilty of reprehensible conduct. That led to such an uproar in Parliament that Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had to overrule Home Minister Giani Zail Singh and announced dismissal of the guilty trainee officer from the IAS.

It premiered on September 13, 2012 and is produced by 20th Century Fox Television, Ryan Murphy Television and Brad Falchuk Teley-Vision with executive producers Dante Di Loreto and series co- creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan. The series features the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio. The fourth season continues in Lima with a new generation of students but will also follow some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club competing on the show choir circuit, while its members, faculty and alumni deal with sex, bulimia, gender identity, child molestation, dyslexia, school violence, pregnancy scares and other social issues. As of the season premiere, fourteen main cast members retained that status from the third season: glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), glee club members Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale), Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss), Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz), and Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris), and graduates Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera) and Noah \\"Puck\\" Puckerman (Mark Salling). Previously recurring character Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet), a glee club member, was promoted to the main cast in the fourth season. Dianna Agron, who played Quinn Fabray, appeared less frequently in the season than in previous ones, as did some of the other graduates, including Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Mike Chang (Harry Shum Jr.), and Noah Puckerman (Mark Salling), despite still being credited as main cast members for this season. Agron and Jayma Mays, who continued to appear as guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury, were credited as guest stars this season rather than as series regulars. This season marked the final appearance of Cory Monteith on the show before his death on July 13, 2013. The season was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards including one for Lynch's performance as Sue Sylvester and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Episodes Production =Development= The fourth season continued with McKinley High in Lima, Ohio as the primary setting, while also following several of the just-graduated characters to New York City and the fictional performing arts school (NYADA). The Ohio portion of the show featured a number of new characters. Co-creator Ryan Murphy had confirmed that all regular cast members from the third season will be returning to the show for its fourth season, though \\"it doesn't mean everyone will be doing 22 episodes\\". Fox announced on May 14, 2012, that Glee would be moving to Thursday nights at 9 pm ET for the fourth season. Episodes aired after that evening's 8 pm ET music competition \\"results\\" shows‚ÄîThe X Factor in the fall and American Idol in midseason. The season premiered on September 13, 2012 with the second episode of the season serving as the show's second Britney Spears tribute, featuring eight of her songs. In the UK, Glee airs as part of Sky 1 Sundays at 8pm and broadcast began on January 6, 2013. Some changes were made to the show's writing staff. Marti Noxon announced that she would no longer be a writer or consulting producer on the show, and co-executive producer and writer Ali Adler stated that she would be scaling back her work on Glee to focus on her new NBC comedy The New Normal, which she co-created with Murphy. On July 14, 2012, Glee attended the San Diego Comic-Con in California. Co-creator Brad Falchuk revealed that Damian McGinty (Rory) would not be returning in the fall but stated he could return in the spring. Falchuk announced that Vanessa Lengies (Sugar) and Samuel Larsen (Joe) would be returning. Falchuk also had aspirations to bring back Alex Newell (Wade) at some point during Season 4. Other season details include the following: Sue had her baby when Season 4 commenced; episodes alternated between Ohio and New York, much like McKinley High and Dalton Academy in Season 2; and Kurt (Chris Colfer) remained in Ohio before moving to New York. Brad Falchuk also revealed that Will (Matthew Morrison) and Emma (Jayma Mays) would still be engaged when the season began, and he went on to state there would be many new faces during the season, also commenting that Rachel would have a roommate and new friends in New York. Season 4 featured a teaming up of Coach Roz (NeNe Leakes) and Sue (Jane Lynch) to take down Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba). On July 31, 2012, executive producer Murphy revealed on his Twitter account that the first group number of the season would be a cover of Adele's \\"Chasing Pavements\\". Murphy also tweeted that there would be an episode titled \\"The Break-Up\\" and a two- part Thanksgiving episode in which the Sectionals competition will take place. Murphy also stated that the show would be doing another Christmas episode this season. Executive producer Falchuk stated that Season 4 will not revolve around relationships as much as past seasons, commenting, \\"Relationships in general will be less of a focus this year, I personally think a lot of these characters are more interesting not in relationships. And I think with a lot of them we will be exploring that. Whether they break up or not, we‚Äôre really focused on giving them more individual stories.\\" =Filming= Season four of Glee began filming on Tuesday, July 24, 2012. A substantial amount of exterior shots depicting New York City were shot on location in that city. Studio recording for the season began earlier, by July 19, 2012, with Jenna Ushkowitz and Heather Morris recording on that day.

It was also known as the South Yorkshire Asylum (1872‚Äì1888), the West Riding Asylum, Wadsley (1889‚Äì1929) and Wadsley Mental Hospital (1930‚Äì1948). It was one of four hospitals that made up The West Riding General Asylums Committee. It closed in 1996 and is now a private housing development called Wadsley Park Village. History =Construction and expansion= In 1866 the West Riding County Asylum at Wakefield had 1,130 beds and was suffering from overcrowding, having trebled in size in the previous 25 years. It was decided by the Hospital Committee to assign a subcommittee to find a suitable site in South Yorkshire for a second asylum. The site committee which was chaired by Lord Wharncliffe (later to become the Earl of Wharncliffe) reported that the only suitable site was at Wadsley Park, 3.5 miles north west of the centre of Sheffield, this was an area of open farmland which had previously been part of the Wharncliffe Estate. Work on levelling the land on the sloping site took place in 1868 and building commenced on the construction of the South Yorkshire Asylum in the summer of 1869 with the architectural plans being mainly drawn up by Bernard Hartley, the West Riding surveyor from 1868 to 1884. The initial plan was for the hospital to have 400 beds, this was quickly upgraded to 630 by the Home Secretary and then again to 750 in the final plans. The asylum was declared open on 21 August 1872 with the official opening ceremony taking place on 7 September of that year. The construction of the hospital church was completed in 1875 at a cost of ¬£6,000. In 1893 a nurses' home was built on site. The Lodge on Middlewood Road is now part of a nursery During the First World War the hospital became the Wharncliffe War Hospital with all mental patients sent to other hospitals across the north of England in March 1915 and 1,500 beds then being made available to the War Office for the treatment of sick and wounded soldiers. King George V toured the War Hospital in September 1915 during a visit to Sheffield. The War Hospital closed in July 1920 having dealt with an estimated 37,000 casualties since the start of the war. The hospital was once more utilised for emergency use during the Second World War, with one third of its accommodation being designated The Wharncliffe Emergency Hospital and made available to treat military casualties. This continued as a small general medical unit after the war called 'Wharncliffe Hospital', providing medical and surgical facilities until the mid-1970s. Post-war developments saw the hospital integrated into the National Health Service (NHS) and renamed Middlewood Hospital. It continued to be the designated mental health accommodation for South Yorkshire with over 2,000 beds.\\"A History Of Middlewood Psychiatric Hospital\\", F.T. Thorpe =Run down and closure= By the 1970s it became clear that future psychiatric treatment would be based on general hospital units, day care facilities and other services provided by local authorities, and by 1984 the hospital‚Äôs management team were planning the running down of the hospital. In 1986 the number of patients at Middlewood had reduced to 600 as a community oriented service was developed in conjunction with the NHS and Sheffield City Council. The implementation of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 reinforced the provision of community based mental health care by the NHS and the local authority and Middlewood Hospital was listed for closure within five years. It finally closed in 1996. The Kingwood ward has been converted into 85 apartments. =Redevelopment= After its closure, the land of the former Middlewood Hospital was purchased for residential development by Bloor Homes. It was sold off to various other developers such as Redrow, Barratt, Harron Homes, Wimpey and PJ Livesey although Bloor‚Äôs were the major house builder for the new Wadsley Park estate which was constructed on the site of the old hospital. The Wadsley Park village consists of a mixture of houses and apartments of various sizes. Some of the old hospital structures were designated as listed buildings, the main admin block (the clock tower), Kingswood ward, the church and the porters lodge were all grade II listed and could not be demolished with the rest of the hospital. The administration building and clock tower were converted into 38 luxury apartments by Urbani after permission to demolish the building was denied and the building is now known as Middlewood Lodge. The Kingswood ward has been converted into 85 apartments by developers PJ Livesey and is known as Kingswood Hall. The porter's lodge on Middlewood Road has been refurbished and is now a nursery. The hospital church has been derelict for many years, it held its last service on 6 November 1996 to mark the closure of the hospital. In March 2012 plans were submitted by architectural design consultancy Coda Studios that may see the Victorian church converted into a mixture of town houses and apartments. The scheme which needs approval from Sheffield City Council also contains proposals for a selection of partially underground eco-friendly bungalows beneath the building. = Wadsley Fossil Forest = Wadsley Fossil Forest Interpretation Board and replica cast of a fossil tree stump About a year after the South Yorkshire Lunatic Asylum opened, in the autumn of 1873, workmen, excavating the hillside to create level access ground at the back of the asylum, uncovered the remains of a group of large fossilised tree stumps, complete with roots, preserved in hard sandstone. The stumps display long roots on one side and short on the other, which scientists at the time considered an indication of the ancient wind direction. The discovery was judged so significant that in 1875, under the direction of the eminent Sheffield scientist Henry Clifton Sorby, two sheds with large windows were built to protect the biggest stumps from the weather and allow visitors to view the fossils. Over time the sheds and the fossil stumps fell into disrepair so that by the time of the closure of the hospital the fossil stumps had weathered into mounds of earth and exposed to loss of material by souvenir hunters. Wadsley Fossil Forest contains what is considered to be the best preserved example in the British Isles of trees which were part of the extensive coal forming swamp forests growing about 310 million years ago during the Westphalian stage of the Carboniferous Period. Such preserved stumps provide a useful insight into the growth-habit of arborescent clubmosses and into the community structure of the forest. They also clarify details of how the trees were killed and how they became entombed in the sediment. The site is thus of considerable palaeobotanical interest. When the site of Middlewood Hospital was redeveloped as Wadsley Park Village, the fossil tree stumps were saved from the bulldozer as they have a special preservation order to protect them (Site of Special Scientific Interest status). Following a scientific study project at the time of house construction they are now buried under open space adjacent to Middlewood Drive.

In the first round of the 2012 Presidential election, Tibilov received 42.5% of the vote to lead David Sanakoyev. In the second round, Tibilov was elected president with 54% of the vote. In a move towards integration with the Russian Federation, Tibilov proposed in December 2015 a name change to \\"South Ossetia‚ÄìAlania\\" ‚Äî in analogy with \\"North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania\\", a Russian federal subject.

However, on 30 May, Tibilov postponed the referendum until after the presidential election due in April 2017.

The battle, which took place around present-day Jiangling County, Hubei, was an integral part of the Wei emperor Cao Pi's three-pronged campaign against the Wu leader Sun Quan. It spanned a period of about six months from October 222 to April 223. Of the three fronts, the most critical Wei attacks were concentrated against the Wu fortress at Jiangling. Background When Liu Bei attacked Sun Quan in the Battle of Xiaoting of 221‚Äì222, Sun Quan sent his envoys with gifts to relate his wish to submit to Cao Pi, who in 220 ended the Eastern Han dynasty and established the state of Wei. As such, Sun Quan nominally became a vassal under Wei, but actually operated his Wu regime independently like he used to. Cao Pi's adviser Liu Ye suggested to his lord to attack Sun Quan while the latter was fighting Liu Bei, but Cao Pi rejected the proposal because he needed Sun Quan's submissive posture to solidify his authority as the legitimate founder of a new dynasty. After Sun Quan defeated Liu Bei around October 222 at the Battle of Xiaoting, Cao Pi began to make plans on taking advantage on Sun Quan, despite opposition from Liu Ye.(ÂÇôËªçÊïóÈÄÄÔºåÂê≥Á¶ÆÊï¨ËΩâÂª¢ÔºåÂ∏ùÊ¨≤ËààÁúæ‰ºê‰πãÔºåÊõÑ‰ª•ÁÇ∫„ÄåÂΩºÊñ∞ÂæóÂøóÔºå‰∏ä‰∏ãÈΩäÂøÉÔºåËÄåÈòªÂ∏∂Ê±üÊπñÔºåÂøÖÈõ£ÂÄâÂçí„ÄÇ„ÄçÂ∏ù‰∏çËÅΩ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 14. Wei troops were mobilised in late October or November 222, and Cao Pi repeatedly requested Sun Quan to send his firstborn son to Wei as a hostage, prompting Sun Quan to send a humble letter of apology.(Áßã‰πùÊúàÔºåÈ≠è‰πÉÂëΩÊõπ‰ºë„ÄÅÂºµÈÅº„ÄÅËáßÈú∏Âá∫Ê¥ûÂè£ÔºåÊõπ‰ªÅÂá∫Êø°È†àÔºåÊõπÁúü„ÄÅÂ§è‰æØÂ∞ö„ÄÅÂºµÈÉÉ„ÄÅÂæêÊôÉÂúçÂçóÈÉ°„ÄÇÊ¨äÈÅ£ÂëÇÁØÑÁ≠âÁù£‰∫îËªçÔºå‰ª•ËàüËªçÊãí‰ºëÁ≠âÔºåË´∏ËëõÁëæ„ÄÅÊΩòÁíã„ÄÅÊ•äÁ≤≤ÊïëÂçóÈÉ°ÔºåÊú±Ê°ì‰ª•Êø°È†àÁù£Êãí‰ªÅ„ÄÇÊôÇÊèö„ÄÅË∂äË†ªÂ§∑Â§öÊú™Âπ≥ÈõÜÔºåÂÖßÈõ£Êú™Âº≠ÔºåÊïÖÊ¨äÂçëËæ≠‰∏äÊõ∏ÔºåÊ±ÇËá™ÊîπÂé≤Ôºå\\"Ëã•ÁΩ™Âú®Èõ£Èô§ÔºåÂøÖ‰∏çË¶ãÁΩÆÔºåÁï∂Â•âÈÇÑÂúüÂú∞Ê∞ë‰∫∫„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 47. However, Sun Quan could not agree on sending his son to Cao Pi, which ended the peace negotiations and started the war. Cao Xiu was ordered by Cao Pi to attack Dongkou and Cao Ren was entrusted to take Ruxu; Cao Zhen and Xiahou Shang were put in charge of taking Jiangling (present-day Jingzhou City, Hubei), the capital of Nan Commandery and Jing Province. In November 222, Sun Quan adopted Huangwu (ÈªÉÊ≠¶) as the era name of his reign, and formally declared independence from Wei. The battle =Wei's advancement= When the armies were moving onto Wu, Sun Quan tried to arrange diplomatic agreements between himself and Wei, but they were all rejected. The only other choice was to send an envoy to Liu Bei, which succeeded. The first objective of the Wei forces was to attack and capture Nan Commandery, which would open up the opportunity to capture Jiangling. The forces of Wei were dispatched from possibly Xiangyang and Fancheng. Cao Zhen, Xiahou Shang and Zhang He attacked Jiangling County,(...

At this time, it was very critical and uneasy for the Wu forces, since the commander, Zhu Ran was in control of a very low number of troops. Quickly, the Wei forces overran the Wu forces at Nan Commandery, after Zhang He defeated Sun Sheng (Â≠´Áõõ). The Wei forces then made way to assist the main army's siege of Jiangling County. =Siege of Jiangling= The forces led by Zhang He immediately used the south side of the Yangtze below Jiangling County and the north banks to build pontoon bridges to cut off supplies from the Wu commander Zhu Ran, whose forces were shut inside the city. Zhu Ran also had to face the task of keeping order within the city. For example, when the city was running low on its water supply, some civilians and soldiers tried to surrender to Wei by opening the gates, but Zhu Ran put an end to the plot. However, the position where the Wei forces set up the pontoon bridges was too exposed to be maintained by the Wei forces. Soon, another batch of Wu reinforcements led by Zhuge Jin and Yang Can (Ê•äÁ≤≤) arrived.(Ë´∏ËëõÁëæ„ÄÅÊ•äÁ≤≤‰∏¶ÊúÉÂÖµËµ¥ÊïëÔºåÊú™Áü•ÊâÄÂá∫ÔºåËÄåÈ≠èÂÖµÊó•Ê∏°‰∏çÁµï„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55.

Pan Zhang then ordered his men to move to 50 li upstream from the Wei army's location. They cut down and bundled together large quantities of reeds from the river to make big rafts, and sent them afloat down the river towards the pontoon bridges. The reeds were set on fire, therefore burning down the pontoon bridges to a crisp.(‰æøÂ∞áÊâÄÈ†òÔºåÂà∞È≠è‰∏äÊµÅ‰∫îÂçÅÈáåÔºå‰ºêËë¶Êï∏ÁôæËê¨ÊùüÔºåÁ∏õ‰ΩúÂ§ßÁ≠èÔºåÊ¨≤È†ÜÊµÅÊîæÁÅ´ÔºåÁáíÊïóÊµÆÊ©ã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. The Wu forces then executed a counterattack on the Wei forces. The conflict would go on six months well into April 223 before a plague broke out in the Wei camp, causing the Wei forces to withdraw from the siege in defeat. By early summer 223, Cao Pi had already returned to the capital at Luoyang. Aftermath During the time of the withdrawal from Jiangling, the battles at Dongkou and Ruxu also ended in failure for the Wei side and they withdrew as well.

It is currently the tallest attraction at Kings Dominion if measured by the top of the structure. It is the 4th tallest if measured by the observation platform with Drop Tower, Intimidator 305 and WindSeeker being taller. It is constructed of 450 tons of steel. Elevators in the replica were installed by Haushahn Elevator of Austria with subsequent modernizations and upgrades in recent years. Kings Island The Eiffel Tower at Kings Island was built by Southern Ohio Fabricators, and designed by Intamin Inc. It is the centerpiece of the park, located in the International Street section of the park, just beyond the fountains at the main entrance. It is currently the largest attraction at Kings Island if measured by the top of the structure. If measured by the observation platform, it is one foot shy of Drop Tower for being the tallest. 15,000 bolts hold together the structure with 410 steps leading to the top.

He studied Electrical Engineering at Purdue. After working at his family furniture store for eleven years, he followed his brother (astronomer Samuel J. Goldstein, Jr.) to California and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He is married to Ruth Goldstein (n√©e Lowenstam). As a graduate student at Caltech in 1961, Goldstein used the antenna at the Goldstone Tracking Station to obtain the first realtime radar echos from the planet Venus. By 1963, Goldstein and co-author had measured the period and retrograde rotation of Venus. Using his same techniques, he confirmed Soviet experiments that acquired radar echoes from Mercury and he was first to obtain echos from Mars in 1963. In 1968, Goldstein was the first to obtain a radar echo from an asteroid, when he measured the radar cross section of Icarus. Later he also measured the size and rotational period of the nucleus of a comet. In 1964, Goldstein had analyzed the spectrum of radar echos from Venus to obtain the first images of features on the surface of that planet. Later, using range- Doppler and radar interferometric techniques, he was able to create some of the first maps of the planet. Goldstein was also first to get echos from Ganymede and later other moons of Jupiter. He also detected Saturn‚Äôs rings using radar. Goldstein began work in the mid 1980s on topographical mapping techniques using synthetic aperture radar. Initially using two antennas (and later a single antenna with a repeated track), he was able to use the phase interferometry to improve over stereoscopic optical mapping techniques. Goldstein then developed his revolutionary \\"crabgrass growing\\" algorithm for phase unwrapping, which resolves ambiguities in phase data and isolates local noise and errors that would otherwise cause global errors. This algorithm simplified the creation of accurate elevation maps, and made possible many new applications for radar interferometry, including satellite detection and quantification of small changes such as land subsidence, ice flow motion, ocean currents, and geological fault shifts. Subsequent work includes algorithms for mitigating thermal noise in the phase data, yielding dramatic improvements in the quality of measurement and phase data. In the 1990s, Goldstein also worked on applying radar techniques for detecting orbital debris. Previous radar approaches were able to detect orbiting objects as small as 5mm. By using short wavelength pulses and a separate antenna to detect echos, Goldstein was able to improve the detection of objects to less than 2mm at a 600 km altitude. In the process, he discovered that the Earth has rings of debris (some apparently left over from the West Ford Project). He has continued to refine the technique, extending the capabilities to detect 3mm objects as far away as 3200 km. Goldstein is a regular participant and frequent award-winner in the annual JPL Invention Challenge.

The Territory of Cura√ßao officially became the Netherlands Antilles on 15 December 1954 although the national football team played under the name of Cura√ßao until 1958. History =Getting organized= In 1921 the football federation CVB (Curacaose Voetbal Bond) was established and in August that year the CVB organized the first Cura√ßao Championship with eight participating clubs. In 1926 the first national selection of Cura√ßao travelled to Haiti to play in a tournament against Haiti, Jamaica and Santo Domingo. The Cura√ßao selection did quite well in the tournament, with several wins over Haiti and Santo Domingo. In 1932 the federation CVB became affiliated with FIFA. Exchanges with neighboring islands and countries followed on a regular basis. In 1941 the First CONCACAF Championship took place in San Jos√©. Participating countries were Costa Rica, Cura√ßao, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Panama. Cura√ßao ended third. At the end of this year the Cura√ßao and Aruba federations, both islands being part of the Netherlands Antilles, decided to join forces and established NAVU, Netherlands Antillean Football Union. Both federations remained autonomous in their own territory, and the winners of the championships on the respective islands would play against each other to determine which club would be Champion of the Netherlands Antilles. =Early years= Cura√ßao is a small Caribbean island located just north of the Venezuelan coast. Cura√ßao is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, as are the islands Aruba, Bonaire, Sint Maarten, Sint Eustatius and Saba, together known as the former Netherlands Antilles. Cura√ßao has about 150,000 inhabitants. In 1909 the first football club was established in Cura√ßao, then counting about 25.000 inhabitants, established in 1909, CVV Republic. Young people who had spent time in the Netherlands for study and had started playing football and taken a liking to the game united in CVV Republic. At the time there were no soccer fields on Cura√ßao and the first match between CVV Republic and a team of marines took place in the garden of the church of Sta. Famia. As a matter of fact, the Friars, who also ran the schools, played an important role in the early stages of soccer development as they propagated the sport and also organized volunteers to clean and prepare the first fields in Skalo and Mundo. =\\"Golden Years\\"= In May 1946 CVB celebrated its 25 years of existence with an international tournament on Cura√ßao. Visiting teams were Aruba, Surinam, Atl√©tico Junior from Colombia and Feyenoord from the Netherlands. Cura√ßao won all their matches and the last match against the famous Dutch team Feyenoord attracted a large number of spectators. Cura√ßao won 4‚Äì0. In July 1946 the national selection of Cura√ßao travelled to the Netherlands to reinforce the bond between Cura√ßao and the Netherlands. During their three-month stay the Cura√ßao selection played 9 matches against Dutch teams of which the 3‚Äì3 draw against Feyenoord, one of the big Dutch teams, is vividly remembered. The stadium in Rotterdam was filled with over 37.000 spectators, almost as much as the inhabitants of Cura√ßao at the time! The young Cura√ßao goalkeeper Ergilio Hato made a lasting impression with his great athletic abilities and amazing jumping power. The Cura√ßao national selection performed very well in the Concacaf and the Central American and Caribbean Games, even winning the gold medal in 1950 in the CAC Games. Ergilio Hato became a legend in South America and the Caribbean and is remembered by his nickname \\"El pantera negra\\". He got offered several contracts abroad but refused to go pro and choose to stay on his native island. The national stadium of Cura√ßao is named Ergilio Hato Stadium. 1958 brought another organizational change with the establishment of NAVU, the Netherlands Antilles Football Union. Soon the Aruban AVB affiliated with NAVU and BVB, the Bonaire Football Federation followed in 1959. Now players from the three islands could all participate in the national selection of the Netherlands Antilles. Driving force behind both NAVU and FFK is Mordy Maduro, president of CVB since 1951 and president of NAVU from 1958‚Äì1971. Maduro was elected vice-president of FIFA in 1960 and re-elected in 1968. Thanks to Mordy Maduro many foreign teams visited Cura√ßao during his presidency. His great contribution to Cura√ßao football development was honored in 2002 with naming the NAVU development center after him.

Some of these honours are defunct or currently dormant, while some are still actively conferred. Chivalric orders Papal orders of knighthood or Pontifical orders of knighthood are orders of knighthood bestowed in the name of the Pope of the Catholic Church by his authority as head of the Holy See and sovereign of the Vatican City State. Historically, membership in these orders was either conferred by Papal bulls not signed by the Pope or by apostolic letters signed by the Pope himself. Since the reforms of these orders in the beginning of the 20th century, the diplomas have been signed by the Cardinal Secretary of State. In general, Papal orders of knighthood refers to the five equestrian orders of the Holy See awarded directly by the Supreme Pontiff as head of the Catholic Church, Holy See and Vatican City State - as temporal sovereign and font of honour (similar to the orders given by other heads of state) - and the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, an award of the Holy See. The term equestrian in this context refers to the nature of these orders as knightly - conferring knighthood on members - derived from the Equestrians (Equites), a social class of Ancient Rome. * Supreme Order of Christ (no members as of 1993) * Order of the Golden Spur (no members as of 23 April 2019) * Order of Pius IX * Order of Saint Gregory the Great * Order of Saint Sylvester Of the papal orders, the highest and most infrequently awarded is the Supreme Order of Christ; the second order is the equally rare Order of the Golden Spur; the third is the Order of Pius IX; the fourth is the Order of Saint Gregory the Great; and the fifth is the Order of Saint Sylvester Pope and Martyr. *The awards of the Orders of Christ and the Golden Spur are made at the express wish of the Pope in consultation with the Cardinal Secretary of State. *Awards of the Order of Pius IX (or Pian Order) are made to heads of state and senior members of their household at the time of official visits to the Holy See, to senior members of diplomatic missions accredited to the Vatican, and exceptionally, to those who have particularly served the Pope or the Holy See, at the discretion of the Cardinal Secretary of State. *Awards of the Order of Saint Gregory the Great and the Order of Saint Sylvester are generally made on the recommendation of diocesan bishops, with the support of the apostolic nuncio. =Supreme Order of Christ= Tracing its origins to the dissolution of the Knights Templar, the Military Order of Our Lord Jesus Christ was established in 1319 in the Kingdom of Portugal and recognised by the Papal bull Ad ea ex quibus of 15 March 1319 of Pope John XXII. Some historians claim that under the terms of Ad ea ex quibus, the Popes instituted the right to award the membership of the Order themselves, though its text does not explicitly treat of this right. The position of the Catholic Church is that the Pope is the head of every religious order, and thus he can grant admission to these orders without the permission of their superiors general. The awarding of the Pope of the Supreme Order of Christ motu proprio brought the Papacy and the Crown of Portugal into conflict on several occasions, as the King of Portugal believed himself to be the only legitimate fons honorum of the Order. Protests regarding this conflict were made to Rome as late as 1825. During a reorganisation of the Papal orders in 1905, Pope Pius X rendered the Supreme Order of Christ as the most senior Papal honour. On 15 April 1966, in the Papal bull Equestres ordinis, Pope Paul VI limited the award to Roman Catholic heads of state in commemoration of significant events that the Pope personally attended. The most recent presentation of the Order was to Fr√† Angelo de Mojana, 77th Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, in 1987. The last living member of the Order was King Baudouin of Belgium, who died in 1993. =Order of the Golden Spur/Militia= The second highest Papal order is the Order of the Golden Spur, also denominated the \\"Order of the Golden Militia\\". There is a lack of clear historical evidence of its foundation, but it is certain that it is the oldest of the Papal Orders. Broad authority to grant the Order diminished its prestige, and led Pope Gregory XVI to place the Order under the patronage of the Order of St. Sylvester in 1841. As part of this reorganization, the Pope limited the ability to grant the Order and revoked the appointments of those who were not granted it by Papal brief. In 1905 Pope Pius X separated the Order from the Order of St. Sylvester, establishing it as the Order of the Golden Militia. He also limited the number of knights to one hundred. A Papal bull of 1966 further limited it to Christian sovereigns and heads of state. That bull also denominated it the \\"Order of the Golden Militia\\", but the Annuario Pontificio lists it under two names, both as the \\"Order of the Golden Spur\\" and as the \\"Order of the Golden Militia\\". Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg was the last living knight of the Order. =Order of Pius IX= The third highest Papal order is the Order of Pius IX, founded on 17 June 1847 by Pope Pius IX. The Order of Pius IX is the highest Papal order currently awarded. There previously existed an Order of Pian Knights, founded in the 16th century, which later fell into abeyance. It is not related to this order. The Order of Pius IX is the first of the Papal Orders, by order of precedence, to include different grades. The highest grade is the Collar, followed by the Grand Cross, Commander with Star, Commander, and Knight. The Order may be presented to non-Catholic Christians and to non-Christians. =Order of Saint Gregory the Great= The fourth highest Papal order is the Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great. Pope Gregory XVI established the order on 1 September 1831 by the Papal brief Quod summis. It is awarded in four classes, with military and civil divisions. It was initially founded to reward meritorious civic or military service to the Papal States. Through the reforms of 1905, the Order was modified so that the classes paralleled those of the Order of Pius IX, excluding the collar. The Order is currently awarded for conspicuous service to the Catholic Church, without regard to religious affiliation. These awards are typically given premised on recommendations from bishops or Papal nuncios for specific services rendered to the Catholic Church. Membership in the Order of St. Gregory the Great does not carry the religious obligations of the military orders, making it the preferred award of merit for individual service to the Catholic Church. Since 1994, women have been appointed as \\"dames\\" in the same classes as men. =Order of Saint Sylvester Pope and Martyr= The fifth highest Papal order is the Order of St. Sylvester Pope and Martyr. In 1841, Pope Gregory XVI reformed the Order of the Golden Spur as an order of merit, with recipients appointed by Papal brief. This reformed order was known as the \\"Order of St. Sylvester and the Golden Militia\\". The reforms of 1905 resulted in the separation of that order into the Order of St. Sylvester and the Order of the Golden Spur. The Order of St. Sylvester is presented in the same classes and grades as the Order of St. Gregory the Great, and is typically awarded to recognize and reward members of the laity for active service in the apostolates. It may also be presented to non-Catholics. =Orders under the protection of the Apostolic See= The term Papal Orders of Knighthood officially includes the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre, a religious order of chivalry, as it is under the direct protection of the Pope, who is sovereign of the order, and which has a Cardinal as Grand Master. The Order is headquartered in the Vatican City State. Several military religious orders were established at the time of, and since, the Crusades. Of these only the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and the Order of Malta are recognised by the Apostolic See:Press Release of the Secretariat of State (Holy See), December 2012: http://www.news.va/en/news/note-of-clarification-from-the-secretariat-of-stat The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is a sovereign order of chivalry. The Order and the Apostolic See exchange ambassadors. The Pope is not Sovereign of the Order nor does he appoint members to the ranks of knighthood. He is, however, the first to be informed following the election of the Grand Master and appoints a Cardinal Protector of the Order. The Grand Master, a lay professed religious, ranks as a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church and his accorded the title Eminent Highness and Prince. Order of the Holy Sepulchre The Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem traces its founding to the First Crusade, although not as an organised crusading order but an association of knights. After the fall of Jerusalem in 1182, it remained an order of chivalry. In 1489, Pope Innocent VIII suppressed the Order and ruled that it was to be merged with the Knights Hospitaller. In 1496, Pope Alexander VI restored the independence of the Order, decreed that the Order would no longer be governed by the office of Custodian, and further decreed that the senior office of the Order would henceforth be raised to the rank of \\"Grand Master\\", reserving this title for himself and his successors. In 1847, Pope Pius IX reorganized the Order and placed it under the direct protection of the Apostolic See. In 1949, Pope Pius XII decreed that the Grand Master of the Order would henceforth be a cardinal appointed directly by the Pope, who would remain Sovereign of the Order. The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem is ex officio Grand Prior of the Order, while the lay head is the Governor-General. The present Cardinal Grand Master is Fernando Filoni succeeding Edwin Frederick O'Brien, on 8 December 2019. Sovereign Military Order of Malta The Order of Malta also traces its history to the late 11th century, but it first became a religious military order by a bull of Pope Paschal II of 1113. The Grand Master is elected by the Council Complete of State of the Order and serves for life or until abdication. Before a person elected as the Grand Master takes the oath of office, the Pope must be informed of the election.Constitutional Charter 1998, Article 14. The Pope also appoints the Cardinal Patron and a prelate of the Order. = Defunct/dormant orders = *Order of Saint Cecilia *Order of Saint John of the Lateran *Order of Saint Sylvester and the Militia Aurarta *Order of the Moor *Knights of Pius =Other Catholic chivalric orders= Historically, many military orders and other chivalric orders were founded in association with the Holy See. Most of them became extinct, were suppressed, or merged with contemporary chivalric orders. Some of them survived under the protection of the Holy See as in the list above. A few of them remained as patrimony of dynastic royal houses. Some of these dynastic orders of knighthood were recognised as Roman Catholic by Papal bulls of the Holy See, and although they are no more affiliated with or protected by the Holy See, some of them are still exclusively designated for Catholics. In response to a proliferation of self-proclaimed chivalric orders claiming recognition from the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy See's Secretariat of State issued a statement clarifying that \\"other than its own Equestrian Orders [...] the Holy See recognises and supports only the Sovereign Military Order of Malta [...] and the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre\\". All other self-styled chivalric orders, the statement continued, \\"whether of recent origin or mediaeval foundation, are not recognised by the Holy See\\" and \\"the Holy See does not guarantee their historical or juridical legitimacy, their ends or organisational structures... to prevent the continuation of abuses which may result in harm to people of good faith, the Holy See confirms that it attributes absolutely no value whatsoever to certificates of membership or insignia issued by these groups, and it considers inappropriate the use of churches or chapels for their so- called 'ceremonies of investiture'.\\" The Teutonic (German) Order is no longer an order of chivalry, but is a purely religious order within the Roman Church. The Teutonic Order was founded as a hospital brotherhood in 1190 in Acre, Israel. In 1198 the Order became a religious military order of chivalry. However, since 1929 it has been a purely religious order of priests, brothers, and sisters, with a category of 12 honorary knights and an unlimited number of associates, known as Marianer. Its headquarters is in Vienna, Austria. The current Grand Master is Bruno Platter.  Other distinctions  =Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice = The medal was established in 1888 and is awarded by the Pope to members of the clergy and laity for service to the Catholic Church and the Pope. Until 1996, it was the highest Papal decoration that could be awarded to women. =Benemerenti medal= The Benemerenti Medal is awarded by the Pope to members of the clergy and laity for service to the Catholic Church. The tradition can be traced back to the 18th century. = Jerusalem Pilgrim's Cross = The Jerusalem Pilgrim's Cross was established in 1901. It is an honour awarded in the name of the Pope as a recognition of merit to pilgrims to the Holy Land. = Golden Rose= The Golden Rose is a gold ornament.

It is made from cooked brawn and minced meat, veal or sausage, and broth of pork, sometimes from cooked meat, blood and offal. The sausage is stretched with stale bread, explaining the name: \\"Weck\\" or \\"Wegge\\" is the traditional term for roll in Northern Hesse. It is seasoned with onions, salt, pepper, marjoram, regionally also with caraway, allspice and garlic. The ingredients are ground and mixed.

Weckewerk, also called Weckewurst, can be eaten cold or fried in a pan. The former mayor of Kassel, Philipp Scheidemann, liked Weckewerk almost burnt, therefore this form of preparation is called B√ºrgermeisterart (\\"in the fashion of the mayor\\").

Shelton's patents have had an impact relating to home washing machines and the preparation of food in both the Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry and fine dining. Technologies Shelton developed while an engineer at General Electric are still in use after more than fifty years. His patent for the modern \\"Washing Machine\\" (US 3257830 A), licensed in 1965 to General Electric has been referenced in over 40 subsequent patents. Shelton also invented new ways to cook and hold food, including the Collectramatic, the first pressurized fryer that did not require interrupting production to frequently filter shortening while cooking. Shelton also invented Controlled Vapor Technology, a patented cooking method that uses water vapor to prepare and safely hold food. Early life Born in Lockwood, West Virginia, in 1922, Shelton was the youngest of Naaman Shelton Sr. (1889‚Äì1962) and Opal Dell (n√©e Keenan) (1895‚Äì1979) Shelton's five children. Opal Shelton operated the \\"Cross Roads Restaurant\\", a roadside diner next to the family's Standard Oil service station in Clay, West Virginia, where young Shelton had his first exposure to food service, helping his mother in the diner's kitchen. Shelton enlisted in the US Army in 1943, serving in the Army Specialized Training Program at Princeton University in the School of Engineering and was discharged in 1945. Shelton's education included attending Greenbrier Military School, Princeton University and West Virginia University, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1948. Inventions at GE Shelton's career at General Electric began in 1948 as an engineer in the GE Home Laundry facility in Trenton, New Jersey. In 1952, Shelton transferred to the new General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky as a Research and Development Engineer when the Trenton Home Laundry division was consolidated there along with GE's other major appliance product lines. His tenure there spanned two decades. While there, his inventions earned 35 patents, primarily related to the drum washing machine, all assigned to GE. His inventions helped create and refine the modern, top-loading, rotating spiral agitator clothes washer. Shelton invented the mechanism to automatically provide the correct water level(s) at a desired water temperature during a washing machine's cycles and an easily removed and cleaned soil trap that strained insoluble dirt and debris as the unit's water was filtered through it during the wash and rinse cycles. GE marketed Shelton's invention as the \\"Filter-Flo Basket.\\" The unit fit on top of the washing machine's agitator post and rotated during use. Shelton's inventions also included an anti-siphonage inlet system (US 2638112) to avoid back contamination of a water supply, and a drain overflow arrangement for built-in washing machines that provided a safe means of dealing with excess water during operation. Addressing the need for better controls for the automatic washing machine, in 1955 Shelton took a Telechron clock motor and built a geared, cam timing control mechanism around it. Patented as the ‚ÄúTiming Mechanism for Conducting a Selected One of a Plurality of Sequences of Operation‚Äù, the control is still in use on many appliances (US 2870278 A). Winston Industries In 1965, Shelton formed Engineering Prototype Services (EPS) with his brother, Naaman Shelton, Jr (1919-1990) in Louisville, Kentucky where he could work on projects outside of the GE product line. Colonel Sanders was one of the first investors in the new company. Shelton resigned from GE in 1968. The company name was changed to Winston Industries in 1984. The majority of Shelton's inventions after founding Winston Industries focused on solving problems in the food industry. His patents relating to food preparation include an automatic oven that cooks food and then automatically drops the cooked food onto a pivoting platform for sale (US 5990452 A), a food storage device that provides a method of controlling humidity in the cooking chamber (US 5595109 A) and a thermalizing apparatus using both wet bulb and dry bulb temperature sensors to more precisely control cooking parameters inside a cooking chamber (US 6521871 B1). The Collectramatic and KFC success An early customer, filtering-equipment manufacturer Carl Mies, asked Shelton to engineer a pressure fryer for cooking chicken to replace the dangerous process then used by Kentucky Fried Chicken. Workers at Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises fried chicken in stove top pressure cookers using 400-degree shortening, leading to burns and exploding pressure cookers. Shelton said \\"I watched that madness and thought, 'That's an engineer's dream, man!' There were so many problems to solve, and that was just the low-hanging fruit.\\" After inventing a fryer with Mies, Shelton then invented the Collectramatic in 1969, a stationary, self-filtering fryer, employing precision time and temperature controls to meet Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Colonel Harland Sanders' legendary exacting standards. Shelton's self-filtering fryer allowed KFC restaurants to continuously fry multiple batches of chicken without interruption. Colonel Sanders \\"enthusiastically supported\\" the Collectramatic. Shelton's Collectramatic helped fuel KFC's rapid expansion and success. Same store KFC sales grew nearly 400% in the short term. According to Fred Jeffries, the chain's vice president of purchasing at the time: \\"Stores were doing about $200,000 a year in sales on average with the pots . . . but they could never have done the $900,000 a year it became without Win's fryer. He helped set the stage for that with true engineering thinking.\\" Collectramatic¬Æ is a registered trademark. Controlled Vapor Technology Colonel Sanders asked Shelton to invent a better way to hold just fried KFC chicken so the crust would not get soggy as the food was held for sale. Shelton invented a process in which cooked food was held in a controlled water vapor atmosphere heated to the food's desired finished temperature. Shelton named his invention \\"Controlled Vapor Technology\\". Shelton's food holding device using his Controlled Vapor Technology was named the \\"Controlled Vapor Oven\\" or \\"CVap Oven\\", a device that could indefinitely hold food safely at both a desired temperature and texture. Shelton was awarded a US Patent in 1996 for his invention of Controlled Vapor Technology and the Controlled Vapor Oven. \\"Controlled Vapor Technology¬Æ\\" and \\"CVap¬Æ\\" are registered trademarks. Shelton explained the Controlled Vapor Technology process as using water vapor, rather than air, as the medium for heating food, since air dries foods. Subsequent research proved food could be prepared to exacting precision using Shelton's Controlled Vapor Technology, allowing chefs much greater control over interior and exterior moisture, temperature and time during the preparation of many foods. Starting in 2008, the CVap oven was tested by University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, Food and Environment Food Systems Innovation Center, validating the safe processing of proteins in CVap ovens during a five-year testing program. According to Nathan Myhrvold, founder of The Cooking Lab, \\"... the CVap provides better temperature stability than any ordinary oven or holding cabinet does.\\" Another benefit of the CVap process is that it results in less product loss during cooking, which translates into higher profit. Farmhaus restaurant chef-owner Kevin Willmann explained the benefit in cooking porchetta in a CVap oven. Conventional oven cooking resulted in a loss of 25 to 40 percent of the meat's initial weight. \\"You go to CVap and that can't happen because the environment is so humid that moisture can't leave.\\" Willman claimed a loss of less than 10 percent when cooking the same recipe in a CVap oven. CVap ovens are used by fine-dining chefs, hotels, school cafeterias and fast-food operators in kitchens around the world. Rockwell portrait of Colonel Sanders In 1973, at the urging of his wife Dolly, Shelton sought to have Norman Rockwell paint a portrait of Colonel Sanders as a way to commemorate \\"the Colonel\\". Working through George Bemis, Shelton's Advertising and Promotion Manager, a series of letters were sent to Rockwell, starting in March, 1973. Rockwell initially refused, saying \\"‚Ä¶my schedule is completely filled for a year and a half, so it would just be impossible for me to do a portrait of Colonel Sanders.\\" Shelton continued to press Rockwell to accept the commission. When Rockwell said \\"we must bear in mind that I am 79\\", Bemis responded \\"Colonel Harland Sanders is eighty-three years young and going strong. Perhaps he would consider you, at seventy-nine, a mere child.\\" Rockwell responded with another demurral but this time did include his fee for a portrait, saying \\"I think I should add that I get $ 8,000 for a head and shoulders portrait, in oil‚Ä¶\\" Rockwell finally agreed to schedule a portrait session with Sanders in August 1973, where reference photographs were taken in studio and Rockwell made \\"color notes\\" in oil of Sanders. In November, Rockwell wrote \\"I would like to have him (Sanders) see the portrait, as far as I have done it, to see whether it is to his liking.\\" Rockwell finished the portrait and presented it to Sanders on March 16, 1974. Winston Industries' Norman Rockwell portrait of Col. Sanders is on loan and currently on display in Sanders' office museum at the KFC corporate headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. The public may view the painting at no charge. Normal viewing hours are Monday through Friday from 8:00 am until 5:00 pm. Biography published A biography of Shelton written by author Steve Coomes entitled \\"Winston L. Shelton: a life of Invention\\" was published February 4, 2018. The book features Shelton discussing his life in his own words as well as contributions from family and co-workers. Coomes' synopsis of the book mentions \\"Four decades before Winston Shelton began creating revolutionary foodservice equipment, he was tinkering with junkyard castoffs to make a working underwater exploration helmet, a gasoline powered child's wagon, and a rudimentary sawmill‚Äîall before he was in high school. With the help of his mechanically intuitive father and brother, he discovered how things worked by disassembling and reassembling them. In the process, Shelton became a practical problem solver whose own intuition refined and created some of the most influential machines ever built. In this inspiring book, the entrepreneurial creator of Winston Industries tells a story of working on the Manhattan Project, becoming a groundbreaking G.E. engineer and revolutionizing how Kentucky Fried Chicken cooked its prized product.\\" Later activities =Teaching= Shelton continued to teach chefs and dietitians throughout the world the science behind controlling food temperatures and food texture using his Controlled Vapor Technology. William H. Bender, founder of Foodservice Consultants Society International said \\"He (Shelton) has translated complex food and science issues into equipment solutions ... CVap revolutionizes food best practices dramatically. (Shelton) has correctly aligned the science and purpose of food temperature control and controlling food moisture.\\" =Continued research= Having stepped down as CEO of Winston Industries, Shelton continued to head the Advanced Engineering department at the company until his death. His daughter, Valerie Shelton was named President and CEO of Winston Industries in 2010. She resigned the position in March, 2020. =Media appearances= Winston L. Shelton during 2016 interview by French television reporters from Groupe Canal+, C8 Network's investigative news magazine \\"Focus\\".Shelton was interviewed in June 2016 by a team of French journalists about his friendship and business relationship with Colonel Sanders and his invention of the Collectramatic fryer for KFC. Shelton and Chef Barry Yates also demonstrated how the Collectramatic functions. The 90 minute documentary, \\"Inside KFC : Au coeur d'un g√©ant du fast food (Inside KFC: In the heart of a fast food giant)\\" was first broadcast on September 14, 2016, as part of the French television news magazine \\"Focus\\", hosted by Guy Lagache, on the Groupe Canal+ C8 Network. Shelton was interviewed in May 2018 by Louisville television station WHAS-TV (ABC affiliate) reporter Sara Wagner as part of \\"Characters of Kentuckiana\\". The segment, entitled \\"Inventing Never Stops - The Inventor\\" showcased Shelton's passion for invention and how Colonel Sanders helped drive his inventions of the Collectramatic fryer and the CVap Oven. Shelton explained how his father's answer to Shelton's question of what his father hoped to be remembered for (to have made the world a better place through his efforts in life) had motivated Shelton to continually invent better ways for the world to cook and enjoy more nutritious food. The interview was first broadcast on June 4, 2018, as part of \\"Good Morning Kentuckiana\\". NBC Today Show host Willie Geist profiled Shelton‚Äôs life in a ‚ÄúA Life Well Lived‚Äù segment on April 21, 2019.

Structure Prokofiev famously warned Richter not to expect a showy work, and indeed the Ninth Sonata ‚Äî effectively his last ‚Äî has been described as introspective and contemplative. In fact it is a mostly quiet, somewhat ambling masterpiece in four movements lasting 21‚Äì26 minutes, with Barbara Nissman and Vladimir Ovchinnikov defining in their recordings the limits of that range. (Richter in 1956 and 1958, Nikolai Petrov, Matti Raekallio, Yefim Bronfman, Freddy Kempf and Alexander Melnikov, besides Nissman and Ovchinnikov, have all left notable recordings; Richter's two are ironically less persuasive than his breathtaking work on other parts of the Prokofiev canon.) The first and second movements both end with pinpoint resolution on their last notes. The second movement provides explosive contrast after the relaxed first. The gently lyrical third is punctuated by two outbursts; the (again tranquil) fourth movement opens, proceeds, and concludes having pliancy as its apparent mantra. But the sonata's structure has cyclical support: the first three movements each end with the opening idea of the next, and the fourth loops back to the first by quoting its theme.

His professional and academic activity played a crucial role in the strategic definition of a model for Japan technological society promoted public policy at the time was one of the pioneers in conceptualizing the idea of information society.  Life and career  Masuda worked in various programs of the Japanese Ministries of Labour and Education to improve and streamline production practices and training of the Japanese population. He was director of the Institute for the Development of the Uses of Computers in Japan and the founder and president of the Institute for Informatization of the Society. Professor at the University of Aomuri and director of the Japan Society of Creativity. From a Ministry of Trade and Industry (MITI) prepares for the institute JACUDI a plan for the 'Information Society. A national target for 2000 ', known as Plan JACUDI.  Theory  Masuda was one of the major candidates who attributed credit for coining the term information society. Although his book that uses such terms in the title dates back to 1980, there was already a public debate on the issue in the 50 and 60 in Japan. Thus, some authors suggest that the first scholars of the concept of Information Society appear in Japan : the book published by Yoneji Masuda in 1980 titled Johoka shakai, which means the higher stage of social evolution, from the perspective of the analogy with biological evolution. From post-industrial society to information society. The fifth chapter of it was entitled to turn the information age: quiet transformation of society. In it, Masuda tells of the birth of an era of information, focusing on computer technology, which operates in conjunction with communications technology. An information age is the time period during which takes place innovation information technology, becomes latent force of social transformation, able to cause an expansion in the quality of information and a large increase scale storage of information. This was, for the author, the information society, focusing on computer technology, which would have a much more decisive impact on human society that the industrial revolution which began with the invention of the steam engine, because the fundamental role of the computer is to replace and amplify human mental work, while the basic function of steam machinery was replacement and amplification of physical work. Masuda spoke also of the possibility of a highly organic society, pointing out the similarity of environmental information system of communications technology and computer information systems to organic bodies, which would suggest something important to the vision of the (then) future information society. On this basis, one could hypothesize that the future information society would be a highly integrated society, like an organism. It would be a complex multi-centered society in which many systems are connected and integrated by information networks. Further, this would be a dynamic society able to respond more quickly and appropriately to contemporary society-then-to the changing environment, and thus the information society of the future would appear to us as a society with a highly organic information space, linked by a network of cognitive information proaction dense mesh (feedforward). Writing about the social impact of the information age, Masuda understood to mean not only that would cause a great socioeconomic impact on contemporary industrial society, prove a force for social change powerful enough to transform human society into an absolutely new form, which is the information society. Overall, the innovative technology would change the social and economic systems through the following three phases: *Phase 1. - In which technology does the work previously done for humans based on automation. * Phase 2. - In which technology makes possible the realization of a work that man could never do before. Knowledge creation, leading to enlargement of the mental work of man. *Phase 3. - In which socio-economic structures are transformed into new social and economic systems, a result of the first two phases of development. The futuristic vision of Masuda of goes further: in the global information society, all citizens will be bound together by a global network of information and knowledge, leading to the formation of a global consciousness, which will sweep away the differences of cultures, interests and nationalities. In predicting the introduction of a general education system, the disappearance of illiteracy, the advent of world peace and human happiness, Masuda does not restrict his futuristic vision to those social sectors or countries actively participating in industry or in services information, but predicts a real New World Order that he calls \\"Computop√≠a\\"The information society as post- industrial society Yoneji Masuda, Editorial Fundesco (1984)  Publications  Masuda authored several books on technology and society.

H. sanguinolentus lays its own egg on the front of the spider‚Äôs abdomen and the spider recovers from the paralysis but it never leaves the web again, nor does she lay eggs. After three days the egg of H. sanguinolentus hatches and the larva feeds on the spider, finally killing it after about ten days.

He is best known for his work with Culture Club, ABC, Kylie Minogue and The Cure. David Levine started his career in 1977 while working as a photographer's assistant. He went on to photograph artists live in concert and worked as a stills photographer on music videos with the director Tim Pope. As well as working with Culture Club, Levine also worked with a number of other 1980s acts including ABC, The Cure, Kylie Minogue, Jermaine Jackson, 5 Star, and Siouxsie Sioux. Levine quickly established a style of work in the studio, much copied by other music photographs in the 80's and indeed today his influence can still be seen. That style earned him the nickname 'The man who shot the 80's'. Always filming throughout his stills career, his music videos are as typically stylish and gritty as his stills. Levine's work in both stills and film achieves a style unique to him. Levine was invited to lecture at the University of Arts London, London College of Fashion in 2014. He lectured in Fashion Photography while continuing with his busy photography and film career. Levine's 2009 portrait of Paul Nicholls is held in the National Portrait Gallery.

The album contained four singles, all of which charted within the British Top 100 (although only one, \\"Saved\\", scraped into the Top 40).Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 898-9 Recording From A to B was recorded in various sessions in six different studios. The band was signed on the strength of Shearer's home 4-track recordings before the label had even seen them play live. Mike Smith, then of EMI publishing was impressed with the depth and breadth of Shearer's writing, comparing him to Julian Cope. Shearer offered a box of 4-track recordings to David Francolini who wanted to produce the album. These were used as the sketch of the album. The band's producer was David Francolini (formerly the drummer with Levitation and later performing the same role for Dark Star) with Chris Sheldon and John Cornfield assisting with several of the mixes. During the recording, various external musicians were brought in to add to the band's sound, with Shearer being particularly influenced by The Beach Boys and The Beatles as well as The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett (where they get their name). Only five of the album's fifteen tracks do not feature a guest bass guitar player: the other ten tracks feature bass playing by sessions musician Dave Quinn, Francolini's former Levitation colleague Robert White (also of The Milk and Honey Band), or the original Octopus bass guitarist Steven McSeveney. In addition, Francolini plays drums on two tracks and piano on another, as well as playing Moog synthesizer on five tracks and contributing keyboards, percussion, samples and various noises throughout the album. Francolini also co-wrote six of the album's songs, including the single \\"Magazine\\" although Marc Shearer wrote every song on the album. The recording process was long and expensive with the band experimenting in Sawmill's Studio, using the natural creek as echo and recording in tents. The backwards guitar solo on \\"Your Smile\\" is from the original 4-track recording done in Shearer's kitchen in Glasgow and the album is a mixture of high and low production values. Other contributing musicians include both core members of Blowpipe (Robin and Andrew Blick, the latter of whom was part of Octopus' live brass section), singer Katherine Blake (Mediaeval Baebes, Miranda Sex Garden), folk musician Nigel Mazlyn Jones and cellist Audrey Riley. Many songs were recorded during the several sessions with the band pulling in a more psychedelic direction and the label looking for pop hits like \\"Jealousy\\" which Shearer had written as a wry comment on pop singles. When the initial singles, \\"Magazine\\", \\"Your Smile\\" and \\"Saved\\" were not major hits, EMI pushed for the release of \\"Jealousy\\" believing it to be radio friendly but it also failed to perform well in the charts. The album has a secret message, based on the works of J.D Salinger, encoded in the sequencing of the tracks which was done at Abbey Road but nobody has worked it out.

The first issue was published in February 1962, and in 2012, the internationally read magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary. Four Wheeler focuses on new- vehicle evaluations, project vehicles, the technical aspects of building a vehicle (such as how to install aftermarket accessories and do complete engine swaps), product tests, outdoor equipment and machines, 4x4 shows and competitions, and travel and adventure. Four Wheeler is published monthly by Motor Trend Group and headquartered in El Segundo, California. Top Truck Challenge The first Four Wheeler Top Truck Challenge took place in 1993, and the event, also called TTC, was held annually at the Hollister Hills State Vehicular Recreation Area near Hollister, California. The last Top Truck Challenge was held in June, 2015. The original concept was to test the engineering capabilities of 4x4 vehicles, and it remained that way through its 23-year history, inviting readers \\"who own ‚Äòthe world‚Äôs best four wheeler‚Äô to put up or shut up: Take us up on our Top Truck Challenge‚Äîthe search for the best truck‚Äîand send in an entry,\\" as the February 1994 issue stated. Although competitors were selected by Four Wheeler readers, that process didn‚Äôt actually begin until 1995. Competition vehicles no longer needed to also be street legal starting with the 2004 Top Truck Challenge. Over the years, the challenges have included an obstacle course, a mini Rubicon trail, and the Tank Trap. In 2012, Four Wheeler held the first-ever Top Truck Champions‚Äô Challenge, pitting past Top Truck Challenge Grand Champions against one another for ultimate bragging rights. Segments from Top Truck Challenge have been broadcast on the Outdoor Channel. Granville King One of the most popular Four Wheeler writers was Granville King. He was Four Wheeler‚Äôs Baja correspondent from 1984 until the time of his death in 1989. He wrote a variety of stories for Four Wheeler, including his \\"From the Backcountry\\" series, which was an account of a life devoid of many modern trappings, but filled with backcountry adventures and mechanical tips. Four Wheeler of the Year and Pickup Truck of the Year Annually, Four Wheeler hands out two prestigious awards to automakers of new 4x4s, Four Wheeler of the Year and Pickup Truck of the Year. As voted on by the editors, it is a rigorous competition that began in 1974 with the Four Wheeler Achievement Award, given to the 1974 Jeep Cherokee. In 1989, pickup trucks were separated into the own contest. Vehicles are evaluated in categories such as off-road performance, highway performance, mechanical and empirical data, interior, and exterior. The 2016 competitions took place over five days and 1,000 miles, and had a panel of eight experienced judges. Over the past competitions, including both Four Wheeler of the Year and Pickup Truck of the Year, the title has been awarded to 13 different manufacturers, with Jeep and Dodge/Ram tied with 11 trophies each.

With the exception of the Chinese Phymosteus, selenosteids lived in shallow seas in what is now Eastern North America (the Cleveland Shale), Eastern Europe (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland, and the Kellwasserkalk fauna of Bad Wildungen), and Northeastern Africa (the Anti-Atlas Mountains, Morocco). Selenosteids have, in cross section, a rounded body, a blunt snout, and tremendous orbits. The lower jaws were slender, the inferognathals usually either being finely serrated, or adapted for crushing, though, in Draconichthys, the inferognathals had long prongs for seizing prey. The rostrum is very small. Taxonomy Below is a cladogram from R√ºcklin (2011): Denison (1978) separated Selenosteidae into two informal groups, the \\"American\\" genera (i.e., those taxa from the Upper Famennian Cleveland Shales, such as Selenosteus and Gymnotrachelus), and the \\"European\\" genera (i.e., those taxa from the Upper Frasnian Kellwasserkalk facies of Germany, and later, Morocco, like Rhinosteus and Microsteus). Denison notes that the differences between the two groups, such as how the American genera tend to have slightly smaller orbits, and slightly longer cheeks, may suggest the similarities between them are due to parallel evolution. R√ºcklin (2011), on the other hand, places Pachyosteus as the most basal selenosteid, then groups the American genera (with Selenosteus grouped as the sister taxon of Gymnotrachelus and Stenosteus) as being the sister group of the remaining European/Kellwasserkalk genera, plus Draconichthys. Some experts imply that Selenosteidae is paraphyletic, as the genus Rhinosteus is often depicted in arthrodire cladograms as being the sister taxon to the Dinichthyloidea taxa Dinichthys (ne \\"Dinichthyidae\\"), Gorgonichthys, Heintzichthys, and Hadrosteidae.

The main idea of this method is to present vorticity field with discrete regions (domains), which travel with diffusive velocity relatively to fluid and conserve their circulation. The same approach was used in Diffusion Velocity method of Ogami and Akamatsu, but VVD uses other discrete formulas Features The VVD method deals with viscous incompressible fluid. The viscosity and density of fluid is considered to be constant. Method can be extended for simulation of heat conductive fluid flows (viscous vortex-heat domains method) The main features are: * Direct solving Navier-Stokes equations (DNS) * Calculation of the friction force at the body surfaces * Proper description of the boundary layers (even turbulent) * Infinite computation region * Convenient simulation of deforming boundaries * Investigation of the flow-structure interaction, even in case of zero mass * Estimated numerical diffusion and stability criteria Governing equations Scheme of VVD method The VVD method is based on a theorem, that circulation in viscous fluid is conserved on contours travelling with speed :\\\\mathbf{u} = \\\\mathbf{V} + \\\\mathbf{V}_d; ~~~\\\\mathbf{V}_d = - u \\\\dfrac{ abla\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}}{\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega}}; ~~~\\\\mathbf{\\\\Omega} = [ abla \\\\times \\\\mathbf{V}], where V is fluid velocity, Vd ‚Äî diffusion velocity, ŒΩ ‚Äî kinematic viscosity. This theorem shows resemblance with Kelvin's circulation theorem, but it works for viscous flows. Basing on this theorem, flow region with non-zero circulation is presented with number of domains (small regions with finite volumes), which move with velocity u and thus their circulation \\\\gamma remains constant. The actual boundaries of every domain are not tracked, but coordinates of the only tracking point in every domain is saved. Array of domains' coordinates and circulations is known either from boundary conditions or from initial conditions. Such a motion results in vorticity evolution and satisfies Navier-Stokes equations. Discrete formulas Diffusive vortex-vortex interaction Diffusive body-vortex interaction Fluid velocity V in point r can be calculated with help of Biot-savart law :\\\\mathbf{V}(\\\\mathbf{r}) = \\\\dfrac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\sum_i \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\left[\\\\mathbf{e}_z \\\\times \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i}{(\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i)^2 + \\\\delta^2}\\\\right] where i indexes domains in flow, ri ‚Äî tracking point of domain and Œ≥i ‚Äî his circulation. Œ¥ is a so-called \\"radius of discreteness\\" ‚Äî small value that smooths the vortex and helps to get rid of singularity in the domain tracking point. It equals to mean distance between domains. Calculation of diffusion velocity is more difficult :\\\\mathbf{V}_d(\\\\mathbf{r}) = u\\\\left( \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{I}_2(\\\\mathbf r)}{I_1(\\\\mathbf r)} + \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{I}_3(\\\\mathbf r)}{2\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon^2 - I_0(\\\\mathbf r)} \\\\right) First fraction produces vortex-vortex interaction (i ‚Äî vortex index). :\\\\mathbf{I}_2(\\\\mathbf r) = \\\\sum\\\\limits_i \\\\dfrac{\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i}{\\\\varepsilon \\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right} \\\\cdot \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right/\\\\varepsilon) :I_1(\\\\mathbf r) = {\\\\sum\\\\limits_i \\\\gamma_i \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-\\\\left\\\\mathbf{r}-\\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\right/\\\\varepsilon)} And second fraction represents vortex-boundary repulsion.

Bakers is part of National Brands Limited, an FMCG company which is a subsidiary of South African holding company AVI Limited. Bakers products are manufactured in Durban, Pretoria, and Johannesburg. History The origins of the company commenced when John Frederick Baumann migrated from England to South Africa, where in 1851 at the age of 26 he established a grocery and bread bakery in Durban, in the British Colony of Natal (now a province of South Africa). In 1879 Baumann visited London where he met with his nephew, John Michael Leonard Baumann, suggesting he emigrate to South Africa. J. M. L. Baumann had previously left his native village in Niederstetten, Germany at the age of 16, and moved to London where he worked as a baker's assistant before acquiring his own bakery business. J. M. L. Baumann arrived in Durban in 1881 and joined his uncle's bakery and grocery business. A few years later when the lease on their premises expired, J. M. L. Baumann purchased the bakery operations from his uncle. He bought a site at the corner of Brickhill Road and West Street, where he constructed a small building. In 1885 Baumann purchased a hand-operated biscuit machine for ¬£65 from another baker, Plowright. The machine produced 'dry' biscuits for sale to ships and army garrisons. In 1895 Baumann purchased an advanced biscuit machine and commenced manufacture of more 'fancy biscuits' such as Ginger Nuts and Marie. He printed his first price list and operated under the name L. Baumann & Co The factory survived the anti-German riots of 1915 when the shop and bread and cake premises were burnt down. At the time, the biscuit factory was producing biscuits for the army, and two of JML Baumann's sons were fighting the Germans in the then German colony of South West Africa (now Namibia). The factory was put under government protection to prevent further damage. Due to the anti-German sentiment in 1915, the company's name was changed from Baumann's to Bakers Limited. In 1918 Baumann's son, William, opened a biscuit factory in Cape Town, the business was registered in October 1918 as Selected Products Ltd, trading as Baumann's Biscuits. William sold the company back to Bakers Limited in 1922 but continued to operate it as a subsidiary. At the beginning of the 1930s, almost 200 people were employed and the 1935 wholesale catalogue listed 240 different biscuit lines. Originally biscuits were packed loose in tins and the company was prepared to pay railage on the empty returns. The company then introduced packets which consisted of two layers of paper: one was the familiar blue lattice printed Bakers paper and the other inside layer was of 'pure vegetable parchment'. In 1968 Bakers Ltd established a factory at Isando in the Transvaal. Bakers Ltd then established a new factory at Pinetown, which commenced operations on 6 December 1972. The following year the company closed their operations in Durban and consolidated them at the new Pinetown factory. In 1977 Bakers Ltd built a small factory, Lexim (Pty) Ltd, at Butterworth, Transkei. In 1981 the company was acquired by Anglovaal Industries Limited (AVI). In 1993 AVI purchased Pyotts Pty Ltd, a savoury biscuit manufacturer, and the following year regrouped the companies under the title, Associated Biscuits. In 1996 Associated Biscuits was consolidated into National Brands Limited. In 2014, Bakers entered the breakfast market, launching Bakers Good Morning Breakfast biscuits.

The Southern Discomfort pamphlets were a series of studies by Labour MP Giles Radice, published by the Labour- affiliated think tank the Fabian Society that examined attitudes towards the party in the south of England after the 1992 general election defeat.http://labour-uncut.co.uk/tag/sunder-katwala/ The studies found that voters in marginal constituencies were concerned about Labour's lack of economic credibility and feared that their taxes would increase if party leader Neil Kinnock had won the election. The pamphlets were influential in underscoring the need for Labour to appeal to \\"C1\\" (white collar) and \\"C2\\" (skilled) voters (based on the NRS social grade classifications identifying class in the UK). The title is a reference to Southern Comfort, a well-known American liqueur. It had been widely expected that Labour would form a government as a result of the 1992 election. However, John Major unexpectedly led the Conservative Party to a fourth successive majority. At the next election in 1997, new Labour leader Tony Blair won a landslide victory, including in the southern areas identified by the pamphlets. 1990s Pamphlets =Southern Discomfort= The original pamphlet, published in September 1992, had three key chapters: \\"Labour's 'Southern' problem\\", \\"Why waverers did not vote Labour\\" and \\"What Labour must do\\". It was based on studies done in five marginal constituencies in the south of England which Labour had failed to win at the 1992 election: Gravesham, Harlow, Luton South, Slough and Stevenage. The party had only won ten seats in the south of England outside London, and Radice asserted that it would have to do better in this area to win power. He recommended that Labour show it was \\"The party of the individual\\", \\"Against vested interests\\", Opportunity for all\\" and \\"Managing capitalism better than the Tories\\". He also gave recommendations in the key policy areas of \\"Tax and spending\\", \\"Housing, education and health\\" and \\"Rights and electoral reform\\". By the time the work was written, John Smith had taken over from Neil Kinnock as party leader. =More Southern Discomfort : a year on - taxing and spending= The follow-up pamphlet, published in September 1993, returned to the same constituencies, and was co-authored by Fabian Research Officer Stephen Pollard. The findings were concentrated in three themed chapters: \\"Why southern voters matter\\", \\"Tax, spending and benefits\\" and \\"Lessons for Labour\\". In conclusion, it noted that \\"The southern 'floaters' feel let down by the Tories but do not yet trust Labour.\\" Further to this, \\"They still think Labour is an old fashioned party, remote from their concerns and aspirations, wedded to high taxation and extravagant expenditure and not competent to run the country. Despite their disgust with the government, they still believe the Tories will win the next election.\\" The authors recommended that Labour should consider \\"policies such as hypothecated taxes\\" \\"prove that it is no longer a trade union dominated party by giving individual members more say\\" and \\"demonstrate that it understands the modern world by rewriting Clause IV\\". =Any Southern Comfort?= The final Fabian pamphlet, published in September 1994, was again co-authored by Radice and Pollard, and the three main chapters were titled \\"Labour's lost voters\\", \\"What they now think\\" and \\"Labour on probation\\". The research again took place in Harlow, Luton and Slough, but this time added two marginal Midlands seats: Dudley West and Lincoln. This was done to test the original theory from Southern Discomfort that \\"the political attitudes of Labour's 'lost voters' in the South are increasingly shared by similar voters in other parts of the country\\". It concluded that \\"at a time when voters are deeply sceptical about politicians, the Labour Party must earn their trust.\\" Tony Blair had become party leader since the previous pamphlet's publication, and the authors noted that the voters questioned had \\"a good initial impression\\" of him. 2010s Pamphlets =Southern Discomfort Again?= Following Labour's return to opposition as a result of the 2010 general election, a new study was published by Policy Network, examining the reasons for Labour's defeat in the south of England. It was once again co-authored by Giles Radice, this time with Patrick Diamond, who had been head of policy planning in 10 Downing Street and senior policy adviser to the Prime Minister when Labour were in government. The purpose of the study was \\"to address the crippling weakness that Labour faces in Southern England following the 2010 defeat.\\" The main chapters were titled \\"Labour's Southern problem: 2010\\", \\"Why Labour lost: party views\\", \\"Why wavering voters deserted Labour\\", \\"The new electoral battleground\\" and \\"What Labour must now do\\". It concluded that \\"If Labour takes into account the views of those voters that have deserted the party in recent years, it can re-emerge as the dominant progressive force in British politics, advancing its vision of a society where in R. H. Tawney's words every individual can have access to 'the means of civilisation', and once again become the natural party of government.\\" Labour had been led to defeat by Gordon Brown at that year's election, and was succeeded by Ed Miliband as party leader several weeks before the publication of this study.

It stars Meenakshi Seshadri and Rishi Kapoor in pivotal roles. Plot Mala is the daughter of Kishanlal who works as a servant with a wealthy family. One day Mala meets with the owner of this family, who is so impressed with Mala that he asks for her hand in marriage for his fourth son, Gopal, which Kishanlal humbly accepts. As a result, Mala marries Gopal, and moves in to their palatial home. While Mala is helpful and sweet-natured, the rest of the daughter-in-laws, three of them, are quite the opposite. When bad times befall this family, the owner passes away; Gopal and Mala move out, leaving Gopal's mother at the mercy of her indifferent sons, Girdhar, Murli, Manohar, and their abusive wives who refuse to assist in any household work, virtually forcing their aged mother-in-law to all menial work, not looking after her needs, even when she becomes ill, and ultimately throwing her out of the house. Gopal gains popularity as a musician, while his brothers mortgage their family home with a moneylender. They decide to live off Gopal, and tell him that their mother has gone for a tirath-yatra (holy journey). With that out of the way, the brothers go back to their lifestyle, unconcerned their mother may be destitute, ill, and on the verge of dying.

He studied 1870-1874 at the Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp, then won a Royal subsidie from Prince Hendrik to study in Paris under P.J. Cavelier at the Beaux-Arts from 1874-1878. He won the Prix de Rome in 1881 to study a year in Italy and moved to Amsterdam in 1882. In 1885 he became a teacher at the Quellinusschool in Amsterdam and in 1889 he became a director there. He was a member of Arti et Amicitiae and became the chairman from 1909 to 1913. His pupils were Max Alexander Alandt, Jan Hendrik Baars, Thom Balfoort, Louise Beijerman, Gerard Bourgonjon, Leo Brom, Jan Bronner, Lambertus Franciscus Edema van der Tuuk, Annie Ermeling, August Falise, Chris Hammes, Albert Hemelman, Gerard Hoppen, Bernardus IJzerdraat, Hildo Krop, Louis Maria van der Maas, Joseph (II) Mendes da Costa, Elisabeth Francisca Nieuwenhuis, Frederik Amalius van Oostveen, John R√§decker, Theo van Reijn, Jan Rotgans, John Ruys, Lizzy Schouten, Jo Schreve-IJzerman, Anton Smeerdijk, Kees Smout, Jacobus Frederik Sterre de Jong, Henri Teixeira de Mattos, Frans Werner, Johannes Cornelis Wienecke, and Dirk Wolbers. Van Hove died, aged 63, in Amsterdam. Works As a respected teacher, Van Hove was often commissioned for public monuments. In 1886, he made the statues on top of the Teylers Museum in Haarlem on the Spaarne, entitled Science and Art crowned by Fortuna. The statues in the stairway to the auditorium were made by Van Hove in the 1880s to hold \\"electric lamps\\" since electricity was considered the trademark of the museum. The electric cords hanging sloppily down to the lamps suggests how new the idea was at the time (and that the lamps were probably first gas-lit). Van Hove made a similar group on the top of the high school in Amsterdam named after Barlaeus, and the statue of St. Nicolas on top of the Basilica of St. Nicholas, Amsterdam. In 1888 he created the statues on the top of the City Theater of Amsterdam that burned down in 1890. In 1890 he made the monument to G.F. Westerman, the first director of Artis.

The first issue was published in 1977; it began as a special- interest publication from the editors of Hot Rod magazine. 4-Wheel & Off-Road covered a range of topics for the do-it-yourself light-truck enthusiast, including real-world 4x4 performance modifications, new products and product evaluations, off-road event coverage, new-vehicle evaluations, travel, and lifestyle. In March 1978, the magazine officially became a monthly publication, and in 2013, 4-Wheel & Off-Road celebrated its 35th anniversary. It was published by the Motor Trend Group. On December 6, 2019, magazine- publishing industry news outlet Folio: reported the magazine was among 19 publications to be discontinued by Motor Trend Group by the end of 2019.TEN Publishing Is Shuttering 19 Car Magazines Folio:, December 6, 2019. Retrieved May 25, 2020.  History  When it was first published as a specialty magazine by Petersen Publishing Company, internal paperwork described the concept simply as a Petersen four-wheel and off-road magazine, with a title to be suggested later. The legal department trademarked Petersen's 4-Wheel & Off- Road, and the name of the magazine was officially born. Over the years, many readers and members of the automotive industry have referred to the magazine simply as \\"Petersen's.\\" In January 1991, the name and logo changed to Petersen's 4Wheel, with the magazine returning to its original name by the October issue of that same year. Although it is now published by Source Interlink Media, Petersen's remains in the name and on the logo. The first issue of 4-Wheel & Off-Road included new-truck road tests, hands-on tech stories, and a tire buyer's guide, and dirt bikes and vans were tested alongside the Jeep CJ-7, Ford F-250, and International Traveler. The popular Nuts & Bolts Q&A; technical column began in July 1978, while the industry-news column Drivelines came about in November 1987. Reflecting trends and interests in the industry, 4-Wheel & Off-Road also covered monster trucks heavily in the 1980s, with Bigfoot making its first appearance in May 1979. Themed issues in the magazine's history include \\"Dare to Be Different\\", \\"Ugly is In\\", \\"Homegrown How-Tos\\", \\"Jeep Thrills\\", and \\"4xFords\\". Chuck Norris was featured on the cover of the March 1987 issue of 4-Wheel & Off-Road, with the cover blurb \\"Chuck Norris Jumps into Off-Road Racing.\\" 4-Wheel & Off-Road went through a \\"daring\\" phase of placing cover vehicles in unnaturally settings via airbrush, such as a monster truck surfing down the face of a tsunami or one superimposed over a nuclear explosion. \\"Ugly Readers Rides\\" began in the August 1992 issue, spotlighting the emerging trend of beater trucks. January 2000 introduced the growing popularity of rock buggies. The February issue of the same year featured the first coverage of a competitive rockcrawling competition. Vehicle buildups, or project vehicles, have been a part of 4-Wheel & Off-Road since the January 1979 issue, which focused on building a street-worthy off-road van. Beginning in 1994, 4-Wheel & Off-Road shifted from show trucks to real-world trucks, a trend that continues today. Ultimate Adventure The 4-Wheel & Off-Road \\"Ultimate Adventure\\" was created by the magazine's editorial staff and consists of 20 handpicked 4x4s, including ones owned by readers, which travel to different regions of the country each year to conquer four to five extreme trails in one week. The first Ultimate Adventure appeared in the February 2000 issue, traveling the trails and pavement of Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado, and Ultimate Adventure has remained an annual event since then. Segments of Ultimate Adventure are broadcast on television on the Outdoor Channel. The project vehicles the magazine staff has built for Ultimate Adventure are: * Ultimate A1, 1952 M38A1 * Ultimate Super Duty, '02 Ford F-250 Super Duty * Ultimate Avalanche, '03 Chevy Avalanche 2500 * Ultimate Taco, '01 Toyota Tacoma * Ultimate K10, '75 Chevy half-ton * Ultimate FJ, '06 Toyota FJ Cruiser * UAJK, '07 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited * Ultimate Z71, ‚Äò00 GMC Sierra * Ultimate Ranch Truck, a rebuild of the Ultimate Super Duty * Ultimate CJ, ‚Äò76 Jeep CJ-7, later called the CJ-17 due to its B-17-inspired theme * Ultimate F-150, ‚Äò11 Ford F-150 EcoBoost * Ultimate JK, '12 Jeep Wrangler with the back half replaced with the front of another Wrangler * Ultimate Super Dirty, '13 Ford F-250 Super Duty turned into a regular cab shortbed. * Ultimate Tug Truck, '90 Dodge Diesel converted from a retired airplane tug into the Ultimate Adventure truck. * Ultimate Summer Camp Jeep, a custom body '46 Willys Jeep CJ2A powered by a 6.2L LSA engine (same engine as the Cadillac CTS-V) and a 6-speed GM 6L90 automatic transmission. * Ultimate Adventure CJ-6D, a chopped and channeled 1970 Jeep CJ-6 built on a shortened JKU frame with a Cummins R2.8 Turbo Diesel * Ultimate Adventure Deranged Rover, a Camel Trophy inspired 1989 Range Rover Classic also powered by a Cummins R2.8 Turbo Diesel * Ultimate Adventure Ultimate International, a 1964 International Harvester 800 with raised and stretched wheel openings, a chopped top and more. Event coverage In the first monthly issue of 4-Wheel & Off-Road, the staff rode along with Walker Evans as he raced in the Baja 1000, and both the 1000 and Baja 500 were covered extensively in the lifespan of the magazine. Editorial has also followed tough-truck racing, 4-Wheel & Off-Road Jamboree Nationals, Petersen's U.S. Truck Fest, 4-Wheel & Off-Road 4xFun Fests, sand drags, swamp buggy competitions, ice racing, truck and tractor pulls, mud bogging, SCORE, rockcrawling, competitive rockcrawling, Camel Trophy, Gravelrama, and trails throughout the U.S. and internationally, including Moab in Utah and the Black Hills in South Dakota. 4-Wheel & Off-Road has also tracked new-4x4 reveals at the North American Auto Show in Detroit and new products brought to the market by aftermarket companies at the annual SEMA Show. 4x4 of the Year The 4-Wheel & Off-Road \\"4x4 of the Year\\" award is one of the most prestigious in the automotive industry, bestowed annually upon a new factory 4x4 pickup truck or SUV that excels in five categories: Ride and Drive, Mechanical, Interior, Exterior, Four-Wheeling Attributes, and Empirical Data.

Literature *Marco Polo, in his travelogue known as The Travels of Marco Polo (ca. 1300), described the founder of the Assassins as a charlatan who devised plots to convert young men to his sect. At the \\"court\\" of the so-called \\"Old Man of the Mountain\\" \\"...they were educated in various languages and customs, courtly etiquette, and trained in martial and other skills\\". At the Castle of Alamut they had \\"...impressive libraries whose collections included books on various religious traditions, philosophical and scientific texts, and scientific equipment\\". *Dante, in the 19th canto of the Inferno (1308‚Äì1321), speaks of \`the treacherous assassin' (lo perfido assassin). The assassin also appear in the loosely based video game Dante's Inferno. Also known as \\"The Avenger\\" he was one of the Kurdish prisoners whom Dante was tasked with guarding at Acre during the crusades. In exchange for his freedom, as well as her own, the man's wife, who claimed to be his sister, offered to \\"comfort\\" Dante. Dante took her offer, which only further enraged the man. After the Siege of Acre, he travelled to Dante's villa in Florence, where he assaulted and killed both Alighiero and Beatrice. In the Hall of Gluttons, Dante learns that the Avenger was the slave girl's cuckolded husband, not his brother, when Lucifer makes him witness Beatrice's murder. He is seen again in the downloadable prequel Dark Forest. When Dante apprehends him, he repeats his line \\"She wasn't my sister! She was my wife!\\" *The most widespread awareness of the Assassins in modern Europe, and their incorporation into the Romantic tradition, was created by Austrian historian and Orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall though his 1818 book, Die Geschichte der Assassinen aus morgenl√§ndischen QuellenStuttgart und T√ºbingen, 1818 (translated into English in 1835 as The History of the AssassinsLondon, 1835; translated by O. C. Wood). This work was the standard one on the history of the Assassins in the West until the 1930s. *The 19th century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche gives prominent focus to what he terms \\"the Brotherhood of Assassins\\", in section 24 of On the Genealogy of Morality (1887). Nietzsche's signature work is to point to the worthlessness of religion, and to attempt at the transvaluation of values, that is, to transcend the inherited Jewish and Christian politics, psychology and ethics of ressentiment or guilt. He aims at going beyond the categories of good and evil since they suppress the full potential of the strong and talented. Nietzsche heralds the arrival of the so- called 'free spirits' who no longer believe in truth.On the Genealogy of Morals, by Friedrich Wilhem Nietzsche, Walter Arnold Kaufmann. p. 148 Thus, they alone are capable of redeeming the world of the modern ills of comfort, mediocrity, and nihilism. :Importantly, Nietzsche attacks the false spirits who are the host of self-describing 'unbelievers' of modern times who claim to reject religious deception as scholars and philosophers and yet retain the traditional beliefs in good and evil, and truth. Nietzsche compares the genuine free spirits with the Assassins: \\"When the Christian crusaders in the Orient came across that invincible order of Assassins ‚Äì that order of free spirits par excellence whose lowest order received, through some channel or other, a hint about that symbol and spell reserved for the uppermost echelons alone, as their secret: \\"nothing is true, everything is permitted\\". Now that was freedom of the spirit, with that, belief in truth itself was renounced.\\"On the Genealogy of Morals, by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, Walter Arnold Kaufmann. p. 150 *The character of Ax√´l, in French playwright Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's 1890 drama of that name, is modeled on the founder of the Assassins,Emanuel J. Mickel, in notes to The Complete Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea, published in 1993 by Indiana University Press, n. 90, pg 156. Hassan-i Sabbah, the so-called \\"Old Man of the Mountain\\".

Bartol's view of the Assassins is highly negative, seeing SabbƒÅh as unscrupulous and manipulative, and his followers as fanatics. Bartol was influenced by the recent assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the rise of totalitarianism in Europe. * In the novel The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber by Jin Yong, a group of Persian Zoroastrianism leaders who are trying to take over the Chinese derivative of the sect derived their martial arts from the assassins.

The clan still works out of Alamut and hires themselves out as assassins. * In the wargame Infinity, Hashashin are special troops that can be fielded by the Haqqislam faction, divided into four distinct types: snipers/poisoners, close-combat specialists, stealth experts who can pretend to be an enemy unit, and explosives specialists. * The Legend of the Five Rings CCG spin-off Legend Of The Burning Sands had a group called the Assassins in it, who excelled at killing in duels. While they were led by the \\"Old Man of the Mountain\\", most of the other characters in it were women. =Role-playing= Assassin is a character class common to many RPG games. Such characters typically combine elements of combat gaming with strong stealth skills, and specialise in defeating an enemy without becoming involved in a protracted melee. They are seen as the \\"fragile, but deadly\\" ninja-esque character class and are usually recommended to more experienced players in the game. * Assassin (Dungeons & Dragons) is a playable character class in the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role- playing game. It first appeared in 1975 in the Blackmoor supplement, as a thief sub-class. It next appeared in the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons again as a thief sub-class. It later appeared as an optional kit for rogues in the second edition and as prestige class in the third edition. Assassins are killers and spies; the class is modeled on perceptions of real- world historical assassins. * MMORPGs have Assassins in them, referred in as a job or class. * Assassins have appeared in games like Diablo 2, Ragnarok Online, Lineage II, World of Warcraft, MapleStory, Guild Wars, and Conquer Online. * Assassins appear in the Final Fantasy games series, such as Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, as well as the Fire Emblem game series. =Video games= * The Exile series of action role-playing games, first released by Telenet Japan in 1988, revolves around a time-traveling Syrian Assassin who assassinates various religious/historical figures and world leaders.Leo Chan, Sunsoft scores Telenet Japan franchises, Neoseeker, December 10, 2009 * The adventure game Broken Sword shows the main character following the trail of an Assassin preventing the reforging of a sword by the Templars. * In the fantasy role-playing video game Gothic 3, the Hashishin (completely based on Assassins) is a playable faction, located in the southern area of the World in the desert known as Varant. * Assassins appeared in the video games Knights of the Temple and its sequel Knights of the Temple II as enemies the player will encounter early in the game. * They also appear again as enemies in the medieval game The First Templar. * In Medieval II: Total War, Islamic factions can build Hashshashin Guilds in settlements where large numbers of spies and assassins are being recruited. Doing so improves the effectiveness of spies and assassins recruited there subsequently, as well as allowing the faction to produce specialized Hashshashin infantry units, which serve as small, elite heavy infantry capable of ambushing on the battlefield. * The Alik'r Warriors from The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is said to be based on the Hashshashin, a way that they're an organisation of assassins who come from a Middle Eastern-like setting ‚Äì albeit one based more on Morocco than Arabia. * Corvo Attano from Dishonored is an assassin getting revenge on the people who conspired against him and framed him for murder * According to the Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame's \\"bible\\", written by Jordan Mechner, the guards who protects Jaffar from the Prince in the last level are Assassins. * Dota 2 has a total of 5 assassins playable.

The poem discusses an alleged threat of annihilation of the Iranian people and the writer's fears that Germany's delivery to Israel of a sixth Dolphin-class submarine capable of carrying nuclear warheads might facilitate an eventual Israeli nuclear attack on Iran, and thus involve his country in a foreseeable crime.\\"Guenter Grass says Israel a threat to peace\\", [sic spelling of name], Associated Press, published in San Francisco Gate, 5 April 2012. *Aviel Magnezi, Israel no longer taboo in Germany?, Ynet News, 2 April 2012. Quote: \\"In his poem, published in the daily newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Grass condemns the plan to deliver a Dolphin submarine to Israel, a vessel with nuclear capabilities, and calls to supervise Israel's nuclear facilities.\\" *\\"G√ºnter Grass launches poetry attack on Israel\\", Associated Press, 4 April 2012. *For the sixth submarine, see Ravid, Barak. \\"Ehud Barak to sign deal for delivery of sixth German-made submarine\\", Haaretz, 19 March 2012. *Also see \\"UPDATE 1-Germany sells sub to Israel but warns on attacking Iran\\", Reuters, 20 March 2012. *Engelbrech, Sebastian. \\"Deutschland liefert U-Boot nach Israel\\", tagesschau.de, 20 March 2012. The poem was first published on 4 April 2012 by the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, La Repubblica and El Pa√≠s, triggering four days later the declaration by Eli Yishai, the Israeli Minister for the Interior, that Grass, who had visited Israel in 1967 and 1971,Lahav Harkov, Herb Keinon, Benjamin Weinthal,'Yishai declares Grass persona non-grata' at The Jerusalem Post, 8 April 2012.'Nur zweimal in Israel,' at Die Welt, 11 April 2012. was now persona non grata.Weinthal, Benjamin. \\"Berlin politicians split over Grass travel ban\\", The Jerusalem Post, 9 April 2012. Content The poem is written in prose and consists of 69 lines in 9 unrhymed stanzas. The basic theme is that it is hypocritical to blame Iran unilaterally for perhaps also having a desire to acquire nuclear weapons when Israel itself has a \\"growing nuclear potential\\". Grass adopts the assumption that Israel is planning a \\"first strike\\" preventive war against Iran that could wipe out the Iranian people. He deplores the fact that Germany is furnishing Israel with a submarine capable of delivering nuclear bombs, and says no one in the West dares to mention Israel in connection with nuclear weaponry.Uri Avnery,'Gunter the Terrible,' at Counterpunch, 13‚Äì15 April 2012. The author assesses that an attack on Iran would be a crime, to which Germany would become an accomplice. A noticeable stylistic theme is that in six of the nine sentences, the theme of silence is repeated as \\"silence\\", \\"general silence\\", or \\"forbidding myself to name [the country]\\". The author first asks himself \\"Why [was] I silent for so long?\\" and answers it with \\"because my heritage, which is forever burdened by an unclearing stain, prohibits, to deliver this fact as a spoken truth to the state of Israel, to which I feel ... and want to stay connected\\". Continuing, he is demanding that no further German \\"submarine shall be delivered to Israel, with the specialty of delivering annihilating warheads to where the existence of one single nuclear bomb is unproven\\". These are delivered by \\"my country, which is time after time caught-up ... for its very own and unprecedented crimes, ... on a pure commercial basis, even though declared with fast tongue as reparation\\". He continues that he feels it as an \\"incriminating lie and constraint\\". to keep the \\"general silence about these facts\\", even though it \\"promises punishment as soon as it is broached\\"‚Äîthe common verdict: \\"Anti-Semitism\\". He further criticises the \\"Western hypocrisy\\" and hopes \\"that many will want to get rid of their silence, to demand from the initiator of this recognizable danger [Israel], to abstinence from violence\\". Finally he demands that an \\"unhindered and permanent control of the Israeli nuclear arsenal and the Iranean nuclear complexes by an international authority will be allowed by the governments of both countries\\"; only this way \\"Israelis, Palestinians, and even more everybody who is living face to face as enemies in this region occupied by delusion and craziness, and last not least ourselves, can be helped\\". Reception =Political controversy= Translations were published in a number of countries, generating significant controversy, particularly in Germany and Israel. This intensified on 8 April, four days after publication, when Eli Yishai, Israel's Minister for the Interior, banned Grass from entering the country.\\"Minister wants Nobel Prize withdrawn: furious Israel bars G√ºnter Grass for critical poem\\". Spiegel Online International, 9 April 2012. The decision was based on a 1952 law barring former members of Nazi organizations from entering Israel. Yishai said: \\"Grass's poems are an attempt to guide the fire of hate toward the State of Israel and the Israeli people, and to advance the ideas of which he was a public partner in the past, when he wore the uniform of the SS.\\"Azriel, Guy. \\"German poet declared unwelcome in Israel\\", The Guardian, 9 April 2012. This was a reference to Grass's acknowledgement in 2006 that he had been drafted into the Waffen-SS when he was 17 years old.Kundnani, Hans. \\"Child's play\\", Prospect magazine, 19 November 2006. The Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, said the decision \\"smacked of populism\\". In announcing the ban, Yishai also demanded that the author should have his Nobel Prize withdrawn. The Swedish Academy responded by stating that no discussion has, or will, take place concerning the rescinding of his award. Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman criticized the \\"egoism of so-called Western intellectuals, who are willing to sacrifice the Jewish people on the altar of crazy anti-Semites for a second time, just to sell a few more books or gain recognition\\" and demanded that European leaders condemn the work. Avi Primor, former Israeli ambassador to the European Union and to Germany, argued that the poem violated a taboo of German public discourse, where there is a fear of criticizing Israel; Grass was drawing attention to the hypocrisy of saying behind closed doors what cannot be said in public. Primor added that there is no anti-Semitism in Grass's work, that his publications have been opposed to Nazism, and that it is a mistake to link the poem to his membership of the Waffen-SS, given that he repudiated Nazi ideology. \\"It is important to pay attention to the message of the poem,\\" he said.Magnezi, Aviel. \\"Israel no longer taboo in Germany?\\", YNet News, 9 April 2012. German Health Minister Daniel Bahr told Die Welt that the Israeli government's reaction had been \\"totally excessive\\".\\"'Israel's Government Has Reacted Absurdly'\\", Spiegel Online International, 10 April 2012. Regarding the poem itself, he said that it was \\"sad to see that someone who has experienced all the controversies of post-war Germany remains marked by so much prejudice and stubbornness\\". Philipp Missfelder, chairman of the Junge Union and a member of the Bundestag, said the poem \\"plays into the hands of the Iranian aggressor. That is fatal and goes well beyond a so-called friendly critique.\\" The Iranian deputy culture minister, Javad Shamaqdari, offered effusive praise of the poem in a letter to Grass: \\"I have read your literary work, highly responsible both from a human and historical point of view, and I found it extremely timely. Telling the truth in such a way may truly awaken the west's silent and dormant conscience\\".\\"Iran congratulates Gunter Grass\\",Agenzia Giornalistica Italia, 7 April 2012. And Iran's state- owned Press TV said: \\"Never before in Germany's postwar history has a prominent intellectual attacked Israel in such a courageous way. Metaphorically speaking, the poet has launched a deadly lyrical strike against Israel.\\" In an interview with the German newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the poem was \\"shameful\\" and constituted a \\"collapse of moral judgment\\", and that Grass had \\"created a perfect moral misrepresentation...where the firefighter and not the arsonist becomes the true danger\\". =Response from literary figures= Hamid Dabashi, who teaches literature at New York's Columbia University, argued that the poem's importance lay in the context of the author being ostracized by the content of his own work: \\"The daring imagination of G√ºnter Grass' poem‚Äîa heroically tragic act precisely because the poet is implicated in the moral outrage of his own poem‚Äîis significant precisely because it captures this German and by extension European logic/madness of colonial conquest and moral cannibalism.\\"Dabashi, Hamid. \\"G√ºnter Grass, Israel and the crime of poetry\\", Al Jazeera, 10 April 2012. Klaus Staeck, president of the Berlin academy of art, told reporters, \\"It's got to be possible to speak openly without being denounced as an enemy of Israel.\\"Harding, Luke and Sherwood, Harriet. \\"G√ºnter Grass's Israel poem provokes outrage\\", The Guardian, 5 April 2012. In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki called Grass's text \\"a disgusting poem\\", opining that its sole purpose was to cause a scandal and draw attention to himself, and that he knew attacking Jews would achieve this.Volker, Weidermann. \\"Es ist ein ekelhaftes Gedicht\\", Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 8 April 2012. The German-born Israeli writer, ex-Knesset member and political activist Uri Avnery argues that, while the text can certainly be criticised‚Äîthe idea of Israel \\"wiping out\\" the Iranians in a preventive \\"first strike\\" is wildly exaggerated‚Äîthere is nothing in it demanding 'stern condemnation'. There is, he adds, 'no reason for Germans to abstain from criticizing Israel', and there is nothing in Grass's poem that de-legitimizes the State of Israel. Indeed, to the contrary, Grass has, he notes, declared his solidarity with that country.Uri Avnery, 'Gunter the Terrible,' at Counterpunch, 13‚Äì15 April 2012. The Hebrew Writers Association in Israel threatened to call for International PEN to distance itself from Grass.Sela, Maya. \\"Israeli writers call on international literary community to rebuke Gunter Grass\\", Haaretz, 9 April 2012. An Israeli poet, Itamar Yaoz-Kest, published a poem in response, entitled \\"The Right to Exist: a Poem-Letter to the German Author\\", which addresses Grass by name. It contains the line: \\"If you force us yet again to descend from the face of the Earth to the depths of the Earth‚Äîlet the Earth roll toward the Nothingness.\\" This is seen as referring to the Samson Option, Israel's alleged deterrence strategy of massive retaliation with nuclear weapons as a \\"last resort\\" against nations whose military attacks threaten its existence.Ronen, Gil. \\"Israeli Letter-poem to Grass: If We Go, Everyone Goes\\", Israel National News, 8 April 2012. Uri Avnery called it: \\"polemic in the guise of a poem\\".Uri Avnery, Gunter the Terrible, at CounterPunch, 13‚Äì15 April 2012. D. G. Myers said that it gave expression to a \\"new European anti-Semitism that pretends it is merely anti-Zionism\\".D. G. Myers, \\"Poison Pen\\", Jewish Ideas Daily, April 16, 2012. =Other responses= Grass has struck a nerve with the broader public, articulating frustrations with Israel in Germany that are frequently expressed in private but rarely in public. Demonstrators in several German cities showed their support for Grass during the annual Osterm√§rsche (anti-war protests).Goldman, Yoel. \\"Support for G√ºnter Grass takes center stage at German anti-war protests\\", The Times of Israel, 7 April 2012. *\\"Friedensaktivisten unterst√ºtzen G√ºnter Grass\\", Der Spiegel, 9 April 2012. On 7 April, someone in G√∂ttingen wrote \\"shut your mouth\\" in red paint on a sculpture commissioned and donated by Grass to commemorate free speech.\\"Germany official: Israel‚Äôs reaction to Grass' criticism 'exaggerated'\\". Haaretz, 9 April 2012. The Guardian's Jerusalem correspondent, Harriet Sherwood, wrote: \\"Amid the torrent of denunciation, some Israeli commentators said Grass had raised an important issue and that criticism of Israeli policies was routinely portrayed as antisemitism.\\"Sherwood, Harriet.\\"G√ºnter Grass barred from Israel over poem\\", The Guardian, 8 April 2012. Tariq Ali made the same complaint in his survey of the reactions, in an article in Counterpunch, arguing that Grass had foreseen the reactions, and that criticism of his poem in Germany assumed that 'all Germans are guilty for eternity for the crimes of the Third Reich'.Tariq Ali, The Disgusting Attacks on Guenter Grass, at Counterpunch, 10 April 2012. The poem was defended by a number of Jewish and Israeli individuals. The Israeli decision was criticized in an editorial in Haaretz, Israel's oldest daily newspaper was headed, \\"Israel has reacted with hysteria over Gunter Grass.\\"\\"On Guenter Grass, Israel has reacted with hysteria\\", Haaretz editorial, 9 April 2012. Journalist Larry Derfner wrote: \\"G√ºnter Grass told the truth, he was brave in telling it, he was brave in admitting that he'd been drafted into the Waffen SS as a teenager, and by speaking out against an Israeli attack on Iran, he's doing this country a great service at some personal cost while most Israelis and American Jews are safely following the herd behind Bibi [Netanyahu] over the cliff.\\" Several distinct views were run in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Writer Gideon Levy said of Grass and the writer Jos√© Saramago, another critic of Israeli policies: \\"After we denounce the exaggeration, after we shake off the unjustified part of the charge, we must listen to these great people. They are not anti-Semites, they are expressing the opinion of many people. Instead of accusing them we should consider what we did that led them to express it.Levy, Gideon. \\"Israelis can be angry with Gunter Grass, but they must listen to him\\", at Haaretz, 8 April 2012. In the same newspaper, Anshel Pfeffer argued that: \\"Logic and reason are useless when a highly intelligent man, a Nobel laureate no less, does not understand that his membership in an organization that planned and carried out the wholesale genocide of millions of Jews disqualifies him from criticizing the descendants of those Jews for developing a weapon of last resort that is the insurance policy against someone finishing the job his organization began. What could be more self- evident?\\"Pfeffer, Anshel.\\"The moral blindness of Gunter Grass,\\" at Haaretz, 6 April 2012 Ravit Hecht wrote that Grass had been the object of an 'unbridled assault' for thinking differently, and criticised the ease with which the Holocaust is pulled out, desecrating its memory, every time something disturbs the elected leadership or \\"the masses of Israelis\\" in order to arouse nationalist feelings and make political capital out of them, something more troubling than Grass' disparaging poem.Ravit Hecht, \\"What on earth can Gunter Grass and Ido Kozikaro have in common?,\\" at Haaretz 12 April 2012 =Grass's rejoinder= Grass told the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung that the poem was aimed at the current Israeli government, not the country as a whole. He voiced particular criticism of the government's policy of continuing to build settlements despite a United Nations' resolution.Aderet, Ofer and the Associated Press. \\"Gunter Grass: Poem critical of Netanyahu's Iran policy, not Israel\\", Haaretz, 7 April 2012. He said that, with hindsight, he should have made it clearer that it was the government he was criticizing. Netanyahu, he said, was damaging Israel. He added: \\"I have often supported Israel, I have often been in the country and want the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbours.\\" On 11 April, in an article for the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, Grass compared the ban on his entering Israel to his treatment by dictatorships in Myanmar and East Germany. Translations Translations of the poem were published in national newspapers and their websites from 5 April 2012.For example, In Norway, a national newspaper published a translation on 10 April.

Sheepfold (1893) In 1878 Bastert, following a winter course at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, and met with Hein Kever and Theo Hanrath. He then traveled with Poggenbeek through Switzerland, Italy and France, a period Bastert would describe as \\"a great pleasure\\". He studied at the Koninklijke Academie voor Schone Kunsten in Antwerp in 1879 and about the same time became a member of Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam and the Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij. Between 1880 and 1882 he lived and worked with Poggenbeek in Amsterdam, in the studio of Poggenbeek at the City Gardens. Together they would often travel to a cottage in Breukelen in the next seven years to paint Dutch landscapes. There Bastert did many paintings near the river Vecht, both in Breukelen and Maarssen Nieuwersluis. In 1882 Bastert had a private studio in The Hague. His style was strongly influenced by the painters of the Hague School. He soon attracted attention with his work. The art critic Jan Veth called him in May 1888 \\"The king of light\\". He wrote: \\" In the place where Bastert's paintings hang, there is a window through which one can behold all the glory of the Vecht.\\" From 1885 it was regularly sold his work, which allowed him to develop his own style. During his time in The Hague, Bastert often felt lonely. In 1885, therefore, he moved into a studio in the State Oosterpark in Amsterdam, next to that of Poggenbeek. Later, after his marriage to Eva Versteeg, he settled on the estate Zwaanvecht te Nigtevecht. In the first decades of the twentieth century, he often painted in the picturesque village of Heeze. Bastert won gold medals at exhibitions in Amsterdam, Munich and Paris. He was a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, Arti et Amicitiae in Amsterdam and the Pulchri Studio in The Hague, where most of the Were members were in the Hague School. His pupils were Constantia Arnolda Balw√©, Leo Kurpershoek, Marie van Regteren Altena, and Eva Emmelina Seelig. Bastert died in 1939, at the age of 85, in Loenen aan de Vecht. In 1895 the Van Wisselingh firm of art dealers had a solo exhibition of Bastert's works and after his death they did the same for his later works.

It includes extensive woodland and wetland habitats and is managed by the Natural History Society of Northumbria. Access to the reserve is restricted to NHSN members and those in possession of a valid day pass. Dog walking and other recreational activities are not permitted on site. The reserve is part of Gosforth Park, the old estate of Gosforth House. History In medieval times, what is now Gosforth Nature Reserve would have been agricultural land, there is some remaining evidence of ridge and furrow. The general habitat in the area would have been heathland, hence the name of the nearby village of West Moor and the nearby track called Heathery Lane. When the Brandling family took over the land and built their large estate house they had the surrounding area landscaped, as was the fashion of the day. This included planting new woodland and creating a new lake for boating and fishing. From historic maps it appears that the lake was created in the period 1810‚Äì1820 and that most of the woodland was planted around the mid-19th century. The Brandling family fell on hard times and sold off the estate towards the end of the 19th century and from that period onwards nature began to take over. In 1924 in order to prevent hunting and shooting of the wildlife Mr W. E. Beck leased the shooting rights for the lake and surrounding woodland. He was a member of the Natural History Society of Northumbria and in 1929, in declining health, he passed his rights to the trustees of the Society. Since that time the Society has managed this area for the benefit of wildlife. Habitats and wildlife Gosforth Nature Reserve contains an important wetland, which is dominated by Phragmites reeds and open water and surrounded by wet carr woodland. These wetland habitats support breeding bird species such as reed warbler, water rail, reed bunting, sedge warbler, common tern and little grebe and in the winter birds such as bittern, kingfisher, wigeon, teal and shoveler. Aquatic mammals such as otter. water vole and water shrew are also present. England's second largest colony of coralroot orchid is also found here. Woodland in the reserve The majority of the reserve is semi-natural woodland, dominated by oak and birch, however, there are also some plantations of conifers. Woodland mammals such as badger, fox, roe deer and stoat can be found and red squirrel are also still present. Most importantly the woodland supports a wide range of insects, including many uncommon species. There is also a small area of meadow, which contains plants such as heather and northern marsh orchid. Site of Special Scientific Interest Gosforth Park Nature Reserve was designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) in 1977. The citation includes: > The locality is regionally important for its aquatic, grassland and woodland > invertebrate faunas which include two nationally rare species, a small > beetle Triplax scutellaris and Adrena alfkenella, a solitary bee. Ownership and public access The nature reserve is still part of Newcastle Racecourse, which is owned by Arena Racing Company. It lies to the north-east of the Whitebridge Park housing estate. It is leased to the Natural History Society of Northumbria. In order to minimize disturbance to sensitive wildlife, there is no public access to the nature reserve, and there are no public rights of way. The reserve is open to members of the Natural History Society of Northumbria; non-members can buy day-permits upon arrival. NHSN holds regular public open days on-site and hosts a range of activities for school groups and local people.

It was produced by Reich and stars Hoyle, an English performance artist, in the titular role alongside English pornographic actor Ashley Ryder. Developed collectively under the banner of the Avant-Garde Alliance, it was filmed in October 2009. Created without a script, every scene was improvised and filmed in a single take. Set in a caravan park on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, South East England, a young man with a childlike mind named Ashley (Ryder) arrives to stay with his Uncle David (Hoyle). Escaping from his abusive mother, Ashley enters into a sexual relationship with his uncle who offers his insights into the world and the nature of reality. Eventually Ashley tells David that he wants to die, and David agrees to carry out the killing. The film premiered on 25 March 2010 at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival held in the BFI Southbank in central London. Reviews were mixed, but the film won several awards at international film festivals. It was released on DVD by Peccadillo Pictures in 2011. Plot Late one night, Ashley (Ashley Ryder) ‚Äì a young man with a childlike mentality ‚Äì arrives at the caravan home of his Uncle David (David Hoyle) on the Isle of Sheppey. Ashley confides in his uncle that his mother has been physically abusing him by stubbing cigarettes out on his hand. David lambasts the mother and society in general; the two embrace in a kiss before going to bed together. The next morning, they awake and have breakfast in bed before David bathes Ashley in the bathtub, telling him a story about an unhappy nuclear family. Going to a local caf√© and then a park bench, David continues to explain his anti- establishment opinions about society. Ashley reveals that he wants to die, and the two express their love for one another. The pair snort cocaine before playing in the local entertainment arcade. Returning to the caravan, they engage in sexual strangulation and anal sex. Putting on make-up, they then drink wine and dance to a remix of the Muse song \\"Uprising\\", while same-sex pornography starring Ashley plays on the television set. While Ashley puts on drag, David encourages him to kill himself, telling him that he is \\"too nice for this Earth\\" and needs to escape the world's problems. The next morning, Ashley plays on the beach and builds sand castles. When Ashley's drunken mother phones, demanding to know where her son is, Uncle David feigns ignorance, telling her that he himself is not in Sheppey but in Manchester. Taking Ashley to an abandoned military bunker, he injects an unknown substance into his nephew's vein as they kiss. Ashley enters an altered state of consciousness, and David guides him back to the caravan as they smoke marijuana. Once there, David gives Ashley a second injection, as they sit and look out at the shore. After dark, David places his near-catatonic nephew in a dog bed, showing him a copy of a picture book titled Is Britain Great?. He proceeds to give him a third and final injection, which he remarks will make Ashley lose consciousness and suffer organ failure. As Ashley dies, David professes that he has never loved anyone else as much before. The next morning, he goes onto the beach to place his nephew's body in a shallow grave, tearfully kissing the body goodbye before it is swept away by the sea. Production =Background= Hoyle performing at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern According to The Guardian, Hoyle became \\"something of a legend\\" on the British cabaret circuit during the 1990s, initially under the alter-ego of \\"The Divine David\\".Walters 2010. The Divine David was an \\"anti-drag queen\\" who combined \\"lacerating social commentary\\" with \\"breathtaking instances of self- recrimination and even self-harm.\\" Taking this character to television, Hoyle produced two shows for Channel 4, The Divine David Presents (1999) and The Divine David Heals (2000), before killing off the character at a farewell show at Streatham Ice Arena, south London, titled The Divine David on Ice (2000). Independently, Hoyle appeared in the film Velvet Goldmine (1998) and the television series Nathan Barley (2005). Ryder had hoped to be a fashion designer, undertaking a course at Central Saint Martins which he did not complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and then for the designer Vivienne Westwood. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in such films as Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made Uncle David, he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London. Hoyle and Ryder met at a performance art event, after which the former asked Ryder if he would appear in one of his stage shows. Ryder was busy at the time, but agreed to the request several years later. Staged at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern (RVT), a gay bar in Vauxhall, South London, the duo constructed a piece in which Ryder played the role of Hoyle's nephew in an ad-lib performance. Hoyle played a department store Santa Claus while Ryder portrayed a misbehaving nine-year- old. The performance ended in Hoyle's Santa character pulling Christmas tinsel from the child's anus before strangling him. Reich ‚Äì who had known Hoyle since the late 1990s ‚Äì was in the audience, and enjoyed the chemistry between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over the course of a day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued to develop their characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations. =Development= Uncle David was filmed over five days in October 2009 on the Isle of Sheppey, a location chosen for its proximity to London.Urquhart 2011. Hoyle commented that the profusion of barbed wire fences there made him wonder if they were \\"keeping people out or keeping people in?\\". Reich said that he had been \\"obsessed\\" with Sheppey, a place he had considered \\"a truly Godforsaken wasteland\\" since working on a television show there ten years previously. He remarked that the \\"trailer trash setting\\" of the film was influenced by Harmony Korine's Gummo (1997) and John Waters' Female Trouble (1974). He also said that the filming budget of under ¬£1000 was a homage to \\"the spirit of John Waters.\\" All the extras featured in the film were real inhabitants of Sheppey, and to film a scene in a local cafe, they walked in and asked the proprietors if they could shoot there. Although they had planned to tell any enquirers who approached them that they were shooting a horror film, during the shoot none of the locals expressed any interest in the crew's activities. Boy George contributed a song to the film. The caravan park was largely empty at the time, and closed for winter several days after filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he felt that it was \\"quite hectic but [had] a great atmosphere\\". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder remained in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they \\"wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered.\\" During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that \\"I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer.\\" Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that \\"When I was 14, I had ‚Äì let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [Uncle David] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, for the rest of your life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. I just went with my instincts and intuition.\\" The footage was captured on two Sony HVR-Z1 camcorders. Costumes had been purchased at an Oxfam charity shop in Dalston, East London, while a wig worn by Ashley in one scene was purchased from a Dalston wig store. Knowing that he would appear nude in several scenes, Ryder went to the gym regularly in the weeks proceeding filming to gain greater muscle tone. He decided to include footage from one of his pornographic videos in Uncle David, inspired to do so after learning that serial killers Fred and Rosemary West screened pornography throughout the day in their home. The composer Richard Thomas, co-creator of the controversial Jerry Springer: The Opera, agreed to produce a musical score for the film, having long been a fan of Hoyle's work.Logan 2012. After the cast and crew listened to a Muse album while driving between locations, they decided to include the band's work as they felt it was \\"empowering\\". They had also planned to include a song by Antony and the Johnsons in the film, but this was scrapped, to be replaced by a track by Boy George. After the film was screened for Boy George, the first person outside the Avant-Garde Alliance to see it, he commented \\"well it ain't The Sound of Music\\". Release The film premiered at the BFI Southbank (pictured). Uncle David premiered on 25 March 2010 at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival held in the BFI Southbank in central London. Attending the screening was Steve Marmion, the boss of Soho Theatre, who suggested to Reich and Hoyle that they produce a theatrical adaptation of the film. They initially showed an interest in the project; Reich commented that \\"It was a very mischievous concept, doing an upbeat, life-affirming song-and-dance musical with that storyline and subject matter.\\" However, the theatrical adaptation never surfaced, something Thomas attributed to the difficulty in obtaining funding for a musical on such a \\"dark subject.\\" Instead, Hoyle and Thomas teamed up to produce Merrie Hell, an \\"alternative Christmas celebration\\" that appeared at the Soho Theatre in December 2012. A two-man cabaret that differed every night, it featured Thomas on a piano, accompanying Hoyle's rendition of various songs about Christmas and Britain's societal problems; Thomas described it as \\"David Hoyle at Christmas ‚Äì the Musical\\". One of the songs featured in Merrie Hell, \\"It's Alright to Want to Die\\", carried a pro-suicide theme influenced by Uncle David. =Home media= In December 2011, Uncle David was released as a Region Free DVD by the company Peccadillo Pictures, a UK based film distributor of art house, gay and lesbian, independent and world cinema. The release contained several extras, including the three preparatory shorts detailing the relationship between the characters of Ashley and Uncle David and a cast commentary track voiced by Hoyle, Ryder, Reich and Nicholls. Reviewing the DVD release for the Sex Gore Mutants website, Stuart Willis noted that the disc contained periods of \\"murkiness or softness in the picture\\" and a few \\"(infrequent) instances of muffling\\", all of which he put down to the original production values of the film. British gay magazine Attitude celebrated the DVD's release with a competition to win one of three copies; they described the film as \\"a bit surreal, but totally amazing.\\"Attitude 2011. Reception =Awards= The film received a number of awards at international film festivals. At the 2010 Paris International LGBT Film Festival it won the best film award and Hoyle and Ryder shared the best actor award.Gordon 2011. It also won best film at the 2011 Berlin Porn Film Festival,Berlin Porn Film Festival 2011. and best film at the 2011 Erotic Awards.Erotic Awards 2011. Reich expressed surprise at the Erotic Award, because he did not consider the film to be a work of erotica, but discovered that they'd won because they had explored \\"an extreme fetish that to be honest we'd not actually heard of nor knew we were exploring.\\"Matt 2011. =Reviews= Ashley playing on the beach; the distinctive muted landscape photography helped to create the atmosphere of the film. Reviews of Uncle David were mixed. Writing in The Guardian, Ben Walters noted that \\"suspense and dread accumulate as the low-key naturalism and the characters' obvious affection for one another play off against the enormity of what looms ahead.\\" Comparing Uncle David to Hoyle's earlier stage work, he felt that the two were \\"consistent\\", but that in the film Hoyle abandoned the \\"fireworks of his performance persona\\", opting for a \\"controlled, beguiling style\\". He believed that Ryder's familiarity with being filmed meant that he carried a \\"disarmingly ingenuous presence, by turns determined and naive.\\" Walters opined that the film's \\"menacing\\" use of British seaside locations was similar to that in Brighton Rock and London to Brighton, while he also drew comparisons to Badlands, Bonnie and Clyde and The Talented Mr. Ripley, in that in all of them, the viewers' sympathy for the characters eclipses moral judgement of their actions. Walters would follow this with another review published in Time Out, in which he awarded the film five stars out of five.Walters 2011. \\"Not to everyone's taste, granted, [Uncle David] is nevertheless an original and disturbing take on modern love stories\\" was the view of Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a \\"pleasant surprise\\", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer to get to know the characters \\"almost without realising.\\" He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming a young man in a way that was both \\"pathetic and truly sinister all at once\\". Rather than falling into \\"tasteless exploitation\\", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as \\"beautifully atmospheric\\" and the music as \\"fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well\\", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.Willis 2011. Other reviewers were far more critical. Writing for the So So Gay website, Damien Ryan gave Uncle David a rating of 0.5 out of 5, describing it as \\"terrible\\". Believing that the film simply intended to shock viewers with its taboo subject matter, he felt offended by the story's \\"sheer inelegance\\". Opining that it reminded him of \\"the very worst attempt of a first-year film student\\", he questioned the description of Uncle David as a \\"black comedy\\", arguing that it wasn't at all funny, instead labelling it \\"the most vapid, transparent attempt at shock this side of a Lady Gaga performance.\\" Criticising the acting, he said that Ryder \\"shouldn't quit his porn day job any time soon\\" and that Hoyle's character was simply a \\"marriage of wannabe Holden Caulfield-style outsider and mincing paedophile.\\"Ryan 2011. Cleaver Patterson was similarly critical in his review on the Cine-Vue website, awarding the film one out of five stars. He questioned the purpose of the film, arguing that it will only serve to alienate the gay population by portraying them as \\"sad, perverted and ultimately lonely individuals.\\" More positively, he praised the appearance of the film with its \\"muted colours of the shingle beaches and piercing blue skies\\".Patterson 2011.

Because existence itself is believed to be dependent upon the tension and balanced interchange between the polarities, there is a very definite ideological and practical commitment within indigenous Andean life to bringing the seemingly conflicting opposites into harmony with one another without destroying or altering either one. Among the indigenous people of Peru and Bolivia, the union of opposing yet interdependent energies is called yanantin or \\"complementary opposites.\\"  Etymology  In the Quechua language, the prefix yana- means ‚Äùhelp,‚Äù while its suffix -ntin means ‚Äúinclusive in nature, with implications of totality, spatial inclusion of one thing in another, or identification of two elements as members of the same category\\".Platt, 1986, p. 245 Put together, yanantin has been translated as ‚Äúthe complement of difference.‚Äù However, according to some Andeans: :For us, yanantin doesn‚Äôt focus on the differences between two beings. That is what disconnects them. Instead, we focus on the qualities that brought them together. That is yanantin. We don‚Äôt really see the differences. That‚Äôs why we see them as not necessarily opposed, but as complementary. One on its own can‚Äôt hold everything, can‚Äôt take care of everything. Not only are they great together, but they need to be together. There is no other way. When there is another, it represents extra strength for both.Webb, 2012, p. 24 Some scholarsUrton, 1988 break down the word yanantin slightly differently, translating yana- as ‚Äúblack‚Äù in the sense of ‚Äúdark‚Äù or ‚Äúobscure,‚Äù and contrast it to ‚Äúlight‚Äù (rather than in the sense of ‚Äúblack‚Äù as opposed to ‚Äúwhite‚Äù).  Relevance to indigenous Andean life  Because the relationship of opposites as a harmonious partnership is considered the primary organizing principle of creation, yanantin infuses all aspects of social and spiritual life within the indigenous Andean worldview. Platt (1986) cited two examples of yanantin from his work with the Macha of Bolivia. When drinks are served, the Macha pour a few drops on the ground as an offering, while at the same time speaking the name of the receiving divinity. This is done twice. ‚ÄúThis is explained as being yanantin, for the conjugal pair‚Äù.Platt, 1986, p. 245 When coca leaves (the most sacred plant of the Andes and an integral part of almost all indigenous ceremonies) are offered to a participant in a ritual, two handfuls are offered to each person, who receives them in two cupped hands. Platt (1986) wrote, ‚ÄúIn all such cases, the pairing and the repetitions are explained as being yanantin.\\" In Yanantin and Masinitin in the Andean World, Hillary Webb notes that the relationship between entities or energies is the essential component within indigenous Andean worldview, involving, ‚Äúthe relationship, the alliance, the meeting, and the unity between two beings.\\"Webb (2012), p. 37 Yanantin contrasts with chhulla, which refers to something that is unequal or odd‚Äî‚Äúone of things which should be twice.\\"Platt, 1986, p. 245 According to Vasquez (1998), the Quechua of Cajamarca say that something that is incomplete is referred to as chuya [alternate spelling], meaning ‚Äúthe one who is missing its other.\\"Vasquez (1998), p. 100 Vasquez explained, ‚ÄùIn order to be whole, one has to pair up.\\"Harrison (1989), p. 100 Whether something is paired or unpaired is an important distinction within the Andean cosmovision. Regina Harrison noted, ‚ÄúQuechua speakers persistently distinguish objects which are not well matched or ‚Äòequal‚Äô.Harrison (1989), p. 49 According to Platt, yanantin is the act of rendering equal two things that were once unequal‚Äîwhat he calls ‚Äúthe correction of inequalities.\\"Platt (1986), p. 251 Likewise, some indigenous Andeans believe the following. > ‚Ä¶ [U]npartnered people are missing an important part of them. They say that > when you don‚Äôt have a partner, you are only half of a being. Alone, you are > precious, you are unique, but you are only part. You are not whole yet. This > is because when you are by yourself, you are either accumulating so much > that it is overwhelming or you are draining yourself so much that you become > weak. Because of that, you will feel fear or confused or lost. ‚Ä¶ you may > know yourself, but you can never see yourself. For that you need another > person. You need other eyes, another perspective to see that. When you are a > child, you have your parents, but when you become older you no longer have > your parents to see you, to recognize you. As an adult, your yanantin, your > partner, is the person who is there to see what you don‚Äôt see in yourself, > just as you are there to see in that person what he doesn‚Äôt see in himself. > That is why it is easier to take care of another person than of > yourself‚Äîbecause you are not supposed to take care of yourself! For that, > there is the other person.Webb, 2012, p. 139 It has thus been implied that a perfect yanantin relationship is achieved when two energies are brought into harmony. Among the Macha, Platt explained, ‚ÄúThe elements to be paired must first be ‚Äòpared‚Äô to achieve the ‚Äòperfect fit.‚Äô Here the crucial notion is that of the sharing of boundaries in order to create a harmonious co-existence.\\"  Masintin  The Quechua word masintin is often used in tandem with yanantin, as in yanantin-masintin. This indicates the process by which the yanantin pair becomes ‚Äúpared‚Äù in Platt‚Äôs terms, or harmonized to achieve a perfect fit. Webb‚Äôs research participants described masintin as, ‚Äúthe process, the experience of that yanantin relationship.‚Äù :Masintin is what is materialized. It is what is self realized, not what stays in theory. Masintin is to enter into the spirit and the essence of anything, of the thing. Of what has been materialized. Of what has been imagined. You must enter into the spirit of it. Masintin is to create, recreate, and procreate.Webb (2012), p. 37  See also  * Pacha Notes  References  * Ajaya, S. (1983).

His subsequent travels in Europe led to the writing of two volumes of memoirs of this trip, which were published in 1824. From 1830 to 1831, he was Member of Parliament for St Albans, with James Grimston. He supported the Reform Act 1832. In 1830 he was one of the founders of the National Colonisation Society, advocating emigration to British colonies.

Education is a basic human right and has been recognized as such since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the gross national product and increase of life expectancy. Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of the investment in human capital in any society.Schultz, T.P.

A Paper presented at the Second Tripartite Conference of Manpower Planners. Chelsea Hotel, Abuja. To ensure equal access to education, the National Policy on Education states that access to education is a right for all Nigerian children regardless of gender, religion and disability. History Before 1920, primary and secondary education in Nigeria was within the scope of voluntary Christian organizations. Out of a total of 25 secondary schools established by 1920, three were girls only and the remainder were exclusively for boys. In 1920, the colonial government started giving out subvention to voluntary associations involved in education, the grant-giving lasted till the early 1950s and at that point, education was placed under the control of regions. In 1949, only eight out of a total of 57 secondary schools were exclusively for girls. These schools are Methodist Girls' High School, Lagos (1879), St Anne's School, Molete, Ibadan (1896), St. Theresa's College, Ibadan (1932), Queens College, Lagos, (1927) Holy Rosary College, Enugu (1935), Anglican Girls Grammar School, Lagos, (1945), Queen Amina College and Alhuda College, Kano. From 1950 up till 1960, six more notable schools were established and by 1960, there were fourteen notable girl's schools, ten mixed and sixty-one boys only. ; 1960s : In the 1960s, when most African states began to gain their political independence, there was considerable gender disparity in education.Swann, J. and Graddol, D. (1988) 'Gender equalities in the classroom talk'. English Education 22/1:48-65 Girls' enrollment figures were very low throughout the continent. In May 1961, the United Nation's Universal Declaration of Human Rights and UNESCO's educational plans for Nigeria were announced in a conference held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A target was set: to achieve 100% universal primary education in Nigeria by the year 1980.Conference of African States on the Development of Education in Africa Addis Ababa, 15‚Äì25 May 1961 unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000774/077416e.PDF ; 1970s :The implementation in the 1970s of the free and compulsory Universal Primary Education (UPE) was in line with this UN Plan.UNESCO. Gender and education for all: the leap for equality. Global monitoring report 2003/2004. http:// WWW.UNESCO/oc.UNESCO.org/education/eta-report/2003- PDF/chapter3.PDF. Ever since, UNICEF and UNESCO and many other organizations have sponsored, research and conferences within Nigeria regarding the education of girls. Up until the 1970s, considerably more boys than girls participated in education in Nigeria. According to one Nigerian Historian Kitetu, the native traditions' philosophy was that a woman's place is at home and this kept many girls away from education. However, with the government's intervention and public awakening, parents began to send and keep their girl children in school. Consequently, women's involvement became more visible. ; 1990s : It can be noted that purposeful plans of action led to an increase in females in schools after 1990. While more boys than girls were enrolled in 1991, a difference of 138,000, by 1998 the difference was only 69,400. At the pan-African Conference held at Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, in March and April 1993 (three decades after the UN Declaration of the 1960s) it was observed that Nigeria was still lagging behind other regions of the world in female access to education.Kitetu, C (2001). ‚ÄòGender in education: an overview of developing trends in Africa‚Äô. CRILE Working paper, Egerton University, Kenya.UNESCO. \\"The Education of Girls: The Ouagadougou Declaration and Framework for Action\\" Pan Africa Conference on the Education for Girls. http://www.unesco.org/education/information/nfsunesco/pdf/OUAGAD_E.PDF It was also noted that gender disparity existed in education and that there was need to identify and eliminate all policies that hindered girls‚Äô full participation in education.Obasi, E. (1997) 'Structural adjustment and gender access to education in Nigeria'. Gender and Education, 19 161-177. Gender disparity in schools The Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013. From 1970 to 1994, the enrollment of girls in primary education steadily increased from 30% to as high as 80%. However, differences exist between enrollment of males and females in all levels of education. In addition, the drop out rate of girls is higher than boys and participation in STEM classes are lower for girls than boys.Ogunjuyigbe, P.O., Ojofeitimi, E.O. & Akinlo, A. J Sci Educ Technol (2006) 15: 277. Science Education in Nigeria: An Examination of People‚Äôs Perceptions about Female Participation in Science, Mathematics and Technology. doi:10.1007/s10956-006-9014-6 In 2002, the combined gross enrollment for primary, secondary and tertiary schools for female was 57% compared to 71% for males.Ojo, A. (2002). \\"Socio-Economic Situation\\", in Africa Atlases (Nigeria), Paris-France, Les Editions J.A., Pp. 126-127. This translates into fewer women in certain economic fields. The percentages of female workers in some selected professions in 2012 were as follow: architects, 2.4%, quantity surveyors, 3.5%, lawyers/jurists, 25.4%, lecturers, 11.8%, obstetricians and gynecologists, 8.4%, pediatricians, 33.3%, media practitioners, 18.3%.Abikwi, M. and Onyemah, L. (nd). Educational Inequalities and Economic Development of Women in South-South Nigeria. World Educators Forum. Retrieved from:http://www.globalacademicgroup.com/journals/world%20educators%20forum/EDUCATIONAL%20INEQUALITIES.pdf Issues of gender equality in education have been the subject of much debate during the past decades and have become a prominent topic of debate in all countries. In Nigeria, there are large disparities between the education that boys and girls receive. Many girls do not have access to adequate education past a certain age. In 2010, the female adult literacy rate (ages 15 and above) for Nigeria was 59.4% in comparison to the male adult literacy rate of 74.4%. It is differences in education that have led to this gap in literacy.World Bank report. 2010 The gender gap in literacy rates in 2000 at the rural level between boys and girls was 18.3 percent in favour of the boys overall. In the age group 6‚Äì9 years (primary school ages) it was 3.9 percent in favour of boys.CBN (2000). Annual Report and Statement of Accounts 31 December 2000. This indicates that there is a gender dimension to educational attainment and development in Nigeria. According to the Examination Council of Nigeria (1994) there are still other problems, such as high drop-out rates of females students, poor performance, reluctance on the part of females students to enroll in science-based courses and poor classroom participationExamination Council of Kenya. (1994) Government printers. Across various geo-political delineations in Nigeria, a greater percentage of school-age girls are needlessly out-of-school, compared with the ratio applicable to boys of same age grouping.Adeniran, Adebusuyi Isaac.(2007) \\"Educational Inequalities and Women's Disempowerment in Nigeria\\" Department of Sociology, University of Lagos, Nigeria Gender disparity is also visible in the education of children with disabilities, a study in the 1990s revealed that only 37% of disabled females are literate compared to 57% for males. A reason for this situation is the cultural notion that the male will carry the family name while the female will marry. Also, the option of street begging by young disabled girls in order to earn income can inhibit their attendance of classes. The completion of the second Millennium Development Goal‚Äôs (MDG) target i.e. ‚Äòeducation for all‚Äô by 2015 is at risk after having missed the initial deadline of 2005. In Nigeria, educational facilities are generally believed to be inadequate and access is limited for many, especially girls and women.Uku, P. (1992). \\"Women and Political Parties\\" in Chizea and Njoku (eds.) Nigerian Women and the Challenges of Our Time, Lagos, Malthouse Press Ltd. According to the United Nations Human Development Report (2005), Nigeria was classified as a low development country in respect of equality in educational accessibility.UNDP (2005). Human Development Report, New York, University Press. Reasons behind the disparity A Nigerian classroom There are various cultural and socioeconomic issues in Nigeria that prevent women from having adequate access to education. Among other factors that influence girls‚Äô disparity in education, parents/Guardians account for 90 per cent , religious leaders 69 per cent, traditional leaders 54 per cent and community-based organisations 51 per cent. =Culture, values and tradition= Various cultural and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view is that it is better for the woman to stay home and learn to tend to her family instead of attending school.Denga, D.I. (1993). Education at a glance: From cradle to tomb. Calabar: Rapid Educational Publishers Ltd. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place is believed to be the kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls‚Äô participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination.Uwakwe Charles, Ajibola Falaye, Benedict Emunemu and Omobola Adelore (2008). \\"Impact of decentralization and Privatization on the Quality of Education in Sub-Saharan Africa: The Nigerian Experience.\\" European Journal of Social Sciences, Volume 7, Number 1. University of Ibadan, Nigeria. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl. The Nigerian society (both historical and contemporary) has been dotted with peculiar cultural practices that are potently hurtful to women's emancipation, such as early/forced marriage, wife-inheritance and widowhood practices.Nmadu, T. (2000). \\"On Our Feet: Women in Grassroot Development\\", in Journal of Women in Academics, Vol. 1 No 1, Sept. 2000, JOWACS Pp. 165-171. As daughters self-identify as females with their mother and sisters, and sons as males with their father and brothers, gender stereotyping becomes institutionalized within the family unit.Haraway, D. (1991). Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, New York,Routledge. Also, the dominant narratives of religion in both colonial and post-colonial Nigerian society privileges men at the detriment of women, even in educational accessibility. =Cost of education= The decline in economic activities since the early 1980s has made education a luxury to many Nigerians, especially those in rural areas. Because Nigerian parents are known to invest in children according to sex, birth order or natural endowments, girls and boys are not exact substitutes. Often the family can only afford to send one child to school. Because daughters have assumed responsibilities in the home, she is less likely to be the one to attend school. =Colonial policies= At the beginning of colonialism and Christianity, rigid ideals about gender perceptions were imposed on the African mind.Hammond, D. and Jablow, A. (1992). The Africa that Never was, Prospect Heights. Woveland Press. Thereafter, the woman's role has come to be limited to sexual and commercial labour; satisfying the sexual needs of men, working in the fields, carrying loads, tending babies and preparing food. The disempowering colonial ‚Äòideology of domesticity‚Äô as espoused by the practice of ‚Äòhousewification‚Äô provided the springboard for women's educational imbalance in parts of Africa.Gaidzwanwa, R. (1992). \\"Bourgeois Theories of Gender and Feminism and their Shortcomings with Reference to Southern African Countries\\", in Meena, R. (ed.) Gender in Southern Africa: Conceptual and Theoretical Issues, Harare, Sape Books. As such, the overall human development in Nigeria is being hindered by this unevenness in educational accessibility across gender categories.Abdullahi, G.L. (2000). \\"The Crisis of Democratization: Women‚Äôs Vision of the Way Forward\\", in Journal of Women in Academics, Vol. 1 No. 1, Sept 2000, Pp. 183-189. Significance While most of the Millennium Development Goals face a deadline of 2015, the gender parity target was set to be achieved a full ten years earlier - an acknowledgement that equal access to education is the foundation for all other development goals. In countries where resources and school facilities are lacking, and total enrollments are low, a choice must often be made in families between sending a girl or a boy to school. Until equal numbers of girls and boys are in school, it will be impossible to build the knowledge necessary to eradicate poverty and hunger, combat disease and ensure environmental sustainability. Millions of children and women will continue to die needlessly, thus placing the rest of the development agenda at risk. It is extremely important that girls have access to an education. For every additional year girls go to school, they receive 20 percent higher wages and suffer 10 percent fewer child deaths.UNESCO. (2008) ‚ÄúEducation for All by 2015: Will we make it?‚Äù Global Monitoring Report. New York,NY UNESCO/SS/1. UNESDOC database: http://www.ungei.org/resources/files/154743e.pdf Women with some formal education are more likely to seek medical care, ensure their children are immunized, be better informed about their children's nutritional requirements, and adopt improved sanitation practices. As a result, their infants and children have higher survival rates and tend to be healthier and better nourished. According to The International Center for Research on Women, the education that a girl receives is the strongest predictor of the age she will marry and is a critical factor in reducing the prevalence of child marriage.Jain, Saranga and Kathleen Kurz (2006). ICRW research on prevalence and predictors of child marriage in developing countries. The World Bank estimates that an additional year of schooling for 1,000 women helps prevent two maternal deaths.UNICEF - State of the Worlds Children (2004) www.unicef.org/sowc04/files/Chapter2.pdf Also, each additional year of formal education that a mother completes translates to her children staying in school an additional one-third to one-half of a year. Many policy analysts consider literacy rates as a crucial measure to enhance a region's human capital. This claim is made on the grounds that literate people can be trained less expensively than illiterate people, generally have a higher socio-economic status and enjoy better health and employment prospects. If women are these illiterate people, that makes them even more disposable to their economy. Policy makers also argue that literacy for women increases job opportunities and access to higher education.UNESCO (2004) \\"the Plurality of Literacy and its Implications for Policies and Programs\\" UNESCO Education Sector Position Paper. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001362/136246e.pdf Although it is often viewed that a woman working in the home benefits her family, it puts a strain on the whole community as education is one of the keys to success and being able to prosper. According to Ojo, women in Nigeria are harder-hit than men by poverty due to the lack of emphasis placed on female education, and the prevalence of early marriage which tend to further impoverish women, and subject them to statutory discrimination. The most important ingredient of employment opportunity is education, especially higher education. If employment opportunities are different, standards of living, life expectancies and other parameters of existence and of well-being, will be different. \\"For Nigeria to achieve the goal of being among the largest 20 economies in the world, she must rapidly educate the children, most of all, the girls. Educating girls is known to be the basis for sound economic and social development. Educating girls produces mothers who are educated and who will in turn educate their children, care for their families and provide their children with adequate nutrition,\\" says Dr. Robert Limlim, UNICEF's Deputy Representative. \\"Therefore educating girls translates to better health for the children, reduction in child morbidity and mortality, thus triggering off a snowball effect of achieving all the other MDGs in a sustainable manner.\\"UNICEF Press Release 2008. www.ungei.org/news/files/Press_release_- _NGEI_Launch.pdf Current policies of progression Currently Nigerian women are making many advancements within their society. In recent years, three male-dominated professions, the Nigerian Medical Association, the Nigerian Bar Association and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, have been led by female presidents.Anugwom, Edlyne E. (2009) \\"Women, education and work in Nigeria\\" Department of Sociology/Anthropology, University of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria. The subsequent creation of the National Commission for Women and a ministerial portfolio for Women Affairs provide additional avenues for the promotion of women's educational issues and the enhancement of the role of women in national development by way of a statutory body and a Ministry. Today, more children go to school and learn to read and write than in previous decades. As a result, younger persons are much more likely to be literate than older persons. In a survey done by the International Education Statistics measured Nigerian literacy across different 5-year age groups. Among persons aged 15 to 19 years - those who were of primary school age in the 1990s - the literacy rate is 70%. Among persons 80 years or older, only 13% are literate. Additionally, the gap between boys and girls aged 15 to 19 is only 11%.Huebler, Friedrich (2008) \\"Adult Literacy in Nigeria\\" International Education Statistics Nigerian women's access to formal education is still being constrained due to their unfair workload within the household division of labour. Consequently, the realization of the MDG3's ‚Äògender equality and women empowerment‚Äô targets is being impeded harshly.Opaluwah, A.B. (2007). \\"Nigerian Women and Challenge of MDGs\\", Daily Independent, Monday, March 12, 2007, Pp. B5. Moreover, according to Bhavani, such unequal social and gender relations needs to be transformed in order to take women out of want and poverty.Bhavani, K.K., Foran J., and Kurian, P. (2003). Feminist Futures ‚Äì Re- Imaging Women, Culture and Development, London, Zed Press. A 2007 UNESCO and UNICEF report addressed the issue of education from a rights-based approach. Three interrelated rights were specified and must be addressed in concert in order to provide education for all:UNESCO (2007) \\"A Human Rights-Based Approach to Education for All\\" United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization www.unicef.org/publications/files/A_Human_Rights_Based_Approach_to_Education_for_All.pdf * The right of access to education - Education must be available for, accessible to and inclusive of all children weather male or female gender. * The right to quality education - Education needs to be child-centered, relevant and embrace a broad curriculum, and be appropriately resourced and monitored. * The right to respect within the learning environment - Education must be provided in a way that is consistent with human rights, equal respect for culture, religion and language and free from all forms of violence. UNESCO estimates that an estimated $11 billion per year is necessary to reach the 2015 EFA goals. The disparity between need and aid is apparent: aid sent to low-income countries to provide basic education in 2004 and 2005 was at an average of $3.1 billion per year. The Fast Track Initiative (FTI) provides one of the most promising paths to universal primary education by 2015. Set up as a partnership between donors and developing countries and non-governmental organizations, the FTI endorses developing countries that put primary education at the forefront of their domestic efforts and develop sound national education plans. Nigeria is already maximizing these resources for the advancement of the younger generation. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), adopted in 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from discrimination and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized the rights and equality of woman is also the key to the survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, there must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training.\\"CEDAW 29th Session 30 June to 25 July 2003.\\" Welcome to the United Nations: It's Your World. Web. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the health and well-being of families, including information and advice on family planning. =Timeline= Government policies that affect girl-child education since 1985 include: 1986: Blueprint on Women's Education.

FC Basel started the season of with various warm-up matches. These included teams from the Swiss lower league as well as teams from Liechtenstein, France and Germany. The FC Basel aims for the 2004‚Äì05 season were to defend their league title, to win the cup and as well as to qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage. Overview As reigning champions Basel were favourites to retain their title and as Swiss champions, they entered the UEFA Champions League in third qualifying round. Basel's biggest signing in advance of the 2004‚Äì05 season was Kl√©ber from Hannover 96. But in the other direction the Cameroonian international Timoth√©e Atouba and Swiss international Mario Cantaluppi left the club. During the winter break they signed Patrick M√ºller from Mallorca. The Campaign =Domestic League= Basel's priority aim for the season was to win the league championship for the second time in a row. The season started somewhat difficult, of first four home matches only two were won. Nevertheless, Basel moved to the top of the league table and one of the season's highlights was the 8‚Äì1 home win against Grasshoppers in which Gim√©nez scored four goals. During September the team lost two away games in a row, but despite this they led the league table by seven points by the winter break. Basel completed the season's seventeen home ties undefeated, winning thirteen and drawing four. The highest home attendance being 31,383 in the 4‚Äì1 win against their title rivals Thun on 7 May 2005. Just four days later Basel secured the championship in their third last round of the season. At the end of the season they completed their championship aim, winning the title ten points clear of Thun, their nearest rivals. =Domestic Cup= Basel's clear aim for the Swiss Cup was to win it. In the first two rounds of the 2004‚Äì05 Swiss Cup Basel were drawn away games against lower league teams. In the third round they were drawn away against Thun but lost 5‚Äì4 after penalties. Thus Basel missed their aim. =Europe= Because Basel entered the Champions League in the third qualifying round their aim was to reach the group stage. However they were drawn against Internazionale and lost 5‚Äì2 on aggregate and were subsequently dropped into the UEFA Cup. In the First Round of the UEFA Cup Basel defeated the Russian side FC Terek Grozny 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. In the Group Stage they faced considerably tougher opponents, being drawn in Group E with Feyenoord Rotterdam, FC Schalke 04, Ferencv√°rosi TC and Heart of Midlothian. They drew 1‚Äì1 away to Schalke, but were defeated 2‚Äì1 at home by Hearts. In the away tie at the Stadium Pusk√°s Ferenc they beat Ferencv√°ros 2‚Äì1 and finally winning 1‚Äì0 at home against Feyenoord. They finished third in the group on seven points and qualified for the Round of 32 where they were defeated 2‚Äì0 on aggregate by Lille OSC. Despite this defeat, the aim for this campaign could be considered as achieved.

Winter Break/Second Half Season friendlies =Swiss Super League = First half of season The Swiss Super League season was originally contested by ten teams. Second half of season On 4 February 2005 the parent company of Servette FC was declared bankrupt. It had run debts of over 10 million Swiss francs, having not paid the players since the previous November, and consequently the club suffered an exodus of players looking for paying clubs. As a consequence of the bankruptcy Servette FC had their license revoked, the club's second half matches were entirely cancelled. The second half of the season was therefore competed with only nine clubs. These each played another double round-robin schedule. Each of the nine clubs had played 34 matches at the end of the season.

Their goal is to defend the rights of immigrants in their workplaces through a community labor approach and by offering resources and referrals to immigrant workers.  Mission statement  The Immigrant Worker Center is defending the rights of the immigrants in their shoes. The organization‚Äôs main objectives are to improve the working conditions of the immigrants and to offer them referrals regarding issues at work such as harassment, threat, workplace accident, lack of paid vacation and overtime, or maternity leave. The IWC has a community labour approach, as its goal is to educate, not only the immigrant workers but also the population in general on the situation.  History  The IWC was founded in 2000 by a small group of Filipino-Canadian workers. The idea of a center came from the experience of two of the founders: Tess Tesalona and Marco Luciano. Both had previously worked as union organizers and became aware of the lack of resources available to immigrant workers. The goal of the center was therefore to provide a place for workers to talk about their situations and provide a critique of unions A year after its creation, the Immigrant Worker Center received a grant from the social-justice fund of the Canadian Auto Workers and was able to expend the scope of its activity to address broader immigrant workers issues by providing educational tools and critical analysis beyond the concern of the unions.  Current activities  The Immigrant Worker Center offers a broad range of activities to the immigrant workers and their communities. The organization helps union organizing in workplaces with an important proportion of immigrants. The IWC it also provides individual-rights counseling and workshops on issues like the history of labor movement. In addition, it offers a program called ‚ÄúSkills for Change‚Äù, which teaches computer literacy and gives immigrants the opportunity to learn how to create, format, and edit documents, and become skilled in the use of Internet. The program also incorporates information on labour rights in Canada and general social policy education. The Immigrant Workers Center launched, in 2005, a community festival called MayWorks, dedicated to teaching the community about the struggles of the immigrant women through artistic projects. The cultural event took place on Women‚Äôs day and the Center‚Äôs goal is to raise awareness to the condition of immigrant women by repeating the festival every year. Following the Haiti earthquake of 2010, the Immigrant Worker Center joined with UFCW Canada and made a donation of $10,000 to Doctors Without Borders in order to assist in the relief efforts. ‚ÄúAs an organization that works to further migrant rights, we pledge to continue to work in solidarity with the Haitian community of Montreal to support workers‚Äô rights as Haitian workers struggle to aid their family and friends back home\\", declared Jill Hanley from the Immigrant Workers Center regarding the Center‚Äôs donation  Campaigns  The IWC campaigns are usually the result of workers seeking the help of the Center for specific, personal issues. The first campaign of the IWC occurred in 2000 and aimed to defend a domestic worker, Melca Salvador, a ‚Äúdomestic worker admitted to Canada under the Live-in Caregiver Program, against deportation‚Äù. The IWC helped Salvador win her case and brought the issue of importing immigrant labourers to the public sphere. The second campaign conducted by the Immigrant Workers Center concerned the Labour Standards Act. Since most immigrant workers are not unionized, the Act represents their rights and is one of the only resources available to them. In 2002, the IWC and several other social justice groups started a campaign in order to reform the Act and succeed in including the coverage of domestic workers. Although the campaign was considered an important victory, the Labour Standard Act still has many flaws that the Immigrant Workers Center has not been able to change. The Immigrant Workers Center initiated many actions related to the North-to-South relocation of production trend that occurred in Montreal since 2003; this tendency resulted in several job losses without proper compensation, especially affecting immigrant employees. The first accomplishment of the Center was to convince the Montreal Jazz Festival to stop selling T-shirts manufactured by Gildan because of their factory closures in Montreal and poor labour practices in locally and in Honduras. The festival consequently adopted an \\"ethical buying\\" policy. L‚ÄôAmour Inc. also followed that pattern of transfers and started to close its operations in the city around 2006 and relocated its factories in South America. Over 600 jobs were lost in the process and former employees, most of whom were immigrants, did not get any compensation. In 2007, a group of workers, unexpectedly laid off by L‚ÄôAmour Inc., went to the Immigrant Workers Center seeking for help. The campaign eventually expanded to include 70 workers protesting their situation and seeking compensation for years of service. In 2008, the Immigrant Worker Center allied with the Unit Here organization to help laid off workers of manufacturing company Golden Brand get a compensation. The company eventually agreed to give $3,5 million to its 540 previous employees but, while this was an historic victory in the clothing industry, most of them still face unemployment On June 12, 2009, the IWC and former textile workers organized a rally at the National Assembly in Qu√©bec to meet with Minister of Employment Sam Hamad and asked for better regulations and retraining programs. Although Hamad promised to remedy the situation and find employment for the laid off immigrant workers, no solutions were actually put in place. Here the point is that non- immigrant visa only for those who want to work in USA after migrating from their native countries. The people who are warmly welcomed are doctors, engineers, computer professionals, nurses because the United States can use their skills for its own betterment.For non- immigrant visa  Research and publication  The Immigrant Workers Center conducted several researches, mostly based on real cases brought to them, including the Report on Systemic Discrimination: Employment and Poverty in 2000. In 2007, five members of the IWC published Fight Back: Workplace Justice for Immigrants. Drawing on the experience of 50 foreign workers, the book relates the challenges they face when trying to join the workforce in Canada and the exploitation they are victimized by.

It is in the Osceola County School District.  Fine Arts  Though Poinciana High School had very quality band and choral programs in the beginning of the 2000 decade, and produced many fine musicians during this time, including high seated Florida All-State musicians, the music programs are still in a state of rebuilding. Thanks to the former Principal, Belynda Pinkston, there was an effort to revive the fine arts programs to their previous levels. The school finally opened its first performing arts center before the 2009‚Äì10 school year, named after former principal, and now Deputy Superintendent of the Osceola County School District, Debra Pace.  NJROTC  Poinciana High School also has a well respected NJROTC program, which has been highly ranked in the state, as well as in the country, many times over the last decade.  Hurricanes of 2004  In the historic hurricane season for the Central Florida area in 2004, Poinciana High School was hit very hard by Hurricane Charley. Damage to the Gymnasium and Cafeteria was the worst of the damage on campus. After some time of no pep rallies, basketball games, football games, or school dances, the building was able to be completely redone towards the end of the school year.  TV Arrivals  In the 2003‚Äì04 school year, after the death of two students in a drag-racing related incident, as well as the death of a teacher from cancer, students were able to help start a surprise visit by the rapper Ludacris during a pep-rally style event, hosted by MTV. The following school year, after hurricanes Charley, Frances, and Jeanne caused heavy damage to the school, MTV selected the essay written by students of Poinciana High School as the winner of the \\"MTV Made My School Year\\" contest. This included $135,000 in awards, most popular of which was the $25,000 worth of enhancements to the prom that year. Aside from MTV, Poinciana more recently received a surprise visit from architect, television host, and producer Danny Forster of Discovery Channel January 2014.  Egle the Eagle  Egle the Eagle received his name in Poinciana High School's opening school year. During a pep rally, the cheer leader leading the cheer misspelled the word 'Eagles', yelling \\"E - G - L - E - S\\" and this was then used later that year to name the mascot as Egle the Eagle, though the name has been forgotten over the years, and is rarely referenced by any name now.  Racial Controversies  Poinciana High School gained global attention in 2020 after one of its teachers was recorded on Zoom racially accosting a student and asserting her right to be racist against \\"blacks\\". Following the incident, the school maintained her employment and sided with the teacher against \\"the blacks\\".

In 1933, he joined the Dobama Asiayone, an indigenous anti-colonial organization where he earned the honorific \\"Thakin,\\" (lit. \\"master\\"), which was used in protest of British colonialism (since it was customary practice to address the British as \\"Thakin\\"). After passing the matriculation exam in 1934, he went on to the Rangoon Medical College (now UM-1 Yangon). However, he dropped out and pursued journalism instead. Throughout his journalism career, he wrote for the Kyipwayay (\\"Growth\\") magazine, and the Totetyay (\\"Progress\\"), the Journal Kyaw (along with Chit Maung), and the New Light of Burma newspapers. In 1958, soon after Ne Win first declared emergency martial law, he was imprisoned in the Coco Islands for two years, under the Public Order Protection Act, for his leftist political activism. In the mid-1960s, he was detained again in Insein Prison. Ohn Myint is widely considered to have influenced Aung San Suu Kyi, and the two had a close friendship. In 1989, he was arrested for another 5 years and once again in 1998 for allowing himself to be interviewed by researcher Aung Htun, who was writing a book on the history of Burma's student movement. Although he was sentenced to 7 years of hard labor, his sentence was commuted the following year, after the visit of American congressman Tony P. Hall.

Plot summary An English police officer named David Hanlin ‚Äî a puritanical Christian ‚Äî is asked to investigate what appears to be the ritualistic murder of a local child in an enclosed rural Cornish village. During his short stay, Hanlin deals with psychological trickery, sexual seduction, ancient religious practices and nightmarish sacrificial rituals. Writing In 1966, when Pinner was 26, he had just written the vampire comedy Fanghorn, and was playing the lead role of Sergeant Trotter in Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap in the West End of London. He decided to write a film treatment that dealt with the occult (like Fanghorn) but which was also a detective story (like The Mousetrap). Film director Michael Winner liked Pinner's Ritual treatment, and considered making it his next film, with English actor John Hurt in mind for the lead role. However, Winner deemed the treatment to be \\"too full of imagery\\", and Pinner's agent, Jonathan Clowes, felt that Winner might sit on the project for a long time. The collaboration came to a halt. Clowes suggested that Pinner instead expand Ritual into a novel, promising that he would get it published. Pinner wrote it in seven weeks, while he was still acting in The Mousetrap. He would write sections of the novel on the tube train on his way into the West End, and even on his dressing room floor. While driving to his agent's office with the only completed copy of Ritual in existence, Pinner accidentally left the manuscript on the roof of the car; it would most likely have fallen off and been lost forever if another driver had not alerted Pinner to his mistake. Reception Bob Stanley of The Guardian wrote that \\"Ritual's opulent dialogue, with the sickly richness of its countryside, and Pinner's decaying village, can stand alone from the book's illustrious successor. But, be warned, like The Wicker Man, it is quite likely to test your dreams of leaving the city for a shady nook by a babbling brook.\\" Adaptations =Films= In 1973, Ritual was used as the basis for The Wicker Man, a British horror film directed by Robin Hardy and written for the screen by Anthony Shaffer. Edward Woodward stars as the policeman, renamed Sergeant Neil Howie. Pinner discussed the book in a 2011 interview. \\"I then sold the film rights of the book to Christopher Lee in 1971 ‚Äì the basic idea and the structure of it was used for The Wicker Man.\\" Pinner has said that he likes the film, but feels that it lacks the humour of the novel. As a result of the film's popularity, Ritual became a much sought- after collector's item, and was being sold for ¬£400 to ¬£500 on eBay. It was not until the 2011 reprint that the novel became widely available. In 2006, an American version of The Wicker Man was released. It was written and directed by Neil LaBute, and stars Nicolas Cage as the policeman, renamed Edward Malus in this version. The remake credits Ritual as the original basis for Shaffer's screenplay on which it was based. =Play= The metafictional stage production by the National Theatre of Scotland, Appointment with the Wicker Man, incorporates aspects of both Shaffer's screenplay and Pinner's novel, weaving them into a single narrative. Sequel Pinner wrote The Wicca Woman as a sequel to Ritual; the book was published by Endeavour Press in 2014.

The AFIP, the revenue service of Argentina, requested Ciccone's bankruptcy in July 2010; but the AFIP reversed itself on September 24, 2010, and rescinded the bankruptcy request. A shell corporation named \\"The Old Fund\\", represented by Alejandro Vandenbroele, gave 2.3 million pesos to Ciccone; Vandenbroele became president of the organization as a result. Boudou, who was Minister of Economy at the time, instructed the AFIP to give Ciccone an exceptional moratorium to refinance debts. Boudou denied having any relationship with Vandenbroele, or even knowing about him, but it was confirmed later that Vandenbroele paid the rent and the cable television bill for an apartment belonging to Boudou. Development The case began to be investigated when Laura Mu√±oz, Vandenbroele's ex-wife, accused him of being a mere straw owner of Ciccone and claimed that the real owner was Amado Boudou. She requested protection, fearing attacks from her former husband. However, her testimony had no judicial value, because of her spousal relation with Vandenbroele and her limited knowledge of his ongoing activities. Boudou denied having any relation with Vandenbroele or even knowing about him and said he believed the whole controversy to be staged by the newsdaily Clar√≠n to harm the government. It has been alleged, however, that his connection to Ciccone was made through C√©sar Guido Forcieri, who formerly worked under Boudou. In addition, he accused Interior Minister Florencio Randazzo and a competing printing house, Boldt, of leaking the information about his relationship with Ciccone. Randazzo denied any relation with Boldt. The relationship between Boudou and Vandenbroele was confirmed in April 2012, when the judicial investigation checked an apartment belonging to Boudou and discovered that Vandenbroele had paid the rent and the television cable service. It is suspected that Vandenbroele may have been living there during that time, and not Fabi√°n Carosso Donatiello, as had been thought. Donatiello was a friend of Vandenbroele, had moved to Spain many years before, had no ongoing economic activity in Argentina, and his most recent registered entry to the country had been in July 2011. Boudou accused Judge Daniel Rafecas of being part of a \\"mafia\\" with the Clar√≠n media group, something denied by Rafecas. Following an August 2013 judicial ruling ordering prosecutors to provide evidence of wrongdoing, and their subsequent failure to do so, on September 11 a Federal Court granted a motion by Boudou's attorneys that would allow them to file for a dismissal of charges. Despite the political scandal, the Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) commissioned Ciccone in March 2012 to print currency notes on its behalf. Ciccone will print 120 million new Argentine peso banknotes. The proposal was initially resisted in the BCRA as Ciccone's financial instability would not allow it to meet the standards required to work with the state: the company had not made all of its required tax payments, and it had faced a bankruptcy a short time before. Central Bank President Mercedes Marc√≥ del Pont blocked the formal writing of any complaints, however, and the deal was approved. The first banknotes from Ciccone were printed on May 2012. Political repercussions The opposition attempted to impeach Boudou but failed to do so, as both chambers of the Congress have a Kirchnerist majority and Boudou is a Kirchnerist. The constitution requires two-thirds of the Chamber of Deputies to vote for initiating an impeachment process of the vice president,Constitution of Argentina , art. 53 as well as two-thirds of the Senate to convict him as guilty.Constitution of Argentina , art. 59 Opposition politicians Margarita Stolbizer and Eduardo Amadeo believed that Boudou should resign or explain what had happened. As President Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner will not be able to run for a third term in 2015, Boudou had considered running for office even though Kirchner won the 2011 presidential election. As of April 2012, his public support had decreased by over 11 percentage points since the election, from 43.2% to 31.8%, while his negative image had increased nearly 19 percentage points, from 34.9% to 53.6% and only 15.4% think that he is innocent. Despite this, he has not given up his plan to run.

It has taken several forms, most recently appearing as an app and web app hosting 24 individual hour-long mixes, with custom visuals similar to those used in the 2manydjs live sets. Background The earliest incarnation of Radio Soulwax debuted on www.soulwax.com in around 2001. Initially it featured 10 mp3 playlists, sequenced like DJ sets, although more were added later. More recently the Radio Soulwax project was revived, because they said that they came to a level that they headline festivals, they can always play for a big audience, etc. But they found at a certain moment that it began to be a bit limiting. They had a lot of musical ideas that they couldn't realise on this level, so they searched a solution. In 2009, Jan van Biesen, the head of the radio station Studio Brussel, said to the brothers \\"Why don't you make your own radio?\\". Now they claim that was the initial beginning of Radio Soulwax. Then they started scanning and encoding their whole vinyl collection: more or less 50,000 records. This job took them two and a half years. in an inverview with the Belgian radio station Studio Brussel The intro to Radio Soulwax, \\"Machine\\" was conceived and directed by Saam Farahmand, who was inspired to create an interpretation of the ethos behind the project. The result is a film that encapsulates the audio visual obsession of Radio Soulwax. The film was previsualised, edited and post produced by Andrew Daffy's The House of Curves in London.

The police and press described this as a riot. The exact reason for the lethal shot being fired is unclear: police sources said that it was an accident and took place during a riot that started when vendors were checked for documents and thus Itoya was being arrested; according to witness' accounts the riot only started after the police opened fire. Aftermath The next day, a demonstration of 50 immigrants and activists marched protesting against the police's actions, chanting slogans such as: \\"The police have blood on their hands\\" and \\"Stop racism and police brutality\\". The police officer who shot Itoya was not suspended from duty or charged with any crime.

Originally commissioned during World War II, the squadron fought at the Guadalcanal, New Georgia, the Battle of Bougainville, Battle of Okinawa, and the Battle of Balikpapan. History Marine Scout Bombing Squadron 143 (VMSB-143) was commissioned on September 7, 1942 at Naval Air Station San Diego, California. The squadron departed San Diego on December 28, 1942 arriving at Efate on January 16, 1943. The squadron's flight echelon arrived at Guadalcanal on February 15, 1943. During this time they took part in mine laying operations of Kahili Harbor on Bougainville on March 21, 1943 and supported ground troops during the New Georgia campaign. On May 19, 1943 planes from VMSB-143 and the Navy's Torpedo Squadron 11 (VT-11) strafed and bombed the Japanese cargo ship H≈çun Maru causing it to run aground in Buin Harbor. The squadron was re- designated as Marine Torpedo Bombing Squadron 143 (VMTB-143) on May 31, 1943. On October 1, 1943 the flight echelon of the squadron was divided into three parts in order to support the Bougainville Campaign. These echelons were based at Guadalcanal, Espiritu Santo, and Munda Airfield. In January 1944 the squadron moved to Bougainville and from there participated in airstrikes against the Japanese garrison at Rabaul. Returning to the United States in June 1944, the squadron was based at Marine Corps Air Station Santa Barbara. The squadron was re-designated again as VMTB (CVS)-143 and was assigned to USS Gilbert Islands (CVE-107). The squadron departed MCAS Santa Barbara on April 12, 1945. During this final phase of the war, the squadron provided close air support during the Battle of Okinawa from May to July 1945. After that is also supported the Australian 7th Division during the Battle of Balikpapan in Borneo. Following the war the squadron returned to Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California and was deactivated on March 10, 1946 as part of the post war drawdown of forces. In August 1945, famed comic strip artist Alex Raymond was made an honorary member of the unit while serving alongside them in the Pacific War.

It was first proposed by an American physicist P. W. Anderson and Indian theoretical physicist Ganapathy Baskaran in 1987. The theory states that in copper oxide lattices, electrons from neighboring copper atoms interact to form a valence bond, which locks them in place. However, with doping, these electrons can act as mobile Cooper pairs and are able to superconduct. Anderson observed in his 1987 paper that the origins of superconductivity in doped cuprates was in the Mott insulator nature of crystalline copper oxide. RVB builds on the Hubbard and t-J models used in the study of strongly correlated materials. In 2014, evidence showing that fractional particles can happen in quasi two-dimensional magnetic materials, was found by EPFL scientists lending support for Anderson's theory of high- temperature superconductivity. Description The RVB state with valence bond coupling of nearest-neighbor electrons. The physics of Mott insulators is described by the repulsive Hubbard model Hamiltonian: :H=-t\\\\sum_{\\\\langle ij\\\\rangle}c^{\\\\dagger}_{i\\\\sigma}c_{j\\\\sigma}+\\\\text{h.c.}+U\\\\sum_in_{i\\\\uparrow}n_{i\\\\downarrow} In 1971, Anderson first suggested that this Hamiltonian can have a non- degenerate ground state that is composed of disordered spin states. Shortly after the high-temperature superconductors were discovered, Anderson and Kivelson et al. proposed a resonating valence bond ground state for these materials, written as :\\\\text{RVB}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_CC\\\\rangle where C represented a covering of a lattice by nearest neighbor dimers. Each such covering is weighted equally. In a mean field approximation, the RVB state can be written in terms of a Gutzwiller projection, and displays a superconducting phase transition per the Kosterlitz-Thouless mechanism. However, a rigorous proof for the existence of a superconducting ground state in either the Hubbard or the t-J Hamiltonian is not yet known. Further the stability of the RVB ground state has not yet been confirmed.

As a component of the Psychotechnic League future history / alternate history, \\"Brake\\" takes place in 2270, as the civilization built up in the aftermath of the 1958 Third World War is being torn between mutually antagonistic factions, on the verge of collapsing into \\"the day of genocide and the night of ignorance and tyranny\\". The story was written and published within two months of \\"Marius\\" and they were clearly written as companion pieces - the dawn and sunset of the same culture (later stories of this Future History would be set in the further future, when a still newer civilization would arise from the ruins of what would be called \\"The Second Dark Ages\\"). Marius and Brake are linked by various common themes - one featuring the first appearance of the maquis Stefan Rostomily, the other having the last appearance of Rostomily's cloned \\"sons\\"; in one √âtienne Fourre appears for the first time, in his heroic effort to restore the shattered world, in the other the memory of Fourre is abused and his legacy is claimed by one of the militant factions busily working to shatter it again. In fact, it is Captain Banning, the story' protagonist, who is Fourre's true heir, bravely striving to preserve, for as long as possible, what Fourre and his companions had built. Social and political background The entire plot is set on board a spaceship bound for the moons of Jupiter, but it is directly related to the deep crisis and malaise of Earth's social and political system, a \\"civilization about to go under\\". While science and technology eliminated poverty and provided material plenty to all, they failed to resolve humanity's deeper needs. With machines doing much of the work, most people are unemployed - and while materially provided for, feel frustrated and alienated, an issue featured prominently in \\"Quixote and the Windmill\\" and \\"What Shall it Profit?\\". This led to the rising of the anti-technological ideology known as \\"Humanism\\", whose followers seized dictatorial power in 2170. Though eventually defeated (\\"Cold Victory\\") and the democratic government of the Solar Union restored, the underlying problem was not resolved but in fact grew worse. Earth's soul had been scarred by the Humanist episode, and a century later, there is a \\"civilization-splitting tension, wrung daily one notch higher\\". Being for or against Science and Technology is the hottest of politically controversial issues, with the struggle between numerous mutually antagonistic political and religious factions carried out not only via psychodynamics, telecampaigning and parliamentary maneuver but also by \\"knives in the night\\". The schism is often perceived in simplistic geographic and cultural terms of \\"Oriental Kali worshipers versus a puritanical protechnological Occident\\". However, as the story's protagonist points out, the adherents of Kali the Destroyer, a mutated form of Hindu mythology, are only one branch of the Ramakrishian Eclectics; there are many Asians who support birth control and Technic civilization, while some American professors are fanatical Kali worshippers; the Western New Christians oppose science while the Eastern Husseinite Muslims support it; and so on. Of major importance to the story are the influential and well-funded Western Reformers - in fact no reformers but utterly ruthless fanatics, who would stop at nothing in their efforts to \\"end the government's spineless toleration of the Kali menace in the East and the moral decay in the West\\". The Psychotechnic Institute, which in earlier centuries subtly \\"guided\\" and manipulated the government and sought to prevent such polarization, had become corrupt and discredited and was not restored after the fall of the Humanists. Its last members degenerated into themselves becoming a fanatic exile faction on Ganymede seeking to seize power by breeding a mindless loyal army of genetically modified troops. The Institute's place was partly taken by the Order of Planetary Engineers, a secretive \\"quasi-military, almost religious\\" organization based at a castle on the edge of Archimedes crater on the Moon. With its members known as capitalized \\"Engineers\\" and bound to contract no formal marriage as long as they are on active duty, it has some characteristics reminiscent of the Free Masons and of the Military Orders of Medieval knights. Among the Engineers are also found the last of the Rostomily clones. Though basically concerned with physical nature and the terraforming of worlds, and officially neutral in politics, the Order maintains an Intelligence arm and an unofficial symbiosis with the Solar Union's Guard. The above polarization does not spread beyond Earth, with colonists in space well aware that it was science and technology which created the very environment where they live. It is assumed that, whatever cataclysm would eventually engulf Earth, the space colonies would not be seriously touched by it, assuring humanity's survival. Luna City on the Moon is a cosmopolitan metropolis. The terraforming of Venus - a dream of the oppressed earlier colonists depicted in \\"The Big Rain\\" - had come true and, freed of a dictatorial regime, the Venusians reverted to a clan society reminiscent of the Scottish Highlands (they habitually wear kilts and glengarries). Though sometimes engaging in bloody vendettas, Venusian violence is relatively innocuous compared with that of Earth. Mars is also terraformed, its moon Phobos being an important station on the space routes. The newest of humanity's outposts are the terraformed Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto, and Europa is due to be. The as yet poor and backward Jovian Republic - reminiscent of early Australia - has recently established its University of X, \\"X\\" being the name of the main city and spaceport on Ganymede. Its inhabitants have developed their own dialect of English (\\"Missed y' 'gain. Do' know 'f we c'n come near, nex' time\\"). As noted previously, the catastrophe which would eventually engulf Earth did not seriously touch these space colonies. The point reiterated in this story, as in much of Anderson's other fiction and non-fiction writings - is that space exploration and colonization is not an unnecessary \\"luxury\\" or \\"waste,\\" but instead essential for humanity's very survival. Plot summary \\"The Thunderbolt\\" is a space freighter, built as a steelloy spheroid, 300 meters in diameter. She is a fast ship, not restricted to Hohmann Orbits and capable of reaching the Jovian moons in less than a month. The flip side is that - since her speed is greater than the Solar Escape Velocity - should anything prevent \\"The Thunderbolt\\" from decelerating, she would go on forever into interstellar space, and all on board would die when supplies run out. For that reason, she carries no lifeboats - jumping into a lifeboat which cannot decelerate either would save nobody. Also, for most of her voyage, she is out of radio range and cannot call for help; her crew must deal by themselves with any emergency - natural, mechanical or (as in this story) man-made. Captain Peter Banning is a veteran, highly capable spaceman, with a lot of experience also in hand-to-hand fighting (especially in zero gravity conditions). He has considerable intellectual curiosity and knowledge of such abstruse ancient history subjects as Weimar Germany and the struggle between Nazis and Communists - names which mean nothing to most 23rd Century people. Having observed the fast deteriorating situation on Earth, he tries to avoid being there and has bought a ranch on Venus to serve as his refuge; however, Earth's crisis would soon reach into his own ship. On what seems a routine voyage, \\"The Thunderbolt\\" sets out with a cargo of terraforming equipment for Europa. Banning strikes up a friendship with Planetary Engineer Luke Devon, with whom he shares an enthusiasm for Shakespeare. Nothing much happens on board, except for a budding love relationship between Devon and Cleonie Rogers - one of the few people in this period with the money and leisure to engage in space tourism, and one of the few women to keep up an alluring female appearance at a time when the typical Western woman is a \\"crop-headed, tight-lipped, sad-clad creature\\". Banning has some vague suspicion about the ship's four other passengers, but nothing concrete - and they all have plausible reasons for traveling to Ganymede. In fact, the four are members of the fanatic \\"Western Reformers\\" and plan to take over the ship. This is part of a much wider plot: the \\"Reformers\\" have started a secret asteroid base, which they plan to expand and use to build a fleet of nuclear-armed ships. Ultimately, they intend to launch a surprise attack on Earth, destroying India and other centers of the Kali cult, killing hundreds of millions, and take over power on the rest of the planet. To build up the base, they need a big, fast space freighter - and the Thunderbolt's cargo of terraforming equipment will also be useful to them. Devon - a late clone of the Rostomily Brotherhood, whose struggle to help unite the Earth two centuries earlier was described in \\"Un-Man\\" - recognizes Serge Andreyev, one of these four passengers, as a former Engineer who had been expelled from the Order \\"for good reasons,\\" and confronts him - whereupon Andreyev pulls a gun. Captain Banning comes upon the tableau and manages to get Devon free. This precipitates the conspirators into acting quicker than they planned, taking over strategic positions in the ship, killing two crew members out of hand, and imprisoning several others. However, Captain Banning remains at large and manages to free and rally his crew. They are hampered by the \\"Reformers\\" having all the firearms - since none are normally carried aboard space freighters. This, however, is compensated for by turning off the ship's artificial gravity - free fall giving the spacemen a considerable advantage over \\"landlubbers\\" - and by the Captain's considerable skill with throwing knives. Captain and crew, together with Luke and Cleonie, engage in a series of grim battles and manage to kill three of the four would-be hijackers, though Luke is severely wounded. However, Professor Gomez - leader of the Reformers' group - holes up in the ship's engine room, where it would take the Captain and his crew hours to cut through the thick metal partitions. He demands that everyone surrender to him and take the ship to the conspirators' asteroid. Otherwise, he will flush the ship's reaction mass into space, dooming everybody to die in interstellar space; with \\"a face of embodied Purpose, known through millennial of slaughterhouse history\\" he declares his determination to die, too, if they reject his terms. From the revived Devon's knowledge of the \\"Reformers\\", the Captain concludes that he and his crew would be killed out of hand at the conspirators' asteroid, and that therefore they have nothing to lose. They cut through the partitions, get into the engine room and kill Gomez - who has already flushed a large part of the reaction mass into space. Having done what they could to avert Earth's doom, Captain Banning and his people must find a way to save themselves. The remaining reaction mass is too little to stop the ship from leaving the Solar System. It is, however, enough to send it on a course through the atmosphere of giant Jupiter, where friction will slow them down - a risky maneuver never tried before. They lighten the ship by cutting up all internal partitions and throwing them out of the cargo hold; as well as all but the most essential gear. After the last of the reaction mass is used, the ship's engine is also cut off and jettisoned. The resulting course takes the ship into the Jovian atmosphere, where friction reduces its speed considerably. It emerges into space and than again plunges into the atmosphere, and so slows again and again. On one brief re-emergence into space, the obsolete ships of the Jovian Republic make a valiant effort to intercept and take them off - but in vain. Finally, \\"The Thunderbolt\\" comes to rest in the upper Jovian atmosphere - \\"a hollow steelloy shell, three hundred odd meters in diameter, could carry more than a hundred thousand tons besides its own mass, and still have a net specific gravity of less than 0.03\\". So the ship floats in the Jovian atmosphere \\"like a free balloon over Eighteenth Century France\\". The people in her have enough supplies and stored energy to last them until rescued by a big ship; one capable of entering the Jovian atmosphere and taking them away from Jupiter. The group is hopeful that their rescuers will arrive from Earth. Themes The story introduces the theme of protagonists aware that their culture is nearing an inevitable collapse and a \\"Long Night\\" and who nevertheless strive, with great courage and sacrifice, to \\"halt the Norns\\" - even if for only one more generation. The same basic premise would be the basis of Anderson's later Dominic Flandry series. The next story in the series, Gypsy, takes place several hundred years later, when a new civilization had arisen out of the ashes of the Second Dark Ages and is already in possession of FTL ships. There is thus no information on how much time the heroic struggle of Captain Banning and his crew bought for the embattled Earth, how the final catastrophic collapse happened, or whose action touched it off - the Western Reformers, their Kali foes, some other factions or all of them together. Also Sandra Miesel, who closed up many gaps in this future history, did not concern herself with this one. The underlying assumption is that the civilization was moribund, and it is of secondary importance to point out exactly who struck the final blow. Influence on Donald Moffitt Donald Moffitt, in the preface to his 2003 novel Jovian, noted the difficulties which Jupiter's gravity and atmospheric pressure make for Science Fiction writers trying to realistically place humans in that environment. He remarked that Anderson's Brake was \\"an ingenious story of a spaceship paying a brief visit to Jupiter, bobbing like a cork in Jupiter's upper atmosphere until it could be rescued\\". Moffitt's own novel featured a human colony permanently \\"bobbing like a cork in Jupiter's upper atmosphere\\"; Moffitt provided plausible economic reasons why establishing and maintaining such a colony could be worthwhile for a future space-faring civilization.

The case was showcased by America's Most Wanted in 2009 in hopes of generating leads for the unsolved case. Jones was identified in October 2012. Her mother was dead; her aunt, her aunt's boyfriend, and an uncle were charged with concealing evidence of the child's death, believed to have been the result of abuse by her mother. Discovery On March 18, 2005, a man hunting in Upper Freehold Township, New Jersey discovered a small human skull, later estimated to have belonged to a five to nine-year-old girl, in the wooded undergrowth. New Jersey State Police Crime Scene Investigators then cordoned off the area. A black Nike shoe found with the remains had evidence of burning, which led authorities to presume the body was burned to prevent it from being found or identified. The shoe was later found to have been a brand that was developed in 2000 and was then released to consumers the following year. Additionally, a zipper and fragments of cloth material, possibly what the body was wrapped in, and a cloth bag with a Sylvester the Cat graphic was found. The zipper had markings that read \\"333\\" and investigators were unsure if it was tied to the scene or if it had been at the location already, like the sheets may have been. The fire that had been set to destroy the evidence had damaged the child's bones and teeth, as well as surrounding plant life. No cause of death could be determined through study of the remains, despite the suspicious circumstances involved. The exact race of the child could not be estimated, although the skull appeared to belong to someone of admixed race, likely with African-American ancestry. Although the cause of death was undetermined, the child had healing breaks in some of her ribs. Despite that her exact cause of death was not possible to estimate, the case was considered a homicide by investigators. More bones were eventually found at the scene, allowing an estimation of the victim's height and weight, which was determined to be between three feet and four feet two inches and twenty-five to seventy- five pounds. The date of death was estimated to be between the years of 2001 and 2004. Analysis of the child's teeth suggested she had lived in a populous region, such as a city, as fluoride was present. Apart from this, no other clues, such as evidence of dental care, were found. Investigation Police believed that those who were responsible for disposing of the body may have traveled to the location on interstate 195. They presumed that the suspect or suspects did not \\"know the area very well,\\" as a nearby swamp would have been an easier place to conceal human remains and destroy evidence. An additional clue that the perpetrators were not \\"local\\" included the fact that the body did not appear to have been buried, as there seemed to be little concern that anyone that knew the child would find the remains or that a local individual would likely have the means to bury a body, as the area was inhabited by those in a farming community. Because of the fire that was set at the scene, a DNA profile of the girl could not be developed. However, it was possible to extract mitochondrial DNA from some of the bones. After the process of recovering mitochondrial DNA was complete at the University of North Texas, it was placed on file to compare to potential matches. The face of the child was reconstructed to provide a likeness of the victim's appearance in life, in hopes that someone that may have known the victim could recognize her. Artist Frank Bender created a clay sculpture, a composite sketch was created in 2007 and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children eventually created a digital rendering by using a CAT scanned copy of the skull. Efforts to identify the remains were unsuccessful, as no potential matches were discovered. No missing children from the area and surrounding counties appeared to have matched the victim. Because of this, authorities presumed that the victim's family may have been involved in her death. Authorities urged the public to submit any possible leads of someone knowing of a child that seemed to have \\"disappeared over night\\" at some point leading up to the discovery of the remains. In 2009, the case was broadcast on the television show America's Most Wanted, which also showed reconstructions of the child. Approximately one-hundred tips were submitted, yet none reportedly led to meaningful leads. Identification and convictions Jon-Niece's sister, Iyonna, speculated that the remains might be those of Jon-Niece in August 2012. Iyonna Jones told authorities that after her death, the victim was placed in trash bags and then transported somewhere by her mother and other subjects. In October 2012, a DNA sample taken from Iyonna and compared with the remains confirmed that the two were related. An investigation revealed that Jon-Niece had died in the home of her aunt, Likisha Jones, on August 15, 2002, as a result of physical abuse and neglect at the hands of her mother, Elisha Jones. It was alleged that the victim's mother Elisha, her uncle James Jones, and her aunt's boyfriend, Godfrey Gibson, first set the body on fire and then disposed of it where it was later found after three years. No missing person report was ever filed after Jones' death. Although Elisha Jones had died in December 2002, Likisha Jones, James Jones, and Godfrey Gibson were charged in October 2012 with evidence tampering, obstruction of justice and hindering apprehension. Likisha Jones and Godfrey Gibson were apprehended at their apartment and James Jones eventually surrendered by turning himself in to authorities. The three were indicted on January 7, 2013, and released on bail. At the time of her arrest, Likisha Jones was raising 13 children alongside her boyfriend; none was ever aware of Jon-Niece's existence. The trials were held in Freehold, New Jersey. The three suspects initially pleaded not guilty. In late 2013, they eventually pleaded guilty to the charges. Law enforcement stated that Jones' deceased mother was presumed to be the sole person responsible for the girl's death and believed that the other suspects were not involved in the killing. On March 1, 2014, Likisha and James Jones were sentenced to two years' probation. Godfrey Gibson was sentenced to one year, minus one day, in prison.

In a less fluent writer, these descriptions would slow the story down but this is not the case ... The book remains fast-moving while giving the reader the satisfaction of having read a novel of substance and at the same time enjoying trying to second guess the mystery murder element. I recommend it.\\" Doug Davidson RIVER CITY PRESS 14 July 2016. The Hour of the Grey Wolf is a crime story ... in many ways, it defies the genre. It is literary fiction as well, experimental in form, so experimental that, simply linked together with logic, the parts should not work together to form that coherent whole. And yet they do. ... a compelling page-turner, a classic whodunit. ... I kept turning the pages and am certain other readers will too.

For those of us familiar with Wellington during the 1950s‚Äô ‚ÄúOvercast Sunday‚Äù will evoke a few memories of a time and lifestyle that no longer exists. The title itself belongs to a song, a type of blues music in keeping with the sentiments of love, joy and sorrow and particularly poignant for immigrants far from their homeland.

Chris Moisa has written a fine story, crafted in such a way that may irritate and impatient reader, but rich in knowledge and understanding of the community in which the book is centered, and the forces that bring everything together at that point. The reader learns a lot and becomes intimately engaged with each character, their lives laid bare for us in the book‚Äôs unusual configuration. The author captured the time, the economics, politics and social ambiance of New Zealand in 1950, with the Greek community the focus of his attention. The story is not for me to tell but I really enjoyed it. The book is not laid out in a traditional format, and what I see it has challenged the odd critic. I found it enhanced the yarn Chris tells. This latest book is a valuable addition to the repertoire of a superb writer.

Life Stephen came from a prominent family of royal officials and clerics. His father Richard was a royal judge; his brothers John Lexington and Robert of Lexinton were judges and royal officials, while his brother Henry of Lexington became Bishop of Lincoln. Stephen was a disciple of Saint Edmund of Abingdon (1175-1240); supposedly he was one of seven students brought by an abbot to hear Edmund preach, all of whom \\"renounced the world\\". He became a Cistercian monk at Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight, but not long after was elected abbot of Stanley Abbey in Wiltshire, where he hosted visits from St. Edmund. In 1228 he was appointed visitor in Ireland, where he deposed several abbots, replacing them with English monks, and sending a number of monks to abbeys in France. In 1229, he was elected abbot of Savigny Abbey, a prominent Cistercian house, where he made many improvements. In 1231, he visited Savigny's daughter houses in England and issued new regulations for them.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=39925 A History of the County of Shropshire, Volume 2, Eds. Gaydon, Pugh; 1973, \\"The Abbey of Buildwas\\" In 1238 he reformed Redon Abbey by order of Pope Gregory IX. On his way to a papal council in 1241 he was saved from capture in a naval battle by the efforts of his brother John, who was on his way to the same council as a representative of King Henry III. On 6 December 1243 he was elected abbot of Clairvaux Abbey, the abbey founded by Bernard in 1115 that was the ultimate parent of most of the Cistercian establishments. Stephen obtained permission from the pope in 1244 to found a Cistercian college in Paris, le Coll√®ge des Bernardins,http://www.collegedesbernardins.fr/fr/le-college/histoire.html and by 1247 had founded the Cistercian College of St. Bernard, with Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, King Louis IX's brother, as patron.The Gentleman's Magazine, June, 1841, \\"The Conventual College of the Bernardins at Paris\\", p. 592-597 John of Mirecourt, Konrad of Megenberg, and Pope Benedict XII were scholars there in the 14th century. In 1250, he had the body of Aletha, mother of St. Bernard, moved to Clairvaux. He was removed from his position as abbot in 1255 in an internal political struggle within the order; Stephen had the support of Pope Alexander IV, but the order was supported by King Louis IX and Stephen retired to the Abbey of Orcamp near Noyon where he died on 21 March, perhaps in 1258.

History In the mid-1990s, the State Law and Order Restoration Council, the ruling junta, forcibly closed down and relocated historic cemeteries lying near the city center of Yangon. One of the biggest was Kyandaw Cemetery (in Kamayut Township), which was relocated to suburbs in 1996 to 1997, and redeveloped as the Yangon Drugs Elimination Museum. Descendants of the interred were given one month's notice to move the remains for reburial. Similarly, that year, the Nine Mile Cemetery (), an ethnic Chinese cemetery was demolished and remains were relocated to Yayway Cemetery. The interred remains from these cemetery relocation projects were reburied at Yayway Cemetery, located on the outskirts of the city.

Born into a military family, MacLauchlan studied surveying whilst a cadet at the Tower of London with the Royal Corps of Military Surveyors and Draftsmen. He left the corps when it disbanded in 1817 and joined the Ordnance Survey a few years later. After leaving the army, MacLauchlan worked with geologist Henry De la Beche on a survey of Cornwall and for the Duke of Northumberland to survey archaeology in the north of England. MacLauchlan died in Clapham in 1882. Early life and career  MacLauchlan was born at the British Army base of Landguard Fort in Felixstowe, Suffolk, to Andrew MacLauchlan, a storekeeper for the Board of Ordnance, and his second wife, Martha Haywood. After his father's death in 1795, MacLauchlan moved in with his mother's family in Chichester, before becoming, around 1804, a cadet with the Royal Corps of Military Surveyors and Draftsmen at the Tower of London. He spent several years with the army as a draughtsman in Cork, Ireland before the corps disbanded in 1817 and he was retired on half pay. MacLauchlan worked with the Ordnance Survey from 1823 to 1824, making surveys in Gloucestershire, South Wales and Bedfordshire.  Geological and archaeological work  As well as surveying, MacLauchlan was interested in geology, being elected a fellow of the Geological Society in 1832 and being known to the geologists William Conybeare and George Bellas Greenough. In 1835 he was seconded to Henry De la Beche to provide geographical expertise for his geological survey of Cornwall. MacLauchlan returned to surveying in 1839, before retiring in November 1844. Upon retirement MacLauchlan moved to Cornwall, where he surveyed hill forts and linear earthworks for the Assessionable Manors Commission. He published his findings in six papers in the annual reports of the Royal Institution of Cornwall between 1847 and 1853. By 1848 he was conducting a survey of the archaeology of the North Riding of Yorkshire on behalf of the Duke of Northumberland, an amateur archaeologist. His work in Yorkshire was completed in 1849 and published in the Archaeological Journal. The Duke then commissioned MacLauchlan to survey parts of Northumberland, including Watling Street and Hadrian's Wall, the results of which were published between 1850 and 1867.  Later life  MacLauchlan was consulted in 1854 by a commission of the British Parliament which was investigating which scales should be used by the Ordnance Survey for mapping and how best to represent hills on maps. MacLauchlan recommended the use of shading to show hills, considering contour lines to be less informative and aesthetically pleasing. MacLauchlan never married and, when not in the field surveying, resided in Lambeth or Clapham in London. He died at 14 Liston Road, Clapham on 27 January 1882. MacLauchlan was little known until the 1950s and 1960s, when scholars of pre-historic and Roman northern England acknowledged the value of his accurate work, especially in his derivation of place names.

Qodiriy was one of the most influential Uzbek writers of the 20th century. He introduced realism into Uzbek literature through his historical novels and influenced many other Central Asian novelists, including the Kazakh writer Mukhtar Auezov. Qodiriy wrote under various pen names, the most renowned being Julqunboy. His early works were influenced by the Jadid movement. Qodiriy was executed during the Great Purge under the leadership of Joseph Stalin.  Life  Abdulla Qodiriy was born on April 10, 1894, in Tashkent, then Russian Turkestan. His father, Qodirbobo, was 74 years old when Qodiriy was born. Qodiriy did a variety of menial jobs before a merchant hired him as a book copier. He became interested in writing in the middle of the 1910s. Qodiriy was briefly arrested in 1926 for his article \\"Yig ªindi gaplar\\" (\\"A Collection of Rumors\\") that was published in Mushtum. Later, he enjoyed the protection and patronage of the Uzbek communist party leader, Akmal Ikramov, but was left exposed by Ikramov's arrest in 1937. He was arrested again on December 31, 1937, as \\"enemy of the people\\". He was executed on October 4, 1938, in Tashkent.  Work  Qodiriy's most famous works are the historical novels O ªtgan kunlar (Days Gone By) (1922) and Mehrobdan chayon (Scorpion in the Pulpit) (1929). O ªtgan kunlar is the first full-length novel by an Uzbek author. Qodiriy's stories Kalvak Mahzumning xotira daftaridan (From Mahzum the Simpleton‚Äôs Diary) and Toshpo ªlat tajang nima deydir? (What Does Irritated Toshpo ªlat Say?) are considered to be one of the best satirical stories in Uzbek. Qodiriy also wrote many plays and numerous newspaper articles. He was fluent in Arabic, Persian, and Russian. Qodiriy translated into the Uzbek language the works of many famous Russian writers such as Nikolai Gogol and Anton Chekhov. In particular, he translated Gogol's Marriage (1842) into Uzbek. He is rumoured to have written another novel, Emir Umar's Slave Girl set in the early nineteenth century during the reigns of Emir Umar, khan of Kokand, and his son, Matali. This novel (if it existed) is assumed to have been destroyed by the NKVD after Qodiriy's arrest.  In literature  Qodiriy is the central character in the novel Jinlar basmi yoxud katta o'yin (The Devils' Dance) by Hamid Ismailov, published in Tashkent in 2016, and translated into English in 2018.

Most of the privileges were granted between the late 14th and early 16th centuries. By the end of that period, the szlachta had succeeded in garnering numerous privileges, empowering themselves and limiting the powers of the monarch to an extent unprecedented elsewhere in Europe at the time. Genesis The privileges of the szlachta are linked to the rise of the nobility as a social class in Poland, and to the weakening of the monarchy during the period of Poland's political fragmentation, coupled with the institution of elective monarchy (see royal elections in Poland). Development Before the mid-14th century when the Polish monarchs granted privileges to Polish nobles, they did so on a provincial basis. The Privilege of Cienia, which was bestowed by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Laskonogi in 1228, was the first such privilege and was conferred upon knights of the Lesser Poland province. However, with the rise of the unified szlachta class, the way in which privileges were granted began to change. As a class, the szlachta first acquired country-wide privileges in the mid-14th century, with the first one being the Privilege of Buda, issued by Casimir the Great in 1355. Under the terms of this privilege, the king promised not to levy any extraordinary taxes, and to compensate the nobles for any losses they suffered on his behalf while fighting abroad. Polish szlachta nobles in Gda≈Ñsk. Painting by Wilhelm August Stryowski. Another milestone privilege came in 1374 when Louis I of Hungary issued the Privilege of Koszyce, under which the king promised not to levy any taxes without agreement from the szlachta. From this, the nobles derived considerable leverage in their future dealings with the monarchy. Louis also promised to pay the ransom for any nobles taken into captivity during wars abroad, and promised that the nobles would not have to aid in construction of castles unless they gave prior agreement for such a project to begin. This privilege also stated that the king had a duty to ensure that the country did not lose any territories, and regulated some issues related to the posting of officials. Finally, the king promised that the office of starosta would only be given to Poles, and that the offices of a given province (ziemia) would only be given to the local nobles. From 1387, soon after the beginning of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union, the privileges of the Polish nobility were notionally extended to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It would take several centuries, though, for the various elements of the Polish political system to be fully introduced in Lithuania. The Privilege of Czerwi≈Ñsk from 1422 issued by King W≈Çadys≈Çaw Jagie≈Ç≈Ço granted the nobility a promise that the king would not confiscate their estates without permission from the juridical court, and that the courts would operate on the basis of the written law. It also limited introduced the principle of incompatibilitas, limiting the ability of individuals to combine numerous offices. Finally, the right to mint money had to gain the acceptance of the royal council. More privileges were granted by Jagie≈Ç≈Ço through the Statute of Warta in 1423, which most notably declared the equality of all nobles. This Statute also increased the nobles' power over the peasantry by limiting the peasants' right to leave their villages, and giving the nobles the right to buy out the lands of so≈Çtys (peasant leaders). The Privilege of Jedlnia and Krak√≥w (1425, 1430, 1433), also issued by Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, granted the nobility the right of personal safety, making them immune from prosecution unless a proper warrant was issued by a court of justice. This was enshrined in the principle of nullum terrigenam possessionatum capiemus, nisi judicio rationabiliter fuerit convictus, or in short, neminem captivabimus. Nobles also received a guarantee that all of the high offices, including Church positions, would only be given to those of their class. Finally, the nobility received important rights with regards to control over the military: levying the pospolite ruszenie, the Polish lev√©e en masse, could not be done without their consent, and service abroad had to be compensated by the king. The Privilege of Cerkwica, granted in 1454 and confirmed the same year by the Statutes of Nieszawa, required the king to seek the nobles' approval at sejmiks, the local parliaments, when issuing new laws, levying the pospolite ruszenie, or imposing new taxes. This empowerment of the sejmiks marked the beginning of the Polish nobles' democracy (see Golden Liberty). This was expanded upon in 1496 through the Privilege of Piotrk√≥w (or Statutes of Piotrk√≥w). Issued by King Jan Olbracht, this privilege increased the nobles' position, albeit while reducing that of the peasantry and the townsfolk. While the nobles were granted a monopoly on owning and buying land outside cities and towns, the right of peasants to leave the land was further reduced, and noble judiciary powers over the peasantry were increased. This Privilege was a milestone towards the era of serfdom in Poland; some historians list it as the event that marks the introduction of serfdom to Poland. In 1501, King Aleksander Jagiello≈Ñczyk signed the Privilege of Mielnik, through which he gave the legislative initiative to the Senate of Poland. This privilege empowered the magnates who sat in the Senate, but it did not last long, as it was repealed by the general sejms (Poland's parliament) of 1504 and 1505. Nevertheless, another milestone in the development of the nobles' democracy was achieved in 1505 with the establishment of the constitutional principle of nihil novi, or Nihil Novi nisi commune consensu (\\"Nothing new without the general consent\\"). This privilege vastly empowered the entire general sejm (of which the Senate was a part) instead of just the Senate; its crucial part was the statement that no law could be passed without the approval of the entire sejm. Final privileges \\"The Commonwealth's Power at Its Zenith. Golden Liberty. The Election of 1573.\\" Painting by Jan Matejko. While some historians list the privilege of nihil novi as the culmination of the szlachtas empowerment process, others continue the list up to the end of the 16th century. Within this period, further privileges strengthening the nobles' position over the peasants came into effect when the sejm of 1520 in Bydgoszcz introduced laws that obliged peasants to provide labor to the nobles. It also gave the nobles unrestricted access to the Vistula river, and reduced their vulnerability to city and towns' courts. The king, Zygmunt I of Poland, also promised to convene the Sejm every four years, and in either 1518 or 1521 (sources vary) the peasants lost the right to complain to the royal court. In 1573 the Henrician Articles were introduced. A permanent contract between the \\"Polish nation\\" - in actuality, just the nobility of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth - and a newly elected king upon his election to the throne, the Articles set out the fundamental principles of governance and constitutional law in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Articles, named after King Henryk Walezy (Henry III of France), confirmed numerous previous privileges, and introduced new limitations on the monarch. Crucially, they confirmed that each new king would be elected by the nobles, and that his children had no right of inheritance with regards to the throne. The king was also required to convene the sejm every two years; had no right to declare war or peace without approval of the sejm; had to abide by the Warsaw Confederation's guarantees of religious freedom; and finally, agreed that if the monarch were to transgress against the law or the privileges of the szlachta, the Articles authorized the szlachta to refuse the king's orders and act against him. This later became known, in Polish practice, as the rokosz. In this regard, each king was required to swear that \\"if anything has been done by Us against laws, liberties, privileges or customs, we declare all the inhabitants of the Kingdom are freed from obedience to Us\\". In 1576, the right of ennoblement, except in wartime, was passed from the king to the sejm. Anna Pasterak lists 1578, the year in which King Stefan Batory passed the right to deal with appeals into the hands of the nobility, creating the Crown Tribunal, as the date that marks the end of the process of the shaping of the nobles' privileges in Poland. Robert Bideleux and Ian Jeffries, go even further, listing the year 1611 as the end, pointing out that it was only then that it was confirmed that only nobles were permitted to buy landed estates. Significance and criticism The empowerment of the szlachta and the incremental limitation of monarchic power in Poland can be seen as parallel to the guarantees made to the barons in Magna Carta, the precursor to the parliamentary ideals of Great Britain and, to a lesser extent, the United States, within which genuine democracy has evolved. In contrast with the centralizing of power during the 15th century by the so-called \\"New Monarchs\\" of Western Europe, the empowerment of the szlachta can be interpreted as a centripetal movement, to localized aristocratic power and a weak central state, which \\"had become merely an institution stripped of all substance\\", as Fernand Braudel remarked. The dominance of the szlachta over other classes and the monarch was unprecedented in the contemporary Europe. At the same time it was paid for by the weakening of the other classes (peasantry and townsfolk), and the central (royal) power, which led to the weakening of the Polish state. The nobles' political monopoly on power resulted in stifling the development of the towns and cities and hurting the economy, which, coupled with their control over taxation, kept at a very low level, starved the government of income.

The largest single contingent of victims came from Southampton, the home of most of the crew, which consequently has the greatest number of memorials. Titanic was built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and had a \\"guarantee party\\" of engineers from shipbuilders Harland and Wolff aboard all of whom were lost in the disaster and are commemorated by a prominent memorial in the city. Other contingents of engineers aboard the ship came from the maritime cities of Liverpool in England and Glasgow in Scotland, which erected their own memorials. Several prominent victims, such as Titanics captain, were commemorated individually. Elsewhere, in the United States and Australia, public memorials were erected to commemorate all the victims. Great Britain =Colne= Memorial to Wallace Hartley, Colne Wallace Hartley, the bandleader aboard Titanic, was buried in his home town Colne in Lancashire under a fine headstone engraved with the opening bars of the hymn Nearer, My God, to Thee. The townspeople also erected a monument to him on Albert Road. It was originally intended to be a commemorative drinking fountain until the memorial committee realised that might be inappropriate given that Hartley had drowned. It was therefore decided to erect a bronze bust of Hartley mounted on a plinth. Below the bust, sitting on cornices, are two caped female figures holding lyres in their hands. The original figures were stolen and have been replaced by plastic replicas. =Glasgow= Titanic Engineers' Memorial in Glasgow A memorial to thirty-six engineers aboard Titanic is located in the offices of the Scottish Opera at 39 Elmbank Crescent, Glasgow ‚Äì formerly the headquarters of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, whose members funded the memorial. The memorial, designed by Kellock Brown, was unveiled on 15 April 1914. It consists of a marble plaque surmounted by two female nudes bearing a wreath. The dedication states that the memorial's purpose is: The Glasgow Titanic Engineers' memorial does not include the names of William Duffy (Chief Engineer's Clerk), or of Thomas Andrews (Managing Director of Harland and Wolff, principal designer of the Titanic and leader of the commissioning team on board), both of whom are named on the Titanic Engineers' Memorial, Southampton. =Godalming= The body of Titanics Senior Wireless Operator, Jack Phillips, was never recovered but he is commemorated by a headstone in the shape of an iceberg in the Old Cemetery of Godalming in Surrey. A cloister and garden was built in his memory adjoining the town's Church of St Peter and St Paul. It was dedicated on 15 April 1914 and provided with a fountain donated by the Postal Telegraph Clerks' Association. The inscription reads: > This Cloister is Built in Memory of John George Phillips A Native of This > Town Chief Wireless Telegraphist of The Ill-Fated SS Titanic He Died at His > Post When the Vessel Foundered in Mid-Atlantic On the 15th Day of April 1912 The cloister has been altered over the years in response to vandalism and neglect but was renovated in 1993. Phillips is also commemorated in nearby Farncombe, his home village, where a brass tablet was erected in the Church of St. John the Evangelist. =Lichfield= Statue of Captain Edward Smith, Lichfield Titanics captain Edward Smith is commemorated by a statue in Beacon Park, Lichfield ‚Äì a town with which he had absolutely no connection, as he had been born in Hanley, Staffordshire and lived in Southampton. Officially the decision was taken because Lichfield was \\"about half-way between Liverpool and London [and] would be convenient alike to British and American subscribers [to the memorial's costs]\\", and also because it was the cathedral city of the diocese in which the captain had been born. Unofficially it may also have been due to reticence on the part of Hanley's authorities to further commemorate someone who bore a major burden of responsibility for the disaster. Smith had, in any case, already been commemorated in Hanley's Town Hall with a plaque reading: The plaque was removed in 1961, given to a local school and then returned to the Town Hall but remounted in the interior of the building in 1978, illustrating Hanley's continued ambivalence over its most famous local son. The statue of Smith in Lichfield was sculpted by Kathleen Scott, the widow of the Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott. It was unveiled by his daughter, Helen Melville Smith, on 29 July 1914. It attracted some controversy as Smith had been heavily criticised by the British inquiry into the disaster. Several prominent citizens signed a petition opposing the statue but it was rejected, and the unveiling went ahead as planned. However, the placement of the statue suggests that the city council was not entirely comfortable with it; it is not in a particularly visible place, nor is it readily accessible. Most notably, the dedication does not even mention Titanic, instead commemorating Smith for: > Bequeathing to his countrymen the Memory and Example of A Great Heart, A > Brave Life, and A Heroic Death. After the wreck of the Titanic was found in 1985 the former ambivalence of both Lichfield and Hanley disappeared as the statue suddenly became a tourist attraction. The words \\"Captain Smith was Captain of the Titanic\\" were added to its plinth and both Hanley and Stoke-on-Trent made requests for the statue to be moved to their towns. Lichfield refused, telling Stoke that Lichfield \\"had been responsible for cleaning the pigeon droppings off the statue for the past seventy years.\\" =Liverpool= Although Titanic never visited her home port of Liverpool, a significant percentage of Titanic's crew members were from Liverpool. The Memorial to the Engine Room Heroes of the Titanic was completed in May 1916 but was not formally dedicated due to the ongoing World War I. It is situated at Pier Head in Liverpool City Centre close to the former White Star Line headquarters. A plaque dedicated to the ship's musicians is located in the city's Philharmonic Hall on Hope Street. =London= A small Titanic Memorial Garden is located in the grounds of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. It was opened in April 1995 by Edith Haisman, at the time one of the oldest living survivors of the disaster. Another memorial plaque hangs in the Institute of Marine Engineers headquarters at 80 Coleman Street, listing thirty-eight names. The memorial is topped by a figure of Triton driving a team of four polar bears. On either side are sculpted figures similar to those on the Engineers' Memorial in Southampton. =Southampton= Titanic Engineers' Memorial, Southampton Most of the victims of the disaster came from the United Kingdom. No town was harder hit than Southampton; of the crew's 918 members, only 213 survived and 539 of those who perished came from Southampton. Many local churches and graveyards have plaques and small memorials to those who died. A year after the disaster, in April 1913, a memorial to the ship's musicians was unveiled but was destroyed by German bombing in World War II. It has since been replaced by a replica situated on the corner of Cumberland Place and London Road. The following April, the Titanic Engineers' Memorial was dedicated in front of 100,000 people. On 27 July 1915, a small memorial fountain made of Portland stone commemorating all of the lost crew members was unveiled on Southampton Common. It became the target of vandalism and was moved into the ruined Holyrood Church in 1972. A memorial to the British postal staff aboard Titanic was located in the Southampton Docks Post Office, then moved to the High Street Post Office, and is now on display outside the Council Chambers at the City's Guildhall. The ship's mainly Italian and French restaurant workers and their boss, Luigi Gatti, all perished in the disaster. They are commemorated by the Gatti Memorial in St Joseph's Church. Ireland Ireland, which was part of the United Kingdom at the time of the sinking, had four principal connections with Titanic; she had been built in Belfast, a number of her engineers, designers and crewmen were from northern Ireland, many of her passengers (especially in Third Class) were from southern Ireland and her last port of call was Queenstown (now Cobh) on the south coast of Ireland. The Titanic Memorial in Belfast was unveiled on 26 June 1920 to commemorate twenty-two men from the city who had died in the disaster. Designed by Sir Thomas Brock RA, it was carved from Carrara marble and depicts a personification of Death holding a laurel wreath over the head of a drowned sailor. The Irish Free State (now the Republic of Ireland) had little interest in commemorating the disaster and it was not until 1998 that a Titanic memorial was erected in Cobh. It consists of a bas-relief depicting third-class passenger Margaret Rice and her five sons, all of whom died in the sinking, and bears the dedication: \\"Commemorating RMS Titanic and her last port of call on her maiden and final voyage, April 12, 1912\\". The town plans to install a memorial garden to mark the centenary of the ship's sinking. Waterford: There is a memorial in the seaside Village of Bunmahon to local man Frank Dewan Who was lost while traveling as a Third class passenger to visit his son in Montana. The memorial is located on the main coast road between Dungarvan and Tramore. United States Titanic Memorial, Washington D.C. * The first monument ever erected in memory of the Titanic in America, and possibly the world, was built in the small town of Libertytown, Maryland at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church. The Church at the time was beautifying their church cemetery by building a calvary crucifixion scene. When news of the disaster reached Libertytown, the monument was dedicated to the victims of the Titanic on April 19, 1912, just one day after the first reports that the ship had sunk.http://www.catholicreview.org/article/home/libertytown-parish-is-home-to- first-titanic-memorial * An inscribed plaque in the Boston Symphony Hall commemorates Titanics musicians with the dedication: \\"In memory of the devoted musicians who were drowned still playing as the Titanic went down, 15 April 1912\\". * Two Titanic memorials stand in New York. On 13 April 1913, the Titanic Memorial Lighthouse was constructed on the roof of the Seamen's Church Institute headquarters at 25 South Street in downtown Manhattan. It was later moved to a new location in the South Street Seaport area. * Straus Park in the Upper West Side district of Morningside Heights commemorates Isidor Straus and his wife Ida, who both died in the disaster. The centrepiece of the park is the Isidor and Ida Straus Memorial, erected in 1915 to commemorate the couple. Its dedication reads: \\"Erected by voluntary contributions from many fellow citizens and accepted for the City of New York by Mayor John Purroy Mitchel and Cabot Ward, Commissioner of Parks. AD MCMXV.\\" * The Straus cenotaph in Woodlawn Cemetery was designed by James Gamble Rogers and created by Lee Lawrie as an art deco version of an Egyptian funeral barge in 1928. Harm, Gregory Paul, Lee Lawrie‚Äôs Prairie Deco: History in Stone at the Nebraska State Capitol, Concierge Marketing, Omaha, NE, 2018 p. 56 * The Titanic Memorial in Washington, D.C. stands next to the Washington Channel near Fort Lesley J. McNair. It stands high and depicts a male figure with arms outstretched. The memorial was unveiled on 26 May 1931 by Helen Herron Taft, the widow of President William Howard Taft, who held office at the time of the disaster and whose military aide Major Archibald Butt died in the sinking. It originally stood in Rock Creek Park before being moved to its current site on P Street SW in 1968. * The Butt-Millet Memorial Fountain is a memorial fountain located in the President's Park in Washington, D.C.. Dedicated in October 1913, it commemorates the deaths of Archibald Butt (the military aide to President William Howard Taft) and Francis Davis Millet (a journalist and painter, and Butt's close friend and housemate), both of whom died during the sinking. * The 106 passengers on the Titanic who were heading to Pennsylvania are memorialized on a park bench near Audubon, Pennsylvania. This bench is located along the Schuylkill River Trail where it is met by the Pawlings Road Trailhead. Australia The SS Titanic Memorial Bandstand, Ballarat Two memorials to Titanics musicians were erected in Australia. The local bandsmen of the outback mining town of Broken Hill, New South Wales erected the Titanic Musicians' Memorial, dedicated on 21 December 1913 and funded by the Amalgamated Miners Association Band. Its dedication declares that it was \\"Erected by the Citizens of Broken Hill as a memorial to the heroic bandsmen of the steamship Titanic who, playing to the end, calmly faced certain death whilst women, children and their fellow-men were being rescued from the wreck of that ill-fated vessel off the coast of Newfoundland on the 15th April 1912\\". Another memorial dedicated to their memory was The SS Titanic Memorial Bandstand erected in 1915 in Ballarat, Victoria. Designed by George Clegg and funded by the Victorian Band Association at a cost of ¬£150, it stands in the Sturt Street Gardens in front of the Mechanics Institute. The structure is an unusual example of Edwardian bandstand design with multiple oriental-style roofs. Canada Most of the bodies recovered after the disaster were buried in Halifax, Nova Scotia. 150 are buried in three cemeteries: Fairview, with 121, Mount Olivet, with nineteen, and Baron de Hirsch, with ten. A simple headstone of black granite marks most graves, recording only the victim's name (if known) or the number of the body if the name was not known, and the date 15 April 1912. Exception were made if friends or relatives wanted to erect a more elaborate headstone at their own expense; one such example is that of the grave of the Titanics chief steward, Ernest Freeman, whose headstone was donated by the White Star Line's chairman J. Bruce Ismay. The graves are still maintained under a trust established by the White Star Line.

Its name is a derived from the phrase An t-Allt M√≤r, Gaelic for big burn, referring to its water source the Auchinderran burn. It was founded in 1895 by Alexander Edward, then owner of the Benrinnes distillery. The distillery was originally powered by a waterwheel, and was soon adapted to use a steam engine instead, which ran day and night for 70 years, apart from maintenance. During maintenance hours power was provided by the mainly retired waterwheel. The steam engine is now on display at the distillery site. The distillery was expanded in 1898, and production doubled. In 1899 the distillery was owned by Pattisons which went bankrupt in that year. Production plummeted, and the distillery closed. Aultmore reopened around 1904, and closed again during World War I due to barley shortages It reopened again after World War I ended, and was bought by John Dewar and sons in 1923. Shortly thereafter, in 1925, it was bought by Distiller Company. It changed hands again in 1930, when it was bought by Scottish Malt Distillers. The distillery was in the 1950s one of the first to use the draff, a wasteproduct of whisky production, as animal feed. The distillery's malting floors closed in 1968 and the entire distillery was rebuilt and expanded in 1970. A new spirit still and wash still were placed in addition to the two stills that were already present, and Aultmore Reopened in 1971. In 1998 the distillery was sold back to Bacardi subsidiary Dewars, which had previously owned Aultmore between 1923 and 1925. Aultmore produced their first official bottling, a 12-year-old, in 2004, after an earlier flora and fauna release, and an earlier rare malts release.

This species of snail is found on emergent vegetation in lentic environments, and also submerged among macrophytes. Distribution The distribution of Omalonyx convexus includes Brazil. Description Omalonyx convexus can be up to 4 cm in total length. Tegument and mantle coloring varies between milky- white, orange and beige. The tegument and mantle have irregularly sized and distributed blackish spots, which, depending on their quantity, can sometimes give the animal a dark gray appearance. Beige was the most commonly observed coloring (Arruda & Thom√©). Because of their translucence, milky-white individuals sometimes display the same coloring as the substrate. Because of its wide variability in color, Omalonyx convexus can be confused with other Omalonyx species: Omalonyx matheroni, Omalonyx pattersonae and Omalonyx unguis. The shell is translucent with a slightly amber tint, and it can be covered by the mantle to various extents. The shell was not completely covered by the mantle in any of the specimens observed by Arruda and Thom√©. { Beige colored Omalonyx convexus. Beige colored Omalonyx convexus with a darkish- gray appearance. } Ecology =Habitat= Arruda and Thom√© found this species in both clean and polluted freshwater environments (polluted by household sewage), as well as on both natural and artificial substrates. The habitat of Omalonyx convexus includes vegetation bordering ditches used for rice paddy irrigation, drainage ditches, floodplains, lakes, rivers and streams. The species was also found on the dry portion of a semi-submerged tree in a temporarily flooded location. These snails are mainly seen on the macrophytes Eicchornia azurea, Salvinia auriculata, Pistia stratiotis and Eryngium species, but they were also found on artificial substrates such as canvas, cardboard, plastic bottles, tetra-pak boxes and styrofoam. Arruda & Thom√© reported that the snails are found on different substrate areas during the course of the day, a behavioral adaptation to guard against desiccation, since apparently the temperature change influences their choice of habitat substrates. In the early morning (between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.) and at the end of the afternoon (between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.) during sunny days, the animals were observed on the stem and on the adaxial surface of the macrophyte leaves, on grasses in flooded areas and under adjacent vegetation on the banks of dikes and lakes. In this last case, they were well camouflaged, and it was very difficult to find them. During the hottest hours of the day (between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.), they were found on flowers, roots, abaxial surface of leaves, and close to the base of macrophyte flowers. =Feeding habits= Their diet is basically plant tissues, although pollen grains and non-vegetal food items (mites) were also found in their crop contents.

U Lwin was born in Rangoon's Pazundaung Township to parents Ba Tha and Thein. He first joined the Burma Independence Army in 1942 and served during World War II and in anti-rebel and anti- Kuomintang campaigns in the 1940s to 1950s, after Burma declared its independence. After martial law was declared in 1962, he served various roles including Minister of Finance, deputy prime minister and member of the Revolutionary Council under the Burma Socialist Programme Party, until his resignation in 1980. U Lwin is Secretary of the NLD and is a former party Treasurer. He was among the NLD representatives who boycotted the National Convention in December 1995 and is a former BSPP Deputy Prime Minister and member of the BSPP State Council.He completed high school in Rangoon before World War II and served in the Burma Independence Army (BIA), Burma Defence Army (BDA) and with the Patriotic Burmese Force (PBF) from 1942-1945. He completed BDA officer training at the Japanese Royal Military Academy and from 1952-1954 studied at the British Royal Military Academy. He was also the Military Attach√© to the USA. U Lwin was put under de facto house arrest on 22 September 2000 and released on 1 December 2000.[ Member of CRPP, Chairperson of Committee for Health and Social Affairs ] U Lwin received 18,189 valid votes or 68% in the 1990 elections. { The only original member of the executive committee, who was left after 1990 to help U Aung Shwe in his struggle to keep the NLD intact through the years that threatened its viability as a political party, was U Lwin, the treasurer. U Lwin had joined the Burmese Independence Army as an 18-year-old boy at the outbreak of the war. In August 1943 he was among a batch of Burmese cadets chosen to go to Japan for training at the Rikugun Shikan Gakko (army academy). By the time the young Burmese officers had completed their training in April 1945, the anti- fascist resistance movement had started and U Lwin and his fellow graduates of the military academy remained in Hakone until October 1945, making charcoal which they sold to buy food. U Lwin continued with his career in the army after independence and was sent on training courses to England and West Germany. In 1959 he was sent to Washington as military attache. On his return from the United States he spent some years as deputy commander of Central Command, then commander of South Eastern Command before he was asked to come back to Rangoon to become a deputy minister. As the military government that assumed power in 1962 took on a civilian garb under the Burmese Socialist Programme Party, U Lwin served successively as minister of finance, deputy prime minister and a member of the state council. It was as a member of the state council that he resigned in 1980. U Lwin joined the NLD in 1988 and was appointed treasurer because of his experience in finances and his unquestioned integrity. In 1992, when the NLD was forced to reorganize its executive committee, U Lwin took on the post of secretary, while U Aung Shwe became chairman. He died of natural causes at his home in Yangon's Bahan Township on 7 December 2011. He was subsequently cremated at the Yayway Cemetery.

In 2011, Hawa Ltd. also launched ONTVRamadan, a temporary channel that aired during the month of Ramadan and broadcast soap operas and \\"big budget drama.\\" Ahmed Shafik Interview and Resignation On Wednesday, March 2, 2011, ONTV announced on its website that Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik, who had been appointed by ousted president Hosni Mubarak before his resignation, would be joined by ONTV financier Naguib Sawiris and Kamel Abu El-Maged on talkshow host Reem Maged's program, Baladna bel Masry. This discussion was to be followed by Yosri Fouda's hosting of novelist Alaa Al Aswany, author of The Yacoubian Building, and veteran journalist Hamdy Kandeel on the program Akher Kilam. The first two hours of the broadcast featured Shafik responding to softball questions by Sawiris as he defended the Egyptian government and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces' handling of the post- revolution transition. Shafik agreed to stay on after midnight, however, to join the discussion with Al Aswany and Kandeel. Al Aswany was highly critical of Shafik over the remaining two hours in the broadcast, and Shafik became clearly irritated. At one point, Al Aswany accused Shafik, saying \\"[i]f your son had been one of those who got run over by the police cars, you would not have remained silent like that.\\" Shafik attempted to defend his previously- publicized plan to turn Tahrir Square into an Egyptian version of London's Hyde Park, where protesters could gather to make speeches. Al Aswany responded, accusing him of \\"ignoring the more than 300 people who died in the protests and wanting to give out 'sweets and chocolate.'\\" The Wall Street Journal wrote that Shafik retorted, \\"'wanting the people to stay in a clean place is wrong?' ... 'We should find out who killed them first,' answered Mr. Aswany.\\" Al Aswany furthermore accused Shafik of being a holdover of the regime that Egyptians had struggled to topple, and that he was unfit to represent Egyptians in the post-revolution era. The episode led to Shafik's announcement of his resignation as Egyptian Prime minister the next day. His poor performance and the vocal reaction to his responses, as well as the response to Al Aswany's fierce questioning of him, allegedly \\"helped push Egypt's military rulers into acceding to protester demands and pushing out Mr. Shafiq.\\".

Its chemical structure is very similar to that of the illegal drug MDMA, the only difference being the replacement of the Œ±-methyl group with an Œ±-cyclopropyl group. MDMA has been found in animal studies and reported in unauthorised human self-experiments to be effective in the short-term relief of Parkinson's disease symptoms, especially when used alongside conventional treatment with L-DOPA. However the illegal status of MDMA and concerns about its potential for recreational use, neurotoxicity and potentially dangerous side effects mean that it is unlikely to be investigated for medical use in this application, and so alternative analogues were investigated. Replacing the Œ±-methyl with a cyclopropyl dramatically reduces affinity for the noradrenaline transporter and 5-HT2A receptor targets, while retaining high serotonin transporter affinity and markedly increasing affinity for the dopamine transporter (and as such, it is one of the few selective SDRIs or serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitors). This change causes UWA-101 to lack cytotoxicity and MDMA-like behavioral effects in animals, but while retaining similar or slightly improved anti-Parkinsonian effectiveness when compared to MDMA. This research was a continuation of earlier work from the same team which showed that replacing the Œ±-methyl group of MDMA with larger aromatic ring systems produced compounds which lacked psychoactivity and neurotoxicity, but had potent anti-cancer effects against Burkitt's lymphoma cells in vitro. UWA-121 is the (R)-enantiomer of UWA-101 and the (S)-enantiomer is UWA-122. Both are active monoamine reuptake inhibitors. Another relative is UWA-104 (\\"Œ±-isopropyl-MDMA\\"), which is also active.

It began in the early 20th century in the Franconian Switzerland region of Upper Franconia but has spread to other regions. The decoration is usually kept from Good Friday until two weeks after Easter.  History  Decorating a well for Easter honours water, essential for life, and Easter, the feast of renewed life. In addition to eggs (now often artificial, to guard against vandalism), paper ribbons called \\"Pensala\\" and garlands of evergreens are woven around well-heads or formed into crowns over them. In several locations flowers are also used. The Franconian Switzerland (), so called for its rugged rock outcroppings, lies in the region of Upper Franconia in northern Bavaria. The tradition of Osterbrunnen began there in the early 20th century. The Osterbrunnen in Aufse√ü is said to have been first decorated around 1909; that in the village of Engelhardsberg has been dressed since 1913. After World War II, public wells became less important, reducing the amount of decoration. However, beginning in 1952, Dr. Kunstmann and his wife, of Nuremberg, worked to revive the tradition in Franconian Switzerland. During the 1980s the idea spread to other parts of Upper Franconia. The decorated wells became a tourist attraction; the wells in Heiligenstadt and Bieberbach are destinations for bus tours from cities such as Munich and Dresden. Heiligenstadt is visited by some 80 buses a day. The fountain in Bieberbach was listed in 2001 in the Guinness World Records for 11,108 hand-painted eggshells. The tradition of the Osterbrunnen has also spread outside Franconia to Hesse and to the Steigerwald, to the valley of the Altm√ºhl, to Saxony, to the Palatinate, to the Saarland and to Swabia.  Possible origins  There was an old tradition throughout Germany of drawing water in silence at Easter for purification and medical treatment,Otto von Reinsberg-D√ºringsfeld, Das festliche Jahr: in Sitten, Gebr√§uchen und Festen der germanischen V√∂lker, Leipzig: Spamer, 1863, , p. 102, referring to Maundy Thursday. which was sometimes referred to as Osterbrunnen.Max H√∂fler, \\"Das Jahr im oberbayerischen Volksleben, mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Volksmedicin\\", Beitr√§ge zur Anthropologie und Urgeschichte Bayerns 13.1‚Äì3 (1899) p. 17 Wells were cleaned and decorated with garlands and sometimes eggs in May, a tradition which survived relatively late in the 19th century in Bacharach.von Reinsberg-D√ºringsfeld, pp. 143‚Äì44 Other dates for well decorating included Pentecost in southern Thuringia and Midsummer in Fulda; it took place at Easter in Bohemia.Karl Weinhold, \\"Die Verehrung der Quellen in Deutschland\\", Abhandlungen der k√∂niglichen-preu√üischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Berlin, philosophisch-historische Classe 1 (1898) online at heiligequellen.de Nineteenth-century writers, particularly Karl Weinhold, suggested that these traditions of well cleaning and decorating were remnants of pre-Christian practices. In work first published in 1987, Claudia Schillinger has argued for a Wendish origin of the decoration of wells in Franconia.Claudia Schillinger, Osterbrunnen in der Fr√§nkischen Schweiz: Schwerpunkt und Ausweitung eines Brauchs, Bamberg: Bayerische Verlagsanstalt, 1987, .

The Supreme Court confirmed the principle laid down in Wickman v Schuler that, if the words of a contract have ambiguous meanings, the court will interpret it in a manner that most accords with \\"business common sense\\". There is no requirement for a party to prove that the alternative interpretation is entirely unreasonable. Facts Rainy Sky was one of five ship-owning firms that ordered vessels from Jinse Shipbuilding Co, a South Korean shipbuilder, at a cost of US$33,300,000 per ship. The payment was to be made in five equal installments. The contract between Rainy Sky and Jinse permitted Rainy Sky to rescind the contract if various events occurred (such as late delivery or inadequate performance of the vessel, or loss of the vessel before delivery). It also obliged Jinse to refund the payments if it became insolvent, although, in this case, the contract would not automatically be rescinded. Jinse were required to provide the buyers with a performance bond, guaranteeing the repayment of the buyer's money. Jinse obtained such a bond from Kookmin Bank - however, the terms of the bond did not match exactly the terms of the contract, and the central issue in the court case was the interpretation of the bond. The bond stated (inter alia): Rainy Sky had made two of the required payments when Jinse encountered financial difficulties and entered into an insolvency process. This triggered the requirement for it to repay the money, and, as it could not do this, Rainy Sky called on Kookmin Bank to honour the guarantee. Kookmin, however, claimed that it was under no obligation to make the payment, as the bond only covered \\"rejection of the vessel\\" and \\"termination, cancellation or rescission of the contract\\", not the insolvency of Jinse. Judgment =High Court= In the Commercial Court, Simon J, in a summary judgment, ruled that the bond did cover Jinse's obligation to repay on insolvency. He emphasised \\"all such sums\\" in paragraph 3, and stated that Kookmin's construction \\"has the surprising and uncommercial result that the Buyers would not be able to call on the Bond on the happening of the event which would be most likely to require the first class security.\\" =Court of Appeal= Kookmin appealed, and in the Court of Appeal, Patten LJ (with whom Thorpe LJ agreed) supported their interpretation. Patten LJ ruled that the word \\"such\\" in paragraph 3 could not be ignored, and that, while it was possible that it referred only to the \\"pre- delivery installments\\" mentioned in paragraph 2, as a matter of grammar, it was more likely (\\"[not] in any way evenly balanced\\") that it referred to the sums defined in paragraph 2 as a whole (namely, those due on rejection, termination, cancellation, rescission, or total loss). He stated that the alternative interpretation \\"robs paragraph 2 of any purpose or effect.\\" The critical issue was therefore whether or not Kookmin's interpretation was commercially unreasonable. After citing earlier authorities (Wickman v Schuler [1974] AC 235, The Antaios [1984] AC 191 and Chartbrook v Persimmon [2009] UKHL 38), he ruled that, because Kookmin's interpretation was not \\"absurd or irrational\\" or \\"so extreme as to suggest that it was unintended\\", merely unfavourable to Rainy Sky, it should be accepted. The alternative course would \\"put us in real danger of substituting our own judgment of the commerciality of the transaction for that of those who were actually party to it.\\" However, Sir Simon Tuckey delivered a dissenting judgement, in which he stated that Simon J's first-instance view that Kookmin's interpretation was \\"surprising and uncommercial\\" was a legitimate reason for rejecting that interpretation, and that the judgement therefore should not be overturned. =Supreme Court= The Supreme Court allowed Rainy Sky's appeal. Lord Clarke delivered the judgement. Citing the case of Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd v National Westminster Bank plc [1995] 1 EGLR 97, he accepted the principle that \\"where the parties have used unambiguous language, the court must apply it\\", no matter how commercially unreasonable the result. However, in cases of ambiguity, the court should choose the interpretation that is \\"most consistent with business common sense\\" - there is no obligation on the party contesting the interpretation to prove that it is so extreme that the parties could not have intended it in any circumstances, as Patten LJ's test would imply. Referring to Barclays Bank plc v HHY Luxembourg SARL [2010] EWCA Civ 1248, he held that the correct test was stated by Longmore LJ in that case: \\"If a clause is capable of two meanings, as on any view this clause is, it is quite possible that neither meaning will flout common sense. In such circumstances, it is much more appropriate to adopt the more, rather than the less, commercial construction.\\" Significance Various commentators, such as Oliver Gayner and Cathryn Hopkins of Olswang's and Thomas G. Heintzman of McCarthy T√©trault have suggested that parties to such cases may, as a result of this ruling, seek to introduce expert evidence on the precise degree of \\"commercial reasonableness\\" that a particular interpretation of a contract would imply.

It is the second of his studio releases since 1979's Victim of Love without any of his regular band members. The album was released in the United Kingdom on 16 September 2013, and debuted at No. 3 on the UK album chart, his highest-charting studio album in his home country since 2001's Songs from the West Coast, and at No. 4 on the Billboard 200. It is also his highest-charting solo album in the United States since Blue Moves in 1976. The album's premiere single, \\"Home Again\\", was released on 24 June 2013, the same day the album became available for pre-order. On 28 August 2013, a video for \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)\\" was released on YouTube. Production  The album was written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin and produced in Los Angeles by The Union producer T-Bone Burnett. Burnett suggested that John return to the piano, bass and drums format of his very early years and the result, John says, is \\"the most exciting solo record I've done in a long, long time.\\" The Diving Board was initially written in two days. The album's release date was pushed back: though the record was originally planned for release in the fall of 2012, it was revealed on Taupin's website that it would instead be released in February 2013 for promotional reasons. Later, it was pushed back again. It was revealed on 28 September 2012 in Rolling Stone magazine that John was dissatisfied with the balance on the album and that he had started to write more new songs for the album. He believed that many of the songs had a theme and that he wanted to write more songs after sitting on the project for so long. During a concert at the Perth Arena in Perth, Australia on 10 November 2012, John revealed that The Diving Boards release would be pushed back further, to May 2013. The delay in release was because John was to record more material for the album with Burnett in January 2013. On 8 January 2013 it was revealed by Taupin's website that the title of the album had been changed from The Diving Board to Voyeur. An article on Billboard published on 23 February 2013 revealed that the release date had once again been pushed back, this time until September 2013; the title of the album was back to The Diving Board again. The article also revealed the revised track list, which includes four new songs mixed in with the original material. A song originally stated for release on the album, titled \\"5th Avenue\\" (6:18), had been dropped. John called the revised album \\"The most piano-oriented album of my career\\" and said \\"It's my most adult album\\". In total the album's release had been pushed back four times. The album's premiere single \\"Home Again\\" was released on 24 June 2013, the same day the album became available for pre-order. On 28 August 2013, a video for \\"Mexican Vacation (Kids in the Candlelight)\\" was released on YouTube, being the album's second single. Reception =Critical= The Diving Board received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\", based on 24 reviews. Many critics praise the album as a \\"great return to form\\" and one of John's best albums of recent years and of his career. Alan Light of Rolling Stone gave the album a four star review commending its spare instrumentation and focus, saying that John has \\"regained his sense of musical possibility and taken a brave, graceful jump\\". Robert Hilburn, who famously reviewed John's American debut at the Troubadour in Los Angeles, praised The Diving Board's \\"finely crafted and deeply moving\\" songs that celebrate the past in a \\"fresh and revealing\\" manner. Hilburn goes on to say that if these songs had been played at the Troubadour in 1970 John would still have been \\"showered with applause and acclaim\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic was less enthusiastic. In a mixed review, he stated that the album is an \\"exceptional idea in theory; in practice it is ever so slightly formless.\\" =Commercial= In the United Kingdom, The Diving Board reached No. 3 on the album chart on its first week of release behind indie rock band Arctic Monkeys and Swedish dance music producer Avicii, selling 22,000 copies in its first week. The album was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry on 10 January 2014, signifying sales of 60,000 copies in the UK. In the United States, the album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 albums chart on its first week, with 47,000 copies sold. It is Elton John's 18th top 10 album on the chart. As of December 2015, the album has sold 150,000 copies in the US. It also debuted at No. 7 on the Canadian Albums chart. The single \\"Can't Stay Alone Tonight\\" became Elton John's 70th song to appear on the Adult Contemporary chart in the US, further extending his record for the most appearances on that chart that first began with \\"Your Song\\" in 1970. =Accolades= Rolling Stone placed the album at No. 25 on its list of the 50 Best Albums of 2013.

Cockburn Channel and the B√°rbara Channel have the same entrance into the Pacific, but it runs in an easterly direction along the south side of Clarence Island for 40 miles and into Magdalen Sound in Magellan Strait. In working through this passage the south shore ought to be preferred, as it is usually a weather shore, and it seems to be better provided with coves and inlets in which a vessel may find it convenient to anchor. Two rocks are plainly visible above water in the entrance to Cockburn Channel. One rock lies about 10.5 miles 168¬∞ from Mount Skyring and appears to be identical with Leon Rock, which is shown on the charts. The other lies northeastward of Tussac Rocks, about 7.5 miles 171¬∞ from Mount Skyring.

The center is an initiative of the Rigoberta Mench√∫ Foundation (specifically the Utizal Tijonikel Program), which is an institution accredited for its contributions to the defense of human rights especially of indigenous peoples which impels educational programs, citizen participation, community development and combating impunity. The Utzilal Tijonikel program, which translated from Kaqchikel into English means ‚Äúteaching to do the good thing‚Äù, offers also education complemented by a basic work orientation. The center serves approximately 150 Guatemalan children with 10 professors educating them. The majority of children attending this school live in poor circumstances, so that they receive financial support in order to attend this school. Without these benefits they would probably work on fields, like many of their parents do. History In 1999 the Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti hosted a charity concert, which goal it was to collect funds in order to found an institution that would provide education for the indigenous Maya children in Guatemala, mostly victims of the passed civil war in their country. Due to the friendship between the Nobel Peace Prize recipient and promoter of indigenous rights, Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum and Luciano Pavarotti they started a collaboration. Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum came up with the idea of a school and she got commissioned the organisation and construction of the school, which started in 2000. The education institute started in 2003. The Luciano Pavarotti Foundation transferred the building and the administration of the school to the Rigoberta Mench√∫ Tum Foundation, a long with an agreement to finance it until 2005. After 2005 the school had to be self-sufficient, which led to the fact that the school is running some other services in the touristic sector (little restaurant, room rental, tours to discover the Mayan culture) to finance their school operations.. Curriculum Students attend a variety of classes including Spanish, English, mathematics, science, weaving, carpentry, computing, dancing, and art. They are also taught the indigenous Kaqchikel language and Kaqchikel math to preserve the traditional Mayan wisdom. The Utizal Tijonikel Program's purpose is to teach \\"doing good\\" \\" and this also means to teach the acceptance of gender equality and its implementation. The school¬¥s vision includes sustainable education while maintaining respect for diverse cultures but also the respect and appreciation of their own Mayan culture. Their mission is to foster youth leaders who are pro-peace and pro-human rights and against racism.  Objectives of the Centro Educativo Pavarotti  * to give children a high academic level education * to promote human values and rights and interculturalism * to contribute to the sustainable devolvement of the rural communities around Volunteer Opportunities  Volunteer Opportunities  The Rigoberta Mench√∫ Foundation promotes \\"Intercultural Solidarity Tourism\\", a program which gives college students and educational institutions the opportunity to interact with the Mayan people and learn about the indigenous culture. Volunteers have many options to assist the persons in power. They can volunteer in classrooms by helping with lessons, teaching languages, but they can also take action and establish courses with educational purpose like one about environmental issues. Another big part of volunteers would be their engagement in establishing a tourism program, to help the Centro to finance itself and to create better conditions for their students. They will learn about the Mayan calendar, Kaqchikel language, culture, rituals, and the Guatemalan Civil War. The aim is interculturalism and solidarity between people of different cultures. Volunteers can also visit local communities and traditional tourist sites such as Antigua Guatemala and Iximche.

After going to university in the United States, she returned to Karen State, becoming involved in the Karen National Liberation Army. She left the country for the United States in 1967, after marrying a former classmate and US naval officer. Early life and education Louisa Charmaine Benson was born to Saw Benson (also known as Moses Ben-Zion Koder), a Jewish entrepreneur in Rangoon, and his wife Naw Chit Khin, a Karen woman. He was descended on his father's side from the Koder family, a prominent Cochin Jewish business clan in South India's Cochin (now Kochi), and on his mother's side from the Leynado family, a Sephardic Jewish family. Orphaned as a child, Koder was sent to Calcutta to be raised by aunts. He later converted to Christianity. In 1939, after returning to Rangoon, he married. During World War II, Louisa's parents were separated for lengthy periods as they tried to find safety from the Japanese occupation of Burma. After the war, the independence movement and Karen movement for autonomy resulted in more societal disruption. Louisa went to the United States for college. Marriage and career Benson returned to Karen State and in 1964 married Lin Htin, a commander of the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA). He died in 1965, and she led the Fifth Brigade. She fell out with the Karen National Union leadership following a power struggle with Bo Mya. As a \\"Most Wanted\\" independence warrior leader, Benson was urged by her people in 1967 to flee Burma to save her life. She emigrated to the United States by marrying Glenn Campbell Craig, a former classmate from her overseas studies at Tufts University. A scion of a Mayflower family, Craig had reconnected with her as a U.S. Naval officer after being assigned to Asian waters near Karen State. After emigrating, Louisa Benson Craig earned a master's degree in international affairs at Columbia University. She worked as an advocate for Burmese democracy and for resettlement of Burmese refugees in the United States. In 2004, she was named a plaintiff in a landmark human rights case against Unocal for profiting from the Burmese military's alleged human rights abuses by operating the Yadana gas field. Louisa had three children with Glenn Craig. After his naval career, he became an entrepreneur, helping found an international school publications enterprise based in California.

Pallister, The Cinema of Qu√©bec: Masters in Their Own House, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p 361 The film is a modern-day retelling of the classic Frankenstein story set in the 1980s.Eleanor Mannikka, \\"The Vindicator\\", Rovi, online at New York Times website, http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/52789/The-Vindicator/overview Its plot involves a man who was killed in an accident in a laboratory, but revived as part of an experiment as a cyborg. The film was released by 20th Century Fox and released on video by Key Video (a division of CBS/FOX Video), and is now out of print. The special effects were by Stan Winston. Plot Carl Lehman (David McIlwraith) is a scientist working on a next-generation space suit for the ARC corporation, run by the sinister Alex Whyte (Richard Cox), where all kinds of high-tech research is being conducted. One of these projects is developing \\"rage program\\" software that can sense when a user is provoked/endangered and take over its brain to destroy the attacker and then return to normal once the threat has been eliminated. The software is shown to be tested on monkeys, one of which dies after Whyte, out of curiosity, has the rage factor turned up beyond safe levels. After Carl confronts Whyte about some suspicious funding cuts, Whyte sends his employee Massey to rig an explosion in Carl's lab to kill him and disguise the death as a lab accident. ARC informs Carl's pregnant wife Lauren (Teri Austin) and daughter Catherine (Catherine Disher) that Carl has died. In reality, Whyte is keeping Carl's charred body in a suspension of oxygenating fluid which keeps his brain functioning. Using Carl's space suit and ARC's cutting-edge prosthetics technology, they build Carl a cyborg body and dub him \\"Project Frankenstein\\". The rage program is also installed, with a remote control unit acting as a safeguard. The reanimation initially fails, so researcher Gail Vernon (Lynda Mason Green) disassembles the suit. After the remote control unit is removed, a short circuit causes Carl to suddenly revive. When she tries to reinstall his control unit, he pushes Gail away. She falls onto a control panel, which releases all of the lab monkeys. They attack Gail in a rage and kill her. Carl sneaks out of the building and stows away on a garbage truck, which drops him into an incinerator. His flight suit is burned away, revealing the cybernetic prosthetics underneath. However, thanks to his immense strength, he is able to break out and heads for his residence. On the way, some street thugs chase him into an alley. When they attack him, his suit activates and sends him into a rage and he brutally overpowers and kills all of them. Realizing that the rage program forbids close contact with people, he talks to his wife from outside their house through a faulty ground wire in the synthesizer in their living room that they had earlier discovered receives radio signals. Later, the thugs' bodies are discovered. Whyte, fearing a police investigation of Project Frankenstein, hires the elite assassin Hunter (Pam Grier) to track down and eliminate Carl. The next day, Lauren visits Carl's colleague and friend Burt Arthurs (Maury Chaykin) to tell him about her conversation with Carl. Burt shows her security footage of the accident to convince her of Carl's death. In the evening, Carl's voice comes over the synthesizer again; this time, however, Whyte's accomplice Kessler is monitoring them. Carl learns that Massey signed his autopsy report and death certificate, and sets out to confront him. At his home, secured by Hunter's forces, Massey is snorting cocaine and evicting his girlfriend Lisa, when Carl appears to interrogate him. In doing so, Carl learns that if he can get to the suit's programming, he can remove the rage program. Massey shoots Carl in panic, which causes Carl to again lose control and he throws Massey out of the window. Lisa bears witness, so Hunter kills her to cover up the project. Carl flees down the sewers, and Hunter gives pursuit along with her men. They corner Carl, and their guns damage his life-support system. Carl defends himself by ripping open a gas line and manages to incinerate Hunter's men as well as Kessler, then escapes. Hunter confronts Whyte, who had not disclosed the Frankenstein enhancements, and he admits that the enhanced Carl is nearly indestructible. Meanwhile, Carl arranges a meeting with Lauren by coded message. Upset over his grotesque appearance, he exhorts her to leave him and move far away. He also asks her to summon Burt's help, which she does. Carl meets with him but, unbeknownst to Carl, Burt has betrayed him and is working for Whyte and the two have set a trap for Carl. He falls through a weakened floor into a trap of quick-setting resin. Whyte sends the block of resin to ARC, but Carl's strength prevails and he breaks out during transport. Meanwhile, Whyte tells Burt that he has to get rid of Lauren as well if he wants to keep his high paying position. Burt goes to the Lehman residence, where he confesses his love for Lauren and suggests that they should escape and be together and become a family. Lauren rebuffs him so he angrily assaults her by strangulation. Catherine comes home and attacks Burt and she and Lauren overpower him. As they are trying to escape, Hunter arrives and kills Catherine and Burt knocks Lauren unconscious. Burt knows that he is ruined if Lauren escapes, so Hunter advises that he take Lauren and Catherine and dump them in the nearby lake. Carl shows up and, in a panic, Burt rams him repeatedly with his car. Carl is sent into another rage and he crushes Burt's car, killing him, but not before Lauren slips out of the passenger door. However, she is captured by Hunter and taken to ARC to lure Carl. Meanwhile, Whyte's girlfriend is being interrogated by the police, hinting that Project Frankenstein will be investigated and defused. At ARC, Carl manages to evade the security cameras for some time, so Hunter goes on the intercom and threatens to kill Lauren unless he comes to the laboratory to bargain for her. There, Hunter throws Lauren onto Carl to provoke him, but he does not go into a rage, since he reprogrammed himself in the computer room while the cameras weren't monitoring him. Realizing she is no match for the cyborg, Hunter commits suicide. Carl and Lauren get to Whyte, who has continued his experiment by turning the corpses of Gail and Kessler into cyborgs and has programmed them to protect him. Whyte is also wearing one of the suits himself. Carl, his life-support failing, battles Whyte while Lauren dispatches the others by pulling their own life-support umbilical cables. As Whyte begins to overpower Carl, Lauren hands him an umbilical, which he connects to Whyte's suit and drowns him by filling his suit with fluid. His own fluid supply exhausted, Carl expires. Years later, Lauren is visiting an aeronautics museum with her son Carl Jr. There, they admire a display of the suits, one of which is Carl's original suit. A guide is heard explaining a fabricated story that Carl was the first to valiantly test the suit and that as a result of his suit being torched, they were able to fix its weaknesses and were able to then successfully deploy them on Mars. Meanwhile, Carl Jr. asks if he was a hero, to which Lauren responds that he was.
