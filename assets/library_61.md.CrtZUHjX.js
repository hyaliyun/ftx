Beginning in 1991, Jashari participated in attacks against the Serbian police before travelling to Albania to receive military training. Arrested in 1993, he was released at the behest of the Albanian Army and later returned to Kosovo, where he continued launching attacks against the Yugoslav establishment. In July 1997, he was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched an attack against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998. The battle that followed resulted in the deaths of 57 members of Jashari's family, including that of Jashari, his wife, brother and son. Seen as the \\"father of the KLA\\", Jashari is considered a symbol of Kosovar independence by ethnic Albanians. He was posthumously awarded with the title \\"Hero of Kosovo\\" following the disputed territory's declaration of independence in 2008. The National Theatre in Pristina, Pristina International Airport and the Olympic Stadium Adem Jashari have been named after him. Biography =Early life= Adem Shaban Jashari was born in the village of Prekaz, in the Drenica region of the Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo, on 28 November 1955 as Fazli Jashari. Descended from Kosovo Albanian guerrillas who had fought Yugoslav forces decades prior, he was raised on Albanian war stories and was rarely seen without a gun. According to the journalist Tim Judah, Jashari \\"hated the Serbs, and although he was one of the KLA’s early recruits, he was no ideological guerrilla.\\" =Guerrilla activities= Drenica is a hilly region in central Kosovo inhabited almost exclusively by Kosovo Albanians. Prior to the Kosovo War, the government of Yugoslavia considered it \\"the hotbed of Albanian terrorism.\\" Jashari was a farmer. In 1991, he participated in an armed uprising against the Yugoslav authorities in Kosovo. During this period, a Kosovo Albanian irredentist organization that came to be known as the Kosovo Liberation Army first emerged. From 1991 to 1992, Jashari and about 100 other ethnic Albanians wishing to fight for the independence of Kosovo underwent military training in the municipality of Labinot-Mal in Albania. Afterwards, Jashari and other ethnic Albanians committed several acts of sabotage aimed at the Serbian administrative apparatus in Kosovo. Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Hamëz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village. While in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of Sali Berisha and sent to jail in Tirana before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the Albanian Army. With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \\"no-go\\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years. These targeted the Yugoslav Army (VJ) and Serbian police in Kosovo. Jashari was convicted of terrorism in absentia by a Yugoslav court on 11 July 1997. Human Rights Watch subsequently described the trial, in which fourteen other Kosovo Albanians were also convicted, as \\"[failing] to conform to international standards.\\" Pursuing Jashari for the murder of a Serb policeman, Yugoslav forces again attempted to assault the Jashari compound in Prekaz on 22 January 1998. With Jashari not present, thousands of Kosovo Albanians descended on Prekaz and again succeeded in pushing the Serbs out of the village and its surroundings. The next month, a small unit of the KLA ambushed Serbian policemen. Four Serbs were killed and two were injured in the ensuing clashes. At dawn on 5 March 1998, the KLA launched an attack against a police patrol in Prekaz. =Death= In response to this attack, the Yugoslavs organized a \\"full-scale revenge mission\\" involving tanks, APCs and helicopters. They were backed up by artillery from a nearby ammunition factory. With the intention of \\"eliminating the suspects and their families,\\" the police attacked villages that had been identified as KLA strongholds, including Likošane and Ćirez. Human Rights Watch noted that \\"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond. During this period, a number of families left the compound. Jashari remained, ordering his family members to stay inside and telling his militants to resist to the last man. Once the two-hour deadline had expired, the two sides began exchanging gunfire. In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths. After a two or three-day siege, the police captured the Jashari compound. Once inside, they discovered that Jashari and his brother Hamëz had been killed. Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim. Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians were killed in the attack, including eighteen women and ten children under the age of sixteen. Goran Radosavljević, a major in the Serbian Interior Ministry, said that \\"[Jashari] used women, children and the elderly as hostages.\\" Speaking of the attack, Yugoslav General Nebojša Pavković stated that it was \\"a normal policing action against a well-known criminal. It was successful. The other details I don't remember.\\" The only survivor was Besarta Jashari, Hamëz Jashari's daughter. She claimed that the policemen had \\"threatened her with a knife and ordered her to say that her uncle (Adem Jashari) had killed everyone who wanted to surrender.\\" =Aftermath= Soon after the attack against Prekaz, 46 bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Pristina on 7 March before being returned to Skenderaj the next day. There, they were placed inside a warehouse located on the outskirts of town. Photographs taken during this time revealed that Jashari had received a bullet wound to the neck. On 9 March, the police publicly stated that they would themselves bury the bodies of those killed if they were not quickly claimed and buried by family members. The next day, the police dug a large grave near Donji Prekaz and buried the bodies of fifty-six people, ten of whom could not be identified. On 11 March, the bodies were disinterred by relatives and reburied in accordance with Islamic tradition on a field known as the \\"field of peace\\". The shootout at the Jashari family compound involving Adem Jashari, a KLA commander and surrounding Yugoslav troops in 1998 resulted in the massacre of most Jashari family members.. The deaths of Jashari and his family generated an international backlash against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. As news of the killings spread, armed Kosovo Albanian militias emerged throughout Kosovo, seeking to avenge Jashari's death as Albanians flocked to join the KLA. The event became a rallying myth for KLA recruitment regarding armed resistance to Yugoslav forces.. \\"We concentrate on one symbolic event – the massacre of the insurgent Jashari family, killed in the hamlet of Prekaz in March 1998 while fighting Serbs troops. This was neither the only massacre nor the worst during the recent conflict...\\"; pp: 515–516. Legacy The exploits of Adem Jashari have been celebrated and turned into legend by former KLA members, some in government, and by Kosovar Albanian society resulting in songs, literature, monuments, memorials with streets and buildings bearing his name across Kosovo... Dubbed the \\"Legendary Commander\\" () by Albanians, Jashari is regarded by many in Kosovo as being the \\"father of the KLA\\". Portraits of him carrying an automatic weapon often adorn the walls of homes inhabited by ethnic Albanians. Considered a symbol of independence by Kosovo Albanians, the anniversary of Jashari's death is annually commemorated in Kosovo and his home has since been transformed into a shrine. The field where he and his family were buried has since become a place of pilgrimage for Kosovo Albanians, and several authors have equated Jashari with Albanian national hero Skanderbeg as well as Albanian kaçak rebels from the past. Following Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008, Jashari was posthumously awarded the title \\"Hero of Kosovo\\" for his role in the Kosovo War. The football stadium in Mitrovica, the National Theatre in Pristina and Pristina International Airport have also been named after him.

It has zip codes of both 15212 and 15214, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 6 (North Shore and Downtown neighborhoods) and District 1 (North Central neighborhoods). Fineview was known to older generations as Nunnery Hill. Its modern name derives from the expansive views of downtown Pittsburgh. The most famous of these views is from the Fineview Overlook at the corner of Catoma and Meadville streets. For older generations, this neighborhood was well known for its locally famous streetcar line (#21 Fineview), and for its incline, known as the Nunnery Hill Incline. This incline was one of two in the city that had a curve in it (the other was the Knoxville Incline on the South Side). The incline started at the present- day intersection of Henderson Street and Federal Street. The curve was located in the area of Henderson Street and Jay Street. The incline ended at the top of the hill, along Meadville Street. The old retaining wall that was built for the incline can still be seen running up the side of Henderson Street. This route ran from 1888 to 1895. Surrounding neighborhoods Fineview has four borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Perry South to the north and west, Central Northside to the southwest, East Allegheny to the south and Spring Hill–City View to the east. City Steps The Fineview neighborhood has 17 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Fineview, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and provide an easy way to travel through this hilly, populated area. Rising Main Way, located in the eastern side of the neighborhood, is the 4th longest flight of city steps in Pittsburgh (331 steps). The flight is open to the public but has suffered structural damage in places due to erosion of the hillside. Since 1995, the Fineview Citizens Council has sponsored the Fineview Steps Challenge, a 5-mile urban steps and trails challenge throughout the neighborhood.

They were used by shepherds and farmers who needed a versatile dog, with few demands, and a dog that was able to adapt to a harsh and meager existence. History =Origins of the Northern European Shepherds= The Dutch Shepherd was discovered as a naturally occurring shepherd's dog type living in the rural areas of the larger region that today includes the Netherlands.Bosch, Bas (2002). The Dutch Breeds, Raad van Beheer Organization, The Netherlands, p. 24. When the first breed standard was written in 1898, the coat could be any colour, but in 1914, it was decided to allow only brindle to distinguish the breed from the then- similar German Shepherd and Belgian Shepherds. The breeds eventually diverged into the six distinct breeds as they are known today. However, the Dutch Shepherd remains nearly the same dog it was more than 100 years ago; it is distinguished from the Belgian Shepherds and German Shepherd by the details specified in the breed standard, primarily of the head. =Function= Originally, the main function of the Dutch Shepherd was that of a shepherd's dog in the countryside. From early times, the Dutch had an arable culture that was maintained by flocks of sheep. The dogs had to keep the flock away from the crops, which they did by patrolling the borders of the roads and fields. They also accompanied the flocks on their way to the common meadows, markets, and ports.Nederlandse Herdershonden Club At the farm, they kept the hens away from the kitchen garden, herded the cows together for milking, and pulled the milk carts. They also alerted the farmers when strangers entered the farmyard. Around 1900, sheep flocks had, for the greater part, disappeared in the Netherlands. The versatile skills of the Dutch Shepherds made them suitable for dog training, which was then starting to become popular. They were then trained and used as police dogs, search and tracking dogs, and guide dogs for the blind. They are, however, still capable of herding sheep. =Near- extinction= The population of the Dutch Shepherd was greatly reduced due to modern farming techniques nearly eliminating the need for the breed as a sheep tender, and in the 1940s and 1950s, the breed was almost exterminated. The Second World War put a stop to breeding of most dog breeds in the Netherlands. Dogs died from lack of food, or were taken to Germany by the German military. Many bloodlines became extinct. After the war, breeding began anew and new blood was needed to diversify the gene pool. Sometimes, dogs of unknown origin were used. The Belgian Malinois was used for a time, but the practice was stopped because the buyers of those puppies did not have the same goals as the Dutch Breed Club. In 1959, with permission from the breed club, a Belgian Laekenois was used to expand the rough-haired variety. With time, the popularity of the breed grew and expanded into other countries. Today, the Dutch Shepherd is still a rare breed. The Dutch Breed Club encourages all owners of dogs meeting the minimum conformation standards to breed them and guidelines are laid out so as to increase their number and diversify the gene pool, while preserving the health of the breed.Fokkerij Reglementen, 1 March 2012  Description  =Appearance= Long-haired Dutch Shepherd Rough- haired Dutch Shepherd The Dutch Shepherd on average weigh between and the height varies between 55–63 cm (approximately 22 to 25 inches tall at the withers). Depending on the coat, the breed can be distinguished as short- haired, long-haired, or rough-haired. Short-haired: All over the body, quite hard, close-fitting, with woolly undercoat. Ruff, breeches and tail plume are clearly visible. Long-haired: All over the body, long, straight, well-fitting, harsh to the touch, without curls or waves and with a woolly undercoat. Distinct ruff and breeches. Tail abundantly coated. Head, ears and feet and also the hind legs below the hocks are short and densely coated. The backsides of the forelegs show a strongly developed coat, shortening in length towards the feet, the so-called feathering. No fringes at the ears. Rough-haired: Dense, harsh tousled coat and a woolly, dense undercoat all over the body except for the head. Upper and lower lip should be well-covered with hair, the whiskers and beard, and two well-defined, coarse rough eyebrows that are distinct but not exaggerated. Furnishings are not soft. The hair on the skull and on the cheeks is less strongly developed. In profile it seems as if the head has a more square appearance. Strongly developed breeches are desirable. Tail is covered all round with hair. The brindle colour may be less pronounced because of the tousled coat. =Colour= Brindle: The basic colour is golden or silver and can vary from a near-white, light sand-colour to chestnut red. A \\"true silver brindle\\" is very rare, because having too much white is considered a fault. The brindle is clearly present all over the body, in the ruff, breeches, and tail. Too much black is undesirable. A black mask is preferable. Heavy white markings on the chest or feet are not desirable. Temperament Dutch Shepherds are loyal, reliable, alert, watchful, active, independent, intelligent, and intuitive. Obedience and discipline can be achieved with remarkable results. Gifted with a true shepherding temperament, they can supposedly work willingly together with their owners and can deal independently with any task they are assigned, being neither aggressive nor shy. They have a strong character and independence passed down from their herding ancestry. Health The Dutch Breed Club initiated a hotline in 2008 for reporting health and behavioral problems. Most genetic health problems occur at a low rate in this breed. Confirmed genetic diseases diagnosed in Dutch Shepherds include allergies (atopy), masticatory myositis, pannus, cryptorchidism and inflammatory bowel disease. Within the rough-haired variety care should be taken to screen for goniodysplasia before breeding. This is a condition where the outflow of fluid from the eye is restricted and under certain circumstances can cause blindness. The link between genetics and goniodysplasia is uncertain. Two dogs who have a risk of goniodysplasia can still have puppies who are not at risk. The Dutch Breed Club regulations requires the testing for GD for rough-hairs. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals reports hip dysplasia is present at an overall rate of 8.1 percent on 432 dogs evaluated from Jan. 1974 through Dec. 2018 and elbow dysplasia is present at a rate of 4.3 percent on 329 dogs evaluated from Jan. 1974 through Dec. 2018. A previously unknown inflammatory and necrotizing myopathy affecting Dutch Shepherds was genetically mapped in 2018 by the University of Minnesota Canine Genetics Laboratory who identifies this disease as IM: Inflammatory Myopathy (Myositis). The disease causes progressive, painful inflammation of skeletal muscle tissue. The first symptoms of the disease, which usually present between three and eight months of age, include a “bunny hopping” gait and rear leg stiffness, then, it escalates to include muscle tremors, progressive weakness and severe muscle atrophy. The Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of AmericaDutch Shepherd Dog Club of America financed genetic research to analyze and interpret molecular information to identify this disease, which was spearheaded by Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America veterinary counsel Karen Wroblewski DVM. Dr. Wroblewski orchestrated a nationwide collaboration of veterinary professionals, breeders and Dutch Shepherd fanciers resulting in the description of this new condition, discovery of the causative mutated gene, definition of the mode of inheritance (autosomal recessive), and now, availability of a new DNA screening test available through University of Minnesota. The UMN College of Veterinary Medicine has updated their Canine Genetic Testing webpage to include submission forms and instructions for submitting samples for Dutch Shepherd Inflammatory Myopathy testing to identify carriers of the disease. Both parents must be carriers to produce affected offspring, but as long as one of the two parents is IM clear, affected offspring will NOT be produced.UMN College of Veterinary Medicine Inflammatory Myopathy testing The University of Minnesota Canine Genetics Laboratory has also coordinated with the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals to have the IM test results listed on the OFA website. Grooming The short-haired variety needs occasional combing, with the exception during the shedding period in the spring and fall when a daily thorough brushing is needed. The long-haired variety needs to be groomed about once a week, or more frequently depending on work and environment. The rough- hair variety needs to be thoroughly brushed once a week, and twice a year the dead hair will need to be hand stripped. Activities Dutch Shepherds are an active and versatile breed. They compete in dog agility, obedience, rally obedience, flyball, dock jumping, disc dog, tracking, search and rescue, nosework, and weight pulling, along with protection sports such as Schutzhund, French Ring, Belgian Ring, mondioring, PSA, and others. In the Netherlands, they are still employed as herders and this instinct is still strong in the breed. Internationally, the Dutch Shepherd is best known for use in law enforcement under the KNPV program. The Koninklijke Nederlandse Politiehond Vereniging (KNPV), or Royal Dutch Policedog Association, was founded 27 October 1907, as an organization to oversee and test dogs for their suitability for police work. Dutch Shepherds with KNPV titles are sought-after candidates throughout the world for police and military use, as well as sport competitors and personal-protection dogs. The KNPV began a dog registration program in 2014 for KNPV member dogs, making registration mandatory for all dogs born after 1 April 2013.KNPV Registration Registry =FCI= The Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) is an overseeing entity for many international purebred dog breed registries, including the Dutch Kennel Club (Raad van Beheer). The FCI itself is not a registry and does not issue pedigrees; instead, the FCI has 90 members and contract partners (one member per country) that each issues its own pedigrees and trains itsr own judges. The 'owner' countries of the breeds write the breed standards that are used as reference for judges at shows held in FCI member countries. Some member countries have an open studbook by which dogs can be registered based on appearance, and other FCI member countries have closed studbooks. The Dutch studbooks were closed on 1 February 1971. The goal of the FCI is, in part, ‘to protect the use, the keeping, and the breeding of purebred dogs in the countries where the FCI has a member or a contract partner’.FCI Statutes The United States of America is not an FCI member or contract partner.FCI Members =The Dutch Shepherd in the United States= The kennel club of registry for the Dutch Shepherd in the United States is the United Kennel Club, having first published their breed standard on 1 January 1995. Established in 1898, the United Kennel Club is the largest all-breed, performance-dog registry in the world, registering dogs from all 50 U.S. states and 25 foreign countries. More than 60% of its nearly 16,000 annually licensed events are tests of hunting ability, training, and instinct.About UKC UKC-registered Dutch Shepherds successfully compete in conformation, obedience, agility, rally, weight pull, nosework, dock jumping, lure coursing, and previously in protection/police dog events through the now-defunct Dog Sport program.UKC Archives The Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of AmericaDutch Shepherd Dog Club of America UKC Provisional National Breed Club reveals that the UKC reflects 1,629 permanently registered Dutch Shepherds in their archives, but indicates the number of active (under the age of 12) Dutch Shepherds totals 1,167 dogs (as of 31 December 2018). As of 2012, the Dutch Shepherd is being recorded by the American Kennel Club in their Foundation Stock Service, accepting pedigrees from some FCI members as eligibility, but declining membership to dogs with pedigrees from certain other FCI member countries. FSS breeds are not eligible for AKC registration, but once individually registered under the FSS program, a Dutch Shepherd is able to compete in the AKC companion events of obedience, tracking, agility, and rally.FSS Breeds The American Dutch Shepherd Association states they maintain a listing of the dogs registered in the American Kennel Club's FSS database and in 2017 reflected a total of 230 Dutch Shepherds registered in the U.S. and Canada.About ADSA The American Kennel Club board of directors voted their approval on 16 January 2016 of moving the Dutch Shepherd to the Miscellaneous Class effective 1 January 2017 and has designated the American Dutch Shepherd Association as the AKC Parent Club for the breed.AKC Jan 2016 Minutes References Further reading * http://www.hollandseherder.nl/ * http://www.raadvanbeheer.nl/en/registration- and-ordering/how-to-order-the-book-dutch-breeds/ External links * Breed clubs **Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America - UKC National Breed Club ** Working Dutch Shepherd Association of America ** American Dutch Shepherd Association ** Dutch breed club – Nederlandse Herdershonden Club **Dutch Shepherd Dog Breed Information Dog breeds originating in the Netherlands FCI breeds Herding dogs ","title":"Dutch Shepherd"},{"id":"2966044","title":"Ponette"},{"id":"2966050","text":"Edward Franciszek Szczepanik (; 22 August 1915 – 11 October 2005) was a Polish economist and the last Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile.Website of the Polish Prime Minister shows Edward Szczepanik (1986–1990) as the last Polish Prime Minister of the II Republic in exile (Polish Premierzy II Rzeczypospolitej na wychodźstwie) followed by the Prime Minister of the III Republic (Polish Premierzy III Rzeczypospolitej)  Biography  Szczepanik was born on 22 August 1915 in Suwałki, a small town in northern Poland, while the country was part of Imperial Russia under German occupation. =Early life= Kościuszko street, Suwałki. Edward lived in Kościuszko street, he went to the local grammar school and then studied at the Warsaw School of Economics (SGH). He studied for his MSc in political economy under Professor Edward Lipiński in 1936. During his compulsory military service he was stationed at the Artillery Officers' School with the 29th Light Artillery Regiment. He won a scholarship to study at the London School of Economics, studying under Professors Lionel Robbins, Friedrich Hayek and Paul Narcyz Rosenstein-Rodan. On his return he became an assistant in Lipiński's department in SGH.

On 7 April 1986 he was chosen the successor of Kazimierz Sabbat to be the next Prime Minister of that government. After Sabbat's death, his successor as the president of Poland in exile, Ryszard Kaczorowski, asked him to continue with his mission, which ended in 1990. This is when Szczepanik's cabinet advised their last President in Exile to accept the invitation of Poland's Speaker of the Senate to transfer the Flag and other Office pre-war Insignia to Lech Wałęsa in Warsaw, as the \\"President of the Republic elected by Polish people in free general elections\\". =Polish honours= St. Alexander's Church, Suwałki. Szczepanik was honoured to be named a Knight of the Order of Polonia Restituta by the Polish Government in Exile in 1981. In 1982 he obtained the freedom of his native town Suwałki as its honorary citizen. The President of the Republic of Poland in London awarded him with a Commander's Star in 1985, to which a Grand Sash was added in 1989. He was awarded the title of Doctor of Economic Science – Honoris Causa in 1995 by the Warsaw School of Economics. In 1996, Szczepanik received from the starost (mayor) of Powiat of Suwałki the Medal for Merits to the Powiat of Suwałki; and from Poland's Minister of Culture, the Medal for Merits to Polish Culture. Szczepanik died on 11 October 2005 in Worcestershire.

Originally it applied to the whole Empire of the Franks, extending from southern France to eastern Germany. Modern France is still called Frankreich in German and similar names in some other Germanic languages (such as Frankrijk in Dutch), which means \\"Frank Reich\\", the Realm of the Franks. Background =Gaul= Celtic Gallia and Roman republic in 58 BC. Before being named France, the land was called Gaul (; ). This name continued to be used even after the beginning of the reign of the Franks' Kings Clovis I, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne. In fact, for as long as the cultural elites of Europe used Latin predominantly, the name Gallia continued to be used alongside the name France. In English usage, the words Gaul and Gaulish are used synonymously with Latin Gallia, Gallus and Gallicus. However the similarity of the names is probably coincidental; the English words are borrowed from French Gaule and Gaulois, which appear to have been borrowed themselves from Germanic walha-, the usual word for the non-Germanic-speaking peoples (Celtic-speaking and Latin-speaking indiscriminately) and the source for Welsh in English. The Germanic w is regularly rendered as gu / g in French (cf. guerre = war, garder = ward, Guillaume = William), and the diphthong au is the regular outcome of al before a following consonant (cf. cheval ~ chevaux). Gaule or Gaulle can hardly be derived from Latin Gallia, since g would become j before a (cf. gamba > jambe), and the diphthong au would be incomprehensible; the regular outcome of Latin Gallia would have been * Jaille in French.[3][4] Today, in modern French, the word Gaule is only used in a historical context. The only current use of the word is in the title of the leader of the French bishops, the archbishop of Lyon, whose official title is Primate of the Gauls (Primat des Gaules). Gaul is in the plural in the title, reflecting the three Gallic entities identified by the Romans (Celtica, Belgica, and Aquitania). The adjective gaulois (Gallic) is still sometimes used when a French person wants to stress some idiosyncrasies of the French people entrenched in history, such as nos ancêtres les Gaulois (\\"our ancestors the Gauls\\"), a phrase sometimes used in French when one wants to assert his own identity. During the Third Republic, the authorities often referred to notre vieille nation gauloise (\\"our old Gallic nation\\"), a case in which the adjective gaulois is used with a positive connotation. The word gallicisme is used sometimes in linguistic to express a specific form to the French language. In English, the word Gaul is never used in a modern context. The adjective Gallic is sometimes used to refer to French people, occasionally in a derisive and critical way, such as \\"Gallic pride\\". The Coq Gaulois (Gallic rooster in English) is also a national symbol of France, as for the French Football Federation. Astérix le Gaulois (Asterix, the Gaul) is a popular series of French comic books, following the exploits of a village of indomitable Gauls. In Greek, France is still known as Γαλλία (Gallia). =Francia= French franc coin (1360) of Charles V, with inscription Francorum Rex (\\"King of the Franks\\") Burial of Clovis I, King of the Franks, at the Basilica of St Denis near Paris Under the reign of the Franks' Kings Clovis I, Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne, a country that included most of modern France and modern Germany was known as Kingdom of Franks or Francia. At the Treaty of Verdun in 843, the Frankish Empire was divided in three parts : West Francia (Francia Occidentalis), Middle Francia and East Francia (Francia Orientalis). The rulers of Francia Orientalis, who soon claimed the imperial title and wanted to reunify the Frankish Empire, dropped the name Francia Orientalis and called their realm the Holy Roman Empire (see History of Germany). The kings of Francia Occidentalis successfully opposed this claim and managed to preserve Francia Occidentalis as an independent kingdom, distinct from the Holy Roman Empire. The Battle of Bouvines in 1214 definitively marked the end of the efforts by the Holy Roman Empire to reunify the old Frankish Empire by conquering France. Since the name Francia Orientalis had disappeared, there arose the habit to refer to Francia Occidentalis as Francia only, from which the word France is derived. The French state has been in continuous existence since 843 (except for a brief interruption in 885–887), with an unbroken line of heads of states since the first king of Francia Occidentalis (Charles the Bald) to the current president of the French Republic (Emmanuel Macron). Notably, in German, France is still called Frankreich, which literally means \\"Reich (empire) of the Franks\\". In order to distinguish it from the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, France is called Frankreich, while the Frankish Empire is called Frankenreich. The name of the Franks itself is said to come from the Proto-Germanic word *frankon which means \\"javelin, lance\\". Another proposed etymology is that Frank means \\"the free men\\", based on the fact that the word frank meant \\"free\\" in the ancient Germanic languages. However, rather than the ethnic name of the Franks coming from the word frank (\\"free\\"), it is more probable that the word frank (\\"free\\") comes from the ethnic name of the Franks, the connection being that only the Franks, as the conquering class, had the status of freemen. In a tradition going back to the 7th-century Chronicle of Fredegar, the name of the Franks itself is taken from Francio, one of the Germanic kings of Sicambri, c. 61 BCE, whose dominion extended all along those lands immediately joining the west-bank of the Rhine River, as far as Strasbourg and Belgium.David Solomon Ganz, Tzemach David, part 2, Warsaw 1859, p. 9b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: Cemach Dawid; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, Fredegar and the History of France, University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536–538 This nation is also explicitly mentioned by Julius Caesar in his Notebooks on the Gallic War (Commentarii de Bello Gallico). The name of the former French currency, the franc, comes from the words engraved on the coins of the Frankish King, Rex Francorum, meaning \\"King of the Franks\\" or \\"Roi des Francs\\" in French. =France= In most of the Latin languages, France is known by the word \\"France\\" or any of its derivatives, for example Francia in Italian and Spanish. In most of the Germanic languages, France is known as the historical \\"Land of the Franks\\", for example Frankreich (Reich of the Franks) in German, Frankrijk (Rijk of the Franks) in Dutch, Frankrike (Rike of the Franks) in Swedish and Norwegian, Frankrig in Danish. Meanings of the name France The name \\"France\\" (and its adjective \\"French\\") can have four different meanings which it is important to distinguish in order to avoid ambiguities. Its origin is the Germanic word \\"frank\\" which means \\"free\\" and is also a male name. =Political meaning= In a first meaning, \\"France\\" means the whole French Republic. In that case, \\"French\\" refers to the nationality, as it is written on the French ID card: \\"Nationalité : française\\". The etymology and meaning of the word \\"France\\" and \\"French\\" have had strong bearings in the abolition of slavery and serfdom in France. Indeed, in 1315, king Louis X issued an edict reaffirming that slavery was illegal in France by proclaiming that \\"France signifies freedom\\", that any slave setting foot on (metropolitan) French ground should be freed. Centuries later, this decree served as the basis for a group of crusading lawyers at the parlement of Paris, many of whom were members of the Society of the Friends of the Blacks, winning unprecedented emancipation rights in a series of cases before the French revolution, which (temporarily) led to the complete abolition of slavery on French overseas territories and colonies in 1794 David B. Gaspar, David P. Geggus, A Turbulent time: the French Revolution and the Greater Caribbean (1997) p. 60 until Napoleon, propped up by the plantation lobbies, re-introduced slavery in sugarcane-growing colonies.Hobhouse, Henry. Seeds of Change: Six Plants That Transformed Mankind, 2005. Page 111. =Geographical meaning= In a second meaning, \\"France\\" refers to metropolitan France only, meaning mainland France. =Historical meanings= In a third meaning, \\"France\\" refers specifically to the province of Île-de- France (with Paris at its centre) which historically was the heart of the royal demesne. This meaning is found in some geographic names, such as French Brie (Brie française) and French Vexin (Vexin français). French Brie, the area where the famous Brie cheese is produced, is the part of Brie that was annexed to the royal demesne, as opposed to Champagne Brie (Brie champenoise) which was annexed by Champagne. Likewise, French Vexin was the part of Vexin inside Île-de-France, as opposed to Norman Vexin (Vexin normand) which was inside Normandy. This meaning is also found in the name of the French language (langue française), whose literal meaning is \\"language of Île-de-France\\". It is not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the language of Île-de-France indeed became the language of the whole country France. In modern French, the French language is called le français, while the old language of Île-de-France is called by the name applied to it according to a 19th-century theory on the origin of the French language – le francien. In a fourth meaning, \\"France\\" refers only to the Pays de France, one of the many pays (Latin: pagi, singular pagus) of Île-de-France. French provinces are traditionally made up of several pays, which are the direct continuation of the pagi set up by the Roman administration during Antiquity. The province of Île-de-France is thus made up of several pays: Pays de France, Parisis, Hurepoix, French Vexin, and so on. Pays de France is the extremely fertile plain located immediately north of Paris which supported one of the most productive agriculture during the Middle Ages and was responsible for the tremendous wealth of the kingdom of France before the Hundred Years' War, making possible the emergence of the Gothic art and architecture which spread all over western Europe. Pays de France is also called Plaine de France (i.e. \\"Plain of France\\"). Its historic main town is Saint-Denis, where the first gothic cathedral in the world was built in the 12th century, and inside which the kings of France are buried. Pays de France is now almost entirely built up, being but the northern extension of the Paris suburbs. This fourth meaning is found in many place names, such as the town of Roissy-en-France, on whose territory is located Charles de Gaulle Airport. The name of the town literally means \\"Roissy in the Pays de France\\", and not \\"Roissy in the country France\\". Another example of the use of France in this meaning is the new Stade de France, which was built near Saint-Denis for the 1998 Football World Cup. It was decided to call the stadium after the Pays de France, to give it a local touch. In particular, the mayor of Saint-Denis made it very clear that he wanted the new stadium to be a stadium of the northern suburbs of Paris and not just a national stadium which happens to be located in the northern suburbs. The name is intended to reflect this, although few French people know this story and the great majority associates it with the country's name. Other names for France In Hebrew, France is called (Tzarfat). In Māori, France is known as Wīwī, derived from the French phrase oui, oui (yes, yes).Matras Y., Sakel J.

She is older than her twin sister, Lisa by one minute. Their older brother, Julian Origliasso, is a music manager who manages their duo The Veronicas. They were raised in Albany Creek, Queensland, and attended both Ferny Grove State High School, and Wavell State High School. The Origliasso sisters began their career at the age of five, performing at awards shows and sporting events as the Origliasso Twins, changing their name to \\"Lisa & Jessica\\" in their teen years, under which they released three albums. At age sixteen, Lisa and Jessica ventured into acting, being cast in a small role in the children's television series Cybergirl, as villains Emerald and Sapphire Buxton, respectively. In 2003, they formed another band with two of their friends called Teal and released a single called \\"Baby It's Over\\". =2004-09: The Veronicas= Lisa and Jessica impressed music executive Hayden Bell with their demo tracks, and were signed to Excalibur Productions Australia as songwriters in 2004. After being signed to Sydney based independent record label Engine Room Recordings, they received funding to travel the world to write and record demos with other songwriters. During this trip, they co-wrote songs that would be released by other artists, including: \\"What's Going On?\\" by Casey Donovan, \\"All About Us\\" by t.A.T.u. and \\"Faded\\" by Kate DeAraugo (also covered by Cascada). By the end of 2004 they travelled to America and signed with Sire Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music for a deal worth $2 million. Taking their name from a line in the film Heathers (1988), they called themselves The Veronicas. However the name was also connected to the Archie Comics character Veronica Lodge, leading to the owners suing them for trademark infringement, but resulted in a settlement which included the sisters appearing in the comics. The following year, they released their debut album The Secret Life of... (2005), which spawned their first major hit \\"4ever\\" peaking at number two on the ARIA Singles Chart and certified platinum, denoting 70,000 copies shipped in Australia. The album sold almost half a million copies worldwide and earned them an ARIA Award for Best Pop Release. In 2007 they released their second album Hook Me Up and its eponymous single scored them their first number one hit on the ARIA Charts and was certified platinum. The following single, \\"Untouched\\" became their global breakthrough song, reaching the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 charts, and the top twenty in seven other countries, including number one in Ireland.\\"The Veronicas - Untouched - Music Charts\\". αCharts.us. Retrieved 21 July 2012. It went on to be certified platinum in the United States, with over one million digital downloads. They embarked on the Revenge Is Sweeter tour, their first to go global, which began in February 2009 and ended December. After concluding the tour, Lisa and Jessica decided to take time off from the group. Having promoted their second album since 2007, they were \\"ready to move on\\" wanting to \\"discover whether they could create separately as well as individually.\\" =2010–present: Album delays and The Veronicas= Jessica reunited with Lisa after their break in 2010 to begin working on The Veronicas third studio album. Their record label, Warner Music, went through major restructuring during this time which caused delays in releasing new music. Wanting to keep fans updated with the progress of their new work, they performed a set at The Viper Room in 2011. Months after this performance, in 2012, The Veronicas finally revealed that they would release a new song called \\"Lolita\\" for their new album, which was known as Life on Mars at the time. The single reached number twenty three on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified gold. Life on Mars was to be released by the end of 2012, however, Warner Music pushed the date back to early 2013, and eventually the record was shelved altogether. Because of this, Lisa and Jessica hired a lawyer in a bid to get out of their contractual obligations with the label and were successful, so by 2013 The Veronicas became an independent act. In April 2014, The Veronicas were signed to Sony Music and began putting the finishing touches on their third album, which was renamed The Veronicas. The first single from the album, \\"You Ruin Me\\", debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart, becoming their first number-one hit in the country since \\"Hook Me Up\\" in 2007. It stayed at the apex of the chart for three consecutive weeks and was certified double platinum. The Veronicas released various singles in 2016 and 2017, In My Blood, On Your Side and The Only High. Later released single Think of Me in May 2019 and a reality TV show for MTV later on that year. In 2019, Origliasso and her sister Lisa admitted taking legal action against Qantas airlines after a dispute occurred. Criticisms included that the dispute was a publicity stunt which the artists denied. Personal life Origliasso was in a relationship with Ruby Rose in 2008. She entered into a relationship with Smashing Pumpkins singer and songwriter Billy Corgan from 2010 to 2012; the two remained friends afterward. She dated Badflower guitarist Josh Katz from 2014 to 2016, and started dating Rose again in November 2016. Dating Rose deepened Origliasso's passion for marriage equality. \\"When I did the speech for the last marriage-equality rally I was dating a boy,\\" she stated. \\"I remember writing the speech thinking that I'm treated as a fully equal citizen.

Their older brother, Julian Origliasso, is a music manager who manages their duo The Veronicas. The family was raised in Albany Creek, Queensland, and attended both Ferny Grove State High School and Wavell State High School. The Origliasso sisters began their career at the age of five, performing at awards shows and sporting events as the Origliasso Twins, changing their name to \\"Lisa & Jessica\\" in their teen years, under which they released three albums. At age sixteen, Lisa and Jessica ventured into acting, being cast in a small role in the children's television series Cybergirl, as villains Emerald and Sapphire Buxton, respectively. In 2003, they formed another band with two of their friends called Teal and released a single called \\"Baby It's Over\\". =2004–09: The Veronicas and Dead Cool Dropouts= Lisa and Jessica impressed music executive Hayden Bell with their demo tracks and were signed to Excalibur Productions Australia as songwriters in 2004. After being signed to Sydney-based independent record label Engine Room Recordings, they received funding to travel around the world to write and record demos with other songwriters. During this trip, they co-wrote songs that would go on to be released by other artists, including: \\"What's Going On?\\" by Casey Donovan, \\"All About Us\\" by t.A.T.u. and \\"Faded\\" by Kate DeAraugo (also covered by Cascada). By the end of 2004 they travelled to America and signed with Sire Records, a subsidiary of Warner Music for a deal worth $2 million. Taking their name from a line in the film Heathers (1988), they called themselves The Veronicas. However the name was also connected to the Archie Comics character Veronica Lodge, leading to the owners suing them for trademark infringement, but resulted in a settlement which included the sisters appearing in the comics. The following year, they released their debut album, The Secret Life of...

Their record label, Warner Music, went through major restructuring during this time which caused delays in releasing new music. Wanting to keep fans updated with the progress of their new work, they performed a set at The Viper Room in 2011. Months after this performance, in 2012, the Veronicas finally revealed that they would release a new song called \\"Lolita\\" for their new album, which was known as Life on Mars at the time. The single reached number twenty three on the ARIA Singles Chart and was certified gold. Life on Mars was to be released by the end of 2012; however, Warner Music pushed the date back to early 2013, and eventually the record was shelved altogether. Because of this, Lisa and Jessica hired a lawyer in a bid to get out of their contractual obligations with the label and were successful, so by 2013 the Veronicas became an independent act. In April 2014, the Veronicas were signed to Sony Music and began putting the finishing touches on their third album, which was renamed The Veronicas. The first single from the album, \\"You Ruin Me\\", debuted atop the ARIA Singles Chart, becoming their first number-one hit in the country since \\"Hook Me Up\\" in 2007.

Biography  La Villemarqué was born in Quimperlé, Finistère on 6 July 1815. He was descended from an old Breton family, which counted among its members a Hersart who had followed Saint Louis to the Crusades, and another who was a companion in arms of Du Guesclin. La Villemarqué devoted himself to the elucidation of the monuments of Breton literature. Introduced in 1851 by Jakob Grimm as correspondent to the Academy of Berlin, he became in 1858 a member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He died at Castle Keransker near Quimperlé on 8 December 1895. Works His works include: Contes populaires des anciens Bretons (1842), to which was prefixed an essay on the origin of the romances of the Round Table; Essai sur l'histoire de la langue bretonne (1837); Poèmes des bardes bretons du sixième siècle (1850); La Légende celtique en Irlande, en Cambrie et en Bretagne (1859). The popular Breton songs published by him in 1839 as Barzaz Breiz were considerably retouched. La Villemarqué's work has been superseded by the work of later scholars, but he has the merit of having done much to arouse popular interest in his subject.

Clichés and their critique Concerning values, Japanese politics are generally described as pragmatic, limited by particularistic loyalties, and based on human relations rather than on ideology or principles. The quintessential Japanese leader is a network builder rather than the embodiment of charisma or ideals; more like the crafty and resourceful founder of the Tokugawa bakufu, Tokugawa Ieyasu, than the ruthless but heroic Oda Nobunaga. Such political dynamics are evident, for example, in the workings of the LDP, which has remained the strongest party since 1955 despite their 3-year loss of majority control in the early 1990s. The pragmatic, personalistic view of politics cannot explain Japan's militaristic past, the political crises of the 1960s, the controversies surrounding the emperor, Article 9, or the unwillingness of many in the Social Democratic Party of Japan, despite a huge political cost, to abandon their antiwar and revolutionary commitment in the early 1990s. It also fails to account for the apparently sincerely held ideological beliefs of the wartime period. The \\"New Order in Greater East Asia\\" was legitimized on the basis of universal principles, such as \\"Pan-Asianism,\\" \\"international justice,\\" and \\"permanent peace,\\" even if the results were quite the opposite. The non- ideological nature of mainstream Japanese politics in the postwar period reflects defeat in war, the failure after 1945 to find a national ideological consensus to replace discredited wartime beliefs, and the commitment of both elite and ordinary Japanese to expanding the economy and raising living standards. As these goals were attained, a complacent, largely apolitical \\"middle mass society\\" (a term coined by economist Murakami Yasusuke) emerged, in which 90 percent of the people in opinion polls consistently classified themselves as \\"middle class.\\" Community and leadership Certain distinctive features of Japanese politics can be identified, although this is not to say that they are unique to Japan. Rather, qualities also found in other political systems, such as the importance of personal connections and consensus building, played an extraordinarily important role in Japanese politics. These features have deep historical roots and reflect values that pervade the society as a whole. In both the feudal and the modern eras, a major problem for Japanese political leaders has been reconciling the goals of community survival and the welfare and self-respect of individuals in an environment of extreme scarcity. In recent centuries, Japan lacked the natural resources and space to accommodate its population comfortably. With the exception of Hokkaidō and colonial territories in Asia between 1895 and 1945, there was no \\"frontier\\" to absorb excess people. One solution was to ignore the welfare of large sectors of the population (peasants and workers) and to use force when they expressed their discontent. Such coercive measures, common during both the Tokugawa and the World War II periods, largely, although not entirely, disappeared in the postwar \\"welfare state\\" (for example, farmers were evicted from their land to construct the New Tokyo International Airport at Narita Sanrizuka in the 1970s after long negotiations had failed). But non-coercive, or mostly non-coercive, methods of securing popular compliance had developed to an extraordinary degree in social and political life. The most important such method is the promotion of a strong sense of community consciousness and group solidarity. Japanese individuals are often characterized as having a strong sense of self-sacrifice and community dedication (see Japanese values). Historians and sociologists note that both traditional and modern Japanese communities—the buraku, the feudal domain with its retinue of samurai, the large commercial houses found in Edo (the future Tokyo), Osaka, and Kyoto before 1868, and modern corporations and bureaucracies with their cohorts of lifetime employees—have striven to be all-inclusive. Such groups serve a variety of functions for the individual, providing not only income and sustenance but also emotional support and individual identity. Japanese called such community inclusiveness the \\"octopus-pot way of life\\" (takotsubo seikatsu). Large pots with narrow openings at the top are used by fishermen to capture octopuses, and the term is used to refer to people so wrapped up in their particular social group that they cannot see the world outside its confines. The \\"group consciousness\\" model of Japanese social life, however, has been overstressed at times. A person may often go along with group demands because they serve self-interest in the long run (for example, political contributions may help secure future favors from those in office). Historically, democratic concepts of individual rights and limited government have been deeply appealing because they, too, promise protection of individual autonomy. Despite very different ethical and political traditions, the Japanese people were very receptive to imported liberal ideas both before and after 1945. John Stuart Mill's essay On Liberty, for example, was extremely popular during the Meiji era. Because individual, usually passive, resistance to group demands occurs, Japanese leaders have found the creation of a strong community sense to be a difficult and time-consuming task. Harmony (wa), that most prized social value, is not easily attained. One mechanism for achieving wa is the use of rituals to develop a psychological sense of group identity. Political parties and factions, the offices of national and local governments, businesses, university departments, research groups, alumni associations, and other groups sponsor frequent ceremonies and more informal parties for this purpose. A group's history and identity are carefully constructed through the use of songs and symbols (often resembling, in miniature, the Meiji government's creation of symbols of kokutai in the late nineteenth century). Often, an organization's founder, especially if deceased, is regarded as something of a Confucian sage or a Shinto kami (deity). Group members, however, may find that pervasive ritualism allows them to \\"go through the motions\\" (such as the chanting of banzai! (ten thousand years!) at the end of political rallies, without having to make a deeper commitment to the group. A second mechanism to promote community solidarity is the building of hierarchical relationships. In this practice, the influence of premodern ethics is readily apparent. In what anthropologist Nakane Chie calls Japan's \\"vertical society,\\" human relationships are defined in terms of inequality, and people relate to each other as superiors and inferiors along a minutely differentiated gradient of social status, not only within bureaucratic organizations, where it might be expected, but also in academic, artistic, and, especially, political worlds. Hierarchy expresses itself along two dimensions: first, an internal community differentiation of rank by seniority, education, and occupational status; and second, the distinction between \\"insiders\\" and \\"outsiders,\\" between members and nonmembers of the community, along with the ranking of whole groups or communities along a vertical continuum. Although internal hierarchy can cause alienation as inferiors chafe under the authority of their superiors, the external kind of hierarchy tends to strengthen group cohesion as individual members work to improve their group's relative ranking. The Japanese nation as a whole has been viewed as a single group by its people in relation to other nations. Intense nationalism has frequently been a manifestation of group members' desire to \\"catch up and overtake\\" the advanced (\\"superior\\") nations of the West, while the rights of non-Western nations, like China or Korea, often viewed as \\"inferior,\\" have been ignored. Like group consciousness, however, the theme of hierarchy has been overstressed. Contemporary Japanese politics show a strong consciousness of equality, and even traditional communities, such as rural villages, were often egalitarian rather than hierarchical. Citizens' movements of the 1960s and 1970s differed from older political organizations in their commitment to promoting intragroup democracy. In addressing the nation, Emperor Akihito used colloquial Japanese terms that stressed equality, rather than the formal, hierarchy-laden language of his predecessors. Two mechanisms for lessening the hierarchy-generated tensions are the seniority principle and early retirement. As men or women grow older, gaining seniority within an organization, they acquire authority and higher status. The seniority principle is reinforced by the traditional reluctance to place younger persons in positions of authority over older ones. The institution of early retirement (top-ranked businesspeople and bureaucrats commonly retired at age fifty-five or sixty) helps to the keep the promotion of others smooth and predictable. The system also helps to enable talented individuals to succeed to the most responsible positions and prevents a small group of older persons (what the Japanese call \\"one-man leaders\\") from monopolizing leadership positions and imposing increasingly outmoded ideas on the organization. Elite retirees, however, often continue to wield influence as advisers and usually pursue second careers in organizations affiliated with the one from which they retired. (see Elderly people in Japan) The circulation of elites that results from the seniority and early retirement principles ensures that everyone within the upper ranks of the hierarchy has a turn at occupying a high-status position, such as a cabinet post in the national government. This principle, in turn, enables people to reward their followers. There has been, for example, a regular turnover of LDP leaders. No individual has served as party president (and prime minister) longer than Sato Eisaku, the incumbent between 1964 and 1972. The average tenure of party presidents / prime ministers between 1964 and 1987 was slightly more than three years. Frequent cabinet reshuffling meant that the average tenure of other cabinet ministers in the same period was a little less than a year. Japan has not been beset with leaders in their seventies and eighties unwilling to give up their powerful positions. Another mechanism reducing intragroup tensions is the strong personal, rather than legalistic or ideological, ties between superior and subordinate. These ties are typically characterized in terms of fictive familial relationships, analogous to the bonds between parents and children (the oyabun-kobun relationship). The ideal leader is viewed as a paternalistic one, with a warm and personal concern for the welfare of his followers. For followers, loyalty is both morally prescribed and emotionally sustained by the system. In the political world, oyabun-kobun relationships are pervasive despite the formal commitment to universalistic, democratic values. At the same time, younger people find such relationships less appealing than their elders. The so-called shinjinrui (new human beings), born in the affluent 1960s and 1970s, were often criticized by older Japanese for being self-absorbed, egoistic, and \\"cool.\\" The younger generation is inclined to view with disdain the emotional expression of paternalistic ties, such as in the 1989 television broadcasts of former Prime Minister Tanaka Kakuei's supporters weeping profusely over his political retirement. Consensus building The community is often demanding, but it is also fragile, because social ties are sustained not only through legal norms and common self-interest but also through the affective patron- client relationship. Open conflict poses a danger to the survival of this sort of community, and thus policy making requires elaborate consultation and consensus building, usually involving all the parties concerned in order to maintain wa (和), the notion of harmony within a group. According to political scientist Lewis Austin, \\"everyone must be consulted informally, everyone must be heard, but not in such a way that the hearing of different opinions develops into opposition. The leader and his assistants \`harmonize opinion'... in advance, using go-betweens to avert the confrontation of opposing forces.\\" After a preliminary agreement among all has been reached, a formal meeting is held in which the agreed-upon policy will be proposed and adopted. This process is called nemawashi (root trimming or binding), evoking the image of a gardener preparing a tree or shrub for transplanting, that is, a change in policy. Austin points out that a common Japanese verb meaning \\"to decide\\" (matomeru) literally means to gather or bring together. Decisions are \\"the sum of the contributions of all.\\" Although consensus building is, for leaders, a time-consuming and emotionally exhausting process, it is necessary not only to promote group goals but also to respect and protect individual autonomy. In fact, the process represents reconciliation of the two. In the political system as a whole, most groups play some role in the nemawashi process. Exceptions are those groups or individuals, such as Koreans or other minority groups, who are viewed as outsiders. Political leaders have to maintain solidarity and harmony within a single group and also secure the cooperation of different groups who are often in bitter conflict. Takotsubo seikatsu can promote destructive sectionalism. During World War II, rivalry between the Imperial Army and the Imperial Navy was so intense that it was nearly impossible to coordinate their strategic operations. In the postwar political system, prime ministers have often been unable to persuade different ministries, all self-sufficient and intensely jealous \\"kingdoms,\\" to go along with reforms in such areas as trade liberalization. Observers such as journalist Karel van Wolferen, have concluded that Japan's political system is empty at the center, lacking real leadership or a locus of responsibility: \\"Statecraft in Japan is quite different from that in the rest of Asia, Europe, and the Americas. For centuries it has entailed the preservation of a careful balance of semiautonomous groups that share power… These semiautonomous components, each endowed with great discretionary powers, are not represented in one central ruling body.\\" This view is probably exaggerated. Leadership in other countries, including the United States, has been paralyzed from time to time by powerful interest groups, and some policies in Japan requiring decisive leadership, such as the creation of social welfare and energy conservation policies in the 1970s and the privatization of state enterprises in the 1980s, have been reasonably successful. Culture as Ideology Japanese culture's influence on political values is paramount to the explanation of Japanese values in contemporary Japan, as the Japanese culture functions more of an ideological base that can be seen to embody Japanese Political values, through cultural and social norms. For most Japanese, the idea to submerge their individuality to fully commit themselves to a company or organisation is natural. This reflects in Japanese political values through the sense of loyalty most Japanese people have in life. Furthermore, the sense in which the individuality of Japanese cultures has been ingrained in to Japan's political physique is self evident in contemporary Japanese politics. This can be seen in explanations for why policy Japan has not always followed the western model, due to 'cultural reasons' such as social harmony and other disciplines of Japanese culture preventing such.

Classed as a Generation IV reactor, it features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium and management of actinides. The reference reactor design is a helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850 °C using a direct Brayton closed-cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. Core configurations are being considered based on pin- or plate-based fuel assemblies or prismatic blocks, which allows for better coolant circulation than traditional fuel assemblies. The reactors are intended for use in nuclear power plants to produce electricity, while at the same time producing (breeding) new nuclear fuel.  Nuclear reactor design  Fast reactors were originally designed to be primarily breeder reactors. This was because of a view at the time of their conception that there was an imminent shortage of uranium fuel for existing reactors. The projected increase in uranium price did not materialize, but if uranium demand increases in the future, then there may be renewed interest in fast reactors. The GFR base design is a fast reactor, but in other ways similar to a high temperature gas-cooled reactor. It differs from the HTGR design in that the core has a higher fissile fuel content as well as a non- fissile, fertile, breeding component. There is no neutron moderator, as the chain reaction is sustained by fast neutrons. Due to the higher fissile fuel content, the design has a higher power density than the HTGR.  Fuel  In a GFR reactor design, the unit operates on fast neutrons; no moderator is needed to slow neutrons down. This means that, apart from nuclear fuel such as uranium, other fuels can be used. The most common is thorium, which absorbs a fast neutron and decays into Uranium 233. This means GFR designs have breeding properties—they can use fuel that is unsuitable in light water reactor designs and breed fuel. Because of these properties, once the initial loading of fuel has been applied into the reactor, the unit can go years without needing fuel. If these reactors are used for breeding, it is economical to remove the fuel and separate the generated fuel for future use.  Coolant  The gas used can be many different types, including carbon dioxide or helium. It must be composed of elements with low neutron capture cross sections to prevent positive void coefficient and induced radioactivity. The use of gas also removes the possibility of phase transition–induced explosions, such as when the water in a water-cooled reactor (PWR or BWR) flashes to steam upon overheating or depressurization. The use of gas also allows for higher operating temperatures than are possible with other coolants, increasing thermal efficiency, and allowing other non-mechanical applications of the energy, such as the production of hydrogen fuel.  Research history  Past pilot and demonstration projects have all used thermal designs with graphite moderators. As such, no true gas-cooled fast reactor design has ever been brought to criticality. The main challenges that have yet to be overcome are in-vessel structural materials, both in-core and out-of-core, that will have to withstand fast-neutron damage and high temperatures (up to 1600 °C). Another problem is the low thermal inertia and poor heat removal capability at low helium pressures, although these issues are shared with thermal reactors which have been constructed. Peter Fortescue, whilst at General Atomic, was leader of the team responsible for the initial development of the High temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), as well as the Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GCFR) system. Gas-cooled projects (thermal spectrum) include decommissioned reactors such as the Dragon reactor, built and operated in the United Kingdom, the AVR and the THTR-300, built and operated in Germany, and Peach Bottom and Fort St. Vrain, built and operated in the United States. Ongoing demonstrations include the High-temperature engineering test reactor in Japan, which reached full power (30 MWth) using fuel compacts inserted in prismatic blocks in 1999, and the HTR-10 in China, which reached its full effect at 10 MWth in 2003 using pebble fuel. A 400 MWth pebble bed modular reactor demonstration plant was designed by PBMR Pty for deployment in South Africa but withdrawn in 2010, and a consortium of Russian institutes is designing a 600 MWth GT-MHR (prismatic block reactor) in cooperation with General Atomics. In 2010, General Atomics announced the Energy Multiplier Module reactor design, an advanced version of the GT-MHR.

Mummery, mountaineering Albert Frederick Mummery (10 September 1855, Dover, Kent, England - 24 August 1895, Nanga Parbat), was an English mountaineer and author. Although most notable for his many and varied first ascents put up in the Alps, Mummery, along with J. Norman Collie, Hastings, and two Gurkhas are also known to have been the first men in recorded history to have attempted to summit one of the Himalayan eight-thousanders - the fourteen highest peaks in the world. Their innovative, light-weight endeavour upon Nanga Parbat in 1895 was to prove ill-fated with Mummery and both Gurkhas having perished in an avalanche whilst reconnoitering the mountain's Rakhiot Face. The mountain would go on to earn its reputation as a \\"man-eater,\\" as thirty-one men would lose their lives on its slopes before the first ascent was made by the legendary Austrian Mountaineer, Hermann Buhl, in 1953. Buhl described Mummery as \\"One of the greatest mountaineers of all time\\".Hermann Buhl, È buio sul ghiacciaio, con i diari alle spedizioni al Nanga Parbat, al Broad Peak e al Chogolisa, a cura di Kurt Diemberger, Corbaccio, 2007, ; pag. 243 e pag. 261 Life Mummery's father was a tanner and mayor of Dover. The tanning business was prosperous enough for Mummery to devote most of his energies to climbing and economics. He became a friend of J. A. Hobson, and they collaborated on The Physiology of Industry (1889), which argued that because of economies' tendencies towards over-saving - and this being a cause of depressions – the economy required intervention to achieve stability.Bleaney, M (1998) Mummery, Albert Frederick: in The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics. eds Eatwell et al Mountaineer Mummery is best remembered for his pioneering efforts in mountaineering. Initially, he climbed with mountain guides, but with his companions William Cecil Slingsby and J. Norman Collie he was part of the movement which revolutionized alpinism by the practice of guideless climbing. He invented the Mummery tent, a type of tent used in the early days of mountaineering. He made a series of remarkable first ascents, most notably the Aiguille du Grépon (which features a crack named after him), the Dent du Requin, the Grands Charmoz, the Teufelsgrat on the Täschhorn, the Dürrenhorn and the Zmutt ridge of the Matterhorn, which he ascended on 3 September 1879 with the guides Alexander Burgener, J. Petrus and A. Gentinetta. In 1894, he led his friend, the young Duke of the Abruzzi, to the top of the Matterhorn by the same route. Mummery occasionally climbed with his wife Mary, or with her friend Lily Bristow. In 1880, Mummery and Burgener were repelled while trying to make the first ascent of the much-coveted Dent du Géant, being forced back by some difficult slabs. This provoked Mummery to exclaim prophetically: 'Absolutely inaccessible by fair means!'Dumler, Helmut, and Willi P. Burkhardt, The High Mountains of the Alps (London: Diadem, 1994) p. 179 In 1895, Collie, Hastings and Mummery were the first climbers to attempt the Himalayan 8,000 metre peak, Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest mountain in the world. On this pioneering lightweight expedition, the mountain claimed the first of its many victims, when Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir Thapa and Goman Singh, fell and were killed by an avalanche while reconnoitering the Rakhiot Face. Their bodies were never found. The story of this disastrous expedition is told in J. Norman Collie's book From the Himalaya to Skye. In 1898, Collie named Mount Mummery in the Canadian Rockies after his climbing companion. Mummery left behind him a legacy of some of the most well-regarded routes in the Alps, and also, in his book My Climbs in the Alps and Caucasus, one of the enduring classics of mountaineering literature. Mummery died on Nanga Parbat and on the Diamir side of the mountain, there is a famous section named after him called Mummery Spur. In February 2019, two climbers, Daniele Nardi of Italy and young Tom Ballard from England, attempted to climb Nanga Parbat through the Mummery Spur in winter, a very dangerous route, as the Mummery Spur is known for constant avalanches. According to the famous Italian climber, Simone Moro, climbing Mummery Spur in winter is a suicidal undertaking. Daniele Nardi was on his seventh attempt on Nanga Parbat and Tom Ballard on just on his second in Asia, but the young brit had an interesting story: his mother was the famous british climber, Alison Hargreaves (1962, Derbyshire, England - 1995, K2, Pakistan) who died on the K2 mountain, which also is situated in Pakistan and the second highest mountain on Earth. And her son was known as one of the most talented climbers in the world, having just completed the first ascent of all six large north faces of the Alps in winter. In 1993 his mother had been the first person ever to complete the same mountains, only in summer. Unfortunately the expedition ended in tragedy for Ballard and Nardi. After not being able to reach them on the radio for a number of days, a rescue mission was sent out by helicopter, and on March 10 their bodies were spotted on the Mummery Spur section of the Diamir side of Nanga Parbat at approximately 19,376 ft. It was decided that the location was too difficult to rescue the bodies. References  External links *Peter H.

Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Settsu was named after Settsu Province,Silverstone, p. 336 now a part of Osaka prefecture. During World War I she bombarded German fortifications at Tsingtao during the Battle of Tsingtao in 1914, but saw no other combat. She was placed in reserve in 1919 and was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. Two years later, Settsu was converted into a target ship and she played a minor role at the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. At the beginning of the Pacific War in 1941, the ship was used in an attempt to deceive the Allies as to the locations and activities of the Japanese aircraft carriers. Settsu reverted to her normal role as a target ship for the rest of the war; she was badly damaged when Allied aircraft carriers struck the naval base at Kure Naval District in July 1945. The ship was refloated after the war and scrapped in 1946–1947.

The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draft of . She displaced at normal load. Her crew ranged from 999 to 1100 officers and enlisted men. Settsu was fitted with a pair of license-built Curtis steam turbine sets, each set driving one propeller, using steam from 16 Miyabara water-tube boilers. The turbines were rated at a total of for a design speed of . She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a speed of .Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 24 Settsus main armament consisted of four 50-caliber 12-inch 41st Year Type guns in two twin-gun turrets, one each fore and aft of the superstructure, and eight 45-caliber 12-inch 41st Year Type guns mounted in four twin-gun turrets, two on each side of the superstructure. Settsus secondary armament was ten 45-caliber 6-inch/45 guns, mounted in casemates in the sides of the hull, and eight 40-caliber quick-firing (QF) 4.7-inch 41st Year Type guns.Gardiner & Gray, p. 239 The ship was also equipped with a dozen 40-caliber 3-inch 4th Year Type guns and four others were used as saluting guns.Lengerer 2006, p. 80 In addition, the battleship was fitted with five submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside and one in the stern.Preston, p. 196 The waterline main belt of the ship had a maximum thickness of 12 inches amidships. It tapered to a thickness of at the ends of the ship. A strake of armor protected the casemates. The barbettes for the main guns were thick. The armor of Settsus main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of 11 inches. The deck armor was thick and the conning tower was protected by 6 to 10 inches of armor.Lengerer 2006, pp. 76, 81 Construction and career A postcard of Settsu at speed Settsu was laid down at Kure Naval Arsenal on 18 January 1909. She was launched on 30 March 1911 and completed on 1 July 1912 at a cost of ¥11,010,000.Lengerer 2006, p. 74 Captain Morihide Tanaka assumed command on 1 December and the ship was assigned to the First Squadron. She spent most of the following year training and patrolling off the coast of China. When World War I began in August 1914, Settsu was at Kure. Together with her sister Kawachi, she bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during the final stage of the Battle of Tsingtao. Settsu was assigned to the First Squadron until 1 December 1916 when she was placed in reserveHackett & Kingsepp for a refit at Kure. Upon its completion on 1 December 1917, the ship was assigned to the Second Squadron until 23 July 1918 when she rejoined the First Squadron. By this time, all 12 of the 3-inch 4th Year Type guns were removed and four 3-inch 4th Year Type anti-aircraft guns were added. Two of the torpedo tubes were also removed. On 28 October 1918, Settsu was the flagship for Emperor Taishō for the naval review held off Yokohama as well as the review held on 9 July 1919. Settsu was placed in reserve on 6 November 1919 and reboilered during an overhaul that lasted from 1 April 1920 to 21 August 1921. While transporting Empress Teimei back to Tokyo after she toured several shrines where she prayed for the health of her husband, the ship was caught in a typhoon that forced her escorting destroyer, , ashore, but did not damage the battleship. She was disarmed in Kure in 1922 under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and stricken from the navy list on 1 October 1923. Her guns were turned over to the Imperial Japanese Army for use as coastal artillery; two of her main gun turrets were installed on Tsushima Island, one each in 1929 and 1936.Gibbs, p. 217 The rest of her guns were placed in reserve and scrapped in 1943.Gibbs & Tamura, pp. 192, 194 The following year, she was converted into a target ship with the removal of one boiler room and her center funnel. Her armor was reinforced to be able to absorb hits from shells and practice bombs. These changes reduced her maximum speed to and her displacement to In early February 1925, Settsu towed the incomplete hulk of the battleship , which had been used for gunnery and torpedo damage experiments, from Kure to the Bungo Channel where it was scuttled on 8 February.Lengerer 2010, pp. 25–26 Settsu as radio-controlled target ship at anchor on 7 April 1940 Between October 1935 and 1937, Settsu was converted to radio-control which allowed her to be maneuvered by operators aboard the destroyer . Armor on the deck, funnels, and bridge was added to strengthen her ability to survive hits. In late August 1937, Settsu, under the command of Captain Naomasa Sakonju, transported a battalion of the Sasebo 4th Special Naval Landing Force to the Shanghai area in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The troops were transferred offshore to the light cruiser and the Yakaze for transportation up the Yangtze River. During 1940, the ship was modified to make it suitable to train carrier pilots, and was used extensively by bomber pilots practicing for the attack on Pearl Harbor. She participated in the fleet review by Emperor Hirohito on 11 October 1940 in Tokyo Bay. At the beginning of the Pacific War, Settsu, under the command of Captain Chiaki Matsuda sailed from Taiwan to the vicinity of the Philippines and simulated the radio traffic of all six aircraft carriers of the 1st Air Fleet as well as the light carriers and in an effort to deceive Allied intelligence as to the locations and activities of the Japanese carriers. For most of the rest of the war, she was stationed in the Inland Sea and used for bomb and torpedo training. In March–June 1944, she served as a target for the 522nd and 762nd Naval Air Groups. During this time, she was fitted with a number of license-built Hotchkiss 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns, depth charges and a hydrophone. During the U.S. Navy carrier air attack on Kure on 24 July 1945, Settsu was attacked by 30 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters near Etajima. She was struck by one bomb that killed two men and wounded another two; five near misses started a serious leak in the starboard engine room. Captain Masanano Ofuji decided to run his ship aground on Etajima to prevent her from sinking. All of Settsus 25 mm guns were subsequently removed and the ship was used as a floating barracks. Four days later, the ship was again attacked by carrier aircraft that hit her twice more with bombs. She was abandoned the next day. Settsu was stricken from the navy list on 20 November and her hulk was raised in June 1946 and towed to Kure where scrapping was completed in August 1947.

The Aornos is located to the north of Taxila The Rock of Aornos, Shangla District, Khyber Pakhtun Khwa (KPK), Pakistan Aornos () was the Ancient Greek name for the site of Alexander the Great's last siege, which took place on April 326 BC, at a mountain site located in modern Pakistan. Aornos offered the last threat to Alexander's supply line, which stretched, dangerously vulnerable, over the Hindu Kush back to Balkh, though Arrian (although disbelieving himself of this story) credits Alexander's desire to outdo his kinsman Heracles, who allegedly had proved unable to take a fort that the Macedonians called Ἄορνος Aornos (according to Arrian and Diodorus; Aornis according to Curtius; elsewhere Aornus): meaning \\"birdless\\" in Greek. According to one theory, the name is a corruption of an Indo-Iranian word, such as *awarana \\"fortified place\\". According to Arrian, the rock had a flat summit well-supplied with natural springs and wide enough to grow crops: it could not be starved into submission. Neighboring tribesmen who surrendered to Alexander offered to lead him to the best point of access. The geographer Aurel Stein suggested that Aornos was located on Pir Sar – a mountain spur above narrow gorges in a bend of the upper Indus River, just to the west of Thakot in the Pakistani Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. However, the Indologist Giuseppe Tucci has instead proposed a site at the summit of Elum Ghar (Mount Ilam), a site significant in Hinduism, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Ptolemy and Alexander's secretary Myllinas (rather than the famous Eumenes), reconnoitered and reinforced a neighboring spur to the west with a stockade and ditch. His signal fire to Alexander also alerted the defenders of Pir-Sar, and it took two days of skirmishing in the narrow ravines for Alexander to regroup. At the vulnerable north side leading to the fort, Alexander and his catapults were stopped by a deep ravine. To bring the siege engines within reach, an earthwork mound was constructed to bridge the ravine with carpentry, brush, and earth. The first day's work brought the siege mound closer, but as the sides of the ravine fell away steeply below, progress rapidly slowed; nevertheless, at the end of the third day, a low hill connected to the nearest tip of Pir-Sar was within reach and was taken. Afterwards, Alexander in the vanguard and his first force were repelled by boulders rolled down from above. Three days of drumbeats marked the defenders' celebration of the initial repulse, followed by a surprise retreat. Alexander hauled himself up the last rockface on a rope. Alexander cleared the summit, slaying some fugitives (Lane Fox), inflated by Arrian to a massacre, and erected altars to Athena Nike, Athena of Victory, traces of which were identified by Stein.Lane Fox (1973); Arrian. Alexander was now free to pursue his journey into Punjab. The devastating Battle of the Hydaspes River lay in the future. Notes References *Lane Fox, Robin. Alexander the Great.

Natural occurrences  Many vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds contain campesterol, but in low concentrations. Banana, pomegranate, pepper, coffee, grapefruit, cucumber, onion, oat, potato, and lemon grass (citronella) are few examples of common sources containing campesterol at roughly 1–7 mg/100 g of the edible portion. In contrast, canola and corn oils contain as much as 16–100 mg/100 g. Levels are variable and are influenced by geography and growing environment. In addition, different strains have different levels of plant sterols. A number of new genetic strains are currently being engineered with the goal of producing varieties high in campesterol and other plant sterols. It is also found in dandelion coffee. It is so named because it was first isolated from the rapeseed (Brassica campestris). It is thought to have anti-inflammatory effects. It was demonstrated that it inhibits several pro-inflammatory and matrix degradation mediators typically involved in osteoarthritis-induced cartilage degradation.  Precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone  Being a steroid, campesterol is a precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone. Boldenone undecylenate is commonly used in veterinary medicine to induce growth in cattle, but it is also one of the most commonly abused anabolic steroids in sports. This led to suspicion that some athletes testing positive on boldenone undecylenate did not actually abuse the hormone itself, but consumed food rich in campesterol or similar phytosteroids.Boldenone, Boldione, and Milk Replacers in the Diet of Veal Calves: The Effects of Phytosterol Content on the Urinary Excretion of Boldenone Metabolites, G.

Montesissa; Analytica Chimica Acta, Volume 586, Issues 1–2, 14 March 2007, Pages 171–176 Cardiovascular disease Plant sterols were first shown in the 1950s to be beneficial in lowering LDLs and cholesterol. Since then, numerous studies have also reported the beneficial effects of the dietary intake of phytosterols, including campesterol. The campesterol molecules are thought to compete with cholesterol, thus reducing the absorption of cholesterol in the human intestine. Plant sterols may also act directly on intestinal cells and affect transporter proteins. In addition, an effect on the synthesis of cholesterol- transporting proteins may occur in the liver cells through processes including cholesterol esterification and lipoprotein assembly, cholesterol synthesis, and apolipoprotein (apo) B100-containing lipoprotein removal. Serum levels of campesterol and the ratio of campesterol to cholesterol have been proposed as measures of cardiac risk. Some studies have suggested that higher levels predict lower cardiac risk. However, extremely high levels are thought to be indicative of higher risk, as indicated by genetic disorders such as sitosterolemia. Study results of serum levels have been conflicting. A recent meta-analysis suggests that no clear relationship exists, and that perhaps previous studies have been confounded by other factors. For example, people who have a higher campesterol level related to a diet high in fruits and nuts may be consuming a Mediterranean-style diet, thus have lower risk because of other lipids or lifestyle factors. Intestinal absorption of cholesterol varies between individuals due to variations in the genes that encode for two proteins. The NPC1L1 protein which sits on the luminal side of the enterocyte is responsible for sterol absorption. Its counterpart, the ABCG5/G8 ATP Binding Cassette protein which also sits on the luminal side of the enterocyte, and on the bile canaliculi side of the hepatocyte, is responsible for sterol efflux. Variations in each of these proteins causes variation in absorption and efflux of dietary and biliary sterols - both cholesterol and plant sterols. Although studies in humans have shown that consumption of phytosterols may reduce LDL levels, evidence to recommend them as a treatment for hypercholesterolemia is insufficient. Larger trials are needed to provide such evidence, and are underway. Animal studies have shown that campesterol and other phytosterols can reduce the size of atherogenic plaques, but no data yet show that consumption of phytosterols results in any clinical benefit such as a reduction in atherosclerosis, heart disease, cardiac events, or mortality. Adverse effects =Nutrient levels= Excessive supplementation with plant sterols may be associated with reductions in beta-carotene and lycopene levels. Excessive long-term consumption of plant sterols might have a deleterious effect on vitamin E. =Increased risk of disease= Excessive use of plant sterols has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and genetic conditions that cause extremely elevated levels of some phytosterols, such as sitosterol, are associated with higher risks of cardiovascular disease. However, this is an active area of debate, and no data suggest that modestly elevated levels of campesterol have a negative cardiac impact.

In the European Union, it is a food additive listed with E number E499, and may be used in food manufacturing to increase the phytosterol content, potentially lowering the levels of LDL cholesterol.  Discovery  Once called Wulzen factor in the mid-20th century, stigmasterol was discovered by the University of California physiologist Rosalind Wulzen (born 1886).  Natural occurrences  Stigmasterol is an unsaturated phytosterol occurring in the plant fats or oils of numerous plants, such as soybean, calabar bean, and rape seed, and in herbs used in herbalism practices, including the Chinese herbs Ophiopogon japonicus (Mai men dong), in Mirabilis jalapa. Stigmasterol is a constituent of various vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization will inactivate stigmasterol. Edible oils contains higher amount than vegetables.  Uses  Stigmasterol is a food additive in manufactured food products in the United Kingdom and European Union. It was introduced as a precursor by Percy Lavon Julian for industrial large-scale manufacture of semisynthetic progesterone, a valuable human hormone that plays an important physiological role in the regulatory and tissue rebuilding mechanisms related to estrogen effects, as well as acting as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens, estrogens, and corticoids. It is also used as the precursor of vitamin D3. The Upjohn company used stigmasterol as the starting raw material for commercial synthesis of cortisone in 1959. Research As one of the major phytosterols, stigmasterol is included among sterol compounds in the diet having potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Consumption of 2 grams per day of plant sterols is associated with a reduction in blood LDL cholesterol of 8-10%, possibly lowering cardiovascular disease risk. As a factor in cellular processes of plants, stigmasterol may have roles in plant stress responses, metabolism, and enzymes involved in biosynthesis of plant cell membranes. Stigmasterol has also been shown to exert anti- angiogenic and anti-cancer effects via the downregulation of TNF-alpha and VEGFR-2.  Potential precursor of boldenone  Being a steroid, stigmasterol is precursor of anabolic steroid boldenone. Boldenone undecylenate is commonly used in veterinary medicine to induce growth in cattle, but it is also one of the most commonly abused anabolic steroids in sports. This led to suspicion that some athletes testing positive for boldenone didn't consume the steroid itself, but rather consumed foods rich in stigmasterol; this turned out not to be the case.

He was one of the official artists of Nazism. Wissel, who was born in Velber, was a painter in the genre of Nazi folk art, the idea being that these paintings should show the simple, natural life of a farming family. The phrase 'union with the soil' best describes the subject of his art. Wissel idealised farming life for predominantly urban viewers. Exhibitions of paintings of this genre were meant to show the peasants and working class that they were just as good as the wealthy, and that they too deserved a pleasant life. These paintings were part of the Nazis' 'blood and soil' campaign, designed to associate the ideas of health, family and motherhood with the country. Wissel painted many pictures such as these, but his work contains subtle distortions and accentuations influenced by expressionism.

It produces sickle cell trait but not the disease, as it causes only mild sickling of the RBCs. Thus, it is the least dangerous among sickle cell trait-producing hemoglobins such as HbS and HbO. HbC was discovered by Harvey Itano and James V. Neel in 1950 from two African-American families. It has since been then established that it is most common among people in West Africa. It confers survival benefits as individual with HbC is naturally resistant to malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum.  Discovery  Studying the molecular basis of sickle cell disease, Linus Pauling and Harvey Itano at the California Institute of Technology discovered in 1949 that it was due to abnormal hemoglobin called HBS. In 1950, Itano and James V. Neel discovered from two African-American families a different blood condition very similar to sickle cell disease. Five of the ten individuals indicated sickled RBCs. But the condition was harmless as the individuals had no anaemia. Thus, it was not clear whether it was involved in sickle cell disease. Genetically, the abnormal hemoglobin was only in heterozygous condition. The next year, Neel and his colleagues established that the hemoglobin is associated with sickle cell disease. The hemoglobin was named hemoglobin III, but hemoglobin C was eventually used. By 1954, it was found that the mutant hemoglobin was highly prevalent in West Africa. In 1960, Vernon Ingram and J. A. Hunt at the University of Cambridge discovered that the mutation was a single amino acid replacement of glutamic acid with lysine. Symptoms and signs Most people do not have symptoms. It can cause a mild to moderate enlargement of the spleen, splenomegaly, as well as hemolytic anemia (which is the form of anemia due to abnormal breakdown of red blood cells prematurely). Too much hemoglobin C can reduce the number and size of red blood cells in the body, causing mild anemia. Occasionally, jaundice may occur. Some persons with this disease may develop gallstones that require treatment. Continued hemolysis may produce pigmented gallstones, an unusual type of gallstone composed of the dark-colored contents of red blood cells. =Presentation= Target cells, microspherocytes and HbC crystals are found in a blood smear from a homozygous patient. =Combinations with other conditions= Individuals with sickle cell–hemoglobin C (HbSC), have inherited the gene for sickle cell disease (HbS) from one parent and the gene for hemoglobin C disease (HbC) from the other parent. Since HbC does not polymerize as readily as HbS, there is less sickling in most cases. There are fewer acute vaso-occlusive events and therefore in some cases fewer sickle cell crises. The peripheral smear demonstrates mostly target cells and only a few sickle cells. However, persons with hemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) have more significant retinopathy, ischemic necrosis of bone, and priapism than those with pure SS disease. People with hemoglobin C trait, or hemoglobin C carriers, have one gene for HbC and one normal gene. Their red blood cells contain both normal hemoglobin A and also hemoglobin C. Some people with hemoglobin C trait have slightly more hemoglobin A than hemoglobin C in their cells. Genetics Hemoglobin C disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from the biparental inheritance of the allele that encodes for hemoglobin C. If both parents are carriers of hemoglobin C, there is a chance of having a child with hemoglobin C disease. Assuming both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of having a child with hemoglobin C disease, a 50% chance of having a child who is a carrier of hemoglobin C, and a 25% chance of having a child who is neither a carrier nor affected by hemoglobin C disease. This mutated form reduces the normal plasticity of host erythrocytes causing a hemoglobinopathy. In those who are heterozygous for the mutation, about 28–44% of total hemoglobin (Hb) is HbC, and no anemia develops.In homozygotes, nearly all Hb is in the HbC form, resulting in mild hemolytic anemia.  Resistance to malaria  People with HbC are naturally immune to falciparum malaria, and are more resistant to sickle cell trait due to HbS. It is more advantageous that HbS because even under homozygous condition, it is normally non-fatal. However, in contrast to HbS, it does not prevent malaria due to P. vivax. HbC reduced the binding force (cytoadherence) of P. falciparum by reducing the activity of PfEMP1. Evidences indicate that HbC reduced the level of PfEMP1, which is required for effective binding and invasion of RBC by the malarial parasite. Diagnosis Physical examination may show an enlarged spleen. Tests that may be done include: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Hemoglobin electrophoresis, Peripheral blood smear, and Blood hemoglobin. Prevention Genetic counseling may be appropriate for high-risk couples who wish to have a baby. Treatment Usually no treatment is needed. Folic acid supplementation may help produce normal red blood cells and improve the symptoms of anemia Prognosis Overall, hemoglobin C disease is one of the more benign hemoglobinopathies. Mild-to-moderate reduction in RBC lifespan may accompany from mild hemolytic anemia. Individuals with hemoglobin C disease have sporadic episodes of musculoskeletal (joint) pain. People with hemoglobin C disease can expect to lead a normal life. Epidemiology Hemoglobin C gene is found in 2-3% of African-Americans while 8% of African- Americans have hemoglobin S (Sickle) gene. Thus Hemoglobin SC disease is significantly more common than Hemoglobin CC disease. Hemoglobin C is found in areas of West Africa, such as Nigeria, where Yorubas live. The trait also affects people whose ancestors came from Italy, Greece, Latin America, and the Caribbean region. However, it is possible for a person of any race or nationality to have hemoglobin C trait. In terms of geographic distribution, the hemoglobin C allele is found at the highest frequencies in West Africa, where it has been associated with protection against malaria. Hemoglobin C disease is present at birth, though some cases may not be diagnosed until adulthood. Both males and females are affected equally.

There have been several different attempts of creating an encyclopedia of all Esperanto topics.  History  In 1913, Petro Stojan proposed the Universal Monograph Encyclopedia (), which would be continuously published with separate monographs for each subject. The first five monographs (\\"The encyclopedia and its future\\", \\"Cinematic theory on time\\", the hymn \\"La Espero\\", \\"Transcription of proper names\\", and \\"Gathering\\", a poem by L. Levenzon) were published at that time. In 1917, Vladimír Szmurlo published another encyclopedia in Petrograd called Ariadne's Thread, with a few references as \\"A first try of an Encyclopedia of Esperantism; with a firm belief that out of that . . . seed will grow a huge tree of the Universal Esperanto Encyclopedia.\\" The first pages (1-88) were printed in Riga. Due to military circumstances, the next pages of the book appeared infrequently, only after the letter 'E', and with very short content. From 1933-34, the Encyclopedia of Esperanto, an encyclopedia of the Esperanto movement, appeared in two editions of Literatura Mondo in Budapest. A reprint was published in Hungary by the Hungarian Esperanto Association in 1979 and 1986. The majority of the original articles in this encyclopedia have been made into Wikipedia articles on the Esperanto Wikipedia. In 1996, the Enciklopedio Kalblanda, an Internet Esperanto Wikipedia, was founded by Stephen Kalb. Kalb edited the encyclopedia until 2001, when he donated all 139 of the encyclopedia's articles to the Esperanto Wikipedia. In 2001, the Esperanto Wikipedia was launched and is today the most expansive Esperanto encyclopedia, largely due to its inclusion of material from two previous encyclopedias.

In 90% of cases, they are found as stand-alone tumors, while the remainder are found in persons with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), an autosomal-dominant genetically inherited disease. They can result in a range of symptoms from physical disfiguration and pain to cognitive disability. Neurofibromas arise from nonmyelinating-type Schwann cells that exhibit biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene that codes for the protein neurofibromin. This protein is responsible for regulating the RAS-mediated cell growth signaling pathway. In contrast to schwannomas, another type of tumor arising from Schwann cells, neurofibromas incorporate many additional types of cells and structural elements in addition to Schwann cells, making it difficult to identify and understand all the mechanisms through which they originate and develop. Types Neurofibromas have been subdivided into two broad categories: dermal and plexiform. Dermal neurofibromas are associated with a single peripheral nerve, while plexiform neurofibromas are associated with multiple nerve bundles. According to the World Health Organization classification system, dermal and plexiform neurofibromas are grade I tumors. Plexiform neurofibroma are more difficult to treat and can transform into malignant tumors. Dermal neurofibroma do not become malignant. =Dermal neurofibroma= Anatomy Dermal neurofibromas (sometimes referred to as cutaneous neurofibromas) originate in nerves in the skin. Three kinds are distinguished: * Discrete cutaneous neurofibromas: Sessile or pedunculated masses on the skin, which are fleshy and non-tender, and can vary in size. * Discrete subcutaneous neurofibromas: Lie below and look like bumps on the skin, which can sometimes be tender. * Deep nodular neurofibromas: Involving tissues and organs underneath the dermis, but otherwise resembling cutaneous and subcutaneous neurofibromas. Age of onset Dermal neurofibromas typically arise in the teenage years and are often associated with the onset of puberty. In people with Neurofibromatosis Type I, they tend to continue to increase in number and size throughout adulthood, although limits exist as to how big they get, and cases progress at highly variable rates. Medical complications Dermal neurofibromas can lead to stinging, itching, pain, and disfigurement. No evidence of malignant transformation has been found. Dermal neurofibroma in a person whose lesions first appeared when he was a teenager =Plexiform neurofibroma= Anatomy Plexiform neurofibromas can grow from nerves in the skin or from more internal nerve bundles, and can be very large. Internal plexiform neurofibromas are very difficult to remove completely because they extend through multiple layers of tissue and the attempt would damage healthy tissue or organs. Age of onset Image of neurofibroma showing myxoid appearance Plexiform neurofibromas occur earlier in life and are thought to be congenital defects.\\"Case Based Pediatrics For Medical Students and Residents: Chapter XVIII.11. Neurofibromatosis\\", by Vince K. Yamashiroya, MD. August, 2002. Department of Pediatrics, University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. Medical complications Plexiform neurofibroma can cause disfigurement, neurological, and other clinical deficits. Plexiform neurofibromas have the potential to cause severe clinical complications if they occur in certain areas. About 10% of plexiform neurofibromas undergo transformation into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The formation of malignant cancers from neurofibromas is associated with the loss of expression of the CDKN2A or TP53 gene in nonmyelinating Schwann cells that also exhibit biallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene. Cause This section discusses the tumorigenesis of neurofibroma in terms of genetics, cell signaling, histology and the cell cycle. =Neurofibromin 1 gene= This picture illustrates the structure of the NF1 gene product, neurofibromin 1. This protein is 2818 amino acids long with 3 alternatively spiced exons, 9a, 23a, and 48a. The IRA domains are hypothesized to function as negative regulators of RAS, along with the GRD domain in between them. The NF1 gene is composed of 60 exons spanning 350kb of genomic data, and maps to chromosomal region 17qll.2. This gene codes for neurofibromin which is a large 220-250 KDa cytoplasmic protein that is composed of 2,818 amino acids with three alternatively spliced exons (9a, 23a and 48a) in the encoding gene. The functional part of neurofibromin is a GAP, or GTPase-activating protein. GAP accelerates the conversion of the active GTP-bound RAS to its inactive GDP- bound form, inactivating RAS and reducing RAS-mediated growth signaling. Loss of RAS control leads to increased activity of other signaling pathways including RAF, ERK1/2, PI3K, PAK and mTOR-S6 kinase. This increased activity of downstream RAS pathways might work together to increase cell growth and survival. Genes that code for proteins that regulate cell growth, such as NF1 and TP53, are referred to as tumor suppressor genes. Neurofibromin has other growth-regulatory properties besides its ability to regulate RAS activity, but these other functions are poorly understood at this time. =Schwann cells= There are two kinds of Schwann cells, myelinating and nonmyelinating. While myelinating Schwann cells cover large diameter (>1 micrometer) peripheral nervous system (PNS) axons with myelin, nonmyelinating Schwann cells encapsulate small diameter PNS axons with their cytoplasmic processes. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells are the neoplastic element in neurofibromas. This conglomeration of nonmyelinating Schwann cells and axons is called a Remak bundle. While nonmyelinating Schwann cells are the origin of neurofibromas, the mutations that make them susceptible to this transformation occur in Schwann cell precursors during early nerve development. Mutated nonmyelinating Schwann cells do not form normal Remak bundles. Instead, they fail to properly surround and segregate target axons. It is unknown at this time why, if both types of Schwann cells exhibit bilallelic inactivation of the NF1 gene, only the nonmyelinating variety give rise to neurofibromas. =Loss of tumor suppressor function= Neurofibromas arise from nonmyelinating Schwann cells that only express the inactive version of the NF1 gene, which leads to a complete loss of expression of functional neurofibromin. While one defective allele may be inherited, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) must occur before a neurofibroma can form; this is called the ‘two-hit hypothesis’. This LOH happens by the same mechanisms, such as oxidative DNA damage, that causes mutations in other cells. Once a nonmyelinating Schwann cell has suffered inactivation of its NF1 genes, it begins to proliferate rapidly. This condition is called hyperplasia, which is cell growth beyond what is normally seen. However, despite increased numbers of nonmyelinating Schwann cells, there is no neurofibroma yet. In order for the neurofibroma to develop, cells that are heterozygous for the NF1 gene must be recruited to the site. It has been hypothesized that the proliferating nonmyelinating Schwann cells secrete chemoattractants such as the KIT ligand, and angiogenic factors such as the heparin-binding growth factor midkine. These chemicals promote the migration of different kinds of cells that are heterozygous for the NF1 gene into the hyperplastic lesions created by the nonmyelinating Schwann cells. These cell types include fibroblasts, perineurial cells, endothelial cells, and mast cells. The mast cells then secrete mitogens or survival factors that alter the developing tumor microenvironment and result in neurofibroma formation. Dermal and plexiform neurofibromas differ in later development stages, but the details are unclear at this point. Diagnosis Histopathologic image of cutaneous neurofibroma obtained by biopsy A blood test for protein melanoma inhibitory activity may be used to detect the presence of neurofibromas. Treatments =Dermal neurofibroma= Dermal neurofibromas are not usually surgically removed unless they are painful or disfiguring, because there are generally so many of them and they are not dangerous. CO2 lasers have been used to remove dermal neurofibromas. In a paper titled Hypertrophic Scars After Therapy with CO2 Laser for Treatment of Multiple Cutaneous Neurofibromas Ostertag et al. said this about treatment by laser: “The cosmetic disfigurement is the most important issue in the decision to treat cutaneous symptoms of neurofibromatosis. Treating patients with extensive neurofibromas with [a] CO2 laser is still the best choice. However, it is strongly advised that a test treatment be performed to judge the effectiveness of the procedure and whether the developed scar is an acceptable trade-off.” =Plexiform neurofibroma= Surgery As of 2002, the primary treatment option for plexiform neurofibroma was surgery. Removal of plexiform neurofibromas is difficult because they can be large and cross tissue boundaries. However, besides pain, plexiform neurofibromas are sometimes removed due to the possibility of malignant transformation. The following examples show that plexiform neurofibromas can form anywhere and can make surgical resection difficult: * A large plexiform neurofibroma in the leg of a 6-year-old male. The authors state: “Our case was operated, as both the cutaneous and deep branches of the peroneal nerve were involved causing pain and numbness in the leg, and because there was a possibility for malignant transformation, as growth in the mass was realized by the family members of the patient.” The authors also note, “However, complete resection is quite difficult due to invasion of the tumor into the surrounding soft tissues.” * A neurofibroma on the left ventricle. The neurofibroma was removed and the patient’s mitral valve had to be replaced. * A 14-year-old girl with NF1 was diagnosed with a neurofibroma involving her bladder, a rare location. Radiation Once a plexiform neurofibroma has undergone malignant transformation, radiation and chemotherapy can be used as treatment. However, radiation is generally not used as a treatment for plexiform neurofibromas because of concerns that this could actually promote malignant transformation. There has even been a documented case of a Schwannoma being induced from a neurofibroma due to radiation therapy. =Medications= ACE inhibitors have been proposed as a novel treatment of neurofibromas. ACE inhibitors are currently used to treat hypertension and congestive heart failure, to avert remodeling and reinfarction after myocardial infarction, and to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy and other renal diseases. ACE inhibitors work by indirectly down regulating TGF-beta, which is a growth factor that has been shown to influence the development of tumors. =No effect= Pirfenidone inhibits fibroblast growth. Studies showed no improvement over controls. Tipifarnib (also known as drug R115777) inhibits the activation of RAS. This drug is a Farnesyltransferase inhibitor which inhibits the Ras kinase in a post translational modification step before the kinase pathway becomes hyperactive. It successfully passed phase one clinical trials but was suspended (NCT00029354) in phase two after showing no improvement over controls. \\"R115777 to Treat Children With Neurofibromatosis Type 1 and Progressive Plexiform Neurofibromas\\" Research The many drug therapies under study for neurofibromas are in various stages of research; more time will be required to determine if these are viable options for the treatment of neurofibromas. Sirolimus, a compound that inhibits mTOR signalling, is being studied to treat plexiform neurofibromas. The combination of erlotinib with sirolimus was studied to treat low-grade gliomas. Early research has shown potential for using the c-kit tyrosine kinase blocking properties of imatinib to treat plexiform neurofibromas.\\"Gleevec Holds Potential As First Drug To Successfully Treat Neurofibromatosis, Scientists Report\\", Science Daily, October 31, 2008\\"Phase II Study of Gleevec/Imatinib Mesylate (STI-571, NSC 716051) in Neurofibromatosis (NF1) Patients with Plexiform Neurofibromas\\" Peginterferon alfa-2b is being studied to treat plexiform neurofibromas.\\"A Phase II Trial of Peginterferon Alpha-2b (Pegintron) for Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Related Unresectable, Symptomatic or Life-Threatening Plexiform Neurofibromas\\", National Institutes of Health study 08-C-0130 Sorafenib is being studied for treatment of unresectable plexiform neurofibroma and low-grade astrocytomas. In vitro, tranilast, inhibits growth of neurofibroma cells. Gene therapy for the neurofibromin 1 gene represents the ultimate solution to preventing the cluster of maladies which are enabled by the mutation. As of 2006, therapy for NF1 tumors had not been tested due to the lack of an appropriate NF1 tumor model. also available here  See also  * Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor * Neurofibromatosis * Neurofibromin * Genetic disorder * Watson syndrome * Proteus syndrome * RASopathy * Palisaded encapsulated neuroma References  External links   PNS neoplasia Dermal and subcutaneous growths ","title":"Neurofibroma"},{"id":"2966204","text":"241 (two hundred [and] forty-one) is the natural number between 240 and 242.

She sank in 1918 after an explosion in her ammunition magazine with the loss of over 600 officers and crewmen. Background Right elevation and plan of the Kawachi-class battleships from Brassey's Naval Annual 1915 The Kawachi class were Japan's first true dreadnougts. They were ordered on 22 June 1907 under the 1907 Warship Supplement Program after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, although their construction was delayed by a severe depression. Their design was based on the semi-dreadnought with a uniform main battery.Lengerer, p. 73 Design and description Kawachi had an overall length of , a beam of , and a normal draft of .

A 6-inch strake of armor protected the casemates. The barbettes for the main guns were thick. Eleven-inch armor plates protected the front and sides of the Kawachis' main-gun turrets. The deck armor was thick and the conning tower was protected by 6 to of armor.Lengerer, pp. 76, 81 Construction and career A postcard of Kawachi at anchor Kawachi was laid down on Slipway No. 2 at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 1 April 1909.Lengerer & Ahlberg, p. 436 Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Kawachi was named after Kawachi Province,Silverstone, p. 333 now a part of Osaka prefecture. She was launched on 15 October 1910 in a ceremony attended by Emperor Meiji and completed on 31 March 1912 at a cost of ¥11,130,000.Lengerer, p. 74 The following day she was assigned to the First Fleet and became the flagship of Vice Admiral Dewa Shigetō.Lengerer & Ahlberg, p. 457 On 3 October, the ship was present when the battleship had a fire that was started by a sailor in the forward magazine. It was flooded before the fire could get out of control and Kawachi sent over fire-fighting teams to assist Mikasas crew in case they were needed.Kingsepp 2008, pp. 37–38 The ship cruised in the South China Sea in February 1913 and then off the north China coast in April; she became a private ship on 1 December. When World War I began in August 1914, Kawachi was at Yokosuka. Together with her sister ship, , she bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during the final stage of the Battle of Tsingtao.Hackett & Kingsepp The ship was present in Yokosuka on 8 January 1915 when the victorious Second Squadron returned to Japan after the Battle of Tsingtao. She was assigned to the First Squadron of the First Fleet on 15 August. On 1 December 1916 she began a lengthy refit. Under the command of the newly appointed Captain Yoshimoto Masaki, Kawachi was assigned to the Second Squadron of the First Fleet on 1 December 1917 and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Chisaka Tomojirō. She briefly cruised off the coast of China in February–March 1918. In May the ship exchanged two of her three-inch casemate guns for three-inch anti-aircraft guns.Lengerer & Ahlberg, p. 458 On the evening of 11 July, Kawachi entered Tokuyama Bay, the following morning torpedo target practice was cancelled due to rough seas and the battleship remained at anchor for the rest of the day. That afternoon a loud explosion was heard at 15:51 in the vicinity of the starboard forward main-gun turret and large quantities of smoke erupted from the turret and between the first and second funnels. Two minutes later, she began to list to starboard and capsized at 15:55, only four minutes after the explosion.Lengerer, p. 83 Over a thousand men were aboard Kawachi at the time of the explosion and over 600 were killed, with 433 survivors. The Imperial Japanese Navy convened a commission to investigate the explosion the day after the incident, with Vice Admiral Murakami Kakuichi as chairman. The commission first suspected arson, but no plausible suspect could be found and it reported that the cordite in her magazine might have spontaneously ignited due to decomposition. Kawachis magazines had been inspected in January–February, however, and no problems were discovered, which made that possibility less likely.

The series currently contains nine books in addition to some side material. The twins' names are derived from American author and poet Edgar Allan Poe. Rare Beasts is the first book, followed by Tourist Trap, Under Town, Pet's Revenge, High Wire and Nod's Limbs, with a sequel series premiering just a year later, currently consisting of Hot Air, Frost Bites and Split Ends. The Mischief Manual, a book written in the voice of the twins themselves, hit the shelves in June 2007. A series of animated shorts premiered in 2006 and a weekly TV series premiered October 7, 2007 both on Nicktoons. Edgar and Ellen live in a 13-story mansion on the edge of Nod's Limbs. Ellen is supposedly the older of the twins by 2 minutes and 13 seconds. They live with a hairy creature who they refer to as Pet — a hairball with an eyeball. Their groundskeeper and caretaker, Heimertz, lives in a small shack just outside the house. Their mansion is located near a now disassembled junkyard, which the twins had lovingly dubbed their \\"Gadget Graveyard\\". They take parts from it and create marvelous contraptions for trouble. Both of the twins wear striped footie pajamas and prank each other all day long—when they're not pranking the goody-goody townspeople of Nod's Limbs. They are clever, fearless, mischievous and creative. So creative, in fact, that their pranks often backfire hilariously.

But things don't go as planned when a purloined python gets hungry. ;Tourist Trap :Mayor Knightleigh plans to destroy the gadget graveyard in order to build his own fancy hotel, using a group of celebrities to sponsor it. The twins manage to steal Stephanie Knightleigh's position as tour guide, taking the celebrities for a ghastly tour. The twins manage to sabotage the world's largest French toast festival, seemingly crushing Knightleigh's plans. They then find out that one tourist, Alex Sai, wrote a positive review on Nod's Limbs tourism. ;Under Town :In Under Town, someone is tormenting the fine people of Nod's Limbs...and for once, it's not Edgar and Ellen. A new prankster is one step ahead of the twins, making mischief all over town. To discover the identity of this daring new foe, Edgar and Ellen must descend under town to stop this rash of copycat capers once and for all. ;Pet's Revenge :In Pet's Revenge, Edgar has to plot solo when Ellen suddenly turns into a model of proper behavior. She (voluntarily) takes a bath and even accepts an invitation to a slumber party. Surely she's got a scheme up her (unusually clean) sleeve. Or has a hairy traitor managed to break up the devious duo... ;High Wire :The twins' groundskeeper, Heimertz, has a dark and secret past shrouded in... the Big Top. When the circus comes to Nod's Limbs, everyone, especially Edgar and Ellen, gets their money's worth. ;Nod's Limbs :The legend of Nod's missing golden limbs resurfaces, and a town-wide search commences. The entire town becomes obsessed with a treasure hunt that leads to the twins' turf, and the intruders dig out a collapsed cave to discover something far more shocking than gold. =Series two overviews= ;Hot Air :A few months after the disgrace of the Knightleighs and Augustus Nod's return from the dead, Edgar and Ellen are living as town heroes. But their easy life is threatened when an old nemesis returns, and to make matters more complicated, the first Knightleigh-less mayoral election is coming up. ;Frost Bites :The twins' pursuit of Stephanie Knightleigh leads them to Frøsthaven, an Arctic village whose cheerful citizens and strange customs remind them of home. What makes this place a sugary sweet duplicate of Nod's Limbs? The secret, alas, is upon the forbidden slopes of the Glöggenheim, where dwells something that doesn't take kindly to being disturbed. ;Split Ends :In order to thwart Stephanie's scheme, the twins must separate for the first time in their lives. Edgar's pursuit of the Midway Irregulars leads him to the forests of Cougar Falls and an unlikely partnership with an eccentric professional monster hunter, while Ellen and Pet find themselves in the decidedly inhospitable town of Lach Lufless. =Other books= ;Mischief Manual :The Mischief Manual is Edgar and Ellen's first chance to write a book in their own voice, \\"out from under the thumb of Charles Ogden\\". In this book, the twins share their trade secrets and inspirations for all manner of misdeeds and mayhem, including skill-building exercises, sample blueprints, and schemes to try at their home. =Setting= Nod's Limbs is the town where Edgar and Ellen live. It's so sickeningly sweet that it makes your teeth hurt. There is no originality to the people that live there- which is why Edgar and Ellen are such a foil for them. The twins attempt to liven up shiny that one just wants to throw mud at it just to mix things up a bit. Living in it is, in the twins' own words, \\"like living inside a sugar cube\\". The cartoon shorts The cartoon shorts were co-produced with Bardel Entertainment in association with YTV and Nicktoons. Nicktoons Network aired Edgar & Ellen two-minute shorts every day. There were thirteen shorts in total. Six holiday specials began airing on Nicktoons Network on Labor Day Weekend 2006. The Back-to-School special, \\"Accept No Substitutes\\", was followed by a Halloween special, \\"Trick or Twins\\", a winter special, \\"Cold Medalists\\", a Valentine's special entitled \\"Crushed\\", and an April Fool's special \\"Nobody's Fools\\". The most recent one, called \\"Frog Days of Summer\\", aired on September 3, 2007. The cartoon shorts mainly show the pranking activities of Edgar and Ellen, but also include supporting characters like Mayor Knightleigh, Bob the Intern, Pet, Buffy the Muffin lady, and several other entertaining Nod's Limbsians. Edgar and Ellen hosted the Scare-a-thon on Nicktoons during Halloween weekend of 2005 and did so again in 2006.

The museum is associated with the University of Pennsylvania, and is located on its campus. The Institute is one of the country's leading museums dedicated to exhibiting the innovative art of our time. Robert Chaney is its Director of Curatorial Affairs. History Since its founding in 1963 by Holmes Perkins, the ICA has established a reputation for identifying artists of promise who later emerge in the international spotlight. The ICA has exhibited the first museum shows of Andy Warhol, Laurie Anderson, Agnes Martin, and Robert Indiana. The ICA does not have a permanent collection, but new exhibits are shown three times a year, with approximately twelve shows annually. ICA offers educational programs, artist talks, lectures, films and tours. Early shows included works by Richard Artschwager, Vija Celmins, Karen Kilimnik, Charles LeDray, Barry Le Va, Glenn Ligon, Robert Mapplethorpe, Pepon Osorio, Tavares Strachan, and Cy Twombly. Other featured artists have included Gillian Wearing, Yoshitomo Nara, John Armleder, Robert Crumb, Kate Gilmore, and Odili Donald Odita. Roberta Smith of the New York Times wrote in 2007 that the ICA is \\"among the most adventuresome showcases in the country where art since 1970 is concerned. It chooses its subject well, keeps things accessible through the judicious use of well-written labels and brochures, and takes risks that prove that the curatorial discipline is alive and kicking\\". In 2009, Smith also observed, \\"On a surprisingly regular basis, the tiny Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania here mounts exhibitions that make the contemporary-art adventures of many larger museums look blinkered, timid and hidebound.\\" The ICA was previously headquartered in Meyerson Hall. The current modern gallery building was built in 1990 and designed by Adèle Naudé Santos, who later became the dean of Architecture at MIT.

Dr. Robert Goodman, a former Bergen Tech physics teacher, who was named New Jersey Teacher of the Year for 2005-2006.,Bergen County Educator Named State Teacher of the Year, New Jersey Department of Education press release dated October 18, 2005. is an advocate of the Physics First methodology and did his doctoral dissertation at Rutgers University based on the success of teaching Physics First to freshman based on the model he implemented at Bergen Tech. The science curriculum framework centers around freshmen taking Physics Honors, with the option of taking AP Physics 1, AP Physics 2, AP Physics C, and Waves and Modern Physics from NJIT in subsequent years. Instead of the traditional biology-chemistry- physics sequence, Physics First relies upon a physics-chemistry-biology sequence. The school's specialized curriculum adds a lab period once a week to every student's schedule to all science classes, which is equivalent to two regular periods. In these labs, students perform unique experiments to understand real-life methods applications of the sciences they are studying. Physics experiments range from creating a personal generator to measuring the frequency of a sonic boom. Students interested in taking AP Chemistry can do so their junior and senior years, and those interested in AP Biology may do so in their senior year. In addition to AP Chemistry and Biology, as well as AP Environmental Science, students have the option to take college level classes in Organic Chemistry (articulation with Fairleigh Dickinson University), Forensic Science (a Syracuse University Project Advance Course), and/or Anatomy & Physiology. =Mathematics= Bergen Tech - Teterboro offers a wide range of mathematics courses. These include: Algebra I, Geometry, Math Analysis I & II (a highly rigorous 2-year Precalculus with Limits course with a heavy emphasis on Algebra II and Trigonometry), AP Calculus AB, AP Calculus BC, Multivariable Calculus, and AP Statistics.

Incoming students can take a summer Pre-Algebra or Algebra I course if they feel necessary, or to be placed in another math class. =Humanities= Aside from World Cultures, United States Honors 1 and 2, and AP US History classes, college level classes in Global Challenge and Sociology are also available as electives. In the 2016-2017 academic school year, AP Human Geography was introduced to the freshmen class for certain students. Course material in Human Geography is based on the concept of globalization. =AP Seminar and AP Research= Bergen Tech will start offering AP Seminar starting the 2015-2016 academic year, one of the newest curriculum designed by the CollegeBoard. The subsequent year is expected to see the introduction of AP Research. =Project Wednesdays and Senior Experience= Every Wednesday during the school year, periods are shortened to accommodate an additional hour before the day's end. This period is known as Project Wednesday. Types of projects that students can apply to are: knitting, Physics Olympiad, Garage Band, Radio Lab, Equations, The Sims, Robotics, Earth preservation, Fitness, Teacher, and many more. This allows students to take classes that help explore their interests outside of traditional course offerings. Freshmen are required to take a project named \\"School Climate\\" to help adjust to Bergen Tech's intense coursework. Seniors take every Wednesday to partake in what is known as \\"Senior Experience,\\" where every senior participates in an off campus internship for the entire school day that gives credits required for graduation.

Like its predecessor, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, it was developed for multiple platforms, including MS-DOS, Atari ST and Amiga. It utilizes Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI0) engine, featuring 16-color EGA graphics and a mouse-based interface for movement. The story continues the exploits of Larry Laffer, who becomes stranded on a tropical island during an ill-fated vacation.  Gameplay  Unlike the original Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards, the game follows a linear story progression similar to Sierra's other adventure games, particularly later entries in the King's Quest series. The player character's movements are controlled via the cursor keys, the mouse or even the joystick, although a text parser is still used for all other actions. Rather than navigating through a single city, the player character is guided through a variety of puzzles and mazes. Players must take care in acquiring certain items over the course of the journey, lest they be stymied by an inescapable trap. Though there is no visible time limit, a number of pre-scripted events require players to act quickly in order to reach the next sequence. As is standard in most Leisure Suit Larry games, the protagonist Larry Laffer's interactions with female non-player characters are accompanied by an on-screen portrait, though the images are much smaller than seen previously. The game actively punishes Larry for flirting with any woman he meets, a marked departure from the rest of the series; such acts invariably leads to Larry's violent death and a game over. Also included is a \\"Trite Phrase\\" option, which allows players to input a catchphrase which is repeated over the course of the game; the default is the notorious \\"Have a nice day\\".  Plot  The opening sequence of the game finds Larry mowing the lawn of Eve, his sexual encounter from the ending of the previous game, implying the pair have remained together. However, this is quickly revealed to be an instance of an unreliable narrator, as Eve pulls into the driveway with only the vaguest recollection of who Larry is. Realizing that his affair with Eve was merely a one-night stand, a distraught Larry wanders off, winning the Lottery as well as a free vacation after stumbling into a rigged dating game show. During his preparations for the cruise ship, a microfilm falls into Larry's hands by mistake; this attracts the attention of the KGB, as well as the mad scientist Dr. Nonookee (a pun on \\"no nookie\\"), who both want to recover the film. On the cruise ship, Larry discovers that the woman who mistakenly chose him in the dating show let her mother go with Larry, so he makes preparations in order to escape her; he stops the ship and escapes on a lifeboat. Days later he is washed off a resort on a Hispanophone Pacific island. As KGB agents block the way to the airport, Larry dresses up as a woman and passes through. As the landing of the airplane will bring Larry to the agents, he opens the door and escapes the plane with a parachute. He falls in the jungle of a virgin tropical island, Nontoonyt (\\"None tonight\\"), where Dr. Nonookee has his base of operations. Passing through perils in the jungle, Larry meets Kalalau, the daughter of chief Keneewauwau, who explains to him that Dr. Nonookee prevents a company from investing on the island and develop it as a resort island. In order to marry Kalalau, Larry infiltrates the volcano and accidentally causes the death of Dr. Nonookee, liberating the native women he had hypnotized as slaves, including \\"Polyester Patti\\". In the final cutscene, Larry marries the chief's daughter, the witch doctor rejuvenates him, and he makes love to Kalalau as the volcano explodes. Throughout the adventure there are recurring themes that contribute to the comedic effect, like visitation to identical barber shops in almost each location Larry visits; one of them is tended by Rosella of King's Quest IV: The Perils of Rosella.  Development  The first sequel of the series used Sierra On-Line's new adventure game engine called Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI), with full 320x200 resolution, mouse, and sound card support. In addition to sharing the SCI0 engine, the game parallels the King's Quest series in its realistic art style—particularly in regard to Larry's character portrait—and grand-adventure elements, including a number of diverse settings (a cruise ship, tropical islands, etc.). Sierra On-Line intentionally toned down the titular character's sexual escapades for the sequel. According to series creator Al Lowe, this lack of Leisure Suit Larry's trademark humor is an oft-cited criticism of the game. It is also notable for being the only game in the series where Larry cannot cavort with women until the end. For this reason, the game did not include an age-verification test, although brief instances of pixellated nudity still occur at certain points. The engine also supports FM and MT-32 music. Among the many women Larry meets over the course of the game is Rosella of Daventry—the protagonist of King's Quest IV—an example of Sierra's many cross-promotions. One of the game's final scenes includes a piano-playing \\"Polyester Patty\\", who features prominently in Leisure Suit Larry III: Passionate Patti in Pursuit of the Pulsating Pectorals and Leisure Suit Larry 5: Passionate Patti Does a Little Undercover Work under the name \\"Passionate Patti\\". Patti is blond in this incarnation, whereas future games depict her as dark-haired. With their SCI engine, Sierra dropped disk-based protection schemes. The game has a copy protection screen where one of several pictures of women are displayed and the user must enter their phone number as given in the manual. However, some versions of the game include an undocumented way to skip this screen (as well as activating a cheat mode) by entering 0724 as the phone number (the designer Al Lowe's birthday – July 24; he put this into the game while testing so he would not need to enter the copy protection codes whenever he restarted it).  Reception  Al Lowe has said that each game in the Leisure Suit Larry franchise, including Looking for Love, sold over 250,000 copies. According to Sierra On-Line, combined sales of the Larry series surpassed 1.4 million units by the end of March 1996, before the release of Leisure Suit Larry: Love for Sail! The total sales of the first five Leisure Suit Larry games had surpassed 2 million copies by the time of Love for Sales launch. Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places) received mostly highly positive reviews upon its release, including the overall scores of 9/10 from Commodore User and 90% from Computer & Video Games. Even a 1994 re-release by Kixx earned the Amiga version an 84%. In his contemporary review, Bob Guerra of Compute! stated that the game was a \\"terrific sequel to one of the best adventure games ever written\\" that surpassed its predecessor and was \\"thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. The story is as interesting as anything you're likely to find on network television, and less predictable to boot\\". It praised the graphical and story details that, the magazine said, \\"create the illusion that you're peeking into a\\" living world. Retrospectively, Adventure Classic Gaming's Zack Howe opined in 2000 that while it \\"may not be the best game in the Leisure Suit Larry series, it is still a humorous and an entertaining title to play.\\" In 1991, PC Format placed the first three Leisure Suit Larry titles on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors wrote, \\"The three Larry games so far plumb new depths in computer entertainment — they're crude, suggestive, full of innuendo and double entendres and designed to appeal to the worst aspects of human nature — you'll love 'em.\\"  References   External links  1980s interactive fiction 1988 video games Amiga games Atari ST games Cold War video games DOS games Leisure Suit Larry games ScummVM supported games Sierra Entertainment games Video game sequels Video games developed in the United States Video games set in Los Angeles Video games set in Oceania Video games set in South America Video games set on fictional islands ","title":"Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places)"},{"id":"2966236","text":"Colin Fletcher Kirkus (19 June 1910 – 13 September 1942) was a British rock cllimber.

Sir Walter Scott in his novel The Antiquary (1816) refers to Aiken Drum in a story told by an old beggar about the origins of what has been perceived by the protagonist as a Roman fort. The beggar tells him that it was actually built by him and others for \\"auld Aiken Drum's bridal\\" and that one of the masons cut the shape of a ladle into the stone as a joke on the bridegroom. The reference suggests that the rhyme, and particularly the chorus, was well enough known in the early nineteenth century for the joke to be understood.Sir Walter Scott, The Antiquary (1816) , accessed 25/04/09. The Brownie of Blednoch Aiken Drum is also the name given by the Scottish poet William Nicholson to the brownie in his poem \\"The Brownie of Blednoch\\" (1825). Although this has led some folklorists to speculate that the song may derive from older fairy legends, there is no evidence of the name being used for a brownie prior to Nicholson.Briggs, Katharine (1976).

Sweden possessed five colonies, four of which were short lived. The colonies spanned three continents: Africa, Asia and North America. List The former Swedish colonies in Africa were: *Swedish Gold Coast (1650–1663; lost to Denmark and the Dutch) Including the Cape Coast (1649–1663) consisting of the following settlements: *:Fort Apollonia, presently Beyin: 1655–1657. *:Fort Christiansborg/Fort Frederiksborg, which became the capital, presently Osu: 1652–1658 *:Fort Batenstein, presently Butri: 1649–1656. *:Fort Witsen, presently Takoradi: 1653–1658. *:Carolusborg: April 1650 – January/February 1658, 10 December 1660 – 22 April 1663 The former Swedish colonies in America: *New Sweden (1638–1655; lost to the Dutch) *Saint-Barthélemy (1784–1878; sold to France) *Guadeloupe (1813–1814; returned to France) The former Swedish colonies in Asia were: *Parangipettai (1733; lost to France and Great Britain) Americas =New Sweden= Map of New Sweden ca. 1650 Seal of the Swedish governor of Saint Barthélemy, 1784-1878. By the middle of the 17th century, the Swedish Empire had reached its greatest territorial extent. The Swedes sought to extend their influence by creating an agricultural (tobacco) and fur trading colony to bypass French, British and Dutch merchants. The charter included Swedish, Dutch and German stockholders. Once they landed they established Fort Christina (now Wilmington, Delaware), named after Queen Christina of Sweden. Many of the settlers were Finnish, since until 1809 the area of modern Finland was the eastern third of the kingdom of Sweden. The settlement was actually an invasion of New Netherland since it was Dutch territory. The founder and first governor, Peter Minuit, had been Director- General of New Netherland from 1626 to 1633. Disgruntled after being dismissed from his post, he led a Swedish expedition to a location which he knew to be strategic as well as a thorn in the side of his former employers. Minuit died on a return trip from Stockholm in a hurricane near the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts. The colony would establish Fort Nya Elfsborg north of present-day Salem, New Jersey in 1643. In May 1654 the Dutch Fort Casimir, located in present-day New Castle, Delaware was captured by New Sweden. As a reprisal, the Dutch governor Peter Stuyvesant sent an army to the Delaware River, which obtained the surrender of the Swedish forts. =Antillian possessions= Saint Barthélemy is the only Caribbean island to have been historically a Swedish colony for any significant length of time, Guadeloupe only having been one briefly, at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. As a result of Sweden's support of France's enemies during the Napoleonic Wars, the island of Guadeloupe was ceded to king Charles XIV John personally, not to his Swedish state. However a year later the island was given to France by the Treaty of Paris. Sweden then forced a settlement with Great Britain because it had been guaranteed the island which was strategically close to its other Caribbean colony. This led to the Guadeloupe Fund which guaranteed Sweden 24 million francs. Because of how the money was used, Sweden was then given an additional 300,000 Riksdaler under the Riksdag of 1815 every year. The last installment was paid in 1983. In addition to these the Swedes briefly attempted to settle Tobago in 1733, but were driven away by native tribes, and Tobago was eventually claimed by the British. Africa Akan King of Futu to erect a \\"stony house\\" for the purpose of trade. Sweden temporarily controlled several settlements on the Gold Coast (present Ghana) since 22 April 1650, but lost the last when on 20 April 1663 Fort Carlsborg and the capital Fort Christiansborg were seized by Denmark. =Cape Coast= In 1652, the Swedes took Cape Coast (in modern Ghana) which had previously been under the control of the Dutch and before that the Portuguese. Cape Coast was centered on the Carolusburg Castle which was built in 1653 and named after King Charles X Gustav of Sweden but is now known as the Cape Coast Castle. =Atlantic slave trade= During this time, the small Swedish slave trade began. However, after the fall of New Sweden to the Dutch, the slave trade ended. It would later be rejuvenated in 1784, when Sweden's monarch, Gustav III, began negotiations with France with a view to creating a new alliance between the two countries. Gustav offered Gothenburg as an entrepôt to the French, in exchange for the Caribbean colony of Saint Barthélemy, in addition to subsidies. Although Sweden was successful in acquiring the island in 1784, the population of the colony was less than 1000 people, and neither were particularly propitious trading ports—sugar and cotton only provided four shiploads a year, and many of the other resources were only produced in large enough quantities to provide subsistence for the inhabitants. However, the islands were close to the British and French trading posts of the Leeward and Windward islands. A new town was also constructed, Gustavia (named after the King), and this facilitated trade. Within a year, the population had doubled and the King saw fit to form the Swedish West India Company. The Napoleonic Wars (1803–1815) benefitted trade, as did the opening of free trade with Sweden in 1806; the population had continued to increase, reaching approximately 5000 by 1800. Discounting a brief period of British occupation from 1801 to 1802, the colonies continued to thrive. In 1811, 1800 ships visited Saint Barthélemy; and from October 1813 to September 1814, 20% of the U.S.'s exports passed through the island. The island was notable for its liberalism, particularly in regards to religious toleration. In Sweden, Lutheranism was strictly adhered to; people were obligated to attend a number of church services a year, and adherence to other religions or denominations was against the law (conversion to Catholicism, for example, often led to people being exiled). However, these two islands were inhabited by such a diverse group of people from European backgrounds, that French and English were also accepted official languages. On Saint Barthélemy, in 1787, only 21 Lutherans resided there, compared to over 500 Catholics, as well as several hundred people from different Protestant denominations. The government did not seek to suppress this: indeed, they ordered Saint Barthélemy's governor, Rosenstein, to salary a Catholic priest to come from Saint Martin twice a month. India The Swedish East India Company did not establish any permanent colonies in India, but they briefly possessed a factory in Porto Novo (today Parangipettai, Tamil Nadu). The fort was destroyed a month after its construction by French and British forces.

It was developed for the PC DOS and the Apple II and later ported to other platforms such as the Amiga, Atari ST, Apple IIGS, Apple Macintosh, and the Tandy Color Computer 3. It utilizes the Adventure Game Interpreter (AGI) engine. In 1991, Sierra released a remake version titled Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards that used the Sierra's Creative Interpreter (SCI) engine with 256 colors and a point-and-click, icon-driven (as opposed to the original's text-based) user interface, released for the PC DOS, Apple Macintosh, and Amiga. The game's story follows its player character of a middle-aged male virgin named Larry Laffer as he desperately tries to \\"get lucky\\" in the fictional American city of Lost Wages. Land of the Lounge Lizards establishes several elements which recur in the later Leisure Suit Larry games, including Larry's campy attire, perpetual bad luck with women, and penchant for double- entendres. The game's overall plot and basic structure follow that of Softporn Adventure, Sierra's own 1981 Apple II text adventure that did not feature Larry. Despite a lack of advertising, the game was a sleeper hit and a commercial and critical success. It was followed by a long series of sequels and spin-offs over decades, beginning with Leisure Suit Larry Goes Looking for Love (in Several Wrong Places) in 1988. A second, high-definition remake, titled Leisure Suit Larry: Reloaded, was developed by N-Fusion Interactive working with the Larry series' creator Al Lowe and published by Replay Games in 2013.  Plot  VGA) The protagonist, Larry Laffer, is a 38-year-old (40-year-old in the 1991 remake) \\"loser\\" who lives in his mother's basement and has not yet lost his virginity. Having grown weary of his lonely existence, he decides to visit the resort city of Lost Wages (a parody of \\"Las Vegas\\") hoping to experience what he has not lived before and to finally find the woman of his dreams. Larry starts with nothing but an out-of-style 1970s disco-era leisure suit and $94 in his pocket. His quest involves four possible women: a nameless, seedy-looking sex worker; Fawn, a club-goer of low moral fiber; Faith, a receptionist who (true to her name) is faithful to her boyfriend; and Eve, a bathing beauty and Larry's ultimate goal.  Gameplay  Players control Larry's movements with the directional keys and by inputting commands into a text parser (e.g. \\"talk to man\\", \\"open window\\", etc.). If Larry is too far away from a person or object to comply, or if the command is invalid, a caution message appears with hints on what to do. EGA) The game begins outside a bar in Lost Wages. The city consists of five areas: Lefty's Bar, a hotel-casino, a 24-hour wedding chapel, a disco, and a convenience store. The player can walk between areas that are next to each other, but other areas can only be accessed by hailing a taxi, which costs the player money; failure to do so results in Larry's being mugged or hit by oncoming traffic. During the early stages of the game, Larry can survive most premature deaths. In the original release, a compartment opens beneath Larry's body and takes him to a laboratory where heroes from Sierra's computer games—such as King's Quest—are re-assembled; in the remake, Larry's remains are instead thrown inside a blender and reformed. Larry's interactions with key women are accompanied by a detailed image of whomever he is speaking with, unlike other non-player characters. With the exception of the prostitute, each of the women shuns Larry at first but responds favorably to gifts of varying sorts. Although it is not possible to woo all of the women, giving gifts is needed to advance to the game's final area, the hotel penthouse. To this end, money is essential to advance through the game. The only available method of augmenting Larry's funds is to gamble in the casino, playing blackjack and slots. Players are given seven real-time hours (eight in the 1991 remake) to complete the game, at which point a despairing Larry commits suicide, resulting in game over. A prostitute is available as soon as the game starts. Should Larry have unprotected intercourse with her, he will contract a sexually-transmitted disease and die shortly thereafter. This fate may be avoided by buying a condom at the convenience store. Larry questions the validity of losing his virginity to a prostitute, but the game resumes without a time limit.  Development and release  Al Lowe, a former high school teacher, had carved a niche for himself at Sierra with his work on such Disney-licensed edutainment titles as Donald Duck's Playground, Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood, and The Black Cauldron, which he wrote, designed and programmed. In 1982, Sierra had released a text-only game on the Apple II titled Softporn Adventure (it was the only text adventure that was released by a company which had established its name on providing a graphical alternative to such games). In 1986, after Sierra lost a Disney license, Al Lowe suggested that Sierra should remake Softporn Adventure with the improved tools now at their disposal, and Ken Williams agreed. Lowe, who considered the original Softporn Adventure \\"a primitive, early effort\\", borrowed its basic structure and added a graphic game engine (Sierra's Adventure Game Interpreter made famous by 1984's King's Quest: Quest for the Crown), improvised humor, and an on-screen protagonist, Larry Laffer. Chuck Benton, creator of Softporn Adventure, is included in the Leisure Suit Larry's end credits, as the game's layout and puzzles are identical to those found in the earlier title. However, Lowe said that in Softporn Adventure \\"there were no characters in the game. There was no central character at all. There were almost no characters to the women. And so it was a real role-over. I think there's one line of dialogue that I kept of the original game and all the rest was fresh.\\" The game was co-designed and illustrated by Mark Crowe, creator of the Space Quest series, and co- programmed by Ken Williams. An accomplished jazz musician (The Lounge Lizards being a jazz band's name), Lowe also wrote the main theme music (called \\"For Your Thighs Only\\"), and some of his compositions appear in later entries of the series. The theme, inspired by Irving Berlin's 1929 song \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\", was composed within 20 minutes. Lowe said it \\"sounded so unusual, so different, so fresh compared to most computer game music, that I decided to write something with the same pep, simplicity, humor, and out-of- sync attitude.\\" Unsure of how the 1987 game would be received, Sierra's management chose to release it with no publicity or advertising budget. Due to the adult nature of the game, the game includes an age verification system consisting of trivia questions that Al Lowe assumed children would not know the answer to. As many of the questions are U.S.-centric, they risked frustrating non-American players. If played today, the questions also include out-of-date cultural references. (One question begins \\"OJ Simpson is...\\" and one wrong answer is \\"under indictment.\\") In the original AGI version, the age verification screen may be skipped by pressing Alt-X (in the 1991 remake, it is done by pressing Ctrl-Alt-X). A version of the game with VGA graphics and sound card audio appeared in 1991. Re-titled Leisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge LizardsLeisure Suit Larry 1: In the Land of the Lounge Lizards (VGA Version) , GameSpot and using the new game engine Sierra's Creative Interpreter, it was released in 1991 for the Amiga, DOS, and Macintosh platforms. For the first remake, Al Lowe served as director and designer, also helping to program the game, and Ken Williams became executive producer. Other key people included Stuart Moulder (producer), William R. Davis Sr. (creative director), William D. Skirvin (art designer), Mark Seibert (music director), Oliver Brelsford (lead programmer), and the music other than the theme song was composed by Chris Braymen. The suggested standard retail price of the 1991 version was $59.95, but Sierra offered owners of the original game an upgrade to the new game for $25.  Reception  Larrys sales were very poor at first, with only 4,000 copies sold upon its release. Many stores also refused to stock the game because of its adult content, which was subject to controversy. Some resellers refused to handle the game, while others refused to advertise it, and one refused to list the game on its list of best sellers. In effect, its first-month sales were lower than any new Sierra product launch in years. A Sierra employee quit and a potential employee refused to work on Larry. Lowe stated, \\"My initial reaction was that I had wasted six months of my life.\\" Word-of-mouth spread quickly, however, and by the year's end, the game became a commercial success, selling over 250,000 copies. It sold over 300,000 units in total. A significant number of the game's players were female. According to Sierra's marketing director John Williams, \\"Obviously lots of retailers were selling lots of Leisure Suit Larry, but no one wanted to admit it.\\" It also became widely pirated, including in the Soviet Union. According to Lowe, a film adaptation was considered and he was flown to Hollywood to demonstrate the game in person. Footage from the game was used in the 1990 music video for Sailor's song \\"The Secretary\\".Sailor: 'The Secretary' by Georg Kajanus on YouTube Sierra received what Williams described as a \\"deluge\\" of mail opposing its release of Larry after he wrote a series of articles for Computer Gaming World discussing his company and the industry's views on adult software. Leisure Suit Larrys success resulted in a line of sequels and spin-off titles. Combined sales of the Larry series surpassed 1.4 million units by March 1996. Macworld reviewed the Macintosh version of Land of the Lounge Lizards in 1987, stating that \\"At its best, Leisure Suit Larry surprises you with clever animations that make you laugh ... And at its worst, the game is offensive ... Larry's idea of an ideal mate is shallow even for a parody ... There are many examples of a fifties mentality that are meant to be satirical but just seem lame.\\" Macworld criticises Leisure Suit Larry's portrayal of women further, stating that it \\"contributes nothing to enlightened male attitudes towards women.\\" Macworld compares Leisure Suit Larry to Leather Goddesses of Phobos, expressing that Leather Goddesses is \\"raunchy and humorous\\" without Leisure Suit Larry's \\"retrograde\\" portrayal of women. Computer Gaming Worlds reviewer Roy Wagner (\\"a wholesome family man\\") stated that Larry \\"is a lot of fun to play and is very humorous ... with good graphics, good design, and good fun provided, who needs 'good taste'?\\" According to the review by Rob Steele of The Games Machine, the Atari ST version was entertaining and very enjoyable, even if \\"wholeheartedly sexist\\". Jason Simmons from Amiga Action opined that the 1991 remake's \\"advanced graphics and new control system have improved the game by a huge degree\\", but \\"without a hard drive it is slow and almost a chore to play\\" and those who played the original \\"will probably find the new edition a waste of time and little more than an exercise in pretty pictures.\\" In 2004, Adventure Gamers' Rob Michaud wrote: \\"Despite its weaknesses, it's a bona fide gaming classic, a must-play for adventure history buffs as well as those who just like risqué humor.\\" In 1988, Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards was given an award for the Best Adventure, or Fantasy/Role- Playing Program of 1987 by the Software Publishers Association. In 1991, PC Format placed the first three Leisure Suit Larry titles on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors wrote, \\"The three Larry games so far plumb new depths in computer entertainment — they're crude, suggestive, full of innuendo and double entendres and designed to appeal to the worst aspects of human nature — you'll love 'em.\\" In 1996, Computer Gaming World ranked it as the 69th best game of all time,CGW 148: 150 Best Games of All Time also ranking it as the fifth most funny computer game, and stating: \\"Base, sexist, sometimes scatological humor, with no concessions made to taste or sensibilities, this was the best of a funny series.\\"CGW 148: Top 15 Funniest Computer Games FHM included it on its 2011 list of six games \\"that shamelessly used sex to sell\\" but adding that it was actually \\"funny, well- crafted, and well-written\\" and \\"has become kind of like a cult classic among gaming fans.\\" In 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time, commenting: \\"A humor-filled adventure game that wasn't bashful about showing some skin?

His birth date and place of birth is not recorded. Øystein was probably born sometime between 1120 and 1130 on the farm or Råsvoll north of Trondheim in Verdal, Nord-Trøndelag. His father was known as Erlend Himalde. He was the grandson of Tørberg Arnesson (d. ca. 1050), who served as an advisor to several Norwegian kings and the great-grandson of Ulv Uspaksson (died 1066), who was a councilman under King Harald Hardrada.Torberg Arnesson(Store norske leksikon)Ulv Uspaksson (Store norske leksikon) He was educated at Saint-Victor, in Paris. As a priest he served as steward to King Inge Krokrygg of Norway. When Archbishop Jon Birgersson died 24 February 1157, King Inge appointed Eysteinn as the new archbishop.St. Eystein kyrkje i Bodø (Den katolske kirkes helgener) Ties with Rome Eysteinn then travelled to Rome, where his appointment was confirmed by Pope Alexander III in 1161. He returned to Norway in 1161 and attempted to strengthen the ties between Rome and the Norwegian Church. He established the communities of Augustinian canons regular and consecrated Saint Thorlak. Eystein Erlendson (www.trondheim.com) Involvement in Civil War King Inge’s reign fell within the start of the period known as the civil war era in Norway. Before Eysteinn could return to his seat, King Inge was killed by his nephew, Håkon Herdebrei. King Inge's supporters had rallied under the leadership of Erling Skakke with his son Magnus as candidate for king. Erling Skakke was married to Kristin, daughter of King Sigurd Jorsalfar. This was the first time the throne had passed to someone who was not a king's son. Håkon Herdebrei was defeated and slain in 1162; however, the possibility remained that another claimant would appear. In this situation, Bishop Eysteinn and Erling became natural allies. The Church had long wished to reform the Norwegian kingdom on a more European model. Especially it wanted an end to the tradition of having several co-kings, which in the past had often led to war and unrest. In addition Bishop Eysteinn wanted only legitimate sons to be eligible. By sponsoring Magnus Erlingsson, both these goals would be achieved. In 1163 the new law of succession (agnatisk suksesjon), was introduced. In return, Bishop Eysteinn crowned Magnus King of Norway. This was the first time such a ceremony had taken place in Norway. Eysteinn is thought to have written Passio Olavi, a hagiographical work written in the Latin language. This is about the history and work of St. Olaf II of Norway, with particular emphasis on his missionary work. The title is an abbreviation for Passio Et Miracula Beati Olaui, meaning Holy Olav's sufferings and miracles.

The anime series was produced by Nippon Animation and broadcast on NHK Educational TV from 1999 to 2000. It was licensed for North American release by Viz Media. This series has aired on Cartoon Network outside the United States. In the US, the San Jose market licensed KTEH aired the series in its English-subtitled version as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm-after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up in the 90s. Two manga series were also released: a two volume series by Asamiya and published in Ciao from 1999 to 2000; and a nine volume two-part series by Keiko Okamoto which was published by NHK Publishing. The second manga series was licensed in North America and translated into English by Tokyopop beginning in 2002. This series follows a basic magical-girl progression, and falls into many of the magical girl tropes common in the late nineties. The series is innovative amongst magical girl series in that Yui's powers all derive from not just the technology she uses, but are incorporated entirely into her on-line avatar, with no real powers granted outside of the network. Plot It is the year 2020 and computers have become an integral part of daily life for most people. However, a teenage girl Yui Kasuga is one of the few who cannot use computers at all, despite the fact that her father is a software developer. An evil computer called Grosser wants to take over the ComNet (what the Internet is called in Yui's time) and as the programs that have been developed to stop it (called \\"Correctors\\") need her help, she is sucked into the ComNet where she is recruited by a corrector called I.R., who gives her downloadable element suits that allow her to become the ComNet Fairy Corrector Yui who can fight Grosser's computer viruses. In the first season, the series revolves around the war against Grosser, and reveals the mysteries that surround the Correctors, their seemingly missing creator, and the relationship that he seems to have had with the corrupted computer. In the second season, Yui and the Correctors must fight with a mysterious virus who menaces the ComNet, and also cope with the mysterious Corrector Ai, a Corrector who tends to work on her own and seems to have her own agenda. The key to the mysteries seems to be a strange young girl who seems lost and may be related with the devastating virus appearances. Characters = Main = ;Yui Kasuga / Corrector Yui : :A high-school student of dubious academic skill, Yui has shown skill and growth over the series as she assumes the secret on-line identity of \\"Corrector Yui\\". While utterly incompetent when physically interfacing with computers, Yui in the virtual world is a tremendously powerful fighter, able to quickly undo damage and easily battle the strongest of Grosser's henchmen. Her optimistic view and her ability to cheer up others even at the worst moment (though sometimes she can be quite perky) was one of her greatest strengths, making her easily likeable by her peers and fellow Corrector programs. She also has an empathetic personality that helps her understand the nature of A.I. programs she meets on the net. She also has a good singing voice. She has aspirations to become a manga author and/or anime dubber. ;Haruna Kisaragi / Corrector Haruna / Dark Angel Haruna : :Yui's best friend. She has a polite, calm, and caring personality. Her intelligence and innate ability with computers makes her a perfect candidate for Corrector, as expected by Dr. Inukai. From the beginning she was supposed to be a Corrector, but I.R. confused her with Yui, thanks to Grosser's intervention. When Dr. Inukai was passing Corrector tasks and abilities to her, she got manipulated by Grosser, who turned her into Dark Angel Haruna, but she was eventually saved by Yui. In the 2nd season, she again returns as a Corrector to assist Yui, first when Yui got petrified by infected insects, and later, when she helps Yui until the end of the 2nd season. Curiously, she can use Element Suits more effectively than Yui. ;Professor Inukai : : is the creator of Correctors and Grosser. He attempts to stop Grosser by sending Correctors, but he is left comatose after Grosser intercepts him. His mind, incomplete and amnesiac, wanders the Net, seeing help and evading Grosser's henchmen. He eventually recovers and passes on his Corrector abilities to Yui. He helps her repair and build Element Suits, and provides a base of operations for the Correctors. ;Ai Shinozaki / Corrector Ai : :Shun's cousin. A dark and mysterious girl who becomes a Corrector on her own in the second season. Her bitter experience in the past seems to be the reason for her cold, apathic demeanor as a mask to protect herself. While at most times she does her job by mostly cold, no-nonsense efficiency, Yui's action sometimes force her to reconsider and help Yui. She became a Corrector to search for the \\"little girl\\", believing that she might be connected with her mother's coma. While at first she rather despised Yui, and considered her little more than a nuisance, in the end she admires her optimistic view of life, and her ability to cheer up others. =Family= ; : :Ai's cousin. An engineering/medical student, also Yui's love interest (which he is unaware of). Very skillful with computers and the ComNet, he is often helping Yui (albeit indirectly) in her task as Corrector. Later in the end of season one, he was abducted by Grosser, as bait to lure Yui and the other Correctors to battle him in his lair. ; : :Yui's father. A computer programmer. He loves Yui very much, and is always distressed when he sees Yui with another man (Shun). ; : :Yui's mother. An excellent cook, whose work is highly favored by Yui and her father. ; : :Ai's mother. A motherly figure whom Ai loves very much. Now she's comatose, thanks to an accident that severed the connection between her mind and body. Her mind is imprisoned by Ryo Kurokawa after she attempts to release the \\"missing little girl\\", thus causing an accident that kills Ryo and releases the girl into the ComNet. By the final episode, her consciousness is freed from ComNet and Azusa wakes up from her coma. ; :Ai's father. Deceased 10 years ago. He and Ai's mother originally belonged to the science team that created the ComNet. His death triggered Ai's attempt to mask her heart, at first to make her mother less worried. =Classmates and teachers= ; : : Haruna's love interest. His demeanor contrasts with Haruna, often making him a joke target by Yui and her peers, though he is a nice boy at heart. ; : :Yui's best friend. ; : :Yui's best friend. ; : :Yui's friend. ; : :Yui's friend. ; : :Yui's teacher. Though she's actually a good, supportive teacher, her childish personality can sometimes create trouble. =Correctors= Corrector software was developed to maintain and police the ComNet structure. As such, each piece of software concentrates on a specific task, and Yui must learn to integrate their skillsets to defeat Grosser's minions, and eventually, Grosser himself. ; : :Corrector Software No. 1, The Regulator. Yui meets him in a space adventure site (not unlike an MMORPG). He has the ability to practically stop time for a limited time, enabling him to move at light-speed velocity. His power in the Wind Element Suit makes Yui able to stop time for about 15 seconds, and if other Correctors (such as I.R.) borrow its power, the time can be strengthened to 30 seconds. He has a \\"hero-guy\\" type personality (treats Yui like a damsel in distress, said he didn't need a woman's help, always tries to go first without everyone's concern, tries to steal the spotlight every time, has some narcissistic streak, etc), which at first makes Yui tend to dislike him, and sometimes puts him at odds with the other Correctors, though he is actually a nice guy. ; : :Corrector Software No. 2, The Synchronizer. Not much is known about this Corrector, since he was lost at the beginning of the series. At the end of the first season it is revealed that he was corrupted and became the Corruptor program War Wolf. His ability is similar to Wolf (using fire bursts as weapons), and one of the Correctors that has excellent fighting abilities on his own. His power of fire can be bestowed to other Correctors, to let them access the Fire Element Suit. He has an emotional personality; he is the one that opposes Dr. Inukai's decision to transfer Corrector power from Yui to Haruna. Beagle infections force him to stay in War Wolf form for most of the 2nd season, reminding him of his bad deeds in the past, causing him to become rather explosive, and Yui's attitude doesn't help either (she always call him \\"Doggy\\" out of habit, which annoys him). ; : :Corrector Software No. 3, The Predictor. Yui meets her on a love fortune-telling site. Has ability to foresee the future. Her visions, though most of time accurate, can sometimes deviate, especially when she doesn't have enough data/knowledge about the subject (like when Yui hugged her, when her vision in which Yui shakes her hand, when they first meet, and when she is trapped in Rapunzel's tower on the fairytale simulation). Has wise, maternal personality. Her power enables Yui to access the Wind Element Suit and enables Yui to predict the enemies' movements and attacks. She often becomes a subject for Control's flirting, but thanks to her ability, she can evade most of it (leaving Control in distress). ; : :Corrector Software No. 4, The System Maintainer. Yui meets him on a rainforest like simulation. He has the ability to control nature, like water and plants. His power helps Yui to access the Water Element Suit, and she can control nature at will, using it as defensive, recovering, or offensive tools. He has a rebellious, childish personality, and dislikes anyone who desecrates nature, to the point of kidnapping everyone who litters on the rainforest simulation. When Yui meets him, he at first hates Dr. Inukai, whom he believed had left him, but he finally learns that Dr. Inukai actually loves him, just like the other Correctors, and left him there for his own safety. ; : :Corrector Software No. 5, The Repairer. She has the ability to heal damage, including Element Suit damage, and when she lends her power to Yui, Yui can perform a barrier in the Water Element Suit that can knock back attacks. She has a sweet, rather naive (to the point of perky), and polite personality. While she is not prone to fighting, her fighting style includes applying non-lethal force as much as possible (like using a \\"tickler machine\\" and bug spray), and also using a vast array of traps and gadgets (she is notoriously known among the other Correctors for this, she even dubbed herself the \\"Trap Princess\\"). All her antics and naivety especially disturbs Freeze (whom Rescue seems interested in). In the 2nd season, she fights using bandages from her halo, anti-Beagles spray, and can also detect virus sources by using a radar on her halo. ; : :Corrector Software No. 6, The Archiver. A pacifist old man who claims himself to be a \\"Peace Defender\\", who ironically has a knack for building destructive weapons. At first he disliked Yui for destroying the solitude he gained at the remote area he inhabited, but later he helped her drive away Grosser's Corruptors by lending her his power. His power enables Yui to access the Fire Element Suit, with the \\"Flame Bomber\\" projectile attack. A wise person, he always speaks what he feels is right, even if it makes conflict with the other Correctors. In the 2nd season, from his data, the villain cloned him to wreak havoc on the ComNet, giving the distraction they needed to carry out their plan. ; : :Corrector Software No. 7, The Compiler. Yui first met him, along with Peace, at a secluded area, separated from the main domain of the marine adventure simulation created by her father's company. A fat guy with a playful, sweet, almost childish demeanor. He likes Yui at first sight, because \\"she is cute\\". He has the ability to mimic practically anyone, and copy some abilities from the one he is mimicking. He is also the one with the biggest memory power out of all of the Correctors, and when he lends his power to Yui, Yui's power (and also her weight) in her Basic Element Suit changes greatly, and can also activate her Earth Element Suit. He's Peace's good friend. His ability to mimic others can sometimes be quite a nuisance for others, like when he teases Freeze by mimicking Rescue. ; : :Corrector Software No. 8, The Installer. The first Corrector Software Yui meets, I.R. always nags Yui about her duty as Corrector, sometimes making Yui annoyed to the end. He has a tendency to end his sentences with \\"Thank you\\". I.R. made a Basic Element Suit for Yui from a princess costume stored in an amusement park where her Dad works. I.R. can also access the Earth Element Suit, giving Yui a large physical power boost, making her on par with Jaggy. =Villains/Corruptors= ;Grosser : :Leader of the Corruptors. At first, he is a \\"good\\" program, created by Dr. Inukai to manage and maintain the vast-growing ComNet. His contact with Yui made him want to \\"live\\", and later, to create the world where he could \\"live\\". Dr. Inukai, who saw the change in Grosser, decided to create the Correctors, to restore him to his current status. When Dr. Inukai chooses Haruna as Corrector, Grosser, who was fascinated with (arguably \\"loved\\") Yui from the beginning, manipulated I.R. and set Dr. Inukai in accident, so that Yui would be the Corrector instead of Haruna. He even went as far as to turn Haruna into Dark Angel Haruna. In the last episode of the 1st season, he finally meets Yui, and in the form of Shun, he tries to convince Yui to let him use her body, to experience \\"true life\\". Yui could see through the disguise, and instead, she convinces him that he actually is a living being himself, capable of feeling happiness, pain, and sadness, and also others A.I. programs and Corruptors over the Net. She also stated that for the sake of others who love her, she can't just quit to become herself, though sometimes she is bitter and sad. Grosser, who finally sees the error of his ways, deletes himself along with the whole ComNet, sparing a pretty much-devastated Yui. But at last, with moral support from Haruna, she could use her power and reinitialize the whole ComNet again, along with all of the Corrector programs, Grosser, and the Corruptors, who were grateful to her. He has a weakness to sound with a specific frequency, a trait that Yui, Haruna, and Fina (the baby whale on the marine simulation) share that somehow could force him to return to his \\"normal\\" state. ; : :The only female Software on Grosser's team (up until Evil Haruna appears). She is probably the most ruthless and competent of all of Grosser's henchmen, at least until the too-naive-to-be-true Rescue appears. She has the ability to freeze anything. In the second season, after failing in many side-jobs, she finally accepts a job from a mysterious man to search for a young girl, who is \\"always present everywhere she's near\\". Later it was revealed that she has the innate ability to detect virus presence (which she didn't realize), and later was used by this mysterious man to search for the \\"missing little girl\\". It is noted that she got a big personality change in the 2nd season, from the cold, no-nonsense villain in the 1st season into a ditzy, much more cheerful and girly attitude in the 2nd season. In the series finale, she even got her own Corrector suit (dubbed \\"Corrector Freeze\\" by some fans). ; : :Despite his bulk size and his strength, Jaggy is (arguably) the most knowledgeable (though not the most talented) of all Grosser's henchmen. Most of his tactics including manipulating the environment to do his bidding (though most of it didn't do so well). Loves to read books. In the 2nd season, he became the library administrator, and seems to have some feelings for Freeze. ; : :Resembles a werewolf, he is one of Grosser's henchmen that prefers actual combat. He fights by using a light saber, and he has the ability to control fire. Yui called him \\"Doggy\\", much to his dismay. He has a somewhat honorable demeanor. He is, in fact, the lost corrector program Synchro, but this is unknown to him until near the end of the first season. Beagle infections in the beginning of the 2nd season have forced Synchro to stay in this form for the rest of the season. ; : :Armed with primarily a light saber and computer viruses, he (arguably) has the most intelligence compared to his other teammates. He isn't prone to actual combat, and prefers to use more scheming methods. His computer viruses can be used to corrupt other programs and make them do his bidding. In the 2nd season, he works as a virus computer researcher, whom with Yui and Haruna's help finally identifies the source of Beagles Virus. =Others= ;Feena or : :A baby whale from the Marine Adventure Net area of ComNet. ;Mysterious Man :This mysterious man is working in the fairytale simulation, as a performer for a \\"Sun, Wind and Traveler\\" story drama, as the traveler. He asks Freeze to search for the \\"missing little girl\\", claiming he wanted to return her home, with one condition; that she shouldn't talk about it with anyone. Behind his friendly demeanor, he was not beneath using cruel and dirty tactics to ensure his job was done (like cloning Peace at one point, or using a modified version of Beagle Virus). He promised a large sum of reward money for Freeze, stopping her from asking too much about the job. In the end, it is revealed he is just a mere pawn, controlled by another mastermind. At the end of the series, he helps Freeze to release the \\"missing little girl\\", and distracts Ryo, giving the Correctors a chance to reinitialize her. ; : :This red-haired young girl, with her teddy bear, is always present when the Beagle Virus appears. While she seems innocent and bears no harm, when emotionally pressured, and she sheds tears, her tears become the core for the Beagles virus. She is always searching for \\"sunflowers\\". Her picture was found within a storybook that belongs to Ai Shinozaki. Originally, she was created by Shintaro Ishikawa as a messenger for his daughter. Ryo took her, experimenting on her with many computer viruses (not unlike Lisa Trevor), and thus the Beagles Virus was created with her as the host. Her name is \\"Ai\\", same with Shinozaki Ai. The teddy bear she carries acts as her protector and backup. He is the one who stole Yui's newest ComCon and gave it to Ai instead. This girl can feel the emotions of others, which causes Ai to always lose her track, due to her heart's closure to others (which at first, she blamed on the ComCon, using logical deduction). ; : :He has dubbed himself as \\"the most despised man by ComNet and Shintaro Shinozaki\\". He is the true mastermind behind the Beagles Virus creation, whom he planned to use to destroy ComNet, and to form a new ComNet. He saw A.I. programs as tools, thus making him at odds with Inukai and Shinozaki, causing him to retire from the group. When Azusa Shinozaki attempted to release \\"Ai\\", he was killed by an accident that happened in his place, but his mind was keep intact in ComNet, interacting with the Beagles Virus. He didn't realize it until Prof. Inukai showed him the truth. In the end, Yui's finally able to reinitialize him in her Final Element Suit, and his final words were \\"At least... I can leave my hatred to humanity\\". Miscellaneous ;ComCon :This bracelet is used by every Corrector as access, communication, transformation, radar, transmitter and receiver device. Even without VR units, every Corrector can enter ComNet easily with this. While entering ComNet, for people outside they would be seen as sleeping, so others wouldn't notice. ;ComNet :This virtual world is the form of Internet in Yui's world. Everyone can access and experience worlds inside it, using VR units. Time goes 256 times faster in ComNet than in the real world (means, one second in the real word is approximately the same as 256 seconds (4 minutes, 16 seconds) in ComNet). However, being too long in ComNet can cause problems, because of fatigued body, causing symptoms which are dubbed as \\"ComNet Fever\\". That's why in regular VR units, there are failsafe programs that eject people automatically after 10 hours a day in ComNet. ComCon bracelets didn't have this feature, once causing Ai to get \\"ComNet Fever\\" when she stayed too long in the Net.  Media  =Manga= There are two versions of the Corrector Yui manga series.

The next day, Israeli-Arabs barricaded themselves in the Hassan Bek Mosque opposite the Dolphinarium site and threw objects at the police.14 лет со дня чудовищного теракта в тель- авивском \\"Дольфи\\" 01.06.2015 22:41, 9tv.co.il According to the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, an Israeli-based organization with close ties to the IDF, among the materials seized by the IDF in the course of Operation Defensive Shield were two documents issued by the Martyrs' Families and Injured Care Establishment, which is under the authority of the Palestinian National Authority's Ministry of Social Affairs. The documents detail the transfer of US$2,000 to the father of the suicide bomber, who was living in Jordan at that time (18 June 2001). According to the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center, the transfer was made despite the suicide bomber's Hamas affiliation, despite the father's public support of the suicide bombing attack, and despite Arafat's public condemnation of the bombing.  Dolphinarium site  After the bombing, the Dolphinarium discotheque was abandoned, covered with graffiti. It remained on the Tel Aviv beachfront until its demolition in May 2018. For many years, the victim's families campaigned to permanently preserve the ruined building as a monument to the attack. Eventually, the building was demolished in order to extend the promenade along the coast.[Decided the fate of Tel Aviv Dolphinarium Решилась судьба тель- авивского дельфинария] 27-12-2014, 01:30, ЛЕОНИД РАБИН Memorial services to the victims of the attack were held every year at the site by friends and family of the victims.14 лет со дня чудовищного теракта в тель-авивском \\"Дольфи\\" 01.06.2015 22:41, 9tv.co.il See also * Civilian casualties in the Second Intifada * Shevah Mofet – high school in Tel Aviv where seven of the killed teenagers and many of the injured studied * Israeli casualties of war * Palestinian political violence References External links *Tel-Aviv suicide bombing at the Dolphin disco, Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs; accessed 2 September 2015 * At Least 17 Dead In Tel Aviv Suicide Bombing, Times Daily, 2 June 2001 * At Least 17 Dead, 86 Wounded In Tel Aviv Beachfront Bombing, The Item, 2 June 2001 * Eyewitness accounts from the scene of the massacre, Ynet, 2 June 2001 (Hebrew) * Inside the mind of a suicide bomber, ABC News, 6 December 2001 * Devotion, desire drive youths to 'martyrdom', USA Today; 26 June 2001 * Driver of the Dolphinarium attack terrorist – charged with homicide, Ynet, 10 July 10, 2001 (in Hebrew) Suicide bombings in 2001 Terrorist incidents in Israel in 2001 Mass murder in 2001 Israeli casualties in the Al-Aqsa Intifada Massacres in Israel during the Israeli–Palestinian conflict Hamas suicide bombings Terrorist incidents in Tel Aviv 2000s in Tel Aviv Attacks on music venues Attacks on nightclubs June 2001 events in Asia Murdered Israeli children Building bombings in Israel ","title":"Dolphinarium discotheque massacre"},{"id":"2966274","text":"James Yeadon (10 December 1861 - 30 May 1914) was an English first-class cricketer, who played three times for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1888.

In 1994, DeGuerin was named Outstanding Criminal Defense Lawyer of the Year by the State Bar of Texas Criminal Justice Section.  Education  He earned a law degree in 1965 from the University of Texas at Austin and that same year, he was admitted to the State Bar.  Career  Early in his career (1971–1982), he was an associate with Percy Foreman. In 2005, he defended former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay in DeLay's defense against indictments for money laundering and conspiracy, brought by Texas prosecutor Ronnie Earle. DeGuerin, a Democrat, previously prevailed over Earle in a case involving misconduct charges against U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. DeLay was found guilty,Houston Chronicle, \\"DeLay files motion for retrial in money laundering case,\\" February 9, 2011 but the conviction was overturned on appeal.Tom DeLay verdict overturned by Texas appellate court , KHOU; September 19, 2013 He also represented bankers involved in fraud cases tied to the Enron collapse. He represented Waco, Texas leader David Koresh during Koresh's standoff with the FBI and the ATF agents. DeGuerin used a self-defense argument, and won, when he represented New York real estate heir Robert Durst, who admitted to killing and then dismembering the body of Durst's 71-year-old neighbor Morris Black, bagging the body parts and tossing them into Galveston Bay. DeGuerin once again represented Durst at his arraignment in New Orleans on March 16, 2015 for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000 (which arose out of the HBO miniseries special The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst). Other cases include participating in the Congressional impeachment hearing of U.S. District Court Judge Samuel B. Kent. He represented Celeste Beard, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, David Mark Temple, convicted of killing his wife, who was 8 months pregnant, Allen Stanford, and Billy Joe Shaver. He is an adjunct professor at The University of Texas School of Law, teaching criminal law.

From small well-kept row houses near the river to larger, two-story brick homes on top of the hill, housing in Hazelwood and Glen Hazel are varied and affordable. The communities of Glen Hazel and Hazelwood, which lie along the Monongahela River, once flourished with an abundance of hazelnut trees. Beautiful places to live in the nineteenth century, they attracted some of Pittsburgh's oldest and wealthiest families, who built magnificent homes there. But the coming of the railroad and industry changed the neighborhoods. The wealthy departed, and the \\"good life\\" was redefined, as working-class men and women moved in to tend the furnaces and the coke ovens. Hazelwood and Glen Hazel are two of the city's most ethnically-diverse neighborhoods. Glen Hazel and Hazelwood are family-oriented neighborhoods, with many of their community activities focusing on youth programs. The neighborhoods are noted for their numerous churches and the active roles they play in building community spirit and pride in their residents. Surrounding and connecting Pittsburgh neighborhoods Situated along the Monongahela River, most of Glen Hazel is bordered by Hazelwood and shares a small border with Squirrel Hill South to the northeast.

It is represented on the Pittsburgh City Council by the representative of District 5 (Corey O'Connor). It occupies ZIP codes 15227, 15207, and 15236. It is named after James H. Hays, who opened a coal-mining operation called Hays and Haberman Mines in 1828. Hays was first settled in 1789 when still part of Baldwin Township by John Smalls, who named the area Six Mile Ferry Village. The H.B. Hays and Brothers Coal Railroad was a narrow gauge railroad that ran from the coal mine along Streets Run to the coal tipple at Six Mile Ferry. The neighborhood was formerly the site of the Hays Army Ammunition Plant, built by the U.S. Navy in 1942. The plant was transferred to the Army in 1966, and during its heyday between World War II and the Vietnam War employed more than a thousand people. In 1970 the plant was put on standby status until disposition in 1988. In 1993 the site was donated to the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh. The closing of the plant has led to an enormous loss of population: in 1940 the population was 2,238, while in 2010 the population was only 362. History In 1901, the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Hays was formed from the northern of Baldwin Township. Annexation to Pittsburgh was completed on Jan. 7, 1929. Streets Run The Streets Run watershed is a beautiful yet flood-prone area of the city. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection first investigated the erosion occurring in Streets Run in 1956. There has been major flooding there in 1968 and 1980, and more recently in 1994, 1995, 1999 and 2000. Currently, there is a flood protection project in the works to remedy this situation which includes a concrete rectangular channel, wider banks, stormwater retention dams, and enforcement of existing regulations, such as those concerning the eroding CSX railroad line. Hays Woods Hays encompasses the area known as Hays Woods, a + woodland, the largest undeveloped tract of land in the city of Pittsburgh (even larger than Frick Park). Hays Woods is the best example of the city's natural environment and has six streams, including a waterfall. The area is home to nesting bald eagles. The parcel of land including Hays Woods was identified as a possible site for a thoroughbred racetrack and housing development after developer Charles Betters' application to strip mine the area was declined. In 2016, the parcel was signed over to the city of Pittsburgh and is slated to become the largest park in Pittsburgh.  Bald eagle nesting  After an absence of about two centuries, bald eagles were spotted in the Hays Neighborhood in January 2013 and were reported to the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The eagle pair produced a single fledgling in 2013, and three fledglings in 2014. The eagle presence produced a large amount of fanfare on the Great Allegheny Passage which provided people with a place to view the eagles.http://www.wildearth.tv/cam/pittsburgh-bald-eagles Surrounding communities Hays is bordered by the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Arlington to the north, St. Clair to the northwest, New Homestead to the east and Lincoln Place to the southeast.

History Knoxville Borough was incorporated on September 7, 1877, from that part of Lower St. Clair Township adjoining Beltzhoover and Allentown. Jeremiah Knox resided there in the early part of the nineteenth century, and established a fruit farm on the site. Strawberries grown at the farm were particularly well known. The location of Knoxville, on the second ridge from the Monongahela River, was a desirable location because it was shielded from the smoke emanating from the factories and mills of the South Side. Knox began to subdivide his farm for residential development in 1872. Knoxville became accessible from the South Side in the 1870s with the opening of an incline, the Mount Oliver Incline, and then by an electric railway, the Pittsburgh, Knoxville & St. Clair Electric Railroad, in 1888. Because of its desirable location and easy access to the South Side, Knoxville attracted many middle managers of the South Side mills as residents.

As part of the settlement of the War of the Spanish Succession that brought the House of Bourbon of France to the throne of Spain. Spain and France made a series of agreements that did not unite the two thrones, but did cooperate on defined bases.  The first Pacte de Famille, 1733 Philip V, first Bourbon king of Spain Elisabeth Farnese, Philip V's second wife, who exerted strong influence over her husband The first of the three Pacto de Familia was agreed on November 7, 1733 between Philip V of Spain and his nephew Louis XV of France, in the Treaty of the Escorial. The War of the Spanish Succession was fought to prevent a dynastic union of France and Spain; this meant despite their close family ties, the two countries were opponents in the 1718 to 1720 War of the Quadruple Alliance. When Cardinal Fleury became French chief minister in 1726, he sought a closer relationship with Spain. This was made easier by the birth of Louis' heir in 1729, which seemed to ensure the two would remain separate. Louis's wife, Maria Leszczyńska, was the daughter of Stanislaus I, former king of Poland, deposed by Augustus II in 1709. After Augustus's death in February 1733, Louis saw an opportunity to weaken Austria by backing his father-in-law to regain the throne. Philip, now married to his second wife, Elisabeth Farnese, wanted to regain Spanish territories in Naples and Sicily, ceded to Austria in 1714, in part so that Elisabeth's first-born son Charles, unlikely to succeed to the throne of Spain because he had two older half-brothers in line before him, would have territories to rule as king. Elisabeth Farnese had strong influence over her husband and tenaciously sought concessions from France that benefited Charles. Philip demanded that previous treaties affecting Italy would be abrogated and that a new treated would cede Naples, Sicily, and the Tuscan forts to Spain for Charles's benefit. The Spanish negotiator with Fleury, José Patiño, was successful, leading to the signing of the First Family Pact. Charles received the future Italian possessions, Elisabeth Farnese retained her patrimonial rights in Italy. In the event that Spain's restriction of British trade was attacked in response, France pledged to come to its defense. France received important trading rights with Spain, whose overseas empire in Spanish America was the source of vast amounts of silver flowing to the world and a lucrative market.John Lynch, Bourbon Spain, 1700-1808. Blackwell 1989, pp.137-38 This led to their participation in the War of the Polish Succession in 1733.Ward, 1909, p. 63 In the treaty, France also agreed to help Spain retake Gibraltar, which was lost to Britain in the War of the Spanish Succession, while Spain agreed to end commercial concessions given to Britain in 1714 at the expense of France. Neither of these conditions were fulfilled at this point but the tensions would eventually lead to the War of Jenkins Ear and the War of the Austrian Succession. Although Stanislas failed to regain the Polish throne, France acquired the strategic Duchy of Lorraine, while Philip won back Naples and Sicily for his son Charles.Ward, 1909, p. 64  The second Pacte de Famille, 1743  The second Family Compact was made on October 25, 1743 again by King Philip V of Spain and King Louis XV of France in the Treaty of Fontainebleau. This pact was signed in the middle of the War of Austrian Succession, and many of its clauses had to do with the conduct of the war. Philip's Queen Consort Elisabeth Farnese again sought Spain's expansion in Italy, this time to forward the interests of her second son, Philip. Spain sent two expeditions to Italy, and aided France in the conflict with Austria. Louis XV sought to tie Spain's interests closely to France's cause. Louis guaranteed the position of Charles as king of the Two Sicilies, install Philip as ruler of Milan, and remove the commercial constraints on Spain, following the treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession. Spain gained from the agreement, as did France, and Britain felt the danger of a closer Bourbon alliance and increased French participation in the transatlantic trade.Lynch, Bourbon Spain, pp. 140-41. The result was the expansion of Spanish influence in Italy when Philip V's fourth son Philip, became in 1748 Duke of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla.  The third Pacte de Famille, 1761  Louis XV of France Charles III of Spain The third Family Compact was made on 15 August 1761 by King Charles III of Spain and Louis XV in the Treaty of Paris, during the Seven Years' War, which had up to this point involved France but not Spain. Charles III was the son of Philip V, making him Louis's first cousin. Charles's alliance reversed the policy of his predecessor, Ferdinand VI, who wished to keep Spain out of the war. With Ferdinand's death in August 1759 his half-brother Charles, the oldest son of Elisabeth Farnese, ascended to the Spanish throne. He had already ruled the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies for nearly 25 years, during which time he experienced British naval aggression when a British squadron sailed into the Bay of Naples in 1742 to demand the kingdom's neutrality in the War of the Austrian Succession, and threatened naval bombardment if their demands were not met.Stanley J. Stein and Barbara H. Stein, Apogee of Empire: Spain and New Spain in the Age of Charles III, 1759-1789. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 2003, p.9 The Seven Years' War was going badly for the French, so the chief minister, Etienne François, duc de Choiseul pursued a dual track policy of attempting to bring Spain into a third pacte de famille or sue Britain and its allies for peace. Charles III was worried about the vulnerability of the overseas portion of his empire, and also worried that France would sell out Spain's interests in a peace with Britain. A formal alliance would prevent France concluding a peace unilaterally, so opted for the alliance with France, with the two Bourbon monarchies agreeing to settle the conflict with Britain in concert with each other. The pacte was to go into effect after the annual silver Spanish treasure fleet had arrived in Spain, signalling to the British that Spain intended on entering the conflict.Parry, J.H., Trade and Dominion: The European Overseas Empires in the Eighteenth Century. London: Phoenix Press 1971, pp. 124-126.Anderson, Fred. Crucible of War: The Seven Years' War and the Fate of British North America, 1754-1766. New York: Vintage Books 2000, p.484. The agreement involved Spain's allies Naples and Tuscany. For Spain, the third Pacte was a complete disaster and did not bring much aid to the French. In 1761, the British captured two vital ports for trade in the Spanish Empire, Havana, Cuba and Manila, the Philippines. The British Havana and Manila crippled Spanish transatlantic and transpacific routes. Worse was to follow from the alliance. Spain agreed to attack Britain's long standing Iberian ally Portugal and thus invaded in 1762 with a large army. British troops numbering near 10,000 supported the Portuguese, but in spite of three attempts the Spanish along with their French ally were decisively defeated, losing in total upwards of 25,000 men. With the current war lost, France as compensation to Spain ceded the rest of Louisiana to Spain at the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau. At the Treaty of Paris the following year Charles III was able to regain Havana and Manila, but ceded all of strategically located Florida to the British.  Later Franco-Spanish Pacts  * On April 12, 1779, France and Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez (1779) by which Spain joined the French-initiated war against Great Britain for territory that the two had lost in the Seven Years' War at the Treaty of Paris (1763) and earlier at the Treaty of Utrecht (1713-15) for Spain to reacquire Gibraltar. This treaty was seen as a renewal of the third Pacte de Famille and so was not named the fourth Pacte de Famille. * In August 1796, Manuel Godoy, first minister of Charles IV of Spain negotiated and signed the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso with France, which required Spain to declare war on Great Britain. This treaty can not be considered a Family Compact since all French Bourbons had either fled France or been executed killed during the French Revolution.

It is located northeast of downtown, and like many of the city's riverfront neighborhoods, it has an industrial past. The city considers Lawrenceville three neighborhoods, Upper Lawrenceville, Central Lawrenceville, and Lower Lawrenceville, but these distinctions have little practical effect. Accordingly, Lawrenceville is almost universally treated as being a single large neighborhood. In 2019, the Lawrenceville Historic District, which encompasses the majority of the neighborhood, was added to the National Register of Historic Places. History Lawrenceville was founded in 1814 by William B. Foster, father of composer Stephen Foster, who was born there in 1826. It is named for Captain James Lawrence, hero of the War of 1812, famous for his dying words, \\"Don't Give Up The Ship!\\" Lawrenceville was selected as home to the Allegheny Arsenal, due to \\"The area's accessibility to river transportation and its proximity to what was then the nation's only iron producing district\\". Incorporated as a borough on 18 February 1834, Lawrenceville was annexed to the city of Pittsburgh in 1868. One of the original buildings, a log home built in the 1820s, survived until July 2011 at 184 38th Street. As seen on older maps, two sizable islands once sat opposite Lawrenceville in the Allegheny river: Herrs Island (now known as Washington's Landing), which stretched from roughly 28th street to 37th street, and McCullough's Island (sometimes labeled Wainwright's Island or \\"Good Liquor\\" Island), which stretched from roughly 35th street to 40th street. Washington's Landing is named after an event in 1753 in which George Washington was thrown from his raft while crossing the Allegheny River and scrambled to safety on a nearby island. However, Washington did not actually land on Washington's Landing—he landed on McCullough's Island. Although Washington's Landing still exists, McCullough's Island, which sat much closer to the mainland, does not. It is not clear what happened to McCullough's Island. It is possible that it simply eroded away into nothing, or—considering how narrow the channel was between it and Lawrenceville—it might have been incorporated into the mainland. Present Lawrenceville's primary zip code is 15201, though a small section shares 15224 with Bloomfield and Garfield. The neighborhood is home to landmarks such as Allegheny Cemetery, Arsenal Middle School, Arsenal Park, and Doughboy Square. Lawrenceville maintains much of its industrial-era aesthetic, with narrow row houses and old warehouses lining streets and alleyways. The UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh opened a new facility in Lawrenceville on May 2, 2009, moving all patients from Oakland.Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC Completes Historic Move to Lawrenceville With Successful Patient Relocation Retrieved June 2, 2009 This addition has helped spawn Lawrenceville's transformation, bringing new job and business opportunities to the area. The New York Times has since called the neighborhood a \\"go-to destination.\\"\\"A Design District Takes Shape\\", Jeff Schlegel, The New York Times, October 14, 2007. Transplanted young hipsters and life-long Lawrenceville residents dwell side by side, as relatively affordable housing has attracted those looking to buy or renovate property. Lawrenceville is currently a premier art, live music, and dining hub of Western Pennsylvania. Butler Street is its main artery, housing a number of restaurants, bars, boutiques, furniture stores, and coffee shops. Some of the most popular dining locales include Industry Public House, Coca Cafe, Piccolo Forno, and the Church Brew Works, a brewery created from an old church on Liberty Avenue. In addition to food, drink, and retail, Lawrenceville is also home to Arsenal Lanes, a longstanding bowling alley with a full-stocked bar. In 2014, Row House Cinema opened up on Butler Street, a movie theatre that showcases popular classics and serves craft beer at the concession stand. Lawrenceville's nightlife scene has grown tremendously in recent years, as residents of surrounding neighborhoods and suburbs flock to bars and music venues. In 2015, the Moose Lodge at 242 51st street was transformed into Spirit Lodge, a multi-purpose venue with two bars, two dance floors, a main stage, and a pizza parlor. Opened by former employees of Brooklyn's Roberta's Pizza, the venue has become a hipster draw for Lawrenceville residents and visitors alike. In December 2014, Lawrenceville's popular Belvedere's Ultra- dive bar closed after a kitchen fire, but reopened in 2016 with new renovations. Lawrenceville hosts Pittsburgh's annual Art All Night, an event for amateur artists to showcase their work in a large warehouse, open for free and to the public. In April 2016, the 19th Art All Night event was held in a new location at the Arsenal Terminal Building at 39th and Butler Streets. Lawrenceville has experienced a real estate boom in recent years. In 2007, price appreciation was the second highest in the city, after the South Side, according to Carnegie Mellon University.\\"Real estate prices higher in some places\\", Tim Grant, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, November 2, 2007. In 2015, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported an increasingly high volume of developers looking to Lawrenceville to renovate properties for resale, also known as \\"flipping\\" houses, although such opportunities have become less lucrative as prices rise. Many homes now sell upwards of $200,000. As a result of this growth, Lawrenceville has been noted for its role in Pittsburgh's gentrification: once a working-class district, the neighborhood now caters to higher-earning buyers. Increases in construction and commercial enterprise have also led to a shortage of street parking, as hundreds of drivers try to squeeze their cars onto too-narrow streets. Despite all changes, Lawrenceville still maintains old traditions, such as an annual Memorial Day parade on Butler Street. Lawrenceville residents also show their appreciation for Pittsburgh history with \\"Doo Dah Days,\\" the Stephen Foster Music and Heritage Festival. Arsenal Park remains a popular recreation spot, hosting July 4 events each year, and the VFW center and Teamster Temple are active. Lawrenceville was used as a location for some scenes of the film Love & Other Drugs (2010), starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway. Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods Lower Lawrenceville has four land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Central Lawrenceville to the northeast, Bloomfield to the east, Polish Hill to the south, and the Strip District to the southwest. Across the Allegheny River, the Lower neighborhood runs adjacent with the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Troy Hill and Millvale with a direct link to the latter via 40th Street Bridge. Central Lawrenceville has five land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Upper Lawrenceville to the north, Stanton Heights to the east and northeast, Garfield to the southeast, Bloomfield to the south and Lower Lawrenceville to the southwest. Its adjacent neighborhoods across the Allegheny River include Millvale and Shaler Township. Upper Lawrenceville has three land borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Morningside to the east, Stanton Heights to the southeast, and Central Lawrenceville to the south and southwest.

The film was selected as the Slovenian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences The film takes place in the 1980 in the former Yugoslavia. It covers issues such as the former Yugoslav punk rock scene and drug use in the year when Josip Broz Tito died. The story begins in autumn 1979 when Sead Mulahasanović, whose father was a Warrant Officer (zastavnik) of Yugoslav People's Army moved to Ljubljana and started attending one of the local secondary schools. He immediately joined local punkers who formed a band. Because punk rock in Yugoslavia was not tolerated some of them quickly fell into trouble. Authorities were on high alert because Tito got seriously ill and was admitted to University Medical Centre Ljubljana. Sead spent a lot of time with his new friends because his father was devoted only to the army and wanted Sead to join the army school to become an officer or a pilot. Sead fell in love with Metka, a girl from his class, so he also began spending his time with her. Then several things occurred: one of his friends was beaten by the Police and put to prison, he was punished by his father for not being devoted enough to the ideas of socialism, Metka got pregnant and they were again forced to move, so Sead should leave his life behind and start it anew. He didn't hold out any more and committed suicide - coincidentally it happened on the day when Tito died. Outsider was the top grossing Slovenian film (91,000)Outsider.

Byas grew up as a farm in Yorkshire, having attended school at Scarborough College. He was a left- handed batsman who scored a Century, on the day his son (Ben) was born, and very occasionally bowled right-arm medium pace. He was appointed Yorkshire's captain at the start of the 1996 season, following the resignation of Martyn Moxon. In 2001, he led the county to their first County Championship title win for 33 years, sealing the championship with a catch taken at North Marine Road. In 1995, Byas was on the verge of an England call-up, having been the first player to reach 1,000 runs in that season, only the return to fitness of Michael Atherton and Graeme Hick, prevented him from doing so. In total he scored 1,913 runs in the whole campaign. His highest score of 213, was made at his home ground of North Marine Road, being one of only five players to achieve a double-hundred in the first-class game, at this stadium. Byas started his career in 1978, as a second-team player at Scarborough. However, he ultimately helped the club to the latter two of their five ECB National Club Cricket Championship titles (1981 and 1982) at Lord's. In 1984, he set a record in the now former Yorkshire League, by scoring 1,349 runs for the season, a record which stood for 19 years. Since retiring, Byas has been a manager and coach at Scarborough, in charge of cricket development at Pocklington School, a senior cricket advisor at Yorkshire, and runs his own cricket school, the 'Byas Academy'.

It is bordered by Woods Run Avenue on the north, Marshall Avenue on the south, and Riverview Park, Highwood Cemetery, and Uniondale Cemetery on the east. The neighborhood technically extends west to the Ohio River, but in practice the residential district ends at California Avenue. The area between California Avenue and the Ohio River is an industrial site and the home of the Woods Run Penitentiary, now known as State Correctional Institution – Pittsburgh.

The school is administered by the New York City Department of Education. It receives supplementary funding from The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History. Together with the Queens High School for the Sciences at York College and the High School for Math, Science and Engineering at City College, it was one of the three smaller specialized high schools opened in 2002 by the New York City Department of Education, and it is one of the 9 Specialized High Schools in New York City. Admission is granted through a competitive examination known as the SHSAT. As a public school, American Studies has no tuition fee, and only residents of the City of New York are eligible to attend. Admission to American Studies involves passing the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test. Each November, about 30,000 eighth and ninth graders take the 3-hour test for admittance to eight of the nine specialized high schools. Approximately 80-110 applicants are accepted each year. American Studies is located on the Lehman College campus in the Jerome Park section of the Bronx. It is ranked 56th in the country by U.S. News & World Report. Overview American Studies was designed as a small school for about four hundred students. It was created in 2002 along with Queens High School for the Sciences at York College, and the High School for Math, Science, and Engineering at City College. New York City previously had three specialized high schools, Brooklyn Technical High School, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant, besides LaGuardia High School for the Performing Arts. The three new schools were created to provide more opportunities for students beyond the previous three specialized high schools. Unlike the other specialized high schools, American Studies puts a special focus on history (particularly American History), and all students are required to study U.S History for 3 years, and take the AP US History Exam in May of the third year. Despite the school's emphasis on history, it also offers a variety of AP classes in other subject areas, such as Calculus. Students are required to take AP World History exam in the spring semester of junior year after taking the course from freshman to junior year. Junior and senior year students with free periods in their schedule have the opportunity to take college courses for college credits at Lehman College in addition to Advanced Placement course credits. =History= In 2008, American Studies was awarded a Gold Medal by U.S. News & World Report in its ranking of the Best Public High Schools. The school was ranked 29th, beating its rivals and fellow specialized high schools Bronx High School of Science, Brooklyn Technical High School, and Stuyvesant High School. In 2009, it climbed up 10 spots and was ranked as the 19th Best Public High School, claiming the top spot for all New York City High Schools and 2nd for all of New York State. In 2014, American Studies has held on to its Gold Medal by U.S. News & World Report and was ranked 32nd out of 22,000 public schools in the nation, making the school #1 in the state. In 2015, the school was ranked 11th nationally, making it #1 in the state for the second year. In 2016, the school was ranked 15th in the nation and #1 in the state of New York by U.S. News and World Reports. =Affiliations with Lehman College= As part of the new Specialized Schools that opened in CUNY campuses, American Studies students are granted permission into Lehman College campus to use the college library, gym, cafeteria, and occasionally the theater if the high school might need it for events such as plays. Students are given CUNY I.D. cards for access to the campus and for verification purposes. =Average SAT and ACT Scores= In 2019, the average SAT score for American Studies was 1400 and average ACT score was 32. Enrollment Admissions to High School of American Studies is solely based on the SHSAT, a competitive standardized test that permits entrance into Specialized High Schools. In recent years, the cut-off score, or the minimum score needed to gain entrance to American Studies, was 524. In September 2019, only 102 out of 30,000 students that applied were admitted into the school, making the acceptance rate 0.3%. High School of American Studies (HSAS) consistently ranks as among the top 100 high schools in the United States. Its most recent U.S. News and World Report ranking in 2019 puts HSAS at # 6 in New York State and # 56 in National Rankings. According to state test scores, 100% of students are at least proficient in math and 100% in reading.  Transportation  = Public transportation = Similarly to the modes of transportation available to Bronx Science students, the New York City Subway's Bedford Park Boulevard () and Bedford Park Boulevard–Lehman College () stations are located nearby. Additionally, New York City Bus's routes stop near HSAS. Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare or half-fare student MetroCards for public transportation. =Vallo Transportation= Vallo Transportation is a private bus service offered to High School of American Studies at Lehman College students and Bronx Science students.

It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts, an institution for ‘scientific exhibitions and for promoting discoveries in arts and manufactures’ opening on 18 March 1854. This venture went bankrupt inside two years and the was sold to E.T. Smith. It was renamed as the Alhambra Palace and in 1858 a circus ring was installed. Though the circus was successful, Smith converted the building to a dance hall and reopened as the Alhambra Palace Music Hall in December 1860. Music hall Spencer Gore, painted 1910-1911. Programme cover from The Bing Boys Are Here 1916. The Alhambra Theatre of Variety adopted some of the Parisian caf'conc style but became, in turn, a model for Parisian music halls. Some years before the Folies-Bergere it staged circus attractions alongside popular ballets in 55 new productions between 1864 and 1870. The Alhambra Theatre of Variety was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the début of Jules Léotard performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included \\"patriotic demonstrations\\" celebrating the British Empire and British military successes. The theatre also staged ballet and light opera. In the 1860s, John Hollingshead took over the management and made it famous for its corps de ballet. Early films were also a part of the entertainment, with Robert W. Paul, a former collaborator of Birt Acres, presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. A fire in 1882 destroyed the interior of the building. The reconstruction retained the original columns and arches but with a more theatrical appearance.

The Alhambra Theatre of Variety opened 3 April 1858. Inside the building a central rotunda. In 1897 the theatre was expanded and a second entrance was added on Charing Cross Road.

History Before the area that encompasses Morningside was annexed as part of the City of Pittsburgh in 1868, it was part of Collins Township. The area was mainly occupied by vegetable and dairy farms, which were run by about a dozen of settler families that ran the farms. The area remained mainly unchanged since its annexation to Pittsburgh until 1905 or 1906. This was the time when the Chislett Street trolley line was extended from Stanton Avenue into the neighborhood, bringing with it many families traveling from the East End/Highland Park towards Fox Chapel and Etna. The area was primed for development, and in a matter of years, upwards of 500 houses per year were being built as the farms were broken up by developers and sold. The neighborhood was fully filled with houses and some small commercial development by the 1930s.

It depicts an outdoor architectural setting similar to other works by de Chirico at this time. This time however, the main focus is a small wall on which is mounted a Greek sculpted head and a surgeon's glove. Below it is a green ball. On the horizon is the outline of a locomotive, an image that recurs several times during this period of de Chirico's career. Metaphysical Art Movement The Metaphysical Art Movement was created by Giorgio De Chirico and Carlo Carrà, who had previously been a Futurist. These paintings would depict Italian city squares that are unnaturally void of people. These city squares would often include a grouping of objects that provide a strange juxtaposition. With these driving elements in his paintings, Giorgio De Chirico created a dreamlike reality that was beyond the physical world.\\"Metaphysical Art – Art Term.\\" Tate.

He is a long-time member of the government, having served as Minister of Commerce of Somali Republic, among other Cabinet positions. During the 1980s, he also acted as Chairman of the Somali National Movement. Standing as an opposition candidate, he was elected as President of Somaliland in Somaliland's 2010 presidential election. Background =Personal life= Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud Silanyo was born in 1936 in the mideastern town of Burco, situated in what was then the former British Somaliland protectorate. Nicknamed \\"Silanyo\\", he hails from the Habar Jeclo subclan of the Isaaq. Ahmed M. Mohamoud Silanyo is the third child of four. His father was a merchant marine; so, the family lived a half-nomadic, half-settled lifestyle. He was the only child in the family to attend a formal education, fostered by an uncle who was a strong influence on his early life. His brothers followed their father's footsteps as merchant marines. He is Muslim. He met his wife, Amina-Weris Sh. Mohamed, in the late 1960s. Like him, she completed her education as a registered nurse and midwife in England. She is one of the pioneers of Somali's educated women. They married in Mogadishu in 1968. She has been a strong partner, by his side throughout the long and turbulent times of his political career. They have five children and seven grandchildren. =Education= Between 1946 and 1957, Mohamoud studied at schools in Sheekh and Amud, where he completed his secondary levels. Upon graduation, he moved to England to pursue higher studies. From 1958 to 1960, Mohamoud enrolled in London University and obtained an advanced General Certificate of Education (GCE). He then studied at University of Manchester, where he earned both a Bachelor's Degree (1960–1963) and a Master's Degree (1963–1965) in Economics. Political career =General= In a professional capacity, between 1965 and 1969, Mohamoud served as an official at the Ministry of Planning and Coordination in Mogadishu during Somalia's early civilian administration. He was also the national Minister of Planning and Coordination (1969–1973), Minister of Commerce (1973–1978 and 1980–1982), and the Chairman of the National Economic Board (1978–1980) in the succeeding socialist government. Although a member of Siad Barre's cabinet for many years, he was believed to not be involved in any acts of violence and embezzlement. Therefore, allowing him to satisfy both the government and opposition at the time, paving way for his chairmanship of the Somali National Movement. Ahmed Mohamed Mohamoud \\"Silanyo\\" From 1984 to 1990, Mohamoud was the Chairman of the Somali National Movement (SNM), serving as the liberation group's longest-serving chairman. Between 1993 and 1997, Mohamoud was a member of the House of Representatives of Somaliland. He also worked as the Somaliland Minister of Finance from 1997 to 1999, in which position he initiated a program of fiscal reform. Between 1999 and 2000, Mohamoud served as Somaliland's Minister of Planning and Coordination, a position from which he resigned in 2001. =Prominent Seminars, Symposia, Conferences= During his years of public service, Mohamoud participated in a broad array of forums relating to a variety of developmental aspects of the world. Notably, utilizing training programs under the auspices of the United Nations (United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the Economic Commission of Africa (ECA)), as well as benefiting from a Leadership Grant organized by the African-American Institute that related to developmental fields, including visits to various regional state and federal governmental bodies throughout the United States. ;Conferences attended * United Nations, Organization of African Union (OAU) * The Arab League * Islamic and Non-Aligned Movement Conferences * Somalia congress in diaspora on behalf of Somalia government ;Leader of Somalia delegation * UN Special Sessions, New York, NY, USA * OAU, Arab League, European Economic Commission (EEC), and the ministerial meetings of the African, Caribbean, and Pacific Group of States (ACP). * The 1976 Non- Aligned Conference, Lima, Peru * United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Nairobi, Kenya, 1977 =Roles during the Somaliland Nationhood Government= 1982–1984: Chairman of Somali National Movement (SNM), UK Branch During the earlier years of the SNM, Mohamoud established offices and organized SNM committees throughout Europe, North America, and the Arab world to raise international awareness of the liberation movement and the brutality of Somalia's Siyad Barre regime against its own people through presentations to international human rights groups, the press media, various European government bodies, including the British Parliament and the European Inter-Parliamentary Union, and relevant organizations in the Arab and Islamic world. To further accomplish this, Mohamoud embarked on a program of recruitment of important personalities and groups in southern Somalia to join the SNM movement—a 1982 through 1991 Somali liberation faction founded and led predominantly by Isaaq members to protect the national interests of the Somalilanders against the oppressive Siyad Barre regime. Having successfully toppled the Siyad Barre regime in 1991, the SNM had been pivotal in reconstituting the Republic of Somaliland that on 1 July 1960, united with Somalia. Presently, Somaliland is a sovereign democratic country, but is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia. 1984–1990: Chairman of Somali National Movement (SNM) During the following years Mohamoud would become the SNM's longest-serving Chairman, in command throughout the most tumultuous, expansive, and decisive period of the liberation movement. In 1984, the SNM was in its infancy, having been established only two years earlier. The struggle was nebulous. This period was being steered through its most trying times. Its most momentous events occurred in October 1984 with the first major, simultaneous, and coordinated invasion of the SNM troops into the mountainous regions of Somaliland and its major expansion of SNM fronts in the southern and northwest regions of Awdal and the Northwest. With tensions rising, a 1986 accord negotiated in Jabuuti between the Siyad Barre regime of Somalia and Mengistu Haile Miriam of Ethiopia to end the support of the respective rebellions against their regimes had for all intent and purposes entailed the dismemberment the SNM. Having lost its Ethiopian sanctuary, as a consequence of this agreement, in May 1988, the SNM waged a historically daring invasion on Togdheer and Northwest regions of Somaliland. With this secretly and meticulously planned attack—a shocking surprise to both Siyad Barre and Mingeste Haile Miriam regimes – SNM fighters easily took Burao (Burco) and Hargeisa (Hargeysa) cities. Although the SNM was finally pushed out of the two cities, the lightning attack proved to be the deathblow of the Siyad Barre regime. The end result being the peaceful transfer of power, in a spirit of unity, at the 1990 SNM Congress – a lasting peace that survives today. 1990–1996: Re-establishing Somaliland's sovereignty While attending the Congress of Somaliland (Burao, May 1991), Mohamoud acted as a key player in re-establishing Somaliland's sovereignty as an independent state. In 1992, he initiated, and then organized, the famous Forum for Peace that generated a cease-fire agreement between the warring parties in the so-called Xarbal Aqnaam War in the port city Berbera and its environs. From 1993 through 1996, he would act as a Member of Somaliland House of Representatives. During this time, in 1996, he initiated a reconciliation movement that brought about an end to the internal conflict at Beer – 18 miles southeast of Burao (Togdheer Region), where a formal agreement of cessation of hostilities and an exchange of prisoners would be finalized. 1997–1999: Minister of Finance In 1997, Mohamoud had change roles, becoming the Minister of Finance for Somaliland devising and implementing a viable solution to stem out the runaway inflation threatening the economy of Somaliland. Further, shifting focus to the military, he sought to resolve the vexing problem of rationed supplies to the armed forces and begun to initiate a program for fiscal reform. 1999–2000: Minister of Planning and Coordination Changing roles once more, Mohamoud began to act as the Minister of Planning and Coordination for Somaliland, working to establish mechanisms for the coordination of aid programs between the government and foreign-aid donors. He initiated the formulation of a three-year development plan, organized a first of its kind and well-attended international conference on aid for Somaliland held in Hargeisa, attended and addressed the Somalia Aid Coordination Body (SACB) in Nairobi, Kenya – as the first-ever Somaliland Government Minister to do so, and lead a Somaliland government delegation that met with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) representatives in Nairobi, Kenya. 2000–2002: Mediator and various other roles During the period of working with Somaliland's 2nd president, President Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal, Mohamoud played important and decisive roles as a mediator in preventing crisis with respect to incidents relating to the relationship between Djibouti and Somaliland, Somaliland and Ethiopia, SNM veterans and the Egal administration, and between the Somaliland House of Representatives and the Egal government. He would spend, however, a period overseas, delivering speeches and addressing communities of the Somaliland diaspora in Europe and the United States raising awareness on the achievements and developments of the county. Upon his return to Somaliland he immediately mounted a campaign toward the resolution of a looming national crisis between the Egal administration and its political opponents, a crisis which came close to starting afresh a new round of internal conflict. 2002–2010: Founder and chairman of the Kulmiye Party and its presidential candidate The youngest political organization in the country, the Kulmiye Party was established in early 2002 with a focus on conveying the campaign's platform to the countryside and rural regions. Notably, Mohamoud pursued a no smear campaign policy toward other political parties, thus conducting a peaceful election, while applauding public education on the merits of the multi-party system and the democratic process. However, Mr. Mohamoud lost the election by a mere 80 votes to President Dahir Rayaale Kahin. Despite this setback, Mohamoud would be a supporting for the women's voices in Somaliland, as the Kulmiye Party was the only party to appoint a woman as Vice-Chair. During the next elections, Mohamoud was rewarded by garnering the largest national votes, only less than the total votes the incumbent party obtained during the previous presidential election. Through his stewardship, the Kulmiye Party has grown to be the largest party in Somaliland. Despite the ruling party's continuous hold to power after its term expired, and its unwillingness to hold free and fair elections, Mohamoud continued to pursue political change through the democratic process by working closely with traditional elders and the international community, whose interest is peace and stability in the Horn of Africa. Thus, when he ran as the Kulmiye Party candidate for president he was able to defeat incumbent President Dahir Rayaale Kahin of the United Peoples' Democratic Party (UDUB) in the 2010 presidential election. 2010–2017: Fourth president of the Republic of Somaliland Mr. Mohamed's term ended with the presidential election of 13 November 2017, which had been delayed from 28 March 2017. A snapshot of some of the salient achievements of the Silanyo Administration are depicted in the next section. President of Somaliland Henry Bellingham in London (2011). =The Silanyo administration currency stabilization= One of the first policy implementations of the administration was the introduction of the Somaliland Shilling to the entire country. Prior to this time, the old Somalia Shillings were honored in the eastern regions of the country. In 2011, President Silanyo issued an executive order, and passed by Parliament, making the Somaliland Shilling the legal tender of the country. =Major infrastructure improvements= Construction of offices for many of the country's twenty-four ministries, since the 1991 government ministries were housed in ill-suited offices built in a different era by the British colonial administration for fewer administrative departments. The Silanyo Administration budgeted and implemented construction of offices for many of the ministries that were in inadequate facilities. The administration not only repaired or rebuilt roads connecting major towns, but also built roads leading to small towns in the country side. Furthermore, the Administration encouraged and helped partially fund community based road construction. More importantly however, the government started building a 240-mile (384 km.) tarmac road linking Burao (Burco) City to the provincial town of Erigavo (Ceerigaabo), the capital of Sanaag Region in the east of the country. As part of the infrastructure improvement, the administration enlarged and enhanced security of Egal International Airport, in Hargeisa, and Berbera Airport. Enacted legislation that made primary education free. Implemented new rank and salary systems for the armed forces, the national police, and the Custodial Corps. =Water development program= Because there are no perennial rivers and rainfall is unreliable, water is a highly precious commodity in Somaliland. Water supply systems throughout the country are, therefore, dependent on underground sources. Cognizant of the recurring droughts and inadequate water supply systems of cities and towns, the Silanyo Administration introduced a water development policy. The central policy of the Administration's water development program is, inter alia, drilling bore holes and damming dry – river beds that drain water into the sea during the two rainy seasons. In order to realize such policy achievements, the administration embarked on expanding, through additional drilling, the water supply systems of the six major towns: Hargeisa, Borama, Berbera, Burao, Las Anod, and Erigavo. In particular, to alleviate the chronic water shortage in the capital city, Hargeisa, the administration drilled more wells and installed bigger and rust resistant pipe lines in the Geed Deeble water works and is damming the Humboweyne (Xumboweyne) dry river, north east of Hargeisa. The administration intends to establish a grid work of wells throughout the country as well as damming as many of the numerous dry-bed rivers emanating from Golis Range that otherwise empty into the sea. =Joint venture with Dubai Port World (D P World) for the management of Berbera Port= The administration has entered into a joint venture agreement with Dubai Port World (DP World) whereby D.P World for thirty years takes over the management of Berbera Port; builds a 400-meter new terminal with a container section, Free Trade Zone, and rehabilitates the old port. In addition, the United Arab Emirates has agreed to build a 250 km (156 mile) road connecting Berbera and the border town of Wajaale. These major agreements enhance the capacity of the port and employment opportunities, but more importantly enable trade to flourish between Somaliland and Ethiopia's population of 102 million.

It is one of the four enclaves surrounded by the Eastern Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, a British Overseas Territory, administered as a Sovereign Base Area. The others are the village of Ormidhia and Dhekelia Power Station. It is administered by the internationally recognized government of Cyprus, the Republic of Cyprus. Until 1917, Xylotymbou belonged administratively to Famagusta District and since then it belongs in Larnaca District. It is located in the middle of Makrasyka, Achna, Ormidia, Dhekelia, Pyla, and Pergamos. It is a new village. Until 1821, there were no residents. The Hadjiyiorkis was one of the first inhabitants of the village. When he was married in 1840, the village had only seven houses. In the old days, the village must have been inhabited again. The ancient caves of pre-Christian era, the churches and the smallest, old church of Agios Andronikos from the Byzantine period were built in the same place where the new church of Agios Andronikos and Athanasia was later built. In ancient times, the village, along with Ormideia, Panayia of Traseias, Augorou, Xylofagou, Liopetri, Agia Napa, and Pyla Cape were the thrones of a kingdom that was destroyed by an earthquake and pillaging barbarian invaders. The tower in Xylofagou was an observatory of the time for detection of corsairs conquerors. In Great Cyprus Encyclopaedia Costas Christofides says that the antiquities smuggler Luigi Palma di Cesnola (1865-1876), and American consul in Cyprus, discovered a carved wooden grave with wonderful carving representations of Aphrodite and Artemis in 1882 (hence, the name Xylotymbou (Wooden Tomb)). The elders of the village said that the place where the tomb was is the place where Agios Andronikos and Athanasia church was built between 1890-1900 and where the builders took and used the stones from the grave. Residents of Xylotymbou are engaged in agriculture and trade. Many residents work in the British Sovereign Base in Dhekelia and in the tourism industry in Ayia Napa, Protaras, and Larnaca. Xylotymbou is famous for its many small churches/chapels (about 10) and, in particular, the majestic monastery of St Raphael, Nicholas, and Irene. In 2006 with the cooperation of the two clubs (Laikes Organosis Xylotymbou and Kimon Xylotymbou) founded a united football team, the P.O. Xylotymbou.

It is intended to resocialize, reform, and rehabilitate offenders. The penal system is operated by the Correction Bureau of the Ministry of Justice. Procedure On confinement, prisoners are first classified according to gender, nationality, type of penalty, length of sentence, degree of criminality, and state of physical and mental health. They are then placed in special programs designed to treat their individual needs. Vocational and formal education are emphasized, as is instruction in social values. Most convicts engage in labor, for which a small stipend is set aside for use on release. Under a system stressing incentives, prisoners are initially assigned to community cells, then earn better quarters and additional privileges based on their good behavior. Administration The Correctional Bureau of the Ministry of Justice administers the adult prison system as well as the juvenile correctional system and three women's guidance homes (to rehabilitate prostitutes). The ministry's Rehabilitation Bureau operates the probation and parole systems. Prison personnel are trained at an institute in Tokyo and in branch training institutes in each of the eight regional correctional headquarters under the Correctional Bureau. Professional probation officers study at the Legal Training and Research Institute of the Ministry. The prison guards in Japan do not carry firearms but can activate an alarm where specialized armed guards will come. There can be as low as one prison guard supervising 40 inmates while they are working. Prison population In 1990, Japan's prison population stood at somewhat less than 47,000; nearly 7,000 were in short-term detention centers, and the remaining 40,000 were in prisons. Approximately 46% were repeat offenders. Japanese recidivism was attributed mainly to the discretionary powers of police, prosecutors, and courts and to the tendency to seek alternative sentences for first offenders. By 2001 The overall prison population rose to 61,242 or 48 prisoners per 100,000. By of the end of 2009, the prison population had yet again risen to 75,250, or 59 prisoners per 100,000. One reason for the rise is a large increase in the number of elderly being convicted of crimes, with loneliness being cited as a major factor. In 2016, there were 18,462 male prison inmates and 2,005 female prison inmates. Juvenile offenders Although a few juvenile offenders are handled under the general penal system, most are treated in separate juvenile training schools. More lenient than the penal institutions, these facilities provide correctional education and regular schooling for delinquents under the age of twenty. More adults are in prison than child delinquents, mainly because of the low crime rate. In Japan, juvenile prisoners are defined as people less than 20 years of age. All juvenile cases are first sent to a family court, where the judge may decide that the juvenile be tried by the ordinary court (as an adult). Juveniles not tried by an ordinary court are detained in juvenile training schools (typical juvenile correctional institutions); these prisoners represented 2,872 at the end of 2014. The 52 Juvenile institutions are under the responsibility of the prison administration. Minors under 18 years of age cannot be sentenced to the death penalty. Juvenile prisoners make up 4.5% of the prison population. Aftercare treatment According to the Ministry of Justice, the government's responsibility for social order does not end with imprisoning an offender, but also extends to aftercare treatment and to noninstitutional treatment to substitute for or supplement prison terms. A large number of those given suspended sentences are released to the supervision of volunteer officers under the guidance of professional probation officers. Adults are usually placed on probation for a fixed period, and juveniles are placed on probation until they reach the age of twenty. Foreign inmates The number of crimes committed by foreigners significantly decreased in recent years from 43,622 in 2005 to 15,276 in 2016. Most common offenses committed by foreigners were theft (60% of their Penal Code offenses), Immigration violations (66% of non- Penal code offenses), and drug offenses in 2016. The number of convicted foreign prisoners was 3,509 in 2016. Yet, most of them were given suspended sentences and only 744 were imprisoned in the same year. The largest group was thieves (122 persons) and the second largest was drug offenders (96 persons). Use of volunteers Volunteers are also used in supervising parolees, although professional probation officers generally supervise offenders considered to have a high risk of recidivism. Volunteers hail from all walks of life and handle no more than five cases at one time. They are responsible for overseeing the offenders' conduct to prevent the occurrence of further offenses. Volunteer probation officers also offer guidance and assistance to the ex-convict in assuming a law-abiding place in the community. Although volunteers are sometimes criticized for being too old compared with their charges (more than 70 percent are retired and are age fifty-five or over) and thus unable to understand the problems their charges faced, most authorities believe that the volunteers are critically important in the nation's criminal justice system. Claims of inmate rights abuses Amnesty International has cited Japan for abuse of inmates by guards for infractions of prison rules. This abuse is in the form of beatings, solitary confinement, overcrowding, or \\"minor solitary confinement\\" (keiheikin), which forces inmates to be interned in tiny cells kneeling or crossed legged, and restrained with handcuffs for prolonged periods of time. In 2003, Justice Ministry formed a special team to investigate 1,566 prisoner deaths from 1993 to 2002. A preliminary report suggested that nearly one-third of the cases involved suspicious circumstances. However, in June, the Ministry announced that there was evidence of abuse only in the two Nagoya fatalities. Regarding the other suspicious deaths, the Ministry said that approximately 10 deaths could be attributed to poor medical care. The authorities reported they had lost the documentation on nine deaths in Tokyo's Fuchu Prison. The remaining deaths were determined to be \\"not suspicious.\\"United States Department of State In the wake of prison abuses, the \\"Law Concerning Penal Institutions and the Treatment of Sentenced Inmates\\" came into effect on June 7, 2007, to reform treatment on prisoners,http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2007/06/26/reference/prison- reforms-seen-as-too-little-and-way-too- late/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/legalinfo/arrest/prison_inmates.htmlhttp://www.moj.go.jp/ENGLISH/issues/issues06.html such as \\"the expansion of prisoners' contacts with the outside world, the establishment of independent committees to inspect prisons, and the improvement of the complaints mechanisms.\\"http://www.hurights.or.jp/archives/focus/section2/2012/06/detention- centers-and-prisons-in-japan.html However, the Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) expressed concerns in 2010 about revalidating unlimited solitary confinements (along with newer types of handcuffs for such inmates), not providing medical care for inmates under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, and mental and physical effects of confinement for death row inmates. In the article “’Prison Libraries’ in Japan: The Current Situation of Access to Books and Reading in Correctional Institutions\\" Kenichi Nakane talks about another form of prisoner neglect/abuse. Nakane's article finds that there is a severe lack of reading materials available to people who are incarcerated in Japanese correctional facilities. The author Kenichi Nakane uses the term “Prison Library” because there are no professionally ran libraries inside of any of the correctional facilities. Nakane finds that incarcerated persons can only get books, newspapers, and magazines by buying them and/or getting them as gifts. Nakane found that occasionally a limited number of reading materials are supplied, but they are out dated and inadequate. Nakane also finds the lack of reading material and availability of information in these incarceration facilities to be hindering some of the rights of the incarcerated individuals. To further investigate this problem, Kenichi Nakane traveled to twenty-six prisons in America and seven prisons in the United Kingdom and found that the availability of books, and information to incarcerated individuals in Japan was very limited compared to US and UK prisons.https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/18744, Illinois School of Information Science, Access Date: November 24, 2017 Penal institutions Japanese \\"penal institutions\\" include prisons for sentenced adults, juvenile detention centers for sentenced juveniles, and detention houses for pre-trial inmates.\\"General Outline of Japanese Adult Corrections.\\" Penal Institutions in Japan .

For example, the Fuchu Prison (Tokyo) and Yokohama Prison (Kanagawa) receive inmates that have advanced criminal inclination with sentences shorter than 10 years, e.g. prisoners affiliated with crime organizations. The Chiba Prison received inmates without advanced criminal inclination and who do not have sentences longer than 10 years, e.g. murder without the possibility of repeating a crime again. Ichihara Prison (Chiba) is specialized for traffic offenders, e.g. repetitive offenders and those who killed others while driving.

(http://www.news-leader.com/article/20120525/LIFE/305250007/) Tom Whitlock was born and raised in Springfield, Missouri. He won the Academy Award in 1986 for the song \\"Take My Breath Away\\" (performed by Terri Nunn of the band Berlin) in the movie Top Gun - one of the five songs written for the movie by Whitlock and Giorgio Moroder. \\"Danger Zone\\" performed by Kenny Loggins was Whitlock and Moroder's other hit from Top Gun. Career Whitlock was born and raised in Springfield, Missouri. Many famous musicians visited the city as it hosted television show Ozark Jubilee, influencing Whitlock to play drums. Soon, he was a session musician working with notable composers like Wayne Carson, as well as a drummer for live bands. At the age of 15, Whitlock begun writing songs at the piano.Back to the 80s: Interview with Tom Whitlock, co-writer of 'Take My Breath Away' & more – Kickin' it Old School During his high school years at Glendale High School, in Springfield, Missouri, he divided his time between studying during the day and playing drums with rock bands on the weekends throughout the Midwest. He entered Drury University in 1971 to major in music. The university honored him as Distinguished Alumni in 1998, and with an honorary doctorate in music the following year.Alumni Spotlight: Tom Whitlock '76A Drury degree three decades in the making In 1983, Whitlock travelled to Los Angeles, California, planning to start a band there. While helping his friend Dave Concors at the now defunct studio Davlen Sound Studios, Whitlock met famed composer Giorgio Moroder as he complained about brake defects in his Ferrari. Whitlock purchased some cans of brake fluid and proceeded to fix Moroder's car. Moroder eventually hired Whitlock for work at his studio. In the meantime, he studied recording with Moroder's engineer Brian Reeves, given the studio was busy with films such as Scarface, Flashdance and Beverly Hills Cop, and wrote his own songs. Prior to the production of the Top Gun soundtrack, Moroder found his songwriting partners Keith Forsey and Pete Bellotte unavailable, and knowing Whitlock was a lyricist invited him for the project. Whitlock and Moroder co-wrote five songs for Top Gun including \\"Take My Breath Away\\" and the Kenny Loggins hit \\"Danger Zone\\". ASCAP shows 113 songs registered, performed by artists such as Berlin, Bonnie Tyler, Jennifer Rush, Michael McDonald, Ray Charles, Graham Nash, Diana Ross, Teddy Pendergrass, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle. Whitlock and Moroder had other collaborations, for the films Over the Top, American Anthem and Rambo III, and also co-wrote the official theme songs for both the 1988 Summer Olympics (\\"Hand In Hand\\") and the 1990 FIFA World Cup (\\"To Be Number One\\"). In 2012, the Library of Congress honored Whitlock for his songwriting contributions.Library of Congress to Honor Springfield Native's Contribution to American Music Whitlock is also drummer of the Missouri band, The Dog People, with Michael Granda (aka Supe Dujour), Jim Wunderle, and Terry Wilson.

Section 30 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a section that, like other provisions within the section 25 to section 31 block, provides a guide as to how Charter rights should be interpreted and applied by Canadian courts. Section 30's particular role is to address how the Charter applies in the territories of Canada. In 1982, when section 30 first became law, these were the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory. The Yukon Territory has since been renamed Yukon,Yukon Act, SC 2002, c 7 (http://laws- lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-2.01/FullText.html). and Nunavut was created from the eastern Northwest Territories to become Canada's third territory.Nunavut Act, SC 1993, c 28 (http://laws- lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.6/FullText.html); Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (http://nlca.tunngavik.com/?lang=en). Section 30 and by extension, the Charter applies to Nunavut. Text The section reads, Function As the government of Canada puts it on one of its websites, this means that \\"[t]he Charter applies to the Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut in exactly the same way as it does to the provinces.\\" Hence, section 30 is particularly important in regard to section 3, 4, 5, 6 and 23 rights. Since section 6 refers to rights to \\"move to and take up residence in any province\\" and to \\"pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province,\\" section 30 is applied so that section 6 also guarantees rights to move to and pursue work in the territories of Canada.Canadian Egg Marketing Agency v Richardson, [1998] 3 SCR 157 at para 121, McLachlin J (as she then was), dissenting. Likewise, section 30 extends section 23's guarantee of minority language educational rights for minority language groups in the provinces to minority language groups in the territories.Hogg, Peter W. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto, Canada: The Carswell Company Limited, 1982. Section 30 also guarantees that territorial governments are bound by sections 3 to 5, which themselves only explicitly refer to provincial governments. Hence, those in the territories will have the right to vote or run in territorial elections (section 3), territorial governments cannot operate for longer than 5 years without an election (section 4), and territorial governments must sit at least once a year (section 5).Friends of Democracy v Northwest Territories (Commissioner), 1999 CanLII 4256, 171 DLR (4th) 551 (NWT SC) at paras 5-6 (cited to CanLII). The other rights in the other sections of the Charter are also valid and enforceable in the territories. The authority of the territorial governments is derived from the Parliament of Canada.Constitution Act, 1871 (UK), c 28, s 4; Northwest Territories Act, enacted by SC 2014, c 2, s 2; Nunavut Act, SC 1993, c 36; Yukon Act, SC 2002, c 7. Paragraph 32(1)(a) provides that the Charter applies \\"to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories\\". Read together, section 30 and paragraph 32(1)(b) provide that the Charter applies \\"to the legislature and government of each province [and territory] in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province [and territory]\\". The content of section 30 dates back to the original draft of the Charter, which was published in October 1980. Judicial interpretation In the case Fédération Franco-ténoise v. Canada (C.A.) (2001), the Federal Court of Appeal discussed section 30 when it rejected the government of the Northwest Territories' claim that the territory now had legal power and independence similar to those of the provinces. (The purpose of this claim was to avoid the obligations of providing official language rights under the Charter, which the federal government has to do but no provinces besides New Brunswick have to do). The territorial government based its theory in Parliament's treatment of the territories, which was becoming more like how it treated the provinces. Some of Parliament's laws had been designed so that they would not be applicable in the territories. Moreover, section 30 created another similarity between the provinces and territories. However, the Court replied that section 30 of the Charter creates similarities between provinces and territories only in regard to the reading of the Charter. Moreover, section 31, which stipulates that the Charter does not increase powers of legislative bodies, indicates section 30 cannot increase the powers of the territorial legislature to the extent that a territory can achieve equality with the provinces. However, the Court also rejected the claim by those who had brought legal action against the territorial government that section 30 is limited by section 32; together these two sections simply mean that the Charter applies to all territorial laws.Fédération Franco-ténoise v. Canada (C.A.) [2001] 3 F.C. 641. Office of the Commissioner for Federal Judicial Affairs. URL accessed 10 April 2006. Earlier, in 1983, similar arguments were made to achieve section 20 rights in the Yukon, so that traffic tickets could be available in the French language. It was argued sections 30 and 32 should together indicate such rights exist in the territories. The courts dismissed the argument since a literal reading of section 20 shows it bounds only the federal government (and New Brunswick), not the territorial governments.Smyth, Steven. \\"Colonialism and Language in Canada's North: A Yukon Case Study.\\" Arctic, vol. 49, no. 2 (June 1996), page 156.

According to its civic association, it \\"includes portions of the municipalities of Pittsburgh, Edgewood, Swissvale and Wilkinsburg\\". It is also the name of one of the 90 neighborhoods within the City of Pittsburgh's limits, which leads to some confusion among residents. In 2017, it was named the #1 neighborhood to live in Pittsburgh and the #17 best neighborhood in the United States by Niche.com. The neighborhood is split between ZIP codes 15218 and 15221; the part of the neighborhood within the City of Pittsburgh is represented on the City Council by the council seat for District 5 (Southeast Neighborhoods). Despite its division among four municipal governments and three school districts, Regent Square's identity bolstered by an active community association. Geography also helps to give Regent Square a distinct identity: the neighborhood is a roughly rectangular plateau bounded on three sides by the steep valleys of Fern Hollow Creek to the west and Nine Mile Run to the south and east. The tree-lined neighborhood is situated along both sides of Braddock Avenue between the Parkway East (I-376) and Forbes Avenue. The area of the present neighborhood was owned by a series of local landowners, including Col. Dunning McNair in the late 18th and Judge William Wilkins in the late 19th century. The name Regent Square was apparently bestowed by William E. Harmon of Harmon Realty, who in 1919 acquired most of the present neighborhood, then known as the Devon Plan. First calling it Regent Place, he later changed the name to Regent Square. By the mid-20th century, Regent Square was a quietly prosperous garden suburb characterized by middle and upper-middle income residents, a significant number of whom were managerial or professional employees of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. The neighborhood at that time had a distinctly Irish ethnic character, still evident in the names of several businesses along Braddock Avenue. At the turn of the 21st century Regent Square, like much of Pittsburgh's East End, had come to be characterized by a large proportion of upper-middle class professionals associated with the city's medical and educational institutions. These residents share the neighborhood with a significant number of students and younger singles attracted to its proximity to Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, the Frick Park, and readily available mass transit to downtown Pittsburgh. Regent Square's grid street plan and Victorian and 'Tween-Wars architecture, with houses built close to each other and porches close to the tree-lined sidewalks, tend to promote a sense of community rare in less densely built modern suburban neighborhoods. As a result, both residents and visitors often remark on the sense of living in a village, a sense which is accentuated by the geographical isolation of the neighborhood, cut off as it is from surrounding districts by Frick Park to the west and north and the valley of Nine Mile Run to the south. Surrounding neighborhoods Regent Square has six borders, three with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Point Breeze to the north, Squirrel Hill South to the west, and Swisshelm Park to the south. The other three borders are with the boroughs of Swissvale to the southeast, Edgewood to the east, and Wilkinsburg to the northeast. Community Organizations Although a small neighborhood, Regent Square is home to a number of active community centers and organizations: * Regent Square Business, Real Estate, Neighborhood, and Message Boards * Environmental Charter School at Frick Park * Frick Park Clay Court Tennis Club * Nine Mile Run Watershed Association * Pittsburgh Filmmakers (Regent Square Theater) * Regent Square Civic Association * Wilkins School Community Center * R^2 Athletics Association Local Libraries Two libraries reside in adjoining neighborhoods, the C.C.

It is attributed to Bishop Guy of Amiens, a noble of Ponthieu and monastically- trained bishop and administrator close to the French court, who eventually served as a chaplain for Matilda of Flanders, William the Conqueror's queen. Guy was an uncle to Count Guy of Ponthieu, who figures rather prominently in the Bayeux Tapestry as the vassal of Duke William of Normandy who captured Harold Godwinson in 1064. History and background The Carmen is generally accepted as the earliest surviving written account of the Norman Conquest. It focuses on the Battle of Hastings and its immediate aftermath, although it also offers insights into navigation, urban administration, the siege of London, and ecclesiastical culture. It is in poetic form, 835 lines of hexameters and elegiac couplets, and is preserved only in two twelfth-century copies from St Eucharius-Matthias in Trier, Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 10615-729, folios 227v-230v, and Bibliothèque royale de Belgique MS 9799-809 (the latter containing only the last sixty-six lines).R. H. C. Davis, \\"The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio,\\" The English Historical Review 93 (1978): 241-261 (253). The Carmen was most likely composed within months of the coronation of William as king of England (Christmas Day, 1066)—probably sometime in 1067, possibly as early as Easter of that year, to be performed at the royal festivities in Normandy, where King William I presided. The motivation for the poem's production and performance is open to debate. Queen Matilda may have commissioned the Carmen as an entertainment and to memorialize her husband's conquest, as queens customarily commissioned works of history composed by clerics and Guy d'Amiens was known in the court of her father, Count Baldwin V of Flanders, where the bishop had witnessed a charter in 1056 with Earl (later King) Harold, Count Guy of Ponthieu, and Count Eustace of Boulogne. This theory is suggested by the work praising the allies from France, Boulogne, Ponthieu, Brittany, Maine, and the new Norman kingdom in Apulia, Calabria and Sicily. All the allies would have attended the Easter celebrations for the sharing-out of war booty. In 1066 Bishop Guy may have sought to win royal esteem, possibly damaged by the involvement of Hugh of Ponthieu in the death of King Harold and the senior family's attempts to assassinate the young duke in childhood. Bishop Guy himself was out of favour with the pope, and it has been suggested that he wanted to garner some Norman influence by writing the Carmen in William's honor and inviting Lanfranc of Pavia, abbot of Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen and later archbishop of Canterbury (to whom the Proem of the poem is dedicated) to use his influence with king and pope. A further possibility (though none of these are mutually exclusive) is that Guy composed the Carmen to present Eustace, Count of Boulogne, in a favourable light in order to reverse King William's banishment of Count Eustace following his failed invasion of England in the autumn of 1067 (Eustace remained in fact out of favour until late in the 1070s). The Carmen possesses exceptional historical importance as an early account of the Norman Conquest. It is the most vivid of the original written accounts and practically the only one to give a non-Norman point of view in detail. The Bayeux Tapestry is problematic; the identity and purpose of its creators is unknown, though it bears evidence of English involvement in its production. In fact, it is the Carmen's very vividness which has caused it in the past to come under attack as either a forgery, fraud or at the least a later, 12th-century source. Frank Barlow argued that the Carmen was most likely from the year 1067, and following Elisabeth van Houts's arguments in her article \\"Latin Poetry and the Anglo- Norman Court 1066-1135: The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio,\\" this is the commonly accepted scholarly opinion.Elisabeth van Houts, \\"Latin Poetry and the Anglo- Norman Court 1066-1135: The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio,\\" Journal of Medieval History 15 (1989): 39-62. The Carmen is notable for literary reasons, too. It describes the Norman Conquest in terms borrowed from classical and Carolingian epic and praise poetry but in ways that contrast with other contemporary praise poets. The ironic application of classical and Carolingian language to William sows doubt about his faithfulness and piety (two core political values for the Carolingians and the Capetians). This indicates that the contradictions and early weaknesses of William's conquest and regime were already apparent in 1067, even as Guy could praise William for his achievement.Thomas O'Donnell, \\"The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio and the Poetics of 1067,\\" Anglo-Norman Studies 39 (2017): 151-162.

Diabetes mellitus type 1 results when the pancreas no longer produces significant amounts of the hormone insulin, usually owing to the autoimmune destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas. Diabetes mellitus type 2, in contrast, is now thought to result from autoimmune attacks on the pancreas and/or insulin resistance. The pancreas of a person with type 2 diabetes may be producing normal or even abnormally large amounts of insulin. Other forms of diabetes mellitus, such as the various forms of maturity onset diabetes of the young, may represent some combination of insufficient insulin production and insulin resistance. Some degree of insulin resistance may also be present in a person with type 1 diabetes. The main goal of diabetes management is, as far as possible, to restore carbohydrate metabolism to a normal state. To achieve this goal, individuals with an absolute deficiency of insulin require insulin replacement therapy, which is given through injections or an insulin pump. Insulin resistance, in contrast, can be corrected by dietary modifications and exercise. Other goals of diabetes management are to prevent or treat the many complications that can result from the disease itself and from its treatment.  Overview  = Goals = The treatment goals are related to effective control of blood glucose, blood pressure and lipids, to minimize the risk of long-term consequences associated with diabetes. They are suggested in clinical practice guidelines released by various national and international diabetes agencies. The targets are: * HbA1c of less than 6% or 7.0% if they are achievable without significant hypoglycemia * Preprandial blood glucose: 3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L (70 to 130 mg/dl) * 2-hour postprandial blood glucose: <10 mmol/L (<180 mg/dl) Goals should be individualized based on: * Duration of diabetes * Age/life expectancy * Comorbidity * Known cardiovascular disease or advanced microvascular disease * Hypoglycemia awareness In older patients, clinical practice guidelines by the American Geriatrics Society states \\"for frail older adults, persons with life expectancy of less than 5 years, and others in whom the risks of intensive glycemic control appear to outweigh the benefits, a less stringent target such as HbA1c of 8% is appropriate\\". =Issues= The primary issue requiring management is that of the glucose cycle. In this, glucose in the bloodstream is made available to cells in the body; a process dependent upon the twin cycles of glucose entering the bloodstream, and insulin allowing appropriate uptake into the body cells. Both aspects can require management. Another issue that ties along with the glucose cycle is getting a balanced amount of the glucose to the major organs so they are not affected negatively. =Complexities= Daily glucose and insulin cycle The main complexities stem from the nature of the feedback loop of the glucose cycle, which is sought to be regulated: * The glucose cycle is a system which is affected by two factors: entry of glucose into the bloodstream and also blood levels of insulin to control its transport out of the bloodstream * As a system, it is sensitive to diet and exercise * It is affected by the need for user anticipation due to the complicating effects of time delays between any activity and the respective impact on the glucose system * Management is highly intrusive, and compliance is an issue, since it relies upon user lifestyle change and often upon regular sampling and measuring of blood glucose levels, multiple times a day in many cases * It changes as people grow and develop * It is highly individual As diabetes is a prime risk factor for cardiovascular disease, controlling other risk factors which may give rise to secondary conditions, as well as the diabetes itself, is one of the facets of diabetes management. Checking cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglyceride levels may indicate hyperlipoproteinemia, which may warrant treatment with hypolipidemic drugs. Checking the blood pressure and keeping it within strict limits (using diet and antihypertensive treatment) protects against the retinal, renal and cardiovascular complications of diabetes. Regular follow-up by a podiatrist or other foot health specialists is encouraged to prevent the development of diabetic foot. Annual eye exams are suggested to monitor for progression of diabetic retinopathy. =Early advancements= Late in the 19th century, sugar in the urine (glycosuria) was associated with diabetes. Various doctors studied the connection. Frederick Madison Allen studied diabetes in 1909–12, then published a large volume, Studies Concerning Glycosuria and Diabetes, (Boston, 1913). He invented a fasting treatment for diabetes called the Allen treatment for diabetes. His diet was an early attempt at managing diabetes. Blood sugar level Blood sugar level is measured by means of a glucose meter, with the result either in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter in the US) or mmol/L (millimoles per litre in Canada and Eastern Europe) of blood. The average normal person has an average fasting glucose level of 4.5 mmol/L (81 mg/dL), with a lows of down to 2.5 and up to 5.4 mmol/L (65 to 98 mg/dL). Optimal management of diabetes involves patients measuring and recording their own blood glucose levels. By keeping a diary of their own blood glucose measurements and noting the effect of food and exercise, patients can modify their lifestyle to better control their diabetes. For patients on insulin, patient involvement is important in achieving effective dosing and timing. =Hypo and hyperglycemia= Levels which are significantly above or below this range are problematic and can in some cases be dangerous. A level of <3.8 mmol/L (<70 mg/dL) is usually described as a hypoglycemic attack (low blood sugar). Most diabetics know when they are going to \\"go hypo\\" and usually are able to eat some food or drink something sweet to raise levels. A patient who is hyperglycemic (high glucose) can also become temporarily hypoglycemic, under certain conditions (e.g. not eating regularly, or after strenuous exercise, followed by fatigue). Intensive efforts to achieve blood sugar levels close to normal have been shown to triple the risk of the most severe form of hypoglycemia, in which the patient requires assistance from by-standers in order to treat the episode. In the United States, there were annually 48,500 hospitalizations for diabetic hypoglycemia and 13,100 for diabetic hypoglycemia resulting in coma in the period 1989 to 1991, before intensive blood sugar control was as widely recommended as today. One study found that hospital admissions for diabetic hypoglycemia increased by 50% from 1990–1993 to 1997–2000, as strict blood sugar control efforts became more common. Among intensively controlled type 1 diabetics, 55% of episodes of severe hypoglycemia occur during sleep, and 6% of all deaths in diabetics under the age of 40 are from nocturnal hypoglycemia in the so-called 'dead-in-bed syndrome,' while National Institute of Health statistics show that 2% to 4% of all deaths in diabetics are from hypoglycemia. In children and adolescents following intensive blood sugar control, 21% of hypoglycemic episodes occurred without explanation. In addition to the deaths caused by diabetic hypoglycemia, periods of severe low blood sugar can also cause permanent brain damage. Although diabetic nerve disease is usually associated with hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia as well can initiate or worsen neuropathy in diabetics intensively struggling to reduce their hyperglycemia. Levels greater than 13–15 mmol/L (230–270 mg/dL) are considered high, and should be monitored closely to ensure that they reduce rather than continue to remain high. The patient is advised to seek urgent medical attention as soon as possible if blood sugar levels continue to rise after 2–3 tests. High blood sugar levels are known as hyperglycemia, which is not as easy to detect as hypoglycemia and usually happens over a period of days rather than hours or minutes. If left untreated, this can result in diabetic coma and death. A blood glucose test strip for an older style (i.e., optical color sensing) monitoring system Prolonged and elevated levels of glucose in the blood, which is left unchecked and untreated, will, over time, result in serious diabetic complications in those susceptible and sometimes even death. There is currently no way of testing for susceptibility to complications. Diabetics are therefore recommended to check their blood sugar levels either daily or every few days. There is also diabetes management software available from blood testing manufacturers which can display results and trends over time. Type 1 diabetics normally check more often, due to insulin therapy. A history of blood sugar level results is especially useful for the diabetic to present to their doctor or physician in the monitoring and control of the disease. Failure to maintain a strict regimen of testing can accelerate symptoms of the condition, and it is therefore imperative that any diabetic patient strictly monitor their glucose levels regularly. =Glycemic control= Glycemic control is a medical term referring to the typical levels of blood sugar (glucose) in a person with diabetes mellitus. Much evidence suggests that many of the long-term complications of diabetes, especially the microvascular complications, result from many years of hyperglycemia (elevated levels of glucose in the blood). Good glycemic control, in the sense of a \\"target\\" for treatment, has become an important goal of diabetes care, although recent research suggests that the complications of diabetes may be caused by genetic factors or, in type 1 diabetics, by the continuing effects of the autoimmune disease which first caused the pancreas to lose its insulin-producing ability. Because blood sugar levels fluctuate throughout the day and glucose records are imperfect indicators of these changes, the percentage of hemoglobin which is glycosylated is used as a proxy measure of long-term glycemic control in research trials and clinical care of people with diabetes. This test, the hemoglobin A1c or glycosylated hemoglobin reflects average glucoses over the preceding 2–3 months. In nondiabetic persons with normal glucose metabolism the glycosylated hemoglobin is usually 4–6% by the most common methods (normal ranges may vary by method). \\"Perfect glycemic control\\" would mean that glucose levels were always normal (70–130 mg/dl, or 3.9–7.2 mmol/L) and indistinguishable from a person without diabetes. In reality, because of the imperfections of treatment measures, even \\"good glycemic control\\" describes blood glucose levels that average somewhat higher than normal much of the time. In addition, one survey of type 2 diabetics found that they rated the harm to their quality of life from intensive interventions to control their blood sugar to be just as severe as the harm resulting from intermediate levels of diabetic complications. In the 1990s the American Diabetes Association conducted a publicity campaign to persuade patients and physicians to strive for average glucose and hemoglobin A1c values below 200 mg/dl (11 mmol/l) and 8%. Currently, many patients and physicians attempt to do better than that. As of 2015 the guidelines called for an HbA1c of around 7% or a fasting glucose of less than 7.2 mmol/L (130 mg/dL); however these goals may be changed after professional clinical consultation, taking into account particular risks of hypoglycemia and life expectancy. Despite guidelines recommending that intensive blood sugar control be based on balancing immediate harms and long-term benefits, many people – for example people with a life expectancy of less than nine years – who will not benefit are over- treated and do not experience clinically meaningful benefits. Poor glycemic control refers to persistently elevated blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, which may range from 200 to 500 mg/dl (11–28 mmol/L) and 9–15% or higher over months and years before severe complications occur. Meta- analysis of large studies done on the effects of tight vs. conventional, or more relaxed, glycemic control in type 2 diabetics have failed to demonstrate a difference in all-cause cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke, or limb amputation, but decreased the risk of nonfatal heart attack by 15%. Additionally, tight glucose control decreased the risk of progression of retinopathy and nephropathy, and decreased the incidence peripheral neuropathy, but increased the risk of hypoglycemia 2.4 times. Monitoring A modern portable blood glucose meter (OneTouch Ultra), displaying a reading of 5.4 mmol/L (98 mg/dL). Relying on their own perceptions of symptoms of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia is usually unsatisfactory as mild to moderate hyperglycemia causes no obvious symptoms in nearly all patients. Other considerations include the fact that, while food takes several hours to be digested and absorbed, insulin administration can have glucose lowering effects for as little as 2 hours or 24 hours or more (depending on the nature of the insulin preparation used and individual patient reaction). In addition, the onset and duration of the effects of oral hypoglycemic agents vary from type to type and from patient to patient. =Personal (home) glucose monitoring= Control and outcomes of both types 1 and 2 diabetes may be improved by patients using home glucose meters to regularly measure their glucose levels. Glucose monitoring is both expensive (largely due to the cost of the consumable test strips) and requires significant commitment on the part of the patient. Lifestyle adjustments are generally made by the patients themselves following training by a clinician. Regular blood testing, especially in type 1 diabetics, is helpful to keep adequate control of glucose levels and to reduce the chance of long term side effects of the disease. There are many (at least 20+) different types of blood monitoring devices available on the market today; not every meter suits all patients and it is a specific matter of choice for the patient, in consultation with a physician or other experienced professional, to find a meter that they personally find comfortable to use. The principle of the devices is virtually the same: a small blood sample is collected and measured. In one type of meter, the electrochemical, a small blood sample is produced by the patient using a lancet (a sterile pointed needle). The blood droplet is usually collected at the bottom of a test strip, while the other end is inserted in the glucose meter. This test strip contains various chemicals so that when the blood is applied, a small electrical charge is created between two contacts. This charge will vary depending on the glucose levels within the blood. In older glucose meters, the drop of blood is placed on top of a strip. A chemical reaction occurs and the strip changes color. The meter then measures the color of the strip optically. Self-testing is clearly important in type I diabetes where the use of insulin therapy risks episodes of hypoglycemia and home- testing allows for adjustment of dosage on each administration. Its benefit in type 2 diabetes has been more controversial, but recent studies have resulted in guidance that self-monitoring does not improve blood glucose or quality of life. Benefits of control and reduced hospital admission have been reported. However, patients on oral medication who do not self-adjust their drug dosage will miss many of the benefits of self-testing, and so it is questionable in this group. This is particularly so for patients taking monotherapy with metformin who are not at risk of hypoglycaemia. Regular 6 monthly laboratory testing of HbA1c (glycated haemoglobin) provides some assurance of long-term effective control and allows the adjustment of the patient's routine medication dosages in such cases. High frequency of self-testing in type 2 diabetes has not been shown to be associated with improved control. The argument is made, though, that type 2 patients with poor long term control despite home blood glucose monitoring, either have not had this integrated into their overall management, or are long overdue for tighter control by a switch from oral medication to injected insulin. Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) CGM technology has been rapidly developing to give people living with diabetes an idea about the speed and direction of their glucose changes. While it still requires calibration from SMBG and is not indicated for use in correction boluses, the accuracy of these monitors is increasing with every innovation. The Libre Blood Sugar Diet Program utilizes the CGM and Libre Sensor and by collecting all the data through a smartphone and smartwatch experts analyze this data 24/7 in Real Time. The results are that certain foods can be identified as causing one's blood sugar levels to rise and other foods as safe foods- that do not make a person's blood sugar levels to rise. Each individual absorbs sugar differently and this is why testing is a necessity. = HbA1c test = A useful test that has usually been done in a laboratory is the measurement of blood HbA1c levels. This is the ratio of glycated hemoglobin in relation to the total hemoglobin. Persistent raised plasma glucose levels cause the proportion of these molecules to go up. This is a test that measures the average amount of diabetic control over a period originally thought to be about 3 months (the average red blood cell lifetime), but more recently thought to be more strongly weighted to the most recent 2 to 4 weeks. In the non-diabetic, the HbA1c level ranges from 4.0 to 6.0%; patients with diabetes mellitus who manage to keep their HbA1c level below 6.5% are considered to have good glycemic control. The HbA1c test is not appropriate if there has been changes to diet or treatment within shorter time periods than 6 weeks or there is disturbance of red cell aging (e.g. recent bleeding or hemolytic anemia) or a hemoglobinopathy (e.g. sickle cell disease). In such cases, the alternative Fructosamine test is used to indicate average control in the preceding 2 to 3 weeks. =Continuous glucose monitoring= The first CGM device made available to consumers was the GlucoWatch biographer in 1999. This product is no longer sold. It was a retrospective device rather than live. Several live monitoring devices have subsequently been manufactured which provide ongoing monitoring of glucose levels on an automated basis during the day. = m-health monitoring Applications = The widespread use of smartphones has turned mobile applications (apps) into a popular means of the usage of all forms of software As a consequence, the use of mobile apps in managing people's health and supporting their chronic conditions is receiving popularity, especially among healthcare systems, which are showing a great tendency toward using these apps to integrate patient-generated data into electronic health records, and to modify and improve treatment plans accordingly. The number of health-related apps accessible in the App Store and Google Play is approximately 100,000, and among these apps, the ones related to diabetes are the highest in number. Conducting regular self-management tasks such as medication and insulin intake, blood sugar checkup, diet observance, and physical exercise are really demanding. This is why the use of diabetes-related apps for the purposes of recording diet and medication intake or blood glucose level is promising to improve the health condition for the patients. However, despite the high number of apps, the rate of their usage among the patients is not high. One of the reasons for this could be due to the design problems that affect their usability. In addition, a 2016 study of 65 diabetes apps for Android revealed that sensitive data, such as insulin and blood glucose levels, \\"was routinely collected and shared with third parties\\". Lifestyle modification The British National Health Service launched a programme targeting 100,000 people at risk of diabetes to lose weight and take more exercise in 2016. In 2019 it was announced that the programme was successful. The 17,000 people who attended most of the healthy living sessions had, collectively lost nearly 60,000 kg, and the programme was to be doubled in size. =Diet= Because high blood sugar caused by poorly controlled diabetes can lead to a plethora of immediate and long-term complications, it is critical to maintain blood sugars as close to normal as possible, and a diet that produces more controllable glycemic variability is an important factor in producing normal blood sugars. People with type 1 diabetes who use insulin can eat whatever they want, preferably a healthy diet with some carbohydrate content; in the long term it is helpful to eat a consistent amount of carbohydrate to make blood sugar management easier. There is a lack of evidence of the usefulness of low-carbohydrate dieting for people with type 1 diabetes. Although for certain individuals it may be feasible to follow a low-carbohydrate regime combined with carefully managed insulin dosing, this is hard to maintain and there are concerns about potential adverse health effects caused by the diet. In general people with type 1 diabetes are advised to follow an individualized eating plan rather than a pre-decided one. =Medications= Currently, one goal for diabetics is to avoid or minimize chronic diabetic complications, as well as to avoid acute problems of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia. Adequate control of diabetes leads to lower risk of complications associated with unmonitored diabetes including kidney failure (requiring dialysis or transplant), blindness, heart disease and limb amputation. The most prevalent form of medication is hypoglycemic treatment through either oral hypoglycemics and/or insulin therapy. There is emerging evidence that full-blown diabetes mellitus type 2 can be evaded in those with only mildly impaired glucose tolerance. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus require direct injection of insulin as their bodies cannot produce enough (or even any) insulin. As of 2010, there is no other clinically available form of insulin administration other than injection for patients with type 1: injection can be done by insulin pump, by jet injector, or any of several forms of hypodermic needle. Non-injective methods of insulin administration have been unattainable as the insulin protein breaks down in the digestive tract. There are several insulin application mechanisms under experimental development as of 2004, including a capsule that passes to the liver and delivers insulin into the bloodstream. There have also been proposed vaccines for type I using glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but these are currently not being tested by the pharmaceutical companies that have sublicensed the patents to them. For type 2 diabetics, diabetic management consists of a combination of diet, exercise, and weight loss, in any achievable combination depending on the patient. Obesity is very common in type 2 diabetes and contributes greatly to insulin resistance. Weight reduction and exercise improve tissue sensitivity to insulin and allow its proper use by target tissues. Patients who have poor diabetic control after lifestyle modifications are typically placed on oral hypoglycemics. Some Type 2 diabetics eventually fail to respond to these and must proceed to insulin therapy. A study conducted in 2008 found that increasingly complex and costly diabetes treatments are being applied to an increasing population with type 2 diabetes. Data from 1994 to 2007 was analyzed and it was found that the mean number of diabetes medications per treated patient increased from 1.14 in 1994 to 1.63 in 2007. Patient education and compliance with treatment is very important in managing the disease. Improper use of medications and insulin can be very dangerous causing hypo- or hyper-glycemic episodes. =Insulin= Insulin pen used to administer insulin For type 1 diabetics, there will always be a need for insulin injections throughout their life, as the pancreatic beta cells of a type 1 diabetic are not capable of producing sufficient insulin. However, both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can see dramatic improvements in blood sugars through modifying their diet, and some type 2 diabetics can fully control the disease by dietary modification. Insulin therapy requires close monitoring and a great deal of patient education, as improper administration is quite dangerous. For example, when food intake is reduced, less insulin is required. A previously satisfactory dosing may be too much if less food is consumed causing a hypoglycemic reaction if not intelligently adjusted. Exercise decreases insulin requirements as exercise increases glucose uptake by body cells whose glucose uptake is controlled by insulin, and vice versa. In addition, there are several types of insulin with varying times of onset and duration of action. Several companies are currently working to develop a non-invasive version of insulin, so that injections can be avoided. Mannkind has developed an inhalable version, while companies like Novo Nordisk, Oramed and BioLingus have efforts undergoing for an oral product. Also oral combination products of insulin and a GLP-1 agonist are being developed. Insulin therapy creates risk because of the inability to continuously know a person's blood glucose level and adjust insulin infusion appropriately. New advances in technology have overcome much of this problem. Small, portable insulin infusion pumps are available from several manufacturers. They allow a continuous infusion of small amounts of insulin to be delivered through the skin around the clock, plus the ability to give bolus doses when a person eats or has elevated blood glucose levels. This is very similar to how the pancreas works, but these pumps lack a continuous \\"feed-back\\" mechanism. Thus, the user is still at risk of giving too much or too little insulin unless blood glucose measurements are made. A further danger of insulin treatment is that while diabetic microangiopathy is usually explained as the result of hyperglycemia, studies in rats indicate that the higher than normal level of insulin diabetics inject to control their hyperglycemia may itself promote small blood vessel disease. While there is no clear evidence that controlling hyperglycemia reduces diabetic macrovascular and cardiovascular disease, there are indications that intensive efforts to normalize blood glucose levels may worsen cardiovascular and cause diabetic mortality. =Driving= Paramedics in Southern California attend a diabetic man who lost effective control of his vehicle due to low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and drove it over the curb and into the water main and backflow valve in front of this industrial building. He was not injured, but required emergency intravenous glucose. Studies conducted in the United StatesSonger, TJ. Low blood sugar and motor vehicle crashes in persons with type 1 diabetes, Annu Proc Assoc Adv Automotive Med, 46:424–27 (2002) and Europe showed that drivers with type 1 diabetes had twice as many collisions as their non-diabetic spouses, demonstrating the increased risk of driving collisions in the type 1 diabetes population. Diabetes can compromise driving safety in several ways. First, long-term complications of diabetes can interfere with the safe operation of a vehicle. For example, diabetic retinopathy (loss of peripheral vision or visual acuity), or peripheral neuropathy (loss of feeling in the feet) can impair a driver's ability to read street signs, control the speed of the vehicle, apply appropriate pressure to the brakes, etc. Second, hypoglycemia can affect a person's thinking process, coordination, and state of consciousness. This disruption in brain functioning is called neuroglycopenia. Studies have demonstrated that the effects of neuroglycopenia impair driving ability. A study involving people with type 1 diabetes found that individuals reporting two or more hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps differ physiologically and behaviorally from their counterparts who report no such mishaps. For example, during hypoglycemia, drivers who had two or more mishaps reported fewer warning symptoms, their driving was more impaired, and their body released less epinephrine (a hormone that helps raise BG). Additionally, individuals with a history of hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps appear to use sugar at a faster rate and are relatively slower at processing information. These findings indicate that although anyone with type 1 diabetes may be at some risk of experiencing disruptive hypoglycemia while driving, there is a subgroup of type 1 drivers who are more vulnerable to such events. Given the above research findings, it is recommended that drivers with type 1 diabetes with a history of driving mishaps should never drive when their BG is less than 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/l). Instead, these drivers are advised to treat hypoglycemia and delay driving until their BG is above 90 mg/dl (5 mmol/l). Such drivers should also learn as much as possible about what causes their hypoglycemia, and use this information to avoid future hypoglycemia while driving. Studies funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have demonstrated that face-to-face training programs designed to help individuals with type 1 diabetes better anticipate, detect, and prevent extreme BG can reduce the occurrence of future hypoglycemia-related driving mishaps. An internet-version of this training has also been shown to have significant beneficial results. Additional NIH funded research to develop internet interventions specifically to help improve driving safety in drivers with type 1 diabetes is currently underway.http://www.DiabetesDriving.com Diabetes Driving. =Exenatide= The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a treatment called Exenatide, based on the saliva of a Gila monster, to control blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. =Other regimens= Artificial Intelligence researcher Dr. Cynthia Marling, of the Ohio University Russ College of Engineering and Technology, in collaboration with the Appalachian Rural Health Institute Diabetes Center, is developing a case-based reasoning system to aid in diabetes management. The goal of the project is to provide automated intelligent decision support to diabetes patients and their professional care providers by interpreting the ever-increasing quantities of data provided by current diabetes management technology and translating it into better care without time-consuming manual effort on the part of an endocrinologist or diabetologist. This type of Artificial Intelligence-based treatment shows some promise with initial testing of a prototype system producing best practice treatment advice which anaylizing physicians deemed to have some degree of benefit over 70% of the time and advice of neutral benefit another nearly 25% of the time. Use of a \\"Diabetes Coach\\" is becoming an increasingly popular way to manage diabetes. A Diabetes Coach is usually a Certified diabetes educator (CDE) who is trained to help people in all aspects of caring for their diabetes. The CDE can advise the patient on diet, medications, proper use of insulin injections and pumps, exercise, and other ways to manage diabetes while living a healthy and active lifestyle. CDEs can be found locally or by contacting a company which provides personalized diabetes care using CDEs. Diabetes Coaches can speak to a patient on a pay-per-call basis or via a monthly plan. = Dental care = High blood glucose in diabetic people is a risk factor for developing gum and tooth problems, especially in post-puberty and aging individuals. Diabetic patients have greater chances of developing oral health problems such as tooth decay, salivary gland dysfunction, fungal infections, inflammatory skin disease, periodontal disease or taste impairment and thrush of the mouth. The oral problems in persons suffering from diabetes can be prevented with a good control of the blood sugar levels, regular check- ups and a very good oral hygiene. By maintaining a good oral status, diabetic persons prevent losing their teeth as a result of various periodontal conditions. Diabetic persons must increase their awareness about oral infections as they have a double impact on health. Firstly, people with diabetes are more likely to develop periodontal disease, which causes increased blood sugar levels, often leading to diabetes complications. Severe periodontal disease can increase blood sugar, contributing to increased periods of time when the body functions with a high blood sugar. This puts diabetics at increased risk for diabetic complications. The first symptoms of gum and tooth infection in diabetic persons are decreased salivary flow and burning mouth or tongue. Also, patients may experience signs like dry mouth, which increases the incidence of decay. Poorly controlled diabetes usually leads to gum recession, since plaque creates more harmful proteins in the gums. Tooth decay and cavities are some of the first oral problems that individuals with diabetes are at risk for. Increased blood sugar levels translate into greater sugars and acids that attack the teeth and lead to gum diseases. Gingivitis can also occur as a result of increased blood sugar levels along with an inappropriate oral hygiene. Periodontitis is an oral disease caused by untreated gingivitis and which destroys the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth. This disease may cause the gums to pull away from the teeth which may eventually loosen and fall out. Diabetic people tend to experience more severe periodontitis because diabetes lowers the ability to resist infection and also slows healing. At the same time, an oral infection such as periodontitis can make diabetes more difficult to control because it causes the blood sugar levels to rise. To prevent further diabetic complications as well as serious oral problems, diabetic persons must keep their blood sugar levels under control and have a proper oral hygiene. A study in the Journal of Periodontology found that poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients are more likely to develop periodontal disease than well-controlled diabetics are. At the same time, diabetic patients are recommended to have regular checkups with a dental care provider at least once in three to four months. Diabetics who receive good dental care and have good insulin control typically have a better chance at avoiding gum disease to help prevent tooth loss. Dental care is therefore even more important for diabetic patients than for healthy individuals. Maintaining the teeth and gum healthy is done by taking some preventing measures such as regular appointments at a dentist and a very good oral hygiene. Also, oral health problems can be avoided by closely monitoring the blood sugar levels. Patients who keep better under control their blood sugar levels and diabetes are less likely to develop oral health problems when compared to diabetic patients who control their disease moderately or poorly. Poor oral hygiene is a great factor to take under consideration when it comes to oral problems and even more in people with diabetes. Diabetic people are advised to brush their teeth at least twice a day, and if possible, after all meals and snacks. However, brushing in the morning and at night is mandatory as well as flossing and using an anti- bacterial mouthwash. Individuals who suffer from diabetes are recommended to use toothpaste that contains fluoride as this has proved to be the most efficient in fighting oral infections and tooth decay. Flossing must be done at least once a day, as well because it is helpful in preventing oral problems by removing the plaque between the teeth, which is not removed when brushing. Diabetic patients must get professional dental cleanings every six months. In cases when dental surgery is needed, it is necessary to take some special precautions such as adjusting diabetes medication or taking antibiotics to prevent infection. Looking for early signs of gum disease (redness, swelling, bleeding gums) and informing the dentist about them is also helpful in preventing further complications. Quitting smoking is recommended to avoid serious diabetes complications and oral diseases. Diabetic persons are advised to make morning appointments to the dental care provider as during this time of the day the blood sugar levels tend to be better kept under control. Not least, individuals who suffer from diabetes must make sure both their physician and dental care provider are informed and aware of their condition, medical history and periodontal status. =Medication nonadherence= Because many patients with diabetes have two or more comorbidities, they often require multiple medications. The prevalence of medication nonadherence is high among patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, and nonadherence is associated with public health issues and higher health care costs. One reason for nonadherence is the cost of medications. Being able to detect cost-related nonadherence is important for health care professionals, because this can lead to strategies to assist patients with problems paying for their medications. Some of these strategies are use of generic drugs or therapeutic alternatives, substituting a prescription drug with an over-the-counter medication, and pill-splitting. Interventions to improve adherence can achieve reductions in diabetes morbidity and mortality, as well as significant cost savings to the health care system. Smartphone apps have been found to improve self-management and health outcomes in people with diabetes through functions such as specific reminder alarms, while working with mental health professionals has also been found to help people with diabetes develop the skills to manage their medications and challenges of self-management effectively. =Psychological mechanisms and adherence= As self-management of diabetes typically involves lifestyle modifications, adherence may pose a significant self-management burden on many individuals. For example, individuals with diabetes may find themselves faced with the need to self-monitor their blood glucose levels, adhere to healthier diets and maintain exercise regimens regularly in order to maintain metabolic control and reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular problems. Barriers to adherence have been associated with key psychological mechanisms: knowledge of self-management, beliefs about the efficacy of treatment and self-efficacy/perceived control. Such mechanisms are inter- related, as one's thoughts (e.g. one's perception of diabetes, or one's appraisal of how helpful self-management is) is likely to relate to one's emotions (e.g. motivation to change), which in turn, affects one's self- efficacy (one's confidence in their ability to engage in a behaviour to achieve a desired outcome). As diabetes management is affected by an individual's emotional and cognitive state, there has been evidence suggesting the self-management of diabetes is negatively affected by diabetes-related distress and depression. There is growing evidence that there is higher levels of clinical depression in patients with diabetes compared to the non-diabetic population.Hussain S, Habib A, Singh A et al. Prevalence of depression among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients in India: A meta-analysis. Psychiatry Research 270 (2018): 264-273. doi:10.1016/j.psychres.2018.09.037 Depression in individuals with diabetes has been found to be associated with poorer self- management of symptoms. This suggests that it may be important to target mood in treatment. To this end, treatment programs such as the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - Adherence and Depression program (CBT-AD) have been developed to target the psychological mechanisms underpinning adherence. By working on increasing motivation and challenging maladaptive illness perceptions, programs such as CBT-AD aim to enhance self-efficacy and improve diabetes-related distress and one's overall quality of life. Research =Type 1 diabetes= Diabetes type 1 is caused by the destruction of enough beta cells to produce symptoms; these cells, which are found in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, produce and secrete insulin, the single hormone responsible for allowing glucose to enter from the blood into cells (in addition to the hormone amylin, another hormone required for glucose homeostasis). Hence, the phrase \\"curing diabetes type 1\\" means \\"causing a maintenance or restoration of the endogenous ability of the body to produce insulin in response to the level of blood glucose\\" and cooperative operation with counterregulatory hormones. This section deals only with approaches for curing the underlying condition of diabetes type 1, by enabling the body to endogenously, in vivo, produce insulin in response to the level of blood glucose. It does not cover other approaches, such as, for instance, closed- loop integrated glucometer/insulin pump products, which could potentially increase the quality-of-life for some who have diabetes type 1, and may by some be termed \\"artificial pancreas\\".  Encapsulation approach  bio- engineered tissue with encapsulated islet cells delivering endocrine hormones in response to glucose A biological approach to the artificial pancreas is to implant bioengineered tissue containing islet cells, which would secrete the amounts of insulin, amylin and glucagon needed in response to sensed glucose. When islet cells have been transplanted via the Edmonton protocol, insulin production (and glycemic control) was restored, but at the expense of continued immunosuppression drugs. Encapsulation of the islet cells in a protective coating has been developed to block the immune response to transplanted cells, which relieves the burden of immunosuppression and benefits the longevity of the transplant.Cerco Medical: Science: Methods  Stem cells  Research is being done at several locations in which islet cells are developed from stem cells. Stem cell research has also been suggested as a potential avenue for a cure since it may permit regrowth of Islet cells which are genetically part of the treated individual, thus perhaps eliminating the need for immuno-suppressants.[48] This new method autologous nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was developed by a research team composed by Brazilian and American scientists (Dr. Julio Voltarelli, Dr. Carlos Eduardo Couri, Dr Richard Burt, and colleagues) and it was the first study to use stem cell therapy in human diabetes mellitus This was initially tested in mice and in 2007 there was the first publication of stem cell therapy to treat this form of diabetes. Until 2009, there was 23 patients included and followed for a mean period of 29.8 months (ranging from 7 to 58 months). In the trial, severe immunosuppression with high doses of cyclophosphamide and anti-thymocyte globulin is used with the aim of \\"turning off\\" the immunologic system\\", and then autologous hematopoietic stem cells are reinfused to regenerate a new one. In summary it is a kind of \\"immunologic reset\\" that blocks the autoimmune attack against residual pancreatic insulin- producing cells. Until December 2009, 12 patients remained continuously insulin-free for periods ranging from 14 to 52 months and 8 patients became transiently insulin-free for periods ranging from 6 to 47 months. Of these last 8 patients, 2 became insulin-free again after the use of sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor approved only to treat type 2 diabetic patients and this is also the first study to document the use and complete insulin-independendce in humans with type 1 diabetes with this medication. In parallel with insulin suspension, indirect measures of endogenous insulin secretion revealed that it significantly increased in the whole group of patients, regardless the need of daily exogenous insulin use.  Gene therapy  Gene therapy: Designing a viral vector to deliberately infect cells with DNA to carry on the viral production of insulin in response to the blood sugar level. Technology for gene therapy is advancing rapidly such that there are multiple pathways possible to support endocrine function, with potential to practically cure diabetes.Gene Therapy Approaches to Diabetes * Gene therapy can be used to manufacture insulin directly: an oral medication, consisting of viral vectors containing the insulin sequence, is digested and delivers its genes to the upper intestines. Those intestinal cells will then behave like any viral infected cell, and will reproduce the insulin protein. The virus can be controlled to infect only the cells which respond to the presence of glucose, such that insulin is produced only in the presence of high glucose levels. Due to the limited numbers of vectors delivered, very few intestinal cells would actually be impacted and would die off naturally in a few days. Therefore, by varying the amount of oral medication used, the amount of insulin created by gene therapy can be increased or decreased as needed. As the insulin-producing intestinal cells die off, they are boosted by additional oral medications.Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. * Gene therapy might eventually be used to cure the cause of beta cell destruction, thereby curing the new diabetes patient before the beta cell destruction is complete and irreversible.hopkinsbayview.org * Gene therapy can be used to turn duodenum cells and duodenum adult stem cells into beta cells which produce insulin and amylin naturally. By delivering beta cell DNA to the intestine cells in the duodenum, a few intestine cells will turn into beta cells, and subsequently adult stem cells will develop into beta cells. This makes the supply of beta cells in the duodenum self-replenishing, and the beta cells will produce insulin in proportional response to carbohydrates consumed.Engene Inc =Type 2 diabetes= Type 2 diabetes is usually first treated by increasing physical activity, and eliminating saturated fat and reducing sugar and carbohydrate intake with a goal of losing weight. These can restore insulin sensitivity even when the weight loss is modest, for example around 5 kg (10 to 15 lb), most especially when it is in abdominal fat deposits. Diets that are very low in saturated fats have been claimed to reverse insulin resistance. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is an effective intervention for improving adherence to medication, depression and glycaemic control, with enduring and clinically meaningful benefits for diabetes self-management and glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and comorbid depression. Testosterone replacement therapy may improve glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diabetic hypogonadal men. The mechanisms by which testosterone decreases insulin resistance is under study. Moreover, testosterone may have a protective effect on pancreatic beta cells, which is possibly exerted by androgen-receptor-mediated mechanisms and influence of inflammatory cytokines. Recently it has been suggested that a type of gastric bypass surgery may normalize blood glucose levels in 80–100% of severely obese patients with diabetes. The precise causal mechanisms are being intensively researched; its results may not simply be attributable to weight loss, as the improvement in blood sugars seems to precede any change in body mass. This approach may become a treatment for some people with type 2 diabetes, but has not yet been studied in prospective clinical trials. This surgery may have the additional benefit of reducing the death rate from all causes by up to 40% in severely obese people. A small number of normal to moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes have successfully undergone similar operations. MODY is a rare genetic form of diabetes, often mistaken for Type 1 or Type 2. The medical management is variable and depends on each individual case. ] See also * Ambulatory care sensitive conditions * Diabetic coma * Diabetic hypoglycemia * Diabetic hypoglycemia journal * Glycemic efficacy * Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults References External links * American College of Physicians Diabetes Portal – Resources for patients and clinicians * American Diabetes Association * Prevent Diabetes Problems: Keep Your Diabetes Under Control – Self-care tips at the United States \\"National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse\\" Diabetes ","title":"Diabetes management"},{"id":"2966534","text":"The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art was one of the grand social institutions and architectural splendours of Victorian London. It was given a Royal Charter in 1850 and in July 1851 a lease was taken out on a premium site for 60 years and building commenced. The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art was built on the eastern side of Leicester Square, opening on 18 March 1854.  Exhibitions  A drawing of the interior, when The Royal Panopticon of Science and Art opened in 1854. As a showcase venue for the very best achievements in sciences and arts of the time, it attracted 1,000 visitors per day. The rotunda at the centre of the building was encircled with a 91 meter frieze, creating a panathenaic procession in Elgin Marbles. The interior reflected the taste for religiously meaningless ornament. The panopticon cells were designed as reproductions of the Arch of Titus, Temple of Vesta, grottas and conservatories, while the wallpaper was changed frequently and displayed Arabic script. The interior design of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art emerged out of the contemporary taste for recreational learning, which had been pioneered in London through the Great Exhibition in 1851. In 1854 the work on the building that was to house the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art was completed. Visitors of the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art could view changing exhibits, including vacuum flasks, a pin making machine and a cook stove. Visitors engaged in intellectual improvement as a leisure activity, while at the same time a competitive entertainment industry emerged in London. According to The Athenaeum the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art was the most \\"delightful lounge in London\\" which exhibited music, large fountains, interesting experiments and provided opportunities for shopping. Scientists that practiced at the Royal Panopticon of Science and Art also taught interested students. For example, George Frederick Ansell taught chemistry at the Royal Panopticon and his student Herbert McLeod went on to study at the Royal College of Chemistry.  Closure  Two years after opening the amateur science panopticon project closed and the building was sold in 1856. The grand building re-opened as the Alhambra Theatre of Variety.  Architecture  The Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts was a building flanked by minarets. This was a very large building for the time.

The lead-cooled fast reactor is a nuclear reactor design that features a fast neutron spectrum and molten lead or lead- bismuth eutectic coolant. Molten lead or lead-bismuth eutectic can be used as the primary coolant because lead and bismuth have low neutron absorption and relatively low melting points. Neutrons are slowed less by interaction with these heavy nuclei (thus not being neutron moderators) and therefore help make this type of reactor a fast-neutron reactor. The coolant does however serve as a neutron reflector, returning some escaping neutrons to the core. Fuel designs being explored for this reactor scheme include fertile uranium as a metal, metal oxide or metal nitride. Smaller capacity lead-cooled fast reactors (such as SSTAR) can be cooled by natural convection, while larger designs (such as ELSYAlessandro, Alembertia; Johan, Carlssonb; Edouard, Malambuc; Alfredo, Ordend; Dankward, Struwee; Pietro, Agostinif; Stefano, Montif: \\"European lead fast reactor—ELSY\\", published in \\"Nuclear Engineering and Design\\",Volume 241, Issue 9, September 2011, Pages 3470-3480) use forced circulation in normal power operation, but with natural circulation emergency cooling. The reactor outlet coolant temperature is typically in the range of 500 to 600 °C, possibly ranging over 800 °C with advanced materials for later designs. Temperatures higher than 800 °C are high enough to support thermochemical production of hydrogen through the sulfur-iodine cycle. The concept is generally very similar to sodium-cooled fast reactor, and most liquid-metal reactors have used sodium instead of lead. Few lead-cooled reactors have been constructed, except for some Soviet nuclear submarine reactors in the 1970s, but a number of proposed new nuclear reactor designs are lead-cooled. The lead-cooled reactor design has been proposed as a generation IV reactor. Plans for future implementation of this type of reactor include modular arrangements rated at 300 to 400 MWe, and a large monolithic plant rated at 1,200 MWe.  Modular nuclear reactors  Options include a range of plant ratings, including a number of 50 to 150 MWe (megawatts electric) units featuring long-life, pre-manufactured cores. The lead-cooled fast reactor battery is a small turnkey-type power plant using cassette cores running on a closed fuel cycle with 15 to 20 years' refuelling interval, or entirely replaceable reactor modules. It is designed for generation of electricity on small grids (and other resources, including hydrogen and potable water).  Advantages  *Instead of refueling, the whole core can be replaced after many years of operation. Such a reactor is suitable for countries that do not plan to build their own nuclear infrastructure. * As no electricity is required for the cooling after shutdown, this design has the potential to be safer than a water-cooled reactor. * Liquid lead-bismuth systems can't cause an explosion and quickly solidify in case of a leak, further improving safety. * Lead is very dense, and therefore a good shield against gamma rays. * Lead's nuclear properties allow it to prevent a positive void coefficient, which is difficult to prevent in large sodium fast reactor cores. * The operating pressure is very low and lead has an extremely high boiling point of 1750 degrees Celsius, which is over 1100 degrees Celsius higher than the peak coolant operating temperature. This makes significant reactor pressurization by overheating virtually impossible. * Lead does not react significantly with water or air, unlike sodium which burns readily in air and can explode in contact with water. This allows easier, cheaper and safer containment and heat exchanger/steam generator design.  Disadvantages  * Lead and lead-bismuth are very dense, increasing the weight of the system therefore requiring more structural support and seismic protection which increases building cost. * While lead is cheap and abundant, bismuth is expensive and quite rare. A lead-bismuth reactor may require hundreds of tonnes of bismuth depending on reactor size. * Solidification of the lead- bismuth solution renders the reactor inoperable. However, lead-bismuth eutectic has a comparatively low melting temperature of , making desolidification a relatively easily accomplished task. Lead has a higher melting point of 327.5 °С, but is often used as a pool type reactor where the large bulk of lead does not easily freeze. External heating was required to keep a Lead-cooled fast reactor hot at all times to prevent solidification when it was turned off and not in use. An alternative was to keep the reactor in non-stop active running but doing this would result in increased mechanical wear, shortening the operational life. * By leaking and solidifying, the coolant may damage the equipment (see Soviet submarine K-64). * Lead-bismuth produces a considerable amount of polonium, a highly radioactive and quite mobile element. This can complicate maintenance and pose a plant contamination problem. Lead produces orders of magnitudes less polonium, and so has an advantage over lead-bismuth in this regard.  Implementation  =Belgium= The MYRRHA project (for Multi-purpose hYbrid Research Reactor for High-tech Applications) is a first-of-a-kind design of a nuclear reactor coupled to a proton accelerator (so-called Accelerator-driven system (ADS)). This will be a 'Lead-bismuth-cooled fast reactor' with two possible configurations: sub- critical or critical. The project is managed by SCK•CEN, the Belgian center for nuclear energy. It will be built based on a first successful demonstrator: GUINEVERE.Science Magazine, \\" Reactor-Accelerator Hybrid Achieves Successful Test Run\\" The project entered a new phase of development in 2013 when a contract for the front-end engineering design was awarded to a consortium led by Areva.World Nuclear News, \\"Myrrha accelerates towards realisation\\"AREVA official website, \\"AREVA TA WINS CONTRACT FOR THE MYRRHA PROJECT\\" MYRRHA enjoys international recognition and was listed in December 2010 by the European CommissionEuropean commission, \\" Targeting nuclear waste with a proton beam\\" as one of 50 projects for maintaining European leadership in high-tech research in the next 20 years. =Russia/USSR= Two types of lead- cooled fast reactor were used in Soviet Alfa class submarines of the 1970s. The OK-550 and BM-40A designs were both capable of producing 155MWt. They were significantly lighter than typical water-cooled reactors and had an advantage of being capable to quickly switch between maximum power and minimum noise operation modes. A joint venture called AKME Engineering was announced to develop a commercial lead-bismuth reactor. The SVBR-100 ('Svintsovo-Vismutovyi Bystryi Reaktor' - lead-bismuth fast reactor) is based on the Alfa designs and will produce 100MWe electricity from gross thermal power of 280MWt, about twice that of the submarine reactors. They can also be used in groups of up to 16 if more power is required. The coolant increases from to as it goes through the core. Uranium oxide enriched to 16.5% U-235 could be used as fuel, and refuelling would be required every 7–8 years. A prototype is planned for 2017. Another two lead cooled reactors are developed by Russians: BREST-300 and BREST-1200 The BREST-300 design was completed in September 2014. WNA mentions Russia role on boosting other countries interest in this field: =United States= According to Nuclear Engineering International, the initial design of the Hyperion Power Module was to be of this type, using uranium nitride fuel encased in HT-9 tubes, using a quartz reflector, and lead-bismuth eutectic as coolant. The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory developed SSTAR is a lead-cooled design. =Germany= The dual fluid reactor (DFR) is a German project combining the advantages of the molten salt reactor with the ones of the liquid metal cooled reactor.Dual Fluid Reactor As a breeder reactor the DFR can burn both natural uranium and thorium, as well as recycle nuclear waste. Due to the high thermal conductivity of the molten metal, the DFR is an inherently safe reactor (the decay heat can be removed passively).

The one way trip takes approximately five minutes. The Wellington Cable Car is widely recognised as a symbol of Wellington. Track and stations The line consists of of mostly straight single track with pine sleepers. The only curves are at the passing loop in the middle, at Talavera station. Except for the lowest part the line rises at a constant grade of 1 in 5.06 (17.86%), through three tunnels and over three bridges. The lower terminus is in Cable Car Lane, off Lambton Quay (). The upper terminus is next to the Wellington Botanic Garden at the city end of Upland Road, Kelburn's main street (). Cars and propulsion Control panel in one of the cable cars. The Cable Car has two cars, which start from opposite ends of the line and pass in the middle. They are attached to each other by a 30 mm diameter cable, supported by 120 rollers, which runs round a pulley at the top of the hill. A 185 kW 550 V DC motor at the top of the hill drives the pulley. The Cable Car is a funicular rather than a true cable car: the cars are permanently attached to the cable, which stops and starts as required, while a cable car grips and releases a continuously-moving cable. Wheels on the south side of car 1 and the north side of car 2 have double flanges, while the opposite wheels on each car have no flanges, directing the cars to the correct side of the mid-way passing loop at Talavera. The cars are designed to fit the grade, using internal steps to provide horizontal floors. The normal operating speed is (), with a maximum passenger load of around 100 (30 seated, 70 standing). Each car weighs approximately when empty and when full. Passengers The Cable Car is used by slightly under a million people each year. In the mornings and evenings, it is used by commuters travelling between Kelburn and the city; at other times of the day, it is used by people travelling between the city and the Wellington Botanic Garden, by students attending Victoria University and living in nearby student hostels, and by many tourists, especially during summer. Ownership The Cable Car is owned and operated by Wellington Cable Car Ltd, owned by Wellington City Council. Wellington Cable Car Ltd also owns the overhead wires for Wellington's trolleybuses. Operation was contracted out to Australian company Transfield Services until early 2007, when it was brought back inhouse. Wellington Cable Car Ltd is responsible for all operations of the Cable Car, including the maintenance of cars and track, employing drivers, selling tickets and providing customer service. Unlike buses and trains, the Cable Car does not receive a subsidy, and is profitable. Museum Car 3, restored for display in the museumThe Cable Car Museum was opened in December 2000. Located in the original winding house, and with a new extension completed in 2006, it houses original grip cars 1 and 3, with the electric winding gear still in working order. Car 1 is in red 1970s livery, including contemporary advertising. Car 3 was restored in 2005 to a green livery dating from about 1905, and a bell from the San Francisco Cable Car was added. The winding gear is still in working order and runs a loop of cable, but the cable no longer leaves the building. The Cable Car Museum is operated by the Wellington Museums Trust. It has a Category II listing with Heritage New Zealand. History =The original line= At the end of the 19th century, Wellington was expanding rapidly, and, due to the city's hilly terrain, good building land was at a premium. When new residential developments were proposed for Kelburn, it was suggested that a cable car or funicular could be built to provide easy access. In 1898, a number of people prominent in the development of the residential subdivisions founded the Kelburne & Karori Tramway Company. The plan was to build a tramway between the city and Kelburn, and link it by carriage to Karori, a settlement on the far side of Kelburn. The company began purchasing land for the construction of the tramway, and negotiated with the Karori authorities for a new road (now Upland Road) to link the upper terminus with Karori. In 1898, the City Council granted permission for the venture, on condition that it had the option to purchase the operation at a later date. The location of Victoria University of Wellington was influenced by the company's offer of a donation of £1000 if the university were located in Kelburn, so students would patronise the car when travelling between the city and the university. Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of Seddon, who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington. Kelburne Cable Car from Salamanca station, 1910 The designer of the system was James Fulton, a Dunedin-born engineer. Fulton was responsible for both selecting the route and deciding the method of operation, a hybrid between a cable car and a funicular. Like a cable car, the line had a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, but it also had a funicular-style balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. There was a Fell type centre rail, used for emergency braking only. The line was double track, of gauge. Construction began in 1899, involving three teams working around the clock. The line opened to the public on 22 February 1902. Demand was high, with thousands of people travelling each day. In 1903, a number of old horse-drawn Wellington trams were converted into cable car trailers, increasing capacity. By 1912, the annual number of passengers had reached one million. In 1933, the steam-powered winding gear was replaced by an electric motor, improving control and reducing operating costs. In the 1940s, the Cable Car suffered from increased competition: City Council buses ran to Karori and other western suburbs, bypassing it. The company believed that it was inappropriate for the City Council to compete with a private company, and a legal dispute broke out. The argument ended when the City Council agreed to purchase the company, which occurred on 13 February 1947. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Cable Car was the subject of complaints about safety and comfort. The old wooden cars were increasingly considered antiquated. On 10 May 1973, a worker on the new motorway suffered serious injuries in an accident when he stepped in front of a Cable Car at the Clifton stop, prompting a review. The Ministry of Works concluded that aspects of the Cable Car were unsafe, particularly the use of unbraked trailers, and called for the system to be scrapped. The trailers were withdrawn, considerably reducing capacity. =1978–79 upgrade= Despite public protests led by Mayor of Wellington Michael Fowler, the line closed on 22 September 1978 for re- gauging and installation of new steel cars and equipment by Habegger AG of Switzerland, becoming a full funicular. The contract was managed by Wellington engineering firm Cory-Wright and Salmon. The line re-opened on 22 October 1979. View down the track from the Kelburn terminus showing a car at Salamanca station. The two ends of the cable are between the rails Initially, the refurbished Cable Car suffered a number of problems. The service was frequently interrupted for technical reasons and for extensive safety checks. Largely as a result of these problems, patronage dropped to a low of 500,000 in 1982. After a serious accident in 1988, which put the cars out of service for months, the system underwent a major revamp. This solved most of the problems and patronage has steadily increased since then. A safety survey is conducted annually at the end of October and takes four days. =Deregulation= In 1991, when passenger transport was deregulated, there was speculation about the future of the Cable Car. Councils could no longer provide transport services directly, having to either privatise or corporatise their operations. The City Council sold its bus operation, but due to public pressure it retained ownership of the Cable Car and the trolleybus overhead wiring, with operations and maintenance contracted out separately. Initially both contracts were won by Harbour City Cable Car Ltd, a joint venture between the Stagecoach Group, which had purchased the buses, and East by West, a Wellington ferry operator. In 1994, the City Council decided to carry out its own maintenance, and Wellington Cable Car Ltd established its own maintenance capacity. In 1997, the operations contract was won by Serco, which was later purchased by Transfield Services. Wellington Cable Car Ltd took the operation in-house in early 2007. Cracks were discovered in the tunnel below Talavera station during the 1999 Annual survey. These were fixed with metal anchoring and by coating the tunnel with reinforced concrete. In July 2006, renovation of Lambton station began, to improve its looks and accessibility. The works were budgeted at $1.3 million, scheduled to be completed in early November. On 18 December the renovated station came into use, with automated turnstiles (and a substantial price rise). Lingering problems with the ticketing system upgrade were fixed during the October 2007 annual survey. A new computer was also added to the winding mechanism during the survey which has caused a few temporary issues with how smoothly the cars run. =2016 electric drive and control system upgrade= Refurbishing the inside of the cars, which involved removing the seats, flooring, ceiling, and glass windows. Scaffolding placed in the Cable Car Lane whilst the new overhead canopy is being installed In 2016, the Cable Car underwent a major equipment upgrade to replace the electric drive and control system. Since the 1979 upgrade, each car has completed more than one million trips. The Cable Car also took the opportunity to cosmetically upgrade the existing cars and make changes to the staff facilities. Whilst the Cable Car was out of action, the Wellington City Council also carried out construction work in the Cable Car Lane and Lambton Quay Terminal. This included: 1\\\\. replacing the old leaky canopy with an elegant new glass one that will let the sunshine in (Phase 1) 2\\\\. building a new ticket booth and moving the entry gates to make queuing and buying tickets easier (Phase 1) 3\\\\. new paving, signs and colour scheme for the heritage- listed Stonehams building (Phase 2 – final phase of work on the lane in 2017) Trivia The landmark Kelburn Kiosk was built at the Kelburn terminal in 1905. It was burnt down in a suspicious fire in 1982. The Skyline Restaurant was built to replace it in 1984, with a design that won an award from the Institute of Architects in 1986. In 1996, Paul Lambert rode 80 trips in one day, setting something of a record. The Cable Car waived the ticket price, and he collected funds for the Life Flight Trust throughout the day. In 2001, Josie Bullock ran for the Wellington mayoralty on a platform of bringing the wooden cable cars back into service. She claimed this would only cost about $300,000 to accomplish, even though this would require relaying the entire track and refurbishing the cars to bring them up to modern safety standards. On 24 February 1909, John William Wakelin, aged 30, was accidentally killed by the tram.

The band was originally composed of bassist Pat Brown (née Schmaljohn, Scott's older brother), drummer Wayne Rhino Flower, guitarist Doug Martsch, and frontman Scott Schmaljohn. After six albums and various lineup changes, the band disbanded in 1994. The band's original lineup would reform in 2018, sans Brown due to his death in 1999. History Brown, Flower, and Schmaljohn were ex- members of the Boise punk band State of Confusion. The three would link up with Martsch and form Treepeople in 1988. The band gained local notoriety and success in the late 1980s and early 1990s in regional scenes. This lineup recorded the No Mouth Pipetting self-released album in 1989, and then shortly released the Time Whore EP the following year. The band's next album would be Guilt Regret Embarrassment in 1991, released through two small labels, Toxic Shock Records and K Records. Afterwards in 1992, Flower had left the band, and Tony Reed was recruited as the new drummer. This lineup would record the Something Vicious for Tomorrow EP; however, the band had more label backing on this release, as they had signed with the label C/Z Records, and would stay with them for the remainder of their career. The label wanted to make the release a full-length; thus, they included the previously-released Time Whore EP as an add-on. Shortly before the recording of the next album, Brown had left the band. He was replaced by drummer-turned-bassist Reed, and Eric Akre was added on for drums. This lineup would release its next album Just Kidding in 1993. The following year in 1994, Schmaljohn would change the lineup yet again, with John Polle replacing Martsch on guitars and Eric Carnell replacing Reed on bass; however, drummer Akre stayed on board. Martsch would move on with the band Built to Spill. The band's final album would be Actual Re- Enactment. After losing members to family complications and other projects, the group disbanded later that year in 1994. Scott Schmaljohn later played in Stuntman, The Hand, and The Treatment. Schmaljohn also guested on Built to Spill's 2009 album There Is No Enemy, playing on the song \\"Pat\\", a tribute to Pat Brown, who committed suicide in April 1999. Prior to his death, Brown fronted the band Hive. Wayne Flower went on to play in Violent Green and The Halo Benders with Doug Martsch and Calvin Johnson (of Beat Happening, Dub Narcotic and co-founder of K Records). Treepeople reformed in 2018 with Troy Wright taking over bass duties for Pat Brown. Wright was also the last drummer for State of Confusion. Treepeople started back up with shows at the 2018 Treefort music festival and played more dates in Portland, Seattle, Vancouver, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Tucson, Albuquerque, and Denver.

This receptor is activated by the biogenic amine histamine. It is expressed in smooth muscles, on vascular endothelial cells, in the heart, and in the central nervous system. The H1 receptor is linked to an intracellular G-protein (Gq) that activates phospholipase C and the inositol triphosphate (IP3) signalling pathway. Antihistamines, which act on this receptor, are used as anti-allergy drugs. The crystal structure of the receptor has been determined (shown on the right) and used to discover new histamine H1 receptor ligands in structure-based virtual screening studies. Role in inflammation The expression of NF-κB, the transcription factor that regulates inflammatory processes, is promoted by the constitutive activity of the H1 receptor as well as by agonists that bind at the receptor. H1-antihistamines have been shown to attenuate NF-κB expression and mitigate certain inflammatory processes in associated cells. Neurophysiology Histamine H1 receptors are activated by endogenous histamine, which is released by neurons that have their cell bodies in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. The histaminergic neurons of the tuberomammillary nucleus become active during the 'wake' cycle, firing at approximately 2 Hz; during slow wave sleep, this firing rate drops to approximately 0.5 Hz. Finally, during REM sleep, histaminergic neurons stop firing altogether. It has been reported that histaminergic neurons have the most wake-selective firing pattern of all known neuronal types. The tuberomammillary nucleus is a histaminergic nucleus that strongly regulates the sleep-wake cycle. H1-antihistamines that cross the blood-brain barrier inhibit H1 receptor activity on neurons that project from the tuberomammillary nucleus. This action is responsible for the drowsiness effect associated with these drugs.

He has lived at various times in Italy, in India, and in New York City. Some of his work is influenced by the traditional art and culture of India. He has worked in various artistic media including drawing, fresco, graphics, mosaic, oils and sculpture. He was among the principal figures in the Italian Transavanguardia movement of the 1980s, which was characterised by a rejection of Formalism and conceptual art and a return to figurative art and Symbolism.  Life  Clemente was born in 1952 in Naples, in Campania in southern Italy. In 1970 he enrolled in the faculty of architecture of the Sapienza, the university of Rome, but did not complete a degree there. In Rome he came into contact with contemporary artists such as Luigi Ontani and Alighiero Boetti, who had come to the city at about the same time, and also with the American Cy Twombly, who lived there. Boetti, who was ten years older, became both a friend and a mentor; in 1974 they visited Afghanistan together. With Ontani, Clemente gave performances at the Galleria L'Attico. Despite his close involvement with these artists associated with the Arte povera movement, and his interest in others such as Pino Pascali and Michelangelo Pistoletto, Clemente preferred to work on paper. He made ink drawings of dreams and recollections of his childhood, and in 1971, in his first solo show, exhibited collages at the Galleria Giulia in Rome. In 1973 Clemente made the first of many visits to India. He established a studio in Madras (now Chennai), and became interested in both the religious and folk traditions of India and in the traditional art and crafts of the country. In 1976 and 1977 he visited the library of the Theosophical Society of Madras to study the religious texts there. In 1980 and 1981 he worked on Francesco Clemente Pinxit, a series of twenty-four gouaches on antique hand-made rag paper, in collaboration with miniature painters from Orissa and Jaipur. In 1982 he moved to New York City.. He lives in Greenwich Village.Kurutz, Steven. \\"What Do Anna Wintour and Bob Dylan Have in Common? This Secret Garden\\", The New York Times, 28 September 2016.

His early large canvases, painted in 1981–1982, were shown in 1983 at the Whitechapel Gallery in London, and then in Germany and Sweden. In 1986 the John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida, mounted a travelling exhibition of his work. Clemente participated in the Biennale di Venezia in 1988, 1993, 1995 and 1997; in documenta in Kassel, Germany, in 1992 and 1997; and in the Whitney Biennial, also in 1997. Solo shows were held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1990; at the Sezon Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo in 1994; at the Galleria d'Arte Moderna of Bologna in 1999; at the Solomon R.

Chuck Swirsky (born January 30, 1954) is an American-Canadian radio sports announcer. He is the play-by-play voice of the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Swirsky's association with Chicago sports started in 1979 with his WCFL AM 1000 talk show which debuted on August 27 of that year. Outside Chicago, Swirsky called play-by-play for both University of Michigan basketball and football and was formerly the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Raptors. Born in Norfolk, Virginia, Swirsky grew up in Bellevue, Washington and is a graduate of Interlake High School. Broadcasting and career Starting in 1979, Swirsky hosted a nightly sports radio show on WCFL (AM 1000) where he talked Chicago sports with callers. Swirsky then moved to WLUP (The Loop) where he provided afternoon sports updates and hosted a Sunday night sports radio show from 9 to 11pm through 1981. During this time, Swirsky was named the Chicago Bulls public address announcer from 1980 to 1983. Swirsky next joined WGN radio in 1981 and remained through the mid-1990s. Swirsky hosted various sports talk shows and provided sports updates. While he was with WGN, he also did play-by-play for DePaul games alongside former coach Ray Meyer and also did Chicago Bears pre-game and post-game coverage. He also made frequent appearances on the Bob Collins radio show discussing Chicago sports, with Collins dubbing him \\"The Swirsk\\" as a nickname. During his time at WGN, a man dressed as Max Headroom hijacked a broadcast of Doctor Who and made a mocking reference to Swirsky, calling him \\"a frickin' liberal\\". Bruce Wolf frequently parodied Swirsky with a fictional character, \\"Chet Chitchat\\", which is a blended caricature of Chicago sportscasters Chet Coppock and Swirsky. During his time at WGN Radio, Swirsky filled in as a sports anchor on an occasional basis at WGN-TV. Swirsky left WGN for Detroit where he did play- by-play for University of Michigan basketball in the mid-1990s. He was also sports director for WJR radio. Rob Pelinka was among his Michigan color commentators. Swirsky next moved to Toronto to become the play-by-play voice of the Toronto Raptors during the 1998–99 NBA season, first on the radio then for television beginning in 2001. On March 23, 2007, Swirsky was honored by the Raptors when they gave out 18,000 bobbleheads with his likeness. He was known for his famous \\"Salami & Cheese\\" phrase, which was used to advertise Raptors game packs during the 2007–08 season. Another catch phrase was \\"Onions, Baby, Onions.\\" This was said when a player makes a three-point shot, and was used to advertise Raptors NBA TV HD. He became a Canadian citizen on January 14, 2008. During the middle of his tenure in Toronto, Swirsky also hosted a sports radio show on CJCL (The Fan 590) called The Chuck Swirsky Show. Swirsky took listeners' calls and provided sports news with the show ending on July 31, 2008. On May 6, 2008, Swirsky left the organization for personal reasons related to his family. His vacated position was filled by Matt Devlin. He has since returned to Chicago to carry out the radio play-by- play for the Chicago Bulls on its flagship station WMVP, which is the same station as Swirsky's first employer, WCFL. He has also called Chicago White Sox games in 2015 on a fill-in basis as substitution for the current play by play broadcaster, Ken \\"The Hawk\\" Harrelson. On September 7, 2016, Swirsky was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame. In May 2018, Swirsky was inducted in to the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame and the WGN Radio Walk of Fame. Chuck Swirsky is married to Ann Swirsky. They have three children.

DDIS is a department under the Ministry of Defence and works under the responsibility of the Minister of Defence. It is housed at Kastellet, Copenhagen. The DDIS gathers, analyses, and disseminates information concerning conditions of importance to Denmark’s security, and to the security of Danish military units deployed on international missions. Intelligence activities include collection of information of political, financial, scientific and military interest. DDIS works closely with the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, which is the intelligence arm of the Danish police, and the signals intelligence unit of the Signal Regiment. History The current name and basic organization dates from 1 October 1967, when Defence Staff's Intelligence Department (), was detached from Defence Staff () by decree of the Ministry of Defence, as a separate authority of its own, located directly under the Ministry of Defence. The origin can be traced back to the General Staff's Intelligence Section () created 1911 and the Naval Staff's Intelligence Section () created 1920s & served in World War I & II. https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/intelligence_and_espionage_denmarkhttps://books.google.com/books?id=ceIlAAAAQBAJ&pg;=PA56 During the reconstruction of the Danish military following Denmark’s joining of NATO, these two intelligence services were merged on 1 October 1950, as Defence Staff's Intelligence Department as a department under the newly erected combined military staff, the Defence Staff. The origin of the Danish military intelligence is uncertain. 1911 appears in one of the few histories of the Danish military intelligence.William Christmas-Møller's Obersten og Kommandøren: Efterretningstjeneste, sikkerhedspolitik og socialdemokrati 1945-55.

This is documented in the Danish Judge Advocate General's Corps: Report on the occasion of the examination by the Judge Advocates of certain matters related to Defence Intelligence Service and Conscientious Objectors' Union etc. in the period 1970-1978 (1999). In August 2020 Lars Findsen was relieved of duty \\"for the time being\\" and two other employees were also suspended after it was revealed the intelligence agency had broken laws and misled the intelligence watchdog. The agency had been spying on Danish citizens from 2014 to 2020. An investigation was launched after whistleblowers handed over information. The agency is accused of failing to investigate espionage in the armed services and of obtaining and passing on information about Danish citizens. The agency is also accused of concealing offences and failing to inform the intelligence agency watchdog. Defence minister Trine Bramsen said an investigation would be launched into the claims. She said the investigation would be carried out \\"the utmost seriousness\\" and \\"It is important for me to emphasise that the fight against the threats against Denmark must not stop while the investigation is carried out\\". Kaspar Wester of Danish news site OLFI said to BBC: \\"The supervisory agency suggests that Lars Findsen has played an active part in withholding information or even deliberately misinforming the supervisory agency. The fact that the head of the Danish Military Intelligence Service is a willing participant in circumventing the agency tasked with holding his own intelligence service legally accountable is mind-blowing and must be deeply concerning to the minister.\\" Wester said the investigation would aim to discover how the scandal had happened and how long it had gone on for.

The service is directly responsible to the Defence Minister, which on behalf of the Government of Denmark supervises the overall actives and conduct of the service. The DDIS is, as Danish Security Intelligence Service is, subject to regularly control by the Wamberg committee (Wamberg-udvalget), established in 1964, which is controlled by the Ministry of Justice. It is also subject to Folketingets control committee, which was established by law no. 378 of July 6, 1988.

A Hairy Navel or \\"Fuzzy Russian\\" recipe is as follows: 1 part vodka, 1 part peach schnapps, 4 parts orange juice. History The fuzzy navel was one of the first drinks to arise in the new popularity of cocktails and mixed drinks in the 1980s. The drink was invented over 30 years ago by Ray Foley, a well-known bartender and founder of Bartender Magazine. The story goes that Ray was cutting an orange for a garnish when a man nearby made the remark that he could still smell the fuzz of the peach schnapps through the orange juice. Ray looked at the orange and saw the printed word \\"Navel\\" for navel orange. Thus the cocktail was born.

Custody of the reactor was transferred to Idaho National Laboratory after its founding in 2005. Initial operations began in July 1964 and it achieved criticality in 1965 at a total cost of more than US$32 million (US$ million in 2019 dollars). The original emphasis in the design and operation of EBR-II was to demonstrate a complete breeder-reactor power plant with on-site reprocessing of solid metallic fuel. Fuel elements enriched to about 67% 235-U were sealed in stainless steel tubes and removed when they reached about 65% enrichment. The tubes were unsealed and reprocessed to remove neutron poisons, mixed with fresh 235-U to increase enrichment, and placed back in the reactor. Testing of the original breeder cycle ran until 1969, after which time the reactor was used to test concepts for the Integral Fast Reactor concept. In this role, the high-energy neutron environment of the EBR-II core was used for testing fuels and materials for future, larger, liquid metal reactors. As part of these experiments, in 1986 EBR-II underwent an experimental shutdown simulating complete cooling pump failure. It demonstrated its ability to self-cool its fuel through natural convection of the sodium coolant during the decay heat period following the shutdown. It was used in the IFR support role, and many other experiments, until it was decommissioned in September 1994. At full power operation, which it reached in September 1969, EBR-II produced about 62.5 megawatts of heat and 20 megawatts of electricity through a conventional three-loop steam turbine system and tertiary forced-air cooling tower. Over its lifetime it has generated over two billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, providing a majority of the electricity and also heat to the facilities of the Argonne National Laboratory-West.  Design  The fuel consists of uranium rods 5 millimeters in diameter and 33 cm (13 inches) long . Enriched to 67% uranium-235 when fresh, the concentration dropped to approximately 65% upon removal. The rods also contained 10% zirconium. Each fuel element is placed inside a thin-walled stainless steel tube along with a small amount of sodium metal. The tube is welded shut at the top to form a unit 73 cm (29 inches) long. The purpose of the sodium is to function as a heat-transfer agent. As more and more of the uranium undergoes fission, it develops fissures and the sodium enters the voids. It extracts an important fission product, caesium-137, and hence becomes intensely radioactive. The void above the uranium collects fission gases, mainly krypton-85. Clusters of the pins inside hexagonal stainless steel jackets 234 cm (92 inches) long are assembled honeycomb-like; each unit has about 4.5 kg (10 lbs) of uranium. Altogether, the core contains about 308 kg (680 lbs) of uranium fuel, and this part is called the driver. Drawing of the reactor vessel of the EBR-II The EBR-II core can accommodate as many as 65 experimental sub-assemblies for irradiation and operational reliability tests, fueled with a variety of metallic and ceramic fuels—the oxides, carbides, or nitrides of uranium and plutonium, and metallic fuel alloys such as uranium- plutonium-zirconium fuel. Other sub-assembly positions may contain structural- material experiments.  Passive safety  The pool-type reactor design of the EBR-II provides passive safety: the reactor core, its fuel handling equipment, and many other systems of the reactor are submerged under molten sodium. By providing a fluid which readily conducts heat from the fuel to the coolant, and which operates at relatively low temperatures, the EBR-II takes maximum advantage of expansion of the coolant, fuel, and structure during off-normal events which increase temperatures. The expansion of the fuel and structure in an off-normal situation causes the system to shut down even without human operator intervention. In April 1986, two special tests were performed on the EBR-II, in which the main primary cooling pumps were shut off with the reactor at full power (62.5 megawatts, thermal). By not allowing the normal shutdown systems to interfere, the reactor power dropped to near zero within about 300 seconds. No damage to the fuel or the reactor resulted. The same day, this demonstration was followed by another important test. With the reactor again at full power, flow in the secondary cooling system was stopped. This test caused the temperature to increase, since there was nowhere for the reactor heat to go. As the primary (reactor) cooling system became hotter, the fuel, sodium coolant, and structure expanded, and the reactor shut down. This test showed that it will shut down using inherent features such as thermal expansion, even if the ability to remove heat from the primary cooling system is lost. EBR-II is now defueled. The EBR-II shutdown activity also includes the treatment of its discharged spent fuel using an electrometallurgical fuel treatment process in the Fuel Conditioning Facility located next to the EBR- II. The clean-up process for EBR-II includes the removal and processing of the sodium coolant, cleaning of the EBR-II sodium systems, removal and passivating of other chemical hazards and placing the deactivated components and structure in a safe condition.  Related facilities  The EBR-II and the Fuel Conditioning Facility The objective of the EBR-II was to demonstrate the operation of a sodium-cooled fast reactor power plant with on-site reprocessing of metallic fuel. In order to meet this objective of on-site reprocessing, the EBR-II was part of a wider complex of facilities, consisting of * Fuel Conditioning Facility: facility for reprocessing and treating spent fuel from the EBR-II and other reactors, using an electrorefiner for electrometallurgical treatment of spent fuel * Fuel Manufacturing Facility: facility for the manufacturing of metallic fuel elements * Hot Fuels Examination Facility: a \\"hot-cell\\" complex for handling and examining highly radioactive materials remotely * Sodium Processing Facility: facility for processing of reactive sodium into low-level waste  Integral Fast Reactor  The EBR-II has served as prototype of the Integral Fast Reactor (IFR), which was the intended successor to the EBR-II. The IFR program was started in 1983, but funding was withdrawn by U.S. Congress in 1994, three years before the intended completion of the program. The Nuclear Energy division of General Electric, which was involved in the development of the IFR, has presented a design for a commercial version of the IFR: the S-PRISM reactor.

It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction in 2002. \\"National Book Awards – 2002\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-27. (With acceptance speech by Glass and essay by Judy Blundell from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.)  Plot summary  Three Junes follows the McLeods, a Scottish family, throughout their lives and relationships. Its members are Paul and Maureen, and their sons: Fenno, and twins David and Dennis. At the opening of the book, Paul is on a tour of Greece, Maureen has died from lung cancer, and Fenno is running a bookstore in New York City. Other important characters include Malachy, Fenno's friend who is a music critic and suffering from AIDS, and Fern, an unwed pregnant woman, whom Paul formerly met on his trip to Greece, trying to recover from his wife's death. Finally, another important character of the book is Tony, a photographer, who is a house- sitter, never living in the same house for more than a few months. He is a catalyst in the narrative development of Fern and Fenno. He is an old friend with Fern and he develops a tumultuous relationship with Fenno. The novel is written in three parts, using the flashback technique. The first takes place in 1989 and is told from Paul's perspective; the second, in 1995 and from Fenno's point of view; the third, in 1999 and from Fern's perspective. As Julia Glass has said herself, the book should be viewed not as a trilogy but rather a triptych – elements that may seem small in one section play a large role in another, like a triptych, rather than a consecutive series of novels in a trilogy.

Garden State Canoeing, Seneca Press, 2002. The Millstone River begins in western Monmouth County and flows northward through southern Somerset County into the Raritan River at Manville. Almost three quarters of its length is paralleled by the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Both the Millstone River and parallel canal provide drinking water to portions of central New Jersey and provide recreational uses as well. Course The Millstone River starts in western Monmouth County at , near CR-524 (Stage Coach Road). It flows northeast and turns north before picking up a tributary and crossing CR-1, Sweetmans Lane. It then crosses Baird Road before crossing SR-33 and flowing past the watershed of the Cranbury Brook. It turns west, crossing Perrineville Road and Applegarth Road. Meanwhile, it receives many small tributaries. It crosses the New Jersey Turnpike, before flowing through the East Windsor Open Space Acquisition. It then crosses CR-639 and Route 130 before picking up a tributary and flowing into Fischer Acres Associates. It crosses Old Cranbury Road and turns southwest before receiving Rocky Brook and making a turn to the northwest. Millstone Township, where the headwaters for the river are located. It then turns west and crosses Old Trenton Road, John White Road, and Southfield Road before flowing alongside the West Windsor Planning Incentive and crossing Cranbury Road. It receives Cranbury Brook and Bear Brook before receiving Devils Brook and crossing US-1 (Brunswick Pike). It then flows into Carnegie Lake and crosses the D&R; Canal, which it closely parallels the rest of its downstream journey. It turns northeast, receiving Stony Brook from the southwest before turning north again. It receives Harrys Brook and exits the Carnegie Lake. It then enters the D&R; Canal State Park before crossing CR-679 (Georges Rd.). It receives Beden Brook before crossing the Griggstown Causeway and receiving the Simonson Brook directly afterward. By the time it receives Beden Brook, it is paralleled by CR-533, River Road. It then receives the Ten Mile Run and Six Mile Run before crossing Blackwells Mills Road. It receives a tributary from Colonial Park and crosses Weston Causeway. It receives Royce Brook before flowing past the Somerset Christian College, one of the few structures built on the land between the D&R; Canal and the Millstone River. By the time it crosses Royce Brook, CR-533 has separated from it and turned into Manville. It joins the Raritan River at . Flooding The Millstone River basin has suffered a number of severe flooding events over the past 200 years. Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 produced a particularly severe flood in the basin, especially in the Lost Valley section of Manville, which sits on a flood plain between the Millstone River and the Raritan River. Severe flooding once again occurred after Hurricane Irene swept through the area in 2011. Two Millstone River basin flood control and mitigation studies are currently underway by separate governmental bodies to determine if future flooding can be mitigated or controlled: *Millstone River Watershed Flood Damage and Mitigation Analysis Report - USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service *Flood Control Feasibility Study for Manville, NJ - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Water supply The Millstone River provides drinking water to tens of thousands of households and businesses in Central New Jersey. A water intake pumping station is located where the Millstone River and Raritan River meet. The water is purified and distributed by the New Jersey American Water. Commercial history In earliest colonial times as land routes began to supplant sea shipping, commerce between the emerging centers New York City and Philadelphia was carried by stage coach along a direct route from South Amboy to Bordentown. Much later that route became a railroad. A series of New Jersey towns still extant sprouted up along the stage coach route, including South Amboy, Sayreville, South River, Spotswood, Helmetta, Jamesburg, Cranbury, Hightstown, Windsor, Robbinsville, and Bordentown. In general, the stage coach took a bee-line route, straight as the crow flies, between the Raritan Bay at South Amboy and the Delaware River at Bordentown. As the country grew and its economy began to thrive, large buoyant barges supported by water on canals emerged as much more suitable for heavy shipping. Unlike the stage coaches, however, routes for canals were obliged to follow the most level land -- riverbeds. Hence the importance of the Millstone River which provides a north- south waterway through New Jersey connecting the two great cities of Philadelphia and New York. The Millstone River is an important tributary of the Raritan River. The Raritan River empties into the Raritan Bay, a bay of the Atlantic Ocean. The Raritan Bay is contiguous to New York Harbor and separates the New York City Borough of Staten Island (Richmond County) from Central New Jersey along with the Arthur Kill a more narrow channel of water between Staten Island and New Jersey. As the Raritan River flows eastward towards Raritan Bay, it joins the Millstone River flowing north in the vicinity of Bound Brook, New Jersey. The Millstone River traces an arc through several New Jersey Counties, originating in Monmouth County and flowing more- or-less west through Mercer County, then northwest through Somerset County, then northward towards Bound Brook.  Delaware and Raritan Canal  The Delaware and Raritan Canal runs along east side of the Millstone River for much of its length, from Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey to the location where the Millstone River empties into the Raritan River in Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. There the canal continues along the right (south) bank of the Raritan. The land between canal and river is a flood plain that generally consists of swamps, wooded areas and some farmland. A number of spillways allow water to run off from the canal into the Millstone River during periods of heavy water flow. In Lawrenceville, New Jersey, at a site known as Bakers Basin today located along U.S. Route 1, the canal makes the few mile remaining connection into Trenton, the state capital, and then into the Delaware River. Hence the Millstone and Raritan Rivers enabled the major shipping route between New York and Philadelphia in the early 19th century. From New York, of course, goods could be shipped north along the Hudson River and Erie Canal to upstate New York, and thence to Western Pennsylvania, Ohio, and other Great Lakes States upstream of Niagara Falls.

Granny was a kindly woman with a passion for motorcycles, completely oblivious to the fact that her beloved, affectionate pet was something of a neighborhood terror. He had a habit of slipping behind a victim quietly---sometimes in defense of their home, sometimes just for the fun of it---and jolting him with a ferocious series of barks . . . but never where or when Granny could catch him in the act. Unlike many cartoon animals, Precious did not speak. His usual vocalism was an asthmatic-sounding, \\"wheezing\\" laugh used even more famously by Muttley, a Hanna-Barbera character introduced three years later. He usually outsmarted his enemies, most notably Bruiser, the neighborhood bulldog, but he also usually outsmarted his oblivious owner, too. Twenty-six episodes were produced.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1981 to 1985, as a member of the Ontario Liberal Party. Background Spensieri moved to Canada at the age of 13 from the town of Vinchiaturo near Campobasso in the Italian region of Molise. He was educated at the University of Toronto, receiving a Juris Doctor J.D. degree in 1972, and Osgoode Hall Law School, York University, where he was awarded the Master of Laws degree in 1992 specializing in International Business, Trade & Tax Laws. He practiced law in Toronto until October 26, 1989. Politics Spensieri ran for the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election but lost to New Democratic Party candidate Odoardo Di Santo in Downsview by sixty-eight votes. He was elected in the 1981 election, defeating NDP candidate Mike Morrone by 1,187 votes in Yorkview. Spensieri supported David Peterson for the Liberal Party leadership in 1982. In late 1984, he was forced to issue an apology after sending out a newsletter which portrayed the New Democratic Party as \\"a group of socialists committed to the destruction of the separate school system and the murder of unborn children\\".Robert Stephens, \\"MPP Spensieri offers apology for newsletter\\", The Globe and Mail, 12 October 1984.

After politics Spensieri returned to his law practice after leaving the legislature but sought permission to resign from the Law Society of Upper Canada in 1989, after losing count of two million dollars' worth of unclaimed moneys. Spensieri cited a manic-depressive bipolar illness as his defense before convocation, and was granted leave to resign for his own well- being.Rick Haliechuk, \\"Lawyer can resign from bar in mishandling of $2 million\\", Toronto Star, 27 October 1989.

In 1999, the socially conservative Family Coalition Party announced that Spensieri would be its candidate in York Centre for the 1999 provincial election. Due to persistent cardiovascular health concerns, however, he was unable to participate. Spensieri retired from public life and promoted activities and fundraising in the areas of mental health and bipolar disorders. Spensieri died on May 6, 2013. He was 64.

Introduced in 1909 by Martin Kirschner, the wires are now widely used in orthopedics and other types of medical and veterinary surgery. They come in different sizes and are used to hold bone fragments together (pin fixation) or to provide an anchor for skeletal traction. The pins are often driven into the bone through the skin (percutaneous pin fixation) using a power or hand drill. They also form part of the Ilizarov apparatus. Kirschner wires used for fixation of a Colles' fracture Variations * Threaded K-wires are available. Used in situations where backing out of the pin is undesirable, they are inherently weaker than smooth K-wires. * \\"Denham Pins\\" are strong, stout wires with a threaded portion at the midpoint. They are used for skeletal traction, with the threads engaging the bone. This pin was invented in 1956 by the English orthopedic surgeon Robert Arthur Denham (b. 1922). Indications * K-wires are used for temporary fixation during some operations. After definitive fixation they are then removed. The pins are usually removed four weeks post operation. * They can be used for definitive fixation if the fracture fragments are small (e.g. wrist fractures and hand injuries). In some settings they can be used for intramedullary fixation of bones such as the ulna. * Tension band wiring is a technique in which the bone fragments are transfixed by K-wires which are then also used as an anchor for a loop of flexible wire. As the loop is tightened the bone fragments are compressed together. Fractures of the kneecap and the olecranon process of the elbow are commonly treated by this method. * A wire is passed through the skin then transversely through the bone and out the other side of the limb. The wire is then attached to some form of traction so that the pull is applied directly to bone. In traction of the femur for example, the protruding ends of the wire are fixed to the legs of a horsehoe shaped frame which maintains tension in the wire while the crook of the horseshoe is attached via line and pulleys to weights which maintain the traction. * They can be used for temporary joint immobilization. *K-wires can be used to guide cannulated screws to a precise location. Complications * Pin tract infection: Because K-wires often pass through the skin into bone they form a potential passage for bacteria from the skin to migrate into the bone and cause an infection. In such cases, the area around the pin becomes red and swollen and may start to drain pus. Usually this infection clears up after removal of the pin. * Breakage: K-wires may bend or break, especially if the fracture does not heal. * Loss of fixation: Smooth K-wires may back out of the bone losing the fixation. This is especially likely if they pass between two mobile bones. * Migration of K-wires can occur; instead of backing out the wire can move deeper. K-wires passed across the acromioclavicular (AC) joint in the shoulder have been found to migrate into the chest with the potential to penetrate the major blood vessels, the trachea, lung, or the heart. For hand fracture fixation, whether k-wires should be buried or left protruding from the skin remains a topic of debate and a matter of ongoing research.

S.v. \\"Jicama.\\" Retrieved July 18, 2017 from http://www.thefreedictionary.com/jicama Spanish jícama ; from Nahuatl xīcamatl, ), Mexican yam bean, or Mexican turnip, is the name of a native Mexican vine, although the name most commonly refers to the plant's edible tuberous root. Jícama is a species in the genus Pachyrhizus in the bean family (Fabaceae). Plants in this genus are commonly referred to as yam bean, although the term \\"yam bean\\" can be another name for jícama. The other major species of yam beans are also indigenous within the Americas. Pachyrhizus tuberosusPachyrhizus tuberosus and Pachyrhizus ahipa are the other two cultivated species. The naming of this group of edible plants seems confused, with much overlap of similar or the same common names. Flowers, either blue or white, and pods similar to lima beans, are produced on fully developed plants. Several species of jicama occur, but the one found in many markets is P. erosus. The two cultivated forms of P. erosus are jicama de agua and jicama de leche, both named for the consistency of their juice. The leche form has an elongated root and milky juice, while the agua form has a top-shaped to oblate root and a more watery, translucent juice, and is the preferred form for market.  Botany  Other names for jicama include Mexican potato, ahipa, saa got, Chinese potato, and sweet turnip. In Ecuador and Peru, the name jicama is used for the unrelated yacón or Peruvian ground apple, a plant of the sunflower family whose tubers are also used as food. Fresh jícama for sale at a farmers' market The jícama vine can reach a height of 4–5 m given suitable support. Its root can attain lengths up to 2 m and weigh up to 20 kg. The heaviest jícama root ever recorded weighed 23 kg and was found in 2010 in the Philippines (where they are called singkamas). Jicama is frost-tender and requires 9 months without frost for a good harvest of large tubers or to grow it commercially. It is worth growing in cooler areas that have at least 5 months without frost, as it will still produce tubers, but they will be smaller. Warm, temperate areas with at least 5 months without frost can start seed 8 to 10 weeks before the last spring frost. Bottom heat is recommended, as the seeds require warm temperatures to germinate, so the pots will need to be kept in a warm place. Jicama is unsuitable for areas with a short growing season unless cultured in a greenhouse. Growers in tropical areas can sow seed at any time of the year. Those in subtropical areas should sow seed once the soil has warmed in the spring.  History  The jicama originated in Mexico and central America. It has been found at archaeological sites in Peru dating to 3000 BC. In the 17th century, the jicama was introduced to Asia by the Spanish.  In cooking  Tajín chili powder The root's exterior is yellow and papery, while its inside is creamy white with a crisp texture that resembles raw potato or pear. The flavor is sweet and starchy, reminiscent of some apples or raw green beans, and it is usually eaten raw, sometimes with salt, lemon, or lime juice, alguashte, and chili powder. It is also cooked in soups and stir-fried dishes. Jícama is often paired with chilli powder, cilantro, ginger, lemon, lime, orange, red onion, salsa, sesame oil, grilled fish, and soy sauce. It can be cut into thin wedges and dipped in salsa. In Mexico, it is popular in salads, fresh fruit combinations, fruit bars, soups, and other cooked dishes. In contrast to the root, the remainder of the jícama plant is very poisonous; the seeds contain the toxin rotenone, which is used to poison insects and fish. = Spread to Asia = Jícama Spaniards spread cultivation of jícama from Mexico to the Philippines (where it is known as singkamas, from Nahuatl xicamatl), from there it went to China and other parts of Southeast Asia, where notable uses of raw jícama include popiah, fresh lumpia in the Philippines, and salads in Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia such as yusheng and rojak. In the Philippines, jícama is usually eaten fresh with condiments such as rice vinegar and sprinkled with salt, or with bagoong (shrimp paste). In Malay, it is known by the name ubi sengkuang. In Indonesia, jícama is known as bengkuang. This root crop is also known by people in Sumatra and Java, and eaten at fresh fruit bars or mixed in the rojak (a kind of spicy fruit salad). Padang, a city in West Sumatra, is called \\"the city of bengkuang\\". Local people might have thought that this jícama is the \\"indigenous crop\\" of Padang. The crop has been grown everywhere in this city and it has become a part of their culture. It is known by its Chinese name bang kuang to the ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia. In Mandarin Chinese, it is known as dòushǔ(豆薯) or liáng shǔ (涼薯), as sa1 got 沙葛 (same as \\"turnip\\") in Yue Chinese/Cantonese, and as (mang-guang) in Teochew, where the word is borrowed from the Malay, and as dìguā 地瓜 in Guizhou province and several neighboring provinces of China, the latter term being shared with sweet potatoes. Jícama has become popular in Vietnamese food as an ingredient in pie, where it is called cây củ đậu (in northern Vietnam) or củ sắn or sắn nước (in southern Vietnam). In Japanese, it is known as 葛芋 (kuzu-imo). In Myanmar, it is called စိမ်းစားဥ (sane-saar-u).

It is used as a snack by peeling off the outer layer of the skin, then cutting into bite sizes for eating like an apple or a pear.  Nutrition  Jícama is high in carbohydrates in the form of dietary fiber (notably inulin). It is composed of 86–90% water; it contains only trace amounts of protein and lipids. Its sweet flavor comes from the oligofructose inulin (also called fructo-oligosaccharide), which is a prebiotic. Jícama is very low in saturated fat and sodium. It is also a good source of vitamin C.  Storage  Jícama should be stored dry, between 12 and 16°C (53 and 60°F). As colder temperatures will damage the roots, whole unpeeled jicama root should not be refrigerated. A fresh root stored at an appropriate temperature will keep for a month or two.

From 1990 to 2006, he was a Republican member of the Kentucky House of Representatives from his native Barren County in southern Kentucky. In 2011, Nunn received a life sentence without parole after pleading guilty to the murder of his ex-fiancée. Early life He is the son of the late Kentucky Governor Louie B. Nunn and First Lady Beula Cornelius Aspley Nunn. According to several witnesses, Nunn was often ridiculed by his father. He graduated from Frankfort High School in 1970 and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Transylvania University in 1975. He attended the University of Louisville School of Law but did not graduate. Outside of politics In 1987, Nunn bought into an insurance company in Glasgow. He would later become a physician recruiter and consultant for TJ Samson Hospital. Political career Nunn was elected to represent the 23rd district in the state's House of Representatives in 1990 by defeating Democrat Danny J. Basil. The district had precincts in Barren and Metcalfe counties. In 1996, the precincts in Metcalfe County would be replaced by precincts in Warren County. He ran unopposed in 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2004. While in office, Nunn was known as a relative liberal who championed women, children and the disadvantaged. in 1998, he co-sponsored a law making it a death penalty offense for a person named in a domestic violence protective order to kill the person who was protected by the order. He was an advocate for the Kentucky TeleHealth Network which he helped create with the passage of HB-177 and HB-112 in 2000. The network used electronic medical communications systems to help reach patients in rural settings who couldn't travel. In 2001, he was able to pass a bill that gave children in foster care, and former foster care children, the ability to attend state universities in Kentucky for free. In 2005, he was able to pass a pilot program that used $100,000 in Kentucky Department of Medicaid funding to place telemedicine equipment in fourteen schools and fifteen other sites. These sites could connect with clinics and, it was hoped, reduce school time missed for illnesses and avoid costly emergency room visits. Nunn unsuccessfully sought the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2003, finishing third to then-United States Representative Ernie Fletcher of Lexington, whom Nunn then supported. Former State Representative Bob Heleringer, then of Eastwood in suburban Jefferson County, ran as the lieutenant governor selection on Nunn's ticket. In the primary, Nunn received 21,167 votes (13.4 percent), but Fletcher led the four- candidate field with 90,912 (57.3 percent). Rebecca Jackson polled 44,084 (27.8 percent) and Virgil Moore polled 2,365 (1.5 percent). Fletcher went on to win the position in the general election by defeating Democrat Attorney General Ben Chandler, the grandson of Happy Chandler. Fletcher was the first Republican to be elected governor of Kentucky since Louie B. Nunn upset Henry Ward in November 1967. On November 7, 2006, after fifteen years as a state representative, Nunn lost his bid for re-election to the Democrat Johnny Bell. Nunn polled 5,572 votes (46.7 percent) to Bell's 6,371 ballots (53.3 percent). In September 2007, Nunn announced his support of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Steve Beshear, a former lieutenant governor who handily unseated Fletcher in the Republican's bid for re-election. In November 2007 he was appointed to Beshear's transition team. On December 22, 2007, Beshear appointed Nunn as deputy secretary of Health and Family Services. Murder of ex-fiancée In March 2009, Steve Nunn, 56, resigned his state position as deputy director for the Health and Family Services Cabinet after having been placed on administrative leave in February as a result of a February 19 assault in Lexington on 29-year-old Amanda Ross, his former fiancée, who had procured a protective order against him for domestic violence. On September 11, 2009, Ross was found shot to death outside of the Opera House Square complex in Lexington. That same day, Nunn was found by police with his wrists slit in Hart County near the grave sites of his parents. He was arrested and taken to a hospital in Bowling Green where he was stated to be in fair condition from the wounds, which were first considered to be self-inflicted. Nunn was charged with six counts of wanton endangerment of a police officer because when authorities arrived to arrest him, they reported that Nunn had fired a .38-caliber handgun. On September 14, Nunn was taken to the Hart County jail after having been discharged from the hospital. The same day, Nunn was charged by Lexington police with Ross's murder. On September 17, Nunn was transferred to the Fayette County Detention Center. The next day, he pleaded not guilty to the murder charges in Fayette District Court. On November 10, 2009, Nunn was indicted on charges of murder and violating a protective order. Prosecutors intended to seek the death penalty, but on June 28, 2011, Nunn pleaded guilty in Fayette Circuit Court in Lexington to Ross's murder and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the crime. He is currently serving his sentence at the Little Sandy Correctional Complex in Sandy Hook, Kentucky, under Department of Corrections (DOC) ID #246151.Kentucky Online Offender Search (KOOL) - Kentucky Department of Corrections As of November 4, 2014, Nunn was eligible to receive his full state pension of $28,210 annually, based on his legislative and executive department service. State law permits pension benefits to former lawmakers unless they commit a crime while in office as a legislator. Meanwhile, the Ross family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Nunn. In August 2013, a Fayette Circuit Judge ordered Steve Nunn, 60, to pay Amanda Ross's family more than $24 million for killing her outside her Lexington home in 2009. The judge ruled Nunn to pay $20 million for punitive damages. The judge also commanded Nunn to pay $23,000 for medical costs, $27,000 for funeral costs, $3 million for Ross's future earning potential, along with pain and suffering to Ross and to the estate at one million dollars. Amanda's Law In the months after her daughter's murder, Diana Ross began advocating for the protection of other victims of domestic violence. She wanted to bring more light to domestic- violence, under the title of Amanda's Law. The law was passed in 2010 by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It increases the use of GPS tracking units to enhance the protection of victims from domestic violence and their past attackers. Diana pointed out the law that passed was not as strong as she advocated for. Judges can invoke the law on a case-by-case basis after a protective order has been violated. According to the federal Electronic Monitoring Resource Center at Denver University, there are currently 12 states with laws allowing judges to order the wearing of GPS tracking units. The units send an alarm to both the victim and police if the perpetrator enters areas restricted by the protection order.

Admissions are done purely based on the merit and as per the Delhi University norms. Ranking It is ranked 14th across india by National Institutional Ranking Framework in 2020.  History  Founded under the auspices of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) Trust, as a result of the efforts of Durgabai Deshmukh, who was a member of the constituent assembly of India and founder of the Andhra Education Society in Delhi (1948). She approached K. L. Rao (Member of Parliament) and C. Anna Rao (CEO of TTD), after realising the acute shortage of a degree-level college in the city. The primary objective of the college was to cater to the education needs of students from South India. It soon outgrew its regional characteristics and has now become one of the most sought after co-educational colleges of the University. = Foundation = The college started up in 1961 in a school building of the Andhra Education Society in Rouse Avenue (now Deen Dyal Uppadhyay Marg near ITO), New Delhi, with 271 students and 13 faculty members. The foundation stone of the present campus was laid on 20 August 1961 by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, former president of India (then vice-president). The college moved into its newly constructed campus at Dhaula Kuan, New Delhi, on 25 August 1971. In August 2010, the college celebrated its golden anniversary ushering in the fiftieth year of pioneering excellence in the field of education. = Evolution = Sri Venkateswara College came into being through the vision of Durgabai Deshmukh, K. L. Rao and C. Anna Rao in 1961. Initially starting off as a BA pass college, it began by offering B.A. courses in Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Sanskrit. Within few years of acquiring its new campus, and led by its principal V Krishnamoorthy, the college introduced honours courses in arts and science. In 1973 the University of Delhi recognised it as one of its constituent colleges, paving the way for future expansion. From its beginning with just language courses, the college now has academic departments in other disciplines: Economics, Mathematics and Statistics, English, Political Science, History, Botany, and Zoology. The Department of Chemistry which initially provided chemistry papers for other departments was permitted to conduct its own honours course in 1983. Honours courses in Physics (1993), Electronics (1987), and Biochemistry (1989) began. It is a fairly young college in comparison to others of the university which provide honours courses. Infrastructure developments were undertaken starting from 2006 using fund accrued under CPE, Star College, OBC expansion fund, Golden Jubilee fund and TTD grants. The status of College with Potential for Excellence (UGC 2004) and Star College (DBT 2011) were awarded; CPE was withdrawn in 2011 because of lack of NAAC accredition which is absent in all of Delhi colleges. Pass courses in BA, BSc, BCom, Life Science, Biological Science and Honours in Tamil and Telugu were discontinued in 2013.  Administration  The college was established and is run by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams(TTD), a board which organizes the temple of Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. Public involvement in the affairs of the college is through nomination of people from various walks of public life to its Governing Body as per provisions of statute 30(1)(c)(i) of Delhi University Act, 1922. Management of various activities of the college is supervised by the Principal through designated committees. Monitoring of the affairs of the college is done by its Governing Body, Academic Council & Executive Council of the University of Delhi. The Governing Body of the college consist of the following: * Ten members nominated by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams(TTD), one amongst them elected as chairman and another as treasurer. * The principal of the college (ex-officio) member-secretary. * Two members from the university (for two years). * Two members of the teaching staff by rotation according to seniority (for two years), = Principals = * Dr. V Krishanamoorthy 1973-1991 * Dr. A Sankara Reddy 1994-2009. * Dr. P Hemalatha Reddy 2009–2020 * Dr. S Venkata Kumar (Ag.

Outstation students generally reside at student-friendly accommodations in Satya Niketan, South Extension and Lajpat Nagar. Due to its strategic location in the south of the capital city, a sizable number of student is from south Delhi localities, Delhi Cantonment and Gurgaon. Given that most of the popular courses here were started in the early '90s, it is comparatively young resulting in a marked absence of a long illustrious alumni list. Despite the absence of the historical setting, the college has managed to carve out a name for itself owing to two primary factors, first is a dedicated faculty which keep academic standards high and second is the exceptional student crowd which gives it a very cosmopolitan look, making it the most talked about aspect of the college. Student elections are held as per the DUSU format every year. Placements Students are regularly placed every year, after their graduation, in globally renowned companies, like the Big Four of accounting - Deloitte, KPMG, Ernst & Young and PriceWaterhouseCoopers and also at business behemoths like Amazon, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft amongst others. Students pursuing higher studies after graduation have attained admission in prestigious institutions around the world like University of Oxford, London School of Economics, Columbia University, Brown University amongst others and across the country like Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi School of Economics, Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Management amongst others.  NEXUS  Celeb Show at NEXUS 2012 NEXUS, the annual inter- college cultural festival of Sri Venkateswara College, was founded in 1978, and is considered one of the best fests in the city. The three-day festival attracts students from all across the university. The USP of the festival are its professional shows, including the Rock Show and Celebrity Show. Apart from this it holds competitions in Dramatics, Dance, Music, Fine Arts, Literary etc. Renowned rock bands like Parikrama, Indian Ocean, Pentagram, Advaita, Euphoria etc. and celebrities like Kailash kher Sunidhi Chauhan, KK, Mohit Chauhan, Vishal Dadlani, Armaan Malik, Jazzy b, Sukhwinder Singh, Shankar Mahadevan etc. have performed at the festival. The festival is organised by Fine Arts Association(FAA) in collaboration with the Students' Union. There are additional programmes like Venkateswara Swamy's Kalyanam and other poojas for Swami are done on regular basis and the prasadam is shared with students. There is an idol of Venkateswara Swamy in the college campus, which is worshipped regularly.

Classically, this system is defined for the Euclidean plane but one can also consider the system in the hyperbolic plane or in other spaces that suitably generalize the plane. Outer billiards differs from a usual dynamical billiard in that it deals with a discrete sequence of moves outside the shape rather than inside of it.  Definitions  =The outer billiards map= Let P be a convex shape in the plane. Given a point x0 outside P, there is typically a unique point x1 (also outside P) so that the line segment connecting x0 to x1 is tangent to P at its midpoint and a person walking from x0 to x1 would see P on the right. (See Figure.) The map F: x0 -> x1 is called the outer billiards map. Outer billiards defined relative to a pentagon The inverse (or backwards) outer billiards map is also defined, as the map x1 -> x0. One gets the inverse map simply by replacing the word right by the word left in the definition given above. The figure shows the situation in the Euclidean plane, but the definition in the hyperbolic plane is essentially the same. =Orbits= An outer billiards orbit is the set of all iterations of the point, namely ... x0 <\\\\--> x1 <\\\\--> x2 <\\\\--> x3 ... That is, start at x0 and iteratively apply both the outer billiards map and the backwards outer billiards map. When P is a strictly convex shape, such as an ellipse, every point in the exterior of P has a well defined orbit. When P is a polygon, some points might not have well-defined orbits, on account of the potential ambiguity of choosing the midpoint of the relevant tangent line. Nevertheless, in the polygonal case, almost every point has a well-defined orbit. *An orbit is called periodic if it eventually repeats. *An orbit is called aperiodic (or non-periodic) if it is not periodic. * An orbit is called bounded (or stable) if some bounded region in the plane contains the whole orbit. *An orbit is called unbounded (or unstable) if it is not bounded. =Higher-dimensional spaces= Defining an outer billiards system in a higher-dimensional space is beyond the scope of this article. Unlike the case of ordinary billiards, the definition is not straightforward. One natural setting for the map is a complex vector space. In this case, there is a natural choice of line tangent to a convex body at each point. One obtains these tangents by starting with the normals and using the complex structure to rotate 90 degrees. These distinguished tangent lines can be used to define the outer billiards map roughly as above. See S. Tabachnikov's book (cited in the references) for details.  History  Most people attribute the introduction of outer billiards to Bernhard Neumann in the late 1950s, though it seems that a few people cite an earlier construction in 1945, due to M. Day. Jürgen Moser popularized the system in the 1970s as a toy model for celestial mechanics. This system has been studied classically in the Euclidean plane, and more recently in the hyperbolic plane. One can also consider higher-dimensional spaces, though no serious study has yet been made. Bernhard Neumann informally posed the question as to whether or not one can have unbounded orbits in an outer billiards system, and Moser put it in writing in 1973. Sometimes this basic question has been called the Moser- Neumann question. This question, originally posed for shapes in the Euclidean plane and solved only recently, has been a guiding problem in the field. Moser-Neumann question =Bounded orbits in the Euclidean plane= In the 70's, Jürgen Moser sketched a proof, based on K.A.M. theory, that outer billiards relative to a 6-times-differentiable shape of positive curvature has all orbits bounded. In 1982, Raphael Douady gave the full proof of this result. A big advance in the polygonal case came over a period of several years when three teams of authors, Vivaldi-Shaidenko (1987), Kolodziej (1989), and Gutkin-Simanyi (1991), each using different methods, showed that outer billiards relative to a quasirational polygon has all orbits bounded. The notion of quasirational is technical (see references) but it includes the class of regular polygons and convex rational polygons, namely those convex polygons whose vertices have rational coordinates. In the case of rational polygons, all the orbits are periodic. In 1995, Tabachnikov showed that outer billiards for the regular pentagon has some aperiodic orbits, thus clarifying the distinction between the dynamics in the rational and regular cases. In 1996, Boyland showed that outer billiards relative to some shapes can have orbits which accumulate on the shape. In 2005, D. Genin showed that all orbits are bounded when the shape is a trapezoid, thus showing that quasirationality is not a necessary condition for the system to have all orbits bounded. (Not all trapezoids are quasirational.) =Unbounded orbits in the Euclidean plane= In 2007, R. E. Schwartz showed that outer billiards has some unbounded orbits when defined relative to the Penrose Kite, thus answering the original Moser-Neumann question in the affirmative. The Penrose kite is the convex quadrilateral from the kites-and-darts Penrose tilings. Subsequently, Schwartz showed that outer billiards has unbounded orbits when defined relative to any irrational kite. An irrational kite is a quadrilateral with the following property: One of the diagonals of the quadrilateral divides the region into two triangles of equal area and the other diagonal divides the region into two triangles whose areas are not rational multiples of each other. In 2008, Dolgopyat-Fayad showed that outer billiards defined relative to the semidisk has unbounded orbits. The semidisk is the region one gets by cutting a disk in half. The proof of Dolgopyat-Fayad is robust, and also works for regions obtained by cutting a disk nearly in half, when the word nearly is suitably interpreted. =Unbounded orbits in the hyperbolic plane= In 2003, Dogru and Tabachnikov showed that all orbits are unbounded for a certain class of convex polygons in the hyperbolic plane. The authors call such polygons large. (See the reference for the definition.) Dogru and Otten then extended this work in 2011 by specifying the conditions under which a regular polygonal table in the hyperbolic plane have all orbits unbounded, that is, are large. Existence of periodic orbits In ordinary polygonal billiards, the existence of periodic orbits is a major unsolved problem. For instance, it is unknown if every triangular shaped table has a periodic billiard path. More progress has been made for outer billiards, though the situation is far from well understood. As mentioned above, all the orbits are periodic when the system is defined relative to a convex rational polygon in the Euclidean plane. Moreover, it is a recent theorem of C. Culter (written up by S. Tabachnikov) that outer billiards relative to any convex polygon has periodic orbits—in fact a periodic orbit outside of any given bounded region. Open questions Outer billiards is a subject still in its beginning phase. Most problems are still unsolved. Here are some open problems in the area. *Show that outer billiards relative to almost every convex polygon has unbounded orbits. *Show that outer billiards relative to a regular polygon has almost every orbit periodic. The cases of the equilaterial triangle and the square are trivial, and Tabachnikov answered this for the regular pentagon. These are the only cases known. *more broadly, characterize the structure of the set of periodic orbits relative to the typical convex polygon. *understand the structure of periodic orbits relative to simple shapes in the hyperbolic plane, such as small equilateral triangles.

The title is derived from lines in Sir Richard Francis Burton's poem The Kasîdah of Hâjî Abdû El-Yezdî: Originally intended to be the final book in the series, this book continues the chronicles of the adventures of Sir Richard Burton, Cyrano de Bergerac, Alice Liddell, Tom Mix, and Samuel Clemens through a bizarre afterlife in which every human is simultaneously resurrected along a single river valley covering an entire planet. Many questions about the creation and purpose of the Riverworld are answered, but several are left unanswered, prompting Farmer to write a fifth and final novel, Gods of Riverworld, in 1983. Edgar L. Chapman wrote a 1984 biography of Farmer entitled The Magic Labyrinth of Philip José Farmer. Plot The book begins with the Mysterious Stranger, known as X, the renegade Ethical (one of the Riverworld's creators) who posed as the engineer Barry Thorne on the airship Parseval and there murdered Milton Firebrass and several others, all of whom were fellow Ethicals. He is now posing as a Mayan named Ah Qaaq, in the company of the Chinese poet Li Po. Through his internal reverie he reveals that his identity was discovered by Monat Grrautut, the director of the Riverworld project, who recalled 'X' to the Dark Tower to be judged. Against this, 'X' used a remote command to kill all the inhabitants of the tower and stop the resurrections of Riverworld's inhabitants. His reverie when the left bank's 'grailstones' (supplying food and stimulants) fail to operate and are not mended by the Ethicals, who are either dead or confined (like 'X' himself) to the river. After the grailstones fail, the inhabitants of the left bank invade the right for resources, and half of humanity dies in the conflict. Concurrently, protagonist Richard Burton and his friends have joined the crew of King John's ship, the Rex Grandissimus, where Burton, masquerading as a Dark Age British warrior, becomes King John's security chief. One day Tom Mix, Jack London, and Peter Jairus Frigate apply to join the crew; and Burton, recognizing Frigate, attacks him as a spy for the Ethicals. Realizing his mistake, Burton allies himself with Frigate, Mix, and London. Meanwhile, the Ethical Monat Grrautut has boarded Sam Clemens' ship, where he is murdered by the renegade Ethical. Eventually, the two riverboats reach Virolando, a wide lake before the headwaters, home to the pacifist Church of the Second Chance, where Hermann Göring has become a priest. There, King John and Clemens begin an aerial dog- fight, and later a naval combat in which both riverboats are sunk and most of the crews die. King John is killed by Clemens and Clemens dies of a heart attack after being pulled from the water by his mortal enemy Erik Bloodaxe, who has become an adherent of the Church of the Second Chance, and seeks no revenge against Clemens. Among the survivors are Burton, Frigate, Alice, Kaz, Joe Miller, Li Po, Ah Qaaq, and Nur ed-Din (\\"Light of the Faith\\"), now joined by Tom Turpin, Aphra Behn, a man claiming to be Gilgamesh, and Baron de Marbot. They take the only craft to survive the fight upriver, then scale the waterfall at the end of the river and enter the polar sea. At the tower, they expose Ah Qaaq as the renegade Ethical and take him prisoner. He identifies himself as Loga, a grandson of King Priam of Troy, resurrected centuries ago and raised by the alien Ethicals on the Garden World. He reveals the current date is 2307 AD and other stories were false stories to throw off investigators. He reveals also that the Riverworld is a moral test, to allow humanity enlightenment. When the project is brought to a close the souls of those who have not achieved enlightenment will wander the universe aimlessly. Loga, being obsessed with sparing his earthly family this fate, awakened Burton prematurely, recruited Clemens and the others, and diverted a metal meteorite (disrupting social harmony) to Clemens. The protagonists discover a malfunction in the computer which runs the tower, threatening to release the stored wathans (souls), of the people who died on the Riverworld. Göring attempts to fix the computer, but is killed by security measures put in place by Monat, who was a member of the fifth-generation sentient race to receive wathans from the First Race to have wathans. Alice then devises a way to evade this programming, and deactivate the security. Loga is then able to repair the computer.

Astemizole was discovered by Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1977. It was withdrawn from the market globally in 1999 because of rare but potentially fatal side effects (QTc interval prolongation and related arrhythmias due to hERG channel blockade). Pharmacology Astemizole is a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It has anticholinergic and antipruritic effects. Astemizole is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and competitively binds to histamine H1 receptor sites in the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, blood vessels, and bronchial muscle. This suppresses the formation of edema and pruritus (caused by histamine). Despite some earlier reports that astemizole does not cross the blood–brain barrier, several studies have shown high permeability and high binding to protein folds associated with Alzheimer's. Astemizole may also act on histamine H3 receptors, thereby producing adverse effects. Astemizole does also act as FIASMA (functional inhibitor of acid sphingomyelinase).

During both wars, amateurs were in high demand as military radio operators, and QST's staff pitched in for the war effort. As part of its centennial celebration in 2014, ARRL published two volumes of QST reprints from 1915-2013: one on Amateur Radio technology and the other on advertising.

The translation reads: \\"Cross for Dolph. You are 100% assholes!\\" Dolph also known as Dolph the Fascist Hippo is a fictional character appearing in the Danish television show Dolph og Wulff med venner (Dolph and Wulff with friends), played by Danish actor Jonas Schmidt, who is otherwise known in Denmark from another popular comedy series, P.I.S., and a long-running series of Toyota commercials. Dolph is a large, fascist, baby-blue hippopotamus usually appearing armed with a baseball bat. He first appeared as a minor character in the Danish cartoon strip Wulffmorgenthaler, which appears daily in the newspaper Politiken, though he had already been created for the yet unaired TV-show at that point, and a very early version had appeared in the music video for the song \\"Oak Tree Girl\\" by Powersolo in early 2004, directed by Anders Morgenthaler. In 2005, the TV station DR2 aired a show based on the cartoon. Four characters appeared in the show, the two authors of the strip (Mikael Wulff and Anders Morgenthaler) plus two of its minor characters; Dolph and Margit, a feminist and politically correct squirrel. As could be expected, Dolph had a very strained relationship with the show's other characters. The show ran for 10 episodes. Dolph is named after Swedish actor Dolph Lundgren. It quickly turned out that Dolph was the most popular character in the show, and DR2 announced that Dolph would return in 2005. On 28 October 2005, Dolph returned to the screen in a new show co- starring with Mikael Wulff but without both Margit the Squirrel and Anders Morgenthaler. The show had also been renamed from Wulffmorgenthaler to Dolph & Wulff. The show ran for 10 episodes. The next season, now in the format of a talkshow, Dolph og Wullf med venner, began in March 2006. The character has, since that season, been used sparingly, having only reappeared on rare occasions. Personality Dolph suffers from megalomania, uncontrolled rage, paranoia, aggression, and xenophobia, in the literal sense of the word xenophobia, whenever he sees a black person, he starts screaming and attempts to hide; at one time claiming that a single black male was actually an army of tribeleaders from Botswana, as an excuse for his going into hiding. He is a racist, but on closer inspection, he in fact hates virtually everybody else (\\"most German people\\" is a notable exception, highlighting his own ignorance of history). He often refers to himself in the third-person singular. He constantly tries to convince the world that it should accept him as its sole ruler, but is frustrated by his lack of success. Although a Fascist, Dolph has never made any references to either Jews or the Holocaust and is apparently not a declared anti-Semite. Nor does he use any Nazi or Fascist symbols, although he clearly admires Hitler. On the other hand, he has no respect for virtually anyone else, and regrets the abolition of apartheid. He is a firm believer in military dictatorship and nuclear power - preferably in the form of nuclear weapons. He is a firm opposer of democracy. He has - unsuccessfully - attempted to blow up the Danish parliament, Christiansborg. This plan went foul when his accomplice forgot to bring the bomb. Dolph constantly claims that he has received training as both a ninja and by the special forces, and that he is an expert in stealth techniques. He has - so far - provided little proof for any of these stories. The fact that he's incredibly obese seems to point to the contrary. His all-important hero is a Danish elite soldier, B.S. Christiansen , who appeared in episode eight of Dolph & Wulff. Dolph has also appeared in a fight-AIDS campaign , stating that \\"AIDS is a weak disease, it is totally unfit for the society of the future (...) Had it been a strong disease it would go for the strong members of society\\". Dolph has become a cult figure and the show has many fans. The creator Mikael Wulff has in the past expressed dissatisfaction with some of the fans who tend to take Dolph far too seriously and who are actually agreeing with him, seemingly not realising that Dolph is supposed to make fun of racists. Dolph has found a few persons worthy to contribute to what he refers to as \\"the society of the future\\". Those include Steven Seagal, Chuck \\"Texas Ranger\\" Norris, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Danish elite soldier B.S. Christiansen, singer Helmut Lotti (he insists that Helmut Lotti can only be German, while he is actually Belgian), Arnold Schwarzenegger, Danish football player Stig Tøfting, Prince Joachim and most German people. A few members of his list of hopeless cases include baby seals, hippies, male hairdressers, and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Despite Dolph's fondness of his baseball bat, which he believes can solve virtually every problem, the Wulffmorgenthaler show showed no real violence. Dolph & Wulff is more violent, although no real violence is shown. In Dolph & Wulff, episode 1, Dolph apparently kills a character called \\"Mogens, the naughty kitty\\", in order to release himself from a contract bound to by ninja honour. In Episode 2, Dolph creates a diversion to free Mikael Wulff who is held captive by a crazy farmer who wants to kill him with a chainsaw. This is accomplished when he empties a can of acid in a barrel containing the farmer's pet pig. In both examples, no real violence is seen. He often claims to hate Wulff, referring to him as being a hobbit, because of his height, but he actually seems to care about Wulff, saving him on several occasions, and, after a fight where Dolph was essentially fired, he gave Wulff a \\"SWAT Team startkit\\", consisting of a moustache, in an attempt to apologise. Although Dolph adamantly denies it, he only eats salad and certain plant seeds. How he has managed become obese on this diet is unknown. His stomach is highly intolerant to pork. He was seen eating pork in episode 3, which almost instantly caused him to have extremely severe diarrhoea. Dolph fell into coma and was shortly clinically dead following a failed plastic operation but was revived by his hero, B.S. Christiansen. After his return to life, Dolph joined B.S. Christiansen on a secret mission with his squad of special elite soldiers, leaving Wullf without any career possibilities at all, not counting Wulff's idea for a Crocodile Dundee style show, mainly about himself wearing a leather hat. Dolph returned in the next episode, since his mission was accomplished, with 9000 baby seals dead. A running gag with Dolph was that despite his fascist exterior and claiming a huge love of all actionmovies and war, in some cases, such as when he is afraid, woozy or thinks that he is not being watched, he will express love of Meg Ryan, and especially Sleepless in Seattle, of which he hopes that they will make a sequel. The actor inside Dolph, Jonas Schmidt, co-starred with Dolph's great hero B.S. Christiansen in the Danish movie In China They Eat Dogs. Both played police officers. In the video game Hitman: Blood Money, Dolph makes a cameo in a newspaper after the \\"Curtains Down\\" level. It reads \\"Hippo bleu est invisible, personne peut le voir. Partir furtivement comme un ninja japonais. Vous etes tous ouverure d'anus de 100% Oui Monsieur!\\" Translated into English it says something to the effect of: \\"Blue Hippopotamus is invisible, nobody can see him. He leaves stealthy like a Japanese ninja. You are all 100% assholes! Yes Sir!\\" Dolph's eyes appear alongside the quote; also, in the first level, which is featured in the demo, a baseball bat can be found in the target's office, bearing the signature \\"Dolph\\" on it.

The aerial steam carriage, also named Ariel, was a flying machine patented in 1842 that was supposed to carry passengers into the air. It was, in practice, incapable of flight since it had insufficient power from its heavy steam engine to fly. A more successful model was built in 1848 which was able to fly for small distances within a hangar. The aerial steam carriage was significant because it was a transition from glider experimentation to powered flight experimentation. Specifications Patent drawing for the Henson Aerial Steam Carriage of 1843. The Ariel was to be a monoplane with a wing span of , weigh and was to be powered by a specially-designed lightweight steam powered engine producing .The Fort Worth Press, \\"Airplane Invention Was Delayed 60 Years\\", October 11, 1961 The wing area was to be ., with the tail another 1500, yielding a very low wing loading.

The undercarriage was a 3-wheel design. British patent 9478 William Samuel Henson (1812–1888) and John Stringfellow (1799–1883) received British patent 9478 in 1842. thumb > In order that the description hereafter given be rendered clear, I will > first shortly explain the principle on which the machine is constructed. If > any light and flat or nearly flat article be projected or thrown edgewise in > a slightly inclined position, the same will rise on the air till the force > exerted is expended, when the article so thrown or projected will descend; > and it will readily be conceived that, if the article so projected or thrown > possessed in itself a continuous power or force equal to that used in > throwing or projecting it, the article would continue to ascend so long as > the forward part of the surface was upwards in respect to the hinder part, > and that such article, when the power was stopped, or when the inclination > was reversed, would descend by gravity aided by the force of the power > contained in the article, if the power be continued, thus imitating the > flight of a bird.

Aerial Transit Company Scientific American, 23 September 1848 describing the aircraft's display at Cremorne Gardens, London. William Samuel Henson, John Stringfellow, Frederick Marriott, and D.E. Colombine, incorporated as the \\"Aerial Transit Company\\" in 1843 in England, with the intention of raising money to construct the flying machine. Henson built a scale model of his design, which made one tentative steam powered \\"hop\\" as it lifted or bounced, off its guide wire. Attempts were made to fly the small model, and a larger model with a wing span, between 1844 and 1847, without success. The company planned \\"to convey letters, goods and passengers from place to place through the air\\", according to the patent. In an attempt to gain investors and support in Parliament, the company engaged in a major publicity campaign using images of the Ariel in exotic locales, but the company failed to gain the needed investment. There was speculation in the press about whether the Ariel was a hoax or fraud. Stringfellow's son wrote the following: > My father had constructed another small model which was finished early in > 1848, and having the loan of a long room in a disused lace factory, early in > June the small model was moved there for experiments. The room was about > long and from 10 to high. The inclined wire for starting the machine > occupied less than half the length of the room and left space at the end for > the machine to clear the floor. In the first experiment the tail was set at > too high an angle, and the machine rose too rapidly on leaving the wire. > After going a few yards it slid back as if coming down an inclined plane, at > such an angle that the point of the tail struck the ground and was broken. > The tail was repaired and set at a smaller angle. The steam was again got > up, and the machine started down the wire, and, upon reaching the point of > self-detachment, it gradually rose until it reached the farther end of the > room, striking a hole in the canvas placed to stop it.

Mister Marriatt, late of the San > Francisco News Letter brought down from London Mister Ellis, the then leasee > of Cremorne Gardens, Mister Partridge, and Lieutenant Gale, the aeronaut, to > witness experiments. Mister Ellis offered to construct a covered way at > Cremorne for experiments. Mr Stringfellow repaired to Cremorne, but not much > better accommodations than he had at home were provided, owing to > unfulfilled engagement as to room. Mister Stringfellow was preparing for > departure when a party of gentlemen unconnected with the Gardens begged to > see an experiment, and finding them able to appreciate his endeavours, he > got up steam and started the model down the wire. When it arrived at the > spot where it should leave the wire it appeared to meet with some > obstruction, and threatened to come to the ground, but it soon recovered > itself and darted off in as fair a flight as it was possible to make at a > distance of about , where it was stopped by the canvas.

The cytoplasm is blue in an H&E; stain, indicating that it is basophilic. Proerythroblasts arise from the CFU-e (colony-forming unit erythroid) cells, and give rise to basophilic erythroblasts.

Their proliferative capacity is more limited compared to the preceding stage, the CFU-e. In vivo, starting with the proerythroblast stage, erythroid cells undergo several more cell divisions while at the same time upregulating survival genes such as Bcl-xL, acquiring and storing large amounts of iron, ramping up the synthesis of hemoglobin and other erythroid genes (in large part a GATA-1 dependent process that is augmented by the EpoR signaling) and decreasing in cell size, eventually removing their nuclei and being released into the bloodstream as a reticulocyte.

Haecceity is a person's or object's thisness, the individualising difference between the concept \\"a man\\" and the concept \\"Socrates\\" (i.e., a specific person).Gardner, W. H., Gerard Manley Hopkins (1975), p. xxiii Etymology Haecceity is a literal translation of the equivalent term in Aristotle's Greek to ti esti (τὸ τί ἐστι)Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1030a or \\"the what (it) is.\\" Charles Sanders Peirce later used the term as a non-descriptive reference to an individual.Bertman, M. A., Humanities Insights (2007), p. 39 Quiddity Haecceity may be defined in some dictionaries as simply the \\"essence\\" of a thing, or as a simple synonym for quiddity or hypokeimenon. However, the term is sometimes used differently in philosophy. Whereas haecceity refers to aspects of a thing that make it a particular thing, quiddity refers to the universal qualities of a thing, its \\"whatness\\", or the aspects of a thing it may share with other things and by which it may form part of a genus of things.Hicks, P., The Journey So Far (2003), p. 218 Duns Scotus makes the following distinction: While terms such as haecceity, quiddity, noumenon and hypokeimenon all evoke the essence of a thing, they each have subtle differences and refer to different aspects of the thing's essence. Haecceity thus enabled Scotus to find a middle ground in the debate over universals between Nominalism and Realism.Hicks, p. 218 Sociology and philosophy The social construction of reality, ethnomethodology, and conversation analysis are the main streams that elaborated during the 1960s a new kind of sociology—which influenced later sociology, philosophy, and political analysis. Harold Garfinkel is the founder of ethnomethodology, and teacher of Harvey Sacks, one of the founders of conversation analysis. He used the word haecceity in his seminal Studies in Ethnomethodology (1967), to enhance the indexical inevitable character of any expression, behavior or situation. According to him, the members display the social order they refer to within the settings of the situation they contribute to define. The study of particular situations in their \\"haecceity\\" — aimed at disclosing the ordinary, ongoing social order that is constructed by the members and their practicesButton, G., ed., Ethnomethodology and the Human Sciences (1991), p. 10 — is the object of ethnomethodology. In his famous paper generally referred to as \\"Parson's Plenum\\" (1988), Garfinkel used the term \\"Haecceities\\" to indicate the importance of the infinite contingencies in both situations and practices. Also available as: Extract. Garfinkel was drawing on phenomenology and Edmund Husserl, logic and Bertrand Russell, and perception theory and Nelson Goodman. Phenomenology is the field of studying the phenomena as such, and can thus be seen as a contemporary philosophical version of the medieval concept of haecceity. Gilles Deleuze uses the term to denote entities that exist on the plane of immanence. The usage was likely chosen in line with his esoteric concept of difference and individuation, and critique of object- centered metaphysics. Influence Gerard Manley Hopkins drew on Scotus — whom he described as “of reality the rarest-veined unraveller”Duns Scotus's Oxford quoted in Gardner, p. xxiv — to construct his poetic theory of inscape. James Joyce made similar use of the concept of haecceitas to develop his idea of the secular epiphany.Kearney, R., Navigations (2007), pp. 133–4 James Wood refers extensively to haecceitas (as \\"thisness\\") in developing an argument about conspicuous detail in aesthetic literary criticism.Bartosch, R., EnvironMentality: Ecocriticism and the Event of Postcolonial Fiction (Amsterdam & New York: Rodopi, 2013), p. 270.

The two Allied corps managed to escape across the Marne River, but suffered considerably heavier losses than the pursuing French. This action occurred during the Six Days' Campaign, a series of victories that Napoleon won over Prussian Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher's Army of Silesia. Château-Thierry lies about northeast of Paris. After defeating Napoleon in the Battle of La Rothière, Blücher's army separated from the main Allied army of Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. Blücher's troops marched northwest and followed the Marne valley in a thrust toward Paris while Schwarzenberg's army moved west through Troyes. Leaving part of his badly outnumbered army to watch Schwarzenberg's slow advance, Napoleon moved north against Blücher. Catching the Silesian Army badly strung out, Napoleon demolished Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev's Russian corps in the Battle of Champaubert on 10 February. Turning west, the French emperor defeated Sacken and Yorck in the hard-fought Battle of Montmirail on the following day. As the Allies scrambled north toward Château-Thierry's bridge across the Marne, Napoleon launched his army in hot pursuit but failed to annihilate Yorck and Sacken. Napoleon soon found that Blücher was advancing to attack him with two more corps and the Battle of Vauchamps was fought on 14 February. Prelude The Allies were jubilant after beating Napoleon in the Battle of La Rothière on 1 February 1814. In particular, Blücher and his generals believed that the war would soon be over. Pleading the difficulty of supplying the combined armies along a single line of communication, Schwarzenberg agreed to allow Blücher's army to operate along a more northerly route. Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia would march west through Troyes along the Seine River, while Blücher would move north to Châlons-sur-Marne and then drive west along the Marne valley toward Meaux. The Russian corps of Peter Wittgenstein and a Cossack scouting force under Alexander Nikitich Seslavin would provide the link between the two armies. One historian estimated that the two Allied armies numbered 200,000 between them, against 70,000 French. The Allies totally lost contact with Napoleon's retreating army. Already on 4 February, Schwarzenberg started to become anxious about his left flank and began pulling Wittgenstein's corps to the south, away from Blücher. On 5 February, Russian General Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly ordered Seslavin's force away to the extreme left flank without notifying Blücher. Over the next few days, the Prussian field marshal mistakenly continued to believe that Seslavin watched the gap on his left flank. At this time, Napoleon began to consider the possibility of moving against Blücher's army. The French emperor calculated that Marshals Claude Perrin Victor and Nicolas Oudinot with 39,000 troops would be able to hold off the cautious Schwarzenberg. Meanwhile, Napoleon gathered a strike force of 20,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry and prepared to march against Blücher. By 8 February, Blücher's advancing Army of Silesia spread itself out across . Farthest to the west was Sacken's cavalry at Viels-Maisons while his infantry was at Montmirail. The Russian was in pursuit of Marshal Jacques MacDonald's 10,000-man French corps. Also following MacDonald was Yorck's corps which reached Dormans to the northeast of Montmirail. Olsufiev's 4,000-man corps was east of Sacken at Étoges. Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich's Russian corps and Friedrich von Kleist's Prussian corps were farther east at Châlons-sur-Marne. On 9 February, with everyone marching west, Kaptzevich and Kleist reached Bergères-lès-Vertus, Olsufiev arrived at Champaubert, Sacken got to La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, and Yorck approached Château-Thierry. Prussian staff officer Karl Freiherr von Muffling wrote that Sacken had 20,000 soldiers and Yorck's corps numbered 18,000 men while Olsufiev, Kaptzevich and Kleist together counted 19,000 troops. Another source gave Sacken strength as 16,000. Napoleon battles Sacken and Yorck near Montmirail on 11 February 1814. On 9 February, Napoleon arrived at Sézanne with the Imperial Guard after a difficult march over muddy roads. French farmers brought their teams of horses to help pull the cannons through the quagmire. That day, Schwarzenberg asked Blücher to reinforce his right wing. Dutifully, the Prussian commander set out on 10 February with Kaptzevich and Kleist, moving southwest toward Sézanne. As the Allies marched, they heard the distant growl of cannons to their right. It was Napoleon's army falling on Olsufiev's outnumbered corps in the Battle of Champaubert. After an obstinate resistance, Olsufiev tried to break out to the east, but he was captured and his corps effectively destroyed. During the fighting, Olsufiev sent several messengers stating that he was under attack, but Blücher ignored them. The 1,500 Russian survivors of the debacle were organized into 3–4 combined battalions. This hard-luck outfit would suffer 600 casualties and lose all its remaining cannons at the Battle of Vauchamps on 14 February. On 11 February, Napoleon turned the bulk of his army west toward Montmirail. He hoped to catch and destroy Sacken's corps between his army on the east and MacDonald's corps to the west at Meaux. Sacken's soldiers made a night march east toward Montmirail. Though Yorck urged his ally to retreat toward Château-Thierry, Sacken remained unaware of his danger and determined to fight what he believed was a weak enemy force. In the event, MacDonald had broken the Trilport bridge over the Marne, preventing him from striking Sacken's corps from the west. Delayed by the muddy roads, Yorck's tired troops were approaching Montmirail from the north, but still out of touch with Sacken. Napoleon barely managed to interpose some French soldiers at an important road intersection between the two Allied corps. In the Battle of Montmirail, Napoleon with 10,500 men and 36 guns faced Sacken's 18,000 Russians at 11:00 am while the vanguard of Yorck's 18,000 Prussians appeared to the north. By 4:00 pm reinforcements raised the French total to 20,000 and Napoleon went over to the attack. Another historian credited Napoleon with 27,153 troops at Montmirail, while the Prussians believed that 24,000 French soldiers were present. During the early afternoon, the two armies engaged a bitter struggle over the village of Marchais-en-Brie south of the Montmirail-Meaux highway while Napoleon tried to break through Sacken's left wing near the highway. Meanwhile, Yorck's troops attacked from the north at 3:30 pm, only to be repulsed. Finally, the French infantry flushed Sacken's men out of Marchais into the open where they were ridden down by French cavalry. Yorck's belated intervention probably saved Sacken's corps, which retreated to the north that evening. Sacken's corps suffered 2,000 killed and wounded, plus 800 soldiers, 13 field guns, and six colors captured. Yorck sustained 900 casualties and French losses were around 2,000 men. Battle =Forces= =Action= alt=Painting shows a balding man wearing a dark blue military uniform with a gold collar and gold braid on his right shoulder. He wears the Ludwig Yorck On 11 February, Kaptzevich and Kleist turned around and marched back to Bergères. Blücher authorized Yorck and Sacken to withdraw via Château-Thierry toward Reims where his army would reassemble. MacDonald sent Antoine-Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain with part of his cavalry across the Marne to Coulommiers by a roundabout route. The remainder of his cavalry under Horace Sebastiani was unable to cross at La Ferté-sous-Jouarre because Sacken had broken its bridge. Napoleon launched his troops after the beaten Allies at 9:00 am on 12 February. Marshal Édouard Mortier commanded the pursuit on the main highway while Napoleon personally led another column farther west through Rozoy. The French emperor ordered MacDonald to seize the bridge at Château-Thierry. Fabian von Osten-Sacken At dawn on 12 February, Sacken's corps passed through Yorck's lines near Montfaucon. Sacken dropped off a brigade under General Heidenreich that consisted of the Tambov and Kostroma Regiments. Friedrich von Katzler's advance guard stood at Montfaucon with the 1st and 7th Prussian Brigades and the Reserve cavalry of Georg Ludwig von Wahlen-Jürgass in support. Mortier marched to Fontenelle-en-Brie with the 2nd Old Guard Division under Charles- Joseph Christiani, the 1st Voltiguer Division under Claude Marie Meunier, and the Gardes d'Honneur cavalry. Napoleon had Saint-Germain with 2,400 cavalry and Louis Friant's 1st Old Guard Division. At 1:00 pm, Mortier's advance encountered Katzler's Prussians near Viffort and the Caquerets Hills. Katzler's 1st and 2nd East Prussia Infantry Regiments overlooked a stream. The position was attacked by two battalions of Old Guard Foot Chasseurs and Napoleon's duty squadrons led by Claude-Étienne Guyot. Katzler withdrew when the French began turning his flanks. Farther along the highway, the French found Heinrich Wilhelm von Horn's 7th Brigade barring their advance. The 2nd Silesian and Leib Grenadier Battalions defended the right flank while the Leib Regiment held the left flank. While the French forces began to deploy in front, a large force of cavalry under Marshal Michel Ney began to maneuver around the Prussian left flank. These were four divisions of elite cavalry under Pierre David de Colbert-Chabanais, Jean-Marie Defrance, Charles Lefebvre-Desnouettes, and Louis Marie Levesque de Laferrière. At this time, Napoleon sent 200 grenadiers to seize the hamlet of Petite-Noue. Mortier launched six battalions under Christiani in a frontal attack. Aware that he would have to fight with a river at his back, Yorck ordered his wagon train to cross to the north bank of the Marne. Édouard Mortier Yorck ordered Jürgass to move 3,000 Reserve cavalry from the highway to the left flank to counter the French cavalry threat. They were joined by the Brandenberg Hussar Regiment under Friedrich von Sohr. Many of the Prussian cavalrymen were Landwehr - second class soldiers. Jürgass formed his horsemen in two ranks, with the Lithuanian and 1st West Prussian Dragoon Regiments in the first line. There was also a Russian dragoon regiment on hand. Defrance and Laferrière placed the Guard Dragoons in the first line and the Horse Grenadiers, cuirassiers, and horse carabiniers in the second line. As the Prussian front line charged, it was met with a volley of carbine fire from the dragoons. At the same time, the Brandenburg Dragoons charged the 10th Hussars and French dragoons routed the Russian dragoons. Soon there was a large cavalry melee near the Petite- Baloy farm. The French cavalry prevailed, driving the Prussian first line back into its second line, and causing both to retreat in confusion. The French cavalry seized two cannons and a howitzer. Yorck ordered the 1st and 7th Brigades to retreat, which they did in good order. The 15th Silesian Landwehr Regiment shifted to La Trinit farm on the left flank. Many of its soldiers became the victims of French cavalry later in the day. There was also a Russian jäger battalion near La Trinit farm. Forming the rear guard, the Leib Regiment was cut off by a French dragoon regiment, but it made a bayonet charge and broke free. Two battalions of Old Guard Foot Grenadiers and the duty squadrons pressed back the Prussian right flank under Prince William almost to Château-Thierry. Covering the Allied right flank, Heidenreich formed his two regiments into square and tried to retreat. After his troops fired away all their ammunition, they were overrun. Heidenreich and most of his brigade were captured, along with three cannons. A force of French cavalry under Louis-Michel Letort de Lorville circled around Nogentel. As the retreating Prussian column emerged from the village Letort's horsemen charged into the Silesian and Leib Grenadier Battalions and the 5th Silesian Regiment, inflicting numerous casualties and capturing two cannons and a howitzer from 6-pounder Battery Nr. 2. As the Prussian columns withdrew within the streets of Château-Thierry, the 2nd Battalions of the 1st and 2nd East Prussian Regiments under Major Stockhausen formed the rear guard. The Leib Fusilier Battalion under Major Holleben guarded the pontoon bridge. Stockhausen's action allowed other units to escape across the bridge, but by the time his 400 soldiers fought their way to the bridge, it had been destroyed. His 400 survivors were compelled to surrender. A Prussian 12-pounder battery firing from the north bank of the Marne prevented pursuit. Result Château-Thierry countryside. Historians David G. Chandler and Francis Loraine Petre stated that the Prussians had 1,250 casualties, the Russians 1,500, and the French 600. The French also captured nine cannons and much baggage and transport. Other authorities put French losses at 400–600, Prussian killed and wounded at 22 officers and 1,229 enlisted men, and Russian losses at 1,200–1,500 soldiers. That evening, the two Allied corps retreated north to Oulchy-la- Ville. Since the French army lacked a bridging train, it took a full day before the Château-Thierry bridge could be rebuilt. When it was finished, Mortier led the divisions of Christiani, Colbert, and Defrance in pursuit of the Allies. They rounded up 300–400 stragglers and found a number of artillery caissons destroyed by the Allies in their hasty retreat. Napoleon wrote, \\"My Foot and Horse Guard covered themselves with glory … The enemy seemed struck by a singular terror\\". However, the emperor was extremely disappointed that he had failed to destroy Sacken and Yorck. MacDonald hardly budged and failed to capture the all-important Château-Thierry bridge. The next day, Yorck's troops marched to Fismes while Sacken moved to Reims. Prince William's brigade observed Soissons. On 12 February, Blücher waited at Vertus for news from Yorck and Sacken. Since 11 February, Marshal Auguste de Marmont with one infantry division and the I Cavalry Corps watched Blücher. The Prussian field marshal finally decided that Napoleon was retreating. On 13 February, Blücher began pushing west with Kaptzevich and Kleist, compelling Marmont to withdraw to Vauchamps where there would be a battle the next day.

B. Sweeney. The screenplay by John Gatins is based on the book Hardball: A Season in the Projects by Daniel Coyle. The original music score is composed by Mark Isham. The film was released on September 14, 2001, topping the box office the weekend after the September 11 attacks. Plot Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is a gambler who secretly bets $6,000 on his dead father's account and is now severely in debt with two bookies. In order to repay the debts, he is told by a corporate friend that he must coach a baseball team of troubled African-American fifth grade kids from Chicago's ABLA housing projects in exchange for $500 each week, for ten weeks. Worried only about getting his $500 check, Conor shows up at the baseball field to a rag tag bunch of trash-talking, street-wise, inner city kids who live in the projects. Some of the team includes: Andre Ray Peetes (Bryan Hearne), a smart mouthed jokester, captain of the team who knows about all the players and forms a strong bond with Conor; Kofi Evans (Michael Perkins), a troubled, angry boy who has a rivalry with Andre, a quick temper, but is the best player on the team. Other characters include Jefferson Albert Tibbs (Julian Griffith), a sweet, overweight, asthmatic player; Jamal (Michael B. Jordan), Andre's best friend and the oldest on the team; Miles Penfield II (A. Delon Ellis, Jr.), the brilliant pitcher who listens to The Notorious B.I.G.’s ‘Big Poppa’ to pitch well; and Jarius \\"G-Baby\\" Evans (DeWayne Warren), Kofi's much younger brother who is too young to play so he becomes Conor's assistant. Conor's efforts are hindered from the onset by the fact that he does not have nine kids to make up the team—Jamal’s mother altered his birth certificate to be younger and G-Baby is sad because he is far too young to play. The older kids tell Conor it is because their teacher, Elizabeth \\"Sister\\" Wilkes (Diane Lane), is making several boys finish a book report. Conor visits the teacher, but his life is threatened repeatedly by his bookies for not paying his gambling debts. He is visited by the mother of two boys and her sisters son that are allowed to play in exchange for his tutoring them. Conor works to get the team to support each other and stop trash-talking each other's bad plays; but the team nevertheless loses its first game 16–1, which fosters hostility between the players. Conor brings them together by buying them pizza (trading sports tickets for the pizza) and leads the team to win their second game 9–3. The team starts to come together as Conor tries to kindle a romance with Wilkes. Conor risks everything and makes a $12,000 bet with a new bookie to cover the $12,000 debt he owes to the other bookies. His stress, already high from his gambling debts, runs higher at the baseball field because Jamal is pulled from playing after a competing coach questions the boy's age and Myles can't wear headphones while he pitches. Conor takes offense to the league president's threat to be removed, after he voices his objection to his team having to wear ratty T-shirts while the other teams have full uniforms. In protest, he announces it was his last game which draws dissension and resentment from his players. Conor barely wins his $12,000 bet, pays off all his debts, and is pressured into making another bet for $24,000 using his $12,000 winnings. Conor connects with the kids and finds it harder to leave than he thought it would. He surprises them with second row seats (behind Sammy Sosa's dugout) to a major league game. He stops gambling; his relationship with Wilkes grows; he gets new uniforms for the players (sponsored by one of his bookies); and he assumes a fatherly role in leading the team to the championship game (called \\"going to the ship\\" by the boys). Just after Conor drops the kids off at home after winning the pre-championship game, G-Baby is struck and killed by a stray bullet and Kofi has to hold him as he dies. Conor wants to forfeit the game, but Andre and especially Kofi, rallies the team together. The end credits indicate that the kids won the championship game.

The 2008 Appaloosa film (starring Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen) is not related to this film, although it has a similar title. Plot Based on the 1963 book by Robert MacLeod, the title character is a beautiful horse (a breed, the Appaloosa) belonging to Matt Fletcher (Marlon Brando), a Mexican-American buffalo hunter who returns home only to have his beloved horse stolen by a powerful bandit, Chuy Medina (John Saxon) with the help of the bandit's girlfriend, Trini (Anjanette Comer) in the border town of Ojo Prieto. Trini was sold to Chuy at the age of 15, but has been brutalized and effectively discarded. Matt begins to hunt down the bandit to recapture the horse, but finds matters more complicated than expected when he meets the girlfriend of the bandit. Fletcher is subjected to torture and humiliation by Chuy and his minions. A later foray into Medina's camp results in a brutal arm wrestling match in a bar between Fletcher and the bandido. Fletcher loses and is stung on the arm by a scorpion. Again left to die, Fletcher is rescued by Trini, who despises her \\"lover\\", Chuy, and prefers Fletcher's company. She gets him assistance from a kindly old peasant, which later costs the old man his life. During the violence-laden climax, Fletcher is forced to choose between Trini and his beloved Appaloosa.

It was organized on 27 December 1917 at Fort Bliss, Texas, as an element of the 15th Cavalry Division. The brigade's early years consisted of rigorous training and patrolling of the Mexican border. Operating from horseback, the cavalry was ideal for fighting in the harsh desert terrain. It was relieved on 12 May 1918 from assignment and demobilized on 9 July 1919 at Fort Bliss, Texas. It was reconstituted on 20 August 1921 in the Regular Army as Headquarters, 2nd Cavalry Brigade and assigned as a member of the 1st Cavalry Division. The unit was organized on 14 September 1921 at Fort Bliss, Texas. At that time, subordinate units consisted of the 2nd Machine Gun Squadron, the 7th Cavalry Regiment, and 8th Cavalry Regiment. =WWII= In February 1943, the 2nd Brigade was alerted for an overseas assignment as a dismounted infantry unit assigned to the Pacific theater. The Black Jack Brigade's first WWII combat duty occurred in the 1944 Admiralty Island campaign. In three months of hard fighting they seized the islands of Los Negros, Hauwei, Butjo Luo, and Manus, and alongside the 1st Brigade, destroyed a force of over Japanese. The newly secured islands provided a strategically vital offensive base for Allied air and naval power, from which they could disrupt enemy supply lanes in a radius and provide critical support for the Allied advance during the invasion of the Philippines. The Black Jack Brigade was called upon again during the liberation of the Philippines, where the brigade fought in both the Leyte and Luzon campaigns. On 20 October 1944, 2nd Brigade soldiers were among the first to storm the beaches of Leyte in what was the largest amphibious operation to date in the Pacific theater. Their contributions led to a victory that would prove to be decisive in the battle for the Philippines. On 9 January 1945, the 2nd Brigade then participated in the invasion of Luzon, the largest of the Philippines Islands. The brigade was the first into Manilla, liberating the Philippine Capital and freeing over 4000 civilians from enemy prison camps. The conquest of Leyte and Luzon were vital to operations in the Pacific, as they denied critical resources to the enemy and provided a staging area from which assaults in the Japanese home islands could be launched. The brigade left Luzon in August 1945 for occupation duty in Japan, becoming the first Allied unit to enter the city of Tokyo. The brigade was inactivated on 25 March 1949 and relieved from assignment to the 1st Cavalry Division. =German occupation= On 20 May 1949 it was converted and redesignated as the 2nd Constabulary Brigade. The brigade served in Germany until it was inactivated on 15 December 1951. =Korea= On 1 September 1963 the brigade was reactivated again in Korea as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division. The brigade remained at Camp Howze in Korea until 1 July 1965, when the division colors were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia. =Vietnam= The division was reorganized and activated as the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), the Army's first Air Assault division. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara shocked many observers when he announced that this new air assault division would be combat ready in only eight weeks. The 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) exceeded that demanding goal by reaching REDCON-1 status on 28 July 1965 and deploying to Vietnam in mid-August, only six weeks after the division's organization. The men of 2nd Brigade boarded the USNS General Simon B. Buckner on 16 August 1965, en route to Vietnam. On 14 September 1965, the 2nd Brigade disembarked the USNS Buckner and landed at Qui Nhơn. The brigade, consisting of 1/5 Cavalry, 2nd Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, loaded into helicopters and flew in-land to the division base camp at Camp Radcliff, An Khê District. The 2nd Brigade became the first brigade in the division to see combat when on 18 September 1965 the 2/12 Cavalry was OPCONed to 101st Airborne Division to participate in Operation Gibralter. The 2nd Brigade would next see combat in Operation Silver Bayonet, where under the order of US Commanding General William Westmoreland the 1st Cavalry Division air assaulted into Pleiku Province to pursue and destroy the enemy over of jungle. Operation Silver Bayonet, also known as the Pleiku Campaign, was a 35-day campaign in which the division maintained almost constant contact with the enemy and experienced some of the fiercest fighting of the Vietnam War. The division saw its first contact on 1 November 1965, when a troop from 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry Regiment Cavalry, the division's reconnaissance squadron, overran an enemy aid station belonging to the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 33rd Regiment. After landing to exploit the site, they were engaged by a PAVN battalion, in fighting which was too close to allow for artillery or tactical air reinforcement. 1/12 Cavalry, 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment and 2nd Brigade's 2/12 Cavalry rushed to the embattled troop's aid, air assaulting into the fight amidst intense ground fire. They quickly inflicted hundreds of casualties upon the PAVN battalion. On 9 November 1965 3rd Brigade took control of Operation Silver Bayonet and continued the search for the three PAVN regiments suspected to be operating in the Pleiku region. On 14 November elements of 3rd Brigade's 7th Cavalry Regiment air assaulted onto Landing Zone X-Ray in the Ia Drang Valley to conduct a reconnaissance in force in search of the enemy regiments. Soon after securing the LZ, the 7th Cavalry Soldiers began taking intense small arms, mortar, and rocket fire from an enemy force that vastly outnumbered them. The chaotic fighting that followed would be among the most intense of the Vietnam War. After sustaining heavy casualties, 1/7 Cavalry was able to reorganize their units and establish a hasty battalion security perimeter around LZ X-Ray. One of their platoons, however, was cut off from the rest of the battalion, pinned down and trapped amidst a battalion sized PAVN force. The pinned unit, 2nd Platoon of Bravo Company, had suffered heavy casualties, and like the rest of 1/7, would endure multiple enemy attacks throughout the night. 1/7 Cavalry made three separate attempts to rescue the cut off platoon, but all three attempts were met with failure. Early on 15 November, the 2/5 Cavalry air assaulted onto LZ Victor, approximately 3 km south east of the battle. On foot, they fought their way to LZ X-Ray, where after coordinating with 1/7 Cavalry, they pressed forward in search of the lost platoon. The 2/5 Cavalry rescued the platoon, which had been devastated with casualties, and enabled their recovery back to LZ X-Ray. 2nd Brigade's 2/5 Cavalry and elements of 1/5 Cavalry tied into the defense perimeter at LZ X-Ray and played a vital role in repelling and counter-attacking the enemy force over the next two days. On 16 November, the battle at LZ X-Ray was effectively over. The PAVN had taken thousands of casualties and was no longer capable of sustaining a fight. 1/7 Cavalry returned to Camp Radcliff while 2/5 Cavalry, 2/7 Cavalry, and a company from 1/5 Cavalry maintained the perimeter at X-Ray. On the following day, all of the remaining units were ordered off of LZ X-Ray in preparation for a heavy bombing campaign in the area. 2nd Brigade's 2/5 Cavalry marched without incident to LZ Columbus. 2/7 Cavalry, with a company of 2nd Brigade's 1/5 Cavalry attached, marched towards LZ Albany. 2–7 Cavalry marched towards LZ Albany in a column, with 1/5's A Company bringing up the rear. Almost immediately after reaching the LZ, the head of the 2/7 Cavalry column was engaged by a massive L-shaped ambush staged by two battalions of PAVN. The ensuing close-quarters battle was fierce and bloody, with both sides taking devastating casualties. After the initial chaos subsided, hasty security perimeters were formed, with 2/7 Cavalry hunkered down on LZ Albany, while A Company 1/5 Cavalry set a small perimeter 700 meters away. The situation was dire for the soldiers at LZ Albany. They were low on ammunition and water, and the intense fire and close proximity of the enemy disrupted resupply and casualty evacuation efforts, as well as indirect fire and air support. 2nd Brigade's B Company, 1/5 Cavalry rushed to the aid of the soldiers at LZ Albany, landing at LZ Columbus and deploying to the battle on foot. Bravo Company fought their way to the A Company, 1/5 Cavalry perimeter and established and secured an LZ from which resupply and evacuation efforts could finally proceed. 2nd Brigade's men continued to repulse PAVN attacks throughout the night. On the morning of 18 November 1965, after 16 hours of continuous contact, the PAVN finally withdrew, U.S. losses in the action were 155 killed or missing. The firefights at LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany would come to be known as the Battle of Ia Drang. While sustaining heavy casualties, the 2nd and 3rd Brigades estimate that they killed more than 1700 PAVN soldiers and destroyed two full regiments of a PAVN division. For its actions during Operation Silver Bayonet, the 1st Cavalry Division earned the first Presidential Unit Citation awarded to a unit in Vietnam. On 4 January 1967, 2nd Brigade participated in Operation Matador. Along with 1st Brigade, they air assaulted within the Bình Định Province to conduct a search and destroy mission against the PAVN 3rd Division. During this operation the units witnessed enemy soldiers fleeing into Cambodia, confirming for the first time the PAVN's use to sanctuaries in the neighboring country. On 7 February 1967, 2nd Brigade took part in Operation White Wing, where they again conducted a search and destroy mission targeting the 3rd Division. All three regiments of the 2nd Brigade deployed to the Iron Triangle, a well-fortified defensive position thought to be the regimental headquarters of the PAVN in the Bình Định region. On 6 March 1967 Operation White Wing concluded as a major tactical success. 2nd Brigade maintained constant contact with the enemy over the entirety of the operation. Five of the 3rd Division's nine battalions were rendered combat ineffective and the PAVN temporarily lost its grip on the Bình Định Province. On 16 May 1967, 2nd Brigade took part in Operation Crazy Horse, a search and destroy mission against the 2nd Viet Cong Regiment in the jungle covered hills between Soui Ca and the Vinh Thanh Valleys. For his heroic actions in support of Operation Crazy Horse, 2nd Brigade's SSG Jimmy G. Stewart was awarded the Medal of Honor. 2nd Brigade next participated in Operation Paul Revere II, where the first and second battalions of the 5th Cavalry Regiment inflicted heavy casualties on an enemy battalion at the Battle of Hill 534. On 13 September 1966, 2nd Brigade participated on Operation Thayer I, a search and destroy campaign in the Bình Định Province which would involve one of the largest air assaults ever attempted by the 1st Cavalry Division. 2nd Brigade's PFC Billy Lauffer was awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions in support of Operation Thayer I. On 31 October 1966, 2nd Brigade launched Operation Paul Revere IV, a search and destroy campaign focusing on Chu Pong, the Ia Drang Valley and the Cambodian border area. C Company, 1/5 Cavalry engaged in a fierce battle with a PAVN force vastly outnumbering them. C Company endured catastrophic casualties, but succeeded in driving the enemy from the area and inflicting hundreds of casualties to a PAVN regiment. Following Operation Paul Revere IV, 2nd Brigade engaged in Operation Thayer II, a search and destroy campaign in the Bình Định Province. When the campaign concluded in early 1967, the 1st Cavalry Division had destroyed two enemy regiments and inflicted more than 1500 enemy casualties. The 2nd Brigade distinguished itself next in Operation Pershing, which initiated on 13 February 1967. Operation Pershing was a massive search and destroy mission in the northern Bình Định Province, in which the 1st Cavalry Division committed all three of its brigades to the same area for the first time in Vietnam. In April 1967, while in support of Operation Pershing, 2nd Brigade conducted Operation Lejeune in the Marine-controlled Quảng Ngãi Province. The operation was conducted to free up Marines in the Quảng Ngãi area of operations and facilitate their movement further north. It was almost immediately apparent that the enemy in the Quảng Ngãi region was not prepared for the challenges posed by a brigade of air cavalry troopers. The enemy dispersed and hid, and only little and sporadic contact was initiated until 16 April 1967. Operation Lejeune concluded successfully on 22 April 1967, and the 2nd Brigade returned to the Bình Định Province to continue rooting out the deeply entrenched enemy forces there. On 21 January 1968, Operation Pershing was concluded. In 11 months of fighting the division engaged in 18 major battles and numerous minor skirmishes, inflicting over 7000 enemy casualties. Four 2nd Brigade soldiers, Specialist Fourth Class Charles Hagemeister, Specialist Fourth Class George Ingalls, Specialist Fifth Class Edgar McWethy and Specialist Fourth Class Carmel Harvey were awarded the Medal of Honor for their heroic actions in support of Operation Pershing. On 22 January 1968, the 1st Cavalry Division relocated to the Quảng Trị Province to participate in Operation Jeb Stuart. As a result of the division's relocation for Operation Jeb Stuart, it was in excellent position to respond to the Tet Offensive. On 31 January 1968 the PAVN and Vietcong conducted a widespread and well- coordinated assaults on towns and cities across South Vietnam. Thousands of PAVN/VC fighters overran the city of Huế, while five battalions of PAVN attacked Quang Tri City. 2nd Brigade's 1/5 Cavalry, alongside the 1/12 Cavalry, quickly responded and moved into the village of Thon an Thai, just east of Quảng Trị City. They launched a heavy aerial rocket attack against the PAVN, forcing them to break off the Quảng Trị attack and disperse. Quảng Trị City was liberated within the next ten days. On 2 February 2 Brigade's 2/12 Cavalry was tasked with sealing off the western approaches to the city of Huế, while the ARVN and Marines cleared out the PAVN/VC forces inside the city. After 25 days of fierce block-by-block fighting, the ARVN/Marine force succeeded in liberating the city. During the battle for Hue, the PAVN/VC suffered more than 8000 casualties. While the 1st Cavalry Division was repelling the Tet Offensive, the 26th Marine Regiment was taking heavy bombardment and ground attacks at the Khe Sanh Combat Base. On 1 April 1968, the 2nd Brigade, alongside other 1st Cavalry Division elements, conducted Operation Pegasus in order to relieve the Marines at Khe Sanh. The 1st Cavalry Division completed the relief of the Marine units on 10 April and assumed responsibility for the Khe Sanh area of operations. When Operation Pegasus was concluded several days later, more than 1200 enemy fighters had been killed. On 27 June 1968, 2nd Brigade took the lead in Operation Jeb Stuart III, a search and destroy mission in the Quang Tri Province. They decimated a PAVN infantry battalion at the village of Binh An, inflicting over 200 casualties. On 1 May 1970, the First Cavalry Division conducted a search and destroy mission in the Fishhook region of Cambodia, in what had previously been an untouched PAVN/VC stronghold. On 8 May, the 2nd Brigade discovered Rock Island East, a munitions dump where they secured more than 6.5 million anti-aircraft rounds, 500,000 rifle rounds, and thousands of rockets. On 5 May 1971, the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division's colors were moved from Vietnam to Fort Hood, Texas, bringing the 2nd Brigade's actions in the Vietnam War to a close. For 68 months 2nd Brigade was in almost constant contact with the enemy. =Peace= The era from the Vietnam War until the Persian Gulf War was marked by unit reorganization and constant training. In 1979, 2nd Brigade participated in the Return of Forces to Germany (REFORGER) exercise. The brigade deployed to Germany to simulate the defense of Western Europe against a Soviet invasion force. In 1980, the brigade traveled to Fort Irwin, California to participate in Operation DESERT HORSE. There they conducted the largest peacetime field operation to date, participating in six weeks of intense combined arms training and live fire exercises. During this operation the Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) was employed for the first time in training. The 2nd Brigade conducted additional REFORGER exercises in Germany in 1983 and 1987. =Desert Shield= In the Persian Gulf War, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield. XVIII Airborne Corps, which included the 1st Cavalry Division, was tasked with defending in depth in order to prevent the seizure of eastern Saudi Arabia by Iraqi forces. The division was designated as corps' counter-attack force. As the war progressed into the offensive stage, the 1st Cavalry Division's mission changed in order to support the impending invasion of Iraq. In mid-February 1991, prior to the ground invasion of Iraq, the division fought the Battle of Ruqi Pocket, a critical feint designed to make the enemy believe that the main coalition ground attack would occur at the Wadi al-Batin region of the Iraq-Saudi border. On 15 February 1991, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Berm Buster, where they breached the defensive berm between Saudi Arabia and Iraq to feign the initial stages of a ground invasion. Later that night, the Black Jack Brigade participated in Operation Red Storm, an artillery and aviation barrage of Iraqi border targets designed to suggest that the area was being prepped for assault. On 19 February, the 2nd Brigade's Task Force 1–5 Cav conducted Operation Knight Strike, a reconnaissance in force through the Wadi al-Batin, becoming the first coalition unit to enter Iraq. The task force suffered 12 casualties, but successfully accomplished its mission of simulating the reconnaissance efforts for an impending invasion. The feints at the Wadi al-Batin allowed VII Corps and XVIII Airborne Corps to stage themselves to the far west in preparation for the actual invasion on G-Day, 24 February 1991. It also tied up four Iraqi divisions in the Wadi al-Batin region, where the Iraqis were now convinced that the main attack would occur. On G-Day, 24 February 1991, the Black Jack Brigade conducted Operation Deep Strike. As the VII and XVIII Corps were beginning to mount the main invasion of Iraq to their far west, the Black Jack Brigade pressed into Iraq once more through the Wadi al-Batin and feinted as though they led the main invasion force. The brigade fought throughout the night and following day, fixing four Iraqi divisions and allowing the main invasion force to envelop the enemy from their west flank. With its mission an unqualified success, the Black Jack Brigade withdrew back through the Wadi al-Batin and united with the VII Corps' assaulting force to pursue and destroy the Iraqi Republican Guard in the Basra Region. In August 1995, the Black Jack Brigade deployed to Kuwait to conduct Operation Intrinsic Action 95–3, a rotational force on force training exercise. The Black Jack soldiers deployed on 48 hours notice, and 2 months ahead of schedule, in response to aggressive actions by Iraq. Following a highly successful training rotation, the brigade redeployed to Fort Hood in November 1995. =Peace= From 1995 to 1998 the Black Jack Brigade deployed to four National Training Center rotations and Foal Eagle 97 where, as the first fully modernized brigade in the Army, it was the first US Army unit to deploy the M1A2 tank and the M88A2 recovery vehicle outside the continental United States. =Bosnia= In March 1999, the Black Jack Brigade deployed to Bosnia-Herzegovina in support of Operation Joint Forge as part of Stabilization Force 5 (SFOR 5), a NATO-led multi-national peace keeping force. The Black Jack Brigade conducted a relief in place with the 1st Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division in order to maintain peace and stability in Bosnia- Herzegovina. During a critical period involving the Brcko Implementation Decision and the air war against the Former Republic of Yugoslavia, Black Jack soldiers maintained peace and stability. In October 1999, the brigade returned to Fort Hood, Texas where it served as division ready brigade for the 1st Cavalry Division for seven months =Operation Enduring Freedom= In November 2001, the Black Jack Brigade Combat Team deployed to Kuwait as a participant in Operation Enduring Freedom as a direct response to the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. The brigade combat team prepared and subsequently deployed 14 days after notification and returned to Fort Hood, Texas in early April 2002. =Iraq War= The brigade was integral in assisting the 4th Infantry Division deploy to Iraq, as well as preparing 1st Cavalry Division Soldiers and equipment to deploy to Iraq. The brigade stood down for the Iraq deployment in April 2003 and soon followed this mission with a National Training Center rotation in July 2003. The Black Jack Brigade deployed to Iraq in January 2004 as the lead element for the 1st Cavalry Division in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom I. During the initial deployment, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team was attached to the 1st Armored Division and patrolled Western Baghdad. The brigade fell back under the 1st Cavalry Division in May 2004. During the brigade's Operation Iraqi Freedom I/II 14-month deployment Black Jack soldiers saw action in Western Baghdad, An Najaf, Fallujah, and Northern Babil. =Peace= Following the deployment, the Black Jack Brigade underwent a transformation to the US Army's modular force structure. As part of the transformation, various assets that had been habitually assigned to the brigade during operations, but assigned to the 1st Cavalry Division as a whole, were made organic to the brigade or were integrated into a brigade special troops battalion. Headquarters, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reorganized and redesignated on 17 October 2005 as Headquarters, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division. Headquarters Company, 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division thereafter had a separate lineage. The reorganized 2nd Brigade Combat Team lost 2–12th Cavalry, but gained an organic cavalry squadron (4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment), a field artillery battalion (3rd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment), and 15th Brigade Support Battalion. =Hurricane Katrina= During the transformation, the Black Jack Brigade deployed to New Orleans, Louisiana within 48 hours of notification. Under the command of Colonel Bryan Roberts (later Brigadier General Bryan Roberts) in support of the humanitarian relief effort following Hurricane Katrina in the Algiers District. During the deployment, the Black Jack Brigade provided humanitarian and military assistance to the local government and citizens of the Algiers district. =Iraq= The 2nd Brigade Combat Team returned to Iraq for its second deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in October 2006 under the command of Colonel Roberts. The brigade assumed responsibility for central and southern Baghdad from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized). On 23 November 2006, the 2nd Brigade Combat Team formally assumed responsibility of the area of operations from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. Black Jack battalions assumed a variety of counterinsurgency missions to repair and rebuild Iraq. By the fall of 2007, the brigade enjoyed successes both in combat operations and along all major lines of operation: security, economic, essential services and governance. In January 2008, the brigade returned to Fort Hood, Texas after 15 months of continuous combat operations and began preparing to return to Iraq in January 2009 to the Sadr City and Adhamiyah neighborhoods of Baghdad as part of Multi-National Division Baghdad. The brigade was diverted at the last minute to support operations in northern Iraq. At the time, Kirkuk was generally considered to be one of the most contentious areas in Iraq. The Black Jack Brigade conducted a partnership ceremony with the Iraqi Police and 12th Iraqi Army Division at Forward Operating Base Warrior on 14 February 2009. Kirkuk had been the only Iraqi province that did not participate in the January 2009 provincial elections due to outstanding political disputes. The fate of the ethnically diverse province, an unknown combination of primarily Kurdish, Arab, Turkmen and Assyrian ethnicities, had not yet been resolved. The mission of the brigade was to reduce the tension among the northern Iraq Kurds and Arabs and to disrupt the very active insurgency that was limiting forward progress for Kirkuk. The Black Jack Brigade partnered with Iraqi police, the 12th Iraqi Army Division, and provincial and local civilian leadership to reduce violence by nearly 80 percent in one year. They also worked to significantly improve economic opportunities throughout the province by leveraging projects to create nearly 16,000 jobs in an area that was suffering from approximately 30 percent unemployment. They were replaced by the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division on 20 December 2009. In March 2010, Kirkuk participated in national elections for the first time since the invasion in 2003, with approximately 79-percent voter participation and no reported acts of violence. =Afghanistan= The brigade also deployed to Afghanistan during 2013–2014. =South Korea= The brigade was deployed to South Korea =Germany= In October 2019, the Brigade deployed to the European continent in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve. The Brigade is operating in Poland, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Germany, Hungary, and Georgia.

He was previously the head coach at Texas Tech University from 2000 to 2009, where he became the winningest coach in school history, and at Washington State University from 2012 to 2019, where he recorded the third-most wins of any coach in school history. Leach is known for building potent offenses, directing passing-oriented teams in a spread offense system known as the air raid offense, which Leach developed with Hal Mumme when Mumme was head coach and Leach was offensive coordinator at Iowa Wesleyan, Valdosta State, and Kentucky in the 1990s. Leach's offenses with Mumme, and later as a head coach himself, have broken numerous school and NCAA records.  Early life  Born to Frank and Sandra Leach in Susanville, California, Leach claims Cody, Wyoming, as his hometown. He was raised a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He graduated from Cody High School in 1979 and then attended Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah, where he closely followed the exploits of the football team. Led by head coach LaVell Edwards, offensive coordinator Norm Chow, and quarterbacks Marc Wilson, Jim McMahon, and Steve Young, BYU played a pass-oriented offense, which was uncommon in college football at that time. Leach graduated in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in American studies.Coach of the Month In 1986, Leach earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from Pepperdine University School of Law in Malibu, California. He is also one of the most prominent graduates of the United States Sports Academy in Daphne, Alabama, from which he earned a Master's of Sports Science in Sports Coaching in 1988. Coaching career = Early coaching career = Leach began his coaching career as an assistant at Cal Poly (1987) and College of the Desert (1988). He also served as head coach of the Pori Bears in the American Football Association of Finland in 1989. Also in 1989, he joined Hal Mumme's staff at Iowa Wesleyan University as offensive coordinator. The pair spent three seasons there before moving to Valdosta State (1992–1996) and then Kentucky (1997–1998). The partnership was known for the development of the air raid offense, which allowed their teams to rank highly in offensive statistics and set numerous records. Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch became a No. 1 overall NFL draft pick. For the 1999 season, Leach joined the Oklahoma staff under head coach Bob Stoops. Oklahoma's offense, which had ranked 11th in the Big 12 Conference in 1998, improved under Leach to first in the conference in 1999. =Texas Tech= After one year at Oklahoma, Leach was hired as head coach of the Texas Tech Red Raiders, another Big 12 member. The Leach-coached Red Raiders' best finishes came with three nine-win seasons in 2002, 2005, and 2007 and an 11-win season in 2008. In 2002, Tech swept its in-state conference rivals Baylor, Texas, and Texas A&M; for the first time since 1997 and then defeated Clemson, 55–15, in the Tangerine Bowl. It was the Red Raiders' first postseason win since 1995 when they beat the Air Force Falcons in the Copper Bowl. In 2005, the Red Raiders opened their season with a 6–0 record, their best start since 1998. Leach built a strong passing offense at Tech, where the Red Raiders led the NCAA in passing yardage for four years in a row. He inserted Kliff Kingsbury at quarterback for three years. Kingsbury broke the NCAA records for completions in a career. Kingsbury was succeeded at the position by B. J. Symons, who produced the most passing yards in a season in NCAA history. Sonny Cumbie followed, leading the Red Raiders to an upset of the then-4th ranked California in the Holiday Bowl. Cody Hodges succeeded Cumbie, and subsequently lead the NCAA in passing. Graham Harrell, the first non-senior starting QB since Kingsbury, struggled early in the 2006 season. However, he showed steady improvement beginning with the game against Iowa State and ended the season with a record-setting comeback victory over the Minnesota Golden Gophers. Harrell also set NCAA records for passes completed in a season and career amongst others. Leach, shown on the left, made a U.S. Navy air traffic controller an honorary team captain for the 2004 Holiday Bowl Under Mike Leach, Texas Tech was known for its high-scoring offense and come- from-behind victories. A 70–35 win over TCU in 2004 began with TCU leading 21–0 with eight minutes remaining in the second quarter. Before Tech's scoring drives started, a TCU defensive back was caught mouthing into a TV camera, \\"They aren't going to score.\\" Later in the season, Texas Tech beat Nebraska, 70–10, forcing the Cornhuskers to give up more points in a single game than they had before in their 114-year history. In 2005, the Red Raiders were losing to Kansas State, 13–10, late in the second quarter but won the game 59–20. Also in 2005, Tech had a halftime lead of 14–10 over Texas A&M.; By the end of the game, they increased the margin to 56–17. It was the Aggies' worst loss to the Red Raiders in the 64-year-old series. Mike Leach was chosen to coach the South team during the 2007 inaugural Inta Juice North-South All-Star Classic game. At the end of the 2008 season, Leach was 76–39 with the Red Raiders, including 7–2 against the Texas A&M; Aggies and 2–7 against the Texas Longhorns.Mack Brown Football.com With a 5–4 record, he is the all-time winningest coach in postseason play in Tech football history. Leach was one of only sixteen active college football coaches who had never had a losing season after he left Texas Tech. This was followed by a 3–9 season in his seminal year with Washington State. Of those, he is among nine who have been a head coach for at least five seasons. In February 2009, Leach signed a three-year contract extension with Texas Tech that would pay him at least $2.5 million per year if he stayed in place through 2013. Leach's guaranteed compensation would have been $1.6 million in 2006, $1.65 million in 2007, $1.75 million in 2008, $1.85 million in 2009 and $2.15 million in 2010.The Lubbock Avalanche- Journal: Leach to become $2 million man 2007 Texas game controversy During his post-game press conference after the 2007 loss against Texas, Leach used most of his time to rail against the officiating crew for what he felt were bad calls. He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin, because they were incompetent, or possibly because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference. Jim Vertuno of the Associated Press wrote \\"Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter. The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground. On the next play, a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty. Leach also wanted, but didn't get, a flag for roughing the quarterback.\\" The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal reported, \\"Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials, so Leach's actions leave him open to reprimand, fine or worse.\\" ESPN reported, \\"Big 12 official spokesman Bob Burda did not immediately respond to telephone messages seeking comment. Leach's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension.\\" On November 13, 2007, the Big 12 fined Leach $10,000, the largest fine in Big 12 history. Leach also received a reprimand and was warned that further violations could result in suspension. In a Big 12 coaches' conference call that day, Leach added that he did not regret making any of the comments. Leach announced that he would appeal the fine. Tech alumni and fans began raising money to aid Leach in paying the penalty in the event that it was upheld. Optionally, the proceeds raised could be used charitably. So, just before Christmas 2007, Leach requested that the nearly $5,000 raised to that point be spent on 400 hams to be given free to families in Lubbock, Texas. Future donations were to go to the university or athletic department. Following the 2008 Gator Bowl, in which Virginia scored twice on penalties against Tech for intentional grounding in the end zone, Leach joked, \\"I felt like we had a back there on the one safety, but I don't comment on officiating. I just give out hams is what I do.\\"Texas Tech Sports presented by The Lubbock Avalanche- Journal 2008 season Leach, along with players Graham Harrell and Michael Crabtree were featured on the cover of the 2008 edition of Dave Campbell's Texas Football. The magazine predicted that the 2008 Red Raider football team would be the best in Texas and would challenge for the Big 12 South title. Following a 9–0 beginning to the season, including a win over the undefeated #1 Texas Longhorns, Texas Tech Athletic Director Gerald Myers announced that the university would renegotiate Leach's contract following the conclusion of the football regular season and give him an extension. The Red Raiders ended the 2008 regular season with 11 wins and 1 loss, the best in school history. The season also marked the first win over a #1 ranked team. Tech, along with Oklahoma and Texas, shared the Big 12 Conference South division title. On December 2, 2008, the Associated Press named Leach the Big 12 Coach of the Year. He received 16 votes for the honor by the agency's panel, while Texas' Mack Brown got 4. He won co-Coach of the Year honors from the Big 12 coaches; Oklahoma's Bob Stoops received the same recognition for the same season. The Dallas Morning News named him Coach of the Year as well. He garnered the 2008 George Munger Award, which is given annually to the top college coach of the year by the Maxwell Football Club. After much controversy about how the tie-breaker should be handled between Texas, Oklahoma, and Texas Tech fans, the Red Raiders ended up being left out of the BCS because of a rule that states only two teams from each conference could enter BCS play per season. Oklahoma won the tie-breaker on account of their higher BCS ranking, ultimately losing to Florida in the national championship. Texas Tech also ended up losing that year in the Cotton Bowl to Ole Miss 47–34. Leach interviewed for the University of Washington head coaching job, which was vacated by Tyrone Willingham. ESPN reported that Leach withdrew his name from the coaching search following his interview. Auburn, where Tommy Tuberville resigned, had also been rumored to have contacted Leach. In an interview with the Associated Press, Tech quarterback Graham Harrell stated that there was a \\"great chance\\" Leach could leave. Harrell noted that Leach might leave for a newer challenge. After Leach withdrew his name from consideration for the Washington job, Harrell retracted his statements and believed Leach would remain the Red Raiders' coach. Tech athletic director Gerald Myers had indicated that he would give a raise to Leach before Tech's bowl game, which he later negotiated. Leach and the university settled on a 5-year extension worth $12.7 million after months of negotiations over the clauses of the contract. 2009 season On October 31, 2009, after the Red Raiders' win over Kansas, Leach tied his predecessor Spike Dykes as the all-time winningest coach in Texas Tech's 85-year football history. On November 21, 2009, Leach passed Dykes for first all-time on the school's wins list with a win over Oklahoma. Firing On December 28, 2009, Leach was suspended indefinitely by Texas Tech pending investigation of alleged inappropriate treatment of Adam James, son of former SMU and New England Patriots running back (and former ESPN college football analyst) Craig James. On December 16, James suffered a concussion. He was examined the next day, and told not to practice that afternoon due to the concussion. According to a James family source, Leach ordered him to stand in the equipment room near the Raiders' practice facility. According to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, school officials claim they gave Leach an ultimatum to apologize to James in writing by December 28 or Leach would be suspended. His attorney, Ted Liggett, disputed the characterization of events as reported by the university and other news sources, and said that James had been treated reasonably in light of his condition.Leach suspended after player alleges abuse. Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, December 29, 2009. Leach immediately sought an injunction that would allow him to coach in the 2010 Alamo Bowl. However, on December 30, Texas Tech fired Leach, calling his refusal to apologize to James \\"a defiant act of insubordination.\\" This was the day before Leach was reportedly owed an $800,000 tenure bonus and over $1,700,000 for contractual guaranteed income for 2009. Texas Tech lawyers handed a termination letter to Liggett just minutes before the two sides were to appear in a Lubbock courtroom for a hearing. Liggett was also told that Leach would not be allowed to coach in the Alamo Bowl regardless of how the hearing turned out. School officials later said that other incidents had come to light during its investigation of Leach, but declined to elaborate. Defensive coordinator Ruffin McNeill was named interim head coach and led the team during their appearance in the Alamo Bowl. In a statement, Leach said that he believed the firing was motivated in part by simmering acrimony over the contract negotiations. He also said he planned to sue Texas Tech for wrongful termination. On December 31, Leach spoke with The New York Times in his first interview since being fired from Texas Tech. He said that he did not know where James had been taken, having only ordered him taken \\"out of the light.\\" He claimed the controversy stemmed from Craig James' constant lobbying for more playing time for his son, whom he characterized as lazy and feeling entitled.Evans, Thayer; Thamel, Pete. Leach Denies He Mistreated Player. New York Times, January 1, 2010. On January 8, 2010, Leach formally filed suit against Texas Tech for wrongful termination and other claims. He claimed that school officials not only fired him without cause, but issued defamatory statements in a willful attempt to keep him from being hired elsewhere.Carver, Logan G. Leach lawsuit claims fraud, defamation. Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, January 9, 2010. During a deposition for the case obtained by the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Adam James admitted under oath that he found the closet incident \\"funny.\\" In May 2010, District Judge Bill Sowder dismissed all but one of Leach's claims on the grounds of sovereign immunity, but he allowed Leach's claim for breach of contract to proceed, finding that Texas Tech had waived its immunity on this claim by its conduct. The judge also dismissed Leach's claims against three university administrators.McGowan, Matthew. \\"Sowder: Leach contract suit can advance, throws out other claims against Tech, individual\\". Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, June 1, 2010.\\"Judge: Leach suit can move forward\\", AP at ESPN.com. June 1, 2010. Both parties took steps to appeal the decision, although Leach's attorneys said they would drop their appeal if Texas Tech would do likewise and allow the breach of contract claim to proceed to a jury trial.McGowan, Matthew. \\"Texas Tech taking first step toward appeal in legal battle with Leach\\", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal. July 1, 2010. Early in 2011, Texas 7th Court of Appeals ruled that Texas Tech was immune from Leach's claim of breach of contract but that Leach can claim non-monetary reparations. Leach's attorney Paul Dobrowski announced his intention to appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas. Online publication delayed. In February 2012, The Texas Supreme Court denied Leach's petition for review. After that denial, Texas Tech attorney Dicky Gregg stated \\"As we've said from the beginning, we were right on the law and the facts, and the (Texas) Supreme Court has just held that we were correct on the law.\\" Friday Night Lights series creator Peter Berg has hinted that he has written a movie script for the characters from the TV series that is based on Leach's firing from Texas Tech. On August 6, Judge Sowder issued a summary judgement dismissing Leach's lawsuits against ESPN, Spaeth Communications, and Craig James. Leach's attorneys indicated they would appeal. =Post-Texas Tech= In August 2010, Leach joined CBS College Sports Network, where he worked as a color analyst with play-by-play announcer Roger Twibell. In 2010, Leach joined host Jack Arute to co-host \\"College Football Playbook\\" on SiriusXM College Sports Nation Channel 91, which airs weekdays 12 pm – 3 pm ET.

Leach was considered by many in the national media to be a candidate for the head coaching vacancies at University of Miami, University of Maryland, and University of Minnesota following the 2010 regular season. After at least two interviews at Maryland, he was considered the frontrunner for that job until the administration decided instead to hire Randy Edsall away from UConn. Leach was mentioned in connection with a number of other vacancies in head-coaching positions during 2011, including Washington State, Arizona, Ole Miss, Kansas, Penn State, and Tulane. =Washington State= Leach agreed to terms with Washington State on November 30, 2011 and began coaching for the 2012 season. His five-year rollover contract made Leach the fourth-highest paid coach in the Pac-12. On December 5, 2019, Leach received a contract extension through 2024. 2012 season Leach's first season in Pullman was a controversial one. Washington State was 3–9 overall and 1–8 in Pac-12 play; the lone wins were against FCS Eastern Washington, UNLV, and an upset of rival Washington in the Apple Cup in Pullman. On November 10, more allegations of player abuse erupted when star wide receiver Marquess Wilson quit the team citing \\"physical, emotional and verbal abuse\\" by the coaching staff. Immediately after the allegations were made, university president Elson Floyd issued a statement indicating that he had requested investigations into the alleged incident(s) from both the WSU Athletic Department and the Pac-12 Conference. The investigations determined that the claims made against Leach were without merit, and Wilson later recanted the allegations. Leach received a 2-year contract extension on November 18, 2013 after leading the Washington State Cougars to their best record since 2006. 2013 season Leach led WSU to a 6–6 regular season in 2013 that had them bowl eligible for the first time in a decade. They were led on offense by Connor Halliday, who set school and conference records for passing. The Cougars defeated USC, California, Arizona, and Utah for a conference record. Invited to the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque, Wazzu led most of the game, but lost to the Colorado State Rams. Down by sixteen points with under three minutes to play, the Rams mounted an all-time great comeback, winning with a field goal as time expired in regulation. The Cougars led the nation in passing offense and total offense and Leach was awarded a pay raise for the Cougars' 2013 performance. 2014 season The 2014 season saw the Cougars regress to a record. The Cougars defeated Portland State Utah and Oregon State 2015 season In 2015, despite a season-opening loss to FCS school Portland State, the Cougars had their breakthrough season of the Leach era with a record, in the Pac-12. The Cougars were invited to the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, where they beat the Miami Hurricanes This was the best Cougar record since the 2003 team went 2016 season WSU began the 2016 season with two losses, but rallied off eight consecutive wins before dropping their final two games. The success of their season, led by Luke Falk at quarterback, landed them in the Holiday Bowl in San Diego where they lost to Minnesota of the Big Ten. WSU finished in the Pac-12, with notable wins over Oregon and #15 Stanford. It was the Cougars' best conference finish in thirteen seasons, but the bowl loss gave WSU an overall record of 2017 season Washington State was in the Pac-12 in 2017. They were again invited to the Holiday Bowl where they lost to Michigan State and finished overall. 2018 season Leach recruited graduate transfer Gardner Minshew at quarterback in time for the 2018 season and it paid big dividends. The Cougars won a school record- tying ten games, the first time they had won that many in the regular season since the Rose Bowl year of 2002. They also surged as high as seventh in major polling and went into the Apple Cup with a chance to clinch the Pac-12 North title and a shot at the Rose Bowl, but lost 28–15 to rival Washington in the snow in Pullman, a sixth consecutive loss to the Huskies. The Cougars were invited to the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio to play the Iowa State Cyclones of They won 28–26 for a school record 11th win. =Mississippi State= 2020 On January 9, 2020, Leach agreed to be the head coach of the Mississippi State Bulldogs.

Leach is atypical among NCAA Division I head coaches in that he did not play college football. He is one of nine such current head coaches, eight of them in FBS. The others are Manny Diaz of the Miami Hurricanes, Eliah Drinkwitz at Missouri, David Cutcliffe at Duke, Sonny Dykes at SMU, Ryan Silverfield at Memphis, Bill Clark at UAB, Hugh Freeze at Liberty, and the only FCS coach of the group, Bobby Hauck at Montana. Famous among fans for his fascination with 18th-century pirates such as Blackbeard and Calico Jack, Leach has lectured his players on the history of pirates, and told them before games to \\"swing their swords.\\" His office has been described as a museum of pirate paraphernalia. In particular, Leach admires the teamwork exhibited by pirates. Leach's affinity for pirates came to bear in a cameo he made on the TV series Friday Night Lights. In the show's fourth season, he portrays a \\"random loon\\" at a gas station who implores a despondent coach Eric Taylor to \\"swing your sword\\" and \\"find your inner pirate.\\" Leach spends time during each off-season pursuing non-sport interests. Besides pirates, he has studied topics such as Native American leader Geronimo, American pioneer Daniel Boone, grizzly bears, chimpanzees, whales, and American artist Jackson Pollock. During the spring of 2019, Leach co-taught a five-week seminar at Washington State, \\"Insurgent Warfare and Football Strategies,\\" alongside Washington politician Michael Baumgartner. Leach's social media presence has come under widespread criticism. In 2018, the posting of fake videos critical of President Barack Obama led to multiple Washington State donors to alter future giving plans. The 2020 posting of a meme featuring a noose led to player criticism and transfers.

These infamous Hawaiian spots, located on the North Shore of Oahu, receive large swells and waves break in very shallow water. Botha displays great tranquility even in the face of very dangerous wave conditions, and has developed his unique, clean style of bodyboarding. He is also the survivor of one of the most spectacular wipeouts ever witnessed by the surfing community at the infamous Teahupoo (one of the heaviest and most feared waves in the world) in the Tahiti Skins 2000 event.

Tsatsouline is particularly notable for popularizing the kettlebell in the modern era in the West, most notably through his books and through a series of instructional videos, delivered with his trademark comedic intent, comically exploiting Russian stereotypes with a thick accent, a dungeon-esque setting, and frequent use of the word \\"comrade\\".

The film stars Marlon Brando, Yul Brynner, Martin Benrath, Janet Margolin, Trevor Howard and Wally Cox. It was directed by Bernhard Wicki. The filming occurred almost exclusively on an old German freighter. Plot Robert Crain (Marlon Brando) is a German pacifist during World War II, living in India as a Swiss national. He is blackmailed by English Colonel Statter (Trevor Howard) and the Allies into going along with a plan to use his engineering knowledge to disable the scuttling charges on a German merchant ship carrying rubber from Japan. The Allies hope to bomb the ship and recover its cargo, as rubber is in short supply and essential for both sides' war effort. They provide Crain with fake documentation and a cover story that he is a high-ranking SS officer needing to sail to Germany. On board the ship, Crain finds the captain (Yul Brynner) to be a patriotic German whose humanistic inclinations are hostile to Nazi principles. The first officer, Kruse (Martin Benrath), is a fanatical Party member who keeps a close eye on the captain. Crain convinces Kruse that he too is suspicious of the captain's loyalties. Several of the crew are in effect prisoners because of their political views, however they are pressed into service because of labor shortages. In time, after one of them tries to kill him, Crain enlists them in a plan to have the Allies take the ship. Complications arise when a number of American prisoners and two German Naval officers are taken on board from a Japanese submarine. Also brought aboard is Esther (Janet Margolin), a young German Jew who has been raped and tortured by her Nazi captors. Despite the horrors she has been subjected to, she is still openly defiant of every German she encounters on board the ship, including the captain and Crain. The captain, when he is alone with her and is able to overcome her expectation that he too is a brutalizer, tells her he plans to assist her to escape once the ship gets to Europe. However, when Kruse learns that she is Jewish that is no longer a possibility. Later Crain persuades her to join in his plot, but she is disgusted by his lack of commitment to the anti-Nazi cause. The two German officers, who are familiar with military personnel and operations in the Far East, become suspicious of Crain and radio to Berlin to check on his credentials. That gives him less than 24 hours to complete the mission. While awaiting the report, the captain, upon hearing that his son has become an accomplished Nazi military officer, in a drunken rage reveals the full extent of his anti-Nazi beliefs. This gives Kruse a reason to take command of the ship. About to be exposed, Crain organizes a mutiny. For it to have any chance of success the American prisoners would need to participate, but when Esther appeals to them for help they only agree on condition that she is sexually compliant with them. The mutiny is easily defeated, and Kruse shoots Esther for her part in it. Crain is able to elude the search for him long enough to detonate the demolition charges he had not yet disabled. The surviving crew abandons ship, during which the anti-Nazi German sailors make sure the wounded Kruse drowns. Crain and the captain are the only persons left on board. The lard in the ship's hold spills and acts as a stopper, temporarily keeping the ship afloat. Crain asks the captain to radio the Allies for rescue, and is surprised when the captain does so.

Brandt Reception The film did not do well on its original release and was a financial disaster. In an attempt to increase its commercial appeal, the film was reissued in 1965 under a new title as Saboteur: Code Name Morituri. Critic Bosley Crowther of the New York Times criticized it for being \\"turgid.\\" He praised Brando's performance, however, saying: The title \\"Morituri\\", the plural of a Latin word meaning \\"about to die,\\" is a reference to a phrase used by Suetonius, Ave Imperator, morituri te salutant. (Hail Emperor, they who are about to die salute you.) Critic reviews of the time have not been collated on Rotten Tomatoes, but the film has a 71% approval rating by audience viewers. =Box office= According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $10,500,000 in rentals to break even and made $4,045,000. Awards The film was nominated for two Oscars in the 38th Academy Awards (1966) for best black-and-white cinematography (Conrad L. Hall) and best black-and-white costume design (Moss Mabry). Meet Marlon Brando After having appeared in a series of box office disappointments, Brando agreed to promote Morituri for the studio by participating in a day- long press junket at the Hampshire Hotel in New York City.Meet Marlon Brando (1965) - Fandor. This event was the subject of Meet Marlon Brando (1966), a 29-minute black-and-white documentary film directed by Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin.Meet Marlon Brando - Maysles Films, Inc. Brando was praised for his performance in the documentary by critic Howard Thompson who wrote, \\"The actor was never more appealing than in this candid-camera cameo, his best performance.\\" The documentary premiered at the New York Film Festival in 1966. Since then, it has aired on French television but was not shown in its entirety in the United States until Fandor made it available on November 15, 2013.Bernstein, Paula. \\"Exclusive Clip from 'Meet Marlon Brando,' Maysles Brothers Doc, Available for the First Time\\", Indiewire, 14 November 2013 References  External links   1965 films 1965 drama films 20th Century Fox films American black-and-white films American films English-language films Films based on German novels Films scored by Jerry Goldsmith Seafaring films World War II films World War II spy films American war drama films ","title":"Morituri (1965 film)"},{"id":"2967227","text":"Tissue factor, also called platelet tissue factor, factor III, or CD142, is a protein encoded by the F3 gene, present in subendothelial tissue and leukocytes. Its role in the clotting process is the initiation of thrombin formation from the zymogen prothrombin. Thromboplastin defines the cascade that leads to the activation of factor X—the tissue factor pathway. In doing so, it has replaced the previously named extrinsic pathway in order to eliminate ambiguity.  Function  The F3 gene encodes coagulation factor III, which is a cell surface glycoprotein. This factor enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII. The resulting complex provides a catalytic event that is responsible for initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis. Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces. There are three distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. This protein is the only one in the coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described. In addition to the membrane-bound tissue factor, soluble form of tissue factor was also found which results from alternatively spliced tissue factor mRNA transcripts, in which exon 5 is absent and exon 4 is spliced directly to exon 6. = Coagulation = The coagulation cascade. TF is the cell surface receptor for the serine protease factor VIIa. The best known function of tissue factor is its role in blood coagulation. The complex of TF with factor VIIa catalyzes the conversion of the inactive protease factor X into the active protease factor Xa. Together with factor VIIa, tissue factor forms the tissue factor or extrinsic pathway of coagulation. This is opposed to the intrinsic (amplification) pathway, which involves both activated factor IX and factor VIII. Both pathways lead to the activation of factor X (the common pathway), which combines with activated factor V in the presence of calcium and phospholipid to produce thrombin (thromboplastin activity). = Cytokine signaling = TF is related to a protein family known as the cytokine receptor class II family. The members of this receptor family are activated by cytokines. Cytokines are small proteins that can influence the behavior of white blood cells. Binding of VIIa to TF has also been found to start signaling processes inside the cell. The signaling function of TF/VIIa plays a role in angiogenesis and apoptosis. Pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic responses are activated by TF/VIIa mediated-cleavage by the protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). EphB2 and EphA2 of the Eph tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) family can also be cleaved by TF/VIIa.  Structure  Tissue factor belongs to the cytokine receptor protein superfamily and consists of three domains: # an extracellular domain, which consists of two fibronectin type III modules whose hydrophobic cores merge in the domain-domain interface. This serves as a (probably rigid) template for factor VIIa binding. # a transmembrane domain. # a cytosolic domain of 21 amino acids length inside the cell which is involved in the signaling function of TF. Note that one of factor VIIa's domains, GLA domain, binds in the presence of calcium to negatively charged phospholipids, and this binding greatly enhances factor VIIa binding to tissue factor.  Tissue distribution  Some cells release TF in response to blood vessel damage (see next paragraph) and some do only in response to inflammatory mediators (endothelial cells/macrophages). TF is expressed by cells which are normally not exposed to flowing blood, such as sub-endothelial cells (e.g. smooth muscle cells) and cells surrounding blood vessels (e.g. fibroblasts). This can change when the blood vessel is damaged by, for example, physical injury or rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Exposure of TF-expressing cells during injury allows the complex formation of TF with factor VII. Factor VII and TF form an equimolar complex in the presence of calcium ions, leading to the activation of factor VII on a membrane surface. The inner surface of the blood vessel consists of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells do not express TF except when they are exposed to inflammatory molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Another cell type that expresses TF on the cell surface in inflammatory conditions is the monocyte (a white blood cell).  Thromboplastin  Historically, thromboplastin was a lab reagent, usually derived from placental sources, used to assay prothrombin times (PT time). Thromboplastin, by itself, could activate the extrinsic coagulation pathway. When manipulated in the laboratory, a derivative could be created called partial thromboplastin, which was used to measure the intrinsic pathway. This test is called the aPTT, or activated partial thromboplastin time. It was not until much later that the subcomponents of thromboplastin and partial thromboplastin were identified. Thromboplastin contains phospholipids as well as tissue factor, both of which are needed in the activation of the extrinsic pathway, whereas partial thromboplastin does not contain tissue factor. Tissue factor is not needed to activate the intrinsic pathway.  Interactions  Tissue factor has been shown to interact with Factor VII.

To search for the hypokeimenon is to search for that substance that persists in a thing going through change—its basic essence. Overview According to Aristotle's definition,Aristotle, Categories, 1a20. hypokeimenon is something which can be predicated by other things, but cannot be a predicate of others. The existence of a material substratum was posited by John Locke, with conceptual similarities to Baruch Spinoza's substance and Immanuel Kant's concept of the noumenon (in The Critique of Pure Reason). Locke theorised that when all sensible properties were abstracted away from an object, such as its colour, weight, density or taste, there would still be something left to which the properties had adhered—something which allowed the object to exist independently of the sensible properties that it manifested in the beholder. Locke saw this ontological ingredient as necessary if one is to be able to consider objects as existing independently of one's own mind. The material substratum proved a difficult idea for Locke as by its very nature its existence could not be directly proven in the manner endorsed by empiricists (i.e., proof by exhibition in experience).Loeb, L. E., Reflection and the Stability of Belief: Essays on Descartes, Hume, and Reid (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 166. Nevertheless, he believed that the philosophical reasons for it were strong enough for its existence to be considered proved. The existence of the substratum was denied by Berkeley. In his Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous, Berkeley maintained that an object consists of nothing more than those sensible properties (or possible sensible properties) that the object manifests, and that those sensible properties only exist so long as the act of perceiving them does.

Fury and his Howling Commandos, and, in the following era, for the series The Monster of Frankenstein and for co-creating the supernatural motorcyclist the Ghost Rider and the supernatural hero the Son of Satan. Friedrich – no relation to fellow comics writer Mike Friedrich – was the first successful new writer brought into the burgeoning 1960s Marvel after fellow Missourian Roy Thomas. Succeeding Thomas on Sgt. Fury, Friedrich and the art team of Dick Ayers and John Severin produced a World War II series for the Vietnam years, combining militaristic camaraderie and gung ho humor with a regretful sense of war as a terrible last resort. The humanistic military drama was noted for its semi-anthological \\"The\\" stories, such as \\"The Medic\\" and \\"The Deserter\\". Friedrich went on to write a smattering of superhero stories for Marvel, Atlas/Seaboard Comics and Topps Comics, and eventually left the comics industry. In 2011, he lost a federal lawsuit over a claim of ownership in the character Ghost Rider, but in July 2014, three months after an appellate court reversed that decision, the parties said they had reached a settlement. Early life Gary Friedrich was born on August 21, 1943, the son of Jerry and Elsie Friedrich. He was born and raised in Jackson, Missouri, where he graduated from Jackson High School in 1961. He was editor of the high school newspaper and a member of the marching band. As a teen, he was a friend of future Marvel Comics writer and eventual editor-in-chief Roy Thomas. Friedrich worked at a record store in Cape Girardeau, Missouri after high school, and in February 1964, obtained a job at Jackson's two weekly newspapers, which were being combined into a single twice-weekly. \\"I was working about 80 hours a week for $50\\", he recalled in 2001.Gary Friedrich interview, Comic Book Artist #13 (May 2001), p. 75 \\"I wrote, edited, and laid out the entire newspaper. I was the whole editorial staff without any help. It was driving me crazy\\". Friedrich had gotten married the year before and by now had a young son, but, \\"I didn't have time for anything because I was working all the damn time.\\" The marriage fell apart, \\"and even that wasn't a major problem for a while because I was so damn busy and I was either working, drunk, or both\\", Friedrich said,Friedrich, Comic Book Artist, p. 76 alluding to the alcoholism from which he began recovering on \\"New Year's night in 1979\\".Friedrich, Comic Book Artist, p. 78 When the newspaper ceased publication in late summer 1965, Friedrich began working a union job at a Cape Girardeau factory, installing heating elements in waffle irons. Roy Thomas, now a Marvel Comics staff writer in New York City, called his friend with the suggestion that freelance work might exist in the newly resurgent medium. Friedrich took a Greyhound bus the following day, and stayed with Thomas and a fandom friend, Dave Kaler, in Manhattan's East Village. Shortly afterward, Friedrich and Thomas took an apartment on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village. This was a time of transition between the beat movement and the hippie era, when the Village flourished as a creative mecca. \\"The Village was a really neat place to be at that time. We went to the theater that was to become the Fillmore East; it wasn't called that yet, but they were starting to have some rock concerts, like Chuck Berry. ... I began to let my hair grow and become a real New York hippie\\",Friedrich, Comic Book Artist, p. 77 he recalled. Comics career After Thomas recommended Friedrich to Charlton Comics editor Dick Giordano, Friedrich began writing romance comics for that low-budget publisher, where many pros got early breaks. \\"I did it with a great good sense of humor\\", Friedrich recalled. \\"I wrote things like 'Tears in My Malted' and 'Too Fat to Frug'....\\" With anonymous help and input from Thomas, Friedrich also began writing superhero stories, beginning with his backup feature \\"The Sentinels\\" (with penciler-inker Sam Grainger) in Peter Cannon ... Thunderbolt #54 (Oct. 1966). He wrote the feature for two more issues before handing it off. Friedrich also dialogued the debut and the next three stories of the Blue Beetle, plotted and drawn by Steve Ditko, in Captain Atom #83–86 (Nov. 1966 – June 1967). Friedrich's last recorded Charlton story was \\"If I Had Three Wishes\\", penciled by Ditko, in Ghostly Tales #60 (March 1967). =Marvel Comics= By this time Friedrich had already begun writing Westerns for Marvel, including issues of Kid Colt, Outlaw; Two-Gun Kid; Rawhide Kid; and his first regular series, the Western Ghost Rider – launched with debut-issue co-plotter Thomas, and running six issues, mostly co-scripted by Friedrich and series penciler Dick Ayers. Friedrich also contributed to the parody series Not Brand Echh. He began on Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos with #42 (May 1967) – co-scripted, as was the next issue, by Friedrich's Western partner, Sgt. Fury penciler Ayers. The next issue, a flashback to the Howlers' first mission, was co-scripted by Friedrich and Thomas. Following this inauspicious beginning came the first of several Friedrich \\"The\\" stories, \\"The War Lover\\" (#45, Aug. 1967) – a shaded exploration of a trigger-happy soldier and the line drawn, even in war, between killing and murder. Daring for the time, when majority public sentiment still supported the undeclared Vietnam War, the story balanced present-day issues while demonstrating that even in what is referred to as \\"a just war\\", a larger morality prevails. His story for issue #72 (Nov. 1969) was heavily rewritten and partially redrawn due to concerns about possible copyright infringement of the film Casablanca. Friedrich continued through #83 (Jan. 1971), with the late part of this run having reprint issues between new stories, and again for the even-numbered issues from #94–114 (Jan. 1972 – Nov. 1973). Issue #100 (July 1972) featured a present-day, fictional reunion gala. Friedrich also launched the 19-issue World War II United States Marines series Capt. Savage and his Leatherneck Raiders (Jan. 1968 – March 1970; changed to Captain Savage and his Battlefield Raiders with #9); and the nine-issue World War II U.S. Army series Combat Kelly and the Deadly Dozen ( June 1972 – Sept. 1973). Friedrich settled into the niche of utility writer. His first regular superhero series for Marvel was The Incredible Hulk vol. 2, for which he wrote a handful of issues starting with #102 (April 1968; the premiere issue, following the Hulk feature in the \\"split book\\" Tales to Astonish), as well as the 1968 annual The Incredible Hulk Special #1. The series would not, however, launch him as Thomas' natural successor on Marvel's flagship titles, which went to such later hires as Gerry Conway, Steve Englehart, Len Wein and Marv Wolfman. Friedrich mostly would be assigned titles in transition or facing cancellation, including, variously, [Uncanny] X-Men; Captain America; Captain Marvel; Daredevil; Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.; and the \\"Black Widow\\" feature in Amazing Adventures.Sanderson, Peter \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 146: \\"Gary Friedrich and artist John Buscema teamed up for the adventures of the Black Widow, the former Russian spy turned American superhero.\\" He was also given many non- superhero features, including such Westerns as The Gunhawks and co-created the Phantom Eagle with Herb Trimpe.DeFalco \\"1960s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 131: \\"Aviation buff Herb Trimpe, who flew his own biplane for many years, teamed up with writer Gary Friedrich to create flying ace the Phantom Eagle.\\" Friedrich was the co-creator and initial writer of Marvel's motorcycle-demon Ghost Rider,Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 156: \\"Co-created by editor Roy Thomas, writer Gary Friedrich, and artist Mike Ploog, the new Ghost Rider was Johnny Blaze, a motorcycle stunt performer.\\" and later teamed with that character's first artist, Mike Ploog, on Marvel's Monster of Frankenstein – the first five issues of which (Jan.-Oct. 1973) contained a relatively faithful adaptation of Mary Shelley's novel.Sanderson \\"1970s\\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 158: \\"[The Monster of Frankenstein] began with a faithful comics adaptation of Mary Shelley's original novel, by writer Gary Friedrich and artist Mike Ploog.\\" As one critic wrote of issue #4: \\"Unmatched by anything else he'd written at Marvel, Friedrich's script ... had reached a point that perfectly captured the 19th-century cadences of Shelley's prose and lifted the strip far above any past or, so far, future attempt to adapt the character to comics.\\" Friedrich co-created the supernatural hero the Son of Satan in Ghost Rider vol. 2, #1 (Sept. 1973). Friedrich recalled in 2009 that Marvel editor- in-chief Stan Lee \\"had some idea that he wanted a character called Son of Satan. I have no idea why or where it came from. All he really had was the name and he wanted us to create a character based around that. I guess it just popped in his mind. He said \\"I want a title called Son of Satan. Do it!\\" In the mid-1970s, he also wrote the majority of the seven-page Captain Britain stories in the character's namesake Marvel UK weekly comic book following the departure of original writer Chris Claremont. =Other work= Friedrich's work for other publishers includes writing for the Skywald line of black-and- white horror-comics magazines. For that company he created Hell-Rider – a Vietnam-vet vigilante motorcyclist with a flame-thrower-equipped bike – in a namesake two-issue series (July–Aug. to Sept.-Oct. 1971). Additional . The following year, Friedrich worked with Thomas on the similarly motorcycle- mounted Ghost Rider. Additionally, Friedrich freelanced for the short-lived Atlas/Seaboard Comics, where he wrote the crime comic Police Action #2-3 (April and June 1975) and the feature \\"Son of Dracula\\" in Fright #1 (June 1975), and scripted the sole story of the character Man-Monster, co-plotted by Tony Isabella and penciller Rich Buckler, in Tales of Evil #3 (July 1975). He also wrote the second and final issue of The Cougar, the third and final issue of Morlock 2001, with the rare art team of Steve Ditko and Bernie Wrightson; the third and final issue of The Brute; and the fourth and final issue of IronJaw (all July 1975). = Later Career = Friedrich left comics in 1978 and returned to Missouri, where he eventually spent many years as a driver/courier in the St. Louis area.Len Brown in In 1993, Friedrich scripted Topps Comics' Jack Kirby-created Bombast #1 (April 1993), where he teamed once more with plotter Roy Thomas and Sgt. Fury artists Dick Ayers and John Severin. = Ownership contention = In the 2000s, Friedrich expressed public disagreement about the genesis of the supernatural Ghost Rider. In 2001, Roy Thomas claimed that: Friedrich responded: Ploog recalled, in a 2008 interview: On April 4, 2007, Friedrich filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois against Marvel Enterprises, Sony Pictures, Columbia TriStar Motion Pictures, Relativity Media, Crystal Sky Pictures, Michael DeLuca Productions, Hasbro and Take-Two Interactive, alleging his copyrights to the Ghost Rider character have been exploited and utilized in a \\"joint venture and conspiracy\\". The lawsuit states that the film rights and merchandising reverted from Marvel to him in 2001. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on February 14, 2008, and Friedrich amended the complaint on March 25, 2011. The suit concluded on December 28, 2011, with Marvel prevailing on all but one count. U.S. District Judge Katherine B. Forrest ruled that Marvel Entertainment owned the character, saying Friedrich gave up any ownership claim when he signed checks containing language relinquishing all rights. She said Friedrich had also signed a 1978 agreement with Marvel relinquishing rights. Marvel countersued with the parties reaching a settlement in which Marvel dropped the suit in exchange for Friedrich paying $17,000 in damages, ceasing to sell Ghost Rider-related items of his own creation and ceasing to promote himself as the creator of the character for financial gain. Friedrich was allowed to sell his autograph on officially licensed Ghost Rider merchandise. On June 11, 2013, Second Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Denny Chin overturned the original decision, calling the contract language \\"ambiguous\\" and sending the case back to trial. set for November. On September 6, Friedrich's attorney told the court both parties \\"have amicably agreed to resolve all claims.\\" Personal life As of 2009, Friedrich lived in Jefferson County, Missouri with wife Jean and daughter, Leslie. He died on August 29, 2018 in St. Louis, Missouri. He had been suffering from Parkinson's disease and near-total hearing loss. Awards * Sgt.

Arturo Rosenblueth Stearns (October 2, 1900 – September 20, 1970) was a Mexican researcher, physician and physiologist, who is known as one of the pioneers of cybernetics.  Biography Rosenblueth was born in 1900 in Ciudad Guerrero, Chihuahua. He began his studies in Mexico City, then traveled to Berlin and Paris where he obtained his medical degree. Returning to Mexico City in 1927, he engaged in teaching and research in physiology. In 1930 he obtained a Guggenheim Scholarship and moved to Harvard University, to the department of Physiology, then directed by Walter Cannon. With Cannon he explored the chemical mediation of homeostasis. Rosenblueth cowrote research papers with both Cannon and Norbert Wiener, pioneer of cybernetics. Rosenblueth was an influential member of the core group at the Macy Conferences.http://www.asc-cybernetics.org/foundations/history2.htm In 1944, Rosenblueth became professor of physiology at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. Eventually he became head of the Physiology Laboratory of the National Institute of Cardiology, head of the Physiology Department and, in 1961, director of the Center for Scientific Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) at the National Polytechnic Institute. Between 1947 and 1949, and again between 1951 and 1952, using grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, he returned to Harvard to further collaborate with Wiener. Arturo Rosenblueth died on September 20, 1970, in Mexico City.  Work  Since the 1930s Rosenblueth worked with Cannon on issues related with Chemical transmission among nervous elements. Between 1931 and 1945 he worked with several specialists, among them Cannon, del Pozo, H.G. Schwartz, and Norbert Wiener. With Wiener and Julian Bigelow he wrote \\"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\\", which, according to Wiener himself, set the bases for the new science of Cybernetics. In his 1943 cybernetic classification \\"Behavior, Purpose and Teleology\\", purpose is a behavior subclass. Behavior is active or passive and active behavior is purposeful or random. Active purposeful behavior is then either feedback teleological on non-teleological. Negative feedback is important to guide the positive goal route. Purposeful teleological feedback helps guide the predictive behavior orders. Teleology is feedback controlled purpose. Rosenblueth's classification system was criticized and the need for an external observability to the purposeful behavior was established to validate the behavior and goal-attainment. The purpose of observing and observed systems is respectively distinguished by the system's subjective autonomy and objective control. He devoted himself to the fields of nervous impulse transmissions, neuromuscular transmission, synaptic transmission, the propagation of impulses in the heart, the control of blood circulation, and the physiology of brain cortex. However, he also taught several courses of mathematics and even musicology. =Quotes= * \\"[T]he best material model for a cat is another [cat], or preferably the same cat.\\" \\\\- \\"The Role of Models in Science,\\" with Norbert Wiener * \\"The price of metaphor is eternal vigilance.\\" \\\\- \\"The Role of Models in Science,\\" with Norbert Wiener  Publications  * 1937, Arturo Rosenblueth, Fisiología del sistema nervioso autónomo (\\"Physiology of the Autonomous Nervous System\\"), with Walter Cannon * 1943, Behavior, Purpose and Teleology, with Norbert Wiener, Julian Bigelow * 1945, The Role of Models in Science, with Norbert Wiener * 1970, Mind and Brain: A Philosophy of Science, (MIT Press) * 1970, \\"Mente y Cerebro: una filosofía de la ciencia\\"  References  Further reading * A.M.

It is a potent stimulant of cAMP production, which leads to activation of protein kinase A. PKA functions to phosphorylate certain proteins, affecting their activity. The drug betazole is an example of a histamine H2 receptor agonist.  Function  Histamine is a ubiquitous messenger molecule released from mast cells, enterochromaffin-like cells, and neurons. Its various actions are mediated by histamine receptors H1, H2, H3 and H4. The histamine receptor H2 belongs to the rhodopsin-like family of G protein-coupled receptors. It is an integral membrane protein and stimulates gastric acid secretion. It also regulates gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion and is thought to be involved in regulating cell growth and differentiation.

Founded by (1923–2003) and Friedrich Becker (1900–1990), the observatory was operated by the Argelander Institute for Astronomy of the University of Bonn until it was closed in 2012.  Description  Until the 1940s, Bonn astronomical observations were carried out mainly from Argelander's old observatory in Bonn itself. With more and more electrical lights in the city, the night sky in town became increasingly brighter, making observations difficult. In search for an alternative location, in 1950, the hill of Hoher List above the village of Schalkenmehren was found to be well suited for astronomical observation. The rural surrounds meant very low sky brightness. It was decided to relocate the Bonn telescopes. The new observatory was inaugurated in 1954, after the 50 cm Schmidt telescope had been installed in the first dome. A major extension in 1964 included the relocation of the Double Refractor, which dates from 1899. The final dome to be erected contains a 1 m Cassegrain telescope, the largest and most modern of the observatory's telescopes. Today, there are six telescopes at the observatory. The Double Refractor aside, there is also the 16 cm Schröder Refractor, which was used for the Cordoba Durchmusterung (the southern extension of the Bonner Durchmusterung). 1 metre telescope The observatory was an outstation of the Argelander Institute for Astronomy of the University of Bonn. Many students have obtained their diploma or doctorate, and important scientific work in astrometry and photometry of stars of the Milky Way was carried out. Until its closure in 2012, the Hoher List Observatory lost its scientific significance, as observations from the Eifel have become more difficult. The sky brightness is much increased, and the weather conditions are no match for observatories in Chile or the United States. The Hoher List Observatory delivered the practical parts of student education and provided a laboratory environment to develop astronomical instruments and parts, which may then be deployed on telescopes in, e.g., Spain or Chile. Since 2007, the 1 m telescope was once more used for current research for the HOLIGRAIL (Hoher List Gravitational Lensing) project. In 2012, the University of Bonn closed the observatory and no scientific activities are done anymore. The observatory was put under national historic place conservation. The Förderverein Hoher List, which was formed to support and preserve the Hoher List Observatory, offers guided tours of the observatory, as well as monthly public lectures about astronomy.

(established in 1864) is a United States 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that encourages all girls to be \\"Strong, Smart, and Bold\\" through direct service and advocacy. The organization equips girls with the skills to navigate through economic, gender, and social barriers and to grow up as independent individuals. It is one of the longest continuously operating organizations offering girls-only programming.  History  The Girls Inc. (Girls Club of America) movement started in New England (Waterbury, Connecticut) after the Civil War to help young women who had migrated from rural communities in search of job opportunities. It was founded in 1864 to help and support girls and young women who were experiencing upheaval in the aftermath of the Civil War. In 1945, fourteen charter Girls Clubs joined together to form a national organization. In 1990 the Girls Club of America changed their name to Girls Incorporated. Across the decades, they adapted to meet specific environmental challenges girls and young women faced, working in partnership with schools and communities. Founders and creator There were many people who helped and contributed to the start of Girls Inc, but the most recognized person is Rachel Harris Johnson. In 1919, she became secretary of the Worcester Girls Club, which her mother helped found. She later became the club's president and in 1945 formed a national organization and served as its first president until 1952. Johnson died at the age of 95 in a nursing home. Local affiliates The first girls club opened in 1864 and has been nationally recognized since 1945. Girls Inc. has a network of local organizations in the United States and Canada. Affiliates can be found across the United States and Canada. Girls Inc. recently expanded to Chicago, launching a Girls Inc. of Chicago local organization. Governance Girls, Inc. is governed by a dual governance structure, which is made up of the National Council and the National Board. The president and CEO of Girls, Inc. is Stephanie Hull, Prior to joining Girls, Inc., she had been Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation. She succeeded Judy Vredenburgh, who had been at Girls, Inc. since 2010. The National Council generally makes decisions concerning the purpose, goals, and public policies of the organization. Generally there are almost 300 voting members, but rarely do even most of them come to the meeting. They also elect the National Board, the officers of the Council and the Board Development Committee. They also vote to amend the bylaws of the organization, which requires a two-thirds majority. The council meets every two years and at least 75 delegates must be present for the meeting to be called to order 45 days before each council meeting, the agenda and items to be voted upon are sent out. The National Board must have at least twenty members but no more than forty. The board includes five officers, eight regional representatives, and up to 27 at-large board members. The President/CEO is a voting member on the board. It meets four times a year with the spring meeting being the annual meeting. Eleven members in attendance constitute a quorum. The board acts like the executive committee of a corporation.  Notable supporters  In September 2006, Warren Buffett auctioned his Lincoln Town Car to support Girls Inc. The vehicle sold for $73,200 on eBay. In 2015, Warren Buffett auctioned his Cadillac to support Girls Inc., which sold for $122,500.00 on Proxibid.com. In March 2017, Hillary Clinton was named as the \\"Champion for Girls\\" by Girls Inc. at their 2017 New York Luncheon. In February 2013 the DPR Foundation gave the Girls Inc. of Orange County a $30,000 check. The Girls Inc. organization admired the donation and explained how much of an impact it would make for further purchases. Partner companies Girls Inc. join in efforts with partner companies that help create positive change for women. The companies do this through selling jewelry to raise money or simply giving donations. Some of Girls Inc.’s partner companies include Dove, Cummins, Freeform, Business Wire, Motorola Foundation, American Chemical Society, NPower, Adventures of the Mind, Nonprofit VOTE and Space Science Laboratory. A venture with the American Girl Dolls collection in 2005 generated controversy among fundamentalist Christians. The American Family Association urged its members to demand that American Girl halt support for Girls Inc., accusing it of being \\"a pro-abortion, pro-lesbian advocacy group.\\" Awards and acknowledgements Girls Inc. has received a 4-star rating from Charity Navigator, and a \\"Platinum\\" status from GuideStar. Programs In 1970s, the organization developed a number of programs in six main areas: 1) careers and life planning, 2) health and sexuality, 3) leadership and community action, 4) sports and adventure, 5) self-reliance and life skills, and 6) culture and heritage. As of 2019, it had the following programs: * National Scholars Program - offers scholarships to female high school seniors graduating from affiliate high schools located throughout the U.S. and Canada. * Eureka! Program - combines intensive summer camp experiences in STEM (Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) with school-year seminars, field trips, speakers, and activities. Launched in 2010 and funded by Clinton Foundation, it is supported by several universities and corporations. * Economic Literacy - teaches girls about money management and financial independence. * Friendly PEERsuasion - helps girls ages 11 to 14 acquire knowledge, skills, and support systems to avoid substance use (harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, household chemicals, etc.). * Leadership and Community Action * Media Literacy * Operation SMART * Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy * Project Bold - a violence-prevention and self-defense program. * Bold Futures - after school mentoring program. * Girls Inc.

He was a New Democratic member in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1975 to 1981 and again from 1984 to 1985 who represented the riding of Hamilton Centre. Background Davison was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and attended Hamilton Collegiate Institute. Politics He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1975 provincial election, succeeding his father Norm Davison in Hamilton Centre. He was re-elected over Liberal candidate Sheila Copps by 14 votes in the 1977 election. A recount was ordered which confirmed the win for Davison. In 1981, Davison lost to Copps in a rematch. Davison won a seat on the Hamilton, Ontario City Council in 1982. He returned to the provincial politics when he won a by-election on December 13, 1984 which was held to replace Copps who moved on to Federal politics. He defeated Liberal candidate Lily Munro by 100 votes. Munro requested a recount which confirmed Davison's win by a narrow margin of 55 votes. He never actually returned to sit in the legislature, however, as it was not convened before the writs were dropped five months later. In the 1985 election Davison lost to Oddie in a rematch by 384 votes. He tried to regain a Hamilton council seat again in November 1985, but failed in his attempt. Later life He opened a consulting firm after leaving politics. Davison wrote a column for the Hamilton Spectator newspaper until it was cancelled in 2002. Following his column's cancellation, he became a political commentator for CHCH News. In 2004, Davison was arrested on three counts of criminal harassment and one count of attempting to lure a 16-year-old girl into prostitution. He rejected the terms of his bail agreement in July 2004, and chose to remain in jail during the pre-trial period. A number of Davison's former associates indicated that they had lost touch with him prior to his arrest, and sometimes saw him \\"wandering downtown streets\\" in an aimless manner. Future HWDSB Trustee Bob Barlow, then active in local NDP politics, noted that Davison had gone to Andrea Horwath's by-election headquarters and made a number of strange statements. \\"It was almost like a fantasyland. That's not the Mike I know. I thought that's odd,\\" Barlow told the Hamilton Spectator. Political columnist Eric Dowd wrote that heavy drinking played a significant role in Davison's downfall. Davison eventually pleaded guilty, and was given a conditional discharge and probation. An addiction to alcohol was a contributing factor.

History  Hanover, Jamaica's second smallest parish was founded on 12 November 1723 with Lucea as the capital and main city . From the middle of the 18th century, the farmers of Hanover provided the rest of Jamaica with most of its produce but mainly exported banana, logwood which is used to make dyes Fort Charlotte in Lucea was built in 1761. Alongside the fort is an impressive Georgian brick structure known as The Barracks, which was built in 1843 to provide shelter to the soldiers stationed there.Lucea, Fort Charlotte - Jamaica Travel and Culture .comJamaica National Heritage Trust - Jamaica - Fort CharlotteFort Charlotte (Jamaica, Caribbean): Top Tips Before You Go - TripAdvisor In the early 20th century The Barracks became the educational center for the town and has now been transformed to become part of the Rusea's High School complex. In 1982 Rusea's High School was merged with the Hanover Secondary School and is still known as the Rusea's High School (Fort Charlotte). In January 2019 the school was still open and open-air lessons took place inside the fort. The parish has three small waterfalls, several coves, such as the Davis Cove, named after a prominent Hanover family, along its coastline and large caves. The still fully functional Lucea clock tower was built in 1817 and stands in the town center near the Old Lucea courthouse.Keeling, Allan. The Town of Lucea. Jamaica Archives 1 Nov. 2008 Lucea online Other notable tourist attractions are Lucea's many historical sites that date back as far as the 18th century. Lucea Parish Church (the Parish Church of Hanover) is one of the oldest churches in Jamaica. Although no record of when it was first built exists the first baptism record dates back to 1725, the first burial was in 1727, and the first marriage in 1749. It is said that there is a tunnel that leads from the church to nearby Fort Charlotte, which was a safe haven in time of war. The Hanover Museum sits on the site of a prison dating back to 1776, and houses many historical artifacts significant to Hanover's history.Hanover Parish Information Demographics Lucea has a population of approximately 5,739. People of mostly African descent make up approximately 92% of population, the others being approximately 1% People of mostly European descent, 4% Asian, 2% Latin American, and all others 2%.Hanover Parish Information, 1999 data  Culture  Lucea shares the Jamaican interest in music such as reggae.  Agriculture  A wide variety of vegetables and fruits are grown in the area around Lucea, such as pulses, cereals, and root vegetables. Sugar, cocoa, coffee, bananas, and rum are important exports of Jamaica. In Lucea, there is a need for domestic cultivators and rural farmers to feed the island's people and visitors. Fruits, vegetables, and flowers are also grown for local consumption. One of the staples of Lucea is the breadfruit. A Rural Agricultural Development Authority farming project along with resident farmers have been \\"supplying the hotel sector on a consistent basis\\" and \\"bring vegetables to the tables of its sophisticated guests\\", according to The Jamaican Observer. This linkage between the tourism demands and the up-and-coming agricultural communities provides an economic opportunity for Lucea. Therefore, the local farmers mostly produce vegetables, roots and tubers (sweet potatoes and yams), some fruits and flowers (hibiscus and Bauhinia or Poor Man's Orchid). As a result, this leaves the larger crop of sugar, cocoa and coffee to the industrial plantations of Jamaica. These major agricultural industries can bring in revenues in the millions meanwhile, leaving the smaller cultivators to provide exotic vegetables for the resort chain restaurants and tourism industries. = Lucea Yams = Lucea Yams are a major product of the parish. In the post-emancipation period the formerly enslaved people in the parish began to cultivate the soft, white, delicately- flavoured yam are named for the town. In the 19th and early 20th century yams grown in the parish were exported from the port of Lucea to places like Colón and Cuba which had sizable Jamaican populations because of the thousands who had migrated to work on the Panama Canal and on sugar and banana plantations.  Tourism  Lucea boasts many clubs and parks as well as the historical attractions, and museum. Lucea's most popular dance clubs that attract both tourists and local people are the 300 Club, founded in 1955, Green Dragon, and Border Line. The Tryall Golf, Tennis & Beach Club sits on a property outside Lucea, and is Hanover's most exclusive resort. Lucea lies between two of Jamaica's most prominent resort cities, Negril and Montego Bay, but has yet to capitalize on the thousands of tourists that pass through. Jamaica Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett has said he will announce plans for designating Lucea as a resort destination. Bartlett said: > The designation will give Lucea certain privileges and will also allow for > us to look at the resort's planning development, which other resort towns > are getting and so Lucea will be able to join Negril, Montego Bay, Ocho Rios > as properly planned resort centers. Since that statement Grand Palladium, part of a Spanish hotel firm, has erected a new 1600 unit luxury double resort called the Grand Palladium Jamaica Resort and Spa / Grand Palladium Lady Hamilton.

The Canon FD lens mount was introduced along with the F-1, but the previous Canon FL-mount lenses and older R- series lenses were also compatible with the camera with some limitations. The Canon F-1 was marketed as a competitor to the Nikon F and Nikon F2 single lens reflex cameras by Nikon. The F-1 was Canon's first successful professional-grade SLR system, supporting a huge variety of accessories and interchangeable parts so it could be adapted for different uses and preferences. Their earlier profession Canonflex of 1959 had failed due a premature introduction -- before professional accessories were ready. In 1972 Canon launched a Highspeed model with a fixed pellicle mirror that allowed the user to see the subject at all times. Equipped with a motor drive, the camera was able to shoot up to 9 frames per second—the highest speed of any motor driven camera at the time. Lenses Four Canon F-1 cameras displayed alongside an assortment of FD mount lenses The Canon F-1 uses the Canon FD lens mount, which was introduced alongside the camera. Between 1970 and 1979, a total of 68 different FD mount lens models were produced, ranging from 7.5mm to 800mm in focal length. Most earlier FL and R series lenses are compatible with the F-1, though they must be used in stop-down metering mode. One exception is the FLP 38 mm F2.8, which was designed for the Canon Pellix. This lens' rear element extends further into the camera body than other FL- mount lenses, and would obstruct the moving mirror of the Canon F-1. Canon introduced a number of innovations in the FD lens line, including the first use of an aspherical lens element in a 35mm camera system with the release of the FD 55mm f/1.2 AL in (launched alongside the F-1 in March 1971). Canon's super telephoto FD lenses were also the first to use white-colored housings, which were designed to keep the thermally sensitive fluorite lens elements from expanding or cracking. Canon continues to use white housings for its L-series lenses today, though the modern versions are made with ultra-low dispersion (UD) glass rather than fluorite. Accessories The Canon F-1 has one of the largest set of accessories of any 35mm SLR ever produced. The viewfinder is removable (interchangeable with four other viewfinders); The focusing screen can be changed out with 4 (later 9) types; the mirror can be locked up to allow deep seated lenses or for high magnification work, the back is interchangeable with a data and bulk film back (250 exposures), The bottom plate is removable and there are 4 Motor Drives and / or Power Winders that can be used (one was a special order 9 frames per second high speed motor drive); three different flash couplers allowed a wide variety of flashes; the eyepiece can take threaded diopter adjustment lenses, magnifiers or angle finders; and the lens collection numbers over 50 FD (and a few special purpose) lenses from 7.5 mm fisheye to 1200 mm super telephoto, and includes the world's fastest 300 mm at the time (the 300 mm F2.8L) and the world's fastest 400 mm lens (the New FD 400 mm F2.8L) both of which incorporate special fluorite and ultra low dispersion glass elements for superb optical quality at the widest lens opening. =Viewfinders= Like most professional 35 mm cameras of the 1970s, the F-1 had interchangeable viewfinders. To remove the viewfinder, one depressed the two small buttons at the rear sides of the finder, and slid the finder toward the back of the camera (or depress one button on the bottom of the Speed Finder). The camera shipped with a standard pentaprism finder, called an \\"eye-level finder\\" by Canon. Other finders available included a waist-level finder, Speed Finder, Booster T finder, and Servo EE finder. The waist-level finder was patterned after the design of waist-level finders common on medium format cameras. It had a pop-up hood to shield the focusing screen from stray light, as well as a magnifier to help with critical focusing. The waist-level finder did not allow the metering information to be seen. The Speed Finder had a rotation feature. This had an arrangement of prisms such that it could be swivelled between eye-level and waist-level positions. It also allowed the entire finder image to be viewed from 60 millimeters away and was suggested for use when wearing goggles or anything else that could prevent the user from placing the eyepiece right up to their eye. It allowed full metering. The Booster T Finder and Servo EE Finder were both essentially variations on the standard eye-level finder. The Booster T Finder contained an ultra-sensitive metering cell which could read as low as EV −3.5. Just like the metering range was shifted towards the dark side, this finder also shift the shutter speeds the camera provided towards the long end. Instead of the normal range (1 s – 1/2000 s), the Booster T Finder gave 60 s – 1/60 s. The shutter speed dial on the finder locked on to the camera's normal shutter dial and drove it through a coupling pin for the standard range of 1 s – 1/60 s. The finder also had a trigger button, which went through the finder down to the normal trigger button. When the Booster's shutter speed dial was turned further, towards longer times, the camera's dial stopped at the B(ulb) setting, and the finder kept the trigger button pressed for the duration of the exposure. The mechanics of this connection also resulted in the oddity that there was no 2 s setting, but 4, 3 and 1 seconds. The Servo EE Finder added shutter priority automatic exposure to the F-1. A servo mechanism in the finder drove the aperture lever on the lens, stopping it down to the correct value. This finder used the same coupling pin on the shutter speed dial as the Booster T Finder did, to sync the finder's shutter speed setting with the camera. It required a cord connected battery magazine (8AAs) or the Motor Drive MF and a special power cord. =Motor drives= The originally available Motor Drive was named the \\"Motor Drive Unit\\". It was commonly referred to as the Motor Drive MD – because all of the accessories had MD in their suffix, but that was not the official designation. The Motor Drive Unit originally required a corded battery pack (10 AAs) making it unwieldy for field or sports action use. A later battery pack that direct connected to the unit became available. The unit also contained a built intervalometer for delays up to 1 frame per minute. The maximum speed was 3 frames per second. In 1972 Canon made a special Modification of the F-1 called the \\"High Speed Motor Drive Camera\\". It had a fixed pellicle (semi transparent) mirror, the motor drive motors were a permanent attachment (the camera's wind lever was removed – making it impossible to use without the motor drive). Maximum speed was 9 frame/sec – the fastest available at the time. Its use at the 1972 Olympics in Japan produced fantastic sequential shots that were previously impossible to achieve. In 1973, Canon introduced the Motor Drive MF. The Motor Drive MF had its batteries (10 AAs) in a vertical grip that mounted to the front left (looking from the front). It had a maximum rate of 3.5 frame/sec and was much better suited to action / sports photography, especially when paired with the Speed Finder or Servo EE finder. A special cord allowed the Servo EE finder to draw its power from the Motor drive MF – thus making a much more compact setup than the original Motor Drive unit. The Motor Drive MF did not have a built in intervalometer, but the Interval Timer L (and later the Interval Timer TM-1 (Quartz) could be plugged into the remote control socket as could remote switches and a wireless control unit, the Wireless Controller LC-1. These all allowed either remote and / or unattended use of the camera. Later, Canon introduced the Power Winder F, a 2 frame/ sec power winder with a grip for ease of use. It used 4 AA batteries in the same battery magazine that the Canon A-series Power Winder A used. The Power winder F could use most of the remote switches that also fit the Motor Drive MF. The only two accessories that it could not use were the Interval Timer L and the Remote Switch 60-MF. While not as fast, The Power Winder F was smaller and lighter than the Motor Drive MF. Unlike many other professional- level cameras of the early 1970s, the F-1 required no modification or special custom fitting to attach the motor drives, one simply removed the bottom plate and screwed the motor drive in place. =Backs= The F-1's back was removable. A Data Back F (for the original F-1 and F-1n) or Data Back FN (for the New F-1) (which being mechanical is now incapable of putting the current year on a photo) or a bulk film back that could hold 250 exposures could be attached. The Film Chamber 250 could be used alone or with the Motor Drive Unit or Motor Drive MF (the MF's grip had to be removed and coupled via a dedicated cord). =Eyepiece= The F-1s eyepiece was threaded and could take a metal (later soft rubber covered) ring, an eyecup or several different diopter adjustment lenses. Th Magnifier R and Angle Finders A2 and B could also be attached to allow critical focusing and / or waist-level use (if one did not want to fit either the Speed Finder or Waist Level Finder). =Flash accessories= With a removable viewfinder, the F-1's flash coupler originally attached atop the rewind crank. Initially, there were two flash couplers, D and L. The D model was a simple x-synch coupler that allowed any non-dedicated manual or auto flash to be used. The Flash Coupler L contained two batteries (now hard to find, one being originally a 1.35v mercuric oxide and the other being the uncommon PX-1 size), one which powered a light to light up the metering window visible in the viewfinder, and the other to work with the original Canon Auto tuning system (CATS). The CATS used a special auto flash, the SpeedLite 133D and Flash auto Rings A, B, A2 and B2 and Canon 50 mm and 35 mm Lenses which signalled through the cords the distance of the subject and the charge level of the flash to allow match needle flash photography. Canon announced and produced manuals for a high power handle mounted (\\"pototao masher\\") flash designated SpeedLight 500A. This was also to use the CATS equipment It appears in some Canon publications, and there are user instructions for it, however most people have never actually seen a SpeedLight 500A. For low ambient light photography without flash, Canon provided the Finder Illuminator F which slid over the same flash contacts at the flash couplers. It contained a small battery powered light to light up the metering window. Later, Canon introduced the Flash Coupler F, which fastened over the Eye Level Finder, making the camera look like more like one with a fixed viewfinder and hot shoe. This flash coupler, obviously could not be used with any other viewfinder, and did not have the electronics that the L model had, but it was more compact and the newer A-series flashes which had auto flash capabilities had now superseded the old SpeedLite 133D. The CATS flash equipment was for the later electronic Canon F1 New (1981) and it allowed aperture settings from the camera to be communicated to the flash unit. It was also possible for the flash unit to select an appropriate camera aperture based on its own photo cell exposure reading, provided that the motor drive was also present. The motor drive is necessary for the camera to function in shutter priority. TTL Flash was introduced on the Nikon F3 (1981) which was a direct competitor of the F1 New. For many this was considered as a considerable advantage although the ergonomics of the Nikon F3 with its liquid crystal display lacked the clarity of the Canon F1. =Macro, micro and close- up photography= A comprehensive set of close-up, macro and microphoto accessories was available for the F-1, including three bellows units, reversing rings and couplers, macro and micro photo hoods and couplers, copy stands, manual and automatic extension tubes and 3 different focal length macro lenses. Revisions In 1976, the camera was revised slightly. This revised version is sometimes called the F-1n (not to be confused with the 1981 New F-1). All told 13 improvements were made. These changes were: # Change the standard focusing screen from the A style (microprism only) to E style (split image with microprism ring). # Widen the film advance lever offset from 15 degrees to 30 degrees. # Decrease the winding stroke from 180 degrees to 139 degrees. # Increase the maximum ASA from 2000 to 3200. # Added a plastic tip to the advance lever. # Changed the mirror to transmit more blue light, thus making the image brighter. # Added a detent to the rewind crank to allow it to stay put when pulled out. # Added the capability to take a screw-in type PC sync socket. # Spring load the battery check position of the power switch. # Increase the size of the shutter release cup. # Added a soft rubber ring around the eyepiece. # Added a film reminder holder to the camera back. # Simplify multiple exposure procedure. The number of focusing screens was also expanded from four to nine. In 1980 Canon introduced \\"Laser Matte\\" focusing screens identified by an \\"L\\" in a circle on the screen's label. These Laser Matte screens were noticeably brighter than the earlier screens, and they were continued with the New F-1. Special editions rightthumbThree special Olympic edition Canon cameras; from left to right: * Canon F-1 Montreal (1976) * Canon F-1n Lake Placid (1980) * Canon New F-1 Los Angeles (1984) A special commemorative model of the F-1 was offered for the 1976 Montreal Olympics. It was identical to the regular F-1 but for the Olympic emblem on the front upper left of the body. Canon also manufactured and sold commemorative 55 mm and (much harder to find) 58 mm lens caps with the 1976 Montreal Olympics for their normal lenses in production at the time. For the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, a Special version of the F-1 with the engraved Lake Placid Olympic logo was offered. Special Lake Placid 52 mm lens caps were also made. In 1978 a military model called \\"ODF-1\\" (olive drab) with an all-over olive green finishing was presented. Canon, being the official sponsor of the World Cup, made 1978 55 mm lens caps and 1982 52 mm lens caps commemorating the 1978 and 1982 World Cup events.  References   External links  * Canon Inc.

Putney, 80 Wis. 523, 50 N.W. 403 (Wisc. 1891), was an American torts case that helped establish the scope of liability in a battery. The case involved an incident that occurred in February 1889 in Waukesha, Wisconsin. A 14-year-old boy, Andrew Vosburg, was kicked in his upper shin by an 11-year- old boy, George Putney, while the two were in their schoolhouse's classroom. Unbeknownst to Putney, Vosburg had previously injured his knee, and after the incident he developed a serious infection in the area that required physicians to drain pus and excise bone, and left him with a weakness in his leg for the rest of his life. The verdict of the lawsuit's first trial was set aside, and in the second trial the jury awarded Vosburg $2500 in compensatory damages. The case has been \\"one of the most storied cases in American law\\" since soon after its decision in 1891. The trial found that Putney never intended to cause Vosburg any harm, and the case is often studied in American law schools as an example of the role of intent in tort cases. The case \\"came three times before the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and the court's opinions, the second one in particular, were soon selected for coursebooks on Damages and Torts and became well known to generations of students, teachers and scholars of law. Even a century later, the \\"case\\" continues to stimulate thinking about the judicial process, legal doctrine and liability theory.\\" A variety of Vosburg v. Putney briefs can be found in the external links.  Principals  * Defendant - George Putney (tortfeasor), 11yo, male * Plaintiff - Andrew Vosburg (contact victim), 14yo, male  Summary  * Vosburg v. Putney exemplifies the common law Eggshell skull rule. * This case also illustrates the well-settled proposition that the tortfeasor must take his victim as he finds him. * Material omissions in the statement of facts in a hypothetical question will render it inadmissible. * The fact that the plaintiff is more susceptible to injury does not mitigate a defendant's liability.  Facts  * Defendant and plaintiff were sitting in the classroom of their Waukesha, Wisconsin school -- during school hours. * Defendant reached across the aisle with his foot. * Intending no harm, Defendant made contact with plaintiff at the shin of the right leg (\\"just below the knee\\"). * Plaintiff did not feel the contact due to the degree of force or shock. * Moments later, plaintiff felt a violent pain in the place of contact. * Plaintiff became ill, reporting vomiting and swelling so severe, it twice required surgery. * During 2nd surgery, doctors discovered the bone had degenerated to an unrecoverable state. * Defendant was unaware that plaintiff had sustained injury to the same leg, approximately six weeks earlier. * Expert testimony attributed the damage and loss of limb use to the contact from defendant.  Chronology  * Plaintiff took action against defendant alleging assault and battery. * A lower court found for plaintiff and awarded $2,800. * Defendant appealed. The verdict was set aside and the case was remanded with an order for a new trial. * On second trial, jury returns a special verdict of seven parts. * Defendant motions (JNOV) were denied, a judgment for $2,500 was granted to plaintiff. * Defendant appeals on sixth part of the special verdict - Did defendant intend to do plaintiff harm?  Issues # Whether the plaintiff lacked a cause of action where the jury found the \\"defendant, in touching the plaintiff with his foot, did not intend to do him any harm\\". # Do material omissions in the statement of facts in a hypothetical question render it inadmissible? # Is the recovery of damages limited to what an individual might reasonably be supposed to have contemplated?  Holdings  # Sustained (yes) # Remand, granting new trial. # Sustained (yes) Judgment was reversed, and the case was remanded for a new trial because of error in a ruling on an objection to certain testimony.  Rules  # \\"The intention to do harm is the essence of an assault\\" and \\"If the intended act is unlawful, the intention to commit it must necessarily be unlawful.\\" # \\"there can be no rule of evidence which will tolerate a hypothetical question to an expert, calling for his opinion in a matter vital to the case, which excludes from his consideration facts already proved by a witness upon whose testimony such hypothetical question is based, when a consideration of such facts by the expert is absolutely essential to enable him to form an intelligent opinion concerning such matter.\\" # Brown v. C., M. & St. P. R. Co. 54 Wis. 342 - \\"The rule of damages in actions for torts was held [in a prior case] to be that the wrong-doer is liable for all injuries resulting directly from the wrongful act, whether they could or could not be have been foreseen by him [wrong-doer].  Rationale  # Reasoning that, such is the rule in actions for mere assaults. However, this action was for assault and battery. If the kicking of the plaintiff by the defendant was an unlawful act, the intention to commit it must necessarily be unlawful. # Reasoning that, \\"The error in permitting the witness to answer the question is material, and necessarily fatal to the judgment.\\" # Reasoning that, Previously (1st appeal), it was the opinion that the complaint stated a cause of action ex contractu [out of contract] and not ex delicto [out of tort].

It is located in the city of Neuchâtel and was founded in 1858. The first director was the 71 year old German astronomer Adolphe Hirsche. Besides astronomical observations, the Neuchâtel observatory also works with atomic clocks. Before 1967, one second was defined by the rotation of the earth, and thus Neuchâtel observatory calibrated clocks via observations. Now its telescope is used in a historical fashion by local amateur astronomers, while the calibration is done via atomic clocks.  Description  In the past, the Neuchatel Observatory was known as the Observatoire Astronomique et Chronometrique de Neuchatel, in reference to the fact that it participated in assessing and rating Swiss timepiece movements for accuracy. As marine navigation adopted the usage of mechanical timepieces for navigational aid, the accuracy of such timepieces became more critical. From this need developed an accuracy testing regime involving various astronomical observatories. In Europe, the Neuchatel Observatory, Geneva Observatory, Besancon Observatory and Kew Observatory were examples of prominent observatories that tested timepiece movements for accuracy. The testing process lasted for many days, typically 45 days. Each movement was tested in 5 positions and 2 temperatures, in 10 series of 4 or 5 days each. The tolerances for error were much finer than any other standard, including the modern COSC standard. Movements that passed the stringent tests were issued a certification from the observatory called a Bulletin de Marche, signed by the Directeur of the Observatory. The Bulletin de Marche stated the testing criteria, and the actual performance of the movement. A movement with a Bulletin de Marche from an observatory became known as an Observatory Chronometer, and such were issued a chronometer reference number by the Observatory. The role of the observatories in assessing the accuracy of mechanical timepieces was instrumental in driving the mechanical watchmaking industry toward higher and higher levels of accuracy. As a result, today high quality mechanical watch movements have an extremely high degree of accuracy. However, no mechanical movement could ultimately compare to the accuracy of the quartz movements being developed. Accordingly, such chronometer certification ceased in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the advent of the quartz watch movement. In 2017 the Observatory Chronometer Database (OCD) Observatory Chronometer Database (OCD) went online, which contains all mechanical timepieces (\\"chronometres-mecaniques\\") certified as observatory chronometers by the observatory in Neuchatel from 1945 to 1967, due to a successful participation in the competition which resulted in the issuance of a \\"Bulletin de Marche\\". All database entries are submissions to the wristwatch category (\\"chronometres-bracelet\\") at the observatory competition.

It was the first road going automobile manufactured by the company. History The Vallelunga was based on a roadster designed by Carrozzeria Fissore named after the Autodromo di Vallelunga racing circuit and first shown as a concept car at the Turin Motor Show in 1963. De Tomaso had hoped to sell the design of the concept to another company, but when there were no takers had the car produced by Ghia. Specifications The engine was a 1.5 L straight-4 Kent engine from the Ford Cortina, tuned to a paper output of at 6,200 rpm. A Volkswagen Beetle transaxle, fitted with Hewland gearsets, was used. The chassis was a pressed steel backbone with a tubular subframe at the rear. Suspension was double wishbone and coil springs at all four corners with front and rear anti-roll bars and with uprights sourced from Triumph. The small car weighed with a fiberglass body and many drilled aluminium parts. Brakes were disc type all around. Successor The chassis was not torsionally sound for engines with higher torque, a problem made worse by faulty welding in the Italian-made backbone. Drivetrain vibration was a constant problem for those cars. 50 production cars were built, along with three aluminum-bodied prototypes and five aluminum-bodied racing cars, bringing the total to 58.

Directed by Zelda Barron, the film features Carolina shag dancing and was produced in cooperation with the South Carolina Film Commission. The soundtrack album was on Sire/Warner Bros. Records. Plot The film is a lighthearted story of four teenage girlfriends of various temperaments who escape from their parents for a few days in 1963 for an adventure in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where the big spring festival promises a dance contest, beer blasts, and many cute boys. Carson McBride (Phoebe Cates) is engaged to a tobacco executive's son who is rich but square; Melaina Buller (Bridget Fonda) is a preacher's daughter, but rather promiscuous and fancies herself as a Hollywood sexpot; the bespectacled Luanne Clatterbuck (Page Hannah) is an uptight, prim, and proper senator's daughter; and Caroline Carmichael (Annabeth Gish) is a \\"hometown cutie\\" who has recently lost weight, but she has always been called \\"Pudge,\\" and she suffers from low self-esteem. The trip is spurred by the upcoming marriage of Carson to Harley, the son of a prominent tobacco farmer. On the main strip in Myrtle Beach, their paths cross Buzz and Chip, locals who are cruising around looking for girls. They stay at the second home of Luanne's parents, but are forbidden to sit on the furniture, drink the liquor, or make phone calls, as the trip is a secret. The girls decide to go to a local club so they can shag, but Carson has sworn she won't dance as she feels guilty being in Myrtle Beach instead of going to Fort Sumter, South Carolina, as her fiancé believes. Once at the club, Melaina flirts with the local men, dancing with one she had just told Pudge to reject. She has a run in with local girl Nadine's best friend Suette while doing the limbo and ends up flirting with Big Bob, who is Nadine's dance partner. In the bathroom, the local girls are overheard by Melaina talking about a local beauty pageant and she tells them they won't win because she is entering. While Carson and Pudge sit with Buzz and Chip, Luanne is dragged to the dance floor by a boy that refuses to let her go. Chip shows an interest in Pudge but says he can't dance, and when Buzz asks Carson to dance, she tells him to dance with Pudge instead. The two girls take a ride with Buzz and Chip to a local car-hop eatery, at the same time Melaina takes a ride with Big Bob. Meanwhile, Luanne finally escapes her dance partner and runs outside to see the girls take off in separate cars. Luanne ends up following Melaina and Big Bob, who are also being followed by Nadine and Suette. Bob takes her to a local makeout place, where Nadine and Suette attack his car with shaving cream and drag Melaina out of the car, covering her in the cream, facial tissue and pouring liquor down her throat. Luanne finds Melaina lying on the ground reciting Bible verses and takes her back to the house to clean up, where Melaina tells her she's entering the beauty contest. At the car-hop, Buzz begins to flirt with Carson, not caring that she's engaged and she finds herself drawn to him. Pudge asks Chip to let her teach him the shag, and he grudgingly relents. Once the boys take Carson and Pudge home, Carson calls Harley and tells him she's actually in Myrtle Beach, but doesn't tell him she went out with another man. Pudge is confronted by Chip in the morning while still in her nightgown and rollers, but she is pleased he has come by to see her and she begins their dance lessons. Buzz wakes Carson up by dangling a fly fishing lure in her face and asks her to go fishing with him. Once she tells him nothing will ever happen between them, he agrees and says they should just be friends. Melaina begins practicing her dance routine for the beauty pageant and Luanne walks in on her and shames her into giving a speech from Gone with the Wind instead. Carson and Buzz are fishing and they begin to get closer as the day wears on, while Chip and Pudge ask each other questions relating to sex and relationships. Buzz tells Carson that he doesn't believe she will marry Harley and forces her to confront her beliefs and rules she's set for herself. The girls later come together to see Melaina enter the contest but instead of using her dance routine and wearing a bikini, she has let Luanne influence her into being a more modest contestant, and she loses to Suette, who wins doing a dance routine in a bikini. Harley arrives during the contest and Carson hides from him, while Luanne seeks him out. Melaina gets the idea to have Luanne use her daddy's name as a Senator to invite Jimmy Valentine to the house for a small party, which turns into a rowdy affair. Melaina spends the evening dancing with and impressing Jimmy, while Carson spends more time with Buzz, Luanne and Harley get close, and Pudge and Chip get to know each other more. Carson and Buzz go to Luanne's father's yacht and even though he admits he doesn't believe in marriage, they end up sleeping together. Luanne and Harley also realize they have feelings for each other and are more suited than Harley and Carson were. Chip makes a mistake in saying his feelings for Pudge are friendship and she rejects him. Melaina tries to get Jimmy to pay attention to her once the sun has come up, but he's still drunk and his manager has come to the house to take him away. Melaina realizes the agent is the real celebrity maker and decides to set her sights on him instead. Luanne and Harley wake and are told by the maid that her father and mother are coming to town to judge the shag contest and she sends Chip to pick them up and take them to the pavilion while they repair the damage done to the home. Pudge takes Melaina to the pavilion to meet up with Jimmy's agent and there she sees Chip and realizes that he really does care about her. Luanne and Harley, along with Buzz and Carson, who snuck back from the yacht, follow Pudge and Melaina to the pavilion in time to see Pudge and Chip enter the contest. Once they all see Luanne's parents, she says she will lie to them about the weekend and Carson berates her for not telling the truth. Luanne says she'll tell them the truth if Carson tells Harley the truth. Carson tells Harley she can't marry him because she's in love with Buzz, and Luanne spills the beans about the two having sex in the yacht. Harley attempts to hit Buzz, who ducks his blow and hits a mirror instead, and Luanne comforts him. Chip and Pudge win the contest and agree to stay in touch while Chip attends Annapolis; Melaina impresses the agent who agrees to take her on as a client; Luanne ends up with Harley; and Carson realizes she does not need to be married to be happy.

The story concerns a NYPD detective, the sex worker he alternately loves and arrests, and the seedy characters that haunt the streets of New York City's run-down amusement district. Production A still from an earlier version of the project. Animation on Last Days of Coney Island was drawn traditionally and completed digitally. =Development= Ralph Bakshi had previously pitched the film to major studios such as Pixar and DreamWorks, but was unable to find anyone who wanted to take on the project. When technology began advancing to the point where Bakshi could begin the project on a lower budget, he decided to take on the project himself and produce it independently working with a small development crew in New Mexico. Bakshi is quoted as saying that the animation is \\"probably higher quality than anything I ever made, at a cost so low it's embarrassing. Everything I used to do in my old movies that required hundreds of people and huge salaries is now done in a box. It took 250 people to make Heavy Traffic, now I'm down to five. I kiss the computer every morning — f-----' unbelievable!\\" Production was announced in 2006, attracting much interest, but no official funding, and according to Bakshi, \\"I had about eight minutes of film and a completed script. I thought budget was a slam dunk. For a Bakshi comeback film, it seemed like a no-brainer. [...] I asked one guy [in Hollywood], 'Should I have a budget of $150 million and pocket the rest?' He said, 'Yeah, but you have to make it PG'\\". Bakshi ended the production to rethink his approach towards the film. Its production status was left uncertain. On October 20, 2012, at Dallas Comic-Con: Fan Days, Ralph Bakshi participated in a Q&A; where it was stated that he would take Last Days of Coney Island to Kickstarter in an attempt to crowdsource the funding. A Kickstarter campaign was launched on February 1, 2013 to complete funding for the first short in the film. On March 3, the film was successfully funded and raised $174,195 from 1,290 backers, and Bakshi confirmed production had begun. =Casting= When the project was first announced on Kickstarter, voice actress Tina Romanus, who had previously worked with Baskhi on Wizards and Hey Good Lookin', was confirmed to play the role of Molly, the main character's love interest. In February 2013, actor Matthew Modine was cast in the film after coming across the film's Kickstarter campaign online in the role of Shorty, described as \\"a 4-foot-tall mafia collector who thinks he's Elvis Presley and sings like Chet Baker\\". Omar Jones ended up replacing Matthew Modine in the lead role of Shorty. Other voices include Ralph himself, Eddie Bakshi, Jess Gorell, Jonathan Yudis, Joey Camen and Ron Thompson. =Animation= Much of the production was aided with the use of Toon Boom Studio, computer software designed to assemble 2D animation. Ralph Bakshi is quoted as saying \\"Eddie [Bakshi's son] began some coloring and refining of artwork in Photoshop then gradually moved over to doing this in Toon Boom Studio. The crossover was relatively painless. The programs worked well together. [...] I set up the picture in a traditional manner then Eddie uses Toon Boom Studio to do everything else. My animator Doug Compton also uses Toon Boom Studio to assemble and send pencil tests and animatics. Toon Boom Studio essentially becomes the studio.\\" Early on, Colleen Cox was announced to be the lead animator of the film. Tsukasa Kanayama was also hired as a storyboard artist, with Joseph Baptista helping with the storyboarding and also helping with some of the character designs. Animator Elana Pritchard was also hired to contribute a sequence in January 2014. British illustrator Ian Miller was hired to help with the background art for the film; Miller had previously worked with Baskhi on Wizards and Cool World. Release Last Days of Coney Island premiered on Bakshi's 77th birthday on October 29, 2015 on Vimeo. Bakshi released the film for free on YouTube on October 13, 2016.

Originally released for Windows, Zoo Tycoon 2 is also available for Windows Mobile, PDA, and Mac OS X, although expansions are not included in the Mac version. A Nintendo DS version, titled Zoo Tycoon 2 DS, was released in 2008. Zoo Tycoon 2 features similar gameplay as its predecessor, Zoo Tycoon. The object of the game is to build and operate a zoo by creating exhibits and aquariums, keeping guests and animals happy, and maintaining employees, finances, terrain, and scenery. Gameplay The Zoo Tycoon 2 gameplay revolves around creating suitable exhibits for animals through habitat modifications (ground cover, water, elevation, foliage and rocks and a variety of items including food, enrichment and shelter) which fulfill the animal's needs (habitat, hunger, thirst, stimulation, privacy, sleep, social, exercise). Guests will visit the zoo to see the animals, and they also have needs that need to be fulfilled through scenery and buildings (hunger, thirst, bathroom, seating, entertainment). Zoo Tycoon 2 features three gameplay modes: Campaign, Challenge and Freeform. In Campaign mode, the player plays through a scenario in an existing zoo and is assigned different goals to complete, such as achieving a certain fame level, caring for rescued animals, or breeding endangered species. In Challenge mode, the player starts a zoo from scratch and will be given random challenges which can be accepted or rejected. In both of these modes, players will have limited money to manage and will start with limited access to animals and items, with more becoming available as zoo fame level increases. The last mode, Freeform, allows the player create a zoo from scratch with unlimited money and access to all animals and items from the start. Expansion packs =Endangered Species= In October 2005, Microsoft released the Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species expansion pack. This expansion pack adds more rare animals, including the koala, Gray Wolf, Komodo dragon, scimitar-horned oryx, American bison and orangutan, as well as a number of new forms of transportation, including sky trams, jeep tours and elevated paths. The expansion also has a feature called \\"variant skins\\", which means that when the player adopts an animal, it may look different from normal members of its species (such as a white Bengal tiger and king cheetah). =African Adventure= Zoo Tycoon 2: African Adventure, released in May 2006, adds various new African animals such as the bongo, secretary bird, ratel, and the meerkat, and allows the player to drive through exhibits with African-themed jeep tours to get closer to them. The expansion pack also includes new maps based on well-known African locations, as well as new desert-themed buildings, lizard live food, and a new set of challenges and campaigns. The Jeep vehicle tours originally included in Endangered Species are featured in this expansion, with the addition of the new Jeep Liberty. =Dino Danger Pack (premium download)= The Dino Danger Pack was released at the end of July 2006. The pack could only be downloaded from the Zoo Tycoon website via credit card. It added four new animals to the game- Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Carnotaurus, and Styracosaurus, as well as new objects to be used for them and a campaign game. The Dino Danger Pack could be purchased and downloaded at Zoo Tycoon premium downloads. Since the release of Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals, which includes more updated versions of all of the animals included in the pack, Dino Danger was taken offline from the Zoo Tycoon website and can no longer be downloaded there. However, other sites still offer this pack. =Zookeeper Collection= The Zookeeper Collection was released on October 17, 2006. Rather than being an expansion, it is more of a large combination pack featuring the Endangered Species and African Adventure expansions, as well as all animals and content from Zoo Tycoon 2. =Marine Mania= Released on October 17, 2006, Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania features 20 new aquatic animals, new marine options, marine shows and several other new gaming features. The expansion also includes marine plants, the ability to build tanks, animal shows, mini games to teach some of the player's marine animals behaviors, and four new aquatic biomes (reef, coastal, pelagic, and benthic), and new scenarios and challenges. Changes have been made to the original method of biome layout allowing the ability to turn off rocks, flowers and/or trees. New animals range from the giant whale sharks to the tiny rockhopper penguins. =Extinct Animals= A typical zoo in Extinct Animals, with Styracosauruses and a short-faced bear Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals was released on October 17, 2007. It is the largest and latest expansion in the Zoo Tycoon series, with 34 adoptable animals and one bonus animal. The player can find fossils, or get staff to find them. The player can then assemble the fossils, and can also create normal and \\"Super\\" extinct animals in an extinct research lab. The player can also stop rampaging dinosaurs. = Ultimate Collection = Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection contains the original game, all four official expansions and a new menu theme exclusive to it, similar to Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection.Zoo Tycoon - ZOO NEWS - JUNE 19, 2008 This title was released on September 30, 2008. Some users reported disk problems, whereby the third disk was the same as the second one. Microsoft sent free disk replacements at their support site. Microsoft subsequently licensed the game to Ubisoft, who re-released the Ultimate Collection in a variety of formats across multiple territories including a single disk DVD-ROM for Windows PCs. Reception According to The NPD Group, Zoo Tycoon 2 was the 19th-best-selling computer game of 2004. It rose to 13th place on NPD's annual computer game sales chart for 2005, a position it maintained for 2006. The game received generally positive reviews. IGN gave the game a 7.5/10 praising the game's lasting appeal while criticizing the game for being too easy , while GameSpy noted the improved 3D graphics.

It was issued as an 8-song, 10\\" album (Capitol H-488) and as a 45rpm EP set, but it was the first Sinatra \\"album\\" not to have a 78rpm multi-disc-album release. In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. Background Prior to his switch to Capitol, Sinatra had already begun to change his sound. His experience in the nightclubs of Las Vegas had given him a more mature, jazzy sound that did not lose its intimacy. Additionally, his resounding success in From Here to Eternity infused him with renewed confidence. Sinatra now sings with assuredness born of the experience of survival. He convinced his new producer Voyle Gilmore to record the charts that he had performed at the Riviera and the Sands. The arrangements were usually performed by eight musicians when Sinatra performed live, but for the recording eleven musicians were used, possibly indicating orchestration had been reduced for the concerts.Friedwald pp. 120-121 Recording The tracks were conducted by Nelson Riddle, the sessions for this album and the preceding singles (\\"I've Got the World on a String\\" and \\"From Here to Eternity\\") initiating a long-standing collaboration between the arranger and singer that would continue for the next twenty years. All the arrangements were by one of Sinatra's Columbia Records arrangers, George Siravo, except for \\"Like Someone in Love\\", which Riddle arranged.Friedwald p. 182 Sinatra was using Siravo's charts in his contemporaneous night club appearances, and the studio musicians were surprised by the worn condition of the charts, which differed from the new music pages typically distributed at a such a recording session. Songs For Young Lovers followed a formula similar to Sinatra's previous releases for Columbia - rather than compiling a potentially inconsistent set of former hits, a set of newly recorded songs would be arranged around a specific theme or concept. This time around, the singer had more artistic freedom, and producer Voyle Gilmore was supportive of the album's consistent format. In addition, the state-of-the-art Capitol studios were capable of producing a more detailed sound, which gave Riddle more freedom in his arrangements and orchestrations. Release The album was originally released in February 1954. The album art features a young couple taking a private stroll in the dark, with Sinatra leaning against a lamp-post in the foreground. In 1960, the eight songs were combined with the eight songs from the 10\\" album Swing Easy! on a new, 16 song, 12\\" LP (Capitol W-587) called \\"Swing Easy!\\", featuring the \\"Swing Easy!\\" cover but including a miniature inset of the \\"Songs for Young Lovers\\" cover. In 1962, the 1954, 8-song, 10\\" album was released as a 12-song, 12\\" LP (Capitol W-1432) with four extra songs added: \\"Someone To Watch Over Me\\", \\"My One And Only Love\\", \\"It Worries Me\\", and \\"I Can Read Between the Lines\\". The cover of the new album included both previous album covers.http://sinatrafamily.com/album/songs-for-young-lovers-441/Capitol Records – W-1432 at Discogs In 1971 it was re-issued as a ten track album under the name My One and Only Love. Impact Nelson Riddle was influenced by Siravo's arrangements, and how well they fit Sinatra. Both arrangers knew that the arrangements should provide interest, but never overshadow the singer. Whereas Siravo was rooted in swing, Riddle would break from those confinements. As Riddle received credit and Siravo received none, Siravo came to resent the slight. Riddle, although in no way responsible for the lack of due credit, was later to send personal apologies. In 2002, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

Adaptation to Desert Environment; A Study on the Jerboa, Rat and Man. London: Butterworths, 1962. 19. Print. The pelt of the jerboa is either silky or velvety in texture and light in color, the coloration helps camouflage into surroundings to avoid predators. All members of the genus have five toes except for a single species, the Four-toed Jerboa, Allactaga tetradactyla of Northern Africa.  Adaptation to desert conditions  Jerboas are adapted to live in deserts therefore are called xerocole animals. They are nocturnal and spend most of their day burrowed under sand to avoid the heat.Hearst, Michael, and Jelmer Noordeman. \\"Unusual Creatures: A Mostly Accurate Account of Some of the Earth's Strangest Animals\\". San Francisco Chronicle, 2012. Print. Burrowing under the sand, they evade the heat from the sun, minimizing water loss and avoiding dehydration. By decreasing activity during the day they require less water intake. The jerboas build large burrow systems, tunnels, to stay in during the day. These burrows have a higher moisture concentration than at the surface level and help reduce body water loss. Specific species of jerboas plug burrow entrances with soil to retain moisture and keep hot air from entering burrows. The pelt of the jerboa is usually light and sandy in color to reflect heat from the sun and reduce heat absorption.Rundel, Philip Wilson; Gibson, Arthur C. (30 September 2005). \\"Adaptations of Mojave Desert Animals\\". Ecological Communities And Processes in a Mojave Desert Ecosystem: Rock Valley, Nevada. Cambridge University Press. pp. 132–138. .  Social habits  Jerboas are highly social animals and require interactions with other jerboas. After nightfall, they congregate in large burrows and demonstrate intense activity. At the entrance of the burrow, each male jerboa leaves droppings to identify they are in the burrow.Kirmiz, John P. Adaptation to Desert Environment; A Study on the Jerboa, Rat and Man. London: Butterworths, 1962. 30. Print.  Diet  The hot temperature of the desert restricts the jerboas to search for food at nightfall, when the temperature is cooler. Diet varies by species, some feeding almost exclusively on vegetation and others are insectivores. They search for sprouting vegetation, roots, and/or dry grains. During autumn, jerboas are at their heaviest in preparation for hibernation. Jerboas are not considered agricultural pest.Ercüment, Colak. \\"Ecology and Biology of Allactaga Elater, Allactaga Euphratica and Allactaga Williamsi (Rodentia: Dipodidae) in Turkey.\\" Tr. J. Zool.

Talbi. \\"Distribution and Seasonal Variation in Hypothalamic RF-amide Peptides in a Semi-Desert Rodent, the Jerboa.\\" Journal of Neuroendocrinology 25 (2013): 402-11. Print.  In captivity  Captured jerboas have lived up to two years outside of their natural habitat. In captivity, their life span is significantly reduced. Jerboas rely on social interactions with other jerboas. Additionally, their nature is to burrow in the sand, in captivity or as pets they died from stress if no sand is available.

The passage of glacial ice over underlying bedrock often results in asymmetric erosional forms as a result of abrasion on the \\"stoss\\" (upstream) side of the rock and plucking on the \\"lee\\" (downstream) side. These erosional features are seen on scales of less than a metre to several hundred metres.Douglas Benn and David Evans, Glaciers & Glaciation, Arnold, London, 1st ed. 1998 Etymology The 18th-century Alpine explorer Horace-Bénédict de Saussure coined the term roches moutonnées in 1786. He saw in these rocks a resemblance to the wigs that were fashionable amongst French gentry in his era and which were smoothed over with mutton fat (hence moutonnée) so as to keep the hair in place. The French term is often incorrectly interpreted as meaning \\"sheep rock\\".Lutgens, Fred and Ed Tarbuck, Essentials of Geology, Prentice Hall, 2011, 11th ed. Description thumbnail An oblique view of a roches moutonnées surface at Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada; notice the contiguous, wavy rows of glaciated bedrock which resemble old-fashioned wigs as mentioned by Horace de Sassure The contrasting appearance of the erosional stoss and lee aspects is very defined on roches moutonnées; all the sides and edges have been smoothed and eroded in the direction travelled by the glacier that once passed over it. It is often marked with glacial striations. The rough and craggy down-ice (leeward) side is formed by plucking or quarrying, an erosional process initiated when ice melts slightly by pressure and seeps into cracks in the rock. When the water refreezes, the rock becomes attached to the glacier. But as the glacier continues its forward progress it subjects the stone to frost shattering, ripping pieces away from the rock formation. Studies show that the plucking of the lee side is a much more significant erosional process than the abrasion of the stoss side. The side profile of a stoss and lee glaciated, bedrock knob (an erosional feature) is opposite to that of a drumlin (a depositional feature). In a drumlin, the steep side is facing the approaching glacier, rather than trailing it. Even larger examples are known from Sweden where they are referred to as flyggbergs. The Swedish flyggbergs have been interpreted by Sten Rudberg and others as reshaped inselbergs. Ice-smoothed bedrock bumps which lack the steep, plucked lee side faces are referred to as whalebacks or rock drumlins. Prest (1983) specifies a distinction between a glaciated \\"roches moutonnées surface\\" and a simple \\"stoss and lee\\" glacial feature. He says that the term \\"roches moutonnées surface\\" has been abused in the literature in which the term became interchangeable with the term \\"stoss and lee\\". He points out that a \\"roches moutonnées surface\\" is a continuous bedrock surface having a resemblance to the continuous, wavy or undulating rows of curls seen in French wigs at the time of Horace de Saussure while a simple stoss and lee feature refers only to a bedrock knob having a smooth stoss side and a plucked lee side appearance.Prest, V.K. (1983). Canada’s heritage of glacial features. Miscellaneous Report 28, Geological Survey of Canada, pp. 26–27, fig. 24 a, b and c Roches moutonnées may not be entirely glacial landforms, taking most of their shape before glaciation. Jointing that contribute to the shape typically predate glaciation and roches moutonnee-like forms can be found in tropical areas such as East Africa and Australia. Further, at Ivö Klack in Sweden, weathered rock surfaces exposed by kaolin mining resemble roches moutonnées.

He was born on 8 February 1891.Prajnanapada, Ramaswamy Srinivasan, \\"Talks with Swami Prajnanapada \\", Vidya Bhavan, India (edition 1977). Page available: He entered the life of Sannyasa and became Niralamba Swami’s disciple in 1924-25 at Channa ashram. Besides living at Channa Ashram (located at Channa village, Burdwan, India), he had also established an ashram in Ranchi, India. A unique method of teaching of Swami Prajnanapada was his establishment of one-to-one contact with his disciples and devotees instead of giving religious discourses. He was an astute psychoanalyst as well. Life = Early life = Swami Prajnanapada was born as Yogeshwar Chattopadhyay on 8 February 1891 at Chinsurah, near Kolkata(then Calcutta), in West Bengal, India. He was the fourth of 5 children. His parents and eldest brothers died in an epidemic when he was young. His elder brother Lakshmi Narain took care of his education. In 1916 he graduated from Srirampur, a town near Kolkata. In 1918 he graduated with a gold medal with a master's degree in Physics from Calcutta University. Between 1918 and 1920 he taught at TNG College, Chagalpur and B.N.College, Patna. In 1920 he joined the non-cooperation against the British Raj, called by the Indian national congress. = Spiritual awakening = In 1921 he met Niralamba Swami who later became his Guru. Though he was increasingly turning to spirituality he continued teaching at various universities in Bengal and Bihar. In 1923 he was invited to lecture at Kashi Vidyapith, one of the most famous colleges of Banaras Hindu University. In 1925 he took sannyasa and wandered in the Himalayas. His brother persuaded him to return assuring him that he could carry on his spiritual quest at home. He returned to Kashi Vidyapith. In the same year a daughter was born, named Chinmayee. In 1930 he gave up his teaching post and left Varanasi for good, at the behest of Niralamba Swami who requested him to take charge of Channa Ashram after his death. = Final years = Swami Prajnanpada had a congenital heart condition which deteriorated with passage of time partly due to the intensive psychoanalysis sessions he conducted for his disciples. He had his first serious heart attack in 1972. In 1974 he died at the Ranchi Ashram. Disciples Some of his notable Indian and non- Indian disciples included R. Srinivasan, Yogendra Narayan Verma, Shailaja Devi Verma, Sumongal Prakash, Minati Prakash, Daniel Roumanoff, Pierre Wack, Frédéric Leboyer, Roland de Quatrebarbes, Arnaud Desjardins, Denise Desjardins, and Olivier Cambessedes.http://www.svami-prajnanpad.org/disciples.html  Teachings   Lying sessions  References *Hornby, A S, \\"Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English\\" (5th ed.), UK: Oxford University Press (1998). , pp. 1433–1475. *Prajnanapada, Ramaswamy Srinivasan, Talks with Swami Prajnanapada, Vidya Bhavan, India (edition 1977).

Biography =Early life= Con Constantine migrated to Australia with his parents and siblings from the town of Maroni, near Larnaka, Cyprus at the age of 10. At a young age, he started working in a takeaway food store before going on to sell houseplants. In 1985, he built Parklea Markets (on the site of a former drive-in cinema), initially operating it as a plant nursery while seeking council approval. After approval was granted, Parklea Markets quickly established itself as one of the premier retail destinations in Western Sydney. In recent years, Constantine has expanded his interests to Newcastle, 150 km north of Sydney, where he is the owner of The Store. He recently purchased two Newcastle community papers, the Newcastle & Lake Macquarie Post and the Hunter Post, from Fairfax Media. Constantine is a supporter of his local Blacktown Greek Orthodox parish as well as many legitimate Sydney and Newcastle charities. =Newcastle United Jets= Constantine was the owner and chairman of Newcastle United Jets, an Australian professional football (soccer) club based in Newcastle. The club competes in the A-League and plays its home games at Hunter Stadium. They were the A-League Champions for the 2007–08 A-League season, after defeating the Central Coast Mariners 1-0 in the Grand Final. The club was formed in 2000 when it joined the National Soccer League as Newcastle United. Constantine replaced Jets' manager Richard Money with an Australian, Nick Theodorakopoulos, for the 2006/2007 A-League season. Theodorakopoulos was sacked as manager after a lacklustre start to the season. The new coach was Gary van Egmond with support from assistant coach Mark Jones. For the 2009–10 season, former Sydney FC coach Branko Culina was appointed head coach after Gary van Egmond's shock departure. Constantine chose to bring in controversial striker Mario Jardel to Newcastle. The Brazilian legend had a successful career, but was out of shape and out of form by the time he arrived at the Jets.

Plot Ernest \\"Stick\\" Stickley (Burt Reynolds), a former car thief, has just been released from prison after serving seven years for armed robbery. He meets up with an old friend, Rainy (Jose Perez), who talks Stick into accompanying him for a \\"quick stop\\" near the Florida Everglades before they go to his home. The \\"quick stop\\" turns out to be an illegal drug deal set up by Rainy's dealer, Chucky (Charles Durning), that goes sour. Chucky's albino henchman, Moke (Dar Robinson), kills Rainy, but Stick gets away. Stick must now hide out for a while to elude the killers, who must eliminate him as a witness. While lying low, Stick finds himself in the right place at the right time when he helps a wealthy eccentric named Barry (George Segal), get into his locked car. Hired as a driver, he now has a comfortable home with a stable job, and tries to make up for lost time with Katie, his teen-age daughter. He also finds a new flame in Kyle (Candice Bergen), a financial consultant who acts as a business adviser for Barry, who must decide if a relationship with Stick is worth it. Stick confronts Chucky to demand the money owed to his murdered friend, wanting to use the money to start a new life. Chucky refuses, and after being pressured by his voodoo obsessed cartel boss, Nestor (Castulo Guerra), to eliminate the ex-con, Chucky sends Moke and some other hitmen after Stick. Nestor has Stick's daughter kidnapped to force him out of hiding. Nestor, fed up with Chucky's bumbling, hires Moke to kill him. Stick confronts the two on the balcony of Chucky's high rise apartment before Moke can shoot Chucky, and Moke taunts Stick to try and get to him before he can pull a handgun from his belt. Chucky surprises Moke, pushing the men over the balcony railing. Chucky falls to his death, but Moke manages to grab onto a lower beam. Moke asks for help, but Stick mocks as Moke falls to his death, shooting his gun at Stick on the way down. Stick goes to Nestor's home, and methodically eliminates all of Nestor's henchmen, before confronting Nestor himself.

The book sold well and, along with the publication of La Brava, and helped revive interest in Leonard's career, particularly when it was announced Burt Reynolds would make a film of it. Reviewing the book, the New York Times wrote \\"when Mr. Leonard is observing, satirizing, plotting, working up suspense, thickening the air with menace, discharging it in lightning flashes of violence, exposing the black holes behind the parts people play - when he tends to business, that is, he gives us as much serious fun per word as anyone around.\\" Leonard expressed interest in writing more books with the character of Stick because he \\"is so unpredictable that I can probably get a lot more mileage out of him.\\"\\"Novelist's Bad Guys Have Him Riding High\\", Stasio, Marilyn. The Philadelphia Inquirer December 15, 1983: C.1. =Development= \\"I wanted to make that movie as soon as I read the book,\\" said Reynolds. \\"I respected Leonard's work. I felt I knew that Florida way of life, having been raised in the state. And I was that guy!\\" Leonard was paid $350,000 to write a screenplay. =Filming= Filming took place in Florida in October 1983. George Segal said he liked working on the film. \\"If you had ever asked me if I'd ever be in a Burt Reynolds movie, I would've said, 'There's no way. No chance.' I don't know how that happened. Oh, I think he saw A Touch of Class and wanted me. Whatever it was, I had a great time down in Florida. He was a wonderful director, and he made it so nice for the actors. It's so nice to have an actor or an ex-actor directing you, because they get it, you know?\\" Famed stuntman Dar Robinson, who played Moke, the albino hit-man, filmed his death scene by free falling from the side of a building while firing a gun. Robinson used his own invention, a decelerator, so cameras could film from above without a visible airbag below (a scattering crowd of people below can also be seen in this shot). A breaking device slowed his descent as he fell backwards towards the ground. This was Robinson's only true acting credit before he died in an on-set motorcycle accident during the making of Million Dollar Mystery in 1986. =Reshoots= Reynolds recalled \\"I turned in my cut of the picture and truly thought I had made a good film. Word got back to me quickly that the people in the Black Tower [Universal's head office] wanted a few changes.\\" He later reflected, \\"It was one of those usual Universal Studio stories: A director goes and makes a movie and thinks it's wonderful. I went tripping down to Florida to relax, and I get a call from (MCA president) Sid Sheinberg saying he hated the movie. I said, 'So what? I'm sorry you don't feel good about it, but I tried.' He said, 'You don't understand; we're going to recut it, rescore it and reshoot it.' And they did.\\"\\"Burt is back and he's fighting mad\\", The Gazette, March 31, 1987: A9. The studio pulled the movie from its release schedule and asked Reynolds to reshoot the second half of the film. A new writer was brought in along with a subplot involving his character reuniting with his daughter post-prison. Reynolds says his agent advised him to go along with the changes: > I gave up on the film. I didn't fight them. I let them get the best of > me...Leonard saw the film the day he was interviewed for a Newsweek cover > and told them he hated it. After his comment, every critic attacked the film > and he wouldn't talk to me. When I reshot the film, I was just going through > the motions. I'm not proud of what I did, but I take responsibility for my > actions. All I can say--and this is not in way of a defense--is if you liked > the first part of 'Stick,' that's what I was trying to achieve throughout. \\"I didn't say anything at the time,\\" he later added. \\"I decided to keep my mouth shut and swallow hard. But it was devastating. I didn't want to direct for another four years.\\" Reception Stick received negative reviews from critics. Despite opening at No. 1 in its first weekend, the film was a box- office flop, grossing just $8.5 million when compared to its $22 million budget. =Critical= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 29% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that Reynolds had been miscast \\"by a director who should have known better, that director being Mr. Reynolds himself. Certainly his eagerness to film Mr. Leonard's Florida-based crime drama is understandable; the book has crackling tough-guy dialogue and a story that practically tells itself. What is less understandable is his insistence on reshaping such ostensibly foolproof material to support a star turn.\\"Maslin, Janet (April 26, 1985). \\"Screen: 'Stick' With Burt Reynolds\\". The New York Times. C15. A review in Variety stated \\"Despite a few good action sequences, overall pic lacks the tension and suspense that could have got audiences involved instead of only mildly interested. Reynolds' direction is competent, but lacks the texture that could have fleshed out the distinctive personalities.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Stick\\". Variety. May 1, 1985. 13. Gene Siskel gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"What director Reynolds and actor Reynolds have done to 'Stick' is inexcusable. They've made it part burlesque and part conventional chase picture. Actor Reynolds' portrayal of Stick, a gritty ex- con out to avenge a friend's murder, is not much different from his good-old- boy persona in the 'Cannonball Run' films.\\" Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Elmore Leonard's novel \\"has been rendered jokey, flaccid, and, the worst crime of all, deadly slow. All this in spite of the fact that Leonard was the original screenwriter.\\"Benson, Sheila (April 26, 1985). \\"Ex- Con Back in Society in 'Stick'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 1. Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post wrote \\"Reynolds never figures out whether he's making a thriller or a spoof, which has been the problem with his performances, too. His acting swivels from gravelly, glowering tough-guyness to nudge-and-wink appeals to the audience—Mr. T and Johnny Carson in one. And he's way too polished for the character Leonard wrote; when he enters the slick world of Miami finance, he blends right in.\\"Attanasio, Paul (May 4, 1985). \\"'Stick' in the Mud\\".

They even put another writer on it to add more action... Burt had done Sharky's Machine and Gator and I thought he would be good as Stick. But he needed a good director. Directing it himself, he just played Burt Reynolds.\\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/31/booksforchildrenandteenagers.elmoreleonard \\"It's very, very theatrical,\\" Leonard added. \\"I do everything in my power to make my writing not look like writing, and when it appears on the screen you see all these actors acting all over the place.\\" The movie's advertising slogan was: \\"The only thing he couldn't do was stick to the rules.\\" Leonard hung up a poster in his den with the word \\"rules\\" covered by a piece of paper on which was written the word \\"script\\". \\"The movie isn't anything like the book,\\" he said. \\"The plot was taken out. In place of the scam are machine guns.\\"\\"Plotting the Crimes Pays Off at Last for Leonard: After 23 Books, Elmore Leonard Is Being Discovered Thanks to 'Glitz', Gerston, Jill. The Philadelphia Inquirer March 7, 1985: E.1. Leonard compared it with the film made of 52 Pick-Up. \\"One thing I like a lot [about that film] is the pacing -- the picture begins immediately, and from there it moves. The dialogue doesn't wait for a reaction, it's almost throwaway, with the exception that you can hear it clearly. In Stick, Burt Reynolds gave you a beat or two after every line so you could react to it, like it was a comedy. It ruined the rhythm.\\" =Proposed TV series= In 1988, NBC had a TV spin-off of the novel in development. However no series resulted.

History Lord Levene, Chairperson of the Defence Reform Steering Group. = Background = In August 2010 the then Defence Secretary, Liam Fox, asked Lord Levene, a former Chief of Defence Procurement, to chair the Defence Reform Steering Group. The group's remit was to independently review defence and the structure and management of the Ministry of Defence. The group reported in June 2011, with a key recommendation being that a Joint Forces Command (JFC) should be created to manage and deliver specific joint capabilities and to take the lead on joint warfare development, learning from lessons and experimentation to advise on how the military should conduct joint operations in the future. The Defence Reform report also made the following recommendations: * Joint Forces Command should be led by a military four-star ranking officer who would have responsibility for commanding and generating the joint capabilities allocated to the command and setting the framework for joint enablers that sit in the single services. * A number of military organisations currently managed centrally within the MOD should pass to Joint Forces Command, including the Directorate Special Forces, the Defence Academy and the Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre. * The Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) should sit within the Joint Forces Command, but report for operational purposes direct to the Chief of the Defence Staff. * In implementing Joint Forces Command, the MOD should review in detail joint or potentially joint capabilities and functions across the armed services (Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force), to determine which could be rationalised, the benefit of further joint organisations, which organisations should transfer to Joint Forces Command and which should transfer to a lead service. = Establishment as Joint Forces Command = The creation of Joint Forces Command was overseen by the then Vice Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, and the Defence Reform Unit, alongside the wider implementation of the new defence operating model identified by the report on Defence Reform.

She is noted for her paintings which were the basis for Hummel figurines. Early life Born in Massing in Bavaria, Germany, as Berta Hummel, one of the six children of Adolf and Victoria Hummel, living above her father's dry goods store. As a child Berta showed creative talent, and developed a reputation in the village as the local artist. She was a cheerful, active girl, who loved the outdoors and winter sports. Her father encouraged her artistic talents and, at age 12, enrolled her in a boarding school of the Sisters of Loreto in Simbach am Inn, about 30 kilometres away. Hummel continued to grow in her abilities, and after graduation in 1927 she enrolled in the prestigious Academy of Applied Arts in Munich, where her talent and skills developed. Hummel was a devout Catholic and instead of the standard student housing, she chose to live in a Catholic residence run by religious sisters. While living there, she made friends with two members of the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of Siessen (Sießen) in Bad Saulgau who were also studying at the Academy. The religious congregation focuses on teaching, and gives great emphasis to the role of art in education. After Berta graduated in 1931 with top honors, she chose to follow a religious calling that she had felt for some time and applied to enter that congregation, and was admitted in April 1931 as a postulant. Berta made one final visit to her family home in late May, spending two weeks with them. On 22 August, she was admitted as a novice and received the religious habit of the congregation and the religious name of Sister Maria Innocentia. Life in the convent and as an artist After completing her novitiate year, Hummel was assigned to teach art in a nearby school run by the convent. Though her days were busy teaching, Hummel spent her spare time painting pictures of children. The sisters were impressed with her art and sent copies to Emil Fink Verlag, a publishing house in Stuttgart which specialized in religious art, to which Hummel reluctantly agreed. The company decided to release copies of the works in postcard form, which were popular in the early 20th century. In 1934, it also published a collection of her drawings, titled Das Hummel-Buch, with poetic text by the Austrian writer Margarete Seemann. Soon afterward, Franz Goebel, the owner of a porcelain company, was looking for a new line of artwork, and happened to see some of these postcards in a shop in Munich. Hummel agreed, mostly for its saving the employment of many workers, and the convent granted him sole rights to make figurines based on her art. Interest in the figurines increased after they were displayed in 1935 at the Leipzig Trade Fair, a major international trade show. A decade later, the figurines would gain popularity in the United States when returning American soldiers brought them home. In 1937, two events in Hummel's life were to mark her future. On 30 August, she made her final profession as a permanent member of the Congregation. Also, she had released a painting titled \\"The Volunteers\\", which drew the enduring hatred of Adolf Hitler, who attacked the art, denouncing the depiction of German children with \\"hydrocephalic heads\\". Although the Nazi authorities allowed Hummel to work, they banned the distribution of her art in Germany. One Nazi magazine, the SA Man (issue of 23 March 1937), wrote of her work: Significantly, Hummel also drew sketches that contained the Star of David, a dangerous theme in those times. She portrayed angels in gowns covered with slightly skewed six-pointed stars. She also designed a series of Old and New Testament symbols for the convent chapel in 1938–39. She symbolized the juncture of the two Testaments by designing a cross with a menorah before it. Wartime suffering and death In 1940, the Nazi government closed all religious schools, including those of Siessen. Later that year, it seized the convent itself, forcing most of the community to leave. Out of a community of some 250 sisters, the 40 sisters who were allowed to remain were confined to a small section of the convent, living there without heat and without any means to support themselves. Hummel returned to her family at this time, but within three months so missed community life that she asked to be allowed to return. The Superior, Mother Augustine, O.S.F., allowed her to do so. Hummel was given a small cell which served as both sleeping quarters and her studio. The Nazis took half of the money generated by her work, but the remaining funds were the main source of income of the sisters there. Food was scarce and it was very cold in the winter. Mother Augustine later wrote of that period, \\"What we suffered was indescribable\\". Hummel was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1944 and was sent twice to a sanatorium in Isny im Allgäu. She returned to the convent after five months, just before the region was liberated by the Free French Forces. She did not recover, and died on 6 November 1946, aged 37. She was buried in the convent cemetery. Legacy Goebel, his team of artists, and a board of sisters from the convent carried on her legacy through the figurines, all of which were based on her artwork. Goebel Germany discontinued the figures in October 2008. Sister Innocentia's sister, Centa Hummel, established the Berta Hummel Museum in the family home in Massing. Centa died September 2011, just before her 100th birthday, and the management of the museum passed to her son. One of the children depicted in her work, Sieglinde Schoen, established The Hummel Museum in New Braunfels, Texas, in the United States, which displayed about 280 of Hummel's original pieces. These pieces had been stored in Switzerland by a private collector during the War. The museum discontinued as a venue of Hummel's work in 2001. The first Mayor of Rosemont, Illinois, USA Donald E. Stephens, amassed one of the largest collections of figurines in the world. Upon his death, he bequeathed the entire collection to the City of Rosemont. To house it, the city built the Donald E. Stephens Museum of Hummels, which opened 13 March 2011.Journal Online \\"Rosemont's Hummel Museum Opens\\" See also * List of German women artists References External links * M.I.

The station had a legacy of serving Boston's African-American community as a R&B; outlet (and its subgenres) from 1958 to 2011. The transmitter for WILD is in Medford. The station's power output was originally 1,000 watts, but was increased to 5,000 watts in 1978. History WILD first went on the air in 1946 as WBMS, with a classical-music format. Eventually, the station went to a \\"popular music\\" format, briefly adopted the call letters WHEE, then went back to being WBMS. By the end of the fifties, the call letters were changed to WILD under owner Bartell Broadcasters, who tried a personality DJ and music format. The station's history is best known for a long-lasting urban contemporary format which began in the late 1950s (after several years in which Italian-language programming and rhythm and blues programs for the black community shared the station's schedule). WILD became the respected voice of Boston's black community for many years. In 1958, Nelson Noble acquired the license of the station. In September 1966, WILD was sold to Dynamic Broadcasting Corporation owned by Leonard E. Walk. In 1972, the Sheridan Broadcasting Corporation purchased Dynamic Broadcasting. In August 1980, locally based Nash Communications, owned and operated by Kendall Nash, bought WILD. When Nash died in 1999, his wife, Bernadine, took the helm of the station's operations. WILD first saw competition when WZOU flipped to a Rhythmic Contemporary Hits format as WJMN (\\"Jam'n 94.5\\") in 1993. However, it was not until 1999, when African American-owned Radio One entered the market with WBOT, that WILD saw real competition for Boston's African American population. =Local ownership ends= In May 2000, Radio One took control of WILD through a local marketing agreement, which became an outright purchase later that year. After purchasing the station, Radio One slowly evolved WILD from a rather mainstream Urban Adult Contemporary format to a format that focused more on classic soul music. In addition, the syndicated Tom Joyner morning show was added to the lineup, with the former morning host (\\"Coach\\" Willie Maye) relegated to giving local updates on the show. WILD, WBOT: A partnership with a beat, Boston Globe, May 18, 2000 Joyner brings activism, music to WILD, Boston Globe, August 24, 2000 Bernadine Nash's 'WILD' ride, Boston Globe, November 16, 2000 In 2005, Radio One brought about the biggest changes to the station in many years. The 1090 signal was plagued with some problems. While the signal covered the Boston area (including areas of the city with large African American populations), the station was forced to sign-off every night as a result of former clear channel station WBAL in Baltimore. In addition, the strong Arbitron ratings of WILD had warranted a better and more-powerful frequency. However, Radio One had come up with a solution. On October 20, 2005, Radio One moved the Urban Adult Contemporary format to the dial position of WBOT. The move replaced \\"Hot 97.7\\" for most of the day, but the former mainstream urban format remained from 4:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. WBOT subsequently picked up the call letters of WILD-FM. The move cleared the 1090 frequency for a new format, so when WILD signed on at sunrise on October 20, it was reborn as a new urban contemporary gospel formatted station, \\"Praise 1090\\", based on the success of WPZE-FM in Atlanta and WPPZ in Philadelphia. A 'WILD' change of format, Boston Globe, October 20, 2005 The \\"Praise 1090\\" format was short-lived. On January 30, 2006, the 1090 frequency changed formats again. WILD became the Boston affiliate for the company's African American-targeted news/talk network, featuring Michael Eric Dyson and 2 Live Stews. WILD to air new African- American talk radio network, Boston Globe, October 29, 2005 Other talent that were heard on WILD during this period included \\"The Truthfighters Show\\" with Warren Ballentine, and \\"Keeping It Real\\" with The Reverend Al Sharpton. A local morning program was also added, featuring Jimmy Myers, taking the longtime Boston radio host out of his retirement. The station retained the Black gospel format for weekend programming. The Tom Joyner Morning Show returned to WILD from 6:00am (Sunrise) to 10:00am eastern during this tenure. While other affiliates of the network adopted the slogan, \\"The People's Station\\", WILD was unable to do so, as that was the slogan of WILD-FM. Instead, WILD used \\"Where Information is Power\\", the slogan of Radio One's longtime urban news/talk station WOL in Washington, D.C.. =WILD-FM is sold= On August 21, 2006, radio industry website All Access reported that Entercom bought WILD-FM and changed the format (after a \\"stunt\\") to rock (a simulcast of WAAF 107.3), a move designed to improve WAAF's signal in Boston area. WILD-FM flipped to the simulcast at 5:30 p.m. on August 22. The sale of WILD-FM meant that the Tom Joyner morning show would return to AM 1090, and WILD would revert to contemporary inspirational and gospel music , ending the news/talk format. Entercom to buy Boston's WILD-FM for $30 million, Boston Globe, August 22, 2006 Fans say WILD format should not be silenced, Boston Globe, October 10, 2006 The news/talk format subsequently returned that December. In the summer of 2008, the station flipped to a various/brokered format on the weekdays and Classic Soul and Gospel on weekends.

It was released in 1954 as a 10\\" album (Capitol H-528) and consisted of only eight songs, as each side of the record only allowed approximately fourteen minutes of music. In 2000 it was voted number 368 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Background The album was Sinatra's second for Capitol and the first to feature arrangements by Nelson Riddle (Riddle had merely conducted on Songs for Young Lovers). As its title implies, the record concentrates on up-tempo swingers done with a light touch. Again, the songs were all standards -- \\"Just One of Those Things,\\" \\"Wrap Your Troubles in Dreams,\\" \\"All of Me\\" -- which the singer felt benefited from the new thematic setting, new arrangements, and his increasingly playful and textured vocal style. In 1955, the eight songs were combined with the eight songs from the 10\\" album Songs for Young Lovers on a new, 16 song, 12\\" LP (Capitol W-587) called Swing Easy!, featuring the Swing Easy! cover but including a miniature inset of the Songs for Young Lovers cover. In 1960, the 1954, 8 song, 10\\" album was re-released as a 12 song, 12\\" LP (Capitol W-1429) with four additional songs added to expand the running time: \\"Lean Baby\\", \\"I Love You\\", \\"How Could You Do A Thing Like That To Me?\\", and \\"Why Should I Cry Over You?\\".

It is a Level I command authority, directly under the Ministry of Defence. It consists of the Chief of Defence and three service staffs, Operations and Planning Staffs, known collectively as Forsvarsstaben (the Defence Staff), Arctic Command and the Special Operations Command.organizational chartOrganisation of the Defence Command History The Defence Command was established on the basic of law no. 334 of 18 June 1969 about the origination of the Danish Defence; in order to reduce resources expended and make a true combined Defence command of Denmark. It was a continuation of the Danish defence re-construction of 1950, which erected Ministry of Defence, Chief of Defence, Defence Staff, Army Command, Søværnskommandoen and Flyverkommandoen. These latter commands were in 1969 combined into one and placed under the Ministry of Defence, giving the Chief of Defence full administrative and operational command of all branches of the Danish military. The staff of these former branch commands continued to exist inside FKO, but in 1982, which saw a major reconstruction of FKO, they too vanished in favour of an even more branch independent organisation. The reorganization resulted in a unified command structure similar to the previous General Command. The Danish Defence agreement 2005–09 called for another major re-construction of the Danish military, affecting the origination of FKO. Between 1973 and 2006 FKO was located in Vedbæk (Henriksholm Allé) a little north of Lyngby, in a modern steel and concrete building, built 1970 – November 1972 by Defence Construction Service. FKO moved to this building in March 1973. FKO moved to Søarsenalet on Holmen Naval Base on July 24, 2006. As a result of the Danish Defence Agreement 2013–17, the FKO saw major structural reorganization, to such an extent that it was renamed Joint Defence Command (). On 1 January 2019, as part of the Danish Defence Agreement 2018–23, the name was reverted back to the previous name.

He was the first of only two governors in state history born in Jefferson County, despite the fact that Louisville (the county seat) is the state's most populous city. The second governor born in Jefferson County is the incumbent governor, Andy Beshear. After graduating from the University of Louisville, Wetherby held several minor offices in the Jefferson County judicial system before being elected lieutenant governor in 1947. He was called Kentucky's first \\"working\\" lieutenant governor because Governor Earle C. Clements asked him to carry out duties beyond his constitutional responsibility to preside over the state Senate, such as preparing the state budget and attending the Southern Governors Conference. In 1950, Clements resigned to assume a seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. Wetherby won immediate acclaim by calling a special legislative session to increase funding for education and government benefits from the state's budget surplus. In 1951, he won a four-year full term as governor, during which he continued and expanded many of Clements' programs, including increased road construction and industrial diversification. He endorsed the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation order in the case of Brown v. Board of Education and appointed a biracial commission to oversee the successful integration of the state's schools. As chairman of the Southern Governors Conference in 1954 and 1955, he encouraged other southern governors to accept and implement desegregation. Limited to one term by the state constitution, Wetherby supported Bert Combs to be his successor, but Combs lost in the Democratic primary to A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler, a former governor and factional opponent of both Wetherby and Clements. Chandler's failure to support Wetherby's 1956 bid to succeed Democrat Alben Barkley in the Senate contributed to his loss to Republican John Sherman Cooper. From 1964 to 1966, Wetherby served on a commission charged with revising the state constitution, and in 1966 he was elected to the Kentucky Senate, where he provided leadership in drafting the state budget. Following this, he retired from politics and served as a consultant for Brighton Engineering. He died March 27, 1994, of complications from a broken hip and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Early life and career Lawrence Wetherby was born January 2, 1908, in Middletown, Kentucky.\\"Kentucky Governor Lawrence Winchester Wetherby\\". National Governors Association. He was the fourth child of Samuel Davis and Fanny (Yenowine) Wetherby.Powell, p. 102 His grandfather was a surgeon in the Union Army during the Civil War. His father was also a physician and farmer, and during his childhood years, Wetherby worked on the family farm.Kleber in Kentucky's Governors, p. 191 After graduating from Anchorage High School, Wetherby enrolled in the pre-law program at the University of Louisville. He was a letterman on the football team in 1927 and 1928; he also played second base on the baseball team in 1928 and 1929, and was a letterman in that sport in 1929.Bolus, p. 1932 He was later inducted into the university's Athletic Hall of Fame.\\"Athletic Hall of Fame\\". University of Louisville In 1929, he earned his Bachelor of Laws degree and went to work for Judge Henry Tilford. The two would remain partners until 1950.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 398 On April 24, 1930, he married Helen Dwyer; the couple had three children.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 945 Thanks to his father's influence, Wetherby became interested in local politics at an early age.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 399 School board races fascinated him, and he allied himself with a faction of the Jefferson County Democratic Party headed by Leland Taylor and Ben Ewing. When Ewing was elected county judge in 1933, he appointed Wetherby as a part-time attorney for the Jefferson County juvenile court. He held this position through 1937, then returned to it in 1942 and 1943. In March 1943, he was appointed the first trial commissioner of the juvenile court. Lieutenant governor Wetherby was elected chairman of the 34th Legislative District Democratic Committee in 1943 and held the position through 1956. In March 1947, he resigned as trial commissioner of the juvenile court in order to run for lieutenant governor. The strongest of his four opponents in the Democratic primary was Bill May, the nephew of U.S. Representative Andrew J. May.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 400Pearce, p. 48 May had sought the support of gubernatorial candidate Earle C. Clements, but Clements refused, possibly because Congressman May was an ally of Clements' political opponent John Y. Brown. Wetherby was also unable to secure Clements' public endorsement, but he won the primary and went on to defeat Republican Orville M. Howard by over 95,000 votes.Kleber in Kentucky's Governors, p. 192 Despite Clements' refusal to endorse Wetherby in the primary, the two generally agreed on their legislative agendas and worked well together. Some observers called Wetherby Kentucky's first \\"working\\" lieutenant governor.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", pp. 400–401 Previous lieutenant governors did little beyond their constitutionally mandated duty of presiding over the Kentucky Senate, but during Clements' administration, Wetherby was charged with preparing a state budget, presiding over the Legislative Research Commission, leading tours for the state Chamber of Commerce, and attending the Southern Governors Conference.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 401 Clements also made Wetherby executive secretary of the State Democratic Central Committee, which allowed Wetherby to make many important political contacts. Governor of Kentucky On November 27, 1950, Clements resigned to accept a seat in the U.S. Senate, elevating Wetherby to governor. One of his first actions was to call a special legislative session to convene on March 6, 1951 for the purpose of allocating the state's $10 million budget surplus. Among the expenditures approved in the special session were increases in teachers' salaries and state benefits for the needy and government employees.Harrison in The Kentucky Encyclopedia, p. 946 Wetherby's popularity soared as a result of this session, and he seriously considered running for the Senate seat vacated by the death of Virgil Chapman in 1951. Instead, after talking with Clements and other Democratic leaders, he decided to seek a full, four-year term as governor.Pearce, p. 52 =Election of 1951= Among the potential candidates for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1951 was former governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler, who was about to be released as baseball commissioner.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 403 Chandler and Clements were bitter political enemies, and the possibility of a Chandler candidacy provided the Clements faction of the Democratic party with the impetus to unite behind Wetherby to prevent Chandler from gaining the nomination. Ultimately, Chandler did not seek the nomination and, despite implying that Clements controlled Wetherby, Chandler endorsed Wetherby on May 15, 1951.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 405 Wetherby had little trouble defeating Howell Vincent and Jesse Cecil in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, polling the largest majority ever in a Kentucky primary race. In the general election, Wetherby faced Republican Court of Appeals judge Eugene Siler.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 406 Siler was a fundamentalist Christian who claimed that the state government was full of corruption, and only he could stop it. Citing the gambling in Northern Kentucky, bribery accusations against members of Clements' and Wetherby's administrations, and a 1951 scandal involving the University of Kentucky men's basketball team, he referred to Frankfort as \\"our Nineveh on the Kentucky River\\". Wetherby countered Siler's accusations of corruption by removing one of the officials accused of bribery from office.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p 407 He deployed the newly organized Kentucky State Police to counter organized crime in Campbell and Henderson counties. To further discourage crime, he supported legislation to revoke the alcohol licenses of establishments that allowed gambling. Siler's pro-temperance and anti-Catholic views played well in the state's rural areas, but cost him the vote of the growing urban population.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 402 Wetherby won the election by a vote of 346,345 to 288,014. =Administration= Early in Wetherby's term, the state's revenues were inflated by the Korean War.Kleber in Kentucky's Governors, p. 195 Having adopted a pay-as-you-go program for the state, he was forced to raise additional revenue after the war ended. He did so by imposing sin taxes on cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and parimutuel betting, but he was unable to convince the General Assembly to adopt a sales tax. Because three members of Wetherby's close family had been killed in automobile accidents on the state's roadways, improving roads was a high priority for Wetherby.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 409 Using revenue from a two-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax passed under the Clements administration, Wetherby authorized the building, re-building, or re-surfacing of nearly of roads during his administration. The most important of these was the state's first toll road—the Kentucky Turnpike—connecting Louisville and Elizabethtown.Pearce, p. 54 He encouraged President Dwight D. Eisenhower to construct a federal toll road connecting the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. Other political leaders joined him, convincing Eisenhower to construct the long-talked-about Interstate Highway System. Improved roads brought increased tourism, which Wetherby supported by increasing funding to the state park system and adding Breaks Interstate Park, a new park owned jointly by Kentucky and Virginia.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 410 Wetherby also brought national attention to Kentucky as prime hunting and fishing land by conducting his own personal sporting excursions in the state. Wetherby tried to diversify the industries located in Kentucky to balance the state's primarily agrarian economy.Kleber in Kentucky's Governors, p. 193 He expanded the Agricultural and Industrial Development Board and charged it with conducting land surveys to identify potential industrial sites. He encouraged the development of modern airports in the state and supported the canalization of the Big Sandy River and improvement of the locks and dams on the Kentucky River. He continued to personally lead tours given by the state's Chamber of Commerce. Among the industries that came to the state during his administration were the General Electric Appliance Park in Louisville and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 411 In 1954, he used the state police to quash labor unrest in Central City and other parts of the Western Coal Fields. He was not a pawn of industry, however: he secured passage of the state's first laws regulating strip mining and killed a right-to-work bill in 1954. Neither did Wetherby ignore the needs of agriculture. Under his Green Pastures Program, measures were enacted to diversify crop production, improve beef production, and encourage soil conservation. He secured federal flood control programs for the watersheds of the Salt, Licking, Green, and Kentucky Rivers, saving valuable farmland. In 1952, Wetherby organized an agricultural council to consolidate the work of the state's agricultural bureaucracy. He oversaw completion of the state fairgrounds in Louisville, a project begun under Clements, to better display the state's agricultural products. Improvements in education were a hallmark of Wetherby's term as governor. Over the course of his administration, he increased funding to education by $20 million.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 414 He called for the creation of an educational television network and initiated the state's first publicly funded bookmobile program.Kleber in Kentucky's Governors, p. 194 He supported the 1954 Minimum Foundation Program, an amendment to the state constitution that allowed funding to be allocated to school districts based upon need rather than number of pupils. In 1954 and 1955 Wetherby served as chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and urged the southern governors to peacefully implement desegregation as required by the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. He was one of five southern governors that refused to sign a statement opposing integration.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 416 In Kentucky, he appointed an advisory council of both white and black citizens to oversee public school integration, which was accomplished with little acrimony compared to other states. Desegregation was one issue where Wetherby and his lieutenant governor, Emerson \\"Doc\\" Beauchamp, disagreed, but because Beauchamp believed he would succeed Wetherby as governor, he did not openly oppose Wetherby's actions. Among Wetherby's other accomplishments were the creation of a Department of Mental Health and the construction of fifteen hospitals and thirty health centers throughout the state. In 1952, he created the Youth Authority as a central point for the administration of services to delinquent children.Kleber in \\"As Luck Would Have It\\", p. 412 He constructed new state prisons, modernized the probation and parole systems, and established a more orderly system of selecting grand and petit juries. He also oversaw some voting reform measures, including the provision of funds to purchase voting machines in areas where they were desired. He was not as successful in the area of government reform. He failed in his efforts to amend the state's constitution to allow the governor to succeed himself in office. He was also unable to win support for a plan to consolidate some of Kentucky's counties. In 1955, the state's voters approved a constitutional amendment granting suffrage to eighteen-year-olds over Wetherby's objections. Later life Both Clements and Wetherby endorsed Bert Combs to succeed Wetherby as governor.Pearce, p. 56 Wetherby had named Combs to the Kentucky Court of Appeals in 1951 to fill a vacancy created by the death of Judge Roy Helm.Pearce, p. 58 Happy Chandler, Clements' old foe, ran against Combs in the primary and painted him as a pawn of \\"Clementine\\" and \\"Wetherbine\\", his derogatory nicknames for Clements and Wetherby.Pearce, p. 61 In fact, Chandler ran the entire campaign not just against Combs, but against Clements and Wetherby as well. He charged both Clements and Wetherby with extravagant spending in their administrations. Among his allegations were that Clements had purchased a $20,000 rug for his office and that Wetherby had paneled his office with African mahogany. Chandler promised that, if elected, he would use \\"good, honest Kentucky wood\\" in his office and that all Kentuckians would be invited to the capitol to walk on the $20,000 rug. Ultimately, invoices showed that no $20,000 rug had been purchased by Clements, and Wetherby's paneling had been purchased from and installed by a local contractor.Pearce, pp. 61–62 Chandler's charges may have been inaccurate, but he defeated Combs in the primary and went on to win the general election. Following his term as governor, Wetherby resumed his private law practice. In 1956, Senator Alben Barkley unexpectedly died of a heart attack.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 404 The timing of his death meant that the state would elect two senators in 1956—Clements' term was expiring and now Barkley's seat was vacant. President Eisenhower convinced former senator and ambassador John Sherman Cooper to be the Republican candidate for the seat, hoping Cooper's immense popularity in the state would help his own re-election bid.Finch, p. 168 Barkley's death occurred so late in the year that there was not time for a Democratic primary to choose the party's candidate for the open seat. The Democratic state committee chose Wetherby, who was only six months removed from his term as governor. Neither Wetherby nor Clements enjoyed the support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson suffered a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from the campaign trail for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 405 It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years. After this defeat, Wetherby moved to Franklin County and secured a position at Brighton Engineering with help from his old primary opponent, Bill May.Pearce, p. 49 From 1964 to 1966, he was a delegate to an assembly charged with revising the state constitution. In 1965, May backed Wetherby in his campaign for the Kentucky Senate. He won the election, defeating the candidate favored by Chandler, and was chosen president of that body from 1966 to 1968. He was so effective in this position that the state's 1966 budget was debated for only ten days before passing by a vote of 31–5 in virtually the same form as it was presented.Harrison in A New History of Kentucky, p. 412 After his service in the state senate, Wetherby returned to Brighton Engineering, where he eventually became a vice-president. He died March 27, 1994 of complications from a broken hip. He is buried at the Frankfort Cemetery.

Marie, Michigan, United States. Broadcasting a college radio format, The 46th Parallel Radio is the campus radio station of the city's Lake Superior State University, and also provides mobile DJ services for on-campus and Sault Ste. Marie events. From 1993–2017, the station broadcast at 90.1 on the FM dial with the call sign WLSO, before becoming solely an internet radio station during the 2016–2017 school year. The station originally launched in 1991, as WLKR, an AM carrier current station broadcasting exclusively to the LSSU campus. After receiving a broadcasting license from the Federal Communications Commission, the station launched on FM in 1993, when they adopted the WLSO call sign. Following a listener contest earlier that year, WLSO rebranded as The 46th Parallel Radio in August 2016, and launched a new internet streaming format through the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System and Backbone Networks. Lake Superior State University relinquished its FCC license as of November 2, 2017, having already taken the 90.1 FM signal dark earlier that year, with most social media accounts ceasing updates in the process. The FCC, however, did not actually cancel the station's license until January 16, 2020. In the fall of 2019, The 46th Parallel Radio's Instagram page resumed active posting after a 3-year hiatus, promoting on-campus events and an impending search for new DJs. While largely a freeform college radio station, The 46th Parallel has traditionally featured student DJs hosting their own programs and custom playlists, as well as school faculty and non-students at times. Notably, general music rotation on WLSO leaned towards adult album alternative music in its later years on FM, while the station has also aired Lake Superior State Lakers games and coverage in the past. Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant also simulcasts their own radio station to the Sault Ste. Marie market at WCMZ-FM, though they air a public radio and jazz format. Studio The 46th Parallel Radio studios are located in the basement of the Cisler Center. The studio was moved there from Brady Hall in 2006 to be more visible in the campus community and easier to access by students.http://www.lssu.edu/stugov/sg_res/2005-02-21.doc The studio consists of management offices, a recording booth, and the on-air broadcast studio. The station broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week year- round.Lake Superior State University :: Office of Student Activities & Leadership Development :: Student Handbook WLSO runs on automation whenever there is no live show in the studio, which usually occurs at night and over breaks. WLSO has recently undertaken remote broadcasting. The station currently broadcasts live from student government meetings, concerts, and open-mic nights on campus. The studio has a 40-second broadcast delay as well as phone patch to take calls and put them on the air. Transmitter The station's transmitter site was moved in October 2007. It was formerly located in the old studio, in the east basement of Brady Hall. It was relocated to another location in Brady Hall where it was re-engineered and re-built. WLSO operates two transmitters. The primary transmitter is a R.V.R. TEX-300-LCD installed in March 2008. The original, now a backup transmitter, consists of a Bext TEX-20-NV exciter and a separate Bext PJ-200 power amplifier. The station's antenna system is on the roof of Brady Hall. It is a 2-bay circularly-polarized radiator. Programming is sent to the transmission site utilizing the Tele-Link Studio Transmitter Link (STL) from Energy-Onix. WLSO utilizes Sine System's Remote Facilities Controller (RFC-1) at the transmitter site. It allows for remote and automatic controls, system monitoring and acts as an alarm system calling station engineers immediately in the event of a system fault. WLSO's RFC-1 monitors 24 channels of telemetry and logs all data though GetTelemetryGetTelemetry software. WLSO also uses as an Orban Optimod 8200-FM audio processor connected to a controlling computer at the transmitter. WLSO's air signal is continually monitored by an Inovonics FM modulation analyzer model 531 and received audio is sent back to the studio to be checked. All equipment is protected through a Polyphazor lighting-arrestor and several back-up power supplies, allowing uninterrupted broadcasts and relaying notifications from the Emergency Alert System (EAS) to the community in the event of a power disruption or other emergency.

Biography Collins received his BE from the University of Canterbury in New Zealand in 1964 and his PhD from the University of New South Wales in Australia in 1968. He joined the University of Toronto in 1969, was appointed to the Bahen- Tanenbaum Chair in Civil Engineering in 1995 and was selected as a University Professor in 1999. He is currently working on his Doctorate of Science. Collins has concentrated his research effort on understanding how cracked reinforced concrete resists shear stress. Shear failures can cause concrete structures to collapse without warning and hence, accurate analytical models for shear behaviour are critical for public safety. Unfortunately, most traditional shear design procedures rely upon empirical design rules which lack a rigorous theoretical basis and can be dangerous if applied to new situations. The Compression Field Theory, and subsequently the Modified Compression Field Theory, developed by Professor Collins and his colleagues at the University of Toronto, Division of Engineering Science, provides a rational basis for shear design and has received worldwide recognition. A Simplified Modified Compression Field Theory is currently the design standard in the Canadian CAN/CSA A23.3-04 which is the basic truss model, and soon to be updated and included in the European Building Code.

Like the earlier models, the New F-1 takes FD-mount lenses. Although no date has ever been confirmed, it is thought that the last New F-1 was still being made in 1992. It was officially discontinued in 1994, and factory support ended in 2004. The New F-1 is a manual-exposure camera capable of TTL full-aperture metering and stopped-down metering with the included Eye-Level Finder FN. Aperture-priority AE is available by attaching the optional AE Finder FN. Also, shutter-priority mode is optionally available when using either AE Motor Drive FN or AE Power Winder FN .The New F-1 Instructions, p.29 The New F-1 is an expandable system. It consists of interchangeable viewfinders, focusing screens, motor drives, and alternate backs, all of which are specific to the New F-1. All other Canon components, such as the FD lens series, close up accessories (bellows, extension tubes, etc.), and Canon A and T Speedlights (except the 300TL) are also compatible with the system. Interchangeable viewfinders The New F-1 system has 5 different viewfinders, which can be quickly and easily changed by depressing the two buttons on the rear of the finder, pulling it off the camera body, and pushing the new finder into place. * Eye-Level Finder FN * AE Finder FN :The Eye-Level and AE Finders are the basic eye-level prism finders, similar to most other SLR systems' prism finders. Both include a hot shoe for on-camera flash, or attachments to remotely trigger the shutter. Both also include an integral eyepiece shutter, which closes over the eyepiece to prevent light leakage during long exposures. :When using the AE finder, setting the shutter speed dial to 'A' engages a small switch on the finder which puts the camera into aperture-priority auto exposure mode. The normal meter display to the right of the through-the-lens (TTL) image disappears from the viewfinder, and a different meter display appears below the TTL image, which indicates which shutter speed the AE system has chosen. * Speed Finder FN :The Speed Finder uses two separate prisms separated by a swivel, to allow either eye-level or waist-level viewing, and the ability to switch quickly between the two. The optics are designed in such a way that the finder's image is visible up to 6 cm away from the eyepiece, enabling the photographer to use the finder even with glasses or goggles. The Speed Finder also has a hot shoe. * Waist-Level Finder FN * Waist-Level Finder FN-6X :Both Waist-Level Finders are useful in situations which require use of a low angle, or for copy work, photomacrography, or astrophotography. The image is reversed left-to-right in the finder. The Waist-Level Finder FN has a collapsible barrel and a flip-up 4.6x magnifier, while the 6x model has a 6x magnified image, and an integral diopter adjustment. Interchangeable focusing screens The New F-1 system also has 13 different focusing screens, in a variety of metering modes (center-weighted averaging, selective-area, and spot, though not all are available with spot metering), for a total of 32 different screens. The screens are named with a two-letter designation, the first indicating the metering type (A for averaging, P for area metering, and S for spot metering), and the second indicating the style of screen, as listed below. * A - Standard Microprism (A, P) * B - New Split (A, P, S) * C - Overall Laser Matte (A, P, S) * D - Laser Matte with Grid (A, P) * E - New Split/Microprism (A, P, S) * F - Microprism/Fast Lenses (A, P) * G - Microprism/Slow Lenses (A, P) * H - Laser Matte with Scale (A, P) * I - Laser Matte with Double Cross-Hair Reticle (A, P, S) * J - Bright Laser Matte/Short Lenses (A, P, S) * K - Bright Laser Matte/Long Lenses (A, P, S) * L - Cross Split (A, P) * M - A/B Size Laser Matte (A, P) The standard screen supplied from the factory in F-1 bodies is the Focusing Screen FN-AE (averaging metering, New Split/Microprism style) for bodies shipped with an AE finder FN, and FN-PE (partial metering, new split/microprism style) for bodies shipped with an Eye Level Finder FN. Replacing a screen is a simple operation. The finder is removed from the camera, and the screen is then pried up using a fingernail along the silver rear edge of the screen. The new screen is pressed into place, and the finder put back on. Automatic film advance There are two different motorized film advance units in the New F-1 system: the AE Power Winder FN, and the AE Motor Drive FN. The AE Power Winder FN allows up to 2 frames per second (frame/s) in continuous mode, and the AE Motor Drive allows up to 5 frame/s in high-speed mode and 3.5 frame/s in low-speed mode. Both units also have single-exposure mode, where only a single frame is exposed when the shutter release is held down. Both units also have a second shutter release for vertical format shooting, and a subtractive frame counter. Only the AE Motor Drive FN has a motorized film rewind (therefore when using the AE Power Winder FN it is not necessary to remove the Rewind Coupler cover from the bottom of the camera). The AE Power Winder FN is powered by 4 AA batteries, and is a single self- contained, unexpandable unit. The AE Motor Drive FN is a more complete system, as it has 3 different battery packs to choose from: the Battery Pack FN, the Ni-Cd Pack FN, and the High Power Ni-Cd Pack FN. The Battery and High Power Ni-Cd packs will power the motor drive for up to 50 rolls of film, while the Ni-Cd pack provides power for up to 30 rolls. The Battery Pack FN takes 12 AA batteries. The two Ni-Cd packs have to be plugged into a charger to recharge them. The High Power Ni-Cd pack will also power the camera body itself by replacing the camera's battery with Battery Cord C-FN. Both units add the possibility of shutter-priority auto exposure mode by setting the lens's aperture ring to 'A'. The aperture needle disappears from the meter display, and the meter needle indicates what aperture the AE system has selected. Also, using either of the motor drive systems also enables use of electronic interval timers and remote shutter releases, both wired and wireless. Interchangeable backs The standard camera back is also interchangeable with a couple other units. One is the Data Back FN, which has 3 dials with letters, numbers, and Roman numerals. The left-hand dial is labeled \\"Year\\", and has a blank, 0-9, 82-93, I-X, and a-g; the middle dial is labeled \\"Month\\", and has a blank, 0-31, and A-G; the right-hand dial is labeled \\"Day\\", and has a blank, and 0-31. The back imprints the dial settings onto the film for classification or dating purposes, either at the time of shutter release, or when the manual record button is pressed. The Film Chamber FN-100 is a bulk film back which allows up to 100 exposures without reloading. It requires use of the AE Motor Drive FN. Special Editions In addition to the standard version of the New F-1, Canon produced a few special editions of the camera. =Canon 50 years commemorative model= 1983 Canon launched a commemorative model for its 50th anniversary. The model is a standard model with a golden Canon logo. =Swiss Post model= Canon delivered a few models for the Swiss Post with a fixed ALOS 3,5/35 lens. =Los Angeles Olympics Edition= New F-1 Los Angeles Olympics Edition, with added Motor Drive/Power Pack FN and 50 mm f/1.4 lens. Canon was the official camera sponsor of the 1984 Summer Olympics and produced a commemorative edition of the New F-1 for the occasion. This edition has gold instead of white for the 'Canon' and 'F-1' lettering on the camera, and a gold 1984 Summer Olympics emblem on the rewind side of the front. Both the AE Finder FN and Eye Level Finder FN were available. The Eye- level Finder FN Olympic editions are much more difficult to find now, presumably due to lower production compared to the AE Finder version. =New F-1 High Speed Motor Drive= Also constructed for the 1984 Summer Olympics was a high-speed camera for the sports photographers covering the event. This followed on from Canon's previous attempt at a high-speed sports photography camera, the F-1 High Speed Motor Drive camera, produced for the 1972 Winter Olympics held in Sapporo, Japan. This new camera attained a record 14 frames per second performance, achieved through the use of a fixed pellicle mirror instead of the normal moving mirror, a high-speed metal blade shutter, and a large and powerful motor unit and battery pack. It is estimated that under a hundred of these specialised cameras were constructed. =U.S. Navy model= Canon supplied a number of New F-1 cameras to the U.S. Navy. These were largely identical to the civilian models except for Navy markings. References External links * Canon Inc. New F-1.

Joint warfare is in essence a form of combined arms warfare on a larger, national scale, in which complementary forces from a state's army, navy, air, and special forces are meant to work together in joint operations, rather than planning and executing military operations separate from each other. Its origins can be traced to the establishment in 1938 of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, the world's first joint higher command structure, though it should not be seen as the same level of \\"jointness\\" as Joint Chiefs of Staff. The United States Department of Defense, which endorses joint warfare as an overriding doctrine for its forces, describes it as \\"team warfare\\", which \\"requires the integrated and synchronized application of all appropriate capabilities.

Early life Charles Birger was born to a Jewish family in the Russian Empire, and emigrated to the United States as a child with his parents. Birger and his family settled in St. Louis, where, aged eight, Charlie got a job as a news boy at the Post-Dispatch newspaper. Later, Birger moved to the O'Fallon, Missouri area, where he started work in a pool room. On July 5, 1901, Birger enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to Company G of the newly formed 13th Cavalry Regiment, then stationed in South Dakota. Birger was described as a good soldier and was honorably discharged on July 4, 1904, at Fort Meade, South Dakota. When he left the army, he became a cowboy. However, he eventually returned to Illinois, where he met his wife, Edna, and became a miner in the quickly expanding coal mining community of Harrisburg, later to become a keeper at one of the local saloons. Bootlegger and gang leader Following World War I, in 1919, the United States adopted national prohibition, which banned the sale, manufacture, and transportation of alcoholic beverages. Birger recognized this as a business opportunity, and in 1920 he joined forces with the Shelton Brothers. Birger initially based his operation in Harrisburg, Southern Illinois. The law authorities in Saline County eventually persuaded him to leave, and he built a fortified speakeasy called Shady Rest just across the line in Williamson County. Shady Rest stood next to old Highway 13, halfway between Harrisburg and Marion. A small barbecue stand just off the highway served as the guard shack. War with the Ku Klux Klan Charlie Birger and the Shelton Brothers Gang fought for control of the coal fields of southern Illinois, but their attention was diverted by a common enemy. In the 1920s the Ku Klux Klan supported national prohibition. Alcohol was regarded as an \\"un-American\\" vice practiced by immigrants, many of whom were Roman Catholics and other religions. Many immigrants worked in the coal mines of southern Illinois, living mainly in very small towns with a strong ethnic identity. Alcohol was a part of their life, and bootlegging came naturally to them. In the spring of 1923, the Klan began organizing in Williamson County, holding meetings attended by more than 5000 people. The Klan drew its support from both the farming community and people in the larger towns, the latter mainly of southern origin and belonging to the Baptist and other traditional Protestant churches. The Klan soon found a charismatic leader in S. Glenn Young, a 58-year-old former federal law enforcement officer.http://genealogytrails.com/ill/williamson/obity.htm Large mobs began going door to door, forcibly searching houses for alcohol. If alcohol was found, the occupants were taken to Klan \\"prisons\\". Federal authorities apparently had deputized the Klansmen to aid in the enforcement of Prohibition. Many elected public officials of Williamson County were viewed as being allies of the bootleggers, perhaps correctly. These elected public officials were driven from office and replaced by Klan members. The state government was either unable or unwilling to reestablish lawful authority. On January 24, 1925, a shot was fired in the street in Herrin, Illinois. Deputy Sheriff Ora Thomas responded and walked into a cigar store, where he saw Klan leader Young. Thomas drew his pistol and shot Young twice. Young was able to shoot Thomas once before falling to the floor. Two of Young's companions joined in the melee, and all four men were fatally wounded.S Glenn Young The Klan held a public funeral for Young that was attended by more than 15,000 people. In April 1926, Charlie Birger and the Shelton Brothers joined forces to attack the remaining Klan leaders in Herrin, using Tommy guns and shotguns. The police were called repeatedly, but did not respond. The Klan buried its dead and the coroner ruled that the deaths were homicides \\"by parties unknown.\\" Although the Klan's losses were not large, the Herrin attack broke the back of the local KKK. Lawfully elected officials returned to their offices, and Birger and the Shelton Brothers went back into business. War with the Shelton Brothers Gang Charlie Birger regarded Harrisburg as his hometown, and refused to tolerate crime there. When a small shop was robbed, Birger publicly made good the owner's losses and the suspected thief was found shot dead a few days later. This incident coincided with the beginning of his war with the Shelton Brothers Gang, fought over control of bootlegging in the area. By October 1926, the Birger and Shelton Gangs were in open conflict. Both gangs built \\"tanks\\"—trucks converted into makeshift armored vehicles from which they could shoot. The Shelton Gang even tried to bomb Shady Rest from the air. The dynamite they dropped missed. Many were killed during the war, and sometimes it was not clear which side they were on. Three deaths became important in ending Birger's own life. Joseph Adams was the mayor of West City, Illinois, a village near Benton. Birger learned that the Sheltons' tank was in Joe Adams' garage for repairs, and demanded the tank. When Adams failed to surrender it, Birger's men orchestrated a drive-by bombing, destroying Adams' front porch. In December 1926, two men, Harry and Elmo Thomasson, appeared at Joe Adams' house, announcing that they \\"had a letter from Carl [Shelton]\\". They handed a letter to Adams, and as he started to read it, they drew their pistols and shot him dead. The following month, the Shady Rest was destroyed by a series of large explosions and an ensuing fire. Four bodies (one a woman's) were found in the ruins, charred beyond recognition. This was widely seen as a decisive blow struck by the Sheltons. At about the same time, Illinois state trooper Lory Price and his wife went missing. Price was widely believed to be associated with the Birger gang. He had been running a scam in which Birger stole cars and hid them until a reward was offered. Then the trooper pretended to find the cars and split the reward with Birger. Hanging of Charlie Birger In June 1927, Birger was arrested on a charge of ordering the murder of Joe Adams. Birger allowed himself to be taken into custody without a fight. He had been arrested many times, and had always been released a few days later. He may not have realized that the trial was to take place in Franklin County, one that he did not control. Birger and the two men who did the killing were convicted; however, only Birger was sentenced to hang. Birger objected that it was unfair he should hang while the confessed trigger man was sentenced only to prison. Nevertheless, Birger was hanged for the murder of Adams on April 19, 1928, at the Franklin County Jail in Benton. At Birger's request, he was accompanied to the gallows by a rabbi and wore a black hood rather than a white one, since he did not want to be mistaken for a Klansman. Charlie Birger was next to last man to be executed in a public hanging in Illinois (Charles Shader was hanged October 10 of that year). He shook hands with the hangman, the \\"humane hangman\\" Philip Hanna, and his final words were, \\"It's a beautiful world.\\" (Local southern Illinois legend attests that Birger said \\"It's a beautiful day\\", in defiance, while the newspapers reported the remorseful \\"It's a beautiful world.\\") Birger's place as a southern Illinois folk legend is recorded in John L. \\"Ox\\" Gwaltney's \\"Charlie Birger\\": ::I heard of Charlie Birger way back when I was young ::My daddy told me all about the day that Charlie hung. ::I've heard so many stories, some of his ghastly deeds ::Another tells how Charlie helped poor folks in their needs. ::One said he was a kindly man who never told a lie ::But when somebody crossed him, that man was sure to die ::That Charlie had no Master you can tell from all the tales ::He fought the system all the way, and stayed out of their jails ::I've seen so many pictures, they're hanging on the walls ::The pictures tell the story of Birger's rise and fall ::And when they finally caught him he was sentenced to be hung ::But they hadn't broke his spirit the day the trap was sprung ::When the State had had its vengeance—When Charlie's life was done ::It made one stop to wonder, Who had lost, and who had won. :::John Lastle Gwaltney Southern Illinois Poetry (1985) Charlie Birger is buried in Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery in University City, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. His marker bears his birth name of Shachna Birger. His sister (Mrs. Rachel Shamsky) and one of his two daughters are buried nearby. Birger's name entered the news again in 2006 when the granddaughter of the county sheriff who had supervised the execution sued the local historical museum in an attempt to regain possession of the noose used in the hanging.

The disease is often contracted through association with other diseases of the body, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or rheumatoid arthritis. There are three types of scleritis: diffuse scleritis (the most common), nodular scleritis, and necrotizing scleritis (the most severe). Scleritis may be the first symptom of onset of connective tissue disease. Episcleritis is inflammation of the episclera, a less serious condition that seldom develops into scleritis.  Signs and symptoms  Scleral translucency following recurrent scleritis. Symptoms of scleritis include: *Redness of the sclera and conjunctiva, sometimes changing to a purple hue *Severe ocular pain, which may radiate to the temple or jaw. The pain is often described as deep or boring. *Photophobia and tearing *Decrease in visual acuity, possibly leading to blindness The pain of episcleritis is less severe than in scleritis. In hyperemia, there is a visible increase in the blood flow to the sclera (hyperaemia), which accounts for the redness of the eye. Unlike in conjunctivitis, this redness will not move with gentle pressure to the conjunctiva. =Complications= Secondary keratitis or uveitis may occur with scleritis. The most severe complications are associated with necrotizing scleritis. Pathophysiology Most of the time, scleritis is not caused by an infectious agent. Histopathological changes are that of a chronic granulomatous disorder, characterized by fibrinoid necrosis, infiltration by polymorphonuclear cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages. The granuloma is surrounded by multinucleated epitheloid giant cells and new vessels, some of which may show evidence of vasculitis.  Diagnosis  Scleritis is best detected by examining the sclera in daylight; retracting the lids helps determine the extent of involvement. Other aspects of the eye exam (i.e. visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, etc.) may be normal. Scleritis may be differentiated from episcleritis by using phenylephrine or neosynephrine eye drops, which causes blanching of the blood vessels in episcleritis, but not in scleritis. Ancillary tests CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasonographies can be helpful, but do not replace the physical examination. =Classification= Scleritis can be classified as anterior scleritis and posterior scleritis. Anterior scleritis is the most common variety, accounting for about 98% of the cases. It is of two types : Non-necrotising and necrotising. Non-necrotising scleritis is the most common, and is further classified into diffuse and nodular type based on morphology. Necrotising scleritis accounts for 13% of the cases. It can occur with or without inflammation.  Treatment  =Medical= In mild to moderate cases of scleritis, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as flurbiprofen, indomethacin or ibuprofen may be prescribed for pain relief. Systemic corticosteroids like prednisolone may be used if NSAIDs are inappropriate or scleritis is posterior or necrotizing. Periocular steroid injections may be used in non-necrotizing scleritis, but it is contraindicated in necrotizing disease. If disease control is inadequate with steroids alone, immunosuppressives (Eg: cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate) and/or immunomodulators may be considered for treatment. In infective scleritis, if infective agent is identified, topical or systemic antibiotics may be prescribed. =Surgical Intervention= Surgery may be indicated if scleral perforation or excessive scleral thinning is present. Bandage contact lens or corneal glue may be used to repair damaged corneal tissue in the eye and preserve the patient's vision. If not treated, scleritis can cause blindness. Epidemiology Scleritis is not a common disease, although the exact prevalence and incidence are unknown. It is somewhat more common in women, and is most common in the fourth to sixth decades of life.  References  *Rosenbaum JT. The Eye and rheumatic diseases.

In 1949 she won election as state representative for Louisville, and served three consecutive terms. Over the next two decades, Stovall was elected Kentucky State Treasurer twice and Secretary of State of Kentucky three times. She capped her career as the 47th Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky (1975–1979) in the administration of her fellow Democrat, Governor Julian Carroll. She was the first woman to hold the office. Stovall was known for her assertive style. Several times in her career, when she found herself in the position of acting governor, she was unafraid of exercising that power – she issued gubernatorial pardons, called the Kentucky General Assembly into session to consider bills, and most famously issued an executive injunction against the Assembly's attempt to repeal Kentucky's ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Throughout her career, Stovall was an ardent advocate of labor and women's rights.  Early life  Thelma Loyace Hawkins was born in Munfordville, Kentucky on April 1, 1919. Her parents, Samuel Dewey Hawkins and Addie Mae Goodman Hawkins, divorced when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and sister Edith to Louisville. She grew up around political activities: as a child she would hand out papers for her mother, who had become a precinct official in Louisville. The family lived an austere, working class life, a fact Stovall never resented: \\"I don't think it hurt to do without,\\" she said. At the age of 15, she started working for the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation to support her family during the Great Depression. She joined the Tobacco Workers International Union and became secretary of her local, TWIU 185. She kept that position for 11 years, and remained a stout supporter of labor unions throughout her later political career. While working at the tobacco company, she met L. Raymond Stovall, and the couple married in September 1936, when he was 18 and she was 17. She graduated from Louisville Girls' High School; studied law at LaSalle Extension University in Chicago, and attended summer school at the University of Kentucky and Eastern Kentucky University. Public office Stovall became Louisville's first female state representative: she won election to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1949 and was re-elected twice. She joined the Young Democrats of Kentucky and served as a national committee member (1952 to 1956), and then as the group's first woman president (1956 to 1958). When the popular Democratic politician Happy Chandler ran for Governor in 1955, he tried to persuade Stovall to be on his ticket as Secretary of State of Kentucky. After she took too long thinking about it, Chandler simply announced her candidacy on his own. With no ill will, Stovall went along with the plan, although she thought she would never win. Ultimately Stovall was elected Secretary of State three times, serving four-year terms beginning in 1956, 1964 and 1972. She also served two four- year terms as State Treasurer beginning in 1960 and 1968. In 1959, Stovall was secretary of state, the third-ranking office in Kentucky, when she discovered that the governor and lieutenant governor were both out of state. As the legal acting governor, she pardoned three prisoners, including a robber who had been given a life sentence for stealing $28.\\"Kentucky's Shrewd Lady,\\" Time Magazine, February 12, 1979. Retrieved May 16, 2010. By the early 1970s, she was a figure of some national stature: the Cincinnati Enquirer described her as \\"one of the most knowledgeable women in America regarding state government\\" and noted that she was in high demand for speaking engagements around the country. She also candidly discussed her plans for higher office.  Lieutenant Governor  In 1975, Stovall was the first woman nominated for Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky by either major political party. Stovall defeated the Republican nominee, Shirley W. Palmer-Ball, with 430,011 votes (54.6%) to Palmer-Ball's 357,744 votes (45.4%). As lieutenant governor, Stovall was not reluctant to invoke her powers as acting governor when Governor Julian Carroll left the state. During one of Carroll's absences, Stovall called the Kentucky General Assembly into special session to reduce taxation. Two bills were swiftly passed: one placed a statewide cap on property taxes, while the other removed a 5% state tax on utility bills.  Equal Rights Amendment  Her most famous intercession as acting governor came in March 1978 when, with Carroll out of the state, she vetoed the legislature's repeal of its ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. The repeal had come to her as a late attachment to another bill regarding state pensions (House Joint Resolution 20), and Stovall claimed a legal right to reject it on two counts: the Kentucky constitution did not permit bills dealing with more than one subject, and there was a Senate rule that prohibited the introduction of new bills in the final ten days of any legislative session. In an oral history interview in 1977, Stovall gave her plainspoken view of the ERA: \\"It's ridiculous after 200 years that women are still second class citizens. No – black men were allowed to vote fifty years before women could vote. As long there is still some statutes that say there are certain things that a woman can not do, we are still second class citizens.\\" After her veto the following year, she resolutely defended her action, declaring: \\"Every elective official is faced sooner or later with the prospect of acting for political expediency, acting from conscience and law, or avoiding the issue by not acting at all. When the people vote to elect their leaders, they expect them to act and act decisively.\\"  Later career  Stovall sought election as Governor of Kentucky in 1979 but lost in the Democratic primary to John Y. Brown, Jr., who went on to win the general election. Stovall won 47,633 votes, taking fifth place behind Brown's 165,188 votes; 139,713 for Harvey I. Sloane, the mayor of Louisville; 131,530 for former state representative Terry McBrayer; and 68,577 for 1st District Congressman Carroll Hubbard. Stovall did finish ahead of four minor candidates in the primary, but it would be her last race and the only loss of her career. Thelma Stovall in 1983 while Commissioner of Labor in the Cabinet for Governor John Y. Brown Jr. After the primary, Stovall announced her retirement from state politics. To celebrate her 30 years of public service, a large party was held in the Kentucky State Capitol on December 3, 1979. Congratulations were sent by President Jimmy Carter and the date was officially proclaimed by the state as \\"Thelma Stovall Day\\". Despite their former rivalry, Governor Brown appointed Stovall as the state's Commissioner of Labor in December 1982. In his announcement, Brown praised her as \\"the grande dame of the feminist movement and... the indisputable advocate of working people\\".  Death Stovall died in her sleep in Louisville at the age of 74. She was honored by being allowed to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda. She is interred at Louisville's Resthaven Cemetery. Honors Thelma Stovall Park is located along the Green River in her hometown of Munfordville. Stovall's portrait, painted by Louisville portrait painter Doris Leist, hangs in the Capitol and a plaque commemorating her achievements was placed there in 1982. A Kentucky newspaper wrote in praise for one of the state's most controversial politicians: :Say what you will about Thelma Stovall, you always knew where she stood.

The Iwellemmedan (Iwəlləmədǎn), also spelled Iullemmeden, Aulliminden, Ouilliminden, Lullemmeden, and Iwellemmeden, are one of the seven major Tuareg tribal or clan confederations (called \\"Drum groups\\"). Their communities are historically nomadic and intermixed with other ethnic groups. The Iwellemmeden inhabit a wide area ranging from east and north central Mali, through the Azawagh valley, into northwestern Niger and south into northern Nigeria. While once a single confederation of dozens of Tuareg clans, subject peoples, and allied groups, since the 18th century they have been divided into Kel Ataram (west) and Kel Dinnik (east) confederations. Following colonial rule and independence, the Iwellemmedan homelands cross the Mali/Niger border, and their traditional seasonal migration routes have spread Iwellemmedan communities into Burkina Faso and Nigeria as well.Hélène Claudot-Hawad. Iwellemmeden Kel Ataram (Touaregs) in Encyclopédie Berbère XXV (2003) article 176b : 3822-3828. They speak the Tawellemmet variant of the Tamasheq language,Hsain Ilahiane. Historical dictionary of the Berbers (Imazighen). Volume 5 of Historical dictionaries of people and cultures. Rowman & Littlefield, 2006. . pp.11, 45. although some current or historical sub-clans speak other Tamasheq variants as well as Songhai languages and Arabic dialects. Divisions Areas where significant numbers of Tuaregs live The origins of the division into Kel Ataram (\\"people of the west\\") and Kel Dinnik (\\"people of the east\\") goes back to at least 1800, and perhaps a century earlier. The confederation remained divided under colonial rule, with the Nigerien arm to the east given its own official \\"chief\\", while after 1916, the western arm was re-divided among a number of official French chosen chieftainships. The division of eastern and western Iwellemmedan remains in the post colonial period. The western arm of the Iwellemmedan are the Kel Ataram centered on the Malian town of Ménaka. Component \\"free\\" clans (mostly \\"maraboutic\\" or \\"Imajeghen\\" tribes which inherit local religious leadership) include the Tahabanaten and Ighatafan.Alessandra Giuffrida. \\"Clerics, Rebels and Refugees: Mobility Strategies and Networks among the Kel Antessar\\", Journal of North African Studies. Volume 10, Number 3, September 2005. The major eastern arm of the confederation is the Kel Dinnik (var. Kel Dinnig), sometimes named the \\"Ouilliminden Kel Dinnik\\", and centered in the Azawagh, near Tchin-Tabaraden and Tahoua. p. 184 Their major \\"free\\"/\\"Imajeghen\\" components include the Irreulen, Lisawan, Tiggirmat, Tellemidez, and Ikhekheren. The free/noble Kel Nan clan is the traditional source of the Amenokal, the paramount confederation leader chosen by clan heads.Kélétigui Abdourahmane Mariko. Les Touaregs Ouelleminden. Karthala, Paris, 1984. Both groups are traditionally pastoralists, whose migration patterns take them north into the Sahara during the brief rainy season, and south as far as Nigeria and Burkina Faso during the dry season. Like all Tuareg groups, they are formed from a number of highly stratified castes, who interweave loyalty from a number of clans, some of whom are limited to specific castes. Ruling caste clans lead the large confederations, and engage in seasonal migration, herding, trade, war, and religious duties. Lower castes, and clans made up of subject groups of free clans are more likely sedentary and not part of confederations, even if their traditional suzerains are members of a confederation such as the Iwellemmedan. In addition, large confederations may include allied non-Tuaregs, such as local Arabic speaking tribes. History Tuareg groups moved south into what is now Mali and Niger sometime around the 11th century CE, and the Iwellemmedan were established south and east of the Adar Ifoghas by the 17th century CE. Contesting oral histories agree that the Iwellemmedan came into conflict with the Kel Taddemekat confederation, but disagree whether the Iwellemmedan were pushed out of the Adar Ifoghas by their foes or conquered Kel Taddemekat territory south and west of the massif. Regardless, by the mid-15th century CE, the Iwellemmedan controlled an area from Lake Faguibine and north of Timbuktu east through all of what is now the Gao Region of Mali, into the Nigerien Azawagh all the way to the edge of the Aïr Massif. Engaged in long struggle with the inheritors of the 15th century CE Moroccan conquest of the Songhai Empire, the Iwellemmedan Kel Ataram clans eventually imposed indirect rule over Timbuktu, along with all of the Niger River valley from the Niger inland delta to what ito the town of Say, Niger. The Kel Ataram were only driven from Timbuktu in 1826 by the rise of the Fula Macina Empire, but retained much of the area to its north. At the moment of colonial expansion by the French into their territory at the end of the 19th century, the Iwellemmedan were the dominant Tuareg confederation in all western Niger and eastern Mali, down to the bend of the Niger River, where they held sway of many of the Songhay settlements. Following their defeat by the French after their seizure of Timbuktu in 1894, the Kel Ataram Amenokal pledged non-aggression with the French in 1896, and eventual peace in 1903. At this same time, the French concentrated on their conflict with the Kel Ifoghas to the north. Within a decade, roles were reversed, when the Ifoghas helped to put down the 1914-1916 rising of the Iwellemmedan and allied clans under their Amenokal Fihirun. Their resistance to French conquest cost them dearly, with the deaths of much of their warrior class, and the eventual favoriting of the Kidal based Kel Ifoghas by the colonial power. Several elements were eventually broken from the Iwellemmedan Kel Ataram by the French, further weakening the confederation. The eastern Iwellemmedan Tuaregs' traditional homeland is in Niger. However, severe droughts in 1972 and 1982 forced the nomadic Iwellemmedan to migrate south to Nigeria in search of grazing areas for their animal herds. Many Aulliminden eventually moved closer to populated areas. These Tuaregs settled in the outskirts of cities in northern Nigeria, and many never returned to their homeland. In the 1970s, large numbers of Tuareg refugees, many of them Iwellemmedan, settled in the refugee camps of southern Niger, most prominently Lazert, on the northeastern edge of Niamey. Over time this has become a permanent neighborhood within the Nigerien capital.

He went on to become an expert on hamstring injuries, due to his experiences with Tony Adams, and advised Birmingham City's physio's on the treatment of often-injured midfielder David Dunn. During the 2007 Football League Cup Final on 25 February 2007, Lewin was close to the incident where Chelsea skipper John Terry was hit in the face by Abou Diaby's foot during a corner in the Arsenal penalty area. Terry swallowed his tongue and Lewin was the first physio to assist Terry, possibly saving his life. Lewin was credited by former Arsenal striker Eduardo da Silva with saving his foot and career after a broken leg suffered on 23 February 2008. Lewin was first-team physio at Arsenal for 22 years, and also from 1996 onwards with the England national team as well. His time at Arsenal came to an end when he was appointed by the Football Association to be England's Head of Physiotherapy from 1 August 2008. Following Lewin's switch to the full-time England job, his cousin Colin Lewin took over at Arsenal. During England's first game of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, against Italy, Lewin was stretchered off. During the celebrations for the equalising goal by Daniel Sturridge, Lewin jumped up and slipped on some synthetic turf, and was later diagnosed with a dislocation to his left ankle and from that dislocation he fractured the fibula in two places, fractured the back of the tibia and also ruptured the ligaments. On 20 March 2017, Lewin rejoined Arsenal as physiotherapist for the women's team. On 30 May 2017, Lewin was appointed as the Head of Medical Services at West Ham United. He left the club following the appointment for Manuel Pellegrini as manager at the end of the 2017–18 season. Personal life Gary Lewin is an ambassador of the Brain & Spine Foundation, the only UK wide charity providing medical information and emotional support on the full range of neurological conditions.

The mailmen had to walk and travel by boat because there was no road connecting the 68-mile route from Palm Beach to Miami. Approximately 28 miles of the one way trip was by rowing different boats, and the rest by walking along the firmer sand along the beach. The route was a Star Route, with the carriers contracting with the Post Office. The route was originally called the \\"barefoot route\\" and the carriers were called \\"beach walkists\\" or \\"beach walkers\\". It was not until around 1940 that the term \\"barefoot mailman\\" came into use. Barefoot route In the early 1880s the communities around Lake Worth were at the end of the mail routes. The mail was carried by a series of Star routes from Titusville to Palm Beach. There was no mail delivery south of Palm Beach.Pierce: 209 To the south, Miami and the communities around Biscayne Bay received mail by a weekly schooner from Key West. A Star route to carry mail between Lake Worth and Biscayne Bay was established in 1885. The route involved a round trip of 136 miles from Palm Beach to Miami and back, and took six days. The carrier would leave Palm Beach on Monday morning, traveling by boat to the southern end of the Lake Worth Lagoon. He would then cross over to the beach and walk down to the Orange Grove House of Refuge in what is now Delray Beach, where he would spend the night. The next day (Tuesday) he would continue walking down the beach to the Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge, where he would spend that night. On Wednesday the carrier traveled by boat down the New River to its inlet, and then would walk down the beach to Baker's Haulover at the north end of Biscayne Bay. Finally, he would travel down Biscayne Bay by boat to Miami. On Thursday he would start the return trip, arriving in Palm Beach on Saturday.Pierce: 194–195 By an alternate account, the route to Miami originally started from Jupiter, but was shortened in 1887, when a new Star route was established from Jupiter to Hypoluxo (south of Palm Beach), with the shortened route running from Hypoluxo to Miami for the rest of its existence.Pierce: 217 This route was called the \\"barefoot route\\" because the carriers walked barefoot on the beach.Pierce: 194 The mail carriers, and others who had learned the method of walking long distances on a sloping beach without tiring, were called \\"beach walkists\\"Lynfield: 11 or \\"beach walkers\\".Pierce: 204 The barefoot route continued until 1892 when a rock road was completed from Lantana to Lemon City, and the mail contract from the Lake Worth area was taken over by Guy Metcalf.Pierce: 234 The first known use of \\"barefoot mailman\\" was in 1939, when Charles William Pierce, who had been one of the carriers on the barefoot route, used the term in correspondence with Stevan Dohanos, who was painting murals of James Edward Hamilton, another carrier, for the West Palm Beach post office. The term first appeared in print in The Palm Beach Post in 1940.Lynfield: 9–10 Another source states that (in 1869) the mail is carried along the coast from St. Augustine to Jupiter Inlet in boats, from there to Miami by foot, and then to Key West by schooner. Barefoot mailmen The first barefoot mailman was Edwin Ruthven Bradley, a retired Chicago newsman and Lake Worth resident, who won the postal contract in 1885 with a bid of $600 per year. He and his son, Louie, took turns carrying the mail once a week for about two years.Pierce: 195 His second son, Guy Bradley, would later become famous after his murder while serving as an early game warden protecting the egrets being poached for tail feathers. The third, and most famous, of the barefoot mailmen was James E. \\"Ed\\" Hamilton, who had come to Hypoluxo from Cadiz, Kentucky (Trigg County) in 1885. Hamilton became the barefoot route contractor when E. R. Bradley quit in 1887. Hamilton disappeared while walking the barefoot route soon after October 10, 1887. Hamilton was not feeling well when he passed through Hypoluxo on October 10. When Hamilton had not returned to Lake Worth at the end of the week, a search was started. Hamilton's possessions, including all of his clothes, were found on the north bank of the Hillsboro Inlet. He had never arrived at the Fort Lauderdale House of Refuge, south of the inlet. The boat that Hamilton used to cross the inlet was missing. He was presumed to have drowned or been taken by a shark or alligator while trying to swim across the inlet to retrieve his boat from the far side. His body was never recovered.Pierce: 195, 213–215 A \\"stranger from the north\\", identified by House of Refuge keeper Charles Coman, was suspected of having taken Hamilton's boat across the inlet and leaving it on the south side. The stranger was later charged with tampering with government property (Hamilton's row boat). Tried in Federal Court in Jacksonville, the \\"stranger\\" was acquitted and therefore his name was never entered in the court records. After Hamilton's disappearance, Andrew Garnett, who had previously been the postmaster at Hypoluxo, successfully bid for the barefoot route contract. Charles William Pierce substituted for Garnett when he could not travel the route.Pierce: 201, 217 Other men who have been reported as carriers on the barefoot route included George Charter, Bob Douthit, Dan Kelly, Dan McCarley, Frederick Matthaus, Otto Matthaus, Edward \\"Ned\\" Peat, George Sears and a man known only as Stafford.

It was an intermediate compound in the development of the successful anti-ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet). Development of metiamide from burimamide After discovering that burimamide is largely inactive at physiological pH, due to the presence of its electron-donating side chain, the following steps were undertaken to stabilize burimamide: * addition of a sulfide group close to the imidazole ring, giving thiaburimamide * addition of methyl group to the 4-position on the imidazole ring to favor the tautomer of thiaburimamide which binds better to the H2 receptor These changes increased the bioavailability metiamide so that it is ten times more potent than burimamide in inhibiting histamine-stimulated release of gastric acid. The clinical trials that began in 1973 demonstrated the ability of metiamide to provide symptomatic relief for ulcerous patients by increasing healing rate of peptic ulcers. However, during these trials, an unacceptable number of patients dosed with metiamide developed agranulocytosis (decreased white blood cell count). Modification of metiamide to cimetidine It was determined that the thiourea group was the cause of the agranulocytosis. Therefore, replacement of the thiocarbonyl in the thiourea group was suggested: * with urea or guanidine resulted in a compound with much less activity (only 5% of the potency of metiamide) * however, the NH form (the guanidine analog of metiamide) did not show agonistic effects * to prevent the guanidine group being protonated at physiological pH, electron-withdrawing groups were added * adding a nitrile or nitro group prevented the guanidine group from being protonated and did not cause agranulocytosis The nitro and cyano groups are sufficiently electronegative to reduce the pKa of the neighboring nitrogens to the same acidity of the thiourea group, hence preserving the activity of the drug in a physiological environment. Synthesis Reacting ethyl 2-chloroacetoacetate (1) with 2 molar equivalents of formamide (2) gives 4-carboethoxy-5-methylimidazole (3). Reduction of the carboxylic ester (3) with sodium in liquid ammonia via Birch reduction gives the corresponding alcohol (4). Reaction of that with cysteamine (mercaptoethylamine), as its hydrochloride, leads to intermediate 5. In the strongly acid medium, the amine is completely protonated; this allows the thiol to express its nucleophilicity without competition and the acid also activates the alcoholic function toward displacement. Finally, condensation of the amine with methyl isothiocyanate gives metiamide (6).

In 1979, it received a major upgrade and became the first airborne radar to incorporate a software programmable signal processor (PSP), and the PSP allowed the system to be modified to accommodate new modes and weapons through software reprogramming rather than by hardware retrofit. The APG-63 with PSP is one of the most important features that distinguishes earlier F-15 A/Bs from the F-15 C/Ds fitted with PSP, and with the exception of the final 43 (which are equipped with APG-70), all F-15 C/Ds are equipped with APG-63 with PSP. The APG-63 series is no longer in production but remains in service. Almost 1,000 APG-63s had been delivered when production ended in 1986. About 700 are still operational in F-15As, Bs, and early model Cs and Ds operated by the U.S. Air Force, Air National Guard, and the air forces of Israel, Japan, and Saudi Arabia. They are also fitted to the Lockheed P-3 Orion aircraft of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Office of Air and Marine. AN/APG-63(V)1 The APG-63(V)1 radar is a 1990s reliability/maintainability hardware redesign which also provided significant mode growth opportunities. It was designed to replace outmoded APG-63 radars installed in F-15C/D aircraft models, providing improved performance and a tenfold increase in reliability. The new radar is able to track 14 targets simultaneously while being able to simultaneously attack 6 of those. Raytheon delivered 180 APG-63(V)1 radar systems to the U.S. Air Force (4 of which have since been lost to crashes), and is on contract to deliver an additional 40 radars to the Republic of Korea Air Force for the F-15K Slam Eagle. AN/APG-63(V)2 The APG-63(V)2 Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar has been retrofitted to 18 U.S. Air Force F-15C aircraft. This upgrade includes most of the new hardware from the APG-63(V)1, but adds an AESA to provide increased pilot situational awareness. The AESA radar has an exceptionally agile beam, providing nearly instantaneous track updates and enhanced multi-target tracking capability. The APG-63(V)2 is compatible with current F-15C weapon loads and enables pilots to take full advantage of the AIM-120 AMRAAM's capabilities, simultaneously initiating guidance for multiple missiles to several targets widely spaced in azimuth, elevation, or range. AN/APG-63(V)3 AN/APG-63(V)3 The APG-63(V)3 radar is a more modern variant of the APG-63(V)2, applying the same AESA technology utilized in Raytheon's APG-79. The (V)3 is currently being retrofitted into F-15C/D and deployed in Singapore's new F-15SG aircraft and Saudi Arabia's new F-15SA aircraft. Raytheon delivered the first prototype APG-63(V)3 system in June 2006.\\"Raytheon Delivers Next-Generation F-15 AESA Radar to Boeing Ahead of Schedule\\". Raytheon, 7 August 2006.

It did not enter service.APG-64 AN/APG-70 The APG-70 was a 1980s redesign of the APG-63 for greater reliability and easier maintenance.APG-70 Additionally, gate array technology enabled the APG-70 to incorporate new modes with enhanced operational capabilities. To reduce production costs, many of the upgraded radar's modules are common with the F/A-18's APG-73 radar, while the computers / processors share an 85% commonality with that of the F-14's APG-71 radar. APG-70 systems were originally installed on later model F-15C/D aircraft, but have since been replaced on those aircraft by the APG-63(V)1. As with the basic APG-63, the APG-70 is no longer in production; but were in service on the F-15E Strike Eagle, the Israeli F-15I and the Saudi F-15S. Also, as with APG-63, APG-70 also comes in two versions, both have identical air-to-air capabilities, but slightly different air-to-ground capabilities: APG-70 on F-15Is and F-15Ss exported to foreign customers has lower performance in that the resolution of Doppler Beam Sharpening (DBS) / Mapping / Synthetic Aparture Radar (SAR) modes for the APG-70 on F-15E of USAF were at least three times better than that of the APG-70 on F-15I and F-15S.

Biography =Youth and education= Konstantin was born in Moscow to a merchant family officially registered as \\"peasants of Vladimir Gubernia\\". His father, Aleksey Mikhailovich Korovin, earned a university degree and was more interested in arts and music than in the family business established by Konstantin's grandfather. Konstantin's older brother Sergei Korovin was a notable realist painter. Konstantin's relative Illarion Pryanishnikov was also a prominent painter of the time and a teacher at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. In 1875 Korovin entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, where he studied with Vasily Perov and Alexei Savrasov. His brother Sergei was already a student at the school. During their student years, the Korovins became friends with fellow students Valentin Serov and Isaac Levitan; Konstantin maintained these friendships throughout his life. In 1881–1882, Korovin spent a year at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, but returned disappointed to the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He studied at the school under his new teacher Vasily Polenov until 1886. In 1885 Korovin traveled to Paris and Spain. \\"Paris was a shock for me … Impressionists… in them I found everything I was scolded for back home in Moscow\\", he later wrote. =Early works= Korovin. On the Balcony, Spanish Women Leonora and Ampara, 1897–1898 Polenov introduced Korovin to Savva Mamontov's Abramtsevo Circle: Viktor Vasnetsov, Apollinary Vasnetsov, Ilya Repin, Mark Antokolsky and others. The group's love for stylized Russian themes is reflected in Korovin's picture A Northern Idyll. In 1885 Korovin worked for Mamontov's opera house, designing the stage decor for Giuseppe Verdi's Aida, Léo Delibes' Lakmé and Georges Bizet's Carmen. In 1888 Korovin traveled with Mamontov to Italy and Spain, where he produced the painting On the Balcony, Spanish Women Leonora and Ampara. Konstantin traveled within Russia, the Caucasus and Central Asia and exhibited with the Peredvizhniki. He painted in the Impressionist, and later in the Art Nouveau, styles. In the 1890s Korovin became a member of the Mir iskusstva art group. Korovin's subsequent works were strongly influenced by his travels to the north. In 1888 he was captivated by the stern northern landscapes seen in The Coast of Norway and the Northern Sea. His second trip to the north, with Valentin Serov in 1894, coincided with the construction of the Northern Railway. Korovin painted a large number of landscapes: Norwegian Port, St. Triphon's Brook in Pechenga, Hammerfest: Aurora Borealis, The Coast at Murmansk and others. The paintings are built on a delicate web of shades of grey. The etude style of these works was typical for Korovin's art of the 1890s. Using material from his trip, Korovin designed the Far North pavilion at the 1896 All Russia Exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod. He painted ten big canvasses for the pavilion as well, depicting various aspects of life in the northern and Arctic regions. After the closure of the Exhibition, the canvasses were eventually placed in the Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal in Moscow. In the 1960s, they were restored and transferred to the Tretyakov Gallery. In 1900 Korovin designed the Central Asia section of the Russian Empire pavilion at the Paris World Fair and was awarded the Legion of Honour by the French government. St. Triphon's Brook in Pechenga, 1894 In the beginning of the 20th century, Korovin focused his attention on the theater. He moved from Mamontov's opera to the Mariinsky Theatre in St.Petersburg. Departing from traditional stage decor, which only indicated the place of action, Korovin produced a mood decor conveying the general emotions of the performance. Korovin designed sets for Konstantin Stanislavsky's dramatic productions, as well as Mariinsky's operas and ballets. He did the stage design for such Mariinsky productions as Faust (1899), The Little Humpbacked Horse (1901), and Sadko (1906) that became famous for their expressiveness. In 1905 Korovin became an Academician of Painting and in 1909–1913 a professor at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. One of the artist's favourite themes was Paris. He painted A Paris Cafe (1890s), Cafe de la Paix (1905), La Place de la Bastille (1906), Paris at Night, Le Boulevard Italien (1908), Night Carnival (1901), Paris in the Evening (1907), and others. During World War I Korovin worked as a camouflage consultant at the headquarters of one of the Russian armies and was often seen on the front lines. After the October Revolution Korovin continued to work in the theater, designing stages for Richard Wagner's Die Walküre and Siegfried, as well as Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker (1918–1920). In 1923 Korovin moved to Paris on the advice of Commissar of Education Anatoly Lunacharsky to cure his heart condition and help his handicapped son. There was supposed to be a large exhibition of Korovin's works, but the works were stolen and Korovin was left penniless. For years, he produced the numerous Russian Winters and Paris Boulevards just to make ends meet. In the last years of his life he produced stage designs for many of the major theatres of Europe, America, Asia and Australia, the most famous of which is his scenery for the Turin Opera House's production of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's The Golden Cockerel. Korovin died in Paris on 11 September 1939. He was buried in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery, in the southern suburbs of Paris. Konstantin's son Alexey Korovin (1897–1950) was a notable Russian-French painter. Because of an accident during his childhood he had both feet amputated. Alexey committed suicide in 1950.

Situated on the North bank of the River Tyne, it is built rising up the valley from the river. It is situated approximately from the city centre, east of Hexham and south south west of Morpeth. In the 2001 census, the population was given as 9,301, increasing to 9,536 at the 2011 Census. Newburn is in the Newcastle upon Tyne district of Tyne and Wear and is part of the parliamentary constituency of Newcastle upon Tyne North. Historically, the area was larger than Newcastle upon Tyne as it was the most eastern fordable point of the River Tyne. The area has Roman remains, and a Norman church dating from 1070 AD. In 1640, the Battle of Newburn took place. The area grew with the Industrial Revolution with the discovery of coal, and in 1822 Spencer's Steelworks was opened, which grew to a size which led the area to be known colloquially as New Sheffield, after the town famed for its steel making prowess. The town's steelworks fell into decline after the First World War, and the area is now home to a country park and various leisure facilities. History Though some claim the area's name comes from the Old English for \\"New Fort or Castle\\" (burh or burg being the Old English for fort or castle), the name is more commonly thought to have come from the Dewley or New Burn, which runs through the area. This is somewhat substantiated by the fact that the settlement was recorded as Neuburna in 1121, rather than Neuburh. Newburn was originally considered to have pre-eminence over Newcastle, as Newburn was the first point up from the mouth of the river that was fordable. The Romans marked this ford with a framework of stones, and may have built a fort to command the crossing. The area has other Roman connections, with the route of Hadrian's Wall cutting across its northern half, before running toward Throckley. From the eighth century, Newburn was a royal vill or town, and Newcastle didn't become a more important settlement until Plantagenet times. Between 1332 and 1974 the Percy family were associated with Newburn, and Hugh Percy was the last to inherit Newburn Manor House, which was built in the 16th century. Also in the area at this time was Newburn Hall, which was built in the 15th century. A monument commemorating the Battle of Newburn at Newburn Country Park On 28 August 1640, the Battle of Newburn took place. The Scottish Covenanters, led by Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, planted guns at Newburn to protect them while fording the river, after which they defeated the English on the south side of the river at Stellahaugh, and subsequently occupied Newcastle upon Tyne. The Scottish claim this occupation to have been the prologue to the English Civil War. The name of Scotswood, one of the manufacturing areas between Newburn and the city centre, commemorates one of their positions. Newburn and nearby Lemington had always been considered among the greenest areas of Newcastle, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the majority of vegetables supplied to local markets came from Newburn and Hexham. Prior to the early 19th century, the majority of employment in the Newburn area was for fishermen, keelmen and miners. The district has many associations with the early development of the railway. The famous engineer George Stephenson, who was born in Wylam a few miles to the west of Newburn, was twice married in Newburn Church, though he is buried in Chesterfield in Derbyshire, and worked in the Water Row pit in Newburn. The area is also the birthplace of an earlier steam pioneer William Hedley, whose first locomotive Puffing Billy was built in 1812, two years prior to his rival's first locomotive Blücher. A gravestone in Newburn churchyard marks his burial in 1843. The future railway engineers Joseph and George Armstrong both lived in the village from 1824, and found their first employment at nearby Walbottle Colliery. In 1855, William Whellan's History, Topography, and Directory of Northumberland described the banks of the Tyne at this point having extensive iron works, coal staithes, brickyards, chemical works and other manufactories. In 1822 John Spencer established Newburn Steelworks in a small mill for grinding files, on the Dewley Burn in the north of Newburn. Over the course of next hundred or so years his mill grew to take over much of Newburn as the demand for steel boomed with the growth of railways and other industries. By the late 19th century, the works had spread to the east of the area along the banks of the Tyne to such an extent Newburn Hall was \\"embedded\\" in them. In 1916 the mill had a weekly output of 1,500 tons. Steel plates for the liner Mauretania were made by Spencers. However the industry was hit hard by the depression after the First World War and the steel works closed between 1924 and 1926, despite a large effort to raise £75,000 needed to save the works. The works' large number of high chimneys were demolished in 1933. A number of buildings connected with the works still stand today, although with new uses, including two large sheds which are now owned by H. Pringle, used as a large indoor scrapyard, and offices which are now used by the Multi-Lab company. In the 1850s, the Newburn Brickworks was built as part of the North Wallbottle and Blucher Colliery Company. The works were situated near Spencer's early mill in the north of Newburn. It was connected to the colliery at Blucher by a small railway, which continued onto the staithes at Lemington. Newburn bricks were mainly used for industrial buildings such as sewers, tunnels and arches. The works closed in 1965 and demolished in 1979 to make way for a council-run recycling centre. Its sister plant, Throckley Brick Works, still operates. In the early twentieth century, around 4,000 people lived in the area. A working men's club was built, comprising a library, reading rooms and lecture rooms for community meetings. By 1925 the building was used as a dole office, and in 1990 adapted for use as a residential care home. In 1922, Newburn U.D.C. High Street Fire Station was built. The building still stands today, but the Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service moved to West Denton in December 1980. Governance In 1894, Newburn Urban District Council was formed. This governed Newburn, along with other suburbs to the west of Newcastle. In 1911, the district council offices were officially opened. On 1 April 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, it became part of the metropolitan borough of Newcastle upon Tyne in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The area is now part of the parliamentary constituency of Newcastle upon Tyne North. Geography Demography According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the population of the Newburn ward was 9,301, making up 3.6% of the population of the Newcastle upon Tyne area. Economy Prior to its closure, Spencer's Steel Works was a major local employer. Newburn Industrial Park, and the Newburn Riverside business park are now two of the key local employers. Culture and Community In the late nineteenth century there was a funfair, known as Newburn Hoppings, set up near the area. This was similar to The Hoppings on Newcastle's Town Moor. There was a wooden picturedrome on Westmacott Street in the early twentieth century. On 18 October 1911, the Imperial Cinema on Station Road opened. Designed by Thomas Eltringham of Throckley colliery, it originally had seating for 550. A 131-seat gallery was added later. By 1919, the cinema was doing so well, two shows a night could not satisfy demand. However, with the opening of the Lyric Cinema in Throckley in 1935, the cinema's audience was divided. Despite this the cinema was refurbished and given a modern façade. But with the impact of television, the Imperial Cinema was one of many small picture houses to close down, shutting in 1961. It was used as a bingo hall for a time, but is now owned by Industrial Engravers, producing signs, vehicle liveries and banners. Landmarks In 1920, the areas war memorial was unveiled. The Battle of the Somme in 1916 accounts for many of the names on the statue's honour roll. The independent micro brewery The Big Lamp is attached to The Keelman public house which serves the brewery's own cask ale. Originally constructed in 1855 as a pumping station, it lay derelict for a number of years but was protected from demolition by becoming a grade II* listed building, renovated in 1996 and converted into a brewery and public house. The Keelman stands at the entrance to the Tyne Riverside Country Park and is approximately east from the neighbouring village of Wylam. The Boat House pub stands near Newburn Bridge on Water Row. On it is marked the flood levels of 1771, 1815, 1832 and 1850. Transport Newburn Bridge was built in 1893 In 1748, the Wylam wagonway opened between Wylam and Lemington, passing through Newburn in doing so. This used horse-drawn carts to take coal from Wylam colliery to the staithes at Lemington. This was upgraded to a five-foot gauge line, and then to a standard gauge line in 1862. Newburn was served by Newburn railway station on the Scotswood, Newburn & Wylam Railway (SN&WR;) from 12 July 1875. This railway followed in part the old wagonway. In 1895, the Newburn Hotel was built by F.M. Laing. Located next to the station, the Hotel provided accommodation and stabling facilities for travelers. In 1927 it was acquired by Robert Deuchar. On 15 September 1958 the SN&WR; was closed to passengers, preceding the Beeching Axe. The station was finally closed to goods trains on 26 April 1965. The railway line was closed in 1968. The route of the wagonway can still be followed today in the form of a bridleway leading to the Tyne Riverside Country Park, developed in the 1980s. In the late nineteenth century, the Tyne Improvement Commission arranged for dredging and other works to improve the navigability of the River Tyne. For Newburn, it made the town not only easier to reach by boat, but necessitated the building of a river crossing, and so in 1893 Newburn Bridge was built. It was originally operated as a toll bridge, but was only freed of its tolls on 2 September 1947, making it the last bridge on the Tyne to do so. In 1914, the Newcastle tramway network was extended to Throckley through Newburn. By then Newburn was a thriving community because of the expansion of Newcastle and the improvement in transport links. In 1946, the tram line to Throckley was replaced by a bus service. Education Newburn Library Newburn Library was built in the 1960s. However, it has bad accessibility and so there are plans to build a new library near Newburn's community centre. The new library is expected to incorporate a doctor's surgery and pharmacy, costing £24 million, with a planned opening of 2012. Newburn Hall Motor Museum is situated in the north of Newburn. The museum is housed in buildings originally built in 1924 as a drill hall for the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers. It became derelict in 1979 but was renovated by car enthusiasts and opened in 1981 to house vintage cars and motorcycles. Religious sites St Michael and All Angel's church in April 2010 St Michael and All Angel's church was built in a commanding position above the area on the site of an earlier wooden built church, which was burned down in 1067. Osulf II of Bamburgh attacked Copsi, an appointee of William the Conqueror, setting the church alight and slaying Copsi when he emerged from its door. The current church was built over the course of 30 years, beginning in 1070. Parts of Hadrian's Wall were used in its construction. The church was damaged in another fire in 2006, but the current tower has stood since 1100. In the early twentieth century, the Newburn Wesleyan Church was built. This has since been demolished. Sport Since the early twentieth century, football has been an overwhelming obsession of the north east working man and almost every village had football team. During World War I, there was a women's team from Spencer's Steelworks played in the league. Newburn A.F.C. played at various times through the twentieth century. Newburn won the Northern Football Alliance League Championship on several occasions; 1910–11, 1911–12, 1946–47, 1951–52, and 1961–62. They also won the Premier Division Championship Runners-up Trophy in 1960–61. They were runners-up in the Northern Alliance Challenge Cup in 1951–52, 1952–53 and 1955–56, where they played the Newcastle United A team. They won the Challenge Cup in 1956–57. The team folded in the 1950s, but Bill Humble restarted the team in 1961 and ran it through the 1960s. Newburn Leisure Centre was built on the site of the club's ground in the 1980s. The land was reclaimed in 1980 as part of the Tyne Riverside Country Park. The first of the centre's two stages was completed in 1985, comprising changing rooms, management and staff facilities, a function room and car parking. The second phase was completed in 1989, with the completion of the sports hall, storage and ancillary facilities. The centre was formally opened in 1987 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. The Centre houses Newburn Judo Club, which has produced a number of junior medalists, and is the British Judo Association's centre of excellence for the northern area. The centre also houses a climbing wall, gym and day care, and provides facilities for archery, badminton and football, amongst other sports. A number of rowing clubs also operate on the River Tyne at Newburn, including Durham University Boat Club, Tyne United Rowing Club, Tyne Rowing Club and Newcastle University Boat Club.

Marie, Michigan. The station airs a gold-based Soft Adult Contemporary format during daytime hours, featuring music from the 1960s through the 2000s, and features paranormal talk programming in late night timeslots. WSOO has been owned and operated by Sovereign Communications since 2003, and is part of Sovereign's 7-station cluster in the Sault Ste. Marie and Newberry market (see Infobox). Broadcasting since June 25, 1940, WSOO is the first radio station to broadcast in the Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan radio market, and was only preceded in the region by the now-closed Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario AM station CFYN (formerly CJIC.) The station was launched and owned by the Hiawathaland Broadcasting Company, who later shifted the station to a middle of the road format in the late 1960s, prior to selling the station to Patterson Communications (later the Miami County Broadcasting Company) in 1971, as owned by Richard E. Hunt, who also owned WCBY AM & FM in Cheboygan and WPTW AM & FM in his hometown of Piqua, Ohio. WSOO was purchased by Fabiano-Strickler Communications in 1981, who shifted to its current adult contemporary/talk format in 1989. The station was ultimately purchased by current owners Sovereign Communications in 2003. Live sports coverage on WSOO includes Detroit Red Wings, Detroit Tigers, and Sault High Blue Devils games, as well as the regional high school sports talk show Coach's Corner, and annual coverage of the International 500 snowmobile race in Sault Ste.

At the time, only seven women served in the Parliament of Zambia out of 150 seats, and only three women served on the Central Committee, the equivalent of today's Presidential Cabinet. The official motto of ZNWL is \\"WIZER\\" which stands for \\"Women in Zambia for Equality Representation\\".  Women's organization history The First Women's Rights Conference in Zambia took place in 1970, establishing The Women's League. The League had their own constitution and an Presidentially elected executive secretary who became an automatic member of the Central Committee of United National Independence Party. The Central Committee representative was responsible for the representation of all women's affairs in the Government. The Women's League promoted a return to traditionalism and an expectation that League members would help men achieve political power, which caused some women to protest such ideas. The Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) emerged as another political party with a women's branch. The formation of the MMD encouraged many Zambian women to enter politics and seek equality. MMD appealed to professional women to advocate for gender equality and societal transformation.  Formation ZNWL was founded on 20 July 1991 in Lusaka at the Young Women's Christian Association Centre (YMCA) by 100 women. The NWLG's goals include promoting the equal participation of women in the political decision-making process, promoting a culture of gender equality and respect for the human rights of women through changes in attitudes, language, procedure and laws, and having more women politicians through affirmative action. Unlike MMD or The Women's League, ZNWL was non-governmental. ZNWL lobbied for political advancement of women and supported women running in local elections. ZNWL was not endorsed by the UNIP or MMD, as it was seen as the opposition. By 1995, there were 2,000 members.  Impact Since its inception, the NWLG has become one of the leading forces for women's rights in Zambia, and has been formally recognized by the government as the lead NGO for these issues. ZNWL is credited with being a major contributor in Zambia's democracy as it encouraged women to contest multi-party elections. The organization has been active in a number of international workshops, and has been duplicated in countries like South Africa and Botswana. In 2014, the United States Embassy gave a $25,000 grant to develop the Full Participation Fund (FPF). The FPF raised awareness about women in politics and encouraged dialogue between FPF participants and members of Parliament. The women who participated also received trainings on how to address issues affecting women and educational programs. In 2016, President Edgar Lungu appointed eight women into his Cabinet, which was praised by ZNWL Executive Director Juliet Chibuta. In 2017, the Zambia Accountability Programme (ZAP) partnered with ZNWL to produce a documentary called Mothering Zambia which highlighted the work both organizations were doing to address the problem of the lack of women's participation in politics.

In 1883, that government instituted the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Act,Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Act 1883 (SA) which resulted in a £959,300 contract being awarded to C. & E. Millar of Melbourne. The line reached Pine Creek in 1888 and officially opened on 30 September 1889 as the northernmost outpost of the South Australian Railways.\\"The Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway\\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin February/March 1968 pp25-48; 63-71 Singhalese and Indian gangs did the grubbing and earthwork and 3,000 Chinese labourers laid more than a kilometre of track per day. A total of 310 bridges and flood openings were built.A detailed interactive map is here. Transfer to the Commonwealth Government As a consequence of Federation, the Commonwealth (or federal) government took ownership of the railway in 1911, having undertaken to connect Darwin with Adelaide by rail – but, crucially, without the completion date being specified. Since the federal government did not yet have its own railways department, the railway was leased back to the South Australian Government and worked as part of the South Australian railway system. World War I intervened, although in 1917 the line was extended 90 km (56 mi) to the northern bank of the Katherine River. By 1920, public interest in the idea of a north–south transcontinental railway had taken hold. However, the legal opinion of the federal attorney-general left open an interpretation that the route could be from anywhere across South Australia's northern border. Queensland interests pressed strongly for a route from the north-east corner of the state, near Birdsville, and north into the pastoral lands of Queensland before joining the existing line at Katherine River. This would involve the Central Australia Railway taking a sharp turn to the east from its established railhead at Oodnadatta for a diversion about 600 km (370 mi) east of the initially intended route through the centre of the continent via Alice Springs. The federal government referred the matter to the parliamentary standing committee on public works to examine the whole question. At the same time, it authorised an extension of the line in the Northern Territory southwards to Mataranka. This was in keeping with a changed Commonwealth viewpoint – that the start of the transcontinental railway was to be in the Northern Territory, not South Australia. The committee's report, completed in late 1922, recommended that the Port Darwin to Katherine River railway be extended to Daly Waters and eventually be extended further south to Newcastle Waters before heading to the Queensland border, and that a light line be built from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Further, when the time arrived for construction of a transcontinental railway, the route that would be in the best interests of Australia should be selected. When the report had been accepted, further delays occurred and it was not until 1926 – 14 years after assuming ownership – that the federal government assumed actual control of the line and named it the North Australia Railway; it also took over the Central Australia Railway. In 1929, the Commonwealth Railways extended the North Australia Railway southwards to what was to be its final terminus, Birdum, and extended the Central Australia Railway northwards to its final terminus at Alice Springs. There remained a gap of more than 800 km (500 mi) to be bridged before Australia's ambitions could be fulfilled. Operation In the early years of its operation under Commonwealth control, traffic was light, which, given its light engineering, was for the best. In 1930, a mixed (i.e., freight and passenger) train, which Territorians had nicknamed Leaping Lena,\\"The Darwin Sentinel - Leaping Lena\\" Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin February 1987 pp35-40 ran to an established timetable: *depart Darwin at 08:00 on Wednesdays *arrive at Pine Creek at 16:46 *depart Pine Creek at 08:00 on Thursdays *arrive at Katherine at 11:00 on Fridays *depart Katherine at 12:00 *arrive at Birdum at 17:51 on Fridays. The leisurely pace was to vanish in 1942. World War II Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Australian Army surveyed a rail route for the gap between Birdum and Alice Springs, on which freight had to be carried by road vehicles, but construction did not eventuate.Alice Springs - Birdum Railway Proposal, NAA B300 5497/4, National Archives of AustraliaDarwin - Planning: Alice Springs - Birdum Railway, NAA: AWM54 625/5/23, 1942. The railway experienced very heavy, damaging traffic during the war since it was a strategic route to operations north of Australia. Larrimah, nine kilometres north of Birdum, became the effective railhead because, unlike Birdum, it was on the Stuart Highway.The 100-metre bridge across Birdum Creek still exists. In 1944, as many as 147 trains ran per week.

Closure In May 1976, the federal government ordered the closure of the entire North Australia Railway line, mainly as a result of the loss of iron ore traffic originating from the Frances Creek mine. All services ceased on 30 June. Maintenance gangs were withdrawn in December 1977. Heavy floods in 1978 destroyed parts of the railway, effectively eliminating any prospect of the railway re-opening. In 1985, some rails and steel sleepers were lifted and sent for use in Tasmania. Heritage listing The Pine Creek railway precinct has been placed in the Northern Territory Heritage Register. It is in the care of the National Trust Northern Territory, as is the Katherine railway station. Standard-gauge line Nearly 20 years after the line between Tarcoola and Alice Springs was opened, a consortium was formed to build a standard gauge line between Alice Springs and Darwin. Construction lasted from July 2001 to September 2003. The line broadly followed the original narrow-gauge route between Adelaide River and Emungalan. However, engineering standards, much higher than those of its 19th century predecessor, required a \\"fresh start\\" and the only major infrastructure to be retained was the Ferguson River bridge.. The first freight train from Adelaide reached Darwin in January 2004 and the first passenger service (The Ghan) from Adelaide to Darwin in February 2004, finally fulfilling the 121-year dream of a north–south transcontinental railway.

The doctrine of legitimate expectation was predominantly developed by the UK courts. The doctrine of legitimate expectation was first developed in English law as a ground of judicial review in administrative law to protect a procedural or substantive interest when a public authority rescinds from a representation made to a person. It is based on the principles of natural justice and fairness, and seeks to prevent authorities from abusing power. The courts of the United Kingdom have recognized both procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. A procedural legitimate expectation rests on the presumption that a public authority will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken, while a substantive legitimate expectation arises where an authority makes a lawful representation that an individual will receive or continue to receive some kind of substantive benefit. In determining a claim for an alleged breach of a legitimate expectation, a court will deliberate over three key considerations: # whether a legitimate expectation has arisen; # whether it would be unlawful for the authority to frustrate such an expectation; and # if it is found that the authority has done so, what remedies are available to the aggrieved person. Procedural legitimate expectations have been recognized in a number of common law jurisdictions. In contrast, notwithstanding their acceptance and protection in the UK, substantive legitimate expectations have not been universally recognized. For instance, they have been given effect in Singapore but not in Australia. Introduction =Origins and basis of the doctrine= F. W. Pomeroy's 1906 statue of Lady Justice on the dome of the Old Bailey in London. The doctrine of legitimate expectation is viewed as an offshoot of natural justice. Since its inception, the doctrine of legitimate expectation has been viewed as an offshoot of natural justice.. The duty to act fairly is a core tenet of administrative law and a predominant feature in the application of the rules of natural justice. With each individual's entitlement to natural justice and fairness, legitimate expectation reinforces the duty of public bodies to act fairly. It is this protection of fairness that made way for the courts' acknowledgement of legitimate expectations. In their elaboration of the doctrine, courts of the United Kingdom adopted other key aspects of judicial review such as Wednesbury unreasonableness, fairness,R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents Ltd. (1989) [1990] 1 W.L.R. 1545 at 1569–1570, High Court (Queen's Bench) (England & Wales). and abuse of power. to justify the existence and the protection of legitimate expectations. The term legitimate expectation was first used in the case of Schmidt v Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1968), but was not applied on the facts. Subsequently, in O'Reilly v Mackman (1983). the doctrine of legitimate expectation was recognized as part of judicial review in public law, allowing individuals to challenge the legality of decisions on the grounds that the decision-maker \\"had acted outwith the powers conferred upon it\\".O'Reilly, p. 274. Although initially unclear, the nature and boundaries of the doctrine of legitimate expectation have been elucidated by seminal cases such as Council of Civil Service Unions v Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case, 1983).. and R v North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999).. Notwithstanding efforts of the courts, some ambiguity as to when legitimate expectations arise persisted. In response, Lord Justice of Appeal John Laws proposed the aspiration of \\"good administration\\" as a justification for the protection of legitimate expectations.. =Legal framework= A procedural legitimate expectation is created when a representation is made by a public authority that it will follow a certain procedure before making a decision on the substantive merits of a particular case. Examples of procedural legitimate expectations include an expectation to be consulted. and to a fair hearing.. A substantive legitimate expectation is formed where a representation is made by an authority as to the final decision and outcome that the authority will make in a particular case.. Upon reviewing a claim for the protection of a legitimate expectation against a public authority's decision, courts will deliberate over three key considerations:. *The situations and circumstances in which legitimate expectations arise. *Instances in which it would be unlawful for the public authority to frustrate such an expectation. *The remedies that would be available to the aggrieved party if it is found that the public authority had unlawfully frustrated a legitimate expectation. When does an expectation become legitimate? When determining if a legitimate expectation is present, the required conditions are as follows:.The conditions were adopted by the High Court of Singapore in . *The representation must be clear, unambiguous, and not have any relevant qualification. *The expectation must be induced by the behaviour of the public authority. *The representation must have been made by someone who had actual or apparent authority. *The representation must be applicable to the aggrieved parties. Courts take into account not only the reasonableness of the expectation but other considerations such as the nature of representation made. In the GCHQ case, Lord Diplock stated that a legitimate expectation is one which \\"has consequences to which effect will be given in public law, whereas an expectation or hope that some benefit or advantage would continue to be enjoyed, although it might well be entertained by a 'reasonable' man, would not necessarily have such consequences\\".GCHQ case, pp. 408–409. It is a question of law, and has to be decided on an objective basis with full reference to the facts of the case.Re Findlay [1985] A.C. 318, H.L. (UK). Although the GCHQ case states that \\"effect will be given in public law\\" for a legitimate expectation, the legitimacy of an expectation is not meant to be a conclusory label assuring the court's provision of remedies, but rather to warrant prima facie protection only. It may be rebutted by countervailing public interests.. =Nature of representation made= A legitimate expectation does not arise when it is made ultra vires of the decision-maker's statutory powers, that is, when the decision-maker lacked legal power to make the representation.. Courts are reluctant to protect such an expectation that has been created. The rationale is undoubtedly clear and rests on the scope of the administrative authority's powers.. It prevents public authorities from expanding their powers simply by making ultra vires representations. Secondly, allowing public authorities to be bound by their ultra vires representations may potentially prevent them from exercising their statutory powers or duties. Also, allowing a public authority to be bound could be unfair to third parties who are affected. However, courts may be obliged to protect legitimate expectations arising from representations by unauthorized officers of the public body.. Ultra vires representations Expectations are not legitimate when they require a public authority to act in breach of its statutory duty.. This applies only when the statutory provisions diametrically conflict with the representation. In other words, the statutory provision will render the courts' fulfilment of the expectation impossible. However, a statutory provision which merely permits, but does not compel the public authority to breach the expectation will not necessarily justify any such breach. An individual's human rights protected by the Human Rights Act 1998 of the UK,Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42, UK). may occasionally override arguments of legality. In Stretch v. United Kingdom (2003),; see also Pine Valley Developments Ltd. v. Ireland (1991) 14 E.H.R.R. 319, E.C.H.R. the European Court of Human Rights declared that whether the legality of the authority's action should be ignored will be determined on a case-by-case basis, and in light of proportionality.. Statements by unauthorized officers For an expectation to be legitimate, the individual making the representation must have actual or apparent authority to make it on the behalf of the public authority. Such representations would prima facie bind the public authority.Flanagan, p. 2607, para. 18. Although representations made by an individual with apparent authority may have been made outside his or her powers, they are nevertheless legitimate as they fall within the scope of powers of the particular public body.Craig, p. 665. Representations will not lead to legitimate expectations when delegation of such power to the individual making the representation is forbidden by statute,Craig, p. 668. or where the individual making the representation lacks actual or apparent authority. In the latter case, the applicant's expectation will lack legitimacy and thus would prima facie not be binding on the public authority. =Reasonableness of the expectation= In deciding whether the expectation held by the aggrieved party is legitimate, the courts will consider whether the expectation was, in all circumstances, reasonable when it was formed.Ng Yuen Shiu, p. 636. The reasonableness test requires the court to assess the behaviour of the parties in the events which occurred prior to the making of the alleged representation, according to the following criteria: *The representation may arise from either the words used or the behaviour of the parties. *The aggrieved party must not have utilized fraudulent measures to obtain the representation, and must have disclosed all relevant information. *The representation must usually be \\"clear, unambiguous and devoid of all relevant qualification\\".Ex parte M.F.K. Underwriting Agents, p. 1549. However, this is not required to establish the existence of a legitimate expectation if the public authority acted so unfairly such that its conduct constituted an abuse of power.. The number of individuals affected may play a part, as courts have found a legitimate expectation to exist when the representation was \\"pressing and focused\\" and made to a small group of individuals.Nadarajah, p. 1386, para. 46. On the other hand, courts rarely find the existence of a legitimate expectation when the representation was one made in general terms to a large and diverse group of individuals.Ex parte Coughlan, pp. 246–247, para. 71. However, it may be noted that there are instances where an individual has successfully sought relief on behalf of a sizeable group of people. =Reliance and detriment as consideration for legitimacy= H.M. King George the Fifth Gateway of The Leys School in Cambridge, UK. In a 1999 case, ex parte Begbie, a schoolgirl admitted to the school under a state-funded assisted places scheme claimed her legitimate expectation had been breached after the scheme was cancelled. In its judgment, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales noted it is unnecessary for applicants to show they have relied on public bodies' representations to their detriment to establish legitimate expectations. However, where detrimental reliance is absent, courts will only protect a legitimate expectation in exceptional cases. Courts have considered the applicant's reliance on the representation as a relevant consideration when determining the existence of a legitimate expectation. The role of reliance may be better assessed by distinguishing between \\"weak reliance\\" and \\"strong reliance\\". Weak reliance occurs when the applicant was made aware of and merely believed in the truth of the representation. Strong reliance, on the other hand, occurs where the applicant acted upon the representation and consequently faced detriment.Steele, pp. 309–310. Weak reliance is not required where the authority failed to apply the general policy at the time to the individual case at hand.. This exception is prompted by the overriding imperative of equality. Thus, the applicant need not have had detailed knowledge or the existence of the policy in order for a legitimate expectation to arise where the public authority had departed from the existing policy in deciding the individual case.. Strong reliance by the applicant is not compulsory to prove the existence of a legitimate expectation. In spite of this, Lord Justice of Appeal Peter Gibson stated in R v Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999). that \\"it would be wrong to understate the significance of reliance in this area of the law\\". Detrimental reliance is not indicative of whether the court should protect an applicant's legitimate expectation but usually furthers an applicant's case, and it is only in exceptional cases where courts will protect a legitimate expectation in which detrimental reliance is absent.Ex parte Begbie, pp. 1123–1124. Procedural legitimate expectations A procedural legitimate expectation by an individual or group rests on the presumption that the decision-maker will follow a certain procedure in advance of a decision being taken. This expectation can manifest in various ways, such as the expectation of being consulted;GCHQ case, p. 401. of an inquiry being held;R. v. Liverpool Corporation, ex parte Liverpool Taxi Fleet Operators' Association [1972] 2 Q.B. 299, C.A. (England & Wales). of a fair hearing; and of being allowed time to make representations, especially where the applicant is seeking to persuade an authority to depart from a lawfully established policy.GCHQ case, p. 415. The courts' protection of procedural legitimate expectations reinforces the notion that administrative decision-makers should be bound by certain representations which they make to individuals who stand to be affected by their decisions.Steele, p. 300. Rooted in the principle of natural justice, procedural legitimate expectation protects procedural interests of the individual in public law. Although procedural expectations by applicants may manifest in various forms, they are all aspects of the \\"right to a hearing\\", which an individual affected by a decision enjoys.R. v. Secretary of State for Transport, ex parte Richmond-upon-Thames London Borough Council [1994] 1 W.L.R. 74 at 93, C.A. (England & Wales). The UK courts developed this doctrine largely to ensure that the rules of natural justice are observed, to encourage good administration and prevent abuses by decision- makers.O'Reilly, p. 275. =Development of procedural protection= A key step in the development of procedural legitimate expectation was the observation of Lord Fraser of Tullybelton in Attorney-General of Hong Kong v. Ng Yuen Shiu (1983) that \\"when a public authority has promised to follow a certain procedure, it is in the interest of good administration that it should act fairly and should implement its promise, so long as implementation does not interfere with its statutory duty\\".Ng Yuen Shiu, p. 638. Immigration Tower, Hong Kong. In a 1983 case, Attorney-General of Hong Kong v Ng Yuen Shiu, the Privy Council held it was a breach of a procedural legitimate expectation for the Director of Immigration not to fulfil an undertaking to give an illegal immigrant a chance to make representations before deciding to deport him. Despite initial resistance to recognition of this doctrine by the courts,Lloyd v McMahon [1987] 1 A.C. 625, C.A. (England & Wales) and H.L. (UK). the landmark GCHQ case firmly established procedural protection of legitimate expectations. In the case, strikes by civil servants at the Government Communications Headquarters had destabilized operations and were seen as a threat to national security. The Government of the United Kingdom took swift action to limit the rights of GCHQ employees to join unions, permitting them only to belong to an approved departmental staff association. The applicant organization challenged this decision by arguing that it should have been consulted because of a long-standing practice of doing so. In his judgment, Lord Fraser regarded the term legitimate as synonymous to \\"reasonable\\" and identified two ways in which a legitimate expectation could arise, namely, \\"either from an express promise given on behalf of a public authority or from the existence of a regular practice which the claimant can reasonably expect to continue.\\" While the House of Lords ultimately held that the government action was not unlawful for reasons of national security, it agreed that there was a legitimate expectation on the facts due to the well-established practice of consultation between the government and the trade union on important matters affecting the latter. The court was of the opinion that if not for national security interests, the application to protect a procedural legitimate expectation through judicial review would have been granted. Protection of procedural legitimate expectations has since been firmly entrenched as one of the court's roles in judicial review. The importance of procedural fairness as enunciated in the GCHQ case is further illustrated by Re Police Association for Northern Ireland's Reference (1990).Re Police Association for Northern Ireland's Reference [1990] N.I. 258, High Court (Q.B.) (Northern Ireland). Applying the principles in the GCHQ case, the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland held that the Police Association had neither been deprived of a legitimate expectation nor treated unfairly. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales also protected procedural interests by stating that a public authority cannot, without some form of warning, change a long-standing practice that it is aware an individual has acted in the light of and derived a benefit from, in the case of R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte Unilever plc (1996).R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex parte Unilever plc [1996] S.T.C. 681, C.A. (England & Wales). =Shift to protection of the substantive domain= Although the courts' protection of procedural legitimate expectations assured individuals that decision-making processes were guided by fairness and thus the \\"greater propensity for fairer decisions\\",. in some circumstances a procedural right alone was insufficient for producing a fair outcome as \\"procedure and substance are intertwined, with procedural rights reinforcing substantive ones, and vice-versa \\".Aziz & Sui, p. 151. The Schmidt case illustrates that the courts' protection of a procedural right inevitably leads to a substantive outcome. The plaintiffs here challenged a decision to refuse renewal of their residence permits on the grounds that they had not been given a hearing before the decision was reached. This argument was rejected as the original permits had been issued for only a certain time, which had since expired. However, Lord Denning, the Master of the Rolls, said that had the plaintiffs' residence permits been revoked before they expired, they \\"would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for the permitted time\\".Schmidt, p. 171. The Court of Appeal in effect envisaged procedural protection of a substantive expectation of being allowed to stay in the UK.. Substantive legitimate expectations A substantive legitimate expectation arises where a public body makes a \\"lawful representation that an individual will receive, or continue to receive, a substantive benefit of some kind\\".Leyland & Anthony, p. 313. =Development of substantive protection= In R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Hargreaves (1996),. the Court of Appeal of England and Wales initially rejected the argument that the courts could perform a substantive review function beyond that permitted by Wednesbury unreasonableness.Leyland & Anthony, p. 321. In contrast, in the earlier case of R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Khan (1984),. the applicant had argued that the government had unfairly failed to apply the criteria in a government circular that outlined when a family could adopt children living outside the UK. In the Court of Appeal's judgment, Lord Justice of Appeal Hubert Parker surmised that expanding the doctrine of legitimate expectation to protect a substantive element would not necessarily be inconsistent with the principle underlying the doctrine. He stated that \\"just as [other cases have established that public authorities cannot] resile from an undertaking and change [their] policy without giving a fair hearing so, in principle, the Secretary of State, if he undertakes to allow in persons if certain conditions are satisfied, should not in my view be entitled to resile from that undertaking without affording interested persons a hearing\\".Ex parte Khan, p. 1344. This introduced the idea that in certain cases the courts would consider if policy changes were justified even when the affected parties had already been consulted. Effectively, this proposition grants courts the discretion to ascertain whether the public interest is better served by ordering an authority to perform its undertaking than to frustrate it. Ex parte Khan is also regarded as the first case in which an individual relied on a general policy, as opposed to a specific representation or a policy drawn for a closed class of persons, as the grounds for the expectation of a benefit.. While the case mooted the idea of a substantive legitimate expectation, the doctrine was more completely developed in the High Court judgment of R v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries Ltd. (1995).R v Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, ex parte Hamble (Off- shore) Fisheries Ltd. [1995] 2 All E.R. 714, H.C. (Q.B.) (England & Wales). Justice Stephen Sedley attempted to widen the Court's protection of legitimate expectations by including \\"substantive protection of a substantive legitimate expectation\\".. He rejected the proposition that legitimate expectations are limited to procedural grounds by stating: \\"It is difficult to see why it is any less unfair to frustrate a legitimate expectation that something will or will not be done by the decision-maker than it is to frustrate a legitimate expectation that the applicant will be listened to before the decision-maker decides whether to take a particular step.\\"Ex parte Hamble (Off-shore) Fisheries, p. 724. When a court protects an applicant's substantive legitimate expectation, it is effectively mandating the outcome of a public body's decision-making process. One criticism is that this undesirably fetters the body's discretion as it will no longer be able to formulate policy without constraints. Nevertheless, it has been acknowledged that protecting substantive legitimate expectations ensures good administration. Consistency and fairness are reinforced in decision-making processes where the administrative power to alter policy is not used to unduly frustrate legitimate expectations.. Furthermore, when a public body acts contrary to what it had induced an individual to expect, it may cause that individual severe hardship, especially if he or she relied on the representation and there is no satisfactory alternative to the substance of the promise. The problem is alleviated if the court orders that the individual's legitimate expectation be given effect.Schønberg & Craig, pp. 696–697. =Categorical approach= Wonford Road in Exeter, UK. Near this place along the same road is the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust's Mardon Neuro-Rehabilitation Centre. When it was known as Mardon House, its threatened closure led to a 1999 judgment, ex parte Coughlan, in which the Court of Appeal said a disabled resident's legitimate expectation that she would have a \\"home for life\\" there had been breached by a health authority then managing the facility. Substantive legitimate expectation was definitively recognized as a ground of judicial review in the UK in ex parte Coughlan. The case involved a health authority which resiled from its explicit promise to the disabled applicant that a facility at which she was living would be her \\"home for life\\".Ex parte Coughlan, p. 223, para. 1. The Court of Appeal affirmed that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the authority would keep the facility open, and quashed the authority's decision to close it. The Court stated that there were three categories of legitimate expectations:Leyland & Anthony, p. 322. *Category (a): substantive legitimate expectation – change of policy. A court may decide that a public authority is only required \\"to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight it thinks right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course\\".Ex parte Coughlan, p. 241, para. 57. In this type of case, which involves a change of policy by the authority,See, for example, Re Findlay and ex parte Hargreaves. the court can only review the decision on the grounds of Wednesbury unreasonableness.Ex parte Coughlan, pp. 241–242, para. 57. In other words, it will determine if the decision was rational and whether the authority gave proper weight to the implications of not fulfilling the promise. In ex parte Begbie it was clarified that cases fall into this category where a sizeable part of the population is affected and the change of policy involves \\"what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field\\".Ex parte Begbie, p. 1131.Leyland & Anthony, p. 323. *Category (b): procedural legitimate expectation – no consultation. The court may decide that a promise or practice creates a legitimate expectation of being consulted before a certain decision is taken. In this situation, \\"it is uncontentious that the court itself will require the opportunity for consultation to be given unless there is an overriding reason to resile from it[] ... in which case the court will itself judge the adequacy of the reason advanced for the change of policy, taking into account what fairness requires\\".Ex parte Coughlan, p. 242, para. 57. *Category (c): substantive legitimate expectation – promise having the character of a contract. If a lawful promise or practice has \\"induced a legitimate expectation of a benefit which is substantive, not simply procedural\\", the court will decide \\"whether to frustrate that expectation is so unfair that to take a new and different course will amount to an abuse of power\\". When the expectation is established to be legitimate, \\"the court will have the task of weighing the requirements of fairness against any overriding interest relied upon for the change of policy\\". Most cases of this type are likely to be \\"cases where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract\\".Ex parte Coughlan, p. 242, para. 59. =Proportionality approach= Under the categorical approach advocated by ex parte Coughlan, for a substantive legitimate expectation to be protected it had to fit into either category (a) or (c).Leyland & Anthony, p. 325. However, classifying substantive legitimate expectations into distinct categories is difficult in cases where there are overlaps, leading Lord Justice Laws to suggest in ex parte Begbie that the categories mentioned in ex parte Coughlan are not \\"hermetically sealed\\".Ex parte Begbie, p. 1130. In an obiter dictum in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), Lord Justice Laws set out a more structured form of merits-based review.. He expanded the categorical approach in ex parte Coughlan into a continuum based on proportionality, suggesting that in order for a public body's decision to resile from a legitimate expectation to be lawful, it must be \\"a proportionate response to a legitimate aim pursued by the public body in the public interest\\".Nadarajah, para. 68. By advocating proportionality in the court's approach towards protecting substantive legitimate expectations, Lord Justice Laws effectively paralleled the approach used by the UK courts when considering whether an interference with a right subject to qualifications protected by the European Convention on Human Rights is lawful. Drawing guidance from the Convention, the proportionality test requires (1) that the objective of the action must be sufficiently important to justify limiting a fundamental right; (2) that the action designed to meet the objective must be rationally connected to that objective, and not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; and (3) the means used to impair the right must be no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate objective, and the more severe the deleterious effects of an action, the more important the objective must be if the action is to be justified.. As the European Convention was given effect in the domestic law of the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998, the proportionality approach resonated with the courts which were familiar in applying the test in cases involving qualified Convention rights across a wide spectrum of factual and policy contexts. For instance, the proportionality approach was applied by Justice Stephen Silber in R. (X) v. Head Teacher and Governors of Y School (2007).. =Overriding public interest= Having determined that the applicant's substantive expectation is legitimate, the court then has to determine whether there is any overriding public interest justifying the public authority's decision to resile from its representation, or whether fairness dictates that the representation should be given effect to.Ex parte Coughlan, p. 242, paras. 57–58. Remedies =Fulfilment of the legitimate expectation= When a court establishes that a public authority's decision has breached a legitimate expectation, it may annul the decision and order that the authority fulfil the expectation. A decision is invalidated by the issuance of a quashing order (also known as certiorari), one of the more common prerogative orders, and often results in the issue returning to the original body to be reconsidered afresh.Leyland & Anthony, p. 454. For example, in Ng Yuen Shiu, a representation was made by the Director of Immigration that each illegal entrant to Hong Kong from Macau, of whom the applicant was one, would be interviewed with each case treated on its merits before a decision was made whether to deport the entrant. However, the applicant was not given an opportunity to make any representations. The Director's failure to provide the applicant with this chance was deemed a sufficient ground for quashing the decision. The Court of Appeal of Hong Kong had ordered a prohibition restraining the removal orders from being executed. However, the Privy Council decided that a prohibition was excessive and issued a certiorari instead. It noted that the latter order did not prevent the Director from making a fresh removal order following a fair inquiry at which the applicant had been given an opportunity to explain why he should not be deported.Ng Yuen Shiu, p. 639. A quashing order may also be used to protect a substantive legitimate expectation. It sets aside the decision that frustrates the promise made by a public authority to an applicant, thus binding the authority to fulfil its representation. In Ex parte Coughlan, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the applicant had a substantive legitimate expectation for the facility at which she was living to be kept open for the rest of her life, which the health authority was not allowed to frustrate. It therefore upheld the High Court's decision to issue a quashing order to prevent the authority from closing the facility, effectively ensuring that the facility was kept running for the benefit of its residents. To direct a public body fulfil a legitimate expectation, the court issues a mandatory order (also known as a mandamus). This is a prerogative order which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is often used to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them.Leyland & Anthony, p. 457. =Reconsideration of decision= In R (Bibi) v Newham London Borough Council (2001), instead of ordering that the public authority fulfil a legitimate expectation that had been breached, the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that when the decision in question is \\"informed by social and political value judgments as to priorities of expenditure\\" it is more appropriate for the authority to make the decision,Bibi, p. 252, para. 64. and the court may order that the authority should merely reconsider its decision, taking into account the person's substantive legitimate expectation.Bibi, p. 252, para. 67. =Damages= The payment of damages (monetary compensation) by a public authority is relevant to legitimate expectation in two ways. First, if the authority has voluntarily paid damages to an individual for breaching a legitimate expectation, the court could hold that the authority has not abused its power and thus there is no need to compel it to fulfil the expectation.Ex parte Coughlan, p. 251, para. 82; Bibi, p. 250, para. 56. Secondly, it has been suggested that upon finding that the authority has breached a legitimate expectation, instead of ordering the expectation to be given effect, the court could direct that damages be paid. However, a serious difficulty with this proposal is the fact that at present English law does not generally recognize monetary compensation as a remedy for breaches of public law. A person can only obtain damages if he or she also has a parallel cause of action in private law (for example, in the law of contract or tort), and the non- fulfilment of a legitimate expectation is only likely to give rise to such a cause of action on rare occasions.Steele, pp. 322–323. In R. v. Commissioners of Custom and Excise, ex parte F & I Services Ltd. (2001). Justice Sedley referred to the possibility of damages as a remedy,Ex parte F & I Services Ltd., para. 72. but commented:Ex parte F & I Services Ltd., para. 73, quoted in Steele, pp. 323–324. The view has been taken that damages are not a suitable remedy when the loss suffered by an individual cannot be assessed meaningfully, but if they can be quantified then ordering an authority to pay compensation is preferable to insisting that it act in a manner that it regards as not being in the public interest. However, fulfilment of the legitimate expectation should be the primary remedy.Steele, pp. 325–326. Legitimate expectations in other jurisdictions =Australia= Besides applying in the UK, procedural legitimate expectation was approved by the Federal Court of Australia in GTE (Australia) Pty. Ltd. v. Brown (1986).. In the case, the Minister of State for Administrative Services, acting on behalf of the Minister of State for Industry and Commerce, imposed anti-dumping duties on the applicant. The applicant brought legal proceedings claiming that the authorities had denied it natural justice by failing to comply with a promise to provide an opportunity for a hearing towards the close of the investigation on whether the duties should be levied, and by departing from certain procedures. Applying Ng Yuen Shiu and the GCHQ case, the Court agreed that the applicant's legitimate expectation had been frustrated by the failure to conduct a hearing, and that it had been unfair for the authorities not to follow the procedures.GTE (Australia) at paras. 47–49. On the other hand, strong doubts have been expressed about substantive legitimate expectation. In Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam (2003),. the High Court of Australia said that the reasoning in ex parte Coughlan violated the separation of powers doctrine by overextending the reach of judicial power provided for in section 75(v) of the Constitution of Australia. In its opinion, the balancing act employed in ex parte Coughlan should be left to the executive and falls beyond the province of the courts.. =Singapore= In Singapore, the High Court has recognized that a representation that a consultation will be held before a public authority makes a decision can give rise to a procedural legitimate expectation, though no applicant has successfully established the existence of such an expectation yet.Re Siah Mooi Guat [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 165 at 172–179, paras. 15–35, H.C. (Singapore); Borissik, pp. 105–106, paras. 46–52. As for the protection of substantive legitimate expectations, in Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor (1997),Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah v. Public Prosecutor [1997] SGCA 38, [1997] 2 S.L.R.(R.) 842, Court of Appeal (Singapore), archived from the original on 24 December 2011. a criminal case, the Court of Appeal relied on the concept of legitimate expectations to support the overruling of an incorrect legal principle prospectively – with effect from the date of the judgment – rather than retrospectively which would be the usual effect of a judgment. It stated that \\"certain legitimate expectations could, in certain circumstances, be deserving of protection, even though they did not acquire the force of a legal right\\",Abdul Nasir, p. 858, para. 55. although it emphasized it was not considering whether the Prisons Department was prevented from carrying out its duties by a legitimate expectation.Abdul Nasir, p. 858, para. 54. In UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. v. Jurong Town Corp. (2011), the High Court doubted whether the doctrine of substantive legitimate expectation is part of Singapore law, but did not discuss the matter fully as neither the respondent nor the Attorney-General had made submissions on the issue. Subsequently, in Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority (2013),Chiu Teng @ Kallang Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Land Authority (2013) [2014] 1 S.L.R. 1047, H.C. (Singapore). For commentary, see ; ; and . a differently constituted High Court held that substantive legitimate expectation should be recognized as a ground of judicial review if the following conditions are satisfied:Chiu Teng, pp. 1089–1090, para. 119. =Bangladesh= Judicial precedents have developed the doctrine of legitimate expectation in Bangladesh since 1987. The criteria of the doctrine was restated in Golam Mustafa v. Bangladesh, which is described in the following.http://www.culaw.ac.bd/jurnal_pdf/9743683E-93D4-4F31-A5D4-C9CED6B2D7B7.PDFhttp://www.thedailystar.net/law/2011/01/04/reviewing.htm # If there is a promise by the authority expressed either by their representations or conducts. # The decision of the authority was arbitrary or unreasonable within the Wednesbury principle. # There was a failure on the part of the concerned authority to act fairly in taking the decision. # The expectation to be crystallized into a legitimate one, it must be based on clear facts and circumstances leading to a definite expectation and not a mere anticipation or a wish or hope and also must be reasonable in the circumstances. # Judicial review may allow such a legitimate expectation and quash the impugned decision even in the absence of a strict legal right unless there is an overriding public interest to defeat such an expectation.http://www.culaw.ac.bd/jurnal_pdf/9743683E-93D4-4F31-A5D4-C9CED6B2D7B7.PDF See also *Legitimate expectation in Singapore law Notes References =Cases= Singapore *Re Siah Mooi Guat [1988] 2 S.L.R.(R.)

The programme consisted of a junior course for graduates of local army cadet schools and for those who had completed four years of middle school, and a senior course for officer candidates. History and background Established as the Heigakkō in 1868 in Kyoto, the officer training school was renamed the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1874 and relocated to Ichigaya, Tokyo. After 1898, the Academy came under the supervision of the Army Education Administration. In 1937 the Academy was divided, with the Senior Course Academy being relocated to Sagamihara in Kanagawa prefecture, and the Junior Course School moved to Asaka, Saitama. The 50th graduation ceremony was held in the new Academy buildings in Sagamihara on 20 December 1937, and was attended by the Shōwa Emperor (Emperor Hirohito) himself. In 1938, a separate school was established for military aviation officers. During World War II, the school was highly respected and faculty consisted of many Tokyo Imperial University alumni. It also accepted a large number of students from China, and many of those cadets later had prominent ranks in the Republic of China Armed Forces. In June 1945, as a precautionary measure due to Allied bombings, the Academy sent its entire staff and 3,000 students on a long-term bivouac in Nagano Prefecture, leaving the installation under a light guard as caretakers. In September 1945, after the surrender of Japan, a battalion of the U.S. Army’s 1st Cavalry Division took control of the Academy from the soldiers guarding it. The Academy was abolished along with the Imperial Japanese Army at the end of 1945, and its Sagamihara grounds are now part of the United States Army base of Camp Zama. Currently the corresponding institution for the modern Japan Ground Self- Defense Force is the National Defense Academy of Japan. Curriculum The Imperial Japanese Army Academy in Ichigaya, Tokyo(市ヶ谷陸軍士官学校), built by the second French Military Mission to Japan (1874 photograph). From 1937 to 1945, an estimated 18,476 cadets were trained at the Imperial Japanese Army Academy. Candidates for the Imperial Japanese Army Academy were rigidly selected from graduates of 3-year courses at one of the military preparatory school (Rikugun Yonen Gakkō) at Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Sendai, and Kumamoto, and from other applicants with the proper physical and educational qualifications. The Rikugun Yonen Gakkō were schools mainly for officers' children and children of army soldiers who fell in action. Some candidates were enlisted men in active service under 25 years old; others were general applicants between ages 16 to 18 who passed an examination. The training curriculum included college-level general education courses, traditional martial arts and horsemanship. After completing the two year junior portion of training at Asaka in Saitama, cadets were assigned for eight months to infantry regiments to become familiar with Army weaponry and platoon leadership skills before resuming studies in the 1-year, 8-month senior program at Sagamihara in Kanagawa. Upon graduation, cadets became apprentice officers with the grade of sergeant-major (but who were treated as officers), and after the successful completion of four months probation in their assigned regiments, were formally commissioned as second lieutenants.

It is located near what is now the town of Battle, East Sussex. The name Senlac was popularised by the Victorian historian E.A. Freeman based solely on a description of the battle by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis. Freeman went on to suggest that the Normans nicknamed the area Blood lake as a pun on the English Sand lake. It is not improbable that Orderic would have known the English name for Senlac as he spent his early life in England having been born to an English mother. His education, towards the end of his time in England, was from an English monk. However, Freeman's hypothesis has been criticised by other historians as it relies purely on the evidence from Orderic Vitalis. Orderic was born nine years after the Battle of Hastings and chroniclers who were more contemporary with the battle did not use the name Senlac. Origin The Battle of Hastings was fought in 1066 at this location. The Saxon position was on top of the hill where the Abbey later stood, and the Normans approximately where the photographer is standing. The name Senlac was introduced into English history by the Victorian historian E.A. Freeman, his only source for this being the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis.Vitalis. The Ecclesiastical History of England and Normandy.Retrieved 20 November 2014The Historical Gazetteer of England's Place-Names Retrieved 20 November 2014 Freeman suggested that Senlac was the correct name of the Battle of Hastings site since the name of the hill was Senlac and was near a stream called Santlache.Freeman.

When Orderic was five, his parents sent him to an English monk with the name of Siward, who kept a school in the Abbey of SS Peter and Paul at Shrewsbury. Although Orderic moved to a monastery in Normandy at the age of ten, he seems to have maintained his links with England. Freeman concluded that it was perfectly possible for Orderic to have known the English name of the ridge. The Chronicle of Battle Abbey describes what it calls Malfosse, which was a large ditch that opened up during the course of the battle (some sources say after the battle), where many soldiers of both sides fell and were trampled to death, the result was rivulets of blood as far as one could see.Searle.

Norman was educated privately in France and at Harvard University, where he obtained his B.A. For several years he worked on the editorial staff of the Pall Mall Gazette and later joined the editorial staff of the Daily Chronicle, being appointed Assistant Editor of the latter in 1895. He retired from journalism in 1899. During this time he travelled widely in Canada and the United States and in Russia, Japan, China, Siam, Malaya and Central Asia. Much of the material included in the two volumes mentioned in the description was amassed during these tours. He was knighted in 1906 and made a baronet in 1915. Family and education Norman was born in Leicester, the son of Henry Norman, a merchant and local radical politician. Norman was educated at Leicester Collegiate School and Grove House School and later studied theology and philosophy at Leipzig and Harvard University. His family were Unitarians in religion and Norman first embarked in a career as a preacher but he gave up this calling and his religion on his return to England. In 1891 he married author Ménie Muriel Dowie (1867–1945) but they divorced in 1903 on the grounds of her adultery with a family friend, Edward Arthur Fitzgerald. Norman was awarded custody of their son Henry Nigel St Valery Norman who was born in 1897. In 1907 he married Florence Priscilla McLaren (1884–1964), the daughter of the wealthy industrialist and Liberal MP, Sir Charles McLaren. They had three children. In 1922 he purchased Ramster Hall, Chiddingfold, Guildford, Surrey with Lady Norman. Journalism Norman became a journalist working for the Pall Mall Gazette and the New York Times. As a journalist he was famous for uncovering the truth behind the Dreyfuss Affair. He was on the staff of the Daily Chronicle from 1892, becoming assistant editor. Norman travelled extensively in the East, where he took a number of photographs that are held at Cambridge University. Later he founded and edited the magazine The World's Work (vols 1-42 1902-1923). Business He was appointed Assistant Postmaster-General in 1910 and his interest in international communications led to a number of appointments related to wireless and telegraphy, among them Chairman of the War Office Committee on Wireless Telegraphy 1912, and Chairman of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee of 1920, the latter convened to draw up a complete wireless scheme for the Empire. He was an early advocate of wireless broadcasting, opening the All British Wireless Exhibition at the Royal Horticultural Hall, Westminster in 1922 at which he predicted the ubiquitous uptake, to a very sceptical press, of the technology into all homes. In other business, Norman was a director of a number of companies connected to the coal mining and iron trades industries. Politics Sir Henry Norman Norman was a Liberal Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South from 1900 to 1910, and for Blackburn from 1910 to 1923. He was an advocate for a number of causes, notably women's suffrage. He was created Baronet of Honeyhanger in the Parish of Shottermill in the County of Surrey, in 1915. In 1918 he was admitted to the Privy Council. In January 1910 he was appointed Assistant Postmaster General, a position which fitted well with his interests in wireless communications. He sat on the War Office Committee on Wireless Telegraphy in 1912. In 1914, he became the first President of the Derby Wireless Club, founded in 1911. He was Chairman of the Imperial Wireless Telegraphy Committee from 1919, (The Norman Committee), which recommended wireless communications covering a range of 2,000 miles. He contributed to government committees including chairing a Select Committee on Patent Medicines (specifically advertisements for them and fraudulent claims), on rent restrictions, on betting duty and on industrial paints. He championed the rights and regulation of motorists in the House of Commons even though he had himself been fined for speeding (30 mph) under a scheme he himself had advocated to the Royal Commission. Norman was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Surrey. Norman was a supporter of David Lloyd George, organising the Budget League in support of his People's Budget in 1909-10, personally representing Lloyd George in France on a number of occasions during the First World War, and helping organise the government's campaign during the \\"Coupon Election\\" of 1918.

The transect defines a series of zones that transition from sparse rural farmhouses to the dense urban core. Each zone is fractal in that it contains a similar transition from the edge to the center of the neighborhood. The transect is an important part of the New Urbanism and smart growth movements. Duany's firm DPZ has embodied the transect philosophy into their SmartCode generic planning code for municipal ordinances. The importance of transect planning is particularly seen as a contrast to modern Euclidean zoning and suburban development. In these patterns, large areas are dedicated to a single purpose, such as housing, offices, shopping, and they can only be accessed via major roads. The transect, by contrast, decreases the necessity for long-distance travel by any means.  History  Patrick Geddes, Valley Section, 1909 The concept of the transect was borrowed from ecology. Ecological transects are used to describe changes in habitat over some gradient such as a change in topography or distance from a water body. Patrick Geddes, in his Valley Section of the early 20th century was among the first to proclaim that human settlement should be analyzed in the context of its natural region. Transects were later used by Ian McHarg in Design with Nature.  Breakdown of the Transect  A major feature of transect planning is that it incorporates a variety of residential and commercial spaces into a single neighborhood. A typical neighborhood would consist of a light commercial area with a bank, general store, pub, coffee shop, and apartments. Moving outwards from the center, residential density would gradually decrease starting with apartments to townhouses to fully detached houses. The central area would be a focus of transit and ideally be within walking distance from any point in the neighborhood. The Transect has six zones, moving from rural to urban. It begins with two that are entirely rural in character: Rural preserve (protected areas in perpetuity); and Rural reserve (areas of high environmental or scenic quality that are not currently preserved, but perhaps should be). The transition zone between countryside and town is called the Edge, which encompasses the most rural part of the neighborhood, and the countryside just beyond. The Edge is primarily single family homes. Although Edge is the most purely residential zone, it can have some mixed-use, such as civic buildings (schools are particularly appropriate for the Edge). Next is General, the largest zone in most neighborhoods. General is primarily residential, but more urban in character (somewhat higher density with a mix of housing types and a slightly greater mix of uses allowed). At the urban end of the spectrum are two zones which are primarily mixed use: Center (this can be a small neighborhood center or a larger town center, the latter serving more than one neighborhood); and Core (serving the region — typically a central business district). Core is the most urban zone. The character—from rural to highly urban—of each of the zones in the transect continuum is made up not only of the land uses and activities that take place in that zone, but the degree of development and the typology of that development. In contrast to conventional 20th-century zoning, which was for the most part concerned with land uses and activities and largely ignored issues of typology and community form (also known as urban form), transect-based zoning codes take up the issue of development typology as a principal concern.  Potentials in Implementation  The potential of the transect as an urban planning tool lies in: 1) Education: it is easy to understand 2) Coding: it can be directly translated into the familiar legal framework of Euclidean Zoning districts 3) Immersive environments: this is one where all of the elements of the human environment work together to create something that is greater than the sum of the parts. The transect contains other features: it creates a framework to control and promote growth in certain areas; it intends to increase pedestrian life, local safety, and community identity; and, it provides tools to protect and restore natural environments. A transect is a breakdown of city centre houses out to country houses  Challenges to Implementation  Many of the features of transect planning cannot be reproduced without a change to municipal ordinances. For example, the transect encourages storefronts to push forward to the sidewalk, to allow window shopping, and push parking lots to the rear. In many municipalities, this design would not be permitted today under town planning bylaws. Hence, any effort to implement the principles of the transect must be accompanied by code changes (See the development of SmartCode).

It was the first slogan of a set of reforms that also included perestroika (restructuring), glasnost (transparency), new political thinking, and demokratizatsiya (democratization). In May 1985, Gorbachev gave a speech in Leningrad, during which he admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequacy of living standards. This was the first time in history that a Soviet leader had done so. The program was furthered at the 27th Congress of the Communist Party in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about \\"perestroika\\", \\"uskoreniye\\", \\"human factor\\", \\"glasnost\\", and \\"expansion of the khozraschyot\\" (commercialization). The acceleration was planned to be based on technical and scientific progress, revamping of heavy industry (in accordance with the Marxian economics postulate about the primacy in development of heavy industry over light industry), taking the \\"human factor\\" into account, and increasing the labour discipline and responsibility of apparatchiks. In practice it was implemented with the help of massive monetary emission infused into heavy industry, which further destabilised the economy and in particular brought an enormous disparity between actual cash money and virtual money used in cashless clearings (безналичный расчёт) between enterprises and state and among enterprises. The politics of mere \\"acceleration\\" eventually failed, which was de facto admitted in June 1987 at a Party Plenum, and the \\"uskoreniye\\" slogan was phased out in favor of the more ambitious \\"Perestroika\\" (restructuring of the whole economy).

The temple is located in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture, Japan. The Main Hall is a National Treasure of Japan. Overview The staircase According to the description on , which is enshrined at Hase-dera,The plaque is a designated National Treasure of Japan. the temple was first built in 686 and dedicated to Emperor Tenmu, who was suffering from a disease. Later, in the year 727, the temple was expanded by order of Emperor Shōmu and a statue of the eleven-faced Kannon was placed near the original temple that enshrined the bronze plaque. The temple has been burned down and rebuilt as many as ten times since the 10th century. During the Heian period the temple was favored by members of the nobility, such as the authors of the Kagerō Nikki and the Sarashina Nikki. Hase-dera was consistently popular with visitors, helped by the fact it was situated on what was then the route to the Ise Shrine. Later still, Hase-dera flourished as one of the centers of the reformed Shingon Buddhism, particularly after the arrival of priest Sen'yo from Negoro-ji in 1588. The current Main Hall is a reconstruction of 1650 built using donations from Tokugawa Iemitsu. A covered wooden , 200 metres long, leads to the Hall from the Niō Gate. The temple is especially popular in the spring, when the 700 Chinese peonies that line the staircase are in bloom, and in the fall, when the leaves of the many maple trees in the temple grounds have turned red.

In New York, Susskind formed Talent Associates, representing creators of material rather than performers. Ultimately, Susskind produced movies, stage plays and television programs. =Talk shows= In 1954, Susskind became producer of the NBC legal drama Justice, based on case files of the Legal Aid Society of New York. His program, Open End, began in 1958 on New York City's commercial independent station WNTA-TV, channel 13, the predecessor to WNET, and was appropriately titled: the program continued until Susskind or his guests were too tired to continue.Bowie, Steven Classictvhistory.com retrieved July 20, 2015 In 1961, Open End was constrained to two hours and went into national syndication. The show was retitled The David Susskind Show for its telecast on Sunday night, October 2, 1966. In the 1960s it was the first nationally broadcast television talk show to feature people speaking out against American involvement in the Vietnam War. In the 1970s it was the first nationally broadcast television talk show to feature people speaking out for gay rights. The show continued until its New York outlet cancelled it in 1986, approximately six months before Susskind died. During his almost three decade run, Susskind covered many controversial topics of the day, such as race relations, transsexualism and the Vietnam War. His interview of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, which aired in October 1960, during the height of the Cold War, generated national attention.Bowie, Steven Classictvhistory.com retrieved July 20, 2015 When Russian Premier Nikita Khruschchev appeared on the program during his 1961 visit to the United States, one critic accused Susskind of having \\"tried to tell Khrushchev how to run the Soviet Union.\\" It is one of the very few talk show telecasts from the era that was preserved and can be viewed today. In 1961, Susskind conducted a series of interviews with former President Harry Truman in Truman's hometown of Independence, Missouri. After picking Truman up at his home to take him to the Truman Presidential Library for the interviews over a number of days, Susskind asked Truman why he hadn't been invited into the home. According to presidential historian Michael Beschloss, Truman flatly told Susskind, \\"This is Bess's house\\" and that there had never been nor would there ever be a Jewish guest in there. Joyce Davidson, with whom Susskind was in a relationship, began working as a co- producer of a television talk show Susskind hosted locally in New York called Hot Line in June 1964. It was a different show from the Open End talk show. Hot Line was the first television show to use the recently invented ten-second broadcast delay. This gave the control room time to delete material deemed unfit for broadcast, especially from telephone call-ins. Davidson had a hand in the on-air version of the show and among other duties screened viewer phone calls. She also made the first approach to some of the people who appeared as guests on Hot Line, including Malcolm X, whom she invited for Hot Line immediately after he gave a speech at The Town Hall. Notwithstanding a perhaps courageous willingness to present challenging political issues of his times to audiences, a thorough analysis of his editorial perspective would be incomplete without considering recently unearthed film footage of Susskind's 1968 appearance on The Eamonn Andrews Show, when he excoriated Muhammad Ali with withering criticism for refusing to be conscripted into the U.S. military for the Vietnam War. =Producer= Susskind was also a noted producer, with scores of movies, plays, and TV programs to his credit. His legacy is that of a producer of intelligent material at a time when TV had left its golden years behind and had firmly planted its feet in programming which had wide appeal, whether or not it was worth watching. Among other projects, he produced television adaptations of Beyond This Place (1957), The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1958), The Moon and Sixpence (1960), Ages of Man (1966), Death of a Salesman (also 1966), Look Homeward, Angel (1972), The Glass Menagerie (1973), and Caesar and Cleopatra (1976); the television films Truman at Potsdam (1976), Eleanor and Franklin (1976), and Eleanor and Franklin: The White House Years (1977); and the feature films A Raisin in the Sun (1961), Loving Couples (1980). In 1964, he produced Craig Stevens's acclaimed CBS drama Mr. Broadway, which left the air after thirteen episodes. He also produced and owned all the rights to the 1961 fourteen-episode macabre CBS TV series – Way Out. His production company, Talent Associates, also produced Get Smart. Personal life Susskind was married twice. Both of his marriages ended in divorce. In 1939, he married Phyllis Briskin;Battaglio, p. 8 they had three children: Diana Susskind Laptook, Pamela Susskind Schaenen, and Andrew Susskind.New York Times: \\"Pamela Susskind Is Married to Broker\\" May 6, 1974 They divorced in 1966.Battaglio, p. 152 In the same year he married Joyce Davidson, who had two daughters from a prior marriage,Battaglio, p. 260 \\"After the non-Jewish Joyce Davidson became Susskind's second wife, she learned how to bake challah bread to please her new mother-in-law\\" Connie and Shelley.Battaglio, p. 291 They had a daughter, Samantha Maria Susskind Mannion.New York Times: \\"WEDDINGS; Miss Susskind, Noel Mannion\\" March 7, 1993 They divorced in 1986.Battaglio, p. 334 Susskind was first cousin to television writer and producer Norman Lear. He is survived by his sister, Dorothy Barron, and brother, Murray. Death In 1987 at the age of 66, Susskind suffered a fatal heart attack in New York City. He was interred at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York. Legacy In 1988, Susskind was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. Sources *Battaglio, Stephen.

It was the former seat of the Choctaw Nation government prior to Oklahoma statehood. The population at the 2010 census was 151.CensusViewer:Tuskahoma, Oklahoma Population History A United States Post Office was established at Tushka Homma, Indian Territory on February 27, 1885. On October 28, 1891, the spelling changed to Tushkahomma. On December 6, 1910 the official spelling changed to its present rendering, Tuskahoma. The community has also been served by post office locations at nearby Council House, Oklahoma (1872–1880) and Lyceum, Oklahoma (1896–1900). Council House was located at the Choctaw Capitol Building and Lyceum was located at the former Choctaw Female Academy.George H. Shirk, Oklahoma Place Names, pp. 55, 130, 209-210; Post Office Site Location Reports, Record Group 28, National Archives. Tuskahoma is a compound word meaning “red warrior” in the Choctaw language.Angie Debo, Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic, pp. 158-159. The spelling was originally rendered as \\"Tvshka Homma\\" in an 1852 Choctaw-English dictionary published by a missionary, the Rev. Cyrus Byington. The apparent lower-case \\"v\\" is actually a Greek letter, upsilon, which represents what Byington described as a \\"u short\\" sound.Cyrus Byington, An English and Choctaw Definer: for the Choctaw Academies and Schools (New York: S.W. Benedict, 1852), p. 3. In recent years the Choctaw Nation's official publications have switched to this spelling.The federal government adopted the spelling, \\"Tuskahoma,\\" as early as 1910. Its official arbiter of place names, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names, continues using this spelling. Tuskahoma was designated as (political) capital of the Choctaw Nation in 1882 when an Act of the Choctaw Nation dated October 20, 1882, established the community as the permanent seat of government. The Nation's first capital after the Trail of Tears was at Nanih [Nunih] Waiyah, two miles east of Tuskahoma. [It was named after \\"Nunih Waiyah,\\" a sacred mound in Mississippi where the Choctaw brought the bones of their ancestors to rest and established the tribe. The mound was built by an earlier people, but it became sacred to the Choctaw as well.] Afterward, during a time of constitutional experimentation, the Choctaw shifted their capital from Nanih Waiyah to Doaksville, Skullyville, Fort Towson and Boggy Depot. The Choctaw wartime capital during the American Civil War was located at Armstrong Academy, also known as Chahta Tamaha.Debo, pp. 75-76, 158-159. After the Choctaw Nation decided to make Tuskahoma the permanent capital, it decided to construct an appropriate building to house the government. A spacious Choctaw Capitol Building was completed in the fall of 1884. It was two stories, brick, with a garret under its French mansard roof. Many called it the finest building in the Indian Territory. It included large rooms for the Senate, House of Representatives, and Supreme Court. Also included was an Executive Office for the Principal Chief, or Governor, of the Choctaw Nation, five smaller rooms for the national officers, and five committee rooms. It was heated by numerous fireplaces. Almost immediately a bustling town sprang up by the Capitol building. Several hotels, boarding houses, barber shops, stores, blacksmith shop, photographer's tent, and homes were built. But when the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway built its tracks through the Kiamichi River valley in the mid-1880s, they ran two miles to the south of the Capitol. Business flocked to the vicinity of the new Tuskahoma railroad station and the Capitol precinct was abandoned, except during sessions of the government.Debo, p. 159. This twist of history altered Tuskahoma's prominence. The Choctaw Nation constitution directed the constitutional officers, such as Principal Chief, National Secretary, National Treasurer, National Auditor and National Attorney to reside “at or near the seat of government”, but this provision was never enforced. During the National Council's first session in its new Capitol, the principal chief of the day, J.F. McCurtain, proposed building five homes on the site to accommodate the national officers, but this was never done. In addition to serving as a government center, Tuskahoma was also intended to be a cultural center and was the location of the Choctaw Nation's national girls' school. Tuskahoma Female Academy [or Institute] opened in 1892 at nearby Lyceum with Peter J. Hudson serving as superintendent. The academy, also known as the Choctaw Female Academy, occupied a classical-style two-story colonnaded building. It burned in 1925 and was not rebuilt. [Noted Choctaw educator Anna Lewis, who had attended the school, bought the site and used materials from the ruins to build her family home, which she called Nunih Waiyah.Linda Reese, \\"Dr. Anna Lewis: Historian at Oklahoma College for Women,\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma 82.4 (2004) pp. 428-449] From that time forward Tuskahoma's role as a center of education ceased.Debo, p. 239. Tuskahoma's new site along the railroad prospered, and became a vibrant community and trading center. Banks, hotels, stores, churches, a school, and numerous homes lined its commercial district and residential streets. Its importance began to wane during the middle and later years of the 20th century, as commerce shifted to nearby Clayton, Oklahoma or elsewhere, following the construction of highways and shifting of transport off the railroads.Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps on microfilm, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries. Prior to Oklahoma's statehood, Tuskahoma and the Choctaw Capitol Building were located in Wade County, Choctaw Nation.Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. More information on Tuskahoma may be found in the Pushmataha County Historical Society. Geography Local transportation was revolutionized during the 1950s by the construction of U.S. Highway 271, which provided paved all-weather highway connections to Clayton and the county seat at Antlers, Oklahoma to the east and south, and Talihina, Wilburton and Poteau to the northeast. The Kiamichi River, important as a source of water, is not navigable at Tuskahoma and has never played a role in local transportation. It did, however, cause the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway to place its station at Tuskahoma's present location, due to the trains’ need for a reliable water supply, rather than its original location at the Capitol. The Kiamichi Mountains define life in the Tuskahoma region, which is one of Oklahoma's most scenic. The Kiamichi River valley stretches to the east and west of the community. To the north lie the unusually serrated Potato Hills, with peaks topping out at approximately 1,000 feet in elevation. To the south is a scenic but imposing mountain wilderness, with summits topping off at approximately 1,600 feet in elevation. Here roads do not penetrate and all transportation is via unimproved—but marked and fairly well maintained—timber company roads, including Clayton Trail, Hurd Creek Trail, K Trail, Cripple Mountain Trail and Black Fork Trail. Unusual and striking geological features abound in the Tuskahoma region. Its valley—one of the prettiest in Oklahoma—is of special note. The Potato Hills, a group of tall outcroppings eroded from prehistoric mountains, are a regional landmark. To the north of Tuskahoma lies McKinley Rocks, a series of massive white boulders seemingly strewn across the top of a mountain. Access is difficult, causing a Works Progress Administration survey crew to recommend during the 1930s that the site, while abounding in scenic beauty, should not become a state park due to lack of roads. The rocks, which afford views for miles in any direction, were first noted by a Choctaw survey party during the late 1890s. They are named in honor of the 26th President of the United States, William McKinley.WPA Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries. Choctaw Nation Labor Day Festival The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma holds its annual Labor Day Festival (pow-wow) in Tuskahoma on the grounds of the Capitol building. Attendance ranges from 50,000 - 100,000 over the course of the festival, people coming from all corners of the United States. The festival features various events from country and gospel music concerts to softball games, and pow-wows, arts and crafts, basketball games, strength contests, a carnival, animal shows, horseshoe games, bison tours, volleyball games, a swimming pool, tent and RV grounds, a 5K run, playgrounds, a museum, and numerous other events. During recent years the Choctaw Capitol Building has been recognized as an architecturally and historically significant structure, and has been added to the National Register of Historic Places. It hosts the Choctaw Nation Labor Day Festival and provides the centerpiece for the festivities.

He is particularly known for his efforts to improve Māori health and living conditions. However, Pōmare's career was not without controversy: he negotiated the effective removal of the last of Taranaki Maori land from its native inhabitants - some 18,000 acres - in a move which has been described as the \\"final disaster\\" for his people. He was a member of the Ngati Mutunga iwi originally from North Taranaki; he later lived in Wellington and the Chatham Islands after the 1835 invasion.Penguin History of NZ. Michael King.Penguin 2003. Early life The date of Pōmare's birth is unclear—school records give 24 August 1875 but other sources give 13 January 1876. He was born at a pa near Urenui in Taranaki. His father, Wiremu Naera Pōmare, was of Ngāti Mutunga descent and his mother, Mere Hautonga Nicoll, was of Ngāti Toa descent. His maternal grandmother, Kahe Te Rau-o-te-rangi, had been a signatory of the Treaty of Waitangi. Both of his parents died before he reached adulthood, leaving him in the guardianship of his aunt. Pōmare was the boy injured at Parihaka when a horse trod on his foot.Maori Claims and reinvented history. V. O'Malley. AK University Press, 2005. Education Pōmare attended Christchurch Boys' High School and then Te Aute College. Although his family wanted him to study law Pōmare decided to become a doctor and, in 1895, he began study at a Seventh-day Adventist Church medical college at Battle Creek in the US state of Michigan. He remained in the United States until 1900 and travelled extensively. Department of Health At the time of Pōmare's return to New Zealand there was considerable concern about public health, with the quality of housing and sanitation being a major political issue. The problem was particularly pressing in Māori communities and Pōmare, as one of a small number of trained Māori doctors, was selected to serve as Māori Health Officer in the Department of Health. In this role he undertook a number of major campaigns to improve Māori health and met with considerable success. Pōmare was highly active in the everyday work of his office, often walking to remote villages to give public speeches. His frequent lectures on health matters gave him considerable skill in oratory. In contrast to some of his friends, notably Āpirana Ngata, Pōmare was not particularly concerned about the loss of Māori cultural identity, and sponsored the Tohunga Suppression Act of 1907 which led to loss of many oral traditions. While Pōmare and Ngata agreed on the need to modernise Māori living conditions, Pōmare did not share Ngata's drive to preserve and protect traditional Māori culture and arts—instead Pōmare believed that, eventually, Pākehā and Māori would merge to form a single culture incorporating the best aspects of both (a common ideal of his iwi). Parliament In the 1911 election, Pōmare stood for the House of Representatives as an Independent in the Western Maori electorate that covered the western part of the North Island from Wellington to just south of Auckland, plus the east coast from Tauranga north. Aided by support from the \\"Māori King\\", Mahuta Tāwhiao, he was successful, displacing the incumbent Henare Kaihau. He was aligned with the new Reform Party that had won the largest number of seats. When the party formed a government, Pōmare was appointed in July 1912 to Cabinet as a minister without portfolio, a largely symbolic position. Pōmare was quite popular with his party—in part this is likely because he did not promote an independent Māori cultural identity and that fitted well with the Reform Party's generally conservative views. (Meanwhile, Pōmare's old friend, Āpirana Ngata, was serving as an MP for the opposition Liberal Party.) Taranaki land negotiation In 1881 the crown had set aside 187,000 acres for Taranaki Maori \\"absolutely and for all time\\", by 1911 only 18,000 acres remained and it was being leased to settlers on the behalf of Maori, although in an act of defiance of land confiscation, local Maori never claimed the rent. Both Waikato and Taranaki elected Māui Pōmare as the member for Western Maori to ensure this 18,000 acres would not become freehold settler property in perpetuity. In 1913 Pōmare attempted to appease both his people and pakeha settlers by extending the lease settlers currently had for a further 10 years after which it would revert to Maori ownership - provided they pay compensation to settlers for appreciation in value. In 1923 Maori reclaimed their 18,000 acres but Pōmare had converted the land from leasehold to freehold, something his people were woefully unprepared to deal with. Overwhelmed by a system they didn't understand the Maori sold back to the Pakeha settlers who now had this last 18,000 acres in perpetuity. Late in the first World War Pōmare went to Waahi Pa to fill a conscription quota for Taranaki Maori, on arrival he was greeted in this manner: \\"He was met at the station by a hostile crowd and escorted to the riverside, where he was a spectator of an event never before recorded in European times. When the old-time Maoris wished to demonstrate their most extreme measure of contempt for any person they danced a haka standing naked and waist-high in a river and at appropriate times in the dance turned their posteriors towards the unwelcome visitor. There were no greater depths of ignominy in the Maori repertoire of insults - it was the absolute in loathing and contumely. Such was the spectacle confronting the Member for Western Maori...\\" World War I During World War I Pōmare and Ngata joined forces to encourage Māori to join the armed forces. Pōmare and Ngata both believed that by participating strongly in the war and fighting to defend the country, Māori would demonstrate to Pākehā that they were full citizens. Pōmare angered many of his constituents, however, by extending conscription to Maori under the Military Service Act. Ministerial career In April 1916, Pōmare was given ministerial responsibility for the Cook Islands, then a New Zealand territory. He lobbied strongly for more funding to be given to the islands and was responsible for considerable infrastructural improvement. He opposed, however, the idea of self-governance for the islands, saying that they were not yet ready for it. On a number of occasions he overrode laws passed by the islands' own council, causing a certain amount of complaint. On the whole, however, he was well regarded in the Cook Islands, being presented with a silver cup at the end of his service. Later, in May 1925, Pōmare was appointed Minister of Health, his highest office. Due to economic problems the Health Department's budget was low, making it difficult for Pōmare to effect any important reforms. Nevertheless, he managed to make gains in some areas, particularly maternity care and equipment sterilisation. Pōmare was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1920 New Year Honours and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in the 1922 Birthday Honours. Later life Maui and Miria Pōmare passport application (1930) In 1928 Pōmare contracted tuberculosis. In the 1928 election Āpirana Ngata conducted Pōmare's campaign on his behalf, despite belonging to the opposition party. Pōmare was re-elected. Later Pōmare travelled to California in the hope that the climate would be good for his health. He died in Los Angeles on 27 June 1930. Legacy Māui Pōmare day (Te Ra o Māui Pōmare) is celebrated every year at Owae Marae in Waitara, Taranaki on the Saturday closest to the anniversary of his death. The day recognises his work in health reforms, politics and especially his investigation of Maori land confiscations. Māui Pōmare day is also of significance to Samoa. In 1927 Pōmare spoke out in Parliament speeches against New Zealand's methods in dealing with Samoa's resistance movement, and this was recognised at the 2013 Māui Pōmare day. In celebrating 150 years of The New Zealand Herald, the newspaper named him New Zealander of the year for 1926, for his work on Maori land grievances. The Herald gave him the same award again for 1927, for his work as Health Minister that led to fewer deaths of women at childbirth.

Tirah lies between the Khyber Pass and the Khanki Valley. It is inhabited by the Afridi, Orakzai and Shinwari tribes of Pashtuns. The ancient inhabitants of Tirah and the surrounding area, who were non-Pashtun Dardics, are known as Tirahis. Society The population is rural, while Bagh Malikdinkhel, located in Maidan Tirah, is the traditional meeting place for Afridi jirgas or assemblies. Lying close to the Pak-Afghan border and difficult terrain, control of Tirah for the government of Pakistan has been difficult. In 2003, for the first time since the independence of Pakistan, Army troops entered the Tirah valley.Waziristan: Bin Laden's hiding place? - BBC News It is also an area where the government has been trying to cut down on poppy cultivation.In pictures: Pakistan drug farming the dominant ethnic group here are the Pashtuns. There are minority communities of referred to as Hamsaya (protected peoples) such as the Sikh community who are mainly involved in trading and other professions.In pictures: Valley of change - BBC History The Tirah Valley is verdant. The original inhabitants of Tirah were the Tirahis, who were driven out of the country by Pir Roshan; and a remnant of them fled to Nangrahar. Soon afterwards, in 1619 or 1620, Mahabat Khan, Subahdar of Kabul under the emperor Jahangir, treacherously massacred 300 Daulatzai Orakzai, who were Roshania converts; and, during his absence on a visit to Jahangir at Rohtas, Ghairat Khan was sent with a large force via Kohat to invade Tirah. He advanced to the foot of the Sampagha pass, which was held by the Roshanias under Ihdad and the Daulatzai under Malik Tor.Tīrāh - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 389. The Rajputs attacked the former and the latter were assailed by Ghairat Khan's own troops, but the Mughal forces were repulsed with great loss. Six years later, however, Muzaffar Khan, son of Khwaja Abdul Hasan, then Sibahddr of Kabul, marched against Ihdad by the Sugawand pass and Gardez, and after five or six months' fighting Ihdad was shot and his head sent to Jahangir. His followers then took refuge in the Lowaghar; and subsequently Abdul Kadir, Ihdad's son, and his widow Alai, returned to Tirah. The death of Jahangir in 1627 was the signal for a general rising of the Pashtuns against the Mughal domination. Muzaffar Khan was attacked on his way from Peshawar to Kabul, and severely handled by the Orakzai and Afridis, while Abdul Kadir attacked Peshawar, plundered the city, and invested the citadel. Abdul Kadir was, however, compelled by the jealousy of the Afghans to abandon the siege and retire to Tirah, whence he was induced to come into Peshawar. There he died in 1635. The Mughals sent a fresh expedition against his followers in Tirah ; and Yusuf, the Afridi, and Asar Mir, the Omkzai chief, were at length induced to submit, and received lands at Panipat near Delhi. Simultaneously operations were undertaken in Kurram. Yet, in spite of these measures, Mir Yakut, the imperial Diwan at Peshawar, was sent to Tirah in 1658 to repress an Orakzai and Afridi revolt. Since the decay of the Mughal empire Tirah has been virtually independent, though owning at times a nominal allegiance to Kabul. Tirah was chiefly notable as the scene of the Tirah Campaign that the British launched in 1897. It was a cul-de-sac in the mountains and the difficulty of its passes and the fierceness of its inhabitants had hitherto preserved it inviolable from all invaders. According to a legend a group of Pashtuns living in Tirah, the Orakzai, got their name from an exiled prince from far away Persia.\\"Census of India, 1901, Volume 17, Part 1\\" by India Census Commissioner, Edward Albert Gait. Published by the Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, India, 1902. Pg 149. They include 18 tribes. Those 18 tribes are collectively known as Orakzai. But the greater part of Tirah's population belong to the Afridi tribe. A sub tribe known as the Oriya Khel belonged to the Zaka Khel clan of the Afridi tribe. They inhabited the Tirah Valley and are now located in Cherat Saleh Khana. Although they now fall under the Khattak tribe, the Oriya Khel acknowledge their lineage and still continue to call themselves afridi. This can be proven as the land records of Saleh Khana showed they initially belonged to afridis and to this day the inhabitants have not changed. further more the villagers of saleh khana still wear their turbans and grow their moustache like afridis, customs which have been passed down by the elders.  Geography  Tirah comprises an area of some six to seven hundred square miles and includes under this general name all the valleys lying round the source of the Bara River. The five chief valleys are Maidan, Rajgul, Waran, Bara and Mastura. Maidan, the summer home of the Afridis, lies close under the snow-bound ridges of the Safed Koh at an elevation of about . It is an oval plain about seven to eight miles (13 km) long, and three or four wide, and slopes inwards towards the centre of its northern side, where all the drainage gathered from the four corners of the plain is shot into a narrow corkscrew outlet leading to the Bara Valley. Centuries of detritus accumulated in this basin have filled it up with rich alluvial soil and made it one of the most fertile valleys on the frontier. All its alluvial slopes are terraced and revetted and irrigated till every yard is made productive. Here and there dotted about in clusters all over the plain are square-built two storey mud and timber houses, standing in the shade of gigantic walnut and mulberry trees. Up on the hillsides surrounding the Maidan basin are wild olives in wide-grown clumps, almost amounting to forest, and occasional pomegranates. Higher still are the blue pines; but below on the shelving plains are nothing but fruit trees. Rajgul Valley lies north of Maidan, from which it is separated by a steep valley and well-wooded spur, eight to nine thousand feet high, and west of the Bara Valley, which it joins at Dwatoi. It is ten miles (16 km) long, four to five miles (8 km) at its widest, and has an elevation of . It is inhabited by the Kuki Khel Afridis. The Waran Valley is another valley about the same size as Maidan, lying east of it, and separated from it by the Tseri-Kandao Pass. It was the home of the Afridi mullah Sayad Akbar. and is the country of the Aka Khels. After the junction of the Rajgul and Maidan drainage at Dwatoi, the united stream receives the name of Bara, and the valley through which it flows down to its exit in the Peshawar Valley is also known by this name. The elevation of the valley is from . at Dwatoi to 2000 at Kajurai; on the north side it is hemmed in by the Surghar range, which divides it from the Bazar Valley; on the south lies another range dividing it from Maidan and the Waran Valley. The heat of the Bara Valley in summer is said to be excessive, malaria is prevalent, and mosquitoes very troublesome, so the hamlets are deserted and the Afridis migrate to the pleasant heights of Maidan. The Mastura Valley occupies the southern half of Tirah, and is inhabited by the Orakzais. It is one of the prettiest valleys on the frontier, lying at an elevation of . The Orakzais live, for the most part, in the Miranzai Valley, in the winter, and retreat to Mastura, like the Afridis, during the summer months. The chief passes in Tirah are the Sampagha Pass (6,500 ft), separating the Khanki Valley from the Mastura Valley; the Arhanga Pass (6,99E ft.), separating Mastura Valley from Maidan; Saran Sar (8,650 ft), leading from the Zakka Khel portion of Maidan into the Bara Valley; the Tseri Kandao (8,575 ft), separating Maidan from the Waran Valley, and the Sapri Pass (5,190 ft), leading from the east of the Mastura Valley into the Bara Valley in the direction of Mamanai. The whole of Tirah was thoroughly explored and mapped at the time of the Tirah Expedition.

He is the creator of two brands of yoga, Kripalu Yoga and I AM Yoga, and is the founder of five yoga and health centers in the US. His yoga training programs have reached more than 40 countries worldwide and over 8,000 teachers have been certified. Homegrown Gurus (2013) states: \\"Although Desai has not received scholarly attention, he has arguably been one of the most influential and sought-after figures in the development of Hatha Yoga in America over the last 40 years.\\"Ellen Goldberg, Amrit Desai and the Kripalu Center, Homegrown Gurus, State University of New York, 2013. Biography =Early life= Born on October 16, 1932, Amrit Desai is the second son of Chimanlal, a village merchant, and Buribhen Desa in Pratappura in Gujarat, India. When Amrit was ten, the family moved to Halol. At age 15, he met his guru, Swami Kripalvananda (Bapuji), a wandering sadhu who was offering free talks on the Bhagavad Gita in Halol.Lila Ivey, Bikram Choudhury and Mickey Singer, Ancient Wisdom, Modern Master, 2012 Radha Krishna by Desai Desai taught himself yoga asana (postures) from a chart he found tacked to the wall of the local gym. He started teaching others outside the cowshed where his guru lived. After the swami observed him teaching one day, he allowed him to witness his private sadhana. The swami went into a trance-like state and began to perform movements unlike anything he had seen on the asana charts. Desai recalls: \\"The pranic energy became so strong his body was hurled across the room with tremendous force. As I watched in awe, he was dancing, weaving in and out of complicated asanas.\\" After studying engineering and training with the Indian Air Force in Madras, Desai returned to Halol and took a job teaching art at the local high school. He married his betrothed, Urmila Shah, in January 1955. The couple moved to Ahmedabad a year later where he earned his art diploma over the next four years.Gene Thursby, Hindu Movements Since Mid-Century, America's Alternative Religions, State University of New York, 1995 They had three children between 1959 and 1968. He saved enough money to travel to America, and in February 1960, arrived at the Philadelphia College of Art with only enough money in his pocket to cover his first semester's tuition and rent. By teaching yoga and washing dishes alongside his studies, he saved enough money to bring his wife and infant son to the US two years later. =Art career= Bridal Celebration by Desai Graduating in 1964 with a degree in fine arts and design from the Philadelphia College of Art, he took a job with a textile firm. His watercolor paintings won awards at art shows including at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He created distinct textures and patterns with razor blades and eye-droppers. While still an art student, he played the flute in a \\"Music of India\\" concert at the Commercial Museum (Philadelphia Trade and Convention Center) in 1961.Exotic Music of India played at Concert Here, The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 6, 1961 =Yoga pioneer= From left: Swami Satchidananda, B.K.S. Iyengar, Amrit Desai, Shri Kumar-swami, Swami Dhirendra Brahmachari, and Dr B.I. Atreya at the World Conference on Scientific Yoga, 1970. New Delhi, India. Desai started teaching yoga in the early 1960s in the Philadelphia area while still an art student. In 1966 during his first visit to India since coming to the US, Swami Kripalvananda gave him initiation and further instruction in kundalini yoga. Returning to the US, he left his job to form The Yoga Society of Pennsylvania and teach yoga full-time. In 1970, he claimed to have had a Kundalini awakening experience that revealed to him that Patanjali's Yoga Sutras are a manual for the practice of Ashtanga Yoga rather than mere philosophy. Out of this experience Desai created a form of hatha yoga called Kripalu Yoga, named in honor of his guru. His Meditation in Motion approach is based on the practical application of Patanjali's Ashtanga Yoga in daily life. The system combines two traditional paths of yoga: the rigorous discipline of Ashtanga yoga with the path of initiation and surrender that is Kundalini yoga. In this system, the student begins with the practice of willful discipline and gradually moves on to the more advanced practice of surrender to prana. To date, Desai is the founder of five yoga and health centers in the US, and co- founder of a university of Ayurvedic sciences. In 1966, the not-for-profit Yoga Society of Pennsylvania was formed. By 1970, it had trained 44 teachers and had grown to 150 Yoga classes, attended by more than 2,500 students per week, in southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware, and southern New Jersey, making it one of the largest Yoga organizations at that time.Yoga Group Lists 2,500 Followers, Philadelphia Inquirer, December 1970 In 1972, the first Kripalu Ashram was founded in Sumneytown, PA. The 50-acre property was purchased to fulfill the growing demand among students for a yogic lifestyle experience. Desai reduced his teaching to once per week to make time for higher yoga practice. The ashram also became a program center that provided the volunteer residential staff and teachers the in-depth study and practice of yoga, along with a yogic lifestyle. A variety of health, yoga and spiritual trainings and programs were offered. As the demand for programs grew, the residential staff grew from 37 to 70. In 1974, Desai spent three months in seclusion at a small cottage on the property that came to be known as Muktidham. Upon his return, he was greeted by 350 disciples, mostly dressed in white, some of whom had traveled from as far away as Detroit, Chicago and Montreal for the celebration.The Day The Guru Came Down From The Mountain, Today (The Philadelphia Inquirer magazine), May 5, 1974 In 1976, an additional ashram in Summit Station, PA was opened to accommodate the growth in program participants and volunteer staff. As a result, the program center grew to provide a greater variety of programs, and the residential staff grew to 150. In 1983, the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health was founded in Lenox, MA. The staff of Summit Station was transferred to Lenox, and soon grew to 350 full- time resident staff. By 1994 Kripalu Yoga teachers were teaching in 50 states and 45 countries worldwide, and it was described as the world's largest yoga and health center. The Amrit Yoga Institute in Salt Springs, FL was founded in 2001, and currently operates as an ayurvedic healing and yoga retreat center. Regular yoga teacher trainings are offered in the Integrative Amrit Method, or the I AM techniques. In 2014, he co-founded the International University of Yoga and Ayurveda that offers accredited training programs in the US and in India. A Shaktipat lineage Swami Kripalu (Bapuji) Mahasamadhi shrine at Malav ashram, Gujarat, India Yogi Desai was initiated into the secrets of Shaivite kundalini yoga by his guru, Swami Kripalu (Kripalvananda), a master of tantric sadhana. There are numerous documented accounts of energetic transmission or shaktipat experienced in his presence. D. R. Butler describes a meditation led by Desai at a week-long retreat with about 200 attendees at the 1973 ICSA Yoga Convocation, where Desai was an unannounced guest: Dr David Frawley stated: In the afterword to Ancient Wisdom, Modern Master, Mickey Singer described a meeting with Desai during which his heart chakra was \\"permanently opened\\" by \\"the simple touch of Amrit's hand.\\" Controversy The Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health was an Ashram. One of the spiritual practices that the single residents were expected to practice was celibacy (brahmacharya). Although sex within marriage was condoned at the ashram, after his third child was born in 1968, Desai declared that he would now practice celibacy too. A large celebration was held for this event. So important was this practice of celibacy that occasionally meetings were held and residents were asked to divulge anyone they thought might have violated that sacred practice. As a result, some residents were kicked out of the community. The irony was that the two most senior members of the community, including Desai, were practicing adultery. After years of infidelity with numerous people, in 1994, it was revealed and admitted that Desai had had sexual contact with at least three female resident disciples and was forced to resign his position as Spiritual Director. Then in an open letter to the Kripalu community, Desai stated, \\"More than anything I want Kripalu to remain a spiritual home for many. I want you to know that we came to this decision together… I deeply regret any suffering I have caused to the people directly involved and to the entire Kripalu family.\\" Post-Kripalu years and the Amrit Yoga Institute Amrit Yoga Institute in Salt Springs, Florida. When Michael A. Singer, a long- time supporter and host of Desai's seminars, heard that Desai had left the Kripalu community, he invited him and his wife to spend some quiet time living with the Temple of the Universe community in Alachua, Florida. The Desais arrived in December 1994 and stayed on the property for the better part of three years.Michael A. Singer, The Surrender Experiment, 2015 Desai resumed teaching in 1996 at the original Kripalu Ashram in Sumneytown, PA. After a couple of years, mostly in PA, the Desai family relocated to Salt Springs, Florida in 2002, where Yogi Desai currently teaches at the Amrit Yoga Institute, a beautiful lakeside retreat on the banks of Lake Kerr in the Ocala National Forest. Amrit Yoga Institute is an ashram where the guru-disciple relationship continues to flourish and residents enjoy the benefits of a traditional yogic lifestyle. Programs of varying length are offered for yoga teacher training, ayurveda, and recovery. Kripalu, while no longer an ashram, continues to operate and is presently one of the largest yoga and health centers in North America, offering a wide range of programs and professional trainings in health, spirituality, yoga, and more.

The vast majority of Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters participated in the merger. Phi Sigma Kappa incorporated many of the symbols of Phi Sigma Epsilon into its own, changing its crest, and expanding its Cardinal Principals, symbolism, rituals and historical canon to embrace the milestones of Phi Sigma Epsilon's development. These changes were soon fully adopted by all chapters of the improved, and much larger fraternity, retaining the older name, Phi Sigma Kappa. The two fraternities viewed it a happy, even auspicious coincidence that both groups had until the merger generally used the nickname, \\"Phi Sig.\\" This was found to be just one of many striking similarities. A few chapters and scattered alumni refused the Merger, eventually settling on a plan to form a new national fraternity Phi Sigma Phi (ΦΣΦ), incorporating traditions similar to the original Phi Sigma Epsilon. History The Phi Sigma Epsilon Fraternity (ΦΣΕ) was founded on 20 February 1910 at Kansas State Normal College, now Emporia State University. \\"The early years of Phi Sigma Epsilon were stormy ones for there was much opposition to secret societies\\" at the school; the fraternity had to exist as an underground organization, frowned upon by many of the college authorities and citizens, until 1912. However, the fraternity's willingness to cooperate, and its program of scholastic and social improvements, won over support and admiration.

From the resulting union of these three chapters, ΦΣΕ became a \\"national teachers college fraternity\\" at its first Conclave on December 30, 1927, keeping the eldest name. A group of members developed the charter, constitution and bylaws. Others, led by Fred Schwengel, authored the fraternity's new ritual over the following year. In 1932, the fraternity began its publication of The Triangulum, a magazine for members. In 1937, after a year of negotiations between the teachers college men's fraternities, Phi Sigma Epsilon worked with Sigma Tau Gamma (ΣΤΓ) to form the Association of Teachers College Fraternities on January 9, 1937. =The War Years: Closing and Reopening= The fraternity expanded to many other campuses until World War II, when an acute manpower crisis caused every chapter to cease operations between 1941 and 1946. Under the leadership of National President Shannon Flowers, however, the fraternity was successfully revived after the war. It was noteworthy and probably un-equaled in the fraternity world that all chartered Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters were able to reopen after WWII. With the mass influx of returning GIs to its schools, and with the expansion of mission at those schools beyond the teaching profession, by 1947, Phi Sigma Epsilon similarly broadened its focus, no longer to remain strictly a fraternity for teachers, but to embrace the general academic population. In 1952 the fraternity became a junior member of the NIC, and in 1965, a senior member. Throughout its history approximately half of the Fraternity's chapters came from affiliating local chapters, some that had existed for many decades prior to joining Phi Sigma Epsilon.Where known, these are noted in the references for each chapter on the List of Phi Sigma Kappa chapters, with information taken from All the Phi Sigs, the history of the combined fraternity of Phi Sigma Kappa and Phi Sigma Epsilon. In most cases it is evident that these former locals became the strongest or most resilient chapters. The others, started as new groups on campus, were often short-lived, especially those formed from 1950 onward. =Growth and Decline= Phi Sigma Epsilon had an unofficial goal of having sixty chapters, a milestone it reached under the leadership of president James Whitfield by doubling in size between 1958 and 1970. Whitfield retired in 1970, after an unprecedented term of twelve years as president. This was the high-water mark for the fraternity. On February 20, 1970, the actual 60th anniversary of the founding was observed in Emporia. Founder and first initiate, Fred Thompson, along with James Whitfield, cut the anniversary cake, which bore seven candles in representation of the seven founders. Thompson was 86 years old at the 23rd Conclave, on September 5 of that year. By 1972, growth had ceased while expenses grew, and, like many fraternities, Phi Sigma Epsilon had difficulty managing its chapters in that time of social change. Lack of fraternity interest on its campuses was another contributing factor. Attempts were made to innovate, for example, by hosting regionalized Conclaves rather than a single national meeting, and with early automation of address records. By the beginning of the 1978–79 academic year, there were but 38 chapters on the roll, nine fewer than in 1974 and 22 fewer than in 1970. This alarming situation precipitated aggressive action to shore up or re-charter struggling groups, which lead to some success: by the 1980 Conclave there were 45 chapters, up from 38. Yet fiscal problems and rolling staff difficulties continued to weaken the fraternity. Complaints came in from various chapters of dissatisfaction with services and a lack of cooperation from the national office. Between 1980 and 1984, significant concerns, too, were raised about the financial health of the organization. Executive officer Ric Hoskin, who had served since the mid-60s, resigned on July 28, 1984. An emergency Council meeting was called, and, after the appointment of president John Sandwell to replace Hoskin as acting executive officer on an interim basis, a late audit confirmed the Council's worst fears: Phi Sigma Epsilon had only its equity in its national headquarters building which could be termed an asset. One month later, at a belated and hastily called 30th Conclave, James Whitfield was again elected to serve as president. The following day, immediate past president Sandwell resigned from the position he had retained, that of executive officer. The Council named Whitfield acting executive officer without compensation. Whitfield immediately moved to establish effective communications throughout the order as a major priority. Yet the point of crisis was long past; by that fateful 30th Conclave, the discussion of what might yet be done was passionate and no option would prove to be easy. Leaders scheduled a series of meetings, considering all aspects of revitalization, and recessed the Conclave until the summer of 1985. The fall ushered in a flurry of activity, with plans for a follow-up Council meeting and publication of a series of chapter bulletins to teach the basics of fraternity management. =The Merger= In a curious stroke of timing, only a few months after the fall 1984 Council meeting, president James Whitfield attended an NIC meeting on Dec. 1, 1984, where he met for the first time Phi Sigma Kappa's grand president, Anthony Fusaro. They were seated next to each other due to the alphabetized seating of all the fraternities. The two leaders \\"discussed their respective fraternities, and Whitfield learned that two PSE chapters (Phi Epsilon at Rider College, Lawrenceville NJ and Epsilon Tau at Ball State Univ, Muncie IN) had contacted PSK during the 1983-84 year, seeking assistance from PSK (also HQ'd in Indianapolis, IN) because of 'the lack of services from PSE.' The NIC rule [prohibiting this] had been explained to these chapters by PSK Executive Director, Brett Champion, and President Fusaro [had] contacted then-PSE National President John Sandwell to offer assistance. In the [recent] transfer of PSE leadership from Sandwell to Whitfield, this information had not been relayed, so all of this was news to Whitfield.\\" A friendship developed, in this meeting of peers. The word \\"merger\\" was mentioned, and the two statesmen agreed to talk further, enlarging the sensitive and respectful conversation with a half dozen or more fraternal leaders from both groups. These men realized the profound similarities between the fraternities, and set a framework in place to continue the discussion, beginning by polling the interest of both executive councils. A favorable response by both groups led to further concrete steps, and merger documents were prepared. Soon, an overwhelmingly positive response came from a letter PSE wrote to its chapters and alumni clubs, with 26 of 29 respondents declaring in the affirmative, two negative votes, both from alumni clubs, and one un-indicated. Phi Sigma Epsilon was scheduled to resume its Conclave on June 1, 1985. The evening prior, the Council met to review general fraternity operations, but final decisions on all items were to be deferred until action on the merger vote. There was significant division of opinion, and the various Council members were lobbied well into the evening. Yet, the following day, the final vote came down 40 to 39 in favor of the merger, with active chapters more strongly supporting the action, and alumni less inclined. Of the larger chapters, these broke significantly for the merger. Phi Sigma Epsilon's 31st and last Conclave's final vote was the unanimous selection of James Whitfield to sign and implement the merger documents. It was announced that Phi Sigma Kappa had already voted by mail overwhelmingly in favor of the merger, an action that was ratified at its 50th Convention by a unanimous vote, held later that summer on August 14, 1985. With the merger, all Phi Sigma Epsilon alumni were welcomed into equal status in Phi Sigma Kappa. A vigorous plan was set in motion to 'onboard' all active chapters of Phi Sigma Epsilon as Phi Sigma Kappa chapters. All living past presidents of Phi Sigma Epsilon were inducted into Phi Sigma Kappa's Court of Honor. PSE past president Shannon Flowers became its Recorder. James Whitfield and Larry Beck of Phi Sigma Epsilon were immediately placed onto an enlarged Grand Council as directors, with PSE's Ron Cowan, Jr. joining that body in 1987. Scott Hull of PSE was brought on as a fourth Leadership Consultant on staff, and the man who had witnessed the formation of PSE as a national fraternity and written its ritual in 1927, past president, Fred Schwengel, agreed to serve as an Historian for the combined fraternity and as a trustee of the PSK Foundation. Guided by the two men who knew the two rituals best, past-president Fred Schwengel and Grand President Anthony Fusaro, Phi Sigma Kappa's Ritual of Association was rewritten to include significant portions of the Phi Sigma Epsilon ritual. The PSE ritual itself was cast into the form of a special lecture to be added to the ritual book of all chapters for use on particular occasions. Similarly, Phi Sigma Kappa's Cardinal Principals were amended to reflect the ideals of Phi Sigma Epsilon: Justice, Wisdom and Honor. As planned, aggressive action was taken over the next several years to assist former PSE chapters in their transition to the revised ritual, operations and requirements of the greatly enlarged fraternity. The fraternity agreed to honor the badges and words of recognition of both fraternities when presented by visiting alumni. At the 1987 Convention the Phi Sigma Kappa flag and crest were changed to incorporate the symbolism of Phi Sigma Epsilon, thus formally finalizing the merger. While most Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters, their alumni and most current and past national officers took part in the merger, a small percentage of active chapters did not. Several chapters were later found to be non-viable or recently dormant. One was released to join another national organization due to the presence of both chapters on campus. In the end, seven groups who did not wish to take part in the merger decided to form their own fraternity, Phi Sigma Phi, in 1988. =Historical Record= Mergers are rare in the fraternity world. A cursory reading of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities will show that, far more often, groups that eventually fail will stubbornly decline into a shadow of what they once were, losing their last, lingering chapters in a rush into oblivion, or to individual chapter dispersal or absorption. It is a lesson of mature management to know when to 'wind down' any institution, especially one that is a labor of love. From this perspective, it appears that Phi Sigma Epsilon's leaders understood the risk of total loss for a struggling 75-year-old fraternity. By pressing forward with merger talks in spite of some opposition, proponents saved much of the history, continuity and culture of Phi Sigma Epsilon, blending its real strengths into the resulting combined fraternity. Because of the foresight and determination of leaders from both fraternities, Phi Sigma Epsilon remains a cherished part of Phi Sigma Kappa, and thousands of young men annually learn its history, as part of a larger, better Phi Sig. The record of Phi Sigma Epsilon's rise, long life and eventual merger is available in All The Phi Sigs, a history of both groups, revised in 1993 with a lengthy new section on Phi Sigma Epsilon (pp 179 – 212). Until this publication, Phi Sigma Epsilon had never prepared a comprehensive written history. James Whitfield, past president of PSE and Phil Baird, former PSE Council member, volunteered to write this document. As many of the records of the fraternity were lost to flooding at PSE's former headquarters building, their job was difficult; yet as participants at a high level for many years, they, with the help of leaders they interviewed, such as former national presidents Shannon Flowers, Larry Beck and Fred Schwengel, were able to complete the highly detailed work. This volume is available from Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity headquarters for all the Phi Sigs. From 1985 onward, the continuing history of Phi Sigma Epsilon may be found within Phi Sigma Kappa's record. Active Chapters of ΦΣΕ Who Became Active Chapters of ΦΣΚ at the Merger All Active ΦΣΕ chapters were welcomed into ΦΣΚ, and most joined. These are listed below. A very few opted immediately to decline, and a few others deliberated on the matter between 1985 and 1987, eventually choosing to revert to local status in anticipation of the entity that would become Phi Sigma Phi. Still other chapters were at a level of disorganization or actual dormancy that, on those campuses, there was no one left: no chapter existed to merge. For the groups that declined the Merger, and for the long-dormant groups, listed separately, Phi Sigma Kappa has continued to reach out the hand of brotherhood to alumni of those chapters.The list of chapters was compiled by ΦΣΚ staff over time, with assistance of former ΦΣΕ officers. See the List of Phi Sigma Kappa Chapters for a comprehensive treatment. However, the chapters listed on this page show the outcome of merger activity for the \\"Epsilon\\" chapters, and subsequent opening and closing of chapters whose origination was in Phi Sigma Epsilon.

Inactive Chapters of ΦΣΕ at the Merger, now part of Phi Sigma Kappa These chapters were closed in the years prior to the merger, or in the waning years of Phi Sigma Epsilon as the merger approached. Some have organized alumni, depending on their relative strength during their active years. Phi Sigma Kappa continues to serve their alumni with news and support staff where the Fraternity has good addresses.

The chapter is missing in Hills and a Star's list through 2013, missing from Baird's Manual, and only found in the published chapter list on pg250 of All the Phi Sigs. On p255 ATPS notes that Omicron's (Epsilon Omicron's) charter was \\"revoked\\". :* Epsilon Sigma (ΕΣ) Chapter at Northern Illinois University, DeKalb, Illinois -Closed in 1973. PSK has existing chapter on campus, alumni merged :* Epsilon Psi (ΕΨ) Chapter at SUNY Geneseo, Geneseo, New York -Seceded in 1953 with ban on national fraternities but continued operating as Phi Sigma Epsilon until 1992 when it changed its name to Phi Sigma Xi.

PSK could recolonize as Phi Xi :* Phi Tau (ΦΤ) Chapter at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York -Released in 1985, affiliated with Theta Chi. Since then, closed in 1999. PSK has existing chapter on campus, alumni mergedThere exists some confusion regarding two chapters named Phi Tau. ΦΣΕ's Phi Tau chapter at Cornell, existent from 1963 until the merger in 1985 when it was released and affiliated with Theta Chi, should not be confused with ΦΣΚ's Tau chapter at Dartmouth, which, upon seceding from the national fraternity in 1956, renamed itself Phi Tau purely by coincidence. :* Phi Rho (ΦΡ) Chapter at Chadron State College, Chadron, Nebraska -Closed in 19xx.

PSK could recolonize as Phi Psi Chapter names listed in order of chartering. Some names do not follow standard Greek alphabetical order. See List of Phi Sigma Kappa chapters for chartering dates Previous Chapters of ΦΣΕ Which Immediately Moved to Form Phi Sigma Phi Organization took several years, and the eventual name of the new fraternity was not determined until ΦΣΚ and the non-merging chapters resolved trademark and copyright issues. Bold for current active chapters, italic for dormant chapters. * Lambda (Λ) Chapter at Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan - Alumni only seceded in 1985. This chapter resulted in both the ΦΣΚ chapter called Epsilon Lambda, which was a continuation of the active group, and ΦΣΦ's Lambda Chapter which was established by a group of recent PSE alumni who chose not to merge. Oddly enough, ΦΣΦ later colonized and chartered a chapter at the University of Michigan-Dearborn that would become known as Epsilon Lambda. As if that wasn't confusing enough, an earlier, dormant ΦΣΚ Chi Pentaton chapter on the campus contributed its alumni to the newly named ΦΣΚ chapter, but not its chapter name, as it was younger. * Omega (Ω) Chapter at UW Stout, Menomonie, Wisconsin. Seceded from Phi Sig in 1985. ΦΣΚ's planned name for this chapter would have been Epsilon Omega. * Phi Mu (ΦΜ) Chapter at Concord University, Athens, West Virginia. Seceded from Phi Sig in 1985. ΦΣΚ's planned name for this chapter would also have been Phi Mu. Three additional chapters were revived for a time, going on to form the Founding Seven of ΦΣΦ. These three have all since closed: :* Phi Kappa (ΦΚ) Chapter at West Virginia Wesleyan College, Buckhannon, West Virginia -Seceded in 1985, then left Phi Sigma Phi in 1997 to join ΑΣΦ.Twelve years after the PSK/PSE merger, the West Virginia Wesleyan chapter broke ties with PSP, according to their website accessed 27 January 2016. They explain that in 1997, 26 active brothers of the Phi Kappa Chapter left Phi Sigma Phi and petitioned for a charter to become the Beta Nu chapter of Alpha Sigma Phi (NIC) national fraternity in 1998. This group remains an active chapter of ΑΣΦ. At the time, Phi Sigma Phi was not an NIC fraternity. (Phi Sigma Phi joined the NIC soon after; The NIC prohibits such 'poaching' of whole chapters.) ΦΣΚ's planned name for this chapter was also Phi Kappa. :* Phi Iota (ΦΙ) Chapter at Northland College, Ashland, Wisconsin -Inactive at Merger, alumni seceded in 1985, colonized by 1988, then closed after 1990.A chapter graduate from 1990 noted the fraternity's interest in recolonization in an October 2017 post to the campus alumni website. ΦΣΚ's planned name for this chapter was also Phi Iota. :* Sigma Zeta (ΣΖ) Chapter at UW River Falls, River Falls, Wisconsin -Inactive at Merger, alumni seceded in 1985, colonized under the un-named new fraternity in 1986, took PSP name in 1988, returned to Phi Sigma Kappa for a 1996 ΦΣΚ colonization, then closed in 2005. ΦΣΚ's name for this chapter was also Sigma Zeta. One more chapter of the Founding Seven has also recently gone dormant: :* Phi Beta (ΦΒ) Chapter at the UW Eau Claire, Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Seceded from Phi Sig in 1985. Closed between 2011 and 2015. ΦΣΚ's planned name for this chapter would also have been Phi Beta.Regarding Phi Beta Chapter, a campus directory noted the chapter's existence in the 2009-10 school year. A PSP Facebook post noted them as an expansion candidate in 2015. Later Phi Sigma Phi Activity, and Naming Confusion There is no legal connection between Phi Sigma Phi and Phi Sigma Kappa, nor their respective chapters, even if there is occasional similarity between chapter names. There is no formal agreement on 'naming rights' between PSK and PSP, thus each fraternity is free to name its chapters as it sees fit. Following its formation in 1988, Phi Sigma Phi placed several new chapters on campuses new to any Phi Sig-named group (PSK, PSE or PSP), and has added several chapters where PSE (now PSK) formerly had a presence. As of 2018 Phi Sigma Phi had 9 active chapters. Chapter names for new PSP groups occasionally follow an historical precedent and reuse former PSE chapter names on a campus: About half of its chapters show some naming continuity with a predecessor, which indicates a claim of linkage between the older and newer groups. This is most often where alumni of PSE who rejected the merger become involved in a restart, or may possibly be where an active chapter left PSE/PSK for the new national in the tumultuous formation period between 1985 and 1988. Besides the Founding Seven listed above, other PSP chapters and any potential ambiguity in their naming are as follows: * PSP's Epsilon Beta (ΕΒ) Chapter, at Wright State University in Dayton, OH; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) active Beta Epsilon chapter at Pittsburg State University. * PSP's Epsilon Zeta (ΕΖ) Chapter, Fairmont State University, Fairmont, WV; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Zeta chapter at Fort Hays State University. * PSP's Epsilon Lambda (ΕΛ) Chapter, University of Michigan-Dearborn, Dearborn, MI; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) active Epsilon Lambda chapter at Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti. * PSP's Epsilon Nu (ΕΝ) Chapter, York College, York, PA; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) active Epsilon Nu chapter at Northwest Missouri State University. * PSP's Epsilon Omicron (ΕΟ) Chapter, Penn State Harrisburg, Middletown, PA; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Omicron chapter at Wayne State University * PSP's Kappa (Κ) Chapter, University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, Stevens Point, WI; carries a similar name to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Kappa chapter, on that same campus. * PSP's Epsilon Chi (ΕΧ) Chapter, at West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV; no connection to PSK's active Delta chapter on that campus. Other PSP chapters, started since 1988, are now gone: :* PSP's Xi (Ξ) Chapter, now dormant,The chapter was banned from the CMU campus after a pattern of risk management issues extending over a decade, according to published reports accessed 6 May 2019. Phi Sigma Phi at the time asserted it would continue to operate as an unrecognized entity. was at Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant, Michigan. It carried a similar name to PSE's (later PSK's) dormant Epsilon Xi chapter, on that same campus. :* PSP's Epsilon Alpha (ΕΑ) Chapter, now dormant, was at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) active Alpha Epsilon chapter at Emporia State University, nor for that matter PSK's dormant Xi Tetarton chapter at Michigan State. :* PSP's Epsilon Delta (ΕΔ) Chapter, now dormant, was at Bluefield State College in Bluefield, West Virginia; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Delta chapter at Eastern Illinois University. :* PSP's Epsilon Eta (ΕΗ) Chapter, now dormant, was at Southeastern Oklahoma State University in Durant, Oklahoma. It carried a similar name to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Eta chapter, on that same campus. :* PSP's Epsilon Kappa (ΕΚ) Chapter, now dormant, was at Johnson and Wales University, Providence, Rhode Island; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Kappa chapter at the University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point. :* PSP's Epsilon Xi (ΕΞ) Chapter, now dormant, was at Long Island University, New York, New York; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Xi chapter at Central Michigan University. :* PSP's Epsilon Sigma (ΕΣ) Colony, now dormant, was at Penn State University, State College, PA; no connection to PSK's active Kappa chapter on the Penn State campus, nor PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Epsilon Sigma chapter at Northern Illinois University, where PSK's Pi Pentaton chapter is active.Phi Sigma Phi had a PSU colony, as noted in the Onward State blog, accessed 14 Dec 2016. This group was short lived, however, as the chapter is no longer listed on the PSU active chapter and colony list maintained by the PSU Office of Student Affairs, accessed 6 Nov 2018. :* PSP's Epsilon Tau (ΕΤ) Colony, now dormant, was at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE; no connection to PSE's (now PSK's) active Epsilon Tau chapter at Ball State in Indiana nor PSK's dormant Sigma Deuteron chapter at Nebraska.The Nebraska colony's facebook page, accessed 14 Dec 2016. :* PSP's Sigma Psi (ΣΨ) Chapter, now dormant, was at the University of Minnesota-Duluth, Duluth, Minnesota; carries a similar name to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Sigma Psi colony, on that same campus. :* PSP's Phi Pi (ΦΠ) Colony, now dormant, was at UW-Superior, Superior, Wisconsin; carries a similar name to PSE's (now PSK's) dormant Phi Pi chapter, on that same campus.

They are short, tough, fibrous cords that attach on the skull and on the axis, and function to check side-to-side movements of the head when it is turned. Because of their function, the alar ligaments are also known as the \\"check ligaments of the odontoid\\". Structure The alar ligaments are two strong, rounded cords of about 0.5 cm in diameter that run from the sides of the foramen magnum of the skull to the dens of the axis, the second cervical vertebra. They span almost horizontally, creating an angle between them of at least 140°. =Development= The alar ligaments, along with the transverse ligament of the atlas, derive from the axial component of the first cervical sclerotome. Function The function of the alar ligaments is to limit the amount of rotation of the head, and by their action on the dens of the axis, they attach the skull to the axis, the second cervical vertebra. Clinical significance The alar ligaments are prone to tearing if a force is applied when the head is flexed and in rotation. If an alar ligament is ruptured, the range of rotation of the head relative to the neck increases beyond the normal limit of 20 degrees.

It belongs to the Australian Film Renaissance or the \\"Australian New Wave\\", which occurred during that decade. The film is set on a sheep station in the Australian outback in 1955 and its action concentrates on the shearers' reactions to a threat to their bonuses and the arrival of non-union labour. Acclaimed for its understated realism of the work, camaraderie and general life of the shearer, Jack Thompson plays the knock-about Foley, a heavy drinking gun shearer (talented professional sheep shearer), and while he makes a play for the station owner's daughter Sheila (Lisa Peers), the film is a presentation of various aspects of Australian male culture and not a romance; the film's title itself is reputedly the lament of an Australian shearer's wife: \\"Friday night [he's] too tired; Saturday night too drunk; Sunday, too far away\\".Rees, Nigel. Mark My Words: Great Quotations and the Stories Behind Them. Barnes & Noble, Inc., 2002. , p. 30 Sunday Too Far Away won three 1975 Australian Film Institute awards: Best Film, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Plot In 1956, gun shearer Foley joins a new shearing team sharing a room with Old Garth, a once great shearer who is now a drunk. Foley and his team battle to get in a new cook, Old Garth dies and Foley befriends the grazier's daughter. Foley loses his status as top shearer to Arthur Black and blows most of his money gambling. The shearers go on strike and Foley and his team get involved in a brawl with non union labour.

They wanted to make a film about the Gallipoli Campaign and considered a co- production with Crawford Productions. John Dingwall was signed to write it. However the film fell through when Crawfords fell out with the SAFC. Dingwall, still under contact to them, proposed instead a treatment called Shearers, based on his brother-in-law, who was a shearer. Matt Carroll at the SAFC was particularly enthusiastic and recruited Ken Hannam to direct. The original treatment concerned the 1956 shearer's strike. This ended up being condensed greatly.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p98-101 Among the investors in the movie were the Australian Film Development Corporation. Shooting began in May 1974 and took place near Port Augusta and Quorn in South Australia. It encountered rains and flood and was completed behind schedule in May. The original cut of the film was over two hours. A number of scenes were reduced during post production, including the removal of Foley's romance with the grazier's daughter, and shifting Foley having a car crash from the end of the movie to the beginning. This caused a great deal on conflict between Ken Hannam, Gil Brearley and Matt Carroll. Release Before being released, the film won four major prizes at the Australian Film Awards in March 1975 and was selected for screening in the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes Film Festival in May. Sunday Too Far Away grossed $1,356,000 at the box office in Australia,Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office which is equivalent to approximately 9.5 million in 2019 dollars.

They were known for wrestling in frayed blue jeans, sporting shaggy blond hair and beards and carrying animal bones around with them (which they chewed on and used as weapons). Origins The Moondog gimmick born in 1973 when Lonnie Mayne became Moondog Mayne in the World Wide Wrestling Federation. He continued using the gimmick in Portland, Texas, California and Georgia. He died in 1978 after being struck by car. In 1980, Moondog Hawkins wrestled in the WWF, in which the gimmick was short lived. Hawkins became Moondog Rex. =World Wrestling Federation= Moondog Rex and Moondog King joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in October 1980, where they defeated Rick Martel and Tony Garea for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After winning the title, Moondog King was replaced by Moondog Spot after King—a Canadian—was denied entry into the United States in 1981. Rex and Spot's gimmick consisted of them carrying chewed up bones to the ring and wearing cut-off blue jeans. While in the WWF, the Moondogs feuded with Tony Garea, Rick Martel, Bob Backlund, Ivan Putski, Pat Patterson, and the Wild Samoans. In 1984, on an episode of Maple Leaf Wrestling, Moondog Rex earned a WWF Championship title shot against Hulk Hogan. In 1987, Rex was repackaged as Smash of Demolition, along with Ax. However, fans easily recognized him and gave him chants of \\"Moondog,\\" leading to him being quickly replaced by Barry Darsow. Rex and Spot then teamed together until 1990 in various promotions. =Continental Wrestling Association/United States Wrestling Association and Smoky Mountain Wrestling= The Moondogs had two runs in Memphis. Their first run took place in the Continental Wrestling Association in 1983, where they were managed by Jimmy Hart and feuded with The Fabulous Ones. They captured the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship from the Fabs on April 4, 1983 and lost the titles back to The Fabulous Ones on April 25, 1983 in a no-disqualification match. The feud continued throughout 1983 and ended when The Moondogs lost a leaves town match to the Fabs on January 16, 1984. In October 1987, the Moondogs wrestled for All Japan Pro Wrestling. Moondog Spike and Moondog Spot faced opponents such as Jumbo Tsuruta, Mighty Inoue, Haruka Eigen and Tiger Mask II. In late 1991, The Moondogs returned, this time managed by Richard Lee. Spot and Spike captured the USWA Tag Team Championship on November 30, 1991. In early 1992, The Moondogs gained a new ally in The Big Black Dog, whom they would later feud with. Moondog Cujo was added to the group in April 1992, teaming with both Spot and Spike separately. The New Moondogs of Spot and Cujo recaptured USWA Tag Team Championship and traded the titles with Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Lawler throughout 1992. During October 1992, The Moondogs gained another ally in Moondog Fifi, who won the USWA Women's Championship from Miss Texas. The feud between Jarrett/Lawler and The Moondogs was voted the 1992 PWI Feud of the Year by Pro Wrestling Illustrated. Cujo left the group during September 1992. On December 28, The Moondogs lost the titles to The Harris Brothers, managed by Bert Prentice and Mike Samples. The teams traded the titles back and forth until the Moondogs captured them from the Harris Brothers for the last time on February 22, 1993. The feud ended in March 1993, when The Harris Brothers beat The Moondogs in a manager's hair vs hair match with Samples' hair vs Lee's hair on the line. On January 30, 1993, the Moondogs gained another ally in Moondog Splat, who replaced Spike. On March 8, 1993, Brian Christopher teamed with The Big Black Dog to defeat The Moondogs for the tag team titles. However, The Moondogs were able to regain the titles from Christopher and their former ally the next week. Moondog Cujo and Spike replaced Spot and Splat in July 1993. August 1993 saw the Moondogs meet one of their noteworthy rivals, The Dogcatchers, which played off of the Moondogs' name. The teams feuded throughout August and September 1993. From November 1993 to March 1994, the team appeared in Smoky Mountain Wrestling, feuding again with The Harris Brothers and The Rock 'n' Roll Express. Spike and Splat also appeared in W*ING's 1993 Most Dangerous Tag War Tournament, finishing with 0 points. 1994 saw the team change again with Spot and a new Moondog Rex taking up the Moondog name until Moondog Rover replaced Rex in 1996, before the team disbanded. =Independent circuit= In the latter part of 2003, the Moondogs (Spot and Puppy Love) began working in Memphis Wrestling, with April Pennington acting as their manager. On November 29, 2003, Moondog Spot died in the ring during a battle royal in Memphis.

Because of a chance encounter with Adolf Hitler during the closing days of World War II, his memoirs proved historically valuable.Schenck, HG, Sterben ohne Warde: das Ende von Benito Mussolini, Heinrich Himmler und Adolf Hitler, Ars Una, 1995. His accounts of this period are prominent in the works of Joachim Fest and James P. O'Donnell regarding the end of Hitler's life, and were included in the film Downfall (2004).  Biography  Schenck was born in Marburg, Hesse-Nassau. He trained as a doctor and joined the SS. During the war, Schenck was actively involved in the creation of a large herbal plantation in Dachau concentration camp, which contained over 200,000 medicinal plants, from which, among other things, vitamin supplements for the Waffen-SS were manufactured. In 1940 he was appointed as inspector of nutrition for the SS. In 1943 Schenck developed a protein sausage, which was meant for the SS frontline troops. Prior to its adoption it was tested on 370 prisoners in Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, some of whom died of hunger edema. In his own memoirs, Schenck stated that his only concern was to improve nutrition and fight hunger. However, a report in 1963 condemned Schenck for \\"treating humans like objects, guinea pigs\\". In the Federal Republic of Germany, Schenck was later not allowed to continue his medical career. He was also associated with Erwin Liek's attempts to develop holistic methods to prevent cancer.The Nazi War on Cancer, Robert N. Proctor According to Waffen SS-Oberscharführer Hans Bottger with the 1st SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, Schenck left his government duty post to go to the Eastern Front for his so-called \\"Iron Cross apprenticeship\\" during the Germans' first campaign. Schenck proved himself while serving as the battalion physician. Further, instead of just manipulating his way into getting the award like many others, Schenck found himself taking command of a gun battery after the commander had been killed. Schenck performed \\"well\\" in combat and earned the Iron Cross, Second Class.Fischer, Thomas (2008). Soldiers of the Leibstandarte, J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, Inc. p. 58. = Berlin 1945 = In April 1945, during the battle in Berlin, Schenck volunteered to work in an emergency casualty station located in the large cellar of the Reich Chancellery, near the Vorbunker and Führerbunker.Lehrer, Steven (2006). The Reich Chancellery and Führerbunker Complex, McFarland. Jefferson, NC. pp. 117, 119. Although he was not trained as a surgeon and lacked the experience, as well as the supplies and instruments necessary to operate on battle victims, he nonetheless assisted in major surgical operations. During these surgeries, Schenck was aided by Dr. Werner Haase, who also served as one of Hitler's private physicians. Although Haase had much more surgical experience than Schenck, he was greatly weakened by tuberculosis, and often had to lie down while giving verbal advice to Schenck.O'Donnell, James P. (2001) [1978]. The Bunker, Da Capo Press, pp. 148, 150–151. By 28 April, the emergency casualty station was in desperate need of medical supplies.O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. p. 145. As the battle raged, Schenck went out in a Wehrmacht truck into Berlin to obtain medical supplies to bring back to the casualty station.O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. pp. 145–146. Upon returning to the emergency casualty station, Schenck resumed his surgical duties. In the seven days they worked together, Schenck and Haase performed some \\"three hundred and seventy operations\\".O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. pp. 147–148. He later recalled the terrible conditions and experience, after the war, to author/historian James P. O'Donnell.O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. pp. 143–148. During the end time in Berlin, Schenck saw Hitler in person twice, for only a brief time: once when Hitler wanted to thank him, Dr. Haase, and nurse Erna Flegel for their emergency medical services, and once during the \\"reception\\" after Hitler's marriage to Eva Braun.Vinogradov, V. K. (2005). Hitler's Death: Russia's Last Great Secret from the Files of the KGB. Chaucer Press. p. 62. Schenck was taken prisoner by the Soviet Army during the attempted Berlin \\"break-out\\" of 1 May 1945. Following their surrender Schenck, Wilhelm Mohnke and other senior German officers from the group were treated to a banquet by the Chief of Staff of the 8th Guards Army with the permission of Lieutenant General Vasily Chuikov.O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. pp. 325–330. At 10:30 pm, the Germans were ushered out into another room where they were confined under guard. On the following night of 3 May, Schenck and the rest of the Germans were handed over to the NKVD.O'Donnell (2001) [1978]. The Bunker. pp. 331–332.

Established in 1976 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education, the school caters for approximately 760 students from Year 7 to Year 12. History Girraween High School was first opened in 1976, with an enrolment of 300 students and 20 staff. Its inaugural Principal was Colin Bowser and the Deputy Principal Harry Earp. Shortly after the school's opening, an agricultural plot was established, staffed by a part-time farm hand. That same year, with the assistance of Science Teacher John Flygan, a camera club was formed. Given that the medium was not at that time part of the art curriculum, the darkrooms were installed within the Science Department. In 1980, the Camera Club's collaboration with students interested in journalism led to the publishing of the school's first yearbook. In 1978, the school applied for a grant to build a number of buildings to represent a pioneer Australian town. Despite not receiving the funding, under the guidance of Industrial Arts teacher John Lawson, the school erected a colonial cottage that was relocated from Blacktown. The building was the first of several, including a railway station, and constituted what was to become \\"Davey Village\\". The structures were burnt down a decade later with the school maintaining the remains in what is now part of the expanded agriculture plot. Through the years of 1977 to 1983, Gus the Goat served as the school's official mascot. On his passing in 1983, the school newspaper was dedicated to him, although now the newsletter is called Etcetera. In 1989, Girraween High became an academically selective school. Under principal Robert Cruikshank, specialist computer rooms and music studios were constructed, and a sister school relationship with Hisai High school in Mie, Japan was forged. At Presentation Day on 15 December 2008, former Premier Nathan Rees promised that a school hall would be added to the state's Capital Works program. In September 2009 a $400,000 grant was announced to extend the school gym and construct a stage. In 2014, Girraween High School achieved exceptional results in the HSC Examinations and was subsequently placed 15th statewide amongst all high schools. In 2015, Girraween High School ranked 8th statewide. In 2018, there were several upgrades made to the school such as new roofing and upgraded toilets. Curriculum Students take the Higher School Certificate (HSC). Since 2012, students do not take the School Certificate. Co-curriculum Students participate in a variety of extracurricular activities including the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, agriculture club, school newspaper, music and drama, chess, mock trial, Tournament of Minds, Inter- school Christian Fellowship, Students' Representative Council, semi-formal committee, jersey committee, various debating competitions, the Streamwatch water monitoring initiative, state drama, Youth Parliament, F1 in Schools, Volunteering and an advanced driving course. The school has also hosted an annual concert, MADD (Music, Art, Drama/Dance) at the Riverside Theatre in Parramatta until 2006. MADD is now staged in the newly redeveloped MPC. =Performing and creative arts= The school has produced The Boyfriend, followed in 1983 with Annie Get Your Gun, Cabaret, Little Shop of Horrors and Bye Bye Birdie in 2007, as well as a variety of smaller-scale performances by various drama classes throughout the years. In 2005 the Ensembles Program was established by Dane Ropa. This program included a concert band for more experienced players, run by Lyndall Hord; a training band for people who would like to learn to play an instrument, run by Daniel Capizzi and Morgan Biddle; an Intermediate band for those students in the middle, run by Belinda Smith; a stage/jazz band, a percussion ensemble and a number of rock bands. MADD (Music, Arts, Dance and Drama) is an annual production of Girraween High School's Music Department. The concert followed the school's annual production which was originally known as the \\"Riverside Musicale\\" and was founded by Clive Lane (retired Deputy Principal of the Conservatorium High School) in 1995 as a showcase of musical talent at the school, and a performance opportunity for HSC performance students. MADD was a completely new take on this idea and included performances by all of the ensembles, auditioned soloists with the highlight being a number of combined concert band and massed choir items that involved more than 300 students. An art exhibition was also incorporated to showcase Yr 12 Body of Works. Admissions and enrolment Total enrolment - per year group - in junior years (7-10) is approximately 120 students, and around 140 in senior years (11-12). As a selective school, entry into the school in Year 7 is based upon results in a statewide examination known as the Selective High Schools Test. As of 2015, students must achieve a score of at least 235 in this examination to be accepted at the school. Entry into vacant places in later stages is based on a reserve list, an exam and at times other criteria - mainly reports and academic achievements from previous years. Sport =School sport facilities= The school has a large gymnasium which contains one small basketball court or one volleyball court. The school also has two full-sized sporting fields, as well as two outdoor basketball courts with a shelter. There is also a room with a few gym equipment, such as plyo boxes and a rowing machine. =Quad Schools Tournament= Starting 2013, Penrith High School joined the sporting tournament previously known as the Tri-School Tournament between Baulkham Hills High School, James Ruse Agricultural High School and Girraween High School. In addition to basketball, soccer and touch football, Penrith hosted table tennis in 2013. Again, Baulkham Hills High School won the tournament. The competition returned in 2014, with Baulkham Hills hosting basketball, Girraween hosting touch football, James Ruse hosting soccer and Penrith hosting volleyball. Again, Baulkham Hills High School won the tournament. In 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, the Quad School Tournament champions were Baulkham Hills High School. =Sport houses= Girraween High School has four houses named after Australian sporting personalities: * Fraser (Dawn Fraser, swimmer) * Chappell (Ian Chappell, cricketer) * McKay (Heather McKay, squash player) * Newcombe (John Newcombe, tennis player) Notable alumni * David R.

Basso was professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of New Mexico and earlier taught at the University of Arizona and Yale University. After first studying Apache culture in 1959, Basso completed a bachelor's degree at Harvard University (B.A., 1962) and then took the doctorate at Stanford University (Ph.D., 1967). He was the son of novelist Hamilton Basso. Basso was awarded the Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing in 1997 for his ethnography, Wisdom Sits in Places: Landscape and Language Among the Western Apache. The work was also the 1996 Western States Book Award Winner in Creative Nonfiction. In this ethnography, Basso expressed his hope that anthropologists will spend more time investigating how places and spaces are perceived and experienced; for human relationships to geographical places are rich, deeply felt, and profoundly telling.

It has a zip codes of both 15212 and 15214, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 1 (North Neighborhoods). Northview Heights was part of Reserve Township before being annexed by Pittsburgh in 1932. At that time, what is now Northview Heights consisted of vacant land which, due to topography, was isolated from Spring Hill (to the south) and Summer Hill (to the north). During a seven-year period from 1955-1962, the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh developed this vacant land by creating a 999 unit public housing project called Northview Heights. Court action taken by nearby residents opposed to its construction held up the project for three years. Because the housing project was isolated from the surrounding neighborhoods, it has since been treated as a neighborhood in its own right, called Northview Heights. The neighborhood has its own elementary school, Pittsburgh Northview. The neighborhood's status as an isolated public housing development has been a source of controversy from its outset. In 1968, just three years after the development was opened, a group of teenagers attacked a policeman and later burglarized his home. Residents who had been living in the project since it opened blamed new residents who had moved in recently, and who had not been screened by the Housing Authority, for the violence. In 1985, the Pittsburgh Public Schools considered integrating the neighborhood's school by busing in children from other neighborhoods but dropped this plan for fear of opposition from the parents of those children. In 1993, firefighters and utility personnel refused to enter the neighborhood without police protection for fear of assault. In 1998, the City of Pittsburgh - over the objections of Northview Heights residents - closed three of the development's five entrances and installed security stations at the remaining two entrances. Studies had showed that while Northview Heights residents owned 125 cars total, some 3,000 cars a day were entering and leaving the development, suggesting that the development was used as a drug market. As of 2010, Northview Heights had a population of some 1,200 people, of whom 90.5% were African-American. The neighborhood had 723 housing units, of which 63.6% were occupied and 36.4% were vacant. Nearly all (96.3%) of the occupied units were rental housing. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire houses 38 Engine in Northview Heights. Surrounding neighborhoods Northview Heights has five borders, four with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Spring Hill–City View to the south, Perry South and Perry North to the west, and Summer Hill to the north.

He then attended Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law where he was awarded a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1981 and passed the Liberian bar. He earned a Master of Laws degree from the Dedman School of Law at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas the following year. Political career Brumskine became politically prominent in the 1990s as an ally of Charles Taylor. When Taylor became President in 1997, Brumskine became President pro tempore of the Senate. By 1999, however, they began feuding, and Brumskine fled the country after being threatened by Taylor's supporters. He returned to Liberia in 2003 with plans to run in the scheduled 2003 presidential election. However, Taylor's resignation that year and the installment of a two-year transitional government led to the elections being cancelled. In 2004, Brumskine began campaigning for the 2005 presidential elections as a member of the Liberty Party. Like most of the other candidates, he promised to bring reconciliation to the country following its political turmoil, and improve the economy and infrastructure. What made him unique was the strong religious message in his campaign. Ultimately, he received nearly 14% of the vote, 6% less than the second-place candidate, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and therefore he was not able to participate in the runoff.Elections in Liberia, African Elections Database. Due to his popularity in the first round, he could have significantly influenced the run-off had he endorsed either candidate.

It was also argued that Brumskine's pairing with Siakor delivered a fatal blow to other opposition political parties that might enter the race for President, as the race was thought likely to come down to Brumskine and Johnson-Sirleaf. 20 January 2011 However, Winston Tubman was the most popular of Johnson-Sirleaf's opponents, and the third-place finisher in the contest was Prince Johnson.

Latham formed a tag team with Carl Fergie called \\"The Ragin' Cajuns\\" managed by Billy Spears in the Gulf Coast territory. Early in his career, he wrestled in Memphis and Mid-South. His first big push came as a member of the Blond Bombers with Wayne Farris (The Honky Tonk Man). The Blond Bombers were involved in heated feuds with several baby faces across the two competing Tennessee promotions, appearing in both Nick Gulas Nashville based territory, and Jerry Jarrett's Memphis area. The team was managed by Danny Davis. Their signature moment was the now famous \\"Tupelo Concession Stand Brawl\\" against Jerry Lawler and Bill Dundee. Years later, Booker resurfaced as \\"Moondog Spot\\", a member of The Moondogs. Booker became a WWWF World Tag Team Champion as a replacement for Moondog King in May 1981. Booker held the title along with Moondog Rex until they were defeated by Rick Martel and Tony Garea on July 21, 1981. The Moondogs also frequently appeared in Memphis where they feuded with The Fabulous Ones, The Rock 'n' Roll Express, and Midnight Express. The Moondogs became a regular gimmick in the Memphis promotion featuring a revolving door of wrestlers who teamed with Latham. On November 7, 1985 he wrestled in the tournament on the WWF pay-per-view event Wrestling Classic.

In Shadyside, businesses (retail & restaurants) are located along three corridors: Walnut Street, Ellsworth Avenue, and S. Highland Avenue. Given the compact nature of this historic residential neighborhood, the three business corridors are all within walking distance of one another. =Walnut Street= On Walnut Street, there are more stores that belong to national chains, including Gap (along with BabyGap, GapKids and GapBody), Apple, J.Crew, UBS, Chico's, Victoria's Secret, Banana Republic, Talbots, and United Colors of Benetton. Pittsburgh's oldest jewelry store, the 4th generation Henne Jewelers, is also here, as are local restaurants, including Up Modern Kitchen,http://www.upkitchen.com/ Cappy's, Mario's, William Penn Tavern, Pamela's Diner and La Feria. Pamela's Diner has been serving breakfast since 1980.

Walnut Street also hosts the Shadyside Arts Festival, a juried art show. This late summer/early fall street fair has been held on Walnut Street for so long that the event has been renamed \\"The Art Festival on Walnut Street.\\" =Ellsworth Avenue= Ellsworth Avenue tends to have smaller, locally owned businesses, including Eons (a vintage store), Gallerie Chiz (an art gallery), and beauty salons such as Salon 5844, Capristo salon, Dante Salon, and Mikel's. Ellsworth has a number of restaurants such as Stack’d, Umi, Con Alma, Senyai Thai and Soba. Ellsworth also features two of Pittsburgh's gay and gay friendly bars, Element and 5801. =S.

Residential Shadyside Since the 1920s, residential Shadyside has been home to a mix of affluent families, young professionals, artists, musicians, students, and apartment dwellers. The residential areas of the neighborhood include Victorian mansions along with modern apartments and condominiums. The neighborhood has a compact layout, which prevents most houses from having garages. Public transportation is available via Port Authority bus system; express busway stops are located in the neighborhood on Negley Avenue (between Ellsworth and Centre avenues) and on Ellsworth Avenue (at Shady Avenue). Schools The Shadyside school district consists mainly of The Liberty School, a public school; and private schools, Winchester Thurston School, The Ellis School, and Shadyside Academy. The Liberty School is located in the Shadyside area of Pittsburgh, and consists of grades pre- kindergarten to fifth. The school's colors are navy and white and its mascot is the soaring eagle. It was built in 1872, and in 1911, the industrial arts portion of the school was built. From the years 1911 to 1934, the first and older building instilled primary instruction- such as the core subjects of learning- while the newer building offered woodworking, home economics, and other courses. In 1934, the eldest building was completely torn down to further renovate the school. Therefore, the newest building was attached to the 1911 building, consisting of both classrooms and an auditorium. Later on in the 1990s, playgrounds were constructed on both sides of the buildings providing more recreation for the students. Liberty is a \\"magnet school,\\" which merely means it is a public school with specialized courses and therefore draws in a diverse group of students. Shadyside in winter Liberty's approximate student enrollment is 375 students per school year, with a student to teacher ratio of about 16:1. The percentage of males and females is fairly equal, with 45% male and 55% female. The Winchester Thurston School is a private co-ed institution located in Shadyside. It has two campuses-the North Hills campus in Allison Park and the city campus in Shadyside. The Ellis School is an independent school for girls ages three through grade twelve in Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was established in 1916 by Sara Frazer Ellis. The Ellis School and the Winchester Thurston School are both part of the Pittsburgh Consortium of Independent Schools (PCIS) which is a non-profit organization consisting of these and eleven other independent schools in the area.Pittsburgh Metroguide. Pittsburgh Metroguide (2007-09-19). Retrieved on 2013-07-17. Shady Side Academy, though founded in the neighborhood in 1883, is no longer located in the Shadyside neighborhood. The school originally occupied the present-day site of the Winchester Thurston School as an all-male day school, but relocated its Senior and Middle School campuses to suburban Fox Chapel in the 1920s. Its Junior School campus, however, remains in the city in nearby Point Breeze. Shadyside Action Coalition The Shadyside Action Coalition, known colloquially as SAC, is a community organization. This not-for-profit organization was formed in 1973. According to their website, their goals are to, \\"preserve values and laws of this community\\"; the issues they have chosen to focus on are \\"neighborhood safety, planning and zoning, parking, quality of life, preserving the character of the community, and being actively involved with the future development of our community\\".

Anatomy  =Skin= At the midline of the breast—the intermammary cleft—a deep layer of superficial fascia (lowermost layer of the skin) is firmly attached to the pectoral fascia (outer side of chest muscles) and the periosteum (bone membrane) of the sternum. It forms a shelving edge that supports the breasts.John Blair Deaver, The Breast: its anomalies, its diseases, and their treatment, page 30, P. Blakiston's Son & Company, 1917, =Muscles= The Sternalis muscle is an anatomical variation that lies in front of the sternal end of the pectoralis major runs along the anterior aspect of the body of the sternum. The sternalis muscle often originates from the upper part of the sternum and can display varying insertions such as the pectoral fascia, lower ribs, costal cartilages, rectus sheath, aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique muscle. There is still a great deal of disagreement about its innervation and its embryonic origin. The sternal side (towards the breastbone) of the pectoralis major is distinct from the clavicular side (towards the collarbone), and the two are separated by a fascial interval.William C. Wood, Charles Staley and John E. Skandalakis, Anatomic Basis of Tumor Surgery, page 140, Springer Science & Business Media, 2010, The sternal side is usually more robust and has a fiber orientation that best emulates the downward pull of the subscapularis muscle (armpit muscle).Neal S.

It can be surgically corrected by a plastic surgeon through symmastia revision. Symmastia can either be a congenital anomaly or iatrogenic. Congenital symmastia is a rare condition with few published cases. Iatrogenic symmastia may occur following breast augmentation, forming what is also colloquially referred to as a \\"uniboob\\" or \\"breadloafing\\" as a result of the release of skin and muscle tissue around the sternum due to over-dissection. Alternative medical interpretation The mandala (diagram) for anahata chakra, the yogic heart that lies at the depression on the sternum between the nipples The cleavage area is special in Ayurvedic and Yogic philosophy as the fourth chakra' or anahata chakra (अनाहत meaning \\"unstruck\\" in Sanskrit, the heart chakra) supposedly lies at the level of the depression in the sternum.Vimala McClure, A Woman's Guide to Tantra Yoga, page 46, New World Library, 2012, Annelise Hagen, 12 Yoga Poses to Boost Breast Health, Yoga Journal, 2017-11-01 Ravi Ratan and Minoo Ratan, Journey Through Chakras, page 5, Institute of Holistic Sciences, 2007, Swami Rama, The Royal Path: Practical Lessons on Yoga, page 82, Himalayan Institute Press, 1998, The astral anahata chakra supposedly lies between the breasts, just inside the front of the chest level with the nipples.Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Meditations from the Tantras, page 37, Bihar School of Yoga, 1974, Jonn Mumford, A Chakra & Kundalini Workbook, page 184, Llewellyn Worldwide, 1994, Swami Rama, OM the Eternal Witness, page 181, Lotus Press, 2008, According to Yogashikha Upanishad, the sacred text on yoga, 101 nadis (energy channels) connect the anahata chakra with the rest of the body, including ida, pingala and shushumna, the three major nadis.Harish Johari, Chakras: Energy Centers of Transformation, page 44, Simon and Schuster, 2000, According to yoga philosophy, the kundalini shakti (the feminine energy) rises from the muladhara chakra (root chakra) in the pelvic area to reach the cleavage area, a fundamental center for growth of a human being,Christine Horner, Waking the Warrior Goddess, page 204, Basic Health Publications, 2005, where at the anahata chakra it is expressed as love, hate and fear.Sri Sri Ravishankar, Shiva Sutras, page 119, Aslan Business Solutions, 2018, In the cleavage area, according to yoga philosophy, lies the yogic heart of a person, not the heart of flesh, that serves as the bridge between the three lower chakras and the three higher chakras,Hilary H.

It takes its name from Spring Garden Avenue, which follows the floor of the valley that separates the two adjacent hilltop neighborhoods of Spring Hill and Troy Hill. Like those neighborhoods, Spring Garden was initially settled by the descendants of Germans and Austrians who had emigrated from Europe to East Allegheny in Allegheny City. These initial residents of Spring Garden worked in slaughterhouses, rendering factories, and tanneries located in this valley neighborhood. A 1974 report by Pittsburgh's Department of Urban Planning explained that \\"Historically, this neighborhood because of its location and convenience for industrial expansion out of the valley floor from the East North Side, has been of mixed industrial and residential uses. Today, the industrial uses are becoming marginal due to the age and lack of room to expand. This has left mostly row type residential uses to survive along the narrow streets on the valley floor and hillsides.\\" Between 1974 and 2010, the neighborhood's population changed in several respects. In 1974 the neighborhood housed about 2,000 people and about 5% of the houses were vacant. In 2010, the neighborhood's population had declined to about 800 people and about 25% of the houses were vacant. History Until 1959 the neighbourhood was served by the 1 Spring Garden trolley operated by Pittsburgh Railways.

Stanton Heights is the home of PBF 7 Engine and the City's Arson Investigation Units, and is covered by PBP Zone 5 and the Bureau of EMS Medic 6. It is a quiet neighborhood with single homes and some duplexes. The homes here are mostly owned and are well kept. There used to be a golf course on most of this site. It is home to Sunnyside School (a Pittsburgh Public School) Stanton Heights has a \\"Pony\\" size ball field and playground that sits behind Sunnyside School. Stanton Heights is located east of Downtown, with convenient access to Highland Park and Liberty Avenue and Butler Street shopping districts. It is surrounded by Lawrenceville, Morningside, East Liberty and Garfield. The area now known as Stanton Heights wasn't even a city neighborhood just over fifty years ago. Back then, it was a private country club. The result is that this neighborhood, set at the top of Stanton Avenue, with the character of a suburb, has new homes, quiet streets with little to no traffic, and no commercial area at all. Before people lived in Stanton Heights, they farmed and golfed there. Until the mid-1950s, a large portion of the neighborhood was part of the Stanton Heights Golf Course, the largest private course in the city. While Stanton Heights does not have its own neighborhood business district, residents have plenty of shopping choices nearby. Grocery stores, dry cleaners, hardware stores, and pharmacies can be found in East Liberty, Bloomfield, and Squirrel Hill. A featured event is the Fun Festival held each summer. Surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods Stanton Heights has five city neighborhood borders with Morningside to the north and east, East Liberty to the southeast, Garfield to the south- southeast, Central Lawrenceville from the south to southwest and Upper Lawrenceville from the west to the north. Historical Namesake Stanton Heights is named for Edwin Stanton, US Secretary of War to Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Stanton first made a name for himself years earlier as the lawyer who helped to preserve Pittsburgh’s position as the hub of the steamboat industry. In 1850 he went before the U.S. Supreme Court to represent Pennsylvania in a case against the Wheeling and Belmont Bridge Company, in which he convinced them that the Wheeling Bridge over the Ohio River should be raised so that steam boats could pass under it to reach Pittsburgh.

It has a zip code of 15212, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 1 (North Neighborhoods). Troy Hill sits on a plateau above the Allegheny River on the North Side of Pittsburgh. It is approximately long from Vinial Street to the end of Lowrie Street and only wide from Wicklines Lane to Herr's Island. History Troy Hill was part of The Reserve Tract incorporated in 1833. Originally called the village of New Troy, it was settled by German immigrants who worked in the mills, tanneries, breweries and railroads that lined the Allegheny river. The migration up to Troy Hill began when a Catholic church opened a small cemetery in 1842. By 1866 one hundred families were officially Troy Hill residents. In 1877, Troy Hill became the thirteenth ward of the City of Allegheny, Pennsylvania. Subsequently, when the City of Allegheny was annexed, Troy Hill became a neighborhood of the city of Pittsburgh. Troy Hill is home to six historic landmarks: the Troy Hill Firehouse, Saint Anthony's Chapel, the Rectory of Most Holy Name of Jesus, the Troy Hill Incline Building, the Allegheny Reservoir Wall, and the Ober-Guehl house. In the 1830s, Troy Hill's population escalated significantly, resulting in the need of a school. In 1836, a 1-room brick school house was built in \\"New Troy\\" and named Mount Troy School #1, because at the time it was located in Reserve Township. It was sold in 1860, which then was replaced by a new, 2 room brick school house. A decade after the civil war, the pupils increased to around 200, so 2 more rooms were added in 1874. Troy Hill was now part of Allegheny's School System, and in 1883 the school was demolished and a new one was built in its place. That building was then also replaced by the Troy Hill School of 1907, but then was shut down in 1960 and demolished. The site of the original school is now a community park.Pfeil, Richard J., Jean E. Koch, Janet M. Koch, and Robert J. Bartolowits. Footprints of Troy Hill. N.p.: n.p., 2012. Print. Troy Hill was the home to Commissioner Thomas J. Foerster who served 10 years in the state house and 28 years as the Commissioner of Allegheny County. He also served on the first county council established in 2000. Another notable resident was Andrew (Huck) Fenrich who served 9 terms in the state house, was executive secretary for the mayor of Pittsburgh, and also served as executive secretary for the Allegheny County Democrats. Until 1959 the neighborhood was served by the 4 Troy Hill trolley operated by Pittsburgh Railways. Beginning in 2013, Evan Mirapaul, an art collector living in Troy Hill, commissioned two whole- house installations in the neighborhood. Both La Hutte Royal, created by German artist Thorsten Brinkmann, and Kunzhaus, by Polish artist Robert Kusmirowski, are free to tour by appointment. Other names While \\"Troy Hill\\" generally refers to the historically German neighborhood atop the Troy Hill plateau, the neighborhood's boundaries also encompass the narrow and flat river plain that sits between the plateau and the Allegheny River. , this river plain is dominated by Pennsylvania Route 28, an expressway which begins at East Ohio Street and then follows the river north. But before Route 28 became an expressway, this plain was a Croatian neighborhood that was settled by immigrants from Jastrebarsko, who called the neighborhood \\"Mala Jaska\\" and founded St. Nicholas Parish.  Troy Hill in Hollywood Films  Several Hollywood films have scenes filmed in Troy Hill, including Hoffa (1992), Innocent Blood (1992), Striking Distance (1993), and Adventureland (2009). Surrounding and adjacent neighborhoods Troy Hill has five borders including the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Spring Garden to the north and northwest, East Allegheny to the west, and North Shore to the southwest as well as Reserve Township to the north-northwest and the borough of Millvale to the northeast. Troy Hill is also adjacent to the Strip District across the Allegheny River with a direct link via 31st Street Bridge. City Steps The Troy Hill neighborhood has 11 distinct flights of city steps - many of which are open and in a safe condition. In Troy Hill, the Steps of Pittsburgh quickly connect pedestrians to public transportation and the East Ohio Street bike/pedistrian trail.

In the 20th century, Case was among the 10 largest builders of farm tractors for many years. In the 1950s its construction equipment line became its primary focus, with agricultural business second. Case's corporate entities and brands changed repeatedly in the 1980s and 1990s. When its corporate parent, Tenneco, bought International Harvester's agricultural equipment division and merged it into Case, the J. I. Case Company continued, but it began using the Case IH brand. In the 1990s it changed names several more times (each name including \\"Case\\") before its merger into CNH Global ended its history as a distinct entity. Various CNH brands continue to make use of the Case name, such as Case CE and Case IH. Name details Founded by Jerome I. Case in 1842 as the J. I. Case Threshing Machine Company, the company operated under that name for most of a century, until 1928. In some of its advertisements the name was styled J. I. Case T. M. Co. for short. Another business founded by Jerome I. Case, the J. I. Case Plow Works, was an independent business. When the Plow Works was bought by Massey-Harris in 1928, the latter sold the name rights to the J. I. Case Threshing Machine Company, which reincorporated as the J. I. Case Company. That company, which became majority-owned by Tenneco in 1967 and a wholly owned subsidiary in 1970, was often called by the simple brand name Case. In 1984, Tenneco bought International Harvester's agricultural equipment division and merged it into Case, and the farm equipment brands were combined as Case IH, although the corporation legally remained the J. I. Case Company. It continued as such until 1994, when Tenneco divested it as the Case Equipment Corporation. Case Equipment became Case Corporation and later Case LLC. In 1999, Case LLC merged with New Holland Agriculture to form CNH Global, a Fiat Group division, which has since been demerged into a corporation that is majority-owned by Fiat Industrial. The name Case lives on in two CNH brands: Case CE (from \\"Construction Equipment\\"), which is the world's third largest brand of construction equipment, and Case IH, which is the world's second largest brand of agricultural equipment. History =Founder= \\"Old Abe\\", the famous eagle of the Wisconsin 8th Infantry, was the J. I. Case mascot. State Street, Racine, Wisconsin, looking east toward Lake Michigan. The Case building is on the left with the statue of Old Abe on the front. Jerome Increase Case (1819–1891) was born to a Williamstown, New York farming family. As a young child, Case read about a machine that could cut wheat without people needing to use their hands. He developed an interest in agriculture at that point. Case took small, hand-powered threshing machines to Wisconsin in 1842, where he improved the design and established a company to manufacture them. In 1843, Case moved the business to Racine, Wisconsin, in order to have better access to water power, and opened the Racine Threshing Machine Works. In 1863, Case partnered with three of his top employees, Massena Erskine, Robert Baker and Stephen Bull. Case was also involved in politics and horseracing. Over time, the company grew. =Competition in the farm business= Case traction engine \\"Black lady\\". J. I. Case introduced an eagle logo for the first time in 1865 based on Old Abe, a Wisconsin Civil War Regiment's mascot. Case constructed his first portable steam engine in 1869, an engine used to power wheat threshers. This engine is in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C. Case won first place at the 1878 Paris Exposition in France for his thresher. This was the first thresher sent abroad by the Case company and was the first of thousands which would later be exported internationally. It is at this time that Case created his first self-propelled traction engine, with a drive mechanism on one of his portable engines. Meanwhile, in 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the McCormick factory. Despite Case's offer to help McCormick with the manufacturing of their machines, McCormick Company refused the offer and a new facility, called the McCormick Works was built, in southwest Chicago. The McCormick company introduced the first of many twine binder machines in 1881, leading to the so- called \\"Harvester Wars\\" that gained the attention of the farm industry during the 1880s. Case tractor. In 1884, Case made a visit to a farm named after him in Minnesota upon receiving news that one of his thresher machines was not working. Infuriated by the fact that he could not fix the machine himself, he set it ablaze the next day, and sent the owner a brand new thresher machine upon return to Wisconsin.Case IH History Overview. See the \\"1881 - 1892\\" section.Jerome I. Case Biography on RitchieWiki. See the last paragraph of the \\"Jerome Increase Machinery Co. and Case Corp.\\" section. In 1890, the Case Company expanded to South America, opening a factory in Argentina. In 1891, the company's founder died. By this time the Case company produced portable steam engines to power the threshing machines, and later went into the steam traction engine business. By the start of the 20th century, Case was the most prolific North American builder of engines. These engines ranged in size from the diminutive 9 HP, to the standard 15, 25, 30, 40, 50, 65 HP and up to the plowing 75 and 80 HP sizes. Case also made the large 110 HP breaking engines with its notable two story cab. Nine massive 150 HP hauling engines were made, in addition to steam rollers. Case engines were noted for their use of Woolf valve gear, feedwater heaters, and the iconic \\"eagle\\" smokebox covers. Case had built a total of 36,000 steamers by the time it switched to gas tractors in 1927. By 1902, five major American agricultural manufacturing companies decided that a consolidation was needed, and so the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, the Deering Harvester Company, the Plano Manufacturing Company and two others merged their companies, rebranding the new company conglomerate as International Harvester Company, which became one of the giants of industry. = Internal combustion tractors = By 1895, the Case Company had begun to produce gasoline engines. By 1899, the Case Company entered the Russian market. In 1904, Case introduced the first all-steel thresher machine. Case sold their first gasoline tractor that year, and established a continuous presence in Europe when the company won the first place in a plowing contest held in the so-called \\"old continent\\". Case at this time developed a wide line of products: threshers, binders, graders, water tanks, plows, buggies, and even automobiles. Case manufactured automobiles for a few years. A Case 1920 7-passenger touring car. The advent of oil engines by the start of the 20th century, suggested a change on the horizon. From Froelich's first tractors to Hart-Parr products, oil tractors seemed the way ahead. Case hired Joe Jagersberger, and he tested a motor by racing in the 1911 Indianapolis 500. Case began production of the 30-60 oil engine in 1912. Case also produced kerosene tractors in the teen years, similar to the Rumely oil pulls. During World War I, Case's sales and demand grew dramatically in Europe. These increases were directly connected to the war; as many farm laborers became soldiers, each remaining farmer needed to become more productive, and machinery was the way to make this happen. In 1919, John Deere entered the harvester business, and International Harvester's reply to their new competition was to purchase P&O; Plowing of Canton, Illinois, and the Chattanooga Plowing company of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Henry Ford also entered the tractor business with his Fordson Tractor produced at the massive Rouge River plant. An economic downturn during the early 1920s dampened tractor sales; price-cutting to stimulate demand sparked a price war in the tractor industry (called the tractor war). Ford, with a massive advantage in manufacturing capacity and distribution, had the upper hand, producing an estimated 73 percent of all American tractors, with IHC in a far away second place at nine percent, and several other companies sharing the rest of the percentages. In 1923, the IHC Farmall entered the agricultural industry, and Ford's stranglehold began to slip. That same year also, the 100,000th thresher machine produced by Case made its way out of the assembly line, marking an important milestone for the Case company. In 1927 the J. I. Case Company ceased building its legendary steam engines. Case steam engines, of which over 30,000 were produced, were painted in black with green machinery, while the gas tractors were painted grey. In 1939, Case changed its color scheme to Flambeau Red, with the excavators being a ruddy yellow. By 1929, Case had expanded to Australia, Mexico, Sweden, and other countries. Also that year, the J. I. Case Company produced its first crawler tractor. S and V tractors were introduced in 1940. =Automobile production= Automobiles produced by Case during the period 1911-1925/1927 include: the Case Jay-Eye-See Brougham (named for Case's horse) and Case Touring-Y. Can someone please put in the dimensions of the original trucks =Work in the Second World War= Case evolved as World War II arrived by becoming involved in the manufacturing of shells for the United States and allied forces military, as well as airplane parts for the B-26s, bombs, and doors for the Sherman Tank. Three new plants were opened across the United States during that year, and, in 1942, the company produced its first self-propelled combine. That same year, Case released the company's first cotton picker, which is currently preserved by the Smithsonian society. A protracted 440-day strike in Wisconsin of the Case factory weakened the company. For the next 31 years, the company went through more globalization, becoming a well-known company in the agricultural markets of Australia, Japan, and other places. Many other companies joined Case during this period. =Modern mergers= In 1957, Case bought out the American Tractor Corporation (ATC). ATC was founded in 1950 and was a producer of small crawler tractors. Their production of dozers (marketed as Terradozers) and development of an integrated backhoe was of particular interest to Case. Case dropped the ATC name in 1959 only retaining the Terratrac name for the drive trains. This led to a hybrid tractor being rolled out of the Burlington Plant in 1957. This model, the 320 Construction King, would become synonymous in the United States to the name backhoe loader. Since then Case has released other models such as the T-Series which includes the 580T, 580ST, 590ST and 695ST. In 1998, a jury awarded a construction worker over $17million in damages after a defect in the design of the 580 backhoe led to him being crushed and being paralyzed from the waist down while operating the machine. In 1961, Case Corporation signed a deal with RyCSA and Metalúrgica Tandil (in Buenos Aires), to make Case tractors and agricultural implements under licence in Argentina. The models built were the 830 and the 831, made until 1964 when RyCSA closed down. 1964 brought the acquisition of Colt Garden Tractors. This was the first garden tractor powered by 'Hy-Drive\\", a form of hydraulic propulsion that allowed for various heavy duty attachments and eliminated the need for transaxle drive belts. The Kern County Land Company, using oil money, bought the Case Company. In turn Kern County sold Case to Tenneco Company of Texas. In 1972, Case bought the British tractor builder David Brown Ltd. At this time Case was repositioned as a construction business, with the expansion of the construction arm and repositioning of the company away from agricultural machinery. American farms began to slide into collapse due to interest rates and low prices. In 1974, Case acquired most of the French construction equipment firm, Poclain. In 1983, during purchase of International Harvester assets, Case sold its garden tractor division to Ingersoll Power Equipment. Ingersoll tractors would continue to carry the Case brand name until 1987. In 1984, Case parent Tenneco bought selected assets of the International Harvester agriculture division and merged it with J. I. Case. All agriculture products are first labeled Case International and later Case IH. They used the 94 Series Case Utility, two- and four wheel drives for Case IH's first tractor together as a company. The first tractor developed by the new corporation was the Magnum. Introduced in 1985, the Magnum began production and the 94 series line was dropped. When Case IH bought out Steiger in 1986 they also continued the Steiger branding, and still do today. In 1996, Austrian tractor builder Steyr Tractor was purchased. Combine circa 2006. The Case Corporation joined with New Holland N.V. to become CNH (Case-New Holland), now CNH Global, in November 1999. Because of the merger, CNH was forced to release its production plants in Doncaster, England and Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The Doncaster site was bought by the ARGO-group, owner of tractor builder Landini, and brought back the McCormick brand. The plant in Winnipeg was taken over by the Buhler family to start Buhler Tractors. In Europe the merger with New Holland (including the former Fordson and Fiat tractor lines) was the success Case IH expected. In 2006, Case IH came with a plan to bring back the \\"International\\" feel to their products. They brought back the old International Harvester logo, and made more technical difference between the two brands. Montgomery Design International redid the industrial design and styling of the MAGNUM and several other new Case IH products as well as the New Holland \\"Cat's Eye\\" styling on all New Holland tractors and the revised Steyr tractor styling. These styling themes continue to this day. See also * List of tractor manufacturers * John I. Beggs References Further reading * Erb, Dave, Eldon Brumbaugh, and J. I. Case Company (1993).

In Australia, sheep stations are usually in the south-east or south-west of the country. In New Zealand the Merinos are usually in the high country of the South Island. These properties may be thousands of square kilometres in size and run low stocking rates to be able to sustainably provide enough feed and water for the stock. In Australia, the owner of a sheep station may be called called a pastoralist, grazier; or formerly, a squatter (as in \\"Waltzing Matilda\\"), when their sheep grazing land was referred to as a sheep run. History Sheep stations and sheep husbandry began in Australia when the British colonisers started raising sheep in 1788 at Sydney Cove. Improvements and facilities In the Australian and New Zealand context, shearing involves an annual muster of sheep to be shorn, and the shearing shed and shearers' quarters are an important part of the station. A station usually also includes a homestead, adjacent sheds, windmills, dams, silos and in many cases a landing strip available for use by the Royal Flying Doctor Service and other light aircraft. Historically, an outstation was a subsidiary homestead or other dwelling on Australian sheep or cattle stations that was more than a day’s return travel from the main homestead. Although the term later came to be more commonly used to describe a specific type of Aboriginal settlement, also known as a homeland community, it is still used on large cattle and sheep stations today, for example Rawlinna sheep station. Management and operation Where the climate and vegetation allow, especially north of the dog fence, cattle stations are similar but run beef cattle rather than sheep. Some properties are not exclusively sheep or cattle stations but may have a mix of cattle, sheep, cropping and even goats which makes the owner less vulnerable to changes in wool or beef prices. Management practices vary according to the location of the station and the season being experienced. For instance, drought necessitates decisions concerning the sale of stock or provision of supplementary feeding. Routine procedures include supervising crutching, mating, shearing, treating for ticks, lice and maggots (if necessary), lambing and lamb marking. Lambs are weaned at about five months of age. Drenching for internal parasites is an important routine on a sheep station. Other activities include ram buying and classing the sheep in order to determine the inferior types that are to be culled. Crops and pastures are often also grown to provide additional feed for the sheep, especially those that will be raised and sold as prime lambs. Fences require regular inspections to locate and repair any damage that has been found. Sheep breeders may also need to undertake predatory animal control if crows, dingos or foxes are likely to be a problem. Terminology The term \\"sheep run\\" was commonly used during the early settlement period to describe sheep stations operated by squatters. For administrative purposes, many stations exist on pastoral leases, but in state government jurisdictions they are increasingly known as stations. The term \\"playing for sheep stations\\" is used to denote a large or serious game. Examples Rawlinna Station in Western Australia is the largest sheep station in Australia. Walter Peak is a notable old sheep station that was founded in 1860 on the south shore of Lake Wakatipu, South Island, New Zealand. It is across Lake Wakatipu from Queenstown, 40 minutes steaming time on the historic TSS Earnslaw steamship.

It has a zip code of 15220, and has representation on Pittsburgh City Council by the council member for District 2 (West Neighborhoods). The neighborhood lies in a small valley south of the Ohio River and less than a mile from downtown Pittsburgh. Temperanceville was founded as a dry town and was annexed to the City of Pittsburgh in 1874. Today it features a business district that has attracted renewed interest as a design district, featuring businesses like the James Gallery, Ceramiche Tiles, Caldwell's, Jacob Evans Kitchen and Bath, and Artifacts, among many others. To support these businesses, the Urban Redevelopment Authority added the West End Village as a Mainstreet Pittsburgh district in 2009. The West End Bridge crosses the Ohio River and connects the neighborhood to the North Side of the city. Carson St. connects it to Station Square and the South Side to the east, and the borough of McKees Rocks to the west. Region The term \\"West End\\" is also used to refer to the surrounding region, which includes the West End Valley in addition to western neighborhoods Sheraden, Elliott, Windgap, Esplen, Ridgemont, Westwood, Oakwood, East Carnegie, Chartiers City, Fairywood and Crafton Heights. The West End of Pittsburgh is mostly residential, with some industry and a relative paucity of commercial districts in comparison to the rest of the city. The West End region has few notable tourist attractions other than the West End Overlook, a small hilltop park in the Elliott neighborhood that offers an excellent view of the Golden Triangle (Downtown Pittsburgh). The term \\"West End\\" is often mistakenly used to refer to the area southwest of the Ohio River. Upon annexation, the City of Pittsburgh renamed the Borough of Temperanceville as West End; Temperanceville was its own entity (incorporated 1860) on the valley floor through which Saw Mill Run flows toward the Ohio River, between the Coal Hill end of Mt. Washington upriver, and River Hill downriver (site of the Elliott bluff lookout, a.k.a. the West End Overlook (c.1961)/West End-Elliott Overlook (c.2004) the top of which is in a neighborhood corner of the (annexed) community of Elliott. The Pittsburgh southwest communities are essentially residential areas supported by local businesses, with ready access to the rest of the city and surrounding areas and highway systems. Over the past 30+ years the West End neighborhood (Temperanceville) has suffered the demolition of much indigenous residential architecture and the removal of most of its tenant units from the rental market, displacing a once substantial multicultural low-middle-fixed income population in favor of attempts to attract business. The West End has three designated historic landmark buildings: the German (now Jerusalem Baptist) Church, the 1899 Carnegie Branch Library (spoken for by Andrew Carnegie himself, 2nd in the Pittsburgh Carnegie system, and home of the first Library Story Hour anywhere), and the Old Stone Tavern, which may pre-date the Fort Pitt Blockhouse as the oldest building west of the Alleghenies. The \\"overlook\\" (once one of the most-visited sites in Allegheny County) has drawn fewer visitors since 2004, when a 2.5 million dollar park improvement eliminated historically available vehicle access to the bluff-top, thereby impacting all- season visiting. Elliott and Crafton Heights also share the Obey House (1823), a prime historical example of a \\"road house\\" on the Steubenville Pike (the land route West from Pittsburgh.) Highways =West End Bypass / Banksville Circle= The West End Bypass is a 1.1 stretch of highway (designated as Saw Mill Run Blvd/U.S. 19, PA 51), running from the West End exit interchange on the Penn Lincoln Parkway (Exit 69C) to the West End Circle. When this bypass opened in 1951, its South Hills connector was the Banksville Circle, a predecessor thoroughfare to the Parkway and Fort Pitt Tunnels. This circle provided direct access to the West End via Woodville Avenue. It was removed by the late 1950s with the construction of the Penn Lincoln Parkway. However, the Woodville Avenue connector still exists, accessible via Parkway Exit 69C and Carnegie/Airport exit from the West End Bypass. =West End Circle= The West End Circle is the circumference of traffic south of the West End Bridge, brought together by the West End Bypass (see above), South Main Street (PA Route 60—southern terminus), Steuben Street, and West Carson Street (PA 51/PA 837—northern terminus). The Norfolk Southern railway overpass (formerly Pennsylvania Railroad) runs straight through the circle, and Wheeling & Lake Erie Railroad ran across Steuben Street, across a trestle and alongside the West End Bypass. A complete reconfiguration of the West End Circle started in October 2007, including new bridges and new improved connectors. A new underpass was dug under the Norfolk Southern Railroad for straight access to the West End Bridge northbound and West End Bypass southbound. The West End segment of the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad has been discontinued as the track on Steuben Street and trestle over South Main Street have been removed. The project was completed in October 2010.

Peirce was a member of the Pettingill family, which was headed by matriarch and former Richmond brothel owner Kath Pettingill. Walsh Street police shootings In 2005, Peirce's widow, Wendy Peirce gave an interview to Australian media detailing how her husband planned and carried out the 1988 Walsh Street police shootings, a crime for which he was acquitted by jury along with three accomplices after she failed to give truthful evidence in court. Death Peirce was shot dead in a car parked opposite the Coles supermarket in Bay St, Port Melbourne on 1 May 2002. His funeral was held on 9 May 2002, at the Saint Peter and Paul's Parish Church in South Melbourne. Father Bob Maguire conducted the service. Peirce was later buried at the Altona Memorial Park. Present was Jason Moran, former running mate of slain gangster Alphonse Gangitano. Moran was a suspect in the murder of Gangitano, who was shot dead in his Templestowe home on 16 January 1998. On 22 June 2007, Victoria Police arrested Faruk Orman in the western suburb of Sunshine, alleging he was the driver for Peirce's killers. In September 2007 Vince Benvenuto—brother of Frank Benvenuto, an underworld identity reputedly under the protection of Victor Peirce and murdered May 2000—was arrested for drug trafficking. The Age reported that when asked whether he was arrested as a result of the Purana investigation, police replied: \\"He's a suspect in relation to the murder of Victor Peirce.\\" But it was hitman Andrew \\"Benji\\" Veniamin who shot Pierce dead. Veniamin claimed \\"If I don't get Victor he'll get me first\\". An unnamed man who drove Veniamin to the killing was found guilty of the murder in September 2009 and was sentenced in November 2009 to a minimum of 14 years in prison, which took into account more than two years he had already been in custody; in 2013 it was revealed that it was Orman. Veniamin was later killed in 2004 by Domenic \\"Mick\\" Gatto. Gatto told the court that it was in self-defence, and was acquitted by a jury.

Once a Queensland State of Origin and Australian international representative or , Ribot was the 1980 NSWRFL season's equal top try-scorer. Also a member of the 1982 \\"Invincibles\\" Kangaroo touring squad, he played club football in Brisbane for Fortitude Valley, Wests and Redcliffe, and in Sydney for Newtown, Wests and Manly- Warringah. Following his playing career, Ribot became the foundation CEO of the Brisbane Broncos and later Super League (Australia). When the Australian Rugby League merged with Super League to form the NRL at the end of 1997, he moved south to set up the Melbourne Storm. Well known for his expansionist attitude towards professional football administration in Australia, in 2004 he switched codes, working as a soccer administrator until 2008. He has since taken up a position at the Queensland Rugby League. Playing career Ribot played club football in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Western Suburbs and Fortitude Valley. He played in Wests' 1976 BRL grand final victory and also gained selection for Queensland as well. Ribot moved south to play in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the Newtown Jets (1978 and 1979), the Western Suburbs Magpies (1980, in which he, along with Wayne Wigham of the Balmain Tigers was the League's top try-scorer and 1981, in which he first gained international selection) and the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles (1982 and 1983). He later returned to the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for the Redcliffe Dolphins (1984 and 1985). It was while at Western Suburbs in 1980 that Magpies coach Roy Masters moved Ribot from his normal position of forward and utilized his speed on the . Due to his speed, Ribot was often among the fastest players on any team he played. One game where he showcased his pace on the wing was after his move to Manly in 1982. Playing in the mid-season KB Cup competition Final at Leichhardt Oval against Newtown, Ribot took an intercept and raced 65 metres to score leaving Newtown lock Graeme O'Grady trailing in his wake as he touched down under the posts. Manly went on to win the cup final 23-8.1982 KB Cup Final highlights Before the introduction of State of Origin selection rules Ribot represented both Queensland in 1977, then New South Wales in 1978 under the residential criteria. He went on to represent Queensland in 8 State of Origin matches between 1982 and 1985. He is thus one of the rare foundation Origin representatives whose NSW appearances were bookended by selections for Queensland. He was selected for the Brisbane representative team in 1984 and Australia from 1981 until 1985, playing in 9 test matches, including the 1982 Invincibles tour. Also in 1982 Ribot set the record for most tries for Australia in an international with four in Australia's first ever test against Papua New Guinea in Port Moresby.1982 Papua New Guinea vs Australia Ribot was the winner of the Queensland Rugby League Press Writers' Player of the Year Award in 1985. He was later named as a winger in the Western Suburbs Team of the Eighties. Rugby league administration * CEO Brisbane Broncos 1988–1995 * CEO Super League (Australia) 1996–1997 * CEO Melbourne Storm 1997–2003 After his retirement from football, he became Queensland Rugby League Development Manager and the first Chief Executive Officer of the new Brisbane Broncos club when they were introduced to the New South Wales Rugby League Premiership in 1988. While Ribot's talents as an administrator were reflected in the club's success during the 1990s, he was continually at loggerheads with the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) administration, which he saw as leaden-footed and Sydney-centric, so detrimental to the future expansion of the game. The turning point was the decision by the NSWRL to sack him from its Premiership Policy Committee in 1993 when he proposed shifting the grand final to the Broncos new home ground, the ANZ Stadium which had a spectator capacity of almost 60,000. This compared to the NSWRL's then Grand Final venue, the 42,500 seat Sydney Football Stadium. Ribot argued that having the Grand Final in Brisbane had the potential to attract more fans to the game and bring Grand Final crowds to the same level that had previously been seen at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Although his suggestion wasn't the only reason for his sacking from the committee, the decision to remove him confirmed his view (and a general held belief at the Broncos), that the league was stuck in a \\"Sydney first\\" mentality and that the Broncos (who won their second straight NSWRL Premiership in 1993) would never be given a fair go by the league. This was despite many clubs and supporters in Sydney believing that the Broncos had advantages that Sydney clubs could only dream of having, including a monopoly on sponsorship dollars from Brisbane as well as media saturation that included Broncos games being shown on television in Brisbane every week and lead stories in the Qld-based newspapers. Many also pointed out that while the player talent pool in NSW was spread out amongst the 13 NSWRL clubs in the state (plus Canberra), the Broncos had virtually all of Queensland to draw players from (in 1993, the Broncos had 10 Australian test players and another 5 State of Origin representatives in their first grade squad. The next best was Canberra with 8 test players (Australia and New Zealand) and 2 representative players). An exponent of national and even international expansion of rugby league, Ribot found News Ltd a willing participant in forming an elite, rival competition in the mid-1990s. Resigning from his position as the Broncos' Chief Executive, he became CEO of the organisation known as Super League in the war for rugby league in Australia. Ribot partially realised his 'vision' in getting the competition up and running in 1997 then resigned as Super League chief executive on 24 June to help facilitate a peace deal being reached with the ARL. He secured the franchise to form a club in Melbourne for the re-united competition in 1998. The Melbourne Storm won the 1999 grand final in only the second season of the club's existence. In 2000 Ribot was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Ribot's single-minded battle for acceptance in an Aussie rules-dominated city saw the Storm part company with premiership-winning coach Chris Anderson in 2001. Soccer administration In 2004, Ribot extended his sports administration portfolio into football, becoming Chairman of the Queensland Roar FC in the Football Federation Australia's A-League competition. He resigned from this role in March 2008.

The neighborhood takes its name from Perrysville Avenue, which \\"was a part of the Venango trail, an Indian path leading north of 'Allegheny Town'. Commodore Perry used the Trail to carry supplies from Pittsburgh to Erie for his lake battle against the British during the War of 1812.\\" Perrysville Avenue is an extension of Federal Street, the main north- south thoroughfare of old Allegheny City. Federal Street ends, and Perrysville Avenue begins, where the flat river plain gives way to a steep hill. Perry South is thus a hilltop neighborhood that runs along Perrysville Avenue from the river plain (on the south) to Riverview Park (on the north). The hill on which the neighborhood is built provides natural borders to the west (the Charles Street valley), to the east (the East Street valley), and to the south (Pleasant Valley). The neighborhood was developed as a streetcar suburb, so it consists almost exclusively of residential housing, with a small business district at the intersection of Perrysville Avenue and Charles Avenue. It experienced white flight after 1960: from 1960 to 1970, the neighborhood's total population declined from 16,000 people to 13,000, while its African- American population, which had formerly been located almost exclusively in the Charles Street valley, increased from 15% to 20%. From 1970 to 2000, the total population decreased to just 5,200 people, of whom 65% were African-American. Current residents have formed the Perry South Citizens Council in an effort to prevent decay and to improve the neighborhood's business district. The southwestern corner of the neighborhood was once called Pleasant Valley, a small area that was nevertheless once considered to be a neighborhood in its own right. A 1977 report about Pleasant Valley states that \\"Pleasant Valley was formerly known as Snyder's Hollow and its stream was a favorite ice skating spot. Primarily, the neighborhood was settled by Germans, Irish, Italians and Poles. Josh Gibson, Hall of Fame catcher for the Homestead Grays, a Negro National League team of the 1920s, lived there.\\" Pleasant Valley consists of rowhouses which were built by the owners of the Pleasant Valley Street Railway - which operated the streetcars that first allowed Perry South to be developed. A series of these rowhouses, on Brightridge Street, have been listed with the National Register of Historic Places. Surrounding Pittsburgh neighborhoods Perry South has seven borders with the Pittsburgh neighborhoods of Perry North to the north, Northview Heights to the northeast, Spring Hill-City View to the east, Fineview to the southeast, Central North Side to the south, California-Kirkbride to the southwest, and Marshall- Shadeland from the west to the north-northwest.

Corus described the station as reflecting \\"the positive, energetic and fun vibe of Winnipeg while giving listeners the music they want.\\" Fresh Radio 99.1 Becomes Peggy In March 2017, its call letters were changed to CFPG-FM to match the new branding.https://www.facebook.com/rwcrn/posts/1345972648775414 References External links  Fpg FPG FPG Radio stations established in 2007 2007 establishments in Manitoba ","title":"CFPG-FM"},{"id":"2968334","text":"Jennifer Anne Keyte (born 21 January 1960) is an Australian journalist and news presenter.

Bliss (September 5, 1897 – 1985) was a chemical engineer and semiotician, best known as the inventor of Blissymbols, an ideographic writing system. He was born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire but immigrated to Australia after the Second World War and The Holocaust. Early life Bliss was born Karl Kasiel Blitz, the eldest of four children to Michel Anchel and Jeanette Blitz, in Chernivtsi in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (current Ukraine). The family were impoverished and the senior Blitz supported the family as an optician, mechanic, and wood turner. Later on Bliss said that the symbols on his father's circuit diagrams made instant sense to him. They were a \\"logical language\\". He was similarly impressed by chemical symbols, which he thought could be read by anyone, regardless of their mother tongue. Bliss's early life was difficult. It was cold and his family were poor and hungry. Because the family was Jewish, he suffered anti-Semitic taunts. When Bliss was eight years old, Russia lost the Russo-Japanese War, Russian pogroms against the Jews accelerated, and refugees came into Bliss's town from the nearby Russian town of Kishinev. Also in 1905 Bliss saw a slide show of the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition of Weyprecht and Payer. It inspired him to study engineering to improve technology for ordinary people. In 1914 Bliss entered World War I, first as a helper with the Red Cross field ambulance, then as an army soldier. After the war he entered university. He graduated from the Vienna University of Technology as a chemical engineer in 1922. He joined Telefunken, a German television and radio apparatus company, and rose to be chief of the patent department. Detention and Second World War Registry card of Charles K. Bliss as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp In March 1938, the Third Reich annexed Austria via the Anschluss, and Bliss, as a Jew, was sent to Dachau concentration camp. Later. he was moved to Buchenwald concentration camp. His wife, Claire, a German Catholic, made constant efforts to have him released. He was released in 1939 but was required to leave the country for England immediately. In England, Bliss tried to bring his wife to him, but the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 made that impossible. It was there that, because the Nazi bombing of England was called the \\"blitz,\\" he changed his surname to Bliss. Bliss arranged for Claire to escape Germany via his family in Cernăuți, Romania (now called Chernivtsi in present day Ukraine). Needing to leave there, Claire moved on to Greece and safety, until October 1940 when Italy invaded Greece. The couple were reunited on Christmas Eve 1940, after Claire continued east to Shanghai and Charles went west to Shanghai via Canada and Japan. After the Japanese occupied Shanghai, Bliss and his wife were placed into the Hongkew ghetto. Claire, as a German and a Christian had the option of claiming her German citizenship, applying for a divorce and being released. She did not do so and instead accompanied Bliss into the ghetto.  Development of symbolic writing system  In Shanghai, Bliss became interested in Chinese characters, which he mistakenly thought were ideograms. He studied them and learned how to read shop signs and Chinese newspapers. With some astonishment, he one day realised that he had been reading the symbols off not in Chinese, but in his own language, German. With ideograms for his inspiration, Bliss set out to develop a system of writing by pictures. At that time Bliss had not become aware of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's \\"Universal Symbolism\\". Bliss and his wife migrated to Australia after the war, reaching Australia in July 1946. His semiotic ideas met with universal rejection. Bliss, without any Australian or Commonwealth qualifications, had to work as a labourer to support his family. He worked on his system of symbols at night. Bliss and his wife became Australian citizens. Originally Bliss had called his system \\"World Writing\\" because the aim was to establish a series of symbols that would be understood by all, regardless of language. Bliss then decided an English-language name was too restricted and called the system Semantography. In Sydney in 1949 Bliss published the three- volume International Semantography: A non-alphabetical Symbol Writing readable in all languages. There was no great positive reaction. For the next four years Claire Bliss sent 6,000 letters to educators and universities, to no better effect. Bliss's wife died in 1961 after years of ill health. In 1965 Bliss published a second edition of his work, Semantography (Blissymbolics). It was about this time that the increase in international tourism convinced many that only a pictorial symbol language could be understood by all. Bliss made sure his idea was attached to his name, hence Blissymbolics. = Educational use = In 1971, Bliss learned that since 1965, the Ontario Crippled Children's Centre in Toronto, Canada (now Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital) had been using his symbols to teach children with cerebral palsy to communicate. He was thrilled at first and traveled to Canada, but he became horrified when he learned that the center had extended his set of symbols and was using the symbols as a bridge to help the children learn to use spoken and written words in a traditional language, which were far from his vision for Blissymbolics. He badgered and eventually sued the center, at one time even threatening a nurse with imprisonment. After ten years of constant attacks from Bliss, the center came to a compromise with Bliss because it felt the publicity he drew to be bringing a bad name to the center. The world copyright for use of his symbols with handicapped children was licensed to the Blissymbolics Communication Foundation in Canada. Recognition Bliss was the subject of the 1974 film Mr Symbol Man, a co- production of Film Australia and the National Film Board of Canada.'Symbol Man' an ANU Fellow, The Canberra Times, (Thursday, 29 March 1979), p.10. Bliss was made a Member of the Order of Australia (A.M.) in 1976 for \\"services to the community, particularly to handicapped children\\".Awards in Order of Australia, The Canberra Times, (Saturday, 12 June 1976)< p8. On the basis of the recognition of the innovative nature of his work, Bliss was appointed an Honorary Fellow in Linguistics at the Australian National University, by the (then) Head of the ANU School of Linguistics, Professor Bob Dixon, in 1979.

Most major American ceramic artists since the 1970s, such as Frances Senska, Paul Soldner, Peter Voulkos, and Rudy Autio have been among its members. During the 1961 meeting of the American Ceramic Society held at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto, Theodore (Ted) Randall gathered a group in attendance together to coalesce around the developing interest of ceramics as an art form. ACS had a Design Section and a Ceramic Education Council and Randall thought that artists teaching the medium as an expressive practice at the college level might have a place there. Randall crafted and presented the NCECA identity for the first time in 1961. Tensions between the interests of art and industry soon became apparent, and NCECA withdrew its membership from ACS in 1966. Initiated that same year, NCECA's annual conference now registers from 3200-5000 attendees each year. NCECA's membership has evolved from almost entirely a group of teachers and professors to a more varied make up including practicing studio potters and artists, students, businesses, organizations, galleries and collectors. Notable 20th-century American ceramic artists including Donald Frith, Robert Turner, Warren MacKenzie, Don Reitz and Val Cushing have served as NCECA's presidents. Marge Levy served as NCECA's first woman president from 1983-84. In 2004, Robert Harrison became the first full-time studio artist selected as president.

Early life Born in Christ Church, Barbados to Ashton and Marjorie,Sproat, p. 90. Clarke attended St Bartholomew's Boys' School. A tall, strong, barrel-chested and powerfully built man (he weighed 15 stone – 210 lbs – during his international career), Clarke was born to be an intimidating fast bowler and commenced his cricketing career with Bridgetown club side, Kent. He made his first-class debut for Barbados on 19 January 1978 against Combined Islands and finished the season with 22 wickets at 25.18, highlighted by a return of 6/39, including a hat trick, against Trinidad and Tobago. Test career The right- armer, having developed an extremely fearsome bouncer, soon became one of the most respected bowlers in the West Indies and, following the defection of many of the West Indian team to World Series Cricket, Clarke made his full Test debut at Bourda Cricket Ground in Georgetown, Guyana against the touring Australian team on 31 March 1978. Clarke took 6/141 in a convincing debut, before injuring an ankle which kept him out of the rest of the series. Nicknamed \\"Silvers\\", Clarke was subsequently selected for the West Indies' tour of India in 1978–79, taking 21 wickets at 33.85, including his Test best figures of 5/126 in the 2nd Test at M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore. He then toured Pakistan in 1980–81 where he took 14 Test wickets at 17.28 before gaining his first taste of controversy. During the 4th Test at Multan, Clarke was pelted with oranges and stones by spectators whilst fielding on the boundary.\\"Bailey to report on brick throwing\\", Trinidad Guardian, 4 January 1981, p. 22. Enraged, he responded by picking up a nearby brick and hurling it into the crowd, badly injuring a spectator who later required emergency surgery.Cozier, C. \\"Former Windies quick dies, 44\\", Adelaide Advertiser, p 36, 6 December 1999. A near riot was averted only when Clarke's teammate Alvin Kallicharan got down on bended knee to apologise to the crowd. Reflecting wryly on the incident many years later, Phil Edmonds wrote that the brick \\"probably swung in late and viciously before hitting him on the head,\\". Clarke was subsequently suspended for three matches from the team for his actions.Weaver, P. \\"Sylvester's high speed delivery of ball, brick, and brandy\\", The Guardian, p. 32, 8 December 1999. Having already been selected ahead of Michael Holding to face Ian Botham's England side, Clarke was now forced to drop out of the squad. Returning from suspension, Clarke found himself out of favour with the selectors and unable to break back into an already extremely strong West Indian bowling line-up boasting such talents as Joel Garner, Michael Holding, Malcolm Marshall and Colin Croft. He played only one more Test, against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1982. Rebel tour to South Africa With very limited international opportunities for him in the West Indies, Clarke decided to accept a lucrative offer to tour the apartheid era South Africa in 1983 and 1984 with an unofficial rebel West Indian side led by Lawrence Rowe. As a result, Clarke, together with the other members of the touring party, was banned by the West Indies Cricket Board from playing in all cricket under its jurisdiction. Clarke was a stand out contributor for the West Indian side in South Africa, taking 37 wickets in the unofficial Test series at 16.16 and 20 wickets at 18.45 in the accompanying limited overs series. Sufficiently impressed, South African provincial side Transvaal recruited Clarke and in 1984/85, he took a Currie Cup record 58 wickets at 12.72. He continued to play in South Africa until 1989, representing, at different times, Transvaal, Northern Transvaal and Orange Free State. In all, Clarke took 193 first-class wickets in South Africa at 17.55 and was named a South African Cricket Annual Cricketer of the Year in 1984 and 1985. English County cricket Clarke played with great distinction for English county side Surrey for a decade starting in 1979, becoming one of the leading wicket takers in the county championship. Clarke received his county cap in 1980 and his benefit in 1987.Sproat, p. 89. In 1988 he took 63 wickets for Surrey at 14.50 while he also displayed his powerful and adventurous batting prowess, scoring a century from only 61 balls in 1981 (and winning the Walter Lawrence Trophy in the process). Clarke's reputation as the fastest, most feared and intimidating bowler in England was such that some opponents, who knew of his fondness for a drink, would sometimes attempt to get him too inebriated to bowl, occasionally with success. Indeed, Clarke's drinking was rumoured to be behind his eventual dismissal by Surrey in 1989 after 591 first-class wickets at an average of 19.00. Some doubts were raised about the legality of Clarke's bowling action while he was at Surrey. Several opposition sides made official complaints about Clarke's faster ball and umpire Dickie Bird closely studied tapes of Clarke's action for any irregularities but found none, nor was Clarke ever called for throwing. It is commonly accepted that rather than chucking, it was Clarke's sheer strength and unusually open-chested action, combined with his speed, that left opposition batsmen fearing for their safety when facing him. Clarke retired from first-class cricket in 1990 with 942 wickets at 19.52, including three hat-tricks. Returning to Barbados, he continued to play club cricket in Bridgetown and served as a net bowler for touring national sides, proving as dangerous as anything the touring team had faced all tour. He worked as a carpenter. In November 1999 Clarke complained of feeling unwell and losing weight rapidly and saw a doctor, who could find nothing amiss. On 4 December, Clarke collapsed at his home and died suddenly of a heart attack. He was one week short of his 45th birthday and left his wife Peggy; his son Shakeem and four daughters; Sasha, Desiree, Dawn and Shelly. Reputation Whilst his Test bowling figures are not exceptional, and he was one of several particularly fast West Indies' bowlers at the time, Clarke nevertheless gained a reputation amongst his fellow players as the most intimidating and feared fast bowler of his generation. In his obituary in The Guardian, it was written \\"like the Jamaican Roy Gilchrist in the 1950s and his fellow Bajan, Charlie Griffith in the 1960s, Clarke's weaponry was based more on sheer menace than technical accomplishment.\\"Weaver, P. \\"Sylvester Clarke\\", 7 December 1999, http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/dec/07/guardianobituaries Accessed 27 December 2009 Viv Richards claimed Clarke was the only bowler he did not feel comfortable batting against, David Gower stated that Clarke was by far the fastest man he ever faced, and in the mid-1980s Garry Sobers wrote that Clarke was \\"the quickest and most hostile fast bowler now playing in world cricket\\".Sobers, p. 19 A truer indication of Clarke's ability perhaps lies in his first class figures. In his nine seasons with Surrey, Clarke took 591 wickets at an average of 18.99; his 193 wickets in South Africa's Currie Cup came at an average of just over 20. His overall first class figures of 942 wickets at 19.52, including three hat-tricks, is a statistic not matched by many other bowlers. Clarke was not shy of delivering balls patently designed to scare opposing batsmen and make them look foolish, and was regularly capable of a perfect bouncer, which having pitched then cut away sharply to follow the path of a batsman's head as he swayed away from it. Having duly terrified the batsman, Clarke would often follow this up with a wicket-taking high speed yorker, which the shaken up batsman was in no condition to defend. Alan Kourie recalls that Clarke during the West Indies 83 rebel tour recorded speeds between 98 mph and 101 mph by two South African police officers testing out a new Ka-band radar gun who were present at Johannesburg ground. Though an affable and laconic personality off the pitch, Clarke had a quick temper on the field and regarded the battle between batsman and bowler as a personal trial of strength and character. He was quite aware that he could be a physically intimidating man, and was unafraid of using his size and power to his advantage in overawing batsmen psychologically. Once warned by an umpire for over-use of the bouncer, he replied: \\"Dis no ladies' game, man.\\"  References  *  \\"Sylvester Clarke – Obituary\\", The Times, p 23, 7 December 1999. *  \\"Player Profile\\", Cricinfo .

Origins The idea of a Soviet as an organ to coordinate workers' strike activities arose during the January–February 1905 meetings of workers at the apartment of Voline (later a famous anarchist) during the abortive revolution of 1905.Voline, Unknown Revolution, Chapter 2: The Birth of the \\"Soviets\\" According to Voline's book, its first chairman was a paralegal Khrustalyov-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov, Хрусталев Петр Алексеевич (Носарь Георгий Степанович) (1877–1918)). The Soviet held regular meetings and printed leaflets, \\"Notices of the Soviet of Workers' Delegates\\" (Известия Совета рабочих делегатов). However, its activities were quickly ceased due to governmental repression. Voline claims that due to certain reasons the Bolsheviks, beginning with Leon Trotsky, falsified the history of the soviet, shifting the date of the first establishment of a Soviet in Saint Petersburg to the period of the October Strike (General Strike of October 1905), when Trotsky took an active part in its work and attributed the initiative of its creation to one of Russian Social Democratic Labour Party groups. Trotsky claims, in his book 1905, that the first meeting \\"of what was to become the Soviet was held on the evening of the thirteenth [ October 13, 1905 ], in the Technological Institute. Not more than thirty to forty delegates attended.\\"Trotsky, Leon, 1905, p 123, Penguin Books, (1971) (English version online) The name of this Soviet was however slightly different: \\"Soviet of Workers' Deputies\\" rather than Voline's \\"Soviet of Workers' Delegates.\\" Khrustalyov-Nosar was the first chairman of this soviet also. Achievements of the Soviet The Soviet of Workers' Deputies soon had between 400-500 members (elected by around 200,000 mainly industrial workersTrotsky, Leon, The Soviet and the Revolution (English version online)), representing five trade unions and 96 factories around Saint Petersburg. Initially, its members were largely local politically conscious workers but it was rapidly dominated by established radical groups. The Mensheviks were most influential, while members from the Bolsheviks and Esers remained a minority. During the 1905 revolution, Trotsky returned from exile to become Nosar's deputy in the Soviet. After the arrest of Nosar, Trotsky became chairman and swiftly altered the party's agenda. Under his more pragmatic leadership, the general strike was called off because it was feared that it would provide the imperial government with an excuse for greater oppression. Trotsky describes its growth between October and the end of November as follows: > \\"The first meeting was attended by a few dozen persons; by the second half > of November the number of deputies had grown to 562, including 6 women. > These persons represented 147 factories and plants, 34 workshops and 16 > trade unions. The main mass of the deputies – 351 persons – belonged to the > metalworkers; these played the decisive role in the Soviet. There were > deputies from the textile industry, 32 from the printing and paper > industries, 12 from the shop-workers and from office workers and the > pharmaceutical trade. The Executive Committee acted as the Soviet’s > ministry. It was formed on October 17 and consisted of 31 persons – 22 > deputies and 9 representatives of parties (6 from the two social-democrat > factions and 3 from the socialist revolutionaries).\\"Trotsky, L. 1905, > Chapter 22, Summing Up Its work consisted of the organisation and coordination of strike action and supplies for the workers. In practice, the Soviet's policies remained moderate, with its most extreme actions being an appeal for its supporters to refuse to pay taxes and to withdraw their bank deposits. Its influence within Saint Petersburg was arguably greater than that of the imperial government during the revolution, but its effectiveness has been questioned. The general strike of October 1905 occurred spontaneously without the Soviet's intervention, and its attempts to call a second general strike in November failed. The Saint Petersburg Soviet ceased to exist on December 3, 1905, when its leaders (including Trotsky, Parvus and others) were arrested by government troops and charged with supporting an armed rebellion. Aftermath The Bolsheviks, including Vladimir Lenin in his articles and Nikolai Bukharin in his book The ABC of Communism (\\"Азбука коммунизма\\"), wrote that the first soviets were \\"spontaneously created by workers,\\" without any attribution to party affiliation. This interpretation was also given in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, article \\"Soviets of Workers' Deputies\\" (\\"Советы депутатов трудящихся\\"), which also mentions that the Ivanovo Soviet (created in May 1905) was one of the first Soviets.

The population of China is 1.4×109 people, while a human brain is estimated to have ≈1011 neurons. In the philosophy of mind, the China brain thought experiment (also known as the Chinese Nation or Chinese Gym) considers what would happen if each member of the Chinese nation were asked to simulate the action of one neuron in the brain, using telephones or walkie-talkies to simulate the axons and dendrites that connect neurons. Would this arrangement have a mind or consciousness in the same way that brains do? Early versions of this scenario were put forward in 1961 by Anatoly Dneprov, in 1974 by Lawrence Davis, and again in 1978 by Ned Block. Block argues that the China brain would not have a mind, whereas Daniel Dennett argues that it would. The China brain problem is a special case of the more general problem whether minds could exist within other, larger minds. It is not to be confused with the Chinese room argument proposed by John Searle, which is also a thought experiment in philosophy of mind but relating to artificial intelligence. Background Many theories of mental states are materialist, that is, they describe the mind as the behavior of a physical object like the brain. One formerly prominent example is the identity theory, which says that mental states are brain states. One criticism is the problem of multiple realizability. The physicalist theory that responds to this is functionalism, which states that a mental state can be whatever functions as a mental state. That is, the mind can be composed of neurons, or it could be composed of wood, rocks or toilet paper, as long as it provides mental functionality. The thought experiment Suppose that the whole nation of China was reordered to simulate the workings of a single brain (that is, to act as a mind according to functionalism). Each Chinese person acts as (say) a neuron, and communicates by special two-way radio in the corresponding way to the other people. The current mental state of the China brain is displayed on satellites that may be seen from anywhere in China. The China brain would then be connected via radio to a body, one that provides the sensory inputs and behavioral outputs of the China brain. Thus, the China brain possesses all the elements of a functional description of mind: sensory inputs, behavioral outputs, and internal mental states causally connected to other mental states. If the nation of China can be made to act in this way, then, according to functionalism, this system would have a mind. Block's goal is to show how unintuitive it is to think that such an arrangement could create a mind capable of thoughts and feelings. Consciousness The China brain argues that consciousness is a problem for functionalism. Block's Chinese nation presents a version of what is known as the absent qualia objection to functionalism because it purports to show that it's possible for something to be functionally equivalent to a human being and yet have no conscious experience. A creature that functions like a human being but doesn't feel anything is known as a \\"philosophical zombie\\". So the absent qualia objection to functionalism could also be called the \\"zombie objection\\". Criticisms Some philosophers, like Daniel Dennett, have concluded that the China brain does create a mental state. Functionalist philosophers of mind endorse the idea that something like the China brain can realise a mind, and that neurons are, in principle, not the only material that can create a mental state.

The genus is named after Giovanni Scopoli (1723–88), a Tyrolean naturalist. The genus has a disjunct distribution, with two recognised species in Central to Eastern Europe, (including the Caucasus), and two species in East Asia. The two European species are: *Scopolia carniolica Jacq. of Slovenia, Austria and the Carpathian Mountains *Scopolia caucasica Kolesn. ex Kreyer of the Caucasus and the two Asiatic species are: *Scopolia lutescens Y.N. Lee of Korea *Scopolia japonica Maxim. of Japan The four species in the equally medicinal genus Anisodus *Anisodus tanguticus (Maxim.) Pascher *Anisodus luridus Link ex Spreng. *Anisodus carniolicoides (C.Y.Wu & C.Chen) D'Arcy & Z.Y.Zhang *Anisodus acutangulus C.Y.Wu & C.Chen have in the past been placed in the genus Scopolia, as has the monotypic genus Atropanthe with its single species Atropanthe sinensis Pascher.Germplasm Resources Information Network Scopolia Scopolia carniolica - the longest-known species and the one with the westernmost distribution - is a creeping perennial plant, with light green leaves and dull reddish-purple flowers (cream in the attractive and more ornamental variety hladnikiana, sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant). Scopolia's extract (which contains a form of the alkaloid scopolamine) is used in at least one commercial stomach remedy (Inosea, produced by Sato Pharmaceutical). The extract is an anti-spasmodic in low doses and may be used to relax smooth muscle tissue or prevent motion-sickness induced nausea; in higher doses it is a poison having hallucinogenic and memory-inhibiting effects. Other alkaloids found in Scopolia carniolica include cuscohygrinehyoscyamine and atroscine. The coumarin phenylpropanoids umbelliferone and scopoletin have been isolated from the roots of Scopolia japonica. Scopolia carniolica compared and contrasted with Atropa belladonna Single flower of Scopolia carniolica, showing hairless, cup- shaped, only faintly-lobed calyx and cream-veined, purple-brown corolla Single flower of Atropa belladonna, showing hairy, lobed calyx and hairy, purple and green, urn-shaped corolla, netted with veins. Note curved pistil (bearing minutely hairy stigma) protruding beyond corolla. Close up of cream-coloured interiors of two flowers of Scopolia carniolica (some dark venation visible at very bases of flowers) Close-up of purple and green interior, netted with veins, of single flower of Atropa belladonna. Note stamens curling inward towards mouth of flower. Scopolia carniolica fruit with cup-shaped calyx slit to reveal pyxidium (dry capsule dehiscing by operculum (= lid) to reveal seeds) Atropa belladonna indehiscent fruit: glossy, juicy berry with distinctly lobed, star-shaped calyx The existence of the synonym Scopolia atropoides (i.e. \\"Atropa-like Scopolia\\") for Scopolia carniolica demonstrates the perceived similarity between Scopolia carniolica and its better-known relative Deadly Nightshade (Atropa belladonna). The most obvious dissimilarity lies in the respective fruits, that of Scopolia being a pyxidium (i.e. a dry, pot-like capsule with an operculum (lid)) while that of Atropa is a juicy, glistening, jet-black berry bearing a superficial resemblance to a cherry - indeed this pyxidium / berry dichotomy constitutes the feature separating the genus Atropa into a subtribe of its own within the Solanaceous tribe Hyoscyameae: all other genera in tribe Hyoscyameae have the same type of dry, pyxidial capsule as Scopolia. Other points of dissimilarity include: *Pedicel type: Scopolia carniolica, long, slender and delicate / Atropa belladonna, shorter and broadening toward the calyx - particularly at fruiting. *Calyx type: Scopolia carniolica, cup-shaped, with slight peaks rather than distinct lobes / Atropa belladonna distinctly lobed, the individual lobes somewhat leaf-like and these lobes spreading to make the calyx star-shaped in fruit. *Colour of corolla: Scopolia carniolica, exterior: purplish-brown striped longitudinally with cream veins, interior: cream, except for some dark venation at the very base / Atropa belladonna, dull purple shading to green netted with darker veins at the base. *Glabrescence / pubescence: Scopolia carniolica, glabrous (hairless), the corolla often having a glossy, \\"enameled\\" appearance / Atropa belladonna pubescent (hairy), the corolla and calyx being clothed in short trichomes (hairs) - though less so in those of its eastern subspecies A. belladonna ssp. caucasica. *Corolla shape: Scopolia carniolica, simple, un-lobed, straight-sided bell / Atropa belladonna urceolate (= urn- shaped) bell bearing short but distinct lobes, somewhat recurved. *Pistil: Scopolia carniolica, straight and shorter than corolla / Atropa belladonna, curved and exserted (=protruding beyond corolla).

She collaborated with many jazz greats including Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Toots Thielemans, Ron Carter, Carmen McRae, Wynton Marsalis and others. She was most noted for her ability to accompany herself with nearly incomparable independence and ability on the piano while singing, something described by arranger Johnny Mandel as \\"like having two heads\\", and for her rich, lush voice, a smoky contralto, which was described by noted producer and arranger Quincy Jones as \\"like clothing, as she seduces you with her voice\\". Biography Shirley Horn was born and raised in Washington, D.C..\\"Shirley Horn\\", Encyclopædia Britannica. Encouraged by her grandmother, an amateur organist, Horn began piano lessons at the age of four. Aged 12, she studied piano and composition at Howard University, later graduating from there in classical music. Horn was offered a place at the Juilliard School, but her family could not afford to send her there. Horn formed her first jazz piano trio when she was 20. Horn's early piano influences were Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson and Ahmad Jamal, and moving away from her classical background, Horn later said that \\"Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninov, and Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.\\" She then became enamored with the famous U Street jazz area of Washington (largely destroyed in the 1968 riots), sneaking into jazz clubs before she was of legal age. According to jazz journalist James Gavin, the small New York City record label Stere-O-Craft discovered Horn in Washington, D.C. and brought her to New York to record her first album, 1960's Embers and Ashes. Horn had recorded with violinist Stuff Smith in Washington, D.C. in 1959, as a pianist in one of the rhythm sections featured on Cat on a Hot Fiddle. Unfortunately for Horn, Verve Records did not include her name on the album's list of backing musicians, and the experience did not raise her professional profile. (A later reissue of Stuff Smith's Verve recordings on Mosaic Records documented Horn's participation, and included three Horn vocal performances of George Gershwin songs that were left off the album.) Horn's Embers and Ashes record attracted the attention of jazz trumpeter Miles Davis, who praised Horn publicly and invited her to play intermission sets during his performances at the Village Vanguard. Davis's praise had particular resonance in two respects: because he was highly respected as a musician, and because he rarely offered public praise for fellow musicians at that time. A 1961 live performance recorded in St. Louis' Gaslight Square district was eventually released on LP under the title \\"Live\\" at the Village Vanguard. (A later CD reissue of this material was released under the title At the Gaslight Square 1961). By 1962, Horn had attracted the attention of Mercury Records vice-president (and jazz arranger) Quincy Jones, who signed Horn to Mercury. On her two Mercury LPs, Horn was placed in a traditional pop setting with medium-sized jazz orchestra, and on neither album did she play piano. According to jazz journalist James Gavin, a third Mercury LP was recorded but never issued, and as of 1993, the tapes for that album were presumed to be lost. Horn's final LP of the 1960s was 1965's Travelin' Light, recorded for ABC-Paramount. She was popular with jazz critics, but did not achieve significant popular success. Though she had recorded a song by The Beatles on Travelin' Light, Horn for the most part resisted efforts to remake her into a popular singer in the mid-1960s, later saying of such attempts \\"I will not stoop to conquer.\\"Michael Mungiello, \\"Bringing Jazz Back to DC\\" , The Georgetown Independent, April 22, 2013. From the late-1960s to the early 1980s, she was semi-retired from music, staying in Washington, D.C. to raise her daughter Rainy with her husband, Sheppard Deering (whom she had married in 1955), and largely limiting her music to local performances. She made one album in 1972 for Perception Records, but the record received little notice, and Horn did not tour to promote it. In 1978, Horn's career got a boost when SteepleChase Records of Denmark tracked her down in Washington, D.C. and offered to record her with drummer Billy Hart, (whom Horn had known for many years) and bassist Buster Williams. The resulting album, A Lazy Afternoon was the first of a total of four Horn albums released by SteepleChase between 1978 and 1984. Horn also began to play engagements in North America and Europe, including the North Sea Jazz Festival, where two of her albums were recorded. In 1986, Horn signed a one- record deal with CBS-Sony for the Japanese market and released All of Me, a studio session recorded in New York City with her regular trio and guest Frank Wess on three tracks. By early 1987, Verve Records was pursuing a recording contract with her, and in May of that year, the live album I Thought About You, her first for Verve, was recorded in Hollywood. Horn recorded one further session for an indepdendent jazz label (1987's Softly, for Audiophile Records), then returned to Verve. She released a total of 11 studio and live albums for the label during her lifetime (additional compilation albums added to this total). Horn's most commercially successful years were spent with Verve, and the label helped her find a large international audience. Miles Davis made a rare appearance as a sideman on Horn's 1991 album You Won't Forget Me. Although she preferred to perform in small settings, such as her trio, she also recorded with orchestras, as on the 1992 album Here's to Life, the title song of which became her signature song. A video documentary of Horn's life and music was released at the same time as \\"Here's To Life\\" and shared its title. At the time, arranger Johnny Mandel commented that Horn's piano skill was comparable to that of the noted jazz great Bill Evans. A follow-up was made in 2001, named You're My Thrill. Horn worked with the same rhythm section for 25 years: Charles Ables (bass) and Steve Williams (drums). Don Heckman wrote in the Los Angeles Times (February 2, 1995) about \\"the importance of bassist Charles Ables and drummer Steve Williams to Horn's sound. Working with boundless subtlety, following her every spontaneous twist and turn, they were the ideal accompanists for a performer who clearly will tolerate nothing less than perfection\\". Her albums Here's to Life, Light Out of Darkness (A Tribute to Ray Charles) and I Love You, Paris all reached number one on the Billboard jazz charts.\\"Jazz star Shirley Horn dies at 71\\", BBC News, October 22, 2005. A breast cancer survivor, she had been battling diabetes when she died of complications from the condition, aged 71.Adam Bernstein, \\"Mesmerizing Jazz Singer and Pianist\\" (obituary), Washington Post, October 22, 2005. She is interred at Ft. Lincoln Cemetery in Washington, D.C.Washington Post obituary Since her death, concert recordings of Horn have been released on CD and DVD by Resonance Records and Image Entertainment. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Shirley Horn among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Awards and honors Horn was nominated for nine Grammy Awards during her career, winning the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance at the 41st Grammy Awards for I Remember Miles, a tribute to her friend and mentor (the album's cover featuring a Miles Davis drawing of them both). She was officially recognized by the 109th US Congress for \\"her many achievements and contributions to the world of jazz and American culture\\", and performed at The White House for several U.S. presidents. Horn was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music in 2002. She was awarded the National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Award in 2005 (the highest honors that the United States bestows upon jazz musicians).
