According to the 2011 UK census the population of the parish was 594, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 575, which itself represents an increase of around 50 per cent from 1991, largely due to new houses having been built in the village. Before this the population fluctuated from 274 in 1801 to 417 in 1831 and to 270 in 1931. Although Roman artefacts have been found in the Sutton upon Derwent area, suggesting a possible settlement, no conclusive evidence exists. The first likely reference to the existence of a settlement was recorded by Bede in the 8th century. The village was later mentioned in the 11th century Domesday Book. The village reflects a close association with the Jervis family, holders of the title of Viscount St Vincent since 1735, due to the Manor passing into the hands of Carnegie Robert John Jervis, 3rd Viscount St Vincent in 1857. The family held the Manor until it was sold to the Crown in 1947 and 1948. Manifestations of this association include: St Michael's Church the large marble tablet erected in the village church, St Michael’s, commemorating the death of John Edward Leveson Jervis, 4th Viscount St. Vincent, in the battle of Abou Klea in 1885; the naming of one of the village public houses, the St. Vincent Arms; and the naming of local streets, St. Vincent’s Close and Jervis Court. In 1967 the church was designated a Grade I listed building and is now recorded in the National Heritage List for England, maintained by Historic England. The Old Rectory is a Grade II Listed house built in 1854 by J B and W Atkinson. Facilities in the village include a primary school, village hall, tennis club, post office and a public house. Sutton upon Derwent is home to Woodhouse Grange Cricket Club, winners of the National Village Cricket Knockout in 1995, and runners up in 1999. Both finals were played at Lord's. The ground is located approximately one mile north of the village.

Career After attending St Virgil's College, Hobart, Hook started as a cadet press artist on the Hobart Mercury and completed a course in graphic arts at the Hobart Technical College (now Tasmanian School of Art, a faculty of the University of Tasmania) which included tuition in fine arts under Jack Carington Smith, Margaret Chandler, Harry Buckey and Edith Holmes. He started his career as a press artist and part-time cartoonist on The Mercury, drawing under the name \\"Jeff\\". He moved to Melbourne and started at The Sun News-Pictorial in 1964. Hook became the full-time cartoonist for The Sun News-Pictorial (later to be merged with the afternoon newspaper The Herald to become the Herald Sun) soon after. It was shortly after that Hook started hiding in his cartoons what became his \\"trademark\\"—a fish hook—and looking for the hidden fish hook became a widespread morning pastime amongst readers of The Sun News-Pictorial.

Depicts the end of the 1967 \\"Six-Day War\\" with caricatures of Gamal Abdel Nasser (President of United Arab Republic), Faisal (King of Saudi Arabia) and Hussein (King of Jordan). The cartoon includes the artist's trademark fish hook. The cartoon provided Hook with international recognition when it was re-published in The Times. Hook first gained international recognition in 1967 for his cartoon about the end of the Six-Day War, \\"The three wiser men\\", which was republished widely outside of Australia, including in The Times. In 1987, Hook won the award for Humorous Illustration in the Australian Black and White Artists Club's Bulletin Awards. Also in 1987, Geoff won the award for the Best Political Cartoon at The International Cartoon Festival at Knokke-Heist, Belgium, and in 1991 he won the award for Best Press Cartoon at the same Festival. Hook retired from the daily Herald Sun in early 1993, but continued to freelance doing a regular editorial cartoon for the Sunday Herald Sun while devoting his time primarily to painting. This continued until the year 2000, when he largely stopped cartooning after holding his first exhibition at the Australian Guild of Realist Artists (AGRA) gallery and pursued his love of painting full-time. Since then, Hook widely exhibited at regional art shows and galleries in Australia, and held a second exhibition at the AGRA Gallery in 2005. Over the course of his career, Hook did numerous cartoons and illustrations for papers, magazines and 46 books, including two children's books Harry the Honkerzoid and Planet of the Honkerzoids written by one of his sons, Brendan, and a children's book of his own, Jamie the Jumbo Jet, which was first published in the mid 1970s, and revised and reprinted in 1998.

The organization was founded by a group of local Cincinnati women in June 1964 in response to the Reds' then-owner Bill DeWitt's proposal to move the team to San Diego. The group was formed by local residents Jeanette Heinze, Marge Zimmer, Ketty Kennedy, and Kate McIntyre, who had initially taken part in a committee formed by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce to discuss ways to prevent the team moving. The women decided that one of the ways to prevent the move was to show support for the team by showing up for games, both at home and on the road, which ended up being influential in the decision to keep the team in Cincinnati. Management for the Cincinnati Reds responded to the Rosie Reds by donating tickets to club members, sending speakers to club events, and by promoting the Rosie Reds during games. This boosted interest in membership and in 1971, during the days of The Big Red Machine, many men began requesting to join the Rosie Reds. In 2004 Tom Juengling became the president of the Rosie Reds, a position that had traditionally been held by a female member. Juengling held the position until 2006.

The two locomotives were built by Beyer, Peacock and Company at their Gorton Foundry in Manchester. On account of the risk of damage when new (during the Irish Civil War period of 1921–1922), both examples were initially sent to Belfast for safekeeping. They were stored by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) at Adelaide yard until 1923, when they were returned to the DSER. The locos were withdrawn in the early 1960s. In 1925, the DSER was absorbed into the Great Southern Railways and the two locomotives were renumbered 461 and 462, and placed in Class 461 or Class K2. Livery Originally said to have been painted green, although the DSER's standard livery was lined black, on becoming part of the GSR, they were painted in the standard livery of unlined dark battleship grey which they retained until withdrawal. Following withdrawal, 461 was repainted into a livery based on lined DSER black for display, while still owned by CIÉ. Under the RPSI, she was initially painted plain black with a 'flying snail', but more recently she has been outshopped in an unprototypical CIÉ lined green livery upon completion of her overhaul in 2011. Preservation 220x220px Locomotive 461 was initially preserved by CIÉ in 1967, one of several engines to be put on display at various railway stations around Ireland following an appeal by the Irish Railway Record Society. Other locomotives put on display by CIÉ included ex-GNR 131 and ex- GSWR No. 90. No. 461 featured at Waterford. After being moved several times following display, 461 was presented by CIÉ to the RPSI in 1977. An extensive overhaul followed at Whitehead and the locomotive returned to traffic in late 1990. The locomotive completed an overhaul in 2011 at the RPSI's Whitehead base, and was operation in the Dublin area until 2018. The locomotive is currently in store in Whitehead since late 2018, awaiting overhaul. Locomotive No.461 has appeared in theatrical film releases such as Michael Collins, Nora, and Angela's Ashes. 461 is the only surviving DSER locomotive. She is a unique example of DSER-built rolling stock in preservation.

(2012). The Sexologist Albert Moll – between Sigmund Freud and Magnus Hirschfeld. Medical History 56 (2): 184-200. Moll believed sexual nature involved two entirely distinct parts: sexual stimulation and sexual attraction. Sexual theories From the book Handbuch der Sexualwissenschaften: an 18th-century picture of Origen castrating himself Moll divided the sexual response into four phases:Moll, Albert. (1912). The Sexual life of the Child Macmillan, New York, (pp. 22-23) (original in German 1908). # The onset # The equable voluptuous sensation # The voluptuous acme # The sudden diminution and cessation of the voluptuous sensation In The Sexual Life of the Child, he encouraged parents to provide sex education to their children. Hypnotism Moll was a leading researcher on subject of hypnotism.Maehle, Andreas-Holger. (2014). The Powers of Suggestion: Albert Moll and the Debate on Hypnosis. History of Psychiatry 25 (1): 3-19. Moll published his account of the history of hypnotism and his own experiments in Hypnotism, 1889, in preparation of which he was assisted by support from Prof. Auguste Forel and Dr. Max Dessoir. Psychical research Moll was strong critic of mysticism, occultism and spiritualism. Even though he studied parapsychical research he was critical of it and offered naturalistic psychological explanations for paranormal phenomena. He frequently indulged in the unmasking of mediums and séances. His book Christian Science, Medicine, and Occultism (1902) is an early text on anomalistic psychology. In the book Moll criticized practices such as Christian Science, spiritualism and occultism and wrote they were the result of fraud and hypnotic suggestion. He argued that suggestion explained the cures of Christian Science, as well as the apparently supernatural rapport between magnetisers and their somnambulists. He wrote that fraud and hypnotism could explain mediumistic phenomena. According to (Wolffram, 2012) \\"[Moll] argued that the hypnotic atmosphere of the darkened séance room and the suggestive effect of the experimenters’ social and scientific prestige could be used to explain why seemingly rational people vouchsafed occult phenomena.\\" In 1903, Moll tested Clever Hans and was the first to suggest the horse was not psychically gifted but was reacting to unconscious signs.Mello, Antônio da Silva.

Münch was nicknamed The Good Man of Auschwitz for his refusal to assist in the mass murders there. He developed many elaborate ruses to keep inmates alive. He was the only person acquitted of war crimes at the 1947 Auschwitz trials in Kraków, where many inmates testified in his favour. After the war and the trial, he returned to Germany and worked as a practicing physician in Roßhaupten in Bavaria. While suffering from Alzheimer's in old age, he made several public remarks that appeared to support Nazi ideology, and was tried for inciting racial hatred and similar charges. Münch was never sentenced, as all courts ruled that he was not of sound mind. He died in 2001. Career After graduating from a gymnasium, Hans Münch studied medicine at University of Tübingen and the Munich University. He was active in the political section of the Reichsstudentenführung (Reich’s leadership of university students).Politischer Leiter der Reichsstudentenführung In 1934, he joined the NSDStB.- Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (National Socialist German Students' League) and the NSKK - Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrerkorps (National Socialist Motor Corps). In May 1937, he joined the NSDAP. He received his doctor's degree and married a physician in 1939. When World War II began, he replaced country doctors in their practices in the Bavarian countryside as they had been inducted into the army; Münch's attempt to enlist in the Wehrmacht was rejected as his work as a doctor was considered too important.Jewish Virtual Library Biography =Auschwitz= In June 1943, he was recruited as a scientist by the Waffen-SS and was sent to the in Raisko, about from the main camp at Auschwitz. Münch worked alongside the infamous Josef Mengele, who was the same age and also came from Bavaria. Münch continued the bacteriological research he was known for before the war, as well as making occasional inspections of the camps and the prisoners. Along with other doctors, Münch was expected to participate in the \\"selections\\" at the camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau, to decide who among the incoming Jewish men, women and children could work, who would be experimented on, and who would be put to death in the gas chambers. He found this abhorrent and refused to take part; this was confirmed by witnesses' testimony at his trial. The book on SS physicians of Auschwitz by Robert Jay Lifton (1986) mentions Münch as the only physician whose commitment to the Hippocratic oath proved stronger than that to the SS.Robert Jay Lifton, \\"The Nazi Doctors\\", Chapter 16; The \\"Ernst B.\\" referred to is apparently Münch (see the German version of this page). While Münch did conduct human experiments, these were often elaborate farces intended to protect inmates, as experiment subjects who were no longer useful were usually killed. According to testimony from inmate Dr. Louis Micheels, Münch's last act before the camp was abandoned was to provide him with a revolver to assist his escape. After the evacuation of Auschwitz in 1945, Münch spent three months at the Dachau concentration camp near Munich. Trial in Poland After the war in 1945, Münch was arrested in a US internment camp after being identified as an Auschwitz physician. He was extradited to Poland in 1946 to stand trial in Kraków.FU Berlin: SS-Mediziner in Auschwitz (2005; PDF) He was specifically accused of injecting inmates with malaria-infected blood, and with a serum that caused rheumatism; however, many former prisoners testified in support of Münch in their witness speeches. The court acquitted him on 22 December 1947, \\"not only because he did not commit any crime of harm against the camp prisoners, but because he had a benevolent attitude toward them and helped them, while he had to carry the responsibility. He did this independently from the nationality, race-and-religious origin and political conviction of the prisoners.\\"Translation of the trial findings The court's acquittal was based, among other things, on his strict refusal to participate in the selections. Of the 40 Auschwitz staff tried in Kraków at the Auschwitz Trial, only Münch was acquitted. He was called the \\"Good Man of Auschwitz\\", who had saved prisoners from death in the gas chambers.Die Welt: Reportage zu Dr. Hans Münch (January 2005) Later life He took over a rural doctor's practice in Roßhaupten in Ostallgäu, Bavaria. In 1964, Münch testified in the first Auschwitz Trial in Frankfurt on Main and in the following trials, he was called on for his expert opinion. In West Germany, Münch took part in discussion meetings and commemoration ceremonies. He was appreciated for having saved many Auschwitz prisoners at the risk of his own life. In 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, he made a journey back to the concentration camp. Münch was invited by Eva Mozes Kor, a survivor of Josef Mengele's experiments on twins. Münch and Kor signed public declarations regarding what had happened there and declaring that such a thing should never be allowed to happen again. Münch has also commented on Holocaust denial. During an interview Münch, asked about the negationist claim that Auschwitz was a hoax, wearily responded: During his final years, Münch lived in the Allgäu region, by Forggen Lake. He died aged 90 in 2001. Controversies In 1998 Münch made several controversial statements which caused charges to be filed against him. In 1998, journalist Bruno Schirra published an interview with Münch, conducted a year earlier, in Der Spiegel. Schirra and Münch had watched the film Schindler's List, and the interview was conducted directly after the viewing. A few days later, Dirk Münch, Münch's son, publicly expressed his lack of comprehension of this interview.Der Spiegel, Nr. 42, 12. Oktober 98 He explained that his father had been suffering from poor concentration for two years. He criticised the fact that Schindler's List had been watched directly before the interview, saying that this would have been very exhausting due to the film's three-hour length and his father's advanced age. Dirk Münch stated that, after the film, his father had even confused the female house cat Minka with the male cat Peter. A German filmmaker who made a documentary about Münch also stated that he was non compos mentis.Imre Karacs. \\"Is Dr Munch a confused old man or a defiant Nazi?\\" The Independent, November 1998. He was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.Auschwitz doctor escapes trial - BBC News, 11 March 2000 =Criminal proceedings (1998)= The Bavarian Justice Ministry initiated proceedings of criminal prosecution as a reaction to the interview. The Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung nationalsozialistischer Verbrechen (the Central Office of the State Justice Administrations for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes) opened preliminary proceedings. The authorities looked through Stasi-files from the secret police of East Germany (GDR) and demanded Der Spiegel hand over the tape recordings of the Münch interview in order to determine to what extent the public prosecutor should act. The assumptions of possible participation in National Socialist crimesPublic prosecutor at the Regional Court of Frankfurt 50 Js 31738.6/98. were based on three indications: :* participation in the duty at the selection camp,Ebd., Bd.

One year later, Münch died. =Documentary film participation (1999)= Münch appeared in the documentary film Die letzten Tage, which was released in 1999 in the US as The Last Days and in Germany in March 2000. As a contemporary witness, he met and talked with camp survivor Renée Firestone, whose sister was murdered in Auschwitz during experiments with humans. A film review pointed out that the American version of the film made no clear indication that Münch suffered from Alzheimer's disease at this time. Only the credits of the film provided this information and then only in French.Filmbesprechung Die letzten Tage =Proceedings and conviction in France (2000–2001)= In 1998, Münch made derogative statements about Roma and Sinti on the French radio programme France-Inter, where he said that the Roma were \\"pathetic\\" and the gas chambers would have been the only solution for them. Münch was accused of \\"incitement of racial hatred\\". He did not take part in the court hearing. A medical expert opinion had certified him \\"psychologically disturbed\\". The acquittal was based on this expert opinion. The Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported on 7 May 2001 that the Paris appeal court had annulled the June 2000 acquittal. In May 2001, Münch was convicted in Paris for \\"incitement of racial hatred\\" and \\"belittlement of crimes against humanity\\". The prosecutor demanded not the imprisonment of Münch but his release on license. Münch was found guilty, but due to his old age and his mental health, the Paris appeal court decided that the 89-year-old Münch should not serve out the sentence. As in the previous proceedings, Münch did not attend the court hearings. In September 2001, the French Radio rebroadcast the 1998 interview with Münch. Lawyers Without Borders, the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism and the Union of Jewish Students in France lodged complaints. In 2002, all of the accused responsible staff members of the public-law broadcasting institution Radio France were acquitted of the accusation of assistance in incitement to race hatred. The reasoning of the court decision reads that all radio listeners would have understood that Münch's statements about Sinti and Roma and about NS-extermination camps were taken from the Nazi-propaganda.Französischer Rundfunk vom Vorwurf der Beihilfe des Aufrufes zum Rassenhass freigesprochen (2002).

There was an explicit invitation to participate in the series of public meetings and discussion events on perpetrators' and victims' biographies in the Nazi regime. On 4 November 2002, Prof. Dr. Helgard gave the lecture \\"\\" (SS-physicians in Auschwitz and in the first Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial). =Study: Examination of the previous trials= Within the context of Holocaust research, Helgard Kramer reports about details in a study from 2005: Hans Münch was heard in the first Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial and even called as an expert on 2 and 5 March 1964. Until the year 2000, the public prosecutor of Frankfurt had only knowledge about the judgement of the Kraków proceedings but not about the protocols and the witness hearings. Münch had stated that he had been forced into the Waffen-SS and that he had come to Birkenau at the end of 1944. During the discussion of the second hearing he corrected himself, stating that he had already arrived in 1943. The documents of the witness hearing provided the answer of Münch to the precise questions of the prosecutor during the main hearing of 1947: Münch was questioned about the medical experiments he had effected in Block 10. The questioning was stopped, when he demanded an expert colleague as interrogator.50 Js 31738.6/98, Special expertise Smoleń, Excerpt from the hearing's protocol, p.27. Professor Jan Sehn had prepared the Kraków Trial of 1947 as examining magistrate. He ordered Münch with the medical treatment of another inmate.

The Hungarian medical science professor Geza Mansfeld was regarded as the most important among them. He praised Münch, as he had prevented his selection for the gas chambers and who had given him drugs because Mansfeld suffered from a stomach ulcer. In return Münch obtained training in Serology, Bacteriology and Chemistry. Mansfeld was one of the internationally famous \\"capacities\\" in these fields and he was meant to provide his knowledge to the Hygienics Institute for free.comp. also Lifton, Ärzte, p. 378 f.

Other two predecessors are the Communist Party of Annam (An Nam cộng sản Đảng, 1929–1930) and the Communist League of Indochina. In March 1929, some radical members of the Vietnam Revolutionary Youth League (VARY) () including Trần Văn Cung, Nguyễn Đức Cảnh, Trịnh Đình Cửu, Đỗ Ngọc Du, Dương Hạc Đính, Ngô Gia Tự, Kim Tôn formed the first communist cell in French Indochina. This communist cell's mission as itself claimed is to be the core of a future communist party. Trần Văn Cung was voted to be the secretary of the cell. He together with Trịnh Đình Cửu and Kim Tôn were voted to be attendees of the congress of VARY, held in Hong Kong in May 1929. In this congress, these attendees proposed to transform VARY to be a communist party. Their proposal, however, was rejected by the leadership of VARY, Trần Văn Cung, Trịnh Đình Cửu and Kim Tôn then made a walkout from the congress. They were later expelled from the Youth League. On 17 June 1929, the above communist cell hold a meeting in Hanoi and decided to form the Communist Party of Indochina, declared the party's political fundamental and proclamation, led by Trịnh Đình Cửu, Nguyễn Đức Cảnh, Ngô Gia Tự, Trần Văn Cung,... The party published Búa Liềm (Hammer and Sickle) newspaper. Soon thereafter, the Communist Party of Annam was formed in Cochinchina in August 1929 and the New Revolutionary Party of Vietnam was transformed to be the Communist League of Indochina in January 1930. In 1930 following appeals for unity by Nguyễn Ái Quốc, the Communist Party of Indochina united with the Communist Party of Annam and the Communist League of Indochina and founded the Communist Party of Vietnam.

In computer central processing units, micro-operations (also known as a micro- ops or μops, historically also as micro-actions) are detailed low-level instructions used in some designs to implement complex machine instructions (sometimes termed macro-instructions in this context). Usually, micro- operations perform basic operations on data stored in one or more registers, including transferring data between registers or between registers and external buses of the central processing unit (CPU), and performing arithmetic or logical operations on registers. In a typical fetch-decode-execute cycle, each step of a macro-instruction is decomposed during its execution so the CPU determines and steps through a series of micro-operations. The execution of micro-operations is performed under control of the CPU's control unit, which decides on their execution while performing various optimizations such as reordering, fusion and caching.  Optimizations  Various forms of μops have long been the basis for traditional microcode routines used to simplify the implementation of a particular CPU design or perhaps just the sequencing of certain multi-step operations or addressing modes. More recently, μops have also been employed in a different way in order to let modern CISC processors more easily handle asynchronous parallel and speculative execution: As with traditional microcode, one or more table lookups (or equivalent) is done to locate the appropriate μop-sequence based on the encoding and semantics of the machine instruction (the decoding or translation step), however, instead of having rigid μop-sequences controlling the CPU directly from a microcode-ROM, μops are here dynamically buffered for rescheduling before being executed. This buffering means that the fetch and decode stages can be more detached from the execution units than is feasible in a more traditional microcoded (or hard-wired) design. As this allows a degree of freedom regarding execution order, it makes some extraction of instruction level parallelism out of a normal single-threaded program possible (provided that dependencies are checked etc.). It opens up for more analysis and therefore also for reordering of code sequences in order to dynamically optimize mapping and scheduling of μops onto machine resources (such as ALUs, load/store units etc.). As this happens on the μop-level, sub-operations of different machine (macro) instructions may often intermix in a particular μop-sequence, forming partially reordered machine instructions as a direct consequence of the out- of-order dispatching of microinstructions from several macro instructions. However, this is not the same as the micro-op fusion, which aims at the fact that a more complex microinstruction may replace a few simpler microinstructions in certain cases, typically in order to minimize state changes and usage of the queue and reorder buffer space, therefore reducing power consumption. Micro-op fusion is used in some modern CPU designs. Execution optimization has gone even further; processors not only translate many machine instructions into a series of μops, but also do the opposite when appropriate; they combine certain machine instruction sequences (such as a compare followed by a conditional jump) into a more complex μop which fits the execution model better and thus can be executed faster or with less machine resources involved. This is also known as macro-op fusion. Another way to try to improve performance is to cache the decoded micro-operations, so that if the same macroinstruction is executed again, the processor can directly access the decoded micro-operations from a special cache, instead of decoding them again. The Execution Trace Cache found in Intel NetBurst microarchitecture (Pentium 4) is a widespread example of this technique. The size of this cache may be stated in terms of how many thousands of micro-operations it can store: kμops.

He was the first general officer killed in the Civil War. Early life and career Garnett, the son of Robert Selden Garnett, Sr. and Charlotte Olympia De Gougea, was born at the family plantation in Essex County, Virginia. Along with his cousin, Richard B. Garnett, Robert attended the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, graduating 27th in a class of 52. Seven classmates, including his cousin, would die in combat in the Civil War. Another notable cousin of the Garnetts was United States Congressman Robert M. T. Hunter, who went on to become a Senator in the Confederate Congress and Secretary of State of the Confederacy. Upon his graduation from West Point, Garnett was assigned as a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery in July 1841. He spent a year on the Northern Frontier during the Canada Border Disturbances, serving in Buffalo and Fort Ontario in New York before being assigned garrison duty at Fort Monroe in his native Virginia. In 1843 Garnett became an assistant tactics instructor at West Point before becoming an army recruiter and then an Aide-de-camp to General John E. Wool. Garnett served in the Mexican–American War under Zachary Taylor and received two brevets for distinguished service, one at the Battle of Monterrey and the other for \\"Gallant and Meritorious Conduct\\" in the Battle of Buena Vista. In 1848, Garnett transferred to the 7th U.S. Infantry and served in the Seminole Wars in Florida before heading to the Presidio of Monterey, California. In 1849, then Major Garnett designed what would become the Great Seal of California. After a brief stint on a review board in Washington, D.C., he served on the frontier in Texas, being promoted to captain. He returned to West Point as Commandant of Cadets before being transferred to garrison duty in Virginia. Being named a captain in the 1st U.S. Cavalry, he once again served on the frontier. The much traveled Garnett was promoted to major of the 9th U.S. Infantry and went west to the Washington Territory, where he served in the 1856 Yakima Expedition and the 1858 fighting against the Puget Sound Indians. He designed and supervised the construction of Fort Simcoe. He requested and was granted an extended leave of absence later that year when his wife and young son died from disease and he returned east to bury their remains. Still in mourning, he was traveling in Europe when the Confederate States of America were formed. Civil War When Virginia seceded from the United States, Garnett resigned his commission in April 1861 and became Adjutant General of the Virginia troops, serving under Robert E. Lee. In June, he was assigned as brigadier general of the Provisional Army. At the start of the Civil War, Union forces had rapidly crossed the Ohio River to seize a portion of northwestern Virginia (now a part of West Virginia), winning a key victory at the Battle of Philippi. On June 15, Lee assigned Garnett to reorganize the Confederate forces in the area. He deployed his forces at strategic points along the Staunton-Parkersburg Turnpike, hoping to defend the vital supply route from the Federal troops. A series of small battles occurred, with the Confederates being forced to withdraw under pressure from Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's Union forces. After a defeat at Battle of Rich Mountain, Garnett withdrew from his Laurel Hill entrenchments under cover of darkness, hoping to escape to northern Virginia with his 4,500 men. However, he received what later proved to be false information that his escape route to Beverly was blocked by Union troops. He instead marched to the northeast, following ridges and valleys in a more circuitous route. Pursued for several days by as many as 20,000 Federals, Garnett paused at several stream crossings to slow his adversaries. While directing his rear guard in a delaying action at Corrick's Ford, Garnett was shot and killed during a Union volley. A friend in the Union army recovered his body after Garnett's remaining men had fled. A participant in the battle related his coming upon the body of Gen. Garnett as he was dying and expressed the belief that he had been killed mistakenly by his own men.Fout, p. 78. In memoriam Grave monument for General Garnett, his wife and child, Green-Wood Cemetery In recognition of Garnett's service during the Mexican–American War, a Federal honor guard conveyed his body under a flag of truce to his relatives, who buried Garnett in Baltimore, Maryland. He was later re-interred next to his wife in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, one of two Confederate generals buried there. His grave monument, which he had erected for his wife and child, does not have his name on it.

Born and raised in Moonta, South Australia, the son of Scottish parents, Craigie left school aged 11, initially working as an office boy before stints as a baker and butcher in Adelaide. From an early age, Craigie believed there needed to be a drastic overhaul of society to benefit the less privileged. Initially attracted to socialism, Craigie was converted to the ideas of Henry George who argued that all taxes should be abolished except for a single tax on unimproved land values (Craigie referred to it as a tax on \\"the rental value of land brought into existence by the collective presence of the people.\\") Returning to Moonta in 1904, Craigie joined the United Labor Party (the predecessor of the Labor Party) with the aim of incorporating single tax theory as party policy and worked as a political journalist for local papers. Craigie was elected as a Corporate Town of Moonta councillor in 1905 and successfully introduced a single tax system throughout the council area, believing this to be the first step towards the nationwide institution of a tax on unimproved land values. Considering his work done in Moonta, Craigie resigned from the council and the Labor Party in 1911 to serve as Secretary of the Henry George League of South Australia and form the Single Tax League in order to contest elections and gain support for single tax theory. Over the next two decades, Craigie unsuccessfully contested federal (including the 1914 Adelaide by-election), state and Adelaide City Council elections on the platform of single tax, either as a Single Tax League, Commonwealth Liberal Party, or Liberal Union candidate but still found time to marry, write a raft of treatises on tax reform and, from 1921, serve as editor of the League's newspaper, the People's Advocate. Craigie finally found electoral success in 1930 in the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral district of Flinders, which covered the west coast of South Australia, the stronghold of single tax theory in Australia. The onset of the Great Depression had led to widespread public belief that the tax system had become too burdensome and complex and many sought a simpler solution, for which the single tax theory spruiked by Craigie seemed the answer. Described as \\"a small, mild and rather insignificant man\\", Craigie spent his time in parliament advocating, to the exclusion of all other issues, single tax theory, was considered by many to be a colossal bore and his speeches, usually long, were generally very dull. Craigie also had to deal with the enmity of Labor supporters who considered him a rat for leaving the ALP. They showed their displeasure by hurling fruit and attacking him during public meetings. Nevertheless, Craigie was re-elected to Flinders in 1933 and 1938, the latter as one of 15 independents in a House of 39 members. Fellow independent Tom Stott attempted to form an independent led government with himself as Premier but Craigie refused to support anyone who did not wish to see single tax theory instituted. By the 1941 election the electorate had tired of Craigie and his ideas. He had however been elected President of the International Union of Single Taxers in 1939 and continued in this role as well as League Secretary, until his retirement in 1948, thereafter remaining trustee of the Henry George Foundation (Australia). A savvy investor, Craigie died in Adelaide a wealthy man but with his life's dream unfulfilled.

The group also opposes the Turkish government's policies towards Kurds in Turkey. The group presents itself as a break-away faction of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in open dissent with the PKK's readiness to compromise with the Turkish state. The PKK distances itself from the TAK, stating that the Turkish government uses the TAK to portray the PKK as a terrorist organization in the international arena, that the PKK only targets the Turkish Armed Forces or their proxies, that it always takes responsibility for its attacks, and that there are no links between the PKK and TAK. Analysts and experts disagree on whether or not the two groups are in reality linked. The group first appeared in August 2004, just weeks after the PKK called off the 1999 truce, assuming responsibility for two hotel bombings in Istanbul which claimed two victims. Since then, TAK has followed a strategy of escalation, committing numerous violent bomb attacks throughout Turkey, with a focus on western and central Turkey, including some tourist areas in Istanbul, Ankara, and southern Mediterranean resorts. TAK also claimed responsibility for the February 2016 Ankara bombing, which killed at least 28 people, the March 2016 Ankara bombing in the same city that killed another 37 people, and the December 2016 Istanbul bombings which killed 47 people.Ankara blast: Kurdish group TAK claims bombing - BBC News Istanbul stadium attacks: Kurdish TAK group claim attacks - BBC News Historical context After several decades of oppressive measures by the Turkish government towards the ethnic Kurdish population of Turkey, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was formed in 1978 in an aim to establish equal rights and self-determination for the Kurds in Turkey, who comprise between 18% and 25% of the population. Since 1984, however, an armed conflict began between the PKK and the Turkish security forces resulting in the deaths of around 7,000 Turkish security personnel and over 30,000 Kurds.\\"The World Factbook: Turkey\\" Throughout the conflict, the European Court of Human Rights has condemned Turkey for thousands of human rights abuses. The judgments are related to executions of Kurdish civilians, torturing, forced displacements, destroyed villages, arbitrary arrests, and murdered and disappeared Kurdish journalists. As a result of a brief PKK cease-fire in 2004, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks were formed, a group that presents itself as a break-away faction of the PKK and is in open dissent with the PKK's readiness to compromise with the Turkish state. The TAK opposes, through militant action, the treatment of Kurds in Turkey and seeks retaliation for those Kurds who were killed at the hands of the Turkish government. Founding philosophy The TAK seek an independent state of Kurdistan. The group violently opposes the Turkish government's policies towards its ethnic Kurdish citizens. TAK first appeared in 2004. There is substantial debate on the origin, composition, and affiliations of the group. Some Turkish analysts claim that the group is either a small splinter of or an alias for the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), the most active Kurdish militant group. Others suggest that the group may be totally independent of the PKK, or only loosely connected to it. PKK leaders deny having any control over the TAK. There are some indications that the TAK was founded by disgruntled or former members of the PKK. Structure Little is known about the internal structure of the TAK. An employee of the later banned Kurdish German news agency MHA told Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2005 that representatives of the TAK would always remain anonymous and tight-lipped. The Freedom Hawks recruited a new generation of \\"frustrated young Kurds\\", raised in the Kurdish diaspora slums of Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara, after their parents had to flee the Kurdish villages depopulated by Turkey in the 1990s. Other Kurdish observers saw the Freedom Hawks as a socially disrooted youth, a new urban guerrilla born out of despair.  Relationship with the PKK  According to the Jamestown Foundation, TAK has been a rival to the PKK since 2006. From then on, the group's operations have been repeatedly at odds with Murat Karayılan's and other PKK leaders' repeated calls for a ceasefire followed by negotiations. However, Vera Eccarius-Kelly, a scholar of political science, has noted that there are no clear signs that indicate a struggle between the two groups, in contrast to previous murders of . According to her, whilst TAK repeatedly damaged the PKK's efforts to negotiate cease-fires with \\"unapproved\\" bombings, in a way that has been compared to the Real IRA in the Northern Ireland conflict, the fact that there is no such struggle may have two explanations: TAK may be operating outside the PKK's command structure, or it may be used by the PKK for \\"specific missions\\". TAK's origins however remain controversial. Some Turkish security analysts alleged that Bahoz Erdal may be the leader of TAK. Other analysts believe that the group was initially formed by PKK leaders in 2003, when it engaged in illegal demonstrations, roadblocks and occasional Molotov cocktails. TAK has since claimed to have split from the PKK, accusing it of being \\"passive\\". Since then, the PKK claimed none of TAK's actions most recently in December 2015, they criticized the PKK's \\"humanist character\\" as inept in the face of \\"the methods used by the existing Turkish state fascism.\\" Some experts say that TAK is financed and trained by the PKK; according to France24's correspondent in Turkey, \\"most\\" analysts share this view and whilst TAK is affiliated to the PKK, it enjoys some operational autonomy. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, an academic research centre specialising on terrorism, considers TAK the \\"special urban terrorism wing\\" of the PKK. This view is shared by the White House, which called TAK the PKK's \\"urban terrorism wing\\" in one of its statement on 9 October 2016.Statement by NSC Spokesperson Ned Price on Terrorist Attacks in Turkey  whitehouse.gov According to The Guardian, \\"Turkish officials as well as some security analysts say TAK still acts as a militant front of the PKK\\". Business Insider has reported that \\"experts who follow Kurdish militants say the groups retain ties\\". Istanbul- based Turkish independent security analyst Metin Gürcan, writing for Al- Monitor, described TAK as \\"a semi-autonomous, armed outfit that carries out attacks under the PKK umbrella\\", saying that while the PKK ideologically and financially supports TAK, it allows it to decide on the nature and timing of its attacks. Gürcan further wrote that the PKK uses proxies to carry out attacks in western Turkey so that its reputation for fighting ISIS is not tarnished. Aliza Marcus, an expert on the PKK, also expressed her skepticism of the claims of separation by saying, \\"It would be the first time in the history of the PKK that they allow the existence of any other group representing the Kurds than themselves. In the 1990s, the PKK fought with rival Kurdish groups in Europe, it has killed dissidents within its own ranks. I see no reason why they would allow another group on the stage now.\\" Marcus believes that it is unlikely that the TAK gets direct orders from PKK but thinks that the PKK has control over TAK's actions. Newsweek and Al-Arabiya have written that the group is linked to PKK while Deutsche Welle has described it as a breakaway from the PKK. In 2012, Human Rights Watch mentioned the TAK in its January 2012 report, calling the TAK \\"a group linked to PKK\\". According to Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey expert at St Lawrence University in New York, the TAK is damaging the PKK's short-term and long-term goals, and it's unlikely that the TAK is under PKK control. PKK's spokesman Serhat Varto denied a link between the PKK and the TAK in an interview by saying that the PKK targets only military entities and that it always takes responsibility for its attacks. The PKK leader Cemil Bayik also denied a link or any resemblance between the PKK and the TAK. He went further on to claim that the Turkish government carries out attacks in the name of TAK to implicate the PKK as a terrorist organization in the international arena. In 2015, a member of TAK denied their links with the PKK by saying \\"The target perspectives, manner of action, and tactics pursued by the PKK and other Kurdish organisations in war have a quite 'humanist' character in the face of the methods used by the existing Turkish state fascism against the Kurdish people. In this regard, we are not dependent on the target perspectives, manner of action and tactics of these organisations. We as TAK will determine and realize our independent action strategy, tactics and manner in line with the mission we have undertaken. Designation as a terrorist organisation U.S. government has designated the group a terrorist organization,Council Common Position 2008/586/CFSP updating Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism and repealing Common Position 2007/871/CFSP, Official Journal of the European Union L 188/71, 16.07.2008., eur-lex.europa.eu as well as the United Kingdom. Turkey regards the group as part of PKK and does not list it separately. The organization is not listed among the 12 active terrorist organizations in Turkey according to Counter-Terrorism and Operations Department of Directorate General for Security (Turkish police). Attacks TAK has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks against police officers, soldiers, government and business institutions since 2004. Its earliest attacks were small, non-lethal bombings in public places which the group described as \\"warning actions.\\" These warnings, however, had become deadly by the summer of 2005. * 20 people were injured when a bomb exploded at Çeşme, a coastal resort town on July 10, 2005. * Less than one week later, five people were killed and more than a dozen wounded when a bus was blown up in the seaside town of Kuşadası. This type of attack against a tourist target is perhaps the signature tactic of TAK. The group has targeted civilians to discourage tourism in Turkey by attacking targets such as hotels and ATMs. TAK claims to have no desire to kill foreigners, only that it wishes to cut off a key source of revenue for the Turkish government. * In 2006 the group's attacks continued, including a failed plot to attack a bus carrying legal officials on April 12, 2006. Five of the group's members were arrested when the plot was broken up. *The group also claimed responsibility for an April 5, 2006 attack on a district office of the Justice and Development Party in Istanbul. * In March, one person was killed and thirteen injured when TAK detonated a bomb near a bus station in Istanbul. * On August 28, 2006, The Kurdish Freedom Hawks attacked the resort area of Marmaris with three explosions, at least two of which bombs were hidden in garbage cans. In the resort city of Antalya, 20 were injured when another explosion went off and 3 were killed. A final bomb detonated in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul where more than 20 people were injured. A separate attack is claimed to have been stopped in the port city of İzmir when a raid turned up plastic explosives. The group's website states the rash of attacks are revenge for the imprisonment of Abdullah Ocalan, the figurehead for the armed Kurdish nationalist movement. * On August 30, 2006, the town of Mersin was attacked via a bomb planted in a rubbish container on Inonu street, one person was injured. The bombing is believed to be linked to the recent attacks by TAK, however they have not claimed responsibility. * In the July 2008 bombings, the deadliest attack against civilians in Turkey since 2003, two bombs hit a shopping mile in Güngören district of Istanbul. * In June 2010, they blew up a military bus in Istanbul, killing four people including 3 soldiers and a 17-year-old girl. This was received by observers as a \\"resumption of guerrilla warfare\\" which \\"brings to a final end an unofficial truce between the PKK and the government, which last year launched an initiative giving Kurds greater civil rights.\\" *On October 31, 2010, a suicide bomber detonated a bomb on Taksim Square in Istanbul, Turkey, killing the perpetrator and resulting in 32 injuries, 15 of whom were police officers. The bombing is believed to be linked to TAK, however they have not claimed responsibility. * September 20, 2011 3 people died and 34 people were injured in a bomb attack in Ankara. Kurdistan Freedom Hawks claimed the attack. * On December 23, 2015 Istanbul's Sabiha Gökçen International Airport was hit by mortar fire from the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks. * On February 17, 2016, the Kurdistan Freedom Hawks attacked military buses in Ankara killing 28 Turkish military personnel and 1 civilian. The group claimed responsibility two days later, on 19 of February. * On March 13, 2016, a car bombing in the Kizilay district of Ankara killed 37 and injured more than 120 others. TAK claimed responsibility for the attack on March 17. * On April 27, 2016, a suicide bomber blew herself up in the northwestern city of Bursa leaving thirteen people wounded. TAK claimed responsibility for the Bursa attack on May 1, 2016. * On June 7, 2016, a bomb targeting a police bus in Istanbul detonated, killing seven police officers and four civilians. TAK claimed responsibility for the bomb, warning tourists that Turkey wouldn't be a safe destination any longer. * On October 6, 2016, Kurdistan Freedom Hawks (TAK) claimed responsibility a bomb attack was carried out in İstanbul's Yenibosna district outside of police station on October 6, causing 10 civilians to get wounded. * On November 24, 2016, TAK claimed responsibility for a car bomb attack that killed two people and wounded 30 more in the Turkish city of Adana, according to a statement on its website. * On December 10, 2016, a car bombing and a suicide bomber in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul killed 46 people, of which 37 were police officers, and injured at least 160 others. TAK claimed responsibility for the attack the day after. * On December 20, 2016, TAK claimed responsibility for Kayseri bombing which killed 14 soldiers. *On January 11, 2017, TAK claimed responsibility for İzmir attack which killed 2 people and wounded 9 others *On November 10, 2017 The female TAK Fighter Çiçek Karabulut was immolated with a hand grenade after a gunfight in Mardin, Mardin Province. The organization claimed this incident in a statement published on January 17, 2018.

Background and Rise to the throne  He was the grandson of the 13th king Seocheon, and the son of the gochuga Go Dol-go, who was killed by his brother, the 14th king Bongsang. Korean historical records say that Micheon fled and hid as a servant in a miserable life such as throwing stones into a pond throughout the night to keep his master from being awakened. It is said a year later he left that house to become salt peddler but failed to gain huge asset. Meanwhile, King Bongsang became increasingly unpopular, and court officials, led by Prime Minister Chang Jo-Ri, carried out a coup that overthrew King Bongsang, and placed King Micheon on the throne.  Reign  Micheon continuously developed the Goguryeo army into a very powerful force. During the disintegration of China's Jin Dynasty, he expanded Goguryeo's borders into the Liaodong Peninsula and the other Chinese commanderies. Since the commanderies were nuisances to be eliminated for Goguryeo’s stability, the first military campaign in 302 headed against the Xuantu Commandery, with conquering Daedong River basins of current Pyeongyang. Consolidating cut-off between commanderies and Chinese mainland, Goguryeo also annexed the Lelang commandery in 313 and Daifang commandery in 314 after attacked Seoanpyeong (西安平; near modern Dandong) in Liaodong. 十二年, 秋八月, 遣将襲取遼東西安平. The series of subjugation around northern Korean peninsular and Manchuria held its significance given that 400-year presence of Chinese forces was completely cleared out of Korean peninsular. In his reign, Goguryeo was faced with growing Xianbei influence in the west, particularly Murong Bu (慕容部) incursions into Liaodong. Micheon allied with other Xianbei tribes against the Murong Bu, but their attack was unsuccessful. In 319, the Goguryeo general Yeo Noja (여노자, 如奴子) was taken captive by the Murong Bu. Throughout this period, Goguryeo and the Murongbu attacked each other's positions in Liaodong, but neither failed to secure regional hegemony. Since both sides were at stake, Micheon sent its ambassador to Zhou posterior in 330 with a view to making a diversion against Murong Bu from east side.三十一年, 遣使後趙石勒, 致其楛矢.  Death and aftermath  Micheon died and was buried in 331 at Micheon-won, literally the \\"garden with beautiful stream\\". Twelve years later, in the reign of King Gogugwon, his remains were dug up by the Former Yan invaders, and held for ransom.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, though it is not run by the Roman Catholic Diocese due to its privatization in 2008.  History  Johnstown Catholic High School opened on September 8, 1922, after Catholic parishioners of Johnstown raised $100,000 for their own school. An initial freshman class of 127 students enrolled with the plan of enrolling a new freshman class each year until all four classes had been filled. Only 50 students of the original 122 graduated in the Class of 1926. An auditorium and gym were added to the school in 1929. The 1930s and 1940s brought the Great Depression, a flood and World War II, each of which affected Catholic High as it did the rest of the nation. The Class of 1943 had its graduation postponed due to the war, and the Class of 1946 dedicated its yearbook to the 29 students killed in action throughout the course of the war. By the 1950s, Johnstown Catholic's students and faculty had outgrown their building. In 1960, construction began to renovate and expand the school to include plans for the science, commercial, and music departments as well as a permanent chapel for the school community to celebrate the Eucharist. The original building had three structures added to it. On May 27, 1962, Johnstown Catholic High School was renamed to Bishop McCort High School, in honor of the late Bishop John McCort, whose vision had begun the work 40 years earlier.https://www.mccort.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=427076&type;=d&pREC;_ID=931548 In 1989, William Rushin became the first lay person to be named principal of BMHS.

It was created by two members of the Jesuit order, Alan McGuckian and Peter Scally, and was managed by the Jesuit Communication Centre, Dublin, Ireland, until June 2008. The site is updated daily, guiding users through a ten-minute session of prayer centered on a passage of scripture. History The notion of a website about prayer came to the two Jesuits when they were working in communications. McGuckian and Scally noticed that increasing numbers of office workers sit at a computer for hours every day, often doing repetitive work. They reasoned that people work better if they break that routine every now and again; and prayer is one way of breaking the routine.\\"Sacred Space\\", The Messenger, Irish Jesuits, December 2006 People as far away as the Arctic Circle and Australia log onto the site. Speaking in The Tablet, Jan 18, 2003, Scally stated, \\"A person at the computer has a sense of privacy and intimacy; comfortable, upright, and attentive, subconsciously screening out all distractions, he concentrates on the screen -gazes in fact on that screen. What better description of the attitude of attentive listening to God?\\"Botelho, Jude. \\"Church on the Internet\\", Communication as Mission, National Consultation at Ishvani Kendra, Pune, ed. by L. Stanislaus, Indian Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, Delhi, 2007 The appeal of the Internet for prayer is perhaps understandable, not only because it provides the user with the privacy needed for personal prayer, but also because the multi media approach to prayer, now offered by many websites makes prayer more stimulating than a mental exercise.  Developments  Sacred Space attracts over five million visits annually. Most of this traffic has been engendered by word of mouth. The website has been produced in almost thirty languages over the site's lifetime. This level of interest led an Australian publishing house, Michelle Anderson Publishing, to approach the Jesuit Communication Centre about bringing out a hard-copy version of the daily prayers. Ave Maria Press, Veritas and Jesuit Communications in Manila, also bring out annual volumes of Sacred Space - The Prayer Book of which a Kindle edition is also available from Amazon. Advent and Lent editions have proven popular and have helped thousands of people to bring the simple yet helpful structure to their prayer.

It consists of two major through truss spans over the main and back channels of the river, of http://pghbridges.com/pittsburghW/0581-4479/ocrr1915.htm and respectively, with deck truss approaches.  History  The original Ohio Connecting Bridge was built in 1890 by the Ohio Connecting Railway. It was a single-track bridge. It was built as a freight bypass so the freight trains of the Pennsylvania Railroad could bypass the congested passenger station in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Traffic could move in either direction between the Pennsylvania Railroad main line in Pitcairn, Pennsylvania (part of the Pittsburgh Division at that location) and the Fort Wayne Line at the north end of the Ohio Connecting Bridge. Trains would traverse the Port Perry Branch, Monongahela Division, and Panhandle Division in order to reach the Pittsburgh Division or the Fort Wayne Line. By 1915 the original bridge was not large enough to handle the increasing freight traffic, so a new bridge was built with two tracks. The new bridge was built around the old bridge while the old bridge was still in service. The new bridge also had a siding and car elevator in the center so coal could be delivered to the coal-fired power plant on the island. This 1915 bridge is still in service. The north end of the bridge has a wye so trains can be directed west or east. If a train is directed east it must pass next to Island Avenue Yard on the Isle Connector to get to the mainline. Trains at the south end of the bridge could be directed east onto the Monongahela Division or south/southwest onto the Panhandle Division, Scully Yard, or onto the Chartiers Branch. In 1968 the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with the New York Central to form Penn Central. Penn Central became a part of Conrail in 1976. In 1999, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) bought Conrail, with NS getting 58% and CSX getting 42%. The Ohio Connecting Bridge was acquired by NS.  The present  NS continues to use the bridge as part of the route trains with double-stack containers use. This practice was started by Conrail in 1995. It now connects the Mon Line, and the P&OC; RR with the Fort Wayne Line and Main Line. The entire Panhandle Division/Weirton Secondary was abandoned in 1991, as required by the US Federal Government. Many coal trains coming out of the Monongahela Valley also use this bridge. Sometimes mixed freight and other types of trains use the bridge. No scheduled passenger trains use the bridge.

Founded in 2010, Wild Things Zoofari travels all over the state, servicing schools and libraries. History In 1996, Courtney, the founder of Wild Things Zoofari, worked as a veterinary technician for Dr. Kent Arnold at Equine Veterinary Services. This was her first medical and professional experience with animals. In 2000, she extended her knowledge by working with well-known Dr. Rohn Hendricks, DVM at Hendricks Equine Veterinary Services in Waxahachie, Texas. In 2005 after leaving her job with Dr. Hendricks, she moved to Austin, Texas. She started working at Avian Angels and began breeding and producing various exotic birds for the pet trade. During that adventure, she explored the exotic animal field. Five years later she decided that there was not enough support to help conserve and protect the wildlife. She decided to create Wild Things Zoofari, Inc. to educate people with animal encounters. In January 2015, Wild Things Zoofari is to satisfy the growing demand of educational programs in Texas. This growth led to the hiring of 2 animal specialist Ray Don Mitchell and Tiffany Tasa. Ray having over 20 years raising exotic animals in the private sector and Tiffany with a Rangeland Ecology & Management / Wildlife & Fisheries degree from Texas A&M; University. In May 2015, Wild Things Zoofari started franchising. Founder of Wild Things Zoofari, Courtney Cortina Pineda Wild Things Zoofari performs over 400 animal shows in libraries and schools around the state of Texas a year. On Thursday July 9, 2014 Wild Things Zoofari attracted over 300 children and adults to the Copperas Cove Library.

In July 2015, Wild Things Zoofari launched the program \\"Kiss A Pig\\", designed to encourage summer reading in children. The librarian will have to kiss a pig if the children read over 100,000 minutes. In the November/December 2012 edition of the Feline Conservation Federation's Magazine, Volume 55, Issue 6, Wild Things Zoofari bobcat, Nala, was featured as one of the most amazing animal ambassadors. Courtney gave insight on how to properly care for bobcats. Conservation Wild Things Zoofari supports protecting animals and providing them safe atmospheres. They support Proyecto Titi, a program that assists in the survival of endangered cotton-top tamarins and their habitats. Zoofari's own conservation efforts currently extend to cotton-top tamarins, ring-tailed lemur, and chinchillas.

Controversy and criticism There have long been allegations that animal shows, reptile shows, and exotic petting zoos are abusive and not helpful to the species involved. Animal rights group PETA argues that petting zoos such as Wild Things Zoofari cause undue stress to animals and are not adequately regulated by the USDA. Wild Things Zoofari believes in education through hands-on experience. The company argues that by having access to these animals and being educated on their plight in the wild, young people will grow into conservation-minded adults and pass this along to their children.

He was the son of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 2nd Baronet and Elizabeth Stanhope, daughter and heiress of John Stanhope, 1st Baron Stanhope of Harrington. Family Around 1648, Tollemache married Elizabeth Murray, the daughter of William Murray, 1st Earl of Dysart and 'whipping boy' to King Charles I. Sir Lionel and Lady Dysart had eleven children, five of whom survived to adulthood: *Lionel, his eldest son, inherited the Earldom of Dysart on his mother's death in 1698. *Elizabeth Tollemache (1659–1735) married Archibald Campbell, 1st Duke of Argyll. *Catherine Tollemache married James Stewart, Lord Doune and secondly John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland. *Thomas Tollemache, Lieutenant-General, abandoned the family's devotion to the House of Stuart and became a key supporter of William of Orange. *William Tollemache (1661–1694) was a captain in the Royal Navy. He and his wife, who were both fervent royalists, moved to her house at Ham in Surrey, which in due course became a centre for the activities of the Sealed Knot. Together they were in contact with Charles Stuart, later Charles II, then in exile on the continent. Rather surprisingly however, Elizabeth was also said to be on very good terms with the Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell, leading to claims that he was the real father of some of her children, since discounted. Tollemache appears to have been plagued with ill-health throughout much of his life. Augustus Hare, in The Story of My Life (1900) suggested that this was as a result of his being slowly poisoned by his wife, who had used up his fortune turning Ham House into a grand palace and now needed new sources of income with which to pay off her creditors. There is no evidence to back up such a claim however and it must be seen that Elizabeth's reputation has suffered from its subsequent association with that of her second husband, John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, whom it was said she charmed even as her husband 's health deteriorated. Tollemache travelled to France in search of cures for his debilitating sickness, but died in Paris. In 1670 Elizabeth obtained confirmation from King Charles that she could pass on the title of Earl of Dysart to any one of her children.

It remained active until 1972, when it was dissolved. Origin In 1928, the Alberta government (Alberta, Canada) passed eugenics legislation that enabled the involuntary sterilization of individuals classified as mentally deficient (now known as persons with a developmental disability or mental disorder), with the consent of the patient or his/her guardian or next-of-kin. To implement the Sexual Sterilization Act, a four-member Alberta Eugenics Board was created to recommend individuals for sterilization. The Act was amended in 1937 to allow sterilization without consent. In 1972, the Act was repealed and the Board dismantled. During its 43 years in operation, the Board approved nearly 5,000 cases and 2,832 sterilizations were performed. The actions of the Board came under public scrutiny in 1995 with Leilani Muir's successful lawsuit against the Alberta government for wrongful sterilization. Eugenics: Like begets like Although Mendelian inheritance principles were well understood by geneticists in 1928,Wahlsten, 1997, p. 186 advocates of the eugenics movement held onto the unfounded premise that \\"like begets like\\". They believed that social degenerates would procreate and pass on their \\"undesirable\\" traits to their offspring. Although it was known at the time, for recessive disorders, like does not always beget like, and with dominant disorders, there is only a 50% risk of transmissionWahlsten, p. 187 to the child. The progeny of parents with mental deficiencies are not always born with an inherited disorder. Mental disorder phenotypes are influenced by environmental interactions, such as German measles, and are often independent of an individual's genome. Historical context The province of Alberta was the first part of the British Empire to adopt a sterilization law, and was the only Canadian province that vigorously implemented it.Wahlsten, 1997 Eugenics was widely discussed in the U.S. at the time and British Columbia and Alberta were influenced by American trends. During early debates regarding the sexual sterilization bill in Alberta, there were many references made to U.S. legislation.Wahlsten, 1997 As Canada was being populated by immigrants, the eugenics movement was emerging and gaining the support of influential sponsors,Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004; Pringle, 1997; Puplampu, 2008; Wahlsten, 1997 such as J.S. Woodsworth, Emily Murphy, Helen MacMurchy, Louise McKinney, Irene Parlby, Nellie McClung, and Robert Charles Wallace. In Alberta, eugenics supporters had seemingly positive intentions with the goal of bettering the gene pool and society at large. In 1918, the Canadian National Committee on Mental Hygiene (CNCMH) was established by Dr. Clarence Hincks. The Committee's aim was \\"to fight crime, prostitution, and unemployment\\" which it claimed was strongly tied to feeble-mindedness.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, p. 362 One of the projects that the CNCMH and Hincks took on, along with Dr. C.K. Clarke, was conducting provincial surveys of mental institutions in 1919, and making subsequent recommendations to the provincial government.McLaren, 1990 Visiting several institutions, the results of their survey, published in 1921, attributed social inefficiency and corruption to mental inadequacy, and recommended sterilization as a preventative measure.McLaren, 1990 They claimed to have found \\"scientific proof\\" linking feeble-mindedness to social issues.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, p. 362 At the United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) party convention in 1922, in response to this survey, the Alberta government was called on to draft and implement legislation for the segregation of feeble-minded adults.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 The government was also asked to investigate the feasibility of implementing a sterilization program in Alberta. R.G. Reid, the Minister of Health, assured eugenics supporters that the provincial government was in favour of a sterilization program, and was only waiting for public opinion to catch up. The United Farm Women of Alberta lobbied for sterilization laws,Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 and members used their connections with the UFA government to get legislation passed. At a campaign in 1924, president Margaret Gunn proclaimed, \\"Democracy was never intended for degenerates\\".Cairney, 1996, p. 791 The rationale that eugenics supporters gave was that families with \\"defective\\" offspring were a financial burden on the province,Wahlsten, 1997 especially in times of economic adversity. On March 25, 1927, George Hoadley, Minister of Agriculture and Health in John E. Brownlee's UFA government, introduced a sexual sterilization bill. The bill faced enormous opposition, primarily from the Conservative and Liberal parties, and did not pass the second reading. Hoadley promised to reintroduce it the following year and, on February 23, 1928, the bill was passed. On March 21, 1928, the lieutenant governor gave royal assent to the Sexual Sterilization Act. Brought in by the UFA, the Act remained in place under the following Social Credit governments of William Aberhart and Ernest Manning, which amended the Act in 1937 to allow sterilization without consent, and the first year of the Progressivr Conservative government.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 After Peter Lougheed's Progressive Conservative government took power, the Alberta Eugenics Board was finally disbanded and the Sexual Sterilization Act repealed in 1972.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004; Pringle, 1997 Board structure The Alberta Eugenics Board was created in order to administer the province's eugenics program. The Sexual Sterilization Act required that a four-person Board determine, on a case by case basis, whether sterilization was appropriate for a particular individual.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 The Act gave the Board power to review cases of patients living in or discharged from mental institutions and order their sterilization, if deemed necessary. A unanimous decision required, as was consent from the patient, parent, or guardian and was essential for the surgical procedures to proceed.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 The Act put in place specific requirements for its board members: two members were required to be medical practitioners, nominated by the Senate of the University of Alberta and the Council of the College of Physicians.Puplampu, 2008 The other two non-medical members were appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, and had esteemed reputations. =The original four members= The first members appointed to the Alberta Eugenics Board were: *Dr. E. Pope, Edmonton *Dr. E.G. Mason, Calgary *Dr. J.M. MacEachran, Edmonton *Mrs. Jean H. Field, Kinuso.Frost, 1942 Dr. MacEachran, a philosopher and professor at the University of Alberta, was appointed Chair, and he served continuously in this position for nearly 40 years,Pringle, 1997 resigning in 1965.Puplampu, 2008 He was succeeded by Dr. R.K. Thompson, a medical doctor who chaired the Board until the Sexual Sterilization Act was repealed in 1972.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Over the Board's 43-year duration, there were only 21 board members.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Between 1929 and 1972, all four members were present for approximately 97% of the 398 meetings that were held.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Board meetings and procedures The first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board took place in January 1929. At the second meeting, in March 1929, the Board established a protocol to be followed during its quarterly meetings.Frost, 1942 At meetings the superintendents of Alberta mental institutions presented cases to the Board, along with prepared presentation summaries for each individual considered for sterilization.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 These summaries documented: family history, sexual history, medical history and diagnosis, personality, psychosocial development, education, results of IQ testing, criminal record, ethnicity, religion, age, and other information that could be used to inform the Board's decision.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Presenting mental institutions in Alberta included: the Alberta Hospital in Ponoka, the Provincial Training School (later known as Alberta School Hospital/Deerhome, and Michener Center) in Red Deer, and the Alberta Hospital in Oliver.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Patients were then interviewed by the Board and recommendations were made for sterilization. If they could not attend, members sometimes saw the patient in their institutional ward. Consent was initially required for all operational procedures, either from the patients, their parent or guardian.Wahlsten, 1997 A competent surgeon was appointed to the case; however the Act stated they were not liable to any civil action. Various types of operations were performed: vasectomies, salpingectomies (tubal ligation), orchidectomies (removal of the testes), oophorectomies (removal of the ovaries), and sometimes hysterectomies.Frost, 1942 Operations took place in approved hospitals designated by the Board. In addition to the appointed board members and presenters, it was not uncommon for other professionals, support staff, or visitors to attend patient interviews. Typically, 4–15 people attended Board meetings, averaging 8.4 persons per meeting. On average, the Board spent approximately 13 minutes reviewing each case, and members discussed about 13 cases per meeting.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 The Board retained individual-level files for all of the cases considered. One of the Board's main concerns was tracking the number of people processed. In addition to the routine case reviews, members spent time during 63% of its meetings discussing general issues, signing forms, and reviewing correspondence.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Amendments to the Sexual Sterilization Act By 1937, 400 operations had been completed and amendments to the Act were made. The first amendment came shortly after the Social Credit government came into power in 1935. The new Minister of Health, Dr. W.W. Cross, was dismayed that only hundreds of individuals had been sterilized when thousands could have been due to consent requirements. Following the change in legislation, if individuals were regarded as mental defectives, consent was no longer necessary for their sterilization.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 A month after this amendment a special Alberta Eugenics Board meeting was held in order to review past cases of individuals who were now eligible for sterilization. Another part of the 1937 amendment increased the Board's power: sterilization procedures were approved if the Board deemed an individual \\"incapable of intelligent parenthood\\".Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 The success of this amendment was celebrated in 1937 in an article published by two mental health professionals, R.R. MacLean and E.J. Kibblewhite, where they noted the increasing simplicity with which the Board could proceed with its business.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 In 1942, an additional amendment widened the application of the Act to include more mental patients.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Non-psychotic individuals with syphilis, epilepsy, and Huntington's Chorea were now encompassed by the Act; however, for reasons unknown, the Board maintained that consent was still required for these cases. Board actions Between 1929 and 1972, 4,785 cases were presented to the Alberta Eugenics Board, and 99% of these cases were approved.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Of all the approved cases, 60% were completed resulting in the sterilization of 2,832 of Alberta's children and adults in the Board's 43-year history.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 There was a high correlation between absence of consent requirement and subsequent sterilization: 89% of all presented and approved cases did not require consent for sterilization to occur, as opposed to 15% of cases where consent was necessary.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Beginning in the 1940s, women were more likely to be presented to the Board than men, even though they constituted less than 40% of all patients in the feeder institutions. On average, 64% of all women whose cases were presented to the Board were sterilized in comparison to 54% of men. Of the 2,832 sterilization procedures completed, 58% were performed on females. The over-representation of women may reflect gender role expectations, where these women were considered \\"incapable of intelligent parenting\\".Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 In addition to women, the Board targeted youth and young adults for sterilization.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Although they made up less than 20% of the Albertan population at the time, they comprised 44% of all presented cases and 55% of all sterilization cases.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Children and patients who were age 40 and older were notably under- represented, as the Board focused its efforts on individuals in the \\"child- bearing years\\" – those who were able and most likely to reproduce.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Over four decades, aboriginals (i.e., Indians, Métis, and Eskimo) were the foremost targets of the Board's actions.Christian, 1974; Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Only representing 2–3% of Alberta's population, they comprised 6% of all presented sterilization cases. Of all aboriginal cases presented to the Board, 74% resulted in sterilization.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Regarding the feeder institutions, the Alberta Hospital in Ponoka was responsible for about 60% of all cases considered, followed by the Provincial Training School and Deerhome in Red Deer with 25%, and the Alberta Hospital in Oliver with 14%.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Board controversy The majority of Alberta Eugenics Board activities were conducted in secret, sheltered from public criticism and legislative scrutiny.Wahlsten, 1997 This secrecy and lack of transparency, combined with the cooperation of the provincial government and feeder institutions, resulted in the Board pursuing illicit activities not encompassed by the Act.Wahlsten, 1997 The fact that the Board approved 99% of all presented cases calls into question the validity and accountability of its procedures. Some cases were approved even when patients' IQ scores were above the criterion score established by the Board for sterilization. At times, surgeons performed operations without the Board's approval. Sterilization procedures were also ordered for individuals who were already infertile – most notably, a group of 15 boys with Down syndrome where testicular biopsy tissue was surgically removed for the purpose of medical research.Wahlsten, 1997 Repeal The Progressive Conservative party led by Peter Lougheed came to power in 1971 and, a year later, passed the Alberta Bill of Rights. Shortly after, the new provincial government revoked the Sexual Sterilization Act and folded the Alberta Eugenics Board,Pringle, 1997 citing three reasons: # Primarily, the Act violated fundamental human rights. # It was based on medical and genetics theories which are now of questionable scientific validity. # It was full of legal ambiguities, most notably in the section exempting surgeons from civil liability. In the mid-1990s, Leilani Muir, a victim of involuntary sterilization in 1959, sued the Alberta government for wrongful sterilization.Wahlsten, 1997 The case went to full trial in 1995, Muir won the case in 1996, and she was awarded nearly C$1 million in damages and legal costs.Wahlsten, 1997; Muir v. The Queen in Right of Alberta, 1996 Since Muir's precedent-setting trial, over 850 victims have filed lawsuits against the Alberta government; the majority of these have been settled out of court and C$142 million in damages have been awarded.CBC, 1999 See also *Compulsory sterilization in Canada Notes References *Cairney, R.

He served as a medical orderly in World War I serving on Gallipoli, and as a senior surgeon for the Australian Army Medical Corps in World War II in Malaya. He was captured by the Japanese and during his time as a POW, worked as a surgeon for the many Allied POWs working to build the Burma-Thailand Railway. Early life Coates was born in Mount Pleasant, a suburb of Ballarat, Victoria in 1895 in Australia. Aged 11 years, he left school and went to work as a butcher and an apprentice bookbinder. His primary school teacher, Mr Leslie Morshead, later Lt-Gen Sir Leslie Morshead, CO 9th Div AIF, offered to teach Albert at night school. He studied languages and sciences, and at 18 years sat the matriculation equivalent, receiving 5 distinctions. He left his apprenticeship and obtained work at the Melbourne and subsequently Wangaratta PO while he studied pre-med subjects to facilitate his enrollment in the University of Melbourne medical school.http://www.pows- of-japan.net/articles/37.htm First World War service In 1914 Coates enlisted in the 7th Battalion as a medical orderly and the following year served on Gall poli. Coates was one of the last to leave the peninsula on the night of 19/20 December 1915. His battalion was then transferred to France in March 1916 and fought in the battle of the Somme. His skill as a linguist came to the attention of his superiors and in February 1917 he was attached to the intelligence staff, I Anzac Corps. Sir John Monash and British authorities recognised his ability and, at the end of the war, he was invited to apply for a commission in the British Army. Coates preferred, however, to go home to Australia where he found employment in the office of the Commonwealth censor in Melbourne. Between The Wars After the war and on his return to Australia Coates worked nights as a postal worker to support himself through medical school. In 1925 Coates became a resident at (Royal) Melbourne Hospital. He worked with Professor Richard Berry in the university's department of anatomy, first as a Stewart lecturer (1925–26) and next as acting-professor (1927). Back at (Royal) Melbourne Hospital, he was appointed honorary surgeon to out-patients in 1927 and to in-patients in 1935. Following his first wife's death he visited surgical centres in Britain, Europe and North America; shortly after his return he was asked to establish the neurosurgical unit at the R.M.H. From 1936 to 1940 he was part-time lecturer in surgical anatomy at the University of Melbourne. Coates remained active in the military and by the outbreak of war was a captain in the Australian Army Medical Corps. Second World War and capture in Sumatra Appointed lieutenant colonel, Australian Army Medical Corps, on 1 January 1941, Coates joined the Australian Imperial Force next day aged 46. He was posted to the 2nd/10th Australian General Hospital and stationed at Malacca, Malaya. After the Japanese invaded on 8 December, the 2nd/10th A.G.H. fell back to Singapore; Coates was ordered to join a party which sailed on 13 February 1942 for Java, Netherlands East Indies. The convoy was bombed and the survivors reached Tembilahan, Sumatra, where Coates saved many lives with his surgical skill. He made himself responsible for treating all British casualties, and felt duty-bound to stay with them, though he could have left on several occasions. On 28 February he arrived at Padang which was occupied by the Japanese three weeks later and Coates became a prisoner of war. POW Burma- Thailand Railway The operating theatre at the prisoner-of-war hospital, Nakom Paton, Thailand, where Coates was Chief Medical Officer. In May 1942 the Japanese moved Coates to Burma. At the Kilo-30 and Kilo-55 camps on the Burma- Thailand Railway he cared for hundreds of prisoners of war under deplorable conditions. Coates subsequently described his medical practice at Kilo-55 to the International Military Tribunal for the Far East: in a bamboo lean-to, with his only instruments a knife, two pairs of artery forceps and a saw (used by the camp butchers and carpenters), his daily work consisted of 'segregating the sick from the very sick . . . curetting seventy or eighty ulcers during the morning . . . and, in the afternoon, proceeding to amputate nine or ten legs'. In December 1943 the Japanese sent Coates to Thailand. There, from March 1944, he was chief medical officer of a prisoner-of-war hospital (10,000 beds) at Nakhon Pathom (Nakompaton). Through 'his initiative, resource and enthusiasm he was responsible for many improvisations which provided artificial limbs, transfusions and surgical appliances'. (Sir) Edward Dunlop recalled that Coates's 'short, upright figure with a ghost of a swagger, a Burma cheroot clamped in his mouth, and his staccato flow of kindly, earthly wisdom became the object of hero-worship and inspiration'. With the cessation of hostilities, Coates returned to Melbourne in October 1945, transferred to the Reserve of Officers on 6 December and was appointed O.B.E. in 1946. Coates was a key witness at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal in '46, was appointed an OBE in '47, was an RSL delegate at the signing of the Peace Treaty in the USA in '51, and was knighted by the Queen in '55. Lieutenant-Colonel E.E. ‘Weary’ Dunlop and Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Coates at Nakhon Pathom hospital camp, Thailand. Both are looking at sketches made by British artist Jack Bridger Chalker. While Dunlop was the senior officer at Nakhon Pathom, he deferred to Coates’ extensive medical knowledge. Coates had served during World War I and was also well-known and respected among prisoners of war. Career In between the wars, Coates studied surgery and helped to establish the Neurosurgical Society of Australia. He returned to surgical work following World War Two later became Senior Surgeon at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Stewart Lecturer in Surgery at the University of Melbourne. He was made a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS). Albert Coates died in Melbourne in 1977, survived by his wife, two sons (both doctors) and three daughters (two nurses and a teacher). A eulogy was given at his funeral by (Sir) Edward Dunlop. Awards and recognition Coates was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (Military) in 1946 for \\"distinguished service in the field\\". He was knighted in 1955 and in 1981 was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (Civil) for his \\"services to the handicapped and veterans\\". A statue in honour of Sir Albert Ernest Coates is located in the main street of his home town of Ballarat. A laneway in the Queen Victoria Village is named Albert Coates Lane in his honour.

As a membership organisation, the majority of its funding comes from subscription fees and events. As one of the National Amenity Societies, The Victorian Society is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings, and by law must be notified of any work to a listed building which involves any element of demolition. Its counterpart organisations for the protection of the heritage of earlier and later periods are the Georgian Group (for buildings erected between 1700 and 1840) and The Twentieth Century Society (for post-1914 buildings).  History  The society's foundation was proposed in November 1957 by Anne Parsons, Countess of Rosse at her remarkably-preserved Victorian home at 18 Stafford Terrace, Kensington (Linley Sambourne House), with the intention of countering the widely prevalent antipathy to 19th- and early 20th-century architecture. From the 1890s into the 20th century, Victorian art had been under attack, critics writing of \\"the nineteenth century architectural tragedy\\", ridiculing \\"the uncompromising ugliness\\" of the era's buildings and attacking the \\"sadistic hatred of beauty\\" of its architects. The commonly-held view had been expressed by P. G. Wodehouse in his 1933 novel, Summer Moonshine: \\"Whatever may be said in favour of the Victorians, it is pretty generally admitted that few of them were to be trusted within reach of a trowel and a pile of bricks.\\" The first meeting was held at Linley Sambourne House on 28 February 1958. Among its thirty founder members were the first secretary John Betjeman, Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Nikolaus Pevsner, who became Chairman in 1964. Former Bletchley Park codebreaker, Jane Fawcett, managed the society's affairs as secretary from 1964 to 1976. Joe O'Donnell succeeded Christopher Costelloe as Director in September 2020.  Work  The society has worked to save numerous landmark buildings such as St Pancras Station, Albert Dock in Liverpool, the Foreign Office and Oxford University Museum. Its campaigns have not always been successful, notably its failed attempts to save the Euston Arch from demolition in 1961. As well as being a statutory consultee on works to listed buildings, the society also: * Provides advice to churches and local planning authorities on how Victorian and Edwardian buildings and landscapes can be adapted to modern use, while keeping what is distinctive about them. * Advises members of the public on how they can help shape the future of their local Victorian and Edwardian buildings and landscapes. * Provides information to owners of Victorian and Edwardian houses about how they can better look after their buildings. * Helps people understand, appreciate and enjoy the architectural heritage of the Victorian and Edwardian period through its publications and events. Examples of the society's work with churches include making complaints against proposals of church PCCs to use upholstered chairs during renovation, and appealing against proposals to raise money by selling original features. In 2015 the society launched a campaign to preserve Victorian gasometers, after utility companies announced plans to demolish nearly 200 of the now-outdated structures. Christopher Costelloe, the society's director, commented: \\"Gasometers, by their very size and structure, cannot help but become landmarks. [They] are singularly dramatic structures for all their emptiness.\\" The society publishes an annual list of the Top Ten Most Endangered Victorian or Edwardian Buildings in England and Wales.  The Victorian magazine  Published three times a year since 1998 for the members of the Society, The Victorian magazine contains book reviews, society news and events, casework reports, and interviews. Victorian Society in America The Victorian Society has a sister organisation in the United States, the Victorian Society in America, founded in 1966 in New York City, by such champions of historic preservation as Brendan Gill, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, and Margot Gayle; it was borne from the outrage they felt at the 1964 destruction of New York's magnificent Pennsylvania Station. the Victorian Society in America is based in Philadelphia with 12 registered chapters, mostly in the Eastern United States.

It is one of only two churches designed by Louis Sullivan, one of the seminal architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places and is designated a Chicago Landmark. History The church was commissioned by a growing Orthodox community consisting of Rusyns, Russians, Serbs and Greeks of Chicago, Illinois, and stands within the neighborhood known today as Ukrainian Village. The founders of the church were immigrants from Carpathian Rus', Galicia, and the Balkans. It remains one of only two Orthodox churches servicing the Orthodox-Christian community in Ukrainian Village. Construction work, partly financed by a donation of 4,000 roubles or ~$2700 from Tsar St. Nicholas II of Russia, and Louis Sullivan donated part of his fee ~$1250 and the elaborate Healy & Millet manufactured chandelier (value unknown). The church retains many features of Russian provincial architecture, including an octagonal dome and a frontal belltower. It is believed that the emigrants wished the church to be \\"remindful of the small, intimate, rural buildings they left behind in the Old World\\".Marilyn Joyce Segal Chiat.

Archival references point to a small wooden church in the Siberian village of Tatarskaya as a particular inspiration for the final design.Holy Trinity Orthodox Cathedral, \\"Celebrating a Spiritual and Architectural Icon.\\" Chicago (no publication date, but available from the cathedral as of January 2012). To this traditional Russian basis of the overall design, Sullivan added decorative elements more characteristic of his own larger corpus of work, influenced by the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements, as seen, for example, in the decorative design over the western entrance to the church, the window and roof framing, and the bell tower and cupolas. The church is highlighted in numerous books on church architecture, among them Chicago Churches: A Photographic Essay by Elizabeth Johnson (Uppercase Books Inc, 1999) as well as The Spiritual Traveler's Guide to Chicago and Illinois by Marilyn Chiat (HiddenSpring 2004). The church was consecrated by St. Tikhon of Moscow and was under the spiritual guidance of St. John of Chicago (Kochurov) during its early years. The church was elevated to a cathedral in 1923, and stands today a member of the Orthodox community in Chicago. It serves as the cathedral church of the Orthodox Church in America with Priest Alexander Koranda.

These areas now make up the cities of St. Francis and Cudahy as well as part of the South Side of the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. History On January 2, 1838, the territorial legislature divided the County into two townships: the Town of Milwaukee, encompassing everything north of the present Greenfield Avenue, and the Town of Lake, encompassing everything South of the present Greenfield Avenue; \\"and the polls of election shall be opened at the house of Elisha Higgins, in said town.\\" On March 8, 1839, a new Town of Kinnikennick was created, encompassing the western part of Lake (later the Towns of Greenfield and Franklin); and on August 13, 1840, the south portion of the Town of Lake was split off to form the town of Oak Creek. As of the 1840 census, the population of the Town of Lake (then including Oak Creek) was 418.Watrous, Jerome Anthony. Memoirs of Milwaukee County: from the earliest historical times down to the present, including a genealogical and biographical record of representative families in Milwaukee County, Chicago: Western Historical Association, 1909; Volume 1, pp. 68-69 According to the 1855 Wisconsin State Census, the Town of Lake's population was 2,127, with 1,308 of them having foreign birth. The next diminution of the town took place in 1879 when Bay View incorporated as a village. Milwaukee annexed the north portions of the town soon after, and Bay View voted to allow Milwaukee to annex it in 1887. Patrick Cudahy bought land in the area in 1892 for his meatpacking business. In 1895, this area was incorporated as the Village of Cudahy. After becoming a city, Cudahy later annexed lands south to the border of South Milwaukee. In July 1951, the area along Lake Michigan north of Cudahy and south of Milwaukee incorporated as the City of St. Francis in order to prevent annexation from Milwaukee and keep profits from the South Shore Power Plant in the area. The City of Milwaukee annexed the remaining portion of the town on April 6, 1954, at which point the town ceased to exist. The City of Milwaukee grew by about 15,000 people overnight. As part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Public Works Administration New Deal, an octagonal tower was built in 1938. It was to be the Lake City Hall and doubled as a water tower. This landmark features Art Deco details such as empire lines on the façade, scallops above the entrance and stair railings with chevron designs in them. No longer needed by the neighboring Department of Water Works treatment plant to equalize water pressure, the internal tank was abandoned and the building updated for use as municipal office space in 2001.Town Lake Tower In 1993, the Howard Avenue Water Purification Plant became the source of the Milwaukee Cryptosporidium outbreak, the largest documented waterborne disease outbreak in United States history.

It involved claims for possession by two landlords (in each case local authorities) against former short-term occupiers, heavily placing reliance in their defence on article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, with circumstances outwith the other laws.Home sweet home? The European Court of Human Rights accorded a generous margin of appreciation to the national authorities, attaching much importance to the facts of the case. Thus, it was for the courts to decide how in the first instance the principles expounded in Strasbourg should be applied in the special context of national legislation, practice and social and other considerations. To those decisions the ordinary rules of precedent should apply. Facts Lambeth and Leeds Councils owned flats and a park (respectively) with differing, successive short-term residential occupiers. The facts, essentially unchanged, at the time of the hearings of the Leeds first hearing, appeal and final appeal – two days of possession – fell so far short of the threshold for establishing article 8 rights laid down in the binding appeal decision, Harrow LBC v Qazi and jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, that its facts and its decision against the squatters/trespassers were closely interwoven in all the final judgments (therefore presented together in one section below). =Lambeth Council= The homes were scheduled for demolition or redevelopment. The Council did not have sufficient funds to redevelop them. For more than two decades they made informal arrangements with a housing Trust (\\"the Trust\\") under which the Trust was able to make the properties available for occupation, inter alia: by homeless persons to whom the authority owed no existing duty (to rehouse or assist in finding accommodation). The Trust on the face of it granted sub-licences (as opposed to sub-leases) to such people as occupiers. The Council and the Trust made between each other agreements a few years into the arrangements, intended to formalise the terms: the Council granted the Trust licences of all the properties. The 1999 ruling in Bruton v London & Quadrant Housing Trust [2000] UKHL meant that all standard, typical professed \\"licences\\" granted by such a trust/entity to individuals as their home such as by the Trust - including those granted to the defendant occupiers - were, in law, tenancies (short leases). During or after Bruton, the Council replaced its licences with leases, but with break clauses permitting termination by either party on written notice. The Council exercised these by serving notice and the Trust did not contest their validity which left the Council to seek possession against the occupiers on the ground that, on termination of the leases, they (the defendants) had become trespassers; they were never its tenants, nor its licensees. The defendants (now appellants) contended, foremost, that even if they had become trespassers, they could remain by reference to their human rights as the owners had to apply article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Their arguments were struck down in the county court and appeals to the Court of Appeal. They appealed to the (European) Convention of Human Rights, arguing that there had been a violation of the Article as there had been no determination by the court of the proportionality of the interference. They argued that the approach of the majority who decided the earlier legal decision as to the \\"width\\" of \\"gateway (b)\\" was incompatible with the Article. Facts and judgment in the Leeds appeal Lord Scott combined the fact pattern and legal consequences, as others in their opinions did. Concatenating his paragraphs 123-128: The appellants were the five-adult Maloney family, travellers, whose home was in one or more caravans, often on the move from one place to another. The respondent was Leeds City Council (\\"Leeds\\"). Leeds is the owner of a recreation ground (at Spinkwell Lane). On 13 June 2004 the Maloneys moved onto it, after successively at least two other groups of travellers entered and parked there since the previous month. Two days later, on 15 June, Leeds sued in the County Court for possession. The particulars of claim said that the travellers were trespassers and refused to vacate the recreation ground. 24 June 2004 was the return date specified on the claim form. The Maloney family were the only occupiers of the recreation ground to attend court on that date and they contested. They were formally joined as defendants. The case was adjourned to be heard in October. Leeds' claim to possession was based on its ownership (not in dispute). Nor disputed was that the Maloneys were trespassers who had entered onto and remained on the land without any licence or consent from Leeds. They sought to defend by relying on article 8 and by contending that Leeds was in breach of its statutory obligations to provide suitable sites where gypsies could park their caravans. They said, also, that their personal circumstances were \\"exceptional\\" in that several members of the family suffered from medical and psychiatric problems, three members of the family were school-age children and in the twelve months preceding their trespass the family had been evicted or forced to move under threat of eviction more than fifty times. Leeds responded by notifying the family that their status as unintentionally homeless and in priority need was accepted and by accepting a duty to help them obtain accommodation. On 22 September the case was transferred to the High Court. The article 8 issue was dealt with as a preliminary issue and, on 25 October, HHJ Bush, following Harrow LBC v Qazi, held that contractual and proprietary rights to possession could not be defeated or qualified by reliance on article 8. So he made an order for possession forthwith. He refused a stay of execution but gave leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. Following the order for possession and the refusal of the stay of execution the Maloneys and their caravans left the recreation ground. The family gave notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal apparently \\"for...ventilating the article 8 issue.\\" Tactically this was a misuse both of public (legal aid) money and of court time on a point rendered moot as an appellate court would have no power to order Leeds to permit the Maloneys and their caravans to re-enter the recreation ground, trespassers again as they had been before. No one found any legal argument for any money compensation either. > ...It was common ground that the Article did not give any protection to the > occupation of land or a building unless the land or building is the > occupier's \\"home\\".

As shown above The House of Lords confirmed this rejection based on the facts themselves was the only non-absurd solution, to permit the family to re-enter would be permitting them to trespass onto a public recreation ground. Judgment in the Lambeth appeal In the House of Lords, Lord Bingham gave the leading 49 paragraphs of the judgment. He held that the European Court accorded a generous margin of appreciation to the national authorities, attaching much importance to the facts of the case. Thus, it was for the courts to decide how in the first instance the principles expounded in Strasbourg should be applied in the special context of national legislation, practice and social and other considerations. To those decisions the ordinary rules of precedent should apply.Human Rights and Civil Liberties (Document format) by Steve Foster, Longman, 2003Arden Chambers E-Flash The ruling applies generally to homeless people who are being fairly treated as against other of their status and to whom a local authority fairly would find as lower priority in its duty to assist in finding housing. If such people are granted a sub-licence by a real estate investment trust allowing them to occupy accommodation temporarily they do not, become secured (i.e. tenants) of the local authority. Any earlier transfer (by document) by a local authority is not relevant. Also irrelevant is that the licence may be interpreted in law as an assured shorthold tenancy, as against the real estate investment trust.

In the Buddhist tradition, karma refers to action driven by intention (cetanā) which leads to future consequences. Those intentions are considered to be the determining factor in the kind of rebirth in samsara, the cycle of rebirth. Etymology Karma (Sanskrit, also karman, Pāli: kamma, Tib. las) is a Sanskrit term that literally means \\"action\\" or \\"doing\\". The word karma derives from the verbal root kṛ, which means \\"do, make, perform, accomplish.\\" Karmaphala (Tib. rgyu 'bras) is the \\"fruit\\", \\"effect\\" or \\"result\\" of karma. A similar term is karmavipaka, the \\"maturation\\" or \\"cooking\\" of karma: The metaphor is derived from agriculture: Buddhist understanding of karma Sera, Lhasa. Karma and karmaphala are fundamental concepts in Buddhism. The concepts of karma and karmaphala explain how our intentional actions keep us tied to rebirth in samsara, whereas the Buddhist path, as exemplified in the Noble Eightfold Path, shows us the way out of samsara. =Rebirth= Rebirth,, is a common belief in all Buddhist traditions. It says that birth and death in the six realms occur in successive cycles driven by ignorance (avidyā), desire (trsnā), and hatred (dvesa). The cycle of rebirth is called samsāra. It is a beginningless and ever-ongoing process. Liberation from samsāra can be attained by following the Buddhist Path. This path leads to vidyā, and the stilling of trsnā and dvesa. Hereby the ongoing process of rebirth is stopped. =Karma= The cycle of rebirth is determined by karma, literally \\"action\\". In the Buddhist tradition, karma refers to actions driven by intention (cetanā), a deed done deliberately through body, speech or mind, which leads to future consequences. The Nibbedhika Sutta, Anguttara Nikaya 6.63: According to Peter Harvey, And according to Gombrich, According to Gombrich, this was a great innovation, which overturns brahmanical, caste-bound ethics. It is a rejection of caste- bound differences, giving the same possibility to reach liberation to all people, not just Brahmanins: How this emphasis on intention was to be interpreted became a matter of debate in and between the various Buddhist schools. =Karmaphala= Karma leads to future consequences, karma-phala, \\"fruit of action\\". Any given action may cause all sorts of results, but the karmic results are only those results which are a consequence of both the moral quality of the action, and of the intention behind the action. According to Reichenbach, The \\"law of karma\\" applies Good moral actions lead to wholesome rebirths, and bad moral actions lead to unwholesome rebirths. The main factor is how they contribute to the well-being of others in a positive or negative sense. Especially dāna, giving to the Buddhist order, became an increasingly important source of positive karma. How these intentional actions lead to rebirth, and how the idea of rebirth is to be reconciled with the doctrines of impermanence and no-self, is a matter of philosophical inquiry in the Buddhist traditions, for which several solutions have been proposed. In early Buddhism no explicit theory of rebirth and karma is worked out, and \\"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\\" In early Buddhism, rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance. In later Buddhism, the basic idea is that intentional actions, driven by kleshas (\\"disturbing emotions\\"),Thubten Chodron (1993). The Twelve Links – Part 2 of 5 (PDF) cetanā (\\"volition\\"), or taṇhā (\\"thirst\\", \\"craving\\") create impressions, tendenciesJohn Bowker (1997), Karma, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions or \\"seeds\\" in the mind. These impressions, or \\"seeds\\", will ripen into a future result or fruition.For bīja, see also Yogacara#Karma, seeds and storehouse-consciousness If we can overcome our kleshas, then we break the chain of causal effects that leads to rebirth in the six realms. The twelve links of dependent origination provides a theoretical framework, explaining how the disturbing emotions lead to rebirth in samsara. =Complex process= The Buddha's teaching of karma is not strictly deterministic, but incorporated circumstantial factors, unlike that of the Jains. It is not a rigid and mechanical process, but a flexible, fluid and dynamic process, and not all present conditions can be ascribed to karma. There is no set linear relationship between a particular action and its results. The karmic effect of a deed is not determined solely by the deed itself, but also by the nature of the person who commits the deed, and by the circumstances in which it is committed. Karma is also not the same as \\"fate\\" or \\"predestination\\".What Is Karma?, Linden Karmic results are not a \\"judgement\\" imposed by a God or other all-powerful being, but rather the results of a natural process. Certain experiences in life are the results of previous actions, but our responses to those experiences are not predetermined, although they bear their own fruit in the future. Unjust behaviour may lead to unfavorable circumstances which make it easier to commit more unjust behavior, but nevertheless the freedom not to commit unjust behavior remains. =Liberation from samsāra= The real importance of the doctrine of karma and its fruits lies in the recognition of the urgency to put a stop to the whole process. The Acintita Sutta warns that \\"the results of kamma\\" is one of the four incomprehensible subjects,accesstoinsight, Acintita Sutta: Unconjecturable, Anguttara Nikaya 4.77 subjects that are beyond all conceptualization and cannot be understood with logical thought or reason. According to Gombrich, this sutra may have been a warning against the tendency, \\"probably from the Buddha's day until now\\", to understand the doctrine of karma \\"backwards\\", to explain unfavorable conditions in this life when no other explanations are available. Gaining a better rebirth may have been, and still is, the central goal for many people. The adoption, by laity, of Buddhist beliefs and practices is seen as a good thing, which brings merit and good rebirth, but does not result in Nirvana, and liberation from samsāra, the ultimate goal of the Buddha. Within the Pali suttas According to the Buddhist tradition, the Buddha gained full and complete insight into the workings of karma at the time of his enlightenment. According to Bronkhorst, these knowledges are later additions to the story, just like the notion of \\"liberating insight\\" itself. In AN 5.292, the Buddha asserted that it is not possible to avoid experiencing the result of a karmic deed once it has been committed. In the Anguttara Nikaya, it is stated that karmic results are experienced either in this life (P. diṭṭadhammika) or in future lives (P. samparāyika). The former may involve a readily observable connection between action and karmic consequence, such as when a thief is captured and tortured by the authorities, but the connection need not necessarily be that obvious and in fact usually is not observable. The Sammyutta Nikaya makes a basic distinction between past karma (P. purānakamma) which has already been incurred, and karma being created in the present (P. navakamma).SN.4.132 Therefore, in the present one both creates new karma (P. navakamma) and encounters the result of past karma (P. kammavipāka). Karma in the early canon is also threefold: Mental action (S. manaḥkarman), bodily action (S. kāyakarman) and vocal action (S. vākkarman). Within Buddhist traditions Various Buddhist philosophical schools developed within Buddhism, giving various interpretations regarding more refined points of karma. A major problem is the relation between the doctrine of no-self, and the \\"storage\\" of the traces of one's deeds, for which various solutions have been offered. =Early Indian Buddhism= Origins The concept of karma originated in the Vedic religion, where it was related to the performance of rituals or the investment in good deeds to ensure the entrance to heaven after death, while other persons go to the underworld. Pre-sectarian Buddhism The concept of karma may have been of minor importance in early Buddhism. Schmithausen has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism, noting that \\"the karma doctrine may have been incidental to early Buddhist soteriology.\\" Langer notes that originally karma may have been only one of several concepts connected with rebirth. Tillman Vetter notes that in early Buddhism rebirth is ascribed to craving or ignorance. Buswell too notes that \\"Early Buddhism does not identify bodily and mental motion, but desire (or thirst, trsna), as the cause of karmic consequences.\\" Matthews notes that \\"there is no single major systematic exposition\\" on the subject of karma and \\"an account has to be put together from the dozens of places where karma is mentioned in the texts,\\" which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology. According to Vetter, \\"the Buddha at first sought, and realized, \\"the deathless\\" (amata/amrta), which is concerned with the here and now. Only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth.\\" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha \\"introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time.\\" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire. The doctrine of karma may have been especially important for common people, for whom it was more important to cope with life's immediate demands, such as the problems of pain, injustice, and death. The doctrine of karma met these exigencies, and in time it became an important soteriological aim in its own right. Vaibhāṣika- Sarvāstivādin tradition The Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda was widely influential in India and beyond. Their understanding of karma in the Sarvāstivāda became normative for Buddhism in India and other countries. According to Dennis Hirota, The Abhidharmahṛdaya by Dharmaśrī was the first systematic exposition of Vaibhāśika-Sarvāstivāda doctrine, and the third chapter, the Karma-varga, deals with the concept of karma systematically. Another important exposition, the Mahāvibhāṣa, gives three definitions of karma: # action; karma is here supplanted in the text by the synonyms kriya or karitra, both of which mean \\"activity\\"; # formal vinaya conduct; # human action as the agent of various effects; karma as that which links certain actions with certain effects, is the primary concern of the exposition. The 4th century philosopher Vasubandhu compiled the Abhidharma-kośa, an extensive compendium which elaborated the positions of the Vaibhāṣika-Sarvāstivādin school on a wide range of issues raised by the early sutras. Chapter four of the Kośa is devoted to a study of karma, and chapters two and five contain formulations as to the mechanism of fruition and retribution. This became the main source of understanding of the perspective of early Buddhism for later Mahāyāna philosophers. Dārṣṭāntika-Sautrāntika The Dārṣṭāntika-Sautrāntika school pioneered the idea of karmic seeds (S. Bīja) and \\"the special modification of the psycho-physical series\\" (S. saṃtatipaṇāmaviśeṣa) to explain the workings of karma. According to Dennis Hirota, =Theravādin tradition= Canonical texts In the Theravāda Abhidhamma and commentarial traditions, karma is taken up at length. The Abhidhamma Sangaha of Anuruddhācariya offers a treatment of the topic, with an exhaustive treatment in book five (5.3.7). The Kathāvatthu, which discusses a number of controverted points related either directly or indirectly to the notion of kamma.\\" This involved debate with the Pudgalavādin school, which postulated the provisional existence of the person (S. pudgala, P. puggala) to account for the ripening of karmic effects over time. The Kathāvatthu also records debate by the Theravādins with the Andhakas (who may have been Mahāsāṃghikas) regarding whether or not old age and death are the result (vipāka) of karma. The Theravāda maintained that they are not—not, apparently because there is no causal relation between the two, but because they wished to reserve the term vipāka strictly for mental results--\\"subjective phenomena arising through the effects of kamma.\\" In the canonical Theravāda view of kamma, \\"the belief that deeds done or ideas seized at the moment of death are particularly significant.\\" Transfer of merit The Milindapañha, a paracanonical Theravāda text, offers some interpretations of karma theory at variance with the orthodox position. In particular, Nāgasena allows for the possibility of the transfer of merit to humans and one of the four classes of petas, perhaps in deference to folk belief. Nāgasena makes it clear that demerit cannot be transferred. One scholar asserts that the sharing of merit \\"can be linked to the Vedic śrāddha, for it was Buddhist practice not to upset existing traditions when well- established custom was not antithetic to Buddhist teaching.\\" The Petavatthu, which is fully canonical, endorses the transfer of merit even more widely, including the possibility of sharing merit with all petas. =Mahayana tradition= Indian Yogācāra tradition In the Yogācāra philosophical tradition, one of the two principal Mahāyāna schools, the principle of karma was extended considerably. In the Yogācāra formulation, all experience without exception is said to result from the ripening of karma.An Introduction to Buddhist ethics, Harvey Karmic seeds (S. bija) are said to be stored in the \\"storehouse consciousness\\" (S. ālayavijñāna) until such time as they ripen into experience. The term vāsāna (\\"perfuming\\") is also used, and Yogācārins debated whether vāsāna and bija were essentially the same, the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds. The seemingly external world is merely a \\"by-product\\" (adhipati-phala) of karma. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called saṃskāra.Buddhist Phenomenology: A philosophical Investigation of Yogācāra Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih lun by Dan Lusthaus. The Treatise on Action (Karmasiddhiprakaraṇa), also by Vasubandhu, treats the subject of karma in detail from the Yogācāra perspective. According to scholar Dan Lusthaus, According to Bronkhorst, whereas in earlier systems it \\"was not clear how a series of completely mental events (the deed and its traces) could give rise to non-mental, material effects,\\" with the (purported) idealism of the Yogācāra system this is not an issue. In Mahāyāna traditions, karma is not the sole basis of rebirth. The rebirths of bodhisattvas after the seventh stage (S. bhūmi) are said to be consciously directed for the benefit of others still trapped in . Thus, theirs are not uncontrolled rebirths. Mādhyamaka philosophy Nāgārjuna articulated the difficulty in forming a karma theory in his most prominent work, the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (Fundamental Verses on the Middle Way): The Mūlamadhyamakavṛtty-Akutobhayā, also generally attributed to Nāgārjuna, concludes that it is impossible both for the act to persist somehow and also for it to perish immediately and still have efficacy at a later time. Tibetan Buddhism In Tibetan Buddhism, the teachings on karma belong to the preliminary teachings, that turn the mind towards the Buddhist dharma. In the Vajrayana tradition, negative past karma may be \\"purified\\" through such practices as meditation on Vajrasattva because they both are the mind's psychological phenomenon. The performer of the action, after having purified the karma, does not experience the negative results he or she otherwise would have. Engaging in the ten negative actions out of selfishness and delusions hurts all involved. Otherwise, loving others, receives love; whereas; people with closed hearts may be prevented from happiness. One good thing about karma is that it can be purified through confession, if the thoughts become positive. Within Guru Yoga seven branch offerings practice, confession is the antidote to aversion. East Asian traditions =Zen= Dōgen Kigen argued in his Shobogenzo that karmic latencies are emphatically not empty, going so far as to claim that belief in the emptiness of karma should be characterized as \\"non-Buddhist,\\" although he also states that the \\"law of karman has no concrete existence.\\" Zen's most famous koan about karma is called Baizhang's Wild Fox (百丈野狐). The story of the koan is about an ancient Zen teacher whose answer to a question presents a wrong view about karma by saying that the person who has a foundation in cultivating the great practice \\"does not fall into cause and effect.\\" Because of his unskillful answer the teacher reaps the result of living 500 lives as a wild fox. He is then able to appear as a human and ask the same question to Zen teacher Baizhang, who answers, \\"He is not in the dark about cause and effect.\\" Hearing this answer the old teacher is freed from the life of a wild fox. The Zen perspective avoids the duality of asserting that an enlightened person is either subject to or free from the law of karma and that the key is not being ignorant about karma. =Tendai= The Japanese Tendai/Pure Land teacher Genshin taught a series of ten reflections for a dying person that emphasized reflecting on the Amida Buddha as a means to purify vast amounts of karma. =Nichiren Buddhism= Nichiren Buddhism teaches that transformation and change through faith and practice changes adverse karma—negative causes made in the past that result in negative results in the present and future—to positive causes for benefits in the future. Modern interpretations and controversies =Social conditioning= Buddhist modernists often prefer to equate karma with social conditioning, in contradistinction with, as one scholar puts it, \\"early texts [which] give us little reason to interpret 'conditioning' as the infusion into the psyche of external social norms, or of awakening as simply transcending all psychological conditioning and social roles. Karmic conditioning drifts semantically toward 'cultural conditioning' under the influence of western discourses that elevate the individual over the social, cultural, and institutional. The traditional import of the karmic conditioning process, however, is primarily ethical and soteriological—actions condition circumstances in this and future lives.\\" Essentially, this understanding limits the scope of the traditional understanding of karmic effects so that it encompasses only saṃskāras—habits, dispositions and tendencies—and not external effects, while at the same time expanding the scope to include social conditioning that does not particularly involve volitional action. =Karma theory and social justice= Some western commentators and Buddhists have taken exception to aspects of karma theory, and have proposed revisions of various kinds. These proposals fall under the rubric of Buddhist modernism. The \\"primary critique\\" of the Buddhist doctrine of karma is that some feel \\"karma may be socially and politically disempowering in its cultural effect, that without intending to do this, karma may in fact support social passivity or acquiescence in the face of oppression of various kinds.\\" Dale S. Wright, a scholar specializing in Zen Buddhism, has proposed that the doctrine be reformulated for modern people, \\"separated from elements of supernatural thinking,\\" so that karma is asserted to condition only personal qualities and dispositions rather than rebirth and external occurrences. Loy argues that the idea of accumulating merit too easily becomes \\"spiritual materialism,\\" a view echoed by other Buddhist modernists, and further that karma has been used to rationalize racism, caste, economic oppression, birth handicaps and everything else. Loy goes on to argue that the view that suffering such as that undergone by Holocaust victims could be attributed in part to the karmic ripenings of those victims is \\"fundamentalism, which blames the victims and rationalizes their horrific fate,\\" and that this is \\"something no longer to be tolerated quietly. It is time for modern Buddhists and modern Buddhism to outgrow it\\" by revising or discarding the teachings on karma. Other scholars have argued, however, that the teachings on karma do not encourage judgment and blame, given that the victims were not the same people who committed the acts, but rather were just part of the same mindstream-continuum with the past actors, and that the teachings on karma instead provide \\"a thoroughly satisfying explanation for suffering and loss\\" in which believers take comfort.

The film co-stars Vinod Khanna, Zeenat Aman, Amjad Khan, Shakti Kapoor, Aruna Irani, Amrish Puri and Kadar Khan. Qurbani was famous for its music, especially the Bollywood disco song \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" sung by Pakistani popstar Nazia Hassan and produced by Biddu, as well as the song \\"Laila O Laila\\". The film is based on the 1972 Italian action crime movie The Master Touch. It was later remade into Tamil as Viduthalai starring Rajanikanth, Vishnuvardhan and Madhavi with Sivaji Ganesan, which was a moderate success at the box office, however, over the years the film has achieved a cult following. Plot Rajesh (Feroz Khan) was a motorcycle stuntman in a circus and is now a thief, expert in breaking open treasuries. In one such robbery, he is being watched by a jolly but shrewd police inspector Amjad Khan (Amjad Khan). Sheela (Zeenat Aman) is a gorgeous disco club dancer and singer. Rajesh and Sheela are in love. Rajesh has not disclosed to Sheela that he is a thief. An evil brother-sister duo, Vikram (Shakti Kapoor) and Jwaala (Aruna Irani) seek revenge against crime boss Rakka (Amrish Puri), who cheated Jwaala and siphoned her money. Vikram meets Rajesh in jail. Inspector Amjad Khan arrests Rajesh for theft after he is seen by an officer at a traffic accident. The court sentences Rajesh to two years' imprisonment. Sheela is devastated after she realises Rajesh was a thief. Meanwhile, Amar (Vinod Khanna) is an ace crime member in Rakka's gang who revolts against Rakka. He is a widower with a daughter Tina (Natasha Chopra) studying in a boarding school. However, before quitting Rakka's gang, Amar has committed a crime, masked, and inspector Amjad Khan is investigating that case. Amar saves Sheela from a gang of rowdy bikers. They meet regularly as Sheela likes Amar's daughter Tina. Soon, Amar begins to love Sheela, who does not reciprocate because she still loves Rajesh. After a short time, Amar and Sheela get together. Rajesh completes his jail sentence. While returning, he meets Vikram who again reminds him of the deal to rob Rakka. During the conversation, Amar incidentally reaches the site and a fist fight ensues between Amar and Vikram. While fleeing, Vikram swears revenge against Amar. Thus Rajesh and Amar meet for the first time. Rajesh takes Amar to introduce to Sheela; Sheela and Amar pretend as if they do not know each other since they don't want Rajesh to unnecessarily suspect them. Later, Vikram's goons kidnap Amar's daughter and beat Amar, who is hospitalized. In return for Amar and his daughter's safety, Rajesh agrees to do Vikram's job. He nurses Amar back to normal and soon they turn thick friends. Amar promises Rajesh he will support him in this one last robbery. They plan to shift to London after the robbery with the money. They concoct a scheme whereby Amar would steal gold bars and jewellery from a safe, phone the police, let Rajesh take over, get arrested, and get a prison term for about 12 to 18 months. After his release, he will join Amar in the UK. Things don't go according to plan as Rajesh gets arrested for killing Rakka, while Amar and Sheela reach London with the money. Rajesh construes that Amar deliberately framed him so that he can get Rajesh out of the way, keep all the money (as well as Sheela) for himself. Rajesh escapes from jail and reaches London to apprehend Amar. After a brief tussle, Rajesh realizes the truth and that Amar did not frame him. Vikram and his goons reach London to take revenge against Rajesh and Amar. In the climax of the movie, Amar sacrifices his life to save Rajesh, Sheela and Tina from getting killed by Vikram.

It began filming in 1979, and was one of the most expensive Indian films at the time. Feroz Khan's expenses included for a new camera, for several scenes (including a song sequence) on a large set (representing a Pathan's den), and for an authentic silver sword. Cine Blitz suggested in 1979 that the production costs of Qurbani may exceed Abdullah, another similarly expensive production at the time. To draw shock from the audience, a scene was included with the calculated decimation of a Mercedes Benz in an underground parking lot. This was at a time when not many in India had seen a Mercedes, let alone sat in one. UK stunts were designed and arranged by James Dowdall, photographed by Eric Van Herren and produced by Nick Farnes who, with James Dowdall, wrote the UK scenario. Feroz Khan initially asked Amitabh Bachchan to play the role of Amar. Amitabh replied he would be available in 6 months, according to Feroz, but Feroz could not wait that long. So the role of Amar went to Vinod Khanna. Box office It was going to be released on 27th June,1980 and clash with Karz but the sudden demise of Sanjay Gandhi who died on 23rd June,1980, release was postponed for one week and finally it was released on 4th July,1980 with bumper opening and became the biggest Blockbuster of the year, with a gross revenue of 12 crore (net income of 6 crore) at the Indian box office in 1980. This is equivalent to US$15.26 million in 1980, or US$ million (330 crore)67.175856 INR per USD in 2016 in 2018. Music Faruk Kaiser's Golden Disc accolade for Qurbani. Biddu was the music director for the song \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\", which introduced him and Pakistani singer Nazia Hassan to Indian films. The first initial song Biddu recorded for Qurbani was a Hindi version of a Boney M. song. When Nazia Hassan and Zoheb Hassan heard it, they refused saying they didn't want to sing a copy. They insisted they wanted an original song. A reluctant Biddu asked them what they had in mind. That's when \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\" was born. The rest of the songs and the background score were set by Kalyanji–Anandji. The song \\"Laila O Laila\\" was also very popular. The album was written by Faruk Kaiser and Indeevar. The movie is known for its music and songs, including the title qawwali \\"Qurbani Qurbani\\", written by the Urdu poet, Faruk Kaiser and rendered by Anwar, Kishore Kumar and Aziz Nazan. It has a song performed by Mohammed Rafi, Kya Dekhte Ho, which was written by Indeevar. Qurbani Qurbani received a special award for 'The Most Amazing Evergreen Song' by Bollywood music producer, Kalyanji–Anandji. Feroz Khan met Biddu and Nazia Hassan at a party hosted by a close friend in England. Nazias parents insisted Feroz listen to Nazia sing. Feroz did and was highly impressed. But Feroz had his eye on International star Biddu to score a song for Qurbani. Biddu was reluctant to score music for an Indian film. It was with sincere persistence and Feroz telling Biddu to do it for his mom who lived in India. Feroz also played the Bangalore card with Biddu since both Feroz and Biddu both hailed from Bangalore. Many music directors (including the film's original music directors Kalyanji–Anandji) opposed Feroz Khan hiring Biddu to score a solo song in the film. Many tried to stop this because they viewed Biddu as an outsider. After several discussions, Feroz Khan stuck to his choice. =Track listing= =Reception= Its songs were popular and the movie sold the most number of records and tapes in 1980. The music and songs ushered in the \\"Disco Revolution\\" of the Indian subcontinent that lasted until the mid-1980s. \\"Aap Jaisa Koi\\", sung by Nazia Hassan and produced by Biddu, had a strong impact on audiences. Qurbani was 1980's best-selling soundtrack album in India, and the sixth best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the 1980s. Faruk Kaiser was awarded the Golden Disc accolade when Qurbani exceeded 500,000 units sold in India.Faruk Kaiser's Gold Platinum Award The album then went Platinum within seven months, a record for the Indian music industry at the time, selling 1million units. The song \\"Laila Ho Laila\\" was recreated in film Raees with title Laila Main Laila. Awards and nominations *Filmfare Best Female Playback Award: Nazia Hassan for the song 'Aap Jaisa Koi' *Filmfare Best Sound: P. Harikishan *Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor: Vinod Khanna *Filmfare Nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role: Amjad Khan *Filmfare Nomination for Best Music: Kalyanji-Anandji *Filmfare Nomination for Best Female Playback Singer: Kanchan for the song 'Laila O Laila' Remakes Qurbani was remade in Turkish as Çare Sende Allahım directed by Yılmaz Atadeniz in 1984, which Behçet Nacar in Feroz Khan’s role and Müslüm Gürses in Vinod Khanna’s role, and in Tamil as Viduthalai in 1986 by producer K.

The title is the fourth game in the Wipeout series, and was released in Europe and North America in September 1999. Players control extremely fast anti-gravity ships and use weapons to force other contenders out of the race. Psygnosis hired design studio The Designers Republic to create a simple colour scheme and design for in-game menus and race courses, to create what a Psygnosis staff member called \\"a believable future\\". The game is one of the few PlayStation titles to run in high-resolution mode, offering crisper graphics and visuals. Wipeout 3s soundtrack is composed of electronica tracks selected by DJ Sasha and features contributions by Orbital and The Chemical Brothers. The game was re-released in Europe as Wipeout 3: Special Edition in August 2000, which contained additional tracks and content. The game was positively received on release: critics lauded the graphics, music, and minimalist design elements. The high level of difficulty, perceived lack of new content and courses, and paucity of new game features were seen as the game's primary faults. Despite generally good press, the game was a financial disappointment. Wipeout 3 was the last title in the series to appear on the PlayStation; the next entry, Wipeout Fusion, was released exclusively for the PlayStation 2 platform in 2002. Gameplay head-up display and racing craft Wipeout 3 is a racing game that retains the same basic elements of its predecessors, and introduces players to the F7200 Anti-Gravity Race League. Set in 2116, players control futuristic anti-gravity ships owned by racing corporations and pilot them on eight circuits (plus four hidden prototype tracks). Each craft is equipped with an energy shield that absorbs damage sustained on the track; if the shield is disabled, the player's craft can be knocked out of the race. Shields are regenerated in a pit lane set apart from the main course. The less time is spent in the pit lane, the less the shield will regenerate. In addition to shields, each racing craft contains airbrakes for navigating tight corners, as well as a \\"Hyperthrust\\" option. Players can activate Hyperthrust to increase their speed, but using Hyperthrust drains energy from the shields, making the craft more vulnerable. Scattered across each raceway are weapon grids that bestow random power-ups or items. Wipeout 3 adds new weapons in addition to the five retained from previous games. Several weapons are defensive: for example, the gravity shield protects the craft from attacks and collisions for a time period. Offensive weapons are also available: crafts can use rockets, Multi-Missiles and mines to disable competitors. Players can use an autopilot to coast through difficult turns safely. The single race mode awards medals to the top three finishing hovercraft. Each contestant must reach checkpoints on the course within a certain amount of time, or be ejected from the race. Winning consecutive gold medals unlocks new tracks and crafts. Wipeout 3 features several other game modes, including challenges to complete courses in a set time. In the \\"Eliminator\\" mode, players gain points for destroying competitors and finishing laps. The \\"Tournament\\" mode has players competing on several tracks, with points being awarded for placement in each race. Players can engage in two-player racing via a split-screen option. Development In developing the next entry in the Wipeout series, developer Psygnosis retained many of the developers of the original game to preserve the distinctive racing experience of earlier games. At the same time, Psygnosis sought to make the game more accessible to new players of the fast-paced racer, and kept early courses easier for these players; the difficulty was adjusted for later courses so that experts would still experience a challenge. Wipeout 3 was the first Wipeout game to take advantage of PlayStation controllers with analogue sticks, used to offer smoother control of the player's craft. Psygnosis turned to the graphic design studio The Designers Republic to assist in development. The Designers Republic, known for its underground techno album covers, provided \\"visual candy\\" to Wipeout 3s graphics, designing the game's icons, billboards, colour schemes, and custom typefaces. The look and feel of the futuristic courses was bounded by the desire to remain believable: Wipeout 3 lead artist Nicky Westcott said that \\"[Psygnosis] tried to make it look like a believable future, instead of making the sky toxic orange with 10 moons flying around and the world gone mad. It's very low-key [and] a lot more refined.\\" A special edition of Wipeout 3 was released exclusively in Europe on 14 July 2000. Wipeout 3 Special Edition featured many minor changes to gameplay, such as different craft physics, auto-loading of saves and AI bug fixes. In addition, eight courses from previous Wipeout titles (three from Wipeout and five from Wipeout XL), plus two hidden prototype circuits previously only available in the Japanese version of Wipeout 3, were added giving a total of 22 tracks. The Special Edition also allowed for four-person multiplayer, using two televisions and two PlayStation consoles. Wipeout 3 was the last game in the series made for PlayStation. The next entry in the Wipeout series, entitled Wipeout Fusion, was released in 2002 exclusively for PlayStation 2. The game introduced new courses, crafts, and weaponry, as well as enhanced artificial intelligence. =Music= Continuing the tradition set by the first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's development cycle, instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign. Reception Overall, critical reception of Wipeout 3 was positive; the game holds an 89/100 at Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". IGN named Wipeout 3 the most accessible game of the series, and in 2007 the title was named the 92nd best game by the site. Despite generally positive reviews of the game, Wipeout 3 was not a commercial success. The fast-paced gameplay and graphics were singled out as strong features of the game. Jack Schofield of The Guardian was surprised by the level of detail, stating that the \\"graphics are better than you'd expect the [PlayStation] to deliver\\". Both GamePro and Game Revolution reviewers praised the new game features, specifically the new weapons and ability to challenge friends via splitscreen. The Designer Republic's style was consistently praised as helping to make the racing locales seem real, though David Goldfarb of the magazine International Design stated that the \\"techno-meets-Nihonpop-art visuals\\" had been executed better in previous entries of the series. Wipeout 3s soundtrack and sound effects were also lauded. A major fault reviewers found with Wipeout 3 was the steep learning curve of the game. David Canter of The San Diego Union-Tribune described the difficulty progression as \\"ludicrous\\", with the tournament game mode going from \\"easy as pie to tough as nails\\". Though the use of the analogue stick was positively noted as helping to increase control over the onscreen craft, GamePro found that proper handling required large amounts of patience and practice. Reviewers who gave Wipeout 3 lower marks noted a sense of disappointment that the series broke little new ground. Stuart Miles of The Times admitted Wipeout 3 was a good game, but felt that he had been expecting much more from the sequel: \\"It's as if the programmers have concerned themselves more with the overall look and feel, rather than further developing the existing gameplay.\\" Alistair Wallace of Gamasutra, in a retrospective on Wipeout 2097, remembered that \\"I enjoyed [Wipeout 3] because it was more of the same and I loved it, but I think the series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really.\\" GameSpot summed up its review of the game by judging Wipeout 3 an excellent racer, but not able to beat Wipeout 2097 as the best futuristic racing game of all time. Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"It's not terrible, but for a series known for its 'gee whiz' level of quality, this is a serious misstep.\\" References =External links= 1999 video games PlayStation (console) games Video games developed in the United Kingdom Video games set in the 22nd century PlayStation (console)-only games Split-screen multiplayer games Wipeout (series) ","title":"Wipeout 3"},{"id":"5008295","text":"Fenneng seen from the south Fennange (, ) is a small town in the commune of Bettembourg, in southern Luxembourg. , the town has a population of 282.

One portion was incorporated as the village of Brown Deer in 1955; the remainder consolidated with the City of Milwaukee in 1956, and became a neighborhood of Milwaukee. History The first settlers came to the area in 1835, including some from Granville, New York, who gave the area its name. On January 13, 1840, the Town of Granville was created by the territorial legislature, encompassing a western portion of the Town of Milwaukee. As of the 1840 census, the population of the Town of Granville was 225.Watrous, Jerome Anthony.

They dedicated a church building, the German Evangelical Lutheran and Reformed Church of Granville Township, on June 17, 1849. (The church is currently known as Salem Evangelical Lutheran Church.) On May 26, 1850 the current pastor, Wilhelm Wrede, hosted a meeting of local Lutheran ministers at the church: this group later became the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. The area around Good Hope Road and 43rd Street was known as East Granville, and was home to the East Granville Cemetery which was started in the 1840s.

It is the first game in the Wipeout series. It was originally released in 1995 for PlayStation and MS-DOS, and later in 1996 for Sega Saturn, being a launch title for the PlayStation (in Europe only). It was re-released as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network in 2007. Set in 2052, players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league, piloting one of a selection of craft in races on several tracks around the world. Unique at the time, Wipeout was noted for its futuristic setting, weapons designed to both stall and destroy enemy opponents and its marketing campaign designed by Keith Hopwood and The Designers Republic. The game features original music from CoLD SToRAGE, with tracks by Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers and Orbital appearing on some versions. The game was critically acclaimed on release; critics praised the game for its originality and its vast \\"unique techno soundtrack\\". However, it received minor criticism for the steep learning curve resulting from the realistic physics. Wipeout spawned several sequels to critical acclaim.  Gameplay  From left to right clockwise, the interface displays the number of laps, current weapon, race position, speedometer, and lap time. Wipeout is a racing game that is set in 2052, where players compete in the F3600 anti- gravity racing league. The game allows the player to pilot one of a selection of craft in races on several different tracks. There are four racing teams to choose from, and two ships for each team. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, mass, and turning radius. By piloting their craft over power-up pads found on the tracks, the player can pick up various weapons and power-ups such as shields, turbo boosts, mines, shock waves, rockets, or missiles. The power-ups allow the player to either protect their craft or disrupt the competitors' craft. There are seven race tracks in the game, six of them located in futuristic versions of countries such as Canada, the United States and Japan. After all tracks have been completed on the Rapier Championship, a hidden track (Firestar), set on Mars is unlocked. Wipeout features a multiplayer mode using the PlayStation Link Cable, allowing two player to race against each other and the six remaining AI competitors. The game also supports the NeGcon, a third-party controller designed by Namco.  Development and release  The controversial WipEout poster featuring television presenter and DJ Sara Cox, leftmost in the poster. Wipeout was developed and published by Liverpudlian developer Psygnosis (later known as SCE Studio Liverpool), with production starting in the second half of 1994. According to Lee Carus, one of the artists, Wipeout took 14 months to develop, and the concept began as a conversation between Nick Burcombe and Jim Bowers at a pub in Oxton, Merseyside. Bowers then started on a concept film which was shown around Psygnosis' offices. It proved popular, and Wipeout was approved and production began. The marketing and artwork were designed by Keith Hopwood and The Designers Republic in Sheffield. Aimed at a fashionable, club-going, music-buying audience, Keith Hopwood and The Designers Republic created art for the packaging, in-game branding, and other promotional materials. A non-playable CGI film mock-up inspired by the game appeared in the teen cult film Hackers (1995), in which both protagonists were playing the game in a nightclub. The team was under pressure, as it consisted of around ten people, and they were on a tight schedule. Carus stated that the code had to be rewritten three quarters of the way through development, and that the team was confident that they could complete the game on time. The vehicle designs were based on Matrix Marauders, a 3D grid-based strategy game whose concept was developed by Bowers and released for the Amiga in 1994. Burcombe, the game's future designer, was inspired to create a racing game using the same types of 'anti-gravity' vehicles from SoftImage's animation of two ships racing. The name \\"Wipeout\\" was given to the game during a pub conversation, and was inspired by the instrumental song Wipe Out by The Surfaris. Designing the tracks proved to be difficult due to the lack of draw distance possible on the system. Players received completely random weapons, resembling Super Mario Kart in their capability to stall rather than destroy opponents. Burcombe said that Wipeout was influenced by Super Mario Kart more than any other game. Wipeout gained a significant amount of controversy on its initial release. A marketing campaign created and launched by Keith Hopwood and The Designers Republic included an infamous promotional poster, featuring a bloodstained television and radio presenter Sara Cox, which was accused by some of depicting a drug overdose. Next Generation printed the ad with the blood erased; the magazine staff explained that not only had they been under pressure from newsstand retailers about violent imagery in games magazines, but they themselves felt the blood added nothing to the ad other than shock value. The poster branded Wipeout \\"a dangerous game\\", with Wipeouts lead artist Neil Thompson suggesting--and designer Nick Burcome denying--that the \\"E\\" in Wipeout stood for ecstasy. Wipeout was first released alongside the PlayStation in Europe in September 1995. It was the PlayStation's best-selling launch title in Europe. In November 1995, it was released in the United States. The game went to number one in all the format charts, with over 1.5 million units of the franchise having been sold to date throughout Europe and North America. Wipeout was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1996. Because the company behind the PlayStation, Sony, owned the applicable rights to the last three tracks of the PlayStation version's soundtrack, new music was added for the Saturn version by Rob Lord and Mark Bandola. The Sega Saturn version was released by SoftBank in North America. It was one of four titles they planned to release on the Sega Saturn in the US, along with Destruction Derby, Krazy Ivan, and Assault Rigs, however only Wipeout was released. = Music = The game's electronica soundtrack was mostly composed by Welsh video game music composer Tim Wright under the alias CoLD SToRAGE. However, additional music tracks were licensed from more established electronica acts to create the soundtracks for the PAL and Saturn versions of the game, as well as the promotional album, Wipeout: The Music. Additional music featured in the PAL version of the PlayStation game include tracks from Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, and Orbital (also appearing on Wipeout: The Music), while the Saturn version includes three additional tracks by Rob Lord and Mark Bandola. Orbital's \\"Wipeout (P.E.T.R.O.L.)\\" was at least partially written before Burcombe met the musicians, and Leftfield's \\"Afro Ride\\" and The Chemical brothers' \\"Chemical Beats\\" are remixes of songs the artists had already recorded. The 1995 North American release, as well as the 1997 \\"Greatest Hits\\" reissue, only feature tracks by CoLD SToRAGE. The promotional album Wipeout: The Music was released on CD and vinyl in 1996, and features the aforementioned three tracks by Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, as well as additional tracks by New Order and The Prodigy. Burcombe explained that the choice of genres was based on an experience he had while playing Super Mario Kart: he had just finished in first place but had \\"Age of Love\\" playing instead of the game's soundtrack, and thought it fitted the moment. Persuading record companies to get involved with the promotional album proved difficult as they did not understand what the development team wanted. Notable, however, is the omission of tracks by CoLD SToRAGE. This surprised some, as Wright's contributions were popular with players, and the omission of his songs in favor of more established acts seemed to affront video game music as a burgeoning art form.  Reception  Upon release, the game was critically acclaimed. IGN staff praised the game for its originality and unique techno soundtrack, but criticised the difficulty with manoeuvring the vehicles and also the difficulty of the game itself, stating that \\"there aren't nearly enough competitors\\" and that the player would have \\"[pulled] ahead of the other racers with no problem\\". Edge cited that it was hard to criticise \\"such a beautifully realised and well-produced game which [exploited] the PlayStation's power so well\\", but did show similar concerns over the game's longevity regarding its \\"reliance on track-based power-ups\\" that would \\"limit Wipeout's lifespan\\" in comparison to Super Mario Kart. GamePro gave the PlayStation version a rave review, predicting that \\"Wipeout's taut action and grueling courses will lure many diehard racing fans to this new system.\\" They particularly praised the challenging gameplay and precise controls. They said the fact that multiplayer is only through the PlayStation Link Cable is the game's one major flaw, since the PlayStation still had a low installed base at this point and thus this would not be an option for most players. A reviewer for Next Generation applauded the stylish and detailed visuals, the \\"heart-pounding soundtrack\\", and particularly the exhilarating feel of the racing. He commented that the controls have a potentially frustrating learning curve but are worth mastering, and deemed the game \\"A new high-water mark\\". Maximum opined that of all the games in the PlayStation's European launch lineup, \\"not one title can match up to the awesome nature of Psygnosis' WipeOut. It's an amazing spectacle to behold, it sounds absolutely fantastic and it's the best playing racing game yet beheld on a next generation super console.\\" Making particular note of the lack of pop-up, the coherent style and concept, the soundtrack, the unlockable Rapier mode, and the PAL optimization, they gave it their \\"Maximum Game of the Month\\" award. The later Saturn version also received generally positive reviews, though most critics agreed that it was not as good as the PlayStation version. In Sega Saturn Magazine, Rad Automatic praised the large number of tracks and the distinctive flavour of each one, and remarked that the gameplay is very easy to get into but provides more than enough challenge. He criticised it as not being as good as the PlayStation version, though he noted that none of the shortcomings impact the gameplay. The four reviewers from Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly praised the number and variety of tracks along with the strong challenge the game presented, and were much more approving of the graphics than Sega Saturn Magazine, describing them as \\"vibrant\\" and \\"gorgeous\\". A Next Generation critic said that while the graphics are slightly less sharp and the controls feel different, the Saturn version is essentially the same game as the PlayStation version. Both Air Hendrix of GamePro and a reviewer for Maximum argued that the Saturn version is noticeably not as polished as the PlayStation version but still excellent in absolute terms, making it a pointless purchase for PlayStation owners but recommended for Saturn-only players. = Legacy = The game's initial success led to Psygnosis developing several sequels which would later become part of the Wipeout franchise. A direct sequel, Wipeout 2097, was released for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996, which was met with positive reviews, especially aimed towards the vastly improved game engine and new physics the game offered. A Nintendo 64 spin-off, Wipeout 64, was released in 1998 and was met with considerable praise from critics, but was noted to be too similar to the original Wipeout. After the release of Wipeout in 1995, the awareness of the underground techno community in England was significantly boosted, with critics praising the vast \\"unique techno soundtrack\\" the game offered. Wipeout has been described as being synonymous with Sony's debut gaming hardware and as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. It has since been re- released as a downloadable game for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable via the PlayStation Network in 2007. The game's soundtrack, especially its use of tracks by popular contemporary artists, has been credited with prompting gaming developers to allot greater importance to the music in their games.

Biography He was born into a noble family of landowners. His parents died when he was four; as a child he was moved from one relative to another. He had his schooling in Baja, Szabadka (today Subotica), Pest and Pécs. Mészáros dropped out of his studies of law and joined the military. =Military career= In 1813, he became Lieutenant in a cavalry regiment in Bács-Bodrog County. He took part in the war against Napoleon. He was an officer of the 7th regiment of hussars from 1816 to 1837; then he was put in charge of the 5th regiment of hussars. He spent 18 years in Italy with his regiment. Field marshal Radetzky discovered the talented hussar officer, and, based on Radetzky's suggestion, he was promoted to be a colonel (1845). He also became his regiment's commandant. Lázár Mészáros was a highly cultivated officer. He spoke seven languages. He was well versed in military matters, but he was also knowledgeable about society and the economy. In 1837, he started to correspond by mail with István Széchenyi. Mészáros was elected to be a mailing member of the Magyar Tudós Társaság (English: Hungarian Erudite Association, today: Hungarian Academy of Sciences). He chose the theme \\"Armed forces in modern bourgeois societies\\" for his inaugural. =Minister of War= On Lajos Kossuth's suggestion Lajos Batthyány appointed Mészáros to be Minister of War in the first responsible Hungarian government (22 March 1848). He took up his office after returning from Italy, where his regiment was posted (23 May). Some time later he became Major general of the Imperial and Royal forces and the commander of Imperial troops stationed on Hungarian territory. As Minister of War, Lázár Mészáros was the intellectual founder of Hungary's defensive army. In July 1848, he became parliamentary delegate of his hometown, Baja, as well. From the end of August, Mészáros decided to take personal control of the southern army. He travelled to Vajdaság (today Vojvodina, Serbia). On 30 September, he returned to the capital. Mészáros was the only member of Batthyány's government who did not resign. He became the member of the Territorial Defence Committee as the Minister of War. On 13 December, he took command of the northern army with 10,000 men. On 19 January 1849, he was discharged from his command, but he retained his post as Minister until the declaration of the Independence Statement. On 26 July, Mészáros resigned from all his remaining military functions, because he did not agree with the way Mór Perczel commanded the parts of the army under his control. After the Battle of Temesvár, and the ensuing failure of the war of independence, he left Hungary on 14 August 1849 for Turkey. =Exile= He left Turkey in May 1851. He settled at first in France, which he left upon Napoleon III's coup d'état in December 1851. He went to the Isle of Jersey. In the summer of 1853, he moved to the United States, where he tried farming in Iowa, and eventually settled in Flushing, New York. In October 1858, a short time before his death, Mészáros returned to England. =Last will= In his will, he requested that his remains not be returned to Hungary \\"until the last foreign soldier has left\\". He was reburied in Baja 133 years after his death, on 15 March 1991. The last Soviet soldiers – always seen by Hungarians as the successors of the Imperial Russian Army that crushed the Revolution 1848 – had left Hungary just months before.

Lasauvage was known as one of the few French-speaking towns in an otherwise Luxembourgish-speaking country. Unlike many German alternatives to place names in Luxembourg, Lasauvage's German equivalent, Rohrbach, has been little-used because of its perceived Nazi associations. Shortly before the Second World War, there were plans drawn up by the Luxembourg government for Grand Duchess Charlotte to reside in Lasauvage, given its proximity to France, which would enable her to escape over the border easily, but they did not come to fruition. Population As of March 31, 2020, the town has a population of 449. Name The place name goes back to a legend of a wild woman, who is supposed to have only eaten raw meat and who lived under a rocky promontory, where she was buried by a landslide. It is assumed that the valley was not inhabited before the 17th century. In early chronicles, it is referred to as Val de la sauvage femme (French for \\"Valley of the wild woman\\"). History Around the year 1623 in the Valley of the Wild Woman, a water-powered hammerworks with blast furnace was erected, where the primary school is now, owned by the Longwy citizen, Gabriel Bernard. The small works had a turbulent history. Count Fernand de Saintignon, who financed the construction of many houses and public buildings in Lasauvage As early as the 16th century, a smithy with water-powered hammerworks existed in Lasauvage at the river \\"La Croisière\\". The highly ferrous surface ore was collected from fields. It was melted down using charcoal, taken from the surrounding forest. The works had a turbulent history and belonged, amongst others, to the families dHuart and Giraud. By marriage, in the late 19th century Count Fernand de Saintignon took over the reins of the \\"Société des Hauts-Fourneaux de Longwy et de La Sauvage -- F de Saintignon et Cie\\". With him, the high point as well as the beginning of the decline of the Lasauvage works start. At this point, it had a population of 1,000. There were also times in which Lasauvage was booming. An example of this would be the residential house, which belonged to the furnaces and was expanded into a stately home by Count de Saintignon. In the course of the years, two further blast furnaces were added. The Lasauvage metalworks was the first one the country to process Minette (low-quality iron ore from the South of Luxembourg), in addition to the more usual surface iron ore. Around 1877, the works had to close. The pressure from the competition had grown too great, and Lasauvage was in an isolated area. Later plans to segue from iron ore processing into mining coal, were not met with success. Exporatory drilling discovered water instead of coal. The Count of Saintignon therefore had the idea to turn Lasauvage into a spa area. This also was fruitless. In 1880, de Saintignon started building accommodation for his workers. Around 70 workers' houses were built on the Rue Principale, the Place de Saintignon, the Rue de Rodange, and the Rue de la Crosnière. These houses were built in a uniform style, with three rooms and a kitchen. They were built in the style of the nearby Lotharingian workers' houses, which were called corons. De Saintignon also constructed a school on the place of former blast furnaces, and a church, inspired by the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. In the Economat (opposite the school), the workers could buy groceries, and have their bill (like their rent payments) deducted from their wages. Saintignon also built a church and a vicarage, which was given to the commune of Differdange after his death by his heirs. The school, on the other hand, was sold to the commune. During World War I, mining of the Minette ore was stopped by Saintignon, as he refused to deliver ore to the Germans, who were in control of the furnaces of Differdange. After the war and the death of the impoverished Saintignon, the metalworks of Rodange bought the houses and continued to mine Minette, until in 1978 the last mine was closed. House No. 55 As Lasauvage was the only Luxembourgish village in range of the guns of the Maginot Line, the Grand- Ducal family had had a casemate build under House number 55 from 1939-1940. Grand Duchess Charlotte was to live here in case of a German invasion, and continue to rule the country from here, like Albert I, who during World War I had withdrawn to behind the Isère. But, when the German invasion did come on 10 May 1940, events moved so quickly that the Grand Duchess only barely had time to escape to France, and House No. 55 in Lasauvage was never used. Until 1905, as Lasauvage had no graveyard, its inhabitangs were buried at Saulnes (Lux.: Zounen), its French neighbouring village. In 1907 the Count of Saintignon built a cemetery, but on the French side of the border: his mostly French employees and workers were to be buried in France. The cross-border burials, however, led to some administrative problems. Until 1980, a French customs officer had to be present at burials. Mining museum The Eugène Pesch Museum, a collection which specializes in local history and mining, is located in the village.

The Pine Barrens Speculation is often conflated with the Yazoo land scandal, which occurred at about the same time.

Located at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts, they work on AWACS, Joint STARS, MP- RTIP, Mission Planning, and weather systems. Now responsible for the development and sustainment of command and control systems, the 551st ELSW takes its designation from a wing that laid the foundation for modern-day airborne surveillance. History =Cold War period= The 551st Airborne Early Warning and Control Wing, established and activated in 1954, was charged with tracking air and sea activity along the United States eastern seaboard. The wing received its first airborne asset on March 2, 1955, when an RC-121D landed at Otis Air Force Base. The plane was the first of many assigned to the 551st to patrol the skies over much of the Atlantic Ocean. The RC-121D was eventually upgraded to the EC-121H Warning Star in 1963. The newer model supplanted the slower voice and manual Teletype data relay system previously employed by the RC-121D and instead provided instantaneous automated relay of air defense surveillance and early-warning information by data-link directly to ground-based communication facilities. The 551 AEWC Wing provided critical surveillance data to Air Defense Command and Control computers and the North American Air Defense Combat Operations Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., for air defense evaluation and action. The data also enabled more versatile airborne control of interceptor missile and aircraft weapons systems. During the Cold War period, the 551st provided surveillance support for major world events, including tracking over Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis and tracking Russian aircraft and naval vessels off Iceland and the East Coast of the United States. The wing also provided surveillance over Johnston and Christmas islands during nuclear testing by the Atomic Energy Commission and performed a variety of surveillance services in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. In its first 10 years, the wing flew continuous missions over the Atlantic Ocean 24 hours a day, seven days a week, compiling more than 350,000 flying hours. Among other honors awarded to the wing was the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for its significant performance. Between 1965 and 1967, three aircraft of the wing crashed into the Atlantic killing fifty members of the wing. The tail numbers of the aircraft were 55-0136, 55-5262, and 53-0549. The wing was inactivated December 31, 1969.

It was last active in 2010 as an electronic systems support unit located at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts. The wing developed, acquired, fielded, and sustained systems for C2, ISR and communication capabilities for Air Force, joint and coalition operations. It serviced five major commands, three U.S. services, seven combatant commanders, three national agencies, NORAD and NATO. The 350th ELSW executed $14 billion in programs. Units The 350th ELSW consisted of three groups: * 350th Electronic Systems Group : Acquired, fielded, modernized, integrated, standardized and sustained unit- and theatre- level C2 warfighting capabilities to the Combined Joint Forces Air Component Commander and foreign military customers. Primarily located at Hanscom AFB, Mass., a contingent of the group is also located at Langley AFB, Va. The group administers a contract budget valued at $4.1 billion per fiscal year defense plan. * 850th Electronic Systems Group : Based at Peterson AFB, Colorado, the group acquired, fielded, and sustained global sensing, communication and decision-making capabilities, including missile warning and defense sensors, global command and control systems, space control sensors and battle management systems. The squadron also had operating locations at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, Scott AFB, Illinois, and Dahlgren, Virginia. The group administered a contract budget valued at $6.4 billion fiscal year defense plan. * 950th Electronic Systems Group : The group developed, acquired, and integrated Information Surveillance and Reconnaissance systems to provide kill chain and information operations capabilities for the Air Force, joint and coalition combat operations. The group led integration and transition and fielding of highly-classified technologies to meet warfighter requirements and administered a contract budget valued at $5.4 billion fiscal year defense plan. History The 350th ELSW, formerly the Command and Control, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Systems Wing, traces its history back to the early establishment of information superiority in the United States Army Air Forces. The newly defined role of the aircraft for reconnaissance purposes resulted in the birth of multiple observation groups in the USAAF. The 26th Observation Group, the direct predecessor of the 350 ELSW, was activated 1 September 1941, and assigned to the First Air Force. The group, stationed at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, flew various types of missions, including photographic, reconnaissance, tow target, and coast artillery spotting. This was done in cooperation with units along the Eastern seaboard. The group was later redesignated the 26th Reconnaissance Group, and took part in the Carolina and Tennessee Maneuvers in the fall of 1941 and 1942 in support of Army field training exercises. In both exercises, observation aircraft were used to detail strategic ground positioning and provide an opportunity to train senior commanders and staff in the operational elements of combat. With Pearl Harbor deeply entrenched in the minds of military leaders, it was clear there was a greater need for coastal surveillance and anti-submarine patrols. The 26th Reconnaissance Group, stationed out of Reading Army Air Field, Pennsylvania, was given that responsibility for the northeastern North American sector of the Atlantic Ocean. Various aircraft, including the O-46 and O-52 Owl, flew anti-submarine patrols off the East Coast after the United States entered World War II. Other more notable aircraft that flew reconnaissance missions with modifications to their existing frames included the P-39 and B-25, which was designated as the F-10 after being modified for photographic reconnaissance work. The group was disbanded at the end of 1943 The 26th Reconnaissance Group was reestablished as an Air Force Reserve organization in 1947 near Buffalo. New York and was inactivated on 27 June 1949, when Continental Air Command implemented the wing base organization (Hobson Plan) for its reserve organizations. It was redesignated the 350th Tactical Electronics Group in 1985, but remained in inactive status. The group was redesignated as the 350th Electronics Systems Wing, delivering and sustaining transformational capabilities for operational- level command, control, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information dominance. The 350th Electronics Systems Group, formerly the Operational Command and Control Systems Group, acquired and sustained operational-level command and control assets including the Air and Space Operations Center and Theater Battle Management Core Systems. The 850th Electronic Systems Group, formerly the Combatant Commanders Command and Control Systems Group, acquired, fielded and sustained global sensing, communication and decision-making capabilities, including missile warning and defense sensors, global command and control systems, space control sensors and battle management systems. The 950th Electronic Systems Group, formerly the Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group developed, acquired, and integrated network-centric intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance information and decision-support systems to fuse data at multiple security levels for Air Force, joint and coalition warfighters. The 950th ELSG was recognized with the AF Outstanding Unit Award for the period of 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2008.

Eventually, its source and creator are forgotten (\\"obliterated\\") as the concept enters common knowledge (is \\"incorporated\\"). Obliteration occurs when \\"the sources of an idea, finding or concept, become obliterated by incorporation in canonical knowledge, so that only a few are still aware of their parentage\\".Robert K. Merton, quoted by Sztompka, 2003  Concept  The concept was introduced by Robert K. Merton in 1949, although some incorrectly attribute it to Eugene Garfield, whose work contributed to the popularization of Merton's theory. Merton introduced the concept of \\"obliteration by incorporation\\" in his landmark work, Social Theory and Social Structure in 1949 (although the revised edition of 1968 is usually cited (pp. 27–28, 35–37 in the enlarged edition)). Merton also introduced the less known counterpart to this concept, adumbrationism, meaning the attribution of insights, ideas or analogies absent from original works.Piotr Sztompka, Society in Action: The Theory of Social Becoming, University of Chicago Press, 1991, Google Print, p.7 In the process of \\"obliteration by incorporation\\", both the original idea and the literal formulations of it are forgotten due to prolonged and widespread use, and enter into everyday language (or at least the everyday language of a given academic discipline), no longer being attributed to their creator. Also available as: Extract. Google Print, p.19, p.27-28 Thus they become similar to common knowledge. Merton notes that this process is much more common in highly codified fields of natural sciences than in social sciences.David J. Hess, Science Studies: An Advanced Introduction, NYU Press, 1997, , Google Print, p.77 It can also lead to ignoring or hiding the early sources of recent ideas under the claims of novelty and originality. Allan Chapman notes that 'obliteration by incorporation' often affects famous individuals, to whom attribution becomes considered as obvious and unnecessary, thus leading to their exclusion from citations, even if they and their ideas have been mentioned in the text.Ellen G. Cohn, Richard A. Wright, David P. Farrington, Evaluating Criminology and Criminal Justice, Greenwood Press, 1998, Google Print, p.8 Marianne Ferber and Eugene Garfield concur with Chapman, noting that obliteration often occurs when the citation count and reputation of an affected scientist have already reached levels much higher than average. The obliteration phenomenon is a concept in library and information science, referring to the tendency for truly ground-breaking research papers to fail to be cited after the ideas they put forward are fully accepted into the orthodox world view. For example, Albert Einstein's paper on the theory of relativity is rarely cited in modern research papers on physical cosmology, despite its direct relevance.  Examples  Many terms and phrases were so evocative that they quickly suffered the fate of 'obliteration by incorporation'. Examples include: * double helix structure of DNA, introduced by James D. Watson and Francis Crick * periodic table of elements, introduced by Dmitri Mendeleev * self-fulfilling prophecy, introduced by Robert K. Merton * role model, introduced by Robert K. Merton  See also  * Citation analysis * Genericized trademark * Law of eponymy: Chicago historian of statistics Stephen M.

It was taken over in the 1950s by famed corporate raider, Louis E. Wolfson. It ceased operation in the late 1960s or early 1970s. Early history The 1850s and 1860s were a dangerous time for mariners and marine operations around the American continent. The transition from sail to steam with the consequent unreliability of equipment, and the growing needs of commerce to fuel US expansion meant that a large number of ships operated. Some foundered or got into trouble on their own, and some were lured to their doom by wreckers. Salvage operations were in their infancy, and commercial diving was almost unheard of. It was with this background that a number of companies started operating under law of the sea salvage rules rather than as wreckers. Israel Merritt founded Merritt Salvage in or before 1860 to operate in this nascent industry. The company continued to grow and expand the scope of operations, merging with other firms, and adopting the famous \\"black horse\\" house flag, a black horse in full gallop on a white flag. Iris Vinton, a noted author of young adult novels, wrote \\"Flying Ebony\\", a story about the origins of the Life Saving Benevolent Association of New York and the story behind the black horse shown on the corporate flag. \\"The memory of the black horse of this book is preserved as a symbol to this day on the house flag of Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation, the great ship salvage firm.\\"Vinton, Iris, and Marc Simont. Flying Ebony. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1956. Page vii. In addition to salvage operations, the company got involved in marine construction, acquiring a number of boats, and steam derricks.From the Mystic Seaport records: The following vessels are associated in this library's records. Not all are necessarily owned by MC&S; or predecessors, further research would be needed: *CHILEAN (Steamer) *CITY OF NEW YORK (Steamer) *FRANCISCA (Steamer) *GODREVY (Steamer) *HAROLD (Steamer) *HENRY A. LITCHFIELD (Bark) *JONES (Tug) *LORNTY (Steamer) *M. D. S. (Schooner) *MERRITT (Tug) *NANKIN (Steamer) *POLARIA (Steamship) *RESCUE (Steamer) *SAN JACINTO (Steamer) *TALLAPOOSA (U.S.S.) By the late 19th century, the firm had some experience in maritime investigation, with the ability to determine causes for wrecks and explosions. When, in 1898, the USS Maine exploded in the harbour of Havana, Cuba, the U.S. War department engaged Merritt-Chapman to determine whether the unknown explosion came from inside the hull or outside. Investigators decided that it was external, and attributed it to blast powder. This incident became the precipitate cause of the Spanish–American War. Salvage Tug Relief prior to 1918 sale to US Navy (note black horse \\"house flag\\" on stack) In 1909, the RMS Republic was struck by the SS Florida, and sank in 40 fathoms of open ocean off Nantucket, Massachusetts the next day after unsuccessful towing attempts by the MC&S; Relief and other tugs, taking a rumoured 3 million in gold currency with her. Merritt-Chapman were engaged to evaluate salvage operations and whether it would be possible to raise her, or to carry out a diving salvage. It was their conclusion that operations were not possible, and the New York papers all reported the view as definitive, demonstrating that MC&S; already had considerable reputation for expertise in maritime salvage. Expansion into construction It is not clear from the sources consulted so far what sorts of activities MC&S; were involved in during the 1910s although some ships were sold to the Navy just prior to US entry into World War I in 1917, including the Relief and subsequently purchased back after the war's end. In the 1920s, it is known they continued to be involved in diving operations and they had a reputation of \\"skilled artisans with an average individual experience probably not to be found in any other group\\". The 1930s By the 1930s MS&C;'s broadening of scope was clear. They continued to acquire companies and were involved in a large number of construction projects during this decade that utilised their underwater, pile driving, concrete setting, foundation construction, and diving expertise. These projects included the Waldo-Hancock Bridge, 1931, Bucksport, Maine, the Marquette Ore Docks, 1931, Marquette, Michigan, and the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway Hunting Creek Bridge, 1932, Alexandria, Virginia. and even sinking an elderly destroyer (USS Moody) for the 1933 MGM film Hell Below. =Ore dock project in Marquette= Marquette Ore Dock, 1931 Marquette had been an ore transshipment (from rail to ship for a journey down Lake Superior and the rest of the Great Lakes to either Chicago, Detroit or Cleveland where the mills were) point since the 1850s, with a succession of more elaborate ore storage and transfer facilities being constructed. The Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway (DSS&A;) commissioned the construction of a large and modern facility in 1931. The construction process began with the awarding of contracts. The first one was awarded in March 1931 when the Lake Shore Engine Works of Marquette was contracted to construct 150 hoists for raising and lowering the dock chutes. The second contract was let out on April 1, to the Merritt-Chapman & Whitney Corporation of Duluth. This company was the successor to Whitney Bros. which specialized in the building of docks, bridges, heavy construction work of all kinds as well as river and harbor improvements. They would bring their experience to this project. The fabricated steel for the dock including the large steel ore chutes would be furnished by McClintick, Marshall Corporation of Chicago. Jernstad Electric of Ishpeming would install the electrical work and the Worden—Allen Company of Chicago was given the contract for furnishing all of the reinforced steel for the dock and its approach. =Sinking of the Moody= The USS Moody, a World War I vintage destroyer, obsolete, and over the London Naval Treaty limits for naval vessels, was headed for the breaking yard when MGM purchased her for approximately US $35,000 to film Hell Below, a movie based on Commander Edward Ellsberg's novel Pigboats, which starred Robert Montgomery and Jimmy Durante. Corporate ad, 1938 The Moody was towed from Mare Island to a nearby shipyard and reworked to resemble a German destroyer. To simulate her sinking by \\"torpedoes\\" by the American submarine, AL-14 (played by sub S-31), Merritt- Chapman & Scott Corporation were hired. A charge of dynamite was placed on board just aft of the bridge. Shortly after noon on February 21, 1933, the Moody was blown in two. The explosion was placed between two water tight compartments so she would continue to float after the explosion. Two other explosions took out the water tight bulkheads and the Moody finally sank at 5:30 PM. Several boats, many with newsmen aboard hoping to film the sinking destroyer, hovered around the film crew interfering with operations. Threats were exchanged, but the filming was done. The 1940s As during World War I there was a fair bit of transference of MC&S; assets to the Navy, and back again, as a result of World War II. One of the most famous salvage operations ever carried out by MC&S; was the salvage of the Normandie, a French liner, the largest in the world when built, which was seized by the US after the fall of France. By 1941 the United States Navy decided to convert the Normandie into a troopship, the aptly named USS Lafayette. The ship was moored at Manhattan's Pier 88 for the conversion. On February 9, 1942, sparks from a welding torch ignited a stack of thousands of lifevests filled with kapok, a highly flammable material, that had been stored in the first class dining room. The woodwork had not yet been removed, and the fire spread rapidly. The ship had a very efficient fire protection system, but it had been disconnected during the conversion. All on board fled the ship. As firefighters on shore and in fireboats poured water on the blaze, the ship developed a dangerous list to port. About 2:45 a.m. on February 10, the Normandie capsized, crushing a fireboat. A shot of the capsized ship makes a brief cameo appearance towards the end of Alfred Hitchcock's film Saboteur. The ship was righted in 1943 by Merritt-Scott & Chapman in the world's most expensive salvage operation, but it was subsequently determined that the cost of restoring the liner was too great. After neither the US Navy nor the French Line offered to restore the liner, the ship's designer, Vladimir Yourkevitch, made a last-ditch proposal to cut the ship down and restore her as a mid-sized passenger liner. This, too, failed to draw backing, and the former Normandie was sold to Lipsett Inc. and scrapped in 1947. Another notable project was construction in 1942 of the Escanaba Ore Docks, Escanaba, Michigan, which were built as a backup in case the Marquette docks were sabotaged or bombed. *Hospital Universitario UCV 1943 Caracas, Venezuela. The 1950s MC&S; acquired the New York Shipbuilding company at some point during the 1950s or 1960s (a 1949 book gives no mention of MS&C; ownership. Further research is needed to clarify this part of the history. MC&S; itself was to be taken over in 1951 by Louis E. Wolfson a renowned corporate raider of the time. The takeover was not without its problems, there were a number of stockholder suits, and eventually, further difficulties. But Merritt-Chapman & Scott was involved in a large number of projects during this decade, including the following: *Washburn Tunnel, 1950, *Delaware Memorial Bridge 1951 *John Greenleaf Whittier Bridge 1951 *Auckland Harbour Board Freyberg and import wharf (joint venture with Fletcher Construction & Raymond Concrete Pile) 1951 Auckland *Tasman Mill 1953 New Zealand *Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge 1957 Kingston, New York *Walt Whitman Bridge 1957 =Mackinac Bridge= One of the most important projects of the decade was the foundation contract for David B. Steinman's Mackinac Bridge commenced 1954 and completed in 1957, across the Straits of Mackinac. This bridge (including approaches) was the world's longest anchorage-to-anchorage single-suspended span at the time. and Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corporation's $25,735,600 (equivalent to $ in ) contract to build all the foundations led to the mobilization of the largest bridge construction fleet ever assembled to the time. The American Bridge Division of United States Steel Corporation had a $44,532,900 (equivalent to $ in ) contract to build this superstructure, with steel supplied by U.S. Steel's mills and delivered via their Pittsburgh Steamship Division's fleet. The 1960s Since the takeover, Wolfson had been stung with a dozen suits by angry investors, and in 1966 was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of fraudulent dealings in Merritt-Chapman stock. Such stock manipulations, if they occurred, are only one of Merritt- Chapman's misfortunes under Wolfson. Another is that he tried to build up and broaden the company too fast. Acquisitions such as the unprofitable New York Shipbuilding Corp cut into profits and dividends; in 1966, there was a loss of $740,000 and no dividend at all. To halt the drain, Wolfson sold off a paint company, a small steel mill, the company's derrick division and a small shipyard, but the future was not assured. Along with its losses on operations, Merritt-Chapman also added a $3,233,000 \\"special charge\\" to the books in 1967 as a provision against losses if other properties had to be sold. However, the company did carry out significant projects in this, the last full decade of its life. These included: *Throgs Neck Bridge 1961 New York City *Guri Dam 1963 Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela - as partner. *Glen Canyon Dam Arizona *Talmadge Bridge 1953–1954 Savannah, Georgia *Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel 1964 Hampton Roads *New Jersey Turnpike The company also undertook smaller projects ranging from roads in Ethiopia to Air Force early-warning stations in Labrador. Dissolution The company ceased operation in the late 1960s or early 1970s (records are not clear but 1971 is likely<). After dissolution, some operations were apparently taken over by Murphy Pacific. Since 1971, the New York Ship site has been owned by the South Jersey Port Corporation, a state agency, and operated as the Broadway Street Terminal. The Destroyer Yard was replaced in the 1960s by the Kitty Hawk drydock. That drydock is now the principal berth for the Broadway Terminal, and is used for general cargo including petroleum coke, coal, dolomite, steel products, wood products, minerals, cocoa beans and perishables.

The name lives on today as a licensed property by several foreign clothing manufacturers. Manufacturing Botany 500 was a brand name owned by the Botany 500 Group of New York. Their men’s suits and sport coats were manufactured in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by H. Daroff and Sons, who were contracted with Botany Mills of Passaic, New Jersey, to produce products and later bought the firm outright. Their plant was located at 23rd and Walnut Streets during the 1940s and ’50s and beyond. Until 1945, it was located in the Pitcairn Building at 1027 Arch Street. They also produced another line called Worsted-Tex that had the image of the head of a German Shepherd dog on its label. The office, on the first floor of the plant, had a stuffed German shepherd standing guard. The seventh and topmost floor contained the top coat design department and a fabric cutting floor. =Decline= Daroff and Sons and the Botany 500 group went bankrupt in August 1973. An attempt was made to turn the company over to another company, named Cohen and Sons, which was still operating profitably. Because of resistance by the company's employees, Cohen backed out of the deal by the end of September. When Daroff finally closed its doors in December 1973, Cohen and Sons bought the Botany 500 name and assets for $4 million. They planned to keep the labels, marketing, sales, and distribution of Botany as a separate Botany 500 line. With the garment business taking a downturn during the second half of the decade, the Botany and Cohen and Sons operations ceased production in 1986. The building was sold in 1989 for $1.75 million. Manufacturing under Botany 500 name was then outsourced to foreign companies.

Biography Bhatnagar's murder on 23 January 1999 became a scandal that reached into the top levels of Indian politics. Indian Police Service officer Ravi Kant Sharma was charged with the murder by the Delhi Police, who investigated the case. Sharma surrendered to the police on 27 September 2002, after having been in hiding since the arrest warrant was issued on 3 August of that year. Sharma allegedly got Bhatnagar killed because he feared she would expose their \\"intimate\\" relations. IPS officer Ravi Kant Sharma along with Sri Bhagwan Sharma, Satya Prakash and Pradeep Sharma were accused in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case and they were convicted by a Delhi Trial Court on 18 March 2008. Two other accused—Dev Prakash Sharma and Ved Prakash alias Kalu—were acquitted for want of evidence. Those convicted were sentenced to life imprisonment on 24 March 2008. On 12 October 2011 Delhi High Court acquitted Ravi Kant Sharma, Sri Bhagwan Sharma and Satya Prakash saying lack of evidence on appeal. The conviction of Pradeep Sharma was upheld. Bhatnagar was a writer for The Indian Express. She was the wife of Rakesh Bhatnagar and mother to Tanmay Bhatnagar. Shivani Bhatnagar was said to be friends with Ravi Kant Sharma and it was an acknowledged relationship known by Rakesh Bhatnagar and Ravi Kant Sharma's wife, Madhu. Madhu had accused BJP leader Pramod Mahajan of having intimate relations with Shivani and he was involved in the murder as a refute against her husband's accusations. Mahajan was found not guilty by the Delhi Police and he denied having any type of relationship with Shivani other than a professional one. Ravi Kant Sharma was charged by prosecutors for murdering Shivani Bhatnagar for reasons that she had legal documents that he had leaked to her and she was not willing to give back the possession of them back to him. It was said that she had some politically sensitive documents, relating to St Kitts case, that she was not giving to give back to Sharma and was going to threaten to expose him for it, so he executed her murder. Ravi Kant Sharma denied these allegations and was accused of having intimate relations with Shivani. It was theorized that Shivani wanted to reveal their relationship but he did not agree so she threatened to expose it, and before doing so, Sharma had gotten her killed so she would not ruin his social status. Trial The trial was held for the suspended IPS officer, Ravi Kant Sharma and Pradeep Sharma, who was hired by Ravi Kant Sharma to kill Shivani Bhatnagar. The trial consisted of the prosecutors debating on whether the plaintiffs deserve a death penalty or given a life sentence. The remaining three convicts, Sri Bhagawan, Ved Prakash Sharma, and Satya Prakash were also requested to be given a life sentence. Enough evidence was found between linked phone call records between Ravi Kant Sharma and Pradeep Sharma to prove that they were the cause for her death and had been conspiring a plan. An ongoing 9 year trial that has had over 209 witnesses, 4 judges, and has over 20,000 pages of records running resulted with Ravi Kant Sharma on 12 October 2011 being acquitted by the High Courts after being in jail for nine years (since 2002 when he surrendered himself in to the police) and the other convicts were deemed not guilty as well due to lack of evidence. However, Pradeep Sharma was jailed for almost four years from 2009-2013. Pradeep was arrested due to the evidence found of his handwriting found at the register of Shivani's apartment block which allowed him to get access to go within the apartment complex. Along with this, his fingerprints were found at the crime scene, in Shivani's apartment. There were many instances where the evidence was deemed as ineffective or was questioned on reliability. The phone calls between Ravi Kant Sharma and Pradeep Sharma were nicknamed PW135/28 and they won Shri Bhagwan acquittal as they held a lot of suspicion about its authenticity. Ravi Kant Sharma pleaded that the phone calls were tampered with by the police and cannot be relied on and this was further looked into by the court. The court states that since the records are not a directly available data from the telephone company they appear as documents that could have been tampered with they did not charge Ravi Kant Sharma.

Off the northern coast of this townland lies Kid Island, an island of rising on steep cliffs to a height of above sea level. The island is used for grazing sheep in the summer months. Kilcommon Parish consists of two peninsulas – Dún Chaocháin (on which Cill Ghallagáin lies) and Dún Chiortáin, to the west.  Archaeology and history  This townland has many forts and ancient buildings. In Kilgalligan graveyard which is close to the beach at Broadhaven Bay there is a large mound about which there are many stories. It has never been archaeologically investigated. It may be the remains of the early Christian church of St. Galligan, from who this townland takes its name. Galligan himself is considered to have been buried within the large cairn. Nearby is a holy well to which people come on pilgrimage on 14 August, the Eve of St. Galligan's Feast.(Corduff, Irish Folklore Commission). In the 1830s a survey reported that \\"the cairn was caused by accumulated burials until a sort of pyramid has been formed that, at a distance, has a curious effect with the headstones and small crosses covering all sides of its conical surface. Another writer at the time described it as \\"here are the ruins of a monastery\\".(Samuel Lewis, Topographical Dictionary) There was a promontory fort known as Doonkeeghan (Dún Chaocháin) which probably dated from the Bronze Age. In 1318 it belonged to the De Exeter-Jordan family. The family appears to have lived in the area for a long period of time as in 1905 a Dr. De Exeter- Jordan was Medical Officer of Knocknalower dispensary on the Dún Chiortáin peninsula of the same parish – Kilcommon, Erris. The Barrett clan built a fortified residence on the site of an earlier promontory fort in the 14th century AD. In 1580 the second husband of pirate queen Gráinne O'Malley is believed to have owned this fort, known as Doonaniron. Richard Burke owned large tracts of land along the north western coast of Erris. In 1618 the fort at Doonaniron became the property of Michael Cormuck who resided in Inver Castle on the Dún Chiortáin peninsula further west. This fort must have been an imposing structure. It had a lofty enclosing wall with a large arched gateway which was taken down by the great gale of January 1839. (Westropp, Promontory forts and Otway, Sketches in Erris and Tyrawley.) In 1838 there was a coastguard station, a watch house, boat house and signal post at Rinroe pier. During the Irish famine the area was badly affected and many perished. In November 1850, Robert Savage who was the postmaster at Bangor Erris wrote to Dublin Castle reporting that eighteen sheep on his farm at Cill Ghallagáin had been destroyed and several others badly injured. The police investigated but found no truth in the claim. It turned out that Mr Savage's objective was to have a police barracks built at Cill Ghallagáin. Mr. Savage intended building a fishing industry on his land at Cill Ghallagáin which he described as \\"a wild and mountainous district and with very disturbed neighbours and he is very scared of doing so until a police station is built on his lands\\". This wild townland was seen in a different light by Samuel Lewis, who claimed that \\"Kilgalligan Head is unrivalled in beauty and grandeur\\".  Microtoponymy  Cill Ghallagáin is well known for its strikingly detailed microtoponymy. Seán Ó hEinirí recalled over 800 minor place-names in this one townland in the mid 1970s. The names recorded for Cill Ghallagáin townland are mainly in Irish.http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/494352 They reflect the centrality of the bog, settlements, fields, caves, cliffs, coves, rocks and the history and views of the people more than a century ago. The names also reflect the transitional state of the Irish language locally in the later decades of the 19th and 20th centuries and give detailed accounts of much local folklore and beliefs. The book was researched by Séamas Ó Catháin and Patrick O'Flanagan.Ó Catháin, S. O'Flanagan, P. The Living Landscape, Kilgalligan, Erris (1975) Folklore Commission, Dublin. Field names can be seen as representing a key to a very local world, the local landscape which like the houses and yards are part of a private family space inaccessible to outsiders. The parish and the townland are knowable to the outsider – they are on the map and are signposted. But an unknown world of fields (and rocks, hills and other hidden spaces), labelled with homely and sometimes inexplicable names, slowly emerges from the landscape and the memories of local people.

Lavvu (or , , , , , , , , and ) is a temporary dwelling used by the Sami people of northern extremes of Northern Europe. It has a design similar to a Native American tipi but is less vertical and more stable in high winds. It enables the indigenous cultures of the treeless plains of northern Scandinavia and the high arctic of Eurasia to follow their reindeer herds. It is still used as a temporary shelter by the Sami, and increasingly by other people for camping. It should not be confused with the goahti, another type of Sami dwelling, or the Finnish laavu.  Historical definition  A lavvu in the late 1800s, from \\"Norge i det nittende aarhundrede\\" (1900). There are several historical references that describe the lavvu structure (also called a kota, or a variation on this name) used by the Sami. These structures have the following in common:Schefferus, Johannes. History of Lappland (English trans. Lapponia), 1674, p.80-86Manker, Ernst and Vorren, Ørnulv. Lapp Life and Customs: A Survey., Trans. Kathleen McFarlane, Oxford University Press London, 1962, p.42-46Muus, Nathan. \\"Building a Lavvu\\", Bulletin of Primitive Technology, Fall, 1997, No.14. p.21-22Manker, Ernst. People of Eight Seasons, Crescent Books, New York, 1963, p.80-81Eidheim, Harald. \\"Ethno-Political Development among the Sami after World War II\\", Sami Culture in a New Era: The Norwegian Sami Experience, Gaski, H. ed. (1997) p.49 # The lavvu is supported by three or more evenly spaced forked or notched poles that form a tripod. # There are upwards of ten or more unsecured straight poles that are laid up against the tripod and which give form to the structure. # The lavvu does not need any stakes, guy-wire or ropes to provide shape or stability to the structure. # The shape and volume of the lavvu is determined by the size and quantity of the poles that are used for the structure. # There is no center pole needed to support this structure. No historical record has come to light that describes the Sami using a single- pole structure claimed to be a lavvu, or any other Scandinavian variant name for the structure. The definition and description of this structure has been fairly consistent since the 17th century and possibly many centuries earlier. The goahti, also used by the Sami, has a different pole configuration. While trees suitable to make lavvu poles are quite easy to find and often left at the site for later use, the four curved poles of the goahti have to be carried.  Traditional and modern lavvu  Central-poled lavvo-like tent The traditional lavvu consists of two types of wooden poles: 1) three or more forked poles and; 2) several straight poles. The forked poles have a two-stem fork at the top end. These three poles are interlocked so that they form a tripod. Upon this assembly of the forked poles, the straight poles are laid in a circular fashion. Reindeer hides were used as a cover until the mid-19th century when large amounts of inexpensive manufactured British textiles were made available to the Sami. The traditional lavvus are still in use, but for ease of transportation modern designs have replaced the wooden poles with aluminum ones and heavier textiles with lighter fabrics. In addition, instead of an open fire an oven can be used. This reduces the smoke but produces less light making it quite dark inside. A lavvu of this type is easier to carry and is a common alternative to the tents often used for camping. Very large lavvus also exist with enough room for dozens of people. These are typically used for large families.  Symbolism  The coat of arms of Kautokeino (Guovdageaidnu), Norway. Sámi Parliament building in Kárášjohka (Karasjok), Norway in 2005. The lavvu has been – and still is – a strong symbol for the Sami as a cultural haven. The lavvu played a prominent role in two events during the 20th century as more than just a shelter. The first was at the end of World War II during the winter of 1944/45 when the German troops retreated westward across northern Norway, burning most of the housing in Finnmark and eastern Troms counties before the Russian Red Army. Because of this destruction, many Sami lived in lavvus for many years afterward because of the lack of housing and unemployment from this period.Manker, Ernst and Vorren, Ørnulv. Lapp Life and Customs: A Survey., Trans. Kathleen McFarlane, Oxford University Press London, 1962, p.154 Some of these Sami are still alive today who were born in these lavvus and have fond memories of them.Kitti, Anja. (Sami Elder; former Chair, Sami Siida of North America, Toronto, Canada), interview. July, 1995/Nov., 2007. The second event was when the lavvu was used during the Alta controversy in Norway from 1979 to 1981. A lavvu was set up in front of the Storting (Norwegian Parliament Building) which became an international focal point as several Sami went on a hunger strike to protest the proposed dam project that would have destroyed reindeer grazing grounds of the Sami herders in the area and inundated the Sami village of Máze. This lavvu became center stage in the political fight for Sami indigenous rights.Somby, Ande. http://somban.com/nealg06.html . Retrieved 11/5/2007Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, Ville bruke soldater i Alta- aksjon; Retrieved: 11/7/2007Eidheim, Harald. \\"Ethno-Political Development among the Sami after World War II\\", Sami Culture in a New Era: The Norwegian Sami Experience, Gaski, H. ed. (1997) p.49 The irony was not missed when the Oslo police bulldozed the lavvu during the protest.Somby, Ande. http://somban.com/nealg09.html . Retrieved 11/5/2007 This conflict gave birth to the Sami Rights Committee which addressed Sami legal rights within Norway, resulting in the Sami Act of 1987. This in turn became the foundation for the Sámediggi (Sami Parliament of Norway), a democratically elected body for the Sami in Norway in 1989, and the Finnmark Act of 2005. The strong symbolism of the lavvu has also been shown in its pictorial form as the coat-of-arms for the municipality of Guovdageaidnu (Kautokeino) and in the physical shape of the Sámediggi building, whose shape was inspired by the lavvu.  Modern controversy  Bell tent U.S. Patent #14740 from April 22, 1856. Invented by Henry Hopkins Sibley. Easily confused with a lavvu, but having a very different pole structure. Since the late 1990s there have been a few European companies that claim to offer a \\"lavvu\\", but with a very different construction. This \\"lavvu\\" has a single pole which supports the tent in the middle of the structure, and is maintained and supported by stakes to the ground, often with guy-wires ropes to expand the cover outward giving its fullness. This pole and rope structure is closer in construction to a bell tent or conical tent which has been in use since the 1850s, and possibly much earlier. The bell/conical tent is different from the lavvu in three major ways: 1) \\"The tent is pitched by means of a single pole…\\" in the center of the tent which is essential for support of the structure;Sibley, Henry Hopkins. Conical Tent, US Patent #14740, April 22, 1856. p.2-3 2) stakes are used and are essential to provide support and fullness to the tent as without them the structure would collapse; and, 3) guy-wires or ropes are often needed to provide fullness to the structure, depending on the size of the tent. No historical records have been found that described the Sami using this single- pole construction. Only since the 1990s have these tent manufactures mentioned this type of single-pole structure to be a lavvu. The placing of the word \\"lavvu\\" on a single-pole tent structure different from the historical tent described as being used by the Sami, may be an example of cultural appropriation.  Using a lavvu  Sami lavvu at the open-air museum in Jukkasjarvi, Sweden. Inside the living quarters of the lavvu, there is a fireplace in the middle used for heating and to keep mosquitoes away. The smoke escapes through the smoke hole in the top of the lavvu that is usually left open. Occasionally a rough blanket is wrapped round the smoke hole to make the opening smaller, but not to the point where smoke would be prevented from escaping. In order to prevent smoke from building up inside, proper air circulation is maintained by leaving an opening between the ground and the cover, or leaving the door slightly open. Keeping the fire hot enough to let the heated smoke rise through the smoke hole is necessary. Traditionally, there was a smaller door in the back of the lavvu, opposite the front door, called the bear door. This was used for ceremonial purposes, such as removing the dead (not appropriate out of the front door) and similar functions.Schibe, Tom (North American Sami Elder and reindeer owner; Sami Siida of North America, Milltown, WI, USA), interview. July, 2006. Few lavvus today have this door for such purposes.  Other tent designs similar to lavvu  * Tipi - The Native American tipi is visually similar to the lavvu but has a different cut to the fabric and a slightly different pole structure and placement. * Chum (tent) - The peoples of northern Ural, northern Siberia and the Tyvan Todzhans of southern Siberia have a tent structure that is similar in design and often much larger than the lavvu. It is still in use by these people as a year-round shelter. * Goahti (, , ) - The goahti is often confused with a lavvu, although it has a different pole structure, is more elongated and is typically lower to the ground. In the first photo above, the tent in the background is a lavvu, while the tent in the foreground is a goahti. * Kohte, a traditional German scouting tent derived from the Lavvu, but is usually black.

It was painted at some point in 1907 and 1908, during the height of what scholars call his \\"Golden Period\\". It was exhibited in 1908 under the title Liebespaar (the lovers) as stated in the catalogue of the exhibition. The painting depicts a couple embracing each other, their bodies entwined in elaborate beautiful robes decorated in a style influenced by the contemporary Art Nouveau style and the organic forms of the earlier Arts and Crafts movement. The painting now hangs in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum in the Belvedere, Vienna, and is considered a masterpiece of Vienna Secession (local variation of Art Nouveau) and Klimt's most popular work.Partsch, 267, 276 Background Fulfilment, a sketch for the 1905–09 Brussels Stoclets. Love, intimacy, and sexuality are common themes found in Gustav Klimt's works. The Stoclet Frieze and the Beethoven Frieze are such examples of Klimt's focus on romantic intimacy. Both works are precursors to The Kiss and feature the recurring motif of an embracing couple. It is thought that Klimt and his companion Emilie Flöge modeled for the work,Klimt by Gilles Neret, 57 but there is no evidence or record to prove this. Others suggest the female was the model known as 'Red Hilda'; she bears strong resemblance to the model in his Woman with feather boa, Goldfish and Danaë. Description The Kiss, Francesco Hayez, 1859 Gustav Klimt depicts the couple locked in an intimate embrace against a gold, flat background. The two figures are situated at the edge of a patch of flowery meadow that ends under the woman's exposed feet. The man wears a robe printed with geometric patterns and subtle swirls. He wears a crown of vines while the woman wears a crown of flowers. She is shown in a flowing dress with floral patterns. The man's face is not shown to the audience and instead, his face is bent downward to press a kiss to the woman's cheek, and his hands are cradling the woman's face. Her eyes are closed, with one arm wrapped around the man's neck, the other resting gently on his hand, and her face is upturned to receive the man's kiss. The patterns in the painting suggests the style of Art Nouveau and the organic forms of the Arts and Crafts movement. At the same time, the background evokes the conflict between two- and three-dimensionality intrinsic to the work of Degas and other modernists. Paintings such as The Kiss are visual manifestations of fin-de- siecle spirit because they capture a decadence conveyed by opulent and sensuous images. The use of gold leaf recalls medieval \\"gold-ground\\" paintings, illuminated manuscripts, earlier mosaics, and the spiral patterns in the clothes recall Bronze Age art and the decorative tendrils seen in Western art since before classical times. The man's head ends very close to the top of the canvas, a departure from traditional Western canons that reflects the influence of Japanese prints, as does the painting's simplified composition. Cupola of the choir: An Angel Offers a Model of The Church to Bishop Ecclesius, Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy Klimt's use of gold was inspired by a trip he had made to Italy in 1903. When he visited Ravenna he saw the Byzantine mosaics in the Church of San Vitale. For Klimt, the flatness of the mosaics and their lack of perspective and depth only enhanced their golden brilliance, and he started to make unprecedented use of gold and silver leaf in his own work. Private Life of a Masterpiece, BBC TV It has also been argued that in this picture Klimt represented the moment Apollo kisses Daphne, following the Metamorphoses of Ovid narrative. Art historians have also suggested that Klimt is depicting the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice. More specifically, Klimt seems to be showing the exact moment when Orpheus turns around to caress Eurydice and loses his love forever. As shown in this painting, the woman being held is slightly translucent, indicating a fading away or disappearance—as told in the story. Reception Klimt painted The Kiss soon after his three-part Vienna Ceiling series, which created a scandal and were criticized as both \\"pornographic\\" and evidence of \\"perverted excess\\". The works had recast the artist as an enfant terrible for his anti- authoritarian and anti-popularist views on art. He wrote, \\"If you can not please everyone with your deeds and your art, please a few\\".Inscribed on the reverse of the 1899 Nuda Veritas. See Schwartz, 29 The Kiss was exhibited in 1908 in Vienna in the Kunstschau – the building created in collaboration by Josef Hoffmann, Gustav Klimt, Otto Prutscher, Koloman Moser and many others, to coincide with the celebrations in Vienna for the sixtieth anniversary of Emperor Francis Joseph I’s reign from June 1 to November 16, 1908. The Kiss, however, was enthusiastically received, and was purchased, still unfinished, by the Austrian government when it was put on public exhibition. References to The Kiss In February 2013 Syrian artist Tammam Azzam superimposed an image of the painting onto a bombed building in an unidentified part of Syria, in a work called Freedom Graffiti, to call attention to the plight of war in his country. In 2012, 20th Century Fox released the action/romance movie This Means War starring Reese Witherspoon, Tom Hardy, and Chris Pine. The film features a scene where Pine and Witherspoon's characters tour a private Klimt collection, with The Kiss being the focal piece.Nichol, Joseph McGinty, director. This Means War. 20th Century Fox, 2012. Altered Carbon, an American dystopian science fiction cyberpunk web television series, also makes reference to the painting which the main characters find leaning against the wall of an apartment in the far future. The painting is also featured in the 1980 film Bad Timing directed by Nicolas Roeg and starring Art Garfunkel and Theresa Russell. In the 2004 anime Elfen Lied, the OP Lilium features many allusions to this painting and others of similar nature. In the 2010 independent film Tiny Furniture, directed by Lena Dunham, there is a scene in which the character Frankie (played by Merritt Wever) comments on freshmen moving into her college dormitory, and she pokes fun at the ubiquity of The Kiss, exclaiming \\"...all the collapsable hampers and mini-fridges and posters of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss.\\" References =Sources= * Alfred Weidinger, Stefanie Penck: Gustav Klimt The Kiss.

Her columns focused on foreign affairs issues and appeared in approximately 120 newspapers in North and South America. She was the author of ten books, including a biography of Fidel Castro and a memoir of her life as a foreign correspondent, Buying the Night Flight.  Early life and education  Geyer was born in Chicago, and graduated from Calumet High School. She graduated from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in 1956, where she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega sorority. She attended the University of Vienna on a Fulbright Scholarship. She spoke Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Russian.  Professional career  Her first job was with the Chicago Southtown Economist. From 1959 to 1974, Geyer was a reporter for the now- defunct Chicago Daily News, where she worked from society reporting to the news desk and eventually foreign correspondent. After leaving the paper, she began her syndicated column. In 1973, she was the first Western reporter to interview Saddam Hussein, then Vice President of Iraq. She also interviewed Yasser Arafat, Anwar Sadat, King Hussein of Jordan, Muammar al-Gaddafi, and the Ayatollah Khomeini. She reported on rebels in the Dominican Republic, was held by authorities in Angola for her reporting during civil war, and was threatened with death by the Mano Blanca death squads in Guatemala. Geyer had more than 21 honorary degrees, including three from Northwestern alone. In an October 1996 letter published in the Chicago Tribune, now Judge Ramon Ocasio III criticized Geyer for anti-immigrant and anti-Hispanic rhetoric in her Op- ed \\"The anti-Columbus Day march.\\"  Personal life and death  In 1992, the CBS sitcom Hearts Afire thinly based its lead female character, Georgie Anne Lahti, on Geyer's life and career. In January 1993, Chicago Tribune columnist Mike Royko excoriated the show's producers for doing so, and stated that Geyer was not pleased with that depiction. \\"Did the TV producers ask if they could use the real Georgie Anne that way?\\" Royko wrote. \\"Not only did they not ask, they loftily deny that their TV Georgie Anne is in any way based on the real life Georgie Anne. A mere coincidence, yuck, yuck. Not to butter you up, but most of my readers are logical. So let me pose this question: If you were a Chicago-born blond named Georgie Anne, had built an international reputation as a foreign correspondent and columnist, and had written an important book about Fidel Castro, and you turned on your TV and saw a lewd sitcom about a Chicago-born blond named Georgie Anne who built a national reputation as a foreign correspondent and had written an important book about Fidel Castro, wouldn't you say something like: 'Hey, what the hell's going on?'\\" Geyer developed cancer of the tongue more than a decade before her death.

Early life Castro began work as a fashion stylist and clothing designer. Over the years, he worked for as a stylist on fashion shoots or designed clothing for Marlene Stewart, Bette Midler, David Bowie, Herb Ritts, the style agency Cloutier, George Hurrell, Interview magazine, GQ magazine, Vanity Fair magazine, Rolling Stone magazine, I-D magazine, Tina Turner and John Leguizamo. Castro was the designer for Michele Lamy's first menswear collection- Lamy Men, (1986-1989). Photographic career In 1986, photographer Joel-Peter Witkin bought him his first automatic camera. In 1988, at the age of 30, Castro became a freelance photographer, and his work appeared in the Los Angeles gay news magazines Frontiers, Drummer and the national gay news magazine, The Advocate. His first solo exhibition, \\"Nothing But A Man, Everything But A Woman\\", debuted in 1989 at A Different Light Bookstore in Silver Lake, a suburb of Los Angeles. It was followed a year later by \\"Mass Murder & A Cute Boy\\" at the same location. Throughout the years, Castro has had a number of exhibitions, including \\"Furotica: It Ain't Exactly Bambi\\" at the Track 16 gallery in Los Angeles, 2003. Castro's work is collected by the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, ONE Archives: National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries, Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art, and the Tom of Finland Foundation. His 1994 short film of hustler interviews inspired Bruce LaBruce to film Hustler White with Tony Ward. Castro collaborated on the film as writer and co-director with LaBruce, which became an international sensation. In 1998, he appeared in Sex/Life in L.A. Jochen Hick's adult documentary about the sex lives of the guys who make L.A. adult movies.Terri Ginsberg and Andrea Mensch (Edditors) Castro has directed a number of other short films and a documentary. Rick Castro has lived in Los Angeles his entire life. He was the West coast correspondent for the Australia-based Studio Magazines, publisher of the nude male art photography magazine Blue 2001 thru 2007. Rick's first gallery opened at Les Duex Cafes, Hollywood, in 2002, and premiered the first Furry themed art show. Castro then founded and ran Antebellum Gallery, the only fetish art gallery in America, and perhaps the world- November 11, 2005 thru January 1, 2017. Castro shot the F/W lookbook 2014 for designer Rick Owens using his 93-year-old father Al Castro as the featured model. During October, 2015, Rick Castro received an artist lifetime Achievement award from the Tom of Finland foundation. Castro's photography was featured in Rick Owens: Subhuman, Inhuman, Superhuman at Triennale di Milano, December 2017- March 2018. Castro was interviewed by his former boyfriend, designer Rick Owens for the May 2019 issue of Autre Magazine, and featured in the historic first queer issue of Los Angeles Magazine, June 2019. Castro is contributing photographer and writer for Anotherman Magazine UK. Critical assessment Castro works predominately in black-and-white photography. Castro himself says his work is highly time-bound, linked to the 1980s and early 1990s: > My documentation is a time capsule of that period.

In many ways, Castro can almost be said to be a historical photographer, recreating images and looks from that time period rather than capturing contemporary styles. \\"Nostalgia\\" is not a word one usually associates with BDSM photography, but in Castro's case it may be an apt adjective. Castro's photography also stands in the quasi-religious tradition of most BDSM photography. The art historian and critic Edward Lucie-Smith has pointed out that Castro's work is deeply rooted in religious art, especially Catholic art of the Baroque period. The believer, suffering for his beliefs, is mimicked by the gay man, suffering for his homosexuality. The ecstasy of martyrdom is mimicked by the ecstasy of sex. These themes were explored by the Christian Baroque painters, and Castro's bondage photography—like most bondage photography—draws heavily on these paintings for its poses. But Castro's photography is not run-of-the-mill BDSM imagery. Writer Mark Christopher Harvey notes that Castro's photography \\"can be viewed as a long form of meditation—not only on the aesthetic virtues of bondage but also on the psyche of sex itself...\\" Harvey points to the \\"wry humor\\" that is often missing in more commercially inspired or less artistic BDSM photographs. In including humor in his work, Castro confounds the Baroque—which focuses on simple, strong, dramatic expression—in favor of Mannerism, and he avoids the self- conscious, overcharged, unnaturally detailed, jarring elements of Mannerism. Castro's work moves beyond artistic characteristics to capture the sexual fetishism of BDSM as well. The transgressive nature of leather fetishism—hearkening back to 'bad-boy' film images made popular by James Dean and Marlon Brando—intersects with the transgressive nature of homosexual sex and promiscuity in the era of AIDS. Castro's images have power because they are those of the true fetishist. These are not images produced by 'just any' photographer who can hire a handsome model and buy a leather harness off the rack at a local sex shop. Castro's images reflect the imagination and variety of BDSM and leather fetishists; they create and lead, rather than follow, popular culture and sexual fashion.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 through Anne Arundel County in the U.S. state of Maryland. It is located south of the Patapsco River and north of the Severn River. There are two public park paddling access points, Beachwood Park on the north shore a half mile east of the Magothy Bridge Road bridge, and Spriggs Farm Park off Bayberry Drive, on the south shore two miles west of the Magothy's mouth. Both are Anne Arundel County parks. Description The Magothy's tidal estuary portion extends for eight miles from its mouth at the Chesapeake Bay south of Gibson Island. The tidal Magothy reaches a maximum width of 2.5 miles including Sillery Bay and Tar Cove (formerly Tar Coal Cove) adjoining Gibson Island on the west. The source of its four-mile non-tidal portion is a small pond on Woodland Estates Way in Chartwell, just west of Elvaton Park, four miles north of Millersville. It is well known among recreational boaters for the popular anchorage north of Dobbins Island. Its navigable tidal portion is crossed by one bridge, located on Magothy Bridge Road in Pasadena. Its upper, nontidal portion is dammed at MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) to form Lake Waterford at the site of an old mill dam. Some of the creeks on its south shore drain highly developed portions of Severna Park and Arnold, especially North Cypress Creek which drains much of the Park Plaza and Giant shopping centers along Ritchie Highway north of McKinsey Road. The Baltimore Light Station is located in the Chesapeake two miles east of the mouth of the river. Watershed Over six miles of Chesapeake shoreline from Sandy Point to the non-Magothy east side of Gibson Island, including the Little Magothy River, all well beyond the official and actual mouth of the Magothy (325 meters south of the southern tip of Gibson Island), are not in the Magothy drainage basin but are often included in county and state government studies of the watershed. These studies outline a watershed area (including the water surface) of , or of land, with a total watershed area is 20% water. Etymology The river was labeled \\"Magoty River\\" on a 1663 map and \\"Maggotty River\\" on a 1690 map, either an Indian phrase \\"mega, pi-meguke,\\" which means a place without trees or a wide plain, or derived from \\"maggot\\", which in older English usage meant a fantastic notion or a caprice.Magothy in the Middle, Joel McCord, Chesapeake Bay Magazine, June 2004 Magothy River Association In 1946, the Magothy River Association (MRA) was formed when the U.S. Naval Academy wanted to use the peninsula of Sandy Point for a Naval Aeoranautic Training base. Sandy Point was part of a farm belonging to William Labrot. Charles L. Pumphrey and Bill Labrot testified before a Senate Committee in the summer of 1945 against such a use as they, Navy men in World War I, felt that this installation would be detrimental to the beauty and tranquility of the Bay area. WIlliam Labrot gave the land in question to the state on condition that it be a dedicated park, and with the participation of local residents, Charles L. Pumphrey formed and was the first President of the Magothy River Assoc. This was one of the first efforts of \\"environmentalism\\" long before the word came into common usage. Today this organization concentrates on issues concerning land use, water quality monitoring, fish habitat and reforestation programs. Volunteer scientific divers were organized in 1998 and assist with the restoration and management of underwater grasses and oyster habitats. Water quality The aquatic health of the Magothy River has been declining in recent years. In 2008 the river was given a health rating of 30%, down from 42% in 2007 and 65% in 2004.Magothy health declines : Annual report finds underwater grasses vanishing, Annapolis Capital, 2–20–08 The river's overall health score was determined by three contributing factors: underwater grasses, water clarity, and dissolved oxygen. The Magothy scored below par in all three of these categories, the worst of which being the underwater grasses. The Magothy had of underwater grass mapped in 2008, achieving only 15% of the goal of . The water clarity status in 2008 was only slightly better than SAV status, with 19% of measurements exceeding the 0.97 meter depth which allows underwater grasses enough sunlight to grow, down from 44% in 2007. The Magothy scored the best in 2008 for dissolved oxygen; 55% of measurements exceeded its goal of 5 milligrams per liter, down from 69% in 2007.The Magothy River Index Creeks and tidal coves Almost all of the creeks and tidal coves on the Magothy are named, partly as the result of a project started in 2001 by the Magothy River Association. They are shown on a map produced as part of that project,Magothy River map: Map made in 2004 by the Magothy River Association, shows names of most creeks and other water bodies and the major ones are shown on the USGS topographic map.topo map of Magothy There are nine non-tidal streams listed below along the Upper Magothy River.

It first appeared in the April 1940 issue of Astonishing Stories and was reprinted in the 1972 collection The Early Asimov. It was the second science fiction story written by Asimov, and the oldest story of his still in existence. Writing and publication Asimov came up with the idea for the story, which he called \\"Stowaway\\", after his first meeting with John W. Campbell on June 21, 1938. His first story, \\"Cosmic Corkscrew\\", was rejected by Campbell on 23 June. In his autobiography, I, Asimov: A Memoir, the author recalled that Campbell sent him a rejection letter that was so kind and it prompted him to write another story called \\"Stowaway\\" (\\"The Callistan Menace\\"). He finished the first draft on 28 June, and the final draft on July 10. He submitted \\"Stowaway\\" to Campbell in person during another visit on the 18th. Suspecting that Campbell would reject it, Asimov spent the subway ride home coming up with the plot for a third story, \\"Marooned off Vesta\\". This third story was published first in the March 1939 issue of the Amazing Stories. Campbell did indeed reject \\"Stowaway\\", based on the story's \\"general air of amateurishness, constraint, forcing\\". On 3 August Asimov submitted the story to Thrilling Wonder Stories. When Thrilling Wonder rejected it, Asimov mailed the story to the offices of Amazing Stories in Chicago, which also rejected it. In the summer of 1939, following the sale of some later stories, Asimov revised \\"Stowaway\\", retitled it \\"Magnetic Death\\", and again submitted it to Thrilling Wonder Stories and Amazing Stories, and again it was rejected. Later that year, Asimov's friend Frederik Pohl became editor of two new magazines, Astonishing Stories and Super Science Stories. He accepted \\"Magnetic Death\\" on November 16, 1939, and it finally appeared in the April 1940 issue of Astonishing Stories under the title \\"The Callistan Menace\\". Asimov once described Pohl as \\"an inveterate title-changer\\". As one of Asimov's first creations, \\"The Callistan Menace\\" was strongly influenced by Stanley G. Weinbaum, a popular writer during the 1930s. Weinbaum's fiction had a consistent picture of the Solar System that was astronomically correct, at least according to the knowledge available during the 1930s. Plot summary The scoutship Ceres is assigned to explore the Jovian moon Callisto, outermost of the four Galilean moons. Seven previous ships landed there over a 25-year period and never returned. Two crewmen discover a stowaway in the supply room, a 13-year-old boy named Stanley Fields who believes in the heroic spacemen and villainous pirates of dime novels. The crew adopts Fields as a mascot, even repairing an obsolete rubber space suit for him, and the stowaway's presence distracts others from the death they fear is likely. When the Ceres lands on Callisto, the crew find a previous scoutship, the Phobos, still intact. An inspection of the Phobos reveals it to be covered with dried slime, and the bodies of its crew are discovered. Soon a horde of four-foot-long slugs emerges from a nearby lake and approaches the Phobos. Two of the Ceres crewmen are overcome by a mysterious affliction, and a third barely makes it back to the ship. The captain of the Ceres realizes that the slugs are using magnetic fields to stun the crewmen, amplified by their steel space suits. Fields volunteers to retrieve the unconscious crewmen in his rubber space suit. He brings the first back, but while retrieving the second he falls victim to an air leak and barely makes it back to the ship. Fields and the unconscious crewmen survive, and Ceres safely departs Callisto. Trivia *Stanley Fields was named after Asimov's younger brother, Stanley Asimov. *The Callistan Menace is the first Asimov story to mention a drink called Martian Jabra Water.

It is approximately long. Wiconisco Creek in Porter Township, just south of Tower City, in winter. Course Wiconisco Creek begins on a bend on a mountain in Porter Township, Schuylkill County. It flows in the general direction of west-southwest for several miles between two mountains, Big Lick Mountain, which is north of the creek and Stony Mountain, which is south of the creek. The creek passes near Tower City, where the southern border of its valley is defined by Berry Mountain, and shortly afterwards leaves Schuylkill County. Upon leaving Schuylkill County, Wiconisco Creek enters Williams Township, Dauphin County. In this township, the creek continues in a westward direction, crossing U.S. Route 209 and passing Williamstown. Further on, the creek enters Wiconisco Township, where it passes by the community of Lykens. Here, it receives the tributary Bear Creek and then the tributary Rattling Creek. Wiconisco Creek then leaves Wiconisco Township and enters Washington Township, where it picks up the tributaries Big Run and Canoe Gap Run. The creek then reaches the end of its valley and turns abruptly north, crossing U.S. Route 209 again. It briefly enters Lykens Township before starting to meander southwest back into Washington Township. Here, the creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 225 and continues meandering in the same direction. It crosses U.S. Route 209 again and enters Upper Paxton Township, where it begins to meander parallel to Berry Mountain. After a while, the creek stops meandering, but continues west, receiving the tributary Little Wiconisco Creek. The creek then reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River between Lenkerville and Millersburg. Wiconisco Creek reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. =Tributaries= Tributaries of Wiconisco Creek include Little Wiconisco Creek, Keefers Run, Big Run, Rattling Creek, and Bear Creek. Rattling Creek is the largest of these tributaries, with a watershed area of . Little Wiconisco Creek is the second-largest tributary. Its watershed has an area of . The smallest tributary of Wiconisco Creek is Big Run, whose watershed has an area of . Additionally, the tributary Rattling Creek has a number of sub-tributaries. Hydrology Wiconisco Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by abandoned mine drainage, wastewater, and agriculture. Approximately half of the main stem and large parts of Little Wiconisco Creek are considered to be impaired. The creek's water quality is degraded by Bear Creek and three tunnels: the Big Lick Tunnel, Keffer's Tunnel, and the Porter Tunnel.

Geography, geology, and climate The elevation near the mouth of Wiconisco Creek is above sea level. The highest elevation in the watershed is above sea level. This occurs on Big Lick Mountain. From river mile 37.5 to the mouth, the elevation of the creek decreases at a rate of per mile. Some strainers are situated on Wiconisco Creek between Lykens and Loyalton. The creek flows through a gorge for several miles in its lower reaches. It is a relatively small creek upstream of Lykens. The channel of Wiconisco Creek is tortuous. The creek flows through rock formations made of sandstone and shale. Deposits of anthracite occur in the watershed. The main rock formation in the watershed is the Mauch Chunk Formation. Other rock formations include the Duncannon Member of the Catskill Formation, the Llewellyn Formation, the Pocono Formation, the Pottsville Formation, and the Spechty Kopf Formation. The Pocono Formation occurs in the southern part of the Wiconisco Creek watershed and also on the northwestern edge. The Llewellyn Formation and the Pottsville Group occur in the northeastern part of the watershed. The Pottsville Group is also found in the watershed's southeastern portion. The Spechty Kopf Formation and the Duncannon Member of the Catskill Formation occur in small areas in its southernmost portion. The rest of the watershed is on the Mauch Chunk Formation. The Hazleton-Dekalb-Lehew soil association occurs in the southern, northeastern, and northwestern parts of the Wiconisco Creek watershed. A minute area near the mouth of the creek is occupied by soil of the Duncannon- Urban-Land-Chavies association. The rest of the watershed is occupied by the Leck Kill-Minersville-Calvin soil association. The annual rate of precipitation in the watershed of Wiconisco Creek ranges between and . Watershed The watershed of Wiconisco Creek has an area of . The watershed of the creek is situated in southwestern Schuylkill County and northern Dauphin County. The watershed is on several United States Geological Survey 7.5 minute quadrangles: the Elizabethville quadrangle, the Lykens quadrangle, the Millersburg quadrangle, the Pine Grove quadrangle, and the Tower City quadrangle. Numerous boroughs and villages are situated in the watershed of Wiconisco Creek. Boroughs in the western part of the watershed include Berrysburg, Elizabethville, and Millersburg. Boroughs in the central part of the watershed include Lykens, Gratz, and Wiconisco and boroughs in the watershed's eastern portion include Tower City and Williamstown. Villages in the eastern part of the watershed include Muir, Orwin, Reinerton, and Sheridan. Villages in the central part of the watershed include Big Run, Dayton, and Loyalton and villages in the watershed's western section include Cloverly Acres, Pleasant Hills, and Reservoir Heights. Major roads in the watershed of Wiconisco Creek include U.S. Route 209 and also Pennsylvania Route 225 and Pennsylvania Route 325. A large number of township roads are also found in the watershed. Almost all of the southern part and northern and northwestern edges of the watershed of Wiconisco Creek is forested land, including Pennsylvania State Game Lands. Nearly all of the western part of the watershed is agricultural land. Abandoned mining land is found in patches in the watershed's eastern half. Most of the watershed's population centers are found in a band running through the central part of the watershed from east to west. History, etymology, and industries The name of Wiconisco Creek comes from a Native American word meaning \\"wet and dirty camp\\". Coal mining (both strip mining and deep mining) is done in the upper reaches of the watershed of Wiconisco Creek, and has been since the late 1800s. There are six active mining permits in the watershed. The remains of a dam are located in the lower reaches. In the early 1900s, the Pennsylvania Railroad followed Wiconisco Creek between its mouth and Williamstown. The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad followed the creek from its headwaters as far as Lykens. Biology Groves of hemlock can be found on Wiconisco Creek, as can alder trees. Wiconisco Creek is designated as a warmwater fishery in Dauphin County. Recreation It is possible to canoe on of Wiconisco Creek during snowmelt in late winter and spring or several days after heavy rains. The creek is considered to be suitable for novice canoers. However, there are Class 1 and Class 2 rapids on the creek near the community of Lykens. Edward Gertler describes the scenery as \\"poor to good\\" in his book Keystone Canoeing.

Their unusual sound is difficult to categorise, drawing a small but enthusiastic following, leading to features in The Wire, Resonance (which later grew into the Resonance FM radio station) and jazz magazine EST. One admirer is Thurston Moore, who invited the group to support Sonic Youth in London in 2000, a performance they released on CD. Roger Sutherland died in 2004, but the group continues to perform sporadically. Clive Graham presented a regular show on Resonance FM until March 2006 entitled Sound Poets Exposed.

Lotus, a French steamer, and the S.S. Bozkourt, a Turkish steamer, in a region just north of Mytilene (Greece). As a result of the accident, eight Turkish nationals aboard the Bozkourt drowned when the vessel was torn apart by the Lotus. Background On 7 September 1927 the case was presented before the Permanent Court of International Justice, the judicial branch of the League of Nations, the predecessor of the United Nations. The issue at stake was Turkey's jurisdiction to try Monsieur Demons, the French lieutenant on watch duty at the time of the collision. Since the collision occurred on the high seas, France claimed that the state whose flag the vessel flew had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter. France proffered case law, through which it attempted to show at least state practice in support of its position. However, those cases involved ships that both flew the flag of the same state. The Court, therefore, by a bare majority, rejected France's position stating that there was no rule to that effect in international law. Lotus principle The Lotus principle or Lotus approach, usually considered a foundation of international law, says that sovereign states may act in any way they wish so long as they do not contravene an explicit prohibition. The application of this principle - an outgrowth of the Lotus case - to future incidents raising the issue of jurisdiction over people on the high seas was changed by article 11Convention of the High Seas (1958) of the 1958 High Seas Convention. The convention, held in Geneva, laid emphasis on the fact that only the flag state or the state of which the alleged offender was a national had jurisdiction over sailors regarding incidents occurring in high seas. This \\"flag state principle\\" has since been also been implemented in United Nations Convention on the Law Of the Sea (UNCLOS), e.g. in article 92 and, in regards to enforcement of environmental legislation, article 217(1).Jesper Jarl Fanø 2019). Enforcing International Maritime Legislation on Air Pollution through UNCLOS. Hart Publishing. Ch. 6 and 8. The principle has also been used in arguments against the reasons of the United States of America for opposing the existence of the International Criminal Court (ICC).US Opposition to the International Criminal Court Mahmut Esat Bozkurt In the court the Turkish side was represented by Mahmut Esat Bozkurt, the Minister of Justice. In 1934, when Turkey adopted the formal surname system, Mahmut Esat chose the surname Bozkurt as a reminiscence of the case.

Frequently they are created in order to be intermixed with genuine documents and thus manipulate the results of search engines, as with Spam blogs. They are also carried along in email in order to fool spam filters by giving the spam the superficial characteristics of legitimate text. Sometimes nonsensical documents are created with computer assistance for humorous effect, as with Dissociated press or Flarf poetry. They have also been used to challenge the veracity of a publication--MIT students submitted papers generated by a computer program called SCIgen to a conference, where they were initially accepted. This led the students to claim that the bar for submissions was too low. With the amount of computer generated text outpacing the ability of people to humans to curate it, there needs some means of distinguishing between the two. Yet automated approaches to determining absolutely whether a text is authentic or not face intrinsic challenges of semantics. Noam Chomsky coined the phrase \\"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously\\" giving an example of grammatically- correct, but semantically incoherent sentence; some will point out that in certain contexts one could give this sentence (or any phrase) meaning.

They have long been considered reptiliomorphs, and most paleontologists may still accept this point of view, but some analyses suggest that seymouriamorphs are stem-tetrapods (not more closely related to Amniota than to Lissamphibia). Many seymouriamorphs were terrestrial or semi-aquatic. However, aquatic larvae bearing external gills and grooves from the lateral line system have been found, making them unquestionably amphibians. The adults were terrestrial. They ranged from lizard-sized creatures (30 centimeters) to crocodile-sized 150 centimeter long animals. They were reptile-like. If seymouriamorphs are reptiliomorphs, they were the distant relatives of amniotes. Seymouriamorphs form into three main groups, Kotlassiidae, Discosauriscidae, and Seymouriidae, a group that includes the best known genus, Seymouria.

It has 10,964 inhabitants (2005). Geography =Geographical location= Laichingen is located on the Laichingen Alb, a branch of the Swabian Jura. It is located on a former volcanic vent on the Alb plateau, about 25 kilometers west of Ulm. Neighboring communities The municipality borders to Hohenstadt in Göppingen district, in the east to Merklingen and Dornstadt, on the south to Berghülen, to the town Blaubeuren and Heroldstatt and on the west to Gutsbezirk Münsingen and to Römerstein, both in the district of Reutlingen and to Westerheim. History In 1364 offered Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor the town privileges to the population, these however rejected, allegedly because they did not want to build any walls. The tradition of Laichingen linen weaving goes back until the Middle Ages. The poor soils on the Alb gave only small harvests, and so the inhabitants have relied on the growing of flax and the trade with the town of Ulm. One of the in 1677 built weber houses stood in Laichingen till 2002. It was dismantled and rebuilt and can now be visited in the open air museum in Beuren. From 1871, the water supply for the Swabian Jura was planned and built, also Laichingen was connected. Laichingen came to the Münsingen district in 1938. In 1945 the town became part of the French occupation zone and in 1947, it was assigned to the newly founded state of Württemberg- Hohenzollern, which was incorporated in the state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952. In 1950, Laichingen received again the town privileges. In the course of the reform of the municipal area in Baden-Württemberg, Suppingen on January 1, 1972, Feldstetten and Machtolsheim on January 1, 1975 were became parts of the city of Laichingen. Laichingen is the largest suburb of the city.

In the period after the Second World War, the consequences of the war were still very noticeable. Many of the Laichingen companies were used during the war for making war necessary materials. After the war six companies of Laichingen were authorized by the American military government to resume their production. So many looms were rebuilt and put into operation. With the currency reform the windows of the shops were filled and also Laichingen textile industry could benefit. The demand for textiles rose after the war enormously, especially bed linen was now in demand. This led to a veritable boom in this industry. In 1948, all companies were fully occupied in Laichingen and then followed from 1950 to 1960, a wave of start-ups, because everyone wanted to participate in the upswing. Over the next 10 years, many textiles were produced in Laichingen. =Transportation= The public transport is guaranteed by the Donau-Iller-Nahverkehrsverbund.

As a composer his most enduring work is his chamber music which has earned him a central place in the Italian instrumental renaissance of the 19th century. However, his success as a composer was overshadowed by his reputation as one of the finest concert violinists of the nineteenth century. He also contributed to a portion of Messa per Rossini, specifically the first section of II. Sequentia, Dies Irae. Biography Portrait of Antonio Bazzini Bazzini was born at Brescia. As a young boy, he was a pupil of Faustino Camisani. At 17 he was appointed organist of a church in his native town. The following year he met Paganini and became completely influenced by that master's art and style. Paganini encouraged Bazzini to begin his concert career that year and he quickly became one of the most highly regarded artists of his time. From 1841 to 1845 he lived in Germany, where he was much admired by Schumann both as a violinist and a composer, as well as by Mendelssohn (Bazzini gave the first private performance of his Violin Concerto). After a short stay in Denmark in 1845, Bazzini returned to Brescia to teach and compose. In 1846 he played in Naples and Palermo. In 1849–1850 he toured Spain and from 1852 to 1863 lived in Paris. He ended his concert career with a tour of the Netherlands in 1864. Returning once more to Brescia, Bazzini devoted himself to composition, gradually abandoning the virtuoso opera fantasias and character-pieces, which had formed a large part of his earlier work. He composed an opera Turanda in 1867, and produced a number of dramatic cantatas, sacred works, concert overtures, and symphonic poems over the next two decades. However, his greatest success as a composer was with his chamber music compositions. In 1868, he became president of the Società dei Concerti in Brescia, and was active in promoting and composing for quartet societies in Italy. In 1873, he became composition professor at the Milan Conservatory, where he taught Catalani, Mascagni, and Puccini, and later became the director in 1882. Bazzini died in Milan on 10 February 1897. =Music= Bazzini was one of the most highly regarded artists of his time and influenced the great opera composer Giacomo Puccini. His most enduring work is his chamber music, which is written in the classic forms of the German school and has earned him a central place in the Italian instrumental renaissance of the 19th century. Of particular note is his String Quartet No. 1, which won the Milan Quartet Society's first prize in 1864. His music is characterized by a highly virtuosic technique that is expressive without too much sentiment. Bazzini played a violin by Giuseppe Guarneri, which after his death passed to M. Soldat-Roeger. Artists who have recorded his music include Chloë Hanslip. But several far better-known virtuoso violinists have distinguished themselves by undertaking to record his fiendishly difficult La ronde des lutins (or Dance of the Goblins, with its extended passages of rapid double stops, artificial harmonics in double stops (using all four left fingers) and left-hand pizzicato . These include Bronislaw Huberman, Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin, David Garrett, James Ehnes, and Itzhak Perlman. =Selected works= Chamber music * The Dance of the Goblins (La Ronde des Lutins), Scherzo fantastique, Op. 25 (1852) * String Quartet No. 1 in C major, WoO, (1864) * String Quartet No. 2 in D minor, Op. 75 (1877) * String Quartet No. 3 in E flat major, Op. 76 (1878) * String Quartet No. 4 in G major, Op. 79 (1888) * String Quartet No. 5 in C minor, Op. 80 (1891) * String Quartet No. 6 in F major, Op. 82 (1892) * String Quintet in A major for 2 violins, viola and 2 cellos, WoO.

From the collection of the Minnesota Historical Society. Frances Louisa Clayton (c. 1830 – after 1863), also recorded as Frances Clalin, was an American woman who purportedly disguised herself as a man to fight for the Union Army in the American Civil war. Under the alias Jack Williams, she claimed to have enlisted in a Missouri regiment along with her husband, and fought in several battles. She claimed that she left the army soon after her husband died at Stones River. Newspaper reports indicate that Clayton served in both cavalry and artillery units. Her story became known and widely circulated after her service, though each account contains contradictory, and in some cases dubious, information about her life and supposed service. Several photographs of Clayton, including images of her in uniform, are known to exist. However, little else is known of her life and no official military record exists of her service.; Record Group 94, Compiled Service Records of Volunteer Union Soldiers, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC. Frances Clayton in women's clothing, photographed by Samuel Masury ca. 1865. From the Library of Congress. Biography Clayton and her husband were from Minnesota. Her husband's name is not clear; one newspaper story gives it as Frank Clayton, apparently a confusion of Frances' own name, while other sources name him John or Elmer. Following the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the Claytons decided to enlist in the Union Army, with Frances disguising herself as a man named Jack Williams. By most accounts, they enlisted in a Missouri unit in Saint Paul, Minnesota, despite being from Minnesota. Clayton is said to have fought in 18 battles. Sources from after the war record her as serving in both cavalry and artillery units, and indicate that she was wounded in battle; according to her subsequent statements this occurred at the Battle of Fort Donelson. The same accounts describe her as a \\"very tall, masculine looking woman bronzed by exposure\\". She was further able to convincingly pass as a man through her \\"masculine stride in walking\\" and \\"erect and soldierly carriage\\", as well as by adopting male vices such as drinking, smoking, chewing tobacco, swearing, and gambling. In the service, she became an \\"accomplished horse-man\\" and a \\"capital swordsman\\". She was reported to have fought in the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862. In December 1862, she fought in the Battle of Stones River, where her husband was killed during a charge. The news stories reported that she did not stop fighting, and stepped over his body to continue the charge. Clayton's story only became known after her service and was reported in several newspaper stories, though these accounts all contain contradictory information. According to these stories, Clayton was discharged in Louisville in 1863, shortly after her husband's death. She told reporters that she was never discovered as a woman. Sources say, however, that her discharge resulted from her being medically examined after a bullet wound to the hip. She attempted to return to Minnesota before going back to the military to collect her and her husband's back pay, but her train was ambushed by Confederate guerrillas who took her money and papers. Thereafter, she traveled from Missouri to Minnesota, to Grand Rapids, Michigan, and finally to Quincy, Illinois, where a collection was held to help her on her trip. The last known report describes her heading to Washington, D.C.. Several photographs of Frances Clayton are known to exist. Two were taken in Boston and are now in the possession of the Boston Public Library. One shows Clayton in women's clothing, while the other depicts her in uniform. Unlike other women of the Civil War, Clayton was described by newspapers as tall and masculine-looking. She frequently took part in soldierly past-times such as drinking, smoking, or chewing tobacco.  Legacy and Controversy  The series of photos of Clayton, taken in Boston at S. Masury’s studio, has become the most well-known images of a female Civil War soldier. However, the only knowledge of Clayton’s story beyond these photos is her own words as told through a few periodical articles from 1863, primarily the short-lived Philadelphia political pamphlet, \\"Fincher's Trades' Review.\\" Those stories are fraught with inconsistencies.Blanton, D., and Lauren Cook, They Fought Like Demons: Women Soldiers in the American Civil War. (Baton Rouge, LSU Press, 2002), 149-150. Of the units in which she was purported to have served, one did not exist (4th Missouri Heavy Artillery), and the other did not come into existence until after her supposed military service concluded (13th Missouri Cavalry). Neither, of course, was engaged at Stones River, and certainly no cavalry unit participated in a bayonet charge as the story claims.Dyer, Frederick. A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion: Compiled and Arranged from Official Records of the Federal and Confederate Armies, Reports of the Adjutant Generals of the Several States, the Army Registers, and Other Reliable Documents and Sources. (Des Moines, Dyer Publishing Company, 1908). None of the military units in which Clayton claimed to have served contain any record of a Jack Williams, or her husband, or any possible derivation of their names. There are no records in any Missouri or Minnesota unit that match. No Frank (or Elmer, or John) Clayton (or Clalin, or Claylin) was killed at Stones River. The files of the War Department at the National Archives contain no discharge or hospital records.Record Group 94, Compiled Service Records of Volunteer Union Soldiers, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington, DC. It is possible that Frances Clayton simply fabricated her story and posed in a photographer's prop uniform (to include a non-standard infantry jacket and officer's sword) in an effort profit from the war via donations and a fraudulent pension application. Clayton and her story served as an inspiration to Beth Gilleland, who produced a 1996 play Civil Ceremony.

Biography Born in Milan, Risi graduated in medicine, as did his brother Dino, then with the outbreak of the Second World War he fought on the Russian front and was interned in Switzerland. He started his poetical production in 1941, with the collection Le opere e i giorni. With the end of the war he moved to Paris where he joined a group of filmmakers, led by the Americans Richard Leacock and John Ferno, engaged in documenting the disaster of the war in Europe through a series of human-geography documentary films. During this time Risi also published his second collection of poems (L'esperienza, 1948) and worked as a translator of poetry works by Pierre Jean Jouve, Constantine P. Cavafy, Sophocles, Jules Laforgue and others. Back in Italy in 1954 he directed a dozen documentary films on popular figures and moments in the history of the twentieth century. He made his feature film debut in 1961, with a segment of the film Le italiane e l'amore; the same year he started his long collaboration with RAI TV. During his film career Risi won two Silver Ribbons, in 1960 for the direction of the short film The Brothers Rosselli (1959) and in 1970 for the screenplay of Diary of a Schizophrenic Girl. In 1970 he also won the Viareggio Prize for his poetry collection Di certe cose che dette in versi suonano meglio che in prosa. His poetry style is referred as \\"poetics of the usual\\" (\\"poetica dell'usuale\\"), in reference of the attempt of grasping the contradictions and the mystifications of everyday life through a basic, simple language, close to a diaristic style.

A right fielder and a powerful left-handed hitter, Kirkland appeared in 1,149 games in Major League Baseball over nine seasons for the San Francisco Giants (1958–1960), Cleveland Indians (1961–1963), Baltimore Orioles (1964) and Washington Senators (1964–1966). He also spent six seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball as a member of the Hanshin Tigers during his 20-year pro career. Born in Siluria, Alabama, he grew up in Detroit. Baseball career Kirkland signed with the New York Giants in 1952 upon his graduation from Detroit's Northwestern High School. He threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed . A prodigious minor-league slugger, he rose through the organization over his first four seasons, three times exceeding the 35-home run mark, and winning a batting title and runs batted in championship on the way. Kirkland then spent all of 1957 in the military. When he mustered out of the service in , he became a member of the MLB Giants during their first season in San Francisco. He won the regular right field job and appeared in the team's first-ever official game on the West Coast: an 8–0 thrashing of the Los Angeles Dodgers at Seals Stadium on April 15. Batting cleanup, behind Willie Mays, the 24-year-old rookie collected a single and an RBI in five at bats.Retrosheet box score: 1958-04-15 Kirkland was part of a flood of young players who joined the Giants during their maiden years in San Francisco (others included Felipe Alou, Orlando Cepeda, Jim Davenport, Juan Marichal, Willie McCovey and Leon Wagner), and he went on to hold the Giants' regular right-field job for three seasons, through , belting 57 home runs and hitting .261.

Kirkland took over as the Indians' starting right-fielder in , and led the team in homers (27) and runs batted in (95), hitting .259. But while Kirkland hit 21 homers for the Indians, tied for second on the club, his batting average plummeted to .200. Then, in , Kirkland shuttled between center field and right field, hitting only 15 homers while batting .230. He was traded to the Orioles during the off-season, where he batted .200 in 66 games and was sold to the second-division Senators in August. He spent the rest of his major-league career with Washington as a backup outfielder before he was assigned outright to the Triple-A Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League. Over his nine MLB seasons, Kirkland posted a .240 batting average with 148 home runs and 509 RBI. His 837 hits also included 134 doubles and 29 triples. Kirkland's year in Hawaii began the last chapter of his pro career. He smashed 34 home runs for the 1967 Islanders, then began his career in Japanese baseball the following season.

A non-deterministic system may not select the same outcome every time it is applied to the same set of ballots, so non- deterministic systems are rarely suggested for public elections. Tactical voting is where voters do not vote in accordance with their true preferences, but instead vote insincerely in an attempt to influence the result. Runoff voting is intended as a method that reduces tactical voting, but two tactics called compromising and pushover are still possible in many circumstances. In particular voters are strongly encouraged to compromise by voting for one of the three leading candidates in the first round of an election. Strategic nomination is where candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. Runoff is intended to reduce the spoiler effect, but it does not eliminate it. A famous example of the importance of both strategic nomination and tactical voting in runoff voting was the 2002 French presidential election. Sample election For illustrative purposes, the following is a sample election that does not involve any tactical manipulation. Imagine an election to choose which food to eat for dessert. There are 100 people having dessert and three candidates: Ice Cream, Apple Pie and Fruit. Runoff voting is used to find the winner. Round 1: In the first round of voting each diner votes for the one candidate they most prefer. The results are as follows: *Ice Cream: 43 votes *Apple Pie: 16 votes *Fruit: 41 votes Round 2: No candidate has an absolute majority of votes (in this election that would be 51) so the two candidates with the most votes, Ice Cream and Fruit, proceed to a second round, while Apple Pie is eliminated. Because their favourite candidate has been eliminated Apple Pie supporters must now vote for one of the two remaining candidates. The Apple Pie supporters split into two even groups: 8 vote for Ice Cream and 8 for Fruit. Of those who supported Ice Cream and Fruit in the first round, no one decides to change their vote. The results of the second round are, therefore, as follows: *Ice Cream: 51 *Fruit: 49 Result: Ice Cream now has an absolute majority so is declared the winner. Tactical voting Runoff voting attempts to reduce the potential for tactical voting by eliminating wasted votes. Under the first past the post (plurality) system, voters are indirectly encouraged to vote tactically by voting only for one of the two leading candidates, as a vote for any other candidate will not affect the result. Under runoff voting this tactic, known as compromising, is sometimes unnecessary because, even if a voter's favourite candidate is eliminated in the first round, she will still have an opportunity to influence the result of the election by voting for a more popular candidate in the second round. However, the tactic of compromising can still be used in runoff voting because it is sometimes necessary to compromise as a way of influencing which two candidates will survive to the second round. =Compromise= Compromising is where a voter gives a first or other preference to a candidate, not because they necessarily support them, but as a way of avoiding the election of a candidate who they dislike even more. The compromising tactic is sometimes effective because runoff voting eliminates many candidates in the first round, and these often include a candidate who might have received an absolute majority of votes had the candidate been permitted to participate in the second round. This creates strong incentives for voters to vote tactically in the first round to ensure that at least one of the two candidates who survives to the second round is acceptable to them. To do this, it is necessary to vote for one of the three leading candidates in the first round, just as in an election held under the plurality system it is necessary to vote for one of the two leading candidates. Whether or not compromising will be an effective tactic depends on the precise candidates and voting patterns present in each election. For example, if there are two very popular centrist candidates standing in the election, such that the outcome of the first round is inevitable, then compromise will be unnecessary. Examples In Example I above, if Fruit supporters had voted tactically for Apple Pie in the first round then Apple Pie (their second choice) would have been elected instead of Icecream (their last choice). By voting tactically, they ensure that Apple Pie has the opportunity to advance to the second round, Apple Pie is then able to achieve an absolute majority. However in the following election compromising is unnecessary; in the first round 100 voters vote as follows: *Far-Left candidate: 10 *Centre-Left candidate: 41 *Centre-Right candidate: 40 *Far- Right candidate: 9 If the second preference of Far-Left voters is the Centre- Left candidate, and the second preference of Far-Right voters is the Centre- Right candidate, the result of the second round will be as follows: *Centre- Left candidate: 51 *Centre-Right candidate: 49 In this election, once the Far- left Candidate is eliminated, the supporters have the opportunity to vote for the Centre-Left candidate in the second round; thus it is unnecessary and ineffective for Far-Left supporters to vote tactically for the Centre-Left candidate. For the same reason, the outcome will not be altered if Far-Right supporters vote tactically in the first round for Centre-Right. Were the election conducted using the plurality system, compromising would be effective. For example, if Far-Right supporters voted tactically for Centre- Right then he would be elected instead of Centre-Left. To counteract this tactic Far-Left supporters would also have to vote tactically. In this example, therefore, runoff voting removes the potential for tactical voting that would be there under the plurality system. =Push over= Pushover is a tactic by which voters vote tactically for an unpopular pushover candidate in the first round to help their true favourite candidate win in the second round. The purpose of voting for the pushover is to ensure that it is this weak candidate, rather than a stronger rival, who remains to challenge a voter's preferred candidate in round two. By supporting a pushover candidate, it is hoped to eliminate a stronger candidate who might have won the second round. The pushover tactic requires voters to be able to predict, reliably, how others will vote. It runs the risk of backfiring, as if the tactical voter miscalculates, the candidate intended as a pushover might end up actually beating the voter's preferred candidate in the second round. =Example= Imagine an election, like the one at the start of this article, in which there are 100 voters who vote as follows: *Ice cream: 25 votes *Apple Pie: 30 votes *Fruit: 45 votes No candidate has an absolute majority of votes so Ice cream is eliminated in the first round. Ice cream supporters prefer Apple Pie to Fruit so in the second round they vote for Apple Pie and Apple Pie is the winner. However, if only six Fruit supporters had used the tactic of pushover, they could have changed this outcome and ensured the election of Fruit. These six voters can do this by voting for Ice cream in the first round as a pushover. If they do this then the votes cast in the first round will look like this: *Ice cream: 31 *Apple Pie: 30 *Fruit: 39 This will mean that Apple Pie is eliminated in the first round instead of Ice cream. This outcome is deliberate. The tactical voters know that Ice cream will be an easier candidate for Fruit to beat in the second round than Apple Pie. In the second round the tactical voters vote for their real first preference, Fruit. Thus, even if only 6 Apple Pie supporters prefer Fruit to Icecream, the result of the second round will be as follows: *Icecream: 49 *Fruit: 51 Fruit will be elected. The success of this tactic relies on the Fruit supporters being able to predict that Ice cream can be beaten by Fruit in the second round. If a large majority of Apple Pie supporters had voted for Ice cream then the pushover tactic would have backfired, leading to the election of Ice cream, which Fruit partisans like even less than Apple Pie. Strategic nomination Runoff voting can be influenced by strategic nomination; candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. Runoff voting is vulnerable to strategic nomination for the same reasons that it is open to the voting tactic of compromising. This is because it is sometimes necessary for a candidate who knows they are unlikely to win to ensure that another candidate he supports makes it to the second round by withdrawing from the race before the first round occurs, or by never choosing to stand in the first place. By withdrawing candidates a political faction can avoid the spoiler effect, whereby a candidate splits the vote of her supporters and prevents any candidate acceptable to them from surviving to the last round. Runoff voting's system of two rounds makes it less vulnerable to the spoiler effect than the plurality system. This is because a potential spoiler candidate often has only minor support so that candidate will not take away sufficient support from any candidate likely to win in the second round to prevent the other candidate from surviving to that point. Voters can counteract the effect of vote splitting in the first round, in the two-round system, by using the compromise tactic. The spoiler effect is impossible in the second round because there are only two candidates. Because it is vulnerable to certain forms of strategic nomination, IRV is said by electoral scientists to fail the independence of irrelevant alternatives criterion. This criterion is so strict that it is failed by almost all voting systems, even those that are less susceptible to strategic nomination than runoff voting. 2002 French presidential election The 2002 French presidential election is a famous example of the importance of both tactical voting and strategic nomination in runoff voting. The three main candidates were Jacques Chirac of the centre-right, Lionel Jospin of the centre-left, and the far-right Jean- Marie Le Pen. However there were sixteen candidates in total. In French presidential elections, the usual outcome is for one candidate of the centre- right and one of the centre-left to proceed to the second round. However, in 2002, the two candidates to advance to the second round were Chirac and Le Pen. Chircac then won the election but the inclusion of Le Pen in the second round was highly controversial, because of what many considered his 'extreme' political views. Le Pen was an unpopular candidate, as testified by the fact that he won only 18% of the vote in the second round. Had Jospin proceeded to the second round, as expected, it would have been a closer contest. In the first round the results were as follows: The right *Jacques Chirac (Rally for the Republic): 19.88% *Jean-Marie Le Pen (National Front): 16.86% *François Bayrou (Union for French Democracy): 6.84% *Alain Madelin (Liberal Democracy): 3.91% *Bruno Mégret (National Republican Movement): 2.34% *Christine Boutin (Forum of Social Republicans): 1.19% *Total: 51.02% The left *Lionel Jospin (Socialist Party): 16.18% *Arlette Laguiller (Workers' Struggle) 5.72% *Noël Mamère (The Greens) 5.25% *Olivier Besancenot (Revolutionary Communist League) 4.25% *Robert Hue (French Communist Party) 3.37% *Christiane Taubira (Left Radical Party) 2.32% *Daniel Gluckstein (Party of the Workers) 0.47% *Total: 37.56% The reason that the left had no candidate in the second round was not a shortage of voters. As can be seen above, more than 37% of voters supported left-wing candidates. The problem was that the left-wing vote was split between seven different candidates. The left could have improved its performance using strategic nomination. If even a small left-wing party had withdrawn its candidate, Jospin might have had enough votes to avoid elimination. On the other hand, even with seven different candidates, left- wing voters could have altered the first round by voting tactically. If only about 2% more left-wing voters had practiced the tactic of compromise and voted for Jospin rather than their true favourite, then he would have survived elimination. One reason that Jospin was eliminated was that many voters assumed that he would survive to the second round and so felt free to cast a protest vote for a minor candidate, rather than vote tactically. Had Jospin survived, by tactical voting or strategic nomination, it is possible he could have won the second round and beaten Chirac. A similar situation occurred in Louisiana, which uses a form of runoff voting called the run-off primary election. In 1991, white supremacist David Duke secured enough votes to be admitted to the second round, in place of the incumbent governor, who would have been expected to survive. In the second round Duke lost to the more moderate Edwin Edwards.

The underlying software providing the biometrics was developed by Digital Persona. Fingerprint readers are more secure, reliable and convenient than a normal traditional password, although they have been subject to spoofing. A fingerprint recognition system is more tightly linked to a specific user than, e.g., an access card, which can be stolen.  History  First released on September 4 2004, this device was supported by Windows XP and Windows Vista x86 operating systems. It was discontinued shortly after Windows Vista was released. Functionality The Fingerprint Reader's software allows the registration of up to ten fingerprints per device. Login names and passwords associated with the registered fingerprints were stored in a database on the user's computer. On presentation of an authorized fingerprint, the software passes the associated login names and passwords to compatible applications and websites, allowing login without a keyboard. If the software finds that the particular fingerprint does not match one it its database, it declines the access.

This tendency is at the heart of the third-person effect, a phenomenon first defined and investigated by Davison (1983). Since then, much research has born out Davidson’s (1983) statement that “in the view of those trying to evaluate the effects of communication, its greatest impact will not be on “me” or “you,” but on “them”—the third persons.” Although “me” and “you” are put in one category, it is implied that some degree of distance exists between self and such close others as friends and lovers (Tsfati & Cohen, 2004). More explicit remoteness exists between “me” and ”you” as a single unit and “them,” or others. Social distance The notion of social distance was first introduced by the sociologist Emory Bogardus (1925), who referred to it as the degrees of understanding and feeling that people experience regarding each other. Considering the social distance phenomenon an aspect of Davison’s (1983) third-person perception, Perloff (1993) articulated it as a complex variable including perceived similarity, familiarity, and identification, and pointed that there are at least two different ways to conceptualize social distance. First, social distance is a continuum going from “just like me” to “not at all like me.” Second, social distance reflects the heterogeneity and size of the audience. Perloff (1993), reviewing 16 studies of the third-person effect, acknowledged that the phenomenon is magnified when the hypothetical others are defined in broad terms. Thus, in Perloff’s (2002) terms, social distance corollary is “the notion that self-other disparities grow in magnitude with increases in perceived distance between self and comparison others.” The social distance corollary is not dependent on whether there are media effects or not; rather, it is a perceptual phenomenon. To measure estimates of effects on self and others, Brosius and Engel (1996) constructed a questionnaire comprising three independent variables: First person; Third person, close distance; and Third person, remote distance. In other words, Brosius and Engel varied psychological distance and found that perceived effects were greater for “remote” others. Also it was found that third-person effects reveal itself most strongly among people of higher age and education. Cohen, Mutz, Price, and Gunther (1988) found that Stanford students perceived media effects to be less on themselves than on other Stanford students; also, other Californians were considered to be more susceptible to media impact than “other Stanford students.” A similar study (Gunther, 1991) was done at the University of Minnesota, and the social distance phenomenon was supported. As groups became more broadly defined (other University of Minnesota students, other Minnesota residents), participants’ perception of media effects on the groups increased. Investigating the third-person effect in regard to political identification, Duck, Hogg, and Terry (1995) found that perception of self-other differences in media vulnerability are influenced by the subjectively salient social relationship between self and other, and are governed by motivational needs, such as self-esteem, social-identity, and differentiation from others. Other researchers (e.g., Burger, 1981; Schlenker & Miller, 1977) suggested that self-serving biases consider close friends and relatives as an extension of self, whereas such a vague category as “other” might evoke stereotypes in people’s minds (Perloff & Fetzer, 1986). After several studies, the notion of social distance was enshrined as the “social distance corollary” (Meirick, 2005). According to Perloff’s review (1999), of the 11 studies that have tested the social-distance notion, 9 confirmed it, articulating this phenomenon as “another factor on which the strength of the third-person effect hinges.” References * Bogardus, E.

The series takes place in a dark fantasy setting loosely based on medieval Europe. Berserk centers on the life of Guts, a lone mercenary warrior, and Griffith, the leader of a mercenary band called the who made a pact with demons and is reborn as one himself. Principal characters =Guts= is the series' main protagonist. In the series, Guts is a mercenary who travels from company to company so he is always fighting. After meeting Griffith, Guts is defeated in battle by Griffith and is forced to join the Band of the Hawk. Guts has also appeared in every Berserk video game. Guts is a Byronic hero who is born as one who may be able to struggle against causality, but who is unable to maintain it indefinitely. His childhood and adolescence is defined by his growing up in a mercenary band after being adopted by a motherly prostitute named Shisu and later the band's leader Gambino, and his later joining of, and departure from, the Band of the Hawk. The dynamic and turbulent relationship between Guts and Griffith, the leader of the Band of the Hawk, forms the primary focus of the manga for the first thirteen volumes. After the events of the Eclipse, during which he loses his left forearm and right eye, Guts seeks revenge on Griffith, who is now Femto. In the process, he is reunited with Casca after a separation of two years. Following the Incarnation Ceremony at Albion, Guts travels with a new group of companions. Guts can be seen as the exact opposite of Griffith in just about every way. In appearance, he is a tall, muscular warrior with short black hair, a body full of scars and wields a monstrous weapon while dressed in cursed armor, whereas the latter is of average height, thin, has long white hair, no physical scars and wields a delicate sabre. Guts wears tattered black clothing and, though incredibly skilled, fights like a barbarian; winning by any means necessary. Griffith wears white armor and has a much more refined style resembling fencing. In addition they usually have the exact opposite effect on everyone they meet. Most people are naturally drawn to Griffith upon first meeting him and would die for him without hesitation whereas Guts is usually feared and detested by just about everyone he comes across until they get to know him, after which he will usually end up being revered as a hero by those same people. This extends to their morals and actions as well. Guts maintains the image of a callous warrior who manages to protect the people around him while Griffith puts up a somewhat idealistic facade but is also willing to sacrifice anybody without exception to further his ultimate goal. And while Guts unhesitatingly chooses to battle his way through enemies, Griffith refrains from excessive participation in combat, preferring to manipulate anyone in his way. IGN ranked him as the 22nd best anime character in 2014. Characteristics Guts is depicted as a tall, muscular man, standing at 6'0\\" (1.85 cm)2016 Berserk Official Guidebook with short, spiked, black hair in a crew cut. He is missing his left forearm and right eye due to an encounter with the God Hand and is covered head-to-toe in scars, with the most notable being a lacerated scar on his nose. Also notable is a large, horizontal scar on his chest which he received during his encounter with Slan in Qliphoth.Miura, Kentaro; Berserk vol. 26, p 65. Digital Manga Publishing, 2008. After receiving the Berserker Armor, a part of Guts' fringe turns white, an after-effect from wielding the cursed Berserker armor for the first time. Guts' tendency to wear black clothing and armor while hunting the Apostles gained him the nickname 'The Black Swordsman.' Aside of all this, Guts has a brand on the back right side of his neck that attracts demons and evil spirits to him at night, as a result of the Eclipse. Guts' original design, featured in the Berserk Prototype, had him wearing an eye patch. Because he is just a normal human, the strength to carry, much less wield a sword of such magnitude with finesse and dexterity shows Guts to be a master swordsman of extraordinary skill, as shown in every battle or duel in which he fights, especially when he is engaged with demonic beings. He is also adept at using many kinds of bladed weapons, has knowledge of the mechanisms of firearms, and is also an excellent equestrian. Despite his large frame he is very fast, dexterous and agile for a human of his size and stature which can be seen when he is engaged in combat with multiple enemies. Guts’ fighting is characterized by controlled rage, enabling him to overcome difficult odds. Guts' ferocity and strength do much to conceal the cunning person within him, and he is shown to be very perceptive, quick-witted, and clever. He is also a skilled strategist, which further enhances his already immense fighting ability. These attributes have all contributed to his survival in the countless battles he has fought. A good example of his tactical prowess is his fight with the apostle Rosine. During the fight, Guts was greatly outnumbered by Rosine's demon elves but managed to kill them by lighting himself on fire when they got too close then quickly dousing himself by slicing open the cocoons that were in the process of turning more children into elves. Although not much of a talker, Guts is also shown to possess astute logical reasoning which can be seen in some of his conversations within the manga. Equipment As a youth, Guts lived in a mercenary camp where he was forced to learn to use full sized weapons. This and his natural physical size and strength enabled him to wield larger weapons than most. Throughout the Golden Age arc, he primarily uses a variety of large swords, along with various other weapons when necessary. In the (chronologically) later arcs, Guts wields the Dragonslayer, a zweihänder or two-handed sword about 6'6\\" long and 12\\" wide at its base. It is more than an inch thick at the middle of the blade, giving it incredible weight and power. Described in the manga as more of a table-sized slab of iron than a blade, the Dragonslayer's massive size makes it the ideal weapon for slaying apostles of the God Hand. The blade itself was forged by the master blacksmith Godo who, tired of making ornate ceremonial weapons for nobles, decided to take a nobleman's request for a sword capable of slaying a dragon literally out of spite. After killing many apostles, the sword retains properties of the apostles' blood, making it more effective against them. In addition to his blade, Guts' left forearm is prosthetic with a magnet to help grip weapons, a replacement for the one he lost when Griffith attempted to sacrifice him to the denizens of hell; it folds back to expose a hidden cannon within. Guts also carries throwing knives, miniature bombs, a dagger, and even a repeating crossbow that can be mounted onto his prosthetic arm. While it was not innately magical, Guts' sword, the Dragonslayer, was recently shown to have become a cursed blade after bathed in the blood of so many apostles, even a member of the God Hand; which made it more efficient against creatures of a non-corporeal or astral nature and even possibly kill, or at least, seriously injure members of the God Hand. One of Guts' most powerful assets is the Berserker Armor, an ancient, cursed suit of armor forged by dwarves that allows the wearer to overcome their physical and mental limitations in combat but at the risk of damaging their already-weakened body and allowing his inner Beast, in Guts' case a feral dog-like creature, to take over and endanger everyone in the vicinity, friend or foe (hence, berserk). The Armor has deadly effects on its user. After using the armor once, Guts lost some of his sense of taste, became slightly color-blind, and the stress of using it caused a patch of his hair to turn white, among other things. The armor can pierce his flesh from within (similar to an Iron Maiden) to reinforce broken bones, enabling him to continue fighting long after his body is broken to the point of exsanguination. When the armor is deactivated, all of the damage done to his body is felt, and the pain caused by it becomes apparent. Abilities Guts has incredible strength and physical resilience, even though he is a mortal human with no supernatural powers. Due to his extensive training since a very young age, his strength and endurance is practically superhuman. He is able to swing his massive Dragonslayer sword with incredible speed, even with just one hand. He has also survived numerous impacts that would kill a regular man, even without the protection of armour. This might be due to The Brand, which, according to the Skull Knight, places Guts a half step outside of reality, where it is easier for will to affect reality. It is also noted that the Hellhound, Guts' inner beast, devours the souls of the apostles and other malignant spirits that assault him daily from the Interstice (a realm existing between the astral plane and physical reality), increasing its power along with Guts'. Guts' most powerful ability, however, is his mysterious immunity to the concept of fate, allowing him to do impossible things through sheer willpower. It could be said that he has incredibly high pain tolerance, but it is more likely the case that his overwhelming will and rage drives him to continue fighting at an exceptional level in spite of pain. He is able to come up with strategies very quickly and, thanks to his experience in battle, can quickly adapt and improvise to various situations, such as when he used a sword with his feet to impale Zodd. =Griffith= is the series' main antagonist (and early on, romantic hero). He is originally the founding leader of the mercenary unit known as the Band of the Hawk, both the group and his title \\"White Hawk\\" named for his helmet forged in the shape of a Hawk's head. Extraordinarily charismatic, intelligent, handsome, and ambitious, Griffith's skill with his sabre and tactics gave him and his band a reputation of invincibility, making him the favored choice of the Midland King, who was locked in a century long war with the Empire of Tudor. Believing that he is destined for greater things, Griffith is willing to sacrifice everything for the dream of his own kingdom and only values others who are of use to him. The source of his ambition is a Crimson Behelit given to him by a fortune teller who claims it to be an \\"Egg of the King\\" that would lead an average person to become a great ruler. The only two people Griffith truly trusted were Guts and Casca, who were his confidants in private moments. There are several hints in the series that Griffith has feelings for Guts, expressing an obsessive want for the swordsman's strength as he bested him in a duel to force his servitude. When the Hundred Year War ended, Griffith learned of Guts's intention to leave the Band of the Hawk and resolves to kill his friend if he cannot keep him by his side. But Guts instantly defeats Griffith in their second duel by breaking his sabre, leaving Griffith in disbelief with his morale crushed. Later that night, Griffith coldly seduces Princess Charlotte and is later discovered, leading to his imprisonment and torture by the Midland King who labels his group wanted criminals. A year later, now a broken and hateful shell of his former self, Griffith is rescued by Casca, Guts, Judeau, and Pippin. After Wyald's attack and the further realization of his current state from a year of crippling torture, Griffith triggered the Crimson Behelit in an act of desperation. Griffith and the Hawks are drawn into an Interstice known as the Nexus where the God Hand offer him a position among them if he sacrifices his followers to the apostles that have gathered for the Eclipse. With Ubik's powers convincing him that a few more deaths will not matter as long as he fulfills his dream, Griffith agrees to the God Hand's terms and transcends into an incorporeal demon in dark hawk armor with cape- like wings. Rechristened , no longer bound by human ties and seeing the destiny laid before him by the Idea of Evil, Griffith rapes Casca as an act of malevolence towards Guts with his seed mutating her unborn child as part of a grand design to regain corporeal form in the physical world. Two years later, Griffith is brought back to the physical plane after The Egg of the Perfect World orchestrated the millennial Incarnation Ceremony at Albion, using the body of Casca's malformed child as a vessel with the gift of supernatural charisma in addition to other unknown abilities that include him disappearing during the night of a full moon. Griffith creates a new Band of the Hawk composed of Apostles and humans that are drawn to him as the original Hawks were, making himself the sole military leader of Midland's armies. Griffith also wins the loyalty of the Holy See, with its pontiff regarding him as the Hawk of Light incarnate and willing to oversee his marriage to Charlotte. After leading the defeat of the Kushan Empire, using Ganishka's death to establish a worldwide interstice, Griffith establishes the city of Falconia as both a haven for remaining humans and as capital of a new Midland Empire. Despite Falconia's utopian appearance, it has a strong totalitarian undercurrents from Griffith establishing himself as the unquestionable ruler of Midland with any detractors either executed by the Holy See on heresy charges or being secretly murdered by Rakshas. As Femto, Griffith is capable of flight via his wings and, like other members of the God Hand, can manipulate matter and distort space. =Casca= was the only female member in the original Band of the Hawk and is behind only Griffith and Guts in swordsmanship. Her ambivalent relationship to both of them makes her moody and capricious. Casca joins the Hawks after Griffith empowers her to save herself from a sexual assault by a nobleman who bought her from her parents, Casca having since harbors feelings towards Griffith which most of their comrades are aware of. While Casca was against Guts joining the Hawks, her hostility towards him gradually waned as she came to accept him as a comrade for saving her life multiple times while developing feelings for him. When Guts is preparing to leave the band, Casca attempts in convincing him to stay to no avail. After Griffith is imprisoned, Casca becomes the leader of the Band of the Hawk as they are forced to go into hiding after branded outlaws by Midland. After Guts returns to aid them when they are under attack, Casca falsely blames Guts for Griffith's capture and then laments her perceived failures as a leader before attempting suicide. Guts saves her yet again and the two finally consummate their mutual feelings for one another, embarking on a rescue mission to recover Griffith the following day. The rescue of Griffith is successful, but his broken spirit leads to his choice to sacrifice Hawks during the Eclipse with Casca forced to watch their comrades being slaughtered before being violated by Griffith after his rebirth as Femto. The ordeal emotionally scarred Casca as her mind broke and mentally regressed while losing all her memories as way of protecting herself from the trauma. In addition to being branded with a sacrificial mark on her breast and thus becoming a target for fell creatures on a nightly basis, Casca prematurely gives birth to her child with Guts after it has been corrupted from Griffith's rape. Casca was entrusted in Godo's care before she wandered off to St. Albion and was saved by Guts, who attempts to protect her on his own despite the more dangerous spirits that their brands together attract. Guts's attempt to protect her ultimately had him lose Casca's trust when he attacked her while under the influence of his inner darkness. As Casca travels, completely oblivious to her surroundings, Guts and company keep a close watch over her. She has put herself in grave danger many times but Guts' group has yet to fail to come to her rescue and protect her. She seems to slowly be warming up to Guts again even coming to his side when he is unconscious to watch him. Casca's well being is the driving force for Guts to keep himself from reverting to a revenge-obsessed wanderer. While outside Vritanis, the Skull Knight revealed that her mental state may be cured by the Elvish queen Hanafuku while cryptically warning Guts that \\"What [Casca] wishes for may not be what [Guts] wish[es] for\\". When Farnese and Schierke enter the world within Casca's mind as part of Hanafuku's ritual once they reach Elfhelm, the two realize that Casca did not want her mind restored as it would mean dealing with the pain from her ordeal in the Eclipse. But the two restore Casca anyway with Farnese promising to help her cope with her pain. The Band of the Hawk (Original) The original Band of the Hawk during the Golden Age arc was a group of mercenaries led by Griffith, who achieved great exploits on the battlefield during the hundred-year war. But after Griffith was rescued by his imprisonment, broken and mutilated from the year-long torture, the Hawks were offered up by their leader for the Eclipse ritual. Guts, Casca, and Rickert, the only members of the group not to be taken into the Nexus, are the sole survivors while the rest were all devoured and slaughtered by the gathered Apostles while Griffith used their souls to be reborn as Femto. =Judeau= was part of the original Band of the Hawk and was a former circus performer with a skill in knife-throwing. He was one of Griffith's best fighters, but perhaps his greatest strength came from his ability to read the emotions of others, as shown when he was the first to notice the growing bond between Guts and Casca, before either of them realized it themselves. Patient, calm, and practical, Judeau was often the voice of reason when dealing with more volatile individuals like Corkus. With his easygoing and optimistic personality, he often put the interests of his companions in the band before his own, and showed himself to be at ease with understanding matters of the heart and surmising the true intentions of those around him. Judeau himself admitted that he was pretty good at a lot of things but was not a stand-out in any of them. Throughout his tenure with the Band of the Hawk, he was also secretly in love with Casca, but never acted on it out of respect for Guts' and Casca's feelings for each other. During the Eclipse, still seeing her as their leader, Judeau attempted to help Casca escape and is killed while trying to protect her from the Apostles. =Pippin= was a massive man who wielded an equally massive mace. A former miner who lent his strength to the Band of the Hawk, his finely attuned senses, fast reactions and raw strength saved the skins of the group on many occasions, particularly when he was the first to sense the impending ambush from the Army of Midland following Griffith's capture. In spite of his intimidating physique, he had an even-tempered demeanor, shown when he kept his cool dragging a defiant Guts to the festivities, even after the latter hit him and made him bleed. Pippin was a man of few words, which, along with his appearance, might have led others to wrongly doubt his intelligence. He was often found with Rickert, with whom he seemed to share a big-brotherly relationship. During the Eclipse, he held off an Apostle to buy time for Casca and Judeau to escape. Pippin's hollowed out, lifeless corpse was seen by Guts one last time before the Count ripped the husk in half. =Corkus= was a loud-mouthed man with delusions of grandeur, and a former bandit leader before he joined the Band of the Hawk. He was the one who first tried to assault Guts in order to rob him of the money earned defeating Bazuso, but failed miserably, forcing Casca, and eventually Griffith, to intervene. Since then, Corkus held a grudge against Guts and never fully accepted him as a Hawk. Surprisingly, when Casca and Rickert blamed Guts for Griffith's capture, Corkus refused to agree with them due to his belief that they overestimated Guts' importance to the Band. Despite his outspoken attitude, he was one of the most loyal members in the Band of the Hawk. During the Eclipse, while fleeing for his life amidst the slaughter, Corkus went into denial from shock at his hellish surroundings, before being killed by a nameless female apostle who swallowed his head. Guts would later avenge Corkus when he crossed paths with the apostle at the start of the Black Swordsman arc, pretending to have fallen into her sexual trap. =Rickert= was the youngest member of the original Band of the Hawk and is one of its few surviving members, as he was not present at Griffith's rescue and the Eclipse event that followed. In the aftermath, left in the dark as to what truly happened, Rickert became an apprentice of the blacksmith Godo over the next two years while forging a sword in memory of his fallen comrades to serve as grave markers on a hill that is later called \\"The Hill of Swords\\". It is Rickert who tweaks Guts' armor and replaces his old crossbow with a repeating crossbow. When Guts confronts Griffith at the Hill of Swords, Rickert finally learns how the latter's act condemned Judeau, Pippin, and Corkus to horrible deaths while leaving Guts maimed and Casca mute and traumatized. In spite of this, Griffith offers Rickert a position in the new Band of the Hawk. After the death of Godo and the destruction of his mine by Zodd, Rickert travels with Godo's adopted granddaughter Erica to Falconia. There, despite recognizing Griffith's generosity and seeing the good he has been doing for the people, Rickert is unable to forgive him and declines his offer to join the New Band of the Hawk, telling him that the Griffith he once followed is dead. He is then attacked by Rakshas on the orders of either Griffith or Locus, though he is saved by the timely arrival of Silat and his bodyguards. In the anime, possibly due to English errors, Rickert's name is given as \\"Ricket\\", lacking the \\"R\\", and is addressed as such in the show. Guts' Party =Puck= is a Wind spirit from Elfhelm, a utopia on Skellig Island in the Western Sea. Elves in Berserk can only be seen by the open-minded; the devoutly religious cannot see Puck at all, though he can play with their face unbeknownst to them. Puck can secrete a powder from his wings to quickly heal wounds and can emit a bright flash to blind enemies. On occasion, he also resorts to his \\"Bloody Needle\\" attack, tossing a chestnut at someone. It deals no injury, but is painful enough to prompt most victims to cry out. Puck was the first to join Guts' journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count. Puck initially served as a good-natured foil to Guts during his early Black Swordsman days, but has since then been relegated to comic relief. He is often drawn in an exaggerated manner alongside Isidro in these situations, and has also developed a playful brother-sister relationship with the female elf Ivalera, who is the newest comic relief character of yet. =Farnese de Vandimion= , Erica Lindbeck (English, 2016 anime) , is a noblewoman who led the Holy See's ceremonial guard, the Holy Iron Chain Knights. Since this position has been traditionally held by a woman, Farnese was appointed during her stay at the convent she was sent to by her father, Federico de Vandimion. A bit of a pyromaniac (and possibly a pyrophiliac), Farnese's habit of impulsively burning things she didn't like, along with her unstable mentality from her poor upbringing, provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This brought about a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny. She and Serpico left their Holy See positions after her faith was shattered during the devastation of Albion and the events surrounding Griffith's reincarnation. She then chose to follow Guts in hopes of learning more about the world and has changed into a more gentle human being. Since then, Farnese has begun to study witchcraft under Schierke's tutelage. Farnese also seems to have developed a crush on Guts, though she is primarily Casca's care taker and thus rarely involves herself in battles. While given a chainmail of silver and a silver short sword for protection against creatures from the astral plane, Farnese later receives a ring that allows her to manipulate a trio of snake-like rose vines and being taught by Schierke to use magic. =Serpico= , Max Mittelman (English, 2016 anime) is Farnese's companion and unbeknownst to her, her paternal half-brother. During his time with the Holy See, Serpico was Herald for the Holy Iron Chain Knights. When aggressive, Serpico belies his meek appearance and is comparable to a fox due to his shrewd observation and speed with a rapier. Despite Farnese's childhood abuse and her forcing him to burn his own mother at the stake, he cares deeply for his half-sister. Serpico was her servant since she found him beaten on a snowy street over a decade ago. Serpico's relationship with Guts has forever been plagued with animosity, due in large part to the dangers that inevitably surround Guts and anyone he takes into his Band. After a duel with Guts in the underground pillars of Vritannis, Guts spared his life. Their bond rekindled, and Serpico has since learned to trust Guts to protect her when he can not. Serpico uses two items blessed by the wind spirit Sylph in order to battle with tolerance alongside Guts: a rapier that can generate razor sharp gusts of wind; and a cloak that constantly generates a swirling vortex around its wearer which can deflect projectiles, assist in jumping, and slow falls from great heights. =Isidro= , Erik Scott Kimerer (English, 2016 anime) A young runaway and petty thief, left home and family behind in order to become a swordsman. After Guts saves him from an attack of Kushan Bakirakas, he follows him around \\"to spy out his technique\\". Although Isidro greatly lacks in swordsman skills, he is an exceptional thrower, managing to kill two pigeons with a double-handed throw at great distance. It is suggested that he has underlying issues regarding his parents, when they are inquired about he becomes more stiff, defensive, and belligerent; or avoids the topic completely. What these issues are have yet to be revealed. He later receives from Flora the Salamander dagger, a weapon blessed by the spirits of fire which sears whatever it cuts and also receives an inherited cutlass from an old villager as a gift. He often bickers with Schierke who finds him reckless and ill-mannered. Like Puck, Isidro serves mostly as a comic relief character. He's most likely inspired by Dororo. =Schierke= , Mela Lee (English, 2016 anime) (Pronounced as Shear-keh) is a good-hearted young witch-in-training, and a disciple of the witch Flora. She is accompanied by an elf, Ivalera. She aided Guts's group with a troll infestation in the nearby village Enoch, where she showed how powerful magic can be in Berserk. After a series of events, Schierke was forced to leave her home and Flora behind forever when they faced an attack Griffith ordered. Schierke, having lived a sheltered life, doesn't like the Human world or the Holy See's religion, but she finds life outside bearable due to her companions. Her magic skills and knowledge of the world are impressive for a child her age. One of her most used and handiest spells is the ability to hypnotize or temporarily desensitize others. But due to her pivotal role in battles, she is sometimes forced to take risks and try unstable spells. Her ability to sense \\"Od\\" (life force or spirit energy) means she can sense the power, intent, and alignment of all creatures and artifacts. As she sees Isidro as an incompetent monkey, there is some friction between the two, which frequently lends itself to comic situations. Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him and both now share a sort of ersatz father-daughter relationship. When Sonia gave her an offer to join the Band of the Hawk, Schierke thought of Guts before declining. Schierke also has the ability to astral project and uses it to help Guts maintain his sanity while using the power of the Berserker Armor, the initial use moving her to tears from seeing a bit of the horror Guts suffered during the Eclipse. =Manifico de Vandimion= is the son of Federico and the brother of Farnese. Federico considers his other sons to be more competent than Manifico, and he has given Manifico the less important family duties as a result. Manifico arranged a marriage between Farnese and his friend Roderick in the hope of improving his standing. When Guts left for Elfhelm, Manifico accompanied him on board Roderick's ship with the intent to capture and breed the elves for commercial purposes. Manifico persuaded Puck to help him by offering him the crown of Elfhelm after Roderick refused to help him, his scheme later exposed and forced to do community service in Elfhelm. =Azan= is a former member of the Holy Iron Chain Knights who served as Farnese's second-in-command. He was named to this position because Farnese was not considered to be sufficiently experienced to lead without supervision. Azan appeared as a round, bald and bearded middle- aged man who conformed to the old-fashioned rules of a knight. Although possessing a hardened demeanor, he still managed to question the Holy See's appalling methods of dealing with supposed heretics. Effectively wielding a metal quarterstaff, he has shown great skill with it in combat against Guts and various other abnormally skilled or strong fighters. He also follows an uncompromising code of \\"honor\\", as seen when his fellow Holy Iron Chain Knights wanted to take revenge on an incapacitated Guts for killing their comrades, where Azan forbids them, stating that he was justified in the context of battle and their poor sword-fighting skills were instead a disgrace. Guts reveals upon their first encounter some information of Azan's former life. He earned his nickname 'The Bridge Knight' (as well as the decidedly less-savory 'Iron Staff Demon Azan') after he came across an old man defending a small bridge, harassed by bandits. He fought the bandits for hours, laughing all the while, only stopping once they retreated. This feat earned him a reputation comparable to that which Guts earned by slaying one hundred of Adon's mercenaries, but Azan had given up that title, along with his formal knighthood, when he joined the Holy Iron Chain Knights. At Albion, Azan fought alongside the surviving knights to try and hold off the hordes of crazed cultists and flesh-consuming blobs, and survived only because falling debris from the crumbling tower knocked him unconscious and buried him. He ended up going his own separate ways from then on, but later re-emerged in Vritanis where it was brought up that he was expelled from his Order (and possibly excommunicated) because of the disastrous events that took place at Albion. Presently, he accompanies Guts and company on their sea voyage, earning his spot on board by swabbing the deck, and taking some time off to train young Isidro in the ways of combat. =Roderick of Schtauffen= is the third prince of the island nation Iith, and captain of the Sea Horse. He is in a similar situation to his college friend Manifico de Vandimion in the sense that he does not get the respect he feels he deserves from his peers. As a sailor, he sees vast potential in the exploration of the seas, unlike his peers, who focus internally to the point of stagnation. As part of Manifico's plan to join the Vandimion name with the royal Iith family, Roderick agreed to be Farnese's fiancé. His obvious motivations for this arranged marriage are the vast opportunities and support the Vandimion name could bring him, but he seems to take a personal interest in the heiress as well due to her reputation. Roderick, with his long black ponytail, his good looks, and free- flowing attitude, is a superb charmer and a decent blade, and demonstrates a willingness to brave demons, even though he is ill-equipped to take them on. He is currently ferrying Guts and company aboard his ship, on their way to Skellig. Roderick and the crew of the Sea Horse also have a claim to fame on the high seas as their ship sank five Tudor vessels on its own, thus earning Roderick the title of \\"Prince of the Seas\\". =Isma= Isma a teenage girl living a solitary existence as a fisherman on a small and remote island. Although she is kind, cheerful, and energetic, she was a pariah on her island home. Her father was a human fisherman who fell in love with a merrow woman who returned to the sea just after Isma's birth, though she left a magical charm on the house to protect her daughter. Though Isma's father raised her by himself before he died when his boat capsized during a storm on sea, Isma was ostracized by the people who feared her status as the child of a merrow would invoke the Sea God's wrath. But this made Isma, who appeared human, curious of her maternal heritage and if merrows do exist. Because of this, protected from the Sea God by her mother's magic, Isma was glad to have confirmation when she meets Guts's group when they came to the island. When Isma attempts to help Guts and his group against the Sea God as it begins attacking the remaining humans on the Island, Isma learns her true name and gains the ability to assume merrow form while reunited with her mother. Once the Sea God is killed, her home destroyed In the process, Isma joins Guts's group aboard the Seahorse on their voyage to Elfhelm. Antagonists =The God Hand= Main antagonists of the series, a group of powerful entities who manipulate the world of Berserk, messengers of the Idea of Evil (an ancient being spawned from humanity's collective desire for a great evil on which they can blame their misfortune) who appear before those who activated a Behelit. Like the Apostles, all members of the were once humans who were chosen by the Idea of Evil through Crimson Behelits to serve its purpose of giving a reason for humanity's suffering. In a two hundred and sixteen-year cycle, a ritual known as the Eclipse occurs with a new member recruited, as was the case with Griffith, with a mass sacrificial offering. Unlike the Apostles who serve them, the members of the God Hand can not take a true corporeal form in the mortal plane and are forced to use rudimentary bodies for brief moments. But this can be remedied through an Incarnation Ceremony that occurs once in a millennium with the one who invoked it offering his body as a permanent vessel for a God Hand member to manifest, after offering a large amount of lives. When Griffith is successfully reconstituted in the aftermath of Albion's destruction, the rest of the God Hand were scattered across the Astral Plane. In chapter 306, the rest of the God Hand incarnatre in the aftermath of Griffith using Ganishka's defeat to remove the barriers between the mortal and astral planes. Void is a member of the God Hand with a large, exposed brain, eyes stitched shut and lips peeled back. He is the most philosophical God Hand member and is primarily concerned with analyzing and controlling the course of destiny. Void is the one who brands the sacrifices made by tortured souls in order for them to become apostles and achieve their dream. His cloak and body seem to be distorted and he has the power to open up a sort of interdimensional mirror portal at his own will. Also notable, he has six fingers on each hand. Being the oldest of the God Hand, Void has a history with the Skull Knight tied to the legend of how the first Midland empire ended. Though it is yet to be revealed who Void and the Skull Knight were at the time, the legends said that a holy man who was imprisoned in the Tower of Conviction prayed to god to send his angels to punish Gaiseric. In the TV anime, Void also has the role of narrator, introducing each episode and previewing the next. His name is borrowed from Frank Herbert's Destination: Void. Slan The sole female member of the God Hand, , also known as the Whore Princess of the Uterine Sea, takes on the form of a naked woman with black leathery wings and vine-like hair. She is a sadomasochist who thrives on cruelty and the effect it has on those who observe it. Like the other God Hand, she manipulates humanity through a pagan cult under the moniker of \\"The Goddess Of Blazes\\". She appears to have a fascination with Guts since Griffith's induction, her interest in him growing since his victory over the Count and upon the two meeting, revealed her desire to make him her sex slave. After the Incarnation Ritual to give Griffith physical form ran its course, Slan is separated from the other senior God Hand and acts on her own by manifesting the Qliphoth in a forest and creating a temporary body from Troll guts to lure Guts to her so, knowing he could not join the God Hand, she can tempt him to use the behelit he stole from the Count. But the Skull Knight's interference allows Guts to defeat Slan with his Dragonslayer, though she enjoyed the pain and gave Guts a kiss before taking her leave. Her name is borrowed from A. E. van Vogt's Slan. Ubik The God Hand has the form of a small floating demon wearing glasses and having tentacle-like legs. Always with an evil grin, Ubik appears to be a deceiver; he is able to persuade potential Apostles to fulfill the ritual of sacrifice by conjuring either images of their past or, in Griffith's case, a reflection of their subconscious. While not an outright liar, Ubik twists the truth to place his target in a despondent state of him while convincing them that they have no choice but to make the sacrifice. His name is borrowed from Philip K. Dick's Ubik. Conrad is concerned with inevitability and doom and appears as a puckered human face with the body of a massive wood louse. He summoned the mound that lifted Griffith skyward, above the rest of the Hawks. Compared to the rest of the God Hand, Conrad is a stoic individual whose only desire is to spread pestilence to the mortal world, having partially manifesting in diseased rats to orchestrate a Black Plague to force the survivors to flee to St. Albion to be offered for the Incarnation Ritual. His name is borrowed from Roger Zelazny's ...And Call Me Conrad. =The New Band of the Hawk= After returning to the physical plane, Griffith establishes a new Band of the Hawks using both humans and apostles. Zodd (sometimes known as Zodd the Immortal) is a bloodthirsty apostle who has lived for three centuries slaughtering his way through countless battles in search of worthy opponents. He has the ability to transform from his bestial human form into a Baphomet- like beast with the face and tail of a tiger along with a pair of bat-like wings that he can retract and grow at will. Zodd first encountered and defeated Guts and Griffith during a castle raid, ultimately deciding to spare them upon realizing Griffith's Crimson Behelit and what fate was in store for the Band of the Hawk. He has also had a long-standing rivalry with the Skull Knight, along with Guts as he increasingly became a more capable opponent - this went to the extent of throwing his sword to Guts when Guts' own was destroyed in a duel with General Boscogn of Tudor's Purple Rhino Knights. Zodd was further impressed by Guts when, while serving to guard the way to the Nexus from the Skull Knight, he found the swordsman survived the Eclipse and learns of Guts's exploits. Years later, prior to the Incarnation Ritual in St. Albion, Zodd is defeated within a dream by Griffith which cost him his left horn. Zodd eventually arrives to what remained of Albion to spirit the reconstituted Griffith, becoming his right-hand man and first member of his new Band of the Hawk. Grunbeld (Sword of the Berserk), Kiyoyuki Yanada (2016 anime) Grunbeld, known in Japan as , is a giant red-haired apostle of exceeding strength in dragon-like scale plate armor and armed with a warhammer and a shield containing a hidden cannon. As a member of the reformed Band of the Hawk, his physical built and brute strength make him a replacement of Pippin in retrospect. While human, Grunbeld became renowned in the Hundred Year War as a famous war veteran in the northern part of the continent where he apparently held his ground against a vast army of three thousand Tudor soldiers for many months. Having a warrior's code of honor, considering Flora's death demeaning to him, Grunbeld expressed an interest in fighting Guts when Flora's manor was set inflamed. A disappointed Grunbeld easily defeated Guts, who had yet to recover from his ordeal with Slan at the time, but is then forced to assume his Apostle form after Guts became possessed by the Berserker Armor. In this form, Grunbeld is a quadruped dragon whose outer shell is composed of stylized corundum crystal formations harder than steel and is able to exhale flames from his mouth. Grunbeld is ultimately held back from pursuing Guts and his group by Flora's spirit possessing the flames, returning to Griffith's side to aid in defeating the Kushan army. Locus Voiced by: Shougo Nakamura (Japanese, 2016 anime) , known as the Moonlight Knight, is another of Griffith's new generals in the Hawks. He is undefeated in jousting and was too proud to serve anyone until he swore loyalty to Griffith, who was the object of a vision he experienced. In addition to being an apostle, he also leads the Band of the Hawk's demon lancer division. Along with Irvine, however, he seems to retain the most humanity among the Apostle Army. His Apostle form merges him with his horse to form a metallic centaur, and his lance is transformed into a very long double- ended spear. Honorable and daring in battle, he could be something of a reversed counterpart to Corkus, as it can also be suggested by the inversion of the first syllabe in their names (with \\"l\\" and \\"r\\" being the same in Japanese). Irvine Voiced by: is a prominent archer in the new Band of the Hawks. He has spoken with few people aside from Sonia. His eyes have neither pupils nor irises. His monstrously shaped bow has a demonic eye in the middle of its handguard. As a self-described hunter and loner, he prefers to camp out in the woods whilst immersing himself in his only known pleasure: playing the lute by the campfire. Irvine's precision with the bow is peerless. He is able to fire off several arrows simultaneously with unerring accuracy. The bow itself seems to funnel quite a bit of power into its arrows: foes hit at the neck are usually decapitated. In his Apostle form his legs are replaced by a large wolf creature with horns and the same demonic eye as his bow and his body is now covered in fur and his face looks similar to that of a werewolf. In this new form he is able to remove and twist his tail hairs into arrows and his horns can be used as a crossbow with string made from the horns. Once these arrows from his tail pierce the target they suddenly grow unusually large spikes with the shape of a root that perforate the target's body completely. He shares a bond with Sonia, who has taken to riding him as a mount during the final battle with Ganishka. With his calm demeanor and affinity for ranged weapons, he could be considered the counterpart of Judeau. Rakshas Voiced by: Masashi Nogawa (Japanese, 2016 anime) is a devious leader within the new Band of the Hawk, with a history as an exiled member of the Kushan Empire's Bākiraka Clan. Being amorphous, his entire body appearing to shrouded in a black cloak with nearly featureless face concealed by a white mask with three illustrated eyes, Rakshas uses his skills as an assassin to blend into the shadows and produce string-like extensions to stab his enemies. Although he was the one who exposed Silat to Ganishka's horrific process for breeding demon soldiers, his motivations were less than benevolent. He has also admitted that he only joined Griffith's cause in the interest of making sure no one other than himself would kill him. Rakshas later makes an attempt on Rickert's life in Falconia and ends up facing Silat when he comes to youth's aid, replacing his mask after it was damaged with his near-featureless face having only three eyes and a slight nose protrusion. In his Apostle form, he becomes larger and more monstrous, his tentacles gaining more dexterity, but otherwise looks similar to his 'human' self. Rakshas's only weakness is that he can harmed by fire, Rickert using that to his advantage as he, Silat, and their group flee Falconia. Sonia Voiced by: Yoshino Nanjō (Japanese, 2016 anime) is part of Griffith's reformed Band of the Hawk and is very devout in her admiration of him. Her parents were killed when the Kushans came to her village. She was held prisoner by them until Griffith, with his apostles, rescued her and others in an assault against the invading Kushans forces. Sonia, despite being surrounded in a surreal and sometimes horrific world, remains abnormally laid-back, showing no signs of fear for her life. As a matter of fact, she is amazed and cheerful about the situation in the Hawks. She has the power of clairvoyance, which is amplified when she is near Griffith, with whom she has a childish infatuation and, because of this, is very jealous of Charlotte for being betrothed to Griffith. Sonia uses her ability to sense people's emotions and see visions of the future to aid in the new Band of the Hawk's campaigns. She befriended Schierke when they met in Vritanis and foresees they'll meet again: referring to Schierke as an owl and herself a kite playing in a moonlight forest. She also formed a connection with the distant Irvine. Recently, when the human followers of Griffith refused to join Griffith's apostles in battle, Sonia charged heedlessly into battle and was saved only by the timely intervention of Irvine. Her bold deed rallied the others, and she now rides Irvine as a mount. After the establishment of Falconia, Griffith places Sonia in the church hierarchy as the new Pope. Sonia could be seen as a counterpart to Casca: both have been rescued by Griffith, and both have had crushes on him. She also acts as a foil to Schierke, being a young magically-inclined girl with feelings for the leader of their team, but while Guts treats Schierke as a friend and surrogate daughter, Griffith merely sees Sonia as a means to an end. Mule Wolflame Voiced by: Mitsuki Saiga (Japanese, 2016 anime) An adolescent Midland noble, ran into Sonia after his group of soldiers was saved by Irvine and the new Band of the Hawk from Kushans. Sonia brought him to meet Griffith; like most people who do so, he was amazed and immediately attracted to Griffith. Ever since that day, he has been Sonia's guardian, a role in which he endures constant frustration. He runs into Isidro in Vritanis while looking for Sonia and the two ultimately became friendly rivals, creating a relationship not unlike the one Guts and Griffith once had. Sonia referred to him as the \\"duck knight\\" and offered to promote him to \\"wild drake\\" class if he bested Captain Sharkrider. He is this Band of the Hawks' equivalent to Rickert, a child who is not fully aware of what Griffith's intentions are and is given the duties of a squire. He is also a counterpart to Isidro, being a young boy who looks up to a member of the original Band of the Hawk (Griffith for Mule and Guts for Isidro) and wants to learn from them, though unlike Mule, Isidro is far more perceptive and savvy due to his life as a thief and thus can see right through Griffith and the false utopia of Falconia. =Apostles= Snake Baron The mercenary known as the was an Apostle who lived in Koka Castle, coercing the mayor of the nearby town to provide him with shipments of human prisoners for consumption. As an Apostle, the Snake Baron transformed into a massive humanoid snake with his human face set inside the flesh of the snake's lower jaw, with the snake's tongue jutting from his own mouth. In the manga, Guts unintentionally rescued Puck from some of the Snake Baron's men, sparing one to send the message to his master that \\"The Black Swordsman has come.\\" Guts was flogged and imprisoned by the mayor's men, but escaped after Puck provided him with the keys to his cell. He then confronted the Snake Baron, crippled him, and demanded to know the location of the God Hand. When the Snake Baron could not provide an answer, Guts left the Apostle to die in a fire. In the 1997 anime series, Guts takes Snake Baron's green behelit after killing him. The Count In his human form, The Count appeared as an extremely obese man with a penchant for sentencing (innocent) people to death for heresy. He became an Apostle after he found his wife participating in a pagan orgy, slaughtering the pagans and then activating his behelit while preparing to commit suicide to escape the pain of her betrayal. After offering her as a sacrifice to the God Hand, he transformed into a giant caterpillar-like tentacled slug with a toothy maw and his human face embedded in its 'forehead'. The Count first met Guts indirectly during the Eclipse, having hollowed out Pippin's body to use as a baiting lure before tearing the husk in half. Guts later encountered the Count again through his court physician Vargas, who sought revenge on the Apostle for the death of his family and mutilation of his body. Guts acquired the Count's behelit from Vargas, who had stolen it while escaping the castle, for his quest for vengeance against Griffith. The Count captured Vargas and has him executed, and nearly killed Guts in the battle that followed. However, a grievously injured Guts managed to outwit and mortally wound him, severing his head after blowing off part of his face with his cannon. The Count's behelit activated while soaked in his blood, however, sending them to realm of the God Hand. The God Hand offered the Count new life in return for sacrificing his daughter Theresia. But the Count hesitated to give up his daughter, the one person he truly loved, and was dragged into the Abyss by a horde of tormented souls, including a vengeful Vargas, after his body expired. The Count's grey behelit remains on Gut's person for the duration of the storyline. Wyald (Japanese, Berserk and the Band of the Hawk) was the sadistic leader of the Black Dog Knights, a battalion most feared in the Midland as it is composed of criminals. His apostle form was a massive primate-like creature. Wyald was charged by the King of Midland to hunt down Griffith and his rescuers, the Band of the Hawk. Badly injured by Guts, he believed that his death could be averted if Griffith could be persuaded to use the Crimson Behelit to summon the God Hand; however, the king's torturer had taken it and thrown it away. Soon after, Wyald is killed by Zodd, and it is subsequently revealed he was a frail old man before he became an apostle. Due to explicit content, Wyald and the Black Dogs do not appear in the 1997 anime or the movies, though some of his lines are given to a human character who leads an attack on Griffith's rescue team and Corkus' relief corps. Rosine was a young female apostle who sacrificed her parents to obtain the form of a female elf with the wings and antennae of a Luna moth, as well as a small pair of moth-like limbs near her hips and a 'helmet' similar to the head of a Luna moth. Her motivation for doing so was the legend of a child named Peekaf who believed himself an Elf and in doing so lost his human parents. She referred to herself as the Queen of the Elves and her true form is a monstrous female Luna moth. Rosine is first seen by Rickert, who spots her hovering over the middle of a lake before the camp is attacked by other apostles, and she is seen standing apart from the horde as they devour the wounded Hawks and beckoning at her fellows to attack Rickert. Dwelling in the Misty Valley, Rosine terrorized a nearby village, sending an army of pseudo-apostles familiars disguised as elves to eat the town's livestock and people, as well as capturing children for her to transform into new servants. Guts, Puck, and Rosine's former friend Jill travelled to the Misty Valley to confront Rosine, who offered to make Jill an elf apostle. Jill was tempted by the promise of flight, but was uneasy with the warlike ways of Rosine's familiars killing each other for fun. Guts found and destroyed the elf demon cocoons while setting the Misty Valley on fire, forcing an enraged Rosine to battle him until she was so badly injured that she could no longer fight. As Guts was about to deliver a killing blow, Jill shielded Rosine with her body. It did nothing to stop Guts, but before he could act, Jill's father arrived and shot him with an arrow. Guts was then attacked by the Holy Iron Chain Knights, led by Farnese. Mortally wounded, Rosine finally understood the moral of Peekaf's fable and in her delirium attempted to return home to her parents but ultimately succumbed to her injuries and fell from the sky to her death. In some translations, she is referred to as Roshinu. The Egg of the Perfect World A deformed human with no name or knowledge of who he is, Nobody lived the life of an outcast by feeding on the refuse at the base of the Tower of Conviction while curious of people. Shunned by the tower refugees when they first see him, Nobody dug a deep pit into the earth to hide himself from the world that the refugees used as a dumping hole for their dead. But when Nobody used a brown Behelit while being crushed by the corpses piling on him, he appears before the God Hand as they revealed the nature of the world to him. Nobody offers his own existence and St. Albion for the chance to purify the world for salvation. Thus the outcast is transformed into a living Behelit, self-titled as the , whose sole purpose is to invoke an Incarnation Ceremony at Albion to bring Griffith back to the mortal plane by using sacrifices while offering his own life for the God Hand to manifest through. During the conviction arc, the Egg used his powers to turn several people around the tower into pseudo-apostles (including Father Mozgus and his torturers) before revealing himself to one of the camp prostitutes so that at least one person would know that he existed. As the moment of the ceremony draws near, the Egg found Guts' deformed Child near death from using its power to save Casca. Out of pity while knowing they both would die soon, the latter serving as Griffith's host body, the Egg swallowed the baby before later \\"hatching\\" Griffith once the Incarnation Ceremony had run its course. Emperor Ganishka is the sorcerer-king of Kushan Empire. As the first born son of the previous king, Ganishka was the heir to the throne despite his mother favoring his younger brother. His mother eventually attempted to poison him to put his brother on the throne, though he barely managed to survive. Ganishka, angry and vengeful, responded by killing his brother. This drove his mother insane with grief and eventually caused her to commit suicide, and he ascended the throne after his father's death from a wartime accident. Believing fear to be the best method for conquering others, Ganishka established himself as a heinous tyrant. After nearly dying at the hands of his son, Ganishka became an Apostle with the Behelit donated to him by Daiba, offering said son as payment to the God Hand as revenge. In his Apostle form, reaching a greater depth in the Astral Realm than the others, Ganishka can manipulate water and air to manifest a fog-based construct with only a few weaknesses and the ability to hurl lightning at his enemies. Unlike the other Apostles, Ganishka did not see Griffith as his leader upon the God Hand's arrival to the physical world and acted on his own whims to restore the Kushan Empire to its former glory. This process involved Ganishka having Daiba create a man-made Behelit by sewing the corpses of dead Apostles together to create his army of Daka and animals infused with spirits to conquer Midland and the rest of the world. After turning the Midland capital of Wyndham into a literal hell, Ganishka next turned his attention to the Holy See's western stronghold of Vrittanis with Griffith as the church's champion. Ganishka agreed to have his final battle with Griffith in Wyndham, using his man-made Behelit in a ritual that takes the life force of those caught in it, namely his patrol men and beasts, to transform himself into a mountainous monstrosity of godlike power that Daiba called \\"Shiva\\". However, while gradually losing his mind in his state, Ganishka was destroyed when Griffith redirected the Skull Knight's attack with the Sword of Resonance at him. Because Ganishka transcended his humanity twice, the sword's dimensional properties caused his death to trigger the \\"World Transformation\\" that heralded the coming of Fantasia, with his corpse crystallized into a giant tree on the land Falconia is built. The Royal Court of Midland =The King of Midland= The elderly ruler of Midland who had been fighting a century long war with the neighboring empire of Tudor. Burdened by the demands and responsibilities of his throne, the King's only comfort was his daughter Charlotte whom to him was the sole source of warmth in his existence. Due to the Band of the Hawk's victories on the battlefield, the King supported Griffith despite his common heritage and the disapproval of the nobility and eventually bestowed upon him command over all of Midland's armies. But upon learning that Griffith slept with Charlotte, the king became enraged and ordered Griffith be imprisoned and tortured while labeling the Band of the Hawk as outlaws. Combined with his attempt to rape Charlotte to regain her comfort, completely losing her as a consequence while using hired Bakiraka and the Black Dog Knights to kill Griffith after he was freed by his group, the king gradually loses his mind while his health deteriorates to the point of aging terribly. A few years after the eclipse, the King is bedridden and dying as his pleas for Charlotte to see him are refused. In the King's final moments, he sees a vision of Griffith returning to claim Charlotte and realizes that he supported Griffith to have someone to take his place and free him from the cold loneliness of the throne. =Charlotte= Formerly the princess of Midland, had been in love with Griffith almost at first sight. After Guts defeated Griffith in their duel, the latter, psychologically damaged, seduced Charlotte and was imprisoned and tortured for a year as a result. During that time, she continued to pine for him, and was the one who provided the route for the Hawks to rescue him from prison. In the manga, Charlotte accompanied the rescue party with her maid Anna, but was poisoned by a dart from one of the Bakiraka and was brought back to the king. In the anime, she simply provided the information, and did not accompany the rescue party in person. Two years after the Eclipse, Midland was conquered by the Kushans and she was taken prisoner by Ganishka to be his wife. While in captivity, Charlotte spent her time making embroidery portraits of Griffith, dreaming of his return. Soon after the events at Albion, Griffith did return for her and used Zodd to fly her and Anna out of captivity. She is currently traveling with the new Band of the Hawk alongside Griffith. She recently declared them to be Midland's Regular Army after their resounding victory against the Kushans in Vritannis, and has so far, maintained her innocent nature throughout the series. Sonia, jealous of her betrothal to Griffith, once referred to her as the \\"Queen of the Ducks\\". =Julius= was the brother of the king and the leader of the White Dragon Knights. He resented the rise of Griffith and the Band of the Hawk in the favor of the king, especially given Griffith's common heritage. As a result, he plotted with Minister Foss to kill Griffith by arranging for a stray arrow to be fired during a hunt. The plan went awry when the arrow struck Griffith's Crimson Behelit and the king concluded that the attack was meant for Princess Charlotte, who was accompanying Griffith. In retaliation, Griffith sent Guts to assassinate Julius. Guts successfully completed his task, but as he was escaping, Julius' young son Adonis discovered him, forcing Guts to kill the boy before fleeing into the sewers. =The Queen of Midland= The queen was Charlotte's step mother. Her disapproval of Charlotte's interest in Griffith turned into hatred towards him for plotting the death of her secret lover Julius. She supported a plan conceived by Minister Foss to poison Griffith's wine at a royal party. However, due to the manipulations of Griffith, the minister betrayed her and used a nonlethal drug to make Griffith only appear dead. As the queen and a group of co-conspirators celebrated Griffith's death at the top of a tower, Foss suddenly left the gathering and silently locked the door. The queen and the others began to panic after discovering that the tower had been set on fire. Glancing out a window, she beheld Griffith alive and well, to her horror. The queen furiously declared that Griffith, a commoner, could not be allowed to kill royalty. Griffith replied that on the battlefield, heritage has no meaning, only who is defeated. She dies after being crushed by flaming debris. =Minister Foss= is a master of court intrigue. He conceived of plots with both Julius and the queen to kill Griffith. However, after the death of Julius, Griffith discovered Foss' involvement with the queen because he detected a hint of fear in the look of the minister's eyes. Griffith kidnapped Foss' daughter Elise in order to ensure the minister's cooperation. After Foss helped Griffith end the queen's life, Griffith returned the minister's daughter to him, declaring that there should be no more enmity between them. After the Eclipse, Foss predicted that the visions of the White Hawk signify that Griffith will return. More recently, he has been seen in the company of Laban, discussing Griffith's return and upcoming confrontation with Ganishka. =Laban= was an early supporter of Griffith. He agreed with the king that Griffith should be judged on battlefield merit. After the Eclipse, he traveled about assisting victims of the plague. He is now assisting Griffith in his battle against Ganishka. Most recently, he led a rescue of a group of women who had been held prisoner by the emperor. His name is translated as Raban in the anime. =Owen= believed that he could advance in the court by aligning himself with Griffith. On the eve of the king's death, Owen showed great concern about Charlotte's well-being, but he was denied permission to see her. At Vritanis, only Owen recognized Guts as the leader of the Hawk's Raiders. When Charlotte declared that the new Band of the Hawk was to be Midland's regular army, and Griffith Midland's general, Owen supported her, declaring to the other nobles that Griffith had a right to the position as Midland's former hero during the war with Tudor, and that Charlotte was well informed about Griffith's tactical ability. Other characters =Gambino= Guts' adoptive father, and leader of a mercenary band, trained Guts to be a mercenary like himself and even gave Guts his first scar (across his nose) when he became insane. Gambino was later hit by a cannon blast in battle and lost his leg and the ability to fight. This incensed his anger towards Guts even further, as he also blamed Guts for the death of his lover, Sys. Gambino became drunk one night and tried to kill Guts in a fit of rage, only to be killed by Guts with his own sword. He constantly haunts Guts during his early years before the massacre of the original Band of Hawk. =The Skull Knight= (Japanese, video game), Akio Ohtsuka (Japanese, movies & 2016 anime), Jamieson Price (English, movies & 2016 anime) The is one of the most mysterious and prolific characters introduced in Berserk. He is a towering warrior dressed in full armor who rides a massive, ghostly black horse, and whose ornaments, especially his helmet (or actual head), are shaped as parts of a human skeleton. A noble figure in spite of his ominous appearance, he serves as a strong adversary to the God Hand and its acolytes. He can kill Apostles with ease, and often consumes their Behelits afterwards. He is also capable of besting Zodd the Immortal in combat, though with great difficulty, and the latter sees him as a long-time rival. He wields a powerful sword that, when stuck down his throat, becomes coated with Behelits and capable of slashing rifts through reality itself, thus allowing the Skull Knight to move freely around the world or even between different dimensions. This enigmatic knight saved Guts in more than one occasion such as the Eclipse or from Slan, never explaining his reasons but simply declaring that the Struggler (the way he calls Guts) has to keep following his fate. The Skull Knight is also the previous wearer of the Berserker Armor, and knew the witch Flora. During Griffith's final battle with Ganishka's forces, the Skull Knight's attempt on Griffith's life with his sword was diverted to the writhing body of the Kushan Emperor. It is heavily speculated that, during his life as a mortal, the Skull Knight was in fact Supreme King Gaiseric, a warlord notorious for his skull- shaped helmet. According to the legends, Gaiseric unified the continent and ruled an empire from what would become Midland before his ambitions prompted a holy man into invoking God's wrath by sending his angels (implied to be God Hand) to punish him. =Silat= is a highly skilled and agile Kushan fighter first encountered by Guts in the Golden Age arc. He wields exotic weapons including chakrams, Katars (कटार) and urumi. His combat style is similar to kalaripayat, though Guts has referred to him as a circus performer due to Silat's exotic appearance, acrobatics and his almost theatrical tendency to call out his attacks. Silat and Guts first met prior to the Eclipse in a fight tournament at a carnival to determine who would lead a band of mercenaries to finish off a battered and demoralized Band of the Hawk. When a victorious Guts refused to claim the prize, Silat, as runner-up, took on the job, which led to his second defeat. Years later, it was revealed that Silat was the leader of the Bākiraka clan, and that he was working under Emperor Ganishka in order to restore his people to their rightful place. To do this, he continually tried to find and capture Griffith, only to come up unsuccessful. But after he learned that Ganishka was an apostle who had been behind the cruel slaughter of women for his demoniac reinforcements, Silat started to question his sworn allegiance. A Kushan engineer under Griffith named Jaris offered Silat a position in the Band of the Hawk, but Silat decides not to align himself with another demon ruler and instead watch from the shadows until deciding to spirit Rickert from Falconia. His name is borrowed from the martial art silat. His clan almost all utilize the same style of acrobatics and precision attacks with exotic weapons, such as toothed-swords, bladed discs, and the like, and defeat Midland infantry with ease, only meeting their match (understandably) against foes such as Guts, or, on one occasion, Nosferatu Zodd. Among the clan, however, are four men known as Tapasa who fight in a dramatically different style more suiting their towering frames and nubs of swollen bone near their big toes, index fingers, knees, and elbows (the striking points in their attacks). They are shown not only to be blindingly fast, but also capable of smashing through bone and steel armor alike with their strikes, much of which resembles the real-world Hung Ga fighting style, which emphasizes low stances and powerful hand strikes, though they use their legs as well. Two of them are present at the time when Silat is shown the Apostle- construct that creates the Kushan monsters, but a total of four have been shown at a single time. None have ever been shown killed in combat. =Tudor= The is the opposition to Midland during the Hundred Year War having since set a foothold by taking the Fortress of Doldrey which was put under the command of governor Gennon near the war's end. When power vacuum occurred after the ruler of Tudor died, Griffith exploited the now weakened status of the invading military by using a masterful strategy to reclaim Doldrey for Midland while Tudor's remaining forces retreat back to their homeland. Adon Coborlwitz : , a principal opponent of the original Band of the Hawk during the Hundred Year War, is the misogynistic commander of Tudor's . He regularly bragged about special attacks and defenses that he called \\"Coborlwitz family secrets\\", such as \\"Bakuretsu Funsai\\", a 300-year-old fleeing technique, and \\"Ressha Jinrai\\", a 1000-year-old crossbow sneak attack. In the 1997 anime, Adon had additional dealings with the Hawks in first an attempt to lure Griffith within range of a hidden explosive cache and losing a castle under his command when Guts first joined the Hawks. First seen in the story where he overpowers a weakened Casca on a cliff ledge while goading her with sexist comments, Adon's face got mangled by Guts when he came to her defense. Though Guts and Casca fall off into the river below after he shot the former in his attempt to save the latter, a revenge-driven Adon tracks them down with about a hundred of his men, including his much bigger and stronger little brother Samson Coborlwitz. But it ended with his men all killed by Guts, who earn the nickname \\"The Hundred Man Slayer\\", while Casca fled to reach their comrades. While the manga has Adon demoted by Boscogn and \\"punished\\" to remain in Doldrey using the Hawks' siege as a last line of defense, the movies portrayed Adon to be captured by the Hawks and used by Casca's group as a means to infiltrate Doldrey before turning on them. Overpowered by a fully abled Casca, Adon attempted to use dishonest tactics to guard her off guard for a kill before she ultimately kills him. Boscogn is the commander of the , Tudor's most powerful army during the Hundred Year War. Considered the most powerful Tudor general with an intolerance towards irresponsibility and cowardice, he is first seen confronting Adon about the fiasco in which he lost a hundred men to Guts. In battle he wields a long-hafted berdiche, with which he is capable of cutting men in half. Placed under the authority of Lord Gennon, Boscone treats the Governor with polite deference but is privately disgusted by Gennon's sexual tastes towards youthful men and frustrated by his master's ill-advised interference with strategy. While he showed great skill as a tactician and as a warrior, during the battle of Doldrey, he was out-ranked by Gennon and consequently could not command the battlefield according to his tactics which included killing Griffith whom Gennon wanted alive. Boscogn confronts Guts in a climactic duel where he dismounted the Hundred Man Slayer and broke his sword, only to end up being decapitated along with his steed in one stroke after Guts acquired a new blade secretly provided by Zodd. Boscogn's death and the loss at Doldrey forces the station Tudor army to retreat, making the end of Midland's war with Tudor. =Guts and Casca's Child= A nameless entity who was conceived by Guts and Casca shortly before the eclipse, corrupted by the semen of Griffith when he raped Casca after his ascension as Femto. This resulted in the child being born prematurely as a rat-sized disfigured fetal abomination that appears at night, acting of instinct to be with his parents as he followed Guts for two years before traveling to be by Casca's side as her protector. The Child displays abilities that include barriers, but it also drained the Child of his life force by the time Egg of the Perfect World who swallowed the child so neither of them would die alone. As a result of the Egg's action, the Child became the vessel of Griffith's new physical body. But the Child's presence still lingers in first compelling Griffith to protect Casca during Guts's fight with Zodd. It would later be revealed that Child is able to regain use of his body on the night of a full moon, travelling to wherever Guts and Casca are in the form of a raven-haired youth. During the nights he is able to appear, the Child helps Guts and his group during their journey to Elfhelm. =Jill= Jill came from a village terrorized by Misty Valley demons the villagers identified as elves. Her father was drunken and abusive to her and her mother. Guts and Puck rescued her from a man who was about to try out an old sacrifice ritual on her. She took them to her village, where the villagers became alarmed by the appearance of Puck. Jill met up with Guts and Puck after they fled and told them the elves eat livestock and people and carry away children. After the elves attack the village and Guts uses a village boy to lure them into a trap, Jill identifies their leader as her childhood friend, Rosine. When the villagers turn on Guts again, he pretends to kidnap Jill, allowing him to leave peacefully. Jill and Guts set forth separately for the Valley, but Jill arrives first. Rosine takes Jill for a flight and offers to make her an especially powerful elf, but Jill refuses due to the reckless savagery the elves exhibit. When Guts arrives, he burns Rosine's elf cocoons, hunts down the elves, and fights Rosine until she falls to the ground. When Guts tries to deliver the killing blow, Jill shields Rosine. Jill's father arrives, along with the Holy Iron Chain Knights, and Guts is driven away. Jill catches up to Guts, and asks him to take her with him. Guts tells her to go back to her father because the danger is too great. Puck gives Jill a stinging bramble she can use to keep her father in check as a parting gift. =Mozgus= was a twisted and fanatical inquisitor of the Holy See whose insignia is a set of Breaking wheels. He was an exceptionally zealous but equally cruel individual who tortured and often brutally executed large numbers of supposed heretics, usually after forcing them to \\"confess\\". While Mozgus had considered everyone to be a sinner, the only exceptions he saw would be his followers, who were unrepentant and sometimes fiendish social pariahs whose reason to learn the act of torture was to repay Mozgus for his sympathy. During the plague in Midland, with the Holy Iron Chain Knights having been assigned the task of escorting him, Mozgus was sent to St. Albion when news had reached the Holy See of pagans in the holy city. After Casca was captured, being revered by the pagans, Mozgus deemed her as a witch and intended to burn her at the stake. But when her presence in the torture chamber caused the spirits of the countless torture victims to manifest in the blood, Mozgus considered the act to be a divine test while taking his transformation by the Egg of the Perfect World into a golem-like being, believing god had chosen him. After his transformed aides are killed, and with his flames shielding the people from the corpse-possessed spirits, Mozgus battles Guts in a fight that ends with his death. Ironically, Jerome noted afterwards that it made him more like a guardian angel than ever before, with the flames from Mozgus's dead body providing the surviving refugees with protection from the flesh-consuming dead before the Incarnation Ritual would commence. =Luca= is the leader of a band of prostitutes at Albion. She was introduced trying to convince a Holy See official of Casca's guiltlessness in relation to one of Mozgus's victims, using a callous facade to do so. However, she was revealed shortly after to be disgusted with their cruelty (although there is an alternative translation of the scene which paints her in a more heartless light). Luca then took in the wayward Casca, calling the mute former Hawk commander Elaine. When Jerome, a customer and love interest of sorts, gave her a necklace of pearls, she divided them evenly among her girls, believing that they could only survive the hysteria of the heretic hunts by eliminating any cause for jealousy. She covered Casca's face in bandages as a pretense that Casca had contracted syphilis. When the weak-willed prostitute Nina visited the nearby goat worshiping cult and threatened to turn her over to the worshipers, Luca smacked and then spanked the blond haired girl, causing her to submit. When Pepe, one of her prostitutes, was accused of heresy, Luca came to her defense. Luca and Pepe were saved from arrest with the timely appearance of Guts. When Guts discovered that Luca had seen Casca, Luca attempted to reunite him with Casca, but she could not since Nina had taken the mute girl to the cult. When Casca and Nina were taken to Mozgus, Luca bribed a guard to allow her to enter the monastery. While Guts was looking for Casca, Luca released Nina from her imprisonment. After Isidro challenged Mozgus to release Casca, one of the priest's torturers attacked, causing Luca to fall. Nina grabbed Luca and tried to hold her, but Luca let go. Luca was spared injury because she was caught by the Skull Knight. She then met the Egg of the Perfect World, who explained his purpose to her. When Albion was being overrun by the dead, Luca hid Nina in a barrel and herself in a well to survive the ordeal. Some time after, Luca ends up owning an inn in Falconia. =Flora= is Schierke's mistress, who taught her in the arts of magic and Od. In addition to being a powerful witch of indeterminate age, she is an old friend of the Skull Knight, whom she sees as \\"still having a human heart.\\" This would imply that Flora knew the Skull Knight before he took on his current ghoulish form. Prior to her living in the woods outside Enoch village, she wandered the land, helping people with her magic until the Holy See's influence drove her into reclusion. During their journey to the sea, Guts and his party were recruited by Flora to aide in the extermination of a troll infestation that threatened the nearby villages and forest. In exchange, she provides them with several magical items as well as special tattoos for Guts and Casca which dampen the signal transmitted by the brand of sacrifice. She dies when Griffith sends apostles to hunt down anyone powerful enough to oppose him, her spirit appearing a final time before Schierke as she possessed the flames the Apostles had lit to consume her and her home to create a barricade between them and Guts's party, thereby allowing them to escape. =Federico de Vandimion= is the head of the illustrious Vandimion family, the wealthiest noble clan in Berserk. He is father to Farnese, Serpico, Manifico, Georgio and Politiano. Initially painted as a distant man, he was often working hard to ensure his vast fortune was secure, leaving no time to raise Farnese properly. In truth, he was actually frightened of his unpredictable daughter, as revealed by his wife to Farnese. His neglectful behavior towards his family is likewise returned to him, with the exception of Farnese, who asked Guts to protect her family when Kushan beasts invaded a ball to massacre the attending nobility. Years ago he had an affair, the result of which is none other than Serpico: he granted the latter a noble title in cold exchange for his silence on the matter of their relation. =Captain Bonebeard= Captain Bonebeard is the commander of a pirate ship called the Captain Sharkrider. The stereotypical pirate captain, he attempted to go legit by going into the slave trade business with Kushan children, putting him at odds with Schierke, who had decided to free them. Isidro, who was trying to keep the spirited young witch from being burned at the stake, joined her crusade. Sonia admired her effort and joined her as well, bringing her guard Mule along. Mule attempted to fight the captain but was ill-suited for fighting on the swaying boat. The nimble Isidro fared much better and the captain offered to let the boy thief serve on his ship. Azan, asleep on the boat, was awakened and joined in the melee. Ultimately, the whole group of them forced Bonebeard to give up his slaves. Once Roderick's ship was at sea, Bonebeard ordered an attack on the warship, ignorant that his enemy was much more than he could handle. Hopelessly out-gunned, Bonebeard was forced to retreat, his ship maimed almost to the point of sinking. In his lack of luck, after the World Transformation occurred, Bonebeard is devoured by the Sea God as he, his crew, and their ship become extensions of the ancient creature. Bonebeard serves as the Sea God's primary helper until the creature is killed by Guts. Humorously, his ship's name is made reality by the figurehead of his ship: a skeleton pirate captain riding a shark. Also, it's revealed by Bonebeard himself that he became an emotional wreck following his defeat at the docks by Azan and Schierke, having failed to become a legitimate businessman (though via slave trading), he found that he'd lost his touch with piracy, as well. Guts' party, particularly Isidro, are disgusted by how pathetic Bonebeard appears despite his ghoulish form, as he is reduced to hiding behind one of the gunwales of his ship and gnawing on a banister. =Daiba= was Ganishka's loyal sorcerer chief and advisor who desired a powerful kingdom under the rule of magic. He was formerly an ascetic who had given Ganishka the behelit that would make him an Apostle. Daiba also created for Ganishka the man-made behelit used to breed their army of monsters. He challenged Guts' group by conjuring a storm and summoning monstrous beasts from the seas, but even through his greatest sorceries, which included summoning tornadoes and a gigantic water spirit, he was defeated by the combined efforts of Guts and Schierke. Daiba was last seen riding atop a pterodactyl-like creature after Ganishka transformed into an entity he believed to be the deity Shiva, having used his magic to protect himself from the ritual. After Ganishka's death and the world's descent into fantastical chaos, Daiba goes into hiding in Falconia as a stable hand in Luca's inn. He ends up saving Erica from Rakshas and later provided Rickert and Silat assistance in escaping from Falconia. Video game characters =Rita= is a travelling performer skilled in throwing knives and juggling. Her accomplice, Job was infected with Mandragora and her performing days were cut short when Guts killed him. Reluctantly at first, she eventually helps Guts out throughout the Chapter. She appears on the Dreamcast game version of Berserk. =Balzac= is the baron of a town who was once a considerate ruler, but the pressure of caring for his subjects while researching on Mandragorans to his ailing wife Annette turned him into a dictator. When Guts came to his town, Balzac plotted to use him to acquire the Mandragora Heart in hopes it would restore her mind. However, complications foiled Balzac's plan as he attempted to kill Guts as a Mandragoran. But fatally wounded, his destined behelit unknowingly brought to him by Rita, Balzac sacrifices Anette to be reborn a chimera-like Apostle before Guts kills him for good. =Eriza= is a nun working with the Mandragoras, having become a Mandragoran yet retaining her will. Long ago, a simple-minded pleasant boy named Niko who visited her cathedral regularly died one winter's night. From Niko's body, a Mandragora grew and Eriza resolved to protect it while it spread across her village. Balzac attempted to take the Mandragora's Heart, but only escape with a fragment for his research before requesting Guts to get the rest. Though Eriza pleas with Guts to leave peacefully, she is forced to fight him when he finds the Mandragora tree and cut its heart. Eriza refuses to relinquish the heart, which is Niko's remains, and attempts to flee before find the Mandragoran villagers being massacred by Balzac's men. In desperation, Eriza choices to takes her own life rather than hand Niko over as runs back into the burning church while dropping a pendant she made with an item that she found the boy's body with: a behelit that eventually reaches Balzac as part of his fate. =Charles= , appearing in the Berserk: Millennium Falcon Hen Seima Senki no Shō 2004 game, is a child of noble birth who lost his parents and manor home in a fire. Charles ended up an apostle with illusionary powers at the cost of his sister, appearing to have blocked out the memory of his sister's death and created a phantom of her. Charles also recreated his home where he remained in solitude before Guts intruded, the Apostle conjuring phantoms of the deceased members of the Band of the Hawk to haunt Guts before being killed off by the swordsman.

Early life =East end= He was born in Tollcross, then technically outside of the Glasgow city boundaries. This, together with the fact that neither of his parents was born in Scotland, would come as a surprise to those who knew him as \\"Mr Glasgow\\", so thoroughly did he identify himself with the culture and people of that city. He felt that Glasgow was a fairly autonomous \\"city state\\". That his father, also John, was a prosperous company secretary and Jack himself trained as an accountant would only add to the surprise, given Glasgow's \\"Red Clydeside\\" reputation. The family rapidly moved to Dennistoun where Jack (and subsequently his four brothers and three sisters) attended Whitehill Secondary School. At his father's insistence he began training as an accountant. Accounting did not suit Jack's temperament, nor did it challenge his abilities, which lay towards writing, spinning yarns and acting. =Journalism = In 1928, he got a job as a reporter on the Glasgow Evening Citizen, where he was involved in a number of sensational stories – including a tragic blaze at the Glen Cinema in Paisley in which 80 children had perished. He also attended an early demonstration of the new-fangled television by John Logie Baird. Meanwhile, he continued to act – mostly light parts (in the Scottish National Players as well as for BBC Radio). He worked also for the city's other papers the Evening News and the Evening Times, being the last of the city's three evening papers, and contributed to The Bulletin, Glasgow Herald and the Scottish Field. =Army, acting, script writing and political activity= During the second world war he attained the rank of captain in the cinematographic unit, for which he wrote scripts (in the company of Peter Ustinov and David Niven). He was well connected with the media classes of both Glasgow and Edinburgh,. He was also active politically, standing unsuccessfully in a 1962 by-election for Liberal Party in the Glasgow Woodside constituency, where he then lived. He also campaigned against the Glasgow Inner Ring Road and the construction of Glasgow's peripheral housing estates, such as Easterhouse and Nitshill, which resulted in the decline of traditional inner-city districts, a phenomenon known as Counter urbanisation. Writer and bon viveur =Author= It is, though, as a writer that he is best known. He published 54 books, and possibly even more. Many of his books had been commissioned and some were obviously meant to be \\"fun\\" books. Several others had been commissioned by local authorities or tourist boards with a view to promoting their areas. Large companies – especially builders and whisky distillers – commissioned histories of their success from him, as did the locally renowned \\"Western Baths\\". All of these commissions are testimony to his engaging style, as well as an investigative prowess derived from his journalism. He produced other substantial works closer to his personal interests, such as Heart of Glasgow. However, one of his biggest successes was Square Mile of Murder. In this he described and analysed several notorious 19th-century murders, and miscarriages of justice, in the middle-class districts in the west of the city. Among these were the cases of Madeleine Smith, (played, like the rest of the cast, with a perfect English accent by Ann Todd in David Lean's 1949 film Madeleine) and Oscar Slater. He tried his hand as a novelist in House on the Hill, with limited success (although it was later dramatised by Scottish Television). However, his sparkling journalism never went out of fashion – despite the fact that he had always warned that he never let a concern for facts get in his way if there was a good story to be told. His \\"'Ask Jack\\" column in the Glasgow Evening Citizen gave lively answers (most of them true) to readers' questions on all aspects of the City. He was often on television, with STV and BBC Scotland, and formed a winning partnership with Sir James Fergusson in the long-running radio series Round Britain Quiz. Pavement in the Sun is an attempt at autobiography. =Restaurant critic= He regularly acted as restaurant critic for that paper, where, as usual, his partisanship for the city over-ruled any more nuanced judgements. The view from one restaurant table looked down along the Great Western Road. \\"Like the Champs Elysées – only better!\\", was Mr Glasgow's considered verdict. He spent a great deal of time in the \\"Ubiquitous Chip\\" restaurant and there is a caricature of him – buck teeth and all – by Emilio Coia still hanging over his habitual table. The restaurant was close to Jack's last home – a flat in a classic Glasgow tenement. His substantial Edwardian flat in Beaumont Gate, was in Dowanhill, where he had always aspired to stay. This, like his birth and childhood homes was of striking red sandstone – a Glaswegian architectural/visual code for \\"extremely well-off\\". Final years He married Jessie Lottimer Bennett Miller, herself an outstanding journalist (who died in 1974). They had no children. He was awarded the St Mungo Prize Glasgow's top honour, in 1988, and Glasgow University awarded him an Honorary Doctorate of Laws. The St Mungo Prize is awarded to the individual who has done most in the previous three years to improve and promote the city of Glasgow. He died in Glasgow Western Infirmary on 11 April 1991.

Ross Toole Kenneth Ross Toole (August 8, 1920 - August 13, 1981) was an American historian, author, and educator who specialized in the history of Montana. Perhaps the best-known and most influential of the state's twentieth- century historians, Toole served as director of the state's historical society, authored several noted volumes of state history and social commentary, and was a popular professor at the University of Montana for 16 years. He supported environmental protection for Montana's resources, and voiced strong support for labor unions and farmers over big business, especially targeting the railroad and mining industries. These views frequently came into conflict with those of the Anaconda Copper Company and some Montana politicians, most notably Governor J. Hugo Aronson (served 1953-1961). Toole's views on the role of corporate dominance in Montana history were often controversial, and have been hotly debated by historians. Biography Toole was born and raised in Missoula, Montana, to a family whose ancestors had been in the state since the mid-nineteenth century. After graduating from high school, he studied at Georgetown University and the University of Montana before enlisting in the United States Navy during World War II. After the war, Toole returned to Missoula and obtained bachelor's and master's degrees in history at the University of Montana. He completed a Ph.D. in history at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1951. That same year, Toole was appointed Director of the Montana Historical Society (MHS), based in Helena. Toole did much to improve the stature of the Society during his tenure there, though he was frustrated by the political nature of the post. His relationship with state political and business leaders was further strained when Toole founded a short-lived periodical titled Montana Opinion, which featured articles exposing political corruption and economic injustice in the state. Toole left MHS in 1957 and accepted a position as Director of the Museum of the City of New York. Two years later, he moved to Santa Fe to work as Director of the Museum of New Mexico. He returned to Montana in 1963 and operated a ranch near the town of Red Lodge. Toole's passion for Montana and its history remained strong in the years following his departure from MHS, as evidenced by the 1959 publication of his book, Montana: An Uncommon Land. The volume was a seminal history of the state, firmly establishing Toole as the Montana's preeminent living historian, and outlining Toole's long-standing thesis that the state's history was strongly shaped by the exploitation of its natural resources by corporate outsiders. In this belief, Toole was expanding on ideas first published by Joseph Kinsey Howard, another of the state's leading historians, in his 1943 book Montana: High, Wide, and Handsome. Following a heart attack and a physician's recommendation to avoid ranch work, Toole returned to the profession of history in 1965, accepting the position of A.B. Hammond Professor of Western History at the University of Montana (UM). He remained at the University until his death, and is best remembered there for teaching a class titled \\"Montana and the West,\\" which drew several hundred students each year. His entertaining and often fiery class lectures made Toole's class the most popular of the University's offerings at the time, and his final series of class lectures remain available today on videotape. Toole continued to write on Montana history topics while at UM, publishing Twentieth-century Montana: A State of Extremes in 1972. His concerns about corporate exploitation of the state's natural resources were discussed in his 1974 book, The Rape of the Great Plains. Toole also gained notoriety of a different sort in the late 1960s, when his frustration with student radicalism of the era resulted in his publication of a book with the cumbersome title, The Time Has Come to Say the Things that Need to be Said About Campus Violence, the Tyranny of a Minority, the Crusade of the Spoiled Children, the Parental Abdication of Responsibility, and the Lack of Courage, Integrity, and Wisdom on the Part of Our Educational Leaders. This book was based upon a letter to his brothers expressing his feelings about student activism and was popularly known as, \\"The Tyranny of Spoiled Brats.\\" Throughout his tenure at UM, Toole remained an outspoken advocate for environmental responsibility and political ethics. Though undergoing treatment for the lung cancer that ultimately killed him, he spent the first months of 1981 living in Helena, writing and \\"keeping an eye on the Legislature.\\" His 1981 writing project remained unfinished, though, and Toole died in a Missoula hospital that August. He remains, however, the state's best-known academic historian, with an influence that continues to be felt today. Principal Works *A History of Montana (with Merrill G. Burlingame).

The novella develops a disturbing account of indiscriminate indulgence in selfish sensuality. The word \\"senso\\" is Italian for \\"sense,\\" \\"feeling,\\" or \\"lust.\\" The title refers to the delight Livia experiences while reflecting on her affair with a handsome lieutenant. The novella is typical of Scapigliatura literature, which was at its peak at the time. Italian Women and the City: Essays -Janet Levarie Smarr, Daria Valentini 0838639658 – 2003 Page 136 Rondolino (Luchino Visconti, 1981, 294) describes Livia's notebook in Boito's novella as \\"una lunga confessione sentimentale, cinica e sprezzante.\\" . Summary Senso is set in Venetia and Trentino about the time of Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. Its protagonist is Livia, a countess from Trento, who is married unhappily to a stuffy old aristocrat, and who willingly wanders in response to her yearnings. The story opens a few years after the war, with Livia reminiscing on her 39th birthday about her first truly passionate affair. Her reverie transports us to Venice during the war, where Livia falls in love with Remigio Ruz, a dashing young lieutenant in the Austrian army. Although he obviously is using her, her money, and her social status, Livia throws herself into an affair of complete sexual abandon with Remigio. She lets him spend her money freely, cares nothing of what society thinks of her, and ignores her new lover's pathetic cowardice when he refuses to rescue a drowning child. Though the war drives the lovers apart, Livia feels driven to revisit Remigio. When she joins him for a tryst, he asks for more money, to bribe the army doctors for a reprieve from the battlefield. Livia gladly gives him all her jewels and gold. Remigio flees to Verona, without bothering even to kiss her goodbye. Eventually her yearning for Remigio drives Livia nearly mad, but her spirits soar when a letter from him finally arrives. His letter says that he loves and misses her, and that her money and his bribery had allowed him to evade any combat. He asks Livia not to look for him. Still clutching his letter, she promptly boards a carriage and heads straight to Verona to find her loyal lover. She finds the city in ruins, with dead and wounded everywhere. Livia's undeterred. She heads to the apartment she had bought for Remigio, where she finds him, a drunken, ungrateful rogue, in the company of a prostitute who openly mocks Livia for accepting his abuse. Mortification drives Livia out into the night. Shame shapes her lingering lust into vengeance when Livia remembers she still has his letter. Livia finds the Austrian army headquarters, where she indicts Remigio by presenting his proof of desertion to a general. Her vengeance for Remigio's philandering infidelity is obvious to the general, yet her motives lend her lover no exemption. The very next morning, Remigio and the doctors he bribed face a firing squad while Livia attends the execution. Style The novella presents Livia's perspective exclusively, in the form of her secret diary. She distinctly describes her selfish lust, her sexual desire, and something akin to joy that she feels on the occasion of her lover's execution. Unlike the authors of such similar characters as Anna Karenina and Madame Bovary, Camillo Boito presents his protagonist without sympathy. Senso's Livia is conscious of her conduct and may cherish the consequence. She feels either indifferent or oblivious to the damage she might do to others. She's ingenuously remorseless, while single-mindedly seeking what is best for herself alone. Adaptations Luchino Visconti very loosely adapted the novella in 1954 using the same title, but with heavy alterations to characters and introducing numerous new subplots, such as Livia's rebellious cousin Roberto, whose fight against the Austrian occupation troops is chronicled in a good deal of battles. The adaptation moves closer to the war, depicting it explicitly, whilst pushing Livia's back story into the background (unlike the novella, which is narrated through Livia's secret diary – and thus, solely focused on her perception – the film forsakes the diary and switches to third- person narration). The film starred Alida Valli as Livia and Farley Granger as her duplicitous lover. Tinto Brass adapted the story in 2002 as Senso '45 after reading the novella and finding himself unsatisfied with Visconti's liberally adapted version. The film starred Anna Galiena as Livia and Gabriel Garko as her lover. The story of the film is much more faithful to Camillo Boito's work than the earlier adaptation in terms of tone and story, but the action was transported from the Third Italian War of Independence to the end of World War II, with Remigio becoming a Nazi Lieutenant and Livia updated to being the wife of a high ranking Fascist official. Brass later explained that the change in time was made because he did not want to compete with Visconti's vision of Risorgimento-era Italy. Unlike the 1954 version, Senso '45 did not romanticize the affair between Livia and Ruz (Helmut Schultz in the 2002 film), but showed it for what it was: a clinical study in vanity and lust. However, it should be worth noting that both films significantly altered Livia's character, making her much older and sympathetic than she appeared in Boito's original novella. In 2011, an opera based on the novella premiered in Teatro Massimo in Palermo, Sicily, with music by Marco Tutino. The role of Livia in the premiere was played by Nicola Beller Carbone.

The family was firmly Guelph in sympathy. The name has many spellings, which include Frangipane, Freiapane, Fricapane and Fresapane. In his Trattatello in laude di Dante, Boccaccio traces the descent of Dante from the family. History Taddeo Zuccari, Beheading of Saint Paul, 1558–1559, in the Frangipani Chapel of San Marcello al Corso in Rome The family claimed descent from the Roman plebeian family of Anicii, however, the first mention of the family dates only from 1014, in a document relating to the Abbazia di Farfa. A parchment diploma of Otto I in the Frangipani archive at Castello di Porpetto, in Friuli, is dated 10 January 973. They played a significant part in the struggle between Pope Gregory VII and Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV, and briefly governed Rome from 1107 to 1108. In the feuding between the Orsini and Colonna families they supported the Orsini. Their power was at its greatest when they achieved the election of Pope Honorius II in 1124. From no later than 1130 the Frangipani held the Colosseum of Rome, which they had fortified and which gave them strategic control of the approaches to the Lateran Palace, the papal residence, from the north and west; the family lost control of the Colosseum to the Annibaldi in the mid-thirteenth century. In 1268 Giovanni Frangipane, lord of Astura, betrayed Conradin, the teenage Duke of Swabia and last of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, who took refuge with him after his defeat at the Battle of Tagliacozzo. Frangipane arrested him and handed him over to Charles of Anjou, who beheaded him. The family had feuds in the Campagna south of Rome, among them Astura, Cisterna, Marino, Ninfa and Terracina, and later Nemi. A branch of the family in Friuli had estates at Tarcento and Porpetto. In early 15th century the Counts of the island of Veglia (now Krk in Croatia) claimed to be related and took the name Frangipani ( Frankopan) which was approved by the Frangipane and confirmed by Pope Martin V in 1430. The Frangipani had the right of burial at the church of San Marcello al Corso in Rome; their chapel – the Frangipani Chapel – in that church is dedicated to Saint Paul. From 1558 or 1559 until his death in 1566, Taddeo Zuccari worked there on a cycle of frescoes of the life of the saint; the paintings were completed by his brother Federico.

Early life Sigüenza was born in Mexico City in 1645 to Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Benito, originally from Madrid, and to Doña Dionisia Suárez de Figueroa y Góngora, born in Seville, Spain, whom the elder Don Carlos met following his arrival New Spain in 1640. Sigüenza was the second oldest and first male of nine siblings. He was related to the famous baroque Spanish poet Luis de Góngora through his mother. He studied mathematics and astronomy under the direction of his father, who had been a tutor for the royal family in Spain. Expulsion from the Jesuits Sigüenza entered the Society of Jesus as a novice August 17, 1660, took simple vows August 15, 1662 at Tepotzotlán. But he was dismissed from the Jesuits in 1668, for repeatedly flouting Jesuit discipline and going out secretly at night. He repented and pleaded to be reinstated, but the head of the Jesuits, the General of the Order, rejected his plea, saying \\"The cause of the expulsion of this person is so disreputable, as he himself confesses, that he does not deserve this boon [of being readmitted].\\" using the quotation from . This dismissal was not only a grave disappointment and a blot on his reputation, but it also meant that he would be financially insecure for the rest of this life. He became a secular priest without a parish or a steady income, so the multiple offices he sought during his lifetime were to support himself and his extended family, all of whom, including his father, were dependent on him to the end of his life. He was ordained a secular priest in 1673. Career in Science He studied at the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico following his dismissal from the Jesuits, and excelled at mathematics and developed a lifelong interest in the sciences. When a faculty position in Mathematics & Astrology was available, Sigüenza sought to compete for it, although he did not hold a degree in the subjects. It was not clear that he could even be eligible to compete, but Sigüenza argued successfully to do so. Selection for university posts was via oposiciones or competition between candidates. A question was posed and the candidate had to complete a response within 24 hours to be judged by a panel. Ghost writers or ringers sometimes completed the exercise and Sigüenza successfully argued that his chief rival for the position, and the person who vociferously argued that Sigüenza had no standing to even compete, had to be kept under surveillance during the competition to prevent cheating. On July 20, 1672, he was named to the chair of Mathematics and Astrology. His record as a professor was marred because he was frequently absent from the classroom due to his researches on various topics and to the pressing of other obligations he took on for fiscal reasons. One of his biographers suggests that his absences from the university might be attributable to his disdain for astrology, which he considered \\"a diabolical invention and consequently, alien to science, method, principle and truth.\\" quoting from a translation included in . In 1681 Sigüenza wrote the book Philosophical Manifest Against the Comets Stripped of their Dominion over the Timid in which he tried to dismiss fears of impending superstitious predictions that linked comets to calamitous events; in the work he takes steps to separate the fields of astrology and astronomy. The Tyrolean Jesuit Eusebio Kino, who had come to New Spain to evangelize on the northern frontier, met Sigüenza at his home in Mexico City. Both men had observed the comet of 1680 and both were keenly interested in the phenomenon. The warm feelings between the two soured quickly, with Sigüenza believing that Kino belittled Mexican-born Spaniards' (creoles) level learning. Kino published a strong criticism of Sigüenza's opinion on comets, without naming him specifically. Kino's criticism was that because they were contradictory to established astronomical/astrological belief in the heavens. Sigüenza often cited authors such as Copernicus, Galileo, Descartes, Kepler, and Tycho Brahe. In 1690 Sigüenza moved to defend his previous work by publishing \\"Libra Astronómica y Filosófica\\"; it was unlike many of his other writings, which remained in manuscript form because he could not afford to publish them. He directly attacks Kino by saying \\"I hereby point out that neither his Reverence [Kino] nor any other mathematician, even if he is Ptolemy himself, can set up dogmas in these sciences, because authority has no place in them at all, but only proof and demonstration.\\" Theology was known as the \\"Queen of the Sciences\\", but Sigüenza's stance is on the side of science as defined in the modern era. Royal geographer Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora In the 1680s, he prepared the first-ever map of all of New Spain, which won high praise and was widely copied. He also drew hydrologic maps of the Valley of Mexico. In 1692 King Charles II named him official geographer for the colony. As royal geographer, he participated in the 1692 expedition to Pensacola Bay, Florida under command of Andrés de Pez, to seek out defensible frontiers against French encroachment. He mapped Pensacola Bay and the mouth of the Mississippi: in 1693, he described the terrain in Descripción del seno de Santa María de Galve, alias Panzacola, de la Mobila y del Río Misisipi. When a Spanish attempt to colonize Pensacola Bay in 1698 was thwarted by the arrival of a French fleet, Sigüenza was blamed by the leader of the expedition, Andrés de Arriola, for inciting the French action. He successfully defended himself against these charges in 1699. Other professional pursuits In order to supplement his modest salary as a professor, he took on a number of other posts. He was chaplain of the Hospital del Amor de Dios (now Academia de San Carlos) from 1682 until his death. This post provided him with living quarters, which given his strapped financial circumstances was a major benefit. It also was a steady income from celebrating masses for a fixed fee. He also served as Chief Almoner for the Archbishop of Mexico, Don Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, distributing alms to poor women, a charity the \\"misogynistic prelate could not abide.\\" Sigüenza not only pursued his interests in science, but he was also a poet, non-fiction writer, historian, philosopher, cartographer, and cosmographer of the realm. Such was his prestige that the French King Louis XIV tried to induce him to come to Paris. He published his first poem in 1662. From 1671 to 1701 (posthumous) he published a yearly almanac. A. Margarita Peraza-Rugeley has studied the surviving almanacs in her 2013 book.Peraza-Rugeley, A. Margarita Llámenme el mexicano: Los almanaques y otras obras de Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora. New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 2013. Currents in Comparative Romance Languages and Literatures Series. Vol. 215. In 1690 Sigüenza published a pirate captivity narrative which has been considered Latin America's first novel, Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez. However, new archival evidence discovered by Fabio López Lázaro (2007, 2011), José F. Buscaglia-Salgado (2009, 2011), and A. Margarita Peraza-Rugeley (2013) proves that this incredible story of a Puerto Rican taken captive by English pirates off the Philippine Islands is a historical account, not a fictional one. The archival documents contain dozens of eyewitness accounts corroborating not only the existence of Ramírez, his marriage in Mexico City, and also his capture in 1687, his life with pirates (most notably William Dampier), his collaboration with them, and his return to Mexico in 1690, at which time Spanish colonial authorities suspected Alonso of piracy. López Lázaro was the first to discover archival evidence (published in 2007) for the historical existence of Ramírez, his meeting with the Viceroy of New Spain, and the writing of Los infortunios in 1690. Buscaglia corroborated the existence of Alonso Ramírez as a true historical figure in 2009, citing his marriage certificate and pinpointing with exactitude, after two expeditions to the coast of Bacalar, the site of his shipwreck. López Lázaro's and Buscaglia's studies are the most significant findings in more than a century of scholarship on the book. The new archival evidence leaves no room to doubt that Sigüenza's key role in creating Los infortunios de Alonso Ramírez was in editing Alonso's coarse narrative into a superior literary piece. According to López Lázaro's analysis, the book was commissioned by the Spanish administration during the war against Louis XIV to solidify Madrid's commitment to the struggle against French colonial rivals and their buccaneer collaborators but also to warn them about Spain's unreliable English and Dutch allies. Friendship with Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz Miguel Cabrera. Seventeenth-century Mexico City had two savants, Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora and Doña Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, known to posterity as the Hieronymite nun, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. It is unclear at what point the two made their acquaintance, but they lived a short distance away from each other, he in the Amor de Dios Hospital and she in the convent where she had taken vows following a time spent in the viceregal court. Although Sor Juana was cloistered, the Hieronymite order followed a more relaxed rule and nuns could have visitors in the locutorio or special room for conversation in the convent. Known as the \\"Tenth Muse\\", she was a formidable intellect and poet, and was encouraged in her scientific studies by Sigüenza. Each was well known in circles of power and with the arrival of the new viceroy to New Spain, each was tapped to design a triumphal arch to welcome him, a signal honor to them both. Sor Juana's final years were extremely difficult ones, and when she died in 1695, Sigüenza delivered the eulogy at her funeral. The text of that address is now lost, but in 1680 he had praised her, \\"There is no pen that can rise to the eminence that hers o'ertops...[the fame of] Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz will only end with the world.\\" The Ixtlilxochitl-Sigüenza-Boturini collection Sigüenza had a strong interest in the indigenous past of Mexico and began learning Nahuatl following his dismissal from the Jesuits in 1668. He collected books and other materials related to indigenous culture. At the Hospital de Amor de Dioas Sigüenza became a close friend of Don Juan, the son of indigenous nobleman Don Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, (1587?-1650).Edmundo O'Gorman, Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl, introductory material to Obras históricas, Fernando de Alva Ixtlilxochitl. Tomo 1. Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 1975, pp. 17-36. Sigüenza helped Alva Ixtlilxochitl's on Don Juan de Alva with a lawsuit against Spaniards attempting to usurp his holdings near the great pyramids at San Juan Teotihuacan. Don Juan in gratitude for Sigüenza's aid, gifted him the manuscripts and codices of his historian father, Don Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl. This was a rich collection of documents of his royal ancestors and the kings of Texcoco. In 1668, Sigüenza began the study of Aztec history and Toltec writing. On the death of Alva Ixtlilxochitl in 1650, he inherited the collection of documents, and devoted the later years of his life to the continuous study of Mexican history. When Sigüenza made his will shortly before his death, he was very concerned about the fate of his library, since its \\"collection has cost me great pains and care, and a considerable sum of money.\\"translation by and quoted in . His original intention was to have his library transferred to European repositories, including the Vatican and the Escorial, and to library of the duke of Florence, but in the end he willed them to the College of San Pedro and San Pablo. He was particularly concerned about the native materials in his collection. For an account of what happened to these documents after the death of Sigüenza, see Lorenzo Boturini Bernaducci. The Virgin of Guadalupe Virgin of Guadalupe Sigüenza wrote Indian Spring whose full title in Spanish is Primavera indiana, poema sacrohistórico, idea de María Santíssima de Guadalupe (1662). The work contributed to the midseventeenth-century outpouring of writings on the Virgin of Guadalupe. Sigüenza wrote in praise of Guadalupe, especially her role in aiding creole patriotism. Among these documents was purported to be a \\"map\\" (codex) documenting the 1531 apparition of the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Guadalupe that Luis Becerra Tanco claimed to have seen in the introduction to his 1666 defense of the apparition tradition. Sigüenza writings on Guadalupe were not extensive, but he encouraged Becerra Tanco and Francisco de Florencia to pursue the topic. Because of his association with these early documents, Sigüenza played a significant role in the development of the Guadalupe story. He was a devotee of the Virgin, and wrote Parnassian poems to her as early as 1662. But his most lasting impact on the history of the apparition was his assertion that the Nican mopohua, the Nahuatl-language rendition of the narrative, was written by Antonio Valeriano, a conception that persists to this day. He further identified Fernando Alva de Ixtlilxochitl as the author of the Nican motecpana. This declaration was stimulated by Francisco de Florencia's Polestar of Mexico, which claimed that the original Nahuatl account had been written by Franciscan Fray Jerónimo de Mendieta. Creole patriotism and the triumphal arch to welcome the viceroy in 1680 Tomás de la Cerda In 1680, he was commissioned to design a triumphal arch for the arrival of the new Viceroy, Cerda y Aragón. Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz was commissioned to design the only other one, which were erected in the Plaza de Santo Domingo, near the main square or Zócalo. No image of the triumphal arches is known to be extant, but both Sigüenza and Sor Juana wrote descriptions of the works. Sigüenza's work was entitled Theater of Political Virtues That Constitute a Ruler, Observed in the Ancient Monarchs of the Mexican Empire, Whose Effigies Adorn the Arch Erected by the Very Noble Imperial City of Mexico. Sigüenza's title was meant to convey to the new viceroy that his tenure in office was in a long line of Mexican monarchs. On the arch were images of all twelve Aztec rulers, \\"each taken to embody different political virtues. Also represented was the god Huitzilopochtli, whom Sigüenza claimed was not a deity but a \\"chieftain and leader of Mexicans in the voyage that by his command was undertaken in search of the provinces of Anahuac.\\"quoted in . Sigüenza's gigantic wooden arch (90 feet high, fifty feet wide) was a manifestation of creole patriotism that embraced the florescence of the Aztecs as a source of their own pride in their patria. He hoped that \\"on some occasion the Mexican monarchs might be reborn from the ashes to which oblivion had consigned them, so that, like Western phoenixes, they may be immortalized by fame\\" and be recognized as having \\"heroic ... imperial virtues.\\"quoted in . Sigüenza praised the arch that Sor Juana had designed, but hers took the theme of Neptune in fable and did not manifest any explicit theme \\"contribut[ing] to the growth of creole patriotism.\\" Ideas about the ancient Mexicans Map of Mexico and the central lake system by Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri from one by Sigüenza y Góngora. Sigüenza's ideas about the ancient Mexicans were informed by the hugely valuable manuscripts from Alva Ixtlilxochitl, but he also developed ideas of his own about the origin of the Mexicans. He was one of the first persons, during Spanish rule, to dig around the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan.http://www.milenio.com/node/501242 Tunnel under Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent under exploration in 2010 He took Italian traveler Giovanni Francesco Gemelli Careri to that ancient site. Sigüenza's ideas about the origins of the ancient Mexicans were influenced by German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, who saw ancient Egypt as the source of all natural wisdom. Sigüenza embraced Kircher's ideas and in the publication accompanying his triumphal arch for the arrival of the new viceroy, Theater of Political Virtues That Constitute a Ruler, \\"he boldly pronounced that the Mexican Indians were the descendants of the Naphtuhim, the son of Misraim, founder and ruler of Egypt,\\" and further asserted that Naphtuhim was a variation on the name Neptune, the ruler of Atlantis, populated by Egyptian colonists. In advocating an Egyptian origin for the ancient Mexicans, he rejects Franciscan fray Juan de Torquemada's dismissal of that theory. Sigüenza, also as opposed to Torquemada, believed that St Thomas the Apostle evangelized Mexico and identified him with Quetzalcoatl. He gave notice that a pamphlet entitled Phoenix of the West. St Thomas found with the name of Quetzalcoatl would be published, but whether he wrote it or not is unclear, since many of Sigüenza's works remain in title only. 1692 Mexico City riot View of the Plaza Mayor of Mexico City (1695) by Cristóbal de Villalpando. The viceroy's palace still shows the damage done during the 1692 riot. Considering the small proportion of the Spanish population in Mexico as opposed to the Indian and mixed-race casta populations and that the fact that there had been few challenges to Spanish rule since the early sixteenth-century conquest, likely meant the huge riot on June 8, 1692 was a shock to Spaniards. A mob of Indians and castas partially destroyed the viceregal palace and the building of the city council (cabildo or ayuntamiento). Painter Cristóbal de Villalpando's 1696 painting of the Zócalo still shows the damage to the viceregal palace from the mob's attempt to burn it down. Sigüenza wrote a lengthy \\"racy, vivid account of the riot...he also offered a fascinating profile of his own reactions to the dramatic events.\\" It is a major source for the Spanish version of events, published as \\"Letter of Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora to Admiral Pez Recounting the incidents of the Corn Riot in Mexico City, June 8, 1692.\\"In Don Carlos Sigüenza y Góngora, \\"Letter of Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora to Admiral Pez Recounting the incidents of the Corn Riot in Mexico City, June 8, 1692,\\" In In 1692, there was a severe drought in New Spain and a disease attacking wheat, called in Nahuatl \\"chiahuiztli\\". The crown sought sources of corn outside the general sourcing area for the capital, but the price of corn rose significantly. This caused a severe shortage of food for the poor. Tensions rose significantly in the capital, and came to a flashpoint when neither the viceroy nor the archbishop, to whom the crowd of petitioners appealed as legitimate authorities, would meet directly with them. Following the failed attempt to get any official audience or promise of aid, the crowd began throwing stones and set fire to the major buildings around the capital's principal square. Sigüenza saved most of the documents and some paintings in the archives, at the risk of his own life. This act preserved a considerable number of colonial Mexican documents that would otherwise have been lost. Scholars have noted the importance of the 1692 riot in Mexican history.R. Douglas Cope, The Limits of Racial Domination: Plebeian Society in Colonial Mexico City, 1660-1720, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1994, especially chapter 7 \\"The Riot of 1692\\". Later career and death In 1693, he (along with Admiral Andrés de Pez y Malzarraga), set sail from Veracruz, Mexico and discovered the East Bay River of Florida and the land where the city of Navarre is now located. In 1694, he retired from the University. His final years were marked by even more financial and personal troubles. He became ill, with what physicians identified as either gallstones or kidney stones and he was in considerable pain. His patron the Archbishop Aguiar y Seijas died and Sigüenza lost his lucrative post of Chief Almoner. He also lost the position of University Accountant. The death of his patron the Archbishop was clustered with the death of Sigüenza's father and favorite brother. His dear friend Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz died and he delivered the eulogy at her funeral. In November 1699, Sigüenza was named corregidor general (book examiner) for the Inquisition, a position that paid little and which took up considerable time vetting books for possible heresy. As his health deteriorated in these circumstances, Sigüenza prepared for the eventuality of his death, which came in 1700. A scientist to the end, he requested that his body be autopsied, so that physicians could determine what had afflicted him. He explicitly laid out the reasons and concerned that this radical step might be opposed on religious or other grounds by his relatives, he said \\"I ask in God's name that this [autopsy] be done for the common good, and I command my heir not to interfere, for it matters little that this be done to a body which, within a few days, must be corruption and decay.\\" quoting his translation found in . The autopsy revealed a kidney stone the size of a peach. Sigüenza left his library and scientific instruments to the Jesuit Colegio Máximo de San Pedro y San Pablo in Mexico City. He was buried at the chapel of this Colegio, which could point to his having been reconciled with the Order. Leonard says \\"Whether a deathbed reconciliation fulfilled remains uncertain\\", suggesting that documentary evidence is absent. also doubted that Sigüenza was readmitted to the Jesuits. He also left a number of unpublished manuscripts, only fragments of which survived the expulsion of the Society of Jesus from the viceroyalty in 1767.

Kari is currently a professor at the Department of Mathematics, University of Turku.Staff profile , U. Turku mathematics department, retrieved 2011-09-09. Biography Kari received his Ph.D. in 1990 from the University of Turku; his dissertation, supervised by Arto Salomaa. He married Lila Kari, a later mathematics student at Turku; they divorced, and afterwards Lila Kari became a professor of computer science at the University of Western Ontario in Canada.. Research An aperiodic set of 13 Wang tiles derived from Kari's research Wang tiles are unit squares with colored markings on each side; they may be used to tesselate the plane, but only with tiles that have matching colors on adjoining edges. The problem of determining whether a set of Wang tiles forms a valid tessellation is undecidable, and its undecidability rests on finding sets of Wang tiles that can only tesselate the plane aperiodically, in such a way that no translation of the plane is a symmetry of the tiling. The first set of aperiodic Wang tiles found, by Robert Berger, had over 20,000 different tiles in it. Kari reduced the size of this set to only 14, by finding a set of tiles that (when used to tile the plane) simulates the construction of a Beatty sequence by Mealy machines.. The same approach was later shown to lead to aperiodic sets of 13 tiles, the minimum known.. Kari has also shown that the Wang tiling problem remains undecidable in the hyperbolic plane,. and has discovered sets of Wang tiles with additional mathematical properties.. Kari has also used the Wang tiling problem as the basis of proofs that several algorithmic problems in the theory of cellular automata are undecidable. In particular, in his thesis research, he showed that it is undecidable to determine whether a given cellular automaton rule in two or more dimensions is reversible.. For one-dimensional cellular automata, reversibility is known to be decidable, and Kari has provided tight bounds on the size of the neighborhood needed to simulate the reverse dynamics of reversible one- dimensional automata..

The heads of the family often bore the title consul Romanorum, or \\"Consul of the Romans,\\" in the early days. The family descended from the eleventh-century Jewish convert Leo de Benedicto, whose baptismal name comes from the fact that he was baptised by Pope Leo IX himself.The original convert, according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"Pierleoni,\\" would have been his father, taking the name Benedictus Christianus (\\"Blessed Christian\\"), hence, in the usual way, his son Leo de Benedicto. They also were bankers and financially backed the reform papacy. While the Pierleoni during their greatness spuriously claimed to be descended from the ancient Roman noble family of the Anicii, their enemies in Rome made much of their Jewish extraction and levelled the usual charges of usury. Leo's son was the Peter Leo (Pierleone) of the name and it is his sons that garnered for the family such fame as protectors of the popes: Pope Urban II died in one of the Pierleoni's castelli, July 1099. The family's territory was expanded to include the Isola Tiberina and a further tower house near the Theater of Marcellus.Jewish Encyclopedia: \\"Pierleoni\\". When Emperor Henry V came to Rome (1111), Petrus Leonis headed the papal legation that effected a reconciliation between the pope and the emperor. Pope Paschal II made Pierleone's son, Peter Peirleone, a cardinal, as well as bestowing the Castel Sant'Angelo on Petrus. Pierleone's attempt to install one of his sons as Prefect of Rome in 1116, though favoured by Paschal II, was resisted by the opposite party with riot and bloodshed. Peter, would later become Antipope Anacletus II (1131), and another, Giordano Pierleoni, with the revival of the Commune of Rome, became the head of the Republic as Patricius in 1144. The family generally supported the papacy and represented the Guelf faction of the city against the Ghibellines, often under the leadership of the Frangipani. Two branches of the Pierleoni are still in existence. The first is that of Matelica and Pesaro in the Marche and the second is that of Città di Castello in Umbria. Both are still members of the Italian nobility. Notes References *Lanciani, Rodolfo A. New Tales of Ancient Rome (New York: Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 1902). *Williams, George L.

It is also the only business route of a U.S. Highway in Louisiana that is not derived from a former alignment of its parent route. US 90 Bus. was newly constructed between 1954 and 1960 while the parallel section of US 90 has remained largely unchanged since 1936. US 90 Bus. initially heads eastward along the Westbank Expressway, serving a number of suburban communities in Jefferson Parish located on the west bank of the Mississippi River. These include Westwego, Marrero, Harvey, and Gretna, the parish seat. After transitioning from a surface route to an elevated freeway in Marrero, US 90 Bus. traverses a high- level bridge over the Harvey Canal, a link in the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, while the frontage roads pass through the Harvey Tunnel. Shortly after entering an area of New Orleans known as Algiers, US 90 Bus. curves due west onto the Crescent City Connection, a twin-span cantilever bridge across the Mississippi River. The highway continues alongside the downtown area as part of the elevated Pontchartrain Expressway to a complex interchange with I-10 and mainline US 90 adjacent to the Superdome. The entirety of US 90 Bus. is intended to become part of I-49 once that highway is extended along the present US 90 corridor from Lafayette to New Orleans. In the meantime, the route carries the designation of Future I-49, as approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials in 1999. While the Federal Highway Administration approved the existing freeway portion of US 90 Bus. to be signed as Interstate 910 in the interim, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development did not follow through with an application to the AASHTO's U.S. Route Numbering Committee, and the designation remains unused. Route description =Westwego to Harvey Canal= From the west, US 90 Bus. begins at a modified trumpet interchange with US 90 in a sparsely developed area of Jefferson Parish surrounded by the suburban city of Westwego, Bayou Segnette State Park, and an industrial area formerly known as Avondale Shipyard. Mainline US 90 connects with Boutte to the west and the Huey P. Long Bridge across the Mississippi River to the east (geographically north). Due to the proximity of the BNSF/Union Pacific Railroad overpass on eastbound US 90, the ramp from westbound US 90 Bus. travels in an indirect fashion and intersects an eastbound ramp at grade at a four-way stop. As a result, a significant amount of local traffic circumvents this movement by turning onto Nine Mile Point Road toward a signalized intersection with US 90 that features a protected no-stop turn lane. US 90 Bus. heads southeast along the Westbank Expressway as a divided four-lane highway and intersects Segnette Boulevard, the entrance to the Alario Center and Bayou Segnette State Park. Soon afterward, US 90 Bus. widens to six lanes, and the median width increases from to . Upon entering the city of Westwego, US 90 Bus. becomes a developed commercial corridor, and an intersection with LA 18 Spur (Louisiana Street) provides a route for truck traffic to the industrial facilities along the riverfront. The highway crosses from Westwego into the unincorporated community of Marrero immediately past Victory Drive and curves due east, maintaining a parallel trajectory to the Mississippi River. At Carmadelle Street, several blocks past a signalized intersection with Westwood Drive, a ramp leads through traffic onto an elevated six-lane freeway, which begins in the median. The ground-level portion of the Westbank Expressway continues straight ahead as frontage roads serving local businesses and maintains a six- lane capacity. After a short distance, the first in a series of tight diamond interchanges, exit 4A, connects with Ames Boulevard. As it is located near the west end of the freeway, the interchange consists only of an eastbound entrance and westbound exit with the remaining movements accessed from the frontage roads. The following exit (4B) connects with LA 45 (Barataria Boulevard) and leads to Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve as well as several communities situated alongside Bayou Barataria. This exit also serves the nearby West Jefferson Medical Center. US 90 Bus. proceeds through the neighboring unincorporated community of Harvey, which is bisected by the Harvey Canal, a link in the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. An industrial corridor flanks the canal and stretches from the Mississippi River southward into Plaquemines Parish near Belle Chasse. A half-diamond interchange at exit 5 (MacArthur Avenue) serves the industrial area on the west bank of the canal. The highway elevates to a height of to cross the canal while the frontage roads pass underneath it via the Harvey Tunnel. Direct access to the facilities on the east side of the canal, situated along LA 3017 (Peters Road), is limited to a westbound exit ramp. =Harvey Canal to Mississippi River= East of the Harvey Canal, US 90 Bus. heads northwest, returning to its prior elevation and connecting to Manhattan Boulevard via exit 6. It then enters the city of Gretna, the seat of Jefferson Parish government. Two interchanges serve Gretna: exit 7 to LA 18/LA 23 (Lafayette Street) and exit 8 to Stumpf Boulevard. Between these two exits, the expressway frontage roads run concurrent with LA 23, which continues northwest onto Stumpf Boulevard. While passing alongside the Oakwood Center shopping mall, US 90 Bus. enters into its final interchange on the west bank: exit 9 to Terry Parkway and General de Gaulle Drive. These are parallel divided thoroughfares, the former serving the mall and adjacent neighborhood of Terrytown. The first portion of the exit is a tight half-diamond interchange consisting of an eastbound exit and westbound entrance that utilize the frontage roads to connect with both thoroughfares. Immediately after crossing Terry Parkway, US 90 Bus. enters Orleans Parish and the city of New Orleans, which are co-extensive. All remaining movements on exit 9 are provided via a partial cloverleaf interchange at General de Gaulle Drive with flyover ramps connecting to Terry Parkway, and the US 90 Bus. frontage roads are discontinued at this point. General de Gaulle Drive is part of LA 428 and is the principal thoroughfare of Algiers, a name applied to the west bank section of New Orleans. The highway curves due west to begin its ascent onto the Crescent City Connection, a pair of cantilever bridges each carrying four lanes of through traffic across the Mississippi River. Additionally, the eastbound (geographically westbound) span contains two reversible HOV lanes, separated from the main travel lanes by a row of Jersey barriers. Due to the bend in the Mississippi River from which the \\"Crescent City\\" gets its name and the orientation of the bridges, the remainder of US 90 Bus. carries traffic signed \\"eastbound\\" and \\"westbound\\" in geographically opposite directions. =Downtown New Orleans= The Crescent City Connection carries US 90 Bus. into downtown New Orleans After climbing to a height of above the Mississippi River, US 90 Bus. enters the New Orleans Central Business District and crosses over the city's Convention Center. The highway simultaneously engages in an interchange with Tchoupitoulas Street at exit 11A, the designated exit for truck traffic associated with the Port of New Orleans. (This exit is signed westbound as exit 11 to Tchoupitoulas and South Peters Streets.) US 90 Bus. proceeds northwest onto the Pontchartrain Expressway, an elevated six-lane freeway in the center of Calliope Street, a divided surface street. Several overlapping interchanges with limited movements further serve the business district, beginning with exit 12A (Camp Street), which passes between the National World War II Museum and Lee Circle. This is followed by exit 12D (Carondelet Street/St. Charles Avenue). In addition to being a significant downtown street, St. Charles Avenue is a scenic oak tree-lined boulevard that traverses uptown neighborhoods such as the Garden District and Carrollton. Exit 12C connects with Loyola Avenue, a divided downtown thoroughfare that provides access to the Union Passenger Terminal and the city's two major entertainment venues—the Superdome and New Orleans Arena. At Loyola Avenue, Calliope Street becomes Earhart Boulevard, which serves as a frontage road for a short distance until US 90 Bus. departs from its alignment. US 90 Bus. enters into a complex interchange with both US 90 (South Claiborne Avenue) and I-10. Separate ramps connect to westbound US 90 (exit 13A), eastbound US 90 (13B), and eastbound I-10 (13C). To the east, US 90 travels beneath the elevated I-10 as it passes through the downtown area en route to Slidell, located on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain. Following exit 13C, eastbound US 90 Bus. continues straight ahead to merge with westbound I-10, which swings to the northwest to proceed along the Pontchartrain Expressway toward New Orleans International Airport and the city of Baton Rouge. Locally, westbound I-10 carries traffic between downtown New Orleans and the suburbs in Jefferson and St. Tammany parishes, the latter accessed via the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway. =Route classification and data= US 90 Bus. is classified as an urban freeway by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La DOTD) and carries the internal designation of US 90-Z. Annual average daily traffic data collected by the department in 2019 showed a low of 38,818 vehicles near Westwego, increasing to a peak of 163,126 vehicles on the Mississippi River bridge. The remainder of the route through downtown New Orleans maintained at least 100,000 vehicles to the junction with I-10. The posted speed limit is along the surface portion of the route, increasing to throughout the west bank freeway portion. The remainder of the route across the Crescent City Connection and along the Pontchartrain Expressway is generally posted at . The portion of US 90 Bus. between the Lafayette Street and Camp Street exits serves as a link in the ten-state National Scenic Byway known as the Great River Road. History The Crescent City Connection and the New Orleans skyline The three main elements that constitute the route of US 90 Bus. in New Orleans—the Westbank Expressway, the Crescent City Connection, and the Pontchartrain Expressway—were initially conceived between the 1920s and 1940s as separate projects. =Early planning= In 1926, New Orleans visionary George A. Hero and engineer Allen S. Hackett proposed the construction of a bridge across the Mississippi River located in downtown New Orleans. At the time, there was no automobile bridge spanning the river south of Memphis, Tennessee. While its construction was authorized by the United States Congress the following year, the project languished in the face of the Great Depression. In 1935, the Huey P. Long Bridge was completed in neighboring Jefferson Parish about upriver from the city's business district. This bridge was constructed and financed jointly between the Louisiana Highway Commission and the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad primarily to accommodate railroad traffic, which up to that time was forced to cross the river by ferry between the rail yards at Avondale and Harahan. While it contained automobile lanes that benefited through traffic on US 90 through the area, the bridge's location made it inconvenient for local travel between New Orleans and the developing communities on the opposite side of the river. While increasingly outmoded, the string of existing ferry services along the Mississippi River would continue to serve this purpose for another two decades. Before the existence of the Westbank Expressway, the only highway traversing the west bank communities between US 90 and Algiers was former State Route 30, a narrow two-lane highway that zigzagged through the center of each town. This route is now generally followed by the modern LA 18, which was created in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. During the 1930s, this once rural area was transformed into a booming industrial corridor focused along the Mississippi River and the Harvey Canal, which had become a link in the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. By 1942, the existing highway had become heavily congested, and the draw bridge crossing of the Harvey Canal was specifically cited as one of the worst traffic bottlenecks in the entire state. That year, the Jefferson Parish Police Jury and a committee of local citizens began to lobby the state highway department to alleviate the problem by constructing a new four-lane highway parallel to the existing Route 30. The proposed bypass would extend from US 90 near the Huey P. Long Bridge to the Algiers Naval Station. It would also feature a bridge across the Harvey Canal with a higher draw span, allowing most marine traffic to pass underneath without impeding the flow of vehicular traffic. In 1946, the Louisiana Department of Highways engaged New York-based urban planner, Robert Moses, to study traffic patterns in the New Orleans metropolitan area and compile a report to address current and future transportation needs. Moses devised a multi-phase plan that incorporated both the downtown bridge proposal and the west bank bypass highway. The plan also included the Pontchartrain Expressway, another project discussed for many years involving the construction of a modern highway connecting the downtown area with US 61 (Airline Highway), the main route to the state capital. Moses' plan combined these elements into a continuous traffic artery and provided cost estimates as well as engineering evaluations by the New York firm of Andrews and Clark. Eight more years would pass, however, before construction on these projects would begin. =Construction= The first project that would eventually become part of US 90 Bus. was underway in June 1954 with the construction of the Harvey Tunnel. Approved by the Louisiana Department of Highways in October 1951, the tunnel had replaced the earlier idea of a bridge across the Harvey Canal. Although the more expensive option, the tunnel would be quicker to build and could be used as a bomb shelter in case the Cold War were to heat up. Construction of the Westbank Expressway began in the vicinity of the Harvey Canal and forged a path largely along the southern edge of the west bank's existing development. It was originally configured as a divided four-lane surface highway with interchanges at US 90 and Victory Drive (now General de Gaulle Drive). Intersections were provided at major cross streets between these points while two-lane frontage roads provided access to all services and remaining cross streets. The frontage roads began at Louisiana Street in Westwego and continued to the Victory Drive interchange in Algiers, interrupted only at the Harvey Tunnel, through which only the central express lanes traveled. On September 5, 1957, the Harvey Tunnel was opened to traffic and was touted as the first fully automatic underwater vehicular tunnel in the world. Completion of the tunnel was more than 20 months behind schedule due to unexpected soil and cofferdam difficulties. Also placed into service were the adjacent portions of the West Bank Expressway extending west to Barataria Boulevard in Marrero and east to Franklin Avenue in Gretna. A newly reconstructed and improved Franklin Avenue carried through traffic into Algiers at this time. The Greater New Orleans Bridge, now the westbound (geographically eastbound) span of the Crescent City Connection, began construction in early 1955. The bridge was designed by Modjeski and Masters, the firm responsible for the earlier Huey P. Long Bridge upriver. When opened to traffic in April 1958, the Greater New Orleans Bridge was declared as having the longest cantilever structure in the United States and third longest in the world, its central span totaling . The bridge originally contained a roadway that carried two travel lanes in either direction. The cost of the bridge was approximately $54 million, to be recouped by tolls collected at a toll plaza located at its west bank approach. (The tolls were later removed by Governor John McKeithen in 1964.) Also opened was the first section of the Pontchartrain Expressway, New Orleans' first controlled access freeway, extending from the bridge to an interchange with US 90 (South Claiborne Avenue). The Pontchartrain Expressway also carried four lanes of traffic in its original configuration and contained partial interchanges at Camp Street, St. Charles Avenue, Dryades Street (now O'Keefe Avenue), and Loyola Avenue. After the opening of the Greater New Orleans Bridge, the Louisiana Department of Highways focused on extending its adjoining expressways to their intended termini. The Pontchartrain Expressway was completed between US 90 (South Claiborne Avenue) and US 61 (Airline Highway) in February 1960. During construction, this segment had been incorporated into the new Interstate Highway System as part of I-10 and was signed accordingly by the end of the year. In September 1960, the Westbank Expressway was completed westward from Barataria Boulevard to its interchange with US 90 near Avondale, which involved filling in a section of Westwego's historic Company Canal. With this accomplished, the designation of US 90 Bus. was applied to the entire route comprising the Westbank Expressway, Greater New Orleans Bridge, and the Pontchartrain Expressway as far as the Claiborne interchange, as it now connected with US 90 at either end. Prior to 1960, the entire route carried the state highway designation of LA 3019, which was changed from Route 2200 in the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering. =Later improvements= In December 1972, the I-10 viaduct in the median of South Claiborne Avenue was completed, closing a gap in the interstate's route between the Pontchartrain Expressway and Tulane Avenue. New ramps were added to directly connect the two sections of I-10 and allow through traffic to bypass the Claiborne interchange. However, no direct connection was provided between US 90 Bus. and the new section of I-10 along South Claiborne Avenue. During the 1960s and 1970s, the suburbs of New Orleans continued to grow dramatically, including the communities on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The resulting traffic congestion on the Westbank Expressway led to plans that would ultimately convert most of the route into an elevated controlled-access freeway. This project was carried out in stages beginning in September 1977 with the construction of a high-level bridge across the Harvey Canal. When completed in May 1984, the bridge became the route for through traffic while the frontage roads were reconfigured to utilize the existing Harvey Tunnel. Also placed into service at this time was the first section of the elevated expressway on either end of the bridge, extending from Avenue D in Marrero to Manhattan Boulevard in Harvey. The elevated expressway was completed eastward from Manhattan Boulevard to Lafayette Street in Gretna in January 1985 and to Stumpf Boulevard the following September. After several delays, the portion between Stumpf Boulevard and Terry Parkway was completed in February 1987. By 1993, the elevated Westbank Expressway was completed from the General de Gaulle Drive interchange to its present terminus near Westwood Drive in Marrero. The original expressway lanes had been removed from that point through Westwego during the 1980s, leaving all traffic to utilize the existing service roads, which were improved and widened. As of 2020, plans to complete the expressway through Westwego have not come to fruition, although the route is part of the future extension of I-49. By the 1970s, heavy traffic congestion on the Greater New Orleans Bridge and Pontchartrain Expressway led to the planning of a massive road project that would ultimately become the longest-running in the state's history. Construction began in September 1980 on a parallel span of the Greater New Orleans Bridge designed to carry eastbound traffic on US 90 Bus., freeing the original span to carry four lanes of westbound traffic. The Pontchartrain Expressway was also twinned between the new bridge and the Claiborne interchange, after which the original viaduct was extensively rebuilt. A new exit serving the recently improved Tchoupitoulas Street corridor created a route for truck traffic associated with the Port of New Orleans that had formerly traversed residential uptown neighborhoods. Several ramps accessed directly from neighborhood streets were removed and reconfigured, which was made possible by the construction of new service roads along the expressway. Preservationists celebrated the long- awaited removal of an entrance ramp on Camp Street in the city's historic Lower Garden District, which was replaced by a less conspicuous ramp looping underneath the expressway. Perhaps most significant among the numerous other improvements, new flyover ramps were built to finally provide a direct connection to I-10 east of the Claiborne interchange. For years, motorists had utilized the US 90 east off-ramp to reach I-10 east while performing a dangerous and illegal maneuver that caused numerous accidents and fatalities over the years but was often tolerated by law enforcement out of necessity. The new span of the Greater New Orleans Bridge was completed in 1988, and both spans were collectively renamed the Crescent City Connection the following year. The entire project was completed and opened to traffic in June 1996 after 16 years and an expenditure of approximately $480 million. Future x70px The entire route of US 90 Bus. is planned to become part of I-49, which is currently being extended from Lafayette to New Orleans along the present US 90 corridor. The proposed route south of I-310 in Boutte, which includes US 90 Bus., was officially approved as Future I-49 by the American Association of State Highway Officials on October 1, 1999. Signage identifying the route as such can be seen at various points along the Westbank Expressway. The Federal Highway Administration approved the existing freeway portion of US 90 Bus. to be signed as Interstate 910 in the interim, subject to the approval of the AASHTO's Route Numbering Committee. However, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development did not follow through, and the designation remains unused.

Life and career Luzier was raised in West Newton, Pennsylvania, a small town an hour outside of Pittsburgh on a 118-acre farm. He began playing drums at age five, and participated in high school jazz, concert, and marching bands. After graduating in 1988, Luzier moved to Hollywood, California, to pursue an education at the Musicians Institute. He graduated in 1989 with a degree from MI's Percussion Institute of Technology. Luzier later returned as an instructor at Musicians Institute (1992-2001), where he taught rock-style drumming classes and gave private lessons. Luzier is well known for his work with David Lee Roth, for whom he played drums from 1997 to 2005. Luzier has also played with the Hideous Sun Demons, a progressive-rock/fusion trio formed with DLR bandmembers Toshi Hiketa (guitar) and James LoMenzo (bass). Luzier became the drummer for Steel Panther shortly after the band formed in 1997. He remained with Steel Panther for six years until his DLR touring schedule interfered. In 2004, Luzier released an instructional DVD. It features a wide variety of lessons, including double- kick technique, drum fills, motion exercises, and warm-ups. It was released through Hal Leonard Publishing Co. In January 2006, Luzier appeared at the NAMM in Anaheim, California with Billy Sheehan and Toshi Hiketa. Robert DeLeo and Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots appeared at the same NAMM venue as part of an impromptu band put together by Steve Ferrone. After seeing Luzier's performance, the DeLeo brothers invited Luzier to join Army of Anyone, the band they were putting together with vocalist Richard Patrick of the band Filter. In 2007, after original drummer David Silveria had left (in 2006), Korn hired many touring drummers including Joey Jordison of Slipknot. Jordison left due to preparation for the recording of Slipknot's new album All Hope Is Gone. Consequently, Korn was then looking for a new drummer; and Luzier reportedly flew to Seattle to audition for Korn with James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer and Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu. When told to learn only five of their songs, Luzier learned 30. At his audition, Luzier was immediately invited to join Korn.Ray Luzier audition Youtube.com Retrieved:2009-04-04 Luzier played his first show with Korn on January 13, 2008, in Dublin, Ireland, and played with the band throughout 2008.

It was founded in 1982 and discontinued in 2010. The organisation had close ties with both the European Parliament and the Council of Europe, and was funded by both the European Commission and local and regional governmental organisations. Since its establishment in 1982, the European Bureau for Lesser-Used Languages worked to strengthen contacts and develop mutual co- operation between lesser-used language communities. The main goal was to promote linguistic diversity and to support these languages. It acted to facilitate links and communications with the European institutions, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, and UN and UNESCO. It spoke on behalf of Europe’s 50 million speakers of regional or minority languages. EBLUL's operational grant was discontinued by the EU in 2007 despite recommendations from the European Parliament, including the 2003 Ebner Report, and the EU's own evaluation conducted by Ernst and Young that the EU should continue to support the organisation. The cut in funding remains controversial because the 2003 Ebner Report a European Parliament legislative report, which has to be implemented by the EU, recommended that EBLUL continue to receive EU funding. However, with the cut in its core funding EBLUL was finally closed by a decision of its board of directors on 27 January 2010. The main reason given was that \\"the funding mechanism of such an organisational model [was] not suitable in current circumstances\\". EBLUL has since been replaced by the European Language Equality Network (ELEN) the European NGO for lesser-used languages, it gathers most of the former EBLUL members plus many more civil society organisations from across Europe.

The best known of Wotquenne's achievements is his 1905 bibliographical study of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, but he also performed similar services for other composers: Baldassare Galuppi (1900), Christoph Willibald Gluck (1905), and Luigi Rossi (1909).Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954, Vol. IX, p. 368 He also contributed to a complete inventory of the works of a fellow- Belgian, the Liège-born André Grétry. Thanks to Wotquenne's efforts, C. P. E. Bach's pieces came to be known by their \\"Wq\\" numbers. They are now also known by their \\"H\\" numbers, from a new and more thorough catalogue by Eugene Helm (1989).

Plot The plot involves a young English woman named Elizabeth, who, after the death of her father, travels to a convent on a remote island where her mother died after giving birth to her. The convent is populated only by nuns, who practise strange rituals in the catacombs under the building and who seem to hold something at bay down there. A priest is shown in a church studying a strange ancient book. Outside there a violent storm is raging. The church begins to collapse and the priest is impaled by the spike on top of a fallen crucifix. Later a nun is shown bearing a strange pagan amulet to the edge of the sea. As she stands on the cliff she is approached from behind by someone or something that frightens her so much that she falls to her death. The amulet she was carrying is smashed on the rocks but its pieces are shown being recovered by someone who is not identified. 20 years later a young heiress from London, Elizabeth, is traveling to a remote convent to visit her friend. She is shown on a rustic country bus that is full of strange characters. Meanwhile, a young girl in a novice nun's cassock is shown entering a catacomb through a crack in a wall. She watches a sinister ritual where nun's beat themselves with whips and lay face down on the ground in some sort of pattern. The girl is then attacked from behind by someone with a knife. While the ritual continues below the girl is repeatedly stabbed. Her blood flows into a stream which pours out over a large crucifix. Elizabeth arrives at her destination during a heavy rainstorm (which continues through much of the movie) and has to deal with various creepy or insane locals before she finds someone willing to take her on a boat to the island where the convent is located. Elizabeth is greeted by the nuns and taken to the ancient Mother Superior who is blind and communicates through an assistant. She tells the Mother Superior that she is there to see why her father donated money to the convent and if she is willing to continue the charity. She is provided with a room but all her possessions are confiscated until she decides to leave. Shortly after she is befriended by a seemingly innocent novice, Sarah, who is appointed to act as her guide during her stay. Sarah tells her that the friend she came to visit has left the convent and returned to London. Elizabeth reveals to Sarah that she was actually born on the island and lived there until she was seven. Elizabeth and Sarah visit the decaying library of the convent. There they discover an ancient book with sinister images of a demonic creature. They also find a strange painting that features a pair of young girls and a pagan amulet. While Sarah is out of the room looking for more light Elizabeth is attacked by one of the nuns. Elizabeth narrowly escapes when the nun accidentally falls to her death out of an open window. Elizabeth then discovers an entrance into a labyrinth of catacombs beneath the convent. There she spies on a strange procession of nuns carrying burning crosses and a bloody corpse wrapped in a sheet. While following this procession Elizabeth gets lost and wanders into a pit-like room where a blind painter has covered the walls and canvases with enigmatic images. She recognizes one of the faces on the wall as that of her missing friend and realizes that the body the nuns were carrying might well have been hers. The next day she sees a boat leaving the island despite Sarah having told her that there would be no way to reach the mainland for several days. Elizabeth begins to suspect that Sarah might not be as friendly as she appears. She also starts having strange dreams/visions. One involves seeing a crucified nun accompanied by two small girls. Later, she finds the beach covered by thousands of dead fish... she begins eating one before coming to her senses and vomiting. While wandering on the beach one of the villagers shows Elizabeth some photos of her childhood on the island which include another little girl and what seems to be Elizabeth's mother, who had supposedly died in childbirth. Elizabeth goes to her childhood home and questions the old woman who cared for her as a child. Their meeting is interrupted by the nuns when they set fire to the house. Elizabeth escapes but the old woman is hideously burned. Meanwhile Sarah is shown uncovering a piece of the shattered pagan amulet shown in the painting. A nun comes up to stab her but is later shown cut to ribbons and nailed to a chair. The blind painter gives a painting of Elizabeth to the Mother Superior. The old blind woman begins to smudge off the wet paint and reveals a demonic face underneath. Elizabeth makes her way back to the convent. There are dead and dying nuns everywhere. She is attacked by a nun wielding a huge knife but she manages to kill her by bashing her head on the stone floor. Elizabeth descends into the catacombs where she finds more dead nuns. The blind painter is shown using the Mother Superior's blood to paint more strange images on the wall. Elizabeth is then approached by Sarah, who removes the top of her cassock to reveal that much of her body is not human at all. She is not entirely human. It is revealed that Sarah is Elizabeth's sister but that she more closely resembles their mother. Their mother is actually the demon depicted in the book and on the pagan amulet. The nuns were trying to prevent Elizabeth from realizing her heritage and attempting to free her demon-mother from the walled up crypt she is trapped in. The two women had previously tried to free their demon-mother when they were children but Elizabeth had gotten scared and ran away. She and her father fled the island but it is presumed Sarah has been there ever since, waiting for her to return and complete the ceremony. Now the grown-up Sarah and Elizabeth begin the ritual again. The pieces of the shattered amulet are placed on the ground by a captured nun. Elizabeth eviscerates the nun and the falling blood causes the broken amulet to become whole again. The women raise the blood-soaked amulet and their demon-mother begins to break free of her prison. Just like before Elizabeth becomes terrified and throws the amulet... shattering it into pieces again. Sarah goes to the demon-mother while Elizabeth runs away. At the end of the movie Elizabeth is shown on the beach of the island. She is now in a nun's habit and putting on a necklace made of the center fragment of the shattered amulet. Her white eyes now look like those of the blind Mother Superior's. The film ends with the words \\"For those who are blind shall see the true face of the beast, and forever suffer it in their soul.\\" Cast *Louise Salter as Elizabeth *Venera Simmons as Sarah *Maria Kapnist as Mother Superior Production The film was originally based on a short story by Andy Bark, inspired by a childhood visit to Staithes in North Yorkshire. Many years later, having worked as editor on Mariano's film, Caruncula, he mentioned that he was working on a script called Dark Waters and he and Mariano began to work on it together. The film, perhaps the first Western film to be shot in Ukraine following the collapse of the Soviet Union, was difficult and troubled one. The system there created many problems, but provided spectacular yet cheap sets and locations that would have been impossible to get in the UK. The political situation tried its best to halt the production. In the early days, when finance was being sought by Bark and Mariano, a coup attempt that saw tanks on the streets of Moscow could not have helped matters. There was even another coup at the end of filming when Mariano, in Moscow for the dubbing, was awoken by gun fire. In Chapter 5 of his autobiography Its Only A Movie, Mark Kermode gives a detailed account of his attempts to file a set report on the movie, which were constantly frustrated by travel problems in and around Ukraine. Release A Blu-ray version was released on April 11, 2017 in North America. Reception Jon Condit from Dread Central awarded the film a score of 4 out of 5, commending the film's atmosphere. Robert Firsching from Allmovie offered the film similar praise, writing, \\"the most exciting genre debut of the decade, Dark Waters is a stylish, frightening occult film with the Lovecraftian overtones of Lucio Fulci and the visual flair of Dario Argento, pointing to its creator, Mariano Baino, as perhaps the next great Italian horror director.\\" References External links  1994 films 1994 horror films British films 1990s supernatural horror films British supernatural horror films Demons in film Films set on islands Films shot in Ukraine Gothic horror films Russian films Russian supernatural horror films ","title":"Dark Waters (1994 film)"},{"id":"5009453","text":"Mary Clark Thompson (1835 – July 28, 1923), born Mary Lee Clark, was a noted philanthropist and wife of banker Frederick Ferris Thompson. Early years Mary Lee Clark was born in Naples, New York in 1835 to Myron Holley Clark (1806–1892) and Zilpha (née Watkins) Clark (1806–1877). She moved with her family to Canandaigua, New York when she was about two years old. She attended various schools in Ontario County, including the Ontario Female Seminary. Mary's father Myron was elected Governor of New York State in 1855, and the family took up residence in Albany, the state's capital. Personal life Porcelain teacup, bequest of Mary Clark Thompson to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1923Flemish Cup, bequest of Mary Clark Thompson to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1923 While in Albany, Mary met her future husband, Frederick Ferris Thompson, son of prominent New York banker John Thompson. The couple were married on June 17, 1857 in Canandaigua. Frederick, his brother Samuel, and their father founded First National Bank of the City of New York (a predecessor to today's Citibank) and Chase National Bank of the City of New York (a predecessor to today's JPMorgan Chase Bank). Although the Thompson's principal residence was at 283 Madison Avenue in New York City, the couple spent their summers in Mary's girlhood home of Canandaigua on an estate they purchased in 1863. The estate was named Sonnenberg (means \\"sunny hill\\" in German) when they purchased it. In 1885, they tore down the farmhouse and replaced it with a 40-room Queen-Anne style mansion. =Philanthropy and later life= The Thompsons became generous benefactors to multiple organizations and established themselves as philanthropists. Some of the more notable institutions benefited by Thompson endowments and donations include Williams College, Vassar College, and Teacher's College (now Columbia University). Mrs. Thompson was one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and a great benefactor to the Bronx Zoo and Woman's Hospital. Her husband died in 1899 at age 62 in New York City, and Mary continued to make Sonnenberg her summer home. She continued to give generously to civic, religious, and educational institutions, though her philanthropic work focused principally on the community in which she lived. In Canandaigua, she established and built the F.F. Thompson Hospital in 1903 and the Woodlawn Cemetery chapel, and a swimming school on the shore of Canandaigua Lake. She established a retirement home which she named Clark Manor House after her parents. She donated land and money for the city's post office, and contributed heavily to the local Ontario County historical society, the Wood Library, and numerous local churches. Her interests also included enjoyment of gardens, and she had nine formal gardens built at Sonnenberg. Often she would allow the public to come on the property and walk through her gardens. Mary died on July 28, 1923 at age 87 at Sonnenberg. Mary and Frederick, who had no children, are both interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Canandaigua. =Honors and Legacy= She also maintained an interest in preserving the history of Native Americans in the New York area, and made multiple contributions to the State Museum in Albany for that purpose. In 1920 she was awarded the Cornplanter Medal for her work in this field. Her home, Sonnenberg, is preserved and operated as a historic house museum. The Mary Clark Thompson Medal is named for her. It has been awarded since 1921 by the American National Academy of Sciences for work in geology and paleontology.

Trịnh Tùng is the first official Trịnh Lord, although his father – Trịnh Kiểm – was de facto ruler of Dai Viet before him, Trịnh Kiểm never claimed himself as Trịnh Lord. Therefore Trịnh Kiểm is not considered as the first Trịnh Lord. Trịnh Tùng was reputed to be from the first generation of the Trịnh lords who ruled Vietnam from 1545 to 1789, however, since he was so young when the family first came to power, Trịnh Tùng theoretically belonged to the second generation. The Trịnh family wielded the military power of the country and took turns as regents to the figurehead Lê kings who nominally reigned over the country. Trịnh Kiểm, Tùng's father, was given the title of 'Duke' during his life and after his death was conferred with the title of Thái Vương, which means \\"Great Prince\\". From the time of Trịnh Tùng onwards, members of the Trịnh family were given the title of Prince while in power. Also known with the title of Lord, they had the right to choose the crown prince and had power over political and military matters. During his rule, the war with the Mạc dynasty was successfully completed. History Trịnh Tùng was the second son of Trịnh Kiểm. In 1572, upon the death of his father, Trịnh Tùng's elder brother, Trịnh Cối, took command. Immediately challenged by Trịnh Tùng, Trịnh Cối lost a battle to the Mạc, and thus Trịnh Tùng took control of the situation. He proved to be a very capable leader and in 1571, the Lê Loyalist Army captured the Eastern capital Hanoi from emperor Mạc Mậu Hợp. However, a counteroffensive the next year drove them out. In the midst of this reversal, the nominal Lê emperor, Lê Anh Tông, fled to Nghệ An Province. Trịnh Tùng appointed a new emperor (Lê Thế Tông), and had the previous king assassinated. The war against the Mạc continued for the next twenty years until 1592, when the Eastern Capital(Dong kinh) was reconquered. Mạc Mậu Hợp was captured during the retreat and subsequently executed. Further military actions took place against the army of the Mạc in the years 1593 and 1594. The Royal (Trịnh) army was lent assistance in this battle by Tung's uncle Nguyễn army. In formal recognition for his defeat of the Mạc, Trịnh Tùng was given the title Pacifying Prince (Bình An Vương) in 1599. In 1619, Emperor Lê Kinh Tông, and Tùng's own son, Trịnh Xuân schemed against Trịnh Tùng so the emperor could reclaim actual Imperial power but the plot was discovered, the emperor was forced to garrotte himself and a new emperor was put in his place (Lê Thần Tông). This led Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên to a formal ending of his relations with the court which, after seven more years, led to the Trịnh–Nguyễn War. By 1623, Trịnh Tùng was growing old. He tried to secure his succession by dividing rule between his two sons in order to avoid conflict. His attempt was not successful. :\\"Jealousy broke out in his family even before his death, as not only both his sons but also one of his brothers tried to (take) his power. Trịnh Tùng was taken ill to his brother's house and there his younger son was murdered. The elder, called Trịnh Tráng, hearing of this, ran away to the province of Thanh Hóa, taking with him the king and the royal family. Trịnh Tùng was then driven away from his brother's place, and, abandoned by the servants who had carried him away in a sedan chair, died alone on the road.

He was born in Baja. The main theme of his poetry was love. He studied at the Franciscan Gymnasium (now Béla III High School) in Baja between 1839 and 1845. Tóth was the best student in his class. He was a novice for a short time, but then started to study law. He took part in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. After the failure of the revolution, he tried to raise national self-confidence and to cherish the ideals of the revolution. He remembered its heroes in his poetry. He became the sub-editor of Ignác Nagy's (English: Ladies' Courier). He was the accountable editor of it between 1856 and 1861. In 1860, Tóth launched a political newspaper, (English: Crazy Michael). From 1864 he was the editor of the (English: Metropolitan Pages).

Barrels are blue, bolts are green. A telescoping bolt (also known as an overhung bolt) is a firearm bolt which telescopes over, that is, wraps around and past, the breech end of the barrel. This feature reduces the required length of a weapon such as a submachine gun significantly, and it allows rifle designs to be balanced around the pistol grip in a way that gives \\"pointability\\" similar to a pistol's. While it would be simpler and easier to shorten the bolt to fit completely behind the breech, the bolt must have a certain amount of mass in order to operate reliably with a given caliber. The telescoping bolt moves some of that mass forward of the bolt face, resulting in a bolt which may be longer overall, but is shorter behind the bolt face. Though technically a different, distinct concept, nearly all telescoping bolt submachine guns use a magazine located in the pistol grip used to hold and fire the weapon. However, there are blowback firearms with the magazine located in the grip that don't use a telescoping bolt, such as Kel-Tec SUB-2000. History The telescoping bolt concept first appeared on semi-automatic handguns, such as the M1911-series pistol produced for the U.S. Army. These pistols feature a slide, which acts as both a barrel shroud and the bolt. The first production model submachine gun using the telescoping bolt concept was the Czechoslovak Cz 23 aka Sa.23 or vz.48b series, first produced in 1948. These submachine guns use a cylindrical telescoping bolt with centered barrel. While widely exported in the third world, the Cz 23 series was not well known in the west.Back to the Roots , Monty Mendenhall, at , accessed Jan 10, 2007 The first popularly well- known example was the Uzi submachine gun, designed in Israel by Uziel Gal, a designer inspired by the Cz 23 series. It uses a rectangular bolt, with a barrel which is offset toward the bottom of the bolt. This configuration places the axis of recoil lower, increasing the controllability of the weapon in full-automatic fire. The Uzi was designed in 1948 after the first models of the Cz 23 were seen, and entered service in 1954 (after official adoption in 1951). The telescoping bolt has subsequently been used in a wide variety of submachine gun designs. Comparisons As the image diagrams demonstrate, the basic concept of a telescoping bolt with the magazine well in the handgrip produces significantly more compact weapons. These diagrams show the 1938 design (1939 service) MP-40 submachine gun, which is 630 mm (25 inch) long with the stock folded, weighing four kilograms (8.8 pounds) and having a 251 mm (9.9 inch) barrel, and the (similar materials and production technology) Uzi, a 1948 design (1951 adoption with 1954 service), which is 470 mm (19 inch) long with the stock folded, weighing 3.5 kilograms (7.7 pounds) and having a 260 mm (10.2 inch) barrel. Utilizing nothing more than a configuration change, and the same materials and fabrication technologies, the Uzi is thus 500 grams (1.1 lb) lighter and 160 mm (6 inches) shorter.

It provides both on- demand and scheduled scanning. The project was started by Dave Mauroni in February 2004 and remains under development. ClamTk was originally written using the Tk widget toolkit, for which it is named, but it was later re- written in Perl, using the GTK toolkit. The interface has evolved considerably over time and recent versions are quite different than early releases, adding features and changing the interface presentation. It is dual-licensed under the GNU General Public License version 1 or later, and the Artistic License. Features Early release of ClamTk from 2005 Ubuntu 8.04 Ubuntu 9.04 Ubuntu 11.04 The ClamTk interface allows scanning of single files or directories. It can be configured for recursive scans, scanning all sub- directories, for whitelists, to scan for potentially unwanted applications (PUAs), to exclude hidden files, or large files over 20 MB. In 2017 GHacks reviewer Mike Turcotte-McCusker noted the high rate of false positives that the PUA-inclusive scans return. The history selection allows reviewing the results of previous scans and quarantined files. ClamTk allows manual or automatic updates to be configured for ClamAV's virus definitions. The application interfaces with thunar-sendto-clamtk, nemo-sendto-clamtk, clamtk- gnome and clamtk-kde, each of which provide context menu functionality for the associated file managers, Thunar, Nemo, GNOME Files and Dolphin, allowing users to directly send files to ClamTk for scanning. ClamTk can also be run from the command-line interface, although the main reason that command line access exists is for interface with the various file managers. Use ClamTk has been included in the repositories of many Linux distributions, including ALT Linux, Arch Linux, CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Linux Mint, Mandriva, openSUSE, PCLinuxOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Ubuntu, as well as FreeBSD. Most users install ClamTk from the repositories of the Linux distribution that they are using, but the application's website also provides downloads for the latest release versions, in the form of .rpm and .deb files. Reception A 2014 review of ClamTk 5.0.7 by Silviu Stahie of Softpedia recommended the application as a means of getting ClamAV functionality in an easy-to-use graphical interface. He wrote, \\"basically, all functions of ClamTK can be performed in a terminal with ClamAV. That would be fine if you had no desktop environment, like on a server, but there is no reason to use the terminal in a regular Linux distribution.\\" A 2015 review by Bill Toulas on the How To Forge noted that ClamTk seemed to take a comparable amount of time to scan as ClamAV, indicting that it wasn't slowing the scanning engine down. A 2017 review in Linux and Ubuntu said, \\"ClamTK provides a very simple GUI that allows beginners who are not most comfortable to use CLI. Upon launching ClamTk, you will be presented with a clean GUI with 4 main sections.\\" In Ubuntu Pit's listing of the Best Linux Antivirus: Top 10 Reviewed and Compared, ClamtK was recommended for average users and described as \\"lightweight\\". A 2019 review in Make Tech Easier included ClamTk in its review of The Best Antivirus Programs for Ubuntu. They reported, \\"If you need a good virus scanner, and you’re not a fan of the command line, ClamTk is the best choice.\\" A rewiew by Derrik Diener of Additive Tips in 2019 stated, \\"... if you like the features of the ClamAV tool, but dislike dealing with the command-line, you’ll get the same useful features in a nice, easy-to-use interface ...

It was directed by Michael Ritchie and starred Holly Hunter, Swoosie Kurtz and Beau Bridges. It is based on the true story of Wanda Holloway, a woman who tried to put out a hit on one of her daughter's classmates (and the girl's mother) to advance her own daughter's middle school cheerleading career. Holly Hunter won the Emmy Award for Best Actress in a TV Movie for playing Wanda Holloway and Beau Bridges won both the Emmy and the Golden Globe Awards for Supporting Actor in a TV Movie for his portrayal of Terry Harper, Holloway's brother-in-law whom she contacted to arrange the hit. Plot When Wanda Holloway was a teen, her father forbade her from trying out for her school's cheerleading team. Many years later, when Wanda had a daughter of her own, she was determined that her daughter would fulfill the dream she was denied and become a cheerleader—which would allow Wanda to make up that part of her childhood by reliving it through her daughter. The film takes place in Channelview, Texas. Wanda enrolls her daughter, Shanna, in various dance and gymnastics classes in order to enhance her prospects of becoming a cheerleader. She forces Shanna to practice for hours on end, despite sickness or injury. Wanda's best friend, Verna Heath, and her daughter, Amber, live next door to the Holloway family. Amber is the same age as Shanna and the two teenagers become friends. Verna had been a successful varsity twirler when she was young and holds the same ambition as Wanda for her own daughter. Leading up to the cheerleading tryouts, jealousy sparks between Wanda and Verna, despite the fact that their daughters' friendship remains solid. In the months prior to the tryouts, Wanda forces Shanna to concentrate completely on cheer-leading. At the tryouts, Amber impresses the judges but Shanna is unable to, despite all of her training. Amber makes the squad and Shanna does not, disappointing both Shanna and Wanda. The fact that Shanna did not make it onto the team causes Wanda to end the friendship between Shanna and Amber. Wanda does not give up on seeing her daughter become a cheerleader, and decides to try again next year. Every day until next year's tryouts, Shanna practices frequently at her mother's command. When the time arrives, Amber makes the team and is even promoted to co-captain, but Shanna is disqualified because of her mother's attempts to bribe the judges and other students. The shock of her daughter's failure for the second time puts Wanda into a mad fit of rage, anger and jealousy. Wanda decides that if it wasn't for Amber, Shanna would have definitely been a cheerleader. She becomes obsessed with the notion that living next door to talented Amber had sapped Shanna's confidence and ruined her chances of success. Wanda meets her brother-in-law Terry to take a hit out on Amber and Verna. Terry is horrified by Wanda's hate for a thirteen-year-old girl, and disagrees with the murder of a young vibrant girl—especially over something as petty as cheerleading. After the rendezvous, Terry decides to turn Wanda in to the police. He meets Wanda again, this time with a tape recorder in order to obtain proof of Wanda's desire to commit homicide. Terry sends the recorded message, along with background information, to the police. Wanda is arrested and sentenced to fifteen years in prison, but is set free when it is discovered that a member of the jury at her trial was on probation. Wanda serves only six months for the attempted murder of Amber. In the end, Shanna decides it would be best to quit trying out for the cheerleading team. Presently, Shanna and Wanda reside in California, where Shanna is taking classes in modelling, singing and acting. Wanda hopes that one day, her daughter will be a famous Hollywood actress, no matter what it takes. Reception Reception for the film was positive. Entertainment Weekly film critics Rob Gonsalves and Filmcritic.com's Christopher Null praised the movie, with Null stating \\"the movie gets its real kick when it comes time for everyone to sell their rights to Hollywood... with one writer remarking she has 'Holly Hunter' in mind for the lead.\\"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom Filmcritic.com However, People magazine's review stated that the movie \\"has two good performances\\" but that it \\"just doesn't seem to have much point.\\" Television critic Matt Zoller Seitz in his 2016 book co-written with Alan Sepinwall titled TV (The Book) named the film as the 2nd greatest American TV-movie of all time, behind Steven Spielberg's Duel.

Elvira was a legitimate daughter of Alfonso VI, king of León and Castile. Her mother was King Alfonso VI's fourth wife, Isabella. This Isabella is likely identical to Zaida of Seville, the Muslim princess who was Alfonso's mistress before marrying him. Growing up at her father's court in the multiconfessional city of Toledo, Elvira must have been accustomed to a significant level of convivencia, which was present in Sicily as well. In 1117 or 1118, Elvira married Roger II, then count of Sicily and king from 1130. Sicily too had a sizeable Muslim population, and the marriage was part of Roger's plan to emulate the religious policy of Elvira's father. Elvira's likely descent from the Muslim rulers of Al-Andalus exemplifies a \\"pattern of cultural association\\" between the queens of Sicily and the Islamic world. She may have even influenced the extensive cultivation of Islamic art during her husband's reign. There is exceptionally little information about Queen Elvira. She does not appear to have been active in politics or as a church patron, and is chiefly remembered for giving birth to Roger's six children. In addition to a daughter who died young, Elvira and Roger had five sons: *Roger (1118 – 12 May 1148), duke of Apulia (from 1135), possibly also count of Lecce *Tancred (1119 – 1138), prince of Bari (from 1135) *Alfonso (1120/1121 – 10 October 1144), prince of Capua (from 1135) and duke of Naples *William (b. 1131 – d. 7 May 1166), duke of Apulia (from 1148) * Henry (born in 1135, died young) In 1135, both Roger and Elvira fell ill. The illness was grave and infectious. The king survived, but the queen died on 6 February. Roger was devastated by her death; he withdrew to his room and refused to see anyone except his closest servants. Eventually rumors spread that he too had died. Roger remained a widower for fourteen years and remarried only in 1149, as he had outlived four out of five sons he had had with Elvira.

As its name suggests, it is a traditional Victorian era park named after Queen Victoria and has retained much of its original charm. The park was created as a municipal recreation ground by Cardiff City Council through a city charter between 1897 and 1898 to celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee marking her record sixty years on the throne. The park is located on the a small part of the extensive traditional Canton Cross common lands that had originally been used as a substantial fresh food and livestock trading market six days a week from the medieval period. David Petersen The park covers nearly and still contains the original model boating and paddling pool which remains a very popular attraction in summer, plus a playpark for younger children. At the very north of the park there are tennis courts and a synthetic turf field for 5-a-side football. The original 1898 bandstand had fallen into disrepair and had been demolished but, in 1998, a replica of the original bandstand was erected on the original site to mark the park's centennial celebrations. There are many mature trees and blossom trees in spring, together with crocuses and daffodils and flowerbeds that burst with colour during summer. There are wide paths and a refreshment shop by the pool. Public music events, markets and fairs take place throughout the summer months. There is also a whimsical monument to Billy the Seal who lived from 1912 to 1939 in what is now the paddling pool.Victoria Park pool The park is one of the few remaining UK parks where the park keeper still lives in an on-site lodge.

The film stars Vas Blackwood, Robbie Gee, Mark Smith (Gladiator), Simon Webbe and Billy Murray. Small appearances are made from Jason Flemyng, Dizzee Rascal, Rodney P, Kano and Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace. Plot The movie begins with the UK Hip Hop group \\"Time Served\\" getting used to living the high life as rap stars. This all comes crashing down however when one of their members Too Fine is killed in a drive-by because he owes a drug dealer, Temper, money. On returning to her flat after the murder, Too Fine's sister Hope walks in on the same drug dealer looking for his money. After telling her she has two days left to pay or he is going to kill her family, he rapes her and leaves. While this is happening the other two members of the group, Rage and Finny find out that due to being signed as a three-man group, their contract is now void. Under the premise of paying him back, Hope goes to Temper's house with a sawn-off shotgun. After killing him she goes back to Finny's. Knowing that Temper's two side-kicks, Chosen-one and Chronic, will come hunting for her, Finny, Rage and their friend Pushy decide to finish them off. Turning up at their favourite night-club, they kill the two, catching a waitress in the crossfire. Hope is then contacted by big time crime lord David Brumby, who wants the money Temper owed him. She instead convinces him to work with her instead, and with Finny, Rage and Pushy, go into the drug dealing business. While this is going on, DS Andy White is on the case looking for the killers of the night club waitress. White and his cohorts raid a Yardie drug-dealer and find out that Too Fine and Pushy are connected. Knowing this they begin tailing Pushy and his known affiliates, Rage and Finny. Noticing they are being followed on the way to a drug deal, they attempted to give their pursuers the shake. Finny although is captured after their cars rolls off the road and they attempt to get away on foot. In order to avoid going down for multiple offences (White also threatens to have him killed in his cell) he fingers everyone else involved. The police round up everyone involved, including Rage, Pushy and Brumby, but not Hope. Knowing Finny is the grass, Pushy calls Hope, not fully believing him she hangs up on him. Finny then comes round to Hope's to get her to leave London with him. Now knowing the truth she stabs Finny, dumping his body in a car. With his only witness dead, White has to let Rage, Pushy and Brumby go. Thinking they have gotten off, Rage and Pushy go out to celebrate, but get gunned down in the car park of a pub by Brumby's men, on the orders of DS White, who says he'll turn a \\"blind eye\\" to Brumby now. Characters *Finny (Vas Blackwood) - The front man of the group Time Served, he also used to be in an under-ground rap group beforehand. The other members of the group are killed in a drive by, and he later gets arrested for armed robbery. *Too Fine (Simon Webbe) - Before becoming successful in Time Served he used to be a drug dealer, and his unpaid street debts with Temper are what get him killed, and sparks off the whole movie's storyline. *Rage (Roffem Morgan) - Described as a \\"Nasty little bastard\\" he served time in a young offender's institute with Too Fine. *Pushy (Robbie Gee) - A friend of the group but not a member, at the start of the movie he is a small-time marijuana dealer, but joins in with Hope to start selling Brumby's drugs. *Hope (Naomi Taylor) - The sister of Too Fine, she convinces Brumby to go in with her after killing his main dealer Temper. *David Brumby (Billy Murray) - The main drug dealer at the top, he imports the drugs from Holland for Temper, and later Hope to sell. It is possible he is from Essex as DS White says to him, \\"You're a long fucking way from Essex boys\\". *DS Andy White (Terry Stone) - The anti-hero of the film, while he is a corrupt officer, who sells confiscated drugs on the side he is dedicated to helping the people that cannot help themselves. While his methods are questionable and extremely heavy-handed, he gets results.

Etymology  There are two main groups of etymological hypotheses explaining the origins of the biblical rephaim. The first group proposes that this is a native Hebrew language term, which could be derived either from the root רפא or רפה. The first root, רפא, conveys the meaning of healing and is realized in words such as Hebrew rofe (a physician) or refuah (medicine). The second root, רפה, means being weak, powerless.Francis Brown, Samuel Rolles Driver and Charles A. Briggs C.A., A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament (Oxford, 1907/2013) [BDB], (CD-ROM), 9242.Kohler, Ludwig, and Walter Baumgartner. 2002. The Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament. Leiden: Brill [HALOT]. (CD-ROM), 8014.Harris, R. Laird., Gleason L. Archer, and Bruce K. Waltke. 2003. Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament. Chicago: Moody Press [TWOT]. (CD-ROM), 2198d. The second group of etymological hypotheses treat the word rephaim as a loanword from some other ancient Semitic language. Among the proposals is the Akkadian rabu, a prince, but this explanation enjoys rather limited popularity. Far more support has been gained by the hypothesis which derives the Hebrew refaim from the Ugaritic rpum which denotes the semi-deified deceased ancestors who are mentioned in such sources as the so called Rephaim Text (KTU 1:20–22).Lewis, Theodore J. 1999. “Dead.” In Dictionary of Deities and Demons, pp. 223–231.Rouillard-Bonraisin, Hedwige. 1999. “Rephaim.” In Dictionary of Deities and Demons, pp. 692–700. Despite the clash between these hypotheses and although the modern translations clearly distinguish between Rephaites as one of the tribes (e.g. Book of Genesis 14:5; 15:18–21; Book of Deuteronomy 2:11–20) and rephaim as the inhabitants of the underworld (e.g. Book of Isaiah 14:9–11; 26:13–15), the same word is used in the original text. The use of rephaim in the Hebrew Bible suggests that behind the biblical narrative were the legends of some ancient indigenous peoples, who inhabited the valleys of the land of Canaan which was subject to the gradual Hebrew conquest. Canaanite people group In the Hebrew Bible, \\"Rephaites\\" or \\"Rephaim\\" can describe an ancient race of giants in Iron Age Israel, or the places where these individuals were thought to have lived. According to , King Chedorlaomer and his allies attacked and defeated the Rephaites at Ashteroth-Karnaim. Rephaites are also mentioned at ; , ; the Book of Joshua (, , , , ); the Books of Samuel (, ); and the Books of Chronicles (, and ). In the biblical narrative, the Israelites were instructed to exterminate the previous inhabitants of the \\"promised land\\", i.e. Canaan, which include various named peoples, including some unusually tall/large individuals. Several passages in the Book of Joshua, and also , suggest that Og, the King of Bashan, was one of the last survivors of the Rephaim, and that his bed was 9 cubits long in ordinary cubits. (An ordinary cubit is the length of a man's forearm according to the New American Standard Bible, or approximately , which differs from a royal cubit. This makes the bed over long, even longer if the cubit was based on a giant's forearm). Anak, according to , was a Rephaite. The area of Moab at Ar (the region east of the Jordan), before the time of Moses, was also considered the land of the Rephaites. notes that the Ammonites called the Rephaites \\"Zamzummim\\". In , the Moabites referred to them as the \\"Emim\\". Long dead ancestors Rephaim have also been considered the residents of the Netherworld (Sheol in the Hebrew Bible) in more recent scholarship. Possible examples of this usage appear as \\"shades\\", \\"spirits\\" or \\"dead\\" in various translations of the Bible. See: , , ; ; , , ; , and possibly , where Repha'im may be read as “dead ancestors” or \\"weakeners\\", as opposed to Rophe’im, “doctors”. The Heb. root רפא means “heal”, and thus the masculine plural nominalized form of this root may indicate that these “deceased ancestors” could be invoked for ritual purposes that would benefit the living.R. Mark Shipp. Of Dead Kings and Dirges: Myth and Meaning in Isaiah 14:4b-21. 2002 p. 121: \\"It is also possible that the distinction here is not between the Rephaim and non-Rephaim dead kings, but rather between the rpim qdmym (Ulkn, Tr 'limn, Sdn w Rdn, Trmn; the “ancient Rephaim”) and the more recent Rephaim (Ammishtamru, ...\\"Matthew J.

According to this author,\\" Various ancient Northwest Semitic texts are also replete with references to terms evidently cognate with Rephaim as the dead or dead kings.KAI 13.7-8, 14.8, 177.1; CTA 6.6.46-52, CTA 20-22 = KTU 1.161. See the article by M.S. Smith, “Rephaim,” in the Anchor Bible Dictionary. Lewis (1989)T. J. Lewis (professor of Hebrew Bible at Johns Hopkins University), Cults of the Dead in Ancient Israel and Ugarit (Scholars Press, 1989) undertakes a detailed study of several enigmatic funerary ritual texts from the ancient coastal city of Ugarit. Lewis concludes that the “Ugaritic Funerary Text”KTU 1.161 = Ras Shamra 34.126 provides important evidence for understanding Ugarit's cult of the dead, wherein beings called rapi'uma, the long dead, and malakuma, recently dead kings, were invoked in a funeral liturgy, presented with food/drink offerings, and asked to provide blessings for the reign of the current king. The many references to repha'im in the Hebrew Bible in contexts involving Sheol and dead spirits strongly suggests that many ancient Israelites imagined the spirits of the dead as playing an active and important role in securing blessings, healing, or other benefits in the lives of the living.On the role of the dead and burial customs in ancient Israelite society and the cultures of the ancient Levant generally, see L. Bloch-Smith's Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs About the Dead (Continuum, 1992). \\"The link between Titan and poltergeist may very well be adduced from the verb stem, raphah, which means to sink or relax\\" (Levin, 1997, p. 17)[iv] Gabriel Levin, Hezekiah’s Tunnel, 1997, Jerusalem, Ibis See also * Death (personification) * Emek Refaim * Ghost * Guardian angel * Guardian deity * Rujm el-Hiri, also called \\"Gilgal Refaim\\" * Valley of Rephaim Notes Book of Deuteronomy Book of Genesis Book of Isaiah Book of Joshua Books of Chronicles Books of Samuel ","title":"Rephaite"},{"id":"5009572","text":"The 2007 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships was the 71st World Ice Hockey Championship.

Description Beat reporters build up a base of knowledge on and gain familiarity with the topic, allowing them to provide insight and commentary in addition to reporting straight facts. Generally, beat reporters will also build up a rapport with sources that they visit again and again, allowing for trust to build between the journalist and his/her source of information. This distinguishes them from other journalists who might cover similar stories from time to time. Journalists become invested in the beats they are reporting for, and become passionate about mastering that beat.Ryfe, D. M. (2009)Structure, agency, and change in an American newsroom. 665-683 Beat reporters often deal with the same sources day after day, and must return to those sources regardless of their relationship with them.Scanlan, C. (2011). Beat reporting: what does it take to be the best. Poynter Institute. Those sources may or may not be pleased with the reporting of the reporters. It is pertinent that beat reporters contact their sources quickly, obtain all necessary information, and write on deadline. According to media sociologists, beat reporting occurs because of the limited time reporters are given to cover stories.Berkowitz, Daniel A. (1997) Social Meanings of News: A Text-reader. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications For big scoops, beats are not necessarily as useful as other journalism types. Some of the best inside stories, for example Bay of Pigs and Watergate, did not come from beat reporting. Beat reporters collect information from each person they meet while reporting.Galbraith, K. (2010) The Capriciousness of Beats. Nieman Reports, 64(4), 5-6. They routinely call, visit, and e-mail sources to obtain any new information for articles. When reporters have experience on a specific beat, they are able to gain both knowledge and sources to lead them to new stories relating to that beat. Beats are able to help reporters define their roles as journalists, and also avoid overlap of stories within the newsroom. Etymology The term comes from the noun beat in the sense of an assigned regular route or habitual path, as for a policeman. By analogy, the beat of a reporter is the topic they have been assigned for reporting. Similarly, a beat reporter will follow the same routes or habitual paths in collecting new information on a specified topic. The role of the reporter is to deliver the news, show the story according to their perspective and observations, give us the insights, comment on it and to submit the report of the issues on the given period of time. Prizes Several organisations award prizes for beat reporting, of which the Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting, discontinued in 2007, is possibly the best known. Other awards that have a category for beat reporting include the Gerald Loeb Awards, the Canadian National Newspaper Awards, and the SEJ Awards.

Men and women of the Edo people belong to masquerade societies, with their primary belief to control anti-social forces (voodoo, witchcraft, demons, devils, etc.) and help to bring about a better, safer, and well-adjusted community or village. Artists African art and African artists are regarded in a different sense of the word “artist” than what persons from other cultural backgrounds might conceive. An African artist is one who works in many different capacities, rather than just being a “starving artist,\\" of Western lore. Most of these men and women work on farms as laborers and seasonal help. An African artist is highly regarded as a professional who may have become skilled in many mediums, such as wood, metal, leather, mud, wall painting, ceramics, and many other different aspects of creativity. Unlike their counterparts of the United States and Europe, researchers and collectors of art were not so much concerned with the artist’s name and identity, rather than to remember the artist as a well-known member of his or her village or town. Many African artists throughout the years have established themselves with more of a regional reputation, attracting patrons of their craft, who wish to procure commissioned work. According to Lawrence Ajanaku, an African artist, :“No one learns from anyone else how to do it. It is something we are born with. It is the kind of knowledge that remains in the center of our being”.Weigel, S. Africa embodied, language of adornment. Okpella edo masquerade, retrieved March 19, 2006 The best-known of the Edo groups, the Okpella, use a wide, varying range of mask types, which, according to some African artists, may take up to a year to complete. The masks that are created by the artist convey many different types of rituals and ceremonies. One example of this is a brilliant, white-faced mask representing “dead mothers”, appearing during the annual Olimi festival, which is held at the end of the dry season, and is worn by dancing kinsmen. This festival, as others do, signifies social control and ancestral reverence, celebrating the transitions of age-grades.Perani, J. & Smith, F. (1998). The visual arts of Africa; gender, power, and life cycle rituals. Upper Saddle River, NJ. Prentice Hall. The Otsa festival embraces women dancers in addition to the male, the tradition masquerade dancers. The women portray “mothers”, who sponsor new plays and as supporters who perform in concert in between masquerade plays. During the festival, the “mothers” come to the dance area with their masquerades to sprinkle chalk and water, which symbolizes peace and good luck. This festival annually celebrates the feast of Otsa to purify the land and reinforce community solidarity. Forms of Art Many types of masks are used by the Northern Edo. Like most masks created in Africa, it represents the presence of a spirit. The intention behind an African mask is not to depict something realistic or naturalistic, as the African ideal aspires to capture the essence of the spirit represented. Therefore, abstraction and distortion are often seen. When a person wears the mask, that person takes on the entity that the mask represents, they become “one with the mask”, surrendering his body as not his own. The spirit of the mask takes up residence inside the person’s body while on earth. These masks are not considered in such lightheartedness, as a general costume might, they are held in high regard within the multiple communities of Africa. Masquerades are encompassing as a social gathering that encircles dancing and full-body fantastic costume wearing that also includes such masks. Together the people gathered at the event become a “band of spirits”; they are shown honor and reverence during their visitation here on Earth. In addition to the masks and costumes worn during the masquerades, another vital component is the music and dance used to create the atmosphere that is conducive to capturing the essence of the spirit. The highly sophisticated dance helps expand more of the character being portrayed. Throughout the ceremony, the actions of the dancer may be something entirely different from what the person beneath would normally portray. Atmospheric circumstances are another essential element to the success of the masquerade. The right mood and setting add to and enhance the integrity of the performance, inviting the spirits to join. The audience’s participation from the sidelines only adds to the intensity of the masquerade - clapping, singing, and dancing, allowing themselves to feel the spirit’s presence. This strong relationship between human and spirits is the grand hallmark of the Northern Edo Masquerades.

It has about 1,300 inhabitants. It is one of the oldest settlements in Bohemia. Libice nad Cidlinou is located 5 km southeast of Poděbrady at the confluence of the Cidlina and Elbe rivers. History Libice emerged in the 9th century as the capital fort (gord) of the Slavnik family. They were of possible White Croat origin, and their lands were part of White Croatia. Archaeological digs begun in the nineteenth century show that the material culture was highly developed by the end of the first millennium AD. Libice began as a castle, and fortifications and the ruins of a stone church have survived to the present day. In 995 Libice was stormed by Bohemian Duke Boleslaus II (Přemyslid) and the Vršovci clan, who killed most of the Slavnik family and annexed Libice to Prague. Adalbert and Radim survived by taking refuge in land of the Polans under rule of Boleslaw I.

Origin The phrase is used many times in the Bible to describe God's powerful deeds during the Exodus: Exodus 6:6, Deuteronomy 4:34 5:15 7:19 9:29 11:2 26:8, Psalms 136:12. The phrase is also used to describe other past or future mighty deeds of God, in the following sources: II Kings 17:36, Jeremiah 21:5 27:5 32:17, Ezekiel 20:33 20:34, II Chronicles 6:32. A shortened version (\\"with a strong hand\\") is also used to refer to the Exodus: in Exodus 3:19 6:1 13:9 13:16 32:11 among other places. In Exodus In Exodus 6 (Parshat Va'eira in the Torah), Moses has just reiterated to God the complaint of the Israelites that things have gotten worse for them every time he has gone to Pharaoh on their behalf; in this case, Pharaoh has ruled that they shall henceforward make bricks without straw. God replies to Moses that the time will come when Pharaoh himself will drive the Israelites out of Egypt, and that, on behalf of his covenant with the Patriarchs, God will redeem the Israelites with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, so that they will know him. Moses and Aaron did not reply directly to the Israelites regarding their complaint, but when Moses conveys this reply from God to the Israelites, it fails to lift their spirits. The implication is that God will provide a lesson to both the Israelites and the nations of the world, showing his power and the futility of trying to resist it, as well as his willingness to use his power on behalf of his Covenant. To achieve this, the Pharaoh must have been seen not to be freeing the Israelites as an act of benevolence, but instead to be adamantly resistant at first, then changing his mind to the point where he drives them to leave, due only to his eventual reluctant submission to God's might. This concept is repeated in the recount of the Plague of Hail. This serves as the introduction to the demonstrations of God's power, beginning with Aaron's Rod and followed by the Ten Plagues of Egypt. The phrase has come to have great value in Judaic tradition as the symbol of God's use of his power on behalf of the Jews. It is repeated verbatim in Deuteronomy 26:8, which describes the commandment to tithe first fruits and which is read with emphasis in the Passover Haggadah and Seder. Egyptian parallels In ancient Egyptian royal literature, a pharaoh is frequently described as using his \\"mighty hand\\" or \\"outstretched arm\\" to perform mighty deeds. By describing God's defeat of Egypt in this language, the Bible argues that its God has outdone the greatest earthly leader.https://mosaicmagazine.com/essay/2015/03/was-there-an-exodus/ References Passover Biblical phrases Book of Exodus ","title":"With a strong hand and an outstretched arm"},{"id":"5009641","text":"Elaine L.

Best known for his work with Federico Fellini, Flaiano co-wrote ten screenplays with the Italian director, including La Strada (1954), La Dolce Vita (1960), and 8½.  Biography  Flaiano wrote for Cineillustrato, Oggi, Il Mondo, Il Corriere della Sera and other prominent Italian newspapers and magazines. In 1947, he won the Strega Prize for his novel, Tempo di uccidere (variously translated as Miriam, A Time to Kill, and The Short Cut). Set in Ethiopia during the Italian invasion (1935–36), the novel tells the story of an Italian officer who rapes and subsequently kills an Ethiopian woman and is then tormented by the memory of his act. The barren landscape around the protagonist hints at an interior emptiness and meaninglessness. This is one of the few Italian literary works dealing with the misdeeds of Italian colonialism in Eastern Africa. The novel has been continually in print for sixty years. A movie adaptation with the same title, directed by Giuliano Montaldo and starring Nicolas Cage, was released in 1989. In 1971, Flaiano suffered a first heart-attack. \\"All will have to change\\", he wrote in his notes. He put his many papers in order and published them, although the major part of his memoirs were published posthumously. In November 1972 he began writing various autobiographical pieces for Corriere della Sera. On November 20 of the same year, while at a clinic for a check-up, he suffered a second cardiac arrest and died. His daughter Lelè, after a long illness, died at age 40 in 1992. His wife Rosetta Rota, aunt of the mathematician Gian-Carlo Rota, died at the end of 2003. The entire family is buried together at the Maccarese Cemetery, near Rome. = Flaiano's Rome = Flaiano's name is indissolubly tied to Rome, a city he loved and hated, as he was a caustic witness to its urban evolutions and debacles, its vices and its virtues. In La Solitudine del Satiro, Flaiano left numerous passages relating to his Rome. In the Montesacro quarter of Rome, the LABit theatre company placed a commemorative plaque on the facade of the house where he lived from 1952. Critic Richard Eder wrote in Newsday: \\"To read the late Ennio Flaiano is to imagine a bust of Ovid or Martial, placed in a piazza in Rome and smiling above a traffic jam. In his antic, melancholy irony, Flaiano wrote as if he were time itself, satirizing the present moment.\\"  Literary Style  A fine and ironic moralist, at once tragic and bitter, Flaiano produced narrative works and other prose writings permeated by an original satiric vein and by a vivid sense of the grotesque through which he stigmatised the paradoxical aspects of contemporary reality. He introduced the expression saltare sul carro del vincitore (\\"to jump on the winner's chariot\\") into the Italian language. In the last section of his book, The Via Veneto Papers, journalist Giulio Villa Santa included an interview with Flaiano for Swiss-Italian Radio, two weeks before his death. The interview concluded as follows: > Villa Santa: This evening it seems to me, Flaiano, that you have opened > yourself up as perhaps you have never done before, that you have revealed an > anguish and above all a faith behind your humour. But this gives rise to the > suspicion in me that at bottom you are a man from another period if not from > another age altogether; is that an unfounded suspicion? > Flaiano: It's a legitimate one. We don’t know who we are, we are just so > many passengers without baggage, we are born alone and we die alone. A > writer once quoted me in a book of hers, and in the English translation the > English writer translated my name as Ennius Flaianus, thinking that this > Ennio Flaiano was some Latin author. A few months later we met each other in > a restaurant in Rome and were introduced and, naturally, she experienced an > awkward moment, for she didn’t think that this ancient writer was still > alive. However, we did agree that certain characteristics of my person, a > certain style of life, indicated that she was right. I perhaps was not of > this age, am not of this age. Perhaps I belong to another world: I feel > myself more in harmony when I read Juvenal, Martial, Catullus. It's probable > that I’m an ancient Roman who is still here, forgotten by history, to write > about the things that the others wrote about far better than I – namely, let > me repeat, Catullus, Martial, Juvenal. (p. 251)  Flaiano Prize  In 1975, the Flaiano Prize was created in his honour. Recognizing achievement in cinema, theater, creative writing, and literary criticism, the international prize is awarded annually in Flaiano's hometown of Pescara.

Survivor Live (2004–07)  The show premiered at the beginning of Survivor: Vanuatu - Islands of Fire as a result of the popularity of House Calls: The Big Brother Talk Show, which began airing the previous summer during Big Brother 5. During that season, the show was hosted by Richard Hatch, winner on Survivor: Borneo and a contestant on Survivor: All-Stars, and Chris Booker, a New York television and radio personality. The show originally aired as one-hour Thursday and Friday shows at 2 p.m. North American Eastern Time Zone, with the Thursday shows talking about the show in general, sometimes with in-studio guests or celebrities, and Friday shows involving the contestant voted out the previous night. Of note, Survivor Live ended its first season right before the season finale, meaning the show never interviewed any of the final four contestants. The second season of Survivor Live, with the start of Survivor: Palau, was retooled, mostly due to Hatch's then-new legal troubles, with new hosts Jenna Morasca, winner of Survivor: Amazon and a contestant on Survivor: All-Stars, and Dalton Ross, an editor of Entertainment Weekly magazine. From this season forward, the show was reduced to weekly Friday shows at 2 p.m. EST with the most recent castoff joining the two hosts in a one-hour show. Some seasons also have special features, such as Time Capsule (where the Survivor leaves a message for him/herself before the show starts), Minus 10 (where the ousted Survivor has to comment on 10 words in 10 words or less) and Jenna Morasca's Fan Question of the Week (where Jenna picks a question sent to her through her MySpace to ask the ousted Survivor). Changes to the schedule are made if the show if the TV show is on a different date, or due to holidays. The audio of this edition broadcast the following Sunday in San Francisco's KIFR-FM.

In an alternative formulation, the relationship will end before the sweater is even completed. The belief is widely discussed in knitting publications, and some knitters claim to have experienced it. In a 2005 poll, 15% of active knitters said that they had experienced the sweater curse firsthand, and 41% considered it a possibility that should be taken seriously. Despite its name, the \\"sweater curse\\" is treated in knitting literature not as a superstition governed by paranormal forces, but rather as a real-world pitfall of knitting that has rational explanations. Several plausible mechanisms for the sweater curse have been proposed, but it has not been studied systematically. Existence The existence of the phenomenon is anecdotal, and may be related to confirmation bias; knitters may remember breakups more clearly after giving a hand-knit sweater, which represents a significant investment of money (typically over $100), effort (~100,000 stitches), time (as much as a year) and romantic imagination. Proposed mechanisms Although the existence of this effect remains uncertain, it is a common belief amongst the knitting population, and several plausible (and non- exclusive) mechanisms for the sweater curse have been suggested within knitting periodicals and books: * Unlucky timing. Knitting a sweater takes a long time, and the relationship dies of natural causes during its making. * Rescue mission. The knitter senses subconsciously that the relationship is about to end, and knits a sweater as a dramatic gesture to save it. * Catalyst for analyzing the relationship. Giving or receiving a significant gift such as a sweater may cause either the giver or receiver to evaluate the relationship. For example, the gift may seem too intimate, too domestic or too binding to the significant other. It can be seen as a signal that makes them realize that the relationship is not reciprocal, prompting them to end the relationship before it involves obligations. * Aversion. The significant other may simply not want to wear anything hand-knit. A hand-knit sweater can also subject them to ridicule, either because the sweater looks bad (i.e., poorly made or unfashionable) or conveys overly domestic connotations. * Misdirected attention. The knitter loves their sweater a little too much, and pesters the significant other about the sweater. Alternatively, the knitter loves to knit too much, and spends too much time with their knitting instead of with the significant other. * Insufficient gratitude. The knitter sees the sweater as a significant thing, having chosen the pattern and color carefully, and having invested hours of labor; the recipient sees it as just another sweater, and the resulting lack of gratitude leads to tension in the relationship. * New interests. The knitter may have discovered a new aspect of their personality, previously unexplored, to be of greater interest than the receiver understands. Having joined a knitting community, spending all their time reading about and thinking about knitting, potentially being secretive about their new interest in hopes of surprising the recipient, which may manifest as reminiscent of adulterous behaviour, or loss of interest in the relationship, thus alienating the soon-to-be recipient. Avoiding the curse For many knitters, making a hand-knit gift is an emotional experience, an extended affectionate meditation on the person receiving the gift. A metaphor commonly used by knitters is, \\"I knit my love into every stitch.\\" Since giving too significant a gift too early in a relationship can evoke apprehension, knitters have been advised to match the knitted gift to the stage in the relationship, beginning with hats, mittens, scarves, or socks before graduating to sweaters. Many knitters wait until marriage before making a sweater for a significant other, or ask their affianced to sign a \\"pre-knitual agreement\\". Common-sense advice to knitters is that they should determine whether the recipient would ever wear a hand-knitted sweater. Knitters have also been advised to involve the significant other in designing the sweater (e.g. in choosing its design, colors and materials) and follow their suggestions, even if the knitter objects. Several books offer practical design advice for avoiding the sweater curse.

The Mennonites were recruited by Queen Catherine II the Great to settle on territory recently won from the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. The entire Ukraine had a population of three million at most. In order to settle this empty territory, colonists from western Europe were invited to come to Russia. Russian colonization agents advertised the availability of crown lands to people throughout Europe. One of these was Georg von Trappe, who visited the Mennonites of Danzig in 1786. The Mennonite congregations elected to send Hoeppner and Johann Bartsch, who von Trappe arranged to send to Russia at government expense. They departed in the fall of 1786, sailing first to Riga, then travelling cross country, arriving at the Dnieper in late November. From here they sailed down the river looking for a suitable site. They met Potemkin at Kremenchuk and were presented to Catherine in May, as she was inspecting her new territories. They found a suitable settlement location, then returned home by way of Saint Petersburg, where they met with Crown Prince Paul, who confirmed the promises made by von Trappe. Their return to Danzig was delayed for several months because Hoeppner broke his leg. Russia The following year, the 228 of the poorest families from the Mennonite community of Danzig made the long harrowing trip from Prussia to the promised tract of land in Russia under the leadership of Hoeppner and Bartsch. The journey from Danzig to Riga was 300 miles by boat on the Baltic Sea, then 900 miles by caravan to Chortiza. The difficulty of pioneering on the steppe was compounded the disappearance of personal property and government building materials en route to the settlement. While most families survived by building crude shelters, Hoeppner and Bartsch were able to erect substantial dwellings. The two men were accused of keeping government money intended for community use. Both were excommunicated from the church. Hoeppner was turned over to the Russian government on trumped up charges and spent almost a year in jail. Eventually, Hoeppner and his family became citizens of nearby Alexandrovsk, settled on the Isle of Chrotiza on the Dnieper River and became an active part of the Russian Mennonites life in the new colony, joining another Mennonite congregation. Hoeppner made arrangements to be buried on his own estate instead of the Mennonite cemetery among the people who had caused so many problems for him. In 1889 a centennial monument celebrating the original settlement was placed at his gravesite by the great-grandchildren of the colonists who had Hoeppner thrown in jail. The monument has since been moved to Mennonite Heritage Village in Steinbach, Manitoba.

Private bills are a specific class of legislation promoted by organisations outside Parliament to obtain powers for themselves that differ from the general law. History In 1836, due to the obvious conflict of interest, the Clerks of the House were debarred from carrying out what had been a lucrative line of agency work.Latham, R. (1956) 'The Clerical Organization of the House of Commons, 1661-1850', The English Historical Review, 71 (278), 104-108. Parliamentary agents expanded into the space left by the clerks and formed the Society of Parliamentary Agents in 1840.Olney, R. (1982) 'The Parliamentary Agents. A History', The English Historical Review, 97 (382), 238. The high point for parliamentary agency work was during the mid 19th century during the rise of the railway industry, as these companies often needed parliamentary powers in building and running their operations. This was a source of political controversy, since railway directors were becoming seen to be overly powerful, leading the prime minister at the time, William Ewart Gladstone, to identify parliamentary agents as ‘the deeper power in opposition’.McLean, I. (2002) 'The origin and strange history of regulation in the UK: three case studies in search of a theory', Workshop Paper. Parliamentary agents today As private bills make up for a very small proportion of contemporary legislation, with most legislation being sponsored by the government and thus drafted and supported by the Civil Service, the work of parliamentary agents has relatively diminished and there are now only seven firms of Roll A parliamentary agents: BDB Pitmans LLP, employing five Roll A agents, Winckworth Sherwood LLP and Eversheds Sutherland (International) LLP (formerly Rees & Freres), each employing three Roll A agents, Sharpe Pritchard LLP, employing two Roll A agents and Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, Pinsent Masons LLP and Veale Wasbrough Vizards LLP who each have one Roll A agent. It is also possible for any person to become a Roll B parliamentary agent for the purpose of opposing a single bill in Parliament. Such a person must either be a solicitor or have \\"a certificate of respectability\\". Much of the work of parliamentary agents, as experts in the legislative process and Whitehall and Westminster political culture, would now come under the profession of political consultancy, although the remaining parliamentary agents are now billed as law firms first and parliamentary agents second. However, the largest of the seven firms, Bircham Dyson Bell, has developed a political consultancy business within its legal practice, thus giving it the rare distinction of most of its political consultants also being qualified lawyers. Parliamentary agents can observe House of Commons proceedings from the Under Gallery near the Speaker's chair. The City Remembrancer is a Roll A parliamentary agent.

The company's headquarters are located at 28 Via Sommacampagna, Rome and its studios on the Via Tiburtina, 13 km from the centre of Rome. Lombardo ran the studios until his death in 1951. His son, Goffredo Lombardo (1920–2005) and later his grandson, Guido Lombardo have continued to run the company. The company has been responsible for hundreds of Italian productions, including some of the most popular or important films in Italian cinema. Titanus made many peplum films and comedies featuring Totò and Franco & Ciccio. The film The Shortest Day was not only a parody of The Longest Day but featured a galaxy of stars who made the film to help the studio. The studio made numerous international co-productions with American (The Story of Ruth, The Angel Wore Red) and French (Plein Soleil) film studios. After the arrival of the French new wave films, Titanus launched a \\"youth operation\\", which gave young film artists a chance to create low-budget films with relative freedom. This had approximately 100 first and second productions for Titanus made between 1960 and 1965. This included films by new directors such as Ermanno Olmi, Elio Petri, Damiano Damiani and Lina Wertmuller. Titanus closed down its production branch in 1964. After a hiatus of approximately ten years, Titanus reorganized and resumed film production on a smaller scale. Despite a few false starts, the company seemed to be back on its feet by the late 1980s, though, now, most of its work is being done for television.

In a 2006 article in Watercolor Magazine, Andrew Wyeth named him as one of America's 20 greatest watercolorists. He wrote and illustrated several children's books, most notably Little Toot. Early life Hardie Gramatky was born in Dallas, Texas, the second of three sons born to Bernhard Gramatky and Blanche Gunner Gramatky. Ten years later, following the death of his father, his mother moved the family to the Wilmar - South San Gabriel area, a then semi-rural suburb a few miles east of Los Angeles. Gramatky attended local schools in Wilmar, and then Alhambra High School in nearby Alhambra. Displaying a precocious artistic talent, he began submitting his sketches to a \\"young folks section\\" published in the Los Angeles Times, and by the early 1920s had earned a reputation as the section's leading artist. Education After high school Gramatky moved to Northern California to attend Stanford University. Though he majored in English he continued to study art as well, but after two years at the university one of his professors advised him that the school's art department had no more to teach him, and so he returned to Southern California where, in 1928, he enrolled in Chouinard Art Institute. Developing a deep interest in watercolor painting, he later said that during this period he produced an average of five small watercolors per day. By 1929, he had become a proficient watercolorist and was recognized as one of the true innovators in the development of \\"California Scene\\" watercolor painting. These skills helped him to get a job that year as a senior animator at the Walt Disney Studios, where he remained for the next six years. Recognition as a painter In the early 1930s, he became active in the California Watercolor Society, an organization founded in 1920. It was largely through his efforts that the young watercolorists of the California School were able to dominate the Society and establish it as an internationally recognized organization. In 1932, he married Dorothea Cooke, who had been his fellow student at Chouinard. In 1936, Gramatky moved to New York City. There, the Ferargil Gallery began exhibiting his watercolors and, in 1937, those of other members of the California School as well. Gramatky was also among those whose work was exhibited in a major show of California artists mounted at the Art Institute of Chicago that year. Ultimately, his work would be exhibited at numerous museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Examples of his work are part of the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, Chicago Art Institute, and Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington, among others. Author and illustrator By the 1940s, he was producing commercial art to be used for magazine illustrations and began writing and illustrating a series of children's books, including Hercules, Loopy, Creepers Jeep and Sparky. Gramatky's most successful book was his first, Little Toot, published in 1939. It became a perennial best seller, spawning several sequels, and was animated by Disney as part of the feature anthology Melody Time. During World War II, he worked in Hollywood producing training films for the United States Army Air Forces. After the war, Gramatky returned to the East Coast, settling in Westport, Connecticut, where he would live for the rest of the life. He continued working as a commercial illustrator producing art for Fortune, Collier’s, Woman’s Day, True, American and Readers Digest. He also wrote and illustrated several sequels to the original Little Toot story. Gramatky died of cancer on April 29, 1979. His last book, Little Toot and the Loch Ness Monster, was unfinished at the time of his death. Following the 50th anniversary of Little Toot it was completed by his wife and daughter, Dorothea Cooke Gramatky and Linda Gramatky Smith, and published in 1989. Professional organizations Hardie Gramatky was an elected Academician (24 aquarellists) member of the National Academy of Design, New York Watercolor Club, American Watercolor Society, and the California Watercolor Society.

He later became a naturalized French citizen and became known as Jean Charles Burckhardt. He is remembered in particular for his work in fundamental astronomy, and for his lunar theory, which was in widespread use for the construction of navigational ephemerides of the Moon for much of the first half of the nineteenth century. Life and career Burckhardt was born in Leipzig, where he studied mathematics and astronomy. Later he became an assistant at the Gotha Observatory and studied under Franz Xaver von Zach. On von Zach's recommendation he joined the observatory of the École militaire in Paris, then directed by Jérôme Lalande. He was appointed as astronome-adjoint to the Bureau des Longitudes and received his letters of French naturalization as a French citizen in 1799, and was elected to the L'Institut National des Sciences et des Arts in 1804. After Lalande's death in 1807, Burckhardt became director of the observatory at the École militaire.See pp.571-2 in Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Band 3, (Leipzig) 1876; also p.343 in Encyclopedie des Gens du Monde, tome 4, part 1, Paris 1834. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1822.  Scientific work  Burckhardt carried out extensive studies on the orbits of comets, and his study of a comet of 1770 had initially gained him some professional reputation. In 1812 he published an improved lunar theory,J C Burckhardt, Tables de la Lune, in Tables Astronomiques, published by the Bureau des Longitudes de France Paris (Courcier) 1812; (revisions published 1825). after that of Pierre-Simon Laplace. Burckhardt's lunar tables appear to have been the first to be based on a least squares adjustment of the coefficients to selected lunar observations, of which about 4000 were used; and a committee of the Bureau des Longitudes (consisting of Laplace, Delambre, Bouvard, Arago and Poisson) concluded after an early form of sum-of-squares analysis that Burckhardt's tables improved on those of Bürg.See review of Burckhardt's tables in von Zach's Monatliche Korrespondenz for June 1813, pp.520-532. Accordingly, they enjoyed for some decades a substantial reputation as the most accurate available. They were officially used for computing the lunar ephemerides in the Nautical Almanac from 1821 to 1861 (but they were superseded in part, as from 1856, for computing the lunar horizontal parallax, by improved tables due to J C Adams). Burckhardt's tables were eventually replaced altogether, for issues of the Nautical Almanac for 1862 and thereafter, by new computations based on P A Hansen's more comprehensive lunar theory.Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Ephemeris, (London, 1961), sect.7B, pp.177-8.

In creating many practical items from antlers, feathers, feet, skins, and tusks, the Rowland Ward company made fashionable items (sometimes known as Wardian furniture) from animal parts, such as zebra-hoof inkwells, antler furniture, and elephant-feet umbrella stands. Rowland Ward was also a well-known publisher of natural history books and big-game hunting narratives. The most famous and enduring Rowland Ward Ltd. product is the Records of Big Game series of books, which started in 1892 and is now in its twenty-ninth edition (2014). These books contain measurements of game animals from all over the world and is the oldest such series of books in existence.  History of Rowland Ward Limited  The 'Macarte Lion' that killed the lion-tamer Thomas Macarte in 1872 - mounted by Rowland Ward in 1874 Even before Rowland's time, his family had been involved in taxidermy and natural history. According to the history of the Rowland Ward company by P. A. Morris,Morris, P.A.. Rowland Ward, Taxidermist to the World Rowland Ward's grandfather was a naturalist and dealer in animal skins. Edwin Henry Ward (1812–1878), Rowland Ward's father, was a well-known taxidermist in his day. Edwin H. Ward travelled with John James Audubon on his expeditions, and Ward collected and prepared the bird skins for the artist. These specimens were later used by Audubon in his epic The Birds of America. Edwin H. Ward set up a taxidermy shop in London in 1857 and received a royal warrant from Queen Victoria in 1870. Other distantly related Ward family members had taxidermy-related businesses as far away as New York and Australia. Edwin H. Ward had two sons, Edwin Jr. and James Rowland. Both were trained in their father's business and were successful on their own, mounting heads for the British royal family as well the empress of Austria, among others. Edwin Jr. left the taxidermy business and eventually moved to the United States where he was involved in various ventures. Edwin Jr.'s son, Herbert Ward (1863–1919), served as a zoologist for Henry Morton Stanley during Stanley's 1887–1888 Emin Pasha Relief Expedition into the interior of then-unknown Africa. Rowland Ward became the best-known taxidermist of the family. In his own book, A Naturalist's Life StudyWard, Rowland. A Naturalist's Life Study he said he left school at age fourteen to work in his father's shop. Rowland helped his father mount a hummingbird collection for John Gould. Early on, his focus was on sculpting and anatomically correct modelling. Rowland Ward was also a bronze sculptor of note. By 1870, all three Wards operated taxidermy shops of their own in England. Then Edwin Jr. left for the United States and Edwin H. Ward died in 1878, and these events left Rowland Ward the only family member in the taxidermy business in England. In the later part of the nineteenth century, Rowland Ward located his shop at 167 Piccadilly, London. From far and wide, in newspapers and in casual speech throughout the Empire, his shop was famously referred to as \\"The Jungle.\\"  Rowland Ward in the Victorian Age  Transporting a giraffe to the Powell-Cotton Museum.Two forces in the nineteenth century came together to make Rowland Ward Ltd. an international powerhouse of taxidermy and book publishing: the global reach of the British Empire and the Industrial Revolution. The British Empire was composed of dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories that were ruled or administered by the United Kingdom. At its height, the British Empire was the largest in history and, for over a century it was the foremost global power. Its apex occurred during the lifetime of James Rowland Ward. At the end of World War I, the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time. The Empire covered more than 33,700,000 km sq. (13,012,000 sq. miles), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area . . . and Rowland Ward was not only known as the taxidermist to the Empire's rich and powerful, but Rowland Ward Ltd. was the only organisation to keep extensive records of the trophies of the Empire's elites as well as dignitaries from other nations. The Industrial Revolution had created enormous new wealth, and that revolution started in Britain. The industries founded in Great Britain generated tremendous fortunes for the owners of the newly formed industries. These fortunes created a new class of British sportsmen who ventured out over the world and brought back hunting trophies as well as natural history specimens for public and private museums. Rowland Ward Ltd. thrived as a result. The company's reputation spread, and soon Rowland Ward was receiving commissions from all over Europe to prepare museum specimens. Famous sportsmen from as far away as Russia brought their trophies to Rowland Ward Ltd. In addition, Rowland Ward Ltd. helped many museums and private collections acquire specimens. Bear \\"dumbwaiter\\" holding drinks for arriving guests. Possibly among Ward's most famous work was the taxidermy he did for Percy Powell-Cotton for the famous Powell-Cotton Museum. Rowland Ward wanted to mount Powell-Cotton's elephant, which had the second largest tusks ever recorded, life-size, but to do so would necessitate an extension of the roof of the building to accommodate such a large trophy, and that was something Powell-Cotton did not want to do. Rowland Ward felt so strongly that this elephant should be life size that he made a deal with Powell-Cotton: Rowland Ward would do the taxidermy for free if Powell-Cotton would do the necessary remodelling to accommodate the full-size mount. They agreed, and the full-size mount can still be viewed today in the Powell-Cotton Museum at Quex Park. More than any other taxidermist of his age, Rowland Ward became known for making items from skins, horns, and skulls that could be used in the home, either for practical purposes or as decorations. Known as Victorian or Edwardian “animal furniture,” these items included a “dumbwaiter” in the form of a mounted bear standing up straight and holding a silver tray on which glasses could be placed; inkwells made from horse hoofs; and letter openers with the blade made from ivory, the handle made of a fox's paw, and the two connected with an elegant silver sleeve. Then there were liquor cabinets made from elephants’ feet; stuffed birds that acted as lamp stands, and items that would seem very odd in the twenty-first century but were highly fashionable and desirable in Victorian England. In addition, Rowland Ward Ltd. was a great supplier of glass cabinets filled with colourful mounted birds; these were all the rage as home decorations at the time. Because rowing on the Thames was such a fashionable activity during Ward's lifetime, the company also sold canoes imported from Canada. It appears that Rowland Ward Ltd. made a great deal of money from his ventures. Rowland Ward's mounted heads and glass bird boxes are very collectible today in England, with several auction houses offering specialised sales each year.  Rowland Ward Ltd. Publishing  In 1872 Rowland Ward's brother, Edwin Jr., published a small book entitled Knapsack Manual for Sportsmen on the Field. It is clear Rowland Ward borrowed elements from this publication to start his own series of books in 1880 called The Sportsman's Handbook. Today this series is in its fifteenth edition. These handbooks serve as guides on how to conduct hunts, take care of skins, operate camps, hire guides, and select firearms. Soon other books followed, including the first edition of the Records of Big Game in 1892. Today, the early editions of Rowland Ward's record books and his other publications are highly sought after by collectors worldwide and bring very high prices in the antiquarian market. These titles include Sport in Somaliland by Count Josef Potocki, After Wild Sheep in the Altai and Mongolia by Prince Demidoff; Great and Small Game of Africa by Henry Bryden; The Deer of All Lands by Richard Lydekker; Elephant Hunting in East Equatorial Africa by Alfred Neumann; A Sporting Trip Through Abyssinia by Percy Powell-Cotton; Travel and Big Game by Frederick Selous, and many others. In addition to his own publishing ventures, Rowland Ward also distributed books for other companies. Rowland Ward himself wrote several books, including one on his angling trip to FloridaRowland Ward. The English Angler in Florida that was based on the diaries kept by his wife. The company's most prolific author was Richard Lydekker, who happened to be the preeminent naturalist of his time. Lydekker wrote a total of nine books for Rowland Ward. Many of Rowland Ward's books are instantly recognisable by their \\"zebra pattern\\" endpapers, which were granted a patent in Great Britain. The company issued some books in small-number, limited editions signed by Rowland Ward himself. Even the books not signed or limited are now very rare and costly, especially in what book dealers term \\"fine\\" condition.  Records of Big Game  The most enduring and famous of all Rowland Ward's publications is his Records of Big Game. Started in 1882, the first edition was entitled Horn Measurements and Weights of the Great Game of the World. It was revised and reprinted in 1894, but the second edition, which was published only four years after the first, had two-and-a-half times the number of pages as the first. The second edition was entitled Rowland Ward's Records of Big Game, and it is this title that has been used ever since. Rowland Wards Records of Big Game 7th Edn The series was the talk of its day among hunters and naturalists, and by the time World War I started (1914), seven editions had been issued, each containing more and more measurements and greater variations in the number and species of animals with trophies listed from the early 1800s. In this period, field guides were not published; consequently, the Records of Big Game served as a valuable resource for information as to what mammals could be found and where they could be found in the far-flung corners of the earth and Empire. Many natural history museums of that day kept a copy of Rowland Ward's Records of Big Game in their reference libraries. Not only were there measurements, but the volumes in the series also contained anecdotes from hunters, naturalists, and Rowland Ward himself about species, subspecies, geographical variations, common weights and measurements, and distribution. As a testament of Rowland Ward's own naturalist qualifications, three animals had the Ward name incorporated in their scientific nomenclature: the Asiatic ibex, Capra sibirica wardi; a subspecies of reedbuck, Redunca redunca wardi; and a subspecies of the Malayan bear, Ursus malayanus wardi. As time went by, Rowland Ward's Records of Big Game became a who's who of big-game hunting. Those who entered their trophies in “the book,” as it was called, included King George V, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, Prince Abdorreza of Iran, various Princes of Wales, the Maharaja of Cooch Behar, Sir Winston Churchill, President Theodore Roosevelt, Lord Curzon, and a host of other royalty, nobility, dignitaries, celebrities, and otherwise famous people. After World War II, the influence of American big-game hunters became more apparent as sportsmen such as Ernest Hemingway, Robert Ruark, Jack O’Connor, Herb Klein, Elgin Gates, and James Mellon II entered their exceptional game trophies in “the book.”  Death and Succession  At the turn of the twentieth century, Rowland Ward Ltd. was at its zenith, and in 1904 the company was granted a royal warrant. Hunters and naturalists from all over the world came to Rowland Ward for advice on equipment and destinations. In 1907 American Percy Madeira wrote “When in 1907 I saw the possibility of making this hunting trip—a long desired wish—I wrote to Rowland Ward, the naturalist-taxidermist, in London, inquiring where the best bag of African game had been secured that year.” Madeira proceeded to take a steamer to London where he picked up supplies deemed necessary for an extended safari before continuing on to East Africa. Young Winston Churchill was a customer of Rowland Ward Ltd. Walter Rothschild, kings Edward VII and George V, and numerous American and European celebrities and film stars brought their hunting trophies to \\"The Jungle\\" to be mounted. While there they bought various curios and animal furniture, all of which garner very high prices at auction houses today. Rowland Ward was married to Lina Maple Ward (1868–1951), but the couple had no children. Lina was apparently not involved in the business, and she is rarely mentioned by Ward in his writings. In his book on his Florida fishing trip he refers to her as \\"Mrs. Ward.\\" The couple appears to have had a high standard of living, keeping staff and a butler in their London home. She must be seen as the product of her time in which men were prominent in business and women rarely so. When Rowland Ward died on 28 December 1912, there was no one to succeed him. The company issued shares and was incorporated under the name Rowland Ward Limited in 1891. There were several shareholders, but it appears Rowland Ward was the majority shareholder. By the time of Rowland Ward's death, however, John Binmore Burlace was the company manager as well as a shareholder. Burlace continued acquiring shares over time and by the late 1920s he held the majority. He bought out Lina Ward entirely in 1935. By the mid-1930s, the publishing side of the business had slowed down considerably with only Records of Big Game continuing on a steady basis; however, the taxidermy part of the business and the retail establishment in London were going strong. By the early 1940s, Burlace retired and sold his shares to Gerald Best, who bought the last shares from the remaining shareholders in 1946.  After World War II  Already after World War I, great changes began to occur in the world of taxidermy and international hunting. Whereas before 1914 most of the sportsmen seen in the game fields of the world were British, after 1918 they were gradually replaced by American hunters, and after World War II, more American hunters were seen in Africa and Asia than any other nationality. At the same time American taxidermists such as Louis Paul Jonas of Denver, the James Clark Studios, and later Klineburger Brothers Taxidermy started providing taxidermy services to their clientele in the United States. Nonetheless, Rowland Ward Ltd. retained a prominent position in the world of taxidermy, and during the Gerald Best years as much as 80 percent of all taxidermy work was exported out of England. In 1950, Rowland Ward Ltd. opened an establishment in Nairobi for taxidermy and as a center for processing and shipping raw skins. In England, the business continued in various locations in London, and in the period between 1960 and 1970 Rowland Ward Ltd. employed from twenty-nine to forty-four people, . When Gerald Best died in 1969, the taxidermy part of the business was taken over by Anthony Best, his son. However, the times were changing and the continued loss of habitat for the world's great mammals had its effect on hunting. Various locales and entire countries closed their hunting programs, including India in 1971 and Kenya in 1976. In 1974 the government of Kenya expropriated the Nairobi Rowland Ward establishment without compensation, a great loss for the company. This, combined with the shifting of the client base to the United States and the increasing competition from American and European companies, caused the taxidermy side of the business to close in the mid-1970s.  Retail Establishment in London  Tim Best, a brother of Anthony, continued to operate the Rowland Ward store, now located in Knightsbridge, London, which sold crystal, porcelain, books, and other animal- themed items. He also published books containing accounts of big-game hunting adventures, including Tony Sanchez's on the Trail of the African Elephant. In addition, Tim Best was in charge of the record book series; in 1981 he published the eighteenth edition of Records of Big Game.  Ownership Moves to the United States and then to South Africa  The eighteenth edition of Records of Big Game was, however, the last edition to be published in England. In 1982 the company was sold to Game Conservation International (known as Game Coin), an organisation based in San Antonio, Texas. Game Coin published one edition of the Records of Big Game and then turned over the publishing of the series to Steve Smith of Johannesburg, South Africa. Steve Smith greatly revitalised the publishing program and started publishing maps, more hunting narratives, and natural history books as well as the perennial best-seller Records of Big Game. Smith also once again began accepting game entries from Asia, Europe, and North America. (Only African game had been accepted since the tenth edition of Records of Big Game (1935).) A year after Smith died in a car accident (1993), Game Coin sold the company to Robin Halse of Queenstown, South Africa. Subsequently, the company was taken over by his daughter, Jane Halse, who continues to publish the Records of Big Game series as well as other natural history and hunting publications. Since the Halse family took over the business, Rowland Ward has continued to remain active in publishing and has also branched out in other areas as well. Besides publishing and selling books, Rowland Ward also sells clothing and leather goods. Its retail establishment in Johannesburg sells its products all over the world via its Web site and catalogs. Safari Press of Huntington Beach, California, distributes the company's publications in North America. In 2015 the company was sold and operations are now based in California.

A problem for the non-Russian reader is the need to transliterate the Cyrillic names into the Latin alphabet. There are often several different Latin spellings of the same Russian name. Pre revolution Before the revolution, the Imperial Russian Navy used the following convention: =Battleships= Russian Battleships were named after: *Battles – e.g., Gangut, Petropavlovsk, Poltava, Sinop, Chesma, Borodino *Royals – e.g., Imperator Pavel I (Emperor Paul I), Pyotr Veliky (Peter the Great), Tsesarevich *Saints – e.g., Georgy Pobedonosets (St George the Victorious), Andrey Pervozvanny (St Andrew the First-called), Tri Svyatitely (Three Holy Hierarchs) *Generals – e.g., Knyaz Suvorov (Prince Suvorov), Knyaz Potemkin Tavricheskii (Prince Potemkin of Taurica) *Traditional – e.g., Retvizan (after Rättvisan, Swedish ship-of-the-line captured by Russians in 1790) =Cruisers= Russian Cruisers were named after: *Mythical figures – e.g., Rurik, Askold, Bayan *Admirals – e.g., Admiral Makarov, Admiral Lazarev *Gemstones – e.g., Zhemchug = pearl =Destroyers= Russian destroyers were named after adjectives: e.g. Burnyi = Stormy, Smeliy = Valiant =Frigates/Gunboats= *Named after birds or animals – e.g., Albatross *Ethnographic names – e.g., Donskoy Kasak = Don Cossack =Submarines= Named after fish or animals – e.g., Morzh = Walrus, Akula = Shark Soviet times =Renaming= The Soviets changed the names of many ships after they took power in 1917. *Royal names were changed to republican names, e.g., Volya=Free Will, Grazhdanin = Citizen *The Gangut Class dreadnoughts were named after Revolutionary themes, but two reverted to original names during World War II *Cruisers were renamed after Communist themes, e.g., Chervona Ukraina = Red Ukraine *Many destroyers were renamed after Political figures e.g. Karl Liebknecht =New construction= *Planned Battleships were named after Soviet themes, e.g., Sovetsky Soyuz *Cruisers were named after revolutionary heroes, e.g., Kirov *Destroyer leaders were named after cities, e.g. Moskva = Moscow *Destroyers reverted to being named after adjectives, e.g., Grozny = Terrible *Frigates/Gunboats were named after animals, or weather phenomena, e.g., Uragan = hurricane *Submarines were initially given political names (e.g. Dekabrist), or fish names but later given only numbers =Post War= *Aircraft carriers and helicopter cruisers were named after cities, Tbilisi and Baku were changed to Admiral Kuznetsov and Admiral Gorshkov respectively on the collapse of the Soviet Union *Battle cruisers were named after revolutionary heroes, this was changed to admirals after the end of communism *Cruisers were mostly named after admirals, generals, cities or given traditional names e.g. Slava=glory *Destroyers and large frigates were named after adjectives, although a few were named after the Komsomol *Frigates were named after birds or animals e.g. Lev=Lion *Submarines were rarely named during Soviet times but after the end of the Soviet Union many were renamed after animals, e.g., Yaguar, or cities, e.g., Kursk. New nuclear submarines are called after historical figures like Vladimir Monomakh. =Project(design) designations (design names)= The Soviets assigned a project number to each new design. The numbers were non sequential, submarine designs had numbers 600-900, small combatants 100-200 and large ships 1000 plus. The designs also had covernames, major ship classes were named after birds, e.g., Orlan = Sea eagle, Berkut = Golden eagle, Kreschet = Gyrfalcon. Submarine designs were given fish names, e.g., Akula = Shark, Som = Catfish, etc. *see List of ships of Russia by project number for more details NATO naming Also see NATO reporting name NATO assigned its own reporting names to Soviet ships. This was because the official Soviet designation was unknown. *Initially surface ship classes were named after the place where they were first identified, e.g. Kotlin, Poti etc. It soon became apparent that this convention would rapidly become obsolete as the Soviet Union had only a limited number of naval bases and shipyards. A new convention based on vaguely Slavic sounding names beginning with the letter K for \\"korabl\\" (\\"warship\\" in Russian naval usage) was then used. *Fast patrol and torpedo craft classes were named after the Russian name for insects e.g. Osa=wasp. The Soviets also actually named their missile boats after insects leading to confusion. *Minesweepers and small frigates were given diminutive first names e.g. Alyosha,Vanya, Petya *Hovercraft were named after Russian words for birds e.g. Aist = Stork *Submarine classes were given Phonetic alphabet names e.g. Delta, Alfa, Victor etc. When the letters of the Phonetic alphabet had all been assigned, Russian words, primarily for fish, were used. As with missile boats, this led to confusion as the same Russian word could be both the official Soviet designation of one submarine class and the NATO reporting name of a different one. For example, Akula (shark) was both the NATO reporting name for an attack submarine and the Soviet designation of a ballistic missile submarine. References *McLaughlin, S.

It is a fast-moving frog that lives along creeks and in quiet pools along small streams along the slopes near the cave. The frog is named for Charles Brewer-Carías who collected the type series. Description The distinctive features of this species are its particular skin pattern, absence of fringes on fingers, moderate toe webbing, tongue characteristics, and yellow and orange coloration on its undersides. The type series consists of one female (the holotype), two males, and one unsexed juvenile. The female measures and the larger male in snout–vent length. Habitat and conservation Anomaloglossus breweri is only known from a collapsed steep gorge on the northwestern slope of the tepui at an elevation of above sea level. It is probably more widespread on the tepui, and perhaps in the surrounding areas. The specimens were found along creeks and in quiet pools along small streams. Aprada-tepui is located within the boundaries of the Canaima National Park. This species could still be threatened because of its small range, making it sensitive to catastrophic events.

Usually, contributions from both alumni and current students are presented side by side in order to ensure a broad range of professional and amateur compositions. This frequently juxtaposes accomplished musicianship with budding creativity in an eclectic diversity of genres, including jazz, rock, electronic, and chamber music. Twig Tape volumes are generally released to coincide with the Schools' Art and Music Night in late May every year.  Origins  John Fautley, long-time music teacher and former UTS Assistant Principal, is credited with championing the idea of a \\"musical yearbook\\" at the Schools. In the academic year of 1985–86, he assigned the task of writing a pop song to his music students and, at the time, someone suggested recording the results for posterity. By the end of that year, their idea had snowballed into a 90-minute compilation of brand-new songs, which was duplicated and sold as a memento of the students' achievements — much like UTS' yearbook, the Twig. The first ever double-disc Twig Tape was released in 2002, containing a \\"Student LP\\" on the first CD and an \\"Alumni EP\\" on the second CD. Following that release, the division was abandoned — subsequent volumes returned to a mixed track listing.  Name  UTS' motto is velut arbor ita ramus, which translates from Latin: \\"as the tree, so the branch\\". This reflects the institution's traditional association with the University of Toronto, since its Latin motto, velut arbor ævo, translates \\"as a tree with the passage of time\\". Accordingly, the Schools' annual yearbook was christened the Twig, and the Twig Tape followed suit (although the two entities are now entirely separated, except by title). The word \\"Tape\\" is derived from the compilation's genesis on audio tape, which was the preferred medium of delivery for the first decade of its existence. The \\"Twig Disc\\" was released in 1996, with an aim to compile the best tracks from the original ten volumes,The Twig Disk track listing and in 1998 the annual compilation was first released on CD. Despite this change, the original name has been preserved for the sake of tradition, although the uninitiated may sometimes refer to it as the \\"Twig CD\\" in error. Such obscure traditions of language use are basically the same motivations which dictate that the word \\"Schools\\" in UTS' name should retain its grammatical status as a singular noun. The art design used on the In 2005 cover was an extended visual pun on the name \\"Twig Tape\\" — photography of an actual twig covered in masking tape.  Process  As with many extracurricular activities in the UTS community, the Twig Tape is organized and operated largely without guidance from teachers. UTS students are notorious for achieving technical and artistic wonders with extremely limited access to equipment and almost no teacher supervision (one example being the groundbreaking 1999 webcast of \\"Art & Music Night\\" ); the Twig Tape reinforces this tradition. John Fautley produced the first volume using a TASCAM 4-track tape recorder, but soon the students took on the entire project themselves. With each passing year, equipment and techniques improved as the student producers graduated and passed on what they had learned to their successors. One constant has remained: all performance, recording, mixing, mastering, design and distribution have remained \\"in-house\\" where possible and left to the discretion of student volunteers. Unlike other high school music yearbooks, the Twig Tape is not an outlet for so-called \\"band geeks\\" to show off their performances of other peoples' songs, but a showcase for the broad range of musical treats from the entire school community. Alumni submissions are now accepted via the internet from all parts of the world, and copies of the Twig Tape have been spotted in the collections of prominent UTS graduates and other interested parties in the global community. The Twig Tape is now encouraged and perpetuated by UTS' current Music Director, Judy Kay, and all proceeds from its sales are donated to the UTS music department. In the 2006–2007 school year, students created a Twig Tape website called uTunes.

He is the quality assurance coach for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). He was selected in the 17th round (500th overall) of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft. He played in MLB for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, and Cleveland Indians. Up to 2013, Napoli was primarily a catcher. He holds the all-time single-season records for most strikeouts by both a Red Sox player and an Indians player. In 2009 he led all American League catchers in errors, and in 2016 he led all AL first basemen in errors. Early life Born in Hollywood, Florida, Napoli attended Charles W. Flanagan High School in Pembroke Pines, Florida. He signed a letter of intent to play college baseball for Louisiana State, but instead signed with the Anaheim Angels after being selected in the 17th round (500th overall) of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft. Minor league career Napoli began his professional career with the rookie-level Butte Copper Kings, batting .231, but sat out most of the year after suffering a lower back strain. He returned in 2001 with the High-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, batting .200, before transferring to Single-A Cedar Rapids, where he batted .232. In 2002, he returned to Cedar Rapids, hitting .251 with 10 home runs and 50 runs batted in (RBIs) and 104 strikeouts in 362 at bats as the Kernels' primary designated hitter. He also started at catcher for 37 games. After being transferred to Rancho Cucamonga in 2003, he only played 47 games after injuring his right shoulder. In 2004, he hit .282 with 29 home runs and 118 RBI, ranking seventh in RBIs and ninth in walks in all of the minor leagues, with 166 strikeouts (leading the California League) in 482 at bats. In 2005, he was promoted to Double-A Arkansas, batting .237 with 140 strikeouts (3rd in the Texas League) in 439 at bats and 14 errors at catcher in 109 games, and finishing second in the league in extra-base hits and fifth in runs scored. Napoli played for the Águilas Cibaeñas of Santiago in the Dominican Republic during the winters of 2004 and 2005. Major League career =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= 2006 Napoli made his Major League Baseball debut on May 4, 2006, against the Detroit Tigers in Comerica Park, and hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat off starting pitcher Justin Verlander. Eventually, Napoli worked his way to become the Angels' regular starting catcher. In 2006, Napoli hit .228 with 16 home runs in 268 at-bats. He was fourth among AL catchers in errors, with 8, in 96 games at catcher. 2007 Los Angeles Angels in 2007 Napoli began 2007 as the Opening Day starting catcher, and split time with José Molina through the first half of the season. The second half of the season was injury-marred for Napoli, as he suffered a sprained ankle on a game-winning play at the plate during the final game before the All-Star break, causing him to miss 12 games. He then suffered a strained hamstring only five games after returning, causing him to miss all of August. For the season, Napoli hit .247 with 10 home runs, appearing in only 75 games. He was fifth among Al catchers in errors, with 7. 2008 Napoli again was the Angels Opening Day starter at catcher, and after recovering from his 2007 injuries, began the 2008 season by hitting six home runs in April. Napoli continued to share time behind the plate with Jeff Mathis, who had assumed the back-up duties after the Angels trade of Molina during the 2007 season. Napoli again was injured in July, causing him to miss 28 games with shoulder issues. However, after recovering from the injury, Napoli led all of Major League Baseball with a .457 batting average in the month of September. For the season, Napoli tallied a .273 batting average and 20 home runs, both career highs, and a .960 OPS. On defense, he was 5th in the AL in passed balls, with 7. The Angels won the 2008 American League West Division championship, with a 100–62 record. During Game 3 of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Boston Red Sox, with the Red Sox holding a 2–0 series lead, Napoli hit two home runs against Red Sox starting pitcher Josh Beckett, helping extend the game into extra innings. He then singled and scored the game- winning run in the 11th inning, helping the Angels avoid playoff elimination. 2009 Napoli continued to compete with Jeff Mathis for the leading catcher spot in 2009. He also started 18 games at designated hitter while teammate Vladimir Guerrero was injured. Napoli set or matched career highs in games played (114), at bats (382), runs scored (60), hits (104), doubles (22), and RBIs (56). He also finished the season with a .272 batting average and hit 20 home runs for the second season in a row. On defense, he led AL catchers in errors, with 8, and allowed 74 stolen bases (5th-most in the AL). 2010 In 2010, the Angels reduced Napoli's playing time at DH after signing Japanese slugger Hideki Matsui. Napoli went into spring training with a bigger glove and worked on fundamentals in hopes of getting more playing time as a catcher. Napoli wound up playing the majority of the 2010 season at first base. He made his first major league start at first base on May 30, after regular first baseman Kendrys Morales broke his lower leg in a walk-off celebration. With the loss of Morales for the season, and the return of fellow catcher Jeff Mathis from the disabled list, Napoli started 70 games at first base, posting a .989 fielding percentage, as he was fifth in the AL with 6 errors. Napoli set career highs in several categories, most notably home runs (26). He was 7th in the AL in strikeouts (137), in 453 at bats. Napoli also became the Angels all-time leader in home runs by a catcher during the 2010 season. =Texas Rangers= 2011 On January 21, Napoli was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with outfielder Juan Rivera in exchange for outfielder Vernon Wells. Four days later, he was traded by the Blue Jays to the Texas Rangers in exchange for pitcher Frank Francisco. On May 29, he was involved in a controversial game-ending play at home plate in the ninth inning in a game against the Kansas City Royals. Napoli was at first and Elvis Andrus was up against Joakim Soria. Andrus hit a shot past Eric Hosmer that got into right field. Napoli was sent home by the third-base coach. Hosmer threw the ball to the plate. Brayan Pena tagged Napoli on the upper shoulder, but Napoli was called safe by the home-plate umpire, giving the Rangers a walk-off win. Pena was enraged and arguing with the umpires with manager Ned Yost. Replays showed that Pena did not block the plate, but tagged Napoli, who got his feet in just before the tag. In Napoli's first season with the Rangers, he batted .320 with 30 home runs (10th in the American League) and 75 RBIs, while improving his defense (throwing out 36% of base-stealers; 4th-best in the league). He had a .631 slugging percentage in 369 at bats. In Game 5 of the 2011 World Series, Napoli hit a two-run double in the bottom of the eighth inning to give the Rangers a 4-2 lead. The Rangers held on to win and take a 3-games-to-2 lead in the series, but eventually lost the World Series Championship to the St. Louis Cardinals in 7 games. 2012 Texas Rangers in 2012 On February 11, 2012, Napoli signed a one-year, $9.4 million deal to avoid arbitration with the Rangers. Napoli filed for $11.5 million, but the Rangers countered with $8.3 million. He received the second highest raise for anyone in their third or fourth time through the arbitration process, with Prince Fielder taking the top spot. In 2012 he batted .227, and was fifth in the AL in passed balls, with 8. He became a free agent after the season. =Boston Red Sox= On December 3, 2012, Napoli agreed to a three-year, $39 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, pending a physical examination. Following a six-week period during which the status of the deal was in question after his physical showed signs of a hip issue, Napoli came to terms with the Red Sox on a one-year, $5 million deal with incentives that could make the deal worth $13 million. The incentives were to stay on the active roster for at least 165 days (which Napoli achieved), or get up to 625 plate appearances with at least 120 days on the roster. 2013 Boston Red Sox in 2013 On April 22, 2013, Napoli hit his fourth career grand slam in a 9-6 win over the Oakland Athletics. On September 15, 2013, Napoli struck out for the 178th time of the season, passing Mark Bellhorn to be the new Red Sox franchise leader in strikeouts in a season. Upon his strikeout, Napoli threw his bat and helmet in frustration and argued with home plate umpire Ron Kulpa and was ejected for the first time in his Major League career. For the 2013 season, Napoli batted .259 with 23 home runs, 92 RBI, and struck out 187 times, 4th-most in the AL and the most ever by a Red Sox player.https://www.baseball- reference.com/teams/BOS/leaders_bat_season.shtml In Game 3 of the 2013 ALCS against the Detroit Tigers, Napoli hit a solo home run off Justin Verlander for the game's only run in a 1-0 Boston win.Boston holds off Tigers 1-0 behind Lackey, bullpen cbssports.com wire reports, October 15, 2013. Although Napoli played more games at catcher than at any other position in each of his seasons with the Angels and Rangers, he did not catch a single game for the Red Sox in 2013, playing almost entirely at first base, with a few games as a designated hitter. During Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2013 World Series, with the DH rule not in effect per National League rules, regular DH David Ortiz played first base and Napoli was taken out of the lineup rather than moved to catcher. After 6 games against the St. Louis Cardinals, Napoli received his first career championship ring as the Red Sox won their eighth World Series. He agreed to re-sign with the Red Sox on a two-year deal worth $32 million on December 6, 2013. 2014 During 2014, Napoli dealt with injuries throughout the season. He broke his finger in an early season game vs the Chicago White Sox. Napoli returned, but finger problems and sleep apnea took him out of the lineup for much of the late season. He was fifth in the AL among first basemen, with 8 errors. 2015 Napoli struggled in 98 games for the Red Sox in 2015, hitting .207 with 99 strikeouts, 13 home runs, and 40 RBIs. On defense, he was third among AL first basemen in errors, with 7. =Second run with the Texas Rangers= On August 7, 2015, the Texas Rangers acquired Napoli from the Red Sox for a player to be named later or cash considerations. Manager Jeff Banister used Napoli against left-handed pitching and played him in left field. He played 35 games for the Rangers in 2015, making 91 plate appearances and batting .295 with five home runs, 10 RBI and a .513 SLG.

His great-uncle Saint Basinus had preceded his father as Archbishop of Trier. He was the great-grandson of Saint Sigrada and Saint Leodegarius was his great uncle. Early life Milo was the son of the Leudwinus of Trier and Willigard of Bavaria. He was born a nobleman and later styled Count of Trier. His brother was Wido (Gui), Count of Hornbach. Rotrude of Hesbaye was possibly his sister. Lambert of Maastricht was a kinsman. Milo received a monastic education. Prior to his ecclesiastical career, Milo also had a military career, something he had in common with his putative brother-in-law Charles Martel. It is not clear whether Milo received anything more than a diaconal ordination. Archbishop of Trier As the scion of one of the most powerful Frankish clans in Austrasia, Milo's future seemed secure. He succeeded his father as Archbishop of Trier becoming the third generation of his family to hold this position. Bishop of Reims When Charles Martel drove Saint Rigobert from Reims, Milo was appointed his successor. As bishop, Milo became a controversial figure for the Church. His avarice and fondness of earthly pleasures soon placed him in opposition with the church. Milo did not lead a spiritual life and flagrantly ignored the Rules of Saint Benedict that governed his colleagues. Paul Fouracre says that Boniface considered Milo and bishops like him \\"warlike, adulterous, and prone to help themselves to church property\\". Milo habitually used church property for his personal and political purposes, usually to indulge his illegitimate sons. He accumulated much of the riches of his dioceses and developed a reputation for corruption. Pope Zachary counseled Boniface about dealing with disreputable prelates such as Milo. \\"As for Milo and his like, who are doing great injury to the church of God, preach in season and out of season, according to the word of the Apostle, that they cease from their evil ways.\\" Accounts of Milo's time as bishop are collected in the Gesta Treverorum. Deposition Politically, Milo was a formidable opponent of Boniface's reforms of the church in the eastern Frankish Empire. However, when Milo's own behavior invited the criticism of Pope Zachary, Boniface seized the opportunity and began a campaign to have Milo replaced. In March 744, Boniface successfully pursued the Council of Soissons to remove Milo as Archbishop of Trier. By that time, Milo's behavior had become so repugnant even his formidable political connections could not save him. Though he put up a lengthy resistance, Milo was deposed as bishop and replaced by Abel. Death Milo was killed by a wild boar in a hunting accident in Meulenwald near Trier sometime between 753 and 758. Since the 4th century, it had been a tradition to bury the bishops of Trier in the crypt at St. Maximin's Abbey in Trier. However, due to his controversial life, Milo was not given this honor and was instead buried near the scene of the accident where a memorial, The Cross of Milo, was erected.

He served four terms as Lord Mayor of Cork. Hickey was one of twelve children in his family and was a native of Ballinagar, Mallow, County Cork. He moved to Cork at the age of 27 and found employment first with the Cork Steam Packet Company and later with John Daly and Company, then-manufacturers of Tanora. He joined the Labour Party about this time and became a trade union official. In 1931 he married Eileen Kiernan, with whom he had four children. Hickey first stood for the Dáil at the 1937 general election for the Cork Borough constituency, but narrowly missed being elected. He was more successful at the 1938 general election, unseating Richard Anthony, a former Labour TD who left the Party in the 1920s and sat as an independent. Hickey made international headlines in February 1939, when, as Lord Mayor of Cork, he refused to give a civic reception to the captain and crew of the German warship SMS Schlesien which was on a 'courtesy visit' to Cork Harbour flying the Nazi flag (in spite of Irish neutrality). The Schlesien was a 13,000 tonne World War I battleship. Hickey's reasoning for the refusal to entertain the German crew was stated to be a slight by the German media on the occasion of the death of Pope Pius XI some time earlier. Hickey said, \\"the insult given to the Catholic world on the death of the Pope, when the responsible German Press termed our Holy Father a political adventurer”.Irish Times, 27 February 1939.See tribute from Michael O'Riordan, Communist Party of Ireland, to Hickey (part of speech to Labour Party conference, Cork, 1999).

He was a French author known for his writings on the ancient astronaut theme.Colavito, Jason. (2005). The Cult of Alien Gods: H.P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture. Prometheus Books. p. 138. \\"French author Robert Charroux was among the first to expand on the ancient-astronaut theme\\". Career Charroux worked for the French post office and wrote eight works of fiction between 1942-1946 using the pseudonym Saint-Saviol. He also wrote the scripts for a French comic strip, Atomas, about an atomic-powered superhero, appearing in the weekly magazine Mon Journal in the late 1940s. For the same magazine Charroux wrote a science fiction adventure in serial form, \\"Prof. Barthelemy's Flying Island.\\" He first began using the pseudonym Charroux in 1942, that became his regular pseudonym from 1962 onwards. Robert Charroux married Yvette Bernuchot in April 1930. They lived in rue St Sulpice in Paris during the late 1950s. In 1976 he began making plans to be buried in the cemetery of Charroux. Ancient astronauts Charroux was a pioneer of the theory of ancient astronauts, publishing at least six non-fiction works in this genre in the last decade of his life, including One Hundred Thousand Years of Man's Unknown History (1963, 1970), Forgotten Worlds (1973), Masters of the World (1974), The Gods Unknown (1964, 1974) and Legacy of the Gods (1965, 1974). The influence that Charroux's first work (in its 1963 version) had on Erich Von Däniken's first books (ca. 1966), as well as the influence that Von Däniken's early books had on Charroux, is widely appreciated, but Von Däniken seems to have been equally familiar with an earlier French work, The Morning of the Magicians by Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier (1960), which is likely to have been a direct inspiration for both Charroux and Von Däniken. Charroux's publisher contacted Von Däniken's in March 1968 concerning evidence of plagiarism, with the result that later printings of Chariots of the Gods and Return to the Stars at least mentioned Charroux in the bibliography. Charroux's theories concerning Ancient Astronauts were criticised by French archaeologist Jean-Pierre Adam in 1975.Jean-Pierre Adam, L'archéologie devant l'imposture (Paris, Robert Laffont 1975). His works have been described as pseudohistory.Legrand, H. E; Boese, Wayne E. (1975). Chariots of the Gods? And All That: Pseudo-History in the Classroom. The History Teacher. Vol. 8, No. 3, pp. 359-370. Other views Some see his works as examples of Celticism. Celticism, similar to Nordicism, was a popular Nationalistic movement in France and Celtic countries in the early 20th century. He suggested in his book Lost Worlds: Scientific Secrets of the Ancients, that the Mayans and ancient Peruvians were ancient Celtic migrants. According to Charroux, the candle stick of the Andes and the Nasca Lines were created by a pre-Celtic civilization, perhaps the same as those who created the Long Man of Wilmington of Sussex in England.Charroux, Robert. (1974). Lost Worlds: Scientific Secrets of the Ancients. Fontana. p. 97 He also related the white skinned Gods mentioned in the Popul Vuh to ancient Celts from Hyperborea. Writing in his book Lost Worlds Charroux rejected evolution, instead he argued for human devolution. Charroux claimed that man is regressing and was superior in the past; he claimed that \\"Atlantis and Mu are not dreams of spiritualists, but realities of a mysterious era\\". He further explained that the Atlantans and Hyperboreans were the ancestors of modern humans, and the first humans on earth were originally extraterrestrial.Charroux, Robert. (1974). Lost Worlds: Scientific Secrets of the Ancients. Fontana. pp. 39-44 Unlike most ancient astronaut writers, Charroux took a large interest in racialism. According to Charroux, Hyperborea was situated between Iceland and Greenland and was the home of a Nordic White race with blonde hair and blue eyes. Charroux claimed that this race was extraterrestrial in origin and had originally come from a cold planet situated far from the sun.Charroux, Robert. (1974). The Mysterious Past. Futura Publications Ltd. pp. 29-30 Charroux also claimed that the White race of the Hyperboreans and their ancestors the Celts had dominated the whole world in the ancient past. Some of these beliefs have influenced Esoteric Nazism such as the work of Miguel Serrano.Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas. (2003). Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity. pp. 117-118Godwin, Joscelyn. (2010). Atlantis and the Cycles of Time: Prophecies, Traditions, and Occult Revelations. pp. 55-57 Rennes-le-Château Robert Charroux developed an active interest in the alleged treasure of Rennes-le- Château, following up claims made by Noel Corbu in the local press in 1956 that it was discovered by Bérenger Saunière during the late 19th century. In 1958, with his wife Yvette and Denise Carvenne,https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0142536/ member of The Treasure Seekers' Club (that he founded in 1951), he scanned the village and its church for treasure using a metal detector.

This organization was formed and chartered as a nonprofit organization in Louisville Kentucky. President George Parker based on the wishes of the membership; filed the request for incorporation in the latter part of 1949 The IAAI received its charter December 4, 1951. The State of Kentucky required an “Annual verification of IAAI Incorporation” filed with the Secretary of State. This was to include the name of an individual within the State of Kentucky who would be responsible for any actions of the IAAI. George Parker (President 1949-50) was the first to fill this position followed by John T. Underwood (State Fire Marshal, Frankfort Kentucky). The official title within the State of Kentucky was “Corporation Process Agent”; the individual holding the position became an Ex-Officio Member of the IAAI Board of Directors. Thus, the IAAI became a viable and functional association due to the need and necessity of training and education in the uncharted waters of fire and arson investigation, which was non-existent at that time. The first comprehensive organizational study of the International Association of Arson Investigators was conducted in 1999. The consultant retained to conduct that study presented the IAAI Board of Directors with a report of the results of his study, entitled “Preparing for the Challenges of the 21st Century, A Study in Organizational Effectiveness\\".The methodology employed in the preparation of the first study included soliciting input from the existing Board, Committees, Chapters, Executive Director, Office Manager, staff and other stakeholder groups. A strategic plan was ultimately developed by the consultant and adopted by the Board in 2000. That plan established goals, objectives and strategies for the association to pursue. Specific action plans designated as 1, 3 and 5-year goals were identified. The document has been available for the entire membership on the IAAI website. In the fall of 2003 President Sneed appointed a Strategic Planning Committee. The committee was charged with reviewing the current plan and development of the next 5-year strategic plan. The committee consisted of 2nd VP Kirk Hankins, Executive Director Alan Clark, Director Tom Fee, Director Joe Sesniak and Chapters Committee Chair Roger Krupp. A strategic plan is the roadmap of any business or association and requires constant review and referral by the governing body to succeed. The committee recognizes the trust placed in us by the Executives and Board. The committee has come to realize the enormity of such an undertaking however an appreciation of the importance of the work has been our inspiration.

It is Child ballad 275 (Roud 115). According to Child, it was first published by David Herd.Herd, David (1732-1810): Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads etc. Synopsis Illustration by Arthur Rackham of Get Up and Bar the Door The story begins with the wife busy in her cooking of the pudding and house hold chores as well. As the wind picks up, the husband tells her to close and bar the door. They make an argument that the next person who speaks must bar the door or close the door, but the door remains open. At midnight two thieves enter the house and eat the puddings that the wife has just made. The husband and wife watch them, but still neither speaks out of stubborn and pride. Amazed, one of the thieves proposes to molest the wife and kiss her. Finally, the husband shouts \\"Will ye kiss my wife before my een, and scald me with pudding-broth?\\" The wife, having won the argument, walks up and gave three skips on the floor and said to her husband: \\"Goodman, you've spoken the foremost word, Get up and bar the door.\\" THE END In some versions, the husband is named as Johnie Blunt of Crawford Moor.Child Vol. VIII p. 125 Child notes that the song was used by Prince Hoare to provide one of the principal scenes in his musical entertainment, No Song, No Supper, performed at Drury Lane in 1790. Among many things, this folk ballad talks about the sense of lasting competition in a relationship. The man tries to maintain his power but the woman refuses because she does not want to be treated like a doormat; each is too stubborn to do something that will benefit both. The ballad makes the point that being stubborn can be carried to ludicrous lengths, since by being stubborn they lost their Martinmas puddings and left their persons and household open to crime.

Biography =Family and early life= In his memoirs Prishtina wrote that his family originated from Poljance in the Drenica region, where his ancestors gave valuable contribution to the Albanian culture and revolts against the Ottoman Empire. He wrote that his grandparent Haxhi Ali Berisha, who moved to Vıçıtırın/Vushtrri in 1871, was the son of Abdullah Ali Berisha. Haxhi's younger son, Ahmet was the father of Hasan. Prishtina said that family's links to the Drenica region were celebrated with songs and other traditions. According to Ivo Banac and Miranda Vickers, Hasan was a member of the Serb Šišković clan of Vučitrn/Vushtrri, whom Serbs held as traitors. However, this claim is unfounded in facts and very contradictory with the history of the Berisha family, which was autochthonous in the province of Dukagjini, where Vucitrn/Vushtrri is also part. Archival research done by Muhamet Pirraku confirms Hasan Prishtina's writings, and points that some documents give an alternative name of Abdullah Ali Berisha, Mehmet. Hasan was born in 1873 in Vıçıtırın/Vushtrri and had one brother named Ymer. After finishing the French gymnasium in Thessaloniki, he studied politics and law in Istanbul. He was originally known as \\"Hasan Berisha\\". He initially supported the Young Turk Revolution of 1908. Prishtina was elected to the Ottoman parliament in 1908 and became affiliated to the Young Turk (CUP) party. He changed his last name into Prishtina in 1908, when he was elected as the Pristina delegate in the Ottoman parliament in Istanbul during the Second Constitutional Era. Actions by the Ottoman government against rebels and civilians in Kosovo during 1909 led Prishtina to publish an article titled \\"Albanians\\" in the Young Turk newspaper Tanin. He stressed that force was unproductive and unable to bring peace and security while reforms were needed following the example of Midhat Pasha. As a parliamentarian Prishtina viewed the place of Albanians in the empire as partners entitled in the decision-making process which was partly based upon ethnic politics. He expressed that sentiment in an analogy delivered to parliament in early May 1911. Prishtina defined the Ottoman state as a \\"joint stock company with common interest... owned by Turks, Albanians, and other peoples, [all] with equal shares\\" and without anyone \\"deserving preferential treatment\\". By late 1911, Prishtina had joined the Freedom and Accord Party which was founded by him and ten others who were opponents of the Young Turks and advocated for Ottomanism, government decentralisation and the rights of ethnic minorities. In 1911 Prishtina wrote a chapter on the revolt by Albanian highlanders (Malësors) and highlighted their important duties involving border defense in an edited book titled Musaver Arnavud (The Illustrated Albanian) in Ottoman Turkish by Dervish Hima. =Albanian National Movement= During December 1911, Prishtina and Ismail Qemali convened secret meetings of Albanian political notables in Istanbul that decided to organise a future Albanian uprising. Mehmed V dissolved parliament and called for new elections on 17 January 1912 with Prishtina going to Kosovo shortly thereafter to begin the organisation of the uprising. In the Ottoman elections of April 1912, the CUP won most parliamentary seats by rigging the election and prevented its Albanian critics like Prishtina from retaining their positions. After the Ottoman Government did not keep their promises for more rights and independence to the Albania nation, Hasan Prishtina and several other prominent Albanian intellectuals started organizing the Albanian National Movement. He together with Isa Boletini and Bajram Curri took the responsibility to start the Albanian National Movement in Kosovo. In 1912, due to the deteriorating situation between Albanians and Ottoman authorities, Prishtina alongside other Albanian leaders were present at a meeting in Junik on 20 May where a besa (pledge) was given to wage war on the Young Turk government. Prishtina took an active part in the 1912 uprising in Kosovo and formulated the autonomy demands that were submitted to the Turkish government in August 1912, the so-called Fourteen Points of Hasan Prishtina. Üsküp, capital of the Kosovo vilayet, after being captured by Albanian revolutionaries Until August 1912, Prishtina led the Albanian rebels to gain control over the whole Kosovo vilayet (including Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Priština and even Skopje), part of Scutari Vilayet (including Elbasan, Përmet, Leskovik and Konitsa in Janina Vilayet and Debar in Monastir Vilayet. Marshall Ibrahim Pasha was sent by the Ottomans to negotiate terms and on 9 August met with leaders of the uprising where Prishtina presented the Fourteen Points and the commander then sent them to Istanbul and returned to his army. Prishtina however retreated from insisting upon autonomy that disappointed some Albanian nationalists. On 18 August, the moderate faction led by Prishtina managed to convince leaders Boletini, Curri, Riza Bey Gjakova and Idriz Seferi of the conservative group to accept the agreement with the Ottomans for Albanian sociopolitical and cultural rights. In assisting to formulate the Fourteen Points, in part secured by Kosovo Albanian military action against the Ottomans, Prishtina in his role as a Kosovar notable and Albanian patriot balanced national and regional concerns. =Albanian Independence and World War I= During the Balkan Wars he was arrested by commanders from the Kingdom of Serbia. In December 1913, after Albanian independence, he served as Minister of Agriculture, and in March 1914 was made minister of postal services in the government of Independent Albania led by Ismail Qemali. During the First World War he organized divisions of volunteers to fight for Austria- Hungary. In 1918, after the Serb recapture of Kosovo from Austria-Hungary, Prishtina, together with Bajram Curri, fled to Vienna and later to Rome, where he was in contact with Croatian, Macedonian and Montenegrin opponents of the new Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Hasan Prishtina became a head of the Committee for the National Defence of Kosovo in Rome in 1918. =Political career= University of Prishtina Hasan Prishtina was in charge of the delegation of the Committee in December 1919 which represented Albanians for the protection of their rights in the Paris Peace Conference, where he requested the unification of Kosovo and Albania. The Kosovar delegation was, however, not given leave to participate in the debates. Prishtina then returned to Albania where in January 1920 he helped organise the Congress of Lushnjë and in April 1921 became a member of parliament for Dibra. He took part in a coup d'état that year and served as Prime Minister for a brief five days from 7 to 12 December, but was forced out of office by Ahmet Zogu, who was a Minister of Interior at that time and regarded it as imperative to avoid conflict with Belgrade. Thereafter, Hasan helped organise uprisings in Kosovo and led several anti-government insurrections in Albania, the latter being easily suppressed by the administrations of Xhafer Bej Ypi and Ahmet Zogu. He returned to Tirana during the Democratic Revolution of 1924 under Fan Noli, whom he accompanied to the League of Nations in Geneva. =Exile and death= When Zogu took power in December 1924, Prishtina was forced to leave Albania. As he could not return to Kosovo, he settled in Thessalonika where he purchased a large estate. Prishtina was an enemy of Zogu, the two having attempted to assassinate one another. He was imprisoned by the Yugoslav police for a period, but was released in 1931. In 1933, he was killed by Ibrahim Celo in a cafe in Thessalonika, on the orders of the Yugoslav government. Legacy Hasan Prishtina is commemorated in Kosovo and Albania. In 1993, when a meeting commemorating the 60th anniversary of his death was convened in Kosovo Mitrovica, Serbian police raided the place and showed machine guns to the participants. Out of 80 participants, 37 were arrested and the rest were beaten for 5 to 15 minutes by police. In 2012 a statue of Prishtina was elevated in Skopje in Skanderbeg Square . Hasan Bej Prishtina is honoured by the Albanians as an important national hero and freedom fighter. A primary school in Tirana and the University of Prishtina are named after him. On 2 May 2014, he was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit of the National Flag by the Albanian President Bujar Nishani.

It is obtained by heating dried biomass without oxygen in a reactor at a temperature of about 500 °C with subsequent cooling. Pyrolysis oil is a kind of tar and normally contains levels of oxygen too high to be considered a pure hydrocarbon. This high oxygen content results in non-volatility, corrosiveness, immiscibility with fossil fuels, thermal instability, and a tendency to polymerize when exposed to air. As such, it is distinctly different from petroleum products. Removing oxygen from bio-oil or nitrogen from algal bio-oil is known as upgrading.  Standards  There are few standards for pyrolysis oil because of limited efforts to produce it. One of the few standards is from ASTM.Standard Specification for Pyrolysis Liquid Biofuel http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7544.htm  Feedstock decomposition  Pyrolysis is a well established technique for decomposition of organic material at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen into oil and other constituents. In second-generation biofuel applications—forest and agricultural residues, waste wood, yard waste, and energy crops can be used as feedstock. = Wood Pyrolysis = { style=\\"background:#F9F9F9; border:1px solid #AAA; padding:5px; float:right; margin-left:20px;\\"  { style=\\"font- size:12px; text-align:left;\\" + style=\\"text-align:left; padding-left:5px; padding-bottom:10px; font-size:13.5px;\\"  Derivation of a wood-tar creosote from resinous woods  360px } } When wood is heated above 270 °C it begins a process of decomposition called carbonization. In the absence of oxygen, the final product is charcoal. If sufficient oxygen is present, the wood will burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400-500 °C and the catch fire and fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, the moisture is first driven off and until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100-110 °C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises, and at about 270 °C it begins to spontaneously decompose and generate heat. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in the burning of charcoal. At this stage evolution of carbonization by-products starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450 °C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%), with the remainder being tar-like substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600 °C to produce Biochar, a high-carbon, fine-grained residue that today is produced through modern pyrolysis processes, which is the direct thermal decomposition of biomass in the absence of oxygen, which prevents combustion, to obtain an array of solid (biochar), liquid—Pyrolysis oil (bio-oil/pyrolysis-oil), and gas (syngas) products. The specific yield from the pyrolysis is dependent on process conditions. such as temperature, and can be optimized to produce either energy or biochar. (\\"Assuming that the energy in syngas is converted to electricity with an efficiency of 35%, the recovery in the life cycle energy balance ranges from CO2 MW-1 of electricity generated where the pyrolysis process is optimized for energy and 120 to MW-1 where biochar is applied to land. This compares to emissions of MW-1 for fossil-fuel-based technologies.) Temperatures of produce more char, while temperatures above favor the yield of liquid and gaseous fuel components. (See Table 1 for differences in output for Fast, Intermediate, Slow, and Gasification). Pyrolysis occurs more quickly at higher temperatures, typically requiring seconds instead of hours. High temperature pyrolysis is also known as gasification, and produces primarily syngas. Typical yields are 60% bio-oil, 20% biochar, and 20% syngas. By comparison, slow pyrolysis can produce substantially more char (~50%). For typical inputs, the energy required to run a “fast” pyrolyzer is approximately 15% of the energy that it outputs. \\"The energy required to operate a fast pyrolyzer is ∼15% of the total energy that can be derived from the dry biomass. Modern systems are designed to use the syngas generated by the pyrolyzer to provide all the energy needs of the pyrolyzer.\\" Modern pyrolysis plants can use the syngas created by the pyrolysis process and output 3–9 times the amount of energy required to run. = Algal Pyrolysis = Algae may be subjected to high temperatures (~500 °C) and normal atmospheric pressures. The resultant products include oil and nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. > There are numerous papers on the pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass. > However, very few reports are available for algal bio-oil production via > pyrolysis.

The crude-like oil (or bio-oil) has high energy density with a lower heating value of 33.8-36.9 MJ/kg and 5-20 wt% oxygen and renewable chemicals. The HTL process differs from pyrolysis as it can process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried in order to increase the yield. The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content. Per Algal HTL, the properties of the resulting bio-oil are affected by temperature, reaction time, algae species, algae concentration, reaction atmosphere, and catalysts, in subcritical water reaction conditions.  Bio-crude  Bio-oil typically requires significant additional treatment to render it suitable as a refinery feedstock to replace crude oil derived from petroleum, coal-oil, or coal-tar. Tar is a black mixture of hydrocarbons and free carbon obtained from a wide variety of organic materials through destructive distillation. Tar can be produced from coal, wood, petroleum, or peat. *Pine tar is a sticky material produced by the high temperature carbonization of pine wood in anoxic conditions (dry distillation or destructive distillation). The wood is rapidly decomposed by applying heat and pressure in a closed container; the primary resulting products are charcoal and pine tar. Pine tar consists primarily of aromatic hydrocarbons, tar acids and tar bases. Components of tar vary according to the pyrolytic process (e.g. method, duration, temperature) and origin of the wood (e.g. age of pine trees, type of soil and moisture conditions during tree growth). *Birch tar is a substance (liquid when heated) derived from the dry distillation of the bark of the birch tree. It is compounded of phenols such as guaiacol, cresol, xylenol and creosol (not to be confused with cresol). Wood-tar creosote is a colourless to yellowish greasy liquid with a smoky odor, produces a sooty flame when burned, and has a burned taste. It is non- buoyant in water, with a specific gravity of 1.037 to 1.087, retains fluidity at a very low temperature, and boils at 205-225 °C. When transparent, it is in its purest form. Dissolution in water requires up to 200 times the amount of water as the base creosote. The creosote is a combination of natural phenols: primarily guaiacol and creosol (4-methylguaiacol), which will typically constitute 50% of the oil; second in prevalence, cresol and xylenol; the rest being a combination of monophenols and polyphenols. Pitch is a name for any of a number of viscoelastic polymers. Pitch can be natural or manufactured, derived from petroleum, coal tarCOAL-TAR PITCH, HIGH TEMPERATURE or plants. Black liquor and Tall oil is a viscous liquid by-product of wood pulp manufacturing. Rubber oil is the product of the pyrolysis method for recycling used tires. Biofuel Biofuels are synthesized from intermediary products such as syngas using methods that are identical in processes involving conventional feedstocks, first generation and second generation biofuels. The distinguishing feature is the technology involved in producing the intermediary product, rather than the ultimate off-take. A Biorefinery is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, heat, and value-added chemicals from biomass. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's petroleum refinery, which produce multiple fuels and products from petroleum.Dr W J Smith, Tamutech Consultancy. Mapping the Development of UK Biorefinery Complexes , NNFCC, 2007-06-20. Retrieved on 2011-02-16. * Biodiesel is a diesel fuel derived from animal or plant lipids (oils and fats). A variety of oils can be used as biodiesel feedstock. * Wood diesel. A new biofuel was developed by the University of Georgia from woodchips. The oil is extracted and then added to unmodified diesel engines. Either new plants are used or planted to replace the old plants. The charcoal byproduct is put back into the soil as a fertilizer. This biofuel can actually be carbon negative not just carbon neutral. Carbon negative decreases carbon dioxide in the air reversing the greenhouse effect not just reducing it. * Algae fuels, can be produced from various types of Algae, and are dependent on the technique and the part of the cells used, some species of algae can produce 50% or more of their dry weight in the form of oil. The lipid, or oily part of the algae biomass can be extracted and converted into biodiesel through a process similar to that used for any other vegetable oil, or converted in a refinery into \\"drop-in\\" replacements for petroleum-based fuels. Algaculture can use waste materials such as sewage and without displacing land currently used for food production.

A. Mansoor (1881–1968) was an antiquarian who compiled an exquisite collection of Amarna Period sculptures. Early life and studies He was born to Coptic Orthodox Egyptian parents in Cairo in 1881. After having graduated from high school, with an excellent knowledge of Arabic, English and French, he taught Arabic for some years to foreign officials who occupied principal positions in the Egyptian Government. As early as his sixteenth year, the history of Ancient Egypt - the discipline of Egyptology itself - began to fascinate him. He bought books, became an ardent visitor to the Cairo Museum and traveled extensively in Egypt to admire and study the monuments of his ancestors. He learned much about Egyptian art, but was to learn much more later during his long career as an antiquarian. He studied Coptic and began to decipher hieroglyphics. Soon he also became deeply involved in the study of the art of Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia and the early Christian and Islamic worlds. He loved the antiquity of the Near and Middle East. He understood and appreciated their cultures and their many forms of art. But his first love and prime interest always remained Egypt. In this he excelled and in later years, he developed a distinguished reputation, which left no doubt as to his integrity and his masterful knowledge of every facet of Ancient Egyptian art and culture. http://www.mansooramarnacollection.com/album/MA_Mansoor.JPG Career In October 1904, he approached the Swiss manager of Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo, who was one of his students of Arabic. He asked to rent two showcases in the hotel lobby to display and sell to collectors the small collection of ancient Egyptian sculptures, bronzes, amulets, faience figurines and jewelry that he had acquired during the last few years. The manager was surprised at this request, but after some hesitation he allowed him the showcases on a trial basis for a few months. A year and a half later, the two showcases became a small shop in the main hall of the famous hotel. At that time, Mansoor's business was established. In later years, he opened two more shops in the Semiramis and Continental Hotels and a large gallery across the street from the Cairo Museum. The purchase and sale of Egyptian and other antiquities was at the time legal, though the Egyptian Department of Antiquities retained the right to inspect all shops and galleries that bought and sold these artifacts. If an important object was found, of which there was no known example in the Cairo Museum, the Department of Antiquities exercised its right to purchase it at a reasonable price. This, however, seldom happened as the Department rarely had the funds to acquire major antiquities. During his many years in the antique business, M. A. Mansoor met and befriended several of the Egyptologists, antiquarians and collectors of the time. The list of names would be too long to enumerate here, but some should be mentioned: James Quibell, Ernesto Schiaparelli, Wilhelm Spiegelberg, Sir Gaston Maspero, Georg Steindorff, Percy Newberry, Wallis Budge, Pierre Lacau, Arthur Weigall, Charles Boreux, Howard Carter, Lord Carnarvon, Étienne Drioton, Sami Gabra, Alexandre Varille, Christiane Desroches Noblecourt, Ambrose Lansing, William Stevenson Smith, the Khawam brothers, Dikran Kelekian, William Randolph Hearst, King Alfonso XIII of Spain, King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, King Prajadhipok of Siam, King Carol I of Romania, King Fuad and his son King Farouk of Egypt, Levi de Benzion, Achilles Groppi, and Nigel S. Warren. To most of these kings, scholars and gentlemen, M.A. Mansoor sold many important ancient works of art for their collections or museums. Hundreds of these masterpieces of Egyptian art are today in the world's leading museums: the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, the Louvre, the Vatican Museum, the Metropolitan Museum, The Detroit Museum and The Chicago Oriental Institute, etc., and in many private collections. In the early 1920s M.A. Mansoor started a collection of rare Amarna artifacts that stand today to be the Amarna World Largest Private Collection. Inside a Los Angeles bank vault reside 33 pieces from one of the most controversial collections of ancient Egyptian art in history. Virtually unknown to all but a handful of Egyptologists and archaeologists, this collection of antiquities from the Amarna period owned by the Mansoor family has been at the heart of unprecedented dispute between scientists and art historians for over fifty years. Each side's opinion is diametrically opposed to the other. The ones say the Mansoor collection is authentic because the patina and the crust on the statues are genuine? The others say it's not because the stone is not right or man made stone? Who is right? The original players are now either aging or dead. Nevertheless, the controversy lives on. Although two experts only condemned it as a fake - out of the 28 who valued the collection since the end of the 1940s, the moral authority of these two made numerous followers over the years to the extent that today quite many Egyptologists, art historians or museums are convinced - most of the time without having seen the pieces at all - that the collection is a forgery.

Every object was dated to the best of his knowledge. Until the late 1930s, only a few scientific tests to study ancient works of art had been developed. The experts and antiquarians had to rely on their own knowledge of the styles of the many periods of Egyptian art. The microscope, and even the simple magnifying glass, often showed the careful observer the patination, erosion, or dendritic formations (the passing of time action, and the effect of burial in wet soil or sand on the surface of the object under study). Ethic M.A. Mansoor strongly believed that every work of ancient art had a soul of its own. \\"It will speak to you\\", he used to say. \\"It has a feeling of its own, and it will tell you if it was made by an artist who lived, thought and was part of a bygone society.\\" His intuition, guided by his knowledge, was phenomenal. He had that innate talent to recognize the ancient Egyptian works of art. After Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamon's tomb in 1922, tourists and art lovers from all over the world began to visit Egypt in ever increasing numbers. Mansoor's business flourished; there was a constant demand for antiquities. The stories he told of these years were fabulous. These were the years when he made the acquaintance of eminent persons in the field of Egyptology who were to become his teachers, advisers, friends and customers. But above all, he was serving the better interest of Egyptology. External links *The M. A.

Although technically the band's first release, the album Awaiting Your Reply four years later is considered by most to be the band's official debut. Recording history The cassette, featuring the kind of hard rock for which Resurrection Band would eventually become known, was recorded not long after the Jesus People USA community had moved from Minneapolis to Chicago, but before they found a permanent home in Uptown. The record was created in the basement of friend Gary Rotta entirely on headphones, so as not to wake Rotta's wife, who was asleep when the band recorded. However, the mixing board had been used many years previously to record one of Elvis Presley's number-one hits. The tape was recorded in the same period than All Your Life, both of which were given away at their concerts. All your life was an independent set of acoustic numbers, a reflection of folk-oriented sets that were played at conservative venues, like nursing homes and churches, whose audiences would otherwise be unreceptive to the borderline heavy metal that Resurrection Band otherwise played and which were contained in the rock set Music To Raise the Dead. \\"We went into his little basement studio and we recorded an acoustic set, which we had maintained for a number of years. So that was the 'All Your Life' tape. And then 'Music To Raise The Dead' which was just the rock set. That was really the thing that we were about. We released both. We went in and probably over a period of three or four days recorded both little cassette tapes. I don't even remember how many we pressed up of each, but we sold out in just a few months.\\" The cassette was re-released in a limited number of copies by the band's own label, Grrr Records, in 1992.

It is located to the south of and below the high ground of Clifton, and directly to the north of the Floating Harbour. The southern entrance to the Avon Gorge, which connects the docks to the sea, lies at the western end of Hotwells. The eastern end of the area is at the roundabout where Jacobs Well Road meets Hotwell Road. Hotwells is split between the city wards of Clifton, and Hotwells and Harbourside.Bristol City Council 2016 Ward Review Location Hotwells is approximately west of Bristol city centre lying just north of the Floating Harbour and the River Avon. To the north and some higher is the suburb of Clifton. Much of the built up area was originally salt marsh known as Rownham Mead. Nearly half of Rownham Mead was excavated in the early 19th century to construct the Cumberland Basin, part of the entrance lock system to the city docks. The west of the area marks the beginning of the Portway road which connects Bristol to Avonmouth, passing under the Clifton Suspension Bridge which lies about north of Hotwells. History Hotwells takes its name from the hot springs which bubble up through the rocks of the Avon Gorge underneath the Clifton Suspension Bridge. The springs were documented in 1480 by William Worcester, the 15th century chronicler and antiquary. He described the waters as being milky and as warm as those at Bath. In 1692 the Society of Merchant Venturers leased the springs and a pump room was built. The pump room of 1696 was demolished and replaced by Hotwells House in 1816 which was itself demolished when the river was widened in 1867. In the Georgian era, Hotwells was developed as a spa including the building of Dowry Square in an attempt to compete with Bath. Many visitors came, including the diarist John Evelyn and the travel writer Celia Fiennes, who hunted for Bristol Diamonds in the gorge. The Somerset historian John Collinson came to Hotwells in 1793 seeking recovery from an unspecified lingering illness and died there on 27 August 1793. The Jacobs Well Theatre, built in 1729, provided entertainment for visitors and Bristolians, however Hotwells never attained the same status as Bath, and eventually the waters were found to be polluted. A new pump room was built in 1822, but were demolished in 1867 to allow for widening of the River Avon. In 1799, the physician Thomas Beddoes opened the Pneumatic Institution in Dowry Square. Free treatment was advertised for those suffering from consumption, asthma, dropsy, \\"obstinate Venereal Complaints\\" and scrophula. The laboratory superintendent was Humphry Davy, who investigated nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, using equipment designed by James Watt. Under Davy's supervision laughing gas parties were held, attended by guests such as Robert Southey, Thomas Wedgwood and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. In the 20th century much of the housing in Hotwells was in a poor state of repair, but since the 1970s there has been refurbishment of the older Georgian properties and new housing built on derelict dockside wharves and along the Hotwell Road. Architecture Grenville Chapel, a Methodist church, was opened in 1839 in an Early English Style building. For many years it was used as a garage and is now housing association managed flats. Hotwells has several of Bristol's Grade II* listed buildings, including the Church of Holy Trinity, designed by Cockrell, and Albemarle Row, a Georgian terrace. Also listed is the Pump House, formerly the power plant for Bristol Harbour's bridges and other machinery, now a public house. Cultural references Hotwells features in two 18th century novels. The Expedition of Humphry Clinker, by Tobias Smollett has scenes set at the spa. Fanny Burney's Evelina is partly set in Hotwells, as the eponymous heroine visits Bristol during its spa-town years. Demographics The 2001 UK Census recorded Hotwells as two Super Output Area Lower Layers, 034A, the western part of Hotwells and 034C in the east. The latter layer included parts of Cliftonwood. The figures recorded in the two areas were broadly similar with 034A recording a population of 1,485, with about 58% being described as economically active, 17% students and 7% retired. 42% of homes were owner occupied. 50% of residents had university degrees or equivalent. 50% described themselves as Christian and 44% as having no religion. In 034C the figures were a population of 1,522 with about 66% being described as economically active, 12% students and 6.5% retired. 65% of homes were owner occupied. 55% of residents had university degrees or equivalent. 50% described themselves as Christian and 46% as having no religion. 1,438 persons in 034A were described as white, with 28 of mixed race, 19 Asian, 17 black and 18 Chinese. In 034C 1,374 were described as white, 33 of mixed race, 24 Asian, 24 black and 29 Chinese. Education The area is served by two schools, Hotwells Primary School and St George C of E Primary School. The latter has been under threat of closure by Bristol City Council, but is now to be re-evaluated in 2013. The nearest secondary schools are Ashton Park School, Cotham School and Bristol Cathedral Choir School. Transport John Hassell Towards the end of the 19th century, the western end of the district was the location of a terminus of a Bristol Tramways route, Hotwells railway station was the city terminus of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier line to Avonmouth, the lower terminus of the Clifton Rocks Railway, the Rownham Ferry which crossed the River Avon to Bower Ashton, the locks giving access to the Floating Harbour, and the landing stages used by passenger steamers. In the 1920s, the A4 Portway Road was driven through the Avon Gorge to provide better access from the city to Avonmouth Docks, in the process removing all signs of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier's station. Since the 1960s, the western end of Hotwells has been dominated by a flyover complex, which enables traffic from the city centre and the A4 Portway to cross the river and harbour entrance locks to access the south west of the city. Public transport links include buses serving Weston-super-Mare, Clevedon and Portishead which pass through the area. There is a ferry service to the city centre and Temple Meads railway station. Politics Hotwells is part of the Bristol City Council wards of Clifton, Hotwells and Harbourside.Hotwells and Harbourside Ward Map Clifton is currently represented by two councillors from the Green Party, and Hotwells and Harbourside by a single Liberal Democrat councillor.Bristol City Council Ward Search The Parliamentary constituency is Bristol West; the MP since 2015 is Thangam Debbonaire of the Labour Party. Hotwells is represented in the European Parliament by the six MEPs of the South West England constituency. Community Hotwells and Cliftonwood Community Association (HCCA), is a registered charity run by volunteers to improve the quality of life for those who live and work locally. For many years HCCA ran the Hope Centre in the listed Georgian Hope Chapel, which provided a base for community groups and offered a programme of arts events. The Hope Centre closed in 2001 following a loss of funding and the lease was surrendered to the owners, the Congregational Federation. Since 1981 the Hotwells Pantomime group has performed in Hope Chapel every year. The cast and crew are all local and give their time to raise money for local charities and have a great time too.

Shaded areas represent tektite finds. The Australasian strewnfield is the youngest and largest of the tektite strewnfields, with recent estimates suggesting it may cover 10%-30% of the Earth's surface. Details The c. 790,000-year-old strewnfield (Schneider, 1992) includes most of Southeast Asia (Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Southern China). The material from the impact stretches across the ocean to include the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Java. It also reaches far west out into the Indian Ocean, and south to Australia and Tasmania. Since the 1960s, it has been accepted that the strewn field included Hainan in southern China to Australia or about 10% of the Earth's surface. This was later extended by finds in Africa and Tasmania to 20%. Recent additional finds in northern Tibet and Guangxi increased the strewnfield to about 30% of the Earth's surface, or almost 150 million km2, or about the size of the entire world's landmass. Impact crater The Earth Impact Database lists about 26 known craters younger than a million years old, almost all of which are less than 2 km in diameter (except the 3 km Agoudal Crater). Very close to this time frame is the 14-km Zhamanshin crater in Kazakhstan which at one time (Glass, 1979) was proposed as the source of the Australasian strewn field. However, due to the enormous size of the Australasian strewn field, the impact crater has been conjectured to be significantly larger than the known ones. Schmidt and Wasson (1993) suggested it could be a 14–17 km crater beneath the Mekong Valley, Schnetzler (1996) considered a 35–40 km structure in southern Laos, Hartung and Koeberl (1994) proposed the elongated 100 km x 35 km Tonlé Sap lake in Cambodia, while Glass (1994) estimated it to be between 32 and 114 km in diameter in Cambodia. Glass (1999) also suggested southern Laos or an adjacent area as a possible source. More recently, Lee and Wei (2000) gave its size as 90 to 116 km and P. Ma et al. (2001) using beryllium-10 postulated the crater as between southern Laos and Hainan, possibly within the Gulf of Tonkin. In 2019, Sieh et al. proposed on the basis of 4 lines of evidence that the crater lies buried beneath the Bolaven volcanic field in southern Laos. Alternatively, Wasson, who found layered tektites in central Thailand, conjectured it could have been a multiple impact event spread out over the region, though it seems this scenario also raises substantial problems. The Wilkes Land crater in Antarctica has been proposed as a possible source. It has also been suggested that the impact may have triggered the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal. Homo erectus Guangxi in southern China Archeological artifacts found with these tektites in Baise, Guangxi in southern China indicates that a Homo erectus population was living in the area during and after the impact. Stone tools have been found within the debris field along with a charcoal layer likely caused by fires from the impact. It has been suggested that the subsequent local deforestation after the fires allowed this population easier access to stones useful for tool-making.

History Bianca C. on her first voyage with Costa, off the coast of Genoa in 1959 Built during World War II at Construction Navales La Ciotat, a shipyard on the southern coast of France, the ship was first launched in June 1944 under the name Marechal Petain. Construction had not yet been completed, so the ship was towed to Port de Bouc, near Marseille, where she was scuttled by the Germans in August. When the hull was raised, it was renamed La Marseillaise and towed to Toulon before being returned to La Ciotat to be refitted as a cruise ship. When the remodeling was completed in July 1949, she sailed to Yokohama. In 1957, the ship was given the name Arosa Sky after being sold to Panama's Arosa Line. She was refitted again and became the company's flagship. She was chartered by the exchange organization American Field Service to bring students between the U.S. and Europe. Within two years Arosa Line was forced to sell the ship to Costa Line, an Italian company also known as Linea C. After that 1959 sale, the ship was renamed the Bianca C. (the second Costa C ship so named) for one of the owner's daughters, and was refurbished once again. The Bianca C.'s main route ran from Italy to Venezuela, including stops in the Caribbean. Sinking On the 21st in the afternoon she left La Guaira (Venezuela) for Granada and Tenerife (Canary Islands). On Sunday October 22, 1961, the Bianca C. docked off Grenada when an explosion occurred in the engine room in the early hours of the morning. One crewman died immediately, and eight others were injured. As fires broke out, approximately 700 passengers and crew scrambled to abandon the ship while Grenadian fishermen and boat owners, awakened by the noise of the explosion, near the harbor of St. George's rushed to help. Survivors were taken to the capital, where makeshift hospitals were hastily established to provide shelter and food. Because Grenada did not have the equipment to quench such a large fire, a call for help was sent and was received by the British frigate at Puerto Rico. It took two days for the Londonderry to arrive, and by that time the Bianca C. had begun to sink. The burning ship was in the main anchorage and would block the harbor if it sank there, so a Londonderry boarding party boarded the flaming ship to attach a towline. The anchor lines of the Bianca C. were burned, and today the anchors are still at the mouth of the St. George's harbor. Meanwhile, the Londonderry moved to tow the Bianca C., but the latter ship was listing to port. Thousands of Grenadians watched from the mountains as the tow progressed for six hours, but the Bianca C.. had only moved three miles (5 km) when a squall started and the towline broke. The Bianca C. sank quickly into of water, about a mile from the popular tourist beach at Grand Anse. Wreck In the 1970s, a Trinidadian firm salvaged the Bianca C.'s propellers and sold them for scrap. As the top of the ship is in only about of water, scuba divers can reach it and in the late 1980s and early 1990s some removed parts of the boat for souvenirs. In late 1992, the rear third of the ship was torn off and the ship began to deteriorate quickly, though at in length it is still the region's largest shipwreck. A bronze statue of Christ of the Abyss was given by the Costa Line to Grenada in appreciation of the country's hospitality, and the statue stands in the Carenage surrounding the harbor at St. George's. The Times named the Bianca C. as one of the top ten wreck diving sites in the world.

Beulah louise henry. Journal of the Patent Office Society, 19(8), 606-607. Famed for being a prolific inventor, Henry patented a wide number of products and innovations designed to improve daily life. Her work was so well known and respected, that as of 1937, she even had a museum exhibit dedicated to her in Osaka, Japan, which was seen as an inspiration to aspiring female Japanese inventors. Her inventions include a bobbin-free sewing machine and a vacuum ice cream freezer. She received 49 patents and had around 110 inventions total. Early life and education She was born in Raleigh, North Carolina,Entry for Walter R. Henry, 1910 U.S. Census, Charlotte, North Carolina the daughter of Walter R. and Beulah Henry. She was the granddaughter of former North Carolina Governor W. W. Holden and a direct descendant of President Benjamin Harrison. Like many great inventors, Beulah Louise Henry was not only a creative child, but an inquisitive one too. She enjoyed painting and music, but her favorite hobby was to point out things that she saw wrong and mention changes or innovations that could be made to improve them. At nine years old, she is noted to have begun drawing sketches of inventions and by 1912, at age 25, she had her first patent, for a vacuum ice cream freezer. From 1909 to 1912 she attended North Carolina Presbyterian College and Elizabeth College in Charlotte, North Carolina, where she submitted her first patents. Career as inventor - New York City She moved to New York City by 1924, where she founded two companies. She worked as an inventor for the Nicholas Machine Works from 1939 to 1955. She also served as a consultant for many companies that manufactured her inventions, including the Mergenthaler Linotype Company and the International Doll Company. She lived in New York hotels, belonged to a variety of scientific societies, and never married. While living in New York, Beulah Louise Henry established both Henry Umbrella and Parasol Company and later B.L. Henry Company. Inventions Unique from most inventors of the time, Henry's inventions did not always follow the same theme or category. One focus Henry had in terms of inventions was quality of life improving products for women. For instance, she invented a hair curler, vanity case, and a rubber sponge soap holder. One of her more prominent inventions was a \\"snap-on\\" parasol, which would allow women to change their parasol's pattern to match their outfit without needing to buy an entirely new parasol. Beulah Louise Henry also delved into the market of children's toys by inventing a new method for stuffing dolls. As a substitute to using traditional, heavy stuffing, Henry devised a way to inflate lifelike dolls and toys with rubber tubing, which reduced the toys' weight immensely. One of Henry's most famous inventions is the \\"Double Chain Stitch Sewing Machine\\", which was a speedier version of a sewing machine, which eliminated the usage of the bobbin and even allowed for the usage of smaller diameter threads without risk of malfunction. Another one of Henry's inventions, patented in 1936, was a tool that enabled the writing of multiple copies of a document on a typewriter without the usage of carbon paper. A partial list of Henry's inventions includes: * vacuum ice cream freezer (1912) * umbrella with a variety different colored snap-on cloth covers (1924) * the first bobbinless sewing machine (1940) * \\"Protograph\\" - worked with a manual typewriter to make four copies of a document (1932) * \\"Continuously-attached Envelopes\\" for mass mailings (1952) * \\"Dolly Dips\\" soap-filled sponges for children (1929) * \\"Miss Illusion\\" doll with eyes that could change color and close (1935) * Hair Curler (1925) * Parasol Bag (1925) * Umbrella Runner Shield Attachment (1926) * Water-Sport Apparatus (1927) * Poodle-Dog Doll (1927) * Ball Covering (1927) * Foot Covering (1927) * Sealing Device for Inflatable Bodies (1929) * Valve For Inflatable Articles (1929) * Henry Closure Construction (1930) * Henry Valve for Inflatable Articles (1931) * Duplicating Device for Typewriting Machines (1932) * Duplicating Attachment for Typewriters (1932) * Writing Machine (1936) * Multicopy Attachment for Typewriters (1936) * Movable Eye Structure for figure Toys (1935) * Double Chain Stitch Sewing Machine (1936) * Feeding and Aligning Device (1940) * Seam and Method of Forming Seams (1941) * Sewing Apparatus (1941) * Typewriting Machine (1941) * Device for Producing Articulate Sounds (1941) * Duplex Sound Producer (1944) * Continuously Attached Envelopes (1952) * Can Opener (1956) * Direct and Return Mailing Envelope (1962)  Quotes  \\"If necessity is the mother of invention, then resourcefulness is the father\\" \\"I invent because I cannot help it - new things just thrust themselves on me\\" Recognition Henry was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2006.

An externalized cost is known to economists as a negative externality. Business to society Fundamentally, cost externalization occurs when a company transfers some of its moral responsibilities as costs to the community directly or as degradation to the environment. For example, railroads and airlines transfer the cost of fuel, noise, and terminal infrastructure to the community. Airlines and auto manufacturers transfer the cost of degraded air quality to the community and the environment. By externalizing to the community or the environment, many true costs become lost in analysis because the true cost is non-quantifiable and neither the community nor the environment have effective advocates to recoup the damages. A major modern theme in the relationship of business to society is the society's ability (or inability) to resist this kind of externalization. In its extreme, society collapses as business realizes its profits. Business to market Cost externalizing is one of the steps a company may take to \\"shape up\\" or reduce overhead by down sizing a cost center or an unprofitable department. An example of cost externalizing would be using a global courier service (such as FedEx and UPS) to do all or most of the shipping and logistics work for the company. For a business to take on the responsibilities of worldwide shipping by itself would be too costly. It would be far more sensible to let a third party who specialize in shipping to take care of the task and pay them for it. =B2B cost externalization= Cost externalizing in no way should be considered a quick fix. Simply forcing suppliers and service providers to take on more responsibilities and cost is not a healthy externalization of cost. Careful operational forecasting must take place before taking steps towards cost externalization. Otherwise, there is no way to ascertain if cost externalizing would actually lower the operational cost of the company. To externalize cost, budgeting must also take place. Because the company will be paying out to a third party, the cost would be more clear than when the process took place in-house. This would in turn give a chance for the suppliers and service providers to compete for business and may further reduce cost. Yet in some cases, the reduction in cost may lead to reduction in quality. Because quality is not quantified easily, it may be difficult to measure and compare - especially if the quality for all parties begin to fall, business managers may fail to notice the change in quality. This is one kind of control that a business loses when externalizing cost. =B2C cost externalization= Another option is for a company to transfer some of its costs to its customers. For example, reducing staff in a customer service department that handles incoming phone calls will usually increase hold times for customers seeking support. The company reduces its costs by reducing staff, while the customer bears the increased cost of waiting on hold. Thus an expense has been transferred from the company to the customer. This can reduce customer satisfaction, to the point that some customers will be motivated to switch to another company. However, if the company can gain a legal monopoly (through, for example, intellectual property laws) the customer has no choice of a competitor available. Customers can also absorb some of a company's costs by performing tasks that the company formerly provided. An early example of this was the self-service gas station, followed more recently by self checkout kiosks in grocery stores. This can have less of a negative customer satisfaction impact because some customers actually prefer to help themselves. As in any business operation, costs externalization has its pros and cons. It is up to the business managers to make the decisions and take advantage of cost externalization.

It gives a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" account of the United States Supreme Court during Warren Burger's early years as Chief Justice of the United States. The book covers the years from the 1969 term through the 1975 term. Using Woodward's trademark writing technique involving \\"off-the-record\\" sources, the book provides an account of the deliberations leading to some of the court's more controversial decisions from the 1970s. Among the cases with substantial treatment in the book was the decision in United States v.

Publication: Constitutional Commentary, June 22, 2001 at Access my Library. The book's sources are highly critical of Burger as Chief Justice, especially in comparison to his predecessor, Earl Warren. Burger is described by other Justices as pompous, devious, and intellectually inferior. The book is also critical at various points of William O. Douglas, who is portrayed as having gone from one of America's greatest jurists to a \\"nasty, petulant, prodigal child\\" who was overly political, and is also occasionally critical of another liberal stalwart, Thurgood Marshall, for his intellectual laziness and apathy. The book does frequently lend out praise to other Justices though. Stewart, who was one of the primary sources for the book, is portrayed in a positive light, as is William J. Brennan, the acknowledged leader of the liberal bloc of justices, both for his intelligence as well as his amiable, friendly personality.

The cover features an illustration by John Bolton.Game manual Plot The player controls Metal Mutant, the ultimate battle machine, which was sent to the heavily protected high-tech planet Kronox to find and destroy the tyrant AROD 7. On the way to this goal, the player needs to solve puzzles and combat hostile lifeforms and enemy robots.  Gameplay  Right from the start the player has a possibility to instantly transform into 3 mechanical robots, each possessing unique abilities: ;Cyborg *From the start: Jump, Recharge, Trident *Later: Axe, Grappling Hook, Energy Blast ;Dino *From the start: Bite, Flame, Flame Tail *Later: Shield, Remote Mechanical Fly, Bionic Eye ;Tank *From the start: 360° Laser Gun *Later: Heavy Torpedo, Boss Energy Signature Detector The only feature that is common to all robots is the Turbomutant, in the last screens of the game. Upgrades are performed either by finding and picking them up as modules, or programming via terminals. Development According to an April 1991 issue of The One, Metal Mutant was originally subtitled Clash of the Tin Cans, and is inspired by the wargame board game BattleTech. At the fan festival Jaguar Connection 2003, Silmarils co-founder Louis-Marie Rocques stated that an Atari Lynx port was developed and completed but the release was cancelled by Atari Corporation.

In Spanish, with English subtitles Motion graphics are pieces of animation or digital footage which create the illusion of motion or rotation, and are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Motion graphics are usually displayed via electronic media technology, but may also be displayed via manual powered technology (e.g. thaumatrope, phenakistoscope, stroboscope, zoetrope, praxinoscope, flip book). The term distinguishes static graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form. While any form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and interactive applications. Scope of the term Motion graphics extend beyond the most commonly used methods of frame- by-frame footage and animation. Motion graphics can be distinguished from typical animation in that they are not strictly character driven or story based and often represent animated abstract shapes and forms such as logos or logo elements. History of the term Motion graphic clip about alebrijes created by the Museo de Arte Popular in Mexico City. Note: Click the CC button for English subtitles. Since there is no universally accepted definition of motion graphics, the official beginning of the art form is disputed. There have been presentations that could be classified as motion graphics as early as the 1800s. Michael Betancourt wrote the first in-depth historical survey of the field, arguing for its foundations in visual music and the historical abstract films of the 1920s by Walther Ruttmann, Hans Richter, Viking Eggeling and Oskar Fischinger. The history of motion graphics is closely related to the history of Computer Graphics as the new developments of computer-generated graphics led to wider use of motion design not based on optical film animation. The term motion graphics originated with digital video editing in computing, perhaps to keep pace with newer technology. Graphics for television were originally referred to as Broadcast Design. One of the first uses of the term \\"motion graphics\\" was by animator John Whitney, who in 1960 founded a company called Motion Graphics Inc. Saul Bass is a major pioneer in the development of feature film title sequences. His work included title sequences for popular films such as The Man with the Golden Arm (1955), Vertigo (1958), Anatomy of a Murder (1959), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960), and Advise & Consent (1962). His designs were simple, but effectively communicated the mood of the film. Computer-generated motion graphics Before computers were widely available, motion graphics were costly and time-consuming, limiting their use to high-budget filmmaking and television production. Computers began to be used as early as the late 1960s as super computers were capable of rendering crude graphics. John Whitney and Charles Csuri can be considered early pioneers of computer aided animation.http://excelsior.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~carlson/history/ID797.html In the late 1980s to mid-1990s, expensive proprietary graphics systems such as those from British-based Quantel were quite commonplace in many television stations. Quantel workstations such as the Hal, Henry, Harry, Mirage, and Paintbox were the broadcast graphics standard of the time. Many other real- time graphics systems were used such as Ampex ADO, Abekas and K-Scope for live Digital video effects. Early proprietary 3D computer systems were also developed specifically for broadcast design such as the Bosch FGS-4000 which was used in the music video for Dire Straits' Money for Nothing. The advent of more powerful desktop computers running Photoshop in the mid-90s drastically lowered the costs for producing digital graphics. With the reduced cost of producing motion graphics on a computer, the discipline has seen more widespread use. With the availability of desktop programs such as Adobe After Effects, Discreet Combustion, and Apple Motion, motion graphics have become increasingly accessible. Modern character generators (CG) from Aston Broadcast Systems and Chyron Corporation's incorporate motion graphics. The term \\"motion graphics\\" was popularized by Trish and Chris Meyer's book about the use of Adobe After Effects, titled Creating Motion Graphics. This was the beginning of desktop applications which specialized in video production but were not editing or 3D programs. These new programs collected together special effects, compositing, and color correction toolsets, and primarily came between edit and 3D in the production process. This \\"in-between\\" notion of motion graphics and the resulting style of animation is why sometimes it is referred to as 2.5D. Motion graphics continue to evolve as an art form with the incorporation of sweeping camera paths and 3D elements. Maxon's CINEMA 4D, plugins such as MoGraph and Adobe After Effects. Despite their relative complexity, Autodesk's Maya and 3D Studio Max are widely used for the animation and design of motion graphics, as is Maya and 3D Studio which uses a node-based particle system generator similar to Cinema 4D's Thinking Particles plugin. There are also some other packages in Open Source panorama, which are gaining more features and adepts in order to use in a motion graphics workflow, while Blender integrates several of the functions of its commercial counterparts. Many motion graphics animators learn several 3D graphics packages for use according to each program's strengths. Although many trends in motion graphics tend to be based on a specific software's capabilities, the software is only a tool the broadcast designer uses while bringing the vision to life. Leaning heavily from techniques such as the collage or the pastiche, motion graphics has begun to integrate many traditional animation techniques as well, including stop- motion animation, frame by frame animation, or a combination of both. Particle system One of the most popular motion graphics tools is a particle system: a motion graphics technology that is used for generating multiple animated elements. This type of animation is commonly referred to as procedural animation. A particle system is available as a plug-in, as a stand- alone application, or is included as an integrated part of a motion graphics package. Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project. Among other things, a particle emitter can be in the form of a single point, a line, a grid, a plane or an object such as a box or sphere, although it can also make use a custom object to serve an emitter, such as a logo, which for example, can be exploded, melted, or transformed into blowing sand. A popular particle system for motion graphics is Particular by Trapcode. Other examples of individual particles include a blurred sphere that can be used in large numbers to create smoke or fog and a video clip of a person who can be duplicated to create a crowd scene. Particles can be emitted as a single item, although it is typically used in large numbers, such as when creating smoke or rain. They are controlled by directional forces, simulated wind, and gravity, objects designed to attract or repel them. Other controllable attributes can include such things as changes in color, size, or transparency. Depending on the system, one can also combine multiple simultaneous emitters, such as when simulating an explosion that combines fire, smoke, and flying debris. In an advanced 3-D system the particle can be used to control an animated articulated character, a recognizable example being the warriors in the battle sequences of the film Lord of the Rings. Animation Elements of a motion graphics project can be animated by various means, depending on the capabilities of the software. These elements may be in the form of art, text, photos, and video clips, to name a few. The most popular form of animation is keyframing, in which properties of an object can be specified at certain points in time by setting a series of keyframes so that the properties of the object can be automatically altered (or tweened) in the frames between keyframes. Another method involves a behavior system such as is found in Apple Motion that controls these changes by simulating natural forces without requiring the more rigid but precise keyframing method. Yet another method involves the use of formulas or scripts, such as the expressions function in Adobe After Effects or the creation of ActionScripts within Adobe Flash. Computers are capable of calculating and randomizing changes in imagery to create the illusion of motion and transformation. Computer animations can use less information space (computer memory) by automatically tweening, a process of rendering the key changes of an image at a specified or calculated time. These key poses or frames are commonly referred to as keyframes or low CP. Adobe Flash uses computer animation tweening as well as frame-by-frame animation and video.

Cinema 4D is widely used for its intuitive interface, layered export to Adobe After Effects, and the additional MoGraph module, but there are other software packages as well.

Its name from the Indo-European root *bhogj, meaning \\"to flow\\". The same root is seen in hydronym \\"Bosna\\".http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/76828 Course =Headwaters= The Bosut originates as the Biđ (or Bič) river in central Slavonia region, on the southern slopes of the Dilj mountain, northwest of the city of Slavonski Brod. Generally flowing to the northeast, it has no major settlements though some larger villages are in the vicinity of the river (Donji Andrijevci, Vrpolje and Strizivojna). Biđ is long. The Berava is a small river that rises south of Velika Kopanica, meanders eastwards near Gundinci and Babina Greda, and turns north near Gradište, south of Cerna. =Downstream of Cerna= In the village of Cerna, the Biđ receives the river Berava from the south and from this point it is known as the Bosut. Some maps though, indicate that name Bosut is used before the river reaches Cerna, and some other apply the name also for the lowest part of the Berava's course, between Gradište and Cerna. Turning north from there, the river flows into the region of Syrmia, and the villages of Andrijaševci and Rokovci, reaching the biggest settlement on its course, the city of Vinkovci. From there, the rivers turns to the southeast, which is the direction it will follow for the rest of its course, except for a large U-bend south of Vinkovci. It passes through Kunjevci, Nijemci, Podgrađe, Apševci and Lipovac, where it receives the river Spačva from the right, and after the flow of 151 km through Croatia, crosses the Serbian border. The Bosut enters Serbia at the village of Batrovci and flows through the southwesternmost part of the province of Vojvodina. It continues through the villages of Morović (where it receives the river Studva from the right, its major tributary in Serbia) and Višnjićevo, makes a turn north of Sremska Rača and, after 28 km in Serbia, empties into the Sava at the village of Bosut. A Slezen pond, near Morović, is located in the river's valley.  Characteristics  The Bosut in Vinkovci The Bosut belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, with its own drainage area of (of which in Croatia). For some 40 km it is navigable for smaller vessels. The river is known as meandering and extremely slow, and it has a very small inclination in its basin - less than 10 m from Vinkovci until its mouth. Bosut is known for a phenomenon of being 'the river that flows backwards', because sometimes, with strong winds and being so slow, it appears as if the water is flowing backwards. The whole valley of the Biđ-Bosut is actually an old, fossil river bed of the Sava. It is also known as a region with the highest evaporation in both Croatia and Serbia. In its lower course, Bosut flows through a forested area in the region of Spačva. The river is generally known for its abundance of fish.

Under the exhaustive ballot the elector casts a single vote for their chosen candidate. However, if no candidate is supported by an overall majority of votes then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and a further round of voting occurs. This process is repeated for as many rounds as necessary until one candidate has a majority. The exhaustive ballot is similar to the two-round system but with key differences. Under the two round system if no candidate wins a majority on the first round, only the top two recipients of votes advance to the second (and final) round of voting, and a majority winner is determined in the second round. By contrast, on the exhaustive ballot only one candidate is eliminated per round; thus, several rounds of voting may be required until a candidate reaches a majority. (In some circumstances, the two or more lowest candidates can be eliminated simultaneously if together they have fewer votes than the lowest candidate above them. In other words, this \\"bulk exclusion\\" cannot change the order of elimination, unlike a two-round system.) Because voters may have to cast votes several times, the exhaustive ballot is not used in large-scale public elections. Instead it is usually used in elections involving, at most, a few hundred voters, such as the election of a prime minister or the presiding officer of an assembly. The exhaustive ballot is currently used, in different forms, to elect the members of the Swiss Federal Council, the First Minister of Scotland, the President of the European Parliament, and the speakers of the House of Commons of Canada, the British House of Commons and the Scottish Parliament, the host city of the Olympic Games and the host of the FIFA World Cup, and, formerly, to elect the President and the State Comptroller of Israel, which are now elected—though still indirectly by the Knesset—using a two-round system. Voting and counting An example of a ballot paper In each round of an exhaustive ballot the voter simply marks an 'x' beside his or her favourite candidate. If no candidate has an absolute majority of votes (i.e., more than half) in the first round, then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated while all other candidates advance to a second round. If there is still no candidate with a majority then the candidate with the fewest votes is again eliminated and there is a third round. The process repeats itself for as many rounds as are necessary for one candidate to achieve a majority. If necessary, the election will continue until only two candidates remain. When this occurs one of the two must achieve an absolute majority. Between rounds, the voter is entirely free to change his/her preferred candidate for whatever reason, even if his/her preferred candidate has not yet been eliminated from voting. = Variations = * It is possible to impose a larger number of votes to win, such as a two thirds vote, on either all rounds or on the beginning rounds. For example, on the first several rounds of the election of the President of Italy, a supermajority is required to win, dropping to a majority on the fourth and subsequent ballots. * Under some variants of the exhaustive ballot there is no formal rule for eliminating candidates from one round to another; rather, candidates are expected to withdraw voluntarily. * Some variations slowly raise an elimination threshold in to encourage compromise. For example, the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party for U.S. Senate endorsement 2008 used an exhaustive ballot with a dropoff rule starting at 5% and increasing to 25% after round 5, after which one candidate with the lowest votes was eliminated per round until no more than two remained.DFL Call 2008/2009 Page 27: VIII. Endorsement for U.S. Senate: 22. GENERAL ENDORSEMENT RULES: :* Dropoff rule: Candidates receiving less than 5% will be dropped after the first ballot. On subsequent ballots, the dropoff threshold will be raised by 5% each ballot to a maximum of 25%. After the fifth ballot and each subsequent ballot, the lowest remaining candidates will be dropped so that no more than two candidates remain. In the event that application of the dropoff rule would eliminate all but one candidate, then the two candidates who received the highest percent of the vote on the prior ballot shall be the remaining candidates. * There are also variants which exclude more than one candidate at a time. For example, in elections for the speakers of the Canadian and British Houses of Commons any candidate with fewer than 5% of all votes in the first round is immediately eliminated. Example Tennessee's four cities are spread throughout the state Imagine that the population of Tennessee, a state in the United States, is voting on the location of its capital. The population of Tennessee is concentrated around its four major cities, which are spread throughout the state. For this example, suppose that the entire electorate live in one of these four cities, and furthermore that their sole concern is for the capital to be established as close to their city as possible. The candidates for the capital are: * Memphis, the state's largest city, with 42% of the voters, but located far from the other cities * Nashville, with 26% of the votersNote: Nashville is in reality both the capital and most populous city of Tennessee, but please ignore this for the sake of example * Knoxville, with 17% of the voters * Chattanooga, with 15% of the voters Round 1: In the first round of voting everybody votes for their own city and the results will be as follows: *Memphis: 42% *Nashville: 26% *Knoxville: 17% *Chattanooga: 15% Round 2: No candidate has an absolute majority in the first round (this would be greater than 50%), so Chattanooga, which has the fewest votes, is eliminated and the remaining three candidates proceed to Round 2. In this round the Chattanooga supporters vote instead for Knoxville, the next nearest city to their own. None of the other voters need change their votes. The results are therefore: *Memphis: 42% *Nashville: 26% *Knoxville: 32% Round 3: Nashville is now eliminated, so that only two candidates remain for the final round. The Nashville supporters (including the former Chattanooga supporters) change their vote to Knoxville, the next nearest city to their own. The result of the third round is therefore: *Memphis: 42% *Knoxville: 58% Result: After round three Knoxville has an absolute majority so is the winner. Use in practice *Scottish government: The First Minister, and the Presiding Officer and Deputy Presiding Officers of the Scottish Parliament are elected by the exhaustive ballot method. *The host city of the Olympic Games is chosen by an exhaustive ballot of members of the International Olympic Committee. Members from a country which has a city competing in the election are forbidden from voting unless the city has been eliminated. * The President of the European Parliament is elected by all members of the body to be its 'speaker' or chairperson. In the election if no candidate receives an absolute majority in the first round then there are up to three more rounds. In the second and third rounds anyone who wants to is free to stand, but candidates who perform poorly sometimes withdraw to help others be elected. If no-one achieves an absolute majority in the third round then only the two candidates with most votes are allowed to proceed to the fourth and final round of voting. * The Speaker of the House of Commons is elected by secret ballot by members of the house. If no candidate achieves an absolute majority in the first round then the candidate with fewest votes and any other candidate who has received less than 5% of all votes is immediately eliminated. Subsequent rounds proceed according to the ordinary rules of the exhaustive ballot. * The Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada is elected under essentially the same variant of the exhaustive ballot used for the British counterpart, with candidates on less than 5% in the first round immediately excluded. * The Leader of the New Democratic Party of Canada is elected by the party membership under a mixture of instant runoff voting (IRV), and exhaustive voting, depending on the member's preferences. Those who want to vote only once may cast a single ballot filled out in the IRV format, while other members may cast separate ballots after each round of balloting. The party used this format for the 2012, and 2017 leadership elections. *Candidates to lead the UK Conservative Party are shortlisted by an exhaustive ballot of elected MPs until only two candidates remain. The final two candidates then enter a ballot of the party membership to select the leader. Similar systems =The two-round system= As noted above the exhaustive ballot is similar to the two-round system. However under the two-round system if no candidate achieves an absolute majority in the first round then, rather than just a single candidate being eliminated, all candidates are immediately excluded except the two with the most votes. There is then a second and final round. Because, at most, it requires voters to return to the polls only once, the two-round system is considered more practical for large public elections than the exhaustive ballot, and is used in many countries for the election of presidents and legislative bodies. However the two systems often produce different winners. This is because, under the two-round system, a candidate may be eliminated in the first round who would have gone on to win the contest if they had been permitted to survive to the second round. In Example I above the winner would not have changed if the two rounds system had been used instead of the exhaustive ballot. However, in Example II the two round system would have selected Nashville instead of Knoxville. = Primary two-round system = A nonpartisan primary election system is a variation of the two- round system which holds a pre-election, and allows the top two candidates to pass to the general election. It generally differs from the two-round system in two ways: (1) the first election isn't allowed to pick a winner, and (2) political parties are not allowed to limit their field using a convention or caucus. =Instant-runoff voting= In some respects the exhaustive ballot closely resembles instant-runoff voting (also known as the 'Alternative Vote'). Under both systems if no candidate has an absolute majority in the first round then there are further rounds, with the candidate with the fewest votes being eliminated after each round. However while under the exhaustive ballot each round involves voters returning to cast a new vote, under instant- runoff, voters vote only once. This is possible because, rather than voting for only a single candidate, the voter ranks all of the candidates in order of preference. These preferences are then used to 'transfer' the votes of those whose first preference has been eliminated during the course of the count. Because the exhaustive ballot involves separate rounds of voting, voters can use the results of one round to inform how they will vote in the next, whereas this is not possible under IRV. Furthermore, because it is necessary to vote only once, instant-runoff voting has been used for large-scale elections in many places. Tactical voting Like instant-runoff voting, the exhaustive ballot is intended to improve upon the simpler 'first-past-the-post' (plurality) system by reducing the potential for tactical voting by avoiding 'wasted' votes. Under the plurality system, which involves only one round, voters are encouraged to vote tactically by voting for only one of the two leading candidates, because a vote for any other candidate will not affect the result. Under the exhaustive ballot this tactic, known as 'compromising', is sometimes unnecessary because, even if the voter's first choice is unlikely to be elected, she will still have the opportunity to influence the outcome of the election by voting for more popular candidates once her favourite has been eliminated. However the exhaustive ballot is still vulnerable to tactical voting under some circumstances. Because of the similarity between the two systems it is open to the same forms of tactical voting as instant-runoff voting, as described below. Although the exhaustive ballot is designed to avoid 'compromising' the tactic is still effective in some elections. Compromising is where a voter votes for a certain candidate, not because they necessarily support them, but as a way of avoiding the election of a candidate whom they dislike even more. The compromising tactic is sometimes effective because the exhaustive ballot eliminates candidates who are unpopular in early rounds, who might have had sufficient support to win the election had they survived a little longer. This can create strong incentives for voters to vote tactically. The exhaustive ballot is also vulnerable to the tactic of 'push over', where voters vote tactically for an unpopular 'push over' candidate in one round as a way of helping their true favourite candidate win in a later round. The purpose of voting for the 'push over' is to ensure that it is this weak candidate, rather than a stronger rival, who remains to challenge a voter's preferred candidate in later rounds. By supporting a 'push over' candidate it is hoped to eliminate a stronger candidate who might have gone on to win the election. The 'push over' tactic requires voters to be able to reliably predict how others will vote. It runs the risk of backfiring, because if the tactical voter miscalculates then the candidate intended as a 'push over' might end up actually beating the voter's preferred candidate. Instant- runoff voting is less susceptible to this tactic, as voters cannot change their first preference in successive rounds. Once a voter has chosen a push over as their preferred candidate, it will remain so until this candidate is eliminated, increasing the likelihood of the push over getting elected at the expense of the preferred candidate. =Examples= Compromise In the example above Knoxville wins, the last choice of both Nashville and Memphis supporters. If Memphis supporters had compromised by voting for Nashville (their second choice) in the first round then Nashville would have been elected immediately, while if Nashville supporters had all compromised by voting for their second choice of Chattanooga in the first round, then Chattanooga would have gone on to be elected in the second round. Push over Imagine an election in which there are 100 voters who vote as follows: *Ice Cream: 25 votes *Apple Pie: 30 votes *Fruit: 45 votes No candidate has an absolute majority of votes so Ice Cream is eliminated in the first round. Ice Cream supporters prefer Apple Pie to Fruit so in the second round they vote for Apple Pie and Apple Pie is the winner. However, if only six Fruit supporters had used the tactic of 'push over' then they could have changed this outcome and ensured the election of Fruit. These six voters can do this by voting for Ice Cream in the first round as a 'push over'. If they do this then the votes cast in the first round will look like this: *Ice Cream: 31 *Apple Pie: 30 *Fruit: 39 This time Apple Pie is eliminated in the first round and Ice Cream and Fruit survive to the second round. This outcome is deliberate. The tactical voters know that Ice Cream will be an easier candidate for Fruit to beat in the second round than Apple Pie--in other words, that Ice Cream will be a 'push-over'. In the second round the tactical voters vote for their real first preference, Fruit. Therefore, even if only six Apple Pie supporters prefer Fruit to Ice Cream, the result of the second round will be: *Ice Cream: 49 *Fruit: 51 Fruit will therefore be elected. The success of this tactic relies on the Fruit supporters being able to predict that Ice Cream can be beaten by Fruit in the second round. If a large majority of Apple Pie supporters had voted for Ice Cream then the 'push over' tactic would have backfired, leading to the election of Ice Cream, which Fruit partisans like even less than Apple Pie. Strategic nomination The exhaustive ballot can also be influenced by strategic nomination; this is where candidates and political factions influence the result of an election by either nominating extra candidates or withdrawing a candidate who would otherwise have stood. The exhaustive ballot is vulnerable to strategic nomination for the same reasons that it is open to the voting tactic of 'compromising'. This is because a candidate who knows they are unlikely to win can bring about the election of a more desirable compromise candidate by withdrawing from the race, or by never standing in the first place. By the same token a candidate can bring about a less desirable result by unwisely choosing to stand in an election; this is because of the spoiler effect, by which a new candidate can 'split the vote' and cost another similar candidate the election. The exhaustive vote's system of multiple rounds makes it less vulnerable to the spoiler effect than the plurality system or the two round system. This is because a potential spoiler candidate often has only minor support; therefore he will be eliminated early and his supporters will have the opportunity to influence the result of the election by voting for more popular candidates in later rounds. Voters can also counteract the effect of vote splitting by using the 'compromise' tactic. The exhaustive vote is essentially vulnerable to the same forms of strategic nomination as instant- runoff voting, the difference being that under the exhaustive vote candidates can use the results of early rounds to inform whether or not they should strategically withdraw in later rounds. This is impossible under IRV. In IRV the electorate votes only once, so candidates must make the judgement of whether or not to participate in an election before the poll, and before even one round of counting has occurred. Effect on candidates and factions The exhaustive ballot encourages candidates to appeal to a broad cross-section of voters. This is because, in order to eventually receive an absolute majority of votes, it is necessary for a candidate to win the support of voters whose favourite candidate has been eliminated. Under the exhaustive ballot, eliminated candidates, and the factions who previously supported them, often issue recommendations to their supporters as to whom they should vote for in the remaining rounds of the contest. This means that eliminated candidates are still able to influence the result of the election.

In 1963 the college was rechartered as a baccalaureate institution. The school later renamed itself Gwynedd Mercy University. GMercyU offers more than 40 undergraduate and graduate degrees in nursing, education, business, and the arts & sciences.  History  Dating to the early 1900s, the grounds were originally owned by Frances Bond, an investment banker, and were known as Willowbrook Farm. The farm hosted a large Gregorian mansion, formal gardens and outbuildings that were designed by renowned Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, the acclaimed architect of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.Bogaert, Pauline Pinard \\"Walled Garden Thrives After Rejuvenation But Could Use A Cleanup\\". retrieved August 21, 2012 The mansion, which the Bonds lived in and is now over one hundred years old, is still in use by the University today as Assumption Hall. For a time Frances' son and respected ornithologist James Bond lived on the land. When devout birdwatcher and author Ian Fleming needed a name for his now-infamous protagonist he turned to a notable bird-watching guide written by Bond. “I was looking for a name for my hero – nothing like Peregrine Carruthers or 'Standfast' Maltravers - and I found it on the cover of Birds of the West Indies by James Bond,\\" wrote Fleming in the book Ian Fleming Introduces Jamaica. Frances Bond's wife Margaret died in 1910, a few years after the Gregorian Mansion was finished in 1906–1907. Two years after her death, Bond sold Willowbrook Farm to Roland and Anita Taylor. The couple renamed the farm Treweryn, after the creek that flows through the property. Mr. Taylor was an enthusiastic landscaper who planted many ornamental trees and shrubs, including 53 varieties of Rhododendron. After the death of the Taylors, their daughters sold the mansion, outbuildings and additional land to the Sisters of Mercy in 1948.

In the center of the flag is a black cross, which symbolizes the four lakes (Mendota, Monona, Wingra, and Waubesa), as well as the cross shape of the Wisconsin State Capitol. History Original Flag of Madison, Wisconsin. The original flag was designed by Rick and Dennis Stone, who were members of the Madison Scouts Drum and Bugle Corps, with the help of their color guard instructor. In the original design, adopted by the municipal government on April 12, 1962, the shape overlaid on the cross was a Zia sun symbol, sacred to the Native American Zia people of New Mexico. While Madison's flag designers intended to represent an \\"Indian sun symbol\\", it is not used by any of the Native American groups in the Wisconsin area, and the flag designers were not aware that it was specifically Puebloan or New Mexican. In a 2004 poll conducted by the North American Vexillological Association, the flag of Madison was rated 11th best of 150 major cities in the United States.\\"Washington, D.C. Tops American City Flags Survey\\" , North American Vexillological Association press release, 2 October 2004. Madison's flag experienced a resurgence beginning in 2015, when Madison Alderperson Maurice Cheeks authored and passed a resolution to require the flag to be flown on city property as part of a campaign to increase awareness of the symbol of local pride. That increased exposure led to concerns about the \\"cultural appropriation\\" of a symbol sacred to the Zia, as well as other Pueblo, mestizo Hispano, and many other native affiliated New Mexican people, so in 2017 Cheeks joined with fellow Alderperson Arvina Martin in spearheading an effort to modify the design of the flag. Original designer Rick Stone was publicly supportive of the efforts, \\"as long as it doesn’t significantly change the flag’s design or (make) it look completely different.\\" The Common Council settled on a design that replaced the sacred Zia sun symbol with a gold disc. Their bill was supported by Mayor Paul Soglin and was unanimously passed by the council on July 24, 2018. After the vote passed, Martin presented the Stone brothers with the first copy of the new flag. In Popular Culture The city's professional soccer team, Forward Madison FC, incorporates the city flag into its main logo, and its home jersey is sky blue with a white diagonal sash to mimic Madison's flag.

Thopia usually maintained good relations with the Roman Curia. Family The first mention of the Thopia is from 1329, when Tanusio Thopia was mentioned as one of the counts of Albania. In 1338, Tanusio was mentioned as Count of Matia (conte di Matia). According to Karl Hopf, Tanusio's son or brother Andrea, as told by Gjon Muzaka (fl. 1510), had fallen in love with the daughter of King Robert of Naples when her ship, en route to the Principality of the Morea to be wed with the bailli, had stopped at Durazzo where they met. Andrea abducted and married her, and they had two sons, Karl and George. King Robert, enraged, under the pretext of reconciliation had the couple invited to Naples where he had them executed. Control of Durrës and the Princedom of Albania The long protracted turmoil of dynastic wars had made germinate in their real victims, the Albanians, the seeds of national sentiment which contained great promise, so that, when after Emperor Stefan Dušan's death, a descendant of Stefan Uroš I, returned to the province, the inhabitants rose en masse and, under the leadership of Karl Thopia, cut down the pretender and his entire force in the battle of Acheloos. In 1358, Karl rose against the rule of the Anjou and managed to drive them out of Durrës from Epirus and Albania. He ruled most of modern central Albania from 1358 to 1388 and claimed the title of princeps Albaniae. Since 1362, Karl sought himself to set Durrës, which was in the possession of the Duchess Joanna of Anjou. The first, certainly still unsuccessful siege lasted from April 1362 until May 1363. Then, Thopia had to withdraw his troops, who were weakened by an epidemic disease. Only in 1367 could Karl conquer Durrës, who had attained in the meantime the tacit agreement of the Venetians for his project and turn this important port into his residence. Karl gained control of Durrës in 1368, which was where the Angevins held out due to their Kingdom becoming smaller in size. Karl lost Durrës in 1376, conquered by Louis of Navarre, but recovered it in 1383 when the last mercenaries of the Navarrese Company moved to Greece. Thopia ruled over the regions of Durrës, Kruja, Peqin, Elbasan, Mokra and Gora, that is, along both sides of the Via Egnatia as far east as Lake Ohrid. Rivalry with the Balsha Balša II made a fourth attempt to conquer Durrës, an important commercial and strategic center, which was ruled by his rival, Karl Thopia. In 1385, Balša II started an offensive, capturing Durrës from Karl Thopia the following year, and proclaimed himself Duke of Durazzo (Durrës). Thopia called on the Turks for assistance. Murad I gladly sent an army of 40,000 men from Macedonia. In the plain of Savra between Elbasan and Lushnja, Balša II fought the Turks and was defeated and killed. Thopia again gained control over Durazzo, probably under Ottoman suzerainty. Venetian alliance In the last decade of his rule, Karl closely followed the Republic of Venice, particularly with regard to foreign policy. On 17 August 1386, Karl Thopia allied himself with Venice and committed himself to participate in all wars of the Republic or pay auxiliary funds and supply grain. In addition, he promised the Venetian buyers protection in his lands. In return, Venice supplied a galley, permitted recruitment of Thopia's mercenaries in Venetian areas and instructed the captain of their Adriatic fleet to protect Karl's coasts from the Ottomans. The Ottomans undertook several heavy attacks on Durrës, which also still persisted as Karl died in January 1388. His son, Gjergj, became Karl's successor. St. Gjon Vladimir's Church In 1381, Karl built the St. Gjon Vladimir's Church in the proximity of Elbasan, where Jovan Vladimir's remains were held until 1995. He is depicted in the icon of St. Vladimir, painted by Onufri, wearing a crown and standing by the Church of the Saint.

He became known in North America and Europe in the 1960s for his work on ecumenism, interfaith dialogue, and the relationship between the Catholic Church and Jews. In the later 1960s, he went to the New School for Social Theory in New York and became a sociologist, which led to his work on creating a dialogue between classical sociology (Marx, Tocqueville, Durkheim, Toennies, Weber, etc.) and Christian theology. In the 1970s, he welcomed the insights of the Theology of Liberation that came from Latin America and other societies. He also became interested in the work of Karl Mannheim and developed a program of ideology critique that he hoped would eliminate the ideological elements in religion, especially those elements that preached contempt for others and allowed Christians to remain unmoved by the suffering of the victims of social injustice and structural violence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Baum continued his study into ideology critique by integrating the work of the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. He connected the Frankfurt School's concept of \\"the end of innocent critique\\" with the Catholic Church's \\"preferential option for the poor\\". Both concepts extended his interest in ideology critique. Since Baum has always been interested in social ethics, he also studied the work of Karl Polanyi, with whom he sympathized greatly. It was also in the late 1980s that Baum moved to Quebec and developed an interest in Quebec Catholicism, which he saw as more progressive and contextual than its English Canadian and American counterparts. Early life Born on June 20, 1923, to a Jewish mother and a Protestant father, in Berlin, he came to Canada from England as a war refugee. He arrived by boat in Quebec in 1940 with other Germans, most of them Jewish, and they were interned in refugee camps, under military control. After some transfers between Quebec, Trois-Rivières, New-Brunswick and Farnham, he was finally interned to Sherbrooke, Quebec. Only 17 years old at this time of his internment, he considered this period of his life as an incredible adventure. Among the refugees, some intellectuals hastened to set up inside the camps educational systems of which he took advantage. Although Canada had no law for the refugees at this time, Emma Kaufman, member of the wealthy Kitchener, Ontario family, who met them in these camps, pressured the government so that some could complete their studies outside of camps with financial aid (scholarships) that she had collected. Career Baum was the professor of theology and sociology at University of Saint Michael's College in the University of Toronto and, after 1986, professor of theological ethics at McGill University's Faculty of Religious Studies. In Montreal, he was associated with the Jesuit Centre justice et foi until his death in 2017. During the church council Vatican II he was a peritus, or theological advisor, at the Ecumenical Secretariat, the commission responsible for three conciliar documents, On Religious Liberty, On Ecumenism, and On the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions. In particular, he advocated the position, as a response to the Holocaust, of the rabbi and philosopher Emil Fackenheim regarding the cessation of efforts to convert the Jews, famously stating: He composed the first draft of the conciliar document Nostra aetate, the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions, that was later expanded to address all the world religions. He was also among the small group of theologians who worked on the fourth and final draft. It was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on October 28, 1965.Barnes S.J., Michael. \\"Nostra aetate -the moral heart of the Second Vatican Council\\", Jesuits in Britain, 2015 From 1962 to 2004, he was the editor of The Ecumenist, a review of theology, culture and society, which is now published by Novalis. He continued contributing to The Ecumenist, serving as editor of one issue per year until his death. He was also a member and frequent editor of the international Catholic review Concilium. In 2012 he signed the Catholic Scholars' Declaration on Authority in the Church. After retirement, Baum developed an interest in Islam, especially the work of Tariq Ramadan, and in Fernand Dumont, the French Canadian sociologist, philosopher, theologian, and poet, both of whom he admired greatly. Personal life Throughout his life Baum maintained warm and cordial friendships with people from diverse horizons. Canadian author Michael Higgins, who first met Baum in 1968 writes \\"Politeness, ingenuousness, and collegiality are the personal as well as professional qualities that have defined his life and vocation no matter the setting—university, chancery, parish hall, retreat house, or activist cell.\\"Higgins, The Theologian as Journalist: A Tribute to Gregory Baum, Commonweal 138.21 (2011): 12-18. In 1946, while studying mathematics at McMaster University, a friend gave him a copy of Augustine's Confessions. Shortly after he became a Roman Catholic. In 1947 he entered the Augustinian Order and was ordained to the priesthood. In 1978, after leaving the Augustinians, he married his close friend Shirley Flynn and lived with her until her death in 2007. A strong supporter of gays and lesbians in the Church, Baum had been aware since adolescence of his own attraction to men. After moving to Montreal in 1986, he fell in love with a former priest of whom he says, \\"his unwavering love, which has given stability to my life as a theologian, has been a gift from God.\\" Baum died in hospital in Montreal on October 18, 2017, surrounded by his friends.

Olivo maintained the bat, which had an A's logo on it, had been given to him by a former teammate while playing in the Athletics system. He made his major league debut on September 15, 2002 with the White Sox and hit a home run in his first Major League at-bat, off Andy Pettitte of the New York Yankees. He played 6 games that year, with 4 hits in 19 at-bats. He was the backup catcher for the White Sox for all of 2003 and the first half of 2004.

Olivo watched the team play the first inning of the game from the clubhouse, then changed into street clothes and left the ballpark. In response, the Marlins declined the request and instead placed him on the 'restricted list', during which time he is not paid (his one-year contract is worth $800,000) and cannot seek employment with another team.

It has about 1,200 inhabitants. It lies approximately 10 km south of Kadaň. Etymology Its name is derived from a personal name Radoň – the village of Radoň's people. History The oldest written record about Radonice comes from 1196, when monks came from Waldsassen Abbey to a rule of Milhost from Mašťov.

Fates of Radonice was put together with Vintířov with a knight fortress, which was changed to a castle for a noble family. After 1508 Radonice experienced the largest bloom. Opl of Fictum bought the Radonice's manor and Vintířov from Albrecht of Kolovraty. It was his merit that Radonice was advanced into a town. The king Władysław II Jagiełło confirmed it. He conferred it a privilege of brewing beer, selling salt, markets arranging and the one-mile-law privilege. In 1532 Albert Schlick bought the market-town Radonice and Vintířov. The mastership of Schlicks lasted for three quarters of a century and it was a time of development. The city was enclosed by a wall and it had four gates. It had a brewery, a malt-house, two mills, a bath, a new pub and a city hospital. In 1622 Ferdinand of Nagarol became a lord of the town. His wife forbade to receive Jews in the market town in 1628. In 1662 the king Leopold I ratified the privilege of the one-mile-law for a salt and a corn. In 1664 dynasty of Losynthal bought the town. The first mention about school appeared in 1664. A new church was built on a place of the old one in 1702. In 1842 stables and a riding school were destroyed by fire. In 1871 a sugar refinery grew up at the outskirts. In 1889 a new school was built in Doupovská street. From 1841 a regular connecting by a post coach started. First post office was opened in 1872. In 1884 a railway was built up. An electrification of the community was performed in 1910. From the first half of 19th century coal mining developed. The most well known coal mine is Františka and the exploitation ended on the eve of World War II. Soon after the beginning of World War II prisoners went to Radonice. 35 men from France were accommodated in the town. They worked mainly in the shafts and in local farms. The German population was expelled after World War II. In 1952 the farmers' cooperation started, which stood on dried swamp. After the Velvet Revolution of 1989 the town has been slowly awaking to the new life.

The 1926 elections saw a significant loss of support for the DF, as its vote share fell from 15% in 1923 to 8%, with the party winning just five seats. As a result, the Christian Democratic Bloc lost its majority and control of the government. Following the 1926 coup, the DF joined the opposition to the Antanas Smetona government.

London Thamesport (formerly just \\"Thamesport\\") is a small container seaport on the River Medway, serving the North Sea. It is located on the Isle of Grain, in the Medway unitary authority district of the English county of Kent. The area was formerly called Port Victoria. Now that the much bigger London Gateway port on the north bank of the Thames is operational, it seems that Thamesport's days as London's container port are numbered. The aerial photograph of the site on Google Earth in February 2020 shows that the marshalling areas have been dismantled, although five cranes on the dockside appear to be intact. History =Kent Oil Refinery= In 1953, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (later British Petroleum) developed a large oil refinery, Kent Oil Refinery, in the south of the Isle of Grain. A fuel depot with an attached port had existed there since 1928. From 1953, over ten million tons of crude oil were processed annually on the site. This led to the establishment of the oil-fired power station at Grain and dual-fuel capable Kingsnorth. In practice, Kingsnorth used coal. The refinery was closed on 27 August 1982, and work was transferred to other BP locations. The plant was taken over by British Gas plc (at that time still state owned), which used a small part of the site for the storage of liquefied natural gas. Three-quarters of the site remained unused. =Channel Tunnel Segment Manufacturing= During the construction of the Channel Tunnel, segments to line the tunnel from the British side were made on the site that is now Thamesport, before being delivered by railway to the site at Shakespeare Cliff, near Dover. As there was hardly any room at the site itself, the site on the Isle of Grain was chosen because of the links to the ships from Scotland delivering aggregate. Trains full of segments left the factory each day, travelling on the Hundred of Hoo Railway on the island before taking a circuitous route avoiding steep gradients before arriving at Shakespeare Cliff. =Container port= In 1987 British Gas submitted plans to use of the disused refinery site as a Container port. Building began in 1989. The risk capital financing of the £150 million project, named Thamesport, took place through the operating company Thames Estuary Terminals Ltd., later Thamesport Ltd. By March 1990 the enterprise had a capacity of approximately 360,000 TEU per year. =Land access= Land access to Thamesport was at first only by road. In time the railway line from Gravesend to the Isle of Grain was to be used. A goods station with track and transshipment facilities was developed at Thamesport. A government subsidy of £1.8 million was received. It started operating in January 1992. =Ownership changes= By the first half of 1990, the repayment of c. £100 million risk capital put the operator company Thamesport Ltd. into administration. The investment group Rutland Partners LLP acquired 95% of MTS holdings Ltd – the parent company of Thamesport Ltd – in December 1995 for £25 million and took over debts of £27 million. With the new owner, the port was further developed. The capacity increased to approximately 635,000 TEU per year. In 1997, with a turnover of £27.3 million, a profit (before tax) of approximately £2.5 million was made. In February 1998 Rutland Partners LLP sold their interest in MTS holdings Ltd and small navigation company \\"Maritime Haulage\\" for £112 million to the Hutchison Whampoa Group. Hutchison Whampoa also operates two other important ports on the British east coast, Felixstowe and Harwich. =Deep-water port= In 2001 Thamesport was developed into a deep-water port. The harbour basin was dredged to a depth of at least , and the approach to a minimum depth of , at a cost of £3.5 million. In June 2008, its name was changed to London Thamesport.www.thamesport.co.uk Facilities The heart of Thamesport is a deep water dock. The quay has eight (STS) gantry cranes, and can service vessels with draughts of . The temporary storage facility has capacity for 26,000 TEU; i.e. 13,000 standard containers. The container handling is semi- automatic, as the container tugs are manually operated. 635,000 TEU can be processed annually. In the long-term the capacity could be doubled. Although site constraints limit the maximum possible length of the quay to only , there is considerable scope for future development at Thamesport. The majority of this brownfield site (a former oil refinery) remains undeveloped, and Thamesport Interchange has outline planning permission to build of logistics related facilities. Immediately to the north of Thamesport is a terminal for the import of aviation fuel (kerosene). Thamesport will be well-placed if proposals for a new London Airport, either on the Isle of Grain itself, or on the Mayor of London's \\"Boris Island\\", come to fruition. (This is unlikely to be a consideration in anything other than the long-term future. In December 2013, the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies, excluded these proposals from its short-list of possible recommendations. The Commission later studied a number of aspects of the 'Inner Thames Estuary Proposal' and announced in July 2014 that it would not be adding any such proposal to its short-list.) Although the company appears confident of further development and a prosperous future,Future development  Thamesport is in danger of being eclipsed by the new and much bigger London Gateway port on the north bank of the Thames. London Gateway is now operational and (as of September 2017) is receiving 17 container ships per day.\\"The Times\\" 2 September 2017 p.53 Satellite photographs of the Thamesport site appear to show that the facility is being dismantled; the large marshalling yard for containers is now empty. There are plans for a cement factory on the former container marshalling yard. Land traffic ;Road Thamesport is connected to national road network by the A228. ;Rail The port also has from a connection to the single-tracked, standard gauge, freight Hundred of Hoo Railway. Two British rail freight companies – DB Cargo UK and Freightliner – currently have container services to Thamesport.\\"Thamesport Celebrates Links to the UK's Capital\\" : Press Release from Thamesport's owner, Hutchison Ports (UK) Limited, dated 19 June 2008 In the first half of 2005 approximately 25% of traffic to and from Thamesport used the rail link.

History Synapse Films was owned and operated by Don May, Jr. and his business partners Jerry Chandler and Charles Fiedler, the catalyst being May's longstanding interest in and passion for TV and cinema. May explained, “I caught the laserdisc bug while working at a local laserdisc store while I was in college. I was selling laserdisc players and buying product and I pretty much spent every extra dollar I had on laserdiscs. I loved movies and the disc format and knew this was a business I wanted to be in.” May became a part owner of Elite Entertainment after leaving his aforementioned job in laserdisc retail. The Synapse catalog ranges from European horror touchstones like Vampyros Lesbos, and Castle of Blood, to important genre documentaries including Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead, from drive-in favorites like The Brain That Wouldn't Die to Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi film Triumph of the Will. In 2004, Synapse released a definitive edition of the controversial Thriller – A Cruel Picture.

White pulp consists entirely of lymphoid tissue. Specifically, the white pulp encompasses several areas with distinct functions: * The periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS) are typically associated with the arteriole supply of the spleen; they contain T lymphocytes. * Lymph follicles with dividing B lymphocytes are located between the PALS and the marginal zone bordering on the red pulp. IgM and IgG2 are produced in this zone. These molecules play a role in opsonization of extracellular organisms, encapsulated bacteria in particular. * The marginal zone exists between the white pulp and red pulp. It is located farther away from the central arteriole, in proximity to the red pulp. It contains antigen- presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Some of the white pulp's macrophages are of a specialized kind known as metallophilic macrophages.  Macrophages in the white pulp  The T cell zone (periarteriolar sheath) and B cell follicles contain discrete macrophage populations; however, not much is known about these macrophage populations in terms of their origin and lifespan. These macrophages are not unique to the spleen but instead make up an integral part of the lymphoid parts of all secondary lymphoid organs. In the B cell follicles, the macrophages are important in clearing the apoptotic B cells that occur during the germinal centre reaction in the process of somatic hypermutation and isotype switching. B cells that cannot form their appropriate receptors will die of apoptosis and are subsequently cleared by the macrophages in the germinal centre. During intensive germinal centre reactions, this process is obvious due to the presence of the large macrophages in the germinal centre, known as tingible body macrophages. (They're named this because their 'tingible bodies' represent condensed apoptotic nuclei.) In order for the apoptotic cells to be taken up by macrophages, it is important that phosphatidylserine is expressed on the outer surface of the apoptotic cells, which is recognized by multiple receptors. The tangible body macrophages express: tyrosine kinase Mer, the milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8 and Tim-4, all of which supports the engulfment of the apoptotic cells into the macrophages. Macrophages are also present in the T cell area of the white pulp but their role is less well understood. This population of macrophages can be found in all the other T cell zones of the secondary lymphoid organs. It is possible that these macrophages are descendants of patrolling monocytes that entered the white pulp from the blood. Due to them being positioned alongside T cells, it is suggested that these macrophages have a role in antigen presentation or the removal of dying lymphocytes.

He earned 33 caps for Trinidad and Tobago between 1997 and 2006, playing for his country in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Football career Kelvin Jack started his career playing in Trinidad and Tobago with hometown club Trincity United and Joe Public before earning a scholarship to join Yavapai College in Arizona. While a student there he helped the Roughriders win the NJCAA title in his first year and reach the 3rd position the following year. After finishing college he went to Norway for trials before returning to Trinidad, playing most notably with San Juan Jabloteh for two seasons. Jack started his career in English football with Reading in 2004, but did not make any appearances for the club. Jack was later sold to Scottish Premier League team Dundee, where he stayed despite their relegation to the Scottish First Division. Jack was a regular member of the Trinidad and Tobago national football team during the qualifying campaign for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and travelled to Germany as coach Leo Beenhakker's first-choice goalkeeper. He was expected to play in their first game against Sweden but sustained a calf injury in the warm up, enabling Shaka Hislop to step in. Jack, who would later describe the experience as 'the saddest day of his life', also missed out on playing in the team's second match against England. Jack did go on to play in the Soca Warriors' final group game against Paraguay, which ended in a 2–0 defeat in which Brent Sancho scored an own goal. The Paraguay match was his last international match to date. Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Jack signed for Gillingham and made his debut in a 2–1 home win over Huddersfield Town on 5 August. However, in part due to injuries, he made only eleven appearances for the Gills. In February 2008, Jack joined Barnsley on trial but broke his leg in what was described as a \\"freak training ground accident\\". It was announced on 7 May 2008 that he had been released by Gillingham. He had since been training with English lower league clubs Aldershot Town and Southend United in a bid to regain his fitness. In February 2010, Jack joined Southend United on a short- term contract to act as back-up whilst regular reserve goalkeeper Ian Joyce left on trial with an American club. Without making any appearances he was released at the end of the season on 11 May, and was signed to a one-year contract by Darlington manager Simon Davey for the 2010–11 season. In October, unable to secure a first team place, he joined Kettering Town on a three-month loan. He was released by Darlington in January 2011. In a bid to keep up his fitness, Jack spent the 2011 pre-season training with Isthmian League Division One South side Maidstone United and appeared in two of the club's pre-season friendlies. Shortly after on 31 August 2011 Jack made a one-off appearance for Isthmian League Premier Division side AFC Hornchurch, playing in a 2–1 loss away to Lowestoft Town after first-team goalkeeper Darren Behcet picked up an injury. On 11 November 2011 it was announced Jack had again joined up with Maidstone United to cover first-team goalkeeper Charlie Mitten after he suffered a hip injury. He made his debut a day later in a 4–1 win against Ramsgate and made a total of three appearances for the club. He returned to his former club Kettering Town in March 2012 to provide cover for the injured Laurie Walker, making his debut in their 1–3 defeat to Stockport County on 31 March.

History  The canvas (50 ½ by 37 ½ inches / 128.3 cm by 95.3 cm) was one of many portraits of Dora Maar painted by Pablo Picasso over their nearly decade-long relationship. Picasso fell in love at the age of 55 with the 29-year-old Maar and the couple soon began living together. This painting was made during the year 1941, when the Nazis were occupying France. In the 1940s, the painting was obtained by Chicago collectors Leigh and Mary Block. They sold the painting in 1963.\\"Picasso's 'Dora Maar au Chat' Sells for $95.2 Mln at Sotheby's\\", Lindsay Pollock and Philip Boroff, Bloomberg.com, May 3, 2006. After that, the painting was never shown until the 21st century. During 2005 and 2006, Dora Maar au Chat, then owned by the Gidwitz family of Chicago, was shown worldwide as part of Sotheby's exhibitions in London, Hong Kong and New York. It came up for sale in an auction of Impressionist/Modern works held at Sotheby's on May 3, 2006 in New York and making it the second- highest price ever paid for a painting at auction. An anonymous Russian bidder present at the New York auction won the work with a final bid of US$95,216,000, well exceeding the pre-auction US$50 million estimates.\\"Pablo Picasso Portrait of Dora Maar brings $95,216,000 at Sotheby's\\" , News- Antique.com, May 4, 2006. The identity of the bidder, who spent more than US$100 million in total, and purchased an 1883 Monet seascape and a 1978 Chagall in addition to the Picasso, was a topic of much speculation.

Descriptions of painting  Dora Maar au Chat presents the artist's most mysterious and challenging mistress regally posed three-quarter length in a large wooden chair with a small black cat perched behind her in both an amusing and menacing attitude. The faceted planes of her body and richly layered surface of brushstrokes impart a monumental and sculptural quality to this portrait. The painting is also remarkable for its brilliance of colour and the complex and dense patterning of the model's dress. The powerful figure is set in a dramatic, yet simple setting composed of a vertiginously inclined plane of wooden floorboards and shallow interior space that is arranged in a manner reminiscent of Picasso's earliest manipulations of space in a cubist manner. Dora Maar au Chat is one of Picasso's most valued depictions of his lover and artistic companion. Their partnership had been one of intellectual exchange and intense passion—Dora was an artist, spoke Picasso's native Spanish, and shared his political concerns. She even assisted with the execution of the monumental Guernica and produced the only photo-documentary of the work in progress. She was an intellectual force – a characteristic that both stimulated and challenged Picasso and her influence on him resulted in some of his most powerful and daring portraits of his 75-year career. Among the best of them are the oils completed during the late 1930s and early 1940s, when Picasso's art resonated with the drama and emotional upheaval of the era and which Dora came to personify. The luminous Dora Maar au Chat was painted in 1941, at the beginning of the Second World War in France. Maar was one of the most influential figures in Picasso's life during their relationship and she also became his primary model. By the time he painted the present picture he had incorporated Dora Maar's image into countless versions of this motif. During the occupation of Paris by the Nazis, and as tension mounted in their relationship, the artist would express his frustration by furiously abstracting her image, often portraying her in tears. While the present portrait might seem a departure from Picasso's more hostile depictions of this model, it may be one of his most brilliant and biting provocations of his Weeping Woman. Picasso once likened Maar's allure and temperament to that of an “Afghan cat”, and the cat in this picture is laden with significance. In the history of art, the pairing of cats and women was an allusion to feminine wiles and sexual aggression, as exemplified in Manet’s notorious Olympia. The artist has paid particular attention to the sharp, talon-like nails on the long fingers of his model. In life Maar's well-manicured hands were one of her most beautiful and distinctive features, and here they have taken on another, more violent characteristic. In addition to being a rare, three-quarter length portrait of Dora Maar, the present work is also a generous and painterly composition with an extraordinary attention to detail. The artist used an extraordinarily vibrant palette in his rendering of the angles of the chair and the patterning of Maar's dress. The most embellished and symbolic element of the sitter's wardrobe in this picture is her hat, Maar's most famous accessory and signifier of her involvement in the Surrealist movement. Ceremoniously placed atop her head like a crown, it is festooned with colourful plumes and outlined with a band of vibrant red. Larger than life, an impression enhanced by her vibrant body that cannot be confined by the boundaries of the chair, Maar looms in this picture like a pagan goddess seated on her throne.

The album did however lead to a tour of the United Kingdom, including a residency at the Marquee in London, which, despite much heckling during performances, helped them to secure a significant cult following. An appearance on the BBC Television's Old Grey Whistle Test led to wider interest, regardless of a cold reception from the show's host Bob Harris. Re-issue A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing has been re-released numerous times since 1973. It is often packaged with its predecessor Sparks. One such re-issue was released in 1975 to capitalize on the group's success in the UK. This version was titled 2 Originals of Sparks and was packaged as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve with a 14-page booklet. In 1988, the album was first issued on CD, again in tandem with the first Sparks album, but in order to fit both programs within the constraints of a single disc, the last four tracks of the album were mastered at a higher speed than on the original LP, shortening the running time to 39:27. Though the album has subsequently been reissued in a standalone format, including the most recent reissue on Rhino Encore, released in 2008, the sped-up master has continued to be used. Reception A Woofer In Tweeter's Clothing received mixed to positive reviews by the majority of critics.

Several writers who confirmed that a prejudice against pork existed, or a superstitious attitude to pigs, do not see it in terms of a taboo related to an ancient cult. Any prejudice is generally agreed to have been fading by 1800. Some writers attribute a scarcity or dislike of pork in certain periods to a shortage of pig fodder. Mackenzie's ideas Donald Mackenzie gave a lecture on the Scottish pork taboo in 1920Lecture at the Celtic Congress in Edinburgh 26 May 1920 when he explained his idea that prejudices against pork-eating could be traced back to a centuries-old religious cult. When he published these theories in the 1930s, he suggested the taboo was imported to Scotland in pre-Roman times by Celtic mercenaries, influenced by the cult of Attis in Anatolia. (The cult of Attis did not abstain permanently from pork; it was a purification for their ceremonies.Emperor Julian; Hymn to the Mother of the Gods 177B, LCL, 1913, vol I.) He dismissed any possibility that the pork taboo originated from a literal reading of the Bible, and disputed this with various arguments, noting that early Christian missionaries did not snub pork. He conceded that archaeological evidence was found of pigs being eaten in prehistoric Scotland, but suggested this might have come from pork-eating peoples living near others who did observe the taboo, or be related to ceremonial use of pigs. Later pork production was for export, not for local use, just as eels were caught to send to the English market, while they were unacceptable as food in Scotland. The taboo died out in the Lowlands earlier than in the Highlands, and by the 1800s, most crofts in the Highlands and Islands would have kept a grice. Other folklorists, such as Isabel Grant, have accepted this theory of a taboo.Ross, p. 99 =Writers cited by Mackenzie= In addition to proposing ideas developed from studying the mythology and folklore of Scotland and other cultures, Mackenzie quoted writers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Walter Scott referred to Scottish Highlanders' dislike of pork in more than one book,Fortunes of Nigel, Rob Roy, Waverley and around 1814 explained that > Pork or swine’s flesh, in any shape, was, till of late years, much > abominated by the Scotch, nor is it yet a favourite food amongst them. King > Jamie carried this prejudice to England, and is known to have abhorred pork > almost as much as he did tobacco.Waverley, footnote to Chapter 20 Scott's remark that Ben Jonson \\"recorded\\" the king's aversion to pork in his masque The Gipsies Metamorphosed, when the king has his hand read, is based on these words: > You should, by this line, > Love a horse and a hound, but no part of a swine. Samuel Johnson found an \\"abhorrence\\" of pork and bacon on Skye in the 1770s. > It is not very easy to fix the principles upon which mankind have agreed to > eat some animals, and reject others; and as the principle is not evident, it > is not uniform. […] The vulgar inhabitants of Sky, I know not whether of the > other islands, have not only eels, but pork and bacon in abhorrence, and > accordingly I never saw a hog in the Hebrides, except one at Dunvegan.A > Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775) Mackenzie suggested that a verse in the English satirical song \\"The Brewer\\" from A Collection of Loyal Songs referred to the taboo: > The Jewish Scots that scorn to eat > The flesh of swine and Brewer's beat > 'Twas the sight of this hogshead made 'em retreat > Which nobody can deny! He believed that this, and other comments associating Scots with Jews, confirm the existence of the taboo, but have nothing to do with its origin. However, Celtic Christians had long faced accusations of 'judaizing'. He described a superstition about touching or saying \\"cauld airn\\" (cold iron) when pigs are mentioned. This was discussed by Dean Ramsay, and is also included in Walter McGregor's Notes on the folk-lore of the north-east of Scotland (Folklore Society 1881).Cited by PWF Brown > Among the many superstitious notions and customs prevalent among the lower > orders of the fishing towns on the east coast of Fife, till very recently, > that class entertained a great horror of swine . . . .Reminiscences of > Scottish Life and Character (1874) Mackenzie disagreed with Edward Burt, whose Letters from a Gentleman in the North of Scotland (1754)pp117 -118 in the 1822 edition discusses an “aversion” to pork in the Highlands, but says it is not “superstitious”. Other writers referring to a prejudice against pork Bishop John Lesley's History of Scotland talks of \\"our cuntrie peple\\" having \\"lytle plesure\\" in pork in the 1570s.Translated from Latin into Scots by James Dalrymple in 1596, published in Edinburgh in 1895, quoted by WM Mackenzie In contrast to the alleged tastes of country folk, pigs were supplied to the royal household for the table of Mary, Queen of Scots from former monastic lands.Gordon Donaldson, Thirds of Benefices (SHS, Edinburgh, 1949), p. 43. At least four ministers writing about their parishes for the Statistical Accounts of Scotland in the 1790s speak of a prejudice which is starting to fade: for instance, \\"The deep rooted prejudice against swine's flesh is now removed: most of the farmers rear some of that species, which not 30 years ago, they held in the utmost detestation.\\" (Ardchattan, County of Argyle) Account of 1791-99, volume 6, page 177)Also Lesmahagow in Lanarkshire, Kiltearn in Ross and Cromarty and Longforgan in Perthshire Twentieth-century historian Christopher Smout speaks of \\"a universal superstitious prejudice\\".Ross cites Smout's A History of the Scottish People 1560-1830, p 132 An archaeological survey of pork consumption in Scotland by the Society of Antiquities in Scotland in 2000 states: \\"Whether there is any archaeological evidence of this prejudice against pigs, for whatever reason, is open to question.\\" and that \\"During the medieval period, it has been noted that rural sites contained more pig bones than urban sites, and that the lowest relative frequencies come from the most southerly of the burghs considered, Peebles and Perth. This contradicts the notion that it was the ‘Highlanders’ who abhorred pork, unless it is assumed that, despite this dislike, they continued to produce it for sale to others.\\"p.13 http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/PSAS_2002/pdf/vol_130/130_705_724.pdf Writers disputing Donald Mackenzie's theories Historian William Mackay Mackenzie published his thoughts in the Scotsman letters pages (8 October 1921) as part of a long-running debate arising from D. A. Mackenzie's lecture in 1920. While agreeing there had been a \\"sporadic prejudice\\" against pork in parts of Scotland, and offering illustrations of this, he was against the idea of a link to a \\"religious cult\\". He saw economic factors at work between 1500 and 1800 which would discourage pig-keeping. He cited several examples of pork consumption in the Middle Ages, and described a \\"temporary lapse\\" when \\"the great forests disappeared from Scotland\\". In 1983, American anthropologist Eric B. Ross put forward arguments based on a detailed study of Scottish agricultural history, and asserted the value of cultural materialism rooted in evolutionary anthropology for studying dietary customs, thus avoiding explanations based on \\"relatively esoteric\\" beliefs. Because of deforestation, a loss of beech mast and acorns for feeding pigs occurred, and potatoes were not produced in sufficient quantity to offer a useful alternative until the late 18th century. Throughout this gap in pork consumption by the general population, many of the Scottish upper classes continued to eat the meat. He summed up: > In the years of the 18th century and probably earlier, swine were rarely > raised in Scotland, particularly in the Scottish Highlands, and subsequent > writers have gone so far as to postulate the operation of a taboo on the > eating of pork. Unfortunately there is almost nothing known today about > local sentiments of that era, and we have only the intellectual > rationalizations of educated writers who all too easily found an explanation > for the scarcity of pigs in the assumption that a 'foolish prejudice' was at > work.Eric B.

Markin, OC, AOE (born May 6, 1945, in the then-town of Bowness, now part of Calgary) was the chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Limited and is a co-owner of the Calgary Flames ice hockey franchise of the National Hockey League based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Education and career Markin is a chemical engineer, having graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Alberta in 1968. He has also received honorary degrees from the University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Lethbridge and St. Francis Xavier University. He held positions in senior management with Merland Exploration (Executive VP, 1975 to 1981) and Helton Engineering (Owner and Vice-President, 1971 to 1974) before joining Calgary's Poco Petroleum as President and Chief Executive Officer (1982 to 1988). In 1989, together with N. Murray Edwards, Markin co-founded and became Chairman of the Board of Canadian Natural Resources Limited. He resigned as the Chairman of CNRL on April 2, 2012, which may have been triggered with his involvement with Pure North S'Energy Foundation. He is now the Chief Accountability Officer at Pure North S'Energy Foundation, a non-profit charitable foundation. He became a co- owner of the Calgary Flames in 1994. Philanthropy He is one of the founders, with a cumulative contribution of $23.3 million, to St. Mary's University College and was named an Honorary Fellow in 2004. Commencing in 1992, the Allan P. Markin Engineering Entrance Awards give out 150 scholarships of $1,000 each at the University of Alberta. Markin and CNRL were major donors of $3 million each to the University of Alberta's Markin/CNRL Natural Resources Engineering Facility opened in October 2004. Markin has also provided funds to the University of Alberta to set up a Research Chair in Nutrition and Disease Prevention. On September 16, 2004, he donated the largest gift in the history of the University of Calgary – $18 million – to allow the university to establish the Institute for Public Health. He also contributed $3 million to the University of Calgary to create the Markin Chair in Health and Society, and supports the Markin Undergraduate Student Research Program in Health & Wellness. In 2005, he made a large contribution to the Legacy of Leadership campaign at the University of Lethbridge. His donation, combined with early private funding and corporate and government support, facilitated construction of Markin Hall in 2008, which houses the Faculty of Management and Faculty of Health Sciences. On April 13, 2006, he matched CNRL's donation of $500,000 to help Northern Lights College open their new Centre of Excellence in Fort St. John. In 2009, he donated over a million dollars to St. Francis Xavier University's Coady International Institute, which helps educate students from developing nations to become leaders and make a meaningful difference in their communities. In addition, since 2007, Markin has provided over $16 million in funding to a health promotion project called A Project Promoting healthy Living for Everyone in Schools (known as APPLE Schools) to help schools be healthy places that support students to form lifelong healthy habits. APPLE serves 16,500 children in 63 Northern Alberta schools including schools serving First Nations' populations. He has also provided financial support to the Barbara and Myer Horowitz Library Endowment Fund, Augustana University College, and Keyano College. In 2007, he founded Pure North S'Energy Foundation, a non-profit charitable foundation that provides and promotes preventative health treatments, such as vitamins and minerals, lifestyle counselling and, in some cases, treatments to remove heavy metals from participants' blood. Pure North was started as a health program for CNRL employees, although CNRL eventually withdrew the health program from its employee benefits plan. In 2013, the Pure North S'Energy Foundation was given a $10 million grant from the Province of Alberta to defray the costs of providing free health prevention and management services to seniors. The Albertan health minister at the time, Fred Horne, approved the funding against the advice of officials from several ministries who had determined program was not adequately supported by scientific evidence, could not prove the health and economic benefits it claimed, and could cause adverse health effects in participants. In a 2017 CBC investigation, many irregularities with the funding were identified including lack of details in the project plan, change in the scope of the project to not require an independent approval from a research ethics board, the speed and method that payment was provided, and lack of concern over provincial liability with the project. Alberta Health reviewed this grant and concluded there was no convincing data to support the cost-saving claims the program was making. In April 2016, University of Calgary economist J.C. Herbert Emery calculated that for every dollar invested in the Pure North program, there was a savings of $2.36 to the health care system in reduced hospitalization and ambulatory care, in addition to improved productivity.http://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/pure-north- preventative-care-emery.pdf In 2016, Pure North received $4.2 million, along with three other agencies that serve the homeless, addicted, seniors and other under-served populations, to undertake a pilot project using nurse practitioners to deliver health services. Other organizations that have benefitted from Markin's community leadership include the United Way ($5.7 million) and the Nature Conservancy of Canada. Further afield, he has given valued support to organizations such as World Vision Canada, the Sri Narayani Foundation in India for the Education of Children, and programs for children in Chinese Tibet and the Coady International Institute at St. Francis Xavier University. In 2018, it was revealed that Markin was a substantial donor to the fund which paid the ransom to release Amanda Lindhout from her Somalian captors.

It was built in 1733 and is now a Grade I listed building. The house stands in extensive grounds on the left bank of the River Avon, opposite Charlton-All-Saints. History The house, formerly called Standlynch Park, was built on the ancient manor of Standlynch, listed in the Domesday book of 1086. The Beauchamp family held the manor during the Tudor period, after which it was bought by the Greene family, who owned it until the 17th century, when it was sold to the Buckland family. = Construction of the house = Standlynch Manor was bought by Sir Peter Vandeput in 1726. Three years later, he had John James design what would eventually become the Trafalgar Park which can be seen today. Sir Peter died in 1748, bequeathing the estate to his son George, who in 1752 sold it to Sir William Young. Henry Dawkins bought it from Young in 1765. Over time, the expansion of the estate erased the former settlement of Standlynch. In 1766 Henry Dawkins had John Wood design pavilions to the north and south of the building. He also had Nicholas Revett add a stone portico and remodel the internal architecture of the north wing. The music room was redecorated by Giovanni Battista Cipriani. Dawkins died in 1814, and the executors of the estate sought buyers. =Nelson family, 1815–1948= During the Battle of Trafalgar off the coast of Spain in 1805, The 1st Viscount Nelson was shot and died on 21 October, leaving a widow but no legitimate offspring.Hibbert, Christopher (1994). Nelson: A Personal History. Basic Books. , pg 376 Nelson’s closest male relative was his elder brother, The Rev. William Nelson, who was created Earl Nelson in 1806 along with other titles of Horatio’s and who lobbied for an estate in honour of his brother. Parliament's Lords of the Treasury resolved accordingly. Standlynch Park was chosen in 1814 by Act of Parliament and was renamed Trafalgar Park. The 1st Earl also acquired nearby Redlynch House (2.8 km to south-east) with its 25 acre park, which he provided as a home to his son-in-law Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport.A P Baggs, Elizabeth Crittall, Jane Freeman and Janet H Stevenson, 'Parishes: Downton', in A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 11, Downton Hundred; Elstub and Everleigh Hundred, ed. D A Crowley (London, 1980), pp. 19-77 After William Nelson’s death, his nephew Thomas Bolton succeeded as The 2nd Earl Nelson and changed his surname to Nelson and inherited the property. When he died less than a year later, his 12-year-old son Horatio inherited the estate in 1836. The 3rd Earl Nelson went to great lengths to ensure that the estate was well maintained; he commissioned a new garden and renovation of Standlynch Church. In 1930, The 4th Earl Nelson purchased the panelling of the Captain’s Cabin of HMS Ganges, built in 1821, which was being broken up, installing the panelling in the principal top floor room at Trafalgar Park. During the Second World War, the North and South Wings were occupied by tenants with Lord Nelson and his younger brother Edward Agar Nelson living in the main house.The History of Trafalgar Park =Since 1948= In 1948, the 5th Earl Nelson sold the estate to John Osborne, 11th Duke of Leeds, whose brother-in-law Oliver Lyttelton, 1st Viscount Chandos, lived there while he was an MP. Eventually Lyttleton bought the estate and lived there until 1971, when Jeremy Pinckney bought the house. Pinckney lived there for six years, after which he sold the estate. A series of others bought and sold Trafalgar Park over the following years. The house was recorded as Grade I listed in 1960. Michael Wade of Besso Limited bought the house in 1995, by which time it needed extensive restoration. The renovation of the estate began after enough parkland had been returned from the Longford Estate. The south stable has been converted into offices. According to Country Life, it was Wade who renamed Trafalgar House as Trafalgar Park. Films made at the estate include 28 Days Later, Sense and Sensibility and Amazing Grace. Conferences and day-away board meetings are held here throughout the year, as are charity fundraisers. Over the years the Park has been host to associations such as the National Trust, The Civic Trust and the Salisbury Hospice. Tours are sometimes arranged although the house is closed to the public. In January 2017, it was listed for sale at £12 million.

Its primary function is to filter the blood of antigens, microorganisms, and defective or worn-out red blood cells. The spleen is made of red pulp and white pulp, separated by the marginal zone; 76-79% of a normal spleen is red pulp. Unlike white pulp, which mainly contains lymphocytes such as T cells, red pulp is made up of several different types of blood cells, including platelets, granulocytes, red blood cells, and plasma. The red pulp also acts as a large reservoir for monocytes. These monocytes are found in clusters in the Billroth's cords (red pulp cords). The population of monocytes in this reservoir is greater than the total number of monocytes present in circulation. They can be rapidly mobilised to leave the spleen and assist in tackling ongoing infections. Sinusoids The splenic sinusoids, are wide vessels that drain into pulp veins which themselves drain into trabecular veins. Gaps in the endothelium lining the sinusoids mechanically filter blood cells as they enter the spleen. Worn-out or abnormal red cells attempting to squeeze through the narrow intercellular spaces become badly damaged, and are subsequently devoured by macrophages in the red pulp. In addition to clearing aged red blood cells, the sinusoids also filter out cellular debris, particles that could clutter up the bloodstream. Cells found in red pulp Red pulp consists of a dense network of fine reticular fiber, continuous with those of the splenic trabeculae, to which are applied flat, branching cells. The meshes of the reticulum are filled with blood: * White blood cells are found to be in larger proportion than they are in ordinary blood. * Large rounded cells, termed splenic cells, are also seen; these are capable of ameboid movement, and often contain pigment and red-blood corpuscles in their interior. * The cells of the reticulum each possess a round or oval nucleus, and like the splenic cells, they may contain pigment granules in their cytoplasm; they do not stain deeply with carmine, and in this respect differ from the cells of the Malpighian corpuscles. * In the young spleen, macrophages may also be found, each containing numerous nuclei or one compound nucleus. * Nucleated red blood cells have also been found in the spleen of young animals. = Red pulp macrophages = Macrophages are highly diverse mononuclear phagocytes that are present throughout the body, including the spleen. Those located in the red pulp are known as red pulp macrophages (RPMs). They are necessary for maintaining blood homeostasis by performing phagocytosis upon injured and senescent erythrocytes and blood- borne particulates. Evidence suggests that RPMs are mainly produced during embryogenesis and are maintained during adult life. Additionally, there are a number of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors that regulate the development and survival of RPMs, these factors being: Spi-C, IRF8/4, heme oxygenase-1 and M-CSF. RPM's are capable of inducing the differentiation of regulatory T cells by the expression of transforming growth factor-β. They can also secrete type-1 interferons during parasitic infections. Blood in the arteries end in the Billroth's cords (red pulp cords). These cords are made up of fibroblasts and reticular fibres which form an open blood system without an endothelial lining, and it is within these cords that F4/80+ macrophages are found, which are associated with the reticular cells of these areas and are collectively known as red pulp macrophages. From the Billroth's cords, the blood passes into the venous sinuses of the red pulp, which are lined with discontinuous endothelium as well as stress fibres extending under the basal plasma membrane, parallel to the cellular axis. This arrangement of the stress fibres combined with the parallel arrangement of the sinus endothelial cells forces the blood in the red pulp through slits that are formed by the stress fibres. However, this passage can become difficult for ageing red blood cells due to their less flexible membranes and therefore they get stuck in the cords and they will be subsequently phagocytosed by the red pulp macrophages. This process is known as erythrophagocytosis, which is important for the turnover of red blood cells and the recycling of iron, which is a major function of the red pulp macrophages and is made possible by this special structure of the red pulp. The iron from the red blood cells is either released by the red pulp macrophages or stored in the erythrocyte itself in the form of ferritin. Also, the erythrocyte can store larger amounts of iron in the form of hemosiderin (an insoluble complex of partially degraded ferritin), and large deposits of this can be seen in the red pulp macrophages. The red pulp macrophages also obtain iron by scavenging a complex of haemoglobin (released from erythrocytes destroyed intravascularly throughout the body) and haptoglobin, via endocytosis through CD163. The iron stored in the splenic macrophages is released in accordance with the requirements of the bone marrow. Diseases In lymphoid leukemia, the white pulp of the spleen hypertrophies and the red pulp shrinks. In some cases the white pulp can swell to 50% of the total volume of the spleen. In myeloid leukemia, the white pulp atrophies and the red pulp expands.

However, national security decisions typically made by national security councils in other countries are handled by the Security Cabinet. The Council draws its authority from the government and operates according to guidelines from the Prime Minister. The NSC was established in 1999 by the office of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu following Government Resolution 4889, in the framework of drawing lessons from the Yom Kippur War. Its responsibilities were anchored in law starting in July 2008, partly as a response to the Second Lebanon War.  Basis for operations  Article 7 of the Government Law of 2001 states that \\"the Government will have a staff, established by the Prime Minister, to provide professional consulting in the fields of national security; the Prime Minister is authorized to entrust the staff with additional consulting fields.\\" Government Resolution 4889, dated March 7 1999, established the National Security Council. The Government resolution specified, among others, that: * The objective of the NSC is to serve as a centralized advisory body to the Prime Minister and the Government regarding issues of national security. * The NSC derives its authority from the Government and operates in accordance with directives issued by the Prime Minister.  Roles  The National Security Council is the Prime Minister's and the Government's staff forum in the field of national security. The roles of the NSC, as stipulated in the Government Resolution, are as follows: * To hold senior council forums for the Prime Minister and the Government regarding issues of national security. * To coordinate integrative assessments of processes and trends in all aspects of national security. * To direct integrative staff operations between offices and authorities dealing with national security in order to increase coordination and integration between them. * To prepare for deliberations by the government, ministerial committee for national security and the Prime Minister. * To advise the government on policies relating to national security. * To plan, based on a long-term perspective, national security components, with the assistance of existing planning bodies in State offices and organizations dealing with national security. * To follow up and provide updates regarding activities and implementation of resolutions related to national security. * To maintain coordination and cooperation with parallel national security authorities in selected countries. Among the Council's functions are: strategic advisement to the Prime Minister, offering security recommendations to the government, joint direction and coordinations of the security arms as well as inspection and supervision of decision-making related to the security bodies. Other functions include long-term planning of security approaches, and maintaining cooperative and coordinative relations with the national security elements of selected countries. The NSC also maintains high- level diplomatic communications with world powers.  Major areas of activity  The NSC formulates alternatives for Israeli policy on the political process and relationships with: * Middle East countries, especially with the Palestinians, Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Jordan and other countries. * Great powers: the United States, Russia, European Union, China and India. * Key countries: Turkey and India * Major international organizations such as the United Nations, NATO and OECD. The Council has engaged in issues such as the planning of the West Bank barrier and supervision over its implementation, the Gaza disengagement plan, and the agreement with Egypt over the Philadelphi Route. A new area of activity relates to energy issues, based on a comprehensive national security perspective, including: * Energy providers * Strategic reserves * Source combination  Structure  The National Security Council is part of the Prime Minister's Office and reports to him directly about issues related to national security. The Council comprises three wings: Security Policy, Foreign Policy, and the Counter-Terrorism Bureau. It has two advisors: legal and economic. Since the end of December 2006, the office of the head of the NSC and the staff of the Foreign Policy Division, the Security Division and the Legal Advisor have been located in the Prime Minister's building in Jerusalem. The remaining staff of the NSC and the Counter- Terrorism Bureau headquarters are located at the NSC facility in Ramat Hasharon. The Council's work is considered secret, and is done outside the public's eye. Its authority is vague and the Prime Minister is not obligated to accept its recommendations, unlike with those of the Attorney General, for example. = Head = The first National Security Advisor and Head of NSC was General (in reserve) David Ivri.

Storylines =1993–1998= Clare, the daughter of Debbie Tyler (Nicola Duffett), arrives in Walford in 1993 when her mother moves in with her new partner Nigel Bates (Paul Bradley). Her father, Liam (Francis Magee) was abusive towards Debbie, which led to them separating. Liam follows them to Walford and tries everything possible to break Nigel and Debbie up. Despite problems, Debbie marries Nigel in 1994 and Clare is happy with them; however, her happiness is cut short when her mother dies in a hit-and-run accident in 1995. Nigel falls apart and Clare has to look after him but Nigel sorts himself out when Liam returns, wanting custody of Clare but Clare is happy and does not want to leave her stepfather. Nigel fights Liam for Clare and wins after Liam is forced to withdraw his case as his girlfriend admits in court that Liam has been violent towards her. Clare is friendly with the other young girls in Walford, Janine Butcher (Alexia Demetriou) and Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy). They cause trouble for the barber Felix Kawalski (Harry Landis) in November 1995, when they spread rumours that he is a pervert who has murdered his wife, and keeps her mutilated body in his cellar. Clare breaks into Felix's barber shop one evening to find the body but she trips on the cellar stairs and is knocked unconscious. The adults of Walford fear Clare has been abducted by Felix; they confront him, but find Clare safe and well. Felix has only been hiding a collection of butterflies. In 1997, Clare starts socialising with a bad crowd at school, and subsequently begins bullying her friend, Sonia, leading to her being reprimanded by her teacher, Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn). Nigel takes her to his old school to show her the pain that bullies inflict on their victims, making her see sense so she makes peace with Sonia. She then falls for a boy at her school, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee), who rescues Clare from her old gang after they turn on her for leaving their clique. They start dating — despite Nigel's objections — though their romance hits a brief setback when Clare discovers that his mother is also her teacher, Julie. Despite her initial upset, Clare comes round and she is happy when Nigel and Julie begin dating. When Julie gets a job in Scotland, Nigel and Clare decide to join her and Josh, leaving Walford in April 1998. =2008= On 1 February 2008, Clare returns to Albert Square; she is thrown from the back seat of a car. Nigel's former landlady, Dot Branning, persuades her to stay. Clare moves in with Dot and gets a job as receptionist at Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner)'s beauty parlour. Preferring rich men, Clare tries to attract the attention of the wealthy men in Albert Square. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his brother Max (Jake Wood) show no interest; however, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is more susceptible despite being married to Jane (Laurie Brett). Clare flirts with Ian, wears revealing clothes and talks suggestively but she is playing a game and has no intention of taking things further, acting shocked when Ian suggests that she does. She blackmails Ian, threatening to inform Jane of his dishonourable intentions unless he pays to keep quiet but Ian tells Jane himself so she confronts Clare, warning her to stay away from Ian. Clare becomes interested in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) when he gets a lucrative property development job. They grow closer to him and she attempts to seduce him but he rebuffs her advances, due to recently separating from his wife, Stacey (Lacey Turner), but relents when Clare dresses up as Princess Leia to impress him. He propositions her but Clare refuses to have sex with him, breaking down and telling him about an affair she had with an aggressive, married man named Arnold. Arnold traces Clare to Walford, wanting to rekindle their affair but Clare only wanted Arnold to buy her expensive gifts and when he stopped, she fled. Clare knows that Arnold had bought his wife expensive jewellery and persuades Bradley to help her steal it by claiming that it belongs to her. Believing Arnold is a bully, Bradley agrees. The robbery goes off without a hitch, but Arnold sees Clare leaving and returns to Walford to confront her. Clare admits that she never loved Arnold and was only using him for his money. When he threatens to call the police, Clare threatens to ruin his marriage and Bradley throws him out after Clare lies that he was verbally abusing her. Satisfied with her pay off, Clare realises that Bradley is too good for her and tells him this, refusing to start a relationship, but is jealous, however, when Bradley reconciles with Stacey. Despite starting as enemies, Clare becomes friends with her colleague, Chelsea Fox (Tiana Benjamin) and they regularly go out together, looking for wealthy men. When Chelsea starts using drugs, her behaviour becomes erratic and she steals £100 from Tanya. Sensing an opportunity to make money, Clare also steals £100 and blames the theft on Chelsea, who is fired from her job. Subsequently, Clare and Chelsea's friendship ends. Revealing a more vulnerable side, Clare becomes morose and upset on the anniversary of her mother's death, telling Dot that she feels alone and can only rely upon herself. The following month, she is devastated when Nigel fails to visit. She breaks down in tears, telling Bradley that she and Nigel had grown apart as she had aged. Later, she tells Garry Hobbs (Ricky Groves) that Nigel was unsupportive when she slept with a boy at school and got a reputation for being promiscuous, simply putting her on the pill. Bradley's support helps Clare realise she has to change and vows to put her gold digging behind her but Bradley finds her diary that shows her plan to take his money. He subsequently turns against her so Clare throws a party at Dot's house, inviting random people who trash the place. Dot, realising Clare is depressed, tries to get her to seek counsel from God. Clare reacts with fury, but following advice from Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet), she tries to make amends with Dot and even attempts to pray but Bradley is not convinced and insists Clare leave Walford. Clare does, leaving behind a goodbye letter for Dot and stealing £200 from Bradley, leaving in a black taxi on 7 August 2008. Character creation and development =Initial stint (1993–1998)= Clare as she appeared in 1994.Clare Tyler (later Bates) was introduced by the executive producer of EastEnders, Leonard Lewis. Gemma Bissix was cast in the role. Reflecting on the casting process in 2001, Bissix said, \\"I was nine when I started on EastEnders. I did drama classes after school and my mum took me to an audition. There were about 50 others. I read through the script and by the time I was home they had phoned my dad to tell him I had the role. I was only supposed to be in it for three episodes, but it turned into five years.\\" It was her first acting job and she had received no formal training. In 2008, Bissix stated, \\"that was my training [...] quite a lot of people [attend] drama school, I was trained by EastEnders.\\" The character made her first appearance in July 1993 as the daughter of Debbie Tyler (played by Nicola Duffett), a love interest for an EastEnders regular, Nigel Bates (played by Paul Bradley). Clare's introductory storyline focused upon domestic violence—her father Liam's physical abuse of her mother—and being caught between her feuding parents. Later storylines involved the death of her mother, who was killed in a hit-and-run accident in 1995, and a subsequent custody battle between her father and stepfather, which ultimately led to Nigel being given custody of Clare. After six years in the serial, the character was written out in 1998 as a result of Paul Bradley's decision to leave, reportedly for fear of being typecast in the role of Nigel the \\"nerd\\". The writers of EastEnders wanted to give Nigel a happy ending, so a character named Julie Haye (Karen Henthorn) was invented to be a love interest for Nigel, whilst her son, Josh Saunders (Jon Lee), was invented to be a love interest for Clare. In the storyline, Nigel fell for Julie, Clare's teacher, as they tried to sort out Clare's problematic behaviour at school. Simultaneously, Clare fell for Julie's son Josh, and when the storyline reached its climax in April 1998, the Bates family relocated to Scotland to begin a new life with Julie and Josh. Since her initial departure, actress Gemma Bissix has commented on her character's exit from the soap: “it was the right time for the character to go. Besides, when you get to 15 and haven't been able to cut your hair for six years, you want a change.” =Reintroduction (2008)= In September 2007, an official BBC press report announced that actress Gemma Bissix had agreed to reprise the role of Clare, ten years after her initial departure. Bissix was approached about returning by the executive producer of EastEnders, Diederick Santer, following her successful stint as soap villain Clare Devine in Channel 4's Hollyoaks. Commenting on her reintroduction, Bissix has said, \\"To be able to reprise the role of Clare, who I played when I was a child, is such a great compliment. It’s fantastic to grab something that once was and try and develop it into something different. I’m loving every minute.\\" Clare Bates made her reappearance on-screen on 1 February 2008 — in her first scene she was thrown out of the back of a car by her lover, the CEO of a big company. =Characterisation= Unlike the \\"cute, sweet\\" character she appeared to be during the 1990s, Clare was transformed into a \\"maneating bitch\\" upon her reintroduction in 2008; a gold digger, chasing after wealthy men for their money. Bissix has said, \\"Myself, Diederick [Santer] and [story producer] Dominic [Treadwell-Collins] had a characterisation session and we discussed what Clare's been doing and how she's got to where she is now. Her back story has played a big part in how I'm developing the character.\\" As part of the character's new look, Bissix was required to wear revealing clothing regularly. She has commented, \\"That is her character. She thinks she looks sexy and she reckons that's what it takes to get blokes on their knees. You can't blame her - it works for most.\\" Explaining the reasons for her character's personality change, Bissix said \\"I think it’s just the fact that she’s lonely. When she was in Scotland Nigel and Julie were getting on with their own thing. Through no fault of Nigel’s she just got pushed out of the family. She’s not his real child, her mum’s dead and her dad was in prison and is a bit of a wrong un. She went to university and was mistreated by a few men. Now she uses her looks to her advantage. Now she’s using the men and treating them badly...she's never felt settled. Her mother died, her father was abusive and she doesn't even know him. She's never felt like she's fitted in. Clare's 'mystery' is brought about by her looking for that father figure and needing that kind of attention, which then leads her into preying on the men of Walford. That's how she makes her money. Her forté is finding men with money and using her assets to entice them and rip them off...\\" Clare makes her return to EastEnders being thrown out of a car (2008). =Gold digging= The character's first return storyline concentrated on her attempt to seduce and then blackmail wealthy resident Ian Beale (played by Adam Woodyatt). An EastEnders insider said: \\"Ian has been completely blown away by Clare ever since she returned to the Square. She is a saucy little minx and will stop at nothing to get him into bed. But she’s not really interested in him – she just wants his money. So Ian is really playing with fire and risking his marriage just by being alone with Clare. But he’s more of a silly old fool than anything – although I’m not sure that Jane will see it like that, especially if she finds out about their kiss. And Clare being Clare, she probably will – unless of course Ian pays her to keep quiet.\\" However, in the storyline, Clare's games were eventually halted when Ian confessed to Jane and she ordered Clare to \\"Stay away from Ian!\\". According to Bissix, filming these scenes was particularly hard for Adam Woodyatt, who knew her well when she was only a child from her first stint in the soap: \\"Poor Adam. He spent a day staring at my chest for one scene, trying to get the fact that the last time he saw me I was 14 out of his head. He was a friend of Nigel so he was around all the time when I was first here and we'd done scenes together. Now, instead of this snotty-nosed little girl making Nigel's tea, she was trying to seduce him and get him in his Y-fronts.\\" Clare was later shown to develop an interest in Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements). In an interview with Digital Spy at the 2008 British Soap Awards, Bissix was asked about Clare's relationship with Bradley. She said, \\"[Their relationship] will be explored to a certain degree, but at the same time [...] it is Bradley at the end of the day, and unless he earns money, it's not going to get very far.\\" Other characters that Clare has tried to seduce for their wealth have included Bradley's father Max (Jake Wood), and her former sugar daddy, Arnold (Richard Lumsden) — a guest character who was introduced in a storyline that saw Clare steal all his wife's expensive jewellery. In May 2008, Bissix revealed that the \\"depths to Clare are going to start to be unraveled\\", which she welcomed as, in her words, she'd had \\"enough of [Clare's] maneating for a while.\\" =Departure (2008)= Despite Bissix stating early in May 2008 that she was going to be with EastEnders for \\"a while\\", it was announced a few weeks later on 23 May 2008 that she would be leaving EastEnders when her contract ended in the summer of 2008. Bissix has since revealed that she decided not to renew her contract. Bissix commented, \\"I've had a great time at EastEnders and I have loved having the chance to play Clare again. I'm looking forward to trying new things.\\" Press reports suggested that Clare would depart the soap after she was exposed as a \\"thoroughly nasty piece of work\\". A source told the press, \\"Clare has been toiling away, trying it on with all the affluent men of Walford including Bradley Branning, Jack Branning and even Ian Beale but what she had thought was a masterplan to bag the man of her dreams soon gets out of hand. She is forced to flee as it is clear she is not welcome in Albert Square anymore.\\" Despite Clare showing a more \\"vulnerable\\" side in the weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley discovered her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare \\"feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family\\". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the \\"softer side\\" to Clare that emerged: \\"she does genuinely care for [Bradley] [...] When he turns against her, it turns into a bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her in a bit of a state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [Clare] actually sits and tries to pray\\". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme \\"only really ever scratched the surface with [Clare]\\" and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, \\"This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation.\\" After one last \\"huge row\\" with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, \\"I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [coffin] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!\\" She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, \\"I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point.\\" In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, \\"but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see.\\" Reception The character's return in 2008, where Clare was thrown out of a car's rear door into the gutter, was called a \\"sensational entrance\\" by Daily Mirror critic, Tony Stewart, and \\"yet another reason to watch Enders again\\". He speculated that she would be \\"compulsive viewing\\", suggesting that there was \\"an air of desperate mystery\\" about her and added that the \\"sweet teenage schoolgirl has grown up to be a self-possessed and manipulative stunner who'll give the Mitchell sisters a run for their money. If Clare's just had a bumpy ride, then Walford should buckle up as she's about to return the favour!\\". According to a May 2008 article by Martin Smith, television critic for the Coventry Telegraph, the character of Clare Bates is one of only two reasons to watch EastEnders. He commented, \\"She's sassy, stylish, sexy and supremely manipulative - and far foxier than either of the Mitchell [sisters].\\" Though he continued that the character had been underused, saying \\"Unfortunately, for 'Enders, she's sidelined more often than Harry Kewell in a Champions League final. At least Hollyoaks knew her worth.\\" Clare dressed as Princess Leia (2008). The character's \\"scantily clad\\" attire has been commented on in the British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from the Daily Mirror suggesting that Gemma Bissix might \\"turn up in Albert Square starkers next\\". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like \\"a porno version\\" of the Star Wars character, \\"in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [allowed] her galactic orbs to bounce about\\". It has also been noted that the 2008 \\"minx\\" version of Clare Bates is similar to the character Clare Devine from the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks, whom Bissix played during a break from EastEnders between 2005 and 2007. Despite them being entirely different characters, it was suggested in The Herald that Gemma Bissix actually reprised the role between the two soaps. Bissix has acknowledged the comparison between the two characters, but maintains that they differ: \\"A lot of people ask me this. Clare Bates is a minx and dresses to impress, using her sexuality to get where she wanted [...] Clare Devine doesn't have the emotion Clare Bates does. Clare Devine kills people, she tells little children that they're the reason for their parents' death!\\" In reference to the character's brief dalliance with Christianity in 2008, TV critic for heat magazine, Julie Emery commented, \\"Stop right now, EastEnders. Please do not even try to make us believe that tarty, conniving Clare is about to find God, start wearing sensible floral frocks and run off to be a missionary in Africa [...] we ain't buying Clare realising the error of her ways and turning into a Bible basher. Anyway, we like her nasty bad-girl ways.\\"Emery, Julie (August, 2008). \\"heat magazine, p.131 Bissix was nominated in the \\"Best Bitch\\" category at the Inside Soap Awards in 2008, for her role as Clare Bates.\\"Soap storylines competing for award\\", The Press Association.

Sorin houses 143 undergraduate students. Its distinctive turret rooms on the four corners as well as its pure nobility distinguish it from all other campus buildings. Sorin Hall is, along with other buildings on the Main Quad of Notre Dame, on the National Register of Historic Places.https://secure.in.gov/apps/dnr/shaard/structural_surveys.html?_flowExecutionKey=_c8211B3C1-5A12-5149-C806-D81F4036E65B_k57E94178-9E4C-CCAD- FBDF-5D309D3D8FAE With . Map of district included with [text version available at National Park Service]. Sorin Hall was the first Notre Dame residential hall established as such, although St. Edward's Hall is housed in an older building.  History  Sorin Hall was the first dormitory built specifically to host students at the University of Notre Dame. Prior to 1888, every college student was housed in the Main Building, with open dormitory areas. During the early mid-1880s, the Holy Cross priests experimented with private rooms for upper classmen with high academic grades and the results were positive. Since the Main Building was overcrowded with students, Father Edward Sorin decided to build a freestanding dormitory to expand residential space for students and alleviate the housing shortage. It was the first of its kind among all Catholic universities and one of the first among colleges across the country. Sorin Hall ExteriorIt was designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, architect of the Main Building, Washington Hall (1881), and the Science Hall (1883 - today's LaFortune Student Center). His design has been described as a mixture of Gothic and Roman for a building that resembles a French chateau. Groundbreaking took place 18 March 1897 and the cornerstone was laid by Fr. Edward Sorin, CSC (founder of the University) on May 27, 1888, the fiftieth anniversary of his ordination as a priest. Originally intended to be called Collegiate Hall, when the cornerstone was uncovered for the ceremony, Father Sorin discovered that the dormitory was to be named in his honor.https://articles.latimes.com/1989-06-18/news/vw-3659_1_sorin-hall-notre- dame-post-office-knute- rocknehttp://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-04-03/travel/9404030363_1_notre- dame-four-horsemen-studentshttp://www.nd.edu/~otters/history.php Construction progressed throughout the fall of 1888 and the dorm opened its doors on New Year's Day of 1889. The 12 January 1889 issue of the Scholastic reported that \\"The house is replete with all the modern conveniences; and the rooms, fifty in number, are large enough to encourage study, and at the same time small enough to discourage visiting.” http://www.archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0022/VOL_0022_ISSUE_0019.pdf The fifty rooms were all singles. Space for the law department, founded in 1866, was situated on the south side of the first floor; classes had previously been taught in the Main Building. The basement hosted a smoking room and a reading room for the comfort of students.Rev. Andrew Morrissey, C.S.C. (1860-1921) was the dorm’s first rector. He would serve as the university’s eighth president from 1893 to 1905. The rector’s room was situated immediately north of the front door. Professor “Colonel” William Hoynes, chair of the law department and one of the early bachelor dons, was housed to the south of the front door. Two seminarians, who assisted Father Morrissey, also resided in the new building. The first rector of the new hall was Rev. Andrew Morrissey, C.S.C., who would serve as the university's eighth president from 1893 to 1905. He was assisted by two seminarians, also housed in the building. Professor “Colonel” William Hoynes, chair of the law department and one of the early bachelor dons, had his residence to the south of the front door.http://www.archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0022/VOL_0022_ISSUE_0018.pdf Sorin hall's chapel, dedicated to St. Thomas Aquinas, was built on the north side of the building. The structure as it exists today was completed in 1897 with the addition of two wings including the two turrets that currently distinguish it. Originally, the dorm did not have its now iconic front porch. In its early years, Sorin housed Notre Dame's law school and the dean of the law department, Prof. William Hoynes, resided in the building. He once happened to be the target of one of the numerous student pranks in the early 1900s who dumped buckets of water on people leaving the building. After the instance, he raised a fuss with university administration, hence a porch was built in April 1905 to avoid any such further instance. Since then, the porch thus became one of the iconic features of the dorm. Sorin Hall with its iconic porch During the Vietnam War, the men who resided in this dorm briefly decided to break away from the University of Notre Dame. Students and professors held classes in the dorm and boycotted University events. They hung a wooden sign above the porch, declaring the dorm \\"Sorin College.\\" The sign remains to this day and Secession Week, one of Sorin's three signature events, is an ongoing commemoration of this brief rebellion. In 1988, Sorin Hall celebrated its 100th anniversary as a Notre Dame residence hall. Notable former residents include former coaches Knute Rockne, Moose Krause, and player George Gipp. All four of the famed Four Horsemen of Notre Dame ( Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden) lived in Sorin Hall for at least one year during their college careers. Former university president Fr. Edward Malloy, C.S.C., currently resides in the hall.  Traditions  =Fr. Sorin's statue= With its long history on Notre Dame's campus came a number of notable and unique traditions. The dorm's mascot is the Otter. Upon graduation, seniors carve their initials into the brick on the front porch. The statue and portrait of Fr. Sorin at the Entrance A bronze statue of Fr. Sorin resides in the front hallway. It is a replica of the large statue that was dedicated on the Main Quad on 3 May 1906. Sorin residents rub his feet for good luck when they pass by it.https://sports.yahoo.com/news/ncaaf--at-notre- dame--campus-life-differs-little-for-student-and-football-star-151519405.html The statue has been the target of a number of Sorin resident pranks – it frequently disappeared for short periods of time. In January 1953, the statue had gone missing just before the Christmas break and that the Student Senate resolved to find the statue. “Although traditionally a wanderer on the ND campus, Father Sorin’s present disappearance has lasted so long that concern is arising that it may be a permanent one” [Scholastic issue 01/16/1953, page 13]. Shortly thereafter, postcards and letters began coming in from the statue from destinations far and wide. In some, that statue of Sorin claimed to have attended some of the year's most important events such as Dwight Eisenhower's Inauguration, Queen Elizabeth II's Coronation, and Josef Stalin's funeral. The mystery persisted, until just before Commencement 1953, the statue arrived at Main Circle in a cab surrounded by a cheering crowd. It turned out that Alumnus Camillus Witzieben had found the statue in the snow, and instead of returning the statue to Sorin Hall, Witzieben and friend August Manier decided to bury the statue in a sand trap on the Golf Course and later moved it to a house in Chicago until its triumphant return. In the meantime, their military friends sent the postcards from a variety of destinations around the world. In 1955, Sorin's once again wandered, and was brought was to the Kentucky Derby. He sent a telegram to Notre Dame saying “that he ‘lost it all on Nashua’ and was ‘returning home’ that night at 8 o’clock.” The statue returned once again by car to Main Circle.http://www.archives.nd.edu/about/news/index.php/2013/traveling-father- sorin-statue/#.V-tBVPArLIU While the statue probably never went further than a Chicago basement, the fabled journeys of Fr. Sorin became fabled around campus: “I’d heard stories of seniors who took the statue around the world with them and sent back pictures of Sorin posed beside European landmarks, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Tower of London. I’d heard he’d even had an audience with the Pope, and that he’d returned of the back of an elephant,” said alumnus Pat Williams, Class of 1963, in a 1984 Notre Dame Magazine article. Sorin's return during Homecoming Weekend in 1962 was the most elaborate of all: dangling from a helicopter and met by Sorinites in togas and chariots.http://www.archives.nd.edu/about/news/index.php/2013/traveling- father-sorin-statue/#.V-tBVPArLIU Eventually, it was one taken by a student after graduation in 1966. When a priest of the Congregation, Father Burtachell, learned of its whereabouts, the statue was returned to campus in 1972 under the priest's direct supervision. When the hall was renovated in 1983, Burtachell returned the statue to Sorin Hall under better security. The hollow statue was filled with concrete and connected to a base with steel rods, which were in turn soldered to the floor in the main entrance. =Other traditions= Sorin College, led by president Aidan McKiernan and vice president Tristan Hunt, began boycotting Notre Dame pep rallies in the fall of 2008.http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/news/sorin-announces-they-will-boycott-pep- rallies-1.257656#.UABNoVGwnq8 The Otters stated that this was in protest of changes to the rally format brought on by commercialization and a desire to include alumni in what was once mainly a student activity. Instead of attending the rally, the Otters would wait outside and cheer the team as it went in. Sorin does not have any natural rivals among the men's residence halls on campus, due to its location and tradition of independence. In contrast to other men's dorms, with their chants of \\"[men's dorm] loves [women's dorm]\\" Otters chant \\"Sorin loves Sorin.\\" Sorin is the only dormitory on campus to have its own walking tour, highlighting many of the historically interesting rooms and areas that throughout the course of its history have either been the home to important Notre Dame individuals, as with room 011, the \\"Captain's Corner\\", or institutions, as with the first floor wing that at one time housed Notre Dame Law School. Additionally, Sorin is the only dorm to boast its own boxing practice room. Many Otters participate in Bengal Bouts, the University boxing program that raises money for Notre Dame charities in Bangladesh.  Current rector  Father Bob Loughery, C.S.C., holds a bachelor's degree in Architecture and a Master of Divinity degree, both from the University of Notre Dame. He returns to his alma mater after 21 years of pastoral experience and direct service to the poor. Most recently, he served as pastor of St. Vincent de Paul Parish in downtown Portland, OR. He has also served as Director of Andre House of Hospitality in Oakland, CA; Director of the Campus Ministry Center at California State University, East Bay; and as a co-facilitator for Holy Cross Associates in both Portland, OR, and Berkeley, CA. Father Bob is originally from Indianapolis, IN. He was ordained a priest in the Congregation of Holy Cross in 1989.http://osa.nd.edu/residential- life/residence-halls/sorin-hall/ While an undergraduate at Notre Dame, Father Bob lived in the Sorin College Otter Room.

As one of the founder members of the Folk-Song Society and Editor of the Folk Song Journal, she was one of the main influences of the English folk revival of that period. She was an accomplished singer, composer, piano accompanist, and amateur poet. She was much sought after as a song and choral singing adjudicator at music festivals throughout England, and was also one of the founders of the Leith Hill Music Festival in Surrey.

She was the youngest of eleven children (two boys and nine girls).Mould (2004); de Val (2004). Henry's mother was of Scottish descent and from her he had learnt the ballad \\"The wee little croodin' doo\\", which he would sing to the young Lucy. She recalled later: \\"The first musical impression that I ever remember came from this song, sung by my father as I sat astride his knee when little more than two years old and in our Tweedale home.\\"Bassin (1969), 150-1; Campbell (2007), 219. For a number of years the family maintained a home in London, where the Broadwood piano manufacturing factory was situated. In 1864, however, following the death of Lucy's uncle the Rev. John Broadwood (17981864) the family moved to Lyne House, in the parish of Capel in Surrey, just across the county border from the Sussex village of Rusper. =Sussex Songs= John Broadwood, her uncle, had been responsible in 1847 for self-publishing what is now recognised as the first true collection of English folk songs (comprising both words and music as collected from \\"rustics\\" in Surrey and Sussex). Other works had appeared before, but none married actual words and music as collected together. The work, which is more commonly known today by the shortened title Old English Songs, comprised a small number of songs which Broadwood had personally collected and noted down, and which were provided with arrangements by W.A. Dusart, an organist from Worthing, a few years before publication. Lucy was inspired by his example when she learnt of it around 1870 (several years after his death).Gregory (2008), 373.

Birch Reynardson, Lucy's cousin, under the title of Sussex Songs. It was produced with her assistance, and also contained an additional sixteen songs that she had collected. (It now appears that at least one of these was collected by her father, Henry Fowler Broadwood.) The publication sold for 2/6d. It is notable that, although Lucy had worked on it, her name is not credited in its contents. =English County Songs and English Traditional Carols and Songs= Lucy was also heavily involved in the early music movement, and in editing Purcell works, and was a member of the Purcell Society. Through this association she was to become acquainted with, and was also distantly related, by the marriage of one of her cousins, to J.A. Fuller Maitland (1856–1936), a music critic and musician. Her friendship and collaboration with him was to last for the rest of her life. As a result of her work on Sussex Songs she was invited to collaborate with him on preparation of what was to become one of a number of influential folksong publications in the late 1880s/early 1890s. This was English County Songs, and this time Lucy was fully credited as joint editor of the work. The song arrangements were provided by both herself and Fuller Maitland. The book was published to much acclaim in the summer of 1893, and is a milestone in English folksong studies. In the words of Ralph Vaughan Williams:Vaughan Williams (2008), 258. \\"This may be said to be the starting point of the modern folk song movement\\". Shortly after the book's publication, her father died and she and her mother moved to a flat in London in 1894. Following her mother's death Lucy was to continue to live in a succession of London flats until her death in 1929. In 1906 she contributed an appendix entitled \\"English Airs and Motifs in Jamaica\\" to the book Jamaican Song and Story by Walter Jekyll.Her other principal publication was English Traditional Carols and Songs which was published in 1908. On this occasion all of the song arrangements were her own, and all of the songs had been collected by her. (In the previous publication, English County Songs the majority of songs were actually gleaned from earlier publications, or had been submitted to the editors by other collectors). An important source was the Horsham shoemaker Henry Burstow, from whom she had collected many songs, the first on 2 May 1892.Gregory (2008), 392-3. =Folk- Song Society= As a result of the success of a number of folksong publications (including English County Songs) in the late 1880s and early 1890s, moves were made to found the Folk-Song Society, and at its inaugural meeting in 1898, Lucy was elected to the committee, together with Fuller Maitland. In 1904 she was to become the Honorary Secretary, following the illness and subsequent death of her predecessor in the post, Kate Lee, and her diary records that she held a meeting with Cecil Sharp and Ralph Vaughan Williams to plan for the resurrection of the Society and \\"fan its dying embers\\". Their work was evidently successful as the Society was to continue in existence until its amalgamation with the English Folk Dance Society in 1932, which gave rise to the English Folk Dance and Song Society, which exists to this day. Lucy also took on the mantle of Editor of the Folk Song Journal at this time. Although her Secretaryship of the Society was to last for only a short while, she retained her post as editor of the Journal (with the exception of a very short period of relinquishment) until her resignation from the work in 1926. Her work as Editor, and her research scholarship were recognised internationally, and, in his subsequent obituary of her, Vaughan Williams (amongst others) noted that it was principally her work which had ensured the existence and revival of the Society. During her song collecting career Lucy was to collect songs from many areas - for example, from her home area of Surrey/Sussex; from Hertfordshire (where members of her family lived); from Arisaig in summer 1906 and again in summer 1907, when, inspired by Percy Grainger, she used a phonograph to collect Gaelic songs;Bassin (1965); de Val (2000), 355-6. from Peebles in 1907;See Campbell (2007). from Lincolnshire (where she collected jointly with Grainger in 1906);de Val (2004), 355-6. and from Devon (where she undertook a collecting trip with Sabine Baring-Gould in 1893).de Val (2000), 349. In 1929 she was elected President of the Society, but was only to hold this position for less than 12 months, as she died unexpectedly and suddenly on 22 August 1929 at the age of 71 in Dropmore, Kent, where she was visiting relatives in order to attend an arts festival in Canterbury. =Other activities= In addition to her work as a folksong collector and researcher, Lucy was also a performer who gave many recitals from the concert platform of both classical works, and folksongs; an accomplished accompanist, working with both professional singers and amateurs;and a composer in her own right, having had a number of works published in her early 20s, as well as acting as an editor for works by Purcell, and as translator of works by Bach and Schütz. She was also a poet (although perhaps not a particularly notable one). Legacy She was buried in the churchyard at Rusper, and the family commissioned an alabaster plaque from Thomas Clapperton, which is situated on the wall just inside the entrance door of the church. On 1 May each year, the Broadwood Morris men, named after her, dance inside the church, and hang a wreath on the plaque in her honour. To celebrate the deposit of Lucy Broadwood's diaries in January 2000, archivists at Surrey History Centre prepared an exhibition of her songs, diaries and papers which aimed to reveal some of the many facets of Lucy's life and personality in her own words and those of her friends.

It was the home ground of Wigan Athletic F.C. until the club moved to the new JJB Stadium (now DW Stadium) after the 1998–99 season. At its largest, the stadium held 40,000. In its 102-year existence the ground only saw 32 years as a Football League venue, 11 years for Wigan Borough F.C. and 21 years for Wigan Athletic FC, before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate in 1999. The stadium had previously been home to Wigan County, Wigan United, Wigan Town, and Wigan Borough (previously Wigan United and Wigan Association) as well as Wigan and Springfield Borough rugby league sides. It was also used for horse trotting, as a track cycling velodrome, for wrestling and for athletics. Springfield Park was designed by architect Richardson Thomas Johnson and built in 1897 at a cost of £16,000. It was owned by The Wigan Trotting and Athletic Grounds Company Ltd. The first professional football match at the stadium took place in September 1897 when Wigan County played Burton Swifts in a friendly match.Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, Dean Hayes. Association Football =History= Wigan County were the first team to play at Springfield Park. Their greatest event was a 1–0 loss at the hands of Manchester City before their liquidation and extinction three years after their 1897 formation. Wigan United took the lease at Springfield Park in 1901, competing for two seasons in the Lancashire League. After being drawn away to Stalybridge Rovers in the third round of the Rawcliffe Cup, they declined to play due to a waterlogged pitch. However, the referee ruled otherwise, leaving Stalybridge to kick off, dribble and place the ball into the net.Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, Dean Hayes. Wigan Town was the third attempt to establish football in Wigan in 1905, but it too failed to survive for more than three years. After a period of inactivity at Springfield Park due to the First World War, Wigan United beat Fleetwood 2–0 on 6 September 1919 in the West Lancs League. This was the first official game after the war and would lead to the club taking the lease for the ground on 2 December 1919 for the rest of the season. United eventually became Wigan Borough F.C. in 1920 and became one of the founder members of the Football League Third Division North. They won their first game, against Nelson, 2–1 in front of 9,000 spectators. The club's best performance was in 1928–29 when they reached the Third round of the FA Cup. This was to be the largest attendance ever recorded at Springfield Park, with 30,443 spectators watching a 3–1 loss to Sheffield Wednesday. Wigan Borough resigned from the football league during the 1931–32 season. Shortly after Borough went out of business, a new club, Wigan Athletic F.C., was formed and continued to play their home games at Springfield Park. After lengthy negotiations, Wigan Athletic purchased the ground from the owner of Woodhouse Lane Stadium for £2,800 with the proviso that greyhound racing never take place at Springfield Park.Wigan Athletic AFC - An A–Z, Dean Hayes. During the 1952–53 season, the main stand was razed to the ground by fire, resulting in major fundraising efforts for the construction of a new stand. The following season, a record crowd of 27,526 watched Wigan Athletic beat Hereford United 4–1. To this day, it is the largest attendance ever recorded between two non-league clubs excluding Wembley finals.WAFC.co.uk - club honours 19 October 1966 marked the first floodlit match at Springfield Park, when Wigan Athletic played Crewe Alexandra. This was a full year before floodlights were installed at Central Park. In October 1978, Zambia –coached by Brian Tiler, himself an ex-Latics manager– became the first national team to play at Springfield Park. Wigan won the game 2–1. Wigan Athletic F.C. moved to the new JJB Stadium after the 1999 season. The final competitive goal to be scored at the stadium was by Manchester City's Paul Dickov. =Attendances= Wigan Borough =Football League= # Stockport County, 1 April 1929.

Gelsolin is one of the most potent members of the actin-severing gelsolin/villin superfamily, as it severs with nearly 100% efficiency. Cellular gelsolin, found within the cytosol and mitochondria, has a closely related secreted form, Plasma gelsolin, that contains an additional 24 AA N-terminal extension. Plasma gelsolin's ability to sever actin filaments helps the body recover from disease and injury that leaks cellular actin into the blood. Additionally it plays important roles in host innate immunity, activating macrophages and localizing of inflammation.  Structure  Gelsolin is an 82-kD protein with six homologous subdomains, referred to as S1-S6. Each subdomain is composed of a five-stranded β-sheet, flanked by two α-helices, one positioned perpendicular with respect to the strands and one positioned parallel. The β-sheets of the three N-terminal subdomains (S1-S3) join to form an extended β-sheet, as do the β-sheets of the C-terminal subdomains (S4-S6).  Regulation  Among the lipid-binding actin regulatory proteins, gelsolin (like cofilin) preferentially binds polyphosphoinositide (PPI). The binding sequences in gelsolin closely resemble the motifs in the other PPI-binding proteins. Gelsolin's activity is stimulated by calcium ions (Ca2+). Although the protein retains its overall structural integrity in both activated and deactivated states, the S6 helical tail moves like a latch depending on the concentration of calcium ions. The C-terminal end detects the calcium concentration within the cell. When there is no Ca2+ present, the tail of S6 shields the actin-binding sites on one of S2's helices. When a calcium ion attaches to the S6 tail, however, it straightens, exposing the S2 actin- binding sites. The N-terminal is directly involved in the severing of actin. S2 and S3 bind to the actin before the binding of S1 severs actin-actin bonds and caps the barbed end. Gelsolin can be inhibited by a local rise in the concentration of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2), a PPI. This is a two step process. Firstly, (PIP2) binds to S2 and S3, inhibiting gelsolin from actin side binding. Then, (PIP2) binds to gelsolin’s S1, preventing gelsolin from severing actin, although (PIP2) does not bind directly to gelsolin's actin-binding site. Gelsolin's severing of actin, in contrast to the severing of microtubules by katanin, does not require any extra energy input. Cellular function As an important actin regulator, gelsolin plays a role in podosome formation (along with Arp3, cortactin, and Rho GTPases). Gelsolin also inhibits apoptosis by stabilizing the mitochondria. Prior to cell death, mitochondria normally lose membrane potential and become more permeable. Gelsolin can impede the release of cytochrome C, obstructing the signal amplification that would have led to apoptosis. Actin can be cross- linked into a gel by actin cross-linking proteins. Gelsolin can turn this gel into a sol, hence the name gelsolin.  Animal studies  Research in mice suggests that gelsolin, like other actin-severing proteins, is not expressed to a significant degree until after the early embryonic stage—approximately 2 weeks in murine embryos. In adult specimens, however, gelsolin is particularly important in motile cells, such as blood platelets. Mice with null gelsolin- coding genes undergo normal embryonic development, but the deformation of their blood platelets reduced their motility, resulting in a slower response to wound healing. An insufficiency of gelsolin in mice has also been shown to cause increased permeability of the vascular pulmonary barrier, suggesting that gelsolin is important in the response to lung injury.  Related proteins  Sequence comparisons indicate an evolutionary relationship between gelsolin, villin, fragmin and severin. Six large repeating segments occur in gelsolin and villin, and 3 similar segments in severin and fragmin. While the multiple repeats have yet to be related to any known function of the actin- severing proteins, the superfamily appears to have evolved from an ancestral sequence of 120 to 130 amino acid residues.  Interactions  Gelsolin is a cytoplasmic, calcium-regulated, actin-modulating protein that binds to the barbed ends of actin filaments, preventing monomer exchange (end-blocking or capping). It can promote nucleation (the assembly of monomers into filaments), as well as sever existing filaments. In addition, this protein binds with high affinity to fibronectin. Plasma gelsolin and cytoplasmic gelsolin are derived from a single gene by alternate initiation sites and differential splicing. Gelsolin has been shown to interact with: * Amyloid precursor protein, * Androgen receptor, * PTK2B, and * VDAC1.

The Village Maud features an old railway station,Maud Railway Station Museum which closed to passengers in 1965. When the railway was active, Maud was where the railway line from Aberdeen split before heading to Fraserburgh and Peterhead. Walks can be taken along the old railway lines which now form part of the Formartine and Buchan Way; the railway tracks were removed following the ending of freight trains in 1979. There was a mart or livestock market until recently, selling local livestock. There is also a hospital for the elderly, which was formerly a poorhouse that opened in about 1868. A modern complex in the centre of the village houses a cafe, community centre, gym and other facilities; the old town hall, a few minutes walk from the new complex, is also still in regular use by community groups. The village also has a small parade of shops. The hamlet of Kirkhill Pendicle to the south of Maud has a weather station which features prominently in Met Office weather maps for Aberdeenshire. History The local area to the immediate south is rich with prehistory and historical features. There are found a number of prehistoric monuments including Catto Long Barrow,C.

Early life Tyler was born in County Cavan, Irelandhttp://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/trafalgarancestors/details_print.asp?id=17263https://archive.org/stream/sircharlestylerg00wynd/sircharlestylerg00wynd_djvu.txt in 1760, the son of Captain Peter Tyler of the Oxfordshire Light Infantry and his wife the Hon. Anna Maria Roper, daughter of Henry Roper, 8th Baron Teynham. His father died when he was three years old. In 1771, at eleven years of age, he joined the Royal Navy aboard under Captain Andrew Snape Hamond as a Captain's servant boy. His rapid promotion to the rank of midshipsman within his second year at sea suggest the captain favored him and may have known his family.https://archive.org/stream/sircharlestylerg00wynd/sircharlestylerg00wynd_djvu.txthttp://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/trafalgarancestors/details_print.asp?id=17263 He rose steadily through the ranks during the American Revolutionary War, although during that period he had little opportunity to distinguish himself. In 1779 he was promoted to lieutenant,5 April 1779 jumping to commander in 178231 December 1782 and retaining his position throughout the peacetime Navy of 1783 to 1790, when he was made post-captain.21 September 1790 French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars Upon the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Tyler was in command of the frigate during the siege of Toulon and the invasion of Corsica the following year. He first met Nelson in the course of these campaigns, and was present when the latter lost an eye at the Siege of Calvi. Transferring to soon afterwards, he was present at Lord Hotham's disappointing Battle of Genoa and then spent the next several years operating against North African pirates in the frigate Aigle before she was accidentally wrecked on Plane Island. Returning to the fleet, Tyler was acquitted of blame for the loss of his ship and was given the ship of the line which he commanded off Cadiz before returning to England and participating under Admiral Nelson at the Battle of Copenhagen where he was commended for his actions. During the Peace of Amiens Tyler was returned to shore as commander of a unit of Sea Fencibles, but in 1803 was back at sea, commanding the 80-gun , which Nelson had captured at the battle of the Nile. Tonnant was a large, modern ship with a heavy payload, capable of taking on the largest enemy ships. Tyler carefully drilled his crew until Tonnant was amongst the most efficient and powerful ships in the fleet. Tyler was specially requested by Nelson for the Cadiz blockade in 1805, and thus participated in the Battle of Trafalgar, although not before he was forced to travel to Naples where his son was under arrest for desertion from the navy (out of love for a ballerina) and crippling debts. Unknown to Tyler until much later was the fact that Nelson personally paid the young man's debt and used his influence to have him released and reinstated into the Navy albeit with a stern warning about responsibilities. =Trafalgar= At Trafalgar, Tyler was originally second in line from Collingwood's flagship , but due to its speed was swapped to third in line. Because of this forward positioning the ship was quickly and intensely engaged in the battle. Tonnant first forced the Spanish Monarca to surrender (although she later attempted to escape) before colliding with the Algésiras which soon became hopelessly entangled in the British ship's rigging. This resulted in a savage series of close-range bombardments and boarding actions during which Tyler was shot in the thigh and French Admiral Magon was killed. Once the Algésiras finally surrendered, the Tonnant although badly battered, was still able to attack and capture the San Juan Nepomuceno at the close of the battle. Struggling back to Gibraltar with over 70 casualties on board, including Tyler himself, the Tonnant relied heavily on other ships for aid, and thus was unable to prevent the Algésiras from escaping to Cadiz Harbour after her crew rose up against the prize crew, although the San Juan Nepomuceno did arrive at Gibraltar thanks to heroic efforts by her Spanish crew and British prize crew. Briefly returning to London to celebrate and recover, Tyler received the thanks of Parliament and numerous awards from the nation before returning to his ship in the Mediterranean, where he continued to serve, overseeing the surrender of the Russian fleet at Lisbon in 1808. Later career Tyler's continued service brought more honours, including command of the Cape of Good Hope Station based in Cape Town in 1812, a role which was followed by post-war promotion to rear admiral.Rear Admiral of the Blue 28 April 1808, of the Red 31 July 1810 In April 1816 he was initiated into the Order of the Bath.KCB 20 April 1816 He was named Vice Admiral.Vice Admiral of the Blue 4 December 1813, of the White 4 June 1814, of the Red 19 July 1821 Following his elevation to admiral he did not hold any more sea postings, retiring and reaching full AdmiralAdmiral of the Blue 27 May 1825, of the White 22 July 1830 of the White and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the BathGCB 1 May 1833 by his death in September 1835 in Gloucester, just two months after the death of his wife of many years, Margaret. They were buried together in the St Nicholas Church in Glamorgan where a marble monument still can be seen to their memory. Family He married two times. His first wife was Anne Rice with whom he had three children. She died early into the marriage leaving him as a young widow. He remarried and his second wife was Margaret Leach with whom he had three children. From this marriage one of his sons called George Tyler followed him into the navy and rose to the rank of Vice-Admiral. It later emerged that Admiral Nelson had cleared debt for the George Tyler while he was a junior officer with a strong reprimand shortly before the Battle of Trafalgar. George settled down and got married and through this marriage his daughter Caroline Tyler was born. She married the Earl of Dunraven and Mount Earl and the couple inherited Adare Manor in Ireland. Her son Colonel Windham Wyndham-Quin wrote the biography on his famous great-grandfather titled 'Sir Charles Tyler - Admiral of the White'. In 2005 the family sold Admiral Tyler's sword at Bonham's auction house for $430,000.

It has been described as the largest collegiate chapel in the United States and the second largest collegiate chapel in the world. Because judgments about the relative size of such buildings can be difficult, other universities have made similar claims (e.g., Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Duke Chapel, Stanford Memorial Church). Primarily used to facilitate many Lutheran campus worship services, the Chapel of the Resurrection also serves as a site for convocations, musical performances, guest lectures, and commencement ceremonies. The chapel's chancel is high and is circular in shape; the roof of the apse is shaped like a nine-pointed star. The nave is high and long. The building capacity is around 2000, although this number is flexible depending upon the configuration of the chairs, which recently replaced the pews. To the southwest of the Chapel lies the Brandt Campanile, a 12-bell tower rising tall. Clearly visible from U.S. Route 30 and throughout the surrounding community, the building is located on the highest point of ground on the Valparaiso University campus and is a Northwest Indiana landmark. History 250 px Groundbreaking for the Chapel construction took place in 1956. The building was designed by the architectural firm Charles Stade and Associates of Park Ridge, Illinois, though certain elements and features (e.g., the stone baptistry, the stained glass windows, etc.) were designed by other artists. Peter Dohmen Studios of St. Paul, Minnesota designed the high stained glass windows, as well as the marble interzia altar, and the mosaic at the entrance of the chapel. Adalbert Raphael Kretzmann, pastor and brother of Valparaiso University president O. P. Kretzmann, joined Charles Stade in the building's design. The altar is long, made of various types of Italian marble. Peter Dohmen designed the inlaid marble pedestals to depict, with symbols, the four evangelists. Matthew is represented by an angel, Mark by a lion, John by an eagle, and Luke by an ox. Peter Dohmen learned his skills at the top art academies of Europe. He became a well-known artist in Germany during the 1930s, executing major art works, such as stained glass windows, frescos on major public buildings, mosaics, etc. During the early 1940s he was blackballed by the government because of his outspoken opposition of the Nazi party. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 1951 and continued his artistic trade with great success. Amongst some of his major works are the stained glass windows in the library of the University of Notre Dame. Total construction costs of the chapel were about $7.5 million, much of which came through individual donations. The building was dedicated in 1959, part of Valparaiso University's centennial celebration, and officially designated as the Chapel of the Resurrection at the 10th anniversary service in 1969. In July and August 2005, the university built a medieval-style prayer labyrinth on the east side of the Chapel, 64 feet in diameter. The university is adding to the building in 2014, known as the Helge Center. Organ The Reddel Organ in the Chapel was built by organ builder Herman Schlicker of Buffalo, New York. A contract for the organ was signed on September 27, 1957 at a cost of $68,000. These funds paid for about three-quarters of the entire specification, the price of which would have been $98,000. Paul Bunjes of Concordia College, River Forest, Illinois, was retained as consultant. The instrument was dedicated at the morning Eucharist on September 27, 1959, and was featured that evening in a recital by E. Power Biggs to a record audience of over 2,000 people. It was rebuilt and enlarged in 1995-1996 by Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa.

The mall is managed by Simon Property Group. The mall has a gross leasable area of . The mall is anchored by Boscov's, JCPenney, and Macy's. There is also a vacant space from Sears that plans to be redeveloped. It also contains several eateries, and a small food court. The Ocean County Mall is the only enclosed mall in Ocean County. It is a popular destination for tourists in the Toms River area during the summer season. History In the 1970s, the Toms River area, although growing quickly, was still relatively rural. The closest malls were the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, and the Shore Mall in Egg Harbor. With the growing need for an enclosed mall, the mall was originally planned to be at the intersection of Route 37 and the Garden State Parkway. However, the mall opened in July 1976 at its current location at Hooper Avenue and Bay Avenue, with 3 anchors (Sears, JCPenney and Bamberger's, now Macy's) and a cinema (General Cinema). In 1988, a small expansion was built which included a Stern's. When the chain went out of business, it was turned into Boscov's. Around the same time, the General Cinema quietly closed down due to competition from the AMC-Loews across the street at Seacourt Pavilion. The Cinema's main mall entrance near Applebee's was sealed off for years, while the small side hallway near Sears remained locked and dark. In 2003, the mall received a complete renovation, which added new signage, flooring, lighting, seating areas, and lighting in the parking lot. The renovation was partially sponsored by the Deborah Heart and Lung Center, which donated seating & lounge areas, in part to encourage mall walking. To accommodate, there is a stretch of discolored tile around the perimeter of the mall with numbers engraved marking walking distance.

The star was discovered to have a rapid rotation, roughly once every nine days. Though there are no extrasolar planets confirmed to be orbiting the star, Kappa1 Ceti is considered a good candidate to contain terrestrial planets (like the Earth). The system is a candidate binary star, but has not been confirmed. The star should not be confused with the star , which is ten times as distant.  Stellar components  Kappa1 Ceti is a yellow dwarf star of the spectral type G5Ve. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified. The star has roughly the same mass as the Sun, with 95% of the Sun's radius but only 85 percent of the luminosity. It is unclear whether the star is equal or is more enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen, but it is determined that the star has between 98 and 240 percent of the Sun's abundance of iron. Kappa1 Ceti is much younger than the Sun, and may only be around 800 million years old. The rapid rotation rate of this star, approximately once every nine days, is indicative of a relatively youthful body several hundred million years in age. Due to starspots, the star varies slightly over the approximately the same period. The variations in period are thought to be caused by differential rotation at various latitudes, similar to what happens on the surface of the Sun. The star spots on Kappa1 Ceti range in latitude from 10° to 75° The magnetic properties of this star make it \\"an excellent match for the Sun at a key point in the Earth's past\\". According to recent hypotheses, unusually intense stellar flares from a solar twin star could be caused by the interaction of the magnetic field of a giant planet in tight orbit with that star's own magnetic field. Some Sun-like stars of spectral class F8 to G8 have been found to undergo enormous magnetic outbursts to produce so-called superflares (coronal mass ejections) that release between 100 and 10 million times more energy than the largest flares ever observed on the sun, making them brighten briefly by up to 20 times. In 1998, nine Solar twin stars (including Kappa1 Ceti) were observed to have produced superflares, on average, about once per century. None of these stars rotate particularly fast, have close binary companions, or are very young. Previously, such large flares had not been observed in solar- type main sequence stars, although they are common in a group of dim main- sequence, reddish M dwarfs known as flare stars. The space velocity components of this star are = . It is not known to be a member of a moving group of stars.  Possible planetary system  Using the radial velocity technique, the search for substellar companions has thus far failed to find a brown dwarf or extrasolar planet in the \\"hot zone\\" orbit around Kappa1 Ceti. Given the regular eruption of superflares, however, it is unlikely that Earth-type life could survive for long on any inner terrestrial planet. The distance from the star where an Earth-type planet (with liquid water) would be stable is centered on 0.92 astronomical units from the star (between the orbital distances of Earth and Venus in the Solar system). At this distance, such a planet would have an orbital period of almost 324 days.

He is married and has two sons (born in February 2004 and in August 2006). He was a member of Alpha Tau Omega fraternity while in college at Houston Baptist University for a trimester. Career Segal is a \\"shock jock\\", who is fond of toilet humor, gross-out jokes, and oddball stunts, which have comprised a large portion of material on his show, in addition to discussing current events, entertainment, politics, sports, and crime stories. His trademark is a loud, maniacal laugh. He frequently uses catchphrases, each with its own colorful origins, such as \\"Smell My Face!\\" and \\"Smell It Good\\". Segal is also involved with many local charities including 'Olie & Elliot's Great Saves' with former Washington Capitals goalie, Olaf Kölzig, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Controversy =FCC fine for Bishop O'Connell High School incident= During the May 7, 2002 Elliot in the Morning show, two sixteen-year-old female students at Bishop Denis J. O'Connell High School called the show to be considered in a contest whose winners were to be cage dancers at an upcoming Kid Rock concert at George Mason University's Patriot Center. Goaded by Segal, they discussed alleged sexual activity at school. The students, who claimed to be eighteen, discussed giving oral sex to lines of boys in the hallway and having intercourse in stairwells and closets. They implied these acts occurred during a typical school day. The students, who had used false names on air, were suspended the same day for their comments. The principal addressed the student body on the PA system and discussed the immorality of Segal's radio show. Angered by the students' suspension, Segal personally insulted the principal on air the following day, making lewd remarks about his family and his sexual activity. He also mocked the school's mission statement, specifically what he considered to be a hypocritical statement that their educational environment is \\"rooted in the life of Christ.\\" The two days of broadcasting were ruled indecent by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

Leilani Marietta (O'Malley) Muir (July 15, 1944 – March 14, 2016), previously named Leilani Marie Scorah, was the first person to file a successful lawsuit against the Alberta government for wrongful sterilization under the Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta. Her case led to the initiation of several other class action lawsuits against the province for wrongful sterilization. Muir's advocacy shed light on eugenics, institutionalisation, human rights for persons with a disability, and self-advocacy.  Early life  Muir was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada into a poor family that frequently moved. She was an unwanted, unloved, and abused child.Wahlsten, 1997, p. 193 Her mother looked for ways to remove her from the family and, when Muir was eight, placed her in the Midnapore Convent for a month. Then, in 1953, her mother sent an application for Muir to be institutionalized at the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives (also known as the Michener Centre) in Red Deer, Alberta.Wahlsten, p. 193 At that time there were no vacant beds. Two years later on July 12, 1955, shortly before her 11th birthday, Muir was admitted into the institution solely on the basis of information provided by her mother, without any diagnostic testing. She thought she had been sent to an orphanage.Buchanan, 1997 Under superintendent Leonard Jan Le Vann, a precondition for admission into the Provincial Training School was a signature from Muir's mother permitting the legal enforcement of compulsory sterilization.Wahlsten, p. 193 Over the years, Muir was educated to a grade 5 level and saw her mother only intermittently until her departure from the institution at the age of 20.  Background on eugenics  Muir’s sterilization was part of a progression towards forced sterilization and eugenics that began in the 19th century. In 1883, Francis Galton, a cousin of Charles Darwin, coined the term eugenics,Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 but the concept had been around since the time of Plato. In essence, eugenics is a combination of Mendel's laws of genetics and Darwin’s theory of evolution.Wahlsten, 1997 It was believed that many mental and behavioral traits were passed down from parents to their children. People considered inferior or damaging to the human race included: mental defectives (i.e., persons with a developmental disability or mental disorder), criminals, psychotics, lazy people, social degenerates, mixed races (African-Caucasian, etc.), immigrants and First Nations people,Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 Catholics, alcoholics, epileptics, unwed mothers, poor people, and others. These \\"undesirables\\"Buchanan, 1997 were seen as unfit to have children and were bred out of the population through sterilization practices.Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, p. 358 Eugenics has been attempted in many countries in many ways, including practicing sterilization, castration, and homicide on \\"defective\\" persons. An active eugenics movement occurred in the United Kingdom in the 19th century.Thom & Jennings, 1996 By 1907, the first sterilization law was enacted in the United StatesDNA Learning Center, 2011a and, in 1910, a eugenics section of the American Breeders Association and the Eugenics Records Office were established.DNA Learning Center, 2011b Both affiliations were largely influenced by Charles Davenport and Harry Laughlin,DNA Learning Center, 2011b but both were headed by Davenport himself. By the 1920s and 1930s, forced sterilizations were performed in nearly thirty US states.Buchanan, 1997; Reilly, 1991 Hitler much admired the eugenics practices in the United States and, after becoming the German chancellor in 1933, the Nazis emulated and applied these practices on anyone whom they deemed to be a degenerate, especially Jews.Allen, 1995; Chase, 1977; Devlin, Fienberg, Resnick, & Roeder, 1995 Scientists discredited the eugenics movement after witnessing the events of World War II and the acts committed by the Nazis in the name of genetic cleansing.Wahlsten, p. 186 Forced sterilization was declared a crime against humanity in the Nuremberg Trials.Wahlsten, p. 196 While sterilization programs began to die down in the United StatesBuchanan, 1997; Grekul, Krahn, & Odynak, 2004 and Great Britain, they continued in Canada's western provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Notably, it was only in Alberta that a sterilization law had been vigorously implemented.Wahlsten, 1997; McLaren, 1990 By order of the Alberta Eugenics Board, Muir and 2,831 children and adults were sterilized between the passing of the Sexual Sterilization Act in 1928 and its repeal in 1972.Wahlsten, p. 185 One of the main advocates of eugenics who helped pass Alberta's sterilization law was the first female magistrate of the British Empire, Emily Murphy,Wahlsten, p. 187 who was also one of the Famous five (canada) who campaigned for women's rights in the 1920s. Under her influence, many Albertans, especially farmers who saw first-hand what selective breeding can do to enhance livestock quality, agreed that eugenics could be used to improve human stock as well.Buchanan, 1997 One of the people influenced by Murphy’s opinions was the Minister of Agriculture and Health, George Hoadley. Hoadley convened the first meeting of the Alberta Eugenics Board a year after the Sexual Sterilization Act was passed.Wahlsten, p. 188 This Board interviewed all people considered to have inferior genetic stock and approved the sterilization of 4,725 of 4,800 cases.Thomas, 1995 The three-member Board elected a fourth member John M. MacEachran to act as chairman, a position he held until his death in 1965. MacEachran was a key figure in promoting the continued sterilization of people who were seen as degenerates and \\"incapable of intelligent parenting.\\"Buchanan, 1997 Inmates of Alberta mental institutions were particularly vulnerable to sterilization under this Act and the Board's practices.Wahlsten, p. 188  The sterilization of Leilani Muir  Muir had lived at the Provincial Training School for two years and four months before she underwent an intelligence quotient (IQ) test. Low IQ was a major criterion for sterilization. She was brought to the Calgary Guidance Clinic to take an IQ test a week before meeting with the Eugenics Board and scored an overall mark of 64.Wahlsten, p. 194 Muir was formally diagnosed as a \\"Mental defective Moron\\". The Board used Muir's IQ score as sufficient grounds for her sterilization, as a score lower than 70 was considered degraded intelligence. Although she was not told at the time, the Board ordered that she be sterilized. Other factors that increased the likelihood of sterilization were Muir's Irish-Polish background and Catholic religion,Christian, 1973 her presumed incapability of intelligent parenting, and that she had \\"shown definite interest in the opposite sex\\" while living in a public institution.Wahlsten, p. 194 On January 19, 1959, doctors performed a bilateral salpingectomy (destruction of the fallopian tubes) on Muir.Wahlsten, p. 194 She had been told that the surgery was to remove her appendix. She would not find out until nearly a decade later why she could not bear children.  The case  In 1965, Muir left the Provincial Training School for a life of independence. Over the next 15 years, she worked as a waitress and had two failed marriages.Wahlsten, p. 195 During her first marriage, she was unable to conceive a child. After fertility tests, a doctor informed Muir that she had been intentionally sterilizedWahlsten, 1997 and the procedure was irreversible. Her attempts to adopt a child were denied because of the stigma of her history as a former inmate of an institution.Buchanan, 1997 Muir became depressed and sought professional help in 1989 while living in British Columbia. To determine if she would be a good candidate for group therapy, she took another IQ test and scored 89. Considering her past institutionalization, this score surprised Dr. George Kurbatoff who administered the test, and suggested that she did not have a mental defect now that she lived in a better environment.Wahlsten, 1997 Not long after this IQ test had proved that Muir was of normal intelligence and should never have been sterilized or placed in the Provincial Training School for Mental Defectives, she sought legal counsel to sue the Alberta government on her behalf for wrongful sterilization.Pringle, 1997 The four-week trial began on June 22, 1995, with the Honorable Madame Joanne B. Veit presiding. On January 25, 1996, Veit ruled in favor of Muir awarding C$740,780 in damages with an additional C$230,000 for legal costs.Muir v. The Queen in right of Alberta, 1996; Wahlsten, 1997; Pringle, 1997 Veit proclaimed: > In 1959, the province wrongfully surgically sterilized Ms. Muir ... the > particular type of confinement of which Ms. Muir was a victim resulted in > many travesties to her young person: loss of liberty, loss of reputation, > humiliation and disgrace, pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life, > loss of normal developmental experiences, loss of civil rights, loss of > contact with family and friends, [and] subjection to institutional > discipline.Muir v. The Queen in right of Alberta, 1996 Since Muir’s case, the Alberta government has apologized for the forced sterilization of over 2,800 people. Nearly 850 Albertans who were sterilized under the Sexual Sterilization Act were awarded C$142 million in damages.Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1999 In 1996, a documentary was released about Muir's life called The Sterilization of Leilani Muir. Produced by the National Film Board of Canada, the film won awards at the 1997 HESCA Film Festival in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and the Western Psychological Association Film Festival in Seattle, Washington.NFB, 2012  Private life  After the trial, Muir lived in Devon, Alberta with her pets. She was an active board member of the Living Archives on Eugenics in Western Canada Community University Research Alliance, and enjoyed spending her free time with family, friends, pets, and other animals. She continued to speak about her life story at international conferences and wrote an autobiography called A Whisper Past: Childless after Eugenic Sterilization in Alberta.Crusio, 2015 The play Invisible Child: Leilani Muir and the Alberta Eugenics Board was performed by MAA & PAA Theatre at the 2012 Edmonton International Fringe Festival.Theatre Alberta, 2012 Muir died at home in Devon, Alberta on March 14, 2016.Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 2016ICI Radio-Canada, 2016  Notes   References  *Allen, G.E.

It opened in 1898 and closed since 1992 because of overcrowding concerns. The mothballed facility was severely damaged by an EF3 tornado in the tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2020.  History  Tennessee State Prison, formerly the Tennessee State Penitentiary, is a former correctional facility located near downtown Nashville, Tennessee. Opened in 1898, the prison has been closed since 1992. The original Tennessee State Penitentiary became operational on January 1st, 1831 with 200 cells, a warden’s residence, and a hospital. Modeled after the Auburn Penitentiary in both discipline and design, the prison was the first of its kind in Tennessee and the South. Inmates were subject to practices championed by the Auburn model such as \\"during the day the prisoners, with downcast eyes, labored silently together in workshops, while at night they slept alone in separate cells. Under no circumstances could they communicate with one another, and only when necessity demanded could they receive letters or calls from relatives and friends.\\" The prison housed both men and women, with the first male inmate registered in 1831 and the first female inmate registered in 1840. A separate women’s wing was opened in 1892 but overcrowding soon forced the men and women to be housed together. The original Tennessee State Penitentiary on Church Street was demolished later in 1898, and salvageable materials were used in the construction of outbuildings at the new facility, creating a physical link from 1831 to the present. The proposed prison design called for the construction of a fortress-like structure patterned after the penitentiary at Auburn, New York, made famous for the lockstep marching, striped prisoner uniforms, nighttime solitary confinement, and daytime congregate work under strictly enforced silence. The new Tennessee prison contained 800 small cells, each designed to house a single inmate. In addition, an administration building and other smaller buildings for offices, warehouses, and factories were built within the twenty-foot (6.15m) high, three-foot (1 m) thick rock walls. The plan also provided for a working farm outside the walls and mandated a separate system for younger offenders to isolate them from older, hardened criminals. A separate women's wing was built on the northwest corner of the grounds that housed the female inmates who worked on the farm as well. The prison was built by Enoch Guy Elliott who was married to Lady Ida Beasley Elliott (Missionary to Burma). Gov. Turney made Enoch Guy Elliott the Chief Warden of the old prison and then during the building of the second prison, Enoch used primarily prison labor to build the new prison. Construction costs for this second Tennessee State Penitentiary exceeded US$500,000 (US$12.3 million in 2007 dollars), not including the price of the land. The prison's 800 cells opened to receive prisoners on February 12, 1898, and that day admitted 1,403 prisoners, creating immediate overcrowding. To a greater or lesser extent, overcrowding persisted throughout the next century. In 1863, the Union Army took hold of the State Penitentiary and used it as a military prison. Under Union occupation, the prison population tripled and conditions worsened. Convicts were leased to the federal government by the Occupation Government of Tennessee to help repay their mounting debts. Among the prisoners held during this time was Mark Cockrill, a Confederate sympathizer whose West Nashville property would later be purchased for the construction of the new prison. Following the Civil war, the percentage of black inmates in the state of Tennessee increased dramatically, from roughly 5% of the prison’s population prior to the civil war, to about 62% in 1869. The proportion of black women in prison was significantly higher to black men in relation to whites, with all female prisoners in Tennessee in 1868 being African American women. Every convict was expected to defray a portion of the cost of incarceration by performing physical labor. Inmates worked up to sixteen hours per day for meager rations and unheated, unventilated sleeping quarters. The 1840s saw a rise in the use of prison labor, with inmates being employed in the construction of the state capitol building in Nashville. Prison labor was so lucrative that the state prison became a revenue-generating system that came in direct competition with free laborers. The State also contracted with private companies to operate factories inside the prison walls using convict labor. In 1870 the state penitentiary reached a deal with the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company, establishing the first convict leasing program in the country. This only added to growing frustrations among free laborers who staged a strike against the Tennessee Coal, Iron, and Railroad Company in 1871. Though the effort was ultimately defeated, it was the first of many revolts against the convict leasing system.The State also contracted with private companies to operate factories inside the prison walls using convict labor. The Tennessee State Penitentiary had its share of problems. In 1902, seventeen prisoners blew out the end of one wing of the prison, killing one inmate and allowing the escape of two others who were never recaptured. Later, a group of inmates seized control of the segregated white wing and held it for eighteen hours before surrendering. In 1907 several convicts commandeered a switch engine and drove it through a prison gate. In 1938 inmates staged a mass escape. Several serious fires ignited at the penitentiary, including one that destroyed the main dining room. Riots occurred in 1975 and 1985. In 1989 the Tennessee Department of Correction opened a new penitentiary, the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution at Nashville. The old Tennessee State Penitentiary closed in June 1992. As part of the settlement in a class action suit, Grubbs v. Bradley (1983), the Federal Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Tennessee Department of Correction from ever again housing inmates at the Tennessee State Prison. The former prison was severely damaged by an EF3 tornado in the tornado outbreak of March 2–3, 2020.  In films and television  It has been the location for the films Framed, Nashville, Marie, Ernest Goes to Jail, Against the Wall, Last Dance, The Green Mile, The Last Castle, and Walk the Line, as well as, two of Eric Church's music videos \\"Lightning\\" and \\"Homeboy,\\" Cage The Elephant's music video for \\"Cold Cold Cold,\\" and Pillar's \\"Bring Me Down.\\" VH1's Celebrity Paranormal Project filmed there for the third episode of the series (titled \\"The Warden\\") as well as the last episode of the first season (titled \\"Dead Man Walking\\"). The prison was referred to as \\"The Walls Maximum Security Prison\\" in both episodes to protect the location's privacy.

The title of her defense, Jane Anger Her Protection For Women was published in 1589. In the late sixteenth century, it was rare for women to write and publish on secular, or non-religious themes. It was also rare for women to argue against male supremacy.  Life and career  Scholars know virtually nothing about Jane Anger's life. Jane Anger is known only as the writer of the pamphlet, Jane Anger Protection for Women (1589),. There was more than one Jane Anger living in England at the time, however, none of them have been identified as the writer of the pamphlet.\\"Randall Martin, Women Writers in Renaissance England: An Annotated Anthology (Great Britain: Pearson Education Ltd, 1997), 81. According to Moira Ferguson, the history of surnames for this period suggest that her surname was probably derived from the Anglicized French \\"Anjou\\",.Martin, Women Writers in Renaissance England: An Annotated Anthology, 80. Anne Prescott argues that,\\" presumably, the Jo. Anger, whose poem on the author appears at the end of the volume, was a relative or spouse.Moira Furguson, \\"Jane Anger,\\" in First Feminists: British Women Writers 1578-1799 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1985, 58. Others have suggested that \\"Jane Anger\\" was the pseudonym of a male writer. Other evidence suggests that Jane Anger may be a real woman, not a \\"ventriloquizing man,\\" and her work breaks free from gender limitations.Lynne A. Magnusson, \\"Dictionary of Literary Biography: Jane Anger (flourished 1589),\\" Sixteenth-Century British Nondramatic Writers (1994):3, accessed on 3 December 2014. In The Crooked Rib, Francis Lee Utley argues that the anonymous poem, \\"ye are to yong to bring me in: An old lover to a young gentlewoman\\" might have provoked Anger's sharp defense.\\"Magnusson, \\"Dictionary of Literary Biography: Jane Anger (flourished 1589),\\"4.  Work  The pamphlet defends women and makes serious claims regarding female’s authorship. For the first time, her text brought a distinctive new voice to English writing, which emphasized the voice of female anger. By developing this innovation, she \\"transformed the idea of masculine models of composition to invent a female writing style to suite to her enterprise.\\"Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald, \\"Jane Anger: From Jane Anger Her Protection for Women…(1589),\\" in Available Means: An Anthology of Women’s Rhetoric(s) (Pennsylvania: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2001), 50-60 Some modern commentators argue that, \\"Anger deliberately reworks her opponent’s misogynist ideas to establish a direct feminine perspective that goes beyond the querelle frameworks.\\"Martin, Women Writers in Renaissance England, 80. Since Jane Anger was the first major female polemicist in English, there is no doubt that Anger shows the interest and value in the creation of feminist consciousness, because in the Middle Ages, the feminist polemic was a favorite topic for academic disputation. Jane Anger's pamphlet, Her Protection of Women, (1589) was a response to the male-authored text of Thomas Orwin, Book His Surfeit in Love. Pamela Joseph Benson argues that, \\"the Protection remains undifferentiated from other interventions in the querelle because it relies largely on the traditional issue of sexual behavior to evaluate woman’s moral nature.\\"Joy Ritchie and Kate Ronald, \\"Jane Anger: From Jane Anger Her Protection for Women…(1589),\\" 50. Anger's arguments are a compilation of allusions, sayings, and some examples that match to those in the Book his Surfeit. She exposes the mono-gendered basis of the Surfeiter's \\"objective\\" or \\"natural\\" assertions. Anger's text responds to the male-dominated rhetoric of the female gender, passionately defends and attacks the male writes' complaint stating that he is \\"surfeit\\", or \\"sick with sensual indulgence of women.\\"Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women To Defend Them Against the Scandalous Reportes Of a Late Surfeiting Lover, and All Other Like Venerians that Complaine so To Bee Overcloyed with Women’s Kindness. London: Printed by Richard Jones and Thomas Orwin, 1589. Through defending her intervention in the debate, she constantly touches the reader's awareness that women were not confident enough to express their own opinions or \\"masculine\\" emotions. Her pamphlet opens with a critique of masculine rhetorical practices, especially paying an attention to their overemphasis on \\"manner\\" over \\"matter.\\" She immediately targets a contradiction between the high value male writers, who place women as a stimulus to their creativity and the decline of women. She touches the notion of the mythmaking that accompanies men's claims to inspiration: \\"If they may one encroach so far into our presence as they may but see the lining of our outermost garment, they straight think that Apollo honors them.\\"Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women To Defend Them Against the Scandalous Reportes Of a Late Surfeiting Lover, and All Other Like Venerians that Complaine so To Bee Overcloyed with Women’s Kindness. London: Printed by Richard Jones and Thomas Orwin, 1589. She describes the details of how men's ignorance of women allow them to misread women's behaviors, particularly, in regard to sex, she writes: \\"If we will not suffer them to smell on our smocks, they will snatch at our petticoats; but if our honest natures cannot away with that uncivil kind of jesting, then we are coy. Yet if w bear with their rudeness and be somewhat modestly familiar with them, they will straight make matter of nothing, blazing abroad that they have surfeited with love, and …telling the manner how.\\"Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women. Jane Anger describes her work as \\"that which my chooloricke vaine hath rashly set downe…it was ANGER that did write it.\\"Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women. The first \\"epistle\\" is devoted to Gentlewomen making an apology for a female's choleric directness. In the second \\"epistle\\" she blames \\"railing\\" male speech: Fie on the falshoode of men, whose minds goe off a madding, & whose tongues can not so soone be wagging, but straight they fal a railing...shall not Anger stretch the vaines of her braines, the stringes of her fingers, and the listes of her modestie, to answere theire Surfeitings: Yes truly.Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women. Then, using the Surfeiter's own vein, she uses the comic potential in the discourse, which enables her readers to laught at her, as well as at the Surfeiter. Thus, \\"it confirms the misogynist reading of women who speak out as shrewish.\\"Anna Bayman, \\"Female Voices in Early Seventeenth Century Pamphlet Literature,\\" Women and Writing, c.1340-c.1650: The Domestication of Print Culture (2010) 196-210,accessed on 3 December 2014. She uses a female speech as comically baffling and witty in its echoes of logical and scholastic discourse: > Give me leave like a scoller to prove our wisdom more excellent then theirs, > hough I never knew what sophistry ment. There is no wisdom but it comes by > grace, this is a principles & Contra principium non est disputandum: but > grace was first given to a woman, because to our lady: which premises > conclude that women are wise. Now Primus est optimum, & therefore, women are > wiser then men. That we are more witty which comes by nature, it connot > better be proved, then that by our answers, men are often driven to Non > plus.Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women. Importantly, Anger repeatedly points out that men continue to misinterpret women because male writers \\"assume\\" that women are not capable of entering the male sphere of the printed word to challenge them: \\"their slanderous tongues are so short, that the time wherein they have lavished out their words freely hath been so long, and they know we cannot catch hold of them to pull them out, and they think we will not write to reprove their lying lips.\\"Magnusson, \\"Dictionary of Literary Biography: Jane Anger (flourished 1589),\\"5. Anger tries to answer some general male charges against the looseness of women's moral, arguing that men's own \\"filthy lust\\" causes them to \\"invent\\" an idea of women's lascivious nature. Above all, as the counter argument to the Surfeiter's account that women seduce men only to make the men's lives miserable, Anger proposes her own story. According to Anger's view of courtship: that men prey on women, \\"If we clothe ourselves in sackcloth, and truss up our hair in dishclouts, Venerians will nevertheless pursue their pastime. If we hide our breasts, it must be with leather, for no cloth can keep their long nails out off our bosoms.\\"Magnusson, \\"Dictionary of Literary Biography: Jane Anger (flourished 1589),\\"5-6. Anger's way of caricaturing the Surfeiter allowed her to produce an imaginative and unique piece of writing. At the end of her pamphlet, though Anger blames the Surfeiter for his views, she admits the fact that she had the pleasure using his style. Anger's work is full of misogynist materials, which were circulating in popular prose romances of her time, including some of Greene's and John Lyly's works. Scholars have their own interpretations whether she should be called \\"feminist,\\" \\"protofeminist,\\" or \\"prowoman,\\" but her work definitely opened up a new possibility for women writers of the sixteenth century.Magnusson, \\"Dictionary of Literary Biography: Jane Anger (flourished 1589),\\"5-6. A sample from Jane Anger's Her Protection for Women Fie on the falsehood of men, whose minds go oft a –madding and whose tongues cannot so soon be wagging but straight they fall a-railing. Was there ever any so abused, so slandered, so railed upon, or so wickedly handled undeservedly, as are we women? Will the gods permit it, the goddesses stay their punishing judgments, and we ourselves not pursue their undoings for such devilish practices? O Paul's steeple and Charing Cross!Jane Anger, Her Protection for Women.  Historical context  There was a lack of formal educational institutions for girls during the early modern times, but it did not prevent some early modern women from acquiring their reading and writing skills. Laura Knoppers suggests that informal education for girls took place in multiple spaces and ways. The early women writers used three handwriting styles: italic, secretary, and mixed. The writing process was linked with the reading of the books. Because many books were expensive, some women personally copied them and made their own writing in the margins of a book. Throughout the early modern period, many women tend to choose manuscript writings and circulation for their diaries, traveling journals, recipe books, religious and personal devotional writing, and miscellanies. Knoppers argues that miscellanies writings include women's authorship and response to texts.Laura Lunger Knoppers, \\"Introduction: Critical Framework and Issues,\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Early Modern Women’s Writing (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 11. Some early feminist studies suggest that women's writing process began in the home, because in the early modern period, their homes were considered to be a place of work and business. Importantly, Knoppers argues that, \\"architectural spaces within the household as well as such places as the royal courts, churches and law courts generated and shaped women’s writing.\\"Knoppers, \\"\\"Introduction: Critical Framework and Issues,\\" 12. In the early modern period, most of the educational spaces for girls were found within the household, which helped women to be engaged in writing about cookery, carving, and needlework. Many women writers' voice openly show their support for gender and class hierarchies. A gender issue was a primary motive for women's writing, which included politics, religion, class, ethnicity, and practical affairs. As Jane Anger, many women writers wrote to defend themselves and their reputations through legal contexts and various domestic forms of life-writing.Knoppers, \\"\\"Introduction: Critical Framework and Issues,\\" 14. The reasons for their writing were various, many women writers wrote for themselves, on behalf of and to their family members, or simply for devotional purposes. Despite the fact that education was not available for early modern women, they were able to find multiple ways of writing and of circulating their work.

He founded many important and prestigious educational institutions in Calcutta (now Kolkata), such as the Hindu School, and Hare School and helped in founding Presidency College. Early life David Hare was born in Scotland in 1775. He came to India in 1800 to make a fortune as a watch maker. However, while he prospered in his business his mind was distracted by the deplorable conditions of the native population and unlike most of the other people who returned to their native land after gathering a fortune to live a life in peace and prosperity, he decided to stay back in the country and devote himself entirely to the cause of its uplift. However, he was no missionary, seeking to convert others to his religion. He lived his own life and allowed others to live their own, only helping to improve their condition. He also founded the School Book Society. Contribution Hare felt that the need of the country was English education. He used to discuss the topic with many of his customers, who came to buy watches in his shop. Raja Rammohun Roy went to Kolkata in 1814 and within a short time, they became friends. In 1816, he went on his own and attended a session of the Raja’s Atmiya Sabha. Both of them discussed at length the proposal to establish an English school at Kolkata. Babu Buddi Nath Mukherjee - another member of Atmiya Sabha - later discussed the matter with Sir Hyde East, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. That led to the foundation of Hindu College, later renamed Presidency College, Kolkata, on 20 January 1817. Thereafter, David Hare was instrumental in establishing the School Book Society on 6 May 1817. It took the initiative to print and publish text books in both English and Bengali. This society contributed substantially to the flowering of the Bengal Renaissance. On 1 September 1818, he established the Calcutta School Society'. He and Radhakanta Deb were secretaries of the society. He worked tirelessly to establish some schools to teach in English and Bengali, according to new methods of teaching, at such places as Thanthania, Kalitala and Arpuly. Every day, he visited the schools and Hindu College and met almost every student. So great was his attachment and commitment to these students that it acted as a great inspiration of many of them. Some of the greatest names in subsequent years were all his students. It was much later that Alexander Duff or Henry Louis Vivian Derozio came on the scene and influenced the course of events. Additionally, David Hare was a subscriber to the Ladies' Society for Native Female Education (formed in 1824), and would be present in the periodical examinations held by the society. Later life In later life, he did not find time to devote to his watch business and so he sold it to a friend named Grey and spent some of the money to buy a small house for himself and the rest for the development of the schools. After a long life of activity he fell ill. He was attacked by cholera. One of his students, Dr. Prasanna Kumar Mitra, tried his best but all efforts failed and David Hare died on 1 June 1842. As news spread around the city, a pall of gloom spread over the city. The Christian missionaries refused to allot him land in their cemeteries, as they thought that he was a non- believer. He was buried in what was then the compound of Hare School- Presidency College that he had donated. The tomb, marked with a bust statue, currently falls within the College Square (renamed Vidyasagar Udyan) swimming pool, opposite to Hare School. The grave of David Hare, college square, Kolkata According to Sivanath Sastri, “As his body was brought out of Mr. Gray’s house, thousands of people, some in vehicles, others on foot, followed it. The scene that was witnessed by Kolkata on that day will not be witnessed again. Right from Bowbazar crossing to Madhab Dutta’s bazaar, the entire road was flooded with people.” The road where he lived, is called Hare Street, just off Binoy-Badal-Dinesh Bagh (earlier Dalhousie Square). A life-size statue (pictured) was built with public donations and placed in the compound of Hare School.

It is closely related to the Taveuni beetle, which is only marginally smaller. These beetles have powerful jaws, and should be handled with care when alive—when threatened, they produce a loud and fearsome hissing noise by squeezing air out from under their elytra. Various websites and other resources incorrectly indicate that this species is extinct; it is not, though the forest habitat on its home island is somewhat limited, so the beetle is potentially quite vulnerable.

Biography Hart was born in New York City in 1931 and soon moved to Southern New Jersey, where he graduated from Pleasantville High School in Pleasantville, New Jersey. He graduated from Trenton State College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Education. After serving time in the military, Hart began officiating high school football, baseball, and basketball in South Jersey. After one game at Atlantic City High School, the school's athletic broadcaster Ralph Glenn was walking around frantically to find a person to go with him to Trenton to announce a game. He explained his situation to Hart and Hart agreed to go with him, which began his announcing career in hockey. =Professional career= Hart continued to announce with Glenn on a regular basis in Southern New Jersey, and kept several side jobs as well. One of which was teaching high school history classes at Lenape High School in Medford as well as in Audubon High School New Jersey. When Philadelphia was granted an NHL expansion team in 1966, Hart submitted his tapes to the team, which would be called the Flyers. Since the Flyers could not afford one of the more experienced Canadian announcers, Hart got the job. Although he only expected to be on the staff for a few years until the Flyers could afford a better broadcaster Hart stayed on as the voice of the Philadelphia Flyers for 29 years, from the team's inception until the end of the 1994–1995 season. Hart's colleagues as a Flyers announcer included Stu Nahan and Don Earle. Known for his rapid fire delivery, Hart's style was heavily influenced by famous hockey broadcaster Foster Hewitt. Like Hewitt, Hart's slightly high pitched, action describing delivery was perfect for both radio and early generation sports television. Hart announced more than 2,000 NHL games, 6 separate Stanley Cups, 5 NHL all-star games, and the NHL Soviet Union all-star series. His most famous call came when he announced the end of Game 6 of the 1974 Stanley Cup Finals: Gene Hart's call triggered the biggest celebration in Philadelphia sports history. More than 2 million attended the parade celebrating the Flyers' win. His signature goal call was: Tasty Baking Company was (and still is as of 2020) a Flyers sponsor and awarded a case of their desserts whenever a Flyer scored. The cases are usually given to charity in the player's name. In the early 1980s, he was also one of the voices of the NHL on USA Network. His signature phrase, which he used at the end of games, was \\"Good night and good hockey!\\" Hart succeeded Hall of Famer Roy Shudt as the announcer at Brandywine Raceway in Wilmington, DE in 1984. He called the horse races there until the track closed in 1989. Hart and hockey historian Bruce C. Cooper co-authored \\"The Hockey Trivia Book\\" published by Leisure Press in 1984, and his autobiography entitled \\"SCORE!\\" (co-authored with Buzz Ringe) was published by Bonus Books in 1990. A feature-length documentary film about Hart's life entitled \\"All Hart\\" is currently in production by Green Creek Films. Hart did the play-by- play for the 1973 Finals of the North American Soccer League between the Philadelphia Atoms and the Dallas Tornado. Future USMNT coach Walter Chyzowych provided color commentary. =Post broadcasting career= Hart was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in November 1997, receiving the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award. He came out of retirement in 1997 to announce for the Philadelphia Phantoms, the Flyers’ minor league affiliate. He announced the team's Calder Cup championship series before retiring at the end of the 1999 season. Hart also was the host of a little-known local radio talk show on WBCB 1490 AM in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. It featured former and current Flyers players and coaches as well as players from the minor league Philadelphia Phantoms. =Death and family= Gene Hart died from a variety of illnesses on July 14, 1999. He had been a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Hart's daughter, Lauren Hart, is a professional recording artist, and regular performer of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" and \\"O Canada\\" before many Flyers home games. She also performs a duet of \\"God Bless America\\" with a taped version of Kate Smith on several occasions, especially big games, among them games in the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals. She wears number 68 on her Flyers jersey to honor the age of her father when he died. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Gene Hart into their Hall of Fame in 2001.

History For many years, the residents of Bailey Island, Maine, advocated that a bridge be built to connect their island with Orr's Island. The town of Harpswell, Maine, which encompasses both islands, turned down the request. However, when the Maine Legislature drafted a law allowing the state and counties to fund bridge construction, a plan emerged to build such a bridge. A contract was signed in 1926, with construction beginning on the Bailey Island Bridge in 1927 and finishing in 1928. The engineer for the project was Llewelyn N. Edwards, bridge engineer for the Maine State Highway Commission. Design Cribstones used in the cobwork construction of the bridge Design of the 1,150-foot bridge was complicated by the tides in the area known as Will's Gut. It was decided to build a cobwork bridge, using granite slabs as cribstones, acquired from local quarries in nearby Yarmouth, Maine. The slabs, longer than they are wide, are laid horizontally, first lengthwise, and then crosswise, in several layers. No mortar or cement is used. Granite slabs were considered sufficiently heavy to withstand wind and wave, while the open cribbing allowed the tide to ebb and flow freely without increasing tidal current to any great degree. . Some 10,000 tons of granite were used in the project. A concrete road (now part of Route 24) was built on top of the cribstones. Additions and recognition A sidewalk was added in 1951 and guard rails in 1961. The Bailey Island Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975; on July 19, 1984, it was recognized as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. The Bailey Island Bridge is reported to be the only granite cribstone bridge in the world. In 2009 and 2010, the bridge underwent reconstruction to repair cracked or sheared stones. During the repairs, a 1,000-foot temporary bridge was placed alongside the cribstone bridge so that traffic could continue without disruption. On November 20, 2010, a ribbon-cutting ceremony and parade took place to celebrate the reopening of the bridge. The restored bridge maintains the dimensions of the original, and the replacement stones were obtained from the same quarry in Yarmouth that supplied the original.

It would be their first of two fights.  Pre-fight  Alexis Argüello was born and raised in Managua. He had to fight on the streets as a child to earn money, and became the WBA world Featherweight champion by defeating Rubén Olivares by a thirteenth round knockout in Los Angeles. Because he defended his Featherweight crown successfully each time he was challenged for the title, Arguello became a mainstream star both in Latin America and the United States. Escalera is a native of Carolina. Much like Arguello, he learned since he was a child to box and he was a member of a group of boxers from the area, like Wilfred Benítez, Wilfredo Gómez and Esteban De Jesús, to reach international fame status. He was crowned WBC world Jr. Lightweight champion on July 5, 1975 when he knocked Kuniaki Shibata out in the second round in Japan. Escalera proceeded to make ten title defenses before facing Arguello. When the fight was announced, boxing magazines in the United States, Europe and Latin America began speculating on the fight's outcome. As a consequence, boxing fans beyond Nicaragua and Puerto Rico became interested as well, and television networks from several countries bought the rights to broadcast the bout. During a press conference before the fight, Bayamón mayor Ramon Luis Rivera presented both fighters with the symbolic key to the city of Bayamón.  The Fight  As the challenger, Arguello entered the ring first. Escalera, as was typical of him, made his entrance to the sounds of salsa music and took a snake wrapped around his neck to the ring. Arguello started off quickly, dropping Escalera in round two. The champion got up and started answering Arguello's onslaughts with combinations of his own. Arguello felt that he needed to be extra aggressive, fearing that if the fight was a close one, Escalera would be given a points verdict should it go the fifteen round distance because Escalera was fighting in his home country. Unknown to him, he was actually building a points lead on the three judges' scorecards. Escalera, meanwhile, felt that this was a fight he could win. He had been in difficult fights before, and he had prevailed on those. While Arguello's punches were taking a toll on Escalera's skin, he kept pressing and connecting strong punches on Arguello's body. By the eighth round, however, Escalera had suffered various injuries, such as a broken nose, ear, and teeth, a closed eye and a cut on his tongue. By round ten, the crowd seemed to feel that Escalera's chances of winning the bout were slipping away. Escalera rebounded, however, and rocked Arguello during the following three rounds, being on the verge of knocking the Nicaraguan out in the twelfth round. Escalera was apparently reinvigorated with the crowd cheering him on again. In round thirteen, Arguello made one final effort, pounding Escalera with a variety of punches. Escalera began to bleed profusely again from his injuries, and referee Arthur Mercante stopped the fight, with Arguello winning the WBC world Jr. Lightweight title by a thirteenth round knockout. The fight was described as \\"brutal\\".  Aftermatch  Escalera was immediately hospitalized for his injuries after the bout. Escalera and Arguello had a rematch in Rimini, Italy on February 2, 1979. Arguello prevailed by a 13th round knockout, finishing Escalera with a left hook. Escalera became a wrestler before returning to boxing, and had a strong comeback as a Lightweight, beating men like Maurice Watkins and Gene Hatcher before suffering a detached retina and retiring from boxing for good in 1983. He currently lives comfortably in Puerto Rico off the money he made as a fighter, and, despite losing his sight for some time due to his retinal problems, he was able to recover it after a successful eye surgery. Alexis Argüello won the WBC Lightweight title in 1981 by defeating Jim Watt in London, England, becoming only the sixth boxer in history, and the second Hispanic one, to hold world titles in three different divisions. On November 12, 1982, he challenged Aaron Pryor for the WBA world Jr. Welterweight title. Trying to make boxing history by becoming boxing's first four division world champion, Arguello was stopped in round fourteen of that fight. A rematch was held, in September 1983, and Pryor again prevailed, by a tenth round knockout. Arguello then joined the Contra movement in Nicaragua and was involved in civil war for a few months. He attempted boxing comebacks twice, his last fight being held in 1995. He faced drug problems, which were widely publicized by the press. Arguello became vice-mayor of the city of Managua and expressed interest in running for President of Nicaragua. He was kidnapped at one point during his tenure as vice-mayor, but he was rescued alive. Arguello later became mayor of Managua. In 2009, Arguello was found dead, having apparently committed suicide.
