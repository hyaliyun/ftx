He was one of the few individuals to be nominated for the short-lived Academy Award for Best Assistant Director. During his 30-year career he worked on over 75 films and television shows. Life and career Killy was born on January 26, 1903 in Connecticut. He entered the film industry as an assistant director at RKO Pictures, his first film being the 1931 musical comedy, Caught Plastered, directed by William Seiter, and starring the comedy duo of Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey. Over the next five years he assisted on over a dozen films, many of them notable films. In 1932 he was one of two assistants to George Cukor on the drama What Price Hollywood?, starring Constance Bennett and Lowell Sherman. In 1933 he was one of several assistants to Dorothy Arzner on the melodrama Christopher Strong, which featured Katharine Hepburn in her first starring role. He'd work with Hepburn on two more films in 1933, Morning Glory (one of three assisting Lowell Sherman), and one of two assisting Cukor on the classic, Little Women. That year he also assisted Seiter again on another Wheeler & Woolsey comedy, Diplomaniacs, as well as being one of three assistants to Thornton Freeland on the RKO musical Flying Down to Rio, which featured the first on-screen pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The following year Killy assisted Philip Moeller on the classic drama The Age of Innocence, the first talking version of the novel, starring Irene Dunne and John Boles. He would also work with Hepburn again, being one of three assistants to Richard Wallace on The Little Minister. It was during the filming of this movie when Killy gained notoriety by telling off Hepburn. She was acting up on set one day and refusing to take her place on set, so he told her, \\"Get on the set before you're sent back to New York to do another 'Lake'.\\" However, he soon became one of her favorite assistant directors. In 1935 Killy became part of a concerted effort on RKO's part to build a cadre of young directors. His first assignment as the main man behind the camera was as co-director with William Hamilton, on the 1935 film Freckles, based on the 1904 novel of the same name. The two would again pair up to direct the 1935 version of Seven Keys to Baldpate, starring Gene Raymond and Margaret Callahan. The pair would co-direct two more films before Killy was given his first solo directing assignment, 1936's Second Wife, starring Gertrude Michael and Walter Abel. Over the next ten years, he'd direct another 20 films, mostly B movie Westerns, and being the chief director for Tim Holt's Westerns. Some of the oater collaborations between Killy and Holt include: The Fargo Kid (1940), Wagon Train (1940), Along the Rio Grande (1941), and Land of the Open Range (1942). In the mid-1940s, a young actor, Robert Mitchum, was signed to a seven-year contract with RKO, with the intent of making B-Westerns based on Zane Grey novels. Killy was assigned the first of these films, 1944's Nevada. He would also direct Mitchum in another film adaptation of a Grey novel, 1945's West of the Pecos, which was also Killy's last credit as the director of a film. Even after getting the opportunity to take the helm of films, Killy was one of the rare people to continue to work at the assistant director level. As an assistant he worked on several notable features including: Roberta, directed by Seiter, and starring Irene Dunne, Fred Astaire, Ginger Rogers, and Randolph Scott; again with Hepburn on Alice Adams (1935), with George Stevens directing; the classic war film Gunga Din, again directed by Stevens, and starring Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr.; The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939), assisting William Dieterle, and starring Charles Laughton as Quasimodo and Maureen O'Hara as Esmeralda; Gregory La Cava's Primrose Path, starring Ginger Rogers and Joel McCrea; Bombardier (1943), directed by Richard Wallace, and starring Pat O'Brien and Randolph Scott; 1944's romantic comedy, also directed by Wallace, Bride by Mistake, starring Alan Marshal and Laraine Day; Susan Slept Here (1954), a romantic comedy directed by Frank Tashlin and starring Debbie Reynolds and Dick Powell in his final film performance; and the Howard Hughes' production of The Conqueror, directed by Dick Powell, and starring John Wayne. In the late 1940s through the 1950s, Killy would also occasionally work as a production manager on such films as: Blood on the Moon (1948), The Big Steal (1949), Angel Face, Jet Pilot, and All Mine to Give (1958). Killy married Pauline Watkins, and would remain married to her until his death in 1981. The two adopted a daughter in the 1930s, Audrey K. Killy. Killy died July 2, 1981 in Orange County, California.

Unlike the other three categories of occupational hazard (chemical, biological, and physical), they do not arise from a physical substance or object. Psychosocial hazards affect the psychological and physical well-being of workers, including their ability to participate in a work environment among other people. They cause not only psychiatric and psychological outcomes such as occupational burnout, anxiety disorders, and depression, but they can also cause physical injury or illness such as cardiovascular disease or musculoskeletal injury. Psychosocial risks are linked to the organization of work as well as workplace violence and are recognized internationally as major challenges to occupational safety and health as well as productivity.  Causes  According to a survey by the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, the most important psychosocial hazards ‚Äî work stressors ‚Äî are: * Job strain * Effort-reward imbalance * Lack of supervisor and co-worker support * Long working hours * Work intensification * Lean production and outsourcing * Emotional labor * work‚Äìlife balance * Job insecurity * Precarious work  Impact  Exposure to psychosocial hazards in the workplace not only has the potential to produce psychological and physiological harm to individual employees, but can also produce further repercussions within society - reducing productivity in local/state economies, corroding familial/interpersonal relationships, and producing negative behavioral outcomes.Schaufeli, W.B., & Greenglass, E.R.

(2006). A twin-family study of the association between employment, burnout and anxious depression. Journal of Affective Disorders, 90, 163- 169. = Physiological = Supported by strong evidence from a plethora of meticulous cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, a link has been indicated between the psychosocial work environment and consequences on employees‚Äô physical health. Increasing evidence indicates that four main physiological systems are effected: hypertension and heart disease, wound-healing, musculoskeletal disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, and impaired immuno- competence. Additional disorders generally recognized as stress-induced include: bronchitis, coronary heart disease, mental illness, thyroid disorders, skin diseases, certain types of rheumatoid arthritis, obesity, tuberculosis, headaches and migraine, peptic ulcers and ulcerative colitis, and diabetes.Marmot, M., Bosma, H., Hemingway, H., Brunner, E., & Stansfeld, S.

(2000). Research on work related stress. Luxembourg: Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. In 2003, a cross-sectional survey of 12,110 employees from 26 different workplace environments was established to examine the relationship between subjective workplace stress and healthy activity. The survey quantified the measurement of stress mainly through evaluation of an individual's perceived locus of control in the workplace (although other variables were also examined). The results concluded that self-reported high levels of stress were associated with, across both sexes: diets with a higher concentration of fat, less exercise, cigarette smoking (and increasing use), and less self-efficacy to control smoking habits.Ng, D.M., & Jeffery, R.W.

He currently trains under the tutelage of his coaches Fabio Pivari and Wietse van Alten, a Sydney 2000 Olympian from the Netherlands, for the Italian team, while shooting at the Tempio di Diana Archery Range () in Rome. Pasqualucci rose to prominence in the international archery scene at the 2015 World Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. There, he and his compatriots Michele Frangilli and Mauro Nespoli, both of whom came as reigning Olympic champions from London 2012, capture a silver medal in the men's team recurve to secure a full quota spot for Rio 2016, despite losing the title 0‚Äì6 to the South Koreans. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Pasqualucci was selected to compete for the Italian archery squad, shooting in both individual and team tournaments. First, Pasqualucci managed to score 685 points out of a maximum 720 to lead the Italian trio for the third seed heading to the knockout stage, along with his team's score of 2,007 collected from the classification round. Looking forward to defend the men's team recurve title for Italy, Pasqualacci and his compatriots Nespoli and Marco Galiazzo received a bye for the quarterfinals as a third-seeded team, but suffered an untimely defeat to China in a 0‚Äì6 upset. Rebounding from his Italian team's quarterfinal exit, Pasqualacci quickly dispatched Malawi's Areneo David in straight sets to book the round two spot in the men's individual recurve, before he bowed out to the Spaniard Antonio Fern√°ndez at 2‚Äì6.

He was the first official photographer for the royal court of Benin City, Nigeria, and a chief in the Iwebo palace society. Alonge's record of Nigerian royalty and social class is one of the most extensive and well-preserved collections from the period. Life Alonge was born in Benin City in 1911. He learned English at the Benin Baptist Elementary School and at the age of 14 moved to Lagos to live with uncle to learn a profession. There, he developed an interest in photography and took on an apprenticeship. In 1930, Alonge returned to Benin and began practicing photography from his home on Ugbague Street. He frequently traveled outside Benin City, taking school portraits and photographing gatherings at social clubs, sporting events, and government ceremonies. When the son of the current oba, the Edo word for \\"ruler\\", took over in 1933, Alonge became his court photographer, documenting the final and elaborate traditional burial ceremony for Oba Akenzua's mother in 1935. Alonge's talent was recognized early on by the British, and he was asked to take photographs for the colonial administrators in the 1930s and 1940s. In the late 1930s, he became a founding member of the Benin Social Circle, a group of businessmen, leaders, and the educated elite. He also served as treasurer of the Central Baptist Church for over 20 years. In 1942, he created the Ideal Photo Studio in Benin City, where he quickly developed a reputation as a young, hard-working professional and an honest businessman. The studio soon became a popular location to have portraits taken. He experimented with a variety of techniques, and he began creating product advertisements, documenting construction projects, photographing parties, and covering business conferences for local companies like Guinness Brewery. He also photographed official ceremonies and historical events for the Nigerian government. In 1956, Alonge photographed Queen Elizabeth's visit to meet Oba Akenzua II at the Benin airport. He also recorded the oba shaking hands with Princess Alexandra, who declared Nigeria independent in 1960, on a visit to Benin in 1963. Photography Alonge's work spans half a century and record the reigns of Oba Akenzua II (1933‚Äì1978) and Oba Erediauwa (1979‚Äìpresent). Alonge photographed the political and social events surrounding the royal palace, including the royal wives and children, visiting dignitaries and politicians, and annual festivals and court ceremonies. Over 3,000 of Alonge's photographs have been archived at the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art. His style combined traditional and modern motifs. Alonge took portraits outdoors with a large format, glass plate camera and a locally made studio backdrop. Using kerosene lanterns, he developed the glass plate negatives at night and contact printed the images on gaslight paper. Reading instruction booklets from Kodak and Ilford, he taught himself to mix his own chemicals and use sunlight to develop his prints. In 1940, Alonge began to retouch, sepia tone, and hand-color his photographs. When electricity came to Benin in 1945, he was able to take studio portraits and develop his photos indoors. Alonge's first camera was a Kodak Brownie; later, he used a Rolleiflex and other 35 mm cameras, and finally high-speed film. Alonge's photographs were intended for his subjects, for private home use, and for his personal interest in building a visual record. His subjects chose their own attire and presented themselves to the camera in preferred cultural attitudes.  Historical impact  In the late 1800s, the British seized control of Benin City, bringing with them their photographic traditions. British photographers depicted locals through the viewpoint of the colonist. The first photographs of Benin depicted defeated royal families in exile, burned palaces, and \\"punitive\\" expeditions. As the first indigenous royal court photographer, Alonge changed this narrative. His work helped to usher in an era of Nigerians representing themselves and acting as keepers of their own history. This shift allowed the subjects to present themselves in a way that they felt was dignified. One such photograph was that of a proud Oba Akenzua II displaying the royal regalia of his grandfather, Ovonramwen, that was returned by the British to Benin in 1938. Alonge's photography preserves an important historical record of Benin arts and culture during the periods of British colonial rule and the transition to Nigerian independence during the 1950s and 1960s. The National Museum of African Art exhibited Alonge's work beginning in September 2014, displaying some of his rarely seen photographs. The exhibition, which coincided with the Nigerian celebration of 100 years as a united country, was curated by professor and photographer Flora S. Kaplan, who corresponded with Alonge and visited Benin in 1982. Among the first visitors to the exhibit were members of Benin's royal court and Alonge's family. Attendees included his colleagues and friends, his children, and Prince Ademola Iyi-Eweka, grandson of the oba who served from 1914 to 1933. Also present were many subjects of Alonge's photographs, now in their late 70s and 80s. The exhibition is scheduled to continue until January 2016. Once finished, it is hoped that the exhibition will return to Benin, where it will continue to be displayed.

The neural activities are picked up by electrophysiological recordings from the brain (e.g. EEG, MEG, ECoG, etc.) and muscle (EMG). It is a method to study the neural control of movement.  Physiology  Corticomuscular Coherence was initially reported between MEG and EMG Conway, B. A., Halliday, D. M., Farmer, S. F., Shahani, U., Maas, P., Weir, A. I., & Rosenberg, J. R. (1995). Synchronization between motor cortex and spinal motoneuronal pool during the performance of a maintained motor task in man. J Physiol, 489 ( Pt 3), 917‚Äì924. http://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1995.sp021104 and is widely studied between EMG and EEG, MEG, etc. The origins of corticomuscular coherence seem to be communication in corticospinal pathways between primary motor cortex and muscles. While the role of descending corticomuscular pathways in generation of coherence are more clear, the role of ascending sensory spinocortical pathways are less certain. Corticomuscular coherence has been of special interest in alpha band (about 10 Hz), in Beta band (15‚Äì30 Hz), and in Gamma band (35‚Äì60 Hz).  Mathematics and Statistics  A classic and commonly used approach to assess the synchrony between neural signals is to use Coherence. Statistical significance of coherence is found as function of number of data segments with assumption of the signals' normal distribution.Halliday, D. M., & Rosenberg, J. R. (1999).

(a) Power spectrum of simulated local field potential, (b) Power spectrum of simulated electromyogram. (c) Simulated corticomuscular coherence. (d) Human corticomuscular coherence data. Corticomuscular coherence has been simulated in models which posit that motor commands are encoded in the spatial pattern of beta band synchronization patterns in motor cortex. Specific cortical oscillation patterns can be spatially filtered by the dendritic arbors of the corticospinal fibers to selectively shape the descending drive to the motoneurons in the spinal cord. Cortical oscillations can thus be translated into steady muscle forces which are maintained for the duration of the oscillation pattern. Although the oscillations serve only as the carrier for the motor command, weak traces of the beta oscillation are still transmitted to the muscle. These traces appear as weak levels of beta band corticomuscluar coherence which are consistent with those observed in physiology.

The White Caps played in the Big State League (1954‚Äì1955) and Gulf Coast League (1950‚Äì1953) after earlier Galveston teams had played in the Texas League. Galveston played at Moody Stadium. History Early Galveston teams called the Galveston Sand Crabs evolved from the 1888 Galveston Giants of the Texas League. The Sand Crabs continued play in the Texas League from 1889‚Äì1890, 1892, 1897‚Äì1899 and 1907‚Äì1911. The Galveston Pirates (1912‚Äì1917, 1919‚Äì1921), Galveston Sand Crabs (1922‚Äì1924) and Galveston Buccaneers (1931‚Äì1937) played as members of the Texas League. The Galveston Buccaneers first began play in 1931, when the Waco Cubs relocated to Galveston. Galveston owner Shearn Moody had purchased the Waco franchise, moved the team to Galveston and constructed Moody Stadium. The Buccaneers won the Texas League championship in 1934. The franchise moved to become the Shreveport Sports after the 1937 season when Shearn Moody died and the franchise was sold. The Galveston White Caps were founding members of the Class B Gulf Coast League (1950‚Äì1953) before joining the Big State League (1954‚Äì1955). The Gulf Coast League folded after the season 1953 season, with members Galveston White Caps, Harlingen Capitals, Laredo Apaches, Brownsville Charros, Port Arthur Seahawks, Corpus Christi Aces, Lake Charles Lakers and Texas City Texans. Galveston won the league's final regular season title with a record of 94‚Äì48. In 1954, the White Caps joined the Big State League, alongside the Austin Pioneers, Corpus Christi Clippers, Del Rio Indians, Harlingen Capitals, Temple Eagles, Tyler Tigers, Port Arthur Sea Hawks and Waco Pirates. The White Caps folded on June 12, 1955 with a record of 28‚Äì30. In the Gulf Coast League, Galveston finished 80‚Äì68 .541 (1950), 71‚Äì83 .461 (1951), 80‚Äì74 .519 (1952) and 94‚Äì48 .662 (1953).

Those that were in the heads of root crops, which remain in the field, survive. The output of moths from pupae that have wintered, and at the same time pupation of caterpillars of V age, coincides with the appearance of sprouts of sugar beet. The moths do not need additional nutrition, however, during drier periods, dew drops are sucked out. They are active in the evening, night and morning hours. The life expectancy of moths is 12‚Äì18 days. Females lay two to three eggs on the underside of the leaves, the aerial part of the root crops, plant remains and lumps of soil. Fertility is 100-150 eggs. The caterpillars born after 5‚Äì8 days first scrape the parenchyma, then braid the central leaves with cobwebs and eat through holes along the middle vein of the leaf and groove on the petioles. On adult beet plants they are under the swirling edges of the leaves and inside the cuttings or in the passages inside the head of the root crop. Damage is noted throughout the season, beginning with the appearance of two to three pairs of real leaves before harvesting. Caterpillars pass through five ages during the 25‚Äì30 days of development. They are hygrophilic, therefore, in a dry and hot weather, their mass death is observed. After completing nutrition they pupate in oval spider cocoons in the soil at a depth of . In the case of significant damage to plants, the growth of new leaves stops. Instead of a central beam, a black, loose lump of spiderweaved leaves is formed. Damage to the beet roots is particularly dangerous, as they become unsuitable for winter storage. The caterpillars damage flower-bearing shoots, which leads to their curving and drying. As a result, additional sprouts appear that give small and inferior seeds. The danger increases in the second half of summer due to the increase in pest numbers in the second and subsequent generations. The number of beet miner moths reduces more than 50 species of predators and parasites. Caterpillars infect parasites from the family of Eulophidae. Due to the fact that the damaged root crops rot quickly, timely harvesting and processing is necessary in fields where the moth causes significant damage. Economic threshold of damage: in the phenophase six to eight leaves with one caterpillar per two plants; at the beginning of the formation of root crops, 0.8-1 caterpillar per plant; at the beginning of the withering away of leaves, two caterpillars per plant.

He created his own mission at Brown's Town in Jamaica. He took six Jamaicans to help him on his journey across central Africa from west to east to cross the continent and rediscover David Livingstone's mission. Johnston's book and photographs record the journey and his observations on many things but particularly overly ambitious missionaries. Johnston later created slideshows to market Jamaica to potential tourists. Life Johnston was born in Scotland in 1851. He had read of the exploits of David Livingstone and attended his funeral in 1873. Johnston arrived in Jamaica in December 1874 because he thought it would be good for his lungs and it was. He broke away from the Baptist church and he started his Jamaican Evangelical mission in 1876. He created nine churches but the base of his medical mission and his religious assemblies was in Brown's Town. Johnston introduced new tunes and he would punctuate the service with unplanned singing. He would tour the area on Tuesdays and Fridays handing out prescriptions and his wife would follow turning the prescriptions into the required medicines. Johnston became the political representative for St Ann's Parish before he left to explore Africa. =Explorer= Livingstone's staff member Katanga and his wives In 1893 he wrote what he described as \\"an account of a journey across the continent of Africa from Benguella on the west through Bihe, Ganguella, Barotse, the Kalahari desert. Mashonaland, Manica, Gorongosa, Nyasa, the Shire Highlands to the mouth of the Zambezi to the East Coast.\\" This journey which was \\"mostly of foot\\" took him from May 1891 to October 1892. He had been inspired to visit what he called the \\"Dark Continent\\" by reading as a child of the exploits of Robert Moffat and David Livingstone. Johnston had hypothesised that people from Jamaica would be the best qualified people to explore central Africa. He decided to take six Afro-Caribbeans to Africa. Using his own funds he took the Jamaicans to England where he raised funds to cover the expense of his Jamaican colleagues. He bought all that he thought he would need to take for a journey to a \\"shopless country\\".\\"Reality versus romance in South Central Africa\\", Dr J Johnston, Archive.org. Retrieved 8 September 2015. He hoped to find part of the route the David Livingstone had taken (Livingstone had died in 1873). This was despite the expense and trouble of taking six people from Jamaica to Africa via England. Two Jamaicans who spent the majority of the journey with him were named Frater and Johnathon. Johnston hired dozens of Africans to carry all that he believed essential. In October 1891 he had 97 people in his party and about thirty were required to carry the carriers food. Johnston believed that the people with him would be able to carry 60- to 80-pound loads for eight hours each day.Book Review, African Affairs, p. 313. Retrieved 8 September 2015. Johnson's book which he titled, \\"Reality versus Romance in Central Africa\\" included dozens of Johnston's photographs. One of the photographs shows David Livingstone's servant Katanga who was pictured with his many wives.Katanga and his wives, Dr J. Johnston, Wellcome images. Retrieved 8 September 2015. He and another native, Ratau, told stories of working for Livingstone. Six to two On 3 August 1891 he gets to the mission station at Cisamba. Here he makes the decision to leave behind four of the Jamaicans and to continue with just Johnathon and Frater for company. He leaves the four in the care of the Reverend Saunders. Johnston is aware that he has no interpreter for the land ahead so he spends several weeks at Cisamba so that he can learn the basics of the Umbundu language. King Lewanika and the Coillard mission On 3 December 1891, Johnston's party were offered free shelter by King Lewanika. Johnston had respect for Lewanika as he offered help without pre-negotiating a price. Lewanika told Johnston how he had written to the British asking that his kingdom should be made a British Protectorate. He had waited years for a reply and then men had arrived with papers claiming that they had the power to make this happen. The King was reassured as the local missionary. Monsier Coillard, was his interpreter at the meeting and the King was reassured by Coillard's confidence in these men. Lewanika had been thankful that his wish had been granted and he had sent two enormous elephant ivory tusks as a present for Queen Victoria. Lewanika was incensed to find that the men were from a South African company and that the ivory tusks were not with Queen Victoria but as ornaments in the directors board room. Johnston assisted Lewanika in writing a letter of protest. Lewanika was to prove a great help to Johnston as he was able to command assistance for Johnston from nearby subordinate chiefs. Mr Wadell and M. Coillard and \\"boys\\" from Reality versus Romance On 10 December he met Coillard. Coillard ran a successful mission although his wife had recently died. Coillard was the missionary who had interpreted for Lewanika. Coillard was annoyed that Lewanika had been tricked by men who would consider themselves respectable. He was also annoyed that this affair had undermined the trust that he had built up with the King over many years. Johnston stayed for some time and witnessed a New Year's Eve firework display organised by the missionary. There was also a religious service that day but Johnston noted that few attended the service whilst many saw the fireworks. On New Year's Day 1891 the first Christian wedding of native Africans at the Coillard mission took place. The groom was Letia who was the son of King Lewanika and his bride was Katusi. Johnston witnessed the feast after the wedding which Coillard had funded. The guests were to sit at tables and chairs but the bride had never sat on a chair and Lewanika refused to sit at a table with women. The women included Lewanika's wives and Queen Macqui who was Lewanika's sister. Johnston noted that Letia took Christian marriage vows of fidelity, but he remained faithful for only a few months before taking another wife and renouncing Christianity. Johnston's route shown as a thin red line across Africa from left to right (zoom in to see) Johnston was very impressed by the Coillard's mission which included a practical man named Mr. Waddell and a Swiss missionary named Miss Keiner. Johnston did not approve of single ladies as missionaries but he was impressed with the high standard of progress and workmanship he saw around the mission and its buildings. He witnessed \\"a fine saw-mill with six span of oxen for the motor power, brick-making machines, smithy with patent forge, miner's workshop, fitted with every tool the mechanic requires, from a bradawl to a turning-lathe\\". Johnston had been to a number of missions and he singled out the Coillard mission for its high standards. This mission like all the African mission he observed that there was a large difference between the tales of mass conversions to the reality of staying alive in an unfamiliar environment. On 10 February 1892 the party arrived atJohnston, 1893, p. 204. Kazungula where there is a mission headed by Monsieur and Madame Jolla. Johnston finds another mission which is unusually well run. Monsieur Jolla is keen to extend his mission and he volunteers to travel with Johnston. Madame Jolla impresses Johnston by volunteering to stay behind. Johnston loses his staff around this point but M. Jolla acts as an excellent interpreter and with his help Johnston, Johnathon, Frater and Jolla travel to the Victoria Falls. Johnston notes that his photographs fail to capture the sight. The falls had been named by Livingstone and Johnston gets to meetJohnston, 1893, p. 217. Makumba and Ratau who served Livingstone and Chief Mosatane who knew him. By the end of February Johnston has returned to the Jolla mission and he sets out to cross the Kalahari desert. The journey ended in October 1892. After Johnston sets sail for home he finds out that all six of his Jamaican companions are safe. Johnston wrote his book \\"Romance versus Reality\\" which was published in 1893. Johnston describes the difficult life of the missionaries. Sometimes the missionaries' lives are made difficult just because of the difficulty of finding food. He argues that the missionaries should not be expected to feed themselves as this could occupy all their energy. He also argues that missionary societies should not expect to hear of thousands of Africans converting to Christianity as soon as they hear the message. Small numbers of converts are all that can be expected. Johnston told how he had met a missionary called Booth in August 1892 who told him how he was the first of hundreds who would convert the whole of Africa that century. Johnston was treating his ten-year-old daughter for fever and he saw that Booth was \\"prepared to sacrifice his only child to the hallucination that possesses him.\\"Johnston, 1893, p. 298. =Slideshows= \\"Jamaica The New Riviera\\" by Johnston He gave lectures for over a decade explaining the benefits of visiting and migrating to Jamaica using slideshows. These were paid for by the shipping company Elder, Dempster and Company. In 1903 he published one of the first books to market Jamaica as a tourist destination. He used his own interest in photography to put together a book of pictures titled Jamaica: The New Riviera. In 1915 the Universal Negro Improvement Association met at Johnston's Tabernacle Church in Brown's Town and Marcus Garvey was the main speaker. Garvey's speech was welcomed by Johnston who felt that Garvey's proposals were ambitious but they lacked detail of how his plans were to be achieved. When he died in November 1921, people accompanied his body as it was taken 14 miles to St Acre in his own Chalmers steam car.

It took place during the reign of Romulus, near the Lacus Curtius, future site of the Roman Forum. Background Rome was founded on the Palatine Hill. The settlement flourished and their strength and size came to rival those of their neighbors. The city needed more marriageable women and feared their growth couldn't be sustained if the female population did not increase. Romulus appealed to the other cities in the region:Livy Roman History: Book I, Chapter 9. With the Roman people outraged at the response, Romulus announced a festival to be held in the city and invited the citizens of Caenina, Antemnae, Crustumerium, and Sabinia. Once the festivities were underway, Romulus' men abducted the daughters of the Sabines and the other visitors. Afterwards, hostilities broke out between them.Plutarch, Life of Romulus, Chapter 14, paragraphs 2‚Äì6.Eutropius. Abridgment of Roman History: Book I, Chapter 2. Rome defeated three of their enemies, at which point the Sabines declared war.Livy. Roman History: Book I, Chapter 10.Plutarch, Life of Romulus, Chapter 14, paragraph 1. The two sides spent a year preparing. During this time Rome improved its defenses and were reinforced with Albans soldiers sent by King Numitor and mercenaries under the command of the Romulus' friend and renowned commander Lucumo. After a final effort to resolve the matter peacefully, the Sabine army marched forth. Battle The Vestal Virgin Tarpeia, the daughter of the commander of the citadel in Rome Spurius Tarpeius, betrayed Rome to the Sabines, offering them entry into the city.Livy. Roman History: Book I, Chapter 11.Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Book VII, Chapter 35.Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Book VIII, Chapter 78, paragraph 5. Quoting Fabius and Cincius, Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes that Tatius tricked the daughter of the commander of the city's walled citadel to open the gates to his men by offering her what she thinks will be the gold bracelets they wear on their left arms, instead they crushed her to death when they heaped their shields on top of her as her reward. Lucius Piso claimed that she was motivated not by greed, but a plan to trick the Sabines and that she was killed only after they came to suspect her of treachery. Livy writes that the girl was simply bribed, but also cites the trickery account related by Dionysius. The Sabine and Roman armies gathered at the Palatine and Capitoline Hills; the Sabines were commanded by Mettius Curtius and the Romans by Hostus Hostilius. The river had recently flooded and left a thick mud in the area,Plutarch, Life of Romulus, Chapter 18. After several skirmishes and minor engagements, the armies fought two pitched battles featuring valor and losses to both sides. The Intervention of the Sabine Women, by Jacques-Louis David, 1799. In the second and final battle between them, the armies met in between the two hills they occupied. Romulus and Lucumo were successfully attacking from both wings, but were forced to disengage when the center of the Roman line broke in order to stop the Sabines' advance under their general Mettius Curtius. After being turned back, the Sabines made an orderly retreat; Mettius and Romulus engaged one another directly until Mettius fell, wounded. A marshy lake prevented his escape but he plunged into it and stymied his enemy's pursuit. Once Romulus turned to face the remaining Sabines, the Sabine general pulled himself out of the mire and safely returned to his camp. When Romulus was struck in the head with a stone, the tide reversed again as the soldiers lost heart without their commander. The army was in full-flight after a javelin felled Lucumo. Romulus recovered, and with the support of fresh reserves from within the city, the Romans regained the upper hand and the lines moved back against the Sabines. With the sun setting, the Sabines made an arduous retreat to the citadel and the Romans broke off their pursuit. In Livy's account, the Romans assembled at the foot of the hill beneath the citadel, but the Sabines refused to emerge and engage them. Finally, in spite of their lack of the high ground, the frustrated Roman army attacked. Initially inspired by the heroics of their general Hostus Hostilius on the front line, the Roman line broke when he fell, Romulus makes a pledge to Jupiter that if he were to hold off the Sabine charge and restore the Roman's courage, he would build a new Temple to \\"Jupiter Stator\\" on the site. With a cry, Romulus led his army into the Sabines and routed them. The Sabine general Mettius was tossed in a swamp by his horse after it bolted. After the Sabines regrouped, the battle continued in the area between the two hills, but the Roman army had by then gained the upper hand. Suddenly, the abducted Sabine daughters rushed onto the battlefield and put themselves between the two armies. They implored both sides to stop the bloodshed and accept each other as family, as they then were. Ashamed, the leaders of the two peoples ended the fighting. In his account of the Battle of the Lacus Curtius, Plutarch provides additional details, but the basic account is the same as that of Livy and Dionysius. He notes that when the women intervened, they not only ended the battle, but brought food and water, as well as care for the injured. They also take the opportunity to introduce their husbands and their fathers. Henceforth, Sabine women have no duty but to spin wool for their husbands. Aftermath After the battle, both sides decided to sign a peace treaty uniting the two kingdoms transferring administrative power to Rome. Citizens of Rome became known as Quirites after the town Cures. The Lacus Curtius was named after Sabine leader Mettius Curtius.Livy. Roman History: Book I, Chapter 13.

The normal school admitted its first class, consisting of 160 students, on September 25, 1871. In 1913, West Chester became the first of the normal schools to be owned outright by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. West Chester became West Chester State Teachers College in 1927 when Pennsylvania initiated a four-year program of teacher education. In 1960, as the Commonwealth paved the way for liberal arts programs in its college system, West Chester was renamed West Chester State College, and two years later introduced the liberal arts program that turned the one-time academy into a comprehensive college. The campus quad located on North Campus appears on the National Register of Historic Places, and is called the West Chester State College Quadrangle Historic District, featuring WCU's historic buildings. The buildings, with the exception of Anderson Hall and Philips Memorial Building, were each built with local Chester County serpentine stone. They include Ruby Jones Hall, Recitation Hall and the Old Library. With passage of the State System of Higher Education bill, West Chester became one of the 14 universities in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education on July 1, 1983. Along with its new name‚Äî West Chester University of Pennsylvania‚Äîthe institution acquired a new system of governance and the opportunity to expand its degree programs. West Chester is recognized for its formal poetry program. Its annual conference on form and narrative in poetry began in 1995 and is devoted to New Formalism. It has established a poetry center that sponsors readings and an annual book competition oriented toward formal poetry. It has also established Iris Spencer awards recognizing undergraduate achievement in formal poetry. Nineteen days before his death, Frederick Douglass gave his very last public lecture at West Chester University. The lecture took place on February 1, 1895. Now, the university has the Frederick Douglass Institute on its campus as well as a statue of Douglass. It has been named a national historic landmark by the U.S. National Park Service. The Underground Railroad Network to Freedom recognized the Frederick Douglass Institute for its great work in understanding the history of the underground railroad. In April each year, students celebrate Banana Day, a unique annual event where the entire campus is full of a gorilla, Rammy, and others giving out bananas. Banana Day was conceptualized by WCU senior, Rodolfo P. Tellez, in 1996. Students take part in games similar to a field day to win Banana Day t-shirts, from push up competitions to banana eating contests. Academics At the undergraduate level, the university offers Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Fine Arts, and Bachelor of Music degrees. Paraprofessional studies are available in law, medicine, and theology. In cooperation with the Pennsylvania State University, Columbia University, and Philadelphia University, West Chester University offers a 3‚Äì2 dual-degree program combining liberal arts, physics, and engineering. Also available are early admission assurance programs with Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and Temple University School of Medicine. The university provides special admission opportunities and scholarships to the Widener School of Law‚ÄìHarrisburg Campus. Certification programs are available in health and physical education, teacher certification, driver education and safe living, and outdoor recreation. Interdisciplinary areas of study with transcript recognition include American studies, ethnic studies, Latin American studies, Russian studies, peace and conflict studies, women's studies, and linguistics. At the graduate level, West Chester University of Pennsylvania offers master's (M.A., M.B.A., M.Ed., M.M., M.P.A., M.P.H., M.S., M.S.W., M.S.N., M.U.R.P.) and doctoral (DPA, DNP, Ed.D., Psy.D.) degrees. Off-campus programs WCU opened an International Programs office to aide in sending students abroad. West Chester sponsors a number of annual courses, which include study abroad during spring, summer, and winter breaks. The university participates in the National Student Exchange Program, in which students spend up to a year at any one of more than 170 member schools across the United States. Transfer of credit is a part of this program.National Student Exchange ‚Äì Office of the Registrar ‚Äì West Chester University Relations Marching band 280px The West Chester University \\"Incomparable\\" Golden Rams Marching Band, which has over 300 members, performs pre-game, halftime, or post-game at all home and select away WCU football games in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and in Delaware.

In March 1997 the Youngs expanded into the basement below the restaurant, opening a jazz club called Beat Niq. During its time, the club featured many local musicians, bands touring across Canada, and guests from other cities. Frequent performers included the faculty of the jazz program at the Mount Royal College conservatory, and owner Robert Young, also a vocalist.

W. Choudhury, was a Bengali political scientist and diplomat from East Pakistan, which later became Bangladesh. He authored several books on Pakistan's international relations, and taught at the University of Dhaka, Royal Institute of International Affairs (England), Columbia University and other institutions.  Background and education Choudhury was born in 1926 at Madaripur District in then Bengal Presidency, British India (now Bangladesh) to Golam Mawla Choudhury and Faima Choudhury. Faima's father, Ibrahim Saber, was a brother of Begum Rokeya. Golam obtained his bachelor's in 1945 and master's in 1948 in political science from the University of Calcutta. He earned his PhD from Columbia University in 1956. Career In 1948, Choudhury joined the department of international relations faculty of the University of Dhaka as a lecturer and later the department of political science. He joined Pakistan‚Äôs foreign ministry in 1967 as director-general of the Research Division. Prior to that, he was involved with the formulation of the Tashkent Agreement with India. From 1969 to 1971, he was the Minister of Communications in the Government of Pakistan. He made proposals for establishing a confederation between East Pakistan and West Pakistan. After the separation of East Pakistan as Bangladesh in 1971, Choudhury went into exile. He worked at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England, and later at the Columbia University in New York. He also taught at the North Carolina Central University and Duke University. He returned to Dhaka in 1985, but continued his association with the Columbia University as an adjunct professor till 1994.  Selected works     * = Reception = Richard L. Park, in reviewing Pakistan's Relations with India, 1947-1966, noted that Choudhury's interest is in portraying Pakistan's point of view. The book selectively quotes evidence and authorities that support Pakistan's position. Norman Palmer sees the study as fullest and \\"most satisfactory\\" in its coverage of the historical context, the partition of India and the first decade of relations between India and Pakistan. While Palmer understands the author's \\"pro-Pakistani bias\\" he notes that the analysis is scholarly with the sole exception of the coverage to the 1965 India-Pakistan war. Wayne Wilcox reviews the book as a well-written \\"defense lawyer's brief\\" which gathers a large amount of evidence to convince the jury. Wilcox notes that being written at Cambridge, the book exercises a restrained tone which shows \\"some detachment\\".  Personal life and death  Chowdhury was married to Dilara Choudhury, a professor of political science at Jahangirnagar University, Savar. Together they had two sons, Golam Mabud and Golam Sayeed. Choudhury created Golam Mowla Faima Trust and established a number of charitable institutions in Madaripur district. Chowdhury died, aged 71, on 13 December 1997 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.

It is located in Kathmandu, Nepal, next to Tundikhel. It is located near the Sahid Gate. The temple is at the eastern side of Tundikhel. This temple is also known as Shree Lumadhi Bhadrakali. It is one of the most renowned ‚ÄúShaktipith‚Äù of Nepal. A form of the Goddess Kali, Bhadrakali in Sanskrit means ‚Äúblessed, auspicious, beautiful and prosperous‚Äù and she is also known as ‚ÄúGentle Kali‚Äù. Another name for the goddess is Lazzapith.  History  The temple was built in the year 1817 and was previously known as ‚ÄúMudule Thumpko‚Äù. The temple is believed to be built after Goddess Bhadrakali told the priest to dig the hill where they found her statue. Since then, the temple lies there and is protected by the Nepal Army. It overlooks the Singha Durbar, Prime Ministerial office, on the eastern side.  Legend  Bhadrakali bears influences from the western part of India. The ancient writings in the Vayu Purana and Mahabharat explain the creation of Bhadrakali by the Devi‚Äôs wrath when Daksha insulted Lord Shiva during the great Ashvamedha Yagya (Horse Sacrifice). Tantra Rahasya mentions her rising from the north face of Lord Shiva, (Uttaramnaya Amnayas) which is blue in color and has three eyes. She is believed to take on a terrible aspect that is represented with three eyes and four, twelve or eighteen hands carrying weapons with flames flowing from her head and a small tusk sticking out from her mouth. According to the myths, a farmer used to plough land nearby and kept his food (bread) on the side. The bread used to turn into gold so the temple got its name as Lumarhi/Lumdi Devi‚Äôs temple as Lumdi in Newari means ‚Äògolden bread‚Äô. Goddess Bhadrakali is also widely worshipped in East India during Dusshera Festivals specifically. Deity The main murti is a black stone statue of Bhadrakali and is believed to have been enshrined by the Lichchhavi kings. They are religiously linked to Nepalese Hindus and are looked up to by many people. Festivals The major festival celebrated here is Navratri, which takes place usually during the months of September‚ÄìOctober (as per the traditional Hindu Calendar). People worship the protector goddesses of Lumadhi Ajima, Watu Ajima and Kanga Ajima on three-day increments. Nyatamaru Ajima goddesses Jatra observed during 12 years of Nyata Maru Ajima Pahacharhe is one of the most important festival of Kathmandu. Nepali Army Bhadrakali is the patron Deity of the Nepal Army.

Early life Martha Jane Knowlton Coray was born June 3, 1821 in Covington, Kentucky to Sidney Algernon Knowlton and Harriett Burnham. When she was a child, her parents moved to Ohio and then later to Hancock County, Illinois, where they were living in 1838 when the Mormons were driven out of Missouri. Martha Jane's father employed some of the driven Latter Day Saints and furnished others with houses. She was introduced to Mormonism by George Albert Smith. After listening to sermons by Latter Day Saint leaders, she chose to be baptized a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in January 1840 in the Mississippi River. On February 6, 1841, Martha Jane married Howard Coray. They couple was sealed by Hyrum Smith in July of that same year. They were later resealed in January 1846 by Brigham Young. After their marriage, Martha and Howard taught school together. The couple had 12 children. Traveling Westward In the spring of 1846, Martha Jane and her family left Nauvoo with the majority of the Latter-day Saints to travel west. They stopped for some time to visit Martha Jane's family and work on their farm. In 1848, they moved to the Nishnabotna River, where Martha Jane tended a ferry to provide for her family. In 1850 she finally reached the Salt Lake Valley with the John Sharp Company. The Corays lived in Salt Lake City for four years, until they moved to Tooele, Utah. In 1856, Martha Jane and her family moved to Provo, Utah and experienced many trials. Later in 1871, Martha Jane and her family moved to Mona, Utah to homestead a tract of land, although they kept their home in Provo. Contributions Martha Jane was always active in academia. She assisted her husband in his school teaching when they lived in Nauvoo. In October 1875, Martha Jane was selected by Brigham Young to serve as the first woman trustee for the Board of Directors of Brigham Young Academy. She served as trustee from 1875 until her death in 1881. She was also appointed the first dean of students at Brigham Young Academy. She was the secretary of the first relief societies organized in Salt Lake City. Martha Jane wrote for the Woman's Exponent. =History of Joseph Smith= Martha Jane also contributed greatly to the preservation of the history of the LDS Church, including preserving notes from sermons of Joseph Smith, which church historian Wilford Woodruff consulted when compiling a history of the Church. She also wrote the history of Joseph Smith as dictated by his mother, Lucy Mack Smith. The work was finished at the end of 1845. Her husband Howard received $235 for and $50 in goods for his compiling and transcribing the book; however Martha received nothing for her contributions. Martha Jane Knowlton Coray died on December 14, 1881, in Provo, Utah. she is buried in the Provo City Cemetery. Among those attending her funeral were Wilford Woodruff and Joseph F. Smith.

Like all anemonefishes it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict dominance hierarchy, features which are critical to the direction of gene flow. Description The body of A. leucokranosis is orange or light brown and with a white head bar and a white mark on the top of its head, giving rise to its common name of white bonnet anemonefish. The head band may be continuous or not. They have 9 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 18-19 dorsal soft rays and 13-14 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . Hybridisation There has been a long-standing theory that A. leucokranosis was a naturally occurring hybrid between A. chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos, with the fish being experimentally created in captivity. Its hybrid status was confirmed in 2015 with consistent ecological, morphological and genetic evidence. In any group of anemonefish, there is a strict sized based dominance hierarchy: the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male non-breeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male will change to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest non-breeder becomes the breeding male. This strict sized based dominance hierarchy makes the relative size of the parent species critical in shaping the outcome of hybridization In this regard A. chrysopterus is one of the largest anemonefish, growing to 17 cm in length. while A. sandaracinos is significantly smaller growing up to 11 cm as a female and just 3 to 6.5 cm as a male. There is strong evidence, consistent with their relative size, of the larger A. chrysopterus always being the mother and unidirectional introgression of A. chrysopterus mitochondrial DNA into A. sandaracinos via hybrid backcrosses. Parent species Image:Amphiprion chrysopterus, Vava'eu.jpgA. chrysopterus Image:Amphiprion sandaracinos.jpgA. sandaracinos =Color variations= Being a hybrid A. leucokranosis shows a variety of colors and patterns, with the intermediate morphology of the typical F1 hybrid and backcrosses tending more towards the features of A. sandaracinos. It does not show any melanism when hosted by S. mertensii unlike some species of anemonefish, such as A. clarkii =Similar species= The white mark on top of the head is distinctive. The parent A. sandaracinos has a similar body color, however it has a white stripe on the dorsal ridge from the superior lip to the caudal fin and lacks the white bar on the side of the head. Distribution and habitat Other constraints upon hybridization are overlap in distribution, depth and host anemone. A. leucokranos is found in the Western Central Pacific, on the north coast of New Guinea, including Manus Island, D'Entrecasteaux Islands and New Britain and the Solomon Islands, being the area where the distribution of A. chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos overlap. There is a substantial overlap in depth with all 3 fish found in the range of 1‚Äì10 m. =Host anemones= A. leucokranos is hosted by the following species of anemone: *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone *Heteractis magnifica magnificent sea anemone *Stichodactyla mertensii Mertens' carpet sea anemone At Kimbe Bay A. leucokranos and its parents were primarily found in the host Stichodactyla mertensii otherwise Heteractis crispa.

The flexible approach of QuakeML allows further extensions of the standard in order to represent waveform data, macroseismic information, probability density functions, slip distributions, shake maps, and others. QuakeML is an open standard and is developed by a distributed team in a transparent collaborative manner. Development QuakeML is developed in parallel with a UML representation of its data model. This allows an elaborate software development strategy which uses the UML class model together with a custom UML profile. The XML Schema (XSD) description is created automatically from the UML model with the help of tagged values, which describe the mapping from UML class attributes to XML representation. The UML/XMI description can also be used as a basis for automated creation of a class library using code generators. Suitable programming languages are, e.g., Python, C++, and Java. In this approach, writing and reading QuakeML documents is equivalent to serializing/deserializing QuakeML objects to/from their XML representation. A further possibility would be the serialization/deserialization to/from SQL for persistent storage in a relational database. The QuakeML language definition is supplemented by a concept to provide resource metadata and facilitate metadata exchange between distributed data providers. For that purpose, QuakeML proposes a URI-based format for unique, location-independent identifiers of seismological resources which are assigned by approved naming authorities. In a later development stage, QuakeML will provide a RDF vocabulary for resource metadata description, covering the resource's identity, curation, content, temporal availability, data quality, and associated services. QuakeML proposes to set up a network of registry institutions which offer web services for resolving resource identifiers into corresponding RDF/XML metadata descriptions, and additionally provide means for resource discovery by offering services for searches against resource metadata. Version 1.2 Version 1.2 is the latest stable version QuakeML. Schemas and other documentation for version 1.2 can be found here. This is the version that is used in results of event queries to International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN) web services and is supported by data centers around the world, such as the European Seismic Portal. Version 2.0 QuakeML 2.0 will be the next major version. QuakeML up to version 1.2 covered (only) a basic seismic event description, whereas from v2.0 many new thematic packages will be available, and are currently under development. Currently, the following packages are under development with new first-level elements (child elements of quakeml): *Basic Event Description (BED) *Basic Event Description - Real Time (BED-RT) *Borehole *Hydraulic *Macroseismic *Seismic Source *Site Characterization *Station Characterization *Strong Motion Helper packages that do not define first-level elements: *Basic Event Description Types *Common *Filter *Resource Metadata *Waveform QuakePy tools QuakePy is a Python package designed as a set of tools for statistical analyses of seismological data encoded using QuakeML. It provides a library of classes for earthquake catalog handling and computations, and plot routines for visualizing the obtained results. QuakePy is developed in Python as a fully open-source library, and it is based on multiple other tools such as GMT. Although QuakePy avoids the use of any proprietary software, many tools for Python allow for a MATLAB-like working environment, e.g., IPython.

Retrieved September 1, 2015. TAM manufactures products and provides services used in drilling and completions, well intervention, unconventional resources, and reservoir optimization. L. Bentley Sanford is the Chairman and Michael Machowski is the President. __TOC__ History TAM was incorporated in 1968, in Houston, Texas, as a manufacturer of inflatable packer elements under the name TAM Products, Inc. In 1972, the present owners purchased the company. In 1973, they changed the company name to TAM International, Inc. In 1974, the company added field service tools to its product line. In 1979, TAM developed the Casing Annulus Packer (CAP) product line for annular gas migration control. In 1981, TAM developed a hydrological test tool for use in modeling the various aquifers at the Hanford Nuclear Site in Washington. The tool was a multiple packer configuration that allowed selective open hole testing of a distinct test interval. In addition, short intervals were isolated above and below to allow pressure monitoring to verify isolation within the test interval. Accurate pressure and temperature gauges were included in each interval with surface readout via mono conductor wireline attached to the work string. Successful operations at Hanford led to the development of larger tools for use in the Nevada Test Site, Mercury, Nevada, where extensive testing of various strata and aquifers was performed in evaluation of fluid movement to qualify the site for possible high level radioactive waste materials storage. Similar tools were utilized in the Carlsbad, New Mexico site and used to qualify that site for storage of low level radioactive waste materials such as received from medical applications. With the overview of these sites by the USGS, an extensive effort was made in using open hole straddle test tools by the USGS Earthquake Studies group in Menlo Park, California. The stress testing technique was developed with the assistance of a variety of scientific organizations to better understand earth stresses and how these tests might help in prediction of earthquakes. In an attempt to better understand plate tectonics, permanent installations were installed by the USGS near the San Andreas Fault onshore California as well as in deep water offshore areas of interest such as Washington, Hawaii, Japan, Costa Rica and other areas around the world. These multiple zone isolated and monitored installations were installed in water depths greater than 10,000‚Äô through the Ocean Drilling Program, managed by Texas A&M; University.

Villa Kampen is a villa situated in Midtbyen in central Aarhus, in the affluent neighbourhood around Strandvejen south of the neighbourhood Marselisborg. It lies next to Havreballe Forest behind it and to the west, with an east-facing view of Tangkrogen and the Bay of Aarhus in front of it and the Marselisborg Forests visible on the hills to the south. The building and the surrounding estate was listed on 2 March 1983 by the precursor to the Danish Heritage Agency.  History  Hack Kampmann (September 6, 1856 ‚Äì June 27, 1920) was a prolific Danish architect in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who made many public and private works across Denmark during his career. Kampmann was originally trained as bricklayer but in 1873 he went to study at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he graduated in 1878. In 1887 he began his career as an architect and in 1892 he was appointed the Royal Building Inspector of Northern Jutland and he moved his family to Aarhus. Architecturally Kampmann have had a significant impact on Aarhus. Between 1898 and 1902 he built the National Business Archives and Marselisborg Palace and later went on to build the Custom House and Aarhus Theatre. He was a proponent of the National Romantic style which most of his buildings in Aarhus bear witness to. In 1901 he commenced construction on a private home for him and his family on a hill by the coast, south of the city centre.  Architecture  Villa Kampen was originally situated next to an identical building, built by Kampmann for a bank president, which has since been torn down. The villa is strongly inspired by British architecture of the time and in particular the works of Charles Voysey. The building appears symmetrical from the outside but on the inside the layout of rooms and walls are highly asymmetrical, a typical component of villas in England during this period. Villa Kampen was constructed on a small hill between forests and the ocean and it was designed in cooperation with the landscape architect Edvard Gl√¶sel. The overall design seeks to incorporate and complement the surroundings in an unobtrusive way; the hilly terrain has been preserved and used to make it seem as if the building rises out of the bedrock, shapes are irregular with oriels and arched windows and the estate is enclosed by a wall of small boulders. Villa Kampen is in two floors with large, bright rooms. It's roofed in red glazed tile and the outer walls are bricks of lime and sandstone, plastered and originally painted white (grey today) with espalier. It sits on a foundation of granite and boulders and is topped with a hip roof. The roof has a cornice consisting of a canopy with visible rafters. There are two arched oriel windows in the front with a balcony between them and another, larger balcony in the back. The buildings is adorned with columns and many minor details in the brick-work testifying to Kampmanns background as a bricklayer.

Only a handful occur on the east coast. There are several concentrations of fish traps on the Hessequa coast between Gouritsmond, 30 km east of Stilbaai, and Witsand, 35 km to the southwest. These fish traps are constructed in such a way that they form pools of varying size in the intertidal zone. They operate on the principle that at high tide during new-moon (i.e. dark-moon) spring tides, fish swim over the walls to feed. As the water recedes with the turn of the tide, the fish get trapped in the enclosure. It is then an easy matter to remove the fish from the almost dry trap. Prehistoric roots Stilbaai's fish traps are still- working relics from the past, both the recent and very distant past. Most of the existing fish traps that we can still see, have been built during the past 300 years, some as recently as the latter part of the 20th century, whilst others, according to Avery, could date as far back as 3,000 years ago, but he stresses that this does not preclude a possibly of an even more ancient origin.Avery, Graham (1975). Discussion on the age and use of tidal fish-traps (visvywers).,South African Archaeological Bulletin, Volume 30 The evolution of fishing stretches back much further than 3,000 years ago. From an analysis of the Middle Stone Age layers at Blombos Cave, Klasiesrivier, Die Kelders, Herolds Bay, Sea Harvest and Hoedjies Punt, it appears that sea food, including fish, has been part of the human diet for a very long time - at least 100,000 years ago. One of the easiest ways of harvesting fish, would have been gathering those stranded in natural tidal pools after the turn of the tide. Enhancing the fish-trapping properties of tidal pools by a few well- placed stones would be a logical next step, followed eventually by man-made pools. Thus, while it is unknown exactly when the tradition of building and repacking tidal fish traps originated, it is most likely that it dates back to the Middle Stone Age (which stretched from about 250,000 to 25,000 years ago). More recent history Eyewitness accounts by some of the first European settlers report how Khoi built, maintained and used tidal fish traps. Construction The tidal fish traps consist of low walls of boulders and pebbles constructed across gullies or other suitable localities within the intertidal zone. Where no gullies or big rocks are present, complete artificial enclosures may be built. A trap site usually consists of a series of traps ranging in size from about 10 m¬≤ to as big as half a football field.Kemp, Lucy Valeska (2007). Ancient stonewall fish traps on the south coast of South Africa Traps are only efficient if the stones are packed in a certain way. The wall must form a virtually solid wall with a horizontal top, built to a level which would be covered by at least 0.5‚Äì1.0 m of water as the waves come in at spring high tide. The landward face tends to be vertical while the seaward face usually is sloped. This provides less resistance and turbulence to incoming waves and therefore more subtle access to fish. As a certain amount of displacement occurs through wave action, repacking of the walls is necessary after each spring tide. Today this is done by some local farmers and interested people who also use the traps to catch fish at spring tide.

Early life Wright was born Alexandra Vesty in Melbourne on 25 February 1948. Adopted by a couple from Adelaide, she studied educational psychology at Adelaide University. Career At the Theatre Royal at Stratford East, Clare Venables gave Wright the opportunity to direct professionally. Subsequently, Wright became an artistic director at the Liverpool Playhouse. At the Royal Court Theatre Wright directed Sarah Daniels‚Äô Masterpieces, a play dealing with pornography,See also Elaine Aston. Feminist Views on the English Stage: Women Playwrights, 1990-2000. Cambridge UP, 2003. pg. 39. which, in 1998, the National Theatre selected as a representative play of the 1980s in its NT2000 list of ‚ÄúOne Hundred Plays of the Century‚Äù In 1984 Wright directed the WPT‚Äôs opening production, Aphra Behn's 1686 play The Lucky Chance. The cast included Harriet Walter, Alan Rickman, Pam Ferris, Kathryn Pogson and Denis Lawson. Design was by Jenny Tiramani and music composed by Ilona Sekacz. In 1995 Wright worked again on a play by Behn, the first English woman professional playwright, when she directed The Rover for the BBC/Open University. Wright has been described as outspoken and a feminist. She took the Arts Council to court to challenge their funding cuts; she directed Julie Covington as Lady Macbeth in a controversial Macbeth at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, a production that largely exonerated Lady Macbeth from blame; her production of The Revenger's Tragedy for the Sydney Theatre Company (STC) in 1991 was considered to besee, for example, Elizabeth Schafer, 'Performance Editions, Editing and Editors', Shakespeare Survey 59 2011 pp.198-212 clinical in its dissection of the misogyny portrayed in the play and how that misogyny distorts the play‚Äôs characters. She also directed a Caryl Churchill double bill‚ÄîHot Fudge and Ice Cream‚Äîfor the STC in 1990. In the early 1990s, Wright took on a disused hydraulic power station in Wapping and established the Wapping Project arts centre. Designed by Josh Wright this became a gallery, performance space, and restaurant. Famous for the parties, events and installations that took place there, the Wapping Project ran until 2013. She was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by Bristol University in 2012 Personal life She married Josh Wright‚Äîwhom she met at school in Adelaide‚Äîin 1967 and came with him to the UK in 1973., where he worked as an architect while Wright studied for a PhD at Bristol University researching psychology, performance and place. Their marriage was dissolved, but they remarried in 2015, four days before her death from cancer. Wright trained as a clinical psychologist working with anorexia patients.

D. deserti and other Deinococcaceae exhibit an extraordinary ability to withstand ionizing radiation.  Description  Deinococcus deserti has in common with other Deinococci a highly condensed nucleoid, a high cellular Mn/Fe ratio, and several of the Deinococcus specific radiation tolerance-associated genes, for example, ddrA to ddrD, pprA, and irrE. The genome of D. deserti VCD115 is composed of four replicons: a main chromosome (2.82 Mb) and three plasmids, P1 (325 kb), P2 (314 kb) and P3 (396 kb).  History  Two gamma- and UV- radiation-tolerant strains were isolated from a mixture of sand samples collected in the Sahara Desert in Morocco and Tunisia, after exposure of the sand to 15 kGy gamma radiation. The strains did not grow on rich medium such as trypticase soy broth (TSB), but did grow as whitish colonies on tenfold- diluted TSB. The genotypic and phenotypic properties allowed differentiation from recognized Deinococcus species. The strains were therefore identified as representing a novel species, for which the name Deinococcus deserti sp. nov. is proposed. Radioresistance  Chromosomes with numerous radiation or desiccation-induced double-strand breaks can be repaired in a few hours in D. deserti. The extreme radiotolerance of Deinococcaceae was the object of intense investigations using D. radiodurans as model.  Mechanisms of Radioresistance  In cells subjected to irradiation, DNA recombinase, RecA, was the first protein that was found strongly induced. RecA is essential for radiotolerance and for the fidelity of DNA repair and genome stability in D. radiodurans. The molecular mechanisms underlying DNA repair were also examined by transcriptomics leading to the description of a repertoire of genes responding to acute gamma irradiation, including genes involved in DNA replication, repair and recombination, cell wall metabolism, cellular transport and many with uncharacterized functions. In previous microarray experiments with D. radiodurans, the five most highly radio-induced genes were the Deinococcus-specific genes ddrA, ddrB, ddrC, ddrD, and pprA. Their homologs in D. deserti were also among the most highly induced, showing that not only their presence but also their strong upregulation in response to radiation damage is conserved. A common 17-base pair radiation/desiccation response motif (RDRM) has been identified upstream of a set of radiation- induced genes, including various DNA repair genes such as recA, gyrA, uvrB and ssb, strongly suggesting the presence of an RDR regulon that is conserved in Deinococcus species. The irrE gene is essential for radiation resistance and required for the radiation-induced expression of recA and other genes with an RDRM (radiation/desiccation response motif) site in D. radiodurans and D. deserti. DdrO could be the global regulator of the RDR regulon, because it is the only induced and conserved regulator gene preceded by an RDRM site in D. radiodurans, D. geothermalis and D. deserti. IrrE is a site-specific protease that cleaves and inactivates repressor DdrO, resulting in induced expression of genes required for DNA repair and cell survival after exposure to radiation. RecAC and RecAP are functional proteins that allow repair of massive DNA damage after exposure of D. deserti to high doses of gamma and UV radiation. ImuY and DnaE2 are involved in UV-induced point mutagenesis.  Evolution of Radioresistance  The evolution of organisms that are able to survive acute irradiation doses of 15,000 Gy is difficult to explain given the apparent absence of highly radioactive habitats on Earth over geologic time. Thus, it seems more likely that the natural selection pressure for the evolution of radiation-resistant bacteria was chronic exposure to nonradioactive forms of DNA damage, in particular those promoted by desiccation.  Proteomics  Accurate genome annotation of its 3455 genes was guided at the stage of primary annotation by an extensive proteome analysis. A set of 1348 proteins was uncovered after growth in standard conditions and proteome fractionation by phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. In this study, 664 N-terminal peptides from 341 proteins were characterized, leading to the validation of 278 and the correction of 63 translation initiation codons in the D. deserti VCD115 genome. Four new open reading frames were also detected in its genome through the detection of peptidic signatures for the corresponding polypeptides. Peptides were identified using the MASCOT search engine against a database consisting of a six-frame translation of the entire D. deserti genome. This database comprised 65,801 hypothetical protein sequences with a large fraction of short ORFs (68% of the ORFs have less than 80 residues). At this stage, 557 have signatures matched the N termini of 278 different proteins previously annotated. 1119 polypeptides from D. deserti were predicted to contain a signal peptide either by the neural networks or hidden Markov model approaches. A total of 341 protein N termini were confidently identified in the D. deserti TMPP-labeled proteome. Among these, 63 were not correctly annotated in the first D. deserti genome annotation and should be modified accordingly. There has been a comparison between the gene sequences of the three sequenced Deinococcus genomes. It is proposed that the N termini of 37 and 100 additional proteins from D. geothermalis and D. radiodurans genomes, respectively, should be reannotated. When considering the manually validated TMPP-modified peptides, 664 unique signatures for N termini were identified with 398 tryptic and 266 chymotryptic sequences. These two digestions were thus found to be complementary. The N termini data set corresponds to 10% of the theoretical proteome. A significant number of erroneous annotations have probably still to be corrected.

The number of his lyric works is 539 works in Egyptian Opera, operetta, cinematic and religious song, poem, Taqtouqa and Mawalia. The number of song poets who he composed for is more than 120 poets. He composed for many famous Arab singers like:Umm Kulthum, Fairouz (yet to be released), Asmahan, Warda Al-Jazairia, Najat Al Saghira, Mounira El Mahdeya, Fayza Ahmed, Saleh Abdel Hai, Souad Mohamed, Aziza Galal (who was the last singer to sing one of his melodies) and others. Biography Sunbati was the first born boy after eight girls in a family in the city of Faraskur, Damietta Governorate, Egypt on 30 November 1906. His father was a singer, singing in the mawlids, weddings and religious holidays in the nearby villages and towns. Riad used to listen to his father playing the oud and singing. When he was nine, his father caught him outside the school, hiding at the carpenter's sawmill playing the oud and singing Sayed Darwish, and decided to take him to sing in the weddings with him. The father didn't stay put in Faraskur but travelled with his family to Mansoura, Dakahlia, so the young Riad was placed in a kuttab school. However, his studies didn't interest him as much as music did. =The musical beginning= When Sunbati was nine he got a disease in his eyes which made it hard to read, so he gave up studying and his father started teaching him the basic principles of music and its rhythms instead. Sunbati showed a remarkable talent, and became the star of the band and its lead singer. Soon he earned himself the nickname Bulbul al-Mansoura ÿ®ŸÑÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿµŸàÿ±ÿ© (The nightingale of Mansoura). When, Sayed Darwish first heard Sunbati he invited him to come with him to Alexandria to have better chances, but Sunbati's father refused; he was depending on him in his band. =Musical career= In 1928, Sunbati the father moved to Cairo with Riad, thinking that Riad deserved to prove himself in the artistic life, just like Umm Kulthum whose father was friend to Riad's father before moving to Cairo. In this year, Sunbati began a new stage in his life, he registered at the Arab Music Institute, and was appointed as a teacher for playing the oud and singing. From here, his fame grew, and his name began to appear in the celebrations of the institute as a skilled player. However, he stayed for only three years, after which he quit and decided to enter the world of composing. His first composition was a poem of Ahmed Shawqi which was composed and sung later by Mohammed Abdel Wahab (Maqadeer men Jafnayky), he also worked as an oudist and a vocalist in Mohamed abdelwahab's takht (ensemble) where he appears in his song ElNile Nagachi in the movie Alwarda AlBeyda. In the early 1930s, he started working with Audion records, a major egyptian recording studio where he recorded various taqsims of his own. Audion (ÿ£ŸàÿØŸäŸàŸÜ) company introduced him as a composer for its famous singers like: Saleh Abdel Hai, Abdel-Ghani Al Sayed, Rajaa Abdo and Najat Ali. In 1979, Riad Al Sunbati received the prestigious UNSECO International Music Prize as a performer of the Oud becoming the first person from the middle east and the only Egyptian to receive that award. He was also known for his unique and original taqsims which are famous for being the most authentic Arabic taqsims of that periods which are widely used as a model of maqam music in middle- eastern music schools, a collection of his taqsims on major Arabic maqams was recorded later in his career. One of his most famous instrumental compositions is \\"longa riad\\" (also known as \\"longa sultani yigah\\") which is considered to be the most famous Arabic longa which was played by many western and Turkish orchestras and oudists. Relation to Umm Kulthum In the middle of the 1930s, Umm Kulthum became more and more famous across the Egyptian countryside and therefore Riad was looking forward to meeting her. Their first meeting occurred by chance at a train station. Riad Al Sunbati composed for Umm Kulthum for the first time, in the song Ala Balad El-Mahboub ÿπŸÑŸâ ÿ®ŸÑÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≠ÿ®Ÿàÿ® (To the Country of the Beloved) in 1935 for her movie Wedad, and although Umm Kulthum refused to sing the song in the film she recorded it after the great success of the song. Her recording in turn which was a huge success. As a result, he then joined her artistic team, which included Mohamed El Qasabgi and Zakariyya Ahmad becoming her youngest composer at that time. He worked with Umm Kulthum in many of their songs for her films such as \\"ifrah ya Aalbi\\" ÿ•ŸÅÿ±ÿ≠ Ÿäÿß ŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä which was considered to be the song where he developed his unique style. He composed over 200 songs for her, more than any other composer had. At the same time he composed Arab poems, which almost all other composers failed to do, so he deserved the name he was given from Umm Kulthum 'The Genius'. He was also one of the only composers whom Umm Kulthum highly respected his opinions and agreed to all his remarks and compositions. He composed many classical master pieces for Umm Kulthum such as Robaa'eyat El Khayyam, the highly appreciated Persian poem of Omar Khayyam which was translated by Ahmed Rami to Arabic. He also composed many religious songs becoming the best composer of religious songs as Mohammed Abdel Wahab described him. One of his most known songs is \\"Zikrayat\\" whose overture is considered to be one of the longest in Arabic music and even longer than Abdelwahab's Inta Omri. Riad Al Sunbati used to record most of his compositions for Umm Kulthum in his own voice on separate discs as his first musical career has been singing =Al-Atlal= The song Al-Atlal ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ∑ŸÑÿßŸÑ (The Ruins) is one of the Arab music classics. Many critics considered it 'The Crown of the Arab Song' and the best 20th century Arab song. It is considered by many the best of what Umm Kulthum sang, and the best of what Sunbati composed.Umm Kulthum sang Al-Atlal in 1966 after two years from Mohammed Abdel Wahab's first song to Umm Kulthum, Inta Omri ÿ•ŸÜÿ™ ÿπŸÖÿ±Ÿä (You are My Life), and it had the same huge success. Acting career 1952 was the start of Sunbati's acting career when he took the leading role with Huda Sultan in the film \\"Habeeb Alby\\" (The love of my heart) becoming his first and last experience as an actor. He later refused other roles as an actor as he preferred his job as a composer as he believed \\"Acting was not his thing\\". He also wrote the musical score for the film as well as the song \\"Fadel Youmeen\\" (Two days left) he performed in the film.

In 1903 he married Margaret Ann Barker in Burnley, Lancashire, and with her had two children, Bernard and Lionel. They lived together at 18 Tolver Road in Penzance, Cornwall.1911 UK Census  Police career  = Oldham Borough Constabulary = Kenyon began his police career in November 1893, joining the Oldham Borough Constabulary as a Third-Class Constable. He was noted for showing tact and vigilance early on in his career, with the arrest of a large number of prolific offenders.\\"New Chief Constable of Penzance\\" Cornishman 19 March 1908 He was a constable for four and a half years before taking a sergeant's exam, and scored the highest marks out of 156 candidates. On becoming a sergeant he was also appointed an inspector of weights and measures, common lodging houses, hackney carriages and explosives. He also regulated business at the Quarter Sessions and annual Brewster Sessions. Kenyon was noted for being an effective organiser of crowd control, demonstrating his skills during elections, trades disputes, strikes and Royal visits. During his career as a sergeant he also passed the Board of Trade exam for full qualification as an Inspector of Weights and Measures. = Burnley Borough Police = In November 1898 Kenyon applied for the position of Inspector at the Burnley Borough Police. He was successful, and a large number of duties came under his control at his new appointment, including the training of recruits, taking and preparing evidence, and book-keeping. Common with police forces of the era, Kenyon was also held the dual role of Superintendent of the Burnley Fire Brigade. Whilst at Burnley, he traveled to London to undertake a course in fingerprint identification at Scotland Yard. = Penzance Borough Police = In 1908 Kenyon successfully attained the post of Head Constable of the Penzance Borough Police, succeeding Superintendent Richard Nicholas, who had retired. Kenyon used his previous experience as a director of fire-fighting to good use, no less in 1936 when the village of Newlyn suffered a series of thatched-roof fires. During the First World War he enforced offences under the Defence of the Realm Act 1914, including the prosecution of military men caught drunk when off duty (which was prohibited under the Act) and cases of sailors absent without leave, which would cause vital disruption to military operations on the sea.Cornishman 29 July 1915 On 8 February 1917 Solly Tiskofsky, a Russian-born British soldier, handed himself in at the Penzance police station and notified them he was an absentee. Tiskofsky had absconded from the Army and stowed away on the SS Crown Point, which was subsequently torpedoed.Cornishman 22 February 1917 Having landed with the survivors at Penzance, he had nowhere else to go, and so turned himself in. Head Constable Kenyon handed him over to the military authorities. In the inter-war years, Kenyon inaugurated a period of growth and organisation for the force, with Kenyon becoming a well-respected member in society and a keen socialite. He became known for hosting lavish Charity Balls in the concert hall at St. John‚Äôs Hall. On 29 June 1929 Kenyon was assaulted whilst off duty by Penzance resident Charles Lavers. On the evening of the 29th, Kenyon was playing bowls with some friends when he was approached on the bowling green by Lavers, who shouted he (Kenyon) was wanted by \\"the Queen's Shades.\\" Kenyon told Lavers to go away and said he would speak to him after the game had finished, but Lavers set upon Kenyon quite violently, with both men struggling to the ground. Bystanders came to the assistance of the Head Constable and assisted him in binding Lavers' hands and feet with rope. Such was his struggling that they kept him bound and conveyed him to the police station in a wheelbarrow. Lavers was charged in court with assault and sentenced to two months imprisonment.\\"Penzance Police Court\\" Cornishman 4 July 1929 From May to September 1934, Kenyon noticed amounts of money disappearing from a drawer in his office. The money was stored in the drawer and logged in a book whenever a member of the public handed in found cash to the police station, and had been disappearing ten shillings at a time. Kenyon noticed that the cash had been signed out by one of his officers, a Police Constable Henry Palmer, with the name and address of the owner of the money entered into the book. Kenyon queried the log book entries and discovered that false owner details had been entered. Mr Palmer was questioned as to these discrepancies and admitted he had taken the money, and entered false details into the book, including the forging of signatures. He was dismissed from his job, and charged with five counts of larceny in court. Based on Palmer's honesty in admitting the crime, and the hardship he had suffered since losing his job, Kenyon pleaded for leniency and suggested he be spared prison and fined instead. The jury imposed a ¬£30 fine on Mr Palmer and he was released on bail, with a seven-day deadline for paying the fine, or he would be sent to prison.\\"Penzance Constable's Thefts\\" Cornishman 4 October 1934 On 14 December 1934 Kenyon's men seized fifty cars in the district as the result of a round-up of a gang of car thieves who were operating from London.Saundry's One and All Almanac 1936  Later career & death  Kenyon retired on 31 December 1936, and was succeeded by Robert Cyril Morton Jenkins, former Inspector of the Canterbury City Police.

He also continued in his role as Inspector of Weights and Measures. In December 1937, Kenyon encouraged Chief Constable Jenkins to host a charity ball at St John's Hall, the headquarters of the Penzance Borough Police.

Based in Buffalo, New York, along with his brother, Frank, Charles was the founder and president of several companies, including the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, Great Southern Lumber Company, Goodyear Lumber Co., Buffalo & Susquehanna Coal and Coke Co., and the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad Company. In the late 19th century, his brother and he were highly successful in harvesting timber from formerly isolated areas of Pennsylvania and New York. They built railroad spurs to provide access to the properties and local sawmills, using the railroads to transport lumber to market. In the early 20th century, they used this same strategy in the South. They bought several hundred thousand acres of virgin pine forest in Louisiana and Mississippi, built the largest sawmill in the world, and developed the company town of Bogalusa, Louisiana, for the workers to support their operation. They also built a railroad to serve the operation and connect it to markets. Goodyear was also a director of Marine National Bank, and of General Railway Signal. Early life Charles W. Goodyear was born in Cortland, New York, on October 15, 1846, to Dr. Bradley Goodyear (1816‚Äì1889), who had graduated from Geneva Medical College in 1845, and Esther P. (Kinne) Goodyear (1822‚Äì1907). Her ancestors came to the United States via Leyden, Holland, in 1635. A younger brother, Frank Henry, was born in 1849. Goodyear was educated at Cortland Academy, Wyoming Academy, and in East Aurora, New York, when his father was practicing medicine there. As boys, both Charles and Frank worked at Root & Keating's tannery. Career In 1868, Goodyear moved to Buffalo to study law in the offices of Laning & Miller, and later with John C. Strong. Goodyear was admitted to the New York State Bar Association in 1871 and began his own practice in Buffalo. His practice continued until 1875, when he formed a partnership with Major John Tyler, which continued for two years. From 1877 until 1882, Goodyear practiced alone until forming a partnership with Henry F. Allen (1837‚Äì1910) under the name Goodyear & Allen. In 1883, when Grover Cleveland became Governor of New York and stepped down from Cleveland, Bissell, and Sicard, Goodyear joined as a name partner. The firm was renamed Bissell, Sicard & Goodyear. The practice with Bissell, Sicard & Goodyear lasted for the next four years. =Political career= From January 1, 1875, until October 15, 1877, Goodyear served as assistant district attorney under District Attorney of Erie County Daniel N. Lockwood. Elected to the United States Congress in 1876, Lockwood resigned the office of district attorney in the autumn of 1877, and Governor Lucius Robinson appointed Goodyear as DA to fill the unexpired term until January 1, 1878. =Business career= Pulp and paper mill in foreground at Bogalusa, Louisiana, sawmill in background Goodyear gave up the practice of law in 1887 to form a lumber company with his brother, Frank H. Goodyear, under the firm name F. H. & C. W. Goodyear. They invested in timberlands, lumber mills, coal, and railroads in remote areas of Pennsylvania and New York. They bought up large tracts of timberland that were considered inaccessible for harvest, because the lands were isolated and away from the streams that were typically used to transport logs. To access the timber, they built railroad spurs for transport, and local sawmills to process the trees into lumber. In many areas, they built company towns for workers in the isolated sawmills. They achieved great financial success with these strategies.James Elliott Defebaugh. 1907. History of the Lumber Industry of America, Volume 2. The American Lumberman: Chicago.. Retrieved 23 November 2013 The Goodyears were the world's largest manufacturers of hemlock lumber, with an annual output around 200,000,000 board feet of hemlock, and nearly as much in hardwood. In the late 1890s as the lumber business expanded, Goodyear joined his brother's Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, which Frank had created in 1893 by the merger and consolidation of several smaller logging railroads.Pennsylvania State Archives http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/Bah/DAM/mg/mg457.htm When Goodyear joined, Frank stepped down as president of the railroad and assumed the positions of first vice president and chairman of the board. Charles Goodyear became second vice president and general manager of the railroad, while Marlin Olmsted became president. The Goodyear sawmill in Austin, Pennsylvania Between 1901 and 1905, the brothers moved South, purchasing 300,000 acres of virgin yellow pine timberland in southeastern Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi, near the southern end of the Pearl River. In 1902, the brothers chartered the Great Southern Lumber Company in Pennsylvania,Great Southern Lumber Company Collection, LSU Libraries Retrieved 20 November 2013 establishing their offices in the Ellicott Square Building in downtown Buffalo. The brothers began construction of the Great Southern Lumber Company sawmill, which was the largest sawmill in the world, in southeast Louisiana, and developed the company town of Bogalusa, where workers and their supervisors and families would live. It was designed and built from the ground up, to include hotels, classes of housing, churches, schools, YMCA and YWCA, and similar services. To bring harvested trees to the sawmill and transport processed lumber to markets, the Goodyears established the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad,Mississippi Rails: New Orleans Great Northern Railroad. Retrieved 23 November 2013 which connected Bogalusa to the national railroad network and to New Orleans. In 1906, the brothers extended the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad from Wellsville to Buffalo, nearly 90 miles. Frank Goodyear did not live to see the Bogalusa sawmill completed, dying in 1907 of Bright's disease, shortly before the Panic of 1907. The Great Southern Lumber Company sawmill began operation in 1908. Goodyear took over for Frank at the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, among other companies they owned. He appointed William H. Sullivan as the general manager of the Great Southern Lumber Company and town boss of Bogalusa. After the city was incorporated, Sullivan served as mayor until his death in 1929. At various points in his career, Goodyear was president of: Goodyear Lumber Co., Buffalo & Susquehanna Coal and Coke Co., Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad, Great Southern Lumber Company, and the New Orleans Great Northern Railroad Company; and director of the Marine National Bank, and General Railway Signal. Personal life Ella in one of the dresses that she wore when Charles and she were guests of President and Mrs. Grover Cleveland in the White House On March 23, 1876, Goodyear married Ella Portia Conger (1853‚Äì1940), of Collins Center, New York. The family lived at the Charles W. Goodyear House, built in 1903 by architect E.B. Green of Green & Wicks, at 888 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. Together, they had four children, all born in Buffalo: * Anson Conger Goodyear (1877‚Äì1964), who married Mary Forman (1879‚Äì1973). * Esther Permelia Goodyear (1881‚Äì1955), who married Arnold Brooks Watson (b. 1877) in 1910. * Charles Waterhouse Goodyear II (1883‚Äì1967), who married Grace Rumsey (1883‚Äì1963), sister of Charles Cary Rumsey, in 1908. They divorced, and in 1935, Charles married Marion Spaulding. * Bradley Goodyear Sr. (1885‚Äì1959), who married Jeanette Bissell (1886‚Äì1983). Goodyear, a member of the Presbyterian Church, held office of trustee of the Buffalo Normal School, was organizing director of the Pan-American Exposition, president of the Buffalo Club (in 1899), trustee to the Buffalo Historical Society, on the board of The Buffalo Fine Arts Academy and a delegate to Syracuse Convention. Among his close friends were U.S. President Grover Cleveland and Cleveland's Secretary of War Daniel S. Lamont. He was widely considered instrumental in Cleveland receiving the nomination for President of the United States while Governor of New York. Goodyear and his wife were the first guests of President Cleveland at the White House. Goodyear died in Buffalo, New York, on April 16, 1911 and is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo along with his father, mother, brother, wife, and son. =Frank H. Goodyear= Charles W. Goodyear's brother, Frank Henry Goodyear, married Josephine Looney in 1871. Frank had been working at Looneyville as a bookkeeper for Josephine's father, Robert Looney, a native of the Isle of Man. Looney ran a farm, sawmill, general store, and feed and grain business, and owned vast timberlands in Pennsylvania. When her father died the next year, Josephine and Frank inherited the timberlands from her father's estate. Frank, who had already moved to Buffalo before Looney's death, used the inheritance to start the lumber business and enterprises that his brother and he eventually would run. Josephine died in October 1915 of a heart attack at the Exchange Street Station. She was remembered as the benefactress of the convalescent home for children named after her in Williamsville, New York.

Founded in 1962 by Timothy Tow, FEBC is the fourth oldest Bible college in the country. The current principal is Jeffrey Khoo. The college motto is \\"Holding forth the Word of Life\\" (Phil 2:16) and \\"Holding fast the Faithful Word\\" (Titus 1:9). History Far Eastern Bible College was established on 17 September 1962 as an autonomous institution independent of ecclesiastical control. It shares premises with the Life Bible-Presbyterian Church (LBPC), but the two organisations had a falling out over a doctrinal issue. In 2008, the church sued the college over what it considered to be \\"deviant Bible teachings\\", and sought to force FEBC to leave the Gilstead Road premises. The FEBC faculty had been promoting a doctrine known as \\"Verbal Plenary Preservation\\", which states that the text of Scripture has been perfectly preserved. However the church failed as the Court of Appeal, the apex court in the Singapore legal system, held on 26 April 2011 that (i) ‚Äúthe VPP doctrine is actually closely related to the VPI doctrine which both parties [i.e., FEBC and LBPC ] adhere to,‚Äù (rejecting LBPC's contention in [59] of the Court of Appeal Judgement that it is ‚Äúan entirely different creature from the VPI doctrine\\");‚Äù (ii) ‚Äúthe College, in adopting the VPP doctrine, has not deviated from the fundamental principles which guide and inform the work of the College right from its inception, and as expressed in the Westminster Confession‚Äù; (iii) ‚Äú[i]t is not inconsistent for a Christian who believes fully in the principles contained within the Westminster Confession (and the VPI [Verbal Plenary Inspiration] doctrine) to also subscribe to the VPP doctrine‚Äù; and (iv) ‚Äú[i]n the absence of anything in the Westminster Confession that deals with the status of the apographs, we [the Court] hesitate to find that the VPP doctrine is a deviation from the principles contained within the Westminster Confession.See also Khoo Jeffrey and others v Life Bible-Presbyterian Church and others Doctrine Far Eastern Bible College subscribes to the system of theology called \\"Reformed\\" as expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith, and its Larger and Shorter Catechisms (1643-1648). The college rejects the documentary hypothesis, source criticism, Form criticism, and redaction criticism. Culture =College anthem= The \\"FEBC Anthem\\" was written by the founding principal to music composed by M. D. Buell and arranged by Dave Haas. The early years of hardships and difficulties moved the founding principal to write the lyrics while on a train journey from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur in 1966. =Dean Burgon Oath= Since 1979, the Dean Burgon Oath has been taken by members of the Board of Directors and Faculty at every annual convocation to publicly affirm their allegiance to the Bible: > I swear in the name of the triune God‚ÄîFather, Son and Holy Spirit‚Äîthat the > Bible is none other than the voice of Him that sitteth upon the throne. > Every book of it, every chapter of it, every verse of it, every word of it, > every syllable of it, every letter of it, is the direct utterance of the > Most High.

On the apical third the black and gray dots are formed into narrow streaks or dashes radiating to the outer edge and extending over the cilia. There are three small black dots of raised scales, one on the costa at the inner fourth, one in the cell just before the outer end and one on the median line beyond the cell. There is a considerable degree of variation between specimens, some are so heavily overlaid with the secondary color that the ground color is reduced to three narrow streaks, one just below the costa, one along the median line and the lower one in fold, these only extending to the end of the cell with just a bare indication of the ground color on the outer half between the nearly parallel radiating lines of the secondary color. In other specimens the ground color occupies more than half of the inner half and extending down to the inner margin. The hindwings are light gray. The larvae feed on Artemisia canadensis. They web together the terminal leaves and partially excavate the tip of the twig and feed close to the bases of the leaves.Journal of the New York Entomological Society 11: 160 References Category:Scrobipalpula Category:Moths described in 1903 ","title":"Scrobipalpula artemisiella"},{"id":"47714924","text":"Andris Smirnovs (born 6 February 1990) is a Latvian cyclist riding for .

Background and education James Oluleye completed his primary education in 1946 and thereafter taught for two years at St. Michael's School, Ikoro-Ekiti, and for a year at Anglican Primary School, Araromi Ago-Owu near Ikira in Oyo State. He later attended Ibadan Archdeaconry Teacher Training College where he obtained his Teaching Certificates (Grades II and III). Military career Oluleye enlisted in the Nigerian Military Force (which later became the Royal Nigerian Army in 1960) with the enlistment number NMF/1003 on September 9, 1959. He had his basic military training at the Regular Officers Special Training School, Teshie, Ghana from September 1959 to March 1960. He later underwent officer training at Mons Officer Cadet School, Aldershot, England in 1960. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Nigerian Army on January 6, 1961.

Lopatin and Ford (who had made electronic music together since their school days) produced That We Can Play in an apartment studio, using vintage synthesizers and sequencers to recapture the sound and style of 1980s power pop. That We Can Play contains six songs, including four original Games tracks (one, the opener \\"Strawberry Skies\\", with vocals by Laurel Halo). It also has two remixes: a remix of \\"Strawberry Skies\\" by the Chicago duo Gatekeeper and a reprise of a song by Canadian musician CFCF. The EP, released in November 2010 on the Hippos in Tanks label, was promoted with music videos and singles. It was well received by critics, who appreciated the duo's use of its 1980s power-pop influences, and made the top ten of MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear's year-end list. Background Ford and Lopatin, who met in a science class, began playing music together in high school. During their practice sessions they experimented with electronic music using a Roland Juno-60 (belonging to Lopatin's father) and their high school's Ensoniq SQ-2, which Ford used as a drum machine. During these sessions, the two became serious about composing electronic music together. For a time they had separate careers, with Ford moving to New York City to play in soft-rock group Tigercity and Lopatin remaining in Boston to produce and compose music as Oneohtrix Point Never. In the summer of 2009, they developed an idea for a group they called \\"Games\\" after what Lopatin described as \\"an intense 72-hour internet writing frenzy\\". Lopatin and Ford spent a week recording demos at Ford's home in Massachusetts, developing their sound with \\"a ridiculously sick collection of vintage synths\\" they collected during their years as musicians. Other musical commitments slowed the work, but by 2010 they had moved into an apartment (lacking heat and hot water) to focus on the project. Production and composition Games in their apartment, using vintage synths to record in March 2010 That We Can Play was recorded with a single stereo Pro Tools track and \\"outboard, secondhand vintage synths and sequencers\\". Ford explained the process of making each song in an interview with XLR8R: \\"It's almost like we just sit down with gear and are like, 'Whoa, this sounds sweet,' and then we'll make a beat, and be like, 'What if we do this?' and something comes out and we move from there. Where it gets really complex‚Äîand you can't be a slacker‚Äîis you have to inventorize all these tiny sounds and constantly be trying to fit all of these moving parts together and see what sticks‚Äîand it's a lot of repetitive, careful-listening kind of work.\\" The writing, recording and mixing of That We Can Play is rooted in 1980s power pop. On a technical level, according to Steve Shaw of Fact magazine, Games's instrumentation includes everything expected in 1980's music and is executed correctly: bass lines, strings, keytar and arpeggiators. Instead of merely reproducing the sound from that era, the band pushes the music into unfamiliar territory. According to Pitchfork Medias Joe Colly, the EP has a nostalgic sound ‚Äì due, in part, to the analog synths (\\"not just vintage but almost aged\\" instrumentation) and their \\"glitchy electro jams.\\" Songs That We Can Play opening track, \\"Strawberry Skies\\", the only cut on the release that was produced in a real studio, was inspired by the theme of the American television show Law & Order. Critics compared it to Bananarama's \\"Cruel Summer\\". The track features dream- like vocals by Laurel Halo, mixed with reverb; according to Fact, it reflects the \\"cloud-like\\" sounds of previous releases by Oneohtrix Point Never. In writing the lyrics to the song, Ford and Lopatin came up with several senseless phrases in writing the melody for the lead vocal, the former saying that he \\"made them about Shaq and Kobe and eating steak sandwiches and pies,\\" and the latter saying \\"Anything just to get the sounds.\\" \\"Strawberry Skies\\" is followed by \\"MIDI Drift\\", which features an Italo bass line, \\"pitch-bent keytar\\" and \\"square wave synths\\", and was compared by Michael Brodeur of The Boston Globe to the music of Ratatat. The third track, \\"Planet Party\\", called \\"Apple IIe funk\\" by Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media, contains \\"wailing guitar synths\\", \\"fist-pumping bass\\", \\"scattergun freestyle drums\\" and \\"sudden, surprisingly violent orchestral stabs\\". Produced in the summer of 2010 and the first song to be chosen for inclusion on That We Can Play, Ford recalled, \\"We were making this smooth-rock, Alan Parsons Project-style shit, and then it completely got sliced and diced, mistakes happened in Pro Tools, and it became something else.\\" \\"Shadows in Bloom\\", a reprise of Secret Service's \\"Flash in the Night\\", is a melancholy, mid-tempo power ballad featuring bass, snare and synth harmonies described by a reviewer as violent, cavernous, and harsh. That We Can Play also includes two remixes; Chicago duo Gatekeeper's version of \\"Strawberry Skies\\" contains a sample of the PlayStation start-up sound and, according to Fact Steve Shaw, \\"ups the '80s ante and slows the pace with their trademark industrial sex club character (sampling Boards of Canada in the process), the result sounding far more like a real computer game than any of the UK club tracks currently referencing them\\". The EP ends with Games's version of CFCF's \\"It Was Never Meant to Be\\", which Shaw described it as a \\"lush affair\\" with \\"chopped DX7 pads and afro-new age staccato melodies\\". Promotion The first song released from That We Can Play was \\"Midi Drift\\", which was posted on Games's blog in April 2010. \\"Shadows in Bloom\\" premiered on the MP3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear and Pitchfork Media Altered Zones website on September 29, 2010. On December 14, a remix of \\"Strawberry Skies\\" by electronic musician Hudson Mohawke (not included on the EP) became available for download on Fact website; according to the magazine, it \\"manages to be totally malevolent while also sounding like an amazing street party, which is quite an achievement\\". A Stereogum writer called the Hudson Mohawke remix \\"nice\\", but preferred Gatekeeper's \\"strangulation\\" of the song. That We Can Play was also promoted with several music videos. A video for \\"Planet Party\\" was released on Delicious Scopitone in August 2010, which Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork Media described as \\"a stutteringly smooth, been-around-for-a-few- minutes\\" production with \\"jet skis, killer whales, water slides, wind surfing, track racing, and tape-warped women\\". A video for \\"Shadows in Bloom\\" by WEIRDCORE was released on November 11 and, according to Fitzmaurice, \\"showcases a warped take on airline attendants and air travel that has to be seen to be believed.\\" On December 13 a video for \\"Strawberry Skies\\", directed by Josef Kraska and described by Gorilla vs. Bear as an 80s chat line-shower montage\\", premiered on the blog. Release and reception In August 2010, Games stated that That We Can Play would be released in late September or early October 2010. However, when the release date and track list were announced on September 9 the release date had been pushed back to November 2. The EP, distributed by Hippos in Tanks with cover artwork by Christian \\"Megazord\\" Oldham and cover design by Rasmus Emanuel Svensson, was positively received by critics. In a November 3, 2010 review Steve Shaw praised That We Can Play for its accurate references to 1980s music, writing that the EP \\"resides in a both unsettled and an unsettling state, with hints of something very strong and unique perhaps being tied down by exploring more recognisable formats\\". Shaw recommended it to his readers, giving it a rating of four out of five. In a Boston Globe review Michael Brodeur described the EP as \\"unrelentingly retro, but intriguingly interstitial\\", with a smoothness which \\"sounds like a familiar future\\". Joe Colly of Pitchfork Media called That We Can Play \\"a quirky and technical treat\\" but criticized the EP's brevity, lamenting the omission of previous Games singles \\"Everything Is Working\\" and \\"Heartlands\\". That We Can Play was ranked eighth on Gorilla vs. Bear's list of the top 30 albums of 2010; according to Chris Cantalini, \\"The run time here is slight, but the EP's brevity works in its favor, as there's not a wasted second on this thing.\\" Track listing Sample credits * \\"Shadows In Bloom\\" samples \\"Flash In The Night\\" by Secret Service.

Around 1706, he painted his first major work: \\"Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness\\", commissioned by the Lancry family. In 1715, he was awarded the Prix de Rome of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture with his rendering of Judith beheading Holofernes, and received a pension to study at the French Academy in Rome, where he spent five years. After returning in 1720, he received numerous commissions from religious institutions and created decorations for the Governor's residence. He worked throughout the area, painting murals and other works at churches and convents in Douai, Cambrai, Arras, Tournai, Ghent and Valenciennes. Eventually, he acquired enough money to purchase the home of his former teacher, Vuez. In, the loom-worker Guillaume Werniers produced a series of tapestries on the life of Christ, after drawings by Wamps. These were installed in the choir room of the \\"√âglise Saint-Sauveur\\". Most were later moved to museums, but one went to the \\"√âglise Saint Pierre d'Antioche\\" in Villeneuve-d'Ascq. His paintings for Anchin Abbey were destroyed during World War II and are now preserved only as sketches. Other major works include \\"The Dream of Saint Joseph\\" and \\"The Resurrection of Christ\\" at the Hospice Comtesse and \\"The Judgment of David\\" at the Palais des beaux-arts de Lille.

He takes a correspondence course in aviation and builds his own aircraft, hoping to enter a race from New York to Europe. Samuel Sloan (Burr McIntosh), a wealthy soap manufacturer, arrives with his daughter Mary (Patsy Ruth Miller), a trained nurse (Ruth Dwyer), and his confidential secretary (Lloyd Whitlock), the last two secretly plotting to get Sloan's holdings. Hiram, infatuated with Mary, crashes a banquet in honor of a visiting French aviator and takes it upon himself to be the speaker of the evening. Although he is ejected, Hiriam perseveres. Mary learns of the plot against her father and with the aid of Hiram and his aircraft sets out for New York, but Hiram pilots them across the ocean into Russia and there makes a forced landing. The success of the flight, however, saves the Sloan fortune.

Wehntal at Niederweningen Wehntal at Oberweningen and Schleinikon Dielsdorf and western Glatttal as seen from the Regensberg Castle  Geography  The Wehn valley (native German name: Wehntal) area is situated between the L√§gern and Egg mountain chain in the Dielsdorf District of the Canton of Z√ºrich in Switzerland. To the east the valley is bounded by a moraine of the Linth glacier, respectively the lower Glatt Valley near Dielsdorf, and in the west it passes over to the border of the Canton of Aargau respectively the drainage bassin of the Surb Valley (native German name: Surbtal) and the river of the same name which rises in the Wehntal. The population of the region is expanding rapidly due to its proximity to city of Z√ºrich and its beautiful landscape. Wehntal comprises the area of the municipalities: * Sch√∂fflisdorf * Oberweningen * Schleinikon * Niederweningen * Steinmaur * Dielsdorf  History  About 185,000 years ago, a side lobe of the Walensee/Reinglacier overlapped on the threshold at the present Pfannenstiel eastern slope from Hombrechtikon into the Glatttal towards Niederweningen, and eroded the overdeepened rock rut of the present Wehntal area. During melting of the glacier, Wehntal, the lower Glatttal and Furttal filled about 180,000 to 150,000 years ago with cold glacial lakes. After another glacier maximum about 140,000 years ago, the ice melted in the last Eemian (interglacial) period back far into the alpine valleys, and great lakes with border union fens filled the former glacial basin. During the W√ºrm glaciation and again about 45,000 years ago, mammoths and other Ice Age animals lived in the largely silted Wehntal. During the last glacial maximum about 24,000 years ago the glaciers pushed again to the lower Glatttal, but not to Wehntal. With the increasing warming period about 20,000 years ago, the glaciers melted away in stages to Z√ºrich, later Hurden and formed the Seedamm at the Obersee lake shore respectively the Ufenau, L√ºtzelau and Heilig H√ºsli islands on Z√ºrichsee, and finally the glaciers retreated into the alpine mountains. In 1890 the most important site of ice animals in Switzerland was discovered in Niederweningen. Particularly the uppermost deposits with the so-called Mammut turf layer were studied up in about depth, and between 1983 and 1985 by three research boreholes to a depth of . In 1994 a groundwater bore in Oberweningen proved that the Wehntal area originally laid at least deeper than the present valley floor and had to be caused by glacial erosion. In 2003 the remains of a Mammoth were found, and further finds resulted in the establishment of the present Mammutmuseum Niederweningen. 2003 Mammoth find in Niederwenigen Archaeological finds date back to the Roman era. The term Wehn may derived from the probably Allamanic name Waninc respectively Wano, meaning Wano's valley. The heartland of the possessions of the medieval House of Regensberg was in the Furt and Wehn valleys besides the L√§gern chain, where around 1050 AD the family built its ancestral seat Altburg near Z√ºrich-Affoltern and two centuries later Neu- Regensberg on the eastern L√§gern slope.  Transportation  The area is part of the S-Bahn Z√ºrich on the line S15, and around the city of Z√ºrich provided by Verkehrsbetriebe Z√ºrich (VBZ), the public transport operator in the city of Zurich and its suburbs.

He was the eldest son of Bir Shumsher, the third prime minister of the Rana dynasty. He is generally regarded as the first scientist of Nepal. Early life Gehendra was born in Poush, 1928 BS (1871 CE). He was born in the Indian city of Kolkata where his father was sent to serve as the Nepali representative to India. Born in a noble Rana family, he had the rare privilege to study. Apart from being privately tutored within the palace in English, he later also attended Durbar High School ‚Äì the oldest modern school of Nepal. With the enrollment in Durbar High School, his interests were kindled, now that he was trying his hand at sports and music as well. However, past Durbar High School, not much is known about his academic part of life. While some references suggest he was sent to Japan along with 5 others to pursue engineering studies, his precise academic qualification remains unknown. As a kid, Gehendra was intimately drawn to mechanics and ammunition. After the murder of Ranodip Singh Kunwar in 1942 BS, his father, Bir Shumsher, became the nation's prime minister, and opportunities popped up for him. At a tender age of 14 years, he was appointed to take care of the ammunition department in the Royal Nepal Army. This early exposure gutted in him a lifelong fascination for arms, ammunition, and the like. Career At some point, Gehendra Shumsher worked as a spy chief and the head of police, but his interests were largely confined to the manufacture and design of firearms. As opposed to importing arms and ammunition from other countries, he wanted to manufacture them within the country, especially by exploiting locally available raw materials like iron and coal. So, after a considerable study of British catalogues, he set up manufacturing factories at Jamal (Seto Durbar), Sundarijal, Balaju, and Megchan (Bhojpur) with a view of doing just that. Towards the end of 1956 BS, Gehendra Shumsher imported a motor car from Ford Motor Company. He tried to make a new motor car himself by disassembling and studying every part in every detail. Besides, he set up a seven boiler rice mill and wind motor to draw underground water at Seto Durbar, the residential palace he inherited from his father. He was the first man in Nepal to produce electricity in Nepal. He demonstrated how electricity could be produced with the help of water. In addition, he also set up a leather tanning factory in Balaju. Gehendra Shamsher is credited for modernization of Nepal Army. He was able to make his own mechanical machine gun similar to Gardner gun and named it Bira gun after his father. He is also credited for modifying Martini‚ÄìHenry into new gun Gahendra Martini and Ge-rifle, a double-barrelled machine gun. Besides, he also developed a new model of canon Dhir-Gun, named in honour of his grandfather, Dhir Shumsher. Later life After the demise of Bir Shumsher, Dev Shumsher ascended to the throne. Dev and Gehendra Shumsher shared an amicable relationship, so Gehendra had an important position in the palace. He was appointed as the spy chief and head of police. Later, upon the request of Dev Shumsher, he went to Japan to study the Japanese technology, especially with regard to the manufacturing of firearms. Gehendra Shumsher died a mysterious death at the age of 35. However, it is believed that during initial years of Chandra Shumsher's premiership, Gehendra Shumsher was murdered at his residence in Seto Durbar as Chandra was scared of his political and military influence.

Following her decades-long career, she moved to the U.S., where she founded the Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse. Krassovska taught, choreographed and performed until her death.  Early life  Krassovska was born Nathalie Leslie in St. Petersburg, the daughter of a Russian mother and Scottish father. Depending on the source her birthdate is recorded as June 1 or June 3, with the year ranging from 1917 to 1919, most frequently 1918.The Independent, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska, Star ballerina of rare talent and charm, Nadine Meisner (February 16, 2005) https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nathalie- krassovska-6152419.htmlFind a Grave, Nathalie Leslie Krassovska https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/11342415The Telegraph, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska (April 12, 2005) https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1487612/Nathalie-Krassovska.html Her grandmother was a soloist with the Bolshoi Ballet; her mother Lydia Krassovska was a dancer with Diaghilev‚Äôs Ballet Russes. Young Nathalie began her ballet studies with her grandmother, but her formal training took place in Europe. In Paris, she trained with Olga Preobrajenska, St Petersburg's pre- Revolutionary prima ballerina. In London, she studied with Russian ballet master Nikolai Legat. Under the name of Nathalie Leslie she danced with Ida Rubinstein's company at the Paris Opera. At age 14, she was selected by Bronislava Nijinska for her company, the Th√©√¢tre de la Danse. In 1933, she joined George Balanchine's short-lived Les Ballets. After Les Ballets, Krassovska partnered with Serge Lifar for a tour of South America.  Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo  Krassovska joined the Ballet Russe de Paris in 1935 and Ren√© Blum‚Äôs Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1936. In 1938, she became a member of the Massine-Denham Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. During her time with the troupe, Krassovska worked closely with Mikhail Fokine, the well-known choreographer and reformer of conventional ballet traditions. Fokine personally coached her for roles in Les Sylphides, Le Spectre de la Rose and other ballets. She advanced to the position of ballerina (principal dancer) in 1938, and performed with the group until 1949. During World War II, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo moved its home base to New YorkRussian Ballet History, http://www.russianballethistory.com/companymetamorphosis.htm and toured primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Krassovska was acclaimed for her lyrical style, especially in performances of the Romantic ballets. In 1948, she premiered Pas de Quatre at the New York Met, alongside Alicia Markova, Alexandra Danilova and Mia Slavenska. Anton Dolin‚Äôs restaging of the 1845 Jules Perrot ballet is an evocation of four legendary ballerinas from the Romantic era. In 1949, Krassovska first danced the title role in Giselle, one of the most famous Romantic ballets. It was to become one of her signature roles. Writing of the performance, Montreal Daily Star dance critic S. Morgan- Powell reportedly wrote, \\"Her dancing was characterized by a purity of style not often seen nowadays in ballet.\\"New York Times, Nathalie Krassovska, 86, Dancer Particularly Known for 'Giselle,' Dies, Jack Anderson (February 11, 2005) https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/11/arts/dance/nathalie- krassovska-86-dancer-particularly-known-for-giselle-dies.html?_r=0 She was also noted for her performances in Les Sylphides, Scheherazade, The Snow Maiden, Swan Lake and The Nutcracker.Los Angeles Times, Obituaries, Nathalie Krassovska, 86; Ballerina Praised for Lyrical Performances (February 17, 2005) http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/17/local/me-passings17.3 In an American Dancer article, reviewer Albertina Vitak said, \\"Krassovska stands out over all and is one of the most valuable assets of the company.\\" Krassovska's repertoire was not limited to ballet blanc. She learned tap dancing for her character in The New Yorker, Leonide Massine's 1940 ballet based on cartoons from the popular magazine. For Capriccio Espagnol, another Massine work, Krassovska and the cast were required to execute Flamenco steps such as the buler√≠as and seguidilla.  Career after Ballet Russe  Krassovska briefly joined Ballet Rambert in 1949. When Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin decided to found the London Festival Ballet in 1950, they asked her to be the second ballerina, partnering with English dancer John Gilpin. On opening night at the Stoll Theatre, Krassovska and Gilpin triumphed in Massine's Le Beau Danube. Their partnership became a major company attraction. After the first season, Markova left due to artistic conflicts with Dolin, and Krassovska took over as first ballerina. When Markova returned to the company (this time as guest artist), both she and Krassovska had the rank and status of prima ballerina, but Markova received top billing. Krassovska stayed with Festival Ballet under contract through 1955, and then as guest artist through 1960. She continued to perform the standard 19th century repertory. She danced in Great Britain under both her stage name, Nathalie Krassovska, and her birth name Nathalie Leslie. As a guest artist with the Ballet Russe in the late 1950s, she used the surname Krassovska. Krassovska moved to U.S. in the 1960s. Having toured the country a number of times, she decided that Dallas, Texas, with its flowers, trees and pleasant climate was one of the nicest cities.Andros on Ballet, Dick Andros (first published September 1997, updated February 2005) http://michaelminn.net/andros/biographies/krassovska_nathalie/ She opened a dance school at her home and founded a student company, Krassovska Ballet Jeunesse. She became an American citizen in 1964. Krassovska was invited frequently as a guest teacher and coach throughout the Southeastern U.S. She danced in local productions of The Nutcracker into her 80s and produced her last concert, Tribute to Ballet Russe, at Southern Methodist University in 1997.  Film  In 1941 and 1942, while a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Krassovska appeared in two movies choreographed by Massine, Spanish Fiesta (an adaptation of Capriccio Espagnol) and The Gay Parisian (also known as Gait√© Parisienne). Her remarkable beauty caught the eye of David O. Selznick and he offered her a movie contract.Internet Movie Database, Nathalie Krassovska https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0469986/?ref_=nmbio_ql Although it was a very difficult decision, she chose to remain with the ballet company. For the 1953 film Never Let Me Go, Krassovska doubled in long shots for Gene Tierney in her role as a Russian ballet dancer. Krassovska was interviewed and shown in archival footage for the 2005 documentary movie Ballets Russes.  Personal life  Her romantic life was reputedly eventful and she was briefly married to an Austrian count. Another interest, outside of ballet, was the Eastern Orthodox Church. Krassovska helped raise $850,000 toward a construction project for the St. Seraphim Orthodox Church in Dallas.  Death  Nathalie Krassovska died on February 8, 2005, due to complications from surgery. She is buried in Restland Memorial Park in Dallas.

The presence of tourtiere and pea soup on the menu by original Chef Marino Niksic (previously of Fenton's) were augmented by other items of Nouvelle Cuisine. One side of the venue was a restaurant, the other a hot bar/club. Owners Lothar and Brigitte Lang bought the Montr√©al Bistro in ____. Throughout the club's history musicians such as Oscar Peterson, Diana Krall, Jay McShann, and Joshua Redman performed at the venue. Late in its existence the club also hosted concerts featuring Doug Riley that were organized by CBC Radio host Danny Finkleman. After a dispute with the landlord, the Langs closed the Bistro on 5 July 2006. The same year the club closed, the Langs received a lifetime achievement award at the National Jazz Awards. https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1979/6/18/montreal-moxie-in-tidy- tepid-toronto Live recordings *Ray Bryant - North of the Border (1997) *Gene DiNovi - Live at the Montreal Bistro (1995) *Geoff Keezer - Trio (1993) *Dave McMurdo - Live at the Montreal Bistro (1992) *Dave McMurdo - Fire and Song (1996) *Dave McMurdo - Just for Now (2001) *Various Artists - Finkleman's 45s: The Doug Riley Sessions, Volume 1 (2000) *Various Artists - Finkleman's 45s: The Doug Riley Sessions, Volume 2 (2001) *Kenny Wheeler and Sonny Greenwich - Kenny and Sonny Live at the Montreal Bistro (1993 and 1997) References * Category:Defunct jazz clubs Category:Jazz clubs in Toronto Category:Former music venues in Canada https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1979/6/18/montreal-moxie-in-tidy-tepid- toronto ","title":"Montr√©al Bistro"},{"id":"47715296","title":"List of classical music in literature"},{"id":"47715308","text":"The Three Romances for Oboe and Piano, Op. 94 () is a composition by Robert Schumann, his only composition for oboe. It was composed in December 1849. The work consists of three short pieces in A-B-A form, and it was written during what was speculated to be one of Schumann's manic episodes. An average full performance lasts roughly 12 minutes.  Background  The Romances were written in December 1849, one of the most productive years of Schumann's entire career. Previously that year, Schumann had written two other works for wind instruments and piano: the Adagio and Allegro, op. 70, for French Horn and piano, and the Fantasy Pieces for Clarinet and Piano, op. 73. According to Schumann himself, the pieces were written on December 7, 11, and 12th in Dresden. Unlike many other oboe works at the time, the pieces were not the result of a commission by a prominent soloist of the day. Schumann gave the pieces to his wife Clara Schumann, whom he once described as his own \\"right hand\\", as a Christmas present, calling them his \\"hundredth opusculum.\\" Schumann's mental health was quickly deteriorating during the time of the pieces' writing; shortly afterwards, he moved from Dresden to D√ºsseldorf, where he was admitted to and eventually died in an asylum.  Structure and analysis  The three romances are marked in German: * I. (not fast) * II. (simple, heartfelt) * III. The three romances as a whole have been described as simple, relatively easy to play, and not virtuosic. However, they also require a good amount of breath control. All three romances are in \\"song form\\", or A-B-A. The work's melodies have been described as similar to each other. The first romance consists of a piano introductory phrase followed by the main theme played by the oboe. The piano has a layered accompaniment. After a faster-paced central section, the movement ends softly after returning to the main theme. The romance as a whole has been described as \\"tranquil.\\" The second romance, which is in A Major, is mostly a traditional duet between the two instruments with a tense B section that changes tempo twice. It begins with a soft and simple oboe presence accompanied by a matching piano passage. The 1st tempo change introduces a more attacking and rugged theme. The last tempo change reintroduces the main theme until the end of the romance. Described as \\"the most rugged and colorful-sounding [romance]\\" and reminiscent of Brahms, the final romance is the liveliest of the set. There are many mood changes throughout the piece, with the A section being excited and the B section being reserved.  Publication and performance history  Nikolaus Simrock, who initially published the piece. On November 2, 1850, the pieces were first performed privately as a piano and violin piece with Clara Schumann on piano and Fran√ßois Schubert on violin. The pieces were first performed several years after Schumann's death, in 1863; the performances took place on January 24, and February 14 in the Gewandhaus, featuring Emilius Lund on oboe and Carl Reinecke on piano. The piece was dedicated to Wilhelm Joseph von Wasielewski. The original edition was published by N. Simrock. The date of the publication is unknown, but it is estimated to have been anywhere from December 1850 to February 1851. Nikolaus Simrock wrote a letter to Schumann on November 19, 1850, asking whether or not Schumann \\"would be in agreement if we were to print on the title page: 'for oboe and pianoforte' and on this with violin 'for violin and pianoforte' and on the third 'for clarinet and pianoforte', since it is not looked upon with favor when several instruments appear on the title page.\\" However, Schumann denied the request, replying, \\"If I had originally written the work for violin or clarinet it would have become a completely different piece. I regret not being able to comply with your wishes, but I can do no other.\\" Two copies of the original printing exist: Schumann's personal copy and Wasielewski's dedication copy (both either in museums or private collections). Disobeying Schumann's wishes, Simrock published alternate violin and oboe parts in the first edition. In her compilation of Robert's works post-mortem, Clara only included the violin transcription, possibly due to her only playing the piece with violinists. There have been several recordings of the piece, including a recent one along with other Schumann oboe works by Oboe Classics. The romances are now a standard part of the oboe repertoire and often considered the best piece of romantic repertoire for the oboe.

History The original building dates to 17th-18th centuries, although the remains of a tower point to earlier construction. The property belonged to the Odescalchi family of Como since 1600. The Odescalchi family's most prominent member was Pope Innocent XI in the late 17th century, who frequented this site. In 1801, they commissioned a Neoclassical refurbishment from Simone Cantoni. The villa had medieval towers added.Ville e castelli d'Italia: Lombardia e laghi, second edition, by Luca Beltrami; Editors of Tecnografica, Milan, (1907), page 403-404. Upon the death in 1824 of Innocenzo Odescalchi, the villa was inherited by the Marchese Giorgio Raimondi. The Marchese hosted Giuseppe Garibaldi. In 1860, on the chapel on the grounds, Garibaldi wed the Marchese's daughter, Giuseppina Raimondi. However, after the ceremony she informed him that she was pregnant with the child of her lover Luigi Caroli, and Garibaldi immediately spurned her. The villa became property of the Malnati, then the Isacco family, and finally by the 1930s, property of the wealthy businessman Leone Tagliaferri.

The initiation ceremony, with certain regional variations, involved the initiate catching a male toad, hanging it from a thorn bush or pegging it to an anthill until its bones had been picked clean, and then carrying the bones on their person until dried. The bones were then thrown into a running stream on a full moon at midnight and all except one would be swept downstream.

End of World War II On 15 August 1945, the Empire of Japan announced its surrender, bringing to an end both World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies. Two days later, on 17 August, Indonesia proclaimed its independence, however the Netherlands refused to recognise the claim and sought to re-assert Dutch control over its former colony. \\"Black ban\\" on Dutch shipping The ban began on 23 September when Indonesian crew members of four Dutch ships berthed in Sydney held a sit-down strike, refusing to work on Dutch-flagged or chartered vessels, over a pay dispute and claiming that the materiel on the ships was intended to be used to suppress the independence movement. The Indonesian sailors made a request to the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia to join the boycott, and WWF federal secretary Jim Healy said that the union would not be a party to aiding in the suppression of an elected independent Indonesian government. The next day, three ships in Brisbane were held up by the bans, as well as the in Melbourne. The disputes committee of the Trades and Labour Council endorsed the unions' ban, declaring six vessels in Brisbane to be \\"black\\". On 25 September 1945, a meeting of some 1400 waterside workers in Brisbane endorsed the black ban on Dutch ships (with no dissenting voice) and declared \\"that the Dutch Government in Australia shall not interfere with the Government as at present established by the Indonesian people themselves\\". This boycott by the Waterside Workers Federation speedily extended to bans by other unions: boilermakers, engineers, ironworkers, ship painter and dockers, carpenters, storemen and packers, tally clerks, and tug crews. The Netherlands East Indies Government-in-Exile responded to this with the use of Dutch troops to load the Van Heutz with the Australian government's permission. In his 1975 book Black Armada, journalist Rupert Lockwood emphasised the unprecedented nature of this intervention: The Dutch government responded to the boycotts, insisting that any military materiel and personnel on the ships was for the purpose of fighting pro-Japanese militia in Indonesia. Commander Huibert Quispel of the Netherlands Indies Government Information Service stated that the vessels were \\"mercy ships\\" carrying food, clothing and medical supplies for the Indonesian people, and that by boycotting them, Australia's militant trade unions were only aiding the Japanese, and the \\"Quisling Jap-sponsored government\\" of Indonesia. In December 1949, after Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence, a conference of 17 trade unions passed a motion raised by Healy to lift the black ban on Dutch shipping, ending the dispute which had run for over four years. What the boycotts meant \\"Indonesian seamen walked off ships,..., refusing to carry troops, munitions, archives, currency and other paraphernalia of colonial rule... Waterside workers ... refused to load Dutch cargoes, tug-crews would not provide tow-ropes, shipyard unions denied repairs to Dutch ships, Royal Netherlands Airforce aircraft and Navy craft.... The boycott extended to Dutch transport, stores and depots ashore.\\" The number of ships subject to the bans included in total 559 craft: corvettes, submarines, troopships, passenger liners, merchant ships, tankers, barges, lighters and surf landing craft, all necessary for the Dutch re-occupation of Indonesia after its declaration of independence on 17 August 1945. Effect of the boycotts Lockwood believes that the \\"schedule-wrecking\\" delays to Dutch war plans for the newly declared Indonesian Republic gave the fledgling government sufficient time to create the administrative capacity which allowed it to weather the \\"foreign-promoted carnage and disorder of the 1950s\\", thus preventing the Indonesian archipelago from becoming another Indochina.

With its poignant, resourceful orchestral writing and clarion text-setting, the piece illuminates Milosz's poetry (in English translation) in a subtle but evocative way.\\" Jeff Dunn of the San Francisco Classical Voice similarly lauded, \\"The orchestration is the immediate strong point of the piece, but unlike the in-your-face symphony, Stucky's motivic content and progression may require repeated listenings for its subtleties to become manifest.\\" Chamber Version Stucky rewrote the piece in chamber arrangement for the Curtis 20/21 Contemporary Music Ensemble and the Curtis Composer-in- Residence Program, with funding from the Musical Fund Society.

The State Guard was organized with the purpose of replacing the Minnesota National Guard in protecting the state of Minnesota while the National Guard was federalized and deployed during World War II. The State Guard is authorized under Minnesota law, and is recognized as a component of the organized militia of Minnesota, along with the Minnesota National Guard. History =World War I= The state of Minnesota authorized and created state defense forces during each of the world wars. As a response to the United States' entrance into World War I, the United States Congress passed the Home Guard Act of 1917, which allowed the states to create home guards, which could receive surplus weaponry from the federal government. Minnesota's first State Guard, known officially as the Minnesota Home Guard, was created on April 28, 1917, and served for the duration of World War I. Over the course of the war, the Home Guard eventually consisted of 23 battalions with more than 7,000 men. The Home Guard included the Sixteenth Battalion, which was the first Minnesota-recruited African American military unit in the state's history. The Home Guard handled a number of domestic emergencies. In late 1917, the Home Guard was deployed to restore order following riots in St. Paul. On July 1, 1918, a tornado struck the town of Tyler; the relief effort was carried out by members of the Home Guard and National Guard. In October 1918, the Home Guard assumed management of the aftermath of the Cloquet fire. The remaining elements of the Home Guard were dissolved in December of 1920. =World War II= In 1940, prior to the United States' entry into World War II, Section 61 of the National Defense Act of 1916 was modified to allow the establishment of state defense forces. The Minnesota State Guard was created in 1941. By 1942, the State Guard had reached a strength of approximately 6,100 members. By 1942, the First Separate Infantry Battalion of the Minnesota State Guard was placed on active duty, requiring prospective members to enlist for the duration of the war plus an additional six months. The battalion was responsible for providing full-time security for Duluth, Two Harbors, and the Thomson Dam in Jay Cooke State Park. In at least one event, members of the Minnesota State Guard competed in a rifle competition against students from the Shattuck Military School. In 1948, two battalions of Minnesota State Guard, equipped with one dozen M4 Sherman tanks, were deployed to quell a violent strike by the meat packer's union in the St. Paul and Newport areas. After the violence was quelled, troops withdrew from most of their deployed zones but continued to patrol the Wilson plant in Albert Lea, Minnesota. Legal status State defense forces are authorized by the federal government under Title 32, Section 109 of the United States Code. Minnesota law also allows the creation of a state defense force.

Characteristics of Anemonefish  Clownfish or anemonefish are fishes that, in the wild, form symbiotic mutualisms with sea anemones and are unaffected by the stinging tentacles of the host anemone, see . The sea anemone protects the clownfish from predators, as well as providing food through the scraps left from the anemone's meals and occasional dead anemone tentacles. In return, the clownfish defends the anemone from its predators, and parasites. Clownfish are small-sized, , and depending on species, they are overall yellow, orange, or a reddish or blackish color, and many show white bars or patches. Within species there may be color variations, most commonly according to distribution, but also based on sex, age and host anemone. Clownfish are found in warmer waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the Red Sea in sheltered reefs or in shallow lagoons. In a group of clownfish, there is a strict dominance hierarchy. The largest and most aggressive fish is female and is found at the top. Only two clownfish, a male and a female, in a group reproduce through external fertilization. Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. Description The body of A. omanensis is dark brown and with two white bars and distinctive forked caudal fin, which is blackish in juveniles fading to white in adults. The midbody bar is narrow and does not extend onto the dorsal fin while the headbar is also narrow and usually constricted across the nape They have 10 dorsal spines, 2 anal spines, 10-17 dorsal soft rays and 14-15 anal soft rays. They reach a maximum length of . =Color variations= None known. =Similar species= The white forked caudal fin is distinctive, with only A. latifasciatus having a forked caudal fin, however A. omanensis has a narrow midbody bar, white caudal fin and black pelvic and anal fins while A. latifasciatus has a much wider midbody bar, and yellow fins. Image:Moh√©li- Poisson clown.jpgA. latifasciatus (Madagascar anemonefish) Distribution and Habitat A. omanensis is found in Oman in the Arabian Peninsula.. Anemone fish are sedentary and depend on ocean currents for dispersal. As A. omanesis is confined within a small range, it was used to study long-distance dispersal, from sites apart at either end of its range. Adults provide high levels of parental care to their young that hatch with well-developed swimming and sensory capabilities before embarking on a <3 week pelagic larval phase, during which time they may disperse over long distances. The study found an asymmetrical dispersal pattern between the two regions with a higher occurrence of southward dispersal, consistent with the prevailing currents, with immigration rates of 5.4% in the south and 0.7% in the north. =Host anemones= A. omanensis is associated with the following species of anemone: *Entacmaea quadricolor Bubble-tip anemone *Heteractis crispa Sebae anemone References External links Category:Pomacentridae omanensis Category:Fish described in 1991 ","title":"Amphiprion omanensis"},{"id":"47715884","text":"Kinsman and Foreman is a 1966 social novel by Nigerian novelist T.

Norfleet-Cochran House is a historic \\"English Basement\\" cottage in Holly Springs, Mississippi, USA. It was built in 1845 for Jesse P. Norfleet, a cabinetmaker from Virginia who married the daughter of a prosperous Mississippi planter. Norfleet eventually became a planter and local business owner. In the 1970's the home was renamed Dunvegan for the town of Dunvegan on the Scottish island of Skye. Location Dunvegan is located at 154 West Gholson Avenue in Holly Springs, Mississippi. History The land was acquired by Jesse P. Norfleet on January 3, 1845. The cottage, designed in the Greek Revival architectural style, was built later that year. The rafters were made of pine tree wood while the bricks were handcrafted. Like a traditional English cottage, the bedrooms and the living-rooms are upstairs, while the kitchen and dining-room are in the basement. Norfleet was a cabinetmaker from Suffolk, Virginia who married Jane H. Carlock, the daughter of Moses Carlock, a Southern planter. His daughter Ada married Henry Oscar Rand; Norfleet's grandson, Frank C. Rand, was the Chairman of the International Shoe Company. Norfleet traded houses with James Jarrell House on September 28, 1861. T. F. Sigman bought the house in 1886 and owned the house for over 30 years, until 1920. Over the years the front portico received a number of changes. In 1920, the house was sold to Samuel Vadah Cochran, Sr. (1887-1971) and his wife Rita Binion Cochran (1896-1960). The essay \\"English Basement Houses\\" by Hubert H. McAlexander, noted historian of the area, states that Rita Binion Cochran eventually had the portico rebuilt to resemble that of the nearby Featherstone Place, recently renovated by the architect Theodore Link. It remains the house's portico to this day. After Cochran Sr.‚Äôs death in 1971, the house was inherited by his son, Samuel Vadah Cochran, Jr. (1918-1995). S. Vadah Cochran, Jr. was a Professor of English at Memphis State University in Tennessee for twenty-six years as well as a noted painter whose work was exhibited at the Municipal Art Gallery in Jackson, Mississippi. He painted murals inside the house and designed the gardens. Vadah and his wife Doris Sigman Cochran renamed the cottage Dunvegan after the town on the Scottish island of Skye, where his McLeod ancestors originated. They opened it to the public for a tour once a year.

History The Lake Tyers Mission Station was established by the Church of England missionary Reverend John Bulmer in 1863 following decades of conflict between the Kurnai people and white settlers in Gippsland. Bulmer had previously sought to establish a mission south of Buchan in 1861, but moved south to the coast with the few Aboriginal survivors of the conflict. The chosen site was on a peninsula, with a lake on each side, known to traditional owners as Bung Yarnda. In the early twentieth century, Aboriginal people from a number of other Victorian missions, including Ramahyuck, Lake Condah and Coranderrk, were relocated to Lake Tyers. The Ramahyuck Mission (established in 1863 by Reverend Friedrich Hagenauer on the Avon River near Lake Wellington) was closed in 1908 and the Ganai survivors from west and central Gippsland were moved to Lake Tyers. The Ebenezer Mission was closed in 1904 due to low numbers and in the following twenty years many Wergaia people from north-western Victoria were forcibly moved to Lake Tyers.Ian D. Clark, pp12, Scars on the Landscape. A Register of Massacre sites in Western Victoria 1803-1859, Aboriginal Studies Press, 1995 Lake Tyers was taken over by the Victorian Government in 1908. In 1916 the Government of Victoria decided to concentrate Aboriginal people from across Victoria at Lake Tyers, with the Aboriginal Protection Board establishing a policy in 1917 to concentrate all \\"full-blood\\" and \\"half-caste\\" Aboriginal people on the Lake Tyers reserve. In 1957 the Board for the Protection of Aborigines was abolished, and in the 1960s the Victorian Government decided to try to close the settlement, and assimilate residents into the general community. Some were moved to distant parts of the state, but not necessarily their traditional lands.A brief history of the Lake Tyers Aboriginal community, By Jeff Waters, ABC Radio, 21 Dec 2013 Protests in the 1950s and 60s for an independent, Aboriginal-run farming cooperative at Lake Tyers received support and assistance from the Aborigines Advancement League in Melbourne. Pastor Sir Doug Nicholls campaigned on their behalf, but when the Board moved to close Lake Tyers, Nicholls resigned his position in protest. In 1965, however, the mission was declared a Permanent Reserve. In 1970 the Aboriginal Lands Act 1970 was passed by the Parliament of Victoria, the first Act to recognise land rights for Aboriginal people in Victoria, which handed ownership of Framlingham in western Victoria to an Aboriginal trust on 1 July 1971. Along with Lake Tyers, Framlingham was the last reserve to close in Victoria. In 1971 the remaining Lake Tyers residents, then only numbering a couple of hundred, were granted freehold title of the remaining as part of a self-governing community under the Lake Tyers Aboriginal Trust, with each adult and child receiving a parcel of shares. The Aborigines Advancement League had previously expressed concern for the loss of Aboriginal land in 1948, when it told the government that \\"land titles of Lake Tyers must be transferred with due precaution in the matter of safeguard to prevent any attempted dispossession of the Aborigines and mixed bloods by any person\\".Australian Aborigines' League, Terms of Reference for an Enquiry, 4 March 1948, Council for Aboriginal Rights (Vic.) Papers, MS 12913/8/1, State Library of Victoria Shortly after, Laurie Moffatt explained as spokesman for Lake Tyers residents: :\\"We do not want to see Lake Tyers finally sold to the white man in the same way as Ramahyuck, Condah, Ebenezer Mission and Coranderrk Reserves have been sold. All these have been hostels for the aborigines in my lifetime and have been sold to the white man to cultivate\\".The Argus, 28 January 1952.'' Administration An administrator (Simon Wallace-Smith of Deloitte) was appointed by the government to run the trust in 2003. However, the remaining shareholders objected and in 2011 they staged a two-week blockade of the site, camping at the settlement's gate and refusing access to all government officials. Wallace-Smith was escorted back in by police. Notable residents Albert Mullett, although born in Melbourne in 1933, lived with his family on the fringe of Lake Tyers, but when ‚Äúpart-Aboriginal‚Äù families were forced to leave the mission they moved to the other side of the lake.http://www.abc.net.au/missionvoices/lake_tyers/voices_of_lake_tyers/, accessed 11 January 2014.

Herdman served as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda from 1983 to 1986 (with a period as Bermuda's acting Governor in 1983) and then as the Governor of the British Virgin Islands from 1986 until 1991. Biography =Early life and education= Mark Herdman was born in Rhu, Scotland, on 26 April 1932, to Joan (n√©e Tennant) and Claud Herdman, a Commander of the Royal Navy. His mother, Joan, died in 1936 when he was four years old. Herdman was brought up by a paternal aunt in Northern Ireland until his father remarried in 1939. The Herdman family owned and operated a linen factory in Sion Mills in County Tyrone. They had established the village of Sion Mills in 1835. Herdman attended St Edward's School, a boarding school in Oxford, and later graduated from Trinity College Dublin. He then enrolled at The Queen's College, Oxford, for one year, to prepare for a posting in the British Overseas Civil Service. =Diplomatic career= Herdman first served as a District Officer and later as a District Commissioner in British Kenya, until the country gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1964. After leaving Kenya, Herdman transferred from the British Overseas Civil Service to Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service. He studied Arabic at the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (MECAS) in Shemlan, Lebanon, to prepare for a posting in neighbouring Jordan. He then served at diplomatic embassies and missions in Zambia, Saudi Arabia and Malawi. Queen Elizabeth II named Herdman as a lieutenant in the Royal Victorian Order during her trip to Malawi in 1979. =Deputy Governor of Bermuda= Mark Herdman was appointed Deputy Governor of Bermuda from 1983 to 1986, including a brief tenure as acting Governor from 14 February 1983 until July 1983, following the resignation of Governor Richard Posnett. =Governor of British Virgin Islands= Herdman was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands from 1986 to 1991. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the British Virgin Islands in 1989 during Herdman's tenure, devastating the islands. Hurricane Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike the territory since 1960. Governor Herdman oversaw the British Virgin Islands' emergency management programs and recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. Herdman appointed the BVI's first full-time disaster preparedness coordinator, which led to founding of the Department of Disaster Management of the British Virgin Islands in 1993, after he left office. In 1990, Herdman was named as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In a statement following his death in 2015, Premier Orlando Smith praised Herdman's role in the territory's recovery from Hurricane Hugo, noting that he had \\"helped to lay the foundation for the development of the modern Virgin Islands' disaster management systems and operations.\\" =Later life= He left his position in the British Virgin Islands in 1991. Herdman served as a member of the European Union's Peace Monitoring Mission during the break-up of Yugoslavia before retiring from diplomacy in 1992.

He is best known for developing the Lim Chu Kang area of Singapore. Neo Tiew Road, located in the district of Lim Chu Kang, in the North-Western part of Singapore, is named in his honour.*Victor R Savage, Brenda S A Yeoh (2003), Toponymics ‚Äì A Study of Singapore Street Names, Eastern Universities Press, Early life Neo was born in Nan'an, Fujian, China in 1884. In 1914, Neo, then a young colonel in the Chinese Army, immigrated to Singapore. He built his home in the forests of Singapore and away from the main city. This house, which later became a travellers' inn, was the centre of Thong Hoe village, a village that Neo built up. Career Neo Ao Tiew, together with British and Arabic investors, constructed roads, houses and a seaport in the Lim Chu Kang area. He also raised funds and built Lim Chu Kang Road, which was completed in 1929. With these developments, the population of Lim Chu Kang grew to 10,000 people. Neo played the roles of judge, sheriff and mayor of the village he founded in Lim Chu Kang. As a sheriff, he ran his own vigilante police force that meted out justice in the village. Neo's police force used heavy-handed methods to police the population; for example, they paraded thieves from house to house to publicly shame them. As a result of his policing, the village recorded no crime despite having a relatively large population of 10,000 people. In 1938, Neo founded Kay Hua School (the predecessor of the current-day Qihua Primary School) to cater to residents living in Ama Keng Village. It subsequently expanded to include 2 branch schools to serve more residents in the area. In 1980, Qihua Primary School shifted out of the Lim Chu Kang area to its current location in Woodlands. To further improve villagers' welfare, Neo also set up a maternity hospital with only one resident midwife. He was also known to personally send expectant mothers to the Kandang Kerbau Hospital. During World War II, Neo actively raised funds from the Chinese community to support the anti-Japanese war effort. He also encouraged Chinese youths to join the British army in defending the Lim Chu Kang-Kranji port defence line from the invading Japanese army. For his efforts in the war, he was appointed a Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. After the Japanese successfully invaded Singapore, Neo fled to China to escape the Japanese's persecution. His 45 relatives who remained behind were all killed by the Japanese conquerors. After the war, Neo returned to his former role of running the village. Neo died in 1975 at the age of 91 or 92. Awards Neo Ao Tiew was awarded the S.C.H. medal by King George VI after World War II. He was also awarded the Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire medal by Queen Elizabeth in 1954. For his contributions in the development of the Lim Chu Kang area, the British colonial government named a 3.5 km stretch of road as Neo Tiew Road in his honour.

Selwyn is a now-abandoned mining town.  History  Mount Elliott Mine, 1909 Selwyn takes its name from the Selwyn Range, which was named in turn after Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn, a geologist who was Director of the Geological Survey of Victoria from 1852 to 1869. It was formerly known as Mount Elliott after the prospector James Elliott who discovered copper and gold in the area in 1889. On 15 December 1910 the Selwyn railway line opened to service the Hampden and Mount Elliott mines. It was a branch of the Great Northern Railway and ran south from Cloncurry to Selwyn. Selwyn's population peaked in 1918 with an estimated population of 1500 people with a hospital and four hotels. However, in 1920, copper prices collapsed and by 1921 only 191 people were still living in Selwyn. The railway line to Selwyn was closed in 1961.  Heritage listings  Selwyn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Mount Elliott Mining Complex Present day Although the town of Selwyn is now abandoned, the mining and processing of phosphate occurs in the south-west of the locality at Phosphate Hill ().

The University Park is at the centre of Aarhus University's main campus. As the university campus, the University Park is situated in the neighbourhood of Vesterbro in Midtbyen close to Tr√∏jborg, and the park bounded by the streets of N√∏rrebrogade, Nordre Ringgade, Langelandsgade, Kaserneboulevarden and H√∏egh Guldbergs Gade. The park forms part of the Aarhus University campus and figures in the Danish Culture Canon for its landscape design. The combined park and campus has received international recognition for its aesthetic values, and the University Park has been protected by law since 1993, in order to conserve its unique design. The University Park was established in 1933 in conjunction with the university. The campus master plan competition was won in 1931 by the collaborative scheme of Danish architects Kay Fisker, C. F. M√∏ller and Povl Stegmann in collaboration with landscape architect Carl Theodor S√∏rensen who designed the park. The park is encircled by the university buildings, including the Natural History Museum and dormitories. It is constructed across an undulating landscape in parts of an old moraine valley stretching from Katrinebjerg in Vejlby, in the north, to the Bay of Aarhus in the east. The park is characterized by its oak trees, two artificial lakes, home to water fowl and amphibians, and large open, grassy areas. A small stream runs north-south in the bottom of the valley from the amphitheatre to the lakes. The adjoining Vennelystparken to the south, contrasts the University Park with a different terrain and fauna and mixed tree growth. In 1949, an amphitheatre was added below the main building of the university and it has become a central element in recreational activities in the park. Annually a boat race is held in the lakes between the faculties of the university, which has become a public event.

One of the most common forms of head injury sustained in the AFL is concussion, which will affect about 6-7 players per team, per season. The reason head injuries are a big concern is that they relate to an increased probability to developing forms of cognitive impairment such as; depression and dementia later in life.  Physical injuries  During round 6 in the 2002 AFL season, James Hird suffered a facial injury after a collision with team mate Mark McVeigh during a match between Essendon and Fremantle which resulted in several bone fractures, Hird's injuries were compared to injuries seen in motor-car accidents. Jonathan Brown is another AFL player whose facial injuries were compared to those in a car accident; the three time award winner of the AFL's most courageous player, was injured after colliding with the knee of Fremantle's Luke McPharlin. Brown's injuries consisted of eight breaks around his eye socket, mandible, and cheek bone, which took hours of reconstructive surgery to repair.  Mental injuries  Most of the severe mental injuries associated with AFL are developed later in life when the player has retired from the AFL; these injuries are a result of heavy contact to the player's head. From one hundred cases of concussion being reviewed, ninety seven of these involved direct contact to the head with majority of the contact coming from the head, upper body or upper limbs of the other player. Evidence suggests that some negative effects of concussion on cognitive and motor function may continue to harm the player many years after the initial injury; some research also links clinical depression to contact related concussion.  Prevention  In recent years the AFL have taken many steps forward to try reduce the effects of concussion and how many players are receiving concussion, which will also reduce the physical head injuries to with less head contact. The AFL have modified rules of the game to protect the head of the player and reduce head contact during contests, and have also given out a concussion management plan. Prevention is also up to the player as well, for a player to comply with the concussion management plan they must miss the next game, but with players not registering as being concussed and playing the next week they can develop worse injuries.  Notable people  Greg Williams, a former AFL player known for his attack on the football blames concussion on the football field as to why he's experiencing memory loss and also why he's developing a short temper. Chris Nowinski is a US concussions expert and states that he believes the AFL should do more to prevent players suffering head injuries which can lead to degenerate brain disease. Nowinski is an advocate for education about concussion being mandatory in sports codes, and believes some AFL players may already suffer from chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Synopsis In each episode, Ruff-Ruff, Tweet and Dave are called out by Hatty the Hamster to go on adventures with him. A few times in each episode, Hatty will ask a question. The three title characters will give their answers, but only one of them is correct. Hatty then asks the viewers which of the three gave the correct answer to his question. Characters =Main= * Hatty is a hamster and the show's host. He wears a bow-tie, and a top hat that shapeshifts from one episode to another. He takes the title characters to certain places in his top-shaped aircraft called the \\"Spin-Again\\". His shapeshifting hat also contains cards with questions that he reads to them. He would act like a school teacher to them by providing some information during their adventures. It is unknown if he has a house, although he has a garden where he occasionally takes his three friends to. Voiced by Forrest Harding (who in fact, sounds like a talking version of the Sprout character Chica, both voiced by the same person), later, Bryce Papenbrook in the United States and David Holt in the United Kingdom. *Ruff-Ruff is a red beagle, and one of the three title characters. He lives in a red house (resembling a ball with his ears) which sits beside Tweet's and Dave's house, and is located on a mountain that extends above a lake. He also drives a red Rolly Pod. He even likes to dig holes which, at times, result in finding lost items. Voiced by Ethan Drake Davis in the United States and Joseph West in the United Kingdom. * Tweet is a yellow chick wearing pink glasses, and the shortest of the group. She lives in a yellow house that sits in between Ruff-Ruff's and Dave's. Her house resembles an egg, and drives a yellow Rolly Pod with a beak. She walks by moving her feet simultaneously instead of alternately. Voiced by Hannah Swain in the United States and Ella Pearl Marshall-Pinder in the United Kingdom. * Dave is a blue panda, and is the largest of the title characters. He lives in a white house with blue ears that resembles him. His house is further on the right, being beside Tweet's house. He drives a big fat blue Rolly Pod. He is also the subject of Hatty's last question which the hamster asks at the end of each episode who will fall asleep first, and Dave is always the answer because he always falls asleep before Ruff-Ruff and Tweet. In one episode, Dave made a complete sweep by being the only one correct on every question Hatty asks. Voiced by Austin Nash Chase in the United States and Jonathan Millar in the United Kingdom. He loves bananas. =Other= * Mr. Squirrel is a brown squirrel whom Ruff-Ruff likes to chase around. He would sometimes aid the main characters in their adventures. As with characters other than the main ones, he does not speak. * Cindy Squirrel is the other squirrel in the show. * Speedy/Sneezy Sheep are a pair of sheep with a black stripe on the wools near their necks. They occasionally takes part in the main characters' games. * Mrs. Duck is a brown duck who adores Tweet and swims around. * The Cows are at the farm, but they do not speak. * Farmer Fred is mentioned. * Bobby is a spider monkey who speaks a gibberish language. * Tara is another monkey and is Bobby's sister. * Littlest Rabbit is part of the Rabbit family the three title characters help sometimes. He is sometimes seen with his plush toy which is carrot with a face called a Cuddly Carrot. * Mr. Rabbit is the father of the Rabbit family. He won a carrot contest of which Hatty was a contestant.

Studies have shown that the majority of the children in some regions of Australia are receiving the dental care that they need. However, other studies have shown that the children and young adults still encounter poor quality dental care, and some do not have access to a dentist due to financial barriers. Children in the lower income groups were the most likely to not receive the dental care they needed because of the cost of the treatment.\\"Financial Burden Of Dental Care Among Australian Children.\\" Australian Dental Journal 59.2 (2014): 268-272 5p. CINAHL Complete. Web. 23 Feb. 2016. There are several things that the adolescents can do in order to stay proactive in healthy dental hygiene. Young Australians today have less tooth decay because of fluoride. Natural fluoride found in water has significantly increased the dental health of the adolescents, and decreased the tooth-aches. For those that do not have access to water with fluoride due to the area in which they live in, they can use alternatives such as toothpaste that does contain fluoride.  Statistics  The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare conducts periodical surveys of the dental health of Australian children and teenagers. The Institute's 2010 surveyHarford J.E. & Luzzi L. (2013). Child and teenager oral health and dental visiting: Results from the National Dental Telephone Interview Survey 2010. Dental Statistics and Research Series no. 64. Cat. no DEN 226. Canberra: AIHW. found that the majority of Australian children had good dental health, with 70% of children making a dental visit in the previous 12 months, and 84% of these visiting for a check-up. However, it also found that: * 7% of children had experienced toothache, and 10% avoided certain foods during the previous 12 months. * Children from low income households were more likely to experience toothache and fair or poor oral health than were children from high income households, and children from these low income households were less likely to have visited a dentist. They were also 7 times more likely to have avoided or delayed dental visits due to cost. * Less than one third of pre- school aged children had ever visited a dentist. Levels of dental health also vary across demographics. In particular, Indigenous Australians tend to score worse on almost every dental health indicator, relative to their non- Indigenous counterparts.Jamieson, L. M., Roberts-Thomson, K. F., & Sayers, S. M. (2010). Dental caries risk indicators among Australian Aboriginal young adults. Community Dentistry and Oral Epidemiology, 38(3), 213-221. doi:10.1111/j.1600-0528.2009.00519.x Example of a healthy adolescent smile  Factors influencing dental health  Carbohydrate intake, accumulation and retention of plaque, frequency of exposure to dietary acids, exposure to fluoride and other trace elements, and natural protective factors such as saliva are five of the key factors that influence dental decay.Mount, G. & Hume, W. (2005). Preservation and restoration of tooth structure, 2nd edn. Sandgate, Queensland: Knowledge Books. Dental health is also affected by the dental, diet, and lifestyle habits of individuals, and by the fluoridation of toothpaste and drinking water. =Dental habits= Early childhood is an important time to establish good dental health habits (including brushing and dental visits), reducing the risk of disease and leading to better health in adulthood.NSW Department of Health Centre for Oral Health Strategy. (2014). Early Childhood Oral Health Guidelines for Child Health Professionals, 3rd Edition. Melbourne, New South Wales: Government of New South Wales. However, financial constraints can lead to children in lower income households being less likely to access dental care than those in higher income households. =Dietary habits= High-sugar foods such muesli bars, lollies, and sugary drinks and juices can contribute to dental decay, as can refined carbohydrates found in crackers and chips. The Australian Dental Association recommends that parents limit their children's intake of these foods, in favour of healthier snacks.Australian Dental Association \\"Health eating equals healthy teeth\\" Retrieved on 19 October 2015. International studies have also found eating disorders in adolescents can result in negative dental health consequences.Hermont, A. P., Pordeus, I. A., Paiva, S. M., Abreu, M. H. N. G., & Auad, S. M. (2013). Eating disorder risk behavior and dental implications among adolescents. International Journal of Eating Disorders, 46(7), 677-683. A 2015 paper suggests that the prevalence of eating disorders among Australian adolescents may be as much as 15% in females and 3% in males.Hay, P., Girosi, F., & Mond, J. (2015). Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of DSM-5 eating disorders in the Australian population. Journal of eating disorders, 3(1), 19. Chicago =Drug and alcohol use= Smoking, and consumption of alcohol and other drugs can begin to have a negative impact on oral health as children enter adolescence. Regular consumption of alcohol can lead to tooth decay, and smoking can result in gum damage and future oral cancers.Government of Victoria \\"Teeth and drug use\\" Retrieved on 19 October 2015. =Fluoridation= Australians born after 1967 were named the \\"Fluoride Generation\\" because they had been exposed to fluoridated water and toothpaste that contained fluoride since birth. Longitudinal studies have found that as young adults, this generation experienced half the level of decay observed in their parents' generation at the same age, and that much of the benefit of fluoridation was accrued in childhood rather than later life.Mejia, G., G.

Spencer. \\"Australia‚Äôs dental generations: the National Survey of Adult Oral Health 2004‚Äì06.\\" (2007): 37-53. , around 80% of Australians had access to fluoridated water, although this statistic varied significantly across jurisdictions.Government of the Northern Territory \\"Water Fluoridation and Disinfection Information\\" Retrieved on 19 October 2015.

Life and career Hrant Maloyan was born in Istanbul on 29 November 1896 to an Armenian Catholic family. From 1905 to 1907, Maloyan received his education in Venice, Italy at the San Lazzaro degli Armeni. He then attended the Marist Brothers educational facility and graduated from there in 1912. After studying in a year at a Turkish school, he studied law at the Constantinople's College of Law from 1913 to 1914. He then attended the Ottoman Military Academy and graduated from there in 1916. Hrant Maloyan During World War I, Hrant Maloyan was conscripted to the Ottoman army and was sent to the Suez but was captured by British forces. In 1918, after being freed by the British, Maloyan went to Damascus and allied himself with King Faysal I. In 1920, he joined the French army and participated in the French Armenian Legion. Fluent in five languages, Maloyan was assigned as a translator, but was also assigned as a commander to the gendarmerie. Among the battles he participated were the battles of Marash and Amanos. Due to his relative success, Maloyan was appointed as a commissioned officer in 1922. In 1945, he was appointed by president Shukri al-Quwatli as the General Command of the Internal Security Forces in Syria and served this position until 1949. His appointment was heralded by the Syrian press who demonstrated how accommodating Syrian society was towards its diverse population. It is also believed that this is the highest position an Armenian in Syria has ever held. Maloyan would eventually be known to modernize the Syrian police ranks and improve discipline of the task force in the country. The members of the police task force doubled to 9,751 members by the time his post finished in 1949. In 1946, Salman al-Murshid, a religious Syrian figure, was organizing a separatist movement. Maloyan had him arrested and ultimately tried and executed in November 1946. During his time at the Head of Internal Security Forces, the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 began. Maloyan proclaimed martial law and set curfews. Meanwhile, he then restrained public disorder and prevented riots. Having retired in August 1949, he worked for British Airways in Damascus. He then moved to the United States and settled in California, where he died in 1978. His funeral was attended by veteran soldiers, politicians, officers, and a large number of fans. Hrant Maloyan has been decorated with medals from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt. and France.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as St. Croix Lumber Mills‚ÄîStillwater Manufacturing Company in 1982 for its local significance in the theme of industry. It was nominated because the powerhouse is the only surviving industrial building associated with Isaac Staples (1816‚Äì1898), a major figure in Minnesota's early commercial development. The property now operates as a shopping mall with upper level apartments. History The powerhouse with its smokestack was constructed by the partners Sawyer and Heaton in 1850, establishing the second sawmill in Stillwater. Isaac Staples arrived in the booming lumber town in 1853 as the representative of Samuel F. Hersey and other eastern investors. Successfully establishing himself in the lumber milling and mercantile industries, Staples decided to go into business for himself in 1869. He purchased Sawyer and Heaton's mill, which had passed through several owners, overhauling and renaming it the St. Croix Lumber Mills. Staples operated the mill until the 1880s, when it was sold to J.H. Townsend and Company for use as a flour mill. The Stillwater Manufacturing Company also moved into the complex in 1888. A subsidiary of the Minnesota Thresher Company, they were a manufacturer of doors, window blinds, and window sashes. In 1894 a fire destroyed all the wooden mill structures, leaving only the limestone powerhouse. The Stillwater Manufacturing Company constructed a four-story, metal-sided building adjacent to the powerhouse in 1900.

Research firm CB Insights, in a study commissioned by The New York Times, listed Greenhouse among fifty startups predicted to become unicorns, companies with at least a $1 billion valuation. History =Early history: Founding, seed funding, and Series A round (2012‚Äì2014)= Greenhouse Software cofounder Daniel Chait founded banking software startup company Lab49 from his kitchen. While running Lab49, Chait had to deal with the pressures and obligations of recruitment. After he sold his stake in Lab49 in 2011, he decided to focus his next business venture on recruiting, which he told TechCrunch in a November 2013 interview \\"seemed like a big opportunity\\". Greenhouse was founded in 2012. On November 14, 2013, Greenhouse raised $2.7 million in a seed round led by Social+Capital Partnership and Resolute Ventures. The angel investors who participated in the seed round were Nick Ganju (a founder of ZocDoc), Seth Goldstein (a founder of DJZ and Turntable.fm), Thatcher Bell (a founder of DFJ Gotham Ventures), Thomas Lehrman (a founder of Gerson Lehrman Group), and Bill Lohse (an early investor in Pinterest). The funding round's aim was to expand the engineering, sales, and marketing teams, as well as increase the number of customers Greenhouse could take on. In August 2014, Greenhouse raised $7.5 million in its Series A round led by Social+Capital Partnership. Resolute Ventures and Felicis Ventures were part of the funding round. Social+Capital Parternship's Mamoon Hamid joined Greenhouse's board. The company aimed to use the money to increase hiring and to market its software. =Later history: Series B round and Series C round (2015‚Äìpresent)= In March 2015, Greenhouse secured $13.6 million in its Series B round led by Benchmark. The Social+Capital Partnership, Felicis Ventures and Resolute Ventures participated in the funding round. Benchmark's Matt Cohler joined Greenhouse's board of directors. According to CEO Daniel Chait, the company's valuation grew by 2.5 times since the Series A round. The company aimed to use the money to expand the sales team and to handle security audits and internationalization. It further planned to improve its product to better predict ways to get superior candidates. In August 2015, Greenhouse received $35 million in its Series C round led by Thrive Capital. Between its Series B and Series C rounds, the company nearly doubled the number of customers, from 450 to 800. The company had 125 employees when it closed its Series C round, up from 45 in the beginning of 2015. Because Greenhouse had only 10% of its customer base outside of the United States, it planned to use the funding for increasing the sales team outside the U.S. They also planned to improve the site infrastructure and complete several confidential research and development ventures. Greenhouse is based in New York City but has an office in San Francisco and intends to add offices abroad. In August 2015, at the request of The New York Times, the research firm CB Insights ran tests based on funds raised and employee retention rate to predict which startups would become the next unicorns, companies with at least a $1 billion valuation. CB Insights predicted that Greenhouse would become a unicorn. In 2015, Greenhouse Software was on the Forbes cloud 100 list. =Product = Greenhouse provides a recruiting software as a service. Greenhouse sells annual licenses to companies, allowing them to use Greenhouse's software. Greenhouse collects into one dashboard the job seekers' applications from different routes like employment websites and referrals. Greenhouse is an open platform that uses an application programming interface (API) to facilitate the aggregation. To determine which job posts are more effective, it allows companies to do A/B testing. Greenhouse lets companies create a uniform interview procedure so candidates can be judged based on the same rubric. It aggregates a candidate's resumes and interview feedback for comparison with the job opening's specifications. It allows companies to compare candidates against each other and to compare their hiring metrics against the industry standards.
