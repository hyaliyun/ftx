Steinmetz's role in the renewal of the Moravian Church is praised in Zinzendorf's Memoirs and he is considered to be the leader of the revival in Moravia according to an inscription in the Deaths Register of Bethlehem. Pastor Steinmetz was a patron of a Lutheran school in Teschen. Due to his versatile service in the pietistic spirit, Steinmetz was hated by the Catholic clergy and Emperor Charles VI finally expelled him from all Habsburg lands in 1730. He went to Neustadt an der Aisch and later to the area around town Magdeburg, where he led excellent school in the former monastery Berga. Steinmetz was in touch with Wesley and the American revivalists. He translated works of Jonathan Edwards and Philip Doddridge into German.

It is commonly a combination of Swahili and English (Kenya's official languages) as well as Sheng and a variety of tribal languages. Early Years According to the documentary ‚ÄúHip-Hop Colony,‚Äù the beginnings of Kenyan hip-hop was like a ‚Äúnew breed of colonialism,‚Äù transplanting the original styles from the Westernized world to Africa.[2] However, Kenya has not only embraced but appropriated the genre, creating its own distinct version. Since its explosion in the mid-1990s, Kenyan hip-hop is now generally written and performed not only in English but also in Swahili and in Sheng, a slang combination of the two. In 1990, Ricky Oyaro then a teenage singer/producer made the initial impact on the Kenyan music scene with the Hip-Hop /R&B; single ‚ÄúRenaissance‚Äù that would literally create a renaissance on the then ailing Kenyan music industry. The song received massive airplay on Radio and the then popular ‚ÄúMusic Time‚Äù on Kenyan Television. Jimmy Gathu one of the earliest known rappers on the Kenyan scene, would soon follow with his hit song \\"Look, Think, Stay Alive\\"[3] released in 1991, a song dealing with road safety. soon after there were more and more Kenyan youths on tv rapping , a show called mizizi that aired on the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation gave them a platform to express themselves in this new art form and Kenyan Hip-hop was born, However, the first major commercial hip hop hit came in 1996 with Uhiki by Hardstone (Harrison Ngunjiri) which sampled a Kikuyu folk song and Marvin Gaye's sexual Healing,[4] produced by Tedd Josiah of the then Audio Vault Studios (now, Blue Zebra). Other popular pioneering acts were Kalamashaka with their national hit \\"Tafsiri Hii\\",[4] K-South with \\"Nyabaga Kodo Gakwa,\\" (which was also sampled from a Kikuyu folk song like Uhiki by Hardstone) and also the late Poxi Presha with his break out hit \\"Dhako Kelo\\".[4] Gidi Gidi Maji Maji emerged in 1999 with their hit \\"Ting Badi Malo\\" and released the debut album, \\"Ismarwa\\" the following year. They went on to released their popular and politically charged hit Unbwogable in 2002. The word took on the meaning of unshakable, unstoppable, or unbeatable and was subsequently used by major politicians and in 2008 in reference to then-candidate Barack Obama.[5][6] Coinage gives the music a localized identity which adds a little spice to the genre, Ogopa Deejays term their style of music as \\"boomba\\" or \\"Kapuka\\" while Calif Records initiated a new style known as Genge. In 2006, Influx Swagga now Rebranded to Swagga, one of the earliest Genge artistes, Proposed that all these Kenyan Music subgenres need to be merged into one brand and call it Sheng Music which would make it easily identifiable in the international market, just like Bongo Flava in Tanzania, but the idea failed to kick off when Genge, Kapuka and boomba stakeholders failed to agree. Genge, which roughly translates to \\"large crowd of people\\", reinforces a foundational ethos of hip hop as a music for and by the people. In 2014 AD Family crafted the name SHRAP for their genre of rap music , the name is a merge of Sheng and rap. A lot more Kenyan Mcees have stepped up and held the torch for future generations, keeping the kenyan hip- hop culture alive and preserving the stories of the countries urban youth population. Development of the style In the late 80s and Early 90s ,as Hip Hop was getting recognition in the global music scene , it gained a lot of airplay on Kenyan media and on seeing that majority of the rappers had features of African Origin, Kenyan youths were intrigued , they felt represented and felt the need to represent too, starting to dress and act like these rappers on television ,wearing African American urban fashion, exchanging albums, mix tapes, hip hop magazines like word up and the source, reciting song lyrics and rapping in English, ,spreading more when Matatus painted in graffiti started playing rap music and some Kenyan artists started releasing rap influenced songs.

It is the first in the Amelia Peabody series of novels and takes place in 1884-1885. Plot summary Amelia Peabody is left a wealthy orphan after the death of her studious father, who has left her everything in his will because she is the only one of his children who shared his interests, namely history and archaeology. The inheritance enables her to travel abroad in order to follow her enthusiasm for antiquities. Amelia, a determined and unorthodox English female, supports women's suffrage and believes she will never marry. (She's convinced she is unattractive and will neither submit to a man nor rule one.) In Rome she meets the destitute Evelyn Forbes, whose titled family have cast her off after she eloped with, then was abandoned by, an Italian art teacher. Amelia takes Evelyn under her wing and employs her as a companion. They travel together to Egypt, where they encounter the Emerson brothers, Radcliffe and Walter, archaeologist and philologist respectively, and where Amelia falls in love with pyramids. Amelia and Evelyn decide to travel up the Nile, stopping at various sites along the way. When they reach Amarna, they discover the Emersons excavating the city which for a while was the capital of Egypt under the mysterious Akhenaten. Amelia and Radcliffe Emerson loathe one another on sight, but after he is taken ill and she helps to keep his excavation going, they grudgingly begin to respect one another. Evelyn is attracted to Walter, but is convinced she will never marry because of her soiled reputation. Things get complicated when Evelyn's cousin Lucas shows up at the remote site with a story about her grandfather's death, his (Lucas') inheritance, and a proposal of marriage. Amidst the romantic entanglements and attempts to continue the excavation, Emerson and Amelia must also deal with the nocturnal visitations of a mummy that walks moaning through the desert. Once the mystery is solved, Amelia plans to stay in Egypt and conduct her own archaeological expeditions, with Emerson at her side ... as her advisor and as her husband. The tone of the novel (as well as the rest of the series) is humorous to the point of parody and pokes fun at many of the period's mores and stereotypes, as well as the sensationalist novels popular at the time. Background Elizabeth Peters' background in Egyptology lends authenticity to the settings and the history presented in the novel, particularly the method of travel by boat (\\"dahabeeyah\\") down the Nile that was popular at the time, as well as the customs of the various cultures. Title The title of the book, like many of the Amelia Peabody novels, comes from an ancient Egyptian text: The love of my beloved is on yonder side A width of water is between us And a crocodile waiteth on the sandbank.

He was taught Shinshin-t%C5%8Ditsu-d%C5%8D (also known as 'Japanese yoga') by Tempu Nakamura. He felt that Tempu Sensei's teaching and explanation made clear what Morihei Ueshiba was able to do in his aikido (particularly the idea that the mind moves the body). As a result he started bringing in exercises from Shinshin-t%C5%8Ditsu-d%C5%8D, such as 'unbendable arm' and 'unraisable body' into his aikido teaching. He started to do this as Chief Instructor of the Aikikai, while Morihei Ueshiba was still alive. He also felt the concepts of Shinshin-toitsu-do were more clearly applicable to daily life. It was later that he formalised his style, including leaving out some aikido techniques that he felt were ineffective against a partner who could coordinate mind and body. Although Tohei Sensei gave the Ki Development aspect of his style the name Shinshin-toitsu-do, it only covered part of Tempu Sensei's curriculum/teaching, and some of it was modified by him.

The Haghani Circle has its origin in the Haghani seminary, founded in 1964, which previously had been called Muntashiriya. After Ayatollahs Qoddusi and Beheshti, two of the leading members of the circle, were assassinated in 1981, the hawza changed its name to Shahidan Seminary (Martyr Seminary).  History  The Haghani Seminary was founded by Ayatollah Qoddusi, Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, Ayatollah Beheshti, Ayatollah Sadoughi, and Ayatollah Taleghani. It was originally conceived in a reform effort to strengthen the weight of philosophy in the hawza curriculum. To this effect, Allameh Tabatabai, the father-in-law of Ayatollah Qoddusi, was commissioned to write two introductory works, which he completed in 1970 (Bidayat al-Hikmah) and 1975 (Nikhayat al-Hikmah). Following the example of Shariatmadari's Dar al-Tabligh which had just opened a girl's section two years prior, in 1975 the Haghani Seminary opened a girls' madrasa, called Maktab-e Tawhid, so that women could receive access to a hawza education as well.

He was referred to as the \\"cassiere di Cosa Nostra\\" (Mafia's Cashier) because he was heavily involved in the financial side of organized crime, primarily money laundering. He was arrested in 1985 and charged with ordering the murder of Roberto Calvi ‚Äì nicknamed \\"Il banchiere di Dio\\" (God's banker) ‚Äì of the Banco Ambrosiano in 1982, but was acquitted in 2007 due to \\"insufficient evidence\\" in a surprise verdict. After Cal√≤ was sentenced to 23 years' imprisonment as part of the 1986/87 Maxi Trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1989 for organising the 1984 Train 904 bombing. He was given several further life sentences between 1995 and 2002.  Boss of the Porta Nuova Mafia family  Born and raised in Palermo, the capital of Sicily, he was inducted into the Porta Nuova Mafia family at the age of 23 after carrying out a murder to avenge his father. By 1969, he was the boss of Porta Nuova, and amongst his men was the future informant (pentito) Tommaso Buscetta. Cal√≤ was on the Sicilian Mafia Commission, a group of the most powerful Mafia bosses in Sicily who regularly met, supposedly to iron out differences and solve disputes. In the beginning of the 1970s, Cal√≤ moved to Rome. Under the guise of an antiques dealer and under the false identity of Mario Agliarolo he invested in real estate and laundered large proceeds of crime for many Mafia families. He was able to establish close links with common criminals of the Banda della Magliana, neo-fascist groups and members of the Italian intelligence agencies. According to reports, in the mid-1970s Cal√≤ strengthened relations with historical bosses of the Neapolitan Camorra, such as Lorenzo Nuvoletta and Vincenzo Lubrano. During the early 1980s, he supported Salvatore Riina and the Corleonesi during the Second Mafia War that decimated the rival Mafia families.  Bombing of 904 express train  Cal√≤ arranged the bombing of the 904 express train between Florence and Bologna on 23 December 1984 that killed 16 people and injured 267 others.Italy Convicts 7 in Bombing Of Train Fatal to 16 in 1984, Associated Press, on The New York Times, February 26, 1989 It was meant to divert attention from the revelations given by various Mafia informants, including Buscetta. Cal√≤ and his men had joined up with neo- fascist terrorists and the Camorra boss Giuseppe Misso to carry out the attack.  Arrest and trial  Mafia boss Giuseppe Cal√≤ at the Maxi Trial After several years as a fugitive, Cal√≤ was arrested on 30 March 1985, in a villa at Poggio San Lorenzo, in the province of Rieti, together with Antonio Rotolo, one of the Mafia's heroin movers. He was one of the hundreds of defendants at the Maxi Trial that started the following year, where he was charged with Mafia association, money laundering and the train bombing. At the end of the Maxi Trial in December 1987, Cal√≤ was found guilty and given 23 years in prison. He was substituted by Salvatore Cancemi as capo mandamento of the Porta Nuova family. In February 1989, Cal√≤ was convicted for ordering and organising the 904 train attack, and sentenced to life imprisonment.Court convicts seven, acquits two in train bombing, Associated Press, February 25, 1989  Murder of Roberto Calvi  In July 1991 the Mafia pentito (a mafioso turned informer) Francesco Marino Mannoia claimed that Roberto Calvi ‚Äì nicknamed \\"God's banker\\" because he was in charge of Banco Ambrosiano, in which the Vatican Bank was the main share-holder ‚Äì had been killed in 1982 because he had lost Mafia funds when the Banco Ambrosiano collapsed.Mafia 'murdered banker over bungled deal' , The Scotsman, February 15, 2006 According to Mannoia the killer was Francesco Di Carlo, a mafioso living in London at the time, and the order to kill Calvi had come from Cal√≤ and Licio Gelli, the head of the secret Italian masonic lodge Propaganda Due. When Di Carlo became an informer in June 1996, he denied that he was the killer, but admitted that he had been approached by Cal√≤ to do the job. However, Di Carlo could not be reached in time, and when he later called Cal√≤, the latter said that everything had been taken care of already.Mafia wanted me to kill Calvi, says jailed gangster, The Daily Telegraph, December 11, 2005 In 1997, Italian prosecutors in Rome implicated Cal√≤ in Calvi's murder, along with Flavio Carboni, a Sardinian businessman with wide ranging interests, as well as Ernesto Diotallevi (one of the leaders of the Banda della Magliana, a Roman Mafia-like organization) and Di Carlo.

Known as Indian Head Highway, the highway runs from Potomac Avenue in Indian Head north to the District of Columbia boundary in Forest Heights, where the highway continues into Washington as South Capitol Street. MD 210 is a four- to six-lane divided highway that connects Washington with the suburban communities of Oxon Hill, Fort Washington, and Accokeek in southwestern Prince George's County, and Bryans Road and Indian Head in northwestern Charles County. The highway also provides access to Fort Washington Park and Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center and, in conjunction with MD 228, connects Waldorf with Interstate 95 (I-95), I-495, and I-295. Indian Head Highway was constructed by the U.S. federal government as a military access highway in the mid-1940s to connect Washington with the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground and Fort Washington. The previous highway between Washington and Indian Head was Livingston Road, which was traced in the late 18th century and improved in the 1920s and early 1930s as MD 224. The new highway incorporated several sections of meandering MD 224 into its straight path. Indian Head Highway was fully designated MD 210 in the mid-1950s when the road was transferred from federal to state control. MD 210 was expanded to a divided highway in Forest Heights in the late 1940s and south through Fort Washington in the 1960s. Another section of divided highway was completed through Charles County in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The final divided highway section was completed through Accokeek in the mid-1980s. MD 210 was connected with I-295 in 1989 and its interchange with I-95 and I-495 was reconstructed in the mid-2000s. The Maryland State Highway Administration has long-term plans to replace the highway's major intersections with interchanges from Oxon Hill south through Fort Washington. Route description View south along MD 210 at MD 227 in Bryans Road MD 210 begins at an intersection with Potomac Avenue in the town of Indian Head. Indian Head Highway continues west as a municipally maintained boulevard west to the entrance of the Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center at the west end of town. MD 210 heads east as a four-lane divided highway through the eastern part of town parallel to Strauss Avenue, which splits southeast just east of Potomac Avenue. The state highway leaves the town and enters Potomac Heights, where it meets the western end of MD 225 (Hawthorne Road). MD 210 leaves the populated area and passes to the south of Chapman State Park, which contains the historic farm complex Mount Aventine. The highway reenters a suburban area in the community of Bryans Road, where the highway intersects MD 227; MD 227 heads north as Marshall Hall Road and south as Livingston Road. East of MD 227, MD 210 is paralleled by frontage roads intermittently to its northern terminus. MD 210 enters Prince George's County and Livingston Road splits to the north and the state highway enters Accokeek. Southwest of MD 228 at Pine Drive, which is unsigned MD 810G, eight spectators of an illegal street drag race were killed in the early morning hours of February 16, 2008, by a vehicle not involved in the drag race while standing in the middle of the northbound carriageway of MD 210. MD 210 expands to six lanes and its traffic volume doubles beyond its continuous-flow intersection with MD 228 (Berry Road). The highway intersects Livingston Road again in the center of Accokeek; that highway heads east as MD 373 and west as MD 810J before becoming a county highway. MD 210 intersects Farmington Road and curves north to cross Piscataway Creek. The state highway continues along the eastern edge of Fort Washington, where it intersects Old Fort Road and Swan Creek Road; the latter provides access to Livingston Road, which switches to the west side of the state highway. MD 210 intersects Fort Washington Road, which leads to Fort Washington Park, and Old Fort Road again east of historic Harmony Hall and St. John's Church, which are accessed from Livingston Road. Livingston Road reconnects with MD 210 at Palmer Road, north of which the state highway crosses Henson Creek. MD 210 northbound in Accokeek MD 210 crosses Carey Branch and has an intersection with Kerby Hill Road and Livingston Road; the latter splits northeast toward Oxon Hill. North of Wilson Bridge Drive, MD 210 expands to eight lanes and meets the southern end of two- lane ramps from northbound MD 210 to I-295 (Anacostia Freeway) and from I-295 to southbound MD 210. The ramp to southbound MD 210 also receives traffic from northbound I-95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) just east of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, and the ramp from northbound MD 210 also provides access to the northbound Beltway and the southbound express lanes of the Beltway, which bypass the exits for I-295 and U.S. Route 1 and Virginia State Route 241 in Alexandria. North of those ramps, MD 210 continues as a four-lane divided highway and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with MD 414 (Oxon Hill Road), which provides access to the Oxon Hill Farm and National Harbor; access from the northbound direction of the Beltway to northbound MD 210 is via MD 414. MD 210 becomes six lanes again, crosses the quad-carriageway Beltway, and completes the Beltway access with several ramps connecting with the local lanes of the southbound Beltway. MD 210 continues north as a four-lane divided highway through the town of Forest Heights; the frontage road on the southbound side of the highway is Sachem Drive. At the north end of the residential town, the state highway meets the northern end of the northernmost Maryland segment of Livingston Road. Southbound MD 210 gains a third lane and the highway continues through a commercial area. The state highway becomes undivided just south of its terminus at the District of Columbia boundary at Southern Avenue. The highway continues north as South Capitol Street through Bellevue and Anacostia. Just north of the intersection, the Washington segment of Livingston Road splits to the north. MD 210 is a part of the main National Highway System from MD 228 in Accokeek to I-95, I-295, and I-495 in Oxon Hill. History The main highway along the Washington-Indian Head corridor before the construction of Indian Head Highway was Livingston Road, which follows much of the course of a road that has connected Charles County and the District of Columbia parallel to the eastern shore of the Potomac River through Prince George's County since the late 18th century. The road became more important as the highway connecting Washington with both Fort Washington and Fort Foote and later the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground, a gunpowder factory and testing area started by the U.S. Navy in the late 19th century. At its southern end at Mason Springs, Livingston Road was connected to Indian Head by the La Plata-Indian Head road that later became MD 225. At the District of Columbia boundary in what is now Forest Heights, Livingston Road continued north to Atlantic Street, which connected with Nichols Avenue (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue), which headed north to a crossing of the Anacostia River at the site of the 11th Street Bridges. MD 210 northbound at its continuous-flow intersection with MD 228 in Accokeek The first segment of Livingston Road in Maryland to be paved as a modern highway was from the District of Columbia boundary south to Oxon Hill Road in Oxon Hill, which was paved by Prince George's County with state aid as a macadam road by 1910. A part of this piece of highway later became the northernmost part of Indian Head Highway. Construction of Livingston Road as a modern highway was completed in 1933, when the highway became part of MD 224. Other segments of Livingston Road that were reconstructed as part of Indian Head Highway were from Kerby Hill Road south to Palmer Road and from the Charles-Prince George's county line west to Bryans Road, which were both constructed as gravel roads in 1923. The westernmost portion of Indian Head Highway in the town of Indian Head was a reconstruction of Strauss Avenue, a part of which remains as a street that splits off and parallels MD 210 through the eastern part of the town. By 1934, MD 224 was proposed to be widened from from Oxon Hill to Piscataway. The need for upgrades to Livingston Road became acute by 1940 with the greatly increased activity at Fort Washington and the Indian Head Naval Powder Factory in the years before the United States entered World War II. Indian Head Highway was constructed as a highway on a new alignment in several segments during World War II. Two portions of the highway in Charles County were built by 1944: from the Strauss Avenue split east to approximately the MD 225 intersection, and from the western intersection with Chapman Landing Road to Matthews Road just east of the MD 227 intersection at Bryans Road. No portion of Indian Head Highway was constructed between Bryans Road and Henson Creek by 1944. A section of the highway was built between MD 224 at Kerby Hill Road south of Oxon Hill and MD 224 north of Oxon Hill in 1945. All of Indian Head Highway from Indian Head to Washington was complete by 1946. MD 210 was assigned to the Indian Head-Bryans Road portion of Indian Head Highway by 1949. The designation was applied to the remainder of the highway from Charles County to the District of Columbia in 1956. In 1955, the Maryland State Roads Commission and the Bureau of Public Roads, the predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration, signed an agreement to transfer ownership of the highway from the federal government to the state roads commission. That same year, the Livingston Road portion of MD 224 from Mason Springs to Washington was transferred to county maintenance. MD 210 southbound in Glassmanor The first segment of MD 210 to be expanded to a divided highway was from the District of Columbia boundary south to Livingston Road in Forest Heights, which was expanded to a divided highway by 1950. The highway was expanded to a divided highway from Livingston Road south to MD 414 in Oxon Hill in 1963, the year MD 210's interchange with the Capital Beltway was completed. This junction was originally a full cloverleaf interchange; the ramp from the northbound Beltway for southbound MD 210 and from southbound MD 210 to the northbound Beltway led to and from intersections with MD 414. MD 210 was made a divided highway from Oxon Hill south to near Fort Foote Road in 1965. The portion of MD 210 in the town of Indian Head also was expanded to a divided highway that year. The divided highway in Charles County was extended east to Bryans Road in 1969 and completed to the county line in 1971. MD 210 was reconstructed as a divided highway from Fort Foote Road to MD 373 in 1983. The last segment of two-lane road on MD 210 was eliminated with expansion of the portion between MD 373 and the Charles-Prince George's county line in 1987. A pair of long S-shaped ramps were constructed from southbound I-295 to southbound MD 210 and from northbound MD 210 to both northbound I-495 and northbound I-295 in Oxon Hill in 1989. MD 210 had been widened to a six-lane highway from MD 228 to the Capital Beltway by 1999. MD 228 was extended west from Charles County to MD 210 as a two-lane road in 1995. That highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway in 2000; in addition, the MD 210-MD 228 junction was reconstructed as the second continuous-flow intersection in the United States. In 2004, MD 210 achieved its present southern terminus at Potomac Avenue when the highway from there west to the military reservation gate was transferred to the town of Indian Head. MD 210 was reconstructed in Oxon Hill starting in 2006 in work related to the construction of the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The highway's new bridges over the Capital Beltway and MD 414 and the partial cloverleaf interchange between MD 210 and MD 414 were completed in 2007. The Maryland State Highway Administration has long-term plans to upgrade the nine signalized intersections along MD 210 between MD 228 and MD 414. The agency completed an intermodal study and received federal approval for upgrades along that corridor in 2005. The first intersection to be upgraded will be the junction with Livingston Road and Kerby Hill Road, which will be upgraded to a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange. In addition, the intersection with Wilson Bridge Drive north of Kerby Hill Road will be closed and replaced with a right-in/right-out interchange with southbound MD 210. , engineering plans are being developed for that project. Partial cloverleaf interchanges will also be constructed at Livingston Road and Palmer Road, and at Swan Creek Road. For the Swan Creek Road project, there will be a pair of additional ramps constructed between northbound MD 210 and Livingston Road and the continuity of the latter road will be restored. Diamond interchanges will be built at Fort Washington Road and at both intersections with Old Fort Road. Interchanges will not be constructed at Farmington Road and MD 373; instead, those intersections will be improved with lengthened and additional auxiliary lanes at each intersection.

The route begins as Bald Eagle Road as the north leg of the intersection between MD 414 and that state highway's ramps with southbound MD 210. MD 210V crosses the Beltway, then turns onto the Salt Barn Access Road while Bald Eagle Road continues straight toward the Oxon Hill Farm. The route passes a salt barn before reaching its northern terminus at MD 210's intersection with the southbound exit ramp from the Capital Beltway. The Salt Barn Access Road portion of MD 210V was constructed in 2007. The Bald Eagle Road part of the highway was added in 2009. The roadway was realigned and extended in 2012 to provide a through connection between MD 414 and MD 210.

He served in management roles at the Canadian National Exhibition from 1952 to 1964. Born in 1899 at Caledon East, Ontario, his first job was at The Mail and Empire newspaper as a clerk in the advertising department. From there, he started his own printing plant in 1931. Concern about pollution in Toronto's Eastern beaches caused McCallum to join a small group of other concerned citizens. Then in 1941, he became an alderman for Ward 8. From that start, he moved up (in 1946) to vice-chairperson of the city of Toronto's board of control. It was in 1948 that then mayor Bob Saunders resigned to become chairman of Ontario Hydro. McCallum thus became mayor. As mayor he started Toronto's Yonge Street line and worked towards a regional government. Then in 1950, some 10 years after becoming a politician, he opened a new sewage treatment plant that would reduce pollution in Toronto's Eastern Beaches - his original reason for becoming a politician. In 1952 he was made assistant general manager of the Canadian National Exhibition, then made general manager in 1953. This would be a position he would hold until his retirement in 1964 at age 65. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. Personal life With his wife Margaret he had a daughter Dorothy and a son Bruce, and he was the grandfather of four children.

It is the JASDF's primary base in northern Japan and tasked with monitoring Japan's maritime borders with Russia. It was also Hokkaid≈ç's primary civilian airport until the opening of New Chitose Airport in 1988. Together, these two jointly operated and connected airports create one of the largest regional airports in Japan. History =US military service= Chitose's first flight came in 1926, when the Otaru Shimbun newspaper sponsored the \\"Hokkai One\\" (Hokkai- ichig≈ç) flight, originating at a 10-hectare air field donated by the villagers of Chitose. In 1939, the Imperial Japanese Navy took over the field. After Japan's surrender in 1945, ending World War II, the United States Armed Forces took over the base, being primarily under the control of the United States Army Air Forces, and later the United States Air Force Fifth Air Force. Major USAF occupation units assigned to Chitose Air Base were: * 3d Air Commando Group (309th Bombardment Wing), October 1945-March 1946 * 49th Fighter Group (later Wing), February 1946-April 1948 The base was used largely as a maintenance and logistics facility in the late 1940s prior to the Korean War, under the operational control of the 314th Air Division, Johnson Air Base. Chitose was operated as a sub-base to Johnson AB. As a result of the Korean War, the 6163d Air Base Wing was activated on 1 January 1951. The airfield was used primarily as an emergency landing field for aircraft returning from combat missions over Korea, and as a maintenance and repair depot by Technical Service Command. During the Allied occupation, in 1951, Chitose received its first scheduled civilian flights to Tokyo, operated by Japan Airlines. After the 1953 Korean Armistice, the USAF moved its F-86 Sabre-equipped 4th Fighter Group (later Wing) from Kimpo AB (K-14), South Korea in September 1954. The only American combat unit assigned to Chitose, the squadron provided air defense of Hokkaid≈ç for several years, being inactivated in place on 1 July 1957 due to budget restrictions. With the inactivation of the 4th Fighter Wing, Chitose was phased down for return to Japanese control. The 6029th Support Group was activated and continued support for the units assigned to the base. It was inactivated along with the other United States military units at the base on 31 December 1957, returning the facility over to Japanese control. The US maintained a communications facility at the base until December 1970, and formally ended operations at Chitose on June 30, 1975. =Civilian service= The passenger terminal at Chitose Airport opened in 1963. Chitose quickly overtook Okadama Airport, which was too small to serve jet aircraft, as the main airport serving the Sapporo metropolitan area. Immigration facilities were constructed in 1969, prior to the opening of the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo. The only scheduled international service at Chitose was a Japan Air System flight to Honolulu with a stop at Tokyo Narita, which operated from 1981 to 1987.

If the spaces involved are also topological spaces (that is, topological vector spaces), then it makes sense to ask whether all linear maps are continuous. It turns out that for maps defined on infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces (e.g., infinite-dimensional normed spaces), the answer is generally no: there exist discontinuous linear maps. If the domain of definition is complete, it is trickier; such maps can be proven to exist, but the proof relies on the axiom of choice and does not provide an explicit example.  A linear map from a finite-dimensional space is always continuous  Let X and Y be two normed spaces and f a linear map from X to Y. If X is finite- dimensional, choose a basis (e1, e2, ‚Ä¶, en) in X which may be taken to be unit vectors. Then, :f(x)=sum^n_{i=1}x_if(e_i), and so by the triangle inequality, :f(x)= leftsum^n_{i=1}x_if(e_i)right le sum^n_{i=1} x_if(e_i). Letting :M=sup_i {f(e_i)}, and using the fact that :sum^n_{i=1}x_ile C x for some C>0 which follows from the fact that any two norms on a finite-dimensional space are equivalent, one finds :f(x)le left(sum^n_{i=1}x_iright)Mle CMx. Thus, f is a bounded linear operator and so is continuous. In fact, to see this, simply note that f is linear, and therefore f(x)-f(x') = f(x-x') le K x-x' for some universal constant K. Thus for any epsilon>0, we can choose deltale epsilon/K so that f(B(x,delta)) subseteq B(f(x), epsilon) (B(x, delta) and B(f(x), epsilon) are the normed balls around x and f(x)), which gives continuity. If X is infinite-dimensional, this proof will fail as there is no guarantee that the supremum M exists. If Y is the zero space {0}, the only map between X and Y is the zero map which is trivially continuous. In all other cases, when X is infinite-dimensional and Y is not the zero space, one can find a discontinuous map from X to Y.  A concrete example  Examples of discontinuous linear maps are easy to construct in spaces that are not complete; on any Cauchy sequence of independent vectors which does not have a limit, a linear operator may grow without bound. In a sense, the linear operators are not continuous because the space has \\"holes\\". For example, consider the space X of real-valued smooth functions on the interval [0, 1] with the uniform norm, that is, : f=sup_{xin [0, 1]}f(x). The derivative-at-a-point map, given by :T(f)=f'(0), defined on X and with real values, is linear, but not continuous. Indeed, consider the sequence :f_n(x)=frac{sin (n^2 x)}{n} for n‚â•1. This sequence converges uniformly to the constantly zero function, but :T(f_n)=frac{n^2cos(n^2 cdot 0)}{n}=nto infty as n‚Üí‚àû instead of T(f_n)to T(0)=0 which would hold for a continuous map. Note that T is real-valued, and so is actually a linear functional on X (an element of the algebraic dual space X*). The linear map X ‚Üí X which assigns to each function its derivative is similarly discontinuous. Note that although the derivative operator is not continuous, it is closed. The fact that the domain is not complete here is important. Discontinuous operators on complete spaces require a little more work.  A nonconstructive example  An algebraic basis for the real numbers as a vector space over the rationals is known as a Hamel basis (note that some authors use this term in a broader sense to mean an algebraic basis of any vector space). Note that any two noncommensurable numbers, say 1 and œÄ, are linearly independent. One may find a Hamel basis containing them, and define a map f from R to R so that f(œÄ) = 0, f acts as the identity on the rest of the Hamel basis, and extend to all of R by linearity. Let {rn}n be any sequence of rationals which converges to œÄ. Then limn f(rn) = œÄ, but f(œÄ) = 0. By construction, f is linear over Q (not over R), but not continuous. Note that f is also not measurable; an additive real function is linear if and only if it is measurable, so for every such function there is a Vitali set. The construction of f relies on the axiom of choice. This example can be extended into a general theorem about the existence of discontinuous linear maps on any infinite-dimensional normed space (as long as the codomain is not trivial).  General existence theorem  Discontinuous linear maps can be proven to exist more generally even if the space is complete. Let X and Y be normed spaces over the field K where K = R or K = C. Assume that X is infinite-dimensional and Y is not the zero space. We will find a discontinuous linear map f from X to K, which will imply the existence of a discontinuous linear map g from X to Y given by the formula g(x) = f(x)y0 where y0 is an arbitrary nonzero vector in Y. If X is infinite- dimensional, to show the existence of a linear functional which is not continuous then amounts to constructing f which is not bounded. For that, consider a sequence (en)n (n ‚â• 1) of linearly independent vectors in X. Define :T(e_n)=ne_n, for each n = 1, 2, ... Complete this sequence of linearly independent vectors to a vector space basis of X, and define T at the other vectors in the basis to be zero. T so defined will extend uniquely to a linear map on X, and since it is clearly not bounded, it is not continuous. Notice that by using the fact that any set of linearly independent vectors can be completed to a basis, we implicitly used the axiom of choice, which was not needed for the concrete example in the previous section but one.  Role of the axiom of choice  As noted above, the axiom of choice (AC) is used in the general existence theorem of discontinuous linear maps. In fact, there are no constructive examples of discontinuous linear maps with complete domain (for example, Banach spaces). In analysis as it is usually practiced by working mathematicians, the axiom of choice is always employed (it is an axiom of ZFC set theory); thus, to the analyst, all infinite-dimensional topological vector spaces admit discontinuous linear maps. On the other hand, in 1970 Robert M. Solovay exhibited a model of set theory in which every set of reals is measurable.. This implies that there are no discontinuous linear real functions. Clearly AC does not hold in the model. Solovay's result shows that it is not necessary to assume that all infinite-dimensional vector spaces admit discontinuous linear maps, and there are schools of analysis which adopt a more constructivist viewpoint. For example, H. G. Garnir, in searching for so-called \\"dream spaces\\" (topological vector spaces on which every linear map into a normed space is continuous), was led to adopt ZF + DC + BP (dependent choice is a weakened form and the Baire property is a negation of strong AC) as his axioms to prove the Garnir‚ÄìWright closed graph theorem which states, among other things, that any linear map from an F-space to a TVS is continuous. Going to the extreme of constructivism, there is Ceitin's theorem, which states that every function is continuous (this is to be understood in the terminology of constructivism, according to which only representable functions are considered to be functions).. Such stances are held by only a small minority of working mathematicians. The upshot is that the existence of discontinuous linear maps depends on AC; it is consistent with set theory without AC that there are no discontinuous linear maps on complete spaces. In particular, no concrete construction such as the derivative can succeed in defining a discontinuous linear map everywhere on a complete space.  Closed operators  Many naturally occurring linear discontinuous operators are closed, a class of operators which share some of the features of continuous operators. It makes sense to ask which linear operators on a given space are closed. The closed graph theorem asserts that an everywhere-defined closed operator on a complete domain is continuous, so to obtain a discontinuous closed operator, one must permit operators which are not defined everywhere. To be more concrete, let T be a map from X to Y with domain operatorname{Dom}(T), written T: operatorname{Dom}(T)subseteq Xto Y. We don't lose much if we replace X by the closure of operatorname{Dom}(T). That is, in studying operators that are not everywhere-defined, one may restrict one's attention to densely defined operators without loss of generality. If the graph Gamma(T) of T is closed in X √óY, we call T closed. Otherwise, consider its closure overline{Gamma(T)} in X √óY. If overline{Gamma(T)} is itself the graph of some operator overline{T}, T is called closable, and overline{T} is called the closure of T. So the natural question to ask about linear operators that are not everywhere-defined is whether they are closable. The answer is, \\"not necessarily\\"; indeed, every infinite-dimensional normed space admits linear operators that are not closable. As in the case of discontinuous operators considered above, the proof requires the axiom of choice and so is in general nonconstructive, though again, if X is not complete, there are constructible examples. In fact, there is even an example of a linear operator whose graph has closure all of X √óY. Such an operator is not closable. Let X be the space of polynomial functions from [0,1] to R and Y the space of polynomial functions from [2,3] to R. They are subspaces of C([0,1]) and C([2,3]) respectively, and so normed spaces. Define an operator T which takes the polynomial function x ‚Ü¶ p(x) on [0,1] to the same function on [2,3]. As a consequence of the Stone‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem, the graph of this operator is dense in X√óY, so this provides a sort of maximally discontinuous linear map (confer nowhere continuous function). Note that X is not complete here, as must be the case when there is such a constructible map.  Impact for dual spaces  The dual space of a topological vector space is the collection of continuous linear maps from the space into the underlying field. Thus the failure of some linear maps to be continuous for infinite-dimensional normed spaces implies that for these spaces, one needs to distinguish the algebraic dual space from the continuous dual space which is then a proper subset. It illustrates the fact that an extra dose of caution is needed in doing analysis on infinite-dimensional spaces as compared to finite- dimensional ones.  Beyond normed spaces  The argument for the existence of discontinuous linear maps on normed spaces can be generalized to all metrisable topological vector spaces, especially to all Fr√©chet-spaces, but there exist infinite-dimensional locally convex topological vector spaces such that every functional is continuous.For example, the weak topology w.r.t. the space of all (algebraically) linear functionals. On the other hand, the Hahn‚ÄìBanach theorem, which applies to all locally convex spaces, guarantees the existence of many continuous linear functionals, and so a large dual space. In fact, to every convex set, the Minkowski gauge associates a continuous linear functional. The upshot is that spaces with fewer convex sets have fewer functionals, and in the worst-case scenario, a space may have no functionals at all other than the zero functional. This is the case for the Lp(R,dx) spaces with 0 < p < 1, from which it follows that these spaces are nonconvex. Note that here is indicated the Lebesgue measure on the real line. There are other Lp spaces with 0 < p < 1 which do have nontrivial dual spaces. Another such example is the space of real-valued measurable functions on the unit interval with quasinorm given by :f = int_I frac{f(x)}{1+f(x)}dx. This non-locally convex space has a trivial dual space. One can consider even more general spaces. For example, the existence of a homomorphism between complete separable metric groups can also be shown nonconstructively.

Owned and bred by Greentree Stable, Capot was trained by John M. Gaver, Sr.  Two-year-old season  Racing as a two-year-old, Capot won the Champagne Stakes and the Wakefield Stakes. He capped off the year with his best performance in the prestigious Pimlico Futurity.  Three-year-old season  At age three, Capot entered the 1949 Kentucky Derby as a 13-1 longshot. Ridden by Ted Atkinson in all the American Triple Crown races, Capot broke from the gate well and was forwardly placed early. He charged to the front of the field on the backstretch and held on willingly but was unable to withstand the rush from winner Ponder. Easily the best of the rest, he finished second, lengths in front of Palestinian. Then, in the second jewel of the Triple Crown, Capot opened as the 2.5-1 second favorite in the field of ten in the $75,000 Preakness. In that race, all broke well, and Capot sprinted near the lead in second as he passed the stands for the first time. Going into Pimlico's famous clubhouse turn, he was steadied in close quarters but held his position. Just inside the furlong pole coming down the lane, Capot assumed control and drew clear under pressure to stave off the rally of Palestinian and win by a head. It was three more lengths back to Noble Impulse in third, as favorite Ponder finished fifth. Capot won the Belmont Stakes three weeks later. His performances earned him 1949's Three-Year-Old Male Champion honors. He was also named the 1949 Horse of the Year by the Daily Racing Form but lost the Turf and Sport Digest poll to Coaltown.  Four-year-old season  At age four, Capot won major stakes races including the 1950 Pimlico Special Handicap at \\"Old Hilltop\\" in Baltimore, Maryland.

This system was called Skj√∫ts. It involved a Skj√∫tsskaffari, or agent, being appointed in every village with the duty of organising a crew to transport people, letters or parcels from one village to another. The Skj√∫ts system was actually introduced in around the mid-1860s, with the first Skj√∫ts Act coming into force in 1865. Skj√∫ts charges were laid down by the L√∏gting, the Faroese Representative Council, for 5 years at a time. There were three types of Skj√∫ts: *Official *Clerical *and Private. The charges for Skj√∫ts varied, with official being the cheapest and Private the most expensive. There was no charge for Skj√∫ts prior to 1865. All healthy males of between 15 and 50 years of age were liable for Skj√∫ts, i.e. they could not refuse without incurring a fine. It was never an easy task to transport mail from one island to another across perilous waters where there were often powerful currents. Conscripted post boat (skj√∫tsb√°tur). Peter S. Johannesen, who was one of the first post carriers, tells of a letter delivery from the days of Skj√∫ts. The letter, which had to go from T√≥rshavn to Hvalba on Su√∞uroy, was marked K.T. (i.e., Kongelig Tjeneste ‚Äì On His Majesty's Service) and bore the endorsement Uopholdelig Befordring (For Immediate Delivery): i.e. it had to be dispatched as soon as the weather permitted. > The letter was first given to the Skj√∫ts agent in T√≥rshavn, who immediately > got hold of a man liable for Skj√∫ts. The man walked from T√≥rshavn to > Kirkjub√∏ur, where he handed the letter over to the Skj√∫ts agent in the > village. The agent got a boat with eight men to carry the letter to Sandoy ‚Äì > to where the village of Skopun lies today.

Owing to strong > currents and bad weather the Skj√∫ts crew were unable to row back to Dalur > that evening. The weather worsened during the night and the men had to stay > on the island for two weeks. The Skj√∫ts system existed right up until around World War I, but was not used as much by then, as the Post Office's rates were relatively low and so represented a reasonable alternative. =First post offices= Post Office, T√≥rshavn The first Faroese post office was opened in T√≥rshavn on 1 March 1870. The local s√Ωsluma√∞ur at the time on the southern part of Streymoy, H.C. M√ºller, was in charge of the management of the post office for the first several years. On 1 March 1884, the post office on Tv√∏royri was opened. The third post office on the Faroes was opened in Klaksv√≠k on 1 May 1888. Both on Tv√∏royri and in T√≥rshavn, the management of the post was conducted by the local s√Ωsluma√∞ur. In the 19th century, there were only these three post offices. After the turn of the century, the pace picked up. In 1903, seven post offices were opened. During the following twenty-five years, post offices were opened in essentially all of the settlements on the Faroes. Most of them were opened in 1918, when fifteen new post offices were added. Starting in the late 1960s and continuing up to the present, a number of post offices have been closed. Postal service for the inhabitants of these settlements is now conducted by service agents. This change is part of the efficiency policy which the Faroese post office has been pursuing for the last few years. Until 1 April 1976, the Faroese postal system was under the direction of Post Danmark (Post and Telegraph System). At that time the Faroese postal system was organised so that it had a post office (T√≥rshavn Post Office) managed by a postmaster. Then came the postal clerks with the so-called postal agents as managers. The postal clerks were located in the following settlements: Klaksv√≠k, Tv√∏royri, V√°gur, Vestmanna and Saltangar√°. All the other post offices were divided into two groups. The larger ones were called \\"letter collection sites\\", and the smaller were called \\"postal exchange sites\\". In 1906, T√≥rshavn Post Office got its own building. Together with T√≥rshavn, these five post offices are still the main post offices. =Founding of Postverk F√∏roya= After the election for the L√∏gting in November 1974, the government decided that the postal service in the Faroes should be taken over by the Faroese Home Rule. In 1975, the Danish government and the Faroese government began negotiations on the take-over issue. The results of these negotiations led to the Faroese government taking over the postal service in the Faroes as of 1 April 1976. This new institution received the name Postverk F√∏roya (Post of the Faroes). A ram's horn was chosen as the institution's logo. As a natural consequence of the take-over, two new departments were established within the Faroese postal system: * The Postage Stamp Department. * The Post Office Giro. Work was being done on restructuring the Faroese postal system, with the intent being for Postverk F√∏roya, which was a public institution, to be reorganised into a type of joint-stock enterprise. The postal system however continued to be a public company. Philatelic history Modern Post Office in Klaksv√≠k. Having used Danish stamps since 1870, the Faroes finally began their own issues on 30 January 1975 when the Danish postal system began issues with the caption F√òROYAR. Since 1 April 1976, the Postage Stamp Department of Postverk F√∏roya has assumed full responsibility for all Faroese postage stamps including production and issue.

The road operated as the southern terminus of the expressway in the early 1980s before Interstate 75 extended south to Naples. Route description SR 681 begins at an interchange with US 41/SR 45 in Nokomis, heading north as a four-lane freeway. The road passes through developments, coming to a bridge over the Legacy Trail, a rail trail. The freeway heads northeast coming to an at-grade signalized intersection with Honore Avenue. A short distance later, SR 681 merges onto the northbound direction of I-75/SR 93 at an interchange. History State Road 681 opened to traffic in 1980 when segments of Interstate 75 between Tampa and Naples were still under construction. At the time, it served as the southern terminus of Interstate 75. An access management plan, coordinated between Florida Department of Transportation and Sarasota County, for SR 681 was adopted in December 2005 to establish access points along the limited-access road, reclassifying the road as a \\"modified limited access\\" road. The access management plan established the planned locations of at-grade intersections along SR 681 for future growth adjacent to the highway. In April 2016, the final phase of Sarasota County's Honore Avenue Extension was completed. The road project provides a full access signalized intersection at Honore Avenue which was previously only accessible via southbound SR 681. Interstate 75 could only be entered going northbound and exited on to SR 681 southbound until the completion of the Honore Avenue expansion. This also made Honore Avenue the first contiguous road to run from Venice north to the Sarasota County line since 1982 when State Road 681 was constructed.

The name is possibly derived from \\"scabinos\\", a Medieval Latin adaptation of Frankish \\"Skabins\\", found in Lombardic legislation designating a category of minor government officials forming a corps qualified in legal proceedings. An alternate etymology is that it would be derived from \\"scappino\\", dialectal Italian for the upper part of footwear. Still another possibility is that it comes from the word for flee or escape.

He was a pupil of the Talmudist Rabbi Aryeh Leib ben Asher Gunzberg who was the author of Sha'agat Aryeh; and, being an expert in political economy, he maintained close relations with Prince Potemkin, the favorite of Catherine II. During the Turko-Russian war, Zeitlin furnished the Russian army with various supplies, and managed that business so cleverly that he was afterward appointed imperial court councilor. On retiring from business in the civil rank of Court Counsellor, Zeitlin resided on his estate Ustzia, where he was occasionally consulted by rabbis with regard to rabbinical questions. He rendered pecuniary assistance to many Talmudists and scholars, and supported a magnificent beit midrash, in which many Jewish scholars were provided with all of life's necessities, so that they could pursue their vocations without worries of any kind. Among the scholars who benefited from his generosity were: Rabbi Nahum, author of Tosafot Bikkurim; Mendel Lepin, author of Cheshbon ha-Nefesh; and the physician Baruch Schick. Zeitlin was the author of annotations to the Sefer Mitzwot Katan, printed with the text (Kopys, 1820), and supplemented by some of his responsa.

Built in the late 14th century by Sir John Delamare on the profits of his involvement in the Hundred Years War, the moated castle's architectural style, possibly influenced by the design of French castles, has provoked considerable academic debate. Remodelled during the late 16th century, Nunney Castle was damaged during the English Civil War and is now ruined. English Heritage maintains the site as a tourist attraction. The architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner has described Nunney as \\"aesthetically the most impressive castle in Somerset.\\" History =14th century= Nunney Castle was built near the village of Nunney in Somerset by Sir John Delamare.Emery, p.604. Delamare had been a soldier during the Hundred Years War with France, where he had made his fortune.Pettifer, p.223. He obtained a licence to crenellate from Edward III to build a castle on the site of his existing, unfortified manor house in 1373 and set about developing a new, substantial fortification.Nunney Castle, Somerset Historic Environment Record, Somerset County Council, accessed 1 July 2011. The resulting castle centred on a stone tower-keep, measuring 60 feet by 24 feet (18 m by 7 m) internally and 54 feet (16 m) tall, with four round corner-towers.Gomme and Maguire, p.15Rigold, p.10. The tower-keep had eight-foot (2.4 m) thick walls made from Lias Oolite ashlar stone and was designed around three floors.Emery, pp.604-5Ashurst and Dimes, p.99. The corner towers had conical roofs and prominent machicolations. The ground floor of the tower-house included the kitchen and other service areas. The functions of the first and second floors are uncertain; one theory is that the first floor was another service area, with the hall on the second floor; another approach argues that the first floor formed the hall, and the second floor living accommodation; a minority view proposes that the first floor was an armoury.Rigold, p.11. The third floor was used as living accommodation for the owning family. The original design had a number of windows and fireplaces on the upper floors, but the hall would have been relatively dark and the stairs were inconveniently narrow.Emery, p.605. Plan of Nunney Castle; A - moat; B - revetment; C - site of drawbridge; D - well; E - fireplace; F - tower-keep The tower-keep had a modest entrance, which was reached by a draw-bridge that lay across the surrounding moat, which initially reached right up to the base of the castle. A simple, 12-foot (3.6 m) high bailey wall, with minimal defensive value, surrounded the moat, which was in contrast wide, 10-foot (3 m) deep, and would have been difficult for an attacker to drain.Brown, p.94.King, p.157. On the east side of the castle Nunney Brook was used as a line of defence rather than a bailey wall. Historians, such as Adrian Pettifer and Stuart Rigold, previously believed that the design of Nunney was heavily influenced by the French castle designs that Delamare would have seen on his military campaigns. Nunney closely resembles the Bastille in Paris, for example, and the machicolations are typical of those found in French castles. Nunney was considered a conservative, even slightly backward design and probably built to protect against French invasion. Historians such as Robert Liddiard and Matthew Johnson are now less certain. Nunney is regarded as a bold, striking design, similar in many ways to those at Herstmonceux or Saltwood Castle.Liddiard, p.58. Whilst Nunney does resemble many French castles, there is no direct evidence that it was built in imitation of these designs, and indeed there are other English castles, such as Mulgrave and Dudley, that have a similar structure to Nunney's.Johnson, pp.32, 110. Nunney Castle may be better understood instead as characteristic of a wider range of tower-keeps built in England during the period, designed, as Nigel Pounds puts it, \\"to allow very rich men to live in luxury and splendour.\\"Pounds, p.270. =15th - 16th centuries= Nunney Castle was inherited by John's son, Philip Delamere, and grandson, Elias, before passing by marriage into the Poulet family following Elias' probable death during Henry V's campaigns in France.Rigold, pp.4-5. Sir John Poulet and his son John, and grandson, also called John, held the castle during most of the 15th century, but their primary residence was Basing Castle in Hampshire rather than Nunney.Rigold, p.5. William Paulet, the Marquess of Winchester, was the final member of the family to own the castle; after his death in 1572 it passed rapidly through several owners and in 1577 was sold by Swithun Thorpe to John Parker, who only kept it for a year before selling it to Richard Prater, at a cost of ¬£2,000.Dunning (2005), p.22. The castle was redeveloped in the second half of the 16th century, probably by the Praters: the windows were enlarged to let in more light; a grand staircase was built in one of the towers; a Catholic altar was installed, and a revetment, or terrace, was built around the inside of the moat, leaving it 25 feet (7.6 m) wide.Rigold, pp.9-10, 14Dunning (2007), p.67 =17th - 19th centuries= Drawing of Nunney Castle, 1644 Nunney Castle continued to be owned by the Roman Catholic Prater family into the 17th century.Rigold, p.6. In 1642 the English Civil War broke out between the rival factions of Parliament and the king; like many Catholics, Colonel Richard Prater supported Charles I. As the war progressed the Royalist situation deteriorated, however, and the south- west became one of the few remaining Royalist strongholds; Nunney Castle was garrisoned in anticipation of Parliamentary attack and took in a number of refugees, including many Catholics.Wedgwood, pp. 496‚Äì7. In September 1645 a Parliamentary army under the command of Lord Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell advanced into Somerset, taking Sherborne, Cary and Shepton Mallet before turning to Nunney. Two regiments of soldiers with cannons surrounded the castle on 18 September; when Richard Prater refused to surrender, the cannons opened fire on the north side of the castle, breaching the castle wall. Richard continued to resist, hoisting a flag with a Catholic crucifix on it above the castle to taunt the besiegers, but two days later the garrison surrendered. Due to the damage caused by the cannon, the castle escaped the slighting, or deliberate damaging, that occurred to many other castles at the end of the civil war. Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite his promises to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660.Rigold, pp.6-7. Nunney Castle in the 18th century The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700.Rigold, p.7. During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received to make it ready to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely that they ever arrived.Dunning (1995), pp.63-65. =20th - 21st centuries= The interior of Nunney Castle, showing the three floors By the 20th century, Nunney Castle was increasingly ruined and covered in thick ivy. As a result, on 25 December 1910 a portion of the damaged north wall entirely collapsed ‚Äî most of the fallen stone is believed to have been stolen by local residents. In 1926, with the fabric of the castle under threat, the owner, Robert Bailey-Neale, transferred the property to the Commissioner of Works, who began a programme of restoration work. The castle is now run by English Heritage as a tourist attraction and is a scheduled monument.Nunney Castle, Gatehouse website, accessed 9 June 2011.

Grappling holds are used principally to control the opponent and to advance in points or positioning. The holds may be categorized by their function, such as clinching, pinning, or submission, while others can be classified by their anatomical effect: chokehold, headlock, joint-lock, or compression lock. Multiple categories may be appropriate for some of these holds. Clinch hold A clinch hold (also known as a clinching hold) is a grappling hold that is used in clinch fighting with the purpose of controlling the opponent. In wrestling it is referred to as the tie-up. The use of a clinch hold results in the clinch. Clinch holds can be used to close in on the opponent, as a precursor to a takedown or throw, or to prevent the opponent from moving away or striking effectively. Typical clinch holds include: * Bear hug * Collar tie * Overhook * Pinch grip tie * Underhook Two soldiers in a \\"69\\" position Pinning hold A pinning hold (also known as a hold down and in Japanese as osaekomi-waza, Êäë„ÅàËæº„ÅøÊäÄ, \\"pinning technique\\") is a general grappling hold used in ground fighting that is aimed to subdue by exerting superior control over an opponent and pinning the opponent to the ground. Pinning holds where both of the opponent's shoulders touch the ground are considered winning conditions in several combat sports. An effective pinning hold is a winning condition in many styles of wrestling, and is known as simply a \\"pin\\". Pinning holds maintained for 20 seconds are also a winning condition in Judo. Pinning holds are also used in submission wrestling and mixed martial arts, even though the pinning hold itself is not a winning condition. The holds can be used to rest while the opponent tries to escape, to control the opponent while striking, a tactic known as ground and pound, or to control an opponent from striking by pinning them to the ground, also known as lay and pray. Submission hold In combat sports a submission hold (colloquially referred to as a \\"submission\\") is a grappling hold that is applied with the purpose of forcing an opponent to submit out of either extreme pain or fear of injury. Submission holds are used primarily in ground fighting and can be separated into constrictions (chokeholds, compression locks, suffocation locks) and manipulations (joint locks, leverages, pain compliance holds). When used, these techniques may cause dislocation, torn ligaments, bone fractures, unconsciousness, or even death. Common combat sports featuring submission holds are: * Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu * Catch wrestling * Judo * Jujutsu * Mixed martial arts * Sambo * Shoot wrestling List of grappling holds The same hold may be called by different names in different arts or countries. Some of the more common names for grappling holds in contemporary English include: =Joint locks= Joint lock: Any stabilization of one or more joints at their normal extreme range of motion * Can opener: A type of neck crank * Crucifix: A type of neck crank * Neck crank: Applies pressure to the neck by pulling or twisting the head * Nelson: (quarter, half, three-quarter and full): The arm is circled under the opponent's arm, and secured at the neck * Small joint manipulation: Joint locks on the fingers or toes * Spine crank: Applies pressure to the spine by twisting or bending the body * Twister: A type of body bend and neck crank * Wristlock: A general term for joint locks on the wrist or radioulnar joint;

Brill. Abraham Arden Brill (October 12, 1874 ‚Äì March 2, 1948) was an Austrian-born psychiatrist who spent almost his entire adult life in the United States. He was the first psychoanalyst to practice in the United States and the first translator of Sigmund Freud into English. Education Brill was born in Ka≈Ñczuga, Austrian Galicia. He arrived in the United States alone and penniless at the age of 15. Working continuously to finance his studies,P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 209 he eventually graduated from New York University in 1901 and obtained his M.D. from Columbia University in 1903. Ernest Jones commented with admiration: \\"He might have been called a rough diamond, but there was no doubt about the diamond\\". Brill spent the next 4 years working at Central Islip State Hospital on Long Island. Life Brill married Dr. K. Rose Owen, with whom he had two children. He died at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York on March 2, 1948. Career After studying with Eugen Bleuler in Zurich, Switzerland, he met Freud, with whom he maintained a correspondence until Freud's death in 1939. He returned to the United States in 1908 to become one of the earliest and most active exponents of psychoanalysis, being the first to translate into English most of the major works of Freud, as well as books by Jung. His first translation of Freud appeared in 1909 as Some Papers on Hysteria; and while the quality of his translations might at times be challenged, his overall contribution to the fostering of psychoanalysis in America cannot.Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1964) p. 335-6 and p. 563-4 He campaigned for academic recognition of his field, lectured at Columbia University, and became clinical professor of psychiatry at New York University. He maintained a psychoanalytic practice as well. In 1911 he founded the New York Psychoanalytic Society (or Institute) and later helped found the American Psychoanalytic Association. The library of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute is named in his honor. Although opposed in principle to Lay analysis - \\"psychoanalysis...can be utilized only by persons who have been trained in anatomy and pathology\\"P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 495-8 - rather than split the International movement, in 1929 he made a tactical concession to Freud,P. Gay, Freud (1989) p. 499-500 and as head of the New York Psychoanalytic Society, sanctioned the limited introduction of lay analysts to the profession, which had previously restricted its ranks to medical professionals. During the 1930s he played a key role in finding employment for psychiatric professionals exiled from Nazi Europe. Once sympathetic to homosexuals, he revised his views and wrote in 1940 that \\"even so-called classical inverts are not entirely free from some paranoid traits\\". Edward Bernays consulted with Brill on the subject of women's smoking and borrowed the term \\"torches of freedom\\" from Brill. One of his last pieces of writing - his preface to Eric Berne's 1947 study, The Mind in Action - commends Berne's ability to \\"expound the new psychology without the affectivity of the older Freudians\\", placing his tribute in the context of himself \\"having read everything written on Freud and psychoanalysis since I first introduced him here\\".Preface, Eric Berne, A Layman's Guide to Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis (1976) p. 13-4  Publications  * Psychoanalysis: Its Theories and Practical Application (1912) * Fundamental Conceptions of Psychoanalysis (1921) ; Translations of Freud: * Selected Papers on Hysteria (1909) * Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex (1910) * The Interpretation of Dreams (1913) * The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (1914) * Selected papers on hysteria and other psychoneuroses (1912) * Leonardo da Vinci: A PSYCHOSEXUAL STUDY OF AN INFANTILE REMINISCENCE (1916) * Wit and its relation to the unconscious (1917) * Totem and Taboo (1919) * Studies in Hysteria (1937) ; Translations of Jung: * Psychology of Dementia Praecox (1909) See also * S√°ndor Ferenczi * Otto Rank  References  Further reading * Nathan G.

History George Lyttelton had been a master at Eton College, where he encouraged the literary tastes of the teenaged Hart- Davis during the latter's final year (1925‚Äì26) there. After Hart-Davis left Eton their paths diverged, but they embarked on a weekly correspondence in 1955, by which time Lyttelton had retired and Hart-Davis had become an eminent (if not outstandingly profitable) publisher. The letters continued without a break for the rest of Lyttelton's life. In 1978, 16 years after Lyttelton's death, Hart-Davis began publishing the correspondence, and by 1984 all the letters had been published, in six volumes. The philosopher A. C. Grayling observed: :Hart-Davis was a civilised and well-connected man, whose quotidian avocations brought him into contact with almost all the great literary, theatrical and musical names of the 1950s and 1960s. His letters are casually star-studded, and give absorbing glimpses of the affairs of the Literary Society, the London Library, publishing, and a long cast-list of celebrities from Siegfried Sassoon to T.S. Eliot, from Winston Churchill to the Fleming brothers Ian and Peter (the latter a brilliant prose-stylist). Throughout the period of the correspondence (1955-1962), he was editing the letters of Oscar Wilde, a mammoth undertaking whose difficulties and challenges are documented in great detail in the letters, giving a satisfying portrayal of what dedication in literary scholarship looks like from the inside...But the indisputable star of the show is George Lyttelton. What a wonderfully well- stocked, amusing, perceptive, agreeable mind! And what a genius as a letter- writer, touching exactly the right notes with every stroke of his pen, which is a fountain of allusion and delicious wit.A. C. Grayling in The Independent on Sunday, 30 September 2001, p. 17. In The Times Philip Ziegler commented, \\"If twentieth century civilisation has to put forward one champion by which it will be judged, their letters would not be an unworthy candidate.\\"Quoted on the cover of the paperback of Volumes 3 & 4. Kenneth Rose, in The Sunday Telegraph, called the letters, \\"One of the most urbane, civilised and entertaining correspondences of our time.\\" The Independent on Sunday commented, \\"Lyttelton's wit and huge fund of literary knowledge make every page of this volume a complete delight. He is ably abetted by Hart-Davis, who well understood how to elicit the gems from Lyttelton's mighty store. The result is one of the most enjoyable books in the world.\\" Content of the correspondence The letters are bookish, revealing a shared delight in, and encyclopaedic knowledge of, the English language and its texts. Neither man made claim to expertise in music or the visual arts, where their tastes were conventional;Lyttelton and Hart-Davis, Volume 1, p. 38; and Volume 2, p. 136 their forte was literature.

The meter indirectly measures the degree of mismatch between a transmission line and its load (usually an antenna). Technicians use it to evaluate the effectiveness of impedance matching efforts. Directional SWR meter A directional SWR meter measures the magnitude of the forward and reflected waves by sensing each one individually, with directional couplers. A calculation then produces the SWR. A simple directional SWR meter Referring to the above diagram, the transmitter (TX) and antenna (ANT) terminals connect via an internal transmission line. This main line is electromagnetically coupled to two smaller sense lines (directional couplers). These are terminated with resistors at one end and diode rectifiers at the other. Some meters use a printed circuit board with three parallel traces to make the transmission line and two sensing lines. The resistors match the characteristic impedance of the sense lines. The diodes convert the magnitudes of the forward and reverse waves to the terminals FWD and REV, respectively, as DC voltages, which are smoothed by the capacitors. The meter or amplifier (not shown) connected to the FWD and REV terminals acts as the required drain resistor, and determines the dwell-time of the meter reading. Interior view of an SWR meter. The three parallel coupled lines are visible. Diodes, capacitors and termination resistors are mounted at the ends of the sense lines. To calculate the SWR, first calculate the reflection coefficient: :Gamma = frac{V_{rev}}{;V_{fwd};} (the voltages should include a relative phase factor). Then calculate the SWR: :mathsf{SWR} = Biggl , frac{1 + Gamma}{;1 - Gamma;} , Biggr ~. In a passive meter, this is usually indicated on a non-linear scale. Radio operators' SWR meters For decades radio operators have built and used SWR meters as a simple tuning and diagnostic tool. With shielding compromised, a pair of coax or twinline transmission lines, placed close enough, suffer crosstalk. A wave moving in the driven line induces waves in the measurement line. Placed in parallel (straight or loosely coiled) a driven wave reinforces or cancels an induced wave in the same or opposite direction. If the cable pair exceeds half wavelength, cancellation is complete, and power dissipated in matched termination is approximately proportional to the forward and reflected power. Measurement of matched termination Measurement of mismatched termination The approximation improves as crosstalk weakens and harmonic number increases. Over time, nonlinear high gain amplifiers have replaced nonlinear electro- mechanical movements ‚Äì which replaced incandescent bulbs ‚Äì to require less cross-talk and improve linear frequency range. Because all frequencies above minimum contribute, the measured ratio is a single frequency quality measure, that increases with unintended harmonics and spurious emissions, as well as actual SWR. By analogy, the measurement cable is a crystal radio (non- discriminating receiver) representing all the radio receivers that might suffer interference from dirty emissions. Though called an SWR Meter, a low measured ratio indicates not only good match, but also clean A3, F3, or G3 emission without excessive harmonics nor spurious (out-of-channel) power. SWR bridge SWR can also be measured using an impedance bridge. The bridge is balanced (0 Volts across the detector) only when the test impedance exactly matches the reference impedance. When a transmission line is mismatched (), its input impedance deviates from its characteristic impedance; thus, a bridge can be used to determine the presence or absence of a low SWR. To test for a match, the reference impedance of the bridge is set to the expected load impedance (for example, 50 Ohms), and the transmission line connected as the unknown impedance. RF power is applied to the circuit. The voltage at the line input represents the vector sum of the forward wave, and the wave reflected from the load. If we know the characteristic impedance of the line is 50 Ohms, we know the magnitude and phase of the forward wave. It's the same wave present on the other side of the detector. Subtracting this known wave from the wave at the line input yields the reflected wave. Properly designed, a bridge circuit can not only indicate a match, but the degree of mismatch ‚Äì making it possible to calculate the SWR. This usually involves alternately connecting the reference wave and the reflected wave to a power meter, and comparing the magnitudes of the resulting deflections. Limitations An SWR meter does not measure the actual impedance of a load (the resistance and reactance), but only the mismatch ratio. To measure the actual impedance requires an antenna analyzer or other similar RF measuring device. For accurate readings, the SWR meter itself must also match the line's impedance (typically 50 or 75 Ohms). To accommodate multiple impedances, some SWR meters have switches that select the impedance appropriate for the sense lines. An SWR meter should connect to the line as close as possible to the antenna: All practical transmission lines have a certain amount of loss, which attenuates the reflected wave as it travels back along the line. Thus, the SWR is highest closest to the load, and only improves as the distance from the load increases, creating the false impression of a matched system.

It broadcasts a range of programs from CCTV Headquarters at East 3rd Ring Road in Beijing and is available to both cable and terrestrial television viewers. The terrestrial signal of CCTV-1 is free-to-air across China. However, due to copyright restrictions, the satellite signal of CCTV-1 is encrypted, and smartcards are necessary for decryption.According to LyngSat site, the encryption for CCTV-1 is VideoGuard. History =Peking Television (2 May 195830 April 1978)= Initially branded as Peking Television (not to be confused with the present-day Beijing Television), CCTV-1 was launched on an experimental basis on 2 May 1958 and officially regular broadcasting for 4 hours 30 minutes each day starting on 2 September 1958. Peking Television was granted a free-to-air terrestrial television broadcasting license in the 1960s. It began broadcasting experimentally in colour in 1971, and later launched via satellite transmissions in 1972 for major events. The first colour programmes were PAL-D/K, and full-time colour broadcasting began in 1977. =China Central Television (1 May 1978present)= On 1 May 1978, Peking Television was renamed China Central Television (CCTV) with the approval of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. CCTV began domestic satellite transmissions in 1984 using the Song Dang Hong 2 satellite. In 1988, it began stereo broadcasting on all television channels. In 1994, it moved satellite broadcasting from Chinasat-3 to Chinasat-4, a quality-level broadcaster. It turned on its digital signal in 2002. CCTV-1 began broadcasting 24 hours a day on 1 October 2004 and began high-definition broadcasting on 28 September 2009. On 1 March 2011, Hong Kong's Asia Television (ATV) started relaying CCTV-1 instead of CCTV-4, a Hong Kong-based free-to-air digital terrestrial station that is usually tuned to 15 on the UHF band. On 29 May 2017, Hong Kong's RTHK started relaying CCTV-1 instead of CGTN Documentary, a Hong Kong-based free-to-air digital terrestrial station that is usually tuned to 33 on the high-definition television.

Akerson succeeded Edward Whitacre as CEO on September 1, 2010, and became Chairman of the Board on January 1, 2011. He was succeeded by General Motors CEO Mary Barra. Akerson was a Managing Director of The Carlyle Group and head of global buyout prior to joining General Motors. He joined the General Motors board of directors on July 24, 2009. Akerson also serves on the boards of American Express and the U.S. Naval Academy Foundation, and is now a Vice Chairman and Special Advisor to the Board of Directors for The Carlyle Group. Personal life Akerson was born in Oakland, California, grew up in Mankato, Minnesota, and currently resides in McLean, Virginia. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the United States Naval Academy (Class of 1970) and a Master of Science degree in economics from the London School of Economics. Akerson served as an officer on a Naval destroyer from 1970-1975. Akerson's maternal grandparents are German and his paternal grandparents are Swedish. Career Akerson joined MCI Inc. in 1983 where he served as the CFO for several years as well as President and Chief Operating Officer. He left MCI in 1993 to become chairman and chief executive of General Instrument, where he succeeded former United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. In 1996, Akerson was hired to be the chief executive of Nextel. During his tenure as CEO, Nextel's revenues grew from $171.7 million in the year before his arrival to more than $3.3 billion in 1998. Shortly after stepping down as CEO of Nextel in July 1999, Akerson was brought in by Craig McCaw to run Nextlink Communications, later rebranded as XO Communications. XO Communications entered bankruptcy in June 2002, and Akerson resigned as CEO in December 2002. Akerson joined The Carlyle Group in 2003. While at The Carlyle Group, Akerson ran the Company's largest private equity fund. In July 2009, Akerson was named to the board of directors of General Motors as a representative of the U.S. Treasury, which at the time owned a 61% stake in GM. On August 12, 2010 it was announced that Akerson would be the successor of Ed Whitacre as CEO of General Motors, starting September 1, 2010 and would also assume the Chairman of the Board position on January 1, 2011. General Motors, during Akerson's first year of tenure in 2011, earned a record $7.6 billion in profit off of $150.3 billion in sales. In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury sold its final remaining shares of GM common stock. In April 2013, investors began to speculate that the 64-year-old executive may be considering retirement. The speculation was based solely on changes to Akerson's compensation plan at GM. On December 10, 2013, GM announced that Akerson will be replaced as CEO of GM by Mary Barra, effective January 15, 2014. It is reported that Akerson's retirement was expedited by his wife's advanced stage cancer, however on March 1, 2014, The Carlyle Group announced that Akerson rejoined the firm as Vice Chairman and Special Advisor to the Board of Directors. As of February 2014 to current Akerson serves on the board of directors at Lockheed Martin.

It is composed of five stories: * \\"Bluestocking\\" (1967, as \\"The Adventuress\\" in Orbit 2) begins in the fantasy city of Ourdh. Alyx is hired by a young noblewoman to help the latter escape from an arranged marriage. * \\"I Thought She Was Afeard Till She Stroked My Beard\\" (1967, as \\"I Gave Her Sack and Sherry\\" in Orbit 2) describes Alyx's escape from an abusive marriage to become a pirate. * \\"The Barbarian\\" (1968 in Orbit 3) takes place again in Ourdh. Alyx, the titular barbarian, is employed by a sorcerer with little regard for human life. * \\"Picnic on Paradise\\" (1968) presents Alyx as an agent of the Trans-Temporal Authority. Having been accidentally rescued from drowning in the bay of Tyre by a \\"time-scoop\\", she is employed to guide a group of ill-prepared vacationers across the treacherous landscape of an alien world. *\\"The Second Inquisition\\" (1970 in Orbit 6) takes place in 1925. In it, a young woman befriends an odd visitor, who is eventually revealed to be a time-traveling granddaughter of Alyx. The Trans-Temporal Authority of \\"Picnic on Paradise\\" is explicitly mentioned. These stories display elements of science fiction cloaked in fantasy in a similar way to work by Mary Gentle, who has cited them as an influence. The eponymous heroine, Alyx, is (intentionally) described with different attributes across the different stories, although she remains reasonably constant inasmuch as she is depicted as a realistic human being, not the clich√©d fantasy woman prevalent across much of the genre.Clute and Nicholls 1995, p. 1035. Fictional character biography The details of Alyx's birth and early life are not described. By seventeen, she was married to an abusive man, apparently one of some social standing. After retaliating and striking the man unconscious, she joins a group of smugglers and pirates. At some point later, she is living in the hills above Ourdh. As part of an evangelical group devoted to the hill-god Yp, she comes to Ourdh. Her co-religionists are persecuted, and Alyx comes to the conclusion that the religion is ridiculous. By thirty, she is still living in Ourdh, working as a pick-lock, among other things. (She mentions that she had a daughter, but when she lost the daughter or they were estranged is not detailed.) She helps a wealthy young woman named Edarra escape from an arranged marriage to an unpleasant and possibly murderous widower. They travel some distance away from the city by sea. Some time later, Alyx is back in Ourdh, working as an assassin. She has, in the meantime, married. She enters the employ of a sorcerer. Recognizing his cruelty and malevolence, she destroys him. Later, in Tyre, Alyx steals from the prince and is put to death by drowning. By coincidence, she's picked up by a time travel device being used by archaeologists in the distant future, the Trans-Temporal Authority. As the only living thing ever recovered by time travel, and a relic of a hardier age, she is employed for her expertise in outdoor survival. Overdosing on an unidentified drug during one of these assignments leaves her with permanent hallucinations of a dead friend. Alyx grows in influence in the Trans-Temporal Authority and apparently reshapes the agency, leading to a rift between its members. Her granddaughter also becomes a time-traveler and participates in this conflict. References to other works \\"Bluestocking\\" includes a reference to Fritz Leiber's character Fafhrd. Alyx recalls \\"A big Northman with hair like yours and a gold-red beard --God, what a beard!--Fafnir, no, Fafh--well, something ridiculous. But he was far from ridiculous. He was amazing\\". She describes a volatile week-long tryst with him. Alyx makes cameo appearances in several of Leiber's Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories. In \\"The Two Best Thieves in Lankhmar\\", (1968) she is referred to as \\"Alyx the pick-lock\\", a thief active in Lankhmar despite the Thieves' Guild barring women from the trade. In \\"Under the Thumbs of the Gods\\", (1970) Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser encounter their former lovers during an otherworldly experience. Alyx and Fafhrd's affair is mentioned. In 1976, Leiber published a promotional article for the Lankhmar war game in The Dragon #1. In passing, he mentions Alyx as having \\"penetrate[d] Nehwon,\\" apparently from some other world. References in other media Through her appearances in stories about Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Alyx is mentioned briefly in TSR's Lankhmar ‚Äì City of Adventure (1992), and Mongoose's Fritz Leiber's Lankhmar (2006). Both of these are roleplaying game products. References Sources * Clute, John and Peter Nicholls. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993 (2nd edition 1995). .

In January 1990, her career took an unexpected turn when Wayland Hicks, then a senior executive, offered Burns a job as his executive assistant. She accepted and worked for him for roughly nine months before returning home because she was about to be married. In June 1991, she then became executive assistant to then chairman and chief executive Paul Allaire. In 1999, she was named vice president for global manufacturing. In May 2000, Burns was named senior vice president of corporate strategic services and began working closely with soon-to-be CEO Anne Mulcahy, in what both women have described as a true partnership. Two years later, Burns became president of business group operations. In 2007, Burns assumed the role of president of Xerox. In July 2009 she was named CEO, succeeding Mulcahy, who remained as chairman until May 2010. The first black woman CEO to head a Fortune 500 company, Burns was also the first woman to succeed another woman as head of a Fortune 500 company. Shortly after being named CEO, Burns led the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services. In 2016, she led Xerox in a split into two independent companies: Xerox Corporation and Conduent Incorporated.

History Before the erection of Worcester County in 1742, Somerset County (erected in 1666) was, like other colonial counties, divided into \\"hundreds\\", including Mattapony. Following American independence, Maryland's hundreds were converted into election districts, and Mattapony became the Sandy Hill, later the Stockton, election district. Geography Mattapony Hundred's original borders were the Pocomoke River on the west and northwest, Corker's Creek on the northeast, Chincoteague Bay on the east, and Accomack County, Virginia on the south. During the colonial period, Mattapony Hundred was divided by the creation of Pitts Creek Hundred out of its western third.1876 map of Worcester County Towns and villages in the hundred included present-day Girdletree, Rabbit Knaw, Big Mill (also known as Welbourne), Goodwill (formerly known as Davis Cross Roads), Klej Grange (named Lindseyville until 1878), Stockton (known as Sandy Hill until 1872), and Pocomoke City (known as Stevens Landing or Stevens Ferry, then as Newtown until 1888). Three main roads traversed Mattapony: the seaside post road from Delaware ran via Snow Hill through Girdletree and Stockton into Virginia (current Maryland Route 12 follows its approximate path), a road from Mattapony Landing on the Pocomoke River to Stockton via Klej Grange, and another from Snow Hill to Pocomoke City via Klej Grange and Goodwill. Name \\"Mattapony\\" was one of the most widely used place-names of the Algonquian Indians in Maryland and Virginia. As early as 1639, a \\"Mattapony Path\\" was known in St. Mary's County--it led to Mataponi Creek, a tributary of the Patuxent River. \\"Place Names of Maryland\\" states that the Algonquin meaning of \\"matta\\" was \\"joined,\\" or \\"junction,\\" and \\"apo\\" was \\"water,\\" \\"current,\\" or \\"expanse of water,\\" i.e., \\"meeting of waters at a sand spit\\". Mayre states in the Maryland Historical Magazine, in an article entitled \\"Sea Coast of Maryland\\": > In the interest of accuracy it should be admitted that this place-name may > refer to Mattapony inlet, as the heads of these inlets seem to have been > close to one another. Not restricted to Worcester County, at least two properties on the neighboring Eastern Shore of Virginia were also called \\"Mattapony\\".Whitelaw, Ralph T., Virginia's Eastern Shore (1968), p. 1361. Likewise, the Mattaponi River in Virginia, called after the tribe of the same name, joins with the Pamunkey to form the York River, and, as noted above, Mataponi Creek flows into the Patuxent River in Prince George's County, Maryland.

Tarzan of the Apes, referring to the character we will come to know as Tarzan: \\"Somehow, even against all reason, I seem to see him a grown man, taking his father's place in the world‚Äîthe second John Clayton‚Äîand bringing added honors to the house of Greystoke.\\" , the son of Tarzan and Jane Porter. History Jack first appeared in the original Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs. He was introduced as an infant in the non-Tarzan novel The Eternal Lover (later retitled The Eternal Savage), in which the Ape Man and his family played supporting roles. His next appearance (still as an infant) was in The Beasts of Tarzan, the third Tarzan novel, in which he was kidnapped and taken to Africa. The story of his youth and growth to manhood was told in the fourth novel, The Son of Tarzan, in which he returned to Africa and lived in the jungle, taking for the first time the name Korak (\\"Killer\\" in the language of the Great Apes). Most references to him were as \\"Korak the Killer\\". Half of the book relates to Meriem, the Arab girl he rescues from a beating. The two of them run wild in the forest for years before being separated. After many adventures they are re-united and eventually marry. Korak was later used as a supporting character in the eighth through the tenth entries in the series, Tarzan the Terrible, Tarzan and the Golden Lion, and Tarzan and the Ant Men. The last of those three also briefly mentions Korak and Meriem's young son \\"Jackie\\". The Bunduki series by J. T. Edson - and authorized by the Burroughs estate - includes Korak and Meriem's granddaughter Dawn as one of two main characters. In other media Besides the Burroughs novels, Korak also appeared in the 1920 movie serial The Son of Tarzan, the Tarzan comic strip, in which he was a major character for many years; and the Tarzan, Korak, Son of Tarzan, and Tarzan Family comic books. In the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, Korak was replaced by an adopted son called Boy (played by Johnny Sheffield). Tarzan and Jane never married in these films (they do in the books), and the substitution was made to avoid censorship. In the Dell comic books of the 1950s, which combine material from the books and the films, Tarzan's son was also called Boy. When the Tarzan comics returned to a more faithful portrayal of Burroughs' characters in the early 1960s, Boy disappeared and Tarzan's son was called Korak, who was later featured in his own comic book. =Portrayal in film= * Gordon Griffith (youth) 1920 * Kamuela C.

It forms part of the southeastern border of the Antrim Plateau. It is distinguished by its 'Napoleon's Nose',BBC News website a basaltic outcrop which resembles the profile of the emperor Napoleon. Cave Hill spelt as Cavehill is also the name of an electoral ward in Belfast. Previously it was known as Collinward Mountain, and more historically as Ben Madigan, which is derived from the Irish Beann Mhadag√°in, meaning \\"Madag√°n‚Äôs peak\\"‚Äîso named after a king of Ulster called Madag√°n who died in 856AD. All of Belfast can be seen from its peak, as can the Isle of Man and Scotland on clear days. Like Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, it lies just a few miles from the centre of a major city. It approximately takes up to 1 hour to fully get to ‚ÄòNapoleon‚Äôs nose‚Äô. Cave Hill is thought to be the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Swift imagined that the Cave Hill resembled the shape of a sleeping giant safeguarding the city. Overview Cave Hill rises to above sea level. Most of its lower east side lies on the Belfast Castle estate, which has as its focal point the imposing 19th-century Scottish baronial castle. The castle was designed by Charles Lanyon and constructed by The 3rd Marquess of Donegall in 1872 in the Deer Park. The slopes of Cave Hill were originally used as farmland but, from the 1880s, a major planting exercise was undertaken, producing the now familiar deciduous and coniferous woodland landscape. Belfast Castle estate was given to the City of Belfast by The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury in 1934. McArt's fort with Belfast in the background =The caves= There are three large caves. The lowest is long, wide and varies from 7 to in height. Above this is another cave; long, wide and in height. Above this is the third major cave, said to be divided into 2 unequal parts, each of which is more extensive than the larger of the other caves, but the ascent is notoriously dangerous and thus few venture to it. The caves are man-made, and it is postulated that they were originally excavated for iron-mining. Adjacent to the lowest cave is 'The Devil's Punchbowl', also sometimes called 'The Devil's Cauldron', a site where ancient Celtic farmers corralled their cattle. This consists mainly of a steep hill, mainly of rocks and boulders, and is considered dangerous to amateurs. =McArt's Fort= This fort, on the top of the cliff, is an example of an old r√°th or ring fort. It is protected on one side by a precipice and on the others by a single ditch, in depth and in width; a vallum of large dimensions. The enclosed area is nearly level. The flat top of the fort is from north to south, and from east to west. It is believed that the fort's inhabitants used the caves to store white foods for the winter and may have served as a refuge during times of attack. History McArts fort overlooking Belfast Eastern prospect looking towards Carrickfergus and Scotland Overlooking Belfast Lough Cave Hill from north Belfast The hill was known in the original Gaelic as Beann Mhadag√°in (meaning \\"Madigan's hill\\"), after one of two Kings of Ulaid: Matud√°n mac Muiredaig, who ruled from 839 to 857 A.D., or a later king, Matud√°n mac √Åeda (reigned 937‚Äì950 A.D.). The later king's grandson, Eochaid mac Ardgail, was killed at the battle of Crew Hill in 1004, in which the Men of Ulster were defeated by their old enemies, the Cen√©l nE√≥gain. It is from him that McArt's Fort derived its name. The residential neighbourhood at the foot of Cave Hill's entrance is derivatively known as Ben Madigan, with street names to match, and is a wealthy semi-outer city, semi-suburban area. The name 'Ben Madigan' can also be found attached to buildings, schools etc. close to the area, e.g. the Belfast Royal Academy has the Ben Madigan Preparatory School on the Antrim Road. United Irishmen Theobald Wolfe Tone and Henry Joy McCracken allegedly met at Cave Hill in 1795 to take an oath to launch the rebellion of 1798. McCracken was captured on Cave Hill in 1798. The crowning stone Giant's Chair of the O'Neill clan was apparently sited on Cave Hill summit until 1896 and gave its name to the nearby Throne Hospital. During World War II, a bomb dropped prematurely during a German bombing raid on Belfast exploded, causing a large crater near the grounds of Belfast Castle. It is understood that RAF Bomber Command was situated on Cave Hill in the early years of World War II before relocating to Castle Archdale in County Fermanagh. Hence the German bomb may have been intentional. On 1 June 1944, an American Air Force B-17 bomber crashed into Cave Hill during heavy fog, killing all ten crew instantly. The incident inspired Richard Attenborough's film, Closing the Ring. Some scenes of the film were shot on Cave Hill. The site of the crash is easily accessed via Carr's Glen Country Park where the field, known locally as 'The Bomb hole Field' remains entirely open to public. Geology The hill owes its characteristic shape to Paleocene basalt lava flows, from 65 million years ago. This is underlain by Cretaceous‚Äî145 million years‚ÄîUlster White Limestone and below this is Jurassic‚Äî200 million years‚ÄîWaterloo Mudstone Formation, more commonly known as Lias clay. Limestone was mined on the southern flanks of Cave Hill in Victorian times and transported to Belfast docks by way of a horse-worked railway along the Limestone Road. The railroad was abandoned in the 1890s. Two small hamlets‚ÄîDaddystown and Mammystown‚Äîwere built on either side of the railway track in the early 1820s as dwellings for quarry workers. Some of the local avenues and streets bear the name 'Waterloo', in reference to their geological origins. Tourism and recreation Cave Hill Country Park, Belfast Zoo and Belfast Castle are magnets for locals and tourists alike. In the 18th century the townfolk of Belfast flocked there on Easter Monday for the Cave Hill fete, near a spring known as the 'Volunteers' Well'. The summits offers stunning views southwards over Belfast City and Lough towards the Mourne Mountains, Scrabo Tower and Slieve Croob. On a clear day, the eastern prospect reveals views of Carrickfergus, the Mull of Galloway in Scotland and the Isle of Man.

Lewis Jones (30 January 1837 - 24 November 1904) was one of the founders of the Welsh settlement in Patagonia. The city of Trelew was named after him. Jones was born in Caernarfon and worked as a printer in Holyhead, where he was co-editor of the Welsh periodical Y Punch Cymraeg. Later he moved to Liverpool and married Ellen Griffith in 1859. He became one of the main leaders of the movement which was set up to establish a Welsh settlement in a suitable location, where Welsh emigrants could stay together and preserve their language and way of life. In 1862 Lewis Jones accompanied Captain Love Jones- Parry to Patagonia to investigate whether it was a suitable area for the project. They first visited Buenos Aires where they held discussions with the minister Guillermo Rawson then having come to an agreement headed south. They reached Patagonia in a small ship named the Candelaria, and were driven by a storm into a bay which they named \\"Porth Madryn\\" after Jones-Parry's estate in Wales. The town which grew near the spot where they landed is now named Puerto Madryn. They returned to Wales with a favourable report, which was further embellished by Lewis Jones in a series of speeches. Lewis Jones and Edwyn Cynrig Roberts went to Patagonia ahead of the main party to prepare the ground, and were there to welcome the settlers when the Mimosa landed. However a quarrel broke out when some of the settlers complained that the land was by no means as suitable for settlement as Lewis Jones had claimed. Jones moved to Buenos Aires to work as a printer for a period, but when he heard in 1867 that some of the settlers were planning to leave Patagonia he returned to persuade them to stay. He set up a printing press and published two Welsh newspapers, Ein Breiniad and Y Drafod. The Argentine government appointed him governor for a period, but he was also imprisoned for supporting the rights of the Welsh settlers against the government. In the 1870s he made a number of trips to explore the area beyond the Chubut valley. Lewis Jones was the driving force behind the construction of a railway running up the Chubut valley from Puerto Madryn. In 1884 the Argentine Congress authorised the construction of the Central Chubut Railway by Lewis Jones y Cia. Raising funds locally to set up a company to build the railway proved difficult, so Lewis Jones went to the United Kingdom with his daughter Eluned to try to raise the money there. Initially he had little success, but on a train journey from London to Bangor the fact that he and Eluned were chatting in Spanish aroused the curiosity of a fellow passenger, Asahel P. Bell, an engineer. It was Bell who assisted them to set up the company in Liverpool. Work on the railway began in 1886, helped by the arrival of another 465 Welsh settlers on the steamer Vesta. The town which grew at the railhead was named Trelew in honour of Lewis Jones (\\"Tre\\" is the Welsh for \\"town\\"). The town grew rapidly and in 1888 became the headquarters of the \\"Compa√±√≠a Mercantil del Chubut\\" (Chubut Trading Company). Lewis Jones died in 1904, the year in which Trelew elected its first municipal authority, and was buried in the Moriah cemetery by the River Chubut, facing Trelew. His daughter Eluned, later Eluned Morgan, became a prominent figure in the life of the Welsh settlement, and is generally regarded as the finest Welsh language writer produced by Patagonia.

Also called a 'paint bell', \\"rotary bell atomizer\\" or 'bell applicator', it is preferred for high volume paint application for its superior transfer efficiency, spray pattern consistency, and low compressed air consumption, when compared to a paint spray gun.  Transfer Efficiency  Rotary atomizers can provide highest transfer efficiency of any paint applicator at approximately 95%. They are automatic electrostatic applicators. This means that the applicator puts an electric charge on each droplet of paint to attract it to the part being sprayed. Rotary atomizers are able to get higher transfer efficiency compared to other spray guns because it able to split the paint up into smaller finer droplets. It is able to achieve high atomization because of the bell cup that spins at 20,000 to 60,000 revolutions per minute. Assemblies The typical bell applicator consists of five major assemblies: the valve module, the bell cup, the turbine, the shaping air shroud, and the electrostatic system. The valve module is a manifold consisting of passages for paint, solvent, and compressed air, and valves to control the flow of materials for paint delivery, cleaning and purging with solvent, and management of compressed air to the valves, turbine, and shaping air shroud. The bell cup is a conical or curved disc fixed to the shaft of the turbine. Paint is injected into the center of the rear of the disc, and is atomized by being forced out to the edge of the cup by centrifugal forces. The flow of the paint over the cup and off the edge breaks up the paint into atomized droplets. The turbine is a high speed, high precision air motor that rotates the bell cup at speeds ranging from 10,000rpm to 70,000rpm, depending on the cup diameter, atomization desired, and physical properties of the paint. Typical turbines for this application use an air bearing, where the spinning shaft is suspended in a cushion of flowing compressed air, with virtually no frictional resistance. The shaping air shroud, or shaping air ring, is simply a ring with passages for air to flow out the front of the atomizer, outside of the cup diameter, to manage the size of the spray pattern produced. As more air is forced through the shroud, the atomized paint is forced into a smaller pattern. The electrostatic system can be internal or external (or direct or indirect charge), and supplies high voltage (30,000 to 100,000 volts DC) charge to the applicator, or the air surrounding it. This has the effect of negatively charging the paint, while causing a region of positive charge to form on the workpiece, resulting in electrostatic attraction between the paint and the workpiece. The electrostatic system is visible only on an external (or indirect) charge applicator, where it appears as a series of 4-8 forward-facing electrodes in a circular array around the bell. It is typically called a 'candelabra' for its resemblance to one. The bell is also used in powder coating. Although the bell looks different from a topcoat bell.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 7, 1996. In the episode, Homer starts a bowling team with Moe, Apu, and Otto. When Mr. Burns discovers the team was funded with his money, he insists on joining, but the team fears he will cost them the league championship. In the subplot, Bart's \\"Down with homework\\" T-shirt incites a school riot, so Principal Skinner implements a uniform dress code. The episode was written by Mike Scully and directed by Mark Kirkland. Scully came up with the idea for it when he went bowling one day. The episode features cultural references to Mad magazine and the film Caddyshack. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.4, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. Plot Homer and his teammates -- Moe, Apu and Otto -- are unable to afford the $500 fee to join a bowling league. Homer asks his boss to sponsor the team while he is anesthetized, so Mr. Burns unwittingly signs a check. The newly named Pin Pals enter a bowling competition. They beat three teams and move to second place in their league. After recovering from his ether-induced stupor, Burns discovers he wrote a check to Homer and insists on joining the Pin Pals, replacing Otto. Homer and the team fear they will lose the championship since Burns is an awful bowler due to his frail physique. Burns gives the Pin Pals new bowling shirts before the championship game. Two pins away from victory, Burns takes his turn on the lane. When Otto tips over a claw arcade machine by accident, the vibrations knock down the pins and the Pin Pals win. As the team celebrates, Burns takes the trophy and keeps it for himself. Encouraged by his teammates, Homer attempts to break into Burns' mansion to recover the trophy; this ends disastrously when Burns releases the hounds and Homer is severely mauled. At school, Bart's Mad iron-on \\"Down with homework\\" T-shirt incites a student riot, so Principal Skinner forces students to wear uniforms. Skinner explained to Bart that those t-shirts resulted in his capture by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War where, in his prisoner-of- war camp he was forced to subsist on a fish and vegetable stew and that he came close to madness trying to find its recipe at home. The new dress code demoralizes the students until a rainstorm soaks through the uniforms, causing the grey color to melt and reveal tie-dye colors that make the children resume rebelling against authority. Production alt=A man with sunglasses smiles as he signs autographs. The episode was written by Mike Scully. He was bowling \\"a lot\\" at the time, and one day when he was bowling, he came up with the idea for \\"Team Homer\\". The idea for the school plot came later in production when the school that Scully's children went to was thinking of introducing school uniforms. Both Scully and his children were against it so he decided to put it in the episode. Former show runner of The Simpsons David Mirkin thought the episode was \\"really fun\\" because there were \\"lots of characters\\" in it and it featured \\"lots of terrific animation\\". Mirkin liked that viewers could see the different characters \\"team up\\" and how they pair off. \\"It's kind of cool to see them hang around like this. Particularly Homer's group which has some nice emotion and they really comes together as a group\\", Mirkin commented. The episode was directed by Mark Kirkland. When he first read the script, he thought the challenge of this episode was that the bowling theme had already been covered in the season one episode \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\". Since it had been done before, Kirkland felt pressure to make the bowling alley look \\"really good\\". Kirkland and his team of The Simpsons animators at Film Roman all went over to a local bowling alley and had lunch. They inspected the whole alley for inspiration and drew sketches. \\"Life on the Fast Lane\\" deals with Marge becoming infatuated with Jacques, a French bowling instructor. Mirkin points out that Jacques makes a brief appearance in this episode, but without a speaking role. Also appearing with non-speaking roles are Mindy Simmons, Lurleen Lumpkin, and Princess Kashmir, the three women who almost broke up Marge and Homer's marriage. Mirkin remembered the episode \\"very fondly\\" because when it was finished, the staff received customized The Simpsons bowling balls, bowling bags, and Pin Pal shirts as gifts. Scully said the bowling balls were \\"really cool\\" because they were yellow and had The Simpsons logo on them. Doris Grau, script supervisor for the show and voice of Lunchlady Doris, died on December 30, 1995, from respiratory failure at a hospital in Los Angeles, California. \\"Team Homer\\" was one of the last episodes to feature her voice, and included a dedication to her. In one scene, Homer tells Marge: \\"We were so close to winning the championship. Now, thanks to Burns, it's never going to happen. And I spent so much time building that trophy case.\\" The scene then cuts to the trophy case with an Academy Award in it that Homer has stolen. In the original Fox broadcast, the name in the inscription on the Academy Award was Haing S. Ngor. In American syndication and the season seven DVD, the name was changed to Don Ameche (who had won for Cocoon). Ngor, who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for the 1984 film The Killing Fields, was murdered on February 25, 1996, between the original and the syndicated broadcast. Producers were concerned the syndicated episode would imply Homer had murdered Ngor to steal the statue. Cultural references Bart and Milhouse buy an issue of Mad magazine. Bart also puts a Mad iron-on reading \\"Down with Homework\\" on one of his T-shirts, which causes controversy at school. Milhouse is shocked to see the new school uniforms, and his jaw drops, a \\"Woody Allen-esque\\" type of joke. The final bowling scene is similar to the final golfing scene in the 1980 film Caddyshack. Homer references the song \\"Mr. Roboto\\" by Styx. Moe's unsuccessful attempt to sideline Mr. Burns by hitting his leg with a crowbar is done in a similar manner to Shane Stant's attempt in 1994 to sideline figure skater Nancy Kerrigan by physical assault. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Team Homer\\" finished 58th in the ratings for the week of January 1‚Äì7, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 9.4. Retrieved on January 4, 2009. The episode was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files, Beverly Hills, 90210, and Married... with Children. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was named the fifth best episode of the show by MSNBC. They praised how the episode utilized Burns's physical weaknesses for laughs, and Homer's line; \\"I guess some people never change. Or, they quickly change and then quickly change back.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that to his surprise, \\"the dress code plot works the best\\". He liked the mockery of Mad magazine and the \\"overemphasis on the way it disrupts the educational process\\". Jacobson thought the bowling plot had plenty of \\"nice moments\\" too, and \\"these add up to a solid show\\". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered the best part of the episode to be when Homer ends a phone conversation with the \\"highly quotable\\" line, \\"I gotta go. My damn wiener kids are listening.\\" Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of A‚àí. Mirkin described the episode as \\"excellent\\", and praised Scully's \\"great\\" script. The episode received criticism from the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, who said that \\"Team Homer\\" is one of their least favorite episodes. They thought the school uniform plot was \\"a lot more satisfying than the bowling story\\". They added that the scene where Martin and Lisa model the new uniforms is the highlight of the episode.

Carroll's books are highly regarded among amateur race drivers and engineers. He was representative of the club racing spirit: learning a craft and bringing together several disciplines in order to participate in a dangerous and often misunderstood sport. Biography Born and raised in the northeast United States, Carroll Smith began racing MGs while attending the University of Rochester. Entering SCCA events in Pensacola, Florida at the time, he was enlisted in the US Navy. Carroll moved to Europe where he befriended John Cooper. Driving a Formula Junior Cooper, he won his first race. After waning success in the Cooper cars, followed by a characteristically clear-eyed personal assessment that he lacked the ability to drive race cars at the highest levels, he returned to the United States and began working with Carroll Shelby and the Ford Motor Company on the GT40 Le Mans program. Smith oversaw the preparation on the cars that won the 1966 and 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. After winning Le Mans with the GT40 cars from 1966 to 1969 (inclusive), FIA rules changes caused Ford to cancel the GT40 program. Smith moved to work with American Under-2.5 Liter Trans-Am champion Tony Adamowicz to work on his F5000 car in 1969. Smith led the team to the championship that year. In his many writings, Adamowicz credits Smith with successfully focusing his driving and tuning efforts. After that victory, he began working on Prepare to Win. Smith later consulted for the Ferrari Formula One team and in 1977 he was team manager for the Moffat Ford Dealer Team in Australia; the team winning both the Australian Touring Car Championship and the Bathurst 1000 endurance race. In later life Smith exercised his interest in racing by running vintage cars. Carroll was an active and avid Society of Automotive Engineers member. Smith succumbed to pancreatic cancer in 2003 at his home in Northern California, leaving his daughter Dana, his son Christopher, and his fianc√©e Ginger. Carroll's former wife, Jane, died on October 15, 1994 after a fall from a balcony in their home while she was gardening. Carroll himself notes: \\"She went doing what she liked best, enjoying the ocean view and gardening...secure in the love of her family and friends and in the respect of her co-workers and students.\\" Smith's books were well received by drivers and mechanics alike because of their affable, direct, and clear writing style. After writing a series of books about different aspects of racing car preparation, tuning and engineering practice, each with ... to Win in the title, he wrote the Nuts, Bolts, Fasteners, and Plumbing Handbook about the fasteners and plumbing parts often used in cars. When Smith announced the forthcoming book, he proclaimed his intent to title it Screw to Win, which (he claimed) the publisher then disallowed. His readers and fans, naturally, refer to the book by just that title.

They are procedures derived from the original maze procedure developed by James Cox, MD. The origin of the mini-maze procedures: The Cox maze procedure James Cox, MD, and associates developed the \\"maze\\" or \\"Cox maze\\" procedure, an \\"open-heart\\" cardiac surgery procedure intended to eliminate atrial fibrillation, and performed the first one in 1987. ‚ÄúMaze‚Äù refers to the series of incisions arranged in a maze-like pattern in the atria. The intention was to eliminate AF by using incisional scars to block abnormal electrical circuits (atrial macroreentry) that AF requires. This required an extensive series of endocardial (from the inside of the heart) incisions through both atria, a median sternotomy (vertical incision through the breastbone) and cardiopulmonary bypass (heart-lung machine; extracorporeal circulation). A series of improvements were made, culminating in 1992 in the Cox maze III procedure, which is now considered to be the \\"gold standard‚Äù for effective surgical cure of AF. It was quite successful in eliminating AF, but had drawbacks as well. The Cox maze III is sometimes referred to as the ‚ÄúTraditional maze‚Äù, the ‚Äúcut and sew maze‚Äù, or simply the \\"maze\\". Minimally invasive epicardial surgical procedures for AF (minimaze) Efforts have since been made to equal the success of the Cox maze III while reducing surgical complexity and likelihood of complications. During the late 1990s, operations similar to the Cox maze, but with fewer atrial incisions, led to the use of the terms \\"minimaze\\", \\"mini maze\\" and ‚Äúmini-maze‚Äù, although these were still major operations. A primary goal has been to perform a curative, \\"maze-like\\" procedure epicardially (from the outside of the heart), so that it could be performed on a normally beating heart, without cardiopulmonary bypass. Until recently this was not thought possible; as recently as 2004, Dr. Cox defined the mini-maze as requiring an endocardial approach: > ‚ÄúIn summary, it would appear that placing the following lesions can cure > most patients with atrial fibrillation of either type: pulmonary vein > encircling incision, left atrial isthmus lesion with its attendant coronary > sinus lesion, and the right atrial isthmus lesion. We call this pattern of > atrial lesions the ‚Äúmini-maze Procedure‚Äù ... None of the present energy > sources‚Äîincluding cryotherapy, unipolar radiofrequency, irrigated > radiofrequency, bipolar radiofrequency, microwave, and laser energy‚Äîare > capable of creating the left atrial isthmus lesion from the epicardial > surface, because of the necessity of penetrating through the circumflex > coronary artery to reach the left atrial wall near the posterior mitral > annulus. Therefore, the mini-maze procedure cannot be performed epicardially > by means of any presently available energy source.‚Äù Although Dr. Cox's 2004 definition specifically excludes an epicardial approach to eliminate AF, he and others pursued this important goal, and the meaning of the term changed as successful epicardial procedures were developed. In 2002 Saltman performed a completely endoscopic surgical ablation of AF and subsequently published their results in 14 patients. These were performed epicardially, on the beating heart, without cardiopulmonary bypass or median sternotomy. Their method came to be known as the minimaze or microwave minimaze procedure, because microwave energy was used to make the lesions that had previously been performed by the surgeon's scalpel. Shortly thereafter, Randall K. Wolf, MD and others developed a procedure using radiofrequency energy rather than microwave, and different, slightly larger incisions. In 2005, he published his results in the first 27 patients. This came to be known as the Wolf minimaze procedure. Today, the terms ‚Äúminimaze‚Äù, \\"mini-maze\\", and \\"mini maze\\" are still sometimes used to describe open heart procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and median sternotomy, but more commonly they refer to minimally invasive, epicardial procedures not requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, such as those developed by Saltman, Wolf, and others. These procedures are characterized by: #No median sternotomy incision; instead, an endoscope and/or ‚Äúmini-thoracotomy‚Äù incisions between the ribs are used. #No cardiopulmonary bypass; instead, these procedures are performed on the normally beating heart. #Few or no actual incisions into the heart itself. The \\"maze\\" lesions are made epicardially by using radiofrequency, microwave, or ultrasonic energy, or by cryosurgery. #The part of the left atrium in which most clots form (the ‚Äúappendage‚Äù) is usually removed, in an effort to reduce the long-term likelihood of stroke. =Microwave minimaze= Completely Endoscopic Microwave Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation on the Beating Heart Using Bilateral Thoracoscopy: The microwave minimaze requires three 5 mm to 1 cm incisions on each side of the chest for the surgical tools and the endoscope. The pericardium is entered, and two sterile rubber tubes are threaded behind the heart, in the transverse and oblique sinuses. These tubes are joined together, then used to guide the flexible microwave antenna energy source through the sinuses behind the heart, to position it for ablation. Energy is delivered and the atrial tissue heated and destroyed in a series of steps as the microwave antenna is withdrawn behind the heart. The lesions form a \\"box-like\\" pattern around all four pulmonary veins behind the heart. The left atrial appendage is usually removed. A very thorough description of the procedure is available. =Wolf minimaze= Video-assisted Bilateral Epicardial Bipolar Radiofrequency Pulmonary Vein Isolation and Left Atrial Appendage Excision: The Wolf minimaze requires one 5 cm and two 1 cm incisions on each side of the chest. These incisions allow the surgeon to maneuver the tools, view areas through an endoscope, and to see the heart directly. The right side of the left atrium is exposed first. A clamp-like tool is positioned on the left atrium near the right pulmonary veins, and the atrial tissue is heated between the jaws of the clamp, cauterizing the area. The clamp is removed. The autonomic nerves (ganglionated plexi) that may cause AF may be eliminated as well. Subsequently the left side of the chest is entered. The ligament of Marshall (a vestigial structure with marked autonomic activity) is removed. The clamp is subsequently positioned on the left atrium near the left pulmonary veins for ablation. Direct testing to demonstrate complete electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins, and that the ganglionated plexi are no longer active, may be performed. =High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) minimaze= Surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation with off-pump, epicardial, high-intensity focused ultrasound: Although the HIFU minimaze is performed epicardially, on the normally beating heart, it is also usually performed in conjunction with other cardiac surgery, and so would not be minimally invasive in those cases. An ultrasonic device is positioned epicardially, on the left atrium, around the pulmonary veins, and intense acoustic energy is directed at the atrium to destroy tissue in the appropriate regions near the pulmonary veins. Mechanism of Elimination of Atrial Fibrillation The mechanism by which AF is eliminated by curative procedures such as the maze, minimaze, or catheter ablation is controversial. All successful methods destroy tissue in the areas of the left atrium near the junction of the pulmonary veins, hence these regions are thought to be important. A concept gaining support is that paroxysmal AF is mediated in part by the autonomic nervous system and that the intrinsic cardiac nervous system, which is located in these regions, plays an important role. Supporting this is the finding that targeting these autonomic sites improves the likelihood of successful elimination of AF by catheter ablation. Patient Selection The minimaze procedures are alternatives to catheter ablation of AF, and the patient selection criteria are similar. Patients are considered for minimaze procedures if they have moderate or severe symptoms and have failed medical therapy; asymptomatic patients are generally not considered. Those most likely to have a good outcome have paroxysmal (intermittent) AF, and have a heart that is relatively normal. Those with severely enlarged atria, marked cardiomyopathy, or severely leaking heart valves are less likely to have a successful result; these procedures are generally not recommended for such patients. Previous cardiac surgery provides technical challenges due to scarring on the outside of the heart, but does not always preclude minimaze surgery. Surgical Results Long-term success of the minimaze procedures awaits a consensus. Attaining a consensus is hindered by several problems; perhaps the most important of these is incomplete or inconsistent post-procedure follow-up to determine if atrial fibrillation has recurred, although many reasons have been considered. It has been clearly demonstrated that longer or more intensive follow-up identifies much more recurrent atrial fibrillation, hence a procedure with more careful follow-up will appear to be less successful. In addition, procedures continue to evolve rapidly, so long follow-up data do not accurately reflect current procedural methods. For more recent minimaze procedures, only relatively small and preliminary reports are available. With those caveats in mind, it can be said that reported short-term freedom from atrial fibrillation following the radiofrequency (\\"Wolf\\") procedure ranges from 67% to 91% with longer-term results in a similar range, but limited primarily to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

In 2015, the documentary Rise of the Centaur covered the early history of the company. History Centaur Technologies Inc. was founded in April 1995 by Glenn Henry, Terry Parks, Darius Gaskins, and Al Sato. The funding came from Integrated Device Technology, Inc (IDT). The business goal was to develop compatible x86 processors that were much less expensive than Intel processors and consumed much less power. There were two fundamental elements of the plan. First, a unique design, developed from scratch, of an x86 processor core optimized differently from Intel's cores. Second, a unique management approach designed to achieve high productivity. While funded by IDT, three different Centaur designs were shipped under the marketing name of WinChip. In September 1999, Centaur was purchased from IDT by VIA Technologies, a Taiwanese company. Since then, five designs have shipped with the marketing name of VIA C3, as well as quite a number of designs for the VIA C7 processor and their latest 64-bit CPU, the VIA Nano. The VIA Nano design has been further refined and improved in chips produced by Zhaoxin (a VIA joint venture company). In late 2019 Centaur announced the \\"World‚Äôs First High-Performance x86 SoC with Integrated AI Coprocessor\\", the CNS core.  Design methodology  Centaur's chips historically have been much smaller than comparable x86 designs at their time, and they are thus cheaper to manufacture and consume less power . This made them attractive in the embedded marketplace. Centaur's design philosophy was always centered on \\"sufficient\\" performance for tasks that its target market demands. Some of the design trade offs made by the design team run contrary to accepted wisdom. Centaur/VIA was among the first to design processors with hardware encryption acceleration in the form of VIA PadLock, starting with an 2004 VIA C7 release. Intel and AMD followed up with AES-NI in 2008, Intel SHA extensions in 2013, and RDRAND in 2015. = VIA C3 = * Because memory performance is the limiting factor in many benchmarks, VIA processors implement large primary caches, large TLBs, and aggressive prefetching, among other enhancements. While these features are not unique to VIA, memory access optimization is one area where features were not sacrificed to save die space. In fact, generous primary caches (128KB) have always been a distinctive hallmark of Centaur designs. * Generally, clock frequency is favored over increasing instructions per cycle. Complex features such as out- of-order instruction execution are deliberately not implemented, because they impact the ability to increase the clock rate, require a lot of extra die space and power, and have little impact on performance in several common application scenarios. * The pipeline is arranged to provide one-clock execution of the heavily used register‚Äìmemory and memory‚Äìregister forms of x86 instructions. Several frequently used instructions require fewer clock cycles than on other x86 processors. * Rarely used x86 instructions are implemented in microcode and emulated as combinations of other x86 instructions. This saves die space and contributes to low power consumption. The impact upon the majority of real world application scenarios is minimal. * These design principles are derivative from the original RISC advocates, who claim that a smaller set of instructions, better optimized, can deliver faster overall CPU performance. The C3 design cannot be considered a pure RISC design because it accepts the x86 instruction set which is a CISC design. * In addition to x86, these processors support the undocumented Alternate Instruction Set. = VIA C7 = * VIA C7 Esther (C5J) as an evolutionary step after VIA C3 Nehemiah+ (C5P), in which Centaur followed their traditional approach of balancing performance against a constrained transistor / power budget. * The cornerstone of the VIA C3 series chips' design philosophy has been that even a relatively simple in-order scalar core can offer reasonable performance against a complex superscalar out-of-order core if supported by an efficient \\"front-end\\", i.e. prefetch, cache and branch prediction mechanisms. * In the case of VIA C7, the design team have focused on further streamlining the \\"front-end\\" of the chip, i.e. cache size, associativity and throughput as well as the prefetch system. At the same time, no significant changes to the execution core (\\"back-end\\") of the chip seem to have been made. * The VIA C7 successfully further closes the gap in performance with AMD / Intel chips, since clock speed is not thermally constrained. = VIA Nano = * VIA Nano Isaiah (CN) is a combination of a number of firsts from Centaur, including their first superscalar out-of-order CPU and their first 64-bit CPU. * The development of the VIA Nano focused on radically improving the performance side of the performance-per-watt equation while still maintaining a similar TDP to the VIA C7. =CNS core= Centaur announced a new x86-64 \\"CNS\\" CPU with AVX-512 support and integrated AI coprocessor in late 2019. = Comparative die size = { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - !

(11 February 1851 ‚Äì 1 August 1914) was an American biologist, geologist, educator and institute director. Life and work He was born in Walpole, New Hampshire, the son of William Hooper and Elvira Pulsifer Hopper, and grew up on his parents' farm. After local schooling he studied at Antioch College, Yellow Springs, Ohio, from 1867-1871, and in 1872 enrolled at Harvard University to study biological sciences, where Louis Agassiz and Asa Gray were among his professors. He participated in the first biological summer school at the short-lived Anderson School of Natural History, founded by Agassiz in 1873 on Penikese Island, Cape Cod. After graduating with a B.A. in 1875 (Hon. M.A. 1897) he worked for the Smithsonian Institution to study algae and coralline formations in the Florida Keys. After three years as head of the high school in Keene, New Hampshire, from 1877-1880, he was appointed professor of chemistry and geology at Adelphi College, Brooklyn, where he taught until 1889. He was the first president of the Brooklyn Ethical Association 1881-1883. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, set up after a suggestion by Hooper In 1889 he was appointed as General Director of the revitalised Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences (BIAS), where he had been a Fellow, and (continuing the earlier example set by Agassiz) was instrumental in the founding of its summer school Biological Laboratory (Bio Lab) at Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, in 1890. Hooper was the first director of the Brooklyn Museum 1899-1914. Hooper greatly expanded the institute's work of presenting a wide range of public lectures and concerts, quadrupling its membership. One of the regular visiting orchestras to play at the institute was the Boston Symphony, whose founder married Agassiz' daughter. Under his leadership the institute's art and architecture departments were set up, leading to the competition to design the Brooklyn Institute's new museum (now the Brooklyn Museum), opened in 1897. Until his death in 1914 he continued as director of the institute and de facto director of the museum, and chairman of the Committee on Lectures. More departments were opened during his time as director, including the Brooklyn Children's Museum (1899) and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden (1911).In 1921 Hooper's collection of over 100 boxes of lantern slides was distributed to the Museum, the Children's Museum, and the Botanic Garden. Brooklyn Museum archives He was a member of the New York City Board of Education and a trustee for the Brooklyn Public Library. He was president of the board of trustees of his alma mater, Antioch College, from 1901-05. In 1904 Hooper was one of the founders of the American Bison Society with Ernest Harold Baynes.Where the Buffalo roamed... The story of Baynes' preservation of bison. At his suggestion Baynes wrote to President Theodore Roosevelt, who became the society's first Honorary President. Hooper also suggested the inclusion of the Premier of Canada, Earl Grey, as an officer of the society.Other managers included Commander Robert Peary and Dr. Charles B. Davenport. Davenport had been the director of the summer school of the Long Island BIAS Bio Lab which Hooper had helped set up in 1890, and was director of the Biological Station of the Carnegie Institution, situated next door. Hooper himself became the society's president in 1911. Along with Hal B. Fullerton he was the main impetus behind the establishment in 1912 of the New York State School of Agriculture on Long Island. Rockingham Meeting House, Vermont, church of his forefathers He was instrumental in setting up the Old Rockingham Meeting House Association in 1911, for the continued preservation of the newly restored Vermont church which his great-great grandfather David Pulsipher had helped to found in 1778. Hooper's obituary in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle summed up his work: \\"No man ever did so much to dignify the position of the old City of Brooklyn, in the world of science and art, as Professor Franklin William Hooper ... For a quarter of a century his energetic activities have been given to the development of this institution which has become the pride of the city and a model for work in many other cities.\\" His bust by Edmond Thomas Quinn is at the Brooklyn Museum. Family life He married Martha Holden of Augusta, Georgia, in 1877. She was the daughter of Peter B. Holden (superintendent of Augusta cotton factories) and Meritable Emery Holden, ardent abolitionists before and during the Civil War, whose house was part of the Underground Railroad for escaped slaves. Martha Hooper was vice-president of the Brooklyn Institute's Domestic Science department in 1909. They had three children: Rebecca L. Hooper, born in Walpole, March 23, 1877, married William H.

Life and career Caricature by Rudolf Swoboda (c. 1900) Joseph Urban set design drawing for Ziegfeld Follies of 1919 Joseph Urban was born on May 26, 1872, in Vienna. He received his first architectural commission at age 19 when he was selected to design the new wing of the Abdin Palace in Cairo. He became known around the world for his innovative use of color, his pointillist technique, and his decorative use of line. He designed buildings throughout the world from Esterhazy Castle in Hungary to the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York. Urban studied architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Karl von Hasenauer. In 1890, he and his brother-in-law, Heinrich Lefler, were among the founders of the Hagenbund. Urban's early work with illustrated books was inspired by Lefler and, together, they created what are considered seminal examples of children's book illustration. Urban immigrated to the United States in 1911 to become the art director of the Boston Opera Company. He was already an accomplished international architect, illustrator and theatre set designer with over 50 productions from his home Vienna Royal Opera, the Champs Elys√©e Opera, and Covent Garden. By applying points of primary colors side by side on the canvas backdrops he was able to create and light theatre sets of vivid color reminiscent of the works by Monet or Seurat. In 1914 he moved to New York City, where he designed productions for the Metropolitan Opera and the Ziegfeld Follies; he continued to design for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. until 1931. William Randolph Hearst was an important client and supporter. He also co- produced with Richard Ordynski Percy MacKaye's \\"Community Masque\\" Caliban by the Yellow Sands. Beginning in 1917, he was frequently engaged as stage designer by the Metropolitan Opera of New York City. In all he created set designs for 47 new productions at the house through 1933. His many designs provided the opera company with a cohesive production style throughout the tenure of General Manager Giulio Gatti-Casazza. Many of Urban's settings remained in the company's repertoire into the 1950s. Soon his sets and innovative lighting caught the eye of Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., who hired him to design the Follies in the 1920s. Urban went to work creating a stunning night- club with glass balconies, a moving stage, and rainbow lighting effects. This Danse de Follies soon became a blend of ideas and talent before serving in the Follies theatre. Urban had success after success in his creating of the Follies' sets, and William Randolph Hearst, a media tycoon, took notice and wanted to hire Urban to work on his films starring Marion Davies, his mistress, and previous Follies starlet. Hearst came to an understanding with his friend Ziegfeld that Urban's work for him would not interfere with any of the Follies productions. Urban worked on 25 films over the years. Urban died July 10, 1933, of a heart attack at his apartment at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where he had been convalescing following surgery in May. Legacy Urban was one of the originators of the American Art Deco style. Most of his architectural work in the United States has been demolished. Extant buildings include the Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida; The New School building in New York City; and the base of the Hearst Tower in New York City. The stage lighting gel Roscolux Urban Blue #81, still used today, is named for him.

Lincoln was born in Mauritius to Francis Lincoln, a British colonial civil servant, and R√©gina De Baize. He studied insurance in Mauritius and in Cape Town, South Africa. He emigrated to Canada in 1958, settling first in Vancouver and then in Montreal, where he became an insurance company executive. He was first elected to the Quebec National Assembly in 1981 as a member of the Liberal Party. When the Liberals formed government in 1985, Lincoln was appointed Minister of the Environment by Premier Robert Bourassa. Lincoln and two other anglophone ministers resigned from cabinet in 1989, to protest the Bourassa government's language policy and its adoption of Bill 178, which invoked the notwithstanding clause of the Canadian Constitution to require French to be the dominant language on commercial signs. He campaigned for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada in 1990. At the same time, he contested a by- election in the federal electoral district of Chambly. He lost the by-election to Phil Edmonston of the New Democratic Party and then withdrew from the Liberal leadership contest. He was elected to Parliament in the 1993 federal election in the district of Lachine‚ÄîLac-Saint-Louis and was re-elected in Lac- Saint-Louis in 1997 and 2000. He served as parliamentary secretary to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of the Environment from 1993 until 1996. He also served as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage from 1997 until 2004. As such he wrote a report on Canadian broadcasting, Our Cultural Sovereignty: The Second Century of Canadian Broadcasting; its recommendations were largely ignored by the government. Lincoln retired from politics at the 2004 federal election and was appointed Chairman of the Panel on Access to Third-language Public Television ServicesCanada Gazette Part II, Vol. 138, No. 17 by the federal government. As of 2007, Lincoln is President of the Board of Directors of the English Speaking Catholic Council of Quebec. In December 2012, he released Toward New Horizons, a memoir of his life in politics.

The film was the fifth of six collaborations between Gable and Harlow and the fourth of seven between Gable and Loy. May Robson portrays Gable's character's meddling mother. The story was based on the short story of the same name by Faith Baldwin published in Cosmopolitan Magazine in May 1935. The screenplay was written by Norman Krasna, John Lee Mahin and Alice Duer Miller. Plot Myrna Loy and Clark GableMagazine publisher Van Stanhope (Clark Gable) and his wife, Linda (Myrna Loy), are celebrating their third wedding anniversary. They are very much in love and Van gives Linda a diamond bracelet. However, Van's secretary, the beautiful Helen \\"Whitey\\" Wilson (Jean Harlow), is thought by Van's mother (May Robson) to be a temptation to Van. Linda refuses to listen to all of her friends and Van's mother as she trusts Van. In truth, she has all the reason in the world to trust him, as his relationship with Whitey is strictly business. Meanwhile, Whitey's beau, Dave (James Stewart), is very uncomfortable about her relationship with Van as he calls one night while they're having dinner to ask that Whitey help him finish work at a party. When Dave asks Whitey to marry him, Whitey refuses, and buries herself further in her work. When Van has to be very secretive to buy J. D. Underwood's (George Barbier) weekly, for fear that his rival will buy it instead, only Whitey is permitted to know, providing still more conflict between Van and his wife. When Van returns from his business meeting with Underwood, and tells Linda that he has been at the club all day, Linda discovers that he has not been at the club but rather has been out with Whitey, who was merely helping him prepare for his discussion with Underwood. At a skating party, Linda is too sick to skate. As Van and Whitey skate together, Linda hears from one of the wives there that Van and Whitey are most likely having an affair. When Linda and Van get into the car, they fight when Linda requests that Van have Whitey moved to another employer. Van refuses and Linda ignores him for the rest of the evening until she calls him back to make up. Van plans a trip for himself and Linda, but when he learns that Underwood is at a conference in Havana, changes his plans and won't permit Linda to accompany him while he works. Whitey learns of important information regarding the rival paper, which results in Van bringing her to Havana to close the deal. While celebrating the successful closing of the deal, they develop a drunken attraction to each other but do not consummate this attraction. When Linda calls at 2 am, Whitey answers the phone, and she assumes they are having an affair. Van returns to New York only to have Linda ignoring him entirely and asking for a divorce. Lonely, he asks Whitey to accompany him to Bermuda as a friend, which she, having fallen in love with Van, agrees to. But, realizing that Van will never love her as much as he loves Linda, Whitey visits her on the ship that Linda has planned to take to Europe. Whitey challenges her to go back to Van, telling her that she would be a fool to let him go. After resistance, Linda meets him in his office, and they make up. Whitey is then met by Dave, and they make up as well.

The picture was the first time that Harlow and Loy worked together;IMDB they would both appear as well in Libeled Lady later in 1936, also starring William Powell and Spencer Tracy, with Harlow billed first. On Harlow during the making of Wife Vs. Secretary, Loy said, \\"Jean was beautiful, but far from the raucous sexpot of her films. As a matter of fact, she began to shake that image in Wife vs. Secretary....She'd begged for a role that didn't require spouting slang and modeling lingerie. She even convinced them to darken her hair a shade, in hopes of toning down that brash image. It worked. She's really wonderful in the picture and her popularity wasn't diminished one bit. Actually we did kind of a reversal in that picture. Jean, supposedly the other woman, stayed very proper, while I had one foot in bed throughout. That's the sexiest wife I've ever played. In one scene, Clark stands outside my bedroom door and we banter, nothing more, but there's just no question about what they've done the night before. Clarence Brown, our director, made it all so subtle, yet, oh, so wonderfully suggestive. (In fact, the only vulgarity in the picture is in the breakfast scene, where I discover a diamond bracelet that Clark has hidden in the brook trout I'm about to eat. It didn't seem chic or funny to me‚Äîmerely messy, typical of Hollywood's misguided notion of upper-class sophistication. I tried to get them to take it out, but they wouldn't. Needless to say, it's the scene everyone remembers, so what do I know?). Where sex is concerned, the double entendre, the ambiguity, it seems to me, is much more effective than being too explicit. This is something the moviemakers don't seem to understand today.\\" James Stewart, meanwhile, spoke of his scene in the car with Harlow, saying, \\"Clarence Brown, the director, wasn't too pleased by the way I did the smooching. He made us repeat the scene about half a dozen times...I botched it up on purpose. That Jean Harlow sure was a good kisser. I realized that until then I had never been really kissed.\\" Despite being billed sixth in the cast, Stewart enjoys the most screen time aside from the three leads, mainly romantic sequences with Harlow, including the final scene and dialogue in the movie. Box office According to MGM records the film earned $1,350,000 in the US and Canada and $717,000 elsewhere, resulting in a profit of $876,000.

It was director Hur Jin-ho's debut and stars Han Suk-kyu and Shim Eun-ha. Plot After a failed engagement, photo shop owner Jung-won (Han Suk-kyu) is in his 30s and lives with his relatives: his sister, her husband and child, and his father. He meets Da-rim (Shim Eun-ha), a young parking agent, when she needs pictures as evidence to use against parking offenders printed quickly. Something clicks between them, they meet there more often and develop feelings for each other. Before their romance goes any further, Jung-won finds out that his recent health problems are symptoms of a terminal disease. Part of his coming to terms with his fate, just when he has found happiness again, is breaking off all contact with Da-rim by closing the photo shop. She is brokenhearted but has no way to find him. Jung-won also creates a step-by-step manual for the developing machine in his shop so his father can take over when Jung-won dies. He goes on a booze spree with his childhood friends as a farewell, but only tells his best friend about his impending death who doesn't believe him until Jung-won breaks down at the police station where they are taken. After a period of time, Jung-won secretly observes how Da-rim is happily doing her job again and satisfied that his plan has worked. He takes a commemorative self-portrait with a timer and, just as the shutter clicks, he smiles.

Han and Shim are named as ideal casting choices by the eponymous aspiring script writer in My Sassy Girl. The film landed in the top spot of Movie Week's special feature of 10 Best Korean Romance/Melodrama from 1980-2007,Movie Week Special Feature, Part 1, October 9, 2007 touting the lead performances as gold standards of the genre. In the same feature, noted director Song Hae-sung of Failan, names the scene of a lonely Jung-won singing \\"In the Street\\" by Kim Kwang-seok (whose funeral portrait inspired Hur Jin-ho's debut film), as a particularly resonant example of melodrama transcending its genre to express humanity's essence.Movie Week Special Feature, Part 5, October 9, 2007  Motifs  In the film, there were several motifs that the director tried to convey to the audience. Photography had a significant part in this movie. The director purposely made the scenes of the film very still and slow. His purpose doing so was to create the sense of a photo, where everything is still. This was meant to allow the audience to observe every detail, just a like a photo. Windows were another motif, encompassing the same idea of photography. During the scenes, where Da-rim and Jung-won would have a silent conversation on opposite sides of a window, the window symbolized a picture frame, creating a living portrait. When Jung-won's childhood love came to visit his shop while he was washing the windows, her image is blurry behind the window. This was meant to symbolize that she no longer had a clear place in his life. That's why when the other scenes, where Jung-won sees Da-rim from behind the window, the audience observes that Jung- won always sees Da-rim vividly, symbolizing that she does have an important part in his life. During one of the last scenes, Jung-won is seem affectionately reaching out to Da-rim behind a window. Photos are meant to capture precious memories, and we can only remember, unable to change the photo's reality. This was the symbolism of windows. The funeral portrait was another motif, which symbolized Jung-won's acceptance of his early death. In the earlier scenes of the movie, Jung-won took a funeral portrait for an elderly woman. She had come back a second time to take her funeral portrait because she wanted to look her best, meaning she acknowledges her death soon and wants to make the most out of it. Through the movie we see Jung-won and emphasis on han, internal suffering. Near the end of the movie, Jung-won returns to his shop and proceeds to take his funeral portrait. This shows that he had finally come to terms with his early death, and was able to die peacefully, with no regrets. This can be confirmed by his final quote. The final quote, itself, became a motif. \\"I knew that someday love would become nothing but a memory, like the countless photographs left behind in my recollections. But you alone have remained a part of me. I leave these words to thank you for letting me depart with your love.\\"-Jung-won. This explains the reason why Jung-won did not try to tell Da-rim that he was fatally ill and did not try to reach out or explain to her his sudden disappearance. Jung-won did not want to taint the love he and Da-rim shared. It can be speculated that he did not want it to be love out of pity. Like a photo, he wanted to preserve his memories of Da-rim while they were still innocent and happy, unlike his childhood love, which turned out to be an unfortunate ending. This allowed him to die peacefully, departing from the world with his innocent memories of her. In the scenes where his childhood lover came back, she requested him to take down her portrait. But at the end of the movie, it is seen that Da-rim's portrait remained in his shop window, symbolizing how Jung-won will never forget about her and take her out of his life.  Character analysis  = Jung-won = Jung-won is the main character in this film. He owns a photography shop, which is where most of the film takes place. In the beginning of the film Jung-won was very optimistic. He didn't show his emotions about his inevitable death because he didn't want to burden others with the fact that he was going to die. The first time he announced that he was going to die was when he was drunk with his friend, Chul-goo. After this scene he begins to display more emotion about his imminent death, for example when he was at the police station he started to yell and cry causing a commotion, which was uncharacteristic of him to do. From this point forward Jung-won's personality begins to change, he is no longer as happy and optimistic as he was in the beginning of the film. Jung-won is unable to contain his emotions making the audience see his vulnerable state. = Da-rim = Da-rim is a traffic officer in this film. In the beginning of the film Da- rim is first introduced to Jung-won at the photography shop. At first she didn't seem interested in Jung-won; however, as she routinely went to his shop they became closer and more attached. She found herself falling in love with Jung-won and she eventually started to transition her appearance by wearing make-up. When Jung-won was admitted into the hospital and no longer went to work, Da-rim went to his shop every day. At this point because Jung-won disappeared without notice Da-rim started to miss him a lot. She even wrote a letter to Jung-won that the audience could only assume was contained with her feelings for him. She eventually became angry and threw a rock at the photography shop through her frustration that Jung-won disappeared. Eventually Da-rim learned to move on and accepted the fact that Jung-won will not come back.  Korean melodramas  Linda Williams analyzed the film Way Down East (1920) and wrote an essay \\"Melodrama Revised\\" noting five features found in current melodramas that have still remained relevant in Korean cinema: *1.) Melodrama begins and wants to end with a sense of innocence. *2.) Melodrama focuses on victim-heroes and their virtues *3.) Melodrama appears modern by using realism, but realism also gives passion and action *4.) Melodrama involves a balance of passion and action such as being \\"too late\\" or \\"in the nick of time\\" *5.) Melodrama presents characters with psychic roles and conflicts between good and evil Christmas in August does not incorporate all of the features, and is missing the fourth and fifth one. However, leaving out the fifth feature had become common since the 1990s. This was because South Korea's authoritarian government, which advocated moral frameworks in film through censorship, had collapsed. Starting in the 1980s, filmmakers were able to make their work seem more modern by leaving out the conflict between good and evil.  Remake  In the 2007 Japanese remake directed by Shunichi Nagasaki, the female character is a teacher.

He was created by writer Peter David, and first appeared in Web of Spider-Man #15 (June 1986). The Foreigner is a mercenary and assassin. Although he has no superhuman abilities, he has trained his body to be in absolute peak physical condition, is among the greatest martial arts practitioners in the Marvel Universe, and as a professional assassin, who has evaded detection by various international law enforcement agencies, is highly intelligent. He is often depicted as being exceedingly competent. The Foreigner was formerly married to Silver Sable. Publication history Writer Peter David created the Foreigner as a master assassin character to be a nemesis for Spider-Man. According to David, the character was designed to bear a strong resemblance to Patrick McGoohan.David, Peter. \\"Weird, Twisted, Reasonably True Comic Book Stories\\". peterdavid.net. November 11, 2011. Reprinted from \\"But I Digress...\\" Comics Buyer's Guide #1169 (April 12, 1996). The character's voice was first heard on a telephone in a scene in Web of Spider-Man #15 (June 1986), which was written by David Michelinie, but he did not make a full, visual appearance until later that year in The Spectacular Spider-Man #116 (July 1986). The Foreigner was favored by editor Jim Owsley as the Hobgoblin's true identity. Fictional character biography The Foreigner first appeared as a foe of Spider-Man when making a wager with another villain, Chance, that the latter could not defeat and kill Spider-Man. The Foreigner won this wager.Web of Spider-Man #15 In an attempt to impress the Foreigner, the assassin Sabretooth volunteered to kill the thief known as the Black Cat who had stolen a solid gold notebook from the Foreigner's office. However, Spider-Man intervened and defeated Sabretooth.Spectacular Spider-Man #115-116 Eventually, he defeated the Black Cat himself and then decided, instead of executing, to start a romantic relationship to use under the pretense of forming an alliance in order to destroy Spider-Man (all the while the true ulterior motive being to enlist the membership of Spider-Man as an assassin in his 1400 Club). Spider-Man turned him down and the Foreigner was forced to abandon that identity. The Foreigner hired an assassin to assume the identity of Blaze to fire-bomb the Black Cat's apartment. Disguised as Lieutenant Kris Keating, the Foreigner killed Blaze and framed Spider-Man for the job.Spectacular Spider-Man #125 As Keating, the Foreigner escaped an assassination attempt by the Rose.Web of Spider-Man #29 He finally battled Spider-Man for the first time, and was betrayed by the Black Cat.Spectacular Spider-Man #129 The Foreigner hired the Hobgoblin to steal an incriminating ledger from the Kingpin.Spectacular Spider-Man #130 The Foreigner was defeated by Silver Sable in a fencing duel.Silver Sable #3 Blood Rose hired the Foreigner, who in turn hired the Hunters and the New Enforcers to bring down the remnants of the Kingpin's empire.Web of Spider-Man #97-100 In the past, he has started a club of assassins called the 1400 Club. The CIA, FBI, and most government agencies throughout the world are not aware of the Foreigner's existence or that of his organization. As a master of disguise, he has literally hundreds of identities all over the world. These identities are used not only by him, but by other members of his organization who are also masters of disguise and assassination. He was formerly married to Silver Sable, and was romantically involved for a short time with the Black Cat. He is a friend of Wilson Fisk and it is rumored that the two were friends when the Foreigner was hired to kill Fisk by one of his enemies but the Foreigner discovered they had the same birthday and capriciously decided to kill his employer instead. Later, he met Fisk and initiated their friendship/business relationship. The Foreigner was once hired to kill the Hobgoblin by the mercenary Jason Macendale (who later himself became the Hobgoblin). He carried out the execution of Ned Leeds. The Foreigner's men made quick work and slit Leeds's throat.Amazing Spider-Man #289 It was later revealed that Leeds was actually a puppet of the original Hobgoblin who had abandoned the persona to avoid such an assassination. Later he hired Whisper, Pulse, Swift, and Warfare to kill Betty Brant Leeds, who was seeking to expose the Foreigner's role in Ned's death. He revealed to Betty that Leeds was supposedly the original Hobgoblin.Web of Spider-Man #91-92 At some time in the past, the Foreigner trained the superhuman mutant known as Sabretooth. He has since distanced himself from his former novice. It seems the Foreigner shuns Sabretooth's murderous nature, at least in so much that Sabretooth even kills people when it is not profitable, which the Foreigner considers bad business practice. He has been hired by many different characters carry out various assassinations. He has never been incarcerated or positively identified by authorities. The few cases in which he did not carry out his objectives tended to be due to his personal whimsy and not his inability. The Foreigner's real name and origin have yet to be revealed and although he speaks with a British accent, he may not be British. At one point, machinations by Justin Hammer turned the 1400 Club against him and the organization was destroyed; the Foreigner did not seem to intend to rebuild it, as he realized the whole thing was too unwieldy and bloated for his tastes. It was discovered that Foreigner is the one responsible for murdering Thunderbolt Ross, and framing Captain America for the crime.Captain America Vol. 9 #9. Marvel Comics. A somehow revived and rejuvenated Peggy Carter, operating as Dryad, takes down Foreigner's New York- based safe houses.Captain America Vol. 9 #10. Marvel Comics. Peggy confronts Foreigner and fights him until Crossbones and Sin shoot a missile at them. Peggy survives the attack, while Foreigner presumably perishes.Captain America Vol. 9 #11. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Foreigner has no superhuman abilities. However, he has trained his body to be in absolute peak physical condition. He is stronger, faster, more agile, and has better reaction time than any Olympic athlete. He is adept in all known forms of martial arts, and most forms of conventional hand weaponry. He is among the greatest pugilists in the Marvel Universe, similar in ability to Captain America and Wolverine. His skills are such that even without superhuman abilities, he is able to pull off seemingly inhuman feats of strength through intense concentration, and has even battled Spider-Man to a stand still. He possesses a near-mystic ability to place an opponent in a 10-second hypnotic trance through eye-contact, which makes the opponent believe the Foreigner can move faster than the eye can see. He has hypnotized Spider-Man in this fashion, which left Spider-Man disoriented or in a light trance for a few seconds while the Foreigner ran away at what seemed to be nearly superhuman speed; from Spider-Man's perspective it appeared that the Foreigner had teleported away.

In the late 1960s, he began working with the then 19-year-old George Dalaras. He wrote Dalaras' first songs and helped establish Dalaras as one of the most important and successful Greek singers of all time. Kouyioumtzis songs have been covered by many important Greek singers, inclouding; Anna Vissi, Haris Alexiou, Yiannis Parios, Eleftheria Arvanitaki and Giannis Kalatzis. Aside from his solo compositions, Kouyioumtzis co-operated frequently with the poet-lyricist Manos Eleftheriou. Kouyioumtzis songs are regarded as top-quality music in Greece. Both his solo writing as well as his co writes with Manos Eleftheriou. Kouyioumtzis' songs resonated deeply with Greeks in the sixties, exploring themes of; love, poverty and the agonies faced by the poor in living with dignity. According to lyricist Lefteris Papadopoulos, Kouyioumtzis \\"followed the music spirit which was dominant in Greece during the last 25 years (from 1965 to 1990) through the music of Mikis Theodorakis and Manos Hadjidakis\\". Stavros Kouyioumtzis is remembered as a character of calm disposition, widely respected and held in the highest esteem by many, both in the field of Greek music as well as Greeks in general. A bashful character, it is characteristic that Kouyioumtzis preferred privacy over celebrity. Media appearances were infrequent, except on special occasions. His last appearance on television was in the entertainment music show of Spyros Papadopoulos on NET TV.

Most of the literature on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist along a continuum ‚Äì from emergency shelters, to transitional housing, to non-market rental (also known as social or subsidized housing), to formal and informal rental, indigenous housing, and ending with affordable home ownership.CNHED In Australia, the National Affordable Housing Summit Group developed their definition of affordable housing as housing that is \\"...reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis.\\"\\"Definition: Affordable Housing\\" , Queensland Affordable Housing Consortium, Australia Affordable housing in the United Kingdom includes \\"social rented and intermediate housing, provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market.\\" The notion of housing affordability became widespread in the 1980s in Europe and North America. In the words of Alain Bertaud, of New York University and former principal planner at the World Bank, > It is time for planners to abandon abstract objectives and to focus their > efforts on two measurable outcomes that have always mattered since the > growth of large cities during the 19th century‚Äôs industrial revolution: > workers‚Äô spatial mobility and housing affordability. Housing choice is a response to an extremely complex set of economic, social, and psychological impulses. For example, some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to, while others may not have a choice. Measuring housing affordability = Median multiple = The median multiple indicator, recommended by the World Bank and the United Nations, rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by gross (before tax) annual median household income). > A common measure of community-wide affordability is the number of homes that > a household with a certain percentage of median income can afford. For > example, in a perfectly balanced housing market, the median household (the > wealthier half of households) could officially afford the median housing > option, while those poorer than the median income could not afford the > median home. 50% affordability for the median home indicates a balanced > market. Determining housing affordability is complex and the commonly used housing- expenditure-to-income-ratio tool has been challenged. In the United States and Canada, a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a housing cost that does not exceed 30% of a household's gross income. Canada, for example, switched to a 25% rule from a 20% rule in the 1950s. In the 1980s this was replaced by a 30% rule. India uses a 40% rule. =Housing affordability index= One of the greatest strengths of the housing affordability index (HAI) developed by MIT is its ability to capture the total cost of ownership of individuals' housing choices. In computing the index the obvious cost of rents and mortgage payments are modified by the hidden costs of those choices. Household income and wealth Income is the primary factornot price and availability, that determines housing affordability. In a market economy the distribution of income is the key determinant of the quantity and quality of housing obtained. Therefore, understanding affordable housing challenges requires understanding trends and disparities in income and wealth. Housing is often the single biggest expenditure of low and middle income families. For low and middle income families, their house is also the greatest source of wealth. The most common approach to measure the affordability of housing has been to consider the percentage of income that a household spends on housing expenditures. Another method of studying affordability looks at the regular hourly wage of full-time workers who are paid only the minimum wage (as set by their local, regional, or national government). The hope is that full-time workers will be able to afford at least a small apartment in the area where they work. Some countries look at those living in relative poverty, which is usually defined as making less than 60% of the median household income. In their policy reports, they consider the presence or absence of housing for people making 60% of the median income. Housing expenditures Housing affordability can be measured by the changing relationships between house prices and rents, and between house prices and incomes. There has been an increase among policy makers in affordable housing as the price of housing has increased dramatically creating a crisis in affordable housing. Since 2000 the \\"world experienced an unprecedented house price boom in terms of magnitude and duration, but also of synchronisation across countries.\\" \\"Never before had house prices risen so fast, for so long, in so many countries.\\" Prices doubled in many countries and nearly tripled in Ireland. The bursting of the biggest financial bubble in history in 2008 wreaked havoc globally on the housing market. By 2011 home prices in Ireland had plunged by 45% from their peak in 2007. In the United States prices fell by 34% while foreclosures increased exponentially. In Spain and Denmark home prices dropped by 15%. However, in spite of the bust, home prices continue to be overvalued by about 25% or more in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden. =Causes and consequences of rises in housing prices= Costs are being driven by a number of factors including: * demographics shifts ** the declining number of people per dwelling ** growing density convergence, regional urbanization ** solid population growth (for example sky-high prices in Australia and Canada as a rising population pushes up demand) * supply and demand ** a shortfall in the number of dwellings to the number of households *** smaller family size *** the strong psychological desire for home ownershiphttp://www.rideforhome.com.au/files/pdf/HousingAffordability.pdf * shifts in economic policies and innovations in financial instruments ** reduced profitability of other forms of investment ** availability of housing finance ** low interest rates ** mortgage market innovations * public policy ** deregulation ** land use zoning ** significant taxes, levies and fees by government on new housing (especially in Australia) Inequality and housing A number of researchers argue that a shortage of affordable housing ‚Äì at least in the US ‚Äì is caused in part by income inequality. David Rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991, the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased. Through gentrification of older neighbourhoods, for example, in East New York, rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units. The ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace. =Other housing expenditures= In measuring affordability of housing there are various expenditures beyond the price of the actual housing stock itself, that are considered depending on the index being used. Some organizations and agencies consider the cost of purchasing a single-family home; others look exclusively at the cost of renting an apartment. Many U.S. studies, for example, focus primarily on the median cost of renting a two-bedroom apartment in a large apartment complex for a new tenant. These studies often lump together luxury apartments and slums, as well as desirable and undesirable neighborhoods. While this practice is known to distort the true costs, it is difficult to provide accurate information for the wide variety of situations without the report being unwieldy. Normally, only legal, permitted, separate housing is considered when calculating the cost of housing. The low rent costs for a room in a single family home, or an illegal garage conversion, or a college dormitory are generally excluded from the calculation, no matter how many people in an area live in such situations. Because of this study methodology, median housing costs tend to be slightly inflated. Costs are generally considered on a cash (not accrual) basis. Thus a person making the last payment on a large home mortgage might live in officially unaffordable housing one month, and very affordable housing the following month, when the mortgage is paid off. This distortion can be significant in areas where real estate costs are high, even if incomes are similarly high, because a high income allows a higher proportion of the income to be dedicated towards buying an expensive home without endangering the household's ability to buy food or other basic necessities. Growing density convergence and regional urbanization The majority of the more than seven billion people on earth now live in cities (UN). There are more than 500 city regions of more than one million inhabitants in the world. Cities become megacities become megalopolitan city regions and even \\"galaxies\\" of more than 60 million inhabitants. The Yangtze Delta-Greater Shanghai region now surpasses 80 million. Tokyo-Yokohama adjacent to Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto have a combined population of 100 million. Rapid population growth leads to increased need for affordable housing in most cities. The availability of affordable housing in proximity of mass transit and linked to job distribution has become severely imbalanced in this period of rapid regional urbanization and growing density convergence. \\"In addition to the distress it causes families who cannot find a place to live, lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community's overall health.\\" Affordable housing challenges in inner cities range from the homeless who are forced to live on the street to the relative deprivation of vital workers like police officers, firefighters, teachers and nurses unable to find affordable accommodation near their place of work. These workers are forced to live in suburbia, commuting up to two hours each way to work. Lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labour scarcer (as workers travel longer distances) (Pollard and Stanley 2007). Economy Lack of affordable housing places a particular burden on local economies. As well, individual consumers are faced with mortgage arrears and excessive debt and therefore cut back on consumption. A combination of high housing costs and high debt levels contributes to a reduction in savings. These factors can lead to decreased investment in sectors that are essential to the long-term growth of the economy. =Supply and demand= In some countries, the market has been unable to meet the growing demand to supply housing stock at affordable prices. Although demand for affordable housing, particularly rental housing that is affordable for low and middle income earners, has increased, the supply has not. Potential home buyers are forced to turn to the rental market, which is also under pressure. An inadequate supply of housing stock increases demand on the private and social rented sector, and in worse case scenarios, homelessness. =Some of the factors that affect the supply and demand of housing stock= * Demographic and behavioural factors * Migration (to cities and potential employment) * Increased life expectancy * Building codesListokin, David; Hattis, David B., \\"Building Codes and Housing\\", Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research, Volume 8, Number 1, 2005, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research * A greater propensity for people to live alone * Young adults delaying forming their own household (in advanced economies) * Exclusionary zoning =Factors that affect tenure choices (ex. owner occupier, private rented, social rented)= * Employment rates ** Rising unemployment rates increase demand for market rentals, social housing and homelessness. * Real household incomes ** Household incomes have not kept up with rising housing prices * Affordability of rents and owner occupation * Interest rates * Availability of mortgages * Levels of confidence in the economy and housing market ** Low confidence decreases demand for owner occupation. Labour market performance In both large metropolitan areas and regional towns where housing prices are high, a lack of affordable housing places local firms at a competitive disadvantage. They are placed under wage pressures as they attempt to decrease the income/housing price gap. Key workers have fewer housing choices if prices rise to non-affordable levels. Variations in affordability of housing between areas may create labour market impediments. Potential workers are discouraged from moving to employment in areas of low affordability. They are also discouraged from migrating to areas of high affordability as the low house prices and rents indicate low capital gain potential and poor employment prospects. Social costs of lack of affordable housing Housing affordability is more than just a personal trouble experienced by individual households who cannot easily find a place to live.The Housing of Good Intentions: The Naya Pakistan Housing Program. Housing & Community Development Law eJournal. Social Science Research Network (SSRN). Accessed 31 January 2020. Lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community's overall health. = Jobs, transportation, and affordable housing = Lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labor more scarce, and increase demands on transportation systems (as workers travel longer distances between jobs and affordable housing). Housing cost increases in U.S. cities have been linked to declines in enrollment at local schools. \\"Faced with few affordable options, many people attempt to find less expensive housing by buying or renting farther out, but long commutes often result in higher transportation costs that erase any savings on shelter.\\" Pollard (2010) called this the \\"drive 'til you qualify\\" approach, which causes far-flung development and forces people to drive longer distances to get to work, to get groceries, to take children to school, or to engage in other activities. A well located dwelling might save significant household travel costs and therefore improve overall family economics, even if the rent is higher than a dwelling in a poorer location. A household's inhabitants must decide whether to pay more for housing to keep commuting time and expense low, or to accept a long or expensive commute to obtain \\"better\\" housing. The absolute availability of housing is not generally considered in the calculation of affordable housing. In a depressed or sparsely settled rural area, for example, the predicted price of the canonical median two-bedroom apartment may be quite easily affordable even to a minimum- wage worker ‚Äì if only any apartments had ever been built. Some affordable housing prototypes include Nano House and Affordable Green Tiny House Project. Affordable housing and public policy Policy makers at all levels ‚Äì global, national, regional, municipal, community associations ‚Äì are attempting to respond to the issue of affordable housing, a highly complex crisis of global proportions, with a myriad of policy instruments. These responses range from stop-gap financing tools to long-term intergovernmental infrastructural changes. In the simplest of terms, affordability of housing refers to the amount of capital one has available in relation to the price of the goods to be obtained. Public policies are informed by underlying assumptions about the nature of housing itself. Is housing a basic need, a right, an entitlement, or a public good? Or is just another household-level consumer choice, a commodity or an investment within the free market system? \\"Housing Policies provide a remarkable litmus test for the values of politicians at every level of office and of the varied communities that influence them. Often this test measures simply the warmth or coldness of heart of the more affluent and secure towards families of a lower socio-economic status (Bacher 1993:16).\\" Affordable housing needs can be addressed through public policy instruments that focus on the demand side of the market, programs that help households reach financial benchmarks that make housing affordable. This can include approaches that simply promote economic growth in generalin the hope that a stronger economy, higher employment rates, and higher wages will increase the ability of households to acquire housing at market prices. Federal government policies define banking and mortgage lending practices, tax and regulatory measures affecting building materials, professional practices (ex. real estate transactions). The purchasing power of individual households can be enhanced through tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of mortgages and the cost of borrowing. Public policies may include the implementation of subsidy programs and incentive patterns for average households. For the most vulnerable groups, such as seniors, single-parent families, the disabled, etc. some form of publicly funded allowance strategy can be implemented providing individual households with adequate income to afford housing. Currently, policies that facilitate production on the supply side include favorable land use policies such as inclusionary zoning, relaxation of environmental regulations, and the enforcement of affordable housing quotas in new developments. In some countries, such as Canada, municipal governments began to play a greater role in developing and implementing policies regarding form and density of municipal housing in residential districts, as early as the 1950s. At the municipal level recently promoted policy tools include relaxation of prohibitions against accessory dwelling units, and reduction of the amount of parking that must be built for a new structure. Affordable housing is a controversial reality of contemporary life, for gains in affordability often result from expanding land available for housing or increasing the density of housing units in a given area. Ensuring a steady supply of affordable housing means ensuring that communities weigh real and perceived livability impacts against the sheer necessity of affordability. The process of weighing the impacts of locating affordable housing is quite contentious and is laden with race and class implications. Recent research, however, suggests that proximity to low-income housing developments generally has a positive impact on neighborhood property conditions.Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Developments and Neighborhood Property Conditions, December 2011 The growing gap between rich and poor since the 1980s manifests itself in a housing system where public policy decisions privilege the ownership sector to the disadvantage of the rental sector. Ann Owen wonders if the housing market helped reduced poverty concentration in the National longitudinal data between the years of 1977‚Äì2008 with the concentration of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the United States. Data information is to compare or intertwine with the differences of national housing subsidies, the entry, exit, and enhancement of low-income housing. Improving thermal comfort at home especially for houses without adequate warmth and for tenants with chronic respiratory disease may lead to improved health and promote social relationships. =Right to build= An article by libertarian writer Virginia Postrel in the November 2007 issue of Atlantic Monthly reported on a study of the cost of obtaining the \\"right to build\\" (i.e. a building permit, red tape, bureaucracy, etc.) in different U.S. cities. The \\"right to build\\" cost does not include the cost of the land or the cost of constructing the house. The study was conducted by Harvard economists Edward Glaeser and Kristina Tobio. According to the chart accompanying the article, the cost of obtaining the \\"right to build\\" adds approximately $600,000 to the cost of each new house that is built in San Francisco. The study, cited, published by Ed Glaeser and Joseph Gyourko, reached its conclusion about the value of the right to build in different localities based on a methodology of comparing the cost of single-family homes on quarter-acre versus half-acre lots to get a marginal land price and then comparing the selling price of homes to construction costs to get a price for the land plus other costs, with the difference between the two being attributed to the cost of zoning and other local government permitting and regulations.‚ÄúA Tale of Two Town Houses‚Äù, Atlantic Monthly, November 2007 =Government restrictions on affordable housing= Many governments put restrictions on the size or cost of a dwelling that people can live in, making it essentially illegal to live permanently in a house that is too small, low-cost or not compliant with other government-defined requirements. Generally, these laws are implemented in an attempt to raise the perceived \\"standard\\" of housing across the country. This can lead to thousands of houses across a country being left empty for much of the year even when there is a great need for more affordable housing; such is the case in countries like Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark, where there is a common tradition to have a summer house. This sometimes raises concerns for the respect of rights such as the right to utilize one's property. In the United States, most cities have zoning codes that set the minimum size for a housing unit (often 400 square feet) as well as the number of non-related persons who can live together in one unit, resulting in having \\"outlawed the bottom end of the private housing market, driving up rents on everything above it.\\" Affordable housing by country The challenges of promoting affordable housing varies by location.

His father George Demetrios was a classical sculptor, trained by Antoine Bourdelle, a student of Auguste Rodin. His mother Virginia Lee Burton was the renowned author and illustrator of children's books, including Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel, and The Little House, for which she won the prestigious Caldecott Medal. She was also a textile designer, founding the Folly Cove cooperative. After graduating from Harvard College in 1953, Aris Demetrios served as an officer for three years in the US Navy. He studied art and sculpture at the George Demetrios School from 1956 to 1959. He studied at the University of California School of Architecture, in 1959. In 1963, Demetrios won his first national sculpture competition, when his proposed design was selected for a major fountain commission on the campus of Stanford University (White Memorial Fountain, or \\"Mem Claw\\"). Soon after, he was chosen for a public art commission in Sacramento in front of the County Courthouse. Next he was selected by David and Lucille Packard to design and fabricate a sculpture for the entry to the Monterey Bay Aquarium (Forms Sung In A Kelp Forest). Demetrios lives in Santa Ynez, California. Career Demetrios successfully completed several monumental public sculptures, including Wind Harp (1967) in South San Francisco; Flame of Freedom,the Bataan War Memorial on the island of Corregidor; the 80' sculpture Cosmos, the fountain Pierine in New York City, Breakthrough, etc.) Wind Harp (1967) was designed for and installed on a hilltop in a South San Francisco industrial park. Originally it was called Cabot, Cabot and Forbes, after the developers of the industrial park. 92 feet tall and made of open metalwork of rusted steel, it is an aeolian harp, strummed by wind. Since the late 20th century, Demetrios has designed, fabricated and installed a large number of commissioned works for the gardens of private collectors, including several bronze fountains. In addition, he has had several gallery and museum shows featuring his figurative bronze sculptures, such as Trickster; his abstract bronze sculptures, such as The Cube, and his painted or patinaed steel sculptures, such as Tomorrow's Dreams. Many of these pieces are held in private collections. In 2002, Demetrios won the \\"Santa Barbara Beautiful Award\\" for the most beautiful work of public art. It was given to acknowledge his 18' bronze fountain, Mentors, a centerpiece at Santa Barbara City College, in a site overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The Fountain was donated to the campus by Eli Luria and Michael Towbes, two Santa Barbara philanthropists. Each owns other works by Demetrios.

He also appeared in the ITV period drama Upstairs, Downstairs as the pragmatic family solicitor Sir Geoffrey Dillon. Life and career Born in Kings Norton, Worcestershire (now a suburb of Birmingham) in 1904, Huntley made his stage debut at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on 1 April 1922, in A Woman Killed with Kindness. His London debut followed at the Court Theatre on 22 February 1924, in As Far as Thought can Reach. He subsequently inherited the role of Count Dracula from Edmund Blake in Hamilton Deane's touring adaptation of Dracula, which arrived at London's Little Theatre on 14 February 1927, subsequently transferring to the larger Duke of York's Theatre. Later that year he was offered the chance to reprise the role on Broadway (in a script streamlined by John L. Balderston); when he declined, the part was taken by Bela Lugosi instead. Huntley did, however, appear in a US touring production of the Deane/Balderston play, covering the east coast and midwest, from 1928 to 1930. \\"I have always considered the role of Count Dracula to have been an indiscretion of my youth,\\" he recalled in 1989.David J Skal, Hollywood Gothic: The Tangled Web of 'Dracula' from Novel to Stage to Screen, WW Norton & Co 1990 After Dracula he made his Broadway debut at the Vanderbilt Theatre on 23 February 1931, in The Venetian Glass Nephew. On returning to the UK, his many West End appearances included The Farmer's Wife (Queen's Theatre 1932), Cornelius (Duchess Theatre 1935), Bees on the Boat Deck (Lyric Theatre 1936) Time and the Conways (Duchess Theatre 1937), When We Are Married (St Martin's Theatre 1940), Rebecca (Queen's Theatre 1940; Strand Theatre 1942), They Came to a City (Globe Theatre 1943), The Late Edwina Black (Ambassadors Theatre 1948), And This Was Odd (Criterion Theatre 1951), Double Image (Savoy Theatre 1956), Any Other Business (Westminster Theatre 1958), Caught Napping (Piccadilly Theatre 1959), Difference of Opinion (Garrick Theatre 1963), An Ideal Husband (Garrick Theatre 1966), Getting Married (Strand Theatre 1967), Soldiers (New Theatre 1968)John Parker (ed), Who's Who in the Theatre (15th edition), Pitman Publishing 1972 and Separate Tables (Apollo Theatre 1977). He also starred opposite Flora Robson in the Broadway production of Black Chiffon (48th Street Theatre 1950). Often cast as a supercilious bureaucrat or other authority figure, Huntley was also a staple figure in British films, his many appearances including The Way Ahead, I See a Dark Stranger, Passport to Pimlico and The Dam Busters. In his later years he became well known on television as Sir Geoffrey Dillon, the family solicitor to the Bellamys in LWT's popular 1970s drama series Upstairs, Downstairs. Huntley died in Westminster Hospital, London in 1990. In his obituary the New York Times wrote, \\"During his long career the actor played judges, bank managers, churchmen, bureaucrats and other figures of authority. He could play them straight if necessary, but in comedy his natural dryness of delivery was exaggerated to the point where the character he was playing invited mockery as a pompous humbug.\\" Complete filmography * What Happened Then?

His father and grandfather had practised as architects. Training in his teens in watercolour painting, he found work in the relatively new art of lithography when the first press was set up in Tournai. He visited England to find work, and settled there permanently in 1823. Together with William Day (1797‚Äì1845), around 1830 he formed the partnership Day & Haghe, which became the most famous early Victorian firm of lithographic printing in London. Day and Haghe created and printed lithographs dealing with a wide range of subjects, such as hunting scenes, architecture, topographical views and genre depictions. They pioneered the new techniques for chromolithography as well as hand-tinted lithographs. After William's death in 1845, the firm became known as 'Day & Son'. They were pioneers in developing the medium of the lithograph printed in colours. In 1838, Day and Haghe were appointed 'Lithographers to the Queen'. Possibly his most ambitious project was providing 250 images for David Roberts' The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt, and Nubia printed between 1842‚Äì1849. Roberts praised his skill and artistry, although John Ruskin called it 'forced'. From the mid-1850s Haghe concentrated more on his watercolours, and gained a reputation for his architectural scenes of northern Europe, with his pictures bought and displayed by the Victoria and Albert Museum. He also painted in oils, which were exhibited at the British Institution. He became president of the New Society of Painters in Water Colours from 1873 to 1884. Haghe's artistic works were achieved in spite of a deformity in his right hand since birth. He died at Stockwell Road on 9 March 1885 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. His younger brother Charles Haghe (-1888) (also known as Charles Hague) was employed as an assistant at Day and Haghe, and remained there after Louis left.

Unlike the rest of the country's courts, the Constitutional Court has important characteristics, such as a special composition, and unique competences. The main task of the court is to review the constitutionality of the newly approved laws, but it also has important powers related to the President of the Republic, the political parties, and referenda. The Portuguese Constitution defines the Constitutional Court as a completely independent organ that operates independently from the other branches of government, such as the Executive or the Legislative. The Justices of the Constitutional Court are independent and cannot be impeached. The decisions of the court are above the decisions of any other authority. The court convenes in Lisbon, in the Ratton Palace located in Bairro Alto. Organization The court is composed by thirteen Justices, ten of them are elected by the Assembly of the Republic, the main legislative branch of the country, and they must be elected by two thirds majority of the members of the Assembly. The remaining three are elected by the already elected Justices. Of the thirteen Justices, six must be chosen among the general court's judges, the remaining must have at least a degree in law. The Justices serve a nine years mandate and cannot be re-elected. The Constitutional Court elects its own president and vice-president and approves its own rules, schedule and budget. The President of the Constitutional Court (together with the President of the Supreme Court) is the fourth person in the Portuguese state hierarchy (after the President of the Republic, the President of the Assembly of the Republic, and the Prime Minister, in that order) and has several competences, such as conducting the relations between the court and the other authorities, receiving the candidatures for President of the Republic and presiding the court's sessions.

She first appeared in Justice League Europe #47 (1993), and was created by Gerard Jones and Ron Randall. Fictional character biography Chandi Gupta manifested her elemental powers at an early age, barely into her teenage years. Her parents, unsure of what to do, left her in the care of a strange Indian cult that they themselves had become followers of. The leaders of this cult were convinced that she was the reincarnation of one of the Hindu gods, Shiva. Chandi, confused and terrified, realised that the cult was evil and planning to sacrifice her. Horrified, she escaped, and fled to London. =With the League= In London under the alias Maya, she witnesses the Justice League Europe brawl with the supervillain Sonar. She reluctantly uses her powers to assist them in their battle and manages to single-handedly defeat the threat. Grateful for her timely assistance, the JLE offers her official membership. Feeling she had nowhere else to go, she gladly accepts. One of her earliest missions with them involves a return to her homeland India, where she comes under attack from her supposed protector, the Mahayogi. Fortunately, she fends him off long enough to escape and rejoin her team. Maya is alone in the Justice League castle headquarters when it is attacked by three of the Bloodlines parasites. She manages to evade them and summons help by firing bursts of energy high into the night sky. She is rescued by her teammates and the armored superhero Lionheart. =Overmaster= The JLE journey to Nepal, where she encounters a boy with powers similar to hers. However, the child is killed, and Maya learns that the cult that had held her as a young girl was a front for a villain called the Overmaster, who planned to destroy the Earth. Overmaster takes control of her mind and uses her against her teammates, but the Mahayogi, whom she had fought earlier with the League, sacrifices himself in order to free her mind. After a climactic confrontation with the Overmaster, the JLE disbands. Maya's parents (her mother Bharata; her father is unnamed) demonstrate fire-based powers of their own that involve an amulet and calling upon Shiva. Realizing they were no longer part of the cult, Maya decides to give her parents one more chance. Their reunion is marred by a confrontation with the armored, League-hating Vox Humana. Though the League assists Maya and her parents, the villains are driven away by human League supporters. Maya resides with her parents in India. She attended the \\"funeral\\" of Maxwell Lord. She was also seen in an adventure in which she aids Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman #174 =Infinite Crisis and Beyond= She was briefly seen during Infinite Crisis. Maya made her most recent appearance in the Teen Titans series during the Final Crisis and Battle for the Cowl events. She is one of the candidates considered by Robin to replace the empty slots on the team roster left by Supergirl, Miss Martian, and Rose Wilson. Maya ultimately ends up being passed over in favor of Static, Aquagirl, and Kid Eternity. Powers and abilities Maya was originally only able to manifest a mystical bow. She has used it as a conventional bow, able to fire sometimes devastatingly powerful projectiles usually made of mystical fire or water, or, on one occasion, to enhance her speed and strength. She later developed the ability to manifest large amounts of fire or water without using the bow as a focus. Her powers are similar to those of the Indian heroine Celsius.

It is credited to the late party leader Jos√© Francisco Pe√±a G√≥mez.  Definition  It is designed to allow two (or more) same-party members share a particular congressional seat during a single political term, which lasts four years (2+2=4). This is permitted by means of well manipulated Constitutional loopholes orchestrated by the political party who usually holds the executive branch seat (Head of State) and/or has congressional majority (both in upper and lower chambers). It has been used mostly by the PRD party which coined the term themselves, but it may apply to the other two main Dominican parties.  Mechanism  The Dos m√°s Dos formula works as follows: # During primary elections the party does not come to a conclusion as to who is going to be selected to represent the party in the next elections ballot for a particular Senate (or lower representative) chair. This is the result of internal payoffs and/or electoral \\"sabotage\\". It can also happen when there's a clear distinction between one candidate with the wealthiest sponsorship and the other who ranks better in the electoral polls. # The \\"salomonic\\" solution to this mess is to propose that only one should be registered in the official electoral ballot, and the other should wait for the second mid-term. # If the party should win the elections for that particular seat, the elected person can run office for only half the time of the elected term. # When the time comes, he should willingly retire in lieu of some phony excuse. The most alleged excuse is \\"health reasons\\", although some more cynical step down claiming \\"patriotic\\" reasons. # He should immediately propose to Congress his substitute, which in no surprise, is the party member that \\"tied\\" with him in the internal primaries for that spot. # The second candidate takes office.  Flaws  * The main flaw to this \\"private agreement\\" strategy is that violates a primary Constitutional precept that states that no congressional seat should be held by a person that no voter elected for in the first place. * Even since its first use, the vast majority of elected members that used the \\"2+2\\" formula refuses to give up their chair when due, claiming that it is a Constitutional violation and a flagrant interference. * It obviously does not allow a public servant to develop and deploy long (or even short) term legislative plans. The only thing that matters to such candidate is to recoup the campaign \\"investment\\" made and to exert maximum political \\"leverage\\" for personal profit. * Recently, due to the personal financial success showed by the \\"2+2\\", some PRD members are proposing a \\"1+1+1+1\\" alternative, which could allow more \\"compa√±eros\\" to savor the good life a public office can bring.

His interests lie in the scientific and evolutionary as well as ethical, social and political implications of today's revolutions in the life sciences and in information technology and computers. Life, written works, and business career =Education= He received an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1987, where he was a Baker Scholar and won the Freund-Porter Entrepreneurship award. Stock completed a doctorate in biophysics from Johns Hopkins University in 1977, where he received a BS and MS in 1971.UCLA Website: Gregory Stock =Biotechnology and its impact on society= He has written extensively on the implications for society, medicine and business of the human genome project and associated developments in molecular genetics and bioinformatics. The Storefront Genome,The Storefront Genome the symposium he convened in January 2003 to consider the broad challenges that cheap, easy access to our genetic constitutions drew wide media attention, and his 1998 look at the possibilities of manipulating the genetics of human embryos, the first major public discussion of this issue among distinguished scientists, opened a global debate on this then taboo topic. =Biotech entrepreneur= Stock was the CEO of Signum Biosciences.Signum Biosciences Signum Biosciences is a private biotechnology company dedicated to developing small-molecule therapeutics derived from its Signal Transduction Modulation (STM) platform to modulate signal transduction imbalances. Through research on protein networks that control biological systems, Signum is developing therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, diabetes, asthma and certain skin conditions.

He makes regular appearances on television and radio, and has appeared on CNN, PBS, NPR and the BBC in shows including Talk of the Nation, Charlie Rose,Gregory Stock on Charlie Rose Oprah Winfrey, Biotech Nation and Larry King. Public policy and activities Stock was an early force in considering the implications of human germline engineering and human enhancement. Through the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society, which he founded at the UCLA School of Medicine, he organized an influential 1998 conference at UCLA: \\"Engineering the Human Germline,\\" which included a panel of James Watson, French Anderson, Lee Hood and other major figures in the life sciences. The event, which attracted considerable media attention and opened up broad debate on what was then a largely taboo topic, was covered on the front page of the New York Times.Gina Kolata for the New York Times. March 21, 1998 Scientists Brace for Changes In Path of Human Evolution Through another seminal UCLA conference, Milestones on Aging, he organized, Stock helped legitimize research to significantly extend human longevity.Alliance for Aging Research The event led to a follow conference he co-hosted at UC Berkeley with Bruce Ames and Aubrey de Grey, who went on to found the Methuselah Foundation, an organization that has aggressively promoted research on life extension. The activity of the MTS Program was also critical in establishing UCLA‚Äôs Center on Society and Genetics, which actively explores broad policy issues in the genomics arena. Stock is now primarily engaged in the development of new therapeutics at Signum Biosciences, a biotech company he co-founded in 2003, but he remains active in the policy arena through UCLA's MTS Program, which he still directs, and the BioAgenda Institute, which he is the associate director of, and through various public appearances and debates.

Carberry is a left-handed opening batsman who bowls occasional right-arm off breaks. Carberry began his career at Surrey, during which time he also played for the Surrey Cricket Board. He played for Surrey from 2001 to 2002, before joining Kent. He played for Kent from 2003 to 2005, before becoming frustrated with his opportunities there. He left Kent at the close of the 2005 season, joined Hampshire for the 2006. Increasingly impressive performances for Hampshire led to international recognition, first with the England Lions, before making his Test debut against Bangladesh on England's 2009‚Äì10 tour. In July 2016 Carberry was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour. Early life Carberry, who was born in Croydon on 29 September 1980, is of Guyanese and Barbadian descent.The St Kitts-Nevis Observer,\\"WI lose by 10 wickets after Root hundred\\" , 14 May 2013 He was educated at St John Rigby College in West Wickham. Domestic cricket =Surrey= Carberry began playing for the Surrey Seconds in 1998, while the following season he made his List A debut for the Surrey Cricket Board against Norfolk in the 1999 NatWest Trophy. He scored 19 runs in the match, which the Surrey Cricket Board won. He played in the team's following round match against Cheshire, with Carberry being dismissed for 4 runs by Christopher Hall, in a match which ended in victory for Cheshire. He spent two further years in the Surrey Seconds, before making his first-class debut for the county against Leicestershire. He played 6 first-class matches in 2001, scoring 311 runs and scoring his maiden half century, against Glamorgan. He also made his List A debut for Surrey against Leicestershire, with the match following immediately after his first-class debut. The following season he made only one first-class appearance, against Cambridge UCCE, in a season in which Surrey won their 19th County Championship. He did, however, score his maiden first-class century in the match against Cambridge UCCE, making 153 not out. He found more opportunities that season in List A cricket, playing a handful of matches, though without success. However, with opportunities limited at Surrey, Carberry joined Kent for the 2003 season. =Kent= Carberry was signed initially by Kent as a batsman who could stand-in for Rob Key, whose international career was in its infancy, when he was on international duty. His first-class debut for Kent came against Leicestershire in the 2003 County Championship. With Key absent for the majority of the season, Carberry opened the batting in most of the matches he played, making 14 appearances and having a number of different opening partners, ranging from Key, James Tredwell, David Fulton and Greg Blewett. In his 14 first-class matches that season, he scored 824 runs at an average of 35.82, with a high score of 137. He played a handful of List A matches in his first season with Kent; in that format he was used as both a middle-order and opening batsman. This season saw Carberry make his maiden List A half century, a score of 79 against Worcestershire in the 2003 National League. He made his Twenty20 debut in the 2003 season, making 5 appearances in the Twenty20 Cup. The following season, Carberry made 12 first-class appearances, which came with some success. He scored 639 runs at an average of 42.60, with two centuries and a high score of 112. He performed well in that season's tour match against the New Zealanders, scoring 75 runs and sharing a 117-run partnership with Geraint Jones. A regular appearer in List A cricket for Kent that season, he scored 360 runs at an average of 24.00, with a high score of 76. He again featured for Kent in the 2004 Twenty20 Cup, although he performed poorly in that season's competition, scoring 15 runs at an average of just 3.75. He fell out of favour in the County Championship in 2005, playing just a single first-class match, against Bangladesh A. He still managed to maintain his place in the Kent limited-overs side, playing 12 List A matches in 2005, scoring 204 runs at an average of 24.50 with a high score of 63. He performed well in the 2005 Twenty20 Cup, making 7 appearances. He scored 242 runs at an average of 80.66, with a high score of 59 not out. During the 2005 season, Carberry had become increasingly frustrated by figures at Kent; the county gave him permission to talk to other counties. He eventually opted to join Hampshire for the 2006 season. His time at Kent brought him 1510 first-class runs at an average of 37.75, with a high score of 137, and 736 one-day runs at an average of 23.74, with a high score of 79. Later speaking about his overall time and final season at Kent to the Southern Daily Echo in 2010, he said \\"I was pretty close to quitting\\", and how in his opinion \\"they [Kent] messed me about quite a lot for three years.\\" =Hampshire= Having joined Hampshire on a two-year contract, Carberry made his first-class debut for the county against Lancashire in the 2006 County Championship. He followed this up by making his limited-overs debut for the county against Ireland in the Cheltenham & Gloucester at Castle Avenue, Dublin. He firmly established himself in the Hampshire side in 2006, making 15 first-class appearances, in which he scored 938 runs at an average of 36.04, which included two centuries against Warwickshire and Middlesex. Shown faith by then Hampshire captain Shane Warne and coach Paul Terry, Carberry also appeared in 15 List A matches in his first season at the Rose Bowl, scoring 541 runs at an average of 36.06, with a high score of 88. He continued his previous seasons form with Kent, he performed well in the 2006 Twenty20 Cup, scoring 222 runs at an average of 27.75, with a high score of 90 against Middlesex. His performances that season saw him selected for the England A tour to Bangladesh. The 2007 season was to prove even more successful for Carberry, with him scoring 1,067 first-class runs, which came at an average of 50.80, the first time his batting average had gone above 50 for a season. He struck his highest first-class score that season, making 192 not out against Warwickshire. He played 14 List A matches in 2007, scoring 345 runs with a high score of 75 not out. Additionally, he played part in guiding Hampshire to the final of the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy at Lord's, although in the final itself against Durham he was dismissed for 23 runs by Graham Onions, with Hampshire losing by 125 runs. His performances in the 2007 saw Carberry named as the Hampshire Cricket Society Player of the Year, as well as seeing him selected for the England Lions tour of India. He played for the Marylebone Cricket Club in the Champion County match against Sussex at the beginning of the 2008 season, batting once in the match and scoring 8 runs before being dismissed by Ryan Harris. His form dropped in 2008, with him scoring 815 first-class runs at average of 31.34, with a single century score of 108 (although this came for England Lions against the touring New Zealanders). In the 2008 Twenty20 Cup, Carberry had better fortunes, scoring 334 runs at an average of 37.11, with a high score of 58. Michael Carberry celebrates after Hampshire defeated Sussex in the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy final at Lord's 2009 brought further success for Carberry, with him passing 1,000 for the season. In total, he scored 1,251 runs at an average of 69.50, his best season average up to that part of his career. He also recorded his first double century that season, which came against Warwickshire. His total number of runs by August in the County Championship were third overall, behind Marcus Trescothick and Mark Ramprakash. Ten years after first playing List A cricket, Carberry also scored his maiden century in that format, making an unbeaten 121 against Ireland in the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy, with Carberry sharing in a Hampshire record partnership for the 3rd wicket in List A cricket of 260 with Sean Ervine. His performances in limited-overs cricket that season were and remain the best of his career, with 431 runs coming at an average of 53.87, the only time in his career to date his season average has passed this mark. Hampshire reached the final of the 2009 Friends Provident Trophy that season against Sussex, with Carberry scoring 30 runs in Hampshire's chase, before being dismissed by Yasir Arafat. Nonetheless, Hampshire won by 6 wickets to give Carberry his first silverware with the county. His good form continued in that seasons Twenty20 Cup, with Carberry scoring 307 runs at an average of 30.70, with a high score of 62. His rich form led to speculation that he could be called up to the England squad for the deciding 5th Ashes Test as a replacement for the poorly performing Ravi Bopara. In a County Championship match against Nottinghamshire, Carberry had made 86 runs before being forced to retire his innings after being struck by an Andre Adams delivery, which broke his left ring finger, ruling him out for the rest of that season. Despite missing the second half of the season, Carberry was again named as Hampshire Cricket Society Player of the Year. Returning from international duty in the winter, a further strong season followed for Carberry in 2010, in 16 first-class matches that season he scored 1,385 runs at an average of 51.29, with a top score of 164. However, his form in limited- overs cricket was consistent as in previous seasons, with him scoring 346 runs in 12 matches, at an average of 34.60. He did, however, record his second limited-overs century, making 103 against Warwickshire in the Clydesdale Bank 40 at Edgbaston. He also played a key role in Hampshire's 2010 Friends Provident t20 victory, playing 12 matches in the format that season, scoring 205 runs at an average of 20.50, with a high score of 41. On finals day at Hampshire's ground, the Rose Bowl, Carberry scored 17 runs in the semi-final to guide Hampshire to their target of 157 runs against Essex, while in the final itself, he was dismissed for a duck by Somerset's Ben Phillips. Despite this, Hampshire tied with Somerset's score, but won the match on the basis of having lost fewer wickets in doing so. Carberry's health was seriously affected, when in November 2010 he was diagnosed with blood clots on his lungs which ruled him out of travelling to Australia with the England Performance Programme. The blood clots threatened his career, with Carberry only being given the all-clear to resume his cricketing career mid-way through the 2011 season. On 5 August 2011 Carberry hit his career best score of 300 not out in a County Championship match against Yorkshire. Not only did he make his highest score, but during his innings a number of records fell. Carberry and Neil McKenzie set a new Hampshire record for their 3rd wicket in first-class cricket, setting a partnership of 523 runs to surpass the previous best set by George Brown and Phil Mead in 1927. The partnership with McKenzie was also the highest for any wicket for Hampshire, surpassing the 411 set by Robert Poore and Teddy Wynyard in 1899. Their partnership was the 11th time in first-class cricket that a partnership has passed 500 runs; it currently ranks 9th on the all time list. On 7 August 2013 Carberry hit his first T20 century as he reached 100 (not out) against Lancashire in the 2013 Friends Life Quarter Final.Hampshire v Lancashire Scorecard. Bbc.co.uk (7 August 2013). Retrieved on 21 September 2016. =Leicestershire= Following a brief loan spell shortly before the close of the 2017 season, he has joined Leicestershire permanently for the 2018 season. He was appointed captain in October 2017 succeeding Mark Cosgrove. In May 2018, however, he was relieved of the captaincy following a review by the head coach. Leicestershire announced that Carberry was leaving the club on 17 October 2018. International career Abdur Razzak, who dismissed Carberry in the 2nd innings of his first Test match Carberry had represented England from U-15 level, he later made his debut for England U-19s against New Zealand U-19s in a Youth Test match in February 1999. He went on to play for England U-19s at the 2000 Under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka. He played a total of 6 Youth Test matches and 12 Youth One Day Internationals. His next international honours came after his move to Hampshire, which had revitalised what was a stuttering career. Following a good debut 2006 season for Hampshire, Carberry was selected for the England A tour to Bangladesh in 2007, in which he played 2 first-class matches against Bangladesh A. The tour also included 2 List A matches against the same opposition. Further matches for England A, by then renamed the England Lions, came in early 2008 when the Lions toured India. He played in 2 Duleep Trophy matches on the tour, making 91 in his first innings of the tour against Central Zone. He also played a single first-class match for the Lions against the touring New Zealanders on their 2008 tour of England, scoring 41 in the first innings, before being dismissed by Iain O'Brien, while in the second- innings he scored 100 not out. In August 2009, he was once again called up to the England Lions team to play Australia in a two day match at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury. Carberry was called into the England Performance Squad for their tour to South Africa in late 2009. In his first game back since breaking his finger playing for Hampshire, Carberry made exactly 100 against Gauteng. Despite being a 4 day match, it was not rated as first-class. With the England team also touring South Africa at this time, Carberry was called up to the England squad as cover for Paul Collingwood, for the 3rd Test against South Africa. Carberry instead acted as 12th man in the 3rd and 4th Tests. He later played for the England Lions in the United Arab Emirates. He played a single List A match against Pakistan A at the DSC Cricket Stadium, in which he was dismissed for a duck by Abdur Rehman. On the same tour, he also played a Twenty20 match against England, scoring 8 runs before being dismissed by Ryan Sidebottom. Carberry was retained in the England Test squad for the 2009‚Äì10 tour of Bangladesh, with England choosing to rest captain and opener Andrew Strauss, with fellow opener Alastair Cook taking over the captaincy. Carberry was selected for the opening Test at the Zohur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong. He opened the batting with Cook, making 30 in the first-innings in an opening stand worth 72, before Carberry fell leg before to Mahmudullah. He made 34 in the second-innings, before being dismissed by Abdur Razzak, with England winning the match by 181 runs. He demonstrated his highly rated fielding by initiating the run out of Naeem Islam in the Bangladesh first- innings. Carberry was called up in summer 2013 to the England squads for both the T20 and ODI series' against Australia. On 14 September he took his first catch ‚Äì a one-handed catch to dismiss Mathew Wade ‚Äì and soon after hit his maiden England fifty on his way to 63 in his fourth match. =2013‚Äì14 Ashes Tour= It was announced on 23 September 2013 that Carberry would be part of the England touring squad for the 2013‚Äì14 Ashes series. On 21 November 2013 he made his England Ashes debut in the first match in Brisbane. He opened the innings with skipper Cook on the second day, and top-scored with 40 runs in a generally composed innings. In the second Test, in Adelaide, Carberry scored 60, his maiden Test half-century. Even though the remainder of the tour was frustrating for Carberry, as he was unable to convert a number of good starts into significant scores, he did finish the Ashes series with the third highest English batting average, above the likes of Root, Bell and Cook.

This species is the smallest \\"true quail\\", ranging in the wild from southeastern Asia to Oceania with 10 different subspecies. A failed attempt was made to introduce this species to New Zealand by the Otago Acclimatisation Society in the late 1890s. It is quite common in aviculture worldwide, where it is sometimes misleadingly known as the \\"button quail\\", which is the name of an only very distantly related family of birds, the buttonquails. Description The male king quail comes in many colors, including blue, brown, silver, maroon, dark brown & almost black. They have orange feet which are hard and able to withstand a continuous life on the ground like many other game birds. The female is similar to the male but cannot come in shades of blue. They can live up to 13 years in captivity but only 3-6 on average. In the wild they may live only 1.5 years. The eggs of king quail are a light, creamy-brown colour and slightly pointed at the 'top'; roughly ovular in shape. Taxonomy There are six subspecies recognized: * E. c. chinensis (Linnaeus, 1766): Found from India and Sri Lanka to Malaya, Indochina, southeastern China and Taiwan * Nicobar blue-breasted quail (E. c. trinkutensis Richmond, 1902): Found on Andaman and Nicobar Islands * E. c. lineata (Scopoli, 1786): Found in the Philippines, Borneo, Lesser Sundas, Sulawesi and Sula Islands * E. c. lepida Hartlaub, 1879: Found in the Bismarck Archipelago * E. c. australis Gould, 1865: Found in eastern Australia * E. c. colletti Mathews, 1912: Found in northern Australia Reproduction King quail eggs and 10 day old chick Egg of Excalfactoria chinensis - MHNT The males will fight for the right to mate with the females. The winner will then breed every female. Females can then develop and lay an egg within one to two days of being bred. They will either build a nest or lay anywhere on the ground. Females usually only go broody when they have collected an ideal clutch size. Clutch size varies anywhere from 5 to 13 eggs. Before incubation starts all the eggs composing the clutch will be laid. In captivity, the ideal number of eggs in a clutch is 6 to 8. The chicks hatch after about 16 days. Conservation status =Australia= King quail are not listed as threatened on the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. State of Victoria, Australia This species is listed as threatened on the Victorian Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988).Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria Under this Act, an Action Statement for the recovery and future management of this species has not been prepared.Department of Sustainability and Environment, Victoria On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as endangered. Aviculture This quail has been very popular to keep and breed for many years; numerous mutations have been developed. They are quite hardy once they have adjusted to their surroundings and will keep the bottom of an aviary spotless. A great advantage of these quails is that they will live exclusively on the ground, & will not interfere with other birds.Don Harper, Pet Birds for the Home & Garden; Salamander Press The cost of purchasing and maintaining them is very little. They have been known to become hand-tame. They may be housed in pairs to quartets in a planted aviary, kept singly in bird cages, or in colonies in large flights. Males may compete, as may females. Suspension cages do not work well for this species of quail because of their smaller feet; a much finer size floor wire would need to be employed.JJ Holland, Observations of Quail, 2013 Females will lay an egg a day if kept on the proper diet. Nesting sites can be as spartan as a quiet corner or a depression in the ground against a wall. Preferably, a clump of long grass, tea tree branches, or pile of loose herbage should be provided. Often a hen will lay eggs on the aviary floor without the use of a nest. This is a sign that the birds are not content with the existing facilities and the provision of a sheltered nest site may result in a nest being built. The cock usually selects the nest site.A Guide to Pigeons, Doves & Quail, 1995. Danny Brown B.Sc. (Hons) The nest is a simple scrape in the ground, lined with grasses and is built by the hen with some assistance from the cock. The eggs measuring 25 x 19mm are variable in colour form the palest of browns to dark olive and peppered with fine black spots. Clutch size varies from 4-13, but occasionally a hen will be found incubating upwards of 20 eggs. It is usually a combined clutch from a number of hens and due to the difficulties of turning and covering a clutch of that size, hatchability is often poor. It may be better to remove some of the eggs and artificially incubate them or foster them. The species usually breed year round; incubation times are from 18‚Äì23 days before chicks hatch. The hen bird will care for the chicks until around 4 weeks of age where they should be separated from parent birds into a separate aviary. = Hybrids and mutations = Hybrids of king quail and brown quail are known. Silvers and cinnamon are the most common colour varieties. Pied, albino, and charcoals are becoming more common. Mutations can be combined. Occasional cock-feathered hens appear: This is not a mutation as such, but one of a few conditions which has affected normal hormonal balances. It is most often seen when a hen has an ovarian cyst, or growth. They usually stop laying eggs, but can live for a number of years happily just looking like a male. In one case a silver hen was kept for many years by herself, moulted into cock plumage, and laid only extremely pale green shelled eggs for a few seasons before passing of old age. Diet In the wild, the diet of king quails consists of small bugs, seed and various grasses that are available at the time. In aviculture, all birds should be fed a variety of seeds as well as a healthy range of fruit and vegetables. During breeding, hens should be fed calcium-rich food sources such as shell grit to prevent egg binding. Newly hatched chicks should be fed high protein chick crumb mixed in with a little water. Other sources of protein include mealworms and various bugs.

Kaiwara is a popular place to visit, as it is very close to Bangalore (about 65 km away), the capital of Karnataka. Free boarding (prasada) and well-maintained, low- cost accommodation is available at the ashram. Chintamani Town is the nearest Taluk Centre and a business hub of this part of Karnataka. Demographics As of the 2001 Indian census, Kaiwara's population was 5,488, of which 2,792 were male and 2,696 female. Saint Narayanappa Kaiwara is famous for Saint Narayanappa, Sri Yogi Nareyana (1730-1840 AD), popularly known as Kaiwara Narayana Thata ‡≤®‡≤æ‡≤∞‡≤æ‡≤Ø‡≤£ ‡≤§‡≤æ‡≤§ in Kannada and Narayana Thatayya in Telugu, a bilingual poet who meditated in a cave in Kaiwara. Narayanappa prophesied and composed poems in praise of Amara Narayanaswamy, the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, in both Kannada and Telugu. His works include \\"Amaranarayana Shathaka\\", \\"Kaalagnana\\",Aravind V.S., \\"In the caves of Kaiwara, Kailasagiri\\", Deccan Herald, June 8, 2009. and \\"Bramanandpuri Shatakka\\", in which he explains all the nuances of yoga. The Keertanas are comparable to famous Keertanakaras of Karnataka such as Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa. Thatayya also appears to have been influenced by Vemana Kavi and Veera Bramhendra Swamy of present-day Andhra Pradesh, and Sarvajna of present-day Karnataka. In one of his poems, half of each line is in Kannada, and the other half in Telugu. This poem has been composed in carnatic classical music style and sung by Sri Balamurali Krishna, a prominent Indian musician. Composer Mahesh Mahadev has tuned and composed music for his 25 poems and given it the shape of a song using popular Hindustani and Carnatic ragas. Dr.S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, Priyadarshini and many other popular singers have sung these songs. Mahesh Mahadev‚Äôs Dhimi Dhimi song in Rag Brindavan Sarang, Kandenu Sri Ranganathana in Raga Chakravaka Grahabedam , Narudu Gurudani in Hindola Raga, Sri Nareyana Namamrutha Rasa in Hamir Kalyani, Nanenu Ballenu In Darbari Kanada Raga Malike, Rama Rama Mukunda Madhava in Raga Saramati were become more popular. The Swami Narayana Ashram in Kaivara is dedicated to him and has become a pilgrimage and a tourist destination. The cave, the Vaikunta (temple) by the side of the cave, Amara Narayanaswamy temple, and the hillock on which Bheema is supposed to have killed the Bakasura are also notable sites in Kaivara. The town was known as Ekachakrapura in Dvapara Yuga. The Pandavas of India's greatest epic Mahabharata lived here during their vanavasa (period spent in the forest). Bheema, the brother of Dharmaraja, has established a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva (Bheemalingeswara temple). A park that is maintained by the forest department of Karnataka is located nearby. Points of interest Amaranarayana Swamy Temple: The temple of Sri Venkateshwara was established in the form of Amaranarayana, god of eternal life. It is said to have direct connection between the temple of Tirupathi, where Sri Tatayya worshiped both Amaranarayana and Tirupathi Thimmappa at the same time. Once, there was a fire near Thimmappa's foot at Thirupathi, and it was Tatayya who extinguished the fire. The charm of Amaranarayana overtakes that of Thimmappa. Also as per a legend the Amaranarayana idol here was installed by Lord Indra. The story is associated with Indra killing Vritrasura in Satya Yuga. Indra installed Deities of Lord Narayana in five places ‚Äì Sri Amara Narayana in Kaiwara, Sri Desh Narayana in Budigere, Sri Veera Narayana in Yadokodi, Sri Adi Narayana in Yallodi and Sri Lakshmi Narayana in Gadag.http://www.tirthayatra.org/kaiwara/ During the period of Lord Rama's exile, he stayed in this area. Thus there is a small sculptor of Lord Rama accompanied by Seeta Devi and Lord Lakshmana in this temple. [Aranya Rama Temple or Rameshwara swami temple is located very near to the Amaranarayana temple] Yoginarayana Mutt: Ashram dedicated to the Thatayya where he was buried alive as a ritual of Jeevasamadhi. Vasavi Kanyakaparameshwari temple: The Goddess Vasavi is the sacred god of Vaishyas community. This is a newly built temple. We can also see idols of Lord Ranganatha Swamy and Lord Shiva and Parvathi Devi here. There is a Venugopala swami temple close to this temple. Bheemalingeshwara Temple: During Agnathavaasa of Pandava, they stayed in Kaiwara (then Ekachakrapura) for one year. During their stay, Bheema fought the demon Bakasura, put the demon into a cave and blocked it with a huge rock. The rock came to be called Bakasurana Bande (Bakasura's Rock). After taking a life, Bheema was burdened with Bramhahatyadosha (sin of killing). To rid himself of it, Bheema established a Shivalinga (a representation of the Hindu deity Shiva used for worship in temples), followed by his brothers and mother. Later temples were built and came to be known as Bheemalingeshwara temple. Laxmana Theertha: Located on top of the hill in front of Chamundeshwari temple, Laxmana Theertha dates back to the period of Treta Yuga. While in exile, Rama, Seetha and Laxmana were said to have gone there. Laxmana used an arrow to make a hole in the rock to get water for Seetha, who was extremely thirsty. Yoganarasimha swamy Temple, Vaikunta and Thatayya Cave:Yoganarasimha swamy Temple is at a distance of about one kilometer from the Mutt on a small hill called Vaikunta. There is a cave here in which Thatayya meditated and attained the supreme spiritual enlightenment. Thatayya did all his meditation in a cave which is 3 km from Kaiwara and they call it as Gavi. During his period of meditation, a tiger and a leopard used to guard him and few years later he was enlightened. Hilltop: A place in which the footprints of Bheema and Bakasura's fighting are preserved. At the pinnacle of the hill is a stone where Bheema used to meditate daily. Prints of his one-foot and knee have been seen in this location. A National park and a small zoo is maintained by the department of forestry with a few animals and birds. This place is around Vaikunta. Kailasagiri cave temples of Lord Shiva and Ambaji Durga cave temple on a rock hill top are located about 7 km from Kaiwara, which are being restored.http://www.deccanherald.com/content/6954/snippets.html The magnitude of the cave and the efforts made to construct the temple are impressive. At the foothills of the Kailasagiri/Ambajidurga for the benefit of devotees free Prasadam distribution centre is arranged. Other places of interest near Kaiwara include Temple of Lord Venkateswara in Alamgiri.

For call-in talk shows, screeners determine the air quality of the call (good connection or not) and if the caller's comments will further the topic or add a new point. Their job is to put the best calls on the air and filter out the callers that don't have anything worthwhile to add to the conversation. They also try to engage callers by acting as a \\"warm up\\" act for the host. Call screeners also typically provide a summary of pertinent information for the host or hosts to provide context for on air interaction, such as the caller's name, age, gender, location and a precis of what they intend to talk about. During breaking news events, screeners are responsible for verifying the caller's identity, to ensure that correct information will be presented to the news anchor. A failure here can allow an embarrassing on-air prank call through.

It was founded in 1854 by Servant of God Jules Chevalier (1824‚Äì1907) at Issoudun, France, in the Diocese of Bourges. Jules Chevalier, the founder of the Chevalier Family, had a vision of a new world emerging and he wanted to make known the Gospel message of God's love and care for all men and women and to evoke a response in every human heart. He especially valued love, concern, compassion, understanding, respect and acceptance of every individual. His vision was based on the words of Jesus: > I give you a new commandment, love one another. Just as I have loved you, > you also must love one another. By this love you have for one another, > everyone will know that you are my disciples. [John 13:34 ff] The motto of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart is: May the Sacred Heart of Jesus be loved everywhere!Catholic Encyclopedia 1913: MSC of Jesus The priests, deacons and brothers of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart are known as MSCs (from the Latin, Missionarii Sacratissimi Cordis). As with most religious congregations in the Catholic Church there is significant involvement on the part of the laity, who may also serve on the missions. The international headquarters is in Rome with numerous communities throughout the world.Australian Province: MSC worldwide  History  Jules Chevalier The origin of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart is closely connected with the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The means to lay their foundation being the outcome of special prayers addressed to the Mother of God during the nine days preceding event of 8 December 1854. The founder had pledged himself to honour the Blessed Virgin in a special manner. Chevalier fulfilled his promise the following year by erecting a shrine dedicated to the honour of Mary under the title of \\"Our Lady of the Sacred Heart \\".Catholic Encyclopedia 1913: Missionaries of the Sacred Heart In 1864 he founded the Archconfraternity of the Sacred Heart and sought to have it established in every parish as a means to develop devotion to, and appreciation of, the love that Christ bears all people. In 1867, the Congregation opened its first school in Chezal-Beno√Æt in the Centre Region of France.https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13306a.htm In September 1881, at the request of Pope Leo XIII the Congregation sent its first missionaries overseas. From Barcelona three missionaries set out for Papua New Guinea and founded the first overseas mission in 1882 near Rabaul on the island of New Britain. Between 1927 and 1937 Rev Charles Gouffe, Rev Patrick Long, Rev John Tuomey, Rev William Tynan, Rev William Barrow, Rev Patrick Lennane and Rev Michael Nealon served the parish of St Anne's RC Church at Ugthorpe, North Yorkshire. In Papua, the order began a mission at Yule Island in 1885. Bishop Alain de Boismenu, Vicar Apostolic of Papua from 1908 to 1945, established missionary and charitable activities based on the mission at Yule Island. In 1885, a supply base for the Papua New Guinea mission was founded in Sydney, Australia and the Australian Province was established in 1905.Australian Province: About us The Australian province was active in missionary work to Australian Aborigines and published the long-running magazine of Catholic culture Annals Australasia. The Congregation continued to grow and established provinces in the Netherlands (1894), the United States (1939), Spain (1946), Ireland (1952), Indonesia (1971) and the Dominican Republic (1986).MSC 150 Anniversary Book, p. 24-152  Vows  As members of a religious congregation, Missionaries of the Sacred Heart embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity means more than abstaining from sexual activity and its purpose is to make the religious totally available for service; it is also a sign that only God can completely fill the human heart. For a member of a religious congregation, obedience is not slavishly doing what one is told by the superior but being attentive to God‚Äôs will by prayerfully listening to the voice of the person in charge. Ultimately, these vows are lived out within a community and bolstered by a relationship with God. Consequently: > Becoming a Missionary of the Sacred Heart doesn‚Äôt happen over night. Plenty > of time and help is given to preparing us for a way of life that is > certainly not ordinary!

All this happens before any commitment is made.British- > Irish Province: Training and Formation The actual process of discernment and formation differs slightly with each province, but the overall scheme is the same.  Religious formation  = Discernment = Young adults aged 18 and over, meet regularly to share their experiences of God and what He may be calling them to become. During this time the members of the Congregation share what it is like to be a priest, religious brother or sister. The young people are also strongly encouraged to attend Mass as often as possible and to regularly spend time in prayer in order to better discern their vocation. = Live in experience = In the US this is normally a series of weekends or whole week experiences, designed to help young men who are interested in religious life.US Province website: Discernment Whilst on these live-in experiences, young people have the opportunity to live in community, to share their faith more deeply and to share with those who are missionaries, both lay and ordained. In other provinces, this experience is full-time e.g. in the United Kingdom where during this stage a candidate may take classes in philosophy or theology.British Province: Training and Formation This is especially so if the person does not possess a university degree. In the Philippines Province, candidates (called ‚ÄòFormands‚Äô) who have graduated from high school go to live the MSA Formation Centre in Cebu from where they take university classes, a process which lasts some five years. The Filipinos refer to this as the Collegiate.Philippines Province: Join us (Stages of Formation) =Aspirancy, postulancy, pre-novitiate= It is normal for a person to have a degree before entering this year. In the US the aspirant goes to live full-time in an MSC formation house with peers and under the guidance of a formation director. This period devoted to learning more deeply about what it means to follow Christ as a future member of the Congregation. In provinces with few postulants the aspirant will normally live in one of the various communities. In the Philippines there are enough postulants to have a designated house, situated in Valenzuela. Philippine Province: Postulancy = Novitiate = Once the candidate knows the MSC way of life, he is admitted into the novitiate preparing himself to take the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then ‚Äú...that the novices better understand their divine vocation, and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.‚ÄùCode of Canon Law 646 Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth. A simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation for ‚ÄúBy religious profession, members assume the observance of the three evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the rights and duties defined by law.‚ÄùCode of Canon Law 654 =Post novitiate= Post novitiate is where the newly professed religious deepens his commitment as a member of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart and decides whether or not to make a lifelong commitment to vowed life. During this period it is normal to pursue a degree in theology; in the US this would be done at Catholic Theological Union, in the Philippines at the MSC‚Äôs own theologate in Quezon City, Manila and in the UK at Heythrop College. At the end of this period of formation, which, according to Canon Law, may last no more than six yearsCode of Canon Law 655 perpetual profession (final vows) is made and ordination to the diaconate and presbyterate follows for those called to Holy Orders.  Spirit and charism  The Constitutions of the Congregation state: > The spirit of our Congregation is made of love and kindness, humility and > simplicity; but above all, it is a spirit of love for justice and concern > for the welfare of all, specially the poorest ones.US Province: About us For the Congregation the motto ‚ÄòMay the Sacred Heart of Jesus be everywhere loved‚Äô goes beyond placing statues of the Sacred Heart in churches, First Friday devotions and novenas, important as they are. It means believing that Christ‚Äôs love for His people is empowering, healing, all-embracing, liberating and challenging.Philippines Province: Spirituality In practical terms, this means that the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart: * Are committed to spreading the Gospel of Christ. * Respond to the needs of all, particularly those who are poor, isolated or marginalised. * Promote human development and compassion, build and model healthy relationships in the light of Catholic social teachings. * Encourage, foster and sustain lay leadership in the Church and involvement in their missions and spirituality. This means that the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart are engaged in a variety of ministries as they respond to the \\"signs of the times\\", ever seeking ways in which to bring people to a deeper appreciation of the love that God has for his children, and to do so in \\"concrete circumstances\\".British-Irish Province: Who we are  Missions and ministries  * Australia: Education, parishes, chaplaincies, retreats, justice and peace.Australian Province: Mission + Ministry * Britain and Ireland: Parishes, schools, retreats, hospital chaplaincy, counselling, migrants and refugees.

The book covers James' earliest years and discusses his intellectually active family, his intermittent schooling, and his first trips to Europe. Summary and themes This memoir tells of a precocious boy who loved the sights and sounds of his childhood but felt reticent about full participation in life. The note is sounded from the first chapters, as James recounts the limitations‚Äîand rewards‚Äîof the child he was: \\"For there was the very pattern and measure of all he was to demand: just to be somewhere‚Äîalmost anywhere would do‚Äîand somehow receive an impression or an accession, feel a relation or a vibration. He was to go without many things, ever so many‚Äîas all people do in whom contemplation takes so much the place of action; but everywhere...he was to enjoy more than anything the so far from showy practice of wondering and dawdling and gaping: he was really, I think, much to profit by it.\\" James clearly suffered from a sense of his inferiority in the \\"showy\\", active parts of life. His older brother William always seemed superior in ability; his classmates scorned his hopelessness at math and science; even at a party he felt too embarrassed to join in the dancing. But he still observed and fantasized about all his family and his surroundings had to offer. When a cousin of his was told \\"don't make a scene,\\" he suddenly realized that scenes could be made by telling a story or inventing a play. He went often to the theater and fell forever under its spell. His family met William Thackeray and Charles Dickens on their American tours, and James even remembered Thackeray mock-scolding his sister Alice for her crinoline dress: \\"Crinoline? I was suspecting it! So young and so depraved!\\" In fact, for all his surface diffidence, James harbored almost Napoleonic dreams of glory as an artist. Near the close of A Small Boy and Others he tells how, in much later years, he dreamed of routing a monstrous attacker and chasing him away through the halls of the Louvre, which he had seen as a child. The small boy, as hesitant and uncertain as he might seem, would triumph over his fears and develop his superb aptitude for narrative fiction. Critical evaluation Although couched in the novelist's densest prose‚Äî\\"late late James,\\" as one critic put itHenry James: Autobiography edited and introduction by F.W. Dupee (New York: Criterion Books 1956), xiv.‚ÄîA Small Boy and Others has enjoyed mostly favorable commentary. Critics have appreciated how James speaks honestly about his childhood hesitancies and feelings of inadequacy. James narrates many stories of his family life and his desultory, sometimes erratic education with welcome humor and unfailing grace.

Early life He was born on December 4, 1867 in Bourbon County, Kentucky to Benjamin F. Rogers and Elizabeth H. (n√©e Jameson) Rogers. After his father's unexpected death, his mother remarried to Judge Richard Reid. His maternal grandfather was U.S. Representative from Missouri, John Jameson. Rogers graduated in 1886 from Princeton University before studying law at the University of Virginia. Career He began his career in New York City with Guthrie, Cravath, & Henderson, before serving as the general counsel to both the Isthmian Canal Commission and later the Panama Railroad Company. He subsequently was counsel to the Metropolitan Street Railway and several of its successor companies. On June 20, 1906, Rogers was appointed as general counsel to the Isthmian Canal Commission, to replace outgoing Governor Charles Edward Magoon. In November of that year, President Theodore Roosevelt temporarily abolished the office of Governor of the Panama Canal Zone, to give greater autonomy to the chief engineer of the canal project. This order placed all of the duties of the Governor on the general counsel, in effect making Rogers the Governor in all but title (though he was not required to govern from the Canal Zone itself and he remained in Washington, D.C.). Personal life On June 25, 1891, Rogers was married to Sarah Eunice Tomlin (1867‚Äì1945) in Madison, Tennessee. They were the parents of one daughter: * Elizabeth Reid Rogers (1893‚Äì1957), who married into the German nobility and the House of Hesse, by marrying Prince Christian of Hesse-Philippsthal-Barchfeld, a son of Prince William, in 1915 and being titled Baroness von Barchfeld. He died on November 10, 1949 at the University Club in New York City. He was buried at the Machpelah Cemetery in Mount Sterling, Kentucky. =Descendants= Through his daughter Elizabeth, he was a grandfather of four: Elisabeth Auguste (1915‚Äì2003), Richard Christian (1917‚Äì1985), Waldemar (1919‚Äì2002) and Marie Louise Olga (1921‚Äì1999), who were permitted to title themselves Prinz/Prinzessin von Hessen (Prince/Princess of Hesse).

Tahmina ( , , various other transcriptions like Tahmeena, Tehmina, Tahmineh, Tahmina) is a female character in the story Rostam and Sohrab, part of the 10th-century Persian epic of Shahnameh. Her name is mentioned as the wife of Rostam and as the daughter of Samanganshah, the sovereign of Samangan. References in the Shahnameh In the Shahnameh, Rostam and Sohrab's story begins when Rostam loses his horse, Rakhsh. Grieved and angry, Rostam reaches at Samangan, where he was greeted by the king, who offered him the assurance that Rakhsh was too well known for his hiding place not to be soon discovered. The king of Samangan invites Rostam to stay for the night, therefore, he provides a lodging for the hero in his own palace. That night, Tahmina comes to Rostam's bedchambers and declares her love for him. The scene is so described in the Shahnama: : At sight of her Rostam the lion heart was cast into amazement. : Calling down the Creator's blessing on her, said, 'What is your name? What seek you in the darkness of the night and what do you desire? : She answered, ' l am Tahmina. : You would say that I am rent in twain with longing. : I am daughter of the king of Samangan and I come of the stock of lions and leopards. : On earth I have no peer among persons of royal birth; indeed beneath the dome of heaven there rarely exists anyone like me. : Outside the veil no one has ever beheld me, nor has anyone ever heard my voice. : But of you I have heard from all men as a legend and have been told histories of you in plenty; that you fear no Div, lion, leopard or serpent, and how bold you are in action. : I have craved for your shoulders and arms and breast. : Now God has vouchsafed your presence in this City. : If you desire me, I yield myself to you, and neither bird nor fish will set eyes on me hereafter. : One thing is sure, that I have so devoted myself to you as to have killed wisdom in favour of love. :(Shahnama, Sohrab 8:2) Rostam commands that a virtuous priest should come and crave her for him from her father. After their marriage, Rostam sleeps with Tahminah and later gives her a jewel from the band around his arm, saying: : If a daughter is granted to you by fate, take and bind it on her tresses to secure good fortune and as a talisman to brighten the world. : But if the stars send a son, bind it upon his arm in token of his father. : He will attain the stature of Sam son of Nariman, and he will have the valour and spirit of noble men. : He will bring down the eagle in swift flight out of the clouds, and the sun will not shine on him with overpowering heat. ' Upon finding his horse, Rostam leaves the city of Samangan and returns to Iran. After nine months, Tahmina bears Rostam a son, Sohrab. In the final Iran-Turan battle, when Rostam kills Sohrab, he discovers the jewel, realizing that Sohrab is his son. Tahmina's name appears once again in the Shahnama when she receives the tidings of her son's death. She is recorded to have cried: : To whom shall I clasp upon my bosom now? : Who is there that will rid me of my grief? : Whom shall I call upon to take thy place? : To whom impart my pain and misery? : Woe for his soul and body, eye and lustre, That dwell in dust instead of hall and garden! : (Shahnama/ Sohrab 18:29:11) Sources and references * Abolqasem Ferdowsi, Dick Davis trans.

The three main bridges, Herc√≠lio Luz Bridge (was closed since 1991, reopened in December 2019), Colombo Salles Bridge and Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge, span a 500-meter wide and 28-meter deep channel which delimits the north and south bays of the island. One of the continental neighborhoods in Florian√≥polis is named after this strait. Urban areas Satellite view of Ilha de Santa Catarina. Santa Catarina Island is home to the state capital, Florian√≥polis, and is connected to the mainland by three bridges, two of which are currently in operation. The island also contains numerous beach resorts, including: Jurer√™ Internacional, Santinho, Canasvieiras and Cachoeira do Bom Jesus. A large part of the city of Florian√≥polis lies within the borders of the island. The downtown area lies in the mid-west, but many other neighborhoods and districts are spread over the island. One notable neighborhood is Trindade, where the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) is located. In the north, the communities of Ingleses, Canasvieiras and Jurer√™ can be found, and those of Vargem Grande and Vargem Pequena are in the far north. The neighborhoods Santo Ant√¥nio de Lisboa, Cacup√©, Sambaqui, Barra do Sambaqui, Rio Vermelho and Praia da Daniela are located in the northwest.

Military career =Civil War= Davis was born in the rural town of Thompson, Connecticut. He first entered the Army during the American Civil War, joining the 11th Connecticut Infantry Regiment in November 1861 as a Company Quartermaster Sergeant (the same position that his grandfather served in during the American Revolution). During the course of the war, he fought in several major battles, including Antietam, and worked his way up in rank in the volunteer force to the rank of Major. He was mustered out in April 1866. =After the war= In January 1867, Davis joined the 14th Infantry Regiment. As a captain, Davis was an assistant engineer on the construction project to build the Washington Monument, and was among the featured guests at the dedication ceremony in 1885. Afterwards, Davis became vice-president of the construction company that was to build the Nicaragua Canal and chairman of the international board of consulting engineers on the Panama Canal. In 1895, he filled on opening on the Antietam Battlefield Board that helped oversee the preservation and monumentation of that historic place, culminating in the establishment of the Antietam National Battlefield.

Starting in 1951, the Soviet Union used Karachay as a dumping site for radioactive waste from Mayak, the nearby nuclear waste storage and reprocessing facility, located near the town of Ozyorsk (then called Chelyabinsk-40). Today the lake is completely infilled, acting as \\"a near-surface permanent and dry nuclear waste storage facility.\\" Satellite image/map of Lake Karachay Current status According to a report by the Washington, D.C.-based Worldwatch Institute on nuclear waste, Karachay is the most polluted (open-air) place on Earth from a radiological point of view.Lenssen, \\"Nuclear Waste: The Problem that Won't Go Away\\", Worldwatch Institute, Washington, D.C., 1991: 15. The lake accumulated some 4.44 exabecquerels (EBq) of radioactivity over less than one square mile of water, including 3.6 EBq of caesium-137 and 0.74 EBq of strontium-90. For comparison, the Chernobyl disaster released 0.085 EBq of caesium-137, a much smaller amount and over thousands of square miles. (The total Chernobyl release is estimated between 5 and 12 EBq of radioactivity, however essentially only caesium-134/137 [and to a lesser extent, strontium-90] contribute to land contamination because the rest is too short-lived). The sediment of the lake bed is estimated to be composed almost entirely of high level radioactive waste deposits to a depth of roughly . The radiation level in the region near where radioactive effluent is discharged into the lake was 600 r√∂ntgens per hour (approximately 6 Sv/h) in 1990, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council, sufficient to give a lethal dose to a human within an hour. Radiation levels always decrease over time, as radioactive materials lose energy through decay. High levels of radiation are impossible to maintain, as they lose energy over time by particle emission. , the lake's status is completely infilled, using special concrete blocks, rock, and dirt. It had been completely backfilled in November 2015, then monitored before placing the final layer of rock and dirt. Monitoring data showed \\"clear reduction of the deposition of radionuclides on the surface\\" after 10 months. A decades-long monitoring program for underground water was expected to be implemented shortly after. Background The name karachay means \\"black water\\" or \\"black sea\\" in several Northwestern Turkic languages, including Tatar. Built in total secrecy between 1946 and 1948, the Mayak plant was the first reactor used to create plutonium for the Soviet atomic bomb project. In accordance with Stalinist procedure and supervised by NKVD Chief Lavrenti Beria, it was the utmost priority to produce enough weapons-grade material to match the U.S. nuclear superiority following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Little to no consideration was paid to worker safety or responsible disposal of waste materials, and the reactors all were optimized for plutonium production, producing many tons of contaminated materials and utilizing open-cycle cooling systems which directly contaminated every liter of the thousands of liters of cooling water the reactors used every day. Lake Kyzyltash was the largest natural lake capable of providing cooling water to the reactors; it was rapidly contaminated because of their use of the open-cycle system. Lake Karachay was even closer; however the lake was too small to provide sufficient cooling water. Lake Karachay was then designated a close-by and convenient dumping ground for large quantities of high-level radioactive waste too \\"hot\\" to store in the facility's underground storage vats. The original plan was to use the lake to store highly radioactive material until it could be returned to the Mayak facility's underground concrete storage vats, but this proved impossible due to the lethal levels of radioactivity. The lake was used for this purpose until the Kyshtym Disaster in 1957, in which the underground vats exploded due to a faulty cooling system. This incident caused widespread contamination of the entire Mayak area (as well as a large swath of territory to the northeast). This led to greater caution among the administration, fearing international attention, and caused the dumping grounds to be spread out over a variety of areas (including several lakes and the Techa River, along which many villages lay). In the 1960s, the lake began to dry out; its area dropped from 0.5 km2 in 1951 to 0.15 km2 by the end of 1993. In 1968, following a drought in the region, the wind carried 185 PBq (5 MCi) of radioactive dust away from the dried area of the lake, irradiating half a million people. Between 1978 and 1986, the lake was filled with almost 10,000 hollow concrete blocks to prevent sediments from shifting. Conservation of the affected area continued into the 2000s via the federal target program \\"Nuclear and Radiation Safety in 2008 and for the period up to 2015\\", with the rest of the lake finally being backfilled in November 2015. Conservation work was completed in December 2016 with the final layer of rock and soil being added, effectively making the former lake \\"a near-surface permanent and dry nuclear waste storage facility.\\"  Cultural references  * The lake and its vicinity are featured in James Rollins' Sigma Force novel The Last Oracle. * The album \\"One Hour by the Concrete Lake\\" (1998) by Swedish progressive metal band Pain of Salvation is a concept album based on the contamination of Lake Karachay.

Carlos Hugo was the Carlist pretender to the throne of Spain and sought to change the political direction of the Carlist movement through the Carlist Party, of which he was the official head during the fatal Montejurra Incident. His marriage to Princess Irene of the Netherlands in 1964 caused a constitutional crisis in the Netherlands. Background Carlos Hugo was the son of Xavier, Duke of Parma, and Madeleine de Bourbon-Busset and was baptized Hugues Marie Sixte Robert Louis Jean Georges Beno√Æt Michel. He was a direct male descendant of Louis XIV. On 28 June 1963 he was officially renamed Charles Hugues, by judgment of the court of appeal of la Seine, France. In 1977, his father died, and Carlos Hugo succeeded him claiming the thrones of Parma, Etruria and Spain. He was a French citizen, and from 1980, a naturalized Spanish citizen. He studied in Paris and at the University of Oxford. Carlism Carlism is a Spanish political movement founded in the 19th century which, since the second half of the 20th century, upholds the claim of Carlos Hugo's branch of the House of Bourbon to the Spanish throne. In 1952, Carlos Hugo's father publicly laid claim to the Spanish throne as Javier I, but he was ignored by Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco, who later chose Juan Carlos to be his successor instead. On 5 May 1957 Javier proclaimed Carlos Hugo Prince of Asturias and Duke of San Jaime. In February 1964 Carlos Hugo assumed the title Duke of Madrid. After alienating many Carlists during the mid-1960s by his attempts to approach Franco (on whom the 1947 Law of Succession had conferred the right to select a king to succeed himself as head of state) Carlos Hugo's increasingly leftist politics prompted the prince to embrace Titoist socialism. As Xavier's health declined so too did his appearances as the Carlists' leader: Carlos Hugo's sister, Princess Maria Teresa of Bourbon-Parma, publicly supported her brother's political transition, while his mother and brother, Prince Sixte- Henri, continued to live with his father in France and to adhere to traditional Carlism. Carlos Hugo assumed Carlist leadership in August 1975. In Francoist Spain, the organization of Carlism has been known as the Traditionalist Communion. After Franco's death, also the Carlist movement was badly split, and unable to get wide public attention again. In May 1976, a year after Franco's death, two Carlist sympathizers were shot down by far- right terrorists during the annual Carlist convocation. Among the terrorists were Stefano Delle Chiaie and members of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (Triple A), with logistic support from Francoist elements inside Spanish intelligence agencies and the Civil Guard.\\"Montejurra-76: crimen de Estado sin castigo\\", El Mundo, 6 May 2001CARCEDO, Diego: S√°enz de Santamar√≠a: el general que cambio de bando, This incident became known as the Montejurra massacre.Crimes of Montejurra (translation) . Montejurra-jurramendi.3a2.com. Retrieved on 21 April 2014. In the first democratic elections on 15 June 1977, only one Carlist senator was elected, journalist and writer Fidel Carazo from Soria, who ran as an independent candidate. In the parliamentary elections of 1979, Carlists integrated in the coalition Uni√≥n Nacional, that won a seat in Congress for Madrid; but the elected candidate was Blas Pi√±ar, Francoist leader of Fuerza Nueva. Since then, Carlists have remained extra- parliamentary, obtaining only town council seats. Carlos Hugo abandoned his Carlist claims in 1979 and became a naturalised Spanish citizen as Carlos-Hugo de Borb√≥n-Parma y Borb√≥n, by royal decree of King Juan Carlos. In 1980, he left the political arena, abandoning the new \\"Partido Carlista\\" which he had created. The party would later become a founding member of the United Left coalition. In 2002 Carlos Hugo donated his House's archives to Spain's national historical archives. This decision was opposed by his brother Sixtus. On 28 September 2003 at Arbonne in France, Carlos Hugo re-asserted his Carlist claim.Palabras de S.A.R. el Pr√≠ncipe Don Carlos Hugo de Borb√≥n Parma en al acto de imposici√≥n de cruces de La Orden de la Legitimad Proscrita, celebrado el domingo d√≠a 28 de septiembre de 2003 en Arbonne (Francia).

He announced that he would use the title Count of Montemolin (conde de Montemol√≠n) for himself, and that three of his children would have Carlist titles: Duke of Madrid (duque de Madrid) for his son Carlos, Duke of San Jaime (duque de San Jaime) for his son Jaime, and Duchess of Guernica (duquesa de Gernika) for his daughter Carolina.  Marriage and family  Carlos Hugo and Princess Irene in 1964 Carlos Hugo and Princess Irene in 1978 Carlos Hugo's engagement to Princess Irene of the Netherlands, daughter of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, caused a constitutional crisis in the Netherlands for several reasons. Irene lost her rights of succession to the Dutch throne because the government refused to enact a law permitting the marriage. Her mother could not go to Madrid to talk Irene out of the marriage and of her conversion to Catholicism because the government advised her against it. The issue that prevented the government from making a law permitting the marriage was Carlos's claim to the Spanish throne. The Dutch government saw international political difficulties arising from a possible heir to the Dutch throne holding a controversial claim to the throne of a foreign state. Carlos Hugo and Irene were married on 29 April 1964, in the Borghese Chapel at the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, by Cardinal Paolo Giobbe, the former Apostolic Nuncio to the Netherlands.\\"Carlist Colours Flaunted at Princess's Marriage\\", The Times (30 April 1964): 14.

Markoviƒá is most notable for having served as the last prime minister of Yugoslavia as a one- party socialist state. Early life Markoviƒá, was a Bosnian Croat, born in Konjic, then a part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, presently in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1943 he joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and fought with the Yugoslav Partisans in World War II. He received a degree in electrical engineering from the Electrotechnical Department of the Technical Faculty of the University of Zagreb in 1954. He remained in Zagreb, where he was a director of Rade Konƒçar Industrial Works from 1961 to 1984. Political career =President of Croatia= In 1986 he became president of the Presidency of Socialist Republic of Croatia replacing Ema Derosi-Bjelajac. He held that position until 1988, when he was replaced by Ivo Latin. =Prime Minister of Yugoslavia= He became prime minister in March 1989 following the resignation of Branko Mikuliƒá. After that decision had become public, the U.S. had anticipated cooperation because Markoviƒá was known \\"to favor market- oriented reforms\\"Facts on File, 27 January 1989 ‚Äì the BBC declared that he is \\"Washington's best ally in Yugoslavia\\".Misha Glenny, \\"The Massacre of Yugoslavia,\\" New York Review of Books, 30 January 1992 At the end of the year, Markoviƒá launched a new and ambitious program of unprecedented economic reforms, including the establishment of a fixed exchange rate, the privatization of failing state enterprises, as well as a program of trade liberalization. The result of his economic reforms was a halt to inflation, leading to a rise in Yugoslavia's standard of living. Nonetheless, the short- term effect of economic reforms undertaken by Markoviƒá led to a decline in Yugoslavia's industrial sector. Numerous bankruptcies occurred as state-owned enterprises struggled to compete in a more free market environment, a fact later wielded against Markoviƒá by many of his opponents. By 1990, the annual rate of growth in GDP had declined to ‚àí7.5%. Markoviƒá was the most popular politician in Yugoslavia and owed his popularity to his image of a modern Western-styled politician. He had become a leading political figure for those who wanted Yugoslavia to be transformed into a modern, democratic federation. Markoviƒá also maintained popularity by staying out of increasingly virulent quarrels within the leadership of League of Communists of Yugoslavia or trying to act as mediator between various republics. When the League of Communists of Yugoslavia broke up in January 1990, Markoviƒá had only his popularity and the apparent success of his economic program on his side. In July 1990, he formed the Union of Reform Forces of Yugoslavia (Savez reformskih snaga), a political party supporting a more centralized Yugoslav Federation, and accession to the European Community. This decision was not well received. Borisav Joviƒá, then the President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia, commented > The general conclusion is that Ante Markovic is no longer acceptable or > reliable to us. No one has any doubts in their mind any longer that he's the > extended arm of the United States in terms of overthrowing anyone who ever > thinks of socialism, and it is through our votes that we appointed him Prime > Minister in the Assembly. He is playing the most dangerous game of treason. Joviƒá's concluded that Markoviƒá > was no doubt the most active creator of the destruction of our economy, and > to a large extent a significant participant in the break-up of Yugoslavia. > Others, when boasted of having broken up Yugoslavia wanted to take this > infamous role upon themselves but in all these respects they never came > close to what Markoviƒá did, who had declared himself as the protagonist of > Yugoslavia's survival Palace of the Federation, seat of the Federal Executive Council of SFR Yugoslavia Later, his programme was sabotaged by Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá who > had virtually sealed Markovic's failure by December 1990 by secretly > securing an illegal loan worth $1.7 billion from Serbia's main bank to ease > his reelection that month. The loan undermined Markovic's economic austerity > program, undoing the progress that had been made toward controlling the > country's inflation rate. Christopher Bennet tells it in Yugoslavia's Bloody Collapse, stated: > Quite simply, the bank printed whatever money Milo≈°eviƒá felt he needed to > get himself reelected and the size of the 'loan' became clear a few weeks > later when inflation took off again throughout the country. As the economy > resumed its downward slide, Markoviƒá knew his enterprise had failed [...] The authority of the federal government was further diminished by secessionist moves in Slovenia and Croatia. In the last months of his tenure Markoviƒá tried to find a compromise between secessionists and those demanding that Yugoslavia remain a single entity. His efforts, although favored by the governments in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Macedonia, ultimately failed, because the Yugoslav People's Army, which should have served the interests of top-level governance, sided with Milo≈°eviƒá. Frustrated and politically impotent, Markoviƒá told his cabinet in September 1991 what he had gleaned from a wiretap that had come into his possession, which detailed a plan to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina: > The line has been clearly established [between the Serbian government, the > army and Serb politicians in Bosnia]. I know because I heard Slobodan > Milo≈°eviƒá give the order to Radovan Karad≈æiƒá to get in contact with General > Uzelac and to order, following the decisions of the meeting of the military > hierarchy, that arms should be distributed and that the TO of Krajina and > Bosnia be armed and utilized in the realization of the RAM plan.Magazine > Vreme, No. 48, 23 September 1991 Before he resigned in December 1991, Markovic endorsed the Carrington Plan to transform Yugoslavia into a loose confederation of states as a means to prevent a further escalation of the Yugoslav Wars. In the end, all his efforts failed to stop the violent disintegration of Yugoslavia. Assassination attempt Approximately at noon of 7 October 1991, Markoviƒá met with Stjepan Mesiƒá, then President of the Presidency of Yugoslavia and Franjo Tuƒëman, then President of Croatia in the Banski dvori. The purpose of the meeting was to persuade Markoviƒá to leave his position as the head of the Yugoslav federal government and endorse Croatian independence. The three then moved into the president's office for desert. Shortly after, the Yugoslav People's Army attempted to assassinate Markovic along with the democratically elected leadership of Croatia with a decapitation strike on Banski dvori. Markoviƒá immediately blamed Yugoslav defense minister Veljko Kadijeviƒá, and refused to return to Belgrade until Kadijeviƒá resigned from his post. Life after 1991 Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, Markoviƒá disappeared from the public eye and decided to work in Austria as an economic adviser. In 1993 he was rumoured to be Tuƒëman's choice for Croatian prime minister, apparently due to his economic expertise. The post ultimately fell to Nikica Valentiƒá, who established many of the same economic reforms that Markoviƒá did while prime minister. In the early 2000s, he worked as an economic advisor to the Macedonian government. In the late 2000s, he worked as an economic advisor to the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Markoviƒá also dedicated himself to a business career and spent most of his time in Sarajevo, building luxury apartment buildings and small hydropower plants. He appeared as a witness at the Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá trial at the ICTY in 2003. This appearance broke his 12 years of silence; after that testimony, he gave an interview to the Zagreb- based Globus news magazine. In his testimony, he stated that Milo≈°eviƒá was obviously striving to carve a Greater Serbia out of the ruins of Yugoslavia. He also revealed that both Milo≈°eviƒá and Tuƒëman confirmed to him that in March 1991 in Karaƒëorƒëevo they made an agreement to partition Bosnia and Herzegovina. Milo≈°eviƒá responded by blaming Markoviƒá for the intervention of the Yugoslav Army in Slovenia. Markoviƒá denied ordering intervention in Slovenia, stating that it was outside his mandate as prime minister of Yugoslavia. Markoviƒá died in the early hours of 28 November 2011 after a short illness, aged 87.https://mobile.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/world/europe/ante- markovic-last-premier-of-yugoslavia-dies-at-87.html Ante Markoviƒá was buried in Dubrovnik. His funeral was attended by former Croatian president Stjepan Mesiƒá, president of the Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik, filmmaker Emir Kusturica among many others. The Croatian Sabor (parliament) also sent their condolences to the family of Ante Markoviƒá.

The bridge was originally designed by John Stevenson of Oban (and not by Thomas Telford as sometimes quoted) and was built between 1792 and 1793 by engineer Robert Mylne.

It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on December 4, 1994. In the episode, Homer and Marge's sex life wanes, so Grampa restores it with a homemade revitalizing tonic. He and Homer travel town-to- town selling the elixir, but they are estranged after Grampa reveals that Homer‚Äôs conception was unintentional. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. After its initial airing on Fox, the episode was later released as part of a 1999 video collection: The Simpsons ‚Äì Too Hot For TV, and released again on the 2003 DVD edition of the same collection. The episode features cultural references to songs such as \\"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\\" and \\"Celebration\\", as well as a reference to the 1963 film The Nutty Professor. \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\" received a positive reception from television critics, and acquired a Nielsen rating of 9.5. Plot When Homer and Marge's sex life fizzles, they seek help to spice up their marriage. Homer peruses books like the Kama Sutra, but Marge wants \\"a tasteful book\\" so they settle on Mr. and Mrs. Erotic American, a Paul Harvey book-on-tape. Harvey recommends couples bathe together, but their faucet breaks because the Simpsons' bathtub cannot accommodate Homer and Marge. Next they try renting a sexy theme room at a hotel, but are forced to sleep in a utility room because the rooms are sold out. Grampa concocts a tonic that he guarantees will put the spark back into their relationship. The elixir works, so Homer and Grampa sell Simpson & Son Revitalizing Tonic to the public in a travelling medicine show. During their travels, they visit the farmhouse where Homer spent his childhood. After they bicker, Grampa angrily tells Homer he is the result of an unplanned pregnancy that would not have happened without the tonic. Homer stops the car and abandons Grampa. While their parents are enjoying enhanced sex lives from the tonic, the town's children grow suspicious of their absences during their frequent trysts. Ralph, Milhouse, Bart and their friends hatch conspiracy theories in the Simpsons' tree house. After Lisa sarcastically suggests parents are going to bed early because they are \\"reverse vampires\\" who must avoid nightfall, the other children decide the RAND Corporation is conspiring with space aliens to deprive children of dinner by forcing their parents to retire early. Unwilling to forgive Grampa, Homer resolves to be a better father to Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Bart and Lisa soon realize that smothering them is just as bad as neglecting them. Homer returns to the farmhouse to think. He sees an old photograph of himself as a child on Christmas morning and is sad that his father was not even present when he met Santa Claus. Homer realizes his father was wearing a Santa costume and really does love him. Homer reunites with Grampa, who has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups -- each having caused separate fires in the farmhouse -- and reconcile as the house burns down behind them. Production The episode was directed by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into a story about the relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is hard for him to do Grampa's voice for an extended period of time because it is \\"wheezy and airy\\". Homer and Marge spend the night at an inn, called the Aphrodite Inn, to spice up their sex life. The inn was partly based on the Madonna Inn, which, as in the episode, features different kinds of sex-oriented rooms with unusual names that are supposed to spice up a couple's love life. The design of the old farmhouse was inspired by the house featured in the 1993 film Flesh and Bone. Bart's obsession with conspiracy theories was inspired by the writers' observation that children around Bart's age go through a stage where they become \\"addicted\\" to information about UFOs and paranormal phenomena. Bill Oakley himself had gone through the same thing when he was around 10 years old. Cultural references Al Gore, former Vice President of the United States, is shown celebrating Lisa's purchase of his book, Sane Planning, Sensible Tomorrow, by listening to \\"Celebration\\" by Kool & the Gang. Additionally, a parody of The X-Files' theme song is played in the background of the scene leading into Gore's celebration. \\"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\\" is played during a chase scene, reminiscent of a recurring theme of the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde. When Professor Frink takes the tonic, he transforms into a suave man with a deep voice, which is a reference to Jerry Lewis transforming into Buddy Love in The Nutty Professor. Grampa, within proper context, successfully pronounces the word pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy\\" finished 58th in the ratings for the week of November 28 to December 4, 1994, with a Nielsen rating of 9.5. Retrieved on October 17, 2008. The episode was the third highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, said it was \\"an amazing episode, in which Homer actually has an argument with someone, rather than backing down. As he and his father drift further apart, so the family are at a loss at what to do. You can't help but feel sorry for Grampa as a piece of Simpson family history goes up in flames\\". Nate Meyers for Digitally Obsessed praised Dan Castellaneta's role in the episode and said: \\"Dan Castellaneta's work as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in [the episode] is full of emotion and brilliant comic timing. Watch the closing scene carefully as Homer returns to his childhood home, because Castellaneta gracefully dances between a tender father-son relationship and flat-out comedy\\". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said he \\"didn‚Äôt remember this as a very good episode, but it actually turns out to be quite strong. The initial plot in which Homer and Marge can‚Äôt get it together offers plenty of funny moments, and the scenes in which Homer battles with his dad offer depth and much humor. It‚Äôs also hard to beat the children's fears of the reverse vampires\\". Merchandise The episode was selected for release in a 1999 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons ‚Äì Too Hot For TV. Other episodes included in the collection set were \\"The Cartridge Family\\", \\"Natural Born Kissers\\", and \\"Treehouse of Horror IX\\".

The syndrome was first described in 1964 by Robert Douglas Sweet. It was also known as Gomm‚ÄìButton disease in honour of the first two patients Sweet diagnosed with the condition. Signs and symptoms Pustular lesions with central necrosis on the left leg of a patient with Sweet's syndrome associated with Crohn's disease. Punch biopsy of a skin lesion showing neutrophilic infiltration in the dermis, with no evidence of vasculitis (same patient with Crohn's disease). Acute, tender, erythematous plaques, nodes, pseudovesicles and, occasionally, blisters with an annular or arciform pattern occur on the head, neck, legs, and arms, particularly the back of the hands and fingers. The trunk is rarely involved. Fever (50%); arthralgia or arthritis (62%); eye involvement, most frequently conjunctivitis or iridocyclitis (38%); and oral aphthae (13%) are associated features. Cause SS can be classified based upon the clinical setting in which it occurs: classical or idiopathic SS, malignancy-associated SS, and drug-induced SS. =Systemic diseases= SS is a reactive phenomenon and should be considered a cutaneous marker of systemic disease. Careful systemic evaluation is indicated, especially when cutaneous lesions are severe or hematologic values are abnormal. Approximately 20% of cases are associated with malignancy, predominantly hematological, especially acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). An underlying condition (streptococcal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, nonlymphocytic leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, pregnancy) is found in up to 50% of cases. Attacks of SS may precede the hematologic diagnosis by 3 months to 6 years, so that close evaluation of patients in the ‚Äúidiopathic‚Äù group is required. There is now good evidence that treatment with hematopoietic growth factors‚Äîincluding granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is used to treat AML, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor‚Äîcan cause SS. Lesions typically occur when the patient has leukocytosis and neutrophilia but not when the patient is neutropenic. However, G-CSF may cause SS in neutropenic patients because of the induction of stem cell proliferation, the differentiation of neutrophils, and the prolongation of neutrophil survival. =Associations= Although it may occur in the absence of other known disease, SS is often associated with hematologic disease (including leukemia), and immunologic disease (rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, Beh√ßet's syndrome). Pregnancy associated Sweet syndrome typically present in first or second trimester. It may recur with subsequent pregnancy, but there seems to be no risk to the fetus. A genetic association has been suggested, but no specific genetic link has been identified. Diagnosis The clinical differential diagnosis includes pyoderma gangrenosum, infection, erythema multiforme, adverse drug reactions, and urticaria. Recurrences are common and affect up to one third of patients. =Laboratory studies= Studies show a moderate neutrophilia (less than 50%), elevated ESR (greater than 30 mm/h) (90%), and a slight increase in alkaline phosphatase (83%). Skin biopsy shows a papillary and mid-dermal mixed infiltrate of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with nuclear fragmentation and histiocytic cells. The infiltrate is predominantly perivascular with endothelial-cell swelling in some vessels, but vasculitic changes (blood clots; deposition of fibrin, complement, or immunoglobulins within the vessel walls; red blood cell extravasation;inflammatory infiltration of vascular walls) are absent in early lesions.Perivasculitis occurs secondarily, because of cytokines released by the lesional neutrophils. True transmural vasculitis is not an expected finding histopathologically in SS. =Definition= Sweet described a disease with four features: fever; leukocytosis; acute, tender, red plaques; and a papillary dermal infiltrate of neutrophils. This led to the name acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis. Larger series of patients showed that fever and neutrophilia are not consistently present. The diagnosis is based on the two constant features, a typical eruption and the characteristic histologic features; thus the eponym \\"Sweet's syndrome\\" is used. Treatment Systemic corticosteroids such as (prednisone) can produce rapid improvement and are the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for treatment. The temperature, white blood cell count, and eruption improve within 72 hours. The skin lesions clear within 3 to 9 days. Abnormal laboratory values rapidly return to normal. There are, however, frequent recurrences. Corticosteroids are tapered within 2 to 6 weeks to zero.Resolution of the eruption is occasionally followed by milia and scarring. The disease clears spontaneously in some patients. Topical and/or intralesional corticosteroids may be effective as either monotherapy or adjuvant therapy. Oral potassium iodide or colchicine may induce rapid resolution.Patients who have a potential systemic infection or in whom corticosteroids are contraindicated can use these agents as a first-line therapy. In one study, indomethacin, 150 mg per day, was given for the first week, and 100 mg per day was given for 2 additional weeks. Seventeen of 18 patients had a good initial response; fever and arthralgias were markedly attenuated within 48 hours, and eruptions cleared between 7 and 14 days. Patients whose cutaneous lesions continued to develop were successfully treated with prednisone (1 mg/kg per day). No patient had a relapse after discontinuation of indomethacin. Other alternatives to corticosteroid treatment include dapsone, doxycycline, clofazimine, and cyclosporine. All of these drugs influence migration and other functions of neutrophils.

It produces news output and factual programmes for La 1, La 2 and TVE Internacional, and simulcasts most domestic news programmes aired on La 1. Distribution It was initially available on the V√≠a Digital digital satellite package on the Hispasat satellite at 30¬∞ West, and was encrypted, and thus mainly aimed to Spain, although it could also be seen simulcasted by TVE Internacional at certain times of the day. However, it eventually started simulcasting on the Eutelsat Hot Bird and SES Astra satellite system in the clear, moving later to free-to-air digital transmissions on the same satellite at a later date. Currently, the channel is available on the Astra 1KR and Hispasat 1D satellites at 19.2¬∞E and 30¬∞W respectively as part of the Digital + package for Spain only, on the Eutelsat Hot Bird satellite at 13¬∞E for the whole of Europe, and the Hispasat 1C satellite at 30¬∞W for the Americas until March 2006. Afterwards it will only be possible to receive TVE through Spanish packages offered by Dish Network and DirectTV in the Americas. Since November 2005, it has also been available on digital terrestrial television in Spain. La 1 simulcasts the channel between 04:00 or 05:00 (local time) and 06:30. During the public holidays or the summer break, it simulcasts until 10:05. In Europe, it is available free- to-air on Eutelsat Hot Bird 13¬∞ East. Due to economic reasons, it moved its satellite distribution for Europe to Astra 19.2¬∞E alongside TVE Internacional and the RTVE radios (RNE Radio Nacional, RNE Radio Cl√°sica, RNE Radio 3, RNE R√†dio 4, RNE Radio 5, Radio Exterior) between January 2014 and January 2020.

The novel is about an adult couple who rekindle a long-ago summer romance that ended because of class differences, and their two teenage children from other marriages who also fall in love with each other. It was adapted into a 1959 film of the same name. Plot summary Two onetime teenage lovers, Ken Jorgenson and Sylvia Hunter, marry other people, but rediscover each other later in life. By then, Sylvia has a son, Johnny, and Ken a daughter, Molly, who also begin a romance. While in college, the self-supporting Ken takes a summer job as a lifeguard on Pine Island, an exclusive Maine island resort, where Sylvia and her nouveau riche family are staying as guests of the old money owners. The rich young people at the resort mock Ken and exclude him from their social activities, considering him a lowly employee. Although Sylvia is strongly attracted to Ken, she feels pressure from her family and from her wealthy peers to reject the impoverished Ken and make a more suitable match with Bart Hunter, the son of a wealthy, established island family. Bart and Ken eventually come to blows over Sylvia, leading to Ken and Sylvia secretly consummating their love. Ken leaves the island for good at the end of the summer, and Sylvia marries Bart as her family wishes. Ken becomes a millionaire through his work as a research chemist, and marries his partner's daughter, Helen, who turns out to be prudish and frigid. Meanwhile, Sylvia's husband Bart turns to alcohol as his family fortune dwindles, and he turns their island home into an inn. After twenty years away, Ken decides to visit the island again, writing Bart to ask for lodging. At first Bart wants to refuse, since he feels Ken is visiting to gloat over the relative change in their financial circumstances, but Sylvia insists that they need the money too badly to turn Ken down. Ken brings Molly and Helen to the island, and everyone tries to be cordial. The young Johnny and Molly soon become enamored of each other, while Ken and Sylvia fall in love all over again. When Bart finds out about Ken and Sylvia, he asks for a divorce and custody of their son John. Later, a friend of Helen's alerts her to Ken's affair with Sylvia, and Ken and Helen divorce. John and Molly are sent to separate boarding schools. Ken and Sylvia eventually marry. While at their respective schools, John and Molly begin an avid correspondence. Helen and her mother Margaret are not pleased, as they find it inappropriate for a girl Molly's age to be so attached to a boy, but the correspondence continues, with rendezvous during school breaks. John and Molly's romance culminates when they see each other again at Ken and Sylvia's beach house. The teenagers acknowledge that they are in love with one another, and they consummate it shortly thereafter. Back at school, Molly learns from a doctor that she is pregnant, and John hitchhikes across the country to be with and support her. Ken and Sylvia give their guarded approval to John and Molly's marriage, feeling it would be hypocritical for them to deny the teenagers their love. Bart cannot attend the wedding, since his alcoholism has forced him to enter a veterans' hospital; while he disapproves, he urges John to take over the inn. Helen attends the wedding under sedation. John and Molly spend their honeymoon on Pine Island, John's \\"one good inheritance\\", as Bart terms it in a letter.

It is the home of Colgate University's football and men's lacrosse teams. Colgate opened the stadium in 1939, originally as Colgate Athletic Field. Colgate's football teams ‚Äì then known as the Red Raiders and competing at the highest level of NCAA play ‚Äì were coached during the stadium's inaugural year by Andy Kerr, who led the team from 1929 to 1946. The stadium adopted its current name on \\"Andy Kerr Day\\" on September 17, 1966, before a crowd of 8,000. The 87-year-old former coach was on hand to greet well-wishers and witness a 34-0 Colgate football victory over Boston University. Parts of the stadium have also been named to honor Raider athletes and coaches. A permanent main grandstand on the east (home team) side of the stadium was dedicated in 1991 to Frederick H. Dunlap, 1970s-80s football head coach and athletic director. The seven-lane, 400-meter running track around the field was dedicated to 1937 graduate R.L. Browning in September 1998; it serves as a training facility for 25 Colgate varsity programs. In 2003, a new three-story press box was constructed behind the west stands of the stadium, named for 1950s and 1960s football coach Hal Lahar and 1970s football player Robert Abeltin. In 2006, the stadium added a new scoreboard with video capability.

The address is 1843 South Tamiami Trail. There are more than 250,000 visitors a year. History The park's genesis was in 1955, when Elsa Scherer Burrows, owner of the South Creek Ranch, died. Her will left the ranch to the state to form a park. It was to be dedicated to the memory of her father, Oscar Scherer, the developer of a shoe leather dyeing process in 1872. A year later, the park was ready and opened to visitors. Thirty years after that, realtor and environmentalist Jon Thaxton started work to protect the neighboring Florida scrub jay territory. In 1992 this resulted in being added from the adjacent Palmer Ranch that had been among the holdings of Bertha Honor√© Palmer, in large part due to the Nature Conservancy, public support, and the use of Preservation 2000 funds, expanding the park's size to .

The park is one of the few places in the state where there are enough scrubby flatwoods for the Florida scrub jay to maintain a healthy population. Other birds that can be seen in the park are bald eagles, ospreys, warblers, woodpeckers, egrets, and the great blue and little blue heron. The freshwater Lake Osprey has bream, bluegill, largemouth bass and channel catfish, among others. South Creek is brackish, so it can contain saltwater fish. Recreational activities The park has such amenities as beaches, bicycling, boating, canoeing, fishing, hiking, kayaking, picnicking, snorkeling, swimming and wildlife viewing. It also has an interpretive exhibit and visitor center. The Legacy Trail, which runs on a former railroad route, also runs through and connects with the park.

The stadium opened in 1908 as the official home for the Holy Cross Crusaders football team. Before that, most games were played on adjoining the baseball field. Named after Reverend James Fitton, who donated land to the Archdiocese of Boston to found the college, it is an irregularly shaped three-sided horseshoe on the edge of the college's campus. The northern football stands are shorter than the southern due to Interstate 290 being adjacent to the field. Officially known as Fitton Football Stadium, the football facility is a 23,500-seat stadium, home to the Holy Cross Crusaders football team. The field itself was used as the football field, and termed Fitton Field, as early as 1908. A wooden structure was constructed at that time, but a more sturdy concrete structure did not appear until 1912. In 1924, the concrete was replaced with the steel structure that still stands today, increasing the stadium's capacity. It would remain identical until 1986, when the wooden seating was replaced with aluminum bleachers, further expanding its capacity to its current level.

It opened in 1926 as Fisher Field. During 2006 and 2007 Fisher Field underwent a $33-million renovation. It reopened in time for the 2006 college football season complete with new seating, a JumboTron, a new press box, FieldTurf, and field lighting. Construction of a Football Varsity House beyond the western endzone commenced in Fall 2006 and was completed before the 2007 season. History Lafayette won the 142nd edition of \\"The Rivalry\\" against Lehigh University in 2006, the third of four straight victories in the most-played rivalry in college football history. Erected in 1926, Fisher Field was named for Thomas Fisher, Lafayette College Class of 1888, who almost single-handedly raised the $445,000 needed for construction through fund-raising efforts and a sizable personal contribution. The first football game played in the 18,000-seat structure came on September 25, 1926, with a 35-0 Leopard victory over Muhlenberg College. In 1973, during the construction of Allan P. Kirby Field House, more than 4,500 seats were removed from the north stands to make room for the structure. A $33 million renovation in 2006 and 2007 brought new spectator seating throughout the venue, including chair back seating in select areas, and additional visitor-side seating. A state-of-the-art FieldTurf surface, lights, and a press box were installed, and improved restroom and vending areas were also included. A 19-by-35 foot video matrix board, located in the northwest corner of the stadium, provides the Lafayette Sports Network telecast of the game and features \\"in-house\\" entertainment for Leopard fans. The facility seats 13,132, with additional seating for 2,075 added for the Nov. 18 meeting with Lehigh, which raised the capacity to 15,207. The Leopards posted their inaugural victory at Fisher Field at Fisher Stadium on Nov. 11, 2006, when Lafayette defeated Georgetown, 45-14. Lafayette wide receiver Joe Ort set the single-game school record with 274 yards receiving in that contest. On September 1, 2007, Lafayette opened its season hosting the first ever night football game at Fisher Field.

The Rivalry When Lafayette College is host for The Rivalry with Lehigh University every other year, more than 3,500 temporary seats are erected to accommodate the sellout crowd of 17,000. These temporary seats are left standing during the week for use at the Phillipsburg- Easton game. Thus the total number of seats for the high school football game vary from year to year. To commemorate the 150th edition of The Rivalry, the 2014 contest, a Lafayette home game, was held at Yankee Stadium. Hosting the Easton-Phillipsburg game Fisher Field at Fisher Stadium acts as neutral site for the traditional high school football rivalry between Easton Area High School and Phillipsburg High School.

He was the son and the crown prince of the Kayanian King Goshtasp and Queen KatƒÅyoun. He was the grandchild of Kay Lohrasp. EsfandiyƒÅr is best known from the tragic story of a battle with Rostam described in Ferdowsi's epic Shahnameh (Epic of Kings). It is one of the longest episodes in Shahnameh, and is one of its literary highlights. Etymology The Perso word 'SepandiƒÅr' is derived from or 'Spandyat' (the variance is due to ambiguities inherent in the Pahlavi script), which in turn derives from meaning \\"Given by Spenta Armaiti\\" which is later personified as sepandarmaz (ÿ≥ŸæŸÜÿØÿßÿ±ŸÖÿ∞) but in original Avestan meant creative harmonious thought usually referring to the physics laws of nature but in time had come to mean holy or \\"Given by (the) holy\\" (See Amesha Spenta for other meanings of spenta). In the Shahnameh According to the epic Shahnameh, EsfandiyƒÅr was the Crown Prince and a Divine Warrior of ancient Iran (or Persia) who supported the prophet Zartosht (Zarathustra), enabling him to spread the religion of Zoroastrianism. He also fought against many apostates and enemies of Zartosht to do so. In return, Zartosht gave EsfandiyƒÅr a chain and armor from Heaven. The armor made him invincible and the chain had the power to bind anyone, even a demon or evil magician, making them unable to escape. Zartosht also gave a Divine blessing to the prince and declared that anyone who would spill the blood of EsfandiyƒÅr (killed him) shall suffer a cursed life of bad omens until the day he dies and even after death would be condemned to hell. Esfandiyar fighting with wolves. EsfandiyƒÅr's father, Goshtasp, had promised to give him the throne if he manages to repel an invasion in far-off provinces. EsfandiyƒÅr successfully carries out the order. Upon his return EsfandiyƒÅr's father informs him that during his absence the king of Turan Arjaasb had rebelled and attacked Iran's capital and abducted EsfandiyƒÅr's two sisters. Goshtasp sends EsfandiyƒÅr on another mission to suppress the rebellion and retrieve the abducted princesses. EsfandiyƒÅr sets out in haste passing through a difficult and dangerous path with 7 different battles which would be known later as 7 labors of EsfandiyƒÅr. These are: 1. Slaying two monstrous wolves. 2. Slaying two man eating lions. 3. Slaying a Dragon. 4. Killing a wicked enchantress. 5. Fighting and killing a Simurgh and its two offspring. 6. Braving a three-day- long storm. 7. Crossing a desert. EsfandiyƒÅr then successfully infiltrates the Fortress of Arjaasb known as Roin Dej. (lit. Invincible Fortress) EsfandiyƒÅr then kills Arjaasb, rescues his sisters and conquers the fortress. Upon EsfandiyƒÅr's return to Iran, Goshtasp, who did not want to part with his throne, hedges once again. Although Goshtasp is aware of a prediction that foretells the death of EsfandiyƒÅr at the hand of Rostam, he compels the young hero to go and bring the aging Rostam in chains for his arrogance and disrespect toward the king, promising that upon completing this mission he will give the throne to EsfandiyƒÅr and retire. EsfandiyƒÅr initially protests, reminding his father of Rostam's fame, great age, and services to the dynasty, but eventually complies with his father's wishes and sets out towards Rostam's home. Upon reaching the home of Rostam, EsfandiyƒÅr delivers the message, but Rostam refuses to comply to be put in chains, only agreeing to accompany the young prince to his father's palace. EsfandiyƒÅr insists, but Rostam, making numerous other concessions, stands his ground and the two eventually meet in single combat. In the subsequent battle, the invincible EsfandiyƒÅr is unaffected by Rostam's blows while Rostam is seriously wounded by EsfandiyƒÅr's arrows, which had diamond arrowheads and could easily pierce through Rostam's armor. Pleading respite to dress his wounds, Rostam withdraws. Rostam's father Zaal who was raised by the legendary bird Simurgh (apparently there were two different Simurghs in Shahnameh, one which is slain in 7 labours of EsfandiyƒÅr and the other one which raised Zaal and lived in mountains of Iran) summons Simurgh by burning a feather given to him from Simurgh herself to ask help for curing his son. And Simurgh benevolently cures both Rostam and his horse Rakhsh who was also wounded by EsfandiyƒÅr's arrows. and then Rostam learns from the Simurgh that the only weapon that can affect EsfandiyƒÅr is a shot to the eyes from a special double-headed arrow, made from the branch of a tamarisk tree near the Persian Gulf. Simurgh also warns Rostam about the fate that awaits the killer of EsfandiyƒÅr and asks Rostam to consider surrendering to the Prince, and since he is a divine prince there would be no shame in surrendering to him. But Rostam refuses to accept either the shame of surrendering or being chained by anyone. Upon making this decision, Simurgh carries Rostam to the tamarisk tree, where he fashions the double head arrow with a feather of Simurgh and a twig of the tamarisk tree. When the battle resumes the next morning, EsfandiyƒÅr is blinded by a shot through the eye. Before dying, EsfandiyƒÅr tells Rostam not to blame himself: it was the false promise of his father and the Arrow of Simurgh that killed him. EsfandiyƒÅr tells Rostam that Goshtasp should be guilty as the real murderer.

However, teams were concerned about their ability to sign him, as he had turned down the Padres' offer and was planning on transferring to Rice University. Nevertheless, he was drafted in the 39th round of the 2003 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers, but still got supplemental money when the Dodgers signed him in August 2003. At the time, his bonus was the highest for a \\"non draft and follow\\" outside the first three rounds. Playing career =Los Angeles Dodgers= Concern about his range caused the Dodgers to move him from shortstop to third base prior to sending him to their rookie league team, the Ogden Raptors, for the last few games of the 2003 season. He started the season with the Dodgers Single-A team in Columbus, hitting .283 with 13 home runs and 42 RBI before being promoted to the higher Single-A team in Vero Beach where he struggled a bit, hitting only .237 with 10 HRs and 34 RBI. In , at Vero Beach, he hit .333 with 21 HRs and 51 RBI and received a call-up to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns. At Jacksonville, he hit .273 with 9 HRs and 43 RBI. He was voted the Dodgers Minor League Player of the Year.Andy LaRoche Statistics ‚Äì The Baseball Cube For the minor league season, he started at Jacksonville and hit .309 with 9 HRs and 46 RBI. He would be called up to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, where he hit .322 with 10 HRs and 35 RBI. LaRoche during his tenure with the Los Angeles Dodgers in spring training. During LaRoche's second big league spring training in , he noted that his last name should be spelled \\"La Roche\\" with a defined space. However, as reported by Steve Henson of the Los Angeles Times, he decided to revert to the previous spelling by the end of camp. LaRoche made his major league debut on May 6, 2007, against the Atlanta Braves. He recorded his first major league hit, a ground rule double, against Kyle Davies. The following day, May 7, LaRoche recorded his first two RBI against the Florida Marlins. After being demoted to Triple-A Las Vegas, LaRoche was recalled on September 1. LaRoche received more playing time in September due to Nomar Garciaparra's injury problems. On September 20, LaRoche hit his first major league home run off Colorado Rockies pitcher Matt Herges.September 20, 2007 Los Angeles Dodgers at Colorado Rockies Box Score and Play by Play Baseball- Reference.com LaRoche played for Team USA in the 2007 Baseball World Cup during the MLB off-season. On March 7, 2008, while playing a spring training game against the St. Louis Cardinals, LaRoche tore the ulnar collateral ligament in the base of his right thumb. In a freak accident, LaRoche was attempting to catch a pickoff throw from catcher Danny Ardoin. The throw deflected off Cardinals base runner D'Angelo Jim√©nez and struck LaRoche on his throwing hand. LaRoche was injured in the fifth inning, having taken over third base duties for Nomar Garciaparra, who was injured an inning earlier when he was struck on the wrist with a pitch. At the time, LaRoche and Garciaparra were in competition for the starting third base job. Neither player could begin the season, and minor league rookie Blake DeWitt assumed third base duties on opening day. On May 3, after completing a ten-game rehab assignment with the Double-A Jacksonville Suns and the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, LaRoche was reinstated from the disabled list and optioned to the 51s. This move was seen as Dodgers management endorsing Blake DeWitt, who had played well enough to keep his starting role while LaRoche was on the disabled list. LaRoche was recalled from Las Vegas on June 10 and made his 2008 debut the next day at first base. He hit a home run against Padres starter Randy Wolf in the fourth inning. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On July 31, 2008, LaRoche, along with pitcher Bryan Morris, was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in part of a three team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Jason Bay to the Boston Red Sox. LaRoche joined his brother Adam in Pittsburgh. After hitting .144 while with the Pirates in 2008, LaRoche was given an \\"intensive offseason workout regimen\\" throughout the off-season. His reunion with brother Adam ended on July 22, 2009, when the Pirates traded Adam to the Boston Red Sox for minor league pitcher Hunter Strickland and shortstop Argenis D√≠az. Nine days later, the Red Sox traded Adam to the Atlanta Braves for Casey Kotchman. On November 20, 2010, Andy was designated for assignment by the Pirates, and was made a free agent. =Oakland Athletics= On January 24, 2011, LaRoche signed a minor league deal with the Oakland Athletics with an invite to major league camp. He made the opening day roster, appearing in 40 games before being designated for assignment on June 5. He was assigned to the Athletics' Triple-A affiliate, the Sacramento River Cats. On August 18, 2011, in a tied extra-inning game against the Omaha Storm Chasers, he pitched the 13th inning, and was awarded the win. After the 2011 season, he elected for free agency. =Cleveland Indians= On December 21, 2011, LaRoche signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians. He also received an invitation to spring training. LaRoche was released by the Indians organization on June 26, 2012. =Boston Red Sox= On June 28, 2012, LaRoche signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. He played with the Pawtucket Red Sox for the rest of the season, appearing in 50 games. At the end of the season, he became an unrestricted free agent. =Toronto Blue Jays= On January 30, 2013, LaRoche signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays with an invite to spring training. LaRoche started the season with the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons, and was called up on June 7 as a potential fill-in at third base for the injured Brett Lawrie and recently demoted Anthony Gose. LaRoche was designated for assignment following a 10-6 loss to the Chicago White Sox, having played just one game for the Blue Jays and going 0-4 at the plate. After clearing waivers, LaRoche was assigned outright to Buffalo on June 13. He became a free agent on October 1. He signed a minor league contract with the Blue Jays for the 2014 season. =Chicago White Sox= On January 23, 2015, LaRoche signed a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on April 1. =Wichita Wingnuts= Following his release, LaRoche signed with the Wichita Wingnuts of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and finished the season with them. He became a free agent following the 2015 season. =Sugar Land Skeeters= On February 26, 2016, LaRoche was traded from the Wichita Wingnuts to the Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent after the 2016 season. =Coaching career= LaRoche was named as the Hitting Coach for the Burlington Royals for the 2019 season.

It opened in 1988, replacing Taylor Stadium, which stood in the main academic campus from 1914 until 1987. The former Taylor Stadium site now holds the Rauch Business Center, the Zoellner Arts Center, and a parking garage. The Murray H. Goodman Stadium is named after real estate developer Murray H. Goodman, a Lehigh alumnus, who donated 550 acres in Saucon Valley in 1983 to build a sports complex. The stadium is the home of the Lehigh Mountain Hawks football team, who compete in the Patriot League at the Division I Football Championship Subdivision (or FCS) level, formerly known as I-AA. Located in a rural valley surrounded by wooded hills, its ample nearby parking makes tailgating before games very popular. Concession stands protected from the weather and large indoor restrooms are provided on both sides of the stadium. It also features a two-tiered press box/skybox overlooking the west grandstand, limited chair back seating and locker rooms for home and visiting teams. Prior to the 2019 football season, a new press box was constructed behind the east grandstand and the previous media facility was converted into additional suites.\\"Goodman Stadium receives upgrades for 2019 season,\\" Lehigh University Athletics, Wednesday, August 28, 2019.

Lehigh won the game 37-13, bringing the overall record to Lafayette 76 games to Lehigh 66. The Goodman Campus was the preseason training camp location for the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles from 1996-2012. Eagles' training camps often draw as many as 10,000 fans, ranking at the top of NFL training camp attendance. The Eagles' twice-daily practices were held from mid-July to mid-August.

Chirkova considers the following four languages to be part of four separate Tibeto-Burman branches: *Lizu (Ersu group) *Shixing (\\"Naic\\") *Namuzi (\\"Naic\\") *Pumi Both Shixing and Namuzi are both classified as Naic (Naxi) by Jacques & Michaud (2011), but Naic would not be a valid genetic unit in Chirkova's classification scheme since Shixing and Namuzi are considered by Chirkova to not be part of a single branch. =Yu (2012)= Yu (2012:218) notes that Ersuic and Naish languages share some forms that are not found in Lolo-Burmese or ‚Äúcore‚Äù Qiangic (Qiang, Prinmi, and Minyak). As a result, ‚ÄúSouthern Qiangic‚Äù (Ersuic, Namuyi, and Shixing) may be closer to Naish than it is to ‚Äúcore‚Äù Qiangic. Together, Southern Qiangic and Naish could form a wider ‚ÄúNaic‚Äù group that has links to both Lolo-Burmese to the south and other Qiangic languages to the north. Obsolete names Shafer (1955) and other accounts of the Dzorgaic/Ch'iang branchSuch as Barley (1997) () preserve the names Dzorgai, Korts√®, Thochu, Outer/Outside Man-tze, Pingfang from the turn of the century. The first three were Northern Qiang, and Outside Mantse was Southern Qiang.UC Berkeley, 1992, Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area, vol. 15, pp. 76‚Äì77. When Jiarongic is included as a branch of Qiangic, but distinct from the non-Jiarongic languages, the label \\"Dzorgaic\\" may be used for Qiang proper. Hsi-fan (Xifan) is an ethnic name, meaning essentially 'Tibetan'; the people speak Qiangic or Jiarongic languages such as Qiang, Ergong/Horpa, Ersu, Guiqiong, Shixing, Zhaba, Namuyi, Muya/Minyak, and Jiarong, but not Naxi/Moso, Pumi, or Tangut. The term has not been much used since language surveys of the 1980s resulted in sufficient data for classification.

Along with Andrew Scheer, he is one of the few politicians with dual American and Canadian citizenship to be elected to the Parliament of Canada. He is best known for his series of annual Lemon-Aid car guides. Edmonston now lives in Panama. Background Edmonston served as a United States Army infantry medic in Panama from 1961 to 1964, where he witnessed the so-called flag riots, and graduated from the Canal Zone College. He subsequently immigrated to Montreal, where he became known as a journalist and consumer advocate. In journalism, Edmonston has worked as a television reporter, a syndicated newspaper columnist, and a host of his own open-line show. Consumer advocate In 1968 he founded the Automobile Protection Association (APA), which uncovered and disseminated information about automobile defects and successfully pressured the auto industry for several recalls. Edmonston was president of the APA until 1987. In that role, he worked on thousands of consumer claims against automobile manufacturers and won million-dollar settlements and hundreds of lawsuits for consumers. His work with the association led to the Lemon-Aid series of car manuals, issued annually since the 1970s. Edmonston has served as a pro bono witness on automobile defects and safety before numerous courts and government committees. In 1982, he testified on inadequate automobile quality and rust protection before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Technology and successfully pressured Ford to become the first automaker to provide a corrosion compensation warranty. He is the author of over 100 best- selling books on consumer rights and the automobile industry. Political career Edmonston entered Canadian politics in the 1988 federal election as a candidate for the New Democratic Party (NDP) in Chambly, Quebec, placing second. He won the riding in his second attempt, a 1990 by-election in which he defeated former Quebec cabinet minister Clifford Lincoln by almost 20,000 votes, becoming the first member of parliament from Quebec to be elected for the NDP. (Another Quebec MP, Robert Toupin from Terrebonne, had previously crossed the floor to the NDP in 1986.) His relationship with the NDP was at times turbulent. During the party's 1989 leadership campaign, he threatened to resign from the party if Dave Barrett became leader. A Quebec nationalist, Edmonston was offended by Barrett's view that western alienation was more important than Quebec's grievances over the constitution. Edmonston's differences with the NDP over its position on Canadian federalism and against decentralization and devolving powers to Quebec contributed to his decision not to run for re-election in 1993.

The artist Francisco de Goya worked in Cafe Botin as a waiter while waiting to get accepted into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. The restaurant is mentioned in an Ernest Hemingway novel and the book Fortunata y Jacinta by Benito P√©rez Gald√≥s (published 1886-1887).

It was inherited by a nephew called Candido Remis and had a name change to Sobrino de Bot√≠n, which survives to this day. Sobrino is the Spanish word for nephew. The cellar is from 1590 and is very old in comparison to the restaurant. Apart from using the original recipes, the restaurant has also kept the flame burning in the oven continuously, never to be extinguished . The restaurant and its speciality of cochinillo asado (roast suckling pig) are mentioned in the closing pages of Ernest Hemingway's novel The Sun Also Rises.

The magazine consisted mostly of very short and surreal jokes, along with cartoons. Each issue also featured Jack Handey's \\"Deep Thoughts\\", as well as other pieces written by him. History Although Army Man was never widely distributed, it garnered a lot of attention in the comedy world. Two of its writers (John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti) were picked up alongside Meyer to be part of the original writing staff of The Simpsons by the show's developer and show-runner Sam Simon, a fan of the magazine. Other Army Man writers would go on to write for The Simpsons in later seasons, including Jeff Martin, David Sacks, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Kevin Curran and Billy Kimball. Other notable contributors of the magazine included Mark O'Donnell, Andy Borowitz, Andy Breckman, Roz Chast, Spike Feresten (credited as Mike Feresten), Ian Frazier, Ann Hodgman, Mitchell Kriegman, Merrill Markoe, Patricia Marx, Bob Odenkirk and David Owen. The writers were usually people Meyer knew from his years at the Harvard Lampoon or who worked with him in TV shows like Late Night with David Letterman, The New Show, Not Necessarily The News and Saturday Night Live.

He is tall and weighs . Ross has played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers (2003), Los Angeles Dodgers (2005‚Äì2006), Cincinnati Reds (2006), Florida Marlins (2006‚Äì2010), San Francisco Giants (2010‚Äì2011), Boston Red Sox (2012), Arizona Diamondbacks (2013‚Äì2014) and Oakland Athletics (2015). He is one of the few Major League players to bat right-handed but throw left-handed. Following high school, Ross embarked on his professional career, getting selected by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. He reached the Major Leagues in 2003, but suffered a torn ACL which caused him to miss most of September. He was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers following spring training in 2004, appearing in a handful of games with them in 2005. In 2006, he played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Cincinnati Reds, and the Florida Marlins. It was in Florida that he finally established himself, as he played with the Marlins through 2010. He was used mainly as a reserve outfielder in 2006 and 2007, but during the 2008 season he took over a starting role. He would be a starting outfielder for the rest of his Marlins career, playing centerfield or right field. In 2009, he hit a career-high 24 home runs and won the Marlins' Charlie Hough Good Guy award. During the 2010 season, the Marlins placed Ross on waivers, and he was claimed by the San Francisco Giants. Named their starting right fielder for the 2010 playoffs, he went on to win the National League Championship Series Most Valuable Player Award, hitting five home runs in the postseason while helping the Giants win the 2010 World Series over the Texas Rangers. He re-signed with San Francisco in 2011, batting .240 during the year. In 2012, he signed a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox, hitting 22 home runs while playing every day despite the fact that the Red Sox originally expected him to be a reserve player for them. The Arizona Diamondbacks signed him to a three-year contract in December 2012, but a season-ending hip injury limited Ross to 94 games during his first year with the team. Early life Ross was born in Portales, New Mexico. Ross's father was a chiropractor and professional bull rider; and as a youth, Ross wanted to become a rodeo clown. He used to attend his father's bull-riding matches in clown outfits, complete with makeup. He did not give up on the aspiration until his family moved to Dallas, Texas. The Ross family eventually moved back to New Mexico, and Ross played high school baseball at Carlsbad High School. Ross also played football until ninth grade. During high school, he was a Baseball America All-American selection. As a senior, he threw a five-inning perfect game. He graduated in 1999. Minor League career Ross was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1999 Major League Baseball draft. He began his minor league career that year with the rookie Gulf Coast League Tigers, batting .218 with 31 hits, eight doubles, three triples, four home runs, and 18 runs batted in (RBI) in 42 games. In 2000, he played for the A West Michigan Whitecaps of the Midwest League, getting named the Midwest League Player of the Week from June 18‚Äì24 after he scored four runs, had two doubles and a triple, drove in six runs, and batted .636. In 122 games, he batted .267 with 116 hits, 17 doubles, nine triples, seven home runs, 68 RBI, and 11 stolen bases. His nine triples were tied for second in the league. After the season, Baseball America said he had the best outfield arm in the Detroit system. Ross played for the A-advanced Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League in 2001. He was the league's player of the week from June 18‚Äì24 after stealing four bases and batting .516 with 11 runs scored, three doubles, two home runs, and five RBI. Then, he was named Player of the Week from August 13 to 19 after batting .385. In 127 games (10th in the league), Ross batted .276 with 84 runs scored (fifth), 133 hits (eighth), 34 doubles (second to Matt Padgett's 37), five triples (tied with eight other players for seventh), 15 home runs (tied with Jason Jones for eighth), 80 RBI (seventh), and 28 stolen bases (tied with Josh McKinley for eighth). After the season, Baseball America ranked him the ninth best Tigers' prospect and again said he had the best outfield arm in the organization. In 2002, Ross played for the AA Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League, getting named to both the regular season and postseason All-Star teams for the league. He was named the Tigers' Minor League Player of the Month in June after hitting .336 with 29 runs, 10 doubles, two triples, eight home runs, 30 RBI, and 10 stolen bases; he earned the same honor from Topps. A broken toe forced him out of action from July 1 through August 2 and limited him to 105 games. He finished the year with 112 hits, 28 doubles, three triples, 72 RBI, and 16 stolen bases. His 19 home runs were tied with Andy Phillips and Aaron McNeal for ninth in the league. After the season, he played for the Mesa Solar Sox of the Arizona Fall League. For the third year in a row, Baseball America said he had the best outfield arm in the Tigers' system. Ross began 2003 with the AAA Toledo Mud Hens of the International League. On July 4, he was called up by the Tigers. He made his Major League debut that day, going hitless in two at bats before exiting after getting hit by a pitch in the sixth inning as the Tigers lost 9‚Äì8 to the Kansas City Royals. He got his first hit on July 9, an RBI single against Bartolo Col√≥n in a 4‚Äì2 victory over the Chicago White Sox. After he had one hit in four games, he was optioned back to Toledo on July 16 to make room for Danny Patterson, who was returning from the disabled list. From July 27 to 29, and again from August 17 to 18, Ross homered in three consecutive games for the Mud Hens. In 124 games for the Mud Hens, Ross batted .287 with 135 hits, 35 doubles (tied for sixth in the International League with Andy Abad and Luis Rodr√≠guez), six triples (tied for fourth with Ross Gload and Coco Crisp), 20 home runs (tied for third with Brandon Larson behind Fernando Seguignol's 28 and Ernie Young's 21), 61 RBI, and 15 stolen bases. He was recalled to the big leagues in September when rosters expanded. On September 2, he hit a grand slam off Cliff Lee for his first Major League home run in an 8‚Äì6 victory over the Cleveland Indians, becoming the first Tiger since Milt Cuyler in 1991 to hit a grand slam for his first home run. In that same game, he tore his ACL running to first base, which required season-ending surgery. In six games with the Tigers, Ross had four hits in 19 at bats, including five RBI. Ross was named the Tigers' Minor League Player of the Year, and he was named to Baseball America's postseason All-Star team. For the final time, he was rated as having the best outfield arm in the Detroit organization. In 2004, Ross was supposed to begin the season in the minors for Detroit. However, with Detroit desperate for bullpen help, Ross was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 1 for relief pitcher Steve Colyer. He was assigned to the AAA Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League, where he was teammates with Jayson Werth and Shane Victorino, whom he went on to face in the 2010 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Injuries marred Ross's 2004 campaign; a knee injury kept him out for two weeks early in the season, he missed time from May 26 to July 15 after smashing his hand in a car door and breaking his finger, and he broke his wrist on August 25 which ended his season. In 60 games, he batted .273 with 65 hits, 17 doubles, 14 home runs, and 49 RBI. Ross spent most of 2005 with Las Vegas. From July 26 to August 11, he hit 10 home runs and had 25 RBI in 17 games. In 115 games, he batted .267 with 105 hits, 21 doubles, 22 home runs, and 63 RBI. Major League career =Los Angeles Dodgers/Cincinnati Reds= On June 24, 2005, Ross was recalled by the Dodgers to give them another bat during interleague play. He appeared in 14 games, batting .160 with four hits (one double, no home runs) and one RBI before getting sent back down on July 14 in favor of Steve Schmoll. He was not called up in September. Ross was out of options in 2006 and made the Dodgers Opening Day roster as a backup outfielder only because of an injury to Kenny Lofton. On April 13, he hit a tie-breaking grand slam and a three-run home run in a 13‚Äì5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. He batted .500 in eight games for the Dodgers before getting designated for assignment on April 17 to make room for √ìscar Robles on the roster. A week later, he was traded to the Cincinnati Reds for cash or a player to be named later (Ben Kozlowski). Ross broke his finger in his debut with the Reds on April 29 and went on the disabled list. He returned to the Reds on May 23 and appeared in one more game before getting traded to the Florida Marlins on May 26 for cash considerations.Baggarly, p. 206 =Florida Marlins= 2006 Upon joining the Marlins in 2006, Ross was forced to shave his beard, in order to comply with the Marlins' no-facial- hair policy. Manager Joe Girardi quipped, \\"Maybe he can put it on top of his head.\\" He was used as a backup outfielder but got many starts at all three outfield positions throughout the year, especially from June 10 through 30, July 21 through August 8, and September 11 through the end of the season. On September 11, Ross hit a three-run home run against David Williams and a pair of two-run home runs against Heath Bell and Royce Ring in a 16‚Äì5 win over the New York Mets. His three home runs and seven RBI in the game tied Marlins records. Ross's five home runs and 14 RBI in September were more than he had in any other month that season. In 91 games (250 at bats) with the Marlins in 2006, Ross batted .212 with 53 hits, 11 doubles, 11 home runs, and 37 RBI. 2007 Again a reserve outfielder in 2007, Ross batted .673 before going on the disabled list with a strained left hamstring on May 6. He returned on July 19 and continued to be used in a variety of roles for the Marlins. For much of the year, he platooned with Alfredo Am√©zaga in centerfield. On April 20, he hit his first career pinch-hit home run against Chad Cordero to tie the Marlins with the Washington Nationals in the ninth inning; however, the Marlins went on to lose 6‚Äì5 in 14 innings. Four days later, he homered and had five RBI against Mark Redman in an 11‚Äì6 loss to the Atlanta Braves. He had another pinch-hit home run on August 23 against Brad Thompson in an 11‚Äì3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. In 66 games (173 at bats), Ross hit .335 with 58 hits, 19 doubles, 12 home runs, and 39 RBI. 2008 Florida Marlins in 2008 spring training Ross began 2008 platooning with Am√©zaga again in center field, though Am√©zaga was eventually replaced by Jacque Jones as Ross's centerfield partner. Ross played against left-handed pitchers as Am√©zaga and Jones faced right-handers. Ross struggled in April, batting .159 with no home runs and two RBI. After receiving a text message from his father at the beginning of May saying he would improve, Ross declared that he was restarting his season and had 10 home runs and 18 RBI in the month. During the month, Ross had a stretch where nine out of 10 hits were home runs, becoming the first player to have a streak of that sort since Mark McGwire in 2001. On May 14, he hit a game-tying three-run ninth inning home run against Francisco Cordero in a 10-inning, 7‚Äì6 loss to the Reds. Then, on June 7 he hit a game- winning three-run home run in the bottom of the ninth inning against Cordero to give the Marlins an 8‚Äì7 victory over the Reds. Jones was designated for assignment on June 11, putting Ross in sole control of centerfield. In a four- game series with the Colorado Rockies from July 3 through 6, Ross had 15 RBI, becoming the first player to have that many in a four-game series since Carlton Fisk in 1977. Fourteen of those RBI came from July 4 through 6, the most in a three-game span since Sammy Sosa had 16 in 2002. In 145 games (461 at bats), Ross hit .260 with 120 hits, 29 doubles, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI. 2009 For the first time in his career in 2009, Ross was a starting outfielder for the entire season. He began the year as the right fielder for the Marlins, who wanted prospect Cameron Maybin to play centerfield. On April 26, he pitched a scoreless ninth inning for the Marlins to finish a 13‚Äì2 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. After Maybin batted only .202, Ross moved back to centerfield on May 10 when he was sent down. On June 12, he hit his third grand slam of the season against Brandon League to give the Marlins a 7‚Äì3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. The grand slam tied Bobby Bonilla's and Jeff Conine's record for grand slams in a season by a Marlin. Dan Uggla and he hit back-to-back solo home runs against Kevin Gregg in the ninth inning on August 2 to give the Marlins a 3‚Äì2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On August 16, he set a team record by notching six hits in a doubleheader against the Rockies. Ross returned to right field on August 31 when Maybin was recalled. He set career-highs in most categories in 2009. In 151 games (559 at bats), he batted .270 with 151 hits, 37 doubles, 24 home runs, and 90 RBI. In the daytime, he batted .349, the fourth-highest mark in the NL. Following the season, he was named the Marlins Charlie Hough Good Guy award winner. 2010 Ross began 2010 in right field, but he moved to center field when Maybin was sent down on June 17. He had four hits on April 7 in a 10-inning, 7‚Äì6 victory over the Mets. On May 10, he stole home as part of a double steal with Maybin in a 4‚Äì2 victory over the Cubs, marking the first time a Marlin had stolen home since Reggie Abercrombie did so in 2006. Six days later, he again had four hits in a 10‚Äì8 victory over the Mets. In his first 120 games (452 at bats), Ross batted .265 with 120 hits, 24 doubles, 11 home runs, and 58 RBI. After the Marlins fell out of contention in 2010 and with Ross due for a pay raise the following year, the Marlins put him on waivers in August in order save money and give their young players more playing time. =San Francisco Giants= On August 21, 2010, Ross was awarded to the San Francisco Giants on a waiver claim, partly to prevent him from being acquired by the San Diego Padres. He appeared in 33 regular season games for the Giants, batting .288 with three home runs. In 153 games combined with Florida and San Francisco (525 at bats), he batted .269 with 141 hits, 28 doubles, 14 home runs, and 65 RBI. The Giants went on to overtake the Padres late in the season to win the NL West Division title. Ross was named the Giants' starting right fielder for the playoffs because of a neck injury to Jos√© Guill√©n, according to Bruce Bochy at the start of the postseason. However, it was later revealed that Guill√©n had been left off the roster after a package of human growth hormone was intercepted as it was being shipped to his house. In the ensuing NL Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, Ross started all four games in right field, hit a home run to tie the deciding fourth game, and drove in the winning runs in two of the Giants' three wins. Ross hit two home runs off of Roy Halladay in Game 1 in the following NLCS against the Phillies, and hit a solo home run against Roy Oswalt in Game 2. Following the Giants' Game 6 win of the NLCS, Ross was awarded the MVP award for the series, in which he hit .350 with three home runs, three doubles and recorded five RBI. Three of his five postseason home runs broke up no-hitters. His home run off the Braves' Derek Lowe was the Giants' first hit in Game 4 of the NLDS. His first home run off Halladay in Game 1 of the NLCS, in addition to being the first hit off Halladay in the game, was the first hit off Halladay in 11 innings, as Halladay had thrown a no-hitter in his previous start. Finally, his home run off Oswalt in Game 2 of the NLCS was the Giants' first hit of the game. In Game 3 of the World Series against the Texas Rangers, he hit the first home run for the Giants off Colby Lewis; however, the Giants went on to lose 4‚Äì2. He won his first World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954. In 2011 Ross re-signed with the Giants on a one-year contract worth $6.3 million. Henry Schulman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"mild surprise\\" that Ross did not sign at least a two-year deal. He began the season on the disabled list with a sprained right calf, but he assumed the Giants' right field job upon his return on April 20. On May 10, Ross had a game-ending single against David Hernandez in a 1‚Äì0 victory over the Diamondbacks. After May 10, Ross began playing left field most of the time when Pat Burrell was moved to the bench. On May 18, Ross hit a three-run home run with two outs in the ninth inning against Lance Cormier to give the Giants an 8‚Äì5 victory over the Dodgers. From August through the end of the year, Ross began moving around between all three outfield positions, only once making four straight starts at the same position. He hit the 100th home run of his career against Alex White on September 16 in a 9‚Äì1 victory over Colorado. In the same game, Ross pulled his right hamstring, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. In 121 games (405 at bats), Ross hit .240 with 97 hits, 25 doubles, 14 home runs, and 52 RBI. He led the Giants with a career-high 49 walks. =Boston Red Sox= Boston Red Sox in 2012 On January 26, 2012, Ross finalized a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox. He was supposed to provide depth off the bench, but injuries, particularly to Carl Crawford, led to him holding a starting role for the entire season. He started almost every day for Boston in all three outfield positions, but mainly right field. On April 14, Ross hit his first home run in a Red Sox uniform, a two-run shot off the Tampa Bay Rays's Dane De La Rosa in a 13‚Äì5 Red Sox victory. The next day, Ross hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the second inning off Matt Moore in a 6‚Äì4 victory over the Rays. On May 18, 2012, Ross suffered a fractured foot after fouling a ball off his foot. He was placed on the disabled list and expected to miss from six to eight weeks. On June 19, Ross was activated from the disabled list. His first game back, he hit a home run against Mark Buehrle over the Green Monster at Fenway Park in a 7‚Äì5 victory over the Miami Marlins. Five days later, he hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 9‚Äì4 victory over the Braves. He hit two consecutive three-run home runs against Pedro Hern√°ndez of the White Sox on July 18 in a 10‚Äì1 Red Sox victory. The next day, he hit a three-run home run against Addison Reed for a walk-off win against the White Sox. For the season, he had a .267 average, 127 hits, 34 doubles, 22 home runs, and 81 RBI in 130 games (476 at bats). =Arizona Diamondbacks= On December 22, 2012, Ross agreed to a three-year contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks worth a reported $26 million, with a club option and a $1 million buyout. An injured left calf caused him to miss the beginning of the season; he made his return April 13. He began the 2013 season playing right field, but in May and for the rest of the season he split time between right and left field. On June 19, he hit a pinch-hit three-run home run against Mike Dunn in a 3‚Äì1 victory over the Marlins. He hit a three-run home run against Matt Harvey to put the Diamondbacks ahead 3‚Äì2 on July 3; the Diamondbacks would wind up defeating the Mets 5‚Äì2. Three days later, he set a career high with five hits and added three runs scored in an 11‚Äì1 victory over Colorado. On August 2, he had four hits, two doubles, and three RBI, including a game- winning solo home run against Pedro Beato in a 7‚Äì6 victory over Boston. On August 11, Ross dislocated his right hip while running to first base. He was placed on the disabled list and missed the rest of the season. In 94 games (317 at bats) in 2013, Ross batted .278 with 88 hits, 17 doubles, eight home runs, and 38 RBI. On April 4, 2015, Ross was released by the Diamondbacks. =Oakland Athletics= On April 8, 2015, Ross signed a one-year deal with the Oakland Athletics for the league minimum salary of $507,500, with the Diamondbacks paying the remainder of his salary with them. He was released on May 3, 2015. Post-playing career On May 15, 2016, Ross referred to himself as \\"not playing anymore\\" on his Twitter page. In February 2017, he joined the Giants as a spring training instructor, a role he returned to in 2018. Legacy Ross at the Giants' 2010 World Series victory parade Ross has been a streaky player throughout his career. He described this in 2006: \\"I have gotten in grooves before, and you try to stay in it as long as you can until it ends. And it does end. I've been notorious for that my whole career, where I'll hit five or six in a week, where it seems like I can't miss the pitch and I feel good in the batter's box.\\" The most famous of these came in 2010, when Ross's torrid hitting in the playoffs helped San Francisco win the 2010 World Series. Years later, when asked about the two home runs he hit against Roy Halladay in Game 1 of the 2010 NLCS, Ross recalled an earlier encounter from the same season: Roy Halladay's perfect game against the Marlins, for whom Ross played before being acquired by the Giants. \\"That was one of the most incredible things I've been part of, and I was on the wrong side of it,\\" Ross said. \\"When I hear his name, I still think of him as the toughest pitcher I've ever faced or seen.\\" During his career, Ross has earned a reputation for bringing energy to his teams and being a positive influence to his teammates. He has been a fan favorite in his career, especially in Florida and San Francisco, where he earned the nicknames \\"Toy Cannon\\" and \\"Ross the Boss\\", respectively. Ross bats right-handed and throws left-handed; one of the rarest dominant bats/throws combinations in the history of Major League baseball. The only position player in the Baseball Hall of Fame with this combination of \\"bats/throws\\" is Rickey Henderson, who, like Ross, also had stints with the Dodgers, Red Sox and Athletics. Personal life Ross and his wife, Summer, live most of the year in Scottsdale, Arizona, with their three children: Hudson, Haven Leigh, and Harley. His father, Kenny, played strong safety at the University of New Mexico but became a chiropractor and bull rider after undergoing three knee surgeries in college. Ross has a sister, Sarah, who was a long-jumper and basketball player growing up.

There are numerous types of knitting machines, ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce various types of knitted fabrics, usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity. Pattern stitches can be selected by hand manipulation of the needles, or with push-buttons and dials, mechanical punch cards, or electronic pattern reading devices and computers. Process Six stages in the knitting machine cycle Early flat bed stocking frames had low carbon steel bearded needles where the tips were reflexed and could be depressed onto a hollow closing the loop. The needles were supported on a needle bar (bed) that passed back and forth, to and from the operator. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar. #The needle bar goes forward- the open needles clear the web #The weft thread is laid on the needles #The weft thread falls loosely #The needle bar draws back, the weft is pulled in the open needles #The needle bar draws back, the presser bar drops, the needle loops close and the weft is drawn back through the web #The needles open, a new row has been added to the web which drops under gravity This basic process can still be recognised in all machines, but it has been refined as new technologies have become available. Types Advertisement for a late 19th-century hosiery firm that depicts its factory floor with workers using knitting machines. Published 1886. A few simple devices permit knitting without needles for toy or hobby purposes. The simplest of these is spool knitting, followed by knitting boards or knitting looms, which consist of two rows of pins mounted in two parallel rows approximately apart. Yarn is wound around the pins; various patterns of winding produce different textured knitting. A needle or special tool is then used to transfer the loops of yarn from around the pins, either off the pins or to other pins, to produce the knitting. Knitting boards can produce complex designs. Other semi-mechanical knitting devices are available. To produce larger and more complex knitted items, such as garments, domestic and industrial machines, with either flat or circular beds, producing rectangular or tubular fabrics, respectively, are needed. Double bed machines have two flat beds facing each other, in order to produce purl and plain rib fabrics plus a variety of multi patterns. Ribbing attachments can be added to single bed machines to achieve a similar result. Late 20th century domestic/studio models typically use up to 200 latch-hook needles to hold the stitches in fine, standard, mid-gauge or bulky gauge needle. A carriage or cam box is passed across the bed of needles causing the needle movements required to produce each next stitch. By means of various selection methods, e.g. punch cards, particular needles can be caused to travel by alternate pathways through the cam box. Thus needles will knit or not, and the unknitted yarn portions will lie under (slip stitch) or over the needle or be held in the needle hook (tuck stitch). Needles can be placed in holding position to allow short row shaping. In modern machines, patterns can be obtained via either mechanical control, using punchcards, or electronic control, using computer software for patterning. Modern electronic knitting machines Automatic patterning machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, and have machine stitch patterning features such as slipping, tucking, plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held in such a way that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a ribbed fabric. Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. Current standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit. Domestic knitting machines use the weft knitting method which produces a fabric similar to hand knitting. Knitting proceeds more quickly than in hand knitting, where (usually two) straight needles are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. Knitting machines work an entire row of loops in a single movement. V-bed knitting machines consist of two beds located across from each other. They are called front bed and back bed. This feature allows to hold not only sheets but also tubes. X-bed machines are the advanced version of the V-bed knitting machine. This type of machine adds extra metallic elements which are called holding hooks. These hooks are located above every needle for both front bed and back bed and can only hold loops. If the loop is held by the holding hook, the needle associated with it cannot be used to perform any operations. File:Spool knitting machine.jpgA hobbyist spool knitting machine operates on a crank.

Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a knitting machine. Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with machine knitting but can take a little longer but are still much faster than hand knitting. On a single-bed domestic knitting machines, garter stitch must be either worked by hand using an accessory called a 'garter bar'. Brother machines can take an electronic accessory called a 'Garter Carriage'. These carriages have a single, internally mounted needle which faces those on the main bed, and when a stitch is selected via the patterning mechanism this needle lifts the selected stitch off its needle and makes the stitch through the back, thus creating a purl stitch on the face of the fabric. Certain models of Garter carriages can be used on both mechanical and electronic Brother knitting machines. More complex stitch transfers, such as cable stitches, require hand-manipulation to cross the groups of stitches over each other. Industrial machines that offer selective, automatic stitch transfer between front and back beds along with racking of the beds can create cable stitch automatically. The standard gauge 200-needle machine can knit the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight (4ply UK), while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky knitting machine. Machine knitting saves a considerable amount of time but does require learning to operate the machines correctly. Most if not all hand knitting patterns can be worked up on a machine, either identically or in a similar design, but some are simpler to by hand, whilst others are easier on a machine. Hand knitting patterns are designed to \\"flip\\" the fabric on every row so that the knitter consistently uses the dominant hand. However, machine knitting is consistently knit with the fabric facing the same way. Flat bed machines knit back and forth and circular machines knit continuously in the round.

The disorder is sometimes called cholesterol pneumonia in cases where that lipid is a factor. Signs and symptoms The pneumonia presents as a foreign body reaction causing cough, dyspnea, and often fever. Hemoptysis has also been reported. Causes Sources of such lipids could be either exogenous or endogenous Exogenous: from outside the body. For example, inhaled nose drops with an oil base, or accidental inhalation of cosmetic oil. Amiodarone is an anti-arrythmic known to cause this condition. Oil pulling has also been shown to be a cause. Fire breather's pneumonia from the inhalation of hydrocarbon fuel is a specific variant. At risk populations include the elderly, developmentally delayed or persons with gastroesophageal reflux. Switching to water-soluble alternatives may be helpful in some situations. Endogenous: from the body itself, for example, when an airway is obstructed, it is often the case that distal to the obstruction, lipid-laden macrophages and giant cells fill the lumen of the disconnected airspace. Appearance The gross appearance of a lipid pneumonia is that in which there is an ill-defined, pale yellow area on the lung. This yellow appearance explains the colloquial term \\"golden\\" pneumonia.

He previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Rays of the Major League Baseball (MLB). He is the older brother of Erick Aybar. Professional career =Los Angeles Dodgers= On August 31, 2005, Aybar made his MLB debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers. In his short time on the big league roster, Aybar made strides in impressing then-manager Jim Tracy. In 86 at-bats, Aybar compiled a .326 batting average with 10 runs batted in and 3 stolen bases. After the 2005 season, Aybar was a candidate to start at third base for the Dodgers in 2006. However, in the offseason, the Dodgers signed free agent and former batting champion Bill Mueller as their starting third baseman. After they also signed Ram√≥n Mart√≠nez to join √ìscar Robles in being the primary backups, Aybar found himself out of a job. His .216 batting average during Spring training did not help his cause either. On May 12, 2006, Aybar received another opportunity to be the starting third baseman when Mueller was placed on the 15-day disabled list for arthroscopic knee surgery, he was recalled from the Dodgers Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s. =Atlanta Braves= On July 28, 2006, he was traded to the Braves along with relief pitcher Danys B√°ez for infielder Wilson Betemit. On April 18, 2007, Aybar was suspended indefinitely for unknown reasons. He was first suspended on April 15 for three games for failing to show up for treatments for an injured hand. This was a rare move by the Braves organization, and Aybar's lack of participation caused third baseman Chipper Jones to remark \\"I didn't even know he was still on the team.\\" It was revealed on April 19 that Aybar, according to his agent, had been struggling with \\"drinking and drugs.\\" He had not been heard from for some time and failed to report to New York for a meeting with major league officials Friday, April 20, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It was later revealed that Aybar was seeking help at a drug treatment facility. Aybar was removed from the suspended list on August 4 and was sent to the minor leagues to get in shape for being called up. However, on August 14, he underwent season-ending surgery for a stress fracture in his right hand. =Tampa Bay Rays= On January 17, 2008, Aybar was traded along with Chase Fontaine to the Tampa Bay Rays for Jeff Ridgway. On March 24, 2008, it was announced that he would be the starting third baseman for the 2008 Tampa Bay Rays. He held this position until Evan Longoria was called up early in the season. Aybar then took the role of utility player. He hit a home run in the seventh and deciding game of the ALCS, a 3‚Äì1 Rays victory that sent the franchise to the World Series for the first time. =Independent leagues= Aybar was selected to play for the Edmonton Capitals in the North American League on February 11, 2011. However, he was released by the Capitals due to the Canadian government not granting him a visa. He later joined the Yuma Scorpions in the same Independent league, which was managed by Jose Canseco. =Delfines de Ciudad del Carmen= In 2012, he signed with the Delfines de Ciudad del Carmen in the Mexican Baseball League. =2009 World Baseball Classic= In the 2009 WBC (World Baseball Classic), the Dominican Republic team faced the Netherlands in the first round. After the game went into extra innings, the Dutch team scored on an error made by Aybar, eliminating the heavily-favored Dominican team. Personal life Aybar has been arrested on multiple occasions for assaulting his wife. On January 31, 2008, he was arrested on domestic violence charges for assaulting his wife in the Dominican Republic. In 2010, Aybar was convicted and sentenced to three months in prison for assaulting his wife and violating a restraining order. She had suffered serious injuries and spent some time in an ICU while in critical condition.http://www.raysindex.com/2011/05/now-we-know-why-nobody-signed- willy-aybar-he-was-in-prison.html In June 2011, Aybar was arrested again for allegedly assaulting his wife. According to the police report, Aybar, who has also battled alcohol problems, was found \\"extremely intoxicated\\" at the front entrance of the SeaTac Hilton hotel. Police documents stated they went to Aybar's room, where his wife was crying and holding a bloody towel to her face and had a cut lip and an abrasion on her forehead and cheek.

The book consists of harrowing stories of the Partition of India between the new nations of India and Pakistan.

An appendix contains numerous press and eyewitness accounts of atrocities committed against the refugees during the Partition.

France  In spite of enormous differences in populations, each of the communes of the French Republic possesses a mayor () and a municipal council (), which manage the commune from the mairie (city hall), with exactly the same powers no matter the size of the commune and council. The one exception is the city of Paris, where the city police is in the hands of the central state, not in the hands of the mayor of Paris. This uniformity of status is a clear legacy of the French Revolution, which wanted to do away with the local idiosyncrasies and tremendous differences of status that existed in the kingdom of France. The size of a commune still matters, however, in two domains: French law determines the size of the municipal council according to the population of the commune; and the size of the population determines which voting process is used for the election of the municipal council. =See also= * List of 20 largest French metropolitan areas by population * Lists of communes of France  Hong Kong  Established as the Sanitary Board in 1883, the Municipal Council in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon (including the New Kowloon) provided municipal services to the covered regions in the then British Hong Kong. Partial elections were allowed in 1887, though merely enabling selected persons to vote for members of the Board. The Board was reconstituted in 1935 and hence renamed as Urban Council in the following year after the government had passed the Urban Council Ordinance. Democratisation had been implemented, allowing universal suffrage to happen throughout its development. Two years after the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong, the Council was disbanded in 1999 by the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. All members of the council were elected through universal suffrage by the time of the dissolution. The counterpart of the Municipal Council serving the New Territories (excluding New Kowloon) was the Regional Council established as the Provisional Regional Council in 1986. The functional select committees, district committees, and sub-committees constituted the entire Regional Council. All members were elected from the constituencies and district boards. Both of the Municipal Councils in Hong Kong are now defunct. India * See Nagar Palika for municipalities of India. Jordan Moldova The Municipal Council in Moldova is the governing body in five municipalities: Chi»ôinƒÉu, BƒÉl»õi, Tiraspol and Bendery (also known as Tighina or Bender). The Municipal Council (Moldovan language: Consiliul municipal) serves as a consultative body with some powers of general policy determination. It is composed of a legally determined number of counsellors (for example 35 in BƒÉl»õi) elected every four years, representing political parties and independent counsellors. Once elected, counsellors may form fractions inside of the Municipal Council. Last regional elections of local public administration held in BƒÉl»õi in June 2007, brought to the power the Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova (PCRM), which holds 21 mandates, 11 mandates are held by representatives of other parties, and 3 mandates by independents. There are two fractions in the Municipal Council: PCRM fraction (21 counsellors) and \\"Meleag\\" fraction (3 independent counsellors and 4 representatives of different parties). The Mayor of the municipality is elected for four years. In BƒÉl»õi, Vasile Panciuc (PCRM) is the incumbent from 2001 and was re-elected twice: in 2003 during the anticipated elections (as a result of a new reform of the administrative division in Moldova in 2003), and in 2007. In Chi»ôinƒÉu, the last mayor elections had to be repeated three times, because of the low rate of participation. As a result, Dorin ChirtoacƒÉ (Liberal Party), won the last mayor elections in Chi»ôinƒÉu.  The Netherlands  In the Netherlands the municipal council (Dutch: gemeenteraad) is the elected assembly of the municipality. It consists of between 9 and 45 members (as determined by law) who are elected by the citizens once every four years. The council's main tasks are setting the city's policies and overseeing the execution of those policies by the municipality's executive board.  Norway  The municipal council (), literally municipal board, is the highest governing body of the municipality in Norway. The municipal council sets the scope of municipal activity, takes major decisions, and delegates responsibility. The council is led by a mayor (ordf√∏rer) s divided into an executive council (formannskap) and a number of committees, each responsible for a subsection of tasks. It is not uncommon for some members of the council to sit in the county councils too, but very rare that they also hold legislative (Storting) or Government office, without leave of absence. The municipal council dates back to 1837 with the creation of the Formannskabsdistrikt. In cities the council is often called a city council (bystyre). Taiwan Taipei City Council In the Republic of China, a municipal council represents a special municipality. Members of the councils are elected through municipal elections held every 4‚Äì5 years.

It met in London in the early years of the twentieth century. It was founded by Henry Simpson, a banker. T. E. Hulme helped set up the group in 1908, and was its first secretary. Hulme wrote a charter document: \\"Rules 1908\\". The group comprised mainly amateurs and met once a month, excluding the summer months of July, August, and September, for dinner, the reading of poems, and the presentation of short (20 minute) papers on various topics relating to poetry. Around the end of 1908 Hulme read the Club his A Lecture on Modern Poetry. The Club produced several anthologies; the first two being -- For Christmas MDCCCCVIII (January 1909) and The Book of the Poets' Club (December 1909). Two of Hulme's poems were included in the first, \\"Autumn\\" and \\"A City Sunset,\\" and another two in the second. These are regarded as the first examples of Imagism. In 1909, Hulme began a side-project with F.S. Flint, both a critic and friend of the Poets' Club, called \\"The School of Images,\\" introducing Ezra Pound to the group in April 1909.

From 1848 to 1849 he was assigned to establish a military camp at Laredo, Texas, which was named \\"Camp Crawford.\\" Viele was promoted to first lieutenant on October 26, 1850. He resigned from the service in 1853 to become a civil engineer. He received an appointment as State Engineer of New Jersey in 1855 with a commission to conduct a topographical survey of the state. He also surveyed the environs that would become Central Park in New York City and submitted a design proposal. A competition was held which was awarded to the Greensward Plan from Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux. Viele was appointed engineer-in-chief of Central Park in 1856, and engineer of Prospect Park (also in New York City) in 1860. Viele was a captain in the Engineer Corps of the 7th New York Militia in 1860, and was given a Commission as Brigadier General, U.S. Volunteers, on August 17, 1861, after the Civil War began. He commanded forces on the Savannah River during the Siege of Fort Pulaski and was appointed Military Governor of Norfolk, Virginia, in 1862.

He and his second wife are entombed in a pyramid-shaped mausoleum, guarded by a pair of sphinxes, in the Post Cemetery at West Point, New York. According to an official video about West Point, Viele had a buzzer installed in his coffin wired to the house of the Superintendent of West Point so as to provide rescue if Viele had been accidentally buried alive.

The contest, along with the rest of the fair, is typically scheduled for the fourth week of June. Along with the title of ‚ÄúThe World‚Äôs Ugliest Dog,‚Äù the winner‚Äôs owner receives a check for $1,000 and a trophy. As of 2017, the prize has been increased to $1,500, a trophy and a free trip to New York City. There is significant media coverage, and as many as 2,000‚Äì3,000 people attend the contest during the fair each year. The fair now holds an all-day Dog Lovers' Festival preceding the evening contest. The contest has been going on since the 1970s.Janet Balicki, \\"A look back at Sonoma-Marin Fair's World's Ugliest Dogs\\", The Press Democrat, June 16, 2016. In 2009 the Sonoma-Marin Fair trademarked the phrase World's Ugliest Dog. In 2013, the contest celebrated its 25th anniversary as a fair-produced event, and an anniversary book, World's Ugliest Dogs, was published with text by the contest's producer of seven years, Vicki DeArmon, and photos by photographers who have covered the contest over the years for the fair. Participation Dogs generally come from across the United States but are welcome to enter from around the world. In contrast to conformation shows (which are restricted to purebreds), the World's Ugliest Dog Contest has separate divisions for pedigreed dogs and mutts, with the two winners then competing for the overall prize, and contestants are not judged against any breed specification. Dog owners must provide documentation of veterinarian checks to determine the competing animal is healthy. The Sonoma-Marin Fair has also partnered with animal rights groups such as the Sonoma County Humane Society to educate the public about animals and to provide opportunities to adopt rescue dogs. The fair issues a photo of the winner, a press release summing up the contest, and YouTube video within hours of the contest conclusion. Contestants for each new year are featured on the website before the contest as well in the World's Ugliest Dog Voting Winners Contest winners are recorded since 1976, and include Boomer, a French mastiff, in 1996.\\"Pug-Nosed in Petaluma: Ugly Dogs Get Their Day at Fair\\", The Press Democrat, June 24, 1996. =1999‚Äì2001= Nana, the contest winner for three years between 1996 and 2001 and a previous winner of the mutt division, was a three-pound chihuahua mix with a sidelong walk.Vicki DeArmon, World's Ugliest Dogs: The Official World's Ugliest Dog Contest Book, Guilford, Connecticut: Lyons, 2013, , p. 28.

They were known for straddling noise rock and metal. History After two critically acclaimed singles on Pigboy/Vinyl Solution Records (\\"Fudge Tunnel\\" in 1989, \\"The Sweet Sound of Excess\\" in 1990), they signed to Nottingham's Earache Records. Their debut album was Hate Songs in E Minor, which attracted a large amount of press interest, after the original album artwork was confiscated by the Nottingham Vice Squad. Fudge Tunnel's reputation was built around their massive guitar sound and ironic sense of humour, and were popular with the British music press - at least at first. The band's first release was \\"Single Of The Week\\" in NME magazine in January 1990, with NME declaring \\"Absolutely and totally the best single ever to be released in 1990. Total nine guitar attack-rock\\". The band undertook several European tours in 1991 and 1992 including support slots with Fugazi, Silverfish and The Jesus Lizard, as well as support slots with Swervedriver, Godflesh, and regular performances at popular London venues The Camden Falcon and Camden Underworld. Two more albums were to follow in 1993 (Creep Diets) and 1994 (The Complicated Futility of Ignorance). Newport also was active with Nailbomb, a collaboration with Max Cavalera (Sepultura), who released one studio album and one live album of their Dynamo Open Air Festival performance. After the release of their third studio album, the band split up. David Ryley ran his label BGR Records for a while. Adrian Parkin played with Tubesurfer until 1996 when they too split up, and then returned to being a quantity surveyor in Bolton. Alex Newport went on to pursue a successful career as a producer/mixer and now lives and runs his own studio in New York. He has produced albums by At the Drive-In, The Mars Volta, Bloc Party, City And Colour, and many others. He also formed the band Theory of Ruin, who released one album, Counter Culture Nosebleed and the Frontline Poster Child EP, both on Escape Artist Records and currently is playing in Red Love with Matt Tong.

The station's studios are located in Overland Park, Kansas, while its transmitter is located in Independence, Missouri. History 105.1 was originally the frequency for KKJO-FM in St. Joseph, which is now at the frequency of 105.5. KFME (\\"e105\\"), with its 1980s hits/Hot AC-hybrid format, debuted on June 18, 2001, with \\"You Get What You Give\\" by the New Radicals being the first song.Tim Engle, \\"Radio station makes its debut at 105.1 FM\\", The Kansas City Star, June 19, 2001.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-06-22.pdf The station was re-licensed to Garden City, Missouri (south of Kansas City). The station had modest results. After Susquehanna assumed ownership, KFME flipped to adult hits, and rebranded as \\"105.1 Jack FM\\", on October 7, 2004, at Noon. e105's final song was \\"Don't Speak\\" by No Doubt, while Jack FM's first song was \\"Dancing Queen\\" by ABBA. KFME would later change call letters to KCJK. Jack FM initially debuted with considerable success. Like other Jack stations, KCJK was mostly jockless and stuck to a computerized playlist, highlighted by segments that include the ‚ÄúNo-Request Lunch Hour‚Äù and liners chastising drivers who slow down to see accidents in the opposite set of freeway lanes. KCJK and Susquehanna's properties were acquired by Cumulus Media in May 2006. Upon taking over the station, Cumulus added live disc jockeys, a rare move for an adult hits outlet.

(, \\"those with the same goal\\") was a Hutu militia in Rwanda formed in 1992. Together with the Interahamwe militia, which formed earlier and had more members, the Impuzamugambi was responsible for many of the deaths of Tutsis and moderate Hutus during the Genocide against the Tutsi of 1994. While the Interahamwe was led by prominent figures in the ruling party National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (Mouvement r√©publicain national pour la d√©mocratie et le d√©veloppement, MRND), the Impuzamugambi was controlled by the leadership of the Coalition for the Defense of the Republic (Coalition pour la D√©fense de la R√©publique, CDR) and recruited its members from the youth wing of the CDR. The CDR was a separate Hutu party which cooperated with the MRND, though it had a significantly more extreme ethnically Pro-Hutu and Anti-Tutsi agenda than the MRND. The smaller Impuzamugambi was less organized than the Interahamwe, but it was responsible for a large portion of genocidal deaths. Like the Interahamwe, the Impuzamugambi was trained and equipped by the Rwandan Government Forces (RGF) and the Presidential Guard of Rwanda's president and MRND leader Juv√©nal Habyarimana. When the genocide started in April 1994, the Interahamwe and the Impuzamugambi acted in close collaboration and largely merged their structures and activities, though some distinction was still evident in differences in their clothing. Some g√©nocidaires participated with both militias in the killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutu. After the main period of genocide, members of both militias as well as large parts of the Hutu population fled from Rwanda to the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of the leadership of the CDR, Hassan Ngeze and Jean Bosco Barayagwiza were greatly responsible for commanding the Impuzamugambi. Both were found guilty in 2003 by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda of planning and leading the genocide, incitement of genocide, and crimes against humanity. They were both sentenced to life imprisonment. The sentence against Barayagwiza was later reduced to 35 years due to a partial violation of due process. After deducting time already served, he would have stayed in prison for at least 27 years but later died.

Note the curved handle on the side for manual operation. A bolt is the part of a repeating, breech-loading firearm that blocks the rear opening (breech) of the barrel chamber while the propellant burns, and moves back and forward to facilitate loading/unloading of cartridges from the magazine. The extractor and firing pin are often integral parts of the bolt. In gas-operated firearms, the bolt itself is housed within the larger bolt carrier group (BCG), which contains additional parts that receives rearward push from the gas piston. The slide of a semi- automatic pistol is a form of bolt, as it contains the same parts and serves the same functions. Description In manually operated firearms, such as bolt-action, lever-action, and pump-action rifles and shotguns, the bolt is held fixed by its locking lugs during firing, forcing all the expanding gas forward, and is manually withdrawn to chamber another round. In an automatic or semi-automatic firearm, the bolt cycles back and forward between each shot, propelled by recoil or expanding gas (back) or the recoil spring (forward). When it moves back, the extractor pulls the spent casing from the chamber. Once the case is clear of the chamber, the ejector kicks the case out of the firearm. When the bolt moves forward, it strips a cartridge from the magazine and pushes it into the chamber. The most common locking mechanism on rifles is a rotating bolt, which can be classified as a rigid type of bolt lock. Semi- rigid bolt locks have their locking elements movably mounted on either the bolt, barrel or breech housing. Examples of semi-rigid bolt locks are roller locked bolts, or ball bearings as on Heym SR 30 or Ansch√ºtz 1827 Fortner (both straight-pull rifles).  Closed bolt vs. open bolt  In a closed bolt firearm, the bolt is in its foremost position upon firing. This is opposed to an open bolt firearm where the bolt is held rearward and pulling the trigger releases it to slam forward and fire the cartridge.

Orphaned at age two, he lacked any formal education. He became a successful businessman, developing the D.H. Holmes department store business in New Orleans in 1842 and opening the store in 1849. It was the largest in the South, with more than 700 employees. Early life and education Daniel Henry Holmes was born in 1816 in Clermont County, Ohio, and orphaned at age two. Although he did not receive a formal education, he started as a child to work in retail stores and developed ideas to improve them. Career Holmes made his way to New Orleans, working on riverboats. He eventually went into business for himself in 1842 with his retail company, and built the D.H. Holmes department store in 1849 on Canal Street in New Orleans, at the edge of the French Quarter. The city was booming and prosperous, buoyed by its port, from where it exported cotton to Great Britain and France, and by its large slave market and associated businesses. Holmes borrowed ideas from the pioneering department stores in England and Paris, such as Le Bon March√©, as well as major New York City retailers. Department stores were a new way of doing business that appealed to many shoppers, and the D.H. Holmes store became a city landmark. In Holmes' many trips by steamboat between New York and New Orleans in the early 1850s, the businessman frequently journeyed by the Ohio River and was attracted to Covington, Kentucky, as a rest stop. Holmes bought land in the Kenton County area known as Buena Vista; in 1866, he began to build the home of his dreams. He named the three-story, English-gothic castle as Holmesdale. The 32-room mansion was built on about . Holmes divided his time between Holmesdale, a home in France, and an apartment in New Orleans. By his death in 1898, Holmes had become fluent in the French, German, and Spanish languages. His New Orleans department store was the largest in the South, with more than 700 employees. Holmes often said he owed his success as a businessman to his commitment to selling only the best merchandise. He traveled extensively across the country and to Europe, searching out the products he sold. Holmes died on July 3, 1898, while on a business trip to New York. His personal estate was valued at more than $1.2 million. Holmes' obituary ran on the front page of The Kentucky Post on July 4, 1898. The article termed Holmes, the \\"king of New Orleans retailers\\" and the ‚Äúrichest man in Covington.‚Äù In 1919 the Holmes family sold the Holmesdale mansion to the Covington Board of Education for $50,000. The site is now part of the Holmes Junior/Senior High School campus. D.H. Holmes in New Orleans was bought by Dillard's in 1989, becoming part of a chain. The original store on Canal Street was sold and redeveloped as a boutique hotel, opening in 1995 as Chateau Sonesta. It was renovated in 2012 and is now the Hyatt French Quarter Hotel.

It was established in the early 19th century by European-American settlers who brought along or bought enslaved African Americans to develop the area's cotton plantations. The African Americans built houses and churches that still stand. Agriculture is still the most important element of the rural economy, focused on the cultivation and processing of cotton. This has been the commodity crop since the antebellum years, when its cultivation depended on slave labor. As of 2006, cotton was processed in one cotton-processing plant in the community. Nutbush is best known as the birthplace and childhood home of singer Tina Turner, who described the town in her 1973 song \\"Nutbush City Limits\\". In 2002, a segment of Tennessee State Route 19 near Nutbush was named \\"Tina Turner Highway\\" in her honor. This is also the home town of blues pioneer musicians and recording artists Hambone Willie Newbern and Sleepy John Estes.A History of Tennessee Arts, University of Tennessee Press Demographics In 2000, the population of the Nutbush voting precinct (TN 3976) was 259. Of those, 42 were White (16.22%), 215 Black (82.01%), and two were of another ethnicity (0.77%). At that time 190 people (73.36%) were aged 18 or older.Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Economy Cotton processing in Nutbush (2004) The community's main source of income is agriculture (especially cotton). After the abolition of slavery, freedmen worked at sharecropping as the primary means of income. They cultivated plots of land, mostly for growing cotton, in return for paying a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have superseded manual cultivation; many farm workers left the area for cities during the Great Migration of the early 20th century. As of 2006, one cotton-processing plant in Nutbush is the only agricultural industry in the community. Lagoon Creek Peaking Facility is run by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in Nutbush.

History Scenic view onto Tennessee State Route 19 (2004) The Nutbush community was established in the early 19th century by settlers from Virginia and North Carolina. Descended from immigrants from England, they traveled westward to the Mississippi River delta in western Tennessee. They developed this area for cotton and were dependent on the use of slave labor.The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, Rutledge Press These settlers founded Trinity United Methodist Church in 1822. During the slavery years, black enslaved people were forced to attend the church under white supervision. During and after the Civil War, more than 50 Civil War soldiers, both Confederate and Union, were buried in the Trinity Cemetery associated with the church. The Trinity Cemetery is mentioned on the Rootsweb Internet site as one of the best-kept cemeteries in the county.http://www.rootsweb.com Rootsweb - Haywood County, TN Genealogy The community also had Woodlawn Church, which was limited to whites and is no longer active. Under antebellum state law, most black congregations had to be ministered by white pastors. In 1846, Hardin Smith, who was from Virginia, was allowed to preach to a black congregation at an evening service at the white Woodlawn Church; it was the first time an area congregation was pastored by an enslaved person.Norris, Sharon, Black America Series: Haywood County Tennessee, Arcadia Publishing, 2000, p. 8 Woodlawn Baptist Church (2007) After the American Civil War, the Woodlawn Missionary Baptist Church was established in 1866 by Hardin Smith and other freedmen of the community, aided by some members of the white Woodlawn Baptist Church.

Martin (congressman). Charles Henry Martin (October 1, 1863September 22, 1946) was an American Army officer and later politician in the state of Oregon. A native of Illinois, he had a 40-year career in the military including serving in conflicts from the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War to World War I before retiring as a major general. A Democrat, he was the U.S. Representative for Oregon's 3rd congressional district from 1931 to 1935 and then was the state's 21st Governor from 1935 to 1939. Biography =Early life= Martin in 1922 Charles Martin was born near Albion, Illinois, on October 1, 1863. He attended Ewing College (Ewing, Illinois) for two years until he was appointed to the U.S. Military Academy. He would actively serve in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and Boxer Rebellion after graduating from West Point in 1887. In 1920, when the army's authority to maintain Jim Crow regulations seemed threatened, Martin wrote that \\"the negro is of very little importance... the average negro is not by any means equal to the average white man.\\"CHM to Col. H.A. Smith, April 6, 1920, file 127-25, US Army Military History Institute, Carlisle Barracks, Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Martin was later a division commander of the famous Blackhawk Division and the U.S. V Corps in the Argonne during World War I and served as the U.S. Army Assistant Chief of Staff from 1922 to 1924. He was honored with the Distinguished Service Medal and two citations for bravery in action and retired from the Army as a major general on October 1, 1927, after commanding the Panama Canal Department for three years. =Congressman and Governor= Bust of Martin in the Governor's Office in the Oregon State Capitol in Salem Martin embarked on his second career after retiring to Portland, Oregon with his wife. From March 4, 1931, to January 3, 1935, he served as a conservative Democratic Representative to the U.S. Congress from Oregon's Third Congressional District. Martin was elected governor in 1934, during a time of intense labor turmoil and the middle of the Great Depression, earning a reputation for restoring state finances. The major issues that Martin dealt with during his time in office were economic recovery from the Great Depression, reconstruction of the Oregon State Capitol, the planning and construction of the Bonneville Dam, and the development of statewide port and highway infrastructures. When the Depression eased, he opposed the full restoration of wage levels for state employees, who had suffered a 50 percent pay cut. Martin became known as a pro-business governor in early May 1935 when timber workers began to strike, declaring, \\"These pestiferous peewees would go to any lengths to embarrass me and my administration.\\"CHM to Walter E. Pearson, May 16, 1935, Box 3, CHM, Oregon Historical Society. In private correspondence and public appearances he railed against the National Labor Relations Board, declared union organizers to be gangsters and Bolsheviks, and considered Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins to be the head \\"red\\" in the Roosevelt administration. Martin threatened to fire Columbia County Sheriff Oscar Weed for not responding harshly enough to striking workers, instructing the state's sheriffs to \\"beat hell out of 'em!\\" and \\"crack their damn heads! Those fellows are there for nothing but trouble ‚Äì give it to them!\\"Richard L. Neuberger, \\"Our Promised Land\\" (New York: Macmillan, 1938) On May 23, 1935, Martin ordered the state police and National Guard to protect strikebreakers at the Stimson Mill strike in the Washington County town of Gaston. The National Guard was again called out to harass, intimidate, and arrest striking longshoremen in 1937. Martin grew in his vocal opposition to Roosevelt's New Deal, especially to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the President's labor policy. In 1937, the NLRB failed to settle a jurisdictional dispute between the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL) that had closed all Portland sawmills. Martin stepped in and held his own elections, which led to the reopening of the mills. He made himself the enemy of what many saw as corrupt labor leaders, particularly by his appointment of Assistant Attorney General Ralph E. Moody to prosecute many union people accused of arson and assault. He was often quoted for his rephrasing of President Roosevelt's famous pronouncement on fear, saying, \\"We have nothing to fear from the future except our own foolishness and slothfulness.\\" His criticism of President Roosevelt, however, cost Martin a bitterly contested bid for the Democratic Party of Oregon's gubernatorial nomination in 1938. =Death and legacy= After losing the nomination, Martin retired from active politics to his Portland home. He died on September 22, 1946, and was interred at River View Cemetery in Portland. Footnotes Further reading * Alfred F. Gunns, Civil Liberties in Crisis: The Pacific Northwest, 1917‚Äì1940.

Aviv was employed by Pan Am in 1989 to investigate who had bombed Pan Am Flight 103. He says that he received the information from people who were involved directly and indirectly. In his report, he claimed that US agents had been monitoring a heroin-smuggling route operating from the Middle East to the United States, which was run by a Syrian criminal. Aviv said that the Syrians had ties to Hezbollah militants who were holding Westerners hostage in Beirut. According to Aviv, US agents agreed to allow the heroin smuggling to continue in return for help in freeing the hostages. At some point Turkish extremists, who worked at Frankfurt Airport as baggage handlers, swapped a suitcase of heroin for a bomb. The President's Commission on Aviation Security and Terrorism examined these allegations in 1989 and found \\"no foundation for speculation in press accounts that U.S. government officials had participated tacitly or otherwise in any supposed operation at Frankurt Airport having anything to do with the sabotage of Flight 103.\\"Steven Emerson. \\"PanAm Scam\\" , American Journalism Review, September 1992.

They found several documents, including a memo from the FBI from 1982 and an informant agreement between Aviv and the US Justice Department, which refer to a past association with Israeli intelligence. He has been used as a source by publications such as the New York Times and by news networks Fox News Channel and ABC News. Involvement in Vengeance In 1981, Canadian writer George Jonas was approached by Collins Canada about meeting with Aviv, who claimed to have been involved in Operation Wrath of God, an operation to assassinate the Palestinian militants who carried out the 1972 Munich massacre, in which they took hostage and killed 11 Israeli athletes.George Jonas \\"The Spielberg Massacre\\" , Macleans, January 7, 2006. In a joint deal, two Toronto-based publishing houses, Lester & Orpen Dennys and Collins Canada Ltd, commissioned Jonas to research and write Aviv's account. Vengeance (1984) depicted Aviv's character as \\"Avner\\", though that is in dispute.Description of Vengeance on Jonas's website . According to Maclean's, which put together an 11-person investigative team to find out whether Aviv's story was true, the book generated $500,000 in advance foreign sales. After his book was published, Jonas told a journalist for Maclean's that he had spent two years and $30,000 of the publishers' money conducting research in Europe and Israel.Robert Miller. \\"The 'Vengeance' Affair,\\" Macleans, May 7, 1984. American RadioWorks, the national documentary unit of American Public Media, looked into the allegations as well and noted several court documents, including a memo from the FBI from 1982 and an informant agreement between Aviv and the US Justice Department, both of which refer to a past association with Israeli intelligence. In 1984, Jonas, Louise Dennys, and the president of Collins Canada, Nicholas Harris, told Maclean's they were satisfied that the story was genuine. Jonas told Maclean's: \\"To my mind, if he [Aviv] is not legit, then he can only be a disgruntled ex-employee of Mossad with sufficient knowledge of what has gone down in this area. As far as I am concerned, if he is not who he says he is, then that is what he is.\\" In 1986, the book was adapted as a made- for-television movie, Sword of Gideon, starring Steven Bauer and Michael York.\\"Sword of Gideon\\", IMDb.

Gameplay Fired Ups Campaign mode is set in an unnamed eastern European country that has been invaded by a neighbouring country only known as \\"The Republic\\". The player plays as a fighter for a resistance army in several different vehicles. The player can take on the subsequent missions, whenever they please, otherwise they can find yellow scavenge tokens which, for each 10 tokens collected, will unlock new secondary weapons, which the player can then use against AI enemies that spawn to attack the player. These weapons include grenades, heavy missiles, and laser. There are also turrets around the map for the player to use. Also available are challenges, taking in the form of large trucks that roam the city. Upon destruction of one, the player must seek and eliminate the required number of enemies before the allocated time elapses. For every level of challenge complete, more, and better, health and armor pickups will spawn for the player to collect. = Multiplayer = Fired Up features a multiplayer mode which supports up to eight players, through ad- hoc. The host can choose a variety of maps (some available as downloadable content), and game modes. Prior to the game starting, players can choose their preferred vehicle; the selection includes resistance and republic vehicles from the Campaign mode.  Modes  *Deathmatch - Straight up vehicular brawl. Weapons vary on the map for which the players can use against their opponents. Also includes Team Deathmatch. *Team Capture the Flag - Players must grab the enemies' flag and return it to their base to score a point. Be wary as the enemy will do the same. *King of the Hill - A point is to be contested by all players. The winner is the one who has stayed in the hill the longest. Also includes Team King of the Hill. *Team Bomb the Base - Players must pick up explosives, spawning randomly across the map, and deliver them to the enemy's base. Ownership of bombs are carried over to players who kill enemy bomb carriers. *Assimilation - All players begin 'infected' but can find and pickup 'Antidote' pickups to cure them. The infected must then re-infect those by finding and either contact or kill. The last remaining player to be infected wins. *Race - The map is modified into a circuit and the first player to cross the finish line, is the winner. Along the way are items for the player to use, but they may either help or hinder the player in some way.  Other features  The game also features game sharing to allow those to provide a 'demo' version of the game to those who do not own a copy. Also included is a Wipeout Pure demo.

The inability of an eye to turn outward and results in a convergent strabismus or esotropia of which the primary symptom is diplopia (commonly known as double vision) in which the two images appear side-by-side. Thus the diplopia is horizontal and worse in the distance. Diplopia is also increased on looking to the affected side and is partly caused by overaction if the medial rectus on the unaffected side as it tries to provide the extra innervation to the affected lateral rectus. These two muscles are synergists or \\"yoke muscles\\" as both attempt to move the eye over to the left or right. The condition is commonly unilateral but can also occur bilaterally. The unilateral abducens nerve palsy is the most common of the isolated ocular motor nerve palsies. Signs and symptoms abduction of the right eye. This individual tries to look to his right, but the right eye fails to turn to the side. The nerve dysfunction induces esotropia, a convergent squint on distance fixation. On near fixation the affected individual may have only a latent deviation and be able to maintain binocularity or have an esotropia of a smaller size. Patients sometimes adopt a face turned towards the side of the affected eye, moving the eye away from the field of action of the affected lateral rectus muscle, with the aim of controlling diplopia and maintaining binocular vision. Diplopia is typically experienced by adults with VI nerve palsies, but children with the condition may not experience diplopia due to suppression. The neuroplasticity present in childhood allows the child to 'switch off' the information coming from one eye, thus relieving any diplopic symptoms. Whilst this is a positive adaptation in the short term, in the long term it can lead to a lack of appropriate development of the visual cortex giving rise to permanent visual loss in the suppressed eye; a condition known as amblyopia. Cause Because the nerve emerges near the bottom of the brain, it is often the first nerve compressed when there is any rise in intracranial pressure. Different presentations of the condition, or associations with other conditions, can help to localize the site of the lesion along the VIth cranial nerve pathway. The most common causes of VIth nerve palsy in adults are: *More common: Vasculopathic (diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis), trauma, idiopathic. *Less common: Increased intracranial pressure, giant cell arteritis, cavernous sinus mass (e.g. meningioma, Brain stem Glioblastoma aneurysm, metastasis), multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis/vasculitis, postmyelography, lumbar puncture, stroke (usually not isolated), Chiari Malformation, hydrocephalus, intracranial hypertension, tuberculosis meningitis. In children, Harley reports typical causes as traumatic, neoplastic (most commonly brainstem glioma), as well as idiopathic. Sixth nerve palsy causes the eyes to deviate inward (see: Pathophysiology of strabismus). Vallee et al. report that benign and rapidly recovering isolated VIth nerve palsy can occur in childhood, sometimes precipitated by ear, nose and throat infections. Pathophysiology The pathophysiological mechanism of sixth nerve palsy with increased intracranial pressure has traditionally been said to be stretching of the nerve in its long intracranial course, or compression against the petrous ligament or the ridge of the petrous temporal bone. Collier, however, was ‚Äúunable to accept this explanation‚Äù, his view being that since the sixth nerve emerges straight forward from the brain stem, whereas other cranial nerves emerge obliquely or transversely, it is more liable to the mechanical effects of backward brain stem displacement by intracranial space occupying lesions. =Brainstem= Isolated lesions of the VI nerve nucleus will not give rise to an isolated VIth nerve palsy because paramedian pontine reticular formation fibers pass through the nucleus to the opposite IIIrd nerve nucleus. Thus, a nuclear lesion will give rise to an ipsilateral gaze palsy. In addition, fibers of the seventh cranial nerve wrap around the VIth nerve nucleus, and, if this is also affected, a VIth nerve palsy with ipsilateral facial palsy will result. In Millard-Gubler syndrome, a unilateral softening of the brain tissue arising from obstruction of the blood vessels of the pons involving sixth and seventh cranial nerves and the corticospinal tract, the VIth nerve palsy and ipsilateral facial paresis occur with a contralateral hemiparesis.; English translation in Foville's syndrome can also arise as a result of brainstem lesions which affect Vth, VIth and VIIth cranial nerves. =Subarachnoid space= As the VIth nerve passes through the subarachnoid space it lies adjacent to anterior inferior and posterior inferior cerebellar and basilar arteries and is therefore vulnerable to compression against the clivus. Typically palsies caused in this way will be associated with signs and symptoms of headache and/or a rise in ICP. =Petrous apex= The nerve passes adjacent to the mastoid sinus and is vulnerable to mastoiditis, leading to inflammation of the meninges, which can give rise to Gradenigo's syndrome. This condition results in a VIth nerve palsy with an associated reduction in hearing ipsilaterally, plus facial pain and paralysis, and photophobia. Similar symptoms can also occur secondary to petrous fractures or to nasopharyngeal tumours. =Cavernous sinus/Superior orbital fissure= The nerve runs in the sinus body adjacent to the internal carotid artery and oculo-sympathetic fibres responsible for pupil control, thus, lesions here might be associated with pupillary dysfunctions such as Horner's syndrome. In addition, III, IV, V1, and V2 involvement might also indicate a sinus lesion as all run toward the orbit in the sinus wall. Lesions in this area can arise as a result of vascular problems, inflammation, metastatic carcinomas and primary meningiomas. =Orbit= The VIth nerve's course is short and lesions in the orbit rarely give rise to isolated VIth nerve palsies, but more typically involve one or more of the other extraocular muscle groups. Diagnosis =Differential diagnoses= Differential diagnosis is rarely difficult in adults. Onset is typically sudden with symptoms of horizontal diplopia. Limitations of eye movements are confined to abduction of the affected eye (or abduction of both eyes if bilateral) and the size of the resulting convergent squint or esotropia is always larger on distance fixation - where the lateral recti are more active - than on near fixation - where the medial recti are dominant. Abduction limitations that mimic VIth nerve palsy may result secondary to surgery, to trauma or as a result of other conditions such as myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease. In children, differential diagnosis is more difficult because of the problems inherent in getting infants to cooperate with a full eye movement investigation. Possible alternative diagnosis for an abduction deficit would include: 1. Mobius syndrome - a rare congenital disorder in which both VIth and VIIth nerves are bilaterally affected giving rise to a typically 'expressionless' face. 2. Duane syndrome - A condition in which both abduction and adduction are affected arising as a result of partial innervation of the lateral rectus by branches from the IIIrd oculomotor cranial nerve. 3. Cross fixation which develops in the presence of infantile esotropia or nystagmus blockage syndrome and results in habitual weakness of lateral recti. 4. Iatrogenic injury. Abducens nerve palsy is also known to occur with halo orthosis placement. The resultant palsy is identified through loss of lateral gaze after application of the orthosis and is the most common cranial nerve injury associated with this device. Management The first aims of management should be to identify and treat the cause of the condition, where this is possible, and to relieve the patient's symptoms, where present. In children, who rarely appreciate diplopia, the aim will be to maintain binocular vision and, thus, promote proper visual development. Thereafter, a period of observation of around 6 months is appropriate before any further intervention, as some palsies will recover without the need for surgery. =Symptom relief and/or binocular vision maintenance= This is most commonly achieved through the use of fresnel prisms. These slim flexible plastic prisms can be attached to the patient's glasses, or to plano glasses if the patient has no refractive error, and serve to compensate for the inward misalignment of the affected eye. Unfortunately, the prism only correct for a fixed degree of misalignment and, because the affected individual's degree of misalignment will vary depending upon their direction of gaze, they may still experience diplopia when looking to the affected side. The prisms are available in different strengths and the most appropriate one can be selected for each patient. However, in patients with large deviations, the thickness of the prism required may reduce vision so much that binocularity is not achievable. In such cases it may be more appropriate simply to occlude one eye temporarily. Occlusion would never be used in infants though both because of the risk of inducing stimulus deprivation amblyopia and because they do not experience diplopia. Other management options at this initial stage include the use of botulinum toxin, which is injected into the ipsilateral medial rectus (botulinum toxin therapy of strabismus). The use of BT serves a number of purposes. Firstly, it helps to prevent the contracture of the medial rectus which might result from its acting unopposed for a long period. Secondly, by reducing the size of the deviation temporarily it might allow prismatic correction to be used where this was not previously possible, and, thirdly, by removing the pull of the medial rectus it may serve to reveal whether the palsy is partial or complete by allowing any residual movement capability of the lateral rectus to operate. Thus, the toxin works both therapeutically, by helping to reduce symptoms and enhancing the prospects for fuller ocular movements post-operatively, and diagnostically, by helping to determine the type of operation most appropriate for each patient. A Cochrane Review on interventions for eye movement disorders due to acquired brain injury, last updated June 2017, identified one study of botulinum toxin for acute sixth nerve palsy. The Cochrane review authors judged this to be low-certainty evidence; the study was not masked and the estimate of effect was imprecise. =Longer term management= If adequate recovery has not occurred after the 6 month period (during which observation, prism management, occlusion, or botulinum toxin may be considered), surgical treatment is often recommended. If the residual esotropia is small, or if the patient is unfit or unwilling to have surgery, prisms can be incorporated into their glasses to provide more permanent symptom relief. When the deviation is too large for prismatic correction to be effective, permanent occlusion may be the only option for those unfit or unwilling to have surgery. =Surgery= The procedure chosen will depend upon the degree to which any function remains in the affected lateral rectus. Where there is complete paralysis, the preferred option is to perform vertical muscle transposition procedures such as Jensen's, Hummelheim's or whole muscle transposition, with the aim of using the functioning inferior and superior recti to gain some degree of abduction. An alternative approach is to operate on both the lateral and medial rectii of the affected eye, with the aim of stabilising it at the midline, thus giving single vision straight ahead but potentially diplopia on both far left and right gaze. This procedure is often most appropriate for those with total paralysis who, because of other health problems, are at increased risk of the anterior segment ischaemia associated with complex multi-muscle transposition procedures. Where some function remains in the affected eye, the preferred procedure depends upon the degree of development of muscle sequelae. In a sixth nerve palsy one would expect that, over the 6 month observation period, most patients would show the following pattern of changes to their ocular muscle actions: firstly, an overaction of the medial rectus of the affected eye, then an overaction of the medial rectus of the contraletral eye and, finally, an underaction of the lateral rectus of the unaffected eye - something known as an inhibitional palsy. These changes serve to reduce the variation in the misalignment of the two eyes in different gaze positions (incomitance). Where this process has fully developed, the preferred option is a simple recession, or weakening, of the medial rectus of the affected eye, combined with a resection, or strengthening, of the lateral rectus of the same eye. However, where the inhibitional palsy of the contralateral lateral rectus has not developed, there will still be gross incomitance, with the disparity between the eye positions being markedly greater in the field of action of the affected muscle. In such cases recession of the medial rectus of the affected eye is accompanied by recession and/or posterior fixation (Fadenoperation) of the contraleral medial rectus. The same approaches are adopted bilaterally where both eyes have been affected.

Patronage Born at Usk in what is now Monmouthshire (Syr Fynwy), south-east Wales, Adam received the patronage of Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March, who inherited the Lordship of Usk (Brynbuga) through his wife Philippa. Mortimer encouraged and enabled Adam to eventually study at Oxford, where he obtained his doctorate and became extraordinarius in Canon law. Adam settled at the University of Oxford as a teacher of law. Here by his own admission he was involved in armed struggle in 1388 and 1389 between the Northerners and the Southerners, which included the Welsh. Adam left Oxford and practised his profession for seven years as an advocate in the archiepiscopal court of Canterbury, 1390‚Äì1397, sitting on the Parliament of 1397. In 1399 he accompanied the Archbishop and Bolingbroke's army on the march from Bristol to Chester. These experiences and the connection with Thomas Arundel shaped his views thereafter. He was hostile in his chronicle to Richard II, was a member of the commission appointed to find secure legal grounds for his deposition, and met with the King during his captivity in the Tower of London. Adam was rewarded for his part in Richard II's surrender, imprisonment and fall by being granted the living of Kemsing and Seal, and later made a prebend in the church of Bangor. These nicely supplemented his professional legal income and status. However one living, his title to the prebend of Llandygwydd in Cardiganshire given under the college of Abergwili, was contested by one Walter Jakes, alias Ampney, who had obtained it by exchange in 1399. The two were in an affray, in Westminster, in November 1400, which resulted in charges being brought against Adam and his company for highway robbery. The outcome is unknown, however it did not immediately limit his legal activities, as he continued as a lawyer. Adam was strongly devoted to Saint Teilo (associated with Llandaff Cathedral) and to Saint Thomas of India, whose cult had been vitalised by Dominican missions in Asia. Rome However, Adam forfeited the King's favour and was either effectively banished or chose to leave England for Rome in February 1402 with the sanction of the Crown, having begged for the King's pardon for the Westminster misdeed, which pardon was granted in January 1403. There Adam realised he could impress other influential people. Once in Rome he met Pope Boniface IX and Pope Innocent VII, both of whom were sufficiently impressed to offer him English bishoprics in 1404. He was later successively nominated to the sees of Hereford and St David's, but was unable to obtain possession of either. Antipope Benedict XIII also nominated him to Llandaff. Events outside his influence or control took over. The rebellion of Owain Glynd≈µr was enveloping Wales and focusing attention from England. In the summer of 1405 riots swept Rome, driving the Pope from the city in August, stranding Adam and leaving him far from home, separated from patronage and exacerbated by Adam's own dangerous illness, suffered probably as a result. Adam left Rome in June 1406, making his way to Bruges. Here he attended closely to events in Wales and England and again developed his legal work, in France and Flanders this time. He listened to the plans of Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, to overthrow King Henry IV, but adroitly avoided any implication, involvement or commitment to either side. In 1408 Adam was ready to return to Wales, landed at Barmouth, and hoped to secure the Lordship of Powis, then held by Edward Cherleton ‚Äì whose first wife's dower had included the Lordship of Usk. Adam lived under Cherleton's protection for some years at this period, as a poor Chaplain at Welshpool. Legacy In March 1411 Adam was granted a royal pardon, which should have signalled his return to influence. However, in 1414 Thomas Arundel died and a major patron's influence was removed. Adam spent the rest of his life and career in relative obscurity. In 1423 he was the incumbent of St Cybi's Church, Llangybi, Monmouthshire, near his birthplace. He died in 1430 and was buried in the priory church at Usk, where his epitaph, composed in Welsh cywydd metre, can still be seen. His will, also preserved, includes bequests to Llandaff Cathedral and to friaries in Newport and Cardiff as well as to individual persons bearing Welsh names. He makes a legacy to his executor and one to a relative, one Edward ab Adam, quite a telling gift: Adam's own copy of Ranulf Higden's Polychronicon, maybe his own inspiration as a young boy. With it he must have left the material that formed his chronicle to 1421, which twenty years later was put in manuscript form. This chronicle is his major legacy, providing contemporary detail on events in Wales, England and abroad and an insight into the life of an educated man moving through important spheres of influence at the time. He met Kings and Popes, chronicled the Peasants' Revolt (the chronicle opens with a description of Jack Straw) and the Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos's Christmas visit to Richard II, lived in various cities and towns, but was often on the move. Observant of phenomena from his youth, Adam is struck by the beauty of Lake Lucerne and the quality of Beaune wine, but draws a pessimistic conclusion about the night- time behaviour of Rome's canine population. He offered a useful interpretation of the history of his times. The chronicle throws particular light on the Owain Glynd≈µr revolt. The interest of the content is generally far superior to the Latinity of the work. The Chronicle survives in a single manuscript. At some point, the final quire of the manuscript became separated from the manuscript. This was discovered in 1885 at Belvoir Castle, where it remains. The main manuscript is in the British Library (Add. MS 10104).

Benjamin was the first Assyrian-American to be elected to the United States House of Representatives in American history. Benjamin served in the Indiana Senate from 1971 to 1977, the Indiana House of Representatives from 1967 to 1971, and was a member of the Democratic Party. Early life and career Born to an Assyrian father, Adam Benjamin and mother, Margaret Marjanian, in Gary, Indiana, on August 6, 1935, Adam Benjamin Jr. graduated from Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri, in 1952. Benjamin joined the Marine Corps in 1952, and served as a Corporal in the Korean War until he was honorably discharged in 1954. After serving in the Marine Corps, he gained an appointment to the United States Military Academy, West Point, New York, earning a B.S. degree in engineering in 1958. Following three years in the 101st airborne division the \\"Screaming Eagles\\", and ranger training in the U.S. Army, in 1961 Benjamin left the Army as a First lieutenant. After his service in the Military, Benjamin returned to Gary in 1961 and began teaching math and physics at Edison High School.

During his work in public service, Benjamin worked on his law degree from Valparaiso University, he graduated with his Juris Doctor and was admitted to the Indiana Bar Association in 1966. Shortly after Benjamin was admitted to the Indiana Bar, he ran for a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives, winning two consecutive terms in 1966, and in 1968. Benjamin served in the Indiana House until he won a seat in the Indiana Senate in 1970, winning reelection in 1974, and served in the Indiana Senate from 1971 to 1977. During his time in the Indiana Senate, Benjamin was named Outstanding State Senator by newsmen assigned to report on the Indiana General Assembly. As a state legislator, Mr. Benjamin developed a new code of ethics for legislators, worked on a new state medical malpractice act, and facilitated court reform for the Lake County Superior Court system. Two years after Benjamin won a seat in the Indiana Senate, he challenged incumbent 12-term Congressman Ray J. Madden for the Democratic nomination for Indiana's 1st congressional district, but eventually lost the hotly contested primary. By 1976, having gained significant name recognition as an Indiana legislator, Benjamin again challenged Madden in the Democratic primary, this time defeating him with 56% of the vote, compared with Madden's 34%. In the general election Benjamin beat evangelical Protestant educator, and co-founder of Moral Majority, Robert J. Billings, with a 40% margin of victory. United States House of Representatives Benjamin served in the 95th, 96th, and 97th Congresses from 1977 until his death in 1982. Benjamin sat on the House Appropriations Committee, and served as the chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, aiding Northwest Indiana with projects such as improved Amtrak facilities, new South Shore Railroad commuter cars, and funding for an I-94 interchange to provide access to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore as well as improvements in Gary's bus system and municipal airport. In addition, Benjamin chaired the executive committee of the Congressional Steel Caucus, a bi-partisan coalition of congressman that promotes the health and stability of the domestic steel industry. To encourage the Calumet Region's economic recovery, Benjamin worked to establish the Calumet Forum, with representatives of labor, industry, banking, publishing, education, politics, transportation, and the religious community seeking to promote the economic resurgence and development of the Region. Regarding the importance of the Forum, Benjamin commented, \\"I've put myself on the line for this ... I've got to do it. It just has to be done.\\" Benjamin continued to gain a reputation for hard work, dedication, effectiveness, and loyalty among both his colleagues and his constituents. He retained his seat in the 1978 and 1980 elections, and was seeking a fourth congressional term when he died suddenly from a heart attack in September 1982. He is buried in Merrillville, Indiana's Calumet Park Cemetery. The Veterans Affairs clinic in Crown Point, Indiana, is named in his honor.

Plot summary The Confederation of Human Worlds comprises about two hundred semi-autonomous settled worlds. Some of those worlds are rich and powerful, others are not. A coalition of a dozen lesser worlds, tired of being second class citizens, decides to secede from the Confederation. What they do not know is the threat of an alien species known as the Skinks hangs over the entire confederation. The Skink Threat is top secret, no citizens know of them. Ever since the discovery of these aliens, the Confederation has beefed up its defences on the out lying colonies. On Ravenette, one of the Coalition worlds, protesters gather at the main gate of the Confederation army base. Someone unknown shoots into the crowd, killing a protester and setting off a bloody riot that kills many civilians and soldiers. The Coalition started the riot and provoked the soldiers even though the soldiers did not shoot into the crowd, news networks say otherwise. The Coalition declares war, and brings all its military might against the Confederation forces on Ravenette‚Äîbanking on the likelihood that they will achieve victory before reinforcements arrive, and that the Confederation will agree to negotiate a peaceable parting. They guessed wrong. An army division and 34th FIST are soon on the scene, holding the line until more reinforcements arrive.

It consists of a paperboard flap (where the cover art is printed) which is held closed by a narrow plastic strip which has a \\"snap\\" closure. The strip is part of a single piece of plastic which forms the disc tray, and protective edges at the top and bottom. The \\"hinge\\" is simply created by the thinness of the plastic along the back right corner. The closure forms the right edge of the package and wraps as a single rigid piece around to the front in an L shape (as viewed from either end). Bumps on the inside of the top and bottom edges of the tray fit into notches on the end of the closure in order to create the snap. It was patented in 1992 by Ivy Hill Packaging, a Time Warner subsidiary that made cardboard LP sleeves and CD longboxes. It allowed them to have an eco-friendly case option which used little plastic and allowed the printing of graphics on the inside cover. It also made good financial sense as it repurposed cardboard-manufacturing machinery still onsite. It was originally used as a prestige format in a square case for CD-Singles from 1993 to 1997, but was later used in a rectangular case for DVDs from 1994 to 2003. The DVD case was mainly used by Time Warner's Warner Home Video unit, including releases from Warner Bros. Pictures and New Line Cinema and their associated labels. Time-Warner gradually switched to DVD keep-cases in 2003 when they sold Ivy Hill to Cinram, who later dropped the format in 2005 due to a lack of interest. By the mid 2000s, Time Warner had switched to a new form of keep case, which reduced the amount of plastic used by removing some non-structural plastic which formed the recycling symbol in the case. The snap case also had an issue where the closure's glue could possibly separate from the case and proved to be less resilient in retail settings, with new product being more vulnerable to damage from shipping and unpacking (as the case and disc could easily be damaged by a utility knife or other retail unpacking tool, which a keep case could repel with only front case damage).

It is located on Sanavir√≥n Peninsula along Paradise Harbor, Danco Coast, in Graham Land, Antarctic Peninsula. Brown is one of 13 research bases in Antarctica operated by Argentina. From 1951 to 1984 it served as a permanent base; since then it is open during the summer season only. History Brown Station dates to 6 April 1951, when Argentina established the Almirante Brown Naval Detachment at Paradise Harbor. The Argentine Antarctic Institute took over the station in 1964‚Äì65, creating one of the most complete biology laboratories on the Antarctic Peninsula. It included a main house of ; two folding fuel tanks; and an additional building exclusive for scientific research, equipped with three labs, photography workshop, emergency radio station, office and library. It was called Almirante Brown Research Station and inaugurated on 17 February 1965. Brown Station's original facilities were burned down by the station's doctor on 12 April 1984 after he was ordered to stay for the winter.Almirante Brown Station, Antarctic Peninsula - Antarctic Points of Interest on Waymarking.com Station personnel were rescued by the ship USS Hero and taken to United States‚Äôs Palmer Station. Argentina rebuilt the base but it was demoted to summer-only status. During the summer campaign of 1995‚Äì96 the Logistics Department of the Argentine National Antarctic Directorate built two new habitable modules: a laboratory and a house with amenities. In the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign the Directorate built a new main house capable of comfortably accommodating 8 people; the new building consists of 4 bedrooms, kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Brown slipped into several years of inactivity during the 2000s decade but since 2007 is occupied during the summer again.  Conscripto Ortiz Refuge  Refugee Conscripto Ortiz () is an Argentine refuge in Antarctica located 230 meters from the Brown Station. The refuge was opened on January 29, 1956 and it is administered by the Argentine Navy. His name pays homage to the conscript Mario Inocencio Ort√≠z who died, on March 15, during the Argentine Antarctic campaign of 1954‚Äì1955 in service aboard the transport ship ARA Bah√≠a Aguirre. The detachment worked as a meteorological observatory and as a base for Antarctic campaigns until it was temporarily closed in 1960.Refugio naval Conscripto Ortiz, Retrieved September 20, 2018 Description Paradise Harbor is a large sea inlet southwest of Andvord Bay protected by an arc formed by the Lemaire, Cramer and Bryde islands. Along the harbor's deep water coast lies the small Sanavir√≥n Peninsula, a rocky promontory crowned by a mound of almost high called Punta Proa, where the base facilities are located. In the area there are several beacons to help ship guidance: Punta Proa, in the homonymous place; Punta Vidt in General Ricchieri Cove; Punta Conesa, on the entrance to Puerto Leith; Hanka islet on the homonymous place in Paradise Harbor; Punta Piedras in Oscar Cove; and the lighthouse on Cramer Island. Brown is located from Ushuaia, the nearest port city. the base spans a total area of . It can house a maximum of 18 people. =Scientific activities= Research programs were developed for biology (zoology and botany), bacteriology, limnology, biochemistry, animal and human physiology, pathology, ecology, oceanography, meteorology, cosmic rays and ionospheric observations, environmental nuclear radiation, continental and sea ice glaciology, satellite geodesy, geology, geophysics, seismology, ozone monitoring and tide measurement. Throughout the years of research and observations at Brown, more than 100 scientific papers were published by the Argentine Antarctic Institute. =Tourism= Thanks to its location on the Antarctica continent along the beautiful Paradise Harbor and to its relatively mild weather, Brown Station is a popular excursion destination for tourist expedition ships visiting Antarctica. In addition to visiting gentoo penguins, tourists may climb to a viewpoint above the station. Rather than walking down the steep slope, many visitors use the human bobsled course. All those visitors sledding downhill have created a ditch a few feet deep that makes for excellent sledding.

It was released in 1995 by Sony Music and Columbia Records as the lead single from the album. The song was written and produced by Shakira and Luis Fernando Ochoa. \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" is a Latin pop song that lyrically discusses a willingness to correct a failed relationship. Upon its release, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who recognized it as a stand-out track from Pies Descalzos. Additionally, it became Shakira's first recording to attain commercial success outside her native Colombia. The song peaked at numbers 1 and 2 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and Latin Songs component charts. Its performance aided its parent album in becoming her breakthrough record, which eventually attained platinum certifications in Brazil, Colombia, and the United States. Its accompanying music video depicts Shakira performing the track, where she is often pictured with her guitar. A Portuguese-language translation of the track titled \\"Estou Aqui\\" appeared on Shakira's first remix album The Remixes in 1997. An English-language version was leaked to the internet in 2011. The song has additionally been performed during six of the seven concert tours Shakira has held to date. Background and composition Shakira released her first major-label studio album Pies Descalzos in 1995 by Sony Music and Columbia Records. Assuming a prominent position in its production, she co- wrote and co-produced each of the eleven tracks included on the record. Serviced as the lead single from the project in 1996, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" saw additional songwriting and production from Luis Fernando Ochoa. The track is heavily influenced by Latin pop elements, and makes use of prominent guitar instrumentation. Lyrically, it states a desire to amend a failed relationship. In English, the lyrics \\"lo que nos pas√≥ no repetir√° jam√°s\\" and \\"Estoy aqu√≠ queri√©ndote, ahog√°ndome\\" translate to \\"what happened to us will never be repeated\\" and \\"I'm here wanting you, drowning\\", respectively. After attaining success with the original Spanish-language version, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" was re- recorded in Portuguese as \\"Estou Aqui\\" for Shakira's 1997 remix album The Remixes. An English-language version \\"I'm Here\\" was leaked in early-2011, but was not made available for digital download. Reception Upon its release, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who recognized it as a stand-out track from Pies Descalzos. Carlos Quintana of About.com complimented the track for featuring a \\"vibrant dancing flavor\\", and placed it among his personal favorites from the record. Similarly, Jose F. Promis from Allmusic praised it for serving as an \\"infectious and melodic\\" opening track, going on to select the song as an album highlight. The song received a nomination for Pop Song of the Year at the 1997 Lo Nuestro Awards, but lost to \\"Experiencia Religiosa\\" by Enrique Iglesias. \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" became Shakira's first recording to attain commercial success. The song peaked at numbers 1 and 2 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and Latin Songs component charts. Its commercial performance aided its parent album in becoming her breakthrough record, which eventually attained platinum certifications in Brazil, and the United States. Pies Descalzos was also awarded the \\"Diamond Prism\\" award in Colombia. In 1996, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" was included in the reissue of Pies Descalzos, titled Colecci√≥n de Oro. In 2002, it was featured as the opening track for Shakira's first greatest hits album Grandes √âxitos. Music video \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" became the first track by Shakira to receive an accompanying music video, which was directed by Simon Brand. The setting depicts a barn during the various weather seasons, and shows Shakira performing the song, accompanied with a guitar in most scenes. The clip was met with a favorable response from her label Sony Music, and was also met with commercial success. Consequentially, executives decided to place additional emphasis on promoting Pies Descalzos if it were to exceed sales of 50,000 copies. John Lannert from Billboard positively noted that her voice and appearance \\"jumps out at you\\". In Colombia, it was recognized as the \\"Best Video\\" at the Asociaci√≥n Colombiana de Periodistas del Espect√°culo (ACPE) Awards. After the huge success of the single in Latin America and Spain, Shakira filmed an alternate music video for Estoy Aqu√≠, directed by french photographer and filmmaker Christophe Gstalder, this music video was used to promote the song in European countries and was marketed as \\"Estoy Aqu√≠ (European Mix)\\". This alternate music video depicts Shakira playing the guitar and dancing, posing seductively behind an aquarium and setting her guitar on fire. Live performances Shakira has performed \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" during six of her seven concert tours thus far. She first performed the track in Mexico City during her Tour Pies Descalzos, which ran from 1996 through 1997. It was also included during the Tour Anfibio and Tour of the Mongoose, held in support of her second and third studio albums D√≥nde Est√°n los Ladrones? and Laundry Service, respectively. The song was additionally performed during the Oral Fixation Tour, which became her largest tour to date. In place of its inclusion in The Sun Comes Out World Tour, \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" was performed in Rio de Janeiro as part of Rock in Rio in 2011. Later in 2018 the song served as an opening song for her El Dorado World Tour. In August 1999, Shakira sang \\"Estoy Aqu√≠\\" during an episode of MTV Unplugged in New York City. In February 2000, the performance was included in the live album of the event. At the 12th Latin Grammy Awards ceremony in 2011, Mexican singer-songwriter Aleks Syntek performed a live cover of the song as part of the Latin Grammys tribute to Shakira, where she was honored Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.

She succeeded her father on his death in 1851, as he had intended long before his death, even if she had brothers.

When Livingstone returned in 1853 to the Makololo's capital, Linyati, he found out that only shortly after her father's death she had stepped down in favour of her brother Sekeletu, who became a new king. In Livingstone's account the reason was her desire to have a stable husband and a family that was firmly hers, while as a ruler she was forced to alternate many husbands so that none got too much power.

It broadcast in Auckland on 88.3FM and in Wellington on 107.3FM. It was founded on 18 July 2003. The station was unique in that it is being run as a completely voluntary project and is advert free. This helps to ensure the Fleet disk jockey complete artistic control. The station's listenership crosses through traditional Auckland demographics reaching a diverse audience particularly those involved in the Arts and creative industries. Fleet has held a variety of music and art related events, such as the infamous \\"Convoy\\" gigs and Camp Fleet, when on New Years the radio station takes over a classic Kiwi school camp. Fleet members are often exhibiting art about town and sometimes in conjunction with the Pelvic Trust. Due to a lack of funding, Fleet shut down on 21 May 2010, pending donations to make it viable again. As of 2011 Fleet FM has transformed into Fleet Truck, a mobile radio station broadcasting sporadically from a truck in and around the Auckland area on 88.0 FM. Programmes =The Bored Housewife Breakfast Show= The Bored Housewife Breakfast Show was broadcast Wednesday mornings from 7am-9am. Hosted by journalist Benjii Jackson, the show regularly featured bands and musicians coming into the studio as part of the \\"Bored Housewife Sessions\\", a nod to one of Jackson's influences, the late John Peel. Features in the past have included \\"That's New!\\", \\"It Came From The UK\\" and \\"Battle Formation\\", which sees two bands battle for an area of land with the winner decided through listener interactivity (text messaging, e-mailing). However, \\"Battle Formation\\" is loosely themed around geographical locations; one episode of the show saw Dinosaur Jr. and Sebadoh battle for the use of Lou Barlow. The show also pays homage to a character known as \\"Alex Manford\\", spawning such uses of the term as \\"The Alex Manford Track of the Week\\" and \\"Alex Manford Approved\\", which defines something the hosts of the show believe is of utmost quality. More recently, NZPWI contributor Troy Rawhiti-Forbes has joined up with Jackson on a Friday afternoon, subsequently renaming the show \\"The Afternoon Show\\", however the format of the show has not significantly altered. The breakfast show, however, is viewed as the more \\"serious\\" of the two, despite keeping the \\"Bored Housewife\\" moniker. There is a heavy emphasis as of late on newer music, however, with the radio show having helped to an extent New Zealand artists like The Tarantinos, The Randoms, Calamity Jam, Battle Circus and Sora Shima amongst others. The show has also introduced an array of international artists to New Zealand listeners, including Colon Open-Bracket, Cajun Dance Party, Los Campesinos, Skindred and We Need Leads. During his March 5, 2008 show, Jackson announced that he was stepping down as presenter of the Friday afternoon show due to work obligations.\\"Things To Blog In Auckland When You're Bored\\" - Benjii Jackson's official blog The radio show finished broadcasting on Fleet FM in June 2008 due to \\"exhaustion\\". The question of who Alex Manford is was raised weeks prior to the first Bored Housewife Radio Show live event on June 7, 2007, when \\"The Alex Manford Benefit Show\\" was held at the Schooner Tavern in Auckland. Many a story has been woven by bands and presenters who appear on Fleet FM, however Jackson officially stated who Alex Manford was in a blog posting in mid-June 2007. The usage of Alex Manford has become an integral part of the identity of the radio show and events associated with it; in 2007 the name was used in conjunction with a live event at the now defunct Schooner Tavern and in 2008 another live event will adorn the Alex Manford name, with the MySpace page regarding the concert already containing his likeness.The Bored Housewife Radio Show at MySpace =The Magic Cauldron= The Magic Cauldron was a radio show hosted by Mittins & Shenanigans Monday, 9‚Äì11 am.the magic cauldron myspace page The show included music, interviews, and prizes, and also had a regular interactive 10 am radio drama, where listeners are encouraged to contribute to the ongoing tale of 'Galoff & the three Daughters', and even submit entirely new stories to be read on air, via The Magic Cauldron's Myspace and Wordpress pages.the magic cauldron blog External links *Fleet Truck Website *Fleet FM Website *Fleet Show Blogs and Podcasts References Radio stations in New Zealand ","title":"Fleet FM"},{"id":"3532837","title":"Youth (Matisyahu album)"},{"id":"3532838","text":"List of aerial tramways (US) or cable cars (Europe) around the world. *For gondola lifts, see the List of gondola lifts. *For funiculars see List of funicular railways *For funitels, see the Funitel article.

There is a total of two cable car routes in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both in the Sarajevo region * Trebeviƒáka ≈æiƒçara (Trebeviƒá cable car) is a cable car route in the City of Sarajevo. First established in 1959 connecting the city with the 1627m high mountain Trebeviƒá, it was destroyed at the start of Bosnian war in 1992 with the first victim of the Siege of Sarajevo being the guard of the hill station, Ramo Biber, who was killed on March 2, 1992 and in his honor nowadays the hill station carries his name as well as plaque is found inside of it. The cable car route was restored from ground up in 2017/2018 and opened once again for public use on 6 April 2018, the Day of the City of Sarajevo, more than a quarter of a century after it was destroyed. The reconstruction had a price tag of around 9 million ‚Ç¨, including the cable car system, stations as well as work on the immediate surrounding of the stations and the route, with almost 3 million ‚Ç¨ being a donation of American-Dutch-Swiss physicist and businessman Edmund Offerman who is married to a Maja Offerman, a woman from Sarajevo with whom he visited the city in 1991 and took a ride in the cable car which left a big impact of him, promising to himself that he will do everything to get it going again after witnessing its destruction in 1992. The work on the cable car system was done by Italian company from South Tyrol, Leitner Ropeways. The valley station is on an elevation of 575m in the old part of Sarajevo, just minutes of walking away from Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija and Vijeƒánica, while the hill station is on an elevation of 1150 m. Raising 575 m up, the hill station provides a panoramic view of the city in the valley below while in the same time enabling the people a trip to nature and the biggest park and forest located within the City boundaries. The cable car route is 2158 m long, resting on 10 steel pillars, takes 7 minutes and 15 seconds to complete (compared to 12‚Äì13 minutes before 1992), with a capacity of 1200 persons an hour in one direction and is composed of 33 cabins (capacity 10 persons and 750 kg) in anthracite colour except five of them which are coloured in red, blue, green, yellow and black i.e. the Olympic colours as Mount Trebeviƒá hosts the bob track which was used for the 1984 Winter Olympics. The regular price for one person above the age of 6 is ‚Ç¨10 for a round trip and working times are from 09:00 till 18:00. * Cable car on Ravna planina is a cable car system within the Ski Center Ravna planina, 25 km away from Sarajevo and 5 km from Pale and mountain Jahorina. It was opened on 25 December 2017 and consists of 19 blue cabins which are able to transport up to 2200 persons per hour. The valley station is on elevation of 900 m while the hill station is on 1350 m, length of the route is 1350 m. Price is ‚Ç¨2.5 for a round trip. The final plan is to connect the Ski Center Ravna planina with the Ski Center on Jahorina which would extend the route of the cable car system to almost 6 km.

Following a practice dating back to ACL and SAL U30Bs of 1967, SCL's 10 BQ23-7s and 30 standard B23-7s were delivered riding on reconditioned Blomberg trucks from EMD trade-ins. Only ten were built, all for the Seaboard Coast Line railroad, (originally no.5130‚Äì5139). CSX later inherited these locomotives, operating them into the late 1990s. These have come to be nicknamed \\"Busses\\" by the operating crews and \\"Aegis Cruisers\\" by some railfans, due to the boxy shape of the locomotive resembling the superstructure of the guided missile cruiser. None of these locomotives survive today. All were scrapped in 2001.

The street is intimately tied to the tango and the porte√±o sense of identity. Like the parallel avenues Santa Fe, C√≥rdoba, and San Juan, it takes its name from one of the Provinces of Argentina. It extends 69 blocks from Eduardo Madero Avenue in the eastern Puerto Madero neighborhood to the West and later to the Northwest, and ends at Federico Lacroze Avenue in the Chacarita neighborhood. Automobile traffic runs from west to east. Line B of the Buenos Aires Metro runs most of its length underneath the street. The Asociaci√≥n Amigos de la Calle Corrientes (\\"Friends of Corrientes Street Association\\") is a group that collaborates on the urban planning of the street. They have placed commemorative plaques on 40 street corners bearing the distinguished figures from the history of the tango. History City lights along Corrientes Avenue shortly before its widening in the 1930s.Intersection with Avenida 9 de Julio It was named Del Sol during the 17th century, San Nicol√°s from 1738 to 1808, and De Inch√°urregui from 1808 until 1822, when it received its current name. Never more than a street of average width during the nineteenth century, traffic swelled after the city began its rapid westward expansion, around 1880. Horse-drawn tramways first ran on the avenue in 1887; but, they soon proved inadequate and in 1910, Mayor Joaqu√≠n de Anchorena signed a bill authorizing its widening. The plan called for the massive razing of most of the avenue's north-side real estate and, so, met with strenuous opposition from affected landlords, retailers, as well as intellectuals like Roberto Arlt. A coup d'√®tat in 1930, however, made way for the plan's implementation, carried out relentlessly until its completion, in 1936. Today, when referring to Corrientes prior to the widening, the term \\"Narrow Corrientes\\" (Corrientes Angosta) is used. The newly inaugurated avenue coincided with the construction of the Buenos Aires Obelisk, since then one of the city's most recognizable landmarks, visible for several blocks of the avenue¬¥s downtown stretch. The opening of the Obelisk and surrounding Plaza de la Rep√∫blica in 1936 created a roundabout at the 9th of July Avenue intersection. Corrientes, like most major city avenues, was made a one-way thoroughfare by a 1967 municipal ordinance. Growing traffic demands led to the opening of the avenue through the plaza, and around the Obelisk, in 1971.The name \\"Corrientes Street\\" (Calle Corrientes) is often still preferred over \\"Corrientes Avenue\\" (Avenida Corrientes) specially on the famous centrical stretch. With that name it appears famously in several tango lyrics (see below). The first few blocks (from Leandro N.Alem to Florida Street) encompass Buenos Aires financial district (\\"La City\\") forming its Northern boundary, and are bustling with activity during banking hours ‚Äì traversed after several blocks by pedestrian Florida Street (which forms the district's Western boundary). Further down, for some blocks from 9 de Julio Avenue to Uruguay St. the avenue forms the Southern border of the lawyers' district surrounding the nearby Plaza Lavalle and the Supreme Court. For most of the 20th century Calle Corrientes was a symbol of night life in Buenos Aires, traditionally nicknamed \\"the street that never sleeps\\", In the 10 blocks West of downtown from Maipu St to Callao Avenue it held the largest concentration of theatres and cinemas (together with nearby pedestrian ), making it the center of commercial theatre in the city. (independent theatre in Buenos Aires is called today off Corrientes after off Broadway). The corridor includes some outstanding examples of Art Deco cinema architecture of the '30s and '40s such as Teatro Gran Rex, Teatro Opera and Teatro Premier. With the largest concentration of bookshops (many second hand) Corrientes was during the day a favourite haunt for intellectuals during the '50s, '60s and '70s (specially at celebrated spots such as \\"Cafe La Paz\\") while its famous pizza parlours and restaurants (such as Los Inmortales and G√ºerrin) attracted city crowds on Fridays or Saturdays evenings ‚Äì a night out of \\"pizza and cinema\\" (or of theatre going) on Corrientes and neighbouring Calle Lavalle being the standard form of urban weekend entertainment for generations of porte√±os (as reflected in lyrics such as \\"Moscato, pizza y fain√°\\"]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEahN2RaF5A). The Revista porte√±a or Teatro de revistas (Argentina's centenary culture of theatre revues) with its glittering vedettes and racy capo-c√≥micos (legendary starlets and comedians) is still centered around this stretch of Corrientes ‚Äì the lure of red carpet opening nights where celebrities can be glimpsed adding to the folklore. At the farther end ‚Äì the Luna Park is still synonymous with mass sports and entertainment events such as box matches or concerts. Throughout the decades the street has seen its own fauna of urban stereotypes, from the \\"innocent barrio girl\\" corrupted by the \\"bright city lights\\" of many a tango lyric in the cabarets and nightclubs of the 1920s and '30s (cf. \\" \\"The Seamstress who Took the Wrong Turn\\") to the valijero ('peeping tom') lone salesmen or office workers on lunch breaks (thus named for their briefcases or valijas), who sneaked to watch X-rated European movies when they appeared in the '60s and '70s (although more visible on neighbouring Lavalle St) to the \\"psico-bolche\\" ‚Äì artsy students and intellectuals (typically leftist ‚Äì bolchevique ‚Äì and/or dabbling in psychology, thus the name) who peopled its bookstores and cafes after the return of democracy in the early '80s. The emergence of video, the Internet, cineplex and shopping malls reduced much of the allure of Corrientes, and saw the closing of several famous cinemas and theatres. Yet sidewalks were widened and beautified in 2005 to facilitate retail activity along the avenue, which had declined since the 1970s. and today Corrientes is once again thriving at night - specially among theatre goers, with several major playhouse renovations and additions. Since the '80s the trend towards world-famous Broadway musicals in Spanish coexists with the more traditional or avant-garde serious theatre and the popular Teatro de Revistas. The last blocks of this main stretch, between Avenida Callao and Uruguay Street are converted into an expansive outdoor reading room during Bookstore Night, an annual event inaugurated in 2007. Mayor Mauricio Macri announced in 2010 that the financial district section of Corrientes - between Ninth of July and Avenida Leandro N. Alem, would become a two-way avenue.

The Blue Line is the term used in New York state for the boundaries of the Adirondack and Catskill parks, within which can be found the state's Forest Preserve. The state constitution requires that any property owned or acquired by the state in those parks \\"be forever kept as wild forest lands\\" and prohibits it from selling or transferring them in any way (save amending that section of the constitution to allow specific transactions). It is so called because blue ink was used when they were first drawn on state maps. That started a tradition that persists to this day (although private mapmakers have just as often used green). While they were originally meant merely to guide the acquisition of future Forest Preserve land, over time they have come to define and have legal impact on all lands, public and private, within them. History When the Forest Preserve was created in 1885, the legislature merely designated particular counties in the state as places where Forest Preserve could be acquired in the future. This definition was retained nine years later when the Forest Preserve Act became Article 14 of the state constitution. Shortly afterwards, it became apparent that a more precise definition was needed, as some of the counties in which there was the greatest need to protect land also had large areas where that was not necessary. Ulster County, for instance, is home to some of the wildest land in the Catskills, but it also has many well-developed lowlands near the Hudson River. So, in 1902, the legislature passed a bill defining the Adirondack Park for the first time in terms of the counties and towns within it. Two years later, the Catskill Park followed suit. However, it was delineated not solely in terms of pre-existing political boundaries but instead through a combination of those and old survey lot lines, streams and railroad rights-of-way. That proved to be a more effective and politically viable method, and accordingly the Adirondack Park Blue Line was redrawn shortly afterwards following the Catskills' example. Redefining the line While it takes only a simple majority vote of the legislature to amend either Blue Line to add land to the park, any diminution requires that two successive legislative sessions approve, the process for amending the constitution without the public vote. Both parks have grown considerably since being created. The Catskill Park reached its present size in the late 1950s; the Adirondack Park did not cover its current domain until the early 1970s. Inside the Blue Line In 1912 the legislature further clarified that the parks included the privately owned lands within as well as the public holdings. This has a few implications today. Land use in the Adirondack Park is subject to the rules and zoning regulations of the sometimes-controversial Adirondack Park Agency (APA). Even the state Department of Environmental Conservation must get APA approval of its management plans for the Forest Preserve. A state road sign in the gold- and-brown color scheme used inside the Blue Line. Normally, this sign would be white on blue. But there is no corresponding agency for the Catskills (largely due to the rough start the APA got) and as a rule the practical impact of living within Blue Line is minor. Since the mid-1960s the state has regulated commercial highway signage within them in a manner similar to the federal Highway Beautification Act and tries to use a distinctive, rustic gold-on- brown color scheme for all its own signage within them. The original Forest Preserve legislation assigned the state the primary role in controlling forest fires within the parks, a great relief to many towns within it then as steam locomotives and illegal logging were giving them plenty to deal with. DEC still has that status in what the law calls \\"fire towns,\\" which include every town entirely or partially within the parks (and the Ulster County town of Shawangunk, which has plenty of fire exposure on the eponymous ridge). Fires have become much less widespread than they used to be, however, thanks to a better-educated public and state oversight. The Catskill Park is also the only place within the state's \\"Southern Zone\\" where hunters do not have to wear their deer tags in the woods. Other state land use in the parks Since Article 14 is interpreted as applying to all state land ownership or purchase within the parks, this creates some problems for other state agencies that need a physical presence within them to serve the public. Usually the agencies involved, like the Department of Transportation, simply lease what they need from private landowners. Sometimes another governmental entity not subject to state law owns the land (the bistate Palisades Interstate Park Commission owns the future site of the Catskill Interpretive Center, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons lets the state lease land for its own prison near Ray Brook). The Administrative Use land classification, particularly in the Adirondacks, also makes some other state business possible. The law also exempts some areas within the park boundaries. Land inside the territory of any incorporated village or city does not have to be incorporated into the Forest Preserve. The towns of Altona and Dannemora are also excluded, despite being entirely or partially inside the Adirondack Blue Line, due to the large prison facilities located in them.

Belle Foods rebranded two of their Birmingham stores in July 2012 and plan to continue to rebrand all remaining stores at a rate of 8-10 per quarter until all 57 stores are under the Belle Foods banner. Headquarters SFM headquarters was located in part of the former Bruno's headquarters located on Lakeshore Parkway in Birmingham, Alabama. C&S; has been trying to sell or lease not only the part of the campus being used by SFM but the portion used by Bruno's until Fall 2008, but had not been able to find a tenant. A move from the Bruno's building was announced in 2005 but was never made. No new location was ever disclosed when the announcement was made. C&S; Wholesale Grocers has subleased portions of the warehouse space to other parties (Rooms To Go is a tenant) since 2008. The warehouse was over . of space and with the declining volume of groceries shipped from the facility each year, less space was needed to maintain the remaining business. Therefore, space was freed up for other entities to lease. Belle Foods is using the same office space that SFM had occupied since 2005. There are no plans to move the headquarters as Belle Foods supply agreement includes leasing office space for the headquarters.

As of 2012, it had 72 race and sports books and kiosks. It was based in Las Vegas. Leroy's parent company, American Wagering, was purchased by British bookmaker William Hill in 2012, and its locations were rebranded under the William Hill name.  History  = Inception & expansion (1978-1996) = In 1978, businessman Leroy Merillat bought a sportsbook in a strip mall in Downtown Las Vegas, and named it ‚ÄúLeroy‚Äôs‚Äù after himself. The following year, Nevada gaming regulators found Merillat unsuitable for licensing because of questions about the propriety of a land deal in California, and he was forced to sell the business. Merillat sold the operation to his son-in-law, Vic Salerno, in 1979. Nevada sportsbooks at the time were predominantly independent operations, rarely found in casinos. Around 1983, the popularity of sportsbooks began to boom and they started to become more common in casinos. Salerno developed one of the first computerized sportsbook management systems to make his operation more efficient and able to compete with the large casinos. In 1984, Salerno and two partners formed CBS Computer Systems to market their system to other sportsbook operators. The company, which shared the building with Leroy's, was soon providing systems to almost all of Las Vegas's bookmakers. They sold CBS in 1989 to United Tote for $3.5 million. In June 1989, Nevada law was changed to allow outside operators for casino sportsbooks, and Leroy's quickly took advantage of the new law by beginning to open branches in casinos. By 1992, Leroy's was the only independent sportsbook in the state, and had branches operating in 30 casinos. = As publicly traded company (1996-2012) = Leroy's was placed under a holding company, American Wagering, Inc. (AWI), and made its initial public offering in May 1996. Leroy's had 35 locations at the time. The funds raised in the IPO were used to complete the purchase of a 150-room Howard Johnson's hotel and casino near the Las Vegas Strip, which the company planned to remodel as a sports-themed resort. In October 1996, AWI bought CBS back from Autotote Corp. for $3 million, and renamed it as Computerized Bookmaking Systems. AWI agreed in April 1997 to buy Imagineering Systems, a maker of keno systems, for $3 million, but canceled the deal in September 1997, deciding instead to build a progressive keno system in-house. Imagineering sued AWI for breach of contract, and was eventually awarded $1.2 million. Meanwhile, AWI launched The Game, a keno offering with progressive jackpots linked to multiple casinos, in August 1999. The company closed its keno operations in 2002. In July 1997, AWI and International Game Technology jointly launched MegaSports, a parimutuel sports betting system offering high- value progressive jackpots to bettors at Leroy's and other Nevada sportbooks. The company shut down the project in 2000. AWI, through an Australian subsidiary, launched an online site offering race and sports betting under the MegaSports name in 1999. The site accepted wagers worldwide, except from bettors located in the United States. It was believed to the first online gambling venture by a company licensed in Nevada. Trouble arose, however, later that year, when the Nevada Gaming Commission accused MegaSports of accepting bets from an agent located in Las Vegas who went through a Canadian Internet provider. AWI was ultimately forced to sell the site, or risk losing its Nevada gaming license. MegaSports was sold in July 2002 to Eurast Ltd. of Perth for $2.8 million. The Howard Johnson's hotel was sold in July 1999 for $4.3 million. Michael Racusin, a financial consultant who assisted with the IPO, filed a lawsuit claiming he was not paid his full fee. After a court awarded him $1.3 million in July 2003, American Wagering was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Youbet.com attempted to buy the company out of bankruptcy for $9.5 million, but eventually withdrew its offer. The company emerged from bankruptcy in March 2005, with most debts having been paid in full, and shareholders retaining their equity in the company. The company acquired Sturgeon's Inn & Casino in Lovelock, Nevada in March 2006 for $1.8 million. In 2007, Leroy's began opening sports betting kiosks at its casino locations, allowing patrons with established accounts to place bets at all hours of the day. The following year, the kiosks began being installed in bars and taverns as well. The company began releasing mobile betting applications for smartphones in 2010, which proved popular. In June 2012, British bookmaker William Hill bought American Wagering for $18 million, along with Lucky's Race & Sports Book and the satellite sportsbook operations of Club Cal Neva. Salerno was named chairman of William Hill U.S., overseeing 55 percent of the state's sportsbook locations, all of which were rebranded under the William Hill name.

Biography  Enid Mumford was born in Merseyside in North West England, where her father Arthur McFarland was magistrate and her mother Dorothy Evans was teacher.Tudor Rickards. \\"Enid Mumford: Sociologist devoted to making computers work for people\\" The Guardian, Wednesday 3 May 2006 She attended Wallasey high school, and received her BA in Social Science from Liverpool University in 1946. After graduation Enid Mumford spent time working in industry, first as personnel manager for an aircraft factory and later as production manager for an alarm clock manufacturer. The first job was important for her career as an academic, since it involved looking after personnel policy and industrial relations strategy for a large number of women staff. The second job also proved invaluable, as she was running a production department, providing a level of practical experience that is unusual among academics.Enid Mumford Biography . Retrieved 3 November 2008. Enid Mumford then joined the Faculty of Social Science at Liverpool University in 1956. Later she then spent a year at the University of Michigan, where she worked for the University Bureau of Public Health Economics and studied Michigan medical facilities while her husband took a higher degree in dental science. On returning to England, she joined the newly formed Manchester Business School (MBS), where she undertook many research contracts investigating the human and organisational impacts of computer based systems. During this time she became Professor of Organisational Behaviour and Director of the Computer and Work Design Research Unit (CAWDRU). She also directed the MBA programme for four years. She was a companion of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, a Fellow of the British Computer Society (BCS), also an Honorary Fellow of the BCS in 1984, and also a founder member and ex-chairperson of the BCS Sociotechnical Group. In 1983 Enid Mumford was awarded the American Warnier Prize for her contributions to information science. In 1996, she was given an Honorary Doctorate by the university of Jyvaskyla in Finland. And in 1999, she was the only British recipient of a Leo Lifetime Achievement Award for Exceptional Achievement in Information Systems, one of only four in that year. Leo Awards are given by the Association for Information Systems (AIS) and the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS).  Work  = Research in industrial relations = At the Faculty of Social Science at Liverpool University Mumford carried out research in industrial relations in the Liverpool docks and in the North West coal industry. To collect information for the dock research, she became a canteen assistant in the canteens used by the stevedores for meals. Each canteen was in a different part of the waterfront estate and served dockers working on different shipping lines and with different cargoes. The coal mine research required her to spend many months underground talking to miners at the coal face. = Human factors and socio-technical systems = Early in her career Enid Mumford realised that the implementation of large computer systems generally resulted in failure to produce a satisfactory outcome. Such failure could arise even when the underlying technology was adequate. She demonstrated that the underlying cause was an inability to overcome human factors associated with the implementation and use of computers. Four decades later, despite the identification of these sociotechnical factors and the development of methodologies to overcome such problems, large scale computer implementations are often unsuccessful in practice. The Work Structure contract is one such methodology Mumford evaluated and aimed to refine to consider the sociotechnical influence of employees. She highlights the importance of the continual questioning of production processes and principles from the perspectives of the individuals involved to implement technology which is both efficient and humanistic. Mumford, E. (1995) Contracts, complexity and contradictions: The changing employment relationship (link) https://doi.org/10.1108/00483489510099569 = The socio-technical approach = While at MBS, Mumford developed a close relationship with the Tavistock Institute and became interested in their democratic socio-technical approach to work organisation. Since then, she has applied this approach to the design and implementation of computer-based systems and information technology. One of her largest socio-technical projects was with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in Boston. In the 1970s she became a member of the International Quality of Working Life Group, the goal of which was to spread the socio-technical message around the world. She later became a council member of the Tavistock Institute and was also a member of the US Socio- technical Round Table.

After a move from non-League Slough Town, his career took off at Brentford, where he scored 64 goals in 163 league games between 1998 and 2002. He then moved to Sheffield Wednesday, and two years later transferred to Reading following a short loan spell. He returned to Brentford in 2005, and two years later signed with Yeovil Town. In 2008, he moved to Cheltenham Town, and also had a loan spell at Brighton & Hove Albion the following year. In 2009, he moved Australia to play for Adelaide United, but left the club in December 2010. Following this he spent a brief period with Luton Town back in England, before heading to Cyprus to play for AEP Paphos. He then returned to England having spells at Barnet and a loan spell at Hayes & Yeading United. In February 2012, he made a nostalgic return to his first club Slough Town to try to help them achieve promotion from the Southern Football League Division One Central. Born in England, he represented Ghana at international level. Playing career Owusu started his career at non-league side Slough Town before being signed by then‚ÄìBrentford manager Ron Noades in 1998. Owusu was an instant success, scoring 25 goals in all competitions, leading the Third Division scoring charts. He was less successful in the 1999‚Äì2000 campaign, scoring 14 goals in all competitions. During the 2000‚Äì01 season, he scored 12 goals in 34 games. He returned to form with a bang in 2001‚Äì02, scoring 22 goals ‚Äì one of these came against Blackpool in a 3‚Äì1 win on March, winning him a Goal of the Month award. His excellent form helped the Bees to reach the Second Division play-off final at the Millennium Stadium, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to Stoke City. K Out of contact Owusu was targeted by Oldham Athletic and Crystal Palace, but instead signed to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on a three-year deal. Lloyd became an instant Wednesday hero when after sixty seconds into his debut as a substitute in a fierce derby match against Sheffield United, he placed a header past Blades keeper Paddy Kenny for the opening goal of a 2‚Äì0 win. However, he did not really break into the first team, starting the majority of his 33 appearances from the bench in the 2002‚Äì03 season, finishing the season with a disappointing total of four goals. He continued to be used sparingly in the 2003‚Äì04 season, and was signed on loan by Steve Coppell's Reading in December 2003. He enjoyed his time at the Madejski Stadium, and was eager to join the Royals permanently so as to secure regular first team football. He got his wish as the loan move became permanent in the summer of 2004, Reading paying the Owls an undisclosed fee. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Owusu finished with an impressive record of six goals in fourteen league starts, though once again he was mostly a substitute player. Brentford manager Martin Allen signed Owusu on a free transfer in the summer of 2005, handing Owusu a two-year contract he stressed that Owusu was signed not due to his popularity at the club but on footballing ability alone. He scored fourteen goals in 42 games in all competitions in 2005‚Äì06. He missed most of the 2006‚Äì07 season with injury, and had to undergo multiple operations. Owusu finally made his comeback for Brentford against Rotherham in a 1‚Äì0 defeat at Griffin Park on 17 March 2007, nearly scoring with his first touch. His comeback was to prove short-lived though, as he was released two months later. In July 2007 he signed a one-year contract with Russell Slade's Yeovil Town. Top-scorer in his first season at the club, he announced he was happy to continue at Huish Park despite interest from other clubs. However, in September 2008, Owusu joined League One side Cheltenham Town for free, on a one-year deal. In March 2009, Cheltenham allowed to Owusu to join Brighton & Hove Albion on loan until the end of the season after the club were forced to cut costs. Owusu scored seven goals in fourteen league appearances for Brighton, ensuring they avoided relegation from League One and as a result he was named as the League One Player of the Month for April 2009.Owusu Scoops League One Award, Seagulls World, 7 May 2009. Retrieved 8 May 2009 Seventeen Brighton players were out of contact at the season's end, however Owusu was one of only three of these players to be offered a new contract. He did not accept the offer. In June 2009, Owusu signed for Australian A-League side Adelaide United on a two-year deal. His new career at the Australian club was dealt a blow when his pre-season conditioning was hampered by the contraction of swine flu and pneumonia. He made his debut for the Australian club on 21 August 2009, as a 58th-minute substitute for Daniel Mullen. He scored his first goal for Adelaide in a 3‚Äì3 draw to North Queensland at Hindmarsh Stadium the following week. After a poor season and being dropped to the youth team, Owusu went for a one-week trial for Chinese Super League club Guangzhou Evergrande. Owusu failed to make an impact at Adelaide and had his contract terminated by mutual consent at the end of December 2010. He quickly returned to England to join League Two club Port Vale on trial. Port Vale wished to sign him in early January 2011, but came up against registration issues with Adelaide. New manager Jim Gannon then said that he would not be signing Owusu. Owusu was linked with League Two side Gillingham in mid-January 2011, but he instead opted to sign for Conference Premier side Luton Town on 18 January, signing a contract until May 2011. He made his debut and scored his first goal for the club that evening in a 5‚Äì0 victory against York City. On 2 June 2011, Owusu was released by Luton. He had made 15 appearances, scoring 7 goals. He began the 2011‚Äì12 season training with Micky Adams' Port Vale. However, he again left the UK, this time settling with AEP Paphos in the Cypriot Second Division. On 12 September 2011, Owusu returned to England and signed for League Two side Barnet on a short-term deal. He made his debut the following day coming on as sub for Charlie Taylor in the 2‚Äì0 home win over Plymouth Argyle. On 4 November 2011, Owusu joined Conference Premier side Hayes & Yeading United on a one-month loan deal. On 15 December 2011, soon after he returned from this loan spell, it was reported that he had left Barnet at the expiry of his contract. On 23 March 2012, Owusu returned to Australia to join FFSA Premier League side White City Woodville. On 15 November 2012, it was announced that Owusu would be signing a one-year-deal to join Indonesian Super League side Pelita Bandung Raya as assistant manager and player. However, this transfer fell through. Upon returning to Australia, he signed for Hakoah Sydney City East FC in the NSW State League Division One. Here, he helped the club to a Round of 32 position in the inaugural FFA Cup where they lost to Palm Beach SC from Queensland. In his only season for Hakoah, Owusu would go on to score 18 goals in 23 league appearances for the club, helping them win promotion to the National Premier Leagues NSW 2. International career Owusu earned his first cap for Ghana in 2005, and was hopeful of playing in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the first World Cup which his country had qualified for. However, on 26 April, in a rare appearance for Ghana, Owusu tore a groin muscle in a friendly match against VfB Stuttgart. As a result, he was out injured for the World Cup, and so was not selected in the Ghana squad. In January 2015, he announced his retirement aged 38 after a career spanning 17 years. Coaching career Following the announcement of his retirement as a player, Lloyd Owusu joined the International Football School, Australia located in Kariong, New South Wales After his professional career, he has commenced coaching at Cranbrook School in Sydney, Australia.

Marshall, and Clifton James, as well as newcomers Jane Fonda and Robert Redford and future member Robert Duvall. This work, in turn, attracted the attention of media impresario Lew Grade, who would bring Bradford to Great Britain in 1967 for Man in a Suitcase. In addition to his numerous TV appearances, Bradford has been featured in many films, such as The Missouri Breaks (1976), An Enemy of the People (1978), Badge of the Assassin (1985), The Trip to Bountiful (1985), The Untouchables (1987) and The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), but arguably his best known film role is the corrupt police captain in the 1997 film Hoodlum featuring Laurence Fishburne, Andy Garc√≠a, and Tim Roth.

In the 1960s, he appeared in one episode of the television series Gunsmoke and guest starred in an episode of the western series The High Chaparral. In the 1970s, he played Lutie Bascomb in one episode of The Waltons. He guest starred in an episode of Murder, She Wrote in the 1980s. He also guest starred on NBC's TV series Viper.

It occasionally contained live tracks recorded from local concerts in the Twin Cities. It was released annually during the holidays from 1989 to 2018. New volumes would appear each November at local Target stores in time for Christmas gifts. In later years the sampler was also available on Target.com. Proceeds benefited Minnesota charitable organizations. The albums, cassettes and CDs usually generated over $500,000 every year for Minnesota charities. In the last several years, the recordings sold quickly, disappearing within minutes in many stores. The 16th volume, released on November 11, 2004, had a print run of about 35,000 copies. In Forest Lake, Minnesota, the local Target store ran out of its shipment of discs in seven minutes. On October 1, 2018, KTCZ-FM announced that the upcoming sampler (volume 30) would be the last. It sold out in stores the same day and online later that night after a technical glitch was resolved freeing the remaining copies for online purchase. Throughout the 30 years of its run, the sampler raised over $13 million for Minnesota non-profits and charities.

(Note extra chlorine compared to lincomycin, but disregard inversion of image.) Lincosamides are a class of antibiotics, which include lincomycin, clindamycin, and pirlimycin.  Structure  Lincosamides consist of a pyrrolidine ring linked to a pyranose moiety (methylthio- lincosamide) via an amide bond. Hydrolysis of lincosamides, specifically lincomycin, splits the molecule into its building blocks of the sugar and proline moieties. Both of these derivatives can conversely be recombined into the drug itself or a derivative.  Synthesis  Biosynthesis of lincosamides occurs through a biphasic pathway, in which propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are independently synthesized immediately before condensation of the two precursor molecules. Condensation of the propylproline carboxyl group with the methylthiolincosamide amine group via an amide bond forms N-demethyllincomycin. N-Demethyllincomycin is subsequently methylated via S-adenosyl methionine to produce lincomycin A. Lincomycin is naturally produced by bacteria species, namely Streptomyces lincolnensis, S. roseolus, and S. caelestis. Clindamycin is derived via (7S)-chloro-substitution of the (7R)-hydroxyl group of lincomycin. Lincomycin is primarily isolated from fermentations of Streptomyces lincolnensis, while clindamycin is prepared semi-synthetically. While several hundred synthetic and semi-synthetic derivatives of lincosamides have been prepared, only lincomycin A and clindamycin are used in clinical practice due to issues with toxicity and low biological activity in other lincosamide antibiotics. Chemical synthesis of lincomycin A. Propylproline and methylthio-lincosamide are joined via a condensation reaction. This reaction forms N-demethyllincomycin A, which is methylated via S-adenosylmethionine to form lincomycin A. Mechanism of action Lincosamides prevent bacterial replication in a bacteriostatic mechanism by interfering with the synthesis of proteins. In a mechanism similar to macrolides and streptogramin B, lincosamides bind close to the peptidyl transferase center on the 23S portion of the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes. High resolution X-ray structures of clindamycin and ribosomal subunits from bacterium have previously revealed exclusive binding to the 23S segment of the peptidyl transferase cavity. Binding is mediated by the mycarose sugar moiety which has partially overlapping substrates with peptidyl transferase. By extending to the peptidyl transferase center, lincosamides cause the premature dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA's containing two, three or four amino acid residues. In this case, peptides will grow to a certain point until steric hindrance inhibits peptidyl transferase activity.The Mechanism of Action of Macrolides, Lincosamides and Streptogramin B Reveals the Nascent Peptide Exit Path in the Ribosome Martin Lovmar and M√•ns Ehrenberg Lincosamides do not interfere with protein synthesis in human cells (or those of other eukaryotes) due to structural differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Lincosamides are used against Gram positive bacteria since they are unable to pass through the porins of Gram-negative bacteria. Clindamycin, a commonly used lincosamide, binds the 50s subunit and causes steric hindrance which inhibits the transfer of amino acids to the longer polypeptide chain. Resistance = Ribosomal methylation = Soon after the emergence of clinical lincosamide use in 1953, strains of resistant staphylococci were isolated in several countries including France, Japan and the United States. Resistant strains were characterized by expression of methyltransferases which dimethylate residues within the 23S subunit of ribosomal RNA, preventing binding of macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramins B. The gene family responsible for encoding of these methyltransferases is referred to as the \\"erm\\" family, or erythromycin ribosome methylase family of genes. Nearly 40 erm genes have been reported to date, which are transferred primarily through plasmids and transposons. = Target mutation = Several strains of bacteria which are highly resistant to macrolide treatment have been isolated and found to possess mutations at the transferase binding pocket in the 23S ribosomal subunit. Macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from hospital patients in Eastern Europe and North America were found to contain mutations in either 23S or other ribosomal protein genes. = Antibiotic efflux = Gram-negative bacteria harbor genes encoding for molecular pumps which can contribute to resistance of hydrophobic compounds like macrolides and lincosamides. Out of the many families of multidrug resistance pumps, lincosamides are most commonly shunted through pumps belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily. Staphylococci express efflux pumps with specificity for 14 and 15 member ring macrolides and streptogramin B, but not lincosamide molecules. Example of drug efflux through a pump belonging to the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily, the type of pump primarily responsible for lincosamide efflux. = Drug modification = Clinical isolates of S. aureus harboring genes which encode for lincosamide nucleotransferases have been reported. Genes lnuA and lnuB confer resistance to lincomycin, but not clindamycin. These genes, however, limit the bactericidal activity of clindamycin. This type of resistance is rare in S. aureus, but has been reported to be more prevalent in other bacteria strains.  Pharmacokinetics  Approximately 90% of orally administered lincosamides are absorbed, with slight variance depending on which drug is given. Plasma concentrations via this route peak within 2‚Äì4 hours. Intramuscular administration of lincosamides results in strong absorption, with peak plasma levels being reached in 1‚Äì2 hours. Around 90% of clindamycin is bound to plasma proteins, and is generally more stable and rapidly absorbed than lincomycin. Lincosamides have a broad distribution in several tissues, excluding cerebrospinal fluid. When administered intramuscularly to rats, lincomycin was found to accumulate in highest concentrations in the kidneys when compared to other tissues, while clindamycin was found in highest concentrations within the lungs. Clindamycin accumulates in macrophages and other white blood cells, which can result in concentrations 50 times higher than plasma levels.  Clinical use  Lincosamides are often used clinically as an alternative antibiotic for patients who are allergic to penicillin. Of the lincosamides, clindamycin is most commonly used within the clinic due to its higher bioavailability, higher oral absorption and efficacy within the target organism spectrum. Lincosamides are generally the first-choice use antibiotic class in veterinary microbiology, most commonly used to combat skin infections. Potential clinical uses for lincosamide antibiotics in humans are numerous. They are efficacious in the treatment of dental infections, abdominal infections, abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease and anaerobic infections. Clindamycin alone has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of acne, toxic shock syndrome and malaria, and to decrease the risk of premature births in women with bacterial vaginosis. Lincosamide antibiotics may also be useful in the treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus.  Toxicity and interactions  While there have been no reports of severe organ toxicity from lincosamide treatment, gastrointestinal disturbances have been associated with their administration. Pseudomembranous enterocolitis resulting from clindamycin-induced disruption of gastrointestinal flora can be a lethal adverse event observed in several species when used in the veterinary clinic, particularly in horses. At extremely high doses of clindamycin, skeletal muscle paralysis has been demonstrated in several species. Lincosamides can interact with anesthetic agents to produce neuromuscular effects. Other adverse reactions include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and rash. Topical administration of clindamycin may induce contact dermatitis, dryness, burning, itching, scaliness and peeling of the skin.

The album would have been the follow-up to Warning (2000). In 2003, the album was nearly finished when the master tapes were mysteriously stolen from the band's studio. Instead of re-recording the album, the band decided to start from scratch, leading to the creation of American Idiot (2004). They were able to locate and recover the material and then decided to rework some of the original tracks and release them as B-sides to the singles from American Idiot. In an interview with NME on November 18, 2016, Armstrong and Dirnt stated that the master tapes are being used for new songs. History Lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong said the album's material was \\"good stuff\\". Musically, the material on Cigarettes and Valentines was hard, \\"quick-tempoed punk\\" songs in the vein of Green Day's Kerplunk and Insomniac. This sound would have contrasted the group's previous two studio albums, Nimrod and Warning, which displayed more rock and folk punk genres respectively. Bassist Mike Dirnt described the band's decision of returning to the sound found on their older albums, stating, \\"We've had a nice break from making hard and fast music and it's made us want to do it again.\\" However, Green Day would later call the theft a \\"blessing in disguise\\", believing the album wasn't \\"maximum Green Day\\". Dirnt admitted that backups of the tapes were made but claims that \\"it just wasn't the same as the originals\\". Cigarettes and Valentines was never even roughly mixed, according to various interviews with the band. The Network's album Money Money 2020, released on September 30, 2003, through Billie Joe Armstrong's Adeline Records, was speculated by some fans as being a re-recording of the album, or to contain aspects of it. Armstrong has denied any connection between the two projects in various interviews. Live performances and other appearances The title song, \\"Cigarettes and Valentines\\" was first played live at the concert in Greenwood Village, Colorado on August 28, 2010, during the band's concert at the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre while on their 21st Century Breakdown World Tour. This show was being filmed to eventually contribute to a forthcoming live album, leading to speculation that some of the songs from the Cigarettes and Valentines sessions would eventually be released. \\"Cigarettes and Valentines\\" saw an official release on Awesome as Fuck. \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", a B-side on the \\"American Idiot\\" single, was a track originally from Cigarettes and Valentines. On February 14, 2011, the official lyric video for the song was released on Green Day's official YouTube channel. Four days later, the official video for the song was released there as well. A live promo single was released on February 21, 2011 containing 2:43 of the performance in Phoenix, Arizona (the shots of the crowd are from the concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina).

Born in Algeria, he was arrested in his home in Bosnia, on October 8, 2001, shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001.Man linked to Bin Laden arrested in Bosnia, The Guardian, October 8, 2001 Bensayah Belkacem arrived at the Guantanamo detention camps on January 21, 2002, and was held there for . In October 2008, his case was heard by the US District Court for the District of Columbia, which recommended his continued detention. This was later overturned on appeal. Belkacem and five other men, native-born Algerians who were charity workers and colleagues of his, were arrested on suspicion of plotting to bomb the American embassy in Bosnia. They are known as the Algerian Six. The other five men were released in 2009. This followed the Supreme Court decision in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) that said the military commissions were unconstitutional and provided for detainees to have their habeas corpus petitions heard by the US federal civilian court. After reviewing their cases, US District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ruled each of the five was being held illegally, but he ordered the continued detention of Belkacem. His decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On June 28, 2010, a three-judge panel reversed Leon's ruling, holding that Belkacem could not be considered a member of al-Qaeda. The Justice Department said it would respond. On December 5, 2013, U.S. Department of Defense released a statement saying that Belkacem had been returned to Algeria.\\"Detainee Transfer Announced\\", U.S. Department of Defense, 2013-12-05 Background American intelligence officials had grown alarmed by an increase in the \\"chatter\\" in terrorist networks. After Belkacem's extrajudicial capture, news media reported that a search of his home turned up pro-jihadist material.\\"Terrorist material found in Sarajevo charity raid\\", The Guardian, February 23, 2002 He was eventually \\"accused of helping people who wanted to travel to Afghanistan and join Al Qaeda\\". He was transported January 21, 2002, to the Guantanamo detention camp and was there until late 2013. Detention in Cuba Bensayah was one of the first Guantanamo detainees to get a letter out describing the conditions there. In a letter his wife received in June 2002, he said that the detainees no longer had to defecate and urinate into plastic bags. The camp authorities had finally provided them with toilets. Writ of habeas corpus A writ of habeas corpus was submitted on behalf of the Algerian Six, including Bensayah Belkacem. On October 12, 2004, the Department of Defense released 40 pages of unclassified documents related to Belkacem's Combatant Status Review Tribunal. Continued detention On October 21, 2008, US District Court Judge Richard J. Leon ordered the release of five of the Algerians held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, following the US Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v. Bush (2008) and based on his review of their cases. He ordered the continued detention of Belkacem. =Appeal of Judge Leon's ruling= On September 15, 2009, a three- judge panel from the DC Circuit Court of Appeals started to review Leon's ruling on Belkacem. The panel ruled that their hearings would be held entirely in-camera. According to The Blog of Legal Times, a partially declassified brief to the appeal court by one of Belkacem's lawyers, of Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, had challenged Leon's reasoning because he had relied on \\"unfinished, conclusory intelligence reports and uncorroborated assertions from anonymous sources.\\" Fleming's brief had challenged Leon's ruling because he had not required the government to search for exculpatory evidence related to Belkacem. Fleming asserted that when the government had conducted its search, the classified evidence it provided to him in April 2009 eroded the government's allegations. On June 28, 2010, the panel reversed Leon's ruling, holding that Belkacem could not be considered a member of al-Qaeda. Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, writing for the panel, said that the U.S. Government had presented \\"no direct evidence of actual communication between Bensayah and any al-Qaeda member\\". Ginsburg noted that attorneys for the Obama administration had backed away from several arguments the Bush administration had previously made to Leon, including claims that Belkacem had communicated with Abu Zubaydah.Savage, Charlie. \\"Appeals court sides with detainee\\", The New York Times, 2010-07-04 According to The New York Times, \\"Still, Judge Ginsburg's opinion suggested that the appeals court ruling turned less on the recategorization of Mr. Bensayah's alleged ties to al-Qaeda than on skepticism about the basic credibility of the evidence the government presented against him.\\" As a result, the panel ordered the release of Belkacem. The Justice Department said it would respond. Release On December 5, 2013, U.S. Department of Defense announced that Belkacem had been transferred from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay to the Government of Algeria.

Foundation It was founded on 4 March 1883, at St. Joseph's Parish Hall at 10th & Howard, in San Francisco, California. The six founders were: * John McDade, the first grand president and subsequently first supreme president * James Smith, who later became a member of the Commerce Court in Washington DC * Edward Sheehan * William Ryan * William Gagan * George Maxwell Objects and purposes Its objects and purposes were: \\"Mutual aid and benevolence, the moral, social, and intellectual improvement of its members, and the proper development of sentiments of devotion to the Catholic Church and loyalty to our country, in accordance with its motto, 'Pro Deo, Pro Patria': 'For God, For Country'\\". History Membership was divided into three classes: * Benefit members, men between 18 and 45 years old who are eligible for death benefits * Associate members, who are not eligible for death benefits * Honorary members who are religious. Membership has always been limited to practicing Catholics. The organization spread through the United States, Canada and related territories, Hawaii and the Philippines. In 1900 it had a membership of 20,000 centered in California. It was strongly encouraged by the Archbishop of San Francisco, Patrick William Riordan and received the approbation of Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius X, as well as the approval of various members of the Catholic hierarchy in the territories that it operated in Present status The Young Men's Institute (YMI) is still active in a number of Catholic parishes in California, Hawaii and Indiana. Membership is at approximately 2000 men, who are recognized as \\"brothers\\". YMI membership is now divided into four categories: benefit members (18 to 45), associate members (those over 45), junior members (those ages 13-23 attending school full-time) and Honorary members (reserved for clergy). Annual dues are nominal for benefit and social members and free for junior and honorary members. The YMI runs a nominal death benefit program for its benefit members, a scholarship program via an essay contest, and has a national convention. In addition, the YMI hosts various sporting tournaments (i.e. bowling, golf and bocce ball), as well as an annual Red & White Mass (celebrating its anniversary) each March and a pasta bingo dinner each November. Through foundations under the YMI banner, the organization provides tuition assistance for the children of members that become deceased, as well as scholarships for seminarians to ease their path to the priesthood..

The early Muslims from Medina are called the Ansar (\\"helpers\\"). During Muhammad's era About a month after Hamzah's unsuccessful attack in the first caravan raid, Muhammad entrusted a party of sixty Muhajirun led by Ubaydah to conduct another operation at a Quraysh caravan that was returning from Syria and protected by one hundred men. The leader of this caravan was Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. The Muslim party went as far as Thanyatul-Murra, a watering place in Hejaz. No fighting took place, as the Quraysh were quite far from the place where Muslims were in the offing to attack the caravan. Nevertheless, Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas shot an arrow at the Quraysh. This is known as the first arrow of Islam. Despite this surprise attack, no fighting took place and the Muslims returned empty-handed. It is believed that Ubaydah was the first to carry the banner of Islam; others say Hamzah was the first to carry the first banner .Witness Pioneer \\"Pre-Badr Missions and Invasions\\" Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas was ordered to lead the third raid. His group consisted of about twenty Muhajirs. This raid was done about a month after the previous. Sa'd, with his soldiers, set up an ambush in the valley of Kharrar on the road to Mecca and waited to raid a returning Meccan caravan from Syria. But the caravan had already passed and the Muslims returned to Medina without a fight.Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar p. 127Mubarakpuri, Sealed Nectar, P 147 Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic. English version here Mu·∏•ammad Ibn  ªAbd al-WahhƒÅb, Mukhta·π£ar zƒÅd al-ma ªƒÅd, p. 345. The fourth raid, known as the invasion of Waddan, was the first offensive in which Muhammad took part personally with 70, mostly Muhajir, troops. It is said that twelve months after moving to Medina, Muhammad himself led a caravan raid to Waddan (Al-Abwa). The aim was to intercept the caravans of the Quraysh. The raid party did not meet any Quraysh during the raid. The fifth raid, known as the invasion of Buwat, was also commanded by Muhammad. A month after the raid at al-Abwa, he personally led 200 men including Muhajirs and Ansars to Bawat, a place on the caravan route of the Quraysh merchants. A herd of 1,500 camels, accompanied by 100 riders under the leadership of Umayyah ibn Khalaf, a Quraysh. The purpose of these raid was to get back what they lost when they migrated from Mecca to Medina to avoid persecution by Quraysh for practicing their religion. Quraysh seized the property and belongings left behind by Muslims and sold those.Mu·∏•ammad Ibn  ªAbd al-WahhƒÅb, Mukhta·π£ar zƒÅd al-ma ªƒÅd, p. 346.

Massachusetts is the 7th smallest state in the United States with an area of . It is bordered to the north by New Hampshire and Vermont, to the west by New York, to the south by Connecticut and Rhode Island, and to the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Massachusetts is the most populous New England state. Massachusetts is nicknamed \\"The Bay State\\" because of several large bays, which distinctly shape its coast: Massachusetts Bay and Cape Cod Bay, to the east; Buzzards Bay, to the south; and several cities and towns on the Massachusetts‚ÄìRhode Island border sit adjacent to Mount Hope Bay. At the southeastern corner of the state is a large, sandy, arm-shaped peninsula, Cape Cod. The islands Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket lie south of Cape Cod, across Nantucket Sound. Central Massachusetts features rolling, rocky hills, while Western Massachusetts encompasses a fertile valley and mountains surrounding the Connecticut River, as well as the Berkshire Mountains. Boston is Massachusetts' largest city, at the inmost point of Massachusetts Bay, the mouth of the Charles River. Most Bay Staters live in the Boston area, which covers most of eastern Massachusetts. Eastern Massachusetts is fairly densely populated and mostly suburban. Western Massachusetts features both the Connecticut River Valley--a fairly even mix of urban enclaves (e.g. Springfield, Northampton,) and rural college towns (Amherst, South Hadley)--and the Berkshire Mountains, (a branch of the Appalachian Mountains) that remains mostly rural. Massachusetts has 351 cities and towns. Every part of the state is within an incorporated city or town, but many towns include large rural areas. The state's 14 counties have few government functions and serve as little more than judicial districts. Overview In Eastern Massachusetts, Boston is located at the innermost point of Massachusetts Bay, at the mouth of the Charles River. The Charles River is longest river located entirely within Massachusetts, (although the Westfield River can be considered longer if one combines its upper and lower branches); however, the Connecticut River is the Commonwealth's--and New England's--longest, and most significant river. Most of the population of the Boston metropolitan area (approximately 4.4 million) lives outside of the city proper. The City of Boston itself is densely urban. Generally, Eastern Massachusetts, including and surrounding Boston, is densely populated. Boston's suburbs stretch as far west as the City of Worcester in Central Massachusetts. Central Massachusetts encompasses Worcester County, which is hilly and rocky. It features the urban city of Worcester, and the smaller cities of Fitchburg, Leominster, Gardner, and Southbridge. Central Massachusetts also includes many rural hill towns, forests, and small farms. The geographic center of Massachusetts is in the town of Rutland, in central Worcester County. The Quabbin Reservoir (formed by the dammed Swift River--a former Connecticut River tributary), borders the western side of the county; it is the main water supply for Greater Boston.The North Quabbin Woods: www.northquabbinwoods.org (map; see text on map). Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Retrieved January 14, 2007. The Connecticut River Valley features Massachusetts'--and some of the northeastern United States'--richest soil, due to Ice Age deposits by glacial Lake Hitchcock. The lower (southern) Connecticut River Valley features the city of Springfield, which sits a mere five miles (8 km) north of the Connecticut border at the confluence of three of Massachusetts' most significant rivers: the Connecticut (flowing north-south); the Westfield (flowing into the Connecticut from the west); and the Chicopee (flowing into the Connecticut from the east). Only separate Springfield from the State of Connecticut's capital city, Hartford--the Springfield-Hartford region is the second most populous region in New England (with approximately 1.9 million residents). Other cities in the Massachusetts portion of the New Haven- Hartford-Springfield arm of the Northeast megapolis include: Chicopee, Agawam, West Springfield, Westfield, Holyoke, and the college towns of Northampton, Amherst, and South Hadley. Further west rises a range of rolling, purple mountains known as the Berkshires. Near the New York border, the Taconic and Hoosac Ranges cross into Massachusetts; however, in general, the area is known as The Berkshires. The region was populated by Native Americans until the 18th century when Scotch-Irish settlers arrived, after having found the fertile lowlands along the Connecticut River settled. On reaching the Berkshires, settlers found poor soil for farming, but discovered numerous fast-moving rivers for industry. Pittsfield and North Adams grew into small, albeit prosperous cities. A number of smaller mill towns exist along the Westfield and Housatonic Rivers, interspersed with wealthy vacation resort towns. The National Park Service administers a number of natural and historical sites in Massachusetts. Along with twelve national historic sites, areas, and corridors, the National Park Service also manages the Cape Cod National Seashore and the Boston Harbor Islands National Recreation Area. In addition, the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation maintains a number of parks, trails, and beaches throughout the commonwealth. Physical geography  Massachusetts terrain features a low coastal plain in the east, the New England Uplands, the Pioneer Valley, and the Berkshire and Taconic Mountains in the west. Further west rises a range of rolling, purple mountains known as the Berkshires. Near the New York border, the Taconic and Hoosac Ranges cross into Massachusetts; however, in general, the area is known as The Berkshires. Massachusetts extends from the mountains of the Appalachian system in the west to the sandy beaches and rocky shorelines of the Atlantic coast. The entire state was covered in ice during the Wisconsin glaciation, which shaped today's landscape. Much of the state remains covered in glacial till and dotted with typical glacial features, such as kettle ponds, drumlins, eskers, and moraines. Apart from a few alluvial floodplains, soils tend to be rocky, acidic, and not very fertile. Part of the state is uplands of resistant metamorphic rock that were scraped by Pleistocene glaciers that deposited moraines and outwash on a large, sandy, arm-shaped peninsula called Cape Cod and the islands Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket to the south of Cape Cod. Upland elevations increase dramatically in Western Massachusetts. These uplands are interrupted by the downfaulted southern Pioneer Valley along the Connecticut River and further west by the Housatonic Valley separating the Berkshire Hills from the Taconic Range along the western border with New York. The highest peak in the state is Mount Greylock at near the northwest corner. =Topography= Elevation and relief are greatest in the western part of the state and increase somewhat from south to north. The Taconic Mountains, part of the Appalachian system, run along the western border with New York, reaching 2,624 feet (800 meters) at Mount Everett in the state's southwest corner, and including the state's highest point, Mount Greylock, at 3,491 feet (1,064 meters) in the northwest corner. The Housatonic-Hoosic valley separates the Taconics from The Berkshires, a broad belt of steeply rolling hills that are a southern extension of the Green Mountains of Vermont. They extend south to the border of Connecticut. Mount Greylock lies on the western edge of the Taconic Range, across the Hoosic River from the Hoosac Range to the east. The Hoosac Range connects the Green Mountains with the Berkshires.Forest Physiography: Physiography of the United States and Principles of Soils in Relation to Forestry, Isaiah Bowman (New York: Wiley and Sons, 1911): p. 681. Mount Greylock, in Berkshire County, is the highest point in Massachusetts, with an elevation of 3,491 feet (1,064 m). Between the Berkshires and the rest of the state lies the Connecticut River Valley, known within Massachusetts as the Pioneer Valley. This ancient rift valley appeared in the Mesozoic Era when North and South America broke away from Europe and Africa. Dinosaur footprints near Mount Tom bear witness to that era, and series of basalt and sedimentary rock ridges (collectively known as the Metacomet Ridge) including Mount Toby, Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, and others extending south to Long Island Sound and the valley's abrupt thousand-foot (300 meter) western escarpment illustrate the tectonic forces. More than a hundred million years later, as the Pleistocene epoch ended, receding glaciers left moraines that dammed the Connecticut River, creating Lake Hitchcock. Lacustrine silt deposits replaced soil scraped away by the glaciers, leaving behind deep, productive soil after the river breached the obstructing moraine and the lake disappeared. East of this valley is an area of rolling uplands dotted with lakes and dissected by streams flowing into the Connecticut River in the west and into the Merrimack, Quinebaug, Blackstone, or Charles rivers, or into other shorter, coastal rivers in the east. Just to the east of the Pioneer Valley, hills rise steeply toward the divide between the Connecticut River basin and the river basins to the east. This divide runs through central Massachusetts, though the summit of Mount Wachusett, the highest point in the state east of the Connecticut River, rising to 2,006 feet (611 meters). To the east of this divide, the elevation of the hilltops gradually decreases, and the landscape is more gently rolling. Within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of the coast, few hills exceed 300 feet (100 meters) in elevation. Near the coast, swamps, marshes, and ponds alternate with low hills. However, the Blue Hills, just south of Boston, rise above the surrounding landscape. The state probably takes its name from the Massachusett name for their highest point, Great Blue Hill, with an elevation of 635 feet (194 meters). Coastal landforms in Massachusetts The Massachusetts coastline is deeply indented with bays, coves, and estuaries, separated by narrow promontories. Some of these form natural harbors that gave rise to the state's historic ports, including Newburyport, Gloucester, Salem, Boston, and New Bedford. The state has a few small barrier islands, the largest of which is Plum Island. The state's largest promontory is the Cape Cod peninsula. Its backbone is formed by glacial moraines, but much of its coastline has been shaped by the longshore drift of coastal sand, which forms many of its famous sandy beaches. To the south of Cape Cod, glacial moraines rise above the ocean surface to form the state's largest islands: Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and Monomoy Island. =Climate= Massachusetts map of K√∂ppen climate classification. Massachusetts has a humid continental climate. Summers are warm, while winters are relatively cold, with average January temperatures below freezing throughout most of the state. Generally, Massachusetts' hilly central interior (e.g. Worcester) and its western Berkshire Mountain region (e.g. Pittsfield) have colder winters than its coastal and Connecticut River Valley regions. Stockbridge, in the Berkshires, has a January average temperature of 21.6 ¬∞F (-5.8 ¬∞C). In Eastern Massachusetts, Boston, on the coast of Massachusetts Bay, has an average January temperature of 29.0 ¬∞F (-1.7 ¬∞C). The island of Martha's Vineyard has the state's highest average temperature‚Äî31.8 ¬∞F (-0.1 C), due to the warming effect of the Atlantic Ocean. Summer temperatures are highest in the state's urban centers, due to the heat island effect. Average July temperatures in Massachusetts' three most populous urban centers are: Boston (coastal) - 81.7 ¬∞F (27.6 ¬∞C); Worcester (central) - 79.2 ¬∞F (26.2 ¬∞C); and Springfield (Connecticut River Valley) - 85.0 ¬∞F (29.44 ¬∞C). By contrast, the coolest average summer temperatures occur in the Berkshires and on the state's offshore islands. The average temperature in August, the warmest month on Nantucket Island, is 68.7 ¬∞F (20.4 ¬∞C). The average in July in Stockbridge is 68.9 ¬∞F (20.5 ¬∞C). Both daily and seasonal variation in temperature are greatest in the Berkshires and lowest along the coast. Precipitation is spread fairly evenly throughout the year in Massachusetts. Boston averages 43 in (1091 mm) of precipitation annually, with a maximum monthly average of 4.3 in (109.2 mm) in November and a minimum monthly average of 2.9 in (73.7 mm) in July. Springfield, in the Pioneer Valley, averages 45.8 in (1163.9 mm) of annual precipitation, with a 4.6 in (116.8 mm) maximum monthly average in June and a 2.7 in (68.6 mm) minimum monthly average in February. Interior Massachusetts tends to have a summer precipitation maximum due to convection in air masses heated over the interior, which gives rise to frequent thunderstorms. These occur less frequently over the coast, due to the relative lack of convection over the cooler ocean waters. On the other hand, cold, dry air masses over the interior of the state tend to suppress winter precipitation. All regions of Massachusetts experiences substantial snowfall in a typical winter; however, generally, coastal areas (e.g. Boston, Cape Cod,) and the Connecticut River Valley (e.g. Springfield) receive approximately 2/3 the amount of snowfall of central Massachusetts (e.g. Worcester) and the Berkshires (e.g. Pittsfield.) Total annual snowfalls average 43.3 in (110.0 cm) in Boston; 43.2 in (109.7 cm) in Springfield; and 69.1 in (175.5 cm) in Worcester. The ground is often covered with snow for weeks at a time during January and February. Although Massachusetts has a humid climate, its climate is sunny compared to other humid climates at the same latitude. In Boston, the average percentage of possible sunshine for every month is at least 50%. In summer and early autumn, the average percentage of possible sunshine is greater than 60%, according to National Weather Service data. The hottest temperature recorded was 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42.8 degrees Celsius). =Ecology= The primary biome of inland Massachusetts is temperate deciduous forest. Although much of the state had been cleared for agriculture, leaving only traces of old growth forest in isolated pockets, secondary growth has regenerated in many rural areas as farms have been abandoned.Stocker, Carol. Old growth, grand specimens drive big-tree hunters The Boston Globe. Novemberttp://www.umass.edu/ruralmass/currentresearch.html The areas most affected by human development include the Greater Boston area in the east, the smaller Springfield metropolitan area in the west, and the largely agricultural Pioneer Valley. Animals that have become locally extinct over the past few centuries include gray wolves, elk, wolverines, and mountain lions. Many coastal areas in Massachusetts provide breeding areas for species such as the piping plover. A number of species are doing well, despite, and in some cases because of the increased urbanization of the commonwealth. Peregrine falcons utilize office towers in larger cities as nesting areas, and the population of coyotes, whose diet may include garbage and roadkill, has been increasing in recent decades. White-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys and eastern gray squirrels are also found throughout Massachusetts. In more rural areas in the western part of the state, larger mammals such as moose and black bears have returned, largely due to reforestation following the regional decline in agriculture. Massachusetts is located along the Atlantic Flyway, a major route for migratory waterfowl along the Atlantic coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for the common loon, while a significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover. Protected areas such as the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of gray seals. Freshwater fish species in the commonwealth include bass, carp, catfish, and trout, while saltwater species such as Atlantic cod, haddock and American lobster populate offshore waters. Other marine species include harbor seals, the endangered North Atlantic right whales, as well as humpback whales, fin whales, minke whales and Atlantic white-sided dolphins. =Environment= Most of Massachusetts is forested. Even suburban eastern Massachusetts is heavily wooded. Trees tend to grow around houses in this region, such that when one looks out over eastern Massachusetts from the top of a high hill, one sees a vista of treetops, punctuated only occasionally by a church steeple, smokestack, or radio tower. According to U.S. government data , 46% of Massachusetts land is devoted to forest. Another 7% is rural parkland, which is also mainly forested. Urban and suburban development takes up 36% of the state's land, but even this land, outside of the main urban centers, consists largely of houses on wooded properties. About 4% of the state's land is cropland, and less than 1% is pasture. About 2% of the state's land is marsh or other wetland. The remainder of the land is taken up with other uses, such as transportation. Three ecoregions comprise the natural environment of Massachusetts. Atlantic coastal pine barrens occur on Cape Cod, Nantucket, and Martha's Vineyard. These are fire-prone temperate coniferous forests growing on the sandy soils of the coastal plain. The other two ecoregions are temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. Across most of the state, including eastern Massachusetts, south central Massachusetts, and the Connecticut River Valley, the Northeastern coastal forests are a mix of hardwood deciduous oak, maple, beech, hickory and coniferous pine trees. In the Berkshires and north central Massachusetts, the more boreal New England-Acadian forests prevail. These consists mainly of coniferous spruce and hemlock, occasional pine, and deciduous birch trees. Roughly since the Civil War, farms have reverted to woodland. Lumbering activity has decreased in recent decades, so the more undisturbed forests have reclaimed some characteristics of old growth. The forests (and wooded suburbs) are home to a variety of invertebrate and vertebrate animal species. The state has an abundance of white-tailed deer, and there have been concerns about deer overpopulation because many of the deer's natural predators, such as wolves, have historically been hunted to extinction within Massachusetts. However, coyotes have been moving into Massachusetts to fill the ecological niche formerly occupied by wolves. Bears, wild turkey, and even moose have returned from northern refuges. In 1846 Thoreau traveled to Northern Maine to observe and write about moose, which he thought were well on the way to extinction. If he were alive today, he might find them almost within walking distance of Walden Pond. Pollution, dams, and introduction of exotic species have decimated some native fish populations. Efforts to mitigate these problems and restore Atlantic salmon to the Connecticut River watershed have had very little success. The other widespread native salmonid, the brook trout, persists in cold upland streams, particularly above waterfalls and other barriers that exclude introduced brown and rainbow trout. American shad runs have retained at least a fraction of their former abundance, and smallmouth bass, sunfish, and pike populations are healthy enough to support angling. Wetlands, including swamps and both salt- and fresh-water marshes, are important ecologically in Massachusetts. Many of the state's fish and bird species inhabit wetland environments. The state's urban environments are partly wooded but also bear a heavy load of built structures and human environments that are not hospitable to many other species. At the same time, pollutants in waterways, mainly from urban sources, can be toxic to many species or may support algae and bacteria that lead to hypoxia and the death of aquatic animals. However, Greater Boston boasts extensive parklands, and efforts have been made in Massachusetts to reduce environmental pollution in both urban and rural parts of the state. =Settlement= Map showing the primary cities, roads, and physical features of Massachusetts The Northeast megalopolis extends into Massachusetts. It occupies most of eastern Massachusetts starting at Worcester as well as the Springfield-Holyoke-Northampton urbanization that joins Connecticut's Hartford-New Haven urbanization. According to the definitions of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), all of Massachusetts falls within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), except for the offshore islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. According to 2005 Census estimates, 62% of the population of Massachusetts lives within the Boston MSA. Other Massachusetts metropolitan areas are the Worcester MSA (with 12% of the state's population), the Springfield MSA (11%), the Providence-Fall River-New Bedford MSA (9%), the Barnstable (Cape Cod) MSA (4%), and the Pittsfield MSA (2%). Massachusetts Population Density Map In each of these metropolitan areas, population is concentrated in a number of densely populated cities and towns. In the Boston MSA, for example, the City of Boston and a cluster of densely populated inner suburbs within the Route 128 belt account for more than half of the population of the metropolitan area. The older cities of Lawrence, Lowell, and Brockton lie outside this urban core but are also densely populated. However, population is growing fastest in the outer peripheries of the state's metropolitan areas, where new housing construction is adding dwelling units. While the state as a whole shows little population growth, or even a population decline in some years due to a net loss from migration, the belt of towns along Interstate 495, near the western edge of the Boston MSA, shows steady population growth. The Springfield and Worcester MSAs include some very thinly populated rural areas. In the Berkshires and in the hills west of Worcester are a number of towns with population densities below 40 per square mile (compared with the state average of 810 per square mile). Although the U.S. Census Bureau prepares population estimates for MSAs, these statistical units are defined by county borders. Because Massachusetts counties are relatively large and may contain several urban centers, MSAs are an imprecise way to describe the state's urban clusters. For example, Lawrence, Lowell, and Brockton all have closer economic ties with neighboring towns than they do with one another. The Lowell region draws commuters from nearby New Hampshire who might not consider commuting all the way to Boston. Yet these areas are all part of the Boston MSA. Similarly, the cities of Leominster and Fitchburg form the core of a distinct urban cluster. Because they lie within Worcester County, however, they are considered part of the Worcester MSA. =Economic geography= A finer-grained statistical unit than the MSA is the New England City and Town Area, or NECTA. NECTAs take advantage of the administrative subdivision of the entire territory of Massachusetts and other New England states into towns and cities. (No part of Massachusetts is unincorporated county territory.) Each NECTA consists of a cluster of cities and towns defined by commuting patterns, which therefore correspond roughly to local labor markets. While the U.S. Census Bureau defines metropolitan areas by county boundaries, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) offers data on employment by NECTA. By far the largest NECTA in Massachusetts is the Boston- Cambridge-Quincy (Greater Boston) NECTA, which covers eastern Massachusetts and extends into southern New Hampshire. This NECTA consists of a central Boston-Cambridge-Quincy NECTA Division, including the City of Boston and the surrounding cities and suburbs. The other satellite NECTA divisions in the Greater Boston NECTA are the Brockton-Bridgewater-Easton NECTA Division, the Framingham NECTA Division, the Haverhill-North Andover-Amesbury NECTA Division (extending well into southeastern New Hampshire), the Lawrence-Methuen-Salem NECTA Division (extending into southern New Hampshire), the Lowell-Billerica- Chelmsford (or Lowell) NECTA Division (extending into southern New Hampshire), the Lynn-Peabody-Salem NECTA Division, the Nashua NECTA Division (mainly in New Hampshire but including a few Massachusetts towns), and the Taunton- Norton-Raynham NECTA Division. The other Massachusetts metropolitan NECTAs are the Barnstable Town NECTA (covering most of Cape Cod), the Leominster- Fitchburg-Gardner NECTA (in north central Massachusetts), the New Bedford NECTA (in southeastern Massachusetts), the Pittsfield NECTA (in far western Massachusetts), the Springfield NECTA (in the Pioneer Valley and extending into northern Connecticut), and the Worcester NECTA (in central Massachusetts, extending into northeastern Connecticut). According to the BLS, total nonfarm employment in Massachusetts in 2005 was about 3.2 million. About half of these jobs were located in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy NECTA Division, which lies entirely within Massachusetts, although this NECTA accounted for only about 43% of the state's population, according to 2005 Census estimates. This indicates either a higher labor participation rate in central Greater Boston or a surplus of commuters traveling to work from other parts of Massachusetts or neighboring states. Clearly, Greater Boston dominates the employment and economy of Massachusetts. The other major centers of employment in Massachusetts are the Springfield and Worcester NECTAs. The Springfield NECTA accounts for slightly more than 10% of the jobs in Massachusetts, while the Worcester NECTA accounts for slightly less than 10% of the state's jobs. (Although both of these NECTAs extend into Connecticut, the towns that they include in Connecticut account for only a small portion of their population and, probably, of their employment). In every Massachusetts NECTA, service- sector jobs far outnumber goods-producing (natural resources, construction, and manufacturing) jobs. Beyond this generalization, there are some differences in the employment and economic structures of the state's NECTAs and NECTA divisions. In the far southeastern corner of Massachusetts, the Barnstable Town NECTA, nearly coterminous with the summer resort region of Cape Cod, has an atypical employment structure. It has the lowest share of employment in goods-producing jobs, which account for only 9.5% of its employment. Most of these jobs are in the construction sector. Manufacturing jobs account for only 3.3% of employment, compared with 9.6% for the state as a whole. On the other hand, the Cape Cod NECTA has the state's highest percentages of employment in retail trade (17.9%, versus 11.1% for the state) and in leisure and hospitality (16.9%, versus 9.1% for the state). These numbers reflect the continuing importance to Cape Cod of summer tourism. The central Boston-Cambridge-Quincy division of the larger NECTA with the same name also has a relatively low percentage (6.7%) of manufacturing employment. Although this division accounts for about half of the state's total employment, it has only about a third of the state's manufacturing jobs. Its largest manufacturing subsector is the production of computers and electronic products (28% of the division's manufacturing jobs). This subsector is centered not in Boston's urban core, but in the suburbs to the north and west, along Route 128. The economy of central Greater Boston is even more biased toward service provision than that of the rest of the state. The particular economic strength of central Greater Boston is knowledge-intensive activities. It accounts for 62.2% of the state's information sector jobs, and 66.0% of the jobs in the software-publishing subsector. Central Greater Boston has 68.8% of the state's financial sector jobs, and 92.5% of the jobs in the investment subsector. It has 69.3% of the state's jobs in management and technical consulting. Greater Boston is noted nationwide for its prestigious institutions of higher education, such as Harvard University and MIT, and the region is home to 77.8% of the state's higher-education employment. Together, the knowledge-intensive information, financial, professional and business services, and education sectors account for 36.6% of the jobs in central Greater Boston, compared with 28.8% of the jobs in Massachusetts as a whole and 23.2% for the United States as a whole. The satellite NECTA divisions that lie on the periphery of the Greater Boston NECTA all have higher percentages of employment in manufacturing than central Greater Boston or than Massachusetts as a whole. Many of these satellite NECTA divisions are centered on historic manufacturing cities, such as Haverhill, Lawrence, Lowell, Lynn, and Brockton. The BLS breaks down manufacturing employment only for the Framingham and Lowell NECTA divisions, to the west and northwest of Boston, respectively. In both of these divisions, computer and electronics manufacturing accounts for well over half of manufacturing employment. Except for Lowell, these satellite NECTA divisions also have higher shares of employment in retail trade than central Greater Boston or Massachusetts as a whole. These divisions, located along the major highways radiating from Boston, are particularly rich in shopping centers and wholesalers. The Lowell and Framingham divisions have even higher shares of employment in the information sector than central Greater Boston. This reflects the strength of these regions in the software publishing and telecommunications subsectors. On the other hand, these satellite divisions have lower shares of employment in financial services and in health and education services than the state average, reflecting the regional dominance of central Greater Boston in these areas. The Framingham division, however, has the state's highest percentage of jobs in professional and business services (18.5% of employment versus 14.4% statewide), reflecting that region's strength in technology. The New Bedford NECTA has the state's second-highest percentage (16.6%) of manufacturing employment. It has the state's lowest percentages of employment in the financial sector (3.1%) and in professional and business services (6.25%). The Leominster-Fitchburg-Gardner NECTA has the state's highest percentage (17.8%) of manufacturing employment. It has by far the state's lowest percentage of employment (1.0%) in the information sector and the second-lowest rate of employment in professional and business services (6.73%). On the other hand, this NECTA has the state's highest percentage of employment (16.4%) in government. The Worcester NECTA has a relatively high percentage (12.0%) of employment in manufacturing. Next to the Barnstable Town NECTA, it has a high percentage (14.9%) of employment in the healthcare sector. It has the lowest percentage of employment (8.7%) in the leisure and hospitality sector, reflecting the relative underdevelopment of its tourism industry. The Springfield NECTA also has relatively high (12.9%) manufacturing employment. It has the state's largest percentage of employment in the transportation and utilities subsector (4.5%, versus 2.6% for the state as a whole). It has the second-highest percentage (16.3%) of jobs in government. Despite the small size of the Pittsfield NECTA, its employment by sector is similar to that of Massachusetts as a whole for most sectors. However, it has the state's highest percentage of employment (20.4%) in the education and healthcare sector. It also has the second-highest share of employment (13.2%) in the leisure and hospitality sector. This reflects the importance of tourism in the Berkshires to the region's economy.

The principal ingredients are rice flour and water. Sometimes ingredients such as tapioca or corn starch are added in order to improve the transparency or increase the gelatinous and chewy texture of the noodles. Rice noodles are most common in the cuisines of East, Southeast Asia and South Asia. They are available fresh, frozen, or dried, in various shapes, thicknesses and textures. Fresh noodles are also highly perishable; their shelf life may be just several days. History The origin of rice noodles dates back to China during the Qin dynasty when people from northern China invaded the south. Due to climatic conditions, the northern Chinese have traditionally preferred wheat and millet which grew in cold weather while the southern Chinese preferred rice which grew in hot weather. Noodles are traditionally made out of wheat and eaten throughout northern China so to adapt, northern cooks tried to prepare \\"noodles\\" using rice, thus inventing rice noodles. Over time rice noodles and their processing methods have been introduced around the world, becoming especially popular in Southeast Asia. The shelf life may be extended by drying and removing its moisture content. Studies of drying rice noodles were conducted by the International Food Research Journal.

Andresen, c. 1930 Ivar Frithiof Andresen (July 27, 1896 - November 6, 1940), was a Norwegian opera singer who pursued a successful international career in Europe and the United States. Andresen was the first Norwegian to perform at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City (preceding his famous compatriot, the great Wagnerian soprano Kirsten Flagstad, by five years). A bass, he appeared in operas composed by Wagner, Mozart and Verdi. Andresen was born in Kristiania. After making his debut in Stockholm in 1919, he worked at ' (now ', or Royal Swedish Opera), from 1921 to 1926. He then performed at the Dresden Semperoper (in 1926-1931) and the St√§dtische Oper Berlin (1931-1935), and also appeared as a guest artist at the New York Met (1930-1932) and the Bayreuth Festival (1927-1931). In England, he sang at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1928-1931 and at the Glyndebourne Festival in 1935. Andresen's singing earned considerable critical acclaim during his appearances in England, America and Germany, but developing health problems would curtail his career, and he died at the age of 44, in Stockholm, during the early stages of World War II. He left, however, a sizeable legacy of 78-rpm gramophone recordings made in the 1920s and 1930s, which have been re-issued on compact disc. Today, in Norway, Andresen is probably best known not for being an opera star, but for adorning the box of the cough-drop brand \\"IFA\\", produced by the Nidar company. Since the 1930s, his face has been seen on the package, along with a quote recommending the product to \\"singers, public speakers, smokers and athletes\\". Ivar F.

It replaced the Surrey Quarter Sessions for local government functions in the administrative county of Surrey. The council was originally headquartered in Newington where the quarter sessions court had been located. However it moved to County Hall, Kingston upon Thames in 1893 as Newington and the part of Surrey that had been in the Metropolitan Board of Works district had become part of the County of London in 1889. Kingston upon Thames became part of Greater London in 1965, but the headquarters remain there. In November 2019 Surrey County Council announced that the headquarters would relocate to Woking. =Post-1974= The Local Government Act 1972 led to Surrey becoming a non-metropolitan county.

Sturges was nominated for a 1945 Academy Award for his screenplay. Many critics consider the film to be one of Sturges's best.TCM Notes It was the eighth film he made for Paramount Pictures, and also his last, although The Great Moment was released after it. Sturges later wrote about his departure \\"I guess Paramount was glad to be rid of me eventually, as no one there ever understood a word I said.\\" In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith (Eddie Bracken) is a small town boy whose father, \\"Hinky Dinky\\" Truesmith, was a Marine who died a hero in World War I. Woodrow has been discharged from the Marine Corps after only a month owing to his chronic hay fever. Rather than disappoint his mother (Georgia Caine), he pretends to be fighting overseas in World War II while secretly working in a San Diego shipyard. In a chance encounter in a bar he buys a round of drinks for six Marines back from the Battle of Guadalcanal headed by Master Gunnery Sergeant Heffelfinger (William Demarest). It transpires that Heffelfinger had served with Woodrow's father in the 6th Marines in World War I. One of the Marines decides to telephone Woodrow's mother, telling her that he has received a medical discharge, so she will not have to worry about him. Woodrow is vehemently opposed to the fraud, but the Marines are all for it. Heffelfinger embellishes the charade by having Woodrow swap coats with one of the Marines that have the 1st Marine Division Battle Blaze and Pacific Theatre of Operations medals on it. When they step off the train, the seemingly harmless deception has escalated beyond control; the entire town turns out to greet its homegrown hero. With an election coming up, the citizens decide to make an unwilling Woodrow their candidate against the pompous current mayor, Mr. Noble (Raymond Walburn). Complicating matters even further, Woodrow had written his girlfriend Libby (Ella Raines), telling her not to wait for him. She has since gotten engaged to Forrest Noble (Bill Edwards), the mayor's son. Finally, Woodrow can stand it no longer. He confesses everything at a campaign rally and goes home to pack. Libby breaks her engagement and tells Woodrow she is going with him. Meanwhile, Heffelfinger praises Woodrow's courage in telling the truth to the stunned townsfolk, and after considering the matter, they decide that Woodrow has just the qualities they need in a mayor.

The score also contains excerpts from \\"Hail the Conquering Hero\\" from Judas Maccabeus by George Frideric Handel.IMDB SoundtracksTCM Music Production Hail the Conquering Hero had a number of working titles on its way to the screen. An early title was \\"Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition\\", and \\"Once Upon a Hero\\" and \\"The Little Marine\\" were also used. Although The Great Moment, which had been filmed before Hail the Conquering Hero, was released after it, this film was the last that Sturges made for Paramount Pictures, as his contract ran out and he left the studio even before the film was completely edited. He and the studio had numerous conflicts over editorial control, censorship problems and other issues on The Great Moment and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. The studio also balked at Sturges' repeated use of the same bit actors again and again in most of his Paramount films, what has been called his \\"stock company\\" or \\"repertory troupe.\\" The studio was concerned that people would get tired of seeing the same faces, and wanted Sturges to use different actors, which he refused to do: \\"I always replied that these little players who had contributed so much to my first hits had a moral right to work in my subsequent pictures.\\" There were also conflicts with the studio about this film: Paramount wanted actress Ella Raines, who was playing \\"Libby\\", to be replaced: not only did they feel she did not look like a small-town girl, but she did not have enough box-office draw, and with the other lead roles being taken by Bracken and Demarest, the studio was concerned that the film would not have enough star power to be effectively sold. But filming had already started, and Sturges refused to replace her. > I said that had [producer] Buddy [DeSylva] been there and objected to her > casting at its inception, I would of course have agreed. But to have her > thrown off the picture after she had been announced for the part and had > started shooting, with all the publicity that engendered, would ruin her > career. It seems very unimportant now whether she was kept in or thrown out. > It seemed very important then. I had read Cervantes. I should have known > about tilting at windmills. (Raines' career did not last long in any event: she retired in 1957.) It was customary at the time for the War Department to review scripts which dealt with military matters, but the revisions they requested were minor. Filming began on Hail the Conquering Hero on July 14, 1943, and continued through September 11 of that year. Sturges had designed the film to be relatively small scale, and he re-used sets left over from The Miracle of Morgan's Creek. After an unsuccessful preview in New York City, the film was recut by producer Buddy G. DeSylva, as Sturges had already left Paramount. After another unsuccessful preview - and, not coincidentally, after The Miracle of Morgan's Creek had been released and become a smash hit - DeSylva accepted Sturges' offer to return, unpaid, and rewrite the script. Retakes, directed by Sturges, were done from April 7 to April 11, 1944. Sturges restored his overall conception of the film.TCM Overview The film was released on August 9, 1944.IMDB Release dates Sharp-eyed viewers may have noted that in the scene where the Marines leave the Oakdale station, a billboard behind them advertises The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, the film that Sturges made, also starring Eddie Bracken, immediately before this one. Reviews were uniformly excellent, with Bosley Crowther writing in the New York Times that it was \\"one of the wisest [movies] ever to burst from a big-time studio.\\" Sturges exulted that, \\"It proves that a good story can lick its weight in stars and pomposity any day.\\" Hail the Conquering Hero was released on video on November 15, 1990, on laserdisc on October 26, 1994, and was re-released on video on June 30, 1993.TCM Misc. notes It was released on DVD (as part of a seven disc set entitled Preston Sturges - The Filmmaker Collection) on November 21, 2006. Awards and honors Sturges was nominated for a 1945 Academy Award for his screenplay for Hail the Conquering Hero, and was nominated in the same category that same year for his screenplay for The Miracle of Morgan's Creek.

The New York Times named the film one of the \\"Ten Best Films of 1944\\".Allmovie Awards Analysis One writer described Hail the Conquering Hero as \\"a satire on mindless hero-worship, small-town politicians, and something we might call \\"Mom-ism,\\" the almost idolatrous reverence that Americans have for the institution of Motherhood,\\" and Sturges himself said that of all his films, it was \\"the one with the least wrong with it.\\" The film has the normal hallmarks of Sturges' best work: an extremely fast pace, overlapping dialogue, and rapid-fire punch lines. Monty Python's Terry Jones called it \\"like a wonderful piece of clockwork.\\"Frankel, Mark \\"Hail the Conquering Hero\\" (TCM article) The film can be seen as a look at both patriotism and hero worship in America during World War II, and while adhering to the requirements of the Hollywood Production Code - even more restrictive in wartime than before - in retrospect it can be seen as somewhat critical of people's willingness at that time to uncritically embrace heroes. In this regard it is a companion piece to The Miracle of Morgan's Creek, the previous Sturges satirical venture.

It was released on 10 May 1982 by Missing Link Records in Australia and by 4AD in the UK. It was the group's last full-length studio recording. It has received critical acclaim. Background Junkyard was inspired by American Southern Gothic imagery, dealing with extreme subjects like an evangelist's murdered daughter. Anita Lane co-wrote two songs for the album, \\"Dead Joe\\" and \\"Kiss me Black\\", with Nick Cave who was her boyfriend at the time. The album was a somewhat transitional record for a variety of reasons. On 16 February 1982 in Melbourne, Tracy Pew (the band's bass player) was arrested for drunk driving. For this and several other outstanding offences he served 2.5 months in Pentridge Prison in Australia, and so Barry Adamson played bass on several tracks of the album's tracks. In addition to his usual guitar, Mick Harvey played drums on a few songs, anticipating the upcoming termination of founding member Phill Calvert and the band's subsequent switch from quintet to quartet. Recording and artwork The album was recorded with Tony Cohen at Armstrong's Audio Visual (A.A.V.) Studios in Melbourne in December 1981 and January 1982. Additional tracks were recorded in London's Matrix Studios with punk producer Richard Mazda in March 1982. Mazda's previous work with ATV and The Fall had brought him to their attention. Later CD reissues added the \\"Release the Bats/Blast Off!\\" single recorded at London's Townhouse Studio with Nick Launay in April 1981. A second version of \\"Dead Joe\\" - originally featured on the MasterBAG August 1982 flexi-disc - also appears on the re- issue. The cover art is by Ed Roth and Dave Christensen. Critical reception Critic Ned Raggett called the album a \\"scuzzy masterpiece\\" that saw \\"Cave's now-demonic vocals in full roar while the rest of the players revamped rhythm & blues and funk into a blood-soaked exorcism.\\" Julian Marszalek of The Quietus writes that \\"Junkyard still sounds as if it‚Äôs waiting for rock music to catch up with it,\\" calling it \\"a high example of uncompromised music and art [...] that exists purely on its own terms.\\" In October 2010, Junkyard was listed at No. 17 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums.

A left-handed batsman and a right-arm off break bowler, he played his domestic cricket for Kent County Cricket Club and was appointed as County Captain for the 2013 season. He made his debut for Kent in the 2001 season, nine days before his first appearance for England Under-19s. He often fielded at slip. He was part of the one-day set-up for Kent since 2002, but did not secure a regular place in the first-class County Championship team until 2007, a year after taking his maiden ten-wicket haul. He was selected as part of the England One Day International (ODI) squad to tour New Zealand in 2007‚Äì08, but had to wait until 2010 to make his international debut. After impressing during the 2009 season with Kent, helping the team gain promotion back to the first division of the County Championship, Tredwell played his first Test and ODIs against Bangladesh in March 2010. His Twenty20 International debut followed two years later. He tool 78 wickets in 74 international matches. In September 2018, Tredwell announced his retirement from cricket having been injured for the entire 2018 domestic season after making five appearances in Kent's pre-season campaign in the West Indies 2017‚Äì18 Regional Super50 competition. In 2019 he was appointed to the ECB National Umpires Panel, qualifying him to stand as an umpire in Second XI and Minor Counties fixtures.Cox hits 135 in Second XI win, Kent County Cricket Club, 8 May 2019.

Retrieved 2017-11-17. Tredwell has continued to play cricket for Folkestone in the Kent Cricket League. He made three appearances in youth Test matches for England Under-19 cricket team against the West Indies in August 2001. He made his debut in the first Test at Grace Road, Leicester, alongside future Test cricketers James Anderson and Matt Prior. He claimed six wickets during the series, at an average of 32.50. He was offered a contract with Kent County Cricket Club in 2001 after playing for the youth team. He was one of 14 players who were selected for the ECB National Academy in Loughborough in 2003‚Äì04, and the subsequent tours of Malaysia and India. County cricket He made his first List A appearance for Kent Cricket Board against Worcestershire Cricket Board in the first round of the 2000 NatWest Trophy, when he was run out for ten and took one wicket. He also appeared in the subsequent two rounds of the competition, until Hampshire knocked them out in the third round. He spent the remainder of the 2000 season playing for Kent Second XI. He once again appeared in the first three rounds of the renamed 2001 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy, scoring 71 opening against Buckinghamshire in the second round, and 57 from the same position in the third round defeat to Warwickshire. His first-class debut for Kent came later in the same season, against Leicestershire in July 2001, claiming the wicket of Aftab Habib as his first scalp in a match that Kent won by three wickets at Grace Road. His one-day debut for Kent County Cricket Club came in the 2002 Benson & Hedges Cup, where in a rain-reduced match, he claimed the wicket of Owais Shah as he finished with one wicket for 26 runs. He made 19 List A appearances for Kent in 2002, finishing the season with 21 wickets at an average of 23.76. He played just two County Championship games in 2005, but played extensively in the one-day game, earning an extension to his contract. He became more involved with the Championship side in 2007, scoring his maiden first-class century (116*) against Yorkshire, and returning then career-best bowling figures of 6/47 against Surrey. He was part of the side that won the 2007 Twenty20 Cup, beating Gloucestershire in the final. At the end of the 2008 season, Kent were relegated from the first division of the County Championship, and they spent one season in the second division, achieving promotion at the end of the 2009 season by winning the second division title. During their promotion winning season, Tredwell took his career-best bowling figures, claiming 8/66 in a match against Glamorgan, a performance that gave him the leading bowling figures in the County Championship's second division. He finished the 2009 season with 69 first-class wickets at an average of 26.63; the first season in which he had taken more than 40 wickets or more than one five-wicket haul. He was also the second-highest wicket taker in the division behind leg-spinner Danish Kaneria (75). Tredwell was named as captain of Kent for the 2013 season, replacing Robert Key. During his captaincy, Tredwell was called up to play for England in the Champions Trophy and then the one-day series against New Zealand and later against Australia. He found juggling both the Kent captaincy and his international commitments difficult and, as a result he resigned the captaincy to be replaced by the returning Key in November 2013. In March 2016 Tredwell was selected to represent the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in the Champion County match against Yorkshire in Abu Dhabi. He took six wickets in the match, bowling 65 overs in the match.Spinners enjoy profitable day in Abu Dhabi, CricInfo, 2016-03-22. Retrieved 2016-03-23. International career Tredwell's performances during the 2007 domestic season and with the Performance Squad in India over the winter of 2007‚Äì08, led to his first call-up to the England One Day International (ODI) squad in January 2008 for a series of matches against New Zealand. He did not play in any of the matches on the tour and was not called up again by England until December 2009 when a series of injuries in the England senior squad on tour in South Africa prompted his call-up to England's squad. Coach Andy Flower described him as a \\"like for like\\" replacement for Graeme Swann in case Swann's side injury worsened. Once again he did not play a game as England won the ODI series 2‚Äì1. Tredwell finally made his debut for England against Bangladesh in an ODI in March 2010, finishing with figures of 0/52 from 10 overs. He made his Test match debut in the second Test against Bangladesh, taking six wickets on debut as well as scoring 37 runs in England's first innings. Tredwell played his first match for England on home soil in the return series, taking 0/18 at Trent Bridge. =World Cup and Champions Trophy, 2011‚Äì2013= After touring Australia in 2010‚Äì11, Tredwell played in two matches during England's 2011 World Cup campaign, winning the Player of the Match award in the teams' final group match against West Indies, with bowling figures of 4/48. The 2012 season saw him play in home matches against Australia and South Africa before touring India later in the year, making his Twenty20 International debut on the tour. By the start of 2013 Tredwell had established himself as a key part of England's limited overs team and he played in all five matches against India, taking his best ODI figures of 4/44 during the tour. He played in all three T20I matches on England's tour of New Zealand. He went into the 2013 Champions Trophy as England's main spin bowler, playing in four of the team's five matches. He took 3/19 in the semi- final against South Africa and played in the rain-affected final against India, taking 1/25 as England narrowly lost by five runs. More games followed: Tredwell played T20Is against New Zealand, captioning the side in one match which was rained off after two balls, and played ODIs against Ireland and four of the five ODIs against Australia later in the season before touring Australia over the 2013‚Äì14 northern winter and then being selected for the limited overs tour of the West Indies, in preparation for the T20 World Cup. =T20 World Cup, 2014= After being selected again in England's squad for the T20 World Cup, Tredwell played in all four of England's group matches. The side failed to advance out of the group and was beaten by the Netherlands in their final match of the tournament. Further international opportunities followed throughout 2014, with matches against Scotland, Sri Lanka and India at home before being selected for the tour of Sri Lanka later in the year, playing in 15 ODIs and nine T20Is during the year. =World Cup and final matches, 2015= Despite being selected in the squad for a Tri-series tournament against India and Australia in early 2015, Tredwell did not play as Moeen Ali was chosen ahead of him as England's spin option. He was selected for the 2015 World Cup squad but only played in England's final game of the tournament against Afghanistan as the team again failed to advance out of the group stage. Tredwell took figures of 1/25 in what was his final ODI. Tredwell's final international match came in April 2015. An injury to Moeen meant that he was chosen in the Test squad to tour the West Indies and was selected for the first Test of the series. He took 4/47 in the first innings of the match and one wicket in West Indies' second innings in what was his second and final Test appearance.

Estimates suggest that it measured about 1.4 meters (4.6 ft) in length and weighed approximately 2.27-9.1 kg (5-20 lbs). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its weight at 3 kg and length at 1 m. It was found in the Bajo de la Carpa Formation and was named by paleontologist Jos√© Bonaparte in 1991 after the historian Don Gregorio Alvarez. The type species is A. calvoi. Description Restoration. Alvarezsaurus was a bipedal theropod. Like other lightweight theropods, it had a long tail, and its leg structure suggests that it was a fast runner. The most proximal elements of Alvarezsaurus caudal vertebrae exhibited ventrally sharp centra and the transerve processes of these vertebrae were sub-triangular and laterodistally directed, features seen in other alvarezsaurids like Shuvuuia. Spinal processes were entirely absent or poorly developed, and each caudal vertebra supported short prezygapophyses. The scapula was visibly curved and proportionally smaller than those of other alvarezsaurids, and unlike its relatives Alvarezsaurus did not have a fused astragalus and calcaneum. It was unique in that its metatarsal III was its longest, followed by an unusually long metatarsal IV. It may have been insectivorous. Classification Skeletal diagram of known remains. Alvarezsaurus is considered basal to better-known members of its family, such as Mononykus and Shuvuuia. It has been alternately classified with both non-avian theropod dinosaurs and early birds, but a move of the alvarezsaurids to be recognized as more closely related to neornithine birds proved controversial despite being supported by earlier studies. It was once believed that the Patagonian alvarezsaur taxa were the most basal of their family, but the discovery of a more basal member, Haplocheirus, disproved that when its fossils were discovered in China.

Typically, a food mill consists of three parts: a bowl, a bottom plate with holes like those in a colander, and a crank fitted with a bent metal blade that crushes the food and forces it through the holes in the plate. The bottom plate may be a permanent part of the device, or interchangeable plates with different hole sizes may be supplied. Three corrugated feet on the base, or two ears on the rim plus the handle, fit on the rim of a cooking pot and hold the mill in position over it. Food mills are usually made of stainless steel or aluminum. The bowl may be plastic, particularly for smaller sizes marketed for preparing baby food. Older \\"heirloom\\" utensils were usually made from tinplate. This piece of kitchen equipment, of long-proven efficiency, bridges the gap between a sieve (or tamis, china cap, or chinoise) and the electric blender or food processor. Its function is similar to that of a potato ricer or \\"hob\\" type of sp√§tzle maker. Uses of a food mill include removing the seeds from cooked tomatoes, removing pulp or larger pieces from foods (creating apple jelly or any type of pur√©e), and making mashed potatoes or sp√§tzle.

Founded by Childebert I in the 540s as the Abbaye Sainte-Croix-Saint-Vincent, by the middle of the 8th century it had taken on the name of Saint Germanus (French: Germain), the man appointed bishop of Paris by Childebert and later canonized. Originally located beyond the outskirts of early medieval Paris, it became a rich and important abbey complex and was the burial place of Germanus and of Childebert and other Merovingian kings of Neustria. At that time, the Left Bank was prone to flooding from the Seine, so much of the land could not be built upon and the Abbey stood in the middle of meadows, or pr√©s in French, thereby explaining its appellation, which also serves to distinguish it from the church of Saint- Germain l'Auxerrois near the Louvre. The oldest part of the current church is the prominent western tower (partly restored and modified), which was built by Abbot Morard around the year 1000. Andrew Ayers (2004), The Architecture of Paris, pp. 125‚Äì126. Stuttgart; London: Edition Axel Menges. .  History  Inside of Abbaye de Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s recently restored, 2012 Childebert, from the former refectory portal (Louvre) The Abbey was founded in the 6th century by the son of Clovis I, Childebert I (ruled 511-558). Under royal patronage the Abbey became one of the richest in France, as demonstrated by its ninth-century polyptych; it housed an important scriptorium in the eleventh century and remained a center of intellectual life in the French Catholic church until it was disbanded during the French Revolution. An explosion of saltpetre in storage levelled the Abbey and its cloisters, but the church was spared. the statues in the portal were removed (illustration) and some destroyed, and in a fire in 1794 the library vanished in smoke. The abbey church remains as the √âglise de Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, one of the oldest churches in Paris.\\"√âglise de Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s\\", Fodor's Travel In 542, while making war in Spain, Childebert raised his siege of Zaragoza when he heard that the inhabitants had placed themselves under the protection of the martyr Saint Vincent. In gratitude the bishop of Zaragoza presented him with the saint's stole. When Childebert returned to Paris, he caused a church to be erected to house the relic, dedicated to the Holy Cross and Saint Vincent, placed where he could see it across the fields from the royal palace on the √éle de la Cit√©. In 558, St. Vincent's church was completed and dedicated by Germain, Bishop of Paris on 23 December, the very day that Childebert died. Close by the church a monastery was erected. Its abbots had both spiritual and temporal jurisdiction over the suburbs of Saint-Germain (lasting till about the year 1670). The church was frequently plundered and set on fire by Vikings in the ninth century. It was rebuilt in 1014 and rededicated in 1163 by Pope Alexander III to Saint Germain of Paris, the canonized Bishop of Paris and Childeric's chief counsellor. The great wall of Paris subsequently built during the reign of Philip II of France did not encompass the abbey, leaving the residents to fend for themselves. This also had the effect of splitting the Abbey's holdings into two. A new refectory was built for the monastery by Peter of Montereau in around 1239 - he was later the architect of the Sainte-Chapelle. The abbey church's west end tower was pierced by a portal, completed in the twelfth century, which collapsed in 1604 and was replaced in 1606 by the present classicising portal, by Marcel Le Roy.Philippe Plagnieux, \\"Le portail du XIIe si√®cle de Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s √† Paris: √©tat de la question et nouvelles recherches\\" Gesta 28.1 (1989, pp. 21-29) p. 22 Its choir, with its apsidal east end, provides an early example of flying buttresses. It gave its name to the quarter of Saint-Germain-des- Pr√©s that developed around the abbey. This area is also part of the Latin Quarter, because the Abbey donated some of its lands along the Seine--the Pr√© aux Clercs (\\"fields of the scholars\\") for the erection of buildings to house the University of Paris, where Latin was the lingua franca among students who arrived from all over Europe and shared no other language. Until the late 17th century, the Abbey owned most of the land in the Left Bank west of the current Boulevard Saint-Michel and had administrative autonomy in it, most clearly for the part outside the walls of Paris. Louis-C√©sar de Bourbon, son of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, was an abbot here. In the 17th century the district of Saint-Germain was among the most desirable on the Left Bank. Marguerite de Valois pressured the abbot to donate abbey land to her, too. She built a palace on it, and set a fashionable tone for the area that lasted until the Saint-Honor√© district north of the Champs-√âlys√©es eclipsed it in the early eighteenth century. Her palace was located at the current numbers 2-10 rue de Seine. The gardens of the estate extended west to the current rue Bellechasse.Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 203, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, The tomb of philosopher Ren√© Descartes is located in one of the church's side chapels.

From 1275 to 1636, the pillory of the Abbey was located in the current Place d'Acadie, better known to Parisians as the Mabillon due to the eponymous M√©tro station located there. This square was therefore called the Place du Pilori and the current rue de Buci leading to it was called the rue du Pilori.Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s et son faubourg, p. 125, Dominique Leborgne, Editions Parigramme, Paris 2005, The pillory was removed upon the rebuilding of the Abbey's prison in 1635 (a prison had stood there since the Middle Ages). It was located in what is now the Boulevard Saint-Germain, just west of the current Passage de la Petite Boucherie. In 1675 it was requisitioned for a military prison.

Dettah: Yellowknives Dene First Nation Council The name, which is also the source for the later community of Yellowknife, derives from the colour of the tools made from copper deposits. History The historic Yellowknives lived north and northeast of the Great Slave Lake (Tinde'e - \\"Great Lake\\") around the Yellowknife River and Yellowknife Bay (Weledeh Cho - \\"Inconnu River\\") and northward along the Coppermine River, northeast to the Back River (Thlewechodyeth or Thlew-ee-choh-desseth - \\"Great Fish River\\") and east to the Thelon River (or Akilinik). They used the major rivers of their traditional land as routes for travel and trade as far east as Hudson Bay, where early European explorers such as Samuel Hearne encountered them in the 1770s. The Yellowknives helped lead Hearne through the Canadian Arctic tundra from Hudson Bay to the Arctic Ocean in search of the legendary copper deposits that the Yellowknives, or 'Copper Indians', had a hand in mining and trading for tools. Later European explorers who encountered and traded with Copper Indians marked on their maps the 'Yellowknife River,' which drains into Great Slave Lake from headwaters originating near the headwaters of the Coppermine River, a traditional travel corridor. In the early 1800s and 1900s, the Yellowknives were the largest and most powerful tribe in the geographic area. The Yellowknives and the T≈Çƒ±Ã®ch«´ (Dogrib), who also lived on the north shores of Great Slave Lake, were ancestral enemies. In the 1830s it was reported that the Dogrib almost wiped out the Yellowknives, the remnants of which - although opinions vary - either scattered south of Great Slave Lake or inter-married with the Dogrib. Following the discovery of gold in the Yellowknife area, a great mix of Dogrib, Chipewyan, and remnant Yellowknife members congregated and settled in the community or within the traditional villages of Dettah or Trout Rock. With government funding, the Dene village of Ndil«´ was developed in the mid 1950s on the tip of Latham Island (the southern point of Yellowknife's Old Town). The Yellowknives Dene First Nation was formed in 1991 (formerly known as Yellowknife B Band) following the collapse of a territorial-wide comprehensive land claim negotiation. They currently negotiate a land claim settlement for their lands as part of the Akaitcho Land Claim Process. Another organized Dene group has come forward claiming to be direct descendants of the historic 'Yellowknife Indian' tribes, and asserting independence from the mixed Dogrib-Chipewyan Yellowknives Dene First Nation. Considered a distinct people, they are still seeking government recognition today under Treaty 8. Chief Snuff of the Yellowknives signed Treaty 8 in 1899. Chief Snuff lived on the south shore and east arm of Great Slave Lake. The people who lived on the Taltson River were dubbed the Rocher River People in the 1920s. Chief Snuff had a cabin located about ten miles from Rocher River on a little piece of land beside the water, called Snuff Channel, connected to the Taltson River. The Yellowknives continued to reside in this area until the early 1960s, when they were forced to relocate after their schoolhouse was burned down in a fire. Shortly after, the Taltson River hydro dam was built. The last chief of the Rocher River Yellowknives was Chief Pierre Frise in the 1960s; he was strongly opposed to the building of the Taltson River dam. During this point the original Yellowknives were dispersed to Fort Resolution, Yellowknife, and other areas of Canada.

The band was formed in 1975, by a group of young people from Coimbra that was participating in one of the massive literacy campaigns carried out by the provisional governments that administered Portugal in the years after the Carnation Revolution of 1974. The group was working in the inland region of Beira Baixa and often played Chilean and Portuguese folk and political songs for the people. After discovering the cultural and musical traditions of the region the group formed the band and named it after V√≠ctor Jara, a Chilean socialist and folk singer, killed after the Chilean coup of 1973 carried out by General Augusto Pinochet. History From 1975 to 1977 the band played in several places and towns throughout Portugal. In 1977, the band recorded and released their first LP, named Eito Fora. In 1978 the band participated in the commemorations of the Carnation Revolution in the Soviet Union. In 1979 their second album was released, named Tamborileiro. In the next year they participated in the music festivals of Sokolov and Berlin, in Czechoslovakia and Germany, respectively. In that same year, they also participated in the commemorations of the Portuguese revolution carried out in the former colony of Angola, in the Festa de l'Unit√†, a communist press festival in Italy and also played for the Portuguese diaspora in the Netherlands.

Established in 1854, at the time of the Crimean War, Aldershot Garrison was the first permanent training camp for the British Army. This led to a rapid expansion of Aldershot's population from 875 in 1851, to in excess of 16,000 by 1861 (including about 9,000 from the military). After six years, he was posted to Bermuda and ministered with care and courage to those suffereing from an outbreak of Yellow Fever. When his term of service expired Monsignor Vertue volunteered to stay as he had become acclimatised to the local conditions and was less likely to fall ill than a new appointee. The War Office awarded him a special Vote of Thanks.Dwyer, Gerard. \\"\\"Diocese of Portsmouth Past and Present\\" In 1865, Vertue was assigned to Colchester, and from 1871 to 1878 to Portsmouth. From Portsmouth he next went to Malta. The Diocese of Portsmouth was formed in May 1882; the Church of St. John the Evangelist was named the cathedral. On 3 June 1882, Vertue was appointed the first Bishop of Portsmouth by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 25 July from Cardinal Henry Manning, Archbishop of Westminster, with Bishops Herbert Vaughan of Salford (later Archbishop of Westminster) and William Weathers, Auxiliary of Westminster, serving as co-consecrators. The cathedral was consecrated by Vertue, on 29 March 1887. He enlarged it and completed its interior decorations. He built an episcopal residence and a large hall adjoining, which, with the cathedral, form a group of buildings artistic in design, and architecturally, a most noteworthy structure, among the ecclesiastical buildings in the Borough of Portsmouth.

They are some of the earliest known members of the Therizinosauroidea, but they already possessed the body shape‚Äîincluding the long neck, short tail, and relatively large claws‚Äîof later therizinosauroids. Like other members of this group, it was a bipedal herbivore with a large gut to process plant material. Several specimens are known and they vary in size. History of discovery The fossil remains were first discovered in 1988 and described by the Canadian paleontologist Dale Russell and his Chinese colleague Dong Zhiming in 1993. However, although the paper is technically included in the last issue of the 1993 volume of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences, this issue was actually released in the early weeks of 1994. Skeletal composite of specimens Alxasaurus is named after the Alxa Desert of Inner Mongolia, also known as the \\"Alashan\\" desert, and the name also includes the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). Alxa (or Alashan) is also the name of the league, or administrative division, of the Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) region of the People's Republic of China. The single known species, elesitaiensis, is named after Elesitai, a village found in this region, near which the fossil remains of Alxasaurus were located. Five Alxasaurus specimens were recovered from the Bayin-Gobi Formation of Inner Mongolia, which dates to the Albian stage of the Early Cretaceous Period, or about 113 million to 100 million years ago. The holotype specimen, IVPP 88402 (large individual), which is considered to exemplify the genus and species, is the largest and most complete of the five, consisting of the right dentary (lower jaw) with some teeth, 5 cervical vertebrae, 28 caudal vertebrae, 5 sacral vertebrae, 9 ribs, 15 chevrons, an isolated scapula, both coracoids, both humeri, isolated radius, both ulnae, a virtually complete manus, both ilia, both ischia and both femora. The other four specimens are the paratypes IVPP 88301, IVPP 88402 (small individual), IVPP 88501 (immature individual) and IVPP 88510. Together the specimens represent most of the species hypodigm aside from the skull. Classification While exhibiting many typical therizinosaur features in overall body shape and in the teeth, the skeleton of Alxasaurus also shows several features present in more typical theropods, and the discovery of this animal provided significant evidence that therizinosaurs were aberrant theropods. Specifically, the semilunate carpal bone of the wrist is found only in maniraptoran theropods, which also include oviraptorosaurs, dromaeosaurs, troodontids, and birds. Even more basal therizinosaurs such as the feathered Beipiaosaurus and primitive Falcarius have since been discovered with more theropod features and have helped to solidify this arrangement. Alxasaurus is now thought to occupy a position between the early Beipiaosaurus and later therizinosaurids such as Erlikosaurus, Segnosaurus, or Therizinosaurus. Although Rusell and Dong coined the Alxasauridae to contain Alxasaurus, the subfamily has not been widely corroborated in most analyses. In 2010, Lindsay E. Zanno noted that, while technically still valid, the group currently consists of only a single species and is thus of dubious utility.

His native city of Nantes has a street named for him.\\"Rue Evariste Luminais\\", √âdouard Pied, Notices sur les rues, ruelles, cours, impasses, quais, ponts, boulevards, places et promenades de la ville de Nantes, Nantes: Dugas, 1906, p. 180 : online at fr.wikisource. Works Goths crossing a river Luminais worked in the genre and historical modes. He was among the academic painters who satisfied a social demand for aggrandising, even propagandistic historical works in the early years of the Third Republic, after the defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.Pierre Daix, Pour une histoire culturelle de l'art moderne Volume 1 De David √† C√©zanne, Paris: O. Jacob, 1991, , p. 286 . As such, he shared in their condemnation by the advocates of modern art. However, in some paintings, such as The Widow (1865) he foreshadows social realism. He also used a historical dressing to make hunting and peasant scenes more palatable to the Academy. =Gauls and other ancient peoples= Luminais played an important part in disseminating the iconography of the Gauls; their popular image, with long hair and winged helmets, was developed by historians at this time as part of an examination of French history. Sometimes called 'the painter of the Gauls',Annales du Soci√©t√© Acad√©mique de Nantes et du D√©partement de la Loire-Inf√©rieure (1900) 250 . he also depicted other scenes of early medieval history, often clashes between different peoples, such as campaign-hardened Romans in breastplates reinforced with metal battling daring Celts who are bare-chested, with only helmet and shield for protection.Christiane Elu√®re, L'Europe des Celtes, coll. ‚ÄúD√©couvertes Gallimard‚Äù: Histoire (vol. 158), Paris: Gallimard, 1992, , p. 79 . More unusually among historical artists of the time, he also depicted the Franks, whose contribution to French history was then generally underrated in favour of the Gauls.Bonnie Effros, Uncovering the Germanic Past: Merovingian Archaeology in France, 1830-1914, Oxford studies in the history of archaeology, Oxford: Oxford University, 2012, , p. 25. His painting of the Alemannic rout at the hands of the Franks in the Battle of Tolbiac impressed Th√©ophile Gautier at the 1848 Salon.\\"Th√©ophile Gautier, Salon de 1848\\" (archived from the original) . His Frankish Cavalry in Combat was inspired by reading Chateaubriand.Fran√ßoise Vallet, De Clovis √† Dagobert: Les M√©rovingiens, D√©couvertes Gallimard: Histoire 268, Paris: Gallimard, 1995, p. 29 . His paintings on Merovingian topics emphasise the barbaric cruelty of the rulers.Effros, Uncovering, p. 331. Pepin the Short's overthrow of Childeric III with the agreement of Pope Zachary and the deposed king's imprisonment in the Monastery of St. Bertin at Saint-Omer is the subject of his painting The Last of the Merovingians, for which he reportedly used one Jean Marie Dagobert as his model.Roger-Ren√© Dagobert, Le roi Dagobert: Histoire d'une famille et d'une chanson, 1988, p. 74 (MS Word) . At the 1883 Salon, the critic Charles Bigot hoped this would indeed be Luminais \\"last\\" Merovingian painting.Bonnie Effros, \\"Artistic, scholarly, and popular depictions of the 'premi√®re race' in late nineteenth-century France\\", in: Vergangenheit und Vergegenw√§rtigung: Fr√ºhes Mittelalter und europ√§ische Erinnerungskultur, ed. Helmut Reimitz and Bernhard Zeller, Denkschriften (√ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften. Philosophisch-Historische Klasse), Forschungen zur Geschichte des Mittelalters 14, Vienna: √ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, 2009, , pp. 71-91. Gaul Returning from the Hunt (1906) As was common among historical painters at the time, his paintings contain anachronisms and out of place details. For example, in the 1906 painting of a Gaul returning from the hunt, the clothing is anachronistic and the helmet more a characterisation of the mounted man as a Gaul than a hunting accessory. The long red hair is part of the 19th-century image of the Gaul.Ren√©e Grimaud, Nos Anc√™tres les Gaulois, M√©moires de l'histoire, Rennes: Ouest-France, 2001, , p. 70 . His In Sight of Rome shows the same liberty: the shield on the left and the helmets are not realistic.Grimaud, p. 19. The Celtic incursion into Italy made an early and lasting impression on artists.Elu√®re, p. 65. In depicting the Merovingian Franks, 19th-century painters unaware of archaeological evidence costumed queens in Oriental Germanic fashion,Patrick P√©rin and Gaston Duchet-Suchaux, Clovis et les M√©rovingiens, La France au fil de ses rois, Paris: Tallandier, 2002, , p. 140 . as in Luminais' Merovingian Princess. Luminais' approach focussed more on distancing the image from the present than on evoking a specific era. Merovingian Princess Having met Th√©odore Hersart de La Villemarqu√©, who had published a collection of popular Breton songs, Barzaz Breiz, around 1884 he based on one of the songs his Flight of King Gradlon, depicting the king fleeing on horseback from his city of Ys as it is swallowed by the sea; St. Winwaloe urges him to jettison his only child, Dahut. The art museums in Quimper, Rennes and Nantes hold several sketches for the work. Exhibited at the Salon of 1884, the painting was hailed as a \\"superb dramatic group, full of life\\".Th√©odore V√©ron, 10.e annuaire dictionnaire V√©ron, ou, Organe de l'Institut Universel des Sciences, des Lettres et des Arts du XIX.e si√®cle, section des Beaux-Arts: salon de 1884, Paris: Bazin, 1884, , p. 234 . =The Sons of Clovis II= In 1880 he painted what, according to Bonnie Effros, was his most famous Merovingian painting, The Sons of Clovis II, also called Les √ânerv√©s de Jumi√®ges (the enervated men of Jumi√®ges), based on a legend concerning the 7th-century Merovingian king Clovis II: after rebelling against their father, the two princes are said to have been punished according to their own mother's suggestion by the removal of their vital force (\\"enervation\\") through the destruction of the tendons of their muscles; they were then set adrift on a raft in the River Seine, at the mercy of God, but according to the legend they were rescued by the monks of the Abbey of Jumi√®gesThe Sons of Clovis, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, retrieved 17 July 2014. and later reconciled with their parents. The version exhibited at the 1880 Salon created a sensation and is judged to be his best work. The painting evokes varying and strong reactions; Simone de Beauvoir wrote in 1960 of \\"calm horror\\".Simone de Beauvoir, La Force de l'√¢ge, Paris: Gallimard, 1960, , p. 234: \\"la calme horreur qu‚Äôelle √©voque\\". The work went through a number of stages of refinement. The first study, Premi√®re pens√©e pour les √ânerv√©s de Jumi√®ges, shows the cutting of the tendons and depicts four figures; a second study depicts the raft floating down the river, but has three figures, prefiguring the men's salvation by the monks. The two finished paintings show only the two figures alone on the raft. The version shown at the Salon was sold to Australia under the title The Sons of Clovis II and after being exhibited in various locations including Wallis & Sons' gallery of French paintings in London (1881), the Munich International Exposition (1883), the National Gallery of South Australia and the National Gallery of Victoria (1896), is now in the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney. The second version, with greater emphasis on the grandeur of nature, was kept by Luminais; after his death it was acquired by the State and in 1912 was deposited in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts in Rouen.Monochrome image at French Ministry of Culture. =Brenne paintings= North America section of the fresco for the Paris Commercial Bourse. At his summer studio in Douadic, he painted works reflecting his love of nature and of hunting, such as: * The Hallali, memories of hunting in Brenne in 1863 * The Two Guardians * La Folle du Tertre (the madwoman of the mound), based on a local legend * Hunting Through the Ages, six-panel work for the dining room of his friend Louis Fombelle * Illustrations for Jules de Vorys' book on Dagobert I, Dagobert en Brenne =Monumental painting= Luminais was one of five artists who collaborated between 1886 and 1889 on a monumental fresco, more than in area, for the interior of the dome of the Paris Commercial Bourse, representing the history of intercontinental trade. It includes a scene representing America which features Indians, slaves, labourers, cowboys, and a steam train representing the modern world.

Soozie Tyrell (born May 4, 1957), formerly known as Soozie Kirschner, is an American violinist and vocalist, most known for her work with Bruce Springsteen in the E Street Band and formerly The Sessions Band. Biography Tyrell was born in Pisa, Italy, and as the daughter of a military serviceman travelled extensively. Eventually her family settled in Florida and she briefly took music theory classes at the University of South Florida. She then relocated to New York City where she became a street musician for many years. Together with Patti Scialfa and Lisa Lowell, she formed a street group known as Trickster. Tyrell began appearing on records with Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes' Love is a Sacrifice in 1980. She then led her own country and western band, Soozie & High in the Saddle. Beginning in mid-1980s Tyrell worked with David Johansen and his Buster Poindexter alter-ego for fifteen years, appearing on six albums and a number of tours as well as collaborating on the musical Poet's Caf√©. Tyrell, Scialfa and Lowell performed on David Johansen's stage named eponymous first Buster Poindexter album released in 1987 on RCA Records featuring the popular dance hall single, \\"Hot-Hot-Hot\\"; their friendship and mutual recording industry projects continue to the present. Tyrell first appeared with Bruce Springsteen in 1992 on his Lucky Town album, as a backing vocalist. She subsequently performed on every Springsteen album of new studio material since that time, primarily as a violinist and backing singer, including the albums The Ghost of Tom Joad and Devils & Dust, which were not E Street Band albums, making her the musician who has performed on more Springsteen albums in the last twenty years than most of the other members of the E Street Band, with the exception of Patti Scialfa and Springsteen himself. In 2002 her violin became a key part of the sound on Springsteen's album The Rising, and Tyrell joined the E Street Band for the subsequent 2002‚Äì2003 Rising Tour. She also played a prominent role in his non-E Street, big band folk-oriented 2006 album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions and the subsequent Sessions Band Tour. She contributed to Springsteen's albums Magic (2007), Working on a Dream (2009), and Wrecking Ball (2012), and was a key facet of Springsteen and the E Street Band's ensuing Magic, Working on a Dream, and Wrecking Ball Tours. On them she was onstage for every number, playing acoustic guitar in addition to violin, and singing some featured duet parts during the frequent absences of bandmate and Springsteen wife Patti Scialfa. On both the Magic and Working On a Dream Tour, her spot on stage rotated between a riser beside Bittan and in Scialfa's spot when she wasn't present. Since the Wrecking Ball Tour, she has stood in Clarence Clemons‚Äô former spot. In 2003, Tyrell's debut album White Lines was released on Treasure Records. In 2014 Tyrell was featured on the compilation Songs from a Stolen Spring. On the album she performed \\"Danger Zone\\" - a Percy Mayfield song made famous by Ray Charles.

Naloxone and naltrexone are commonly used opioid antagonist drugs which are competitive antagonists that bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors. This effectively blocks the receptor, preventing the body from responding to opioids and endorphins. Some opioid antagonists are not pure antagonists but do produce some weak opioid partial agonist effects, and can produce analgesic effects when administered in high doses to opioid- naive individuals. Examples of such compounds include nalorphine and levallorphan. However, the analgesic effects from these specific drugs are limited and tend to be accompanied by dysphoria, most likely due to additional agonist action at the Œ∫-opioid receptor. As they induce opioid withdrawal effects in people who are taking, or have recently used, opioid full agonists, these drugs are generally considered to be antagonists for practical purposes. The weak partial agonist effect can be useful for some purposes, and has previously been used for purposes such as long-term maintenance of former opioid addicts using nalorphine, however it can also have disadvantages such as worsening respiratory depression in patients who have overdosed on non- opioid sedatives such as alcohol or barbiturates. On the other hand, Naloxone has no partial agonist effects, and is in fact a partial inverse agonist at Œº-opioid receptors, and so is the preferred antidote drug for treating opioid overdose. Naltrexone is also a partial inverse agonist, and this property is exploited in treatment of opioid addiction, as a sustained course of low-dose naltrexone can reverse the altered homeostasis which results from long-term abuse of opioid agonist drugs. This is the only treatment available which can reverse the long-term after effects of opioid addiction known as post acute withdrawal syndrome, which otherwise tends to produce symptoms such as depression and anxiety that may lead to eventual relapse. A course of low-dose naltrexone is thus often used as the final step in the treatment of opioid addiction after the patient has been weaned off the substitute agonist such as methadone or buprenorphine, in order to restore homeostasis and minimize the risk of post acute withdrawal syndrome once the maintenance agonist has been withdrawn. List of opioid antagonists The following are all Œº-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists or inverse agonists. Many of them also bind to the Œ∫-opioid receptor (KOR) and/or Œ¥-opioid receptor (DOR), where they variously behave as antagonists and/or agonists. =Centrally active= These drugs are used mainly as antidotes to reverse opioid overdose and in the treatment of alcohol dependence and opioid dependence (by blocking the effects, namely euphoria, of opioids so as to discourage abuse). Marketed * Naloxone * Naltrexone * Nalmefene Diprenorphine is used in veterinary medicine only. Discontinued or rarely used * Nalorphine * Nalorphine dinicotinate * Levallorphan Under development * Samidorphan Never marketed * Nalodeine =Peripherally restricted= These drugs are used mainly in the treatment of opioid-induced constipation. Marketed * Alvimopan * Methylnaltrexone * Naloxegol Under development currently or previously * 6Œ≤-Naltrexol * Axelopran * Bevenopran * Methylsamidorphan * Naldemedine =Miscellaneous= Buprenorphine and dezocine are partial agonists of the MOR but antagonists of the KOR. Contrarily, eptazocine is an antagonist of the MOR but an agonist of the KOR; the same is also true for nalorphine and levallorphan. A variety of partial agonists or mixed agonists-antagonists of the MOR and KOR are also marketed, and include butorphanol, levorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, and phenazocine. All of the aforementioned drugs may be described as opioid modulators instead of as pure antagonists. With the sole exception of nalorphine, all of the preceding are used as analgesics (by virtue of the fact that both MOR and KOR agonism independently confer pain relief). However, these opioid analgesics have atypical properties in comparison to the prototypical pure MOR full agonist opioid analgesics, such as less or no risk of respiratory depression for MOR partial agonists and antagonists, reduced or no euphoria, abuse potential, and dependence liability with MOR partial agonists/antagonists, and use- and dose-limiting side effects such as dysphoria and hallucinations with KOR agonists. In addition, by virtue of its KOR antagonism, buprenorphine (as buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461) or buprenorphine/naltrexone to block its MOR agonism) is under investigation for the treatment of depression and cocaine dependence, as are other KOR antagonists such as CERC-501 (LY-2456302) and, previously, JDTic and PF-4455242 (both discontinued due to toxicity concerns). Selective antagonists All of the centrally active opioid antagonists used widely in medicine are non-selective, either blocking multiple opioid receptors, or blocking the MOR but activating the KOR. However, for scientific research, selective antagonists are needed which can block one of the opioid receptors but without affecting the others. This has led to the development of antagonists which are highly selective to one of the four receptors: * Cyprodime is a selective MOR antagonist * Naltrindole is a selective DOR antagonist * Norbinaltorphimine is a selective KOR antagonist * J-113,397 is a selective nociceptin receptor (NOP) antagonist Other selective antagonists are also known, but the four listed above were the first selective antagonists discovered for each respective opioid receptor, and are still the most widely used. In addition to selective antagonists, AT-076 is a non-selective, balanced antagonist of all four of the opioid receptors, and was the first such agent to be discovered. Depersonalization disorder Naloxone and naltrexone have both been studied in the treatment of depersonalization disorder. In a 2001 study with naloxone, three of fourteen patients lost their depersonalization symptoms entirely, and seven showed marked improvement. The findings of a 2005 naltrexone study were slightly less promising, with an average of a 30% reduction of symptoms, as measured by three validated dissociation scales. The more dramatic result of naloxone versus naltrexone is suspected to be due to different opioid receptor affinity/selectivity with naloxone (specifically, more potent KOR blockade), which appears to be better suited to individuals with depersonalization disorder. In popular culture * In the episode of House, \\"Skin Deep\\", opioid antagonist drugs were administered in order to completely remove the patient's heroin induced addiction/withdrawal symptoms (during an induced coma in order to relieve the extreme pain of their use), so that an accurate diagnosis of paraneoplastic syndrome caused by cancer was differentiated. * In an episode of Royal Pains, a character dangerously tries to undergo a procedure (and go under anaesthesia) in his own home. * In an episode of Hannibal, Dr.Lecter administers Naloxone to Jack Crawford's wife after she tries to commit suicide by overdosing on morphine.

Crump was born in Pittsford, New York, the eldest son of Samuel and Sarah (Cutting) Crump. His parents had settled in Pittsford in April 1842 after emigrating from England soon after marrying. His father was born and educated in Kent, while his mother was from Suffolk. His father had experience as a builder and continued his trade in the United States. Rouseau was educated in the public schools of Pittsford and Rochester. After finishing his education, he worked for a time with his father as a builder, and then learned the trade of wagon and carriage making. After finishing his apprenticeship, he took up another trade, that of ship- carpentering, helping to build one of the largest sailing vessels on the Great Lakes. After it was finished in the fall of 1864, he took an extended trip on her as a finishing ship-joiner, going the whole length of Lakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan, stopping at Detroit, Port Huron, Mackinaw, Chicago, and Milwaukee. In 1865, Crump engaged with Colonel Abel Streight, who had escaped from the Confederate Libby Prison with 107 other soldiers during the Civil War. Crump worked as a salesman at Streight's Indianapolis lumberyards for nearly a year, until poor health forced him to return to New York to recuperate. Crump resigned his position in 1868 and married Phebe A. Tucker of Craigsville, New York, and then went to Winona, Minnesota, to work with the Laird, Norton & Co., planing mill and lumberyard. In 1869, he undertook to start a lumber business in Plainwell, Michigan, building his first home there and achieving moderate success. Due to poor health, he again returned to Pittsford in December 1875. In 1876, he formed a partnership with D. B. Eder, with whom he operated a planing mill and lumberyard until 1879. In 1877, he was one of a company that built and operated a powder mill near Syracuse, which blew up that same year and took most of Crump's capital with it. Crump next formed a business partnership with his uncle, James Cutting, in Simcoe, Ontario, where they operated a general lumber, stave, sash, shingle, and door factory. In the summer of 1881, Crump and his wife made a tour of the Great Lakes, visiting Northern Michigan, including the Bay City area. Crump negotiated a lease with A. C. Haven in West Bay City (now part of Bay City) for a site to establish a new lumber operation. Crump and his uncle moved their entire business to the new location. In September 1881, construction began on a large mill which became operational in October. Cutting sold his interest to Crump in the fall of 1883, and in February 1884, Crump's Manufacturing Company was incorporated as a stock company under Michigan law, with Crump as the principal shareholder. His brother, S. G. Crump was president, R. O. Crump was secretary and manager, and his son, Shelley C. Crump was treasurer. The company dropped the retail lumber, sash, door, and blind business and became one of the largest box and package manufacturing plants in the country at that time, employing over 100 persons. Crump and his wife raised one son and four daughters. Shelley C. and Millie were born in Plainwell, Mabel A. in Pittsford, while Enid and Susie were born in West Bay City. In West Bay City, Crump served on the board of aldermen from 1889 to 1892. In the fall of 1890, he ran unsuccessfully for the Michigan House of Representatives. In 1892, he was elected mayor, serving from 1892 to 1895. In 1894, he was elected as a Republican from Michigan's 10th congressional district to the 54th United States Congress and to the three succeeding Congresses, serving from March 4, 1895 until his death in 1901. In the 56th congress, he was chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining. Crump died, while in office, in West Bay City just three weeks before his fifty-eighth birthday, and is interred in Elm Lawn Cemetery of Bay City, Michigan. Crump was a member of the Episcopal Church and was active in Masonic fraternities, including the Royal Arcanum, Foresters, Pythians, Knights Templar, Michigan Sovereign Consistory of Detroit and Moslem Temple, and the Ancient Order of United Workmen.

Amargasaurus was first described in 1991 and contains a single known species, Amargasaurus cazaui. It was a large animal, but small for a sauropod, reaching in length. Most distinctively, it sported two parallel rows of tall spines down its neck and back, taller than in any other known sauropod. In life, these spines most likely could have stuck out of the body as solitary structures that supported a keratinous sheath. An alternate hypothesis, now less favored, postulates that they could have formed a scaffold supporting a skin sail. They might have been used for display, combat, or defense. Amargasaurus was discovered in sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which dates back to the Barremian and late Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous. A herbivore, it shared its environment with at least three other sauropod genera, which might have exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Amargasaurus probably fed at mid-height, as shown by the orientation of its inner ear and the articulation of its neck vertebrae, which suggest a habitual position of the snout above the ground and a maximum height of . Within the Sauropoda, Amargasaurus is classified as a member of the family Dicraeosauridae, which differs from other sauropods in showing shorter necks and smaller body sizes. Description Life restoration of Amargasaurus Amargasaurus was small for a sauropod, measuring in length and weighing approximately . It followed the typical sauropod body plan, with a long tail and neck, a small head, and a barrel-shaped trunk supported by four column- like legs. The neck of Amargasaurus was shorter than in most other sauropods, a common trait within the Dicraeosauridae. Measuring in length, the neck corresponded to 136% of the length of the dorsal vertebral column. This is comparable to Dicraeosaurus (123%) but greater than in the extremely short- necked form Brachytrachelopan (75%). The neck consisted of thirteen cervical vertebrae, which were opisthocoelous (convex at the front and hollow at the back), forming ball-and-socket joints with neighboring vertebrae. The trunk was made out of nine dorsal and probably five fused sacral vertebrae. The foremost dorsals were opisthocoelous, while the remaining dorsals were amphyplatyan (flat on both ends). Robust transverse processes (lateral projections connecting to the ribs) indicate a strongly developed rib cage. The dorsal vertebrae of Amargasaurus and other dicraeosaurids lacked pleurocoels, the deep lateral excavations that were characteristic for other sauropods. Neck vertebrae of the holotype, with cross-section reconstruction of soft-tissue The most striking features of the skeleton were the extremely tall, upwardly projecting neural spines on the neck and anterior dorsal vertebrae. From the third cervical onward, these neural spines were bifurcated along their entire length, forming a double row. They were circular in cross section and tapered towards their tips. The tallest spines could be found on the middle part of the neck, where they reached on the 8th cervical. On the neck, they were bowed backward, projecting above the adjacent vertebra. A similar elongated neural spine has been described from the neck region of the closely related Bajadasaurus in 2019. Unlike in Amargasaurus, this spine was bowed frontward and broadened toward the tips. The last two dorsal vertebrae, the hip, and the foremost tail in Amargasaurus also had elongated spines; these were not bifurcated but flared into a paddle-shaped upper end. The pelvic region was relatively wide, judging from the long, laterally projecting transverse processes of the sacral vertebrae. The forelimbs were somewhat shorter than the hind limbs, as in related sauropods. Most of the hand and foot bones were not preserved, but Amargasaurus probably possessed five digits each as in all sauropods. Only the rear part of the skull is preserved. It likely showed a horselike, broad snout equipped with pencil-like teeth, as seen in related sauropods for which more complete skulls are known. As in other dicraeosaurids, the (nostril opening) was situated in the posterior half of the skull, diagonally above the (eye opening), which was proportionally large. As in most other dinosaurs, the skull featured three additional openings (fenestrae). The , located below the orbit, was long and narrow. Behind the orbit was the , which in dicraeosaurids was uniquely small and can be seen when the skull is viewed from the side. This contrasts with other diapsid reptiles, where these openings were directed upward, thus being visible only in top view. The antorbital fenestra would have been located in front of the eye opening, although this region is not preserved. An unusual feature were small openings seen on the backside of the skull, the so-called parietal openings or fontanelles. In other tetrapods, these openings are usually seen only in juveniles and would close as the individual grows. Skull features shared with Dicraeosaurus but absent in most other sauropods included the fused and the notably long , bony extensions connecting the with the . Discovery Casts of Amargasaurus and Carnotaurus, both discovered by the same 1984 expedition in Argentina, Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa The only known skeleton (specimen number MACN-N 15) was discovered in February 1984 by Guillermo Rougier during an expedition led by Argentine paleontologist Jos√© Bonaparte. This was the eighth expedition of the project \\"Jurassic and Cretaceous Terrestrial Vertebrates of South America\\", which was supported by the National Geographic Society and initiated in 1975 to improve on the sparse knowledge of the Jurassic and Cretaceous tetrapod life of South America. The same excursion uncovered the nearly complete skeleton of the horned theropod Carnotaurus. The discovery site is located in the La Amarga arroyo in the Pic√∫n Leuf√∫ Department of Neuqu√©n Province in northern Patagonia, south of Zapala. The skeleton stems from sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which dates to the Barremian through early Aptian stages of the Early Cretaceous, or around 130 to 120 million years ago. Skull reconstruction, redrawn after, showing known material (brown) and the location of the various skull openings. Missing parts are reconstructed after Dicraeosaurus. The skeleton is reasonably complete and includes a partial skull. Sauropod skull bones are rarely found, and the Amargasaurus skull is only the second skull known from a member of the Dicraeosauridae. Major parts of the skeleton were found in their original anatomical position: the vertebral column of the neck and back, which consisted of 22 articulated vertebrae, was found connected to both the skull and the sacrum. Of the skull, only the temporal region and the braincase are preserved. The sacrum, despite being partly eroded prior to burial, is fairly complete. Most of the tail is missing, with three anterior, three middle, and one posterior vertebrae being preserved, along with fragments of several others. The shoulder girdle is known from the scapula (shoulder blade) and coracoid (which sits on the lower end of the scapula), while the pelvis is merely known from the ilium (the uppermost of the three pelvic bones). The limbs are equally fragmentary, with the manus (hand) and most of the pes (foot) missing. The skeleton is currently stored in the collection of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires. The first, unofficial, mention of Amargasaurus as a new genus of dinosaur was published by Bonaparte in the 1984 Italian book Sulle Orme dei Dinosauri. Here, the species was designated as Amargasaurus groeberi, honoring Pablo Groeber, which was changed into Amargasaurus cazaui in the official description published several years later. The official description, written in Spanish, was published in 1991 by Leonardo Salgado and Bonaparte in the Argentinian scientific journal Ameghiniana. The name Amargasaurus alludes to the site of discovery, the La Amarga Arroyo. La Amarga is also the name of a nearby town, as well as the geologic formation the remains were recovered from. The word amarga is Spanish for \\"bitter\\", while sauros is Greek for \\"lizard\\". The one species (A. cazaui) is named in honor of Luis Cazau, a geologist with the YPF oil company, which at the time was state-owned. In 1983, Cazau informed Bonaparte's team about the paleontological significance of the La Amarga Formation, leading to the discovery of the skeleton. One year later, Salgado and Jorge O. Calvo published a second paper focusing on the description of the skull. Classification Amargasaurus is classified as a member of the Dicraeosauridae, a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea. Currently, this clade consists of nine species belonging to eight genera. These include Lingwulong shenqi from the Early or Middle Jurassic of China and four species from the Late Jurassic: Brachytrachelopan mesai from Argentina; Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the United States; and Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Tendaguru beds of Tanzania. Amargasaurus was the first dicraeosaurid known from the Cretaceous, although additional dicraeosaurids from the Lower Cretaceous have been described more recently, including Pilmatueia faundezi, Amargatitanis macni, and Bajadasaurus pronuspinax, which are all from Argentina. An unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted at least until the end of the Early Cretaceous. Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus. Suuwassea is generally recovered as the most basal member of the family. A 2015 analysis by Tschopp and colleagues came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation, Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae, might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae. Together with the Diplodocidae and the Rebbachisauridae, the Dicraeosauridae is nested inside the Diplodocoidea. All members of the Diplodocoidea are characterized by their box-shaped snout and narrow teeth restricted to the foremost portion of the jaws. Both the Dicraeosauridae and the Diplodocidae are characterized by bifurcated neural spines of the cervical and dorsal vertebra. In the Dicraeosauridae, the bifurcated neural spines were strongly elongated, a trend reaching its extreme in Amargasaurus. Size comparison between a human, Dicraeosaurus, Amargasaurus, and Brachytrachelopan The following cladogram by Gallina and colleagues (2019) shows the presumed relationships between members of the Dicraeosauridae: Paleobiology =Vertebral spines= Skeleton cast showing the neck spikes pointing forwards during downwards bending, Museum of Paleontology Egidio Feruglio Both the function and the appearance in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte, in 1991, suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. They also could have served for display, perhaps for courtship or to intimidate rivals. Some subsequently published life restorations showed the double row of spines supporting two parallel skin sails. Gregory Paul, in 1994, considered this possibility unlikely, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened as is the case in sail-bearing animals. Instead, he found that this shape indicates that the spines supported a keratinous sheath that would have extended the length of the spines in life. The spines could have been used for display or as weapons both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. Keratinous sheaths covering the spines were also shown in a 1999 skeletal restoration published by Salgado. Jack Bailey, in 1997, argued that the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to this author, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, which might have been used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the existence of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Neural spines from the penultimate dorsal vertebra to the foremost tail vertebrae also were strongly elongated, but different in structure, forming a single row of paddle-shaped projections. According to Bailey, these projections resembled those of modern humped ungulates such as the bison, indicating the presence of a fleshy hump above the hips. Bailey suggested similar humps for other dinosaurs with strongly elongated neural spines, such as Spinosaurus and Ouranosaurus. Artist's impression showing the speculative \\"skin sail\\", which was proposed in 1997 but now is considered unlikely by many scientists Daniela Schwarz and colleagues, in 2007, concluded that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, which would have been connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one- third of the spines. A cover of either keratin or skin is indicated striations on the surface of the spines similar to those of bony horn cores of today's bovids. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards- directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's giant sable antelope and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling. Pablo Gallina and colleagues (2019) described the closely related Bajadasaurus, which had neural spines similar to those of Amargasaurus, and suggested that both genera employed them for defense. A defense function would have been especially effective in Bajadasaurus as the spines were directed forwards and would have reached past the tip of the snout, deterring predators. The keratinous sheath that likely covered the spines might have extended their length by 50%, as seen in some modern even-toed ungulates. Such extended sheaths would have made the delicate spines more resistant to damage‚Äîlikely a critical threat, as the bases of the spines form the roof of the spinal chord. =Senses and posture= Reconstructed skull Paulina Carabajal and colleagues, in 2014, CT-scanned the skull, allowing for the generation of three-dimensional models of both the cranial endocast (the cast of the brain cavity) and the inner ear. Using these models, the cranial endocast was shown to encompass in volume. The inner ear was tall and wide. The lagena, the part containing the hair cells for hearing, was rather short, indicating that the sense of hearing would have been poorer in Amargasaurus than in other sauropods for which inner ears have been studied. The first skeletal reconstructions show the skull in a near-horizontal posture. Salgado, in 1999, argued that such a posture would have been anatomically impossible due to the elongated neural spines of the neck vertebrae. Instead, he envisaged the head in a nearly vertical orientation. The habitual orientation of the head is usually reflected by the orientation of the semicircular canals of the inner ear, which housed the sense of balance (vestibular system). Using their three-dimensional model of the inner ear, Carabajal and colleagues suggested that the snout faced downwards at an angle of roughly 65¬∞ relative to the horizontal. A similar value has recently been proposed for the related Diplodocus. The neutral posture of the neck can be approximated based on how the cervical vertebrae attached to each other. According to Carabajal and colleagues, the neck was gently sloping downwards, so that the snout would have rested above the ground in neutral posture. In reality, neck posture would have varied according to the respective activities of the animals. Raising of the neck, e.g. for reaching an alert position, would have been constricted by the elongated neural spines, not permitting heights greater than . =Locomotion= Hind view of skeleton, showing the pelvis and tall sacral spines Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and probably was unable to rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte, in 1991, suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fari√±a in 1999, who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which is adapted to galloping. Paleoecology Amargasaurus stems from sedimentary rocks of the La Amarga Formation, which is part of the Neuqu√©n Basin and dates to the Barremian and late Aptian of the Early Cretaceous. Most vertebrate fossils, including Amargasaurus, have been found in the lowermost (oldest) part of the formation, the Puesto Antigual Member. This member is approximately in thickness and mainly composed of sandstones deposited by braided rivers. The Amargasaurus skeleton itself was recovered from a layer composed of sandy conglomerates. The sauropod fauna of the La Amarga Formation was diverse and included the basal rebbachisaurid Zapalasaurus, the dicraeosaurid Amargatitanis, and unnamed remains of basal titanosauriforms. The high diversity suggests that different sauropod species exploited different food sources in order to reduce competition. Basal Titanosauriforms showed proportionally longer necks, longer forelimbs, and broader tooth crowns than Dicraeosaurids and Rebbachisaurids, suggesting greater feeding heights. Amargasaurus probably fed above ground level at heights of up to , as evidenced by the anatomy of its neck and inner ear. Rebbachisaurids like Zapalasaurus presumably fed at ground-level, while basal Titanosauriforms exploited food sources at higher levels. Other dinosaurs of the La Amarga Formation include the stegosaur Amargastegos; predatory dinosaurs include the small ceratosaur Ligabueino, and the presence of a large tetanuran is indicated by teeth. Other than dinosaurs, the formation is notable for the cladotherian mammal Vincelestes, the only mammal known from the Early Cretaceous of South America. Crocodylomorphs are represented by the trematochampsid Amargasuchus ‚Äì the holotype of this genus was found in association with the Amargasaurus bones.

He is recognized today as one of the founders of the modern Olympic Games, who sponsored the Olympic Games of 1859, 1870, 1875, and 1888 and preceded the Olympic Games that came under the auspices of the International Olympic Committee.: \\"Zappas the real founder of the modern Games was aging and ailing, ready to pass the torch to a successor.\\" These Games, known at the time simply as Olympics, came before the founding of the International Olympic Committee. The legacy of Evangelis Zappas, as well as the legacy of his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, was also used to fund the Olympic Games of 1896. During his youth, Zappas joined the Greek War of Independence (1821‚Äì1832), achieving the rank of Major and fighting in several significant battles. Following Greek independence, he moved to Wallachia where he had a successful career as a businessman, becoming one of the richest men of that time in Eastern Europe. Aside from being the only major sponsor of the Olympic revival at that time, Zappas's philanthropy also included contributions toward the foundation of several Greek institutions and schools as well as sports and exhibition facilities. Biography =Early life, military career, and later career in Wallachia= Evangelis Zappas was born to Vasilis Zappas and Sotire Mexis, of a Greek ancestry in 1800 in the village of Labovo, near Tepelen√´, (modern Gjirokast√´r County, Albania), when the region was still under Ottoman rule...: \\"Zappas born to a Greek family in 1800...\\" Zappas did not receive any education during his childhood.. He left his village at the age of 13 and enrolled as a mercenary in the Ottoman militia of the local ruler Ali Pasha... Zappas became a member of the Greek patriotic organization Filiki Eteria and joined his compatriots when the Greek War of Independence broke out in 1821. During this period, Zappas reached the rank of Major in the revolutionary army and became a personal friend of the Souliot captain, Markos Botsaris. After Botsaris's death in 1823, Zappas served under various military commanders of the independence struggle, such as Dimitrios Panourgias, Kitsos Tzavelas, and Michail Spyromilios. He participated in several major conflicts, such as the siege of Souli, the first siege of Missolonghi and the Battle of Peta. In his later correspondence with a Greek official, he claimed that he was wounded five times during the war.. In 1831, Zappas emigrated to Wallachia and made a fortune in land and agriculture. In the 1850s, Zappas was considered one of the wealthiest entrepreneurs in Eastern Europe.. At the time of his death in 1865, his total wealth was estimated at six million gold drachmas. =Revival of the Olympic Games= The idea of reviving the ancient Olympic Games had been raised from time to time during the early and mid 19th century, inspired to a certain degree by romanticism and patriotism.. In 1833, the romantic poet Panagiotis Soutsos, in his work Dialogue of the Dead, proposed the revival of the Games in the newly formed Greek state, as part of the revival of ancient Greek tradition.; . In 1852, archaeologist Ernst Curtius stated during a lecture that the Olympic events would be revived. Panathenaic Stadium (1906). Zappas was notably inspired by Panagiotis Soutsos and resolved to revive this ancient tradition through his own efforts and resources.. In early 1856, he sent a letter through diplomatic channels to King Otto of Greece, offering to fund the revival of the Olympic Games, and to provide cash prizes to the victors. However, this initiative was not without opposition. There was wide belief among some Greek politicians that athletic games were a throwback to ancient times, unsuited to the modern era. Alexandros Rizos Rangavis, the Greek foreign minister and head of the conservative anti-athletics lobby in Athens, suggested an industrial and agricultural exposition instead of an athletics event.. For months there was no official answer from the Greek state. In July 1856, an article in the Greek press by Panagiotis Soutsos made Zappas's proposal widely known to the public and triggered a series of events. King Otto agreed to the organization of athletics competitions at four-year intervals, with Zappa's full sponsorship, to coincide with industrial and agricultural expositions. As a result, Zappas provided the Greek government with the necessary financial resources to establish an Olympic Trust Fund.. On 15 November 1859 the first Olympic Games was held, in a city square in central Athens. These athletic contests were the first Olympic Games of modern times with the provenance of ancient Greek roots and the intention of using an, as yet unready, ancient Greek stadium. That stadium, the Panathenaic Stadium, was first used for a modern Olympic Games in 1870 and for the first time since the ancient Panathenaic and Olympic Games. The athletes competed in a variety of disciplines, similar to that of the ancient Olympic Games: running, discus, javelin throwing, wrestling, jumping, and pole climbing. Zappas left a fortune for the funding of future Olympiads to be held at the Panathenian stadium. He died in 1865. His immense fortune was used for the construction of permanent sporting facilities in Athens, as well as for the continuation of the Olympiad.. He also instructed on the building of the Zappeion exhibition and conference center, which is named in his honour and that of his cousin Konstantinos Zappas. Legacy =Re-establishment of the Olympic Games in modern times= Zappeion exhibition center. After Zappas's death, and wholly due to the Greek government ignoring Zappas's instructions to refurbish the stadium in marble, it was necessary to refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for the Athens 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept... In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad.. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him.. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888. Statue of Zappas in front of the Zappeion (made by Ioannis Kossos). Dr. William Penny Brookes, from the United Kingdom, further developed his Olympian Class sports events held in Much Wenlock in the 1850s, by adopting some events from the 1859 Athens Olympic Games into the programme of future Wenlock Olympian Games. Baron Pierre de Coubertin from Paris, France, was, in part, inspired by Dr. Brookes, and went on to found the International Olympic Committee in 1894.. Professor David C. Young, of the University of Florida (Gainesville), noted: > \\"Had it not been for Zappas, the Athens Games of 1896 surely would not have > taken place. Zappas's actions, his will and the previous tradition of Zappas > Olympic Games had made [Crown Prince] Constantine [of Greece] an advocate of > Olympic Games before the formation of the IOC in 1894.\\". =Philanthropy= Apart from his efforts to revive the Olympics, Evangelos Zappas made several philanthropic donations towards the foundation of schools, libraries and other similar institutions all over the Ottoman-occupied world, and notably their birthplace, Epirus. Greek schools were founded and expanded in several Greek-populated villages and towns, such as Labovo, Lekli, Nivani, Dhroviani, Filiates, Delvina, Permet. In Constantinople, education facilities were also founded that included nurseries, primary and secondary schools, which were collectively known as the Zappeion Institute.. Moreover, a large amount of money was deposited in the National Bank of Greece to provide scholarships for Greek agricultural students in order to conduct postgraduate studies in Western Europe.. During the anti-Greek Istanbul Pogrom in 1955, the facilities of the Zappeion female college in the Turkish capital were vandalized by the fanatical mob and a statue of him was broken into pieces. =Personality and resting place= Crypt of Evangelos Zappas at the Zappeion. Evangelis Zappas was often described as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, he was a man of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined beneath his memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.

During Tomey's time as assistant, UCLA won the 1976 Rose Bowl following the 1975 season. =Hawaii (head coach)= From 1977 to 1986, Tomey led his teams at Hawaii to their first in season top-20 Associated Press ranking in 1981, and their first AP first-team All-American player, Al Noga. In 1981, he also earned Western Athletic Conference \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors. He left as the winningest coach in Hawaii history, but was passed by June Jones during the 2006 season. =Arizona= In 1987, Tomey became head coach at Arizona, earning Pac-10 \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors in 1992. During his tenure, he coached five future NFL first-round draft choices, 20 All-Americans, and 43 Pac-10 first team players. His best teams were in the mid-1990s, highlighted by a tenacious \\"Desert Swarm\\" defense. He led Arizona to two of three ten-win seasons in school history, highlighted by a 12‚Äì1 campaign in 1998, in which they finished fourth in both major polls, the highest ranking in school history. The Wildcats were drubbed in the 1999 season opener against Penn State and won just six games that year; Tomey resigned after the 2000 season. The school president and athletic director represented Tomey's \\"nominal resignation was in lieu of termination by the university,\\" but clarified in 2019 after Tomey's death that the threatened termination was a ruse to pass $600,000 to Tomey as a show of gratitude, as he would not be contractually entitled to it if he resigned. His 95 wins are the most in Wildcats history. =San Francisco 49ers and Texas= In 2003, he was an assistant defensive coach for the San Francisco 49ers specializing in the nickel defense. In 2004, he helped lead the Texas Longhorns to an 11‚Äì1 season and victory in their first-ever Rose Bowl as assistant head coach and defensive ends coach. =San Jose State= In 2005, he became head coach at San Jose State University. Despite a 3‚Äì8 record in his inaugural season, the Spartans posted a 3‚Äì2 record at home, their first winning record since the 2000 season, although one of these wins came against a Division I-AA team. Also, the Spartans were the Division I-A leader in improved attendance. They were one of 11 teams to allow 100 fewer points from the previous year. Three of their losses were by only one touchdown and one of those came against the 2005 WAC co-champion, Nevada. Finally, the Spartans closed out their season with back-to-back wins for the first time since 1997. This two-game winning streak ended during the 2006 season opener, when they lost to Washington. In 2006, the Spartans finished their regular season 8‚Äì4, and participated in the inaugural New Mexico Bowl against New Mexico.

In 2008, Arashiro left Avex Trax and transferred to Universal Music Japan where she started to perform as simply Beni (stylized as BENI). She was initially best known for her 2004 single \\"Here Alone,\\" though later singles after her move to Universal (such as \\"M≈ç Ichi do...\\" with Dohzi-T, \\"M≈ç Nido to...\\" and \\"Kiss Kiss Kiss\\") have surpassed this initial hit. Life and career =Start of her career= Born in Okinawa, she moved to San Diego, California and then Yokohama. Her mother is Japanese and her father is American of European descent. She was influenced by Namie Amuro, Alicia Keys and her father's favorite singer Janet Jackson. She graduated from Nile C. Kinnick High School in Yokosuka Naval Base, Japan. She majored in Sociology at Sophia University. From a young age she wanted to become a singer and because of her musical parents she took up piano. Because her parents were living overseas she was traveling between Japan and America a lot which exposed her to both Japanese as well as overseas music. When she was in Japan she participated in the Kokuminteki Bish≈çjo Contest the largest talent contest. She made it all the way to the finals. This was quite special since she had no formal training. When her demotape was seen by Avex Trax they were so impressed by her clear voice, natural beauty, and English pronunciation that they decided to sign her to the label and prepare her for a debut. She became a member of Bish≈çjo Club 31. Beni was the first from the group to pursue a solo career while being active as a member of the group. Her first solo single named \\"Harmony\\" was released on June 9, 2004. The song \\"Harmony\\" was a theme song for the Japanese drama Reikan Bus Guide Jikenbo. =2004‚Äì2005: Rising popularity and first album= Her second single named \\"Infinite...\\" showcased a different side of Beni. The song had a more R&B; tune and Beni showed dance skills in the music video. The song \\"Infinite...\\" was also an intro song for the music TV program Count Down TV in October 2004. Her third single, released November 25, was \\"Here Alone\\" from which the leading song was the ending song for the popular Japanese drama Kurokawa no Techo. Although the single wasn't a hit, the song itself was a hit. A few months after \\"Here Alone\\", an album named Beni and single named \\"Miracle\\" were released on February 9, 2005. Although the single charted low, the album was well received because of the variations in music styles and vocal range. After her album release, she won at the 19th Japan Gold Disc Awards the title \\"New Artist of the Year\\". =2005‚Äì2006: Decline in sales and Girl 2 Lady= Because of her popularity, she got a contract with KOSE to promote KOSE's new VISE line of makeup. In the first official CM her new single song was promoted named \\"Hikari no Kazu dake Glamorous\\". The single also included a cover of Christina Milian's \\"Call Me, Beep Me!\\" which is the theme song for Disney's popular animated series, Kim Possible. The music video was not only promoted in the US, but also in 68 counties worldwide. However the single charted at the No. 40 place on the Oricon chart. She also became the face of Glico confectionery. Nearly 6 months later, her 6th single \\"Cherish\\" was released. The leading song \\"Cherish\\" served as theme song for NTV's Ongaku Senshi MUSIC FIGHTER and POWER PLAY. The B-side song named \\"Goal\\" was used as the third ending theme song for Eyeshield 21. Two months later, on February 22, 2006 (a year after debut album Beni), her second album named Girl 2 Lady was released. The album was promoted by the 2nd KOSE VISEE CM song \\"FLASH\\" which was a digital release. The album however reached the No. 87 spot on the Oricon. Shortly after the release, she started playing in an Andrew Lloyd Webber play named The Beautiful Game in Japan. In the musical, she was the female heroine. =2006‚Äì2008: Gem, first live tour and compilation album= Because of her participation in the musical, it took a long time for Beni to release new material. When the musical stopped touring in 2006, she began modeling as the face of Cecil McBee, one of the largest and most popular Japanese clothing lines that appeals to teenage and college girls. She was also the host of the NHK fashion program, Tokyo Kawaii TV, where Beni discusses the latest fashion trends in Japan. When she became the face of Orion Beer a new single was announced to be released on September 20. Her seventh single was named How Are U?. This single was her first single not to chart on the Oricon chart and is considered a total flop. Her eighth single named Luna was an ending theme song for the Japanese drama Warui Yatsura. This single charted at the No. 77 spot making it a small comeback from Beni. On April 25, 2007, Beni released her third studio album named Gem. The album charted at the No. 114 place on the Oricon chart. Shortly after the album's release, she went on her first one-man live tour. After the tour, it was announced that Beni would make a movie debut in a movie called Bra Bra Ban Ban to be released nationwide in theater in March. She would also sing the theme song for the movie that would be released as a single.

In some events, wild cards are chosen freely by the organizers. Other events have fixed rules. Some North American professional sports leagues compare the records of teams which did not qualify directly by winning a division or conference. International sports In international sports, the term is perhaps best known in reference to two sporting traditions: team wild cards distributed among countries at the Olympic Games and individual wild cards given to some tennis players at every professional tournament (both smaller events and the major ones such as Wimbledon). Tennis players may even ask for a wild card and get one if they want to enter a tournament on short notice. In Olympics, countries that fail to produce athletes who meet qualification standards are granted \\"wild cards\\", which allow them to enter competitors whose proven abilities are below the standard otherwise required. In some instances, wild cards are given to the host nation in order to boost its chances. In Olympic and World Championship competitions in track and field and swimming, however, nations are automatically allowed to enter two competitors, so these instances are technically not wild cards. In some other Olympic sports, such as judo, archery, and badminton, wild cards are in use, and they are granted by the respective sport federations. On rare occasions, a competitor who had gained entry by wild card succeeds in winning a medal or the championship. For example, Kye Sun-Hui won gold in judo at the 1996 Summer Olympics, Ding Junhui won the 2005 China Open snooker championship, Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá won the 2001 Wimbledon Championships, Kim Clijsters won the 2009 US Open, and Lin Dan won the 2013 BWF World Championships. North America In North American professional sports leagues, \\"wild card\\" refers to a team that qualifies for the championship playoffs without winning their specific conference or division outright. The number of wild card teams varies. In most cases, the rules of the league call for the wild card team to survive an extra round or to play the majority of their postseason games away from home. Although the exact rules among the leagues differ, they all generally agree that the wild card team (or teams, as in MLB, NFL, and NHL) are the ones with the best records among the teams that didn't win their division; these teams usually finish as the runner-up to their division winners. The term \\"wild card\\" does not apply to postseason formats where a set number of teams per division qualify. Former examples include: the American Football League's 1969 playoffs (qualifying the top two finishers from each division), the National Basketball Association's 1967-through-1970 playoffs (top four finishers from each division) and 1971‚Äì1972 playoffs (top two finishers in each division), and the National Hockey League's 1968‚Äì1974 and 1982‚Äì1993 playoffs (top four finishers from each division) are not true wild-card formats. When a wild-card playoff format is used, the number of teams in a division that qualify is not fixed; the divisional champion automatically qualifies, but non-division winners qualify, based either on league record or conference record. =Major League Baseball= :See also: Major League Baseball wild card, List of AL Wildcard winners, List of NL Wildcard winners, Major League Baseball division winners (and wild-card winners) and Major League Baseball wild-card game In Major League Baseball (MLB), wild-card playoff spots are given to the two teams in each league (four teams overall) with the best records among the non-division winners. The initial wild-card format was implemented after MLB expanded to 28 teams and realigned its two leagues to each have three divisions. Since a three-team playoff would require one team to receive a bye, the wild card was created to allow a fourth team. The wild card has been in effect since 1995, although it was supposed to be used in 1994; the postseason was canceled due to the players' strike. In 2012, a second wild card was added to each league. The two wild card teams in each league face each other in a one-game playoff, with the winner facing the number 1 seed in the Division Series. The advantages of the wild card format are that it allows a second- (or third-) place team a chance to win the World Series, even if there is a dominant division winner. As the wild cards are not awarded by division, the additional teams are part of league-wide races for the fourth and fifth spots. Critics of the wild card, such as broadcaster Bob Costas in his book Fair Ball: A Fan's Case for Baseball, have argued that, of the four major North American sports, baseball, having the most regular-season games (now 162), places the largest importance on the regular season, and the wild cards diminish the importance of the regular season by permitting a \\"second banana\\" team to make the playoffs, and that while it creates a league-wide race, it is for second place (and maybe third place) in a division, and takes away what would otherwise be a pennant race between first- and second-place teams, and can lead to teams playing for the wild card rather than to win the division. The second wild card was added in 2012 to address the issue of teams being content to rest players and win the wild card instead of trying to win the division. Also, because of the \\"sudden-death\\" round, these teams often use their best starting pitcher, leaving them unavailable for much of the Division Series. A wild-card team must surrender home-field advantage the first two rounds of the playoffs. For the World Series, however, home-field advantage is determined without reference to wild-card status. Prior to 2003, it was decided by alternating each year between the American and National Leagues. From 2003 to 2016, it was granted to the winner of the All-Star Game. Since 2017, it has been granted to the team with the better record. In the 2002 World Series, both the Anaheim Angels and the San Francisco Giants were wild-card teams, as were the Giants and the Kansas City Royals in the 2014 World Series.

The first round of the playoffs is called the \\"Wild Card Round\\". In this round, each conference's top (by regular-season record) division champion is exempted from play and granted automatic berth in the \\"Divisional Round\\". The four division champions are seeded from #1 through #4, while the three wild card teams are seeded #5 to #7; within these separations, seeding is by regular-season record. In the \\"Wild Card Round\\", the #7 team (a wild card team) plays against the #2 team (a division champion), #6 plays #3, and #5 plays #4. The division champions have automatic home-field advantage in these games. In the \\"Divisional Round\\", the worst seeded remaining team plays the #1 seeded team, while the next-lowest team that played in the wildcard round plays the next-highest seed. The two top seeds have home-field advantage in the divisional round. Background The NFL was the first league ever to use the wild-card format. The decision to implement a Wild Card coincided with the completion of the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. Prior to the merger, the right to compete in the postseason for the NFL title was restricted to division/conference champions. Until 1967, a tiebreaker game was played to resolve a deadlock for first place in either of the two conferences. When the league expanded to 16 teams, it realigned into four divisions and expanded the playoffs to two rounds. Tiebreaker games were eliminated in favor of the use of performance-based criteria to determine division champions. The rival American Football League, which reached a final size of ten teams in two divisions, also restricted its postseason to division winners until the 1969 season (the AFL's last as a separate league) when it expanded the playoffs to include division runners-up. The runners-up played the winners of the opposite divisions for the right to contest the AFL Championship Game. Following AFL upsets in the last two Super Bowls prior to the merger, the merged league realigned into two conferences of thirteen teams each, with three \\"old-line\\" NFL teams joining the AFL teams in the newly-formed American Football Conference. The decision to make the conferences equal in size meant they could not feasibly align into anything except three divisions of four and five teams each. This led to a debate as to how the postseason of the merged league should be structured. Both the NFL and AFL playoff formats of 1969 had attracted fierce critics. The NFL format was criticized for its ability to cause a team tied for first overall in the league to miss the playoffs (this happened once, in 1967, when the Baltimore Colts missed the postseason despite a .917 winning percentage after losing a tiebreaker to the Los Angeles Rams). The AFL's 1969 playoffs were criticized by NFL purists for breaking with longstanding tradition, also, due to the fact that they allowed runners-up to qualify no matter how much disparity existed between the divisions, the AFL playoff structure could allow a mediocre team to qualify - this did occur when the Houston Oilers, a .500 team, finished second in the Eastern Division - the Oilers were throttled in the playoffs 56-7 by the Western champion Oakland Raiders. The Raiders went on to lose the AFL title game to the Western runner- up (and eventual Super Bowl IV champion) Kansas City Chiefs. Despite Kansas City's win, some purists argued for the tradition of having only division champions contest the playoffs to continue. Had they prevailed, the post- merger NFL playoffs would have consisted of six teams and might have eventually evolved to closely resemble the playoffs of the modern Canadian Football League, with the regular season champion of each conference earning the right to host the championship game against the winner of a game between the champions of the other two divisions. However, the old-line NFL owners, who still expected their teams to dominate the merged league for at least the first half of the 1970s, thought a repeat of the 1967 Colts-Rams fiasco would be very likely under the new alignment combined with a six team format. Furthermore, the modern principle that home field advantage and byes should be awarded to the teams with the best records had still not yet been firmly established - tradition at the time dictated that home field advantage rotate between divisions and/or conferences regardless of record. In any event, most owners in both conferences wanted to keep the even four-team playoff field in each conference. This was established by having the three division champions in each conference joined by the best second-place finisher in the conference. History As with much of the NFL's nomenclature, the \\"wild card\\" was not initially referred to as such and was instead referred as the \\"Best Second-Place Team\\" (or sometimes simply as the \\"Fourth Qualifier\\"). The media, however, began referring to the qualifying teams as \\"wild cards\\". Eventually, the NFL officially adopted the term. During the 1975, 1976, and 1977 seasons, the divisional playoffs featured the #1 seed hosting the wild card team and the #2 seed hosting the #3 seed unless the #1 seed and wild card team were divisional rivals. In that case, the #1 seed hosted the #3 seed and the #2 seed hosted the wild card team. This was also the format used in Major League Baseball from 1995 through 2011. In 1978, the playoffs were expanded to 10 teams; however, the restriction against teams in the same division playing each other in the divisional round continued until the playoffs expanded to 12 teams in 1990. During this time, the #1 seed hosted the winner of the #4 vs #5 wild card game, while the #2 seed played the #3 seed. If the #1 seed and the winner of the #4 vs #5 wild card game were in the same division, then the #1 seed played the #3 seed, while the #2 seed played the #4 vs #5 winner. When Major League Baseball expanded its playoffs to 10 teams in 2012, it also used this format, although teams in the same division could play each other in the Division Series. From 1970 through 1974, the NFL used a rotation to determine which teams would host conference semifinal and final games, and which teams would play which other teams (coincidentally, baseball also used a rotation when it began to have this number of teams, for both of the aforementioned purposes, from 1995‚Äì1997 before switching to the seeding method). The number of wild-card qualifiers was expanded to two per conference in 1978 ‚Äî the divisional winners were granted a bye week while the wild card teams played (hence the origin of the phrase \\"Wild Card Round\\"). Like wild card teams before, the wild card game winner played the #1 seed, or the #2 seed if they and the #1 seed were divisional rivals. This change proved controversial since it meant one wild card team per conference hosted a playoff game (albeit in an earlier round) while one division winner per conference did not have the right to host a playoff game. Partly to address this oddity, the playoffs were expanded again to three wild cards per conference in 1990 (or 12 teams total) with the lowest ranked divisional winner losing its bye but gaining the right to host a playoff game. Following the addition of the Houston Texans in 2002, the league added a fourth division to each conference. The league decided not to change the number of playoff teams, and thus the number of wild card qualifiers was reduced to two per conference. Since 2002, the two lowest ranked divisional winners have not received byes and Wild Card teams have always played on the road. The term \\"Wild Card Round\\" continues to be used for the opening weekend of NFL playoffs, even though that weekend has involved both wild card and non-wild card teams since 1990. Come , the playoffs will return to three wild cards per conference, or 14 teams total. As of the start of the 2018 season, there has never been a meeting of two wild card teams in either conference's championship game or in the Super Bowl; the closest the latter came to happening was in 2010, when the Green Bay Packers and New York Jets went on cinderella runs after finishing as the second wild card team in each of their conferences (the NFC and AFC, respectively); the Packers won the NFC Championship Game and went on to win the Super Bowl, while the Jets' cinderella story ended with a one-score loss to the Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. By extension, this means that two wild card teams have not met in the playoffs (and, by further extension, that a wild card team has not hosted a playoff game) since the league expanded to 32 teams in 2002.

While not a wild card team, the 1969 Kansas City Chiefs were the first non-division winner to win the Super Bowl. They finished second in the Western Division of the American Football League, and in that season, the last before the merger, the AFL went from having its two division winners meeting for the league title to adding a second round in which the second place team in each division qualified for the post-season. These teams played cross- division in the semifinal round. Thus the Chiefs, who finished second in the West, defeated the East Division champion New York Jets in the AFL semifinals and then defeated the West Division champion Oakland Raiders to advance to Super Bowl IV, where they beat the Minnesota Vikings. Because the term \\"wild card\\" was not instituted until the following year, the Chiefs are not included in the above list, but are recognized as the first team to win the Super Bowl without winning a division title. = National Basketball Association= Although the National Basketball Association (NBA) includes wild-card teams in their playoff structures, the term \\"wild card\\" is seldom used; instead, each playoff team is most commonly denoted by its seeding position within the conference. In the NBA, division champions within each conference were given the #1-3 seeds based on their regular-season records. The two fourth-placed wild-card teams are awarded the #7 and #8 seeds, respectively, also based on their regular-season records. In the NBA playoffs, home court advantage is determined strictly by regular-season record, without regard to seeding. Before the 2006‚Äì07 NBA season, the NBA seeded its teams in the same manner as the NHL. Until 2015, the NBA seeds the three division winners and the wild- card team with the best record by regular-season record. This means that the wild-card with the best record got a seed as high as #2 (if that team is in the same division as the team with the best record in the conference); however, the next four wild-card teams will still be limited to the #5 through #8 seeds. This change was made to ensure that the two best teams in each conference could not meet until the conference final, and also (allegedly) to try and eliminate incentives for a playoff-bound team to deliberately lose games at the end of the regular season in order to \\"choose\\" a higher-seeded team that has won fewer games (and, due to the unique home-court rules of the NBA, possibly gain home-court advantage for that series). The notion of \\"wild cards\\" was essentially abolished the 2015‚Äì16 NBA season, as changes made prior to the season mean the top eight teams in each conference qualify regardless of divisional rank, with the seeded teams ranked by percentage. The only particular advantage to winning a division now is that a divisional title serves as the first tiebreaker for qualification seeding purposes. Unlike some other leagues, there is no tie-breaker advantage at all to finishing in any divisional rank lower than first - meaning (for example) that while a division winner will automatically win a tie-breaker over another division's runner-up, a division runner-up will not automatically win a tie-breaker over teams finishing third, fourth or fifth in other divisions. The new format means it is possible for an especially weak division to send no teams (not even its champion) to the NBA playoffs, although as of the start of the 2018‚Äì19 season this has not yet occurred. In the NBA, the winner of the #1 vs. #8 series goes on to face the winner of the #5 vs. #4 series, while the winner of the #2 vs. #7 series faces the winner of the #6 vs. #3 series. Notice that the winner of the #1 vs. #8 series will usually play against a wild-card team in the Conference Semifinals; this is arranged deliberately to \\"reward\\" the #1 seeded team by giving it the most winnable matchups in the first and second rounds. =National Hockey League= In the National Hockey League (NHL), the first, second, and third place teams in each division qualify for the playoffs automatically, and two additional teams, regardless of divisional alignment, also qualify by having the best records among the remaining teams in the conference. These teams are referred to as the Wild Cards. In the First Round, the division champions play the Wild Cards, while the second and third placed teams in each division play each other; therefore the bracket is fixed, like the NBA. Home ice advantage is given to the higher seed in the later rounds, with the better record being used in the Second Round, the Conference Finals and Stanley Cup Finals. The NHL's current format is similar in some respects to the \\"cross-over rule\\" used by the Canadian Football League since 1997 in that it the format emphasizes intra-divisional ranking and brackets in the playoff structure and yet allows two teams from one division to qualify for the playoffs at the expense of the two teams finishing with worse records and in the same divisional ranks in another division. The main difference is that the CFL only allows the lowest ranked playoff qualifying team from a division to cross over into the other division's playoffs, whereas in the NHL it is possible for either Wild Card team to \\"cross over\\" to the other division, or even (in cases where four teams qualify from each division) for the Wild Card teams to swap divisional playoff brackets. Also, unlike the CFL the NHL does not require the second Wild Card qualifier to have an outright better record than a superior-ranked team in the other division - in the event of such a tie at the end of the NHL season standard tie-breaking procedures are used to determine playoff qualification. From 1999 until 2013, division champions within each conference were given the #1-3 seeds based on their regular-season records. Among the remaining teams within each conference, five additional teams with the best records are awarded seeds #4 through #8. The division champions (first-third seeds) and the team with the best record that isn't a division champion (fourth seed) were given home ice advantage in the opening playoff series, in which they face the eighth-seeded through fifth-seeded teams, respectively. However, the playoff format differed slightly from that of the NBA. In the NHL, the highest winning seed of the first round played the lowest winning seed of the first round in the next round of the playoffs. For example, if the #1, #4, #6, and #7 seeds win their respective first round series then the second round of the playoffs matched the #1 seed (highest) versus the #7 seed (lowest) and the #4 seed (2nd highest) versus the #6 seed (second lowest). Home ice advantage in each NHL playoff series prior to the Stanley Cup Finals was granted by superior seed, even if the \\"wild card\\" team had a better regular season record. For the Finals, the team with the better record will receive home ice advantage. = Major League Soccer= Major League Soccer (MLS), the top level of soccer (football) in both countries, used a wild card format starting in its 2011 playoffs. The top three teams from each of its two conferences automatically qualified for the conference semifinals, while the four remaining teams with the highest point totals in league play, without regard to conference, earned \\"wild cards\\" into the playoffs. The wild card matches were single games, with the #7 seed hosting the #10 seed and the #8 seed hosting the #9 seed. The lowest surviving seed then played the Supporters' Shield winner (i.e., the team with the highest point total), while the other surviving wild card played the top seed in the other conference. The \\"wild card\\" format was revamped for the 2012 season. From 2015 to 2018, the top six teams from each conference qualified for the playoffs, with the #1 & #2 seeds in each conference automatically qualifying for the conference semifinals, and seeds #3-6 in each conference being wild cards. The lowest-seeded winner (played between the #4 & #5, and #3 & #6 seeds) in each conference played the #1 seed, and the next-lowest played the #2 seed in the conference semifinals. The wild card format was ultimately discontinued for the 2019 playoffs, as the top 7 teams from each conference now qualify for the playoffs; the top seed automatically qualifies for the conference semifinals, with the remaining six teams playing in the first round. =Canadian championship curling= Curling Canada introduced Wild Card teams starting with the 2018 Scotties Tournament of Hearts and 2018 Tim Hortons Brier. The change was made as part of a wider set of changes which expanded the tournaments to 17 teams and eliminated the unpopular Pre- Qualifying Tournaments. From 2018, the round robin stage of the Tournament of Hearts and Brier will consist of two seeded \\"pools\\" of eight teams as opposed to the old format consisting a single group of twelve teams. This allows the main tournament to include \\"Team Canada\\" (either the defending champions or, when the champions decline to or are unable to defend their title, the runners-up) and teams representing all fourteen constituent associations representing the ten provinces and three territories plus Northern Ontario. The remaining two participants in the tournament are the Wild Cards, which compete in an MLB-style play-in game prior to the main tournament to determine the sixteenth team in the main tournament. Just as is the case with MLB division titles, the format is designed to give teams an incentive to win their provincial championships. The Wild Cards are the top two teams in the Canadian Team Ranking System (CTRS) standings that did not win either the previous year's tournament or their respective provincial or territorial championship. The top ranked of these two teams receives the hammer (last rock) to start the game. The CTRS standings are also used to determine the seeding of all teams in the main tournament, with one important caveat - for the purposes of seeding the round robin pools and so as to allow the main round robin schedule to be drawn up prior to the Wild Card game, the ranking of the top Wild Card team is the ranking that is used for seeding purposes regardless of who wins the game. Whereas teams in the Tournament of Hearts and Brier are traditionally referred to by their respective province or territory (other than Northern Ontario and Team Canada), the team that wins the Wild Card game is referred to as the \\"Wild Card\\" for the duration of the tournament. As is the case with Team Canada, the Wild Card retains that designation even if the team that is representing the same province or territory as the Wild Card team is eliminated prior to the Wild Card team. With the introduction of pools, the round robin portion of the Tournament of Hearts and Brier now consists of two stages. The top four teams in each pool qualify for the second stage, formally known as the \\"Championship Pool.\\" Unlike most tournaments which use a similar format, teams carry over their entire round robin records from the preliminary stage as opposed to only those results against teams that also qualify. This ensures that each Championship Pool team still plays eleven games that count for the purposes of determining playoff qualification. The format is designed to ensure that a competitive team fills the Wild Card slot - due to the significant disparity in playing caliber between the top teams of Canada's fourteen member associations, it is widely expected that the Wild Card will consistently come from one of the provinces with the toughest fields in the playdowns, and that it will consistently be a championship contending team. =Canadian Football League= While the Canadian Football League does not officially use the term \\"wild card\\" to denote any playoff qualifier, its crossover rule acts similar to a wild card in many respects. Calls to change the CFL's playoff format came about soon after the CFL finished its evolution from two regional conferences, which were originally the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union in the East and the Western Interprovincial Football Union in the West. Although the CFL was officially founded in 1958, its constituent sections did not fully merge until 1981. At the time, it was agreed that three teams from each division would qualify, regardless of overall league standings. This quickly proved controversial, as a wide disparity in playing caliber had emerged between the East and West divisions. Since the league had also implemented a fully balanced schedule (each of the nine teams played each opponent once at home and once on the road), this disparity (made even worse by the fact the West had one more team than the East) was fully exposed in the standings - in each of the first three seasons of the new format, the fourth place team missed the playoffs with records as good as 9-7 in the West, while in the East records as bad as 3-13 were good enough for third place and a playoff berth. In 1981, even the fifth place Western team's record of 6-10 was good enough for outright possession of sixth place overall. In 1986, the playoff format was changed. The new format the fourth place team in one division to qualify if it finished with an outright better record than the third place team in the other division. The Eastern owners agreed in exchange for expanding the schedule to 18 games, and also with a stipulation that the qualifying fourth-place team would stay in its own division for the playoffs. As a result, the change introduced the possibility of a four team bracket in one division and a two- game total point series in the other (the two game total point format was nothing new in Canadian football - it was commonly used until the early 1970s). It also introduced the possibility of the first place teams losing their traditional byes based on results elsewhere in the league. This occurred in 1986, when the 11-7 Calgary Stampeders qualified in place of the 4-14 Montreal Alouettes. The Alouettes folded before the start of the following season. Although it is highly questionable whether a 1986 playoff appearance would have saved the floundering Montreal franchise, the CFL quickly re- instated the traditional playoff format for the 1987 season. It also moved the Winnipeg Blue Bombers (the West's easternmost team) to the Eastern Division. This balanced the divisions both in numbers as well as, to a considerable extent, in playing caliber, and the reduction in teams also caused the schedule to be changed to emphasize more divisional games. As a result, the three top finishers of the two divisions finishers always had the six best league records from 1987 up until the start of the league's U.S. expansion experiment, which started in the 1993. The current rule was adopted after the league re-activated the Alouettes and reverted to an all-Canadian alignment in 1996. It allows the fourth place team of one division to \\"cross over\\" and take the place of the third place team in the other divisional bracket, provided the fourth place team has more points (i.e. an outright better record) than the third place team. Since the cross over team enters as the third place team, it never receives home field advantage in the playoffs, even if its record is better than that of one or both of the qualifying teams in the other division. As of 2019, all teams to qualify under this rule have crossed over from the Western Division to the Eastern bracket, although there have been a handful of occasions where a fourth placed Eastern team was in mathematical contention for a Western cross-over berth late in the season. Cross-over teams have advanced as far as the Eastern Final, but as of 2018 have never advanced to the Grey Cup game. There is no provision for a fifth placed team in one division to cross over in place of the other division's runner-up, even if it has a better record; in 2018 the Edmonton Eskimos finished fifth in the West with a 9-9 record and missed the playoffs while the Hamilton Tiger-Cats finished 8-10 and qualified as Eastern runners-up. Thus, it is theoretically possible (but it has not yet occurred) that all four Eastern Division teams could reach the playoffs, but not for all five Western Division teams.  Professional tennis  In professional tennis tournaments, a wild card refers to a tournament entry awarded to a player at the discretion of the organizers. All ATP and WTA tournaments have a few spots set aside for wild cards in both the main draw, and the qualifying draw, for players who otherwise would not have made either of these draws with their professional ranking. They are usually awarded to players from the home and/or sponsoring country (sometimes after a tournament where the winner is awarded the wild card), promising young players, players that are likely to draw a large crowd, have won the tournament earlier or players who were once ranked higher and are attempting a comeback (for instance, following a long-term injury). High ranked players can also ask for a wild card if they want to enter a non-mandatory tournament after the normal entry deadline, for example because they lost early in another tournament. This means a wild card player sometimes becomes the top seed. The organizers of three of the Grand Slam tournaments ‚Äîthe Australian Open, French Open, and US Open‚Äî grant one wild card nomination to each of the other two.Australian Open to hold wildcard playoff in China - Reuters, 17 September 2012 Christopher Clarey described this practice as \\"nothing more than mutual back scratching\\" and \\"an outdated symbol of elitism\\".Wishes for Tennis in 2018 - Christopher Clarey, The New York Times, 12 January 2018 =Notable wildcards= * In 2001, Goran Ivani≈°eviƒá won the Wimbledon Men's Singles championships having been handed a wild-card entry by the organising All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. At the time, he was ranked world No. 125 after a shoulder injury but had earlier reached the final three times. * In 2009, Kim Clijsters won the US Open tournament, after receiving a wild-card entry. It was her first Grand Slam tournament since announcing her comeback to the sport, having first retired in 2007 to start a family. She was a former champion and world No. 1 but was unranked since she had only played two other tournaments (also on wild cards) since her comeback, and three were required to get a rank. * In 2012, Jonathan Marray and Frederik Nielsen won the Wimbledon Men's Doubles after being selected as a wild card. They had no significant results but Marray was a home player. * In 2017, Maria Sharapova was granted a wild card to play in the US Open. She was a former champion and had finished serving a 15-month doping ban earlier in the year. * In 2019, 15-year-old Coco Gauff received a wild card to play at the Wimbledon qualifying event, and advanced to the last 16 of the main draw.  Motorsport  =Motorcycle racing= In motorcycle racing the term 'wild card' is used for competitors only involved in individual rounds of a championship, usually their local round. Local riders taking advantage of their local knowledge (often having raced that circuit on that bike before) and affording to take risks without planning for a championship, often upset established runners. Makoto Tamada and Shaky Byrne have both taken double victories in Superbike World Championship rounds in their home countries. The most famous wild card entry perhaps was the late Daijiro Kato with finishing 3rd at his first appearance in 1996 and then winning the Japanese 250cc Grand Prix back to back in 1997 and 1998 on his way to become the most successful 250cc World Champion of all time in 2001. Grand Prix motorcycle racing Each Grand Prix host Federation (FMNR) may nominate 3 wild card entries for the Moto3 and Moto2 classes in their own Grand Prix only. The MSMA (Motorcycle Sport Manufacturers‚Äô Association) may, at each event, nominate 1 wild card entry for the Moto2 and MotoGP classes. The FIM may, at each event, nominate 2 wild card entries for the Moto3 and Moto2 classes and FIM/DORNA may, at each event, nominate 1 wild card entry for the MotoGP class. Superbike World Championship Each Event host Federation (FMNR) may nominate 4 wild card entries for the Superbike class and 2 wild card entries for the Supersport and Superstock classes, in their own event only. The FIM may nominate 2 wild card entries for the Superbike class. Motorcycle Speedway In Motorcycle Speedway, wild cards compete in the Speedway Grand Prix events in which there is 1 wild card per competition (until 2005 there were 2 per Grand Prix). six wild cards have won a Grand Prix: Mark Loram in 1999, Martin Dugard in 2000, Hans Andersen in 2006 (later that year he replaced a permanent rider and went on to win another GP), Michael Jepsen Jensen in 2012, Adrian Miedzi≈Ñski in 2013 and Bartosz Zmarzlik in 2014. =Auto racing= Wild Card entries are not unknown in auto racing either, although the Concorde Agreement in modern-day Formula One requires all teams to participate in every event. John Love came close to winning the 1967 South African Grand Prix in a wild card type situation, long before the term had been coined. Although the term is rarely used in NASCAR, the concept of a road course ringer is similar. Before the late-1990s, NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series races in the West and Northeast respectively would have several drivers from the Winston West and Busch North series, as the series regulations were very similar, and until the mid-2000s, ARCA drivers would usually attempt Cup races in the Midwest and at restrictor-plate races. During the period of the mid-1980s until 2004, individual NASCAR races utilized the \\"Promoter's Option\\" (also known as Provisionals) to allow a top driver/team that did not qualify for the race, the opportunity for a \\"wild card\\" type starting position at the end of the grid. This allowed track owners to advertise and guarantee to fans that the most popular drivers would participate in the race (pleasing fans in attendance, and preventing no-shows) even if the driver had an unfortunate mishap (e.g., blown engine) or crash during time trials. Starting in 2005, only the Former Champion's Provisional remains. During the NASCAR Sprint All- Star Race (a non-points exhibition event) one driver who fails to qualify for the race is awarded a wild card spot via \\"Fans Choice\\" vote. In 2008, Kasey Kahne, was selected as a wild card via fan vote, and went on to win the race. From 2011 to 2013, NASCAR's top-level Sprint Cup Series, since renamed the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series, used \\"wild cards\\" in a different context, namely that of qualifying for the season-ending Chase for the Sprint Cup, now rebranded as the NASCAR playoffs. In previous seasons, the top 12 drivers in championship points after the first 26 races of the season automatically qualified for the Chase, with their points reset to a point unreachable by any other driver. Under the 2011‚Äì2013 system, only the top 10 drivers automatically qualified. The other two Chase qualifiers were the two drivers ranked from 11th through 20th after 26 races with the most race wins, with tiebreakers used as necessary to restrict the number of \\"wild cards\\" to two. Major changes to the Chase format that took effect in 2014, most notably determining the newly expanded Chase field of 16 mainly by race wins, eliminated this type of \\"wild card\\". College and university sports NCAA tournaments in all of its sports have included wild card berths, typically known as at-large berths or at-large bids. Winners of each athletic conference's tournament (or, in the case of basketball's National Invitation Tournament, the team with the best regular season record in that conference) are granted automatic bids into the tournament, and a selection committee fills the remaining slots in the tournament bracket with who it determines to be the best teams who did not win their tournament (in practice, major conferences with stronger reputations and more revenue are invariably favored over mid-majors with similar records). =College basketball= Each year, the NCAA grants automatic berths in both the men's and women's Division I basketball tournaments to the winners of 32 conferences. Since the Ivy League added a conference tournament in 2017, every conference's automatic berth is granted to the team that wins its conference postseason tournament. The NCAA has established Selection Committees for both the men's and women's tournaments. Teams that did not win their conference tournament may be eligible to earn an at-large berth. At-large berths are determined by record, ranking, strength of schedule, and many other factors. A key factor in determining at-large berths is the Ratings Percentage Index, popularly referred to as the NET. The fields of 68 teams that participate in the men's tournament, and 64 for the women's tournament, are filled as follows: *32 automatic berths (since the 2016-17 season, winners of each conference tournament) *At-large berths **36 in the men's tournament **32 in the women's tournament After all automatic berths are filled, the teams that did not win their conference tournaments are studied to see if they can make the tournament anyway. Once conference tournaments are complete, the Selection Committee need not consider conference affiliations in determining at-large berths, making it free to select as many teams from one conference as it deems correct. Most mid-major conferences or smaller conferences will receive no at- large berths, and only the winner of the conference tournament will advance to the NCAA Tournament, making for some heartbreaking moments in the tournaments of smaller conferences. The conference tournaments of major conferences are generally less important, as most losers will make the \\"Big Dance\\" via an at- large bid, but often lesser big conference teams will sneak in using the conference tournament, stealing a bid from a deserving mid-major team in the long run. At-large berths are not necessarily lesser teams than automatic berths. They simply did not play well enough at the time of their conference tournaments. Often, at-large berths will get higher seeds than the teams that beat them in the conference tourney, because the Selection Committee judges base their judgment on the entire season. Division I independents do not play a conference tournament and therefore do not have an automatic berth, and can only receive an at-large bid to the tournament, which rarely happens in today's game. Sometimes, a team that is otherwise deserving of a bid may be ineligible for the tournament due to an NCAA post-season ban, applied only as a punishment for egregious violations of NCAA rules in that school's program in that sport. With a 68-team field (64 for women), and 32 automatic berths, the Selection Committee must pick the 36 (men's) or 32 (women's) most deserving teams that are left, which ends up being a long difficult process, which culminates in one of the most intense days in U.S. sports, Selection Sunday. Selection Sunday is a televised event where the brackets are revealed. There are almost always interesting arguments about who should be in and who should be out because there are often more than 34 teams that could be considered deserving of a bid. Many final teams that make it, and final teams that are cut are often thought of as interchangeable. This ends up resulting, sometimes, in major surprises of who makes the tournament as at-large teams. At-large teams often will win the tournament which included the last four NCAA Men's Basketball Champions (Connecticut in 2014, Duke in 2015, Villanova in 2016 and North Carolina in 2017). Conferences The conferences that are known for many at-large bids are generally the so-called Power Five conferences that receive automatic places in the bowl games associated with the College Football Playoff‚Äîthe ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC. Other conferences that receive multiple at-large bids on a regular basis are the high-major offshoots of the original Big East Conference, the current Big East and The American. The Atlantic 10 and the Mountain West receive multiple bids on a regular basis as well. The Horizon League, Mid-American Conference, Missouri Valley and West Coast Conference have also received more than just the automatic berth several times. Certain conferences have never, and probably will not in the near future, get an at-large bid, simply because no team in the conference can ever be one of the best 68 teams in the country, and even if one does, two at the same time would be virtually unheard of. Therefore, it is also often argued that these very small conferences do not even deserve their one automatic bid and it should be given to a more deserving large conference team. Most argue that this would take away from the point of the 68-team large tournament style, that always gives the underdog the chance for an upset. These conferences include the Big Sky Conference and the Southwestern Athletic Conference. One of these conferences recently made an argument for their best team to make the tournament, even though it lost in the conference tourney. Oral Roberts of the Mid-Continent Conference blew through their conference in the regular season but lost in the conference tournament, ending with a conference record of 17-1. They did not make the tournament, and Oakland University won the bid. Utah State and Holy Cross also had arguments like this recently. A new way to solve the problem is to attempt to switch to a more prominent conference, a phenomenon that was especially prevalent in 2005 and the early 2010s. Many teams made significant moves in that period, with some making multiple moves. A few of the more notable moves were: * Butler (Horizon League to A10 in 2012, then to the new Big East in 2013) * Louisville (C-USA to Big East in 2005, spent one season in The American after the 2013 Big East split, then to the ACC in 2014) * TCU (C-USA to MW in 2005, then to the Big 12 in 2012) * UCF (Atlantic Sun Conference to C-USA in 2005, then to The American in 2013) * Utah (MW to Pac-12 in 2011) Other tournaments The NIT, held for the best teams that didn't make the NCAA Tournament, was at one time an entirely at-large event (hence its name, the National Invitation Tournament); new regulations, however, offer automatic bids to teams regular season conference champions which failed to win their post-season conference tournament. The College Basketball Invitational and CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament both seed their entire tournaments with at-large bids. =College football= At-large bids are sometimes used for bowl games contested between NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision teams. Most bowl games have tie-ins with specific conferences; for example, the Rose Bowl Game has traditionally hosted conference champions from the Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference (or their predecessors). Conferences are sometimes unable to provide a team to a bowl that they have a tie-in with; this happens when a conference has signed tie-in contracts with more bowls than the number of bowl-eligible teams it has in a given year. In such cases, bowl organizers will issue an at-large bid to a team in another conference or an independent team. For example, the 2009 Humanitarian Bowl had tie-ins with the Western Athletic Conference and the Mountain West Conference. However, the TCU Horned Frogs of Mountain West were selected for the Fiesta Bowl (a New Year's Six bowl game), and all of the Mountain West's other teams were either tied into other bowls or ineligible. As a result, bowl organizers issued an at-large bid, which went to the Bowling Green Falcons of the Mid-American Conference. Game shows =Jeopardy!= Wild cards are a regular feature in tournaments of the popular game show Jeopardy!. Jeopardy! tournaments generally run for 10 consecutive episodes (which air from Monday to Friday inclusive over two weeks) and feature 15 contestants. The first week's five episodes, called the \\"quarter-finals\\", feature three new contestants each day. The winners of these five games, and the four highest scoring non-winners (\\"wild cards\\"), advance to the semi- finals, which run for three days. The winners of these three games advance to play in a two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall winner. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by long time host Alex Trebek himself. To prevent later contestants from playing to beat the earlier wild card scores instead of playing to win, contestants are \\"completely isolated from the studio until it is their time to compete.\\" If there is a tie for the final wild card position, the non-winner that advances will be based on the same regulations as two contestants who tie for second in a regular game; the tie-breaker is the contestant's score after the Double Jeopardy! round, and if further tied, the score after the Jeopardy! round determines the contestant who advances as the wild card. If two or more contestants tie for the highest score (greater than zero) at the end of a first round match, the standard tiebreaker is used with the player who loses that tiebreaker eligible for a wild card. If none of the contestants in a quarter-final or semi-final game end with a positive score, no contestant automatically qualifies from that game, and an additional wild card contestant advances instead. This occurred in the quarter-finals of the 1991 Seniors Tournament and the semi- finals of the 2013 Teen Tournament.  Use outside North America  Although the term \\"wild card\\" is not generally common in sports outside North America, a few competitions effectively (used to) employ such a system to determine one or more reserved places in a particular phase of a competition. = Olympics = In the Olympics, several sport governing bodies award wild cards to nations in order to further promote their sport. Sports governing bodies will either make selections or hold a tournament to determine the wild cards. One such notable wild card selection was Equatorial Guinea swimmer Eric Moussambani, who finished last in the 100m meter event in the 2000 Summer Olympics. Other times, wild card spots are offered to ease political tension such as the case of North Korean athletes participating in the 2018 Winter Olympics despite most of them not meeting the qualification criteria. = Basketball =  FIBA Basketball World Cup  The world championship for basketball, the FIBA Basketball World Cup, invites four wild cards to complete its 24-team field. Teams have to participate in qualifying for the World Cup, have to apply to be one, and FIBA is not allowed more than three teams from the same continent in order to be selected. This setup began in 2006, where Italy, Puerto Rico, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkey were selected by FIBA; Turkey made the best performance, reaching the quarterfinals. In 2010, FIBA selected Germany, Lithuania, Lebanon, and Russia as the wild cards, with Lithuania finishing third, and Russia making it to the quarterfinals. For the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, FIBA selected Brazil, Finland, Greece, and Turkey; 2014 will be the last time FIBA will select wild cards, as the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup would no longer have wild cards when it expands to 32 teams. The perennial top two FIBA Oceania team namely Australia and New Zealand as wild card teams of FIBA Asia Cup 2017 in Lebanon. These two teams are also part of FIBA Asia in Basketball tournaments including FIBA World Qualifying Tournament for FIBA World Cup 2019 in China.  Philippine Basketball Association  In the Philippine Basketball Association, the playoffs are done after an elimination (in 2005-06, a classification) round where the top two teams with the best records are given semi-final byes, the next 3 are given quarterfinal byes, the next 4 are given entry to the wildcard phase, and the tenth team is eliminated. The winner of the wild card playoffs, varying in format from a round-robin, a single-elimination or sudden death, usually meets the strongest quarterfinalist (the 3rd seed). The wild card winner's next opponent for the quarterfinals rested while the wild card phase was ongoing so the chance of advancing to the semi-finals (in which a team rested longer) is slim. The only wild card champion are the 7th-seeded Barangay Ginebra Kings in the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference after 7 years of championship drought they made an epic run all the way to the throne, in which the top 2 teams were given semifinal byes while the bottom eight went through a knock-out wild card tournament. Since the addition of the quarterfinal bye, no wild card has entered the Finals, although the Air21 Express won the third- place trophy at the 2005-06 PBA Fiesta Conference. The wild card set up was no longer used when the league reverted to the 3-conference format starting from the 2010‚Äì11 PBA season.  Euroleague  The Euroleague, a Europe-wide competition for elite basketball clubs, once had one \\"wild card\\" advancing from its first phase, officially the Regular Season, to its second, called the Top 16. The rule was in place through the 2007‚Äì08 season. At that time, the competition began each year with 24 clubs, divided into three groups. (Today, the competition starts with a preliminary stage of 16 teams playing down to two survivors, who join 22 other teams in the Regular Season.) Then as now, the groups played a double round-robin for the Regular Season, with eight clubs eliminated and the remaining clubs advancing to the Top 16. Under the rules in place through 2007‚Äì08, the top five clubs in each group automatically advanced. The final \\"wild card\\" spot in the Top 16 went to the sixth-place club with the best overall record, with three potential tiebreaking steps. A coin toss is not indicated as a possible step. Starting in 2008‚Äì09, the \\"wild card\\" was abolished when the Regular Season was reorganized into four groups with 6 teams apiece. Now, the top four teams in each group advance to the Top 16. No change to the tiebreakers was made. = ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final = For both the junior and senior Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final (which starting in the 2008‚Äì2009 figure skating season will be merged into a single two-division event), the hosting federation may issue a wild card invitation to one of their own skaters should no skater from the host country qualify for the event through the Grand Prix circuit. Use of the wild card has not been common; however, it was used at the 2007‚Äì2008 Junior Grand Prix Final by the Polish federation. = All-Ireland Senior (Gaelic) Football Championship = In the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship, the premier competition in Gaelic football, each of the thirty-two counties in Ireland as well as London and New York play in their respective Provincial Championships through a knock-out cup competition format without seeds. The winners of each of the four Provincial Championships earn one of eight places in the All- Ireland Quarter Finals. The thirty teams that fail to win their respective Provincial Championships receive a second opportunity to reach the All-Ireland Series via the All Ireland Qualifiers (also known as the 'back door', similar to a Wild Card). = Road cycling = In road cycling (teams), a wild card refers to an invitation to a race which a particular team would not normally be able to enter. Usually used for top division (currently UCI World Tour) races where the organization want more teams, lower league teams will be invited. It is very common to offer a wild card for teams from the same country to help local sport and to boost national pride. For example, for the 100th \\"Tour de France\\" in 2013, the organisers (the Amaury Sport Organisation) awarded three wild cards to French teams: Cofidis, Sojasun and Team Europcar, all of which were UCI Professional Continental teams at the time and therefore not automatically invited, unlike the UCI ProTeams which made up the vast majority of the entry list. Teams can apply for a wild card. In January 2015, Team MTN-Qhubeka from South Africa accepted an invitation to participate in the 2015 edition of \\"Tour de France\\". MTN-Qhubeka was the first African team to receive a wild card entry into the event that was held from 4 to 26 July 2015. = Rugby =  European club rugby competitions  Rugby union's analogue to the Euroleague is the European Rugby Champions Cup, which replaced the previous top-level club competition, the Heineken Cup, starting with the 2014‚Äì15 season. The Champions Cup maintains a system originally created for the Heineken Cup in which some \\"wild card\\" teams advance to the competition's knockout stages. Also starting in 2014‚Äì15, the organiser of the Champions Cup, European Professional Club Rugby, introduced this type of \\"wild card\\" to the second-level European Rugby Challenge Cup. During the last five seasons of the Heineken Cup (2009‚Äì10 to 2013‚Äì14), another \\"wild card\\" system allowed teams to parachute into the original European Challenge Cup, which has now been replaced by the current Challenge Cup. This was scrapped with the creation of the current Challenge Cup. Both the Champions Cup and current Challenge Cup involve 20 clubs (compared to 24 in the Heineken Cup and 20 in the original Challenge Cup), divided into pools of four clubs with each club playing a double round-robin within its pool. In both competitions, eight clubs advance to the knockout stages. The top club in each pool advances; the three \\"wild card\\" places are filled by the second-place clubs with the best overall records. For the Champions Cup, the number of wild cards increased by one from the Heineken Cup era; both versions of the Challenge Cup had three wild cards, but the original version filled them in an entirely different manner. In the final years of the Heineken Cup, starting in 2009‚Äì10 and ending with the 2014 reorganisation of European club rugby, the three second-place teams with the next-best records after those that advanced to the Heineken Cup knockout stage parachuted into the Challenge Cup. The tiebreaking procedure used to determine overall seeding, which was devised in the Heineken Cup era and carried over intact into the current era, is almost as elaborate as that of the NFL, with a total of seven steps (a coin flip is the last). Prior to 2009‚Äì10, the original Challenge Cup also had \\"wild card\\" teams entering its knockout stages. The top club in each pool advanced to the knockout stage, along with the three second- place teams with the best records, using the same tiebreaking procedure as the Heineken Cup. Starting in 2009‚Äì10, only the winner of each pool entered the knockout stage, to be joined by the teams parachuting in from the Heineken Cup. As noted above, with the creation of the new Challenge Cup, that competition abandoned this system in favour of the system used in the Champions Cup.  Super Rugby  The Super Rugby competition, involving regional franchises from Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, adopted a new playoff system with \\"wild cards\\" when it expanded to 15 teams in 2011. In its previous incarnations as Super 12 and Super 14 (each number reflecting the number of teams in the competition), it used a Shaughnessy playoff system in which the top four teams advanced to a knockout stage. The expansion to 15 teams led to major changes in the competition format. Through the 2015 season, the competition was divided into three conferences of five teams each, with every conference consisting solely of teams from one of the participating countries. At the end of the regular season, the winners of each conference received playoff berths. These teams were joined by three \\"wild cards\\", specifically the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference. (Tiebreakers were employed as necessary.) With the expansion of Super Rugby to 18 teams in 2016, featuring a permanent sixth franchise for South Africa and new teams based in Argentina and Japan, the competition format was changed again. The competition is now divided into the Australasian Group, including all Australian and New Zealand teams, and the African Group, consisting of the South African teams plus the Argentine and Japanese franchises. In turn, the Australasian Group is divided into Australia and New Zealand Conferences, and the African Group is split into Africa 1 and Africa 2 Conferences. As in the 2011‚Äì15 system, the conference winners will receive playoff berths. The number of wild cards will increase to four, with the three top non-winners from the Australasian Group and the top non-winner from the African Group, again based on competition points, earning those spots.  Rugby World Cup  In the current format of the Rugby World Cup, a team that finishes 3rd in their group automatically gains a berth in the next Rugby World Cup (although they do not advance to the next round). Additionally, the Rugby World Cup qualifying format uses a repechage, in which teams from other regions that did not gain the automatic spot play each other for the final spots in the World Cup.

Anchiceratops was a medium-sized, heavily built, ground-dwelling, quadrupedal herbivore that could grow up to an estimated long. Its skull featured two long brow horns and a short horn on the nose. The skull frill was elongated and rectangular, its edges adorned by coarse triangular projections. About a dozen skulls of the genus have been found. Description Size comparison using a typical chasmosaurine body. Like other ceratopsids, A. ornatus was a quadrupedal herbivore with three horns on its face, a parrot-like beak, and a long frill extending from the back of its head. The two horns above the eyes were longer than the single horn on its snout, as in other chasmosaurines. Anchiceratops was a medium-sized ceratopsid. If specimen NMC 8547 is not taken into account, no very exact estimations of the body length of Anchiceratops can be given. Some popular science books state that it approached 20 feet (6 m) in length.\\"Anchiceratops.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 124. . In 2010 Gregory S. Paul, on the assumption that specimen NMC 8547 represented Anchiceratops, estimated its length at 4.3 metres, its weight at 1.2 tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 268 Anchiceratops frills are very distinctive. Rectangular in shape, the frill is edged by large epoccipitals, which are osteoderms in the form of triangular bony projections. These are exceptionally wide and coarse. Some of these epoccipitals are on the side of the frill, formed by the squamosal; these episquamosals vary between five and nine in number. The last episquamosal is very large, approaching the size of the three osteoderms per side on the rear edge of the frill, the epiparietals. Another characteristic feature is the pair of bony knobs located on either side of the midline, towards the end of the frill. These are pointing sideways and are very variable in form and size between individuals. The parietal bone, forming the rear edge and the middle of the frill, has smaller parietal fenestrae, window-like openings, than those seen in other chasmosaurines like Pentaceratops and Torosaurus. The frill has deep arterial grooves on both the upper and the underside. Restoration, with generalised chasmosaurine rump, not based on NMC 8547 Specimen NMC 8547, on which traditionally descriptions of the postcrania of Anchiceratops have been based, has many traits that are unique in the Chasmosaurinae. The vertebral column contains seventy-four vertebrae: ten of the neck, thirteen dorsals, twelve sacrals and thirty-nine caudals. Typically chasmosaurines have twelve dorsals, ten sacrals and up to forty-six tail vertebrae. Mallon presumed that the synsacrum, the fused vertebrae supporting the pelvis, had shifted to the rear. The neck of NMC 8547 is exceptionally long, with four syncervicals, fused anterior cervical vertebrae. Also the pelvis is very long. The tail is short. The forelimbs are very robust, with a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus, indicating a heavy musculature. Discoveries and species Type specimen AMNH 5251 The first remains of Anchiceratops were discovered along the Red Deer River in the Canadian province of Alberta in 1912 by an expedition led by Barnum Brown. The holotype, specimen AMNH 5251, is the back half of a skull, including the long frill, and two other partial skulls, specimens AMNH 5259 (the paratype) and AMNH 5273, were found at the same time, which are now stored in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. A complete skull designated NMC 8535, was discovered by Charles M. Sternberg at Morrin in 1924, and was described as A. longirostris five years later, in 1929. but this species is widely considered a junior synonym of A. ornatus today. In total, at least ten incomplete skulls have been recovered. The skulls are different with respect to their proportions (e.g. size of the supraorbital horn cores, the dimensions of the frill) which had led researchers to conclude that the disparity is ontogenetic. The genus name Anchiceratops, means \\"near horned face\\", and is derived from the Greek words \\"anchi\\" (Œ±Œ≥œáŒπ-) meaning \\"near\\", \\"keras\\" (Œ∫ŒµœÅŒ±œÇ) meaning \\"horn\\", and \\"ops\\" (œâœà) meaning \\"face\\". Anchiceratops was described and named by American paleontologist Barnum Brown, in 1914, as he believed that this dinosaur represented a transitional form closely related to both Monoclonius and Triceratops and intermediate between them, but closest in the development of the skull frill to the latter, hence the generic name meaning \\"near Ceratops\\". The type and only valid species known today is Anchiceratops ornatus, whose name refers to the ornate margin of its frill. Another specimen, NMC 8547 (or CMN 8547) collected by Sternberg in 1925, lacks most of the skull but is otherwise the most complete skeleton known from any ceratopsid, preserving a complete spinal column down to the last tail vertebra. Sternberg's material is now housed in the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa. NMC 8547 is displayed as a half-mount with the better preserved right side showing, and completed with a cast skull replica of NMC 8535. Other material has been found since, including one or two possible bonebed deposits in Alberta, but very little Anchiceratops material has been described.Dodson, P. 1996. The Horned Dinosaurs. Princeton: Princeton University Press. 346 pp NMC 8547 mounted at the Canadian Museum of Nature, completed with a skull cast of NMC 8535. NMC 8547 might represent a separate taxon Most Anchiceratops fossils have been discovered in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, which belongs to the later part of the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period (Anchiceratops remains are known from the lower part of the formation, and range in age between 72.5-71 million years ago). Frill fragments found in the early Maastrichtian Almond Formation of Wyoming in the United States resemble Anchiceratops. However, brown horn fragments (specimens NMC 9590 and 10645) and frill pieces (specimina NMC 9813, 9814 and 9829) have been found from two localities in the older OldmanWeishampel, D.B., Barrett, P.M., Coria, R.A., Le Loueff, J., Xu X., Zhao X., Sahni, A., Gomani, E.M.P., & Noto, C.N. 2004.

Pp. 517-606. and Dinosaur Park Formations (late Campanian, 76.5-75 million years ago) with the characteristic pattern of points seen in Anchiceratops frills. These may represent early records of A. ornatus or possibly a second, related species. Anchiceratops remains were also recovered in terrestrial sediments from the St. Mary River Formation at the Scabby Butte locality in southwestern Alberta, however, the fossils cannot be referred to a specific species. In 2012, Mallon concluded that many more Anchiceratops fossils had been collected than previously had been realised. These included the specimens TMP 1983.001.0001, a nearly complete skull of a juvenile; UW 2419, a nearly complete skull; ROM 802, a skull lacking the snout; FMNH P15003, the upper side of a skull lacking the snout; CMN 11838, a left skull frill; CMN 12-1915, frill fragments; and UALVP 1618, the rear edge of a frill. This larger number of fossils can be examined by statistical analysis to solve certain long-standing controversies about the genus.

(2010) confirmed this assignment.M. J. Ryan, A. P. Russell, and S. Hartman. 2010. A new chasmosaurine ceratopsid from the Judith River Formation, Montana. In M. J. Ryan, B. J. Chinnery-Allgeier, D. A. Eberth (eds.), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium. Indiana University Press, Bloomington 181-188 Modern cladistic analyses usually recover Anchiceratops in a more advanced position within the Chasmosaurinae, closer to Arrhinoceratops than to Chasmosaurus. Mallon's study of 2012 concluded however, that Anchiceratops was more closely related to Chasmosaurus than to Triceratops, suggesting that this genus was less derived than previously thought. C.M. Sternberg had originally designated a smaller skull as the type specimen for a new species Anchiceratops longirostris, because of its size and its horns which are significantly more slender and point forward instead of upward. Later however, paleontologists had concluded that the size and form of this skull falls within the expected range of variation seen in A. ornatus and that it was probably a member of that species. In 2010 Mallon removed specimen NMC 8547 from the fossil material of Anchiceratops because of the few frill elements associated with it and because it could not be determined with certainty whether the material belonged to this taxon. The related Arrhinoceratops is known from the same formation, and has a comparable frill surface structure. According to Mallon, in 1925 C.M. Sternberg had referred the material to Anchiceratops because he had been unaware that Arrhinoceratops had been described in March of that year. If correct, this would mean that no unequivocal postcrania (all skeletal elements posterior to the skull) of Anchiceratops are known.J.C. Mallon and R. Holmes (2010) \\"Description of a complete and fully articulated chasmosaurine postcranium previously assigned to Anchiceratops (Dinosauria: Ceratopsia)\\", In: M. J. Ryan, B. J. Chinnery- Allgeier, and D. A. Eberth (eds.), New Perspectives on Horned Dinosaurs: The Royal Tyrrell Museum Ceratopsian Symposium. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, Indiana. pp 189‚Äì202 Paleobiology Restoration Anchiceratops is rare compared to other ceratopsians in the area, and usually found near marine sediments, in both the Horseshoe Canyon and Dinosaur Park Formations. This indicates that Anchiceratops may have lived in estuaries where other ceratopsids did not live. Flowering plants were increasingly common but still rare compared to the conifers, cycads and ferns which probably made up the majority of ceratopsian diets. In 1914 Brown suggested that the distinctive frill and horn form of Anchiceratops were caused by sexual selection and intra-species recognition, as he could not explain the differences between the taxa by a difference in defence function. In 1959, Wann Langston Jr. suggested that Anchiceratops engaged in a semi-aquatic lifestyle. The long snout would have allowed the animal to cross deeper swamps walking, catching breath on the water's surface and the heavy frill would have acted as a counterbalance to help point the beak upwards. Later paleontologists tended to reject this notion, emphasizing that dinosaurs in general were land animals, but in 2012 Mallon again suggested a semi-aquatic lifestyle, like a modern hippopotamus, at least for specimen NMC 8547. This would be an explanation for the robustness and extreme musculature of the limbs. Mallon admitted that its small tail was not a swimming-organ. Partial skull FMNH P15003 in the Field Museum In 1990 Thomas Lehman proposed that Anchiceratops was a sexually dimorphic genus, where the skull of A. longirostris represents a female. The other Anchiceratops skulls that are larger, more robust, and have much longer horns that point more vertically were proposed to represent males.Lehman, T.M. 1990. \\"The ceratopsian subfamily Chasmosaurinae: sexual dimorphism and systematics\\". In: Carpenter, K. & Currie, P.J. (Eds.). Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Pp. 211‚Äì219 Preliminary statistical analysis of the Anchiceratops specimens by Mallon (2012) revealed that these variations in skull form do not actually fall into two distinct morphs, and more likely represent individual variation, forcing him to reject the hypothesis that there were two species. Likewise there was no proof of sexual dimorphism.Mallon, J. (2012). \\"Variation in the skull of Anchiceratops, a horned dinosaur from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation.\\" Royal Tyrrell Museum Speaker Series 2012. In 2012, Jordan Cole Mallon e.a. pointed out that Anchicertops ornatus as a species was exceptionally long-lived; other ceratopsid species typically last a few hundred thousand years. Several possible explanations were given: a decreased competition by related species; less habitat fragmentation by the recession of the Western Interior Seaway; and a more generalist lifestyle. Paleoecology Restoration of two individuals facing off, with Ornithomimus in the foreground The Horseshoe Canyon Formation has been radiometrically dated as being between 74 and 67 million years old. It was deposited during the gradual withdrawal of the Western Interior Seaway, during the Campanian and Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is a terrestrial unit which is part of the Edmonton Group that includes the Battle Formation and the Whitemud Member, both in Edmonton. The valley where dinosaurs lived included ancient meandering estuary channels, straight channels, peat swamps, river deltas, floodplains, shorelines and wetlands. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, and tidal flats. The area was wet and warm with a temperate to subtropical climate. Just prior to the Campanian‚ÄìMaastrichtian boundary, the mean annual temperature and precipitation in this region dropped rapidly. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. Anchiceratops specimens are found in the upper part of Unit one of this formation, part of the Horsetheif member, dated to about 72-71 million years ago. Anchiceratops shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as maniraptorans (Epichirostenotes curriei), ornithomimids (Ornithomimus edmontonicus), pachycephalosaurids (Sphaerotholus edmontonensis), hadrosaurids (Edmontosaurus regalis), ceratopsians (Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis), and unidentified tyrannosaurids, which were apex predators. Of these, the hadrosaurs dominated in terms of sheer number and made up half of all dinosaurs who lived in this region. Other vertebrates present in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation at the time of Anchiceratops included reptiles, and amphibians. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna. Reptiles such as turtles and crocodilians are rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and this was thought to reflect the relatively cool climate which prevailed at the time. A study by Quinney et al. (2013) however, showed that the decline in turtle diversity, which was previously attributed to climate, coincided instead with changes in soil drainage conditions, and was limited by aridity, landscape instability, and migratory barriers. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus was present and freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Evidence has shown that multituberculates and the early marsupial Didelphodon coyi were present. Vertebrate trace fossils from this region included the tracks of theropods, ceratopsians and ornithopods, which provide evidence that these animals were also present.Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm√≥lska, Halszka (eds.): The Dinosauria, 2nd, Berkeley: University of California Press. (2004) 861 pp. . Non-vertebrates in this ecosystem included both marine and terrestrial invertebrates.

E. Hulme which was read to the Poets' Club around the end of 1908. It is a concise statement of Hulme's influential advocacy of free verse. The lecture was not published during Hulme's lifetime. The lecture commences with an apparent attack on the attitudes of some members of the Club, including its president Henry Simpson. Hulme writes: \\"I want to speak of verse in a plain way as I would of pigs: that is the only honest way. The President told us last week that poetry was akin to religion. It is nothing of the sort.\\" Hulme discusses how forms rise and fall, and proceeds to the topic of French vers libre, referring to Gustave Kahn's explanation of the technique: \\"It consisted in a denial of a regular number of syllables as the basis of versification. The length of the line is long and short, oscillating with the images used by the poet; it follows the contours of his thought and is free rather than regular.\\" Hulme concludes with a call to arms: \\"a shell is a very suitable covering for the egg at a certain period of its career, but very unsuitable at a later age. This seems to me to represent fairly well the state of verse at the present time. ... [it] has become alive, it has changed from the ancient art of chanting to the modern impressionist, but the mechanism of verse has remained the same. It can't go on doing so. I will conclude, ladies and gentlemen, by saying, the shell must be broken.\\" Sources * Patrick McGuinness (editor), T. E. Hulme: Selected Writings, Fyfield Books, Carcanet Press, 1998.

Early life H√©bert was born on December 12, 1818 about five miles south of Plaquemine in Iberville Parish, Louisiana.Warner, Ezra J. Generals in Gray: Lives of the Confederate Commanders. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1959. . p. 131. He graduated first in his class at Jefferson College in Convent, in 1836. He then attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1840. He was a classmate of American Civil War Generals William T. Sherman, George H. Thomas, Richard S. Ewell, Bushrod Johnson. The following year he was a professor of engineering at West Point. In 1842, H√©bert married Marie Coralie Wills Vaughn, the daughter of a sugar planter. They had five children. State engineer In 1845, H√©bert resigned from the army after being appointed Chief Engineer of the State of Louisiana by Governor Alexandre Mouton. He was reappointed by Governor Isaac Johnson in 1846, but he resigned in March, 1847 to fight in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Paul H√©bert as a young officer. On March 3, 1847, H√©bert accepted a commission as a lieutenant colonel of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Regiment, and then on April 9, 1847 he was transferred to the U.S. 14th Infantry Regiment. As a lieutenant colonel of the U.S. 14th Infantry Regiment he fought at Contreras, Churubusco, Molino del Rey, Chapultepec and Mexico City. At Molino del Rey he was honored by General Winfield Scott and was brevetted a Colonel for bravery. He was cited for gallantry at Chapultepec and Mexico City. Discharged on July 25, 1848, in New Orleans, Colonel H√©bert entered politics. Political career He ran as a Democrat for the State Senate in 1849. He lost the election by nine votes. Following this he returned to his sugar plantation in Iberville. In 1851, Governor Joseph Marshall Walker appointed H√©bert a delegate to the Industrial Exhibition in London. The next year, a division among Iberville Parish Whigs gave him a seat at the 1852 Louisiana Constitutional Convention which adopted a new state constitution that was strongly pro-Whig. As a result, Governor Walker resigned early and an election was called. Since John Slidell, the leader of one faction of Louisiana Democrats was focusing on his campaign for the U.S. Senate, the Democrats turned to H√©bert as their nominee for governor. He campaigned against some features of the new constitution, called for internal improvements, reform of the state militia, a banking system by general laws and redemption in specie of all paper money. Running against Judge Bordelon, a Whig from St. Landry Parish, H√©bert garnered 17,334 votes to Bordelon's 15,781. Term as governor H√©bert took the oath as Governor and guided the legislature towards improvements in water commerce and railroad construction. He also established the Louisiana Seminary of Learning at Alexandria which would later become Louisiana State University. H√©bert also instituted a state library, reorganized the militia, improved Charity Hospital and organized the efforts against yellow fever of 1853. Nationalism and the rise of the Know Nothing Party or American Party was a feature of Louisiana politics in the 1850s. Whig newspapers tried to discredit H√©bert by starting rumors of his allegiance with the Know Nothings. He still appointed some Whigs to minor offices and some Know Nothings to lucrative posts. He was considered very independent in his appointments and many Democrats were disenchanted with him toward the end of his administration. H√©bert was mentioned as a possible candidate for the U.S. Senate, but John Slidell was not vulnerable to an intraparty challenge. During his administration H√©bert saw four major railroads incorporated in Louisiana including the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad. H√©bert sought to connect every part of Louisiana to New Orleans by rail. He also built levees and sought land reclamation projects. In 1855, H√©bert promoted and the legislature passed a tax of on all property to support the public school system which is open only to whites between the ages of six and sixteen. With his term at an end, Governor H√©bert retired to his plantation as a planter. Civil War With rising tension between North and South, President Abraham Lincoln was elected in December, 1860. Governor Thomas Overton Moore appointed H√©bert to the military board to reorganize militia and defenses in the New Orleans area. He was appointed as a colonel of the 1st Louisiana Artillery. After secession on April 1, 1861 H√©bert was appointed a Brigadier General in the Louisiana Militia. In August, he was commissioned a Brigadier General in the Provisional Army of the Confederacy but was not given an active position. Later he would have a command of Louisiana troops and in the Trans-Mississippi Department. Also on May 21, 1861, his first wife Marie Coralie H√©bert died. He later married Penelope Lynch Andrews, daughter of John Andrews of Iberville Parish. In 1862, General H√©bert was posted to the Department of Texas. Jefferson Davis dismissed him as military commander of Texas on October 10 for imposition of martial law and harsh measures in enforcing conscription. He later participated in the defense of Vicksburg. He saw battle in June, 1863, at the Battle of Milliken's Bend in Louisiana. After that, he was again posted in Texas, where he was at the time the war ended. H√©bert returned to his Louisiana plantation and received a pardon from President Andrew Johnson. Postwar He was active in the politics of Reconstruction supporting the Liberal Republican movement and accepted a minor appointment in New Orleans. In 1872, H√©bert endorsed Horace Greeley and opposed the Louisiana \\"Custom House\\" Republican faction. He supported Republican Governor Henry C. Warmoth. Governor William P. Kellogg appointed him to the Board of State Engineers in 1873 and the Board of U.S. Engineers for Mississippi River Commission in 1874. In the presidential election of 1876, Governor H√©bert changed political allegiance back to the Democrats. He died on April 29, 1880 and was buried in St. Paul Cemetery in Bayou Goula, Louisiana. Encroachment of the Mississippi River caused many individuals to be reinterred. Governor H√©bert's remains, and those of his first wife, Marie Coralie H√©bert, were interred at St. Raphael Cemetery in Point Pleasant, near Plaquemine, LA.

Discovery and naming In 1965, a Polish-Mongolian paleontological expedition found a fossil of a small dinosaur at Bayn Dzak, Mongolia. In 1983, the find was reported by Andrzej Elzanowski.Elzanowski, A., 1983, \\"Birds in Cretaceous Ecosystems\\", Acta Palaeontologia Polonica, 28(1-2): 75-92 The remains were named as the type species Archaeornithoides deinosauriscus by Elzanowski and Peter Wellnhofer in 1992. In 1993, they were described in more detail by the same authors. The generic name (Archaeornithoides) means ‚Äúshaped like an ancient bird‚Äù in Ancient Greek, from ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ, archaios, \\"ancient\\"; ·ΩÑœÅŒΩŒπœÇ, ornis, \\"bird\\"; and Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ, eidos, \\"form\\". The specific descriptor deinosauriscus, \\"little dinosaur\\", alludes to the animal's small size for a dinosaur. The holotype, ZPAL MgD-II/29, was discovered in Late Cretaceous river sandstones of the Djadokhta Formation beds, dating from the late Campanian. It consists of an articulated but fragmentary skull and lower jaws comprehending paired maxillae, a partial jugal, palate bones and dentaries. The specimen represents a juvenile individual. Description The holotype of Archaeornithoides was a very small individual. The head fragment as preserved measures just twenty-seven millimetres in length, indicating an original skull length of about five centimetres. The body length was estimated at fifty to sixty centimetres, making the Archaiornithoides type one of the smallest known non-avian dinosaurs. Adult length is uncertain. The snout of Archaeornithoides features a long antorbital fenestra, stretching over three quarters of the length of the maxilla. The maxilla bears at least eight teeth. These are small, conical and smooth, lacking wrinkles, serrations or carinae. The palatine bone seems to show the presence of a secondary fenestra. Classification El≈ºanowski & Wellnhofer (1993) claimed that Archaeornithoides was the closest known relative to birds or Avialae. This conclusion rested on key bird-like features; an interdigitated suture between the premaxilla and maxilla, broad palatal shelves, pneumatic sinuses, lack of interdental plates, and unserrated teeth. Since publication, though, all of these features have been discovered in new fossils of adult and/or juvenile troodonts and dromaeosaurs.Clark, James M., Norell, Mark A., Makovicky, Peter J. (2002) \\"Cladistic approaches to the relationships of birds to other theropods\\" pp.31-61 in ‚ÄúMesozoic Birds: Above the Heads of Dinosaurs‚Äù Chiappe&Witmer; ed. The describing authors in 1993 also concluded that Archaeornithoides was closely related to troodontids, Spinosauridae and Lisboasaurus, all these taxa together with birds forming a clade, showing that birds originated from a more basal position than normally assumed. However, subsequent research has not supported a close relationship between spinosaurids and troodontids and Lisboasaurus was later shown to be a lizard or a crocodylomorph. Some scientists had suggested that the juvenile specimen of Archaeornithoides may belong to a previously known species of Mongolian troodontid, either Saurornithoides or Byronosaurus. However, studies of a juvenile Byronosaurus skull showed that theropod dinosaurs possess many distinctive adult characteristics even as hatchings or embryos, and that the lack of characters solidly linking Archaeornithoides to known adult specimens shows that it is probably a distinct species. Bever and Norell (in 2009) found no evidence to support the placement of Archaeornithoides close to Avialae, and only weak support for the idea that it is a juvenile troodontid. Possible predation by mammals Elzanowski and Wellnhofer noted that the specimen has distinct bite marks while the back of the head fragment was ragged, and suggested that the jaws were bitten off from its braincase by a Deltatheridium mammal the size of a weasel (adding that these are common in the Bayn Dzak assemblage). Clark and colleagues (2002) noted that it may have also passed through the digestive tract of the predator before fossilization. If true, this may be the first known evidence of Mesozoic mammals feeding on dinosaurs (see Repenomamus).

When visiting Hawaii with Andy Stewart's band, he heard the Hawaiian singer Don Ho perform Tiny Bubbles; this became Devine's signature tune and he went on to sell fifteen million albums. His record sales were revived in December 2005 when a frothy drink making machine was advertised on television using Don Ho's version of Tiny Bubbles. Other songs that Devine made his own include The Answer To Everything, Legend In My Time, Crying Time, When You & I Were Young, Maggie and one that was written for him by his good friend Tommy Scott, Scotland Forever. He is one of \\"Scotland‚Äôs most successful performers\\" of all time (Evening Times, 17 October 2007), and \\"Scotland's most successful crooner\\" who is an \\"ever-present part of the Scottish entertainment industry,\\" (\\"Sydney Devine and the jingle that rings a bell with his fans\\" The Herald, 22 December 2005). The entertainer has sold around 15 million albums (Sydney Devine 2011, Artistes International Management Ltd) - and has recorded and released almost 50 albums, 10 DVDs and more than 20 singles. From late 1974 he hosted a weekly radio show on Radio Clyde called Absolutely Devine and after a few years added a second show called Even More Devine. After leaving Clyde in the early nineties, he broadcast twice a week for West Sound Radio in Ayr. He has had numerous TV specials as well as several appearances on various Hogmanay shows and guesting on shows such as 321, Wogan and Seaside Special. He also hosted his own series, Devine Country, in 1979 with guests such as Stella Parton and Dottsy. In 1977, he was invited to appear in the Queen's Silver Jubilee Royal Variety Performance in Glasgow. In the early eighties he took over as host of the STV Scottish entertainment show, Shindig. In 2014 he celebrated 40 years at Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre with three special shows in November. He is a staunch supporter of The Marie Curie Foundation, and makes himself available for shop openings and events connected to them. In 2010 he was honoured to receive an MBE in honour of his achievements. More recently, he was honoured by the Scottish Music Hall Society with a lifetime achievement reward. He continues to release albums and also appears annually for a run of shows in Glasgow's Pavilion Theatre. He lives in Ayr with his wife Shirley. He is sometimes referred to as 'Steak and Kidney'. In September 2017 Devine, at the age of 78, announced a nationwide tour, nearly 20 years since his previous tour.

It acts as the interchange between the branches to Kirkby and Ormskirk; these lines diverge just north of the station. Kirkdale TMD train maintenance depot, the largest depot on the Merseyrail Network, is located adjacent to the station. History The station originally opened as Bootle Lane was built by the Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway and Liverpool and Bury Railway at the start of their joint line into Liverpool, opening in 1848. In 1977 it became part of the Merseyrail network's Northern Line. =Five tunnels= The station is aligned north‚Äìsouth. Facing north five tunnel portals can be seen north of the platforms. A cluster of three very short tunnels running under a road, is to the west. The three short tunnels were to give greater throughput and are all on the same line. The extreme west left hand tunnel is used for shunting. The next tunnel is the main Merseyrail Northern Line tunnel. The third tunnel is disused, but was in use up until 1968 as the fast line for expresses to Yorkshire and Manchester. To the east is a cluster of two tunnels. The extreme right hand eastern tunnel was an abandoned project. The adjacent tunnel runs in tunnels and cuttings to the disused Walton On The Hill station and was a part of the North Liverpool Extension Line. This section of line was used from 1879 to 1979, however never called at Kirkdale station. =Freight lines= Two freight lines passed through or under the station. The busy Canada Dock Branch freight only line serving Liverpool Docks passes under the station, roughly north-east to south-west, via a tunnel. The North Liverpool Extension Line, also referred to as the eastern section of the Outer Loop, emerged from the north out of a tunnel next to the station, running parallel to the west platform. This section of line was used from 1879 to 1979. Facilities The station (as is usual for most on Merseyrail) is fully staffed throughout the hours of service all week. The platforms are fully accessible and step free (as noted above) and there are shelters, customer information screens and timetable poster boards on each platform. Train running information is also offered by automated announcements. The station has two car parking spaces for disabled users and cycle racks for 10 cycles. Services Trains operate every 15 minutes, Monday-Saturday daytime to either Kirkby or Ormskirk to the north, and every 5 or 10 minutes to Liverpool Central to the south. During the evenings after 20:00 and all day Sundays, services are every 30 minutes to Kirkby and Ormskirk, and every 15 minutes to Liverpool.

History Southern Regional High School opened in 1957 as a junior-senior high school, housing students from Stafford Township, Barnegat, Ocean Township (including its Waretown neighborhood), Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Eagleswood Township, Bass River Township, and all six towns of Long Beach Island. At the time of its founding in 1957, the district had a roughly equal number of students from Long Beach Island and Stafford Township.Brody, Leslie. \\"Regional Schools' Uneven Per-Pupil Costs Get Scrutiny; In some areas of New Jersey, towns pay far more than others, per student, for the same education\\", The Wall Street Journal, February 1, 2016.

'I don't think anybody saw the demographics would change as drastically as they did,' Mr. Henry says. Now 263 students from Long Beach Island attend the district for grades seven through 12, along with 2,263 from Stafford, according to data the state uses to calculate payments.\\" Prior to the opening of Southern Regional, students from Barnegat, Waretown, and Long Beach Island attended the former Barnegat High School, while students from Stafford, Eagleswood, Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, and Bass River attended the former Tuckerton High School, which currently houses Tuckerton's elementary school. At first, the school only had two sports; boys' baseball and boys' basketball. Football was added in 1958, and wrestling came two years later. Girls had \\"Sports Nights\\" instead of competitive teams. It would not be until the 1960s when women's sports would first appear at Southern. Due to the quick growth of the area, a new wing and expanded gymnasium were added in 1966.The History of SRHS, Southern Regional School District. Accessed June 18, 2013. In 1970, Southern Regional Middle School opened its doors to 7th and 8th graders. However, it soon became overcrowded. Starting in 1979, students from Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Bass River, and Eagleswood, would attend the newly opened Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. At the same time, an expansion was built onto the middle school, all ninth graders were moved from the high school to the middle school. The high school went through several changes throughout the 1990s. In December 1991, maintenance crews installing a heating system sparked a fire that damaged the guidance area and several science labs, which were later remodeled.Cronin, Steven. \\"SRHS FIRE BLAMED ON TORCHES\\", The Press of Atlantic City, December 25, 1991.

At the same time, the middle school went back to housing the seventh and eighth graders. In 2004, Barnegat High School opened in Barnegat Township, starting with a freshman class and adding a class each school year. June 2007 marked Southern Regional's last graduating class with students from Barnegat. Barnegat High School became a full 9-12 high school in September 2007, ending its sending relationship. With nearly 80% of the district's tax levy coming from residents of Long Beach Island and its small school-age population, municipal officials in Beach Haven and Long Beach Township have considered studies to analyze a possible withdrawal from the district. As of 2016, the overwhelming majority of students are from Stafford Township, accounting for nearly 90% of enrollment. These demographic changes have led to significant discrepancies in the cost per pupil sent to the district from each community, with Harvey Cedars and Long Beach Township paying more than $200,000 per pupil, while Stafford Township's costs are $3,600 for each student. These widely different costs result from a formula that uses the taxable property value in each municipality to apportion costs, which means that municipalities with relatively high property values and small numbers of students pay a higher share of total district costs. Some residents of Long Beach Island communities are seeking to amend the formula to take advantage of a 1993 law that allows districts to use both property value and enrollment to allocate property taxes, that that would require passage of referendums in each municipality.

Earning his initial reputation during the Indian wars, he came to prominence for his service with the Rough Riders during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. His friendship with Theodore Roosevelt then led to Brodie being appointed Governor of Arizona Territory from 1902 to 1905. Background Alexander O.

Leslie (Watson & Annandale), Perth, 1915-1917 - Available Online His family originated in Northern Scotland and his branch of the Clan Brodie is known as Brodie of Caithness. Brodie was born to Joseph and Margaret (Brown) Brodie near Edwards, New York, in late 1849, the second of four children. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Brodie was 11 years old and asked his father to allow him to enlist. Brodie's father promised him that he would be sent to West Point when he was old enough.Watson, Charles B. Boog. Alexander Cowan of Moray House and Valleyfield (founder of A.

Leslie (Watson & Annandale), Perth, 1915-1917, p. 39 - Available Online By age 13 he was a student in a boarding school in Canton, New York operated by St. Lawrence University. Brodie received an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1866 and upon graduation was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry Regiment (United States) on June 15, 1870. As a newly commissioned officer, Brodie was assigned to Camp Apache, where he participated in General George Crook's campaign in Arizona Territory. During this assignment there were several events of note. On June 21, 1871, Brodie and a group of five troopers were ambushed by a numerically superior band of Apaches. The young lieutenant managed his group's ammunition supply over the course of an eight-hour fight, and returned safely to camp after nightfall. As result of his efforts that day, Brodie received a personal commendation from the Secretary of War. During another incident he and one other soldier pursued and captured a band of Apache that had escaped from the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. After finding the group, the band's leader threatened to kill Brodie. Brodie responding by shooting the chief. After seeing this exchange the rest of the band returned peacefully to the reservation. In August 1874, he was assigned to Fort Walla Walla, Washington where he participated in the campaign against Chief Joseph and his band of Nez Perce. Following this, Brodie served at Benicia Arsenal, California and Fort Colville, Washington before being promoted to first lieutenant on May 25, 1876. Around the time of his promotion, Brodie married Kate Reynolds of Walla Walla, Washington. His wife and newborn daughter died during childbirth in August or September 1877, and Brodie resigned his commission on September 30, 1877. After leaving the military, Brodie worked as a cattleman in Kansas and miner in Dakota Territory before enlisting in the U.S. Cavalry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri in August 1883. His enlistment returned him to Arizona Territory, where he was discharged in February 1884. Remaining in the territory, Brodie established a permanent residence in Prescott while working around the territory as a civil and mining engineer. From 1887 till 1890 he worked as superintendent and chief engineer of the Walnut Grove Dam Liggett, James A. ‚ÄúArizona‚Äôs Worst Disaster, The Hassayampa Story (1886‚Äì2009)‚Äù (Pathfinder Publishing), p.55 on the Hassayampa River north of Wickenburg. As the dam was nearing completion, in February 1890, a flood caused the dam to collapse, causing 70 deaths and millions of dollars in damage. Brodie himself was held innocent of wrongdoing in the failure as he had publicly called for higher construction standards on the project. In 1891, Brodie was appointed commander of the Arizona Territorial National Guard by Governor John N. Irwin, a position he held till May 1892. On December 15, 1892, Brodie married Mary Louise Hanlon. The second Mrs. Brodie was a survivor of the Walnut Grove Dam failure. A distant uncle, Henry Spingler van Beuren was the president of the company that built the dam. The couple had two sons, with the first dying in 1896 and the second being born in 1898. Politically, Brodie served as Yavapai County recorder from 1893 till 1895. and was the Republican nominee for Territorial delegate in 1898, when he returned to the territory as a war hero. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Staff of the 1st US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, the Rough Riders: From Left to right, Maj. George Dunn, Major Brodie, former Confederate Gen. Joseph Wheeler, Chaplain Brown of the Rough Riders, Col. Leonard Wood, and Lt. Col. Theodore Roosevelt. On March 3, 1898, with the outbreak of war between Spain and the United States appearing likely, Brodie sent telegraphs to President William McKinley and Governor Myron H. McCord seeking permission to raise a volunteer regiment of cavalry. With the start of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War the Rough Riders were formed and Arizona Territory allocated a quota of 170 men. Brodie was appointed as senior regimental officer at the rank of major on April 25, 1898. Following training in San Antonio, Texas, Brodie's unit was deployed to Cuba. On June 24, 1898, during the Battle of Las Guasimas, he was wounded by a bullet in his right wrist. Initially refusing to leave the battle, Major Brodie was eventually forced from the field by pain and blood loss. He was evacuated from Cuba and treated in the hospital at Fort Wadsworth, New York. After recovering from his wound, Brodie returned to the Rough Riders on August 11, 1898, and, being promoted to lieutenant colonel, succeeded Theodore Roosevelt as unit commander. Brodie himself mustered out on September 15, 1898, and returned to Arizona Territory to work as a mining engineer. Governorship Following the resignation of Oakes Murphy as Governor of Arizona Territory, Brodie was nominated for the position and sworn into office on July 1, 1902. His first several months were spent appointing new officials and organizing his administration. An action of note prior to the convening of the 22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature was the pardon of Pearl Hart on moral grounds. At the time, the outlaw was the only female at the Yuma Territorial Prison and her presence was causing disruptions as guards and other prisoners vied for her attentions. The December 1902 pardon was made on the condition that Hart leave the territory, a condition she quickly fulfilled. Another display of the new Governor's ethical stance was his refusal to use a US$750 discretionary fund which was available for his personal use. Brodie considered the legislative appropriation which created the fund illegal as it had no oversight provisions to prevent misuse. Arizona State Capitol Museum. With the start of the 22nd Legislature in January 1903, Brodie requested several changes to the territorial tax code. The first change he asked for was increasing the tax rates for mining operations which the Governor felt were not paying a fair share in comparison to other parts of the territorial economy. He also proposed an exemption from taxation of 10 years for new railroads and 9 years for hydroelectric dams to encourage additional transportation and electrical generation capabilities within the territory. Other changes to mining operations were the establishment of an eight-hour day for mine workers, with railroad workers receiving a limit of 16 consecutive hours of work, and outlawing the practice of paying miners in company scrip redeemable only at the company store. Brodie also requested the pay for the governor's secretary be increased from US$125 to US$150/year. Other legislation coming from the session were laws requiring the licensing of dentists and physicians, requiring schools to fly the United States flag during hours the school was in session, expanding the facilities of the territorial insane asylum, and authorizing school districts with 1,000 or more residents to hire music and art instructors. Brodie also took unpopular stances on two of the session's bills. The first stance was opposition to a bill granting women the right to vote. Brodie, who personally supported women's suffrage, opposed this bill on the basis that it was not permitted under the limitations of the Arizona Organic Act. The second unpopular stance was endorsing a bill supporting joint statehood with New Mexico. Between legislative sessions, Brodie was responsible for expanding the size of the Arizona Rangers from fourteen to twenty-six men. This was followed by him selecting the site for Roosevelt Dam. At the beginning of the 1905 legislative session, the Governor announced the results of a two-year study on possible joint statehood with New Mexico, finding the residents of Arizona strongly opposed such an action, and appealed to the legislature to oppose such a merger. After hearing the appeal the legislature memorandized the U.S. Congress expressing their opposition to joint statehood. Brodie's address to the session repeated his request to the previous session for tax reform. He also requested laws to deal with the \\"growing evil of wife desertion\\" and for creation of a sanatorium to treat the growing numbers of people suffering from tuberculosis migrating to the territory. Brodie announced his resignation as governor on February 14, 1905. As a token of their esteem the Democratically controlled legislature presented the Republican governor a ceremonial saber. After office Following his resignation as governor, Brodie returned to the U.S. Army at the rank of major. After serving briefly in the War Department's record and pension office, he was assigned to the Philippines serving on a board overseeing the Friar lands dispute. In 1907 he was made adjutant general of the Department of the Dakotas and in 1911 was transferred to the Department of California to perform the same job. Bordie was promoted to colonel in 1912 and retired from the military in 1913. Brodie moved to Haddonfield, New Jersey, where he settled at Greenfield Hall. Brodie died on May 10, 1918, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

A nakamal (a Bislama word from vernacular terms such as Raga gamali) is a traditional meeting place in Vanuatu. It is used for gatherings, ceremonies and the drinking of kava. A nakamal is found in every significant Vanuatu community, but the design of the nakamal and the traditions surrounding it vary between areas. Traditional nakamals In north and central Vanuatu, the nakamal generally takes the form of a large building, assembled from traditional materials with the help of the entire community, under the direction of a particular chief. Entry to the nakamal is often restricted to men, and the building may be used as a sleeping and living area for unmarried men and boys and for male visitors to the village. Significantly, most nakamals lack a lockable door, indicating that all friendly visitors are welcome, although there may be a low barrier across the entrance to keep out animals. In front of a nakamal there is often a flattened clearing, or nasara, used for dances and outdoor gatherings. In southern Vanuatu, a nakamal may be a large, sheltered outdoor space, such as under a banyan tree. In Vanuatu's capital Port Vila, the assembly building of the national council of chiefs (Malvatumauri) is designed in the form of a traditional nakamal. Nakamals as kava bars The nakamal's most prominent function nowadays is as a place for the preparation and drinking of kava. In urban Vanuatu, and in neighbouring New Caledonia, the term nakamal may be used for a kava bar where the drink is sold, although in rural Vanuatu a traditional nakamal (where kava preparation is a communal activity and money does not usually change hands) is distinct from a kava bar.

The Liu Seong system was brought to America, from Indonesia, by Willem A. Reeders (1917-1990). Willem Reeders was of mixed heritage, being of Dutch and Chinese background, but raised in Indonesia. He received training in a variety of martial arts, no one knows how many exactly. His primary teacher was his great uncle Liu Seong, whose title he bore. His uncle taught him his family's Kuntao system, a sophisticated form of fighting which focuses on close range technique. Reeders also studied many silat systems, having over ten silat teachers. His silat styles included Tjikalong (Cikalong), Tjimande (Cimande), Harimau, and Serak, among others. Reeders was an extremely accomplished martial artist who was able to tie many focal elements of various arts together into a cohesive whole. The result is an art that although bearing many similarities to many well known arts still retains a distinctive identity with its own signature movements, strategies, and tactics. It is based firmly in an objective approach, based on the principles of physics, anatomy, and psychology. The patterns of movement are designed to be extremely effective and one hallmark is the ability to throw a large volume of attacks very rapidly. Today, Reeder's Kuntao / Liu Seong Gung Fu is thinly spread throughout the United States, with instructors offering variations of the art in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Tennessee, Toronto, and Virginia. Combination of styles Many styles that are the result of combining different methods are often termed \\"eclectic\\" and often are lacking a core, instead relying upon the continual addition of new strategies, tactics, and techniques. The Liu Seong system although hybridized is not at all \\"eclectic\\", and the basic movements are also the advanced. Understandings and applications change, but the essential system does not. This allows for a much greater depth in the development of skill owing to the continual refinement of a base that does not inherently change, but instead becomes more advanced. There are various view points espoused by martial artists about the nature of systems and their development. One view is that although a style may be a hybrid or combination, eventually it develops its own identity and is no longer considered to be 'mixed'. Another view is that all martial arts are indeed hybrids and are the result of a continual process of synthesis and refinement, and any given art in a generational span is, in fact, a 'phase' of its development. Another extremely valid point of view upon differing martial styles is they are more accurately identified as cultural/social representations. Karate is Okinawan or Japanese, gungfu is Chinese, and so on. Each culture tends to focus on a different approach to the fighting arts, according to their mores. In one sense, the 'real' difference in arts, beyond cultural distinctions, lies in the strategies and tactics employed. The Liu Seong system is culturally derived from the arts of China and Indonesia, and accordingly has tactical elements of both. The adopted cultural aspects, primarily school etiquette, may vary between Chinese and Indonesian terminology and practices, and may even include elements of both. There is an axiom that states that for a system to be valid it must be based upon a greater system. Beyond the consideration of historical and cultural elements, what defines the Liu Seong system is a core of operation that is firmly rooted in the principles of physics, psychology and anatomy. This orientation is what allows the art to weave together two disparate cultural elements and blend differing strategies together into one whole, and in the end, define itself. It is a true synthesis. Chinese hands and Indonesian feet Being a synthesis, it has many tactics to draw upon. One basic recognition of this is found in the expression, Chinese hands and Indonesian feet. This refers to the basic combination of Chinese-style (neijia) biomechanics and Indonesian style footwork patterns. The China Hand component teaches good body alignment for power. Indonesian Feet teaches mobility and positioning through the use of footwork 'patterns'. Because it is greatly influenced by silat, the Liu Seong System is what is known as 'blade aware', and this is reflected in many elements of the posture. Although weapons are rarely used in practice, except in advanced training, movements are made 'as if' the opponent was wielding a knife, stick, or one of other numerous weapons. Gun defense techniques do exist within the context of the system, in order to address this modern concern. The postures used tend to protect most major vital areas and this protection is maintained at all times. This method is known as 'closed body' movement. The closed body movement also has the effect of 'winding up' the practitioner's arms and legs so that he can strike out quickly and 'close up' again so as not to unnecessarily expose the vitals to attack. The guard shape and techniques used in this 'closed body' system are very distinctive and tend to constitute the 'signature' of the system. In great part this 'closed' condition is maintained by the continual position of the back hand in a guard position. Whenever the basic guard posture is changed or a strike is thrown the backup will be in a 'guardian' position. Often, it is taken to be a form of Pakuachang, although seemingly more angular in nature. Many are of the impression that kuntao and Pakuachang are either the same or highly related. Others cite parallel evolution. Given Reeders' history and circumstance, it is entirely likely he knew both arts. Despite the origin, known or not, in the Liu Seong system there is an inherent use of angulation that tends to be very advantageous in a combat situation, coupled with continuous non-stop entry and penetration. The art doesn't, however, 'go around' to someone to strike, it 'goes to' the target with the use of angles to avoid the opponent's attack. There are a large volume of counter-attack techniques in the system. Counter- time or interceptive techniques are also prevalent. The kuntaoer is extremely difficult to strike because he or she will not be where expected and the kuntaoer does not react to an opponent's strike. By the time an opponent has begun his or her movement, the kuntaoer will have realized it and will have already struck the opponent, occasionally multiple times. These are a few of the basic characteristics of the system which is a unique combination of the Chinese and Indonesian elements from which is it created. Standardization and diversity There is no standardized curriculum, nor is there a central organization to represent the art, to which all chapters subscribe. Each school has its own individualized program of training. Despite the variety of expression found in the art, and the independent nature of the schools, there are more similarities than differences, and often it takes one who is familiar with the system to identify the difference in methods, as they are, in most cases, quite subtle. Experts in the system can often identify who a student trains with just by watching them move. This is due in great part to the fact the many of Reeder's original (first generation American) students are, for the most part, alive and well and heading up their respective chapters. Therefore, their students have a strong model to emulate, and their teacher's 'style' shows in their forms and applications. The range of these arts is also shown in a wide array of forms (kata, quan, etc.) that are practiced. Different lines of the art have different sets of forms. These forms are often deconstructed and made into smaller patterns of movement for ease of learning and for children's programs, as well as being rearranged in different sequences. These are the individualized training tools developed by different instructors. Additionally, some chapters have assimilated forms from other sources into the Liu Seong system or teach it in concert with other methods. Fundamental strategies, tactics, and techniques The origin of many tactics and techniques in the system is unknown. Speculation of where a particular tactic comes from, in terms of root style, is often a point of discussion amongst practitioners. Because of the hybrid nature of the art, many techniques taken from other arts may very well have been transformed by its absorption in the system to the extent that they no longer resemble their parent art. It is often stated by those that knew Willem Reeders, that he was primarily concerned with the technique applications and fighting tactics of the arts that he studied, not with ritual elements, like forms, or juru-juru (prearranged sequences of movement). This fact plays out in the many different methods of engagement that can be found within the system. Due to this variety, the art cannot be rigorously classified. The common thread found running through all the schools are the principles of operation. Although Liu Seong encompasses many techniques, its true definition is found in the tactical transitions of the distinctive postures of the style, and the syncopated rhythm of attack which are used to enter, strike and achieve a wide variety of locking and throwing techniques, culminating in finishing attacks upon the downed opponent. =Strategy= Liu Seong is not an art of self- defense, and not meant for sport competition. Reeder's Kuntao is an extreme art of close-quarters combat. Practitioners spar at less than full speed and strength, and many attacks are not used due to their inherently dangerous nature. This concession is considered a necessity in order to prevent injury to the students. The Liu Seong system, in great part, has not undergone modernization, as have many other disciplines. Willem Reeders' system of martial arts relies heavily on explosive movement. All strikes and movements must be performed explosively to cause maximum damage and minimize any advantage an opponent may have. Because of the explosive, continuous and fluid movement of the kuntaoer, if an opponent is not incapacitated by the first or second strike, the opponent will often be reacting to strikes that have already been delivered. An opponent may be up to five or six strikes behind. Reeder's Kuntao still retains its old school combat orientation with techniques that are designed to seriously injure or kill an attacker. The essential premise of the art is that for self-defense to be adequate it must take into account the worst possible scenario in which you could find yourself, in a fighting context. Accordingly, this would be having to face multiple, armed attackers who are versed in the martial arts as well. This assumption lays the theoretical basis for the art. The Liu Seong system is a 'blade aware' or weapons based system which is generally trained without weaponry. Weapons are added to the training at advanced levels as an extension of the hand technique which is considered paramount. This is a departure from the method of many other styles of weapons combat which begin training with weapons first and take up 'empty hand' methods after basic baton, knife, or staff skills have been learned.

It was initially developed to predict mortality within three months of surgery in patients who had undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure, and was subsequently found to be useful in determining prognosis and prioritizing for receipt of a liver transplant. This score is now used by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) and Eurotransplant for prioritizing allocation of liver transplants instead of the older Child-Pugh score. Determination MELD uses the patient's values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for prothrombin time (INR) to predict survival. It is calculated according to the following formula: :MELD = 3.78√óln[serum bilirubin (mg/dL)] + 11.2√óln[INR] + 9.57√óln[serum creatinine (mg/dL)] + 6.43 MELD scores are reported as whole numbers, so the result of the equation above is rounded. UNOS has made the following modifications to the score: * If the patient has been dialyzed twice within the last 7 days, then the value for serum creatinine used should be 4.0 mg/dL * Any value less than one is given a value of 1 (i.e. if bilirubin is 0.8 a value of 1.0 is used) to prevent subtraction from any of the three factors, since the natural logarithm of a positive number below 1 (greater than 0 and less than 1) yields a negative value. The etiology of liver disease was subsequently removed from the model because it posed difficulties such as how to categorize patients with multiple causes of liver disease. Modification of the MELD score by excluding etiology of liver disease did not significantly affect the model's accuracy in predicting three-month survival. Patients with a diagnosis of liver cancer will be assigned a MELD score based on how advanced the cancer is. Interpretation In interpreting the MELD Score in hospitalized patients, the 3 month observed mortality (considering adult liver transplant candidates with chronic liver disease who were added to the OPTN waiting list at 2A or 2B status between November, 1999, and December, 2001) is: * 40 or more ‚Äî 71.3% observed mortality * 30‚Äì39 ‚Äî 52.6% observed mortality * 20‚Äì29 ‚Äî 19.6% observed mortality * 10‚Äì19 ‚Äî 6.0% observed mortality * <9 ‚Äî 1.9% observed mortality Applications of MELD score: * The best outcomes with TIPS occur among patients with a MELD score less than 14. * Patients with MELD scores greater than 24 who are reasonable liver transplant candidates are probably best served by foregoing TIPS placement. History MELD was originally developed at the Mayo Clinic by Dr. Patrick Kamath, and at that point was called the \\"Mayo End- stage Liver Disease\\" score. It was derived in a series of patients undergoing TIPS procedures. The original version also included a variable based on the underlying etiology (cause) of the liver disease. The score turned out to be predictive of prognosis in chronic liver disease in general, and‚Äìwith some modifications‚Äìcame to be applied as an objective tool in assigning need for a liver transplant. The etiology turned out to be relatively unimportant, and was also regarded as relatively subjective; it was therefore removed from the score.

Christy Walton took her husband John's place in the ranking after his death. The majority of the family's wealth derives from the heritage of Bud and Sam Walton, who were the co-founders of Walmart. Walmart is the world's largest retailer, one of the world's largest business enterprises in terms of annual revenue, and, with just over 2.2 million employees, the world's largest private employer. , the Waltons collectively owned 50.8 percent of Walmart. In 2018, the family sold some of their company's stock and now owns just under 50%. In July 2020, the annual Sunday Times Rich List reported that the Walton family's net worth was $US225.2 billion.  Walton Family Foundation  In 1987, Sam Walton endowed a charitable foundation. The Walton Family Foundation was primarily focused on charter schools, but it later extended its program to include environmental issues, particularly those related to water. In 2016, Alice and Jim Walton put a $250 million grant towards building charter school facilities, in honor of their parents' commitment to providing high-quality education. The Walton Family Foundation created the Building Equity Initiative to provide charter schools with access to capital to create and expand their facilities. This initiative was established after the foundation announced in 2016 that it would spend $1 billion over the next five years to expand \\"educational opportunity\\" by partnering with charter school operators, researchers, and education reformers.

Naval battle Surprisingly for a village on land, Jemimaville is also the site of one of the lesser-known naval battles. The Battle of Jemimaville occurred on 26 October 1914, when the village was accidentally shelled by the battlecruisers and . These British warships had been warned of German submarine activity in the Cromarty Firth, and fired shells at shapes that were suspected to be the surfacing U-boat, but were more likely to be an innocent dolphin or wave.

He was Lord Chancellor of England under King Edward III starting from 1349. Life John is said to have been the son of Hugh of Thoresby, Lord of the Manor of the hamlet of Thoresby, Wensleydale, Yorkshire, England, but it is more likely that he was born in Lincolnshire. John was, for a while, the King's proctor in the Court of Rome. In 1341, he became Master of the Rolls, an office he held till 1346. In 1345 he was given custody of the privy seal, becoming Lord Privy Seal, and held that office until 1347.Fryde, et al.

Handbook of British Chronology p. 282 as of his own right, refusing to recognise the election of the Chapter. In 1355, John was a Warden of the Cinque Ports and a regent of the kingdom during Edward III's absence. He resigned the Great Seal in 1356 and thereafter devoted himself to the care of the northern province. York was not, at this time, in a satisfactory condition. The highest offices in York Minster had been, since the commencement of the fourteenth century, in the hands of the Roman Cardinals, who were, of course, non-resident. The deanery was held by them between 1343 and 1385. Order and discipline were consequently lacking both in the church and the rest of the diocese. He was created cardinal priest of S. Sabina in the consistory of 17 September 1361.Chac√≥n Vitae col. 544 John set himself to remedy these problems as best he might. He had drawn up, in the form of a catechism, a brief statement of what he deemed to be necessary for salvation, comprising the articles of belief, the Ten Commandments, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Deeds of Bodily and Ghostly Mercy, the Seven Virtues and the Seven Deadly Sins. The catechism was drawn up in Latin, for use of the clergy, and in rude English verse, translated from the Latin by John of Tavistock, a Benedictine of St. Mary's Abbey, York. Both Latin and English versions were issued from Cawood Palace in November 1373. The great differences between the sees of York and Canterbury were settled during John's time as archbishop. It was arranged that each primate should carry his cross erect in the province of the other; but, as an acknowledgement of this concession, Thoresby, within the space of two months, and each of his successors within the same period after his election, was to send a knight or a doctor of laws to offer in his name, at the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury, an image of gold to the value of ¬£40, in the fashion of an archbishop holding a cross or some other jewel. It was at this time also, that Pope Innocent VI made, in Fuller's words, \\"a new distinction ‚Äì primate of All England, and Primate of England: giving the former to Canterbury and the latter to York. Thus, when two children cry for the same apple, the indulgent father divides it betwixt them. Yet so that he giveth the bigger and better part to the childe that is his darling.\\" The archbishop undertook much building work at York Minster. He was buried before the altar of the Virgin in the Lady Chapel, the \\"novum opus chori\\" which he had constructed. During Thoresby's archiepiscopate, Walter Skirlaugh, afterwards Bishop of Durham, was his private chaplain and William of Wykeham was a prebendary of York. It is possible that both Skirlaugh and Wykeham, widely seen as two of the greatest builders of the age, may have been greatly influenced by the works undertaken in the Minster by Archbishop Thoresby. John died at Cawood, Yorkshire, on 6 November 1373.

In the late 1900s, she became best-selling author.  Biography  She was born on 9 April 1865 at Stoke Bishop, Gloucestershire, the second of three daughters to Colonel Arthur Cory and Fanny Elizabeth Griffin. Her father was employed in the British army at Lahore, and thus she was brought up by her relatives back in England. She left for India in 1881 to join her father. Her father was editor of the Lahore arm of The Civil and Military Gazette, and it was he who in all probability gave Rudyard Kipling (a contemporary of his daughter) his first employment as a journalist. Her sisters Annie Sophie Cory and Isabel Cory also pursued writing careers: Annie wrote popular, racy novels under the pseudonym \\"Victoria Cross,\\" while Isabel assisted and then succeeded their father as editor of the Sind Gazette. Adela married Colonel Malcolm Hassels Nicolson, who was then twice her age and commandant of the 3rd Battalion, the Baluch Regiment in April 1889. He had apparently gained a reputation for daring do, once crossing the Mango Pir River by hopping from one crocodile's back to another. A talented linguist, he introduced her to his love of India and native customs and food, which she began to share. This widely gave the couple a reputation for being eccentric. On the Zhob Valley expedition of 1890 she followed her husband through the passes of the Afghan border disguised as a Pathan boy. They lived in Mhow from 1895 until early 1900. After he died in a prostate operation, Adela, who had been prone to depression since childhood, committed suicide by poisoning herself and died at the age of 39 on 4 October 1904 in Madras. Her son Malcolm published her Selected Poems posthumously in 1922. Writing One of Byam Shaw's illustrations for the 1914 deluxe edition of The Garden of Kama In 1901, she published Garden of Kama, which was published a year later in America under the title India's Love Lyrics. She attempted to pass these off as translations of various poets, but this claim soon fell under suspicion. Her poems often used imagery and symbols from the poets of the North-West Frontier of India and the Sufi poets of Persia. She was among the most popular romantic poets of the Edwardian era. Her poems are typically about unrequited love and loss and often, the death that followed such an unhappy state of affairs. Many of them have an air of autobiography or confession. Details on her life are not easy to find due to her relative lack of letters, but Lesley Blanch, in her book Under A Lilac-Bleeding Star, included some biographical information that drew on unpublished memoirs written by her son. In Diaries and Letters from India, Violet Jacob provided some information about the Nicolsons and their milieu, although most of what is known of Violet, as she came to be known, had to be gleaned through her poetry. Despite Nicolson's use of pseudonyms and fictionalised characters, it was apparent to some of her contemporaries that her poems were deeply personal, even confessional. The \\"Dedication to Malcom Nicolson\\" that prefaces her last collection, written shortly before her suicide, provides an ambiguous disclaimer regarding the autobiographical origins of her poetry: > I, who of lighter love wrote many a verse, > Made public never words inspired by thee, > Lest strangers' lips should carelessly rehearse > Things that were sacred and too dear to me. Thy soul was noble; through > these fifteen years > Mine eyes familiar, found no fleck nor flaw, > Stern to thyself, thy comrades' faults and fears > Proved generosity thine only law. Small joy was I to thee; before we met > Sorrow had left thee all too sad to save. > Useless my love----as vain as this regret > That pours my hopeless life across thy grave. > > Popular culture adaptations Advertisement for Pickford's film * The life and poetry of Adela Nicolson have inspired a wide range of adaptations, beginning with British composer Amy Woodforde-Finden's musical settings of four of the lyrics from The Garden of Kama to music. The most popular of these was Kashmiri Song. After the songs proved a critical success, Woodforde-Finden added four settings of lyrics from Nicolson's 1903 book Stars of the Desert. African-American composer Harry Burleigh published Five Songs of Laurence Hope in 1915. * The Mary Pickford film Less Than the Dust (1916) was ostensibly inspired by the poem and song of the same title. Stoll Pictures released a film entitled The Indian Love Lyrics in 1923. * Fictional literary works based on Nicolson's life or poetry include Somerset Maugham's The Colonel's Lady (Creatures of Circumstance, 1947). This was also adapted into a segment of the film Quartet (1948). Later fictional works include Mary Talbot Cross's Fate Knows no Tears (1996) and Tim Orchard's That Bloody Female Poet (a book before Google) (2011). * In the 1910s and 1920s, dances based on The Garden of Kama were created and performed by Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, Martha Graham and Michio Ito.

Glufosinate is a non-selective, contact herbicide, with some systemic action. Plants may also metabolize bialaphos, another naturally occurring herbicide, directly into glufosinate. The compound irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, an enzyme necessary for the production of glutamine and for ammonia detoxification, giving it antibacterial, antifungal and herbicidal properties. Application of glufosinate to plants leads to reduced glutamine and elevated ammonia levels in tissues, halting photosynthesis and resulting in plant death. Discovery In the 1960s and early 1970s, scientists at University of T√ºbingen and at the Meiji Seika Kaisha Company independently discovered that species of Streptomyces bacteria produce a tripeptide they called bialaphos that inhibits bacteria; it consists of two alanine residues and a unique amino acid that is an analog of glutamate that they named \\"phosphinothricin\\". They determined that phosphinothricin irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase. Phosphinothricin was first synthesized by scientists at Hoechst in the 1970s as a racemic mixture; this racemic mixture is called glufosinate and is the commercially relevant version of the chemical.Donn, G and K√∂cher, H. Inhibitors of Glutamine Synthetase. Chapter 4 in Herbicide Classes in Development: Mode of Action, Targets, Genetic Engineering, Chemistry. Eds Peter B√∂ger, Ko Wakabayashi, Kenji Hirai. Springer Science & Business Media, 2012 In the late 1980s scientists discovered enzymes in these Streptomyces species that selectively inactivate free phosphinothricin; the gene encoding the enzyme that was isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus was called the \\"bialaphos resistance\\" or \\"bar\\" gene, and the gene encoding the enzyme in Streptomyces viridochromeogenes was called \\"phosphinothricin acetyltransferase\\" or \\"pat\\". The two genes and their proteins have 80% homology on the DNA level and 86% amino acid homology, and are each 158 amino acids long. Use Glufosinate is a broad-spectrum herbicide that is used to control important weeds such as morning glories, hemp sesbania (Sesbania bispinosa), Pennsylvania smartweed (Polygonum pensylvanicum) and yellow nutsedge similar to glyphosate. It is applied to young plants during early development for full effectiveness. It is sold in formulations under brands including Basta, Rely, Finale, Challenge and Liberty. Glufosinate is typically used in three situations as an herbicide: *directed sprays for weed control, including in genetically modified crops *use as a crop desiccation to facilitate harvesting A crop sprayer Glufosinate also has shown to provide some protection against various plant diseases, as it also acts to kill fungi and bacteria on contact.Duke, SO. Biotechnology: Herbicide Resistant Crops. In Encyclopedia of Agriculture and Food Systems, 2nd edition. Ed. Neal K. Van Alfen. Elsevier, 2014. . Page 97 =Genetically modified crops= Genetically modified crops resistant to glufosinate were created by genetically engineering the bar or pat genes from streptomyces into the relevant crop seeds. In 1995 the first glufosinate-resistant crop, canola, was brought to market, and it was followed by corn in 1997, cotton in 2004, and soybeans in 2011.Green JM and Castle LA. Transitioning from Single to Multiple Herbicide- resistant Crops. Chapter 4 in Glyphosate Resistance in Crops and Weeds: History, Development, and Management. Editor, Vijay K. Nandula. John Wiley & Sons, 2010 Page 112 Mode of action Phosphinothricin is a glutamine synthetase inhibitor that binds to the glutamate site. Glufosinate-treated plants die due to a buildup of ammonia in the thylakoid lumen, leading to the uncoupling of photophosphorylation. The uncoupling of photophosphorylation causes the production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and membrane destruction.Summary of Herbicide Mechanism of Action, HRAC and WSSA Elevated levels of ammonia are detectable within one hour after application of phosphinothricin. Toxicity =Exposure to humans in foods= As glufosinate is often used as a pre-harvest desiccant, residues can also be found in foods that humans ingest. Such foods include potatoes, peas, beans, corn, wheat, and barley. In addition, the chemical can be passed to humans through animals who are fed contaminated straw. Flour processed from wheat grain that contained traces of glufosinate was found to retain 10-100% of the chemicals' residues. The herbicide is also persistent; it has been found to be prevalent in spinach, radishes, wheat and carrots that were planted 120 days after the treatment of the herbicide. Its persistent nature can also be observed by its half-life which varies from 3 to 70 days depending on the soil type and organic matter content. Residues can remain in frozen food for up to two years and the chemical is not easily destroyed by cooking the food item in boiling water. The EPA classifies the chemical as 'persistent' and 'mobile' based on its lack of degradation and ease of transport through soil.

Letters patent of Christoph Beetz von Beetzen According to the letters patent of January 27, 1734, now in the √ñsterreichisches Staatsarchiv in Vienna, the nobility and the title Knight of the Holy Roman Empire (Reichsritter) is inherited by \\"all his present and future legitimate posterity, and their heirs' heirs, men and women in descending line, in infinity\\" (). According to Codex Austriacus (ed. Herrenleben, S.G., Wien 1748, pars III, Suppl. I, 1720, page 953, 954) both daughters and sons inherited in Austria after 1720, so the reference \\"all his present and future legitimate posterity, and their heirs' heirs\\" refer, according to Austrian law at the time, to both men and women when the letters patent was issued in 1734. This was also understood and underlined by the addition \\"men and women in descending line in infinity\\". This pattern for hereditary nobility is called 'cognatic succession'. The claim that the noble rank could sometimes be inherited cognatically is not undisputed; according to another view all noble titles are inherited agnatically. According to this view, the true meaning of \\"all his present and future legitimate posterity, and their heirs' heirs, men and women in descending line, in infinity\\" refer only to men. This statement is understood as a standard formulation in all letters patent - it is not unique for the family von Beezen. The noble daughters married into other families and their children inherited the title belonging to their father. According to this view no one inherits a title from both the mother and the father in European culture. The Coat of Arms for the 'von Beezen' - family However, this view is contradicted by the fact that there are many undisputed examples of cognatic succession for both male and female descendants, as in the letters patent of nobility issued by Charles VII in December 1429 to Jeanne d'Arc and all her family's descendants, as well as the title Baron (or Count) Arundell of Wardour according to the letters patent issued by Rudolf II in Prague December 14, 1595 for Thomas Arundell and all his descendants, men as well as women. The more common pattern for hereditary nobility, when only men can forward nobility to their children, is called agnatic succession. Family from Germany, Sweden, Norway, etc. Christoph Beetz‚Äô parents and grandparents are said to have been employees of the Emperor. Due to the family name, the family may perhaps have come from a district called ‚ÄòBeetzendorf ‚Äô south of Berlin and can perhaps be related to the Beetzendorf Castle . But this is nevertheless very long ago, for instance at the 1300 century, due to a check about the ownership at Beetzendorf Castle. Some of his relatives held office in the Swedish state. According to an unconfirmed Swedish family tradition Christoph Beetz' family originally should have come from Russia (or Poland). Christoph Beetz was one of the very famous from the Beetz family. He was married to Anna Sofia from Germany and had two sons, Johan Henrik von Beetzen (born in Stralsund about 1698) and Karl Joakim von Beetzen (born in Stralsund, November 1698). Karl Joakim was married to Anna Helena Giers (born 12 January 1707 in G√∂teborg) from the famous Giers family from Sweden that also has a famous Russian branch related to the named Russian Foreign Minister for about 13 years, Nikolai Giers Nicholas de Giers, and a known English branch. The Beetzen family is today mostly known from Sweden, but there are also for instance Norwegian and German descendants. Knights through centuries Christoph von Beezen's ancestors included nobles and knights. It was on this basis that the noble letter was accepted for the higher nobility. The emperor and the king based their power from the old days on rich landowners who were able to develop a military army. This can be read about at the Teutonic Knights. In Christoph von Beezen's noble letter his properties are mentioned, and the coat of arms could be used in this context.

Throughout its existence, the band mainly consisted of Damon Locks (vocals/percussion), Chris DeZutter (guitar), Wayne Montana (bass), and Fred Armisen (drums). Biography The band was founded in 1988 after Armisen dropped out of the School of Visual Arts and moved from New York to Chicago. As a five-piece with two guitarists, the band released their debut EP, \\"Snakebite,\\" in 1989. After releasing two studio albums, Construction of New Action and Inside The Future, they released a third LP, Trenchmouth vs. The Light of the Sun, on East West Records, a division of Elektra Records. The band broke up after releasing their final album, The Broadcasting System, in 1996. Armisen went on to be a cast member of Saturday Night Live. Locks went on to be in Super ESP and later reconvened with Montana to form The Eternals.

Life and career He was born and studied in Turin. Corrado Segre, his uncle, also served as his doctoral advisor. Among his main contributions to algebraic geometry are studies of birational invariants of algebraic varieties, singularities and algebraic surfaces. His work was in the style of the old Italian School, although he also appreciated the greater rigour of modern algebraic geometry. Segre was a pioneer in finite geometry, in particular projective geometry based on vector spaces over a finite field. In a well-known paper he proved the following theorem: In a Desarguesian plane of odd order, the ovals are exactly the irreducible conics. In 1959 he authored a survey \\"Le geometrie di Galois\\" on Galois geometry.B. Segre (1959) \\"Le geometrie di Galois\\", Annali di Matematica Pura ed Applicata 48: 1‚Äì97. According to J. W. P.

According to Hirschfeld, \\"He published the most as well as the deepest papers in the subject. His enormous knowledge of classical algebraic geometry enabled him to identify those results which could be applied to finite spaces.

The options were bought in the name of Mark Booth and cost about $90,000. After the takeover bid they were worth over $2 million. Hannes vehemently denied he was this Booth, or that he had inside information anyway. The prosecution had good indirect evidence of both, which the jury accepted at an initial trial and again at a retrial ordered on appeal. Hannes was also convicted of offences under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (FTR) relating to the way he had split cash transactions at multiple bank branches to stay under the AUSTRAC reporting threshold of $10,000. Hannes sentence at the trial in 1999 was 2 years and 2 months imprisonment and $110,000 fines. He served 15¬Ω months of an 18-month non-parole period before granted the retrial. At the retrial in 2002 the sentence was 2 years 6 months and $100,000 fines, with a non-parole period of 20 months, making a further 4¬Ω months to serve. Inside information TNT (now part of PostNL) was an Australian transport and logistics company with significant operations in Europe. It was a client of investment bank Macquarie Bank and in May 1996 TNT and their Macquarie advisors, from the Corporate Advisory Division of Macquarie Corporate Finance (MCF), had a meeting in Hong Kong with Royal PTT Nederland NV (KPN), the Dutch postal service, concerning a possible friendly takeover of TNT by KPN. Back in Sydney, the Macquarie advisors put together what they called \\"project Tennis\\", and those in this \\"Tennis team\\" were to keep the project confidential. Hannes was an executive director of MCF, but not in the team, and so did not know directly of the proposed transaction. But he became aware something was happening, since in July 1996, * One of his junior staff, Murdoch, was working on a valuation of TNT, which Murdoch told Hannes would be between $2.20 and $3.20 (which Hannes thought rather high). * At a board meeting which Hannes attended, the subject of project Tennis came up, though the board was told only it concerned a major restructure of TNT. * At a company conference in Mount Buller a slide referred to project Tennis and a possible fee of $5 to $10 million for Macquarie. From 1 August 1996 Hannes took permanent leave from the bank, but kept keys to the MCF offices, since he would still be doing work for at least one client. Before and after taking leave, Hannes made a number of late night visits; the prosecution alleged that on those occasions he looked at the work of project Tennis. On 2 September 1996 TNT announced it has made an agreement, with certain conditions, to sell its stake in Air New Zealand to Ansett Transport Industries. One of the things the prosecution alleged Hannes learnt from project Tennis was that KPN wasn't interested in TNT's shares in Air New Zealand, and that the prospect of a takeover would be greatly increased if TNT could sell them. It seemed that with this impediment removed Hannes took action, two days later. Insider trading On 4 September 1996, Hannes transferred $200,000 from his Leveraged Equities account at stock broker Ord Minnett to a bank account in his name at the Commonwealth Bank (CBA). On 5 September 1996, one \\"Mark Booth\\" rented a mailbox at Mail Boxes Etc in Mosman, subsequently used for correspondence and grandly called \\"Suite 140, 656 Military Road\\". In the later trial, the court accepted the prosecution's allegation that this Booth was Hannes and everything done as Booth was done by Hannes. For the description below the distinction will be preserved, to show where the identification could (or could not) be made. The name \\"M. Booth\\" was apparently from Hannes' sister Mignon Booth (her married name). Hannes said in a police interview about one of the bank cheque applications \\"M. Booth\\" that it was to have been \\"in the name of my sister.\\" But there was no suggestion his sister was involved in any way. On 6 September 1996, Hannes withdrew cash of $10,000, $10,000 and $20,000 from his CBA account, each withdrawal at a different branch. All were over the AUSTRAC cash transactions reporting threshold. The first two were reported electronically, without Hannes' knowledge. At the third branch it was done manually on a form the teller asked Hannes to sign. It seemed only at that point did he learn of that rule. That same day \\"Booth\\" obtained a bank cheque for $9,000, paid with cash, for stock brokers Ord Minnett and deposited with them. It seemed money that had started at Ord Minnett was going back there, under a different name. On 9 September 1996, Hannes made further cash withdrawals from his CBA account, this time $9,900, $6000, and four of $9,000, again each from a different branch. This brought the total withdrawn to $91,900. That same day Booth obtained nine bank cheques, paid with cash, for Ord Minnett and deposited there. Those cheques were obtained all at different bank branches, of the CBA, NAB, ANZ and Westpac. Some of those branches were just metres away from each other. There were eight cheques of $9,000 and one of $9,900. This brought the total deposited to $90,900. On 17 September 1996, Booth phoned Ord Minnet and spoke to stockbroker Andrew Staehli. Booth identified himself as a marketing consultant from the UK staying at the InterContinental Hotel. (The hotel later gave evidence they'd had no guest of that name.) Booth got a quote for TNT call options expiring November with a strike price of $2.00. The quote was between 1c and 2c per share, since TNT was then trading for just under $1.60 and there was only 2 months to expiry. Staehli advised this would be a risky trade and required written instructions, plus the usual options client agreement and CHESS sponsorship agreement. Booth arranged to pick up those documents in person from the Ord Minnett office. On the morning of 18 September 1996 the completed documents were on Staehli's desk. Booth had come to the office, but Staehli never met him in person (and therefore could not subsequently identify him). The options agreement was witnessed by one \\"Alexi Voltraint\\" of 52 Railway Rd, Petersham. It later turned out there was no such person, but at number 51 was Patricia Myers whom Hannes had met at a book club meeting that month. Booth's written instruction was to buy November $2.00 TNT call options for up to 2c each, as many as could be had (including brokerage expense) for the money on account. Staehli did this that day the 18th and then the 19th at prices of 1.5c or 2c per share, totalling about 5,000 options contracts (on 1,000 shares each). On 19 September 1996 Booth opened a voicemail service at Voicemail National in Surry Hills. He phoned Staehli to give him that number, and Staehli advised the options had been bought and $1,500 remained in the account. It apparently annoyed Booth that not all the money had been applied. On 2 October 1996 KPN announced its takeover bid, for $2.45 per share. This was generally regarded as rather high at the time, some commentators even suggested the Dutch had miscalculated the exchange rate or something, but the TNT business in Europe was highly desirable for them and the bid had the backing of the TNT board. Staehli talked to Booth that afternoon, telling him he'd become a millionaire. The options were now worth roughly the difference between the strike $2.00 and the bid $2.45, an amount over $2 million. On 3 October 1996 Staehli received a letter from Booth instructing him to hold the position until 4 November 1996 in case a rival bidder made a higher offer, then sell. Investigation Not surprisingly, this big win immediately raised suspicions at the exchange and the following day (the 3rd) the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) began an investigation. On 4 October 1996 the ASC got a court order freezing the account. The options were still sold per Booth's instructions, for a total $2,039,710, but that amount was held in the account. In November 1996 Booth faxed instructions to Staehli directing the firm to pay monies under the direction of the ASC so the investors he had bought from wouldn't suffer losses. Maybe Hannes realised he was in trouble and hoped to extricate himself. In any case such payments were in fact made, with the writers of the options compensated. The ASC investigated many people from Macquarie, TNT and KPN who might have been Booth, using good old-fashioned perseverance. They also used NetMap software developed by NetMap Analytics. NetMap was designed to look at large data sets for unusual links between people or groups in their communications or financial dealings, to identify possible wrongdoing. After a three-week run it proposed several people, of whom Hannes was one. On 17 January 1997 a search warrant was executed at Hannes home and documents, his computer, an anorak, a black bag and glasses were seized. The anorak and bag were similar to ones in bank security tapes from when Booth obtained bank cheques. In a voluntary police/ASC interview that day Hannes asserted the options had been bought without his authority, by a person he did not wish to name but with whom he had formed an investment syndicate. This person was known as Mr X. Prosecution The ASC charged Hannes, #Under the corporations act, for insider trading in the options purchase (as Booth). #Under the FTR act, for splitting the cash withdrawals (in his own name). #Under the FTR act, for splitting the cash used for bank cheques (as Booth). The trial in the District Court of New South Wales was long and complex. The prosecution called 42 witnesses and 3 expert witnesses and offered 200 exhibits. Justice Backhouse's summing up took four days. The identification of Hannes as Booth relied on witnesses from the banks, Mail Boxes Etc, and handwriting analysis from documents by Booth and indentations on paper found at Hannes home. Among those indentations was a page of apparent practice signatures \\"M. Booth\\", and notes about the mailbox and voicemail. Hannes' defence was what he said in the police/ASC investigation, namely that he had been in an investment syndicate with an English friend who was wealthy and knowledgeable about finance and invited him to invest. The friend had then made the options purchases without Hannes' authority, but also without any special knowledge about TNT. And further that when the alleged insider trading became public knowledge Hannes and the friend agreed to return the monies. Hannes also indicated that he was due to meet his English friend in London to clarify the situation, however he could not find him. After eight days deliberation the jury returned guilty on the FTR charges, and after further instructions from the judge and another two days they reached guilty on the insider trading charge. Justice Backhouse handed down a sentence of 2 years 2 months imprisonment and $100,000 fine for the insider trading, and 4 months each for the FTR offences, but with those terms to all be served concurrently, and fines of $5,000 for each FTR offence in lieu of the terms being cumulative. She set a recognisance release period of 18 months. An appeal by Hannes in the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal was upheld on the grounds of certain directions given by Justice Backhouse to the jury. The conviction was quashed and a retrial ordered. Hannes had by that time served 15¬Ω months of his sentence and was released pending the outcome of the retrial. The retrial in the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Darlinghurst reached the same conclusion as the first, guilty on all charges. Justice James handed down the same sentence of 2 years 2 months and $100,000 fine for insider trading, and 4 months each for the FTR offences. But he made those FTR terms cumulative on the insider trading (but concurrent with each other) for a total 2 years 6 months. He set a recognisance release period of 20 months, which accounting for time already served meant a further 4¬Ω months in prison for Hannes. Justice James decided for cumulative sentences on the basis that the FTR offences were a separate criminality from the insider trading, and if they were not cumulative then the sentence would be manifestly inadequate. On 2008-05-13 Hannes won an uncommon second hearing in the High Court, to make an argument for special leave to appeal. A similar application was rejected in March 2008.

After gaining acclaim in the small international hardcore community for their debut album, the band switched gears to more country-leaning pop rock and changed the name of their band to Chamberlain, re-releasing their second album under the new moniker.  History  The band started as a youth crew inspired straight edge group in the Indianapolis, Indiana suburb of Carmel around singer Steve Duginske and bass player Curtis Mead, along with Clay Snyder. A mutual friend introduced the trio to young drummer Charlie Walker, and not long afterward, the quartet recorded their first demo and began playing shows. The addition of guitarist Adam Rubenstein from another local band, Decrepit, shifted them musically a bit and then new singer Dave Moore completed the group. The band played regularly with another local act, Hardball, and their Louisville, Kentucky friends Endpoint and started to build a following. Split Lip's second demo, entitled \\"A New Beginning\\" - a reference to the addition of Rubenstein and Moore, was still very youth crew oriented and went as far as to include a song about their local crew - but also dabbled in politics, and began to show the future direction of personal emotion-filled lyrics that the band would come to be known for. This demo attracted the attention of Pennsylvania-based Smorgasbord Records, and the band was invited to contribute a song for the \\"Voice of the Voiceless\\" animal-rights compilation, which also included Endpoint, as well as Youth of Today and Majority of One. With this exposure, the band began playing shows throughout the midwest, including numerous trips to St. Louis and Louisville, as well as the standards of Indianapolis and Bloomington, Indiana. After an initial trip to the Newspace in Dayton, Ohio, the band developed a tight working relationship with the Dayton band Stronghold, and it was the members of Stronghold who convinced Doghouse Records to release Split Lip's music. The band's debut 7\\" on Doghouse Records firmly established their sound, and with the Doghouse distribution, allowed a much wider audience. In 1992, the band was invited to be a headliner at the first More than Music Festival in Dayton, and instantly developed a national reputation as one of the premier bands of the fledgling emo-core genre. After recording the landmark \\"For the Love of the Wounded\\" in the spring of 1993, the band set out on their first U.S. tour. The release of \\"For the Love...\\" was delayed until the fall, but upon its release, the album became an overnight success, helping to define the emerging modern emo-core genre with its passionate sound and poetic, introspective lyrics. 1994 saw the band re-grouping, and working on material for their next record, and continuing to play shows in the midwest. During the summer of 1994, they again hit the road, this time focusing on the western US with Endpoint and Shift. In late 1995, the band again returned to Detroit to record \\"Fate's Got A Driver.\\" It was this record that set the gold-standard for emo-core. The intricate guitar work and soulful emotive lyrics laid the foundation for bands to come, such as The Get Up Kids. The summer of 1995 saw the band hit the road again, this time with Ohio's Colossus of the Fall, and DC's Samuel. It was during this month-long outing that the decision came to change the name and the direction of the band. Moore and Rubenstein returned to the studio in late 1995 and re-recorded the vocals and re-mixed the album, and Chamberlain was born. A final Chamberlain studio album, \\"The Moon My Saddle,\\" was recorded in the summer of 1998 and released later that year by Doghouse. The group continued performing for another two years, but without Snyder (who was not replaced, Mead (replaced by Showermast/Red Devil, Blue Devil's Seth Greathouse) and Walker (replaced by Uvula's Wade Parish). Matt \\"The Naked Bear\\" Reece carried a lot of drums, as well as sang some backing vocals. A shout out to Reece is also audible at the end of their Operation Ivy cover on the Songs You May or May Not Have Heard Before record (he also sings the second verse.)  Reunion  On the heels of a mini-Chamberlain reunion at the 2008 South by Southwest festival that featured Moore, Rubenstein, Walker and Mead, Split Lip reformed with Snyder in May 2009 for a series of shows culminating in the Burning Fight book release show in Chicago. The show celebrated the release of the '90s hardcore book of the same name released by Revelation Records. Aside from the Chicago date, two other shows were played in Louisville and Indianapolis in May, followed by a December performance at New York's Bowery Ballroom. Prior to these gigs, Snyder hadn't played with the band since 1998. Split Lip/Chamberlain will be touring with The Gaslight Anthem and Tim Barry starting in mid-July. The band will be selling a 7-inch single on tour, featuring its first new music since splitting in 2000: \\"Raise It High\\" on the A-side, with a newly recorded version of the old song \\"The South Has Spoiled Me\\" on the B-side. \\"The South Has Spoiled Me\\" includes vocals by Gaslight Anthem singer Brian Fallon and piano by Jonathan Cohen, who played on the original version.

In the beginning, Vlach families created small family settlements which were fused and became a single settlement such as current Avdella. The foundation and the growth of Avdella is associated with the rise of livestock-farming taking into account the pastoral habits of the locals. Before 1800, the village was situated in the \\"Fantines\\", but the residents, mostly large families of Vlach shepherds moved to the current position due to better climate. Under Ottoman rule, Avdella was in the kaza of Grevena, Sanjak of Serfice (modern Servia), Vilayet of Monastir (modern Bitola).

Initial issues contained occasional interviews with major artists like Brian Eno and Robert Fripp and extensive record reviews. After 14 issues, the title was shortened to simply Trouser Press, and it gradually transformed into a professional magazine with color covers and advertising.

From 1976 on, Trouser Press frequently centered on the growing punk movements in both London and New York. The magazine provided in-depth articles on bands such as the Sex Pistols, The Boomtown Rats, The Clash, The Damned, the Ramones, Television, and many other similar groups, long before other U.S. music publications did. In 1980, the magazine introduced \\"America Underground\\", a recurring column devoted to local music scenes from different areas of the country. By the early 1980s, the magazine's focus was almost exclusively on new wave, alternative rock, and underground rock from both sides of the Atlantic. Starting in 1982, flexi-discs were included with every issue, totaling 27 releases. Although the magazine seemed to be thriving, with an ever-growing circulation, editor Robbins ceased publication after the April 1984 issue (#96), citing a lack of interest in the continuing but stagnating new wave scene that left his writers with very little to say. Subscribers to Trouser Press received Record, Straight Arrow Publishers' monthly spinoff of Rolling Stone, to fulfill the remainder of their terms. Aftermath As a concept, Trouser Press continued to evolve after the publication of the magazine ceased. In 1983, The Trouser Press Guide to New Wave Records, edited by Robbins, was published by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book was sufficiently popular for four more substantially updated editions, with varying titles and publishers, to be issued over the years, culminating in 1997's The Trouser Press Guide to '90s Rock. This final edition featured all-new entries on over 2,000 bands and reviews of approximately 8,500 records and CDs. The contents of all five volumes are currently available on the Trouser Press website, which is updated with entries on new bands, as well as revisions/expansions of old articles, by Robbins and other writers. TrouserPress.com went online in 1997, and was relaunched in June 2020 with full scans of each issue of the magazine's ten-year run.

The airport, in part named in honour of the Chatham islander, Inia William Tuuta, who gifted the land for the airport, was completed in 1982 to replace a compacted grass airstrip at Te Hapupu that could only handle slow-flying Safe Air Bristol Freighter aircraft. The Armstrong Whitworth Argosy immediately started operating to the islands using the new airport until 1990, when Mount Cook Airlines and later Air Chathams took over air services to and from mainland New Zealand. A small aviation museum is also based there, signifying the importance that aviation has played in developing the economic wealth of the island group. Air Chathams operates services to Auckland, Christchurch, and Wellington, with Convair 580 aircraft. The airport is the base of Air Chathams and usually houses two aircraft overnight. Improvements proposed In 2012 the New Zealand Government announced plans to develop the airport as part of an overall Economic Plan for the Chatham Islands. Proposals include and extension out to 5250 feet (1600 metres) and resurfacing of the runway. A new passenger and administration terminal is also planned along with a larger apron area and a new large aircraft hangar.Stuff.co.nz  Prime Minister Visits Chatham Islands, Sept'12 Airlines and destinations  =Passenger= References Airports in New Zealand Chatham Islands Chatham Island ","title":"Chatham Islands / Tuuta Airport"},{"id":"3534147","text":"This is a list of military equipment of Germany's allies on the Balkan and Russian fronts (1941‚Äì1945).

When John Ruskin became Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford, he was critical about the teaching methods employed there and set out to reform them. To achieve this, he founded the Ruskin School of Drawing in 1871 to replace the older art school in the same, but restructured, premises and with the existing students. Macdonald was also retained as its head and became, therefore, the first Ruskin Master until his death in 1921.Royal Academy, RA Collection: People and Organisations, Alexander MacDonald.

Discovery and naming Cervical vertebra in multiple views In 1923, during the American Museum of Natural History expedition by Roy Chapman Andrews to Inner Mongolia, Peter Kaisen discovered numerous theropod remains in three quarries. They consist of the largely disarticulated remains of several individuals and material of the skull and the lower jaws is lacking. These were named and shortly described by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1933 as a new species of Ornithomimus: Ornithomimus asiaticus. The specific name refers to the Asian provenance. The species was placed in the new genus Archaeornithomimus by Dale Russell in 1972, making Archaeornithomimus asiaticus the type species of the genus. The generic name combines that of Ornithomimus with a Greek ·ºÄœÅœáŒ±·øñŒøœÇ (archaios), \\"ancient\\", because Russell believed that the layers in which Archaeornithomimus was found dated to the Cenomanian-Turonian ages, about 95 million years ago, making it one of the oldest ornithomimids known at the time. Gilmore had not assigned a holotype specimen; in 1990 David Smith and Peter Galton in the first comprehensive description of the fossils, choose specimen AMNH 6565, a foot, as the lectotype. The fossils were found in the Iren Dabasu Formation, which has been dated to the Cenomanian age, around 95.8 ¬± 6.2 million years ago. Foot bones found in the Early Cretaceous Arundel Formation of Maryland were referred by Othniel Charles Marsh to Allosaurus medius in 1988. In 1911 Richard Swann Lull named these as a new species of Dryptosaurus: Dryptosaurus grandis. In 1920 Gilmore renamed them to a new species of Ornithomimus. However, because Ornithomimus grandis already existed, he renamed the species Ornithomimus affinis. In 1972 Dale Russell renamed them as a second species of Archaeornithomimus: Archaeornithomimus affinis. However, in 1990 Smith and Galton concluded that the remains were not ornithomimosaurian and came from some other small theropod. In 1995 a supposed third species of Archaeornithomimus was named by Lev A. Nesov: Archaeornithomimus bissektensis, based on the holotype N 479/12457, a femur and metatarsals of a juvenile, found in the Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan, dating to the Turonian- Coniacian. Nevertheless, the affinity of A. bissektensis is generally doubted or not mentioned. Description Size comparison with an average human male Life restoration Archaeornithomimus was a medium sized ornithomimosaur, reaching long with a weight ranging from . Genus List for Holtz 2012 Weight Information Solid evidence coming from other ornithomimosaurian relatives suggest that Archaeornithomimus was a feathered animal, with very ratite-like feathers and equipped with a keratinous beak. The hindlimbs were robustly built. The third metatarsal was not pinched at the upper end, so the foot was not arctometatarsalian. The cervical vertebrae are highly pneumatized with very complex internal chambers across the neural arches and the centrum (body of the vertebra), indicating the presence of cervical air sacs. The anterior dorsal and some caudal vertebrae features some degree of pneumacity, however, the sacral vertebrae are apneumatic. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 229 foot bones referred to Archaeornithomimus were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found. Classification Skeletal mount in the Inner Mongolia Museum Russell assigned Archaeornithomimus to the Ornithomimidae. Recent cladistic analyses either confirm this or recover the species outside of the Ornithomimidae, basal in the Ornithomimosauria. During the description of Hesperornithoides and extensive Coelurosauria phylogenetic analysis (also known as the Lori matrix) was conducted in order to determine the position of this paravian. Here, Archaeornithomimus was recovered within the Garudimimidae being a relative of Arkansaurus: Paleoecology Restoration of two Gigantoraptors protecting their nest from two Archaeornithomimus and an Alectrosaurus The remains of Archaeornithomimus were found in the Iren Dabasu Formation, which dates back to the Cenomanian stage about 96 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous period. The environments present on the formation were mainly large floodplain terrains with braided rivers and meanders that were connected to the ocean, supporting extensive vegetation as seen on the palaeosol development and the numerous remains from herbivorous dinosaurs such as hadrosauroids. Like other members of the Ornithomimosauria, Archaeornithomimus was likely an omnivore equipped with a horny beak, eating everything from small mammals, to plants and fruit, to eggs, and even hatchlings of other Asian dinosaurs. Other dinosaurs that co-existed with Archaeornithomimus in the formation included other theropods, such as Alectrosaurus, Erliansaurus, Gigantoraptor and Neimongosaurus. Herbivorous dinosaurs were represented by Bactrosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus and Sonidosaurus.

In 1742 he graduated from Trondheim Cathedral School and attended the University of Copenhagen where he studied medicine and took a Bachelor's degree in 1747. From 1752 he stayed a couple of years at Uppsala University where he was a student of Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778).

Ascanius undertook a study trip in the years 1753 to 1758, visiting the Netherlands, England, France, Italy and Austria. After returning from his European study trip, in 1759 Ascanius was appointed professor of natural history at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts which was established at Charlottenborg at Copenhagen in 1754. He taught zoology and mineralogy in Copenhagen from 1759 to 1771. In 1768 he was sent on a research and collection trip along the Norwegian coast from Kristiansand to Bergen.

From 1954 to 1969, he was the 3rd President of the Bundestag. Life, career, resistance Gerstenmaier was born in Kirchheim unter Teck. After training as a salesman, Gerstenmaier did his Abitur and then studied philosophy, German language and literature, and Evangelical theology in T√ºbingen, Rostock and Zurich. In 1934, he was detained for a short time for being a member of the Confessing Church. In 1935, he became Theodor Heckel's assistant in the German Evangelical Church's office for outside affairs. After the Munich Conference in 1938, Gerstenmaier joined the resistance group about the Kreisau Circle. On 20 July 1944, the day of Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg's attempt on Adolf Hitler's life at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia, Gerstenmaier was at his assigned place at the Bendlerblock in Berlin to support the attempted assassination and coup d'√©tat against the Nazi r√©gime. Along with many others, he was arrested after the plot failed, and on 11 January 1945, Gerstenmaier was sentenced by the Volksgerichtshof to seven years in labour prison (Zuchthaus). This by the standards of \\"hanging judge\\" Roland Freisler unusually lenient sentence (the prosecution had demanded death by hanging) may partially be explained by Gerstenmaier's playing the \\"unworldly theologian\\" role to the hilt, partially by intercession on his behalf with Freisler by acting national press chief Helmut S√ºndermann.Fabian von Schlabrendorff, Eugen Gerstenmaier im Dritten Reich, Eine Dokumentation, Stuttgart 1965, pp. 35-36 Of course, he spent only a few months there, and was freed by US troops at the end of the war. Along with Hermann Ehlers, a German politician, he was active in the Evangelical Aid organization (Evangelisches Hilfswerk); from 1945 to 1951, he was its leader. In the Bundestag From 1949 to 1969, Gerstenmaier was a member of the Bundestag for the CDU. From 1949 to 1953, he was the Acting Chairman of the Foreign Board at the Bundestag, and eventually, until 17 December 1954, the Chairman. \\"Langer Eugen\\" in Bonn, the former (until 1999) Bundestag members' office building. After Hermann Ehlers's sudden death in 1954, Gerstenmaier became his successor (until 1969) as Bundestag President. With his election on 16 November 1954 arose a unique situation with two factional colleagues running against each other for the Bundestag Presidency. Against the \\"official\\" CDU/CSU candidate Gerstenmaier, whom many members, and the governing coalition, saw as being too close to the Church, stood Ernst Lemmer, put forward by FDP member Hans Reif, who lost only on the third ballot by a mere 14 votes. From 1957 until 12 October 1959, Gerstenmaier was Chairman of the Subcommission for managing the Bundestag \\"household\\". On 31 January 1969, Gerstenmaier resigned his post as Bundestag President after public controversy about claims of certain compensation benefits, to which he was legally entitled. However, the sheer amount of these claims was considered scandalous, and the suspicion that political influence was at work could not be allayed. His successor was Kai-Uwe von Hassel. Gerstenmeier died in Bonn. The 29-floor highrise in Bonn, in whose building Gerstenmaier had played such a significant r√¥le, and in which each member of the Bundestag had an office, is nicknamed \\"Langer Eugen\\" (\\"Long Eugen\\") after Eugen Gerstenmaier. It has, however, been described as \\"Bonn's ugliest building\\". Since June 2006 it is seat of United Nations Organizations. Political leanings Eugen Gerstenmaier belonged to a CDU faction who internally criticized Konrad Adenauer's policy of engaging the West because that brought along with it a tendency to turn away from the goal of reuniting Germany. Even in social policy, Gerstenmaier was rather critical of Adenauer and supported Ludwig Erhard's position instead, with pointedly Christian-Protestant arguments against the \\"total welfare state\\". From 1956 to 1966, he was acting CDU Federal Chairman. Gerstenmaier belonged to the select committee of both \\"Union\\" parties (the CDU and CSU) which on 24 February 1959 put forward Ludwig Erhard as a candidate for Federal President (Bundespr√§sident), although Erhard declined the honour.  Honours  In 1980, Gerstenmaier was the CDU's delegate alongside Hermann Kunst (Chairman), Alex M√∂ller (for the SPD), Rudolf Hanauer (for the CSU) and Bernhard Leverenz (for the FDP) on the Arbitration Committee for Overseeing Compliance with the Election Campaigning Agreement in the Bundestag election campaign. From 1977 until his death, Gerstenmaier was Chairman of the Association of Former Members of the German Bundestag (or as of 1984, the Association of Former Members of the German Bundestag and the European Parliament). In 1957, Gerstenmaier received the Grand Decoration of Honour in Gold with Sash for Services to the Republic of Austria.  Publications  *Der dritte Bundestag.

Hewlett, posed with the Bush-Conant file on the development of the atomic bomb. Richard Greening Hewlett (February 12, 1923 ‚Äì September 1, 2015) was an American public historian best known for his work as the Chief Historian of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Biography Hewlett was born in Toledo, Ohio, in 1923. In 1941, he attended Dartmouth College, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps doing work related to meteorology. With a number of other privates he attended Bowdoin College for a year, focusing on science. In June 1944, he did work relating to using radar to track weather balloons, and eventually the military sent him to Harvard University to study in the electronics school. In early 1945, he was sent to Western China as a radiosonde operator, sending meteorological information by radio to U.S. forces, which used them in planning bombing raids on Japan. After the war, Hewlett attended graduate school in history at the University of Chicago, though he never completed his undergraduate degree. He received his master's degree in 1948 and his PhD in 1952, writing his thesis on Lewis Cass, a nineteenth-century Michigan politician. While he was completing his dissertation, Hewlett accepted a position as an intelligence specialist in the United States Air Force, examining open literature on factories in the Soviet Union. Hewlett found the job tedious and in 1952 leaped at the chance to be a program analyst in the United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), compiling classified progress reports from all of the many branches of the AEC for the Commissioners. Hewlett later said that this job gave him a good general overview of the AEC and how it worked. In 1957, Hewlett was contacted in order to find a historian to write an official history of the AEC, a pet project by Commissioner Lewis Strauss. Hewlett was unable to find any academic historians interested, however, in part because science and technology were generally not considered an interesting subject of historical study at the time. Because of his history backgrounds, Hewlett himself was offered the job, which he happily accepted, and became the first official historian of the AEC. Hewlett sought out another public historian, Kent Roberts Greenfield, who was the Chief Historian of the United States Army. Greenfield encouraged Hewlett to establish an independent review board of academic historians who would serve as a buffer between Hewlett and the government bureaucrats who would inevitably object to certain portrayals of past U.S. government activities. Though he faced some initial resistance to the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission's Historical Advisory Committee, it was eventually approved by Strauss himself on the recommendation of one of Strauss's favorite academic historians. Part of Hewlett's work in writing the AEC history was acquiring historical AEC records before they were destroyed, encouraging local AEC agencies and branches to think about their records in a historical manner, and marking historical records for depositing at the National Archives. Hewlett later recounted an incident in which he was called, as Chief Historian, to witness to opening of an old wartime filing cabinet found under a stairwell of an AEC building. After the locksmith had opened the cabinet, Hewlett reached in and the first document he pulled out was a letter signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The cabinet turned out to be the wartime correspondence files of Vannevar Bush and James B. Conant, and is currently considered one of the most important collections of documents relating to Manhattan Project history. After going over thousands of secret and formerly secret records, Hewlett eventually produced his first volume of the official history, covering the time period of the Manhattan Project through the formation of the AEC. The New World, 1939-1946 was published in 1962, and was a runner-up for the 1963 Pulitzer Prize. Hewlett continued his work and published the second volume, Atomic Shield, 1947-1952 in 1969, which received the David D. Lloyd prize from the Harry S. Truman Library Institute. For both of these books, Hewlett was awarded the Distinguished Employee Award by the AEC, the highest employee award given by the agency. According to a later interview with Hewlett, he had difficulty in getting the final book cleared for publication by the United States Navy, because Admiral Hyman G. Rickover refused to allow it to be published unless Hewlett agreed to write an official history of the Nuclear Navy as well. Though irritated at the misuse of security clearances, Hewlett agreed and produced Nuclear Navy, 1946-1962 in 1974. Despite his initial irritation, Hewlett enjoyed working on the project as he was given unfettered access to any related files on account of having Rickover's personal backing. After the AEC was dismantled in 1974, Hewlett became the Chief Historian of its successor organization, the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA). When ERDA itself was dismantled in 1977, his position was transferred to its successor, the Department of Energy. When the Three Mile Island accident occurred in 1979, Hewlett was asked to write a history of the event as it was unfolding. Hewlett was by then hoping to retire, however, and two other historians were recommended for the job, Philip L. Cantelon and Robert C. Williams. After the success by Cantelon and Williams in contracting themselves to the DOE, Hewlett, Cantelon, Williams, and Rodney P. Carlisle, then a visiting researcher at the DOE, together founded a private company devoted to writing commissioned official histories of government agencies, individuals, or private companies, named History Associates Incorporated and based in Rockville, Maryland. Hewlett later said that only one time he attempted to be involved in AEC/DOE policymaking, writing up a history of the AEC's policies in handling nuclear waste, which he later said did not always portray the agency in a positive light. The document, completed in 1978, was essentially mothballed by the DOE and never followed up on. Hewlett officially retired from government work in 1980 while he was still working on his third volume of AEC history. Because of institutional changes, Hewlett had difficulty getting the work approved for public release. Finally published in 1989 as Atoms for Peace and War, 1953-1961, the book won the Richard W. Leopold Prize from the Organization of American Historians as the best book of the year on a U.S. federal government agency. He died September 1, 2015 at Maplewood Park Place, a senior living community in Bethesda, Maryland. Hewlett is today recognized as one of the most influential federal historians in the United States, and was a founding member of both the Society for History in the Federal Government and the National Council on Public History.

It protects an American bison herd which grazes on one of the state's largest prairie remnants. The state park is named after a linear escarpment of Precambrian Sioux Quartzite bedrock, which although pink in color, is said to have appeared blueish in the distance to early settlers. Parts of the cliff are up to high. Unusual in the surrounding prairie landscape, they are a popular site for rock climbing. The park also preserves a line of rocks aligned by Plains Indians which marks where the sun rises and sets on the spring and fall equinoxes. It also has a small reservoir for swimming, the only lake in Rock County. The park's interpretive center was once the home of the author Frederick Manfred. Four structures and one building in the park, built by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Wildlife The park is home to a small population of coyotes and deer as well as various birds. =Bison herd= Bison herd in the park in spring The park's bison herd began in 1961 with the purchase of three animals from Fort Niobrara National Wildlife Refuge in Nebraska. Today there are over 100 bison in the park. To keep age and sex ratios close to that of a natural herd, individuals are sold in a fall auction. The bison range is fenced off, and visitors are warned not to approach when these strong and unpredictable animals are near the fenceline. Cultural history According to local folklore the mound was used as a buffalo jump before European settlement, but no archaeological evidence has yet been found as verification. The soil of the mound was too thin and boulder-strewn for farming, saving it from the plow, although it was grazed. Parkland was originally established north of the Blue Mound for the purpose of providing work relief during the Great Depression and water recreation. WPA crews built two dams on Mound Creek, creating Upper and Lower Mound Lake ‚Äî and respectively ‚Äî and facilities such as picnic grounds and a beach house. The Mound Springs Recreational Reserve opened in 1937. In the 1950s trees were planted around the lakes and campground. The Frederick Manfred House Land was added in 1955 and 1961, at which point the name was changed to Blue Mounds State Park. More lands were authorized in 1963 and 1965 to include the whole of Blue Mound and property to either side. The state bought Frederick Manfred's house in 1972 to turn into an interpretive center, although they let him live there for three more years. Because the house was at the southern end of the mound and the developed part of the park was at the north end, a connecting road was surveyed across the top. Local conservationists argued the state out of this plan several times in the 1970s, citing the impact to the environment atop the mound. In 1986 a road was paved from the house south to a county highway instead, so that visitors to the interpretive center must hike in from the north or drive around the edge of the park to the south entrance. In 1989 the WPA developments were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. The district contains five contributing properties‚Äîfour structures and one building: Upper Dam, Upper Mound Lake, Lower Dam, Lower Mound Lake (all created in 1938) and a latrine (built 1939‚Äì42) located by the current cart-in campground. They are considered historically significant as examples of New Deal federal work relief and recreational development in southwestern Minnesota, and architecturally significant for their unique National Park Service rustic design using Sioux Quartzite. The two dams are particularly noteworthy, blending into the natural rock walls of the creek, an exceptional application of rustic style to utilitarian structures. Carrie Nelson murder Blue Mounds State Park was the scene of a murder May 20, 2001, when Carrie Nelson, then 20, was beaten to death while working alone in the park office. A coroner said the wounds to her head appeared as if she'd been struck with a rock. The killer apparently stole about $2,000 from the park coffers. The case went unsolved for six years until May 2007 when, in a routine check of DNA samples of prison inmates in South Dakota, police found a match with DNA samples gathered from the crime scene. The samples linked Randy Leeroyal Swaney, 35, to the murder. He was serving time for a 2004 burglary.Watch, DNA solved 2001 park slaying, Star Tribune , May 9, 2007, online edition.

It was released in 2004 with Weber on piano, drummer Mark Walker, Eric Alexander on sax, trumpeters Diego Urcola and Roy Hargrove, bassists Avishai Cohen, Niels-Henning √òrsted Pedersen, Peter Washington and Gary Burton on vibraphone. Weber produces and performs a popular concert series entitled 'From Joplin to Jarrett: 100 Years of Piano Jazz', which received positive reviews in such publications as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. (Review in external links below) Weber's broadcast appearances have included NPR's Piano Jazz with the late pianist Marian McPartland, and Jazz Inspired with Judy Carmichael. In 2012 he began hosting an updated version of the popular Piano Jazz program, now called Piano Jazz with Jon Weber on NPR, replacing Mrs. McPartland, who stepped down from her longtime hosting duties in the fall of 2011.

The film features music from Philip Glass. The film was awarded the Label Europa Cinemas prize at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival and is currently distributed theatrically in the United States by the Cinema Guild with a DVD release handled by Koch-Lorber Films. The film is based on a 1986 book of the same title by Carrere.  Plot  Marc Thiriez, a middle aged Parisian, asks his wife if he should shave off the moustache he has sported for most of his adult life. His wife, Agn√®s, wryly comments that she wouldn't recognize him without it, yet as she leaves, Marc shaves the moustache off. Upon her return, Agn√®s is angry Marc did not let her in the door when she rang; Marc lies and says he broke his shoelace. Marc attempts to surprise her with his clean- shaven face, but gets no reaction. In the car Marc asks his wife if she notices anything. She does not respond, wanting to know if he thinks she is dressed too sexy for the party. Later that evening, as the two visit their friends Serge (Agn√®s' first husband) and Nadia, Serge tells a funny story from his marriage to Agn√®s, how she was sneaky and refused to admit it, even when found out. Agn√®s again denies the sneakiness. Frustrated that Serge and Nadia also do not notice that Marc has shaven his trademark moustache, Marc fights with Agn√®s in the car as they return home, frightening her. As they lie in bed that night, another fight over the moustache ensues as Agn√®s tells Marc he's never had a moustache and that she fears for his sanity. Agn√®s phones Nadia, who claims Marc has not had a moustache in fifteen years. Agn√®s takes a sleeping pill to sleep. Marc finds a photo album of pictures from their holiday in Bali, all of which show him sporting his moustache. When he confronts Agn√®s with these pictures, she ignores him and changes the subject, leaving him even more confused. She suggests Marc see a psychiatrist whom her friend Fran√ßois knew. Marc tries to make the best of his situation, but grows more paranoid and confused when even his co-workers don't acknowledge that he has shaven his moustache. He smokes a cigarette and his co-worker tells him he is fool for starting up again. His wife is upset at the football team and yells at the TV. She is upset when she finds Marc has taken up smoking again. They go out and Agn√®s insists on buying Marc a brightly patterned jacket (\\"a clown's jacket\\" as Marc describes it). Agn√®s orders a cigarette at dinner, saying they will quit together again later, and cries as she smokes and drinks. As Marc gets his photograph taken for his work badge, he asks a woman who is also getting her photograph taken if she notices a difference between the photograph that was just taken and his photograph which appears on his I.D. card. She remarks on his moustache, and Marc asks her several times if she is sure he has a moustache in the photograph. She confirms this, which leaves Marc more baffled. He returns home early from work. Marc checks his answering machine to find a message from his father. Agn√®s' friend Bruno calls and Marc tells him to stop kidding him about his moustache. Bruno assures Marc that Marc has not had a moustache in fifteen years. Marc hangs up on him. In the kitchen, he tells Agn√®s to call his parents and tell them that he won't be able to come to their house for dinner the next day. Agn√®s calls Marc's mother, but gently reminds Marc that his father is dead and has been so for a year. Confused, Marc speaks of their best friends Serge and Nadia, to which Agn√®s replies that she doesn't know who they are and that Marc must be delusional. Very upset and slowly losing his grip on sanity, Marc goes to bed, and Agn√®s gives him a sleeping pill. Marc awakes to hear Agn√®s and Bruno planning to have Marc committed to a psychiatric hospital. Marc quickly dresses and flees the house. In a taxi, he attempts to find his mother, yet due to the sleeping pill and the heavy rain, he cannot find the house in which he grew up. Marc tries to call his mother, but the number he dials is not a valid phone number. He calls Agn√®s, tells her he is at his mother's, and asks her to pick him up. When Marc sees Agn√®s and Bruno leave his apartment, he rushes inside, grabs his passport, puts on shoes, breaks his shoelace and leaves. He flees to Hong Kong, the first available flight out of Paris. His passport photo sports a moustache. Marc journeys through Hong Kong, traveling back and forth on the Star Ferry all day. After the ferry stops for the night, he pays local sailors to take him with them on their boat. They agree, and Marc arrives at an unspecified village in China. Marc stays at a hotel there for a period of time, becoming known with the locals, and regrows his signature moustache. Marc arrives back at the hotel one day to find Agn√®s awaiting him, as though she has been with him the entire trip. Agn√®s makes fun of his brightly patterned jacket and asks him why he bought it, hoping he will not wear it in Paris. They go out to a casino and meet new friends that Agn√®s knows but Marc does not. The male half of the couple shows him recent photos of the four of them in which Marc has a moustache. Marc has no memory of the event, but the pictures are whisked away before he can examine them closely. Agn√®s notices Marc's irritation and says if he doesn't like their new friends they don't have to ever see them again when they get back to Paris. Back at the hotel, Agn√®s suggests that Marc shave his moustache so she can see him without it at least once. He does so, and Agn√®s comments upon how good he looks without it.  Production notes  The Hong Kong village scenes were filmed in Ko Lau Wan, Sai Kung Peninsula, Hong Kong. La Moustache captures an element of suspense, though the actions and plot are ambiguous. Many critics have said that the film's events are not literal, but metaphorical and are symbolic of Marc's loss of identity (or of a possible mid-life crisis). Whether the final scene was meant to be what really happened or was just an idealised dream of what Marc wished had happened is unspecified.

Personal life Zafirovski was born in Skopje, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (the present- day capital of North Macedonia). He immigrated to United States in 1969, arriving in Cleveland, Ohio with his family, $1500 among them and speaking no English. Two years later, he entered Edinboro University on a swimming scholarship. In 2004, he received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Career Zafirovski spent 24 years with General Electric, starting in 1975, where he went through GE's Jack Welch-style leadership training programs and served in various management positions. Between 1996 and 1999, he was head of the European division of GE Lighting, during which time the division posted record profits. He was then promoted to his last position at GE, as president and CEO of GE Lighting from July 1999 to May 2000. Afterwards, he joined Motorola, serving as Executive Vice President and President of the Personal Communications Sector from June 2000 until July 2002. In 2002, he was passed over for the promotion to Chief Operating Officer for Edward Breen, but Breen quit later that year and Zafirovski was given the title in July 2002. His success in the PCS division among other achievements at Motorola, seemed to make him a perfect candidate for the CEO position but the title went to Edward Zander on January 5, 2004. Zafirovski resigned on January 12, 2005. He was a consultant to and a director of Motorola from then until May 2005. When Zafirovski was chosen to head up Nortel Networks in early October, Motorola filed a suit against him, alleging that his new position would break the terms of the non-disclosure agreement he had signed. As part of that agreement, he had received a payoff from Motorola. The payoff had a clawback element should Zafirovski return to work within a defined period he would agree to refund a percentage of the payoff. The problem was he did not want to refund any of the money. As a consequence Nortel agreed to pay $11.5 million on his behalf. Zafirovski became the President and Chief Executive Officer of Nortel Networks, replacing Bill Owens as of November 15, 2005. Zafirovski announced he was stepping down as CEO of Nortel on August 10, 2009, following the sale of the company's CDMA and LTE businesses to Ericsson as part of a bankruptcy restructuring process. During Zafirovski's entire career at Nortel his email and company profile were compromised by hackers, most likely working for the Chinese Government. He was elected to the Board of Directors at Boeing on October 25, 2004. In July 2007 President George W. Bush appointed Zafirovski to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee. In August 2009, Mike Zafirovski sought a $12 million payout from Nortel.

He caused an important bridge to be built across the Savannah River at Augusta, Georgia, and founded the town of Hamburg, South Carolina.  Early life  Shultz was born Klaus Hinrich Klahn in the village of Dahme on the Baltic coast of Holstein, at the time the duchy was in personal union with the kingdom of Denmark. He left Dahme for the port city of L√ºbeck at age 16, in time becoming a wealthy trader there and in nearby Wismar. Economic dislocation during the Napoleonic Wars pushed Klahn's business into failure. He changed his name, escaped his debtors to Altona, near Hamburg, Germany, and finally stowed away on a ship bound for America.Voigt-Lassen 1965  Career  Shultz came to Augusta, Georgia in 1806 and took up as a laborer on the Savannah River pole boats. These carried upcountry produce such as tobacco (and later, cotton) to Savannah, Georgia, and returned with manufactured items such as metal goods, paper, and cloth. In 1809 he purchased his own boat.Cordle 1940, 79 In 1814 he engaged the support of a 'mechanic' named Lewis Cooper, secured financing, and drove the construction of a Savannah River bridge at Augusta. Two previous bridges had been swept away by floods, but his bridge proved remarkably durable and served the city well until 1888.Cordle 1940, 79‚Äì80 Shultz took advantage of the great success of his bridge, using it to capitalize the Bridge Company of Augusta, complete with currency known as 'Bridge Bills' that circulated widely.Cordle 1940, 80 'Bridge Bill' All of this came to an end during the Panic of 1819. The Bridge Company failed, the Bridge Bills became worthless, and the bridge itself fell into the hands of a creditor. The enraged Shultz concluded that the citizens of Augusta conspired against him to take away his hard-earned accomplishments.Cordle 1940, 80‚Äì81 Driven to desperation, Shultz attempted suicide with a pistol, but survived.Scott 1884, 27 As revenge, Shultz enlisted the support of property owners on the opposite side of the river, and in 1821 founded the town of Hamburg, South Carolina. The town grew quickly and by the end of 1821 had 84 houses and 200 inhabitants, directly competing with Augusta in its role as an upriver trading point. Shultz ruled the town as its 'proprietor' and worked continuously to improve it by constructing buildings, streamlining its water and road connections, and encouraging the opening of a bank.Cordle 1940, 82 Seal used by Henry Shultz 1825‚Äì1850 He used the newspapers to brag about Hamburg's success, deride the hated Augusta, and threaten legal action against his persecutors. Playing on the theme of retaining South Carolina commerce within the State, he successfully appealed to the legislature for tax exemptions and loans, that he used to buy a steamboat and construct buildings.Cordle 1940, 83‚Äì85 He founded a Mechanics Society, and conducted a Mechanics Festival that amounted to an annual pep rally for his town.Hughes 2010 Hamburg grew quickly, but Shultz was derailed by a series of mishaps. A suspect in Shultz's custody died during the investigation of a trunk stolen from a wagon. Shultz was held in the district jail at Edgefield, and in a sensational trial was convicted of manslaughter. He was sentenced to six months' confinement, and then to be branded on the hand with the letter 'M'. But Shultz obtained a pardon from the governor, and apparently escaped the branding.Stokes 1951, 249 While Hamburg itself had been a measured success, Shultz had long since run out of money. He had difficulty getting paid for rents and for the sale of lots, and the defaulted Bridge Bills continued to dog him. While in jail for manslaughter, half of Hamburg was sold off in a sheriff's sale.Cordle 1940, 91 In 1828 Shultz found himself in jail again, this time for bankruptcy. He was forced to turn his remaining assets over to his creditors.Cordle 1940, 91‚Äì92 In the following years he was able to obtain some forgiveness and renewed support from the state, and despite his diminished role, continued to foster 'his' town.Hughes, 2010 Death and legacy Shultz steadily sold off property in order to maintain himself. He died intestate and in poverty on October 13, 1851 at the age of 75 in Hamburg, South Carolina. To his death he maintained his alias and was generally believed to have been born in 'Hamburg on the Elbe'.Hughes, 2010 Hamburg quickly declined during the 1850s, and by the time of the war was a ghost town.Chapman 1897, 20 The town enjoyed a resurgence during reconstruction as a home for displaced freedmen, but in 1876 was the site of the Hamburg massacre.Budiansky 2008, 221‚Äì254 Hamburg once again dwindled until its final destruction in a Savannah River flood in 1929. Shultz Township in present-day Aiken County is named in his honor.

He is currently an assistant coach for Quer√©taro F√∫tbol Club's U-20 team.http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/2017/02/16/diego-cervantes-sera- auxiliar-en-gallos  Career  Before earning a spot on Club Am√©rica's senior team, Cervantes worked his way up the inferior divisions, eventually earning a spot in San Luis F.C., America's minor league affiliate at the time. After helping San Luis earn a promotion to the first division after the Clausura 2005 season, Cervantes was transferred to Club Am√©rica prior to the Apertura 2005 season. His debut in the professional Mexican league came October 30, 2005 - in a game against one of America's most bitter rivals - UNAM Pumas. Cervantes started the game along with many other reserves, due to the fatigue endured by the starters after playing that very same week against Velez Sarsfield in the Copa Sudamericana. After playing the full 90 minutes and holding his own against UNAM's talented strikers, Cervantes was praised by the media and fans alike after helping the team to a 2-1 win. He would play once more during the regular season, coming on to the pitch as a substitute against Atlante, where his brother Horacio Cervantes plays, also as a defender. Diego once again helped the club to victory, beating Atlante 4-3. In the Apertura 2005 playoffs, to which America qualified in the first position with the best record in the league, Diego was called to play against UANL Tigres in the second leg of the quarterfinals. Reprising his role as a substitute, Diego was part of a team that lost 4-1 at home and was eliminated in an embarrassing fashion. After the game, the press criticized the rookie for his role in allowing a crucial goal, as well as Club Am√©rica's coach Mario Carrillo, for inserting an inexperienced player in the biggest game of the season. Following the elimination, Carrillo was fired and Cervantes was relegated to the bench by subsequent managers, V√≠ctor Manuel Aguado and Manuel Lapuente. The Am√©ricanista defence suffered through a stagnant period forcing them to reconsider their roster; Diego was a casualty and returned to San Luis in 2008 for that year's Apertura. His next stop was Necaxa for the 2009 Clausura season. A move to reinforce that team to fight against relegation ‚Äì eventually they lost the battle, dragging them to Liga de Ascenso. An interesting anomaly happened: Diego saw some action as a centre forward. He scored 3 goals against Indios (2) in round 3 and Tigres (1) in round 14. Not in the plans of boss Jes√∫s Ram√≠rez made Cervantes wear his fourth jersey in a short time. For the 2009 Apertura season he defended his brother's old team, Atlante.

He was Attorney General of New York from 1979 to 1993 and the Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate election in New York in 1992. Personal life Abrams was born in The Bronx, New York, in a Jewish family, the son of Benjamin and Dorothy Abrams. He has one sister, Marlene (Abrams) Kitrosser. On September 15, 1974, he married the daughter of Jacob and Hilda Schulder, Diane Schulder Abrams, an attorney who created and taught the first \\"Women and the Law\\" course in an American law school. Diane has two siblings, Howard Schulder and Sylvia Schulder Fisher. Robert and Diane have two daughters, Rachel and Becky, and six grandchildren. Robert and Diane's second child Becky was born to them when Diane we as 49 years old. They attribute her birth to a blessing they received from the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He graduated from Columbia College and the New York University School of Law. He is considered a member of the reform wing of the Democratic Party. Political career Abrams was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1966 to 1969, sitting in the 176th, 177th and 178th New York State Legislatures. From 1970 to 1978, he was Borough President of the Bronx and a member of the New York City Board of Estimate, having been elected in 1969 and overwhelmingly re-elected in 1973 and 1977. He was a delegate to the 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984 Democratic National Conventions. At the 1972 Democratic National Convention, he was the co-chair of the New York delegation and was at the microphone to cast New York's 272 votes for George McGovern. In 1980, he was the chairman of Senator Edward M. Kennedy's primary campaign for president in New York and led a strong victory over incumbent President Jimmy Carter. In 1988, he was a presidential elector, voting for Michael DukakisLloyd Bentsen ticket. Abrams was elected New York Attorney General in 1978, the first time in forty years a Democrat was elected to that post and was subsequently re-elected three times, in 1982, 1986, and 1990. He defeated future Republican Rep. Peter King in his 1986 re-election campaign for Attorney General. Abrams built a reputation as an activist and consumer advocate, taking on environmental polluters, charity frauds, discrimination in housing and various activities in the marketplace. He is also well known for the manner in which he sensitively and professionally handled an extremely difficult assignment, that of special prosecutor investigating the claims of Tawana Brawley. Governor Mario Cuomo directed him in 1988 to investigate the claims of Brawley, a black teen-ager, that she had been abducted and raped in upstate Dutchess County by a gang of whites. A lengthy grand jury inquiry supervised by Abrams' office later concluded that she had fabricated her story. During his tenure as Attorney General, Abrams received numerous awards and honors and earned national prominence rarely achieved by a state-level official. He served as president of the National Association of Attorneys General and was selected by his colleagues to receive the coveted Wyman Award as Outstanding Attorney General in the Nation. In 1992, he sought election to the United States Senate, to challenge Republican Senator Al D'Amato. He won the Democratic Primary, defeating former Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro, Rev. Al Sharpton, and New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman. Abrams was initially the front-runner but by the end of the summer he was running second to Ferraro in polls. The nomination battle then took a bitter turn, particularly Holtzman and Abrams' attack on Ferraro's questionable business dealings which Ferraro interpreted as anti-Italian slurs. After Abrams emerged as the nominee, the Democrats remained divided and he was unable to secure Ferraro's endorsement until the last days of the campaign. Abrams was also criticized for calling D'Amato a Fascist, and he narrowly lost the general election as a result of these controversies. After narrowly losing the Senate race, Abrams failed to realize his hopes for a cabinet post in the administration of President Bill Clinton. Abrams also wanted to run for Governor of New York, however fellow Democrat and incumbent Mario Cuomo decided to seek a fourth term. Despite making plans to run for re-election as state attorney general, Abrams announced his resignation from the office of attorney general on September 8, 1993, to take effect on December 31. He had a year left in his term. Post-political career Upon leaving government, Abrams joined Stroock & Stroock & Lavan as a partner. He has remained active in civic affairs in New York.Attorney General Abrams to Quit To Join a Law Firm in Manhattan. New York Times. September 9, 1993. In 1996, the New York University School of Law established an annual lecture program, the Attorney General Robert Abrams Public Service Lecture whereby each year a prominent public figure who has performed exemplary public service addresses the students, faculty and alumni of the law school to urge students to consider all or a portion of their career to be dedicated to public service. Mayor Bloomberg appointed Abrams in 2005 to serve on the New York City Charter Revision Commission. In 2006, New York Governor Elect Eliot Spitzer appointed Abrams to serve as Co-Chair of his Policy Advisory Committee on Governmental Reform for his Transition, and New York Attorney General Elect Andrew Cuomo appointed him Executive Chair of his Transition Committee. In 2008, New York Governor David Paterson appointed Abrams to serve on the Board of the United Nations Development Corporation. On May 9, 2009, New York Governor David Paterson renamed the Justice Building at the Empire State Plaza in Albany the Robert Abrams Building for Law and Justice. Also in 2009, Attorney General elect Eric Schneiderman appointed Abrams to serve as Honorary Co-Chair of his transition committee. In 2010, New York's Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman appointed him to be a member of the Advisory Council for the Retired Attorney Pro Bono Program. In 2012, Governor Andrew Cuomo appointed Abrams as co- chairman of a Moreland Commission to investigate the preparedness and response of the utilities in New York State to Superstorm Sandy which took the lives of numerous New Yorkers and caused billions of dollars of damage. At the conclusion of its hearings and deliberations, the Commission released a report which resulted in changes to New York State law and practices by utilities. He also served on numerous boards of community not for profit organizations: Fund for the City of New York, Citizens Union Board Member and President of the Citizens Union Foundation, America Israel Friendship League, and Council for a Secure America. Abrams also served on the corporate boards of Sterling Bancorp and Sterling National Bank for 18 years. On October 16, 2018, Abrams and Public Advocate Letitia James (running for New York State Attorney General) were at the steps of New York City Hall for a press conference where he announced his endorsement for James in the race.

Her sister ships included , the lead ship, along with , , , and . Seeadler was built at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig in late 1890, launched in February 1892, and commissioned in August of that year. Intended for colonial service, Seeadler was armed with a main battery of eight guns and had a top speed of . Seeadler spent almost her entire career abroad. Following her commissioning, she joined the protected cruiser in 1893 on a visit to the United States for the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's discovery of the Americas. She thereafter went to German East Africa, where she was stationed until 1898. She returned to Germany briefly for a modernization in 1898-1899, before being assigned to the South Seas Station in German New Guinea. During her tour in the Pacific, she participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China in 1900. Her assignment in the Pacific was interrupted by the 1905 Maji-Maji Rebellion in German East Africa, which prompted the German Navy to send Seeadler there. Seeadler remained in East Africa for the next nine years, returning to Germany finally in January 1914. She had spent over thirteen years abroad since her 1899 modernization, the longest period of continuous overseas service of any major German warship. After arriving in Germany, she was decommissioned. She was not mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, being too old to be of any fighting value. She was instead used as a mine storage hulk outside Wilhelmshaven. On 19 April 1917, her cargo of mines exploded and destroyed the ship, though there were no casualties. Her wreck was never raised for scrapping. Design Illustration of the Bussard- class cruiser Seeadler was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two horizontal 3-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines powered by four coal- fired cylindrical boilers. These provided a top speed of and a range of approximately at . She had a crew of 9 officers and 152 enlisted men.Gr√∂ner, p. 97 The ship was armed with eight 10.5 cm SK L/35 quick-firing (QF) guns in single pedestal mounts, supplied with 800 rounds of ammunition in total. They had a range of . Two guns were placed side by side forward, two on each broadside, and two side by side aft. The gun armament was rounded out by five revolver cannon.Gardiner, p. 253 She was also equipped with two torpedo tubes with five torpedoes, both of which were mounted on the deck. Service history Seeadler (right) with in Hampton Roads Seeadler (sea eagle)Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 151 was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig in late 1890. She was launched on 2 February 1892, originally named Kaiseradler (Eastern imperial eagle). The shipyard director, Kapit√§n zur See (Captain) Aschmann, gave the launching speech. She was completed by 27 June 1892, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. The ship was renamed on 17 August when she was commissioned, since Kaiser Wilhelm II decided to rename his first yacht Kaiseradler instead. Seeadler began her sea trials the same day. On 25 October, she was accidentally rammed by the armored corvette in Kiel, but she suffered only light damage. Her trials lasted until 17 November; she formally entered service with the fleet on 15 March 1893.Gr√∂ner, p. 98Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 152 After her commissioning, Seedadler was slated to replace in the East African Station in German East Africa. But first, Seeadler and the protected cruiser conducted a goodwill visit to the United States, a belated celebration of the 400th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage across the Atlantic. The ships left Kiel on 25 March, but due to a mistaken estimate for the amount of coal that would be necessary to cross the Atlantic, Seeadler ran out of fuel while en route. Kaiserin Augusta took the cruiser under tow to Halifax, where she refilled her coal bunkers. The two cruisers reached Hampton Roads on 18 April. Ships from nine other navies, including the US Navy, arrived for a major celebration in New York harbor that was reviewed by Grover Cleveland, the President of the United States.Sondhaus, p. 206Northrop, pp. 195-197 Seeadler's yacht-like appearance attracted particular attention. =Deployment to East Africa= After the conclusion of the festivities in the United States, Seeadler steamed back across the Atlantic to the Azores, before proceeding into the Mediterranean Sea and then into the Red Sea. There, she met Schwalbe at Aden on 20 June. Seeadler proceeded to Bombay, India, for routine maintenance that lasted from 3 July to 21 August. The cruiser finally arrived on station on 2 September when she dropped anchor in Zanzibar and met the survey ship , the other vessel on the East Africa Station. On 9 September both ships went to Kilwa; a group of slave traders had attacked the small police force detachment stationed there. The colonial army, the Schutztruppe (protection force), was unavailable to reinforce the police troops, and so Seeadler and M√∂we bombarded the slavers and neutralized the threat. Contemporary map of German East Africa Seeadler proceeded to Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese Mo√ßambique. A rebellion in the Portuguese colony threatened German nationals residing in the city; Seeadler evacuated the civilians and took them to Zanzibar, where they arrived on 15 November. During this period, M√∂we was transferred to German New Guinea, and Seeadlers sister ships and arrived in German East Africa. Condor was to reinforce Seeadler and Cormoran was to continue on to the Pacific, but the latter remained in the area temporarily to strengthen the German naval force in the region. This was done both to observe the damage to German economic interests in Mo√ßambique and as a show of force to prevent British encroachment on Delagoa Bay, which was the only supply port for the independent Transvaal. In January 1895, Condor took over Seeadlers role on the East African coast. On 10 January, Seeadler departed for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired in a major overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent to do the work. Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 152-153 The rest of the year was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500 million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid- February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 153 After completing her repairs, Seeadler was ordered to German South-West Africa on 28 April to assist the Schutztruppe in suppressing a local rebellion. The ship was tasked with interrupting the shipment of weapons from British arms dealers to the rebels. Seeadler thereafter proceeded to Swakopmund on 5 May; she was joined there by the gunboat . The two ships sent forces ashore to defend the city. At the end of the month, Seeadler returned to East Africa. On 2 October, she steamed to Zanzibar to take the deposed Sultan Khalid bin Barghash to Dar es Salaam following the brief Anglo- Zanzibar War. On 20 December, Seeadler was again called to Louren√ßo Marques after the German consul Graf von Pfeil was attacked by Portuguese colonial police. Condor joined her there on 2 January 1897 to strengthen the show of force. Seeadler thereafter proceeded to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul. The following two years proceeded uneventfully. In January 1898, Seeadler again returned to Cape Town for an overhaul before being ordered to return to Germany on 3 May. She left Dar es Salaam three days later and arrived in Aden on 31 May. There she met Schwalbe, which was replacing her in East Africa. Seeadler returned to Kiel on 26 June, and she was placed out of service on 9 July for a major overhaul in Danzig. The work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft, and the changes included removing the main mast and cutting down her rigging to a topsail schooner rig.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 153-154Gr√∂ner, pp. 97-98 On 3 October 1899, Seeadler was recommissioned and was ordered to replace her sister on the South Seas Station in German New Guinea. She departed Kiel on 19 October and stopped in Tangiers on 27-28 October to force restitution from the Moroccan government for damage to German interests. Seeadler then proceeded to Germany's south-Pacific colonies, arriving on 15 November.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 154 =Deployment to the Pacific= Seeadler, Following her arrival in the Pacific, Seeadler first went to the Admiralty Islands on 18 January 1900 in response to the murder of European businessmen by natives there. Starting on 30 January, she took a cruise to tour the German holdings in the area that lasted for several weeks. Stops included the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands, both of which had been recently purchased from Spain. In May, a cruise to German Samoa followed; there she met Cormoran. The two ships then toured the islands with the governor of German Samoa, Wilhelm Solf, and the Samoan chief, Mata'afa Iosefo, aboard Seeadler. In July 1900, following the outbreak of the Boxer Rebellion in Qing China the previous year, Seeadler was sent from the South Seas Station to assist in the Western suppression of the Boxers. She arrived in Tsingtau in the Kiautschou Bay concession and joined the ships of the East Asia Squadron. She spent the following months off Chinese harbors with the armored cruiser and the protected cruiser . On 24 April 1901, Seeadler was ordered to steam to the island of Yap in the Carolines to assist the stranded Norddeutscher Lloyd postal steamer . A pair of tugboats had managed to pull the steamer free by the time Seeadler arrived on 3 May, though the cruiser's crew assisted with repairs to the ship's damaged hull. Seeadler thereafter returned to East Asia and resumed her patrols of Chinese harbors, though during this period she also visited Japanese harbors as well. These duties lasted until the end of 1902. During Seeadlers operations in China, her crew suffered only one casualty from enemy action.Sundries, p. 547 On 2 January 1903, her sister arrived to take her place in East Asian waters, allowing Seeadler to return to the South Seas Station. Seeadler underwent a periodic overhaul in Uraga, outside Tokyo, Japan, from 3 August to 14 September. Following the outbreak of the Russo- Japanese War in February 1904, Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany. During this period, Cormoran was replaced by Condor; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadlers old consort from East Africa, the survey vessel M√∂we.Naval Notes, 1904, p. 1079 In early 1905, Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before returning to Tsingtau in April. On 28 June, with the Russo-Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima, Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron, permitting her return to the South Seas Station. While en route to her station area, Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August. Her presence was necessary there to help put down a major uprising, the Maji Maji Rebellion, that had broken out in July. Seeadler ran aground twice, at Labuan and Singapore, on her way to East Africa, but neither incident resulted in damage to the ship. She arrived in Dar es Salaam on 1 October. =Return to East Africa= Seeadler in Dar es Salaam during her second deployment In mid-October 1905, Seeadler sent a landing party ashore at Samanga to protect the coastal telegraph line there. By mid-December, she had returned to Dar es Salaam, before proceeding to Kilwa on 17 January 1906. The cruiser was back in Dar es Salaam on 24 January. Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March. By this time, the situation in East Africa had calmed, and the light cruiser , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji-Maji uprising, was sent back to Germany. Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region, and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907. In October 1907, then- Korvettenkapit√§n (Lieutenant Commander) Hugo Meurer served as the ship's commanding officer. He would hold the position until June 1909. In 1908, Seeadler was joined by Bussard on the East Africa Station.Naval Notes, 1908, p. 710 From 18 February to 18 March, Seeadler underwent another overhaul at Cape Town. She thereafter proceeded to German South-West Africa, stopping in Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, pp. 154-155 There, she cruised with the gunboat in March and early April. On 18 April, she was back in Dar es Salaam. Another period of dockyard repairs followed from 12 to 26 September, this time in Bombay. The rest of 1908 continued uneventfully for Seeadler, as did the next few years. The only significant event came in early November 1911, when Seeadler pulled the Hamburg-Bremen-Afrika Linie steamer free after she ran aground off Quelimane. In 1913, the mayor of Cape Town hosted delegations from Seeadler and the British protected cruiser . And at the end of December, the princes Leopold and Georg of Bavaria visited Seeadler in Dar es Salaam while on an overseas tour.Hildebrand, R√∂hr, & Steinmetz, p. 155 =Later service= On 9 January 1914, Seeadler departed East Africa for the last time, bound for Germany. She had spent nearly thirteen and a half years abroad, the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship. Her replacement, her sister , had not yet arrived but was en route. Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January, and arrived in Kiel on 18 March. She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned. On 6 May 1914, she was reclassified as a gunboat. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since she was no longer fit for active service. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and anchored in the outer roadstead. On 19 April 1917, her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven. The explosion destroyed the ship, but there were no casualties; her wreck was never raised.

The Sword of Damocles was created in 1968 by computer scientist Ivan Sutherland with the help of his students Bob Sproull, Quintin Foster, and Danny Cohen. Before he began working toward what he termed \\"the ultimate display\\", Ivan Sutherland was already well respected for his accomplishments in computer graphics (see Sketchpad). At MIT's Lincoln Laboratory beginning in 1966, Sutherland and his colleagues performed what are widely believed to be the first experiments with head-mounted displays of different kinds.  Features  The device was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe rooms. Sutherland's system displayed output from a computer program in the stereoscopic display. The perspective that the software showed the user would depend on the position of the user's gaze‚Äîwhich is why head tracking was necessary. The HMD had to be attached to a mechanical arm suspended from the ceiling of the lab partially due to its weight, and primarily to track head movements via linkages. The formidable appearance of the mechanism inspired its name. While using The Sword of Damocles, a user had to have his or her head securely fastened into the device to perform the experiments. At this time, the various components being tested were not fully integrated with one another.  Development  When Sutherland moved to the University of Utah in the late 1960s, work on integrating the various components into a single HMD system was begun. By the end of the decade, the first fully functional integrated HMD system was operational. The first display application was a cube suspended in the air in front of the user. The system itself consisted of six subsystems: a clipping divider, matrix multiplier, vector generator, headset, head position sensor, and a general- purpose computer‚Äîwhich would make these the components of the first virtual reality machine as we know them today. The unit was partially see-through, so the users were not completely cut off from their surroundings. This translucence combined with the other features in their infancy is why the system is often cited as a precursor to augmented reality technology as well.  Alleged predecessors  = Philco HMD = Kalawsky contends that the first HMD fieldwork was conducted by Philco in 1961. Their system used a head mounted display to monitor conditions in another room, using magnetic tracking to monitor the user's head movements. The Philco HMD displayed actual video from a remotely mounted camera. The position of the camera was moved according to the tracked head movements, creating a sense of telepresence. = Bell System = In 1963, Bell Helicopter company in Fort Worth, Texas experimented with a pilot controlled night vision system. The servo-controlled remote viewing device employed a headset displaying an augmented view of the ground for the pilot via an infrared camera mounted under the helicopter.

The name was coined as its original describer concluded it was special because the nose-horn was not a separate bone, however further analysis revealed this was based on a misunderstanding. It lived during the latest Campanian/earliest Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous, predating its famous relative Triceratops by a few million years, although it was contemporary with Anchiceratops. Its remains have been found in Canada. Discoveries and species Described by William Arthur Parks in 1925, Arrhinoceratops is known from a partially crushed, slightly distorted skull which lacked the lower jaws. The remains were collected from the Neill's Ranch site, along the Red Deer River in Alberta by a 1923 expedition from the University of Toronto.Parks, W.A. (1925). \\"Arrhinoceratops brachyops, a new genus and species of Ceratopsia from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta\\". University of Toronto Studies, Geology Series 19:1-15 Parks named the type species Arrhinoceratops brachyops. The generic name is derived from Greek Œ±~, \\"without\\", ·ø•ŒØœÇ, rhis, \\"nose\\", Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ, keras, \\"horn\\", and ·Ω§œà, ops, \\"face\\" as Parks had established that no separate nose-horn was present. The specific name means \\"short-faced\\" from Greek Œ≤œÅŒ±œáœçœÇ, brachys, \\"short\\". The holotype is ROM 796 (earlier ROM 5135), which was found in a layer of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation dating from the latest Campanian or perhaps earliest Maastrichtian. It consists of the original skull. Other material from Utah, found in the 1930s, was posthumously named Arrhinoceratops? utahensis by Charles Whitney Gilmore in 1946. It is based on holotype USNM 15583. The question mark indicates that Gilmore himself had doubts about the identification.C.W. Gilmore, 1946, \\"Reptilian fauna of the North Horn Formation of central Utah\\", United States Department of the Interior Geological Survey Professional Paper 210-C: 29-53 In 1976, Douglas A. Lawson transferred the species to Torosaurus, as a Torosaurus utahensis.D.A.

Apart from the holotype skull little fossil material of Arrhinoceratops brachyops has been found.

Carpenter (ed.), Horns and Beaks: Ceratopsian and Ornithopod Dinosaurs, Bloomington, Indiana University Press Description Restoration Since this dinosaur is known only from its skull, scientists have few data about its overall anatomy. The skull, as restored, features a broad, square, neck frill with two oval shaped openings. The frill is deeply veined on both the top and the underside by arterial grooves. The sides of the frill are adorned by about nine osteoderms. The rear edge of the frill is lightly scalloped. The left squamosal in the frill side of the holotype shows a pathological opening, perhaps the result of a wound. Its brow horns were moderately long, but its nose horn was shorter and blunter than most ceratopids. The snout is short and high. Its body is assumed to be typical of the Ceratopsidae. Based on the skull some popular-science books estimate the body length to be long when fully grown. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at , its weight at .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 267 Already Richard Swann Lull had in 1933 been politely critical of Parks' original description,R.S. Lull, 1933, \\"A revision of the Ceratopsia or horned dinosaurs\\", Memoirs of the Peabody Museum of Natural History 3(3): 1-175 and Tyson discovered that Parks, an entomologist, had made many mistakes. The most notable of these was that the very trait the genus was named after, the lack of a separate ossification or os epinasale for the nose-horn, is in fact normal for the ceratopids, in which group this horn is an outgrowth of the nasal bone, not a distinct element. Other incorrect observations by Parks included the conclusion that the os rostrale, the bone core of the upper beak, directly touched the nasals instead of being separated from them by the premaxillae; a presumed anterior process of the jugal touching the premaxilla; and thinking that the interparietal bar of the frill presented a separate skeletal element, an os interparietale. Phylogeny Arrhinoceratops was by Parks placed within the Ceratopsia (this name is Ancient Greek for \\"horned faces\\"), a group of herbivorous dinosaurs with parrot-like beaks which thrived in North America and Asia during the Cretaceous Period, which ended roughly 66 million years ago. In 1930 Lori Russell refined this to the Ceratopsidae.L.S. Russell, 1930, \\"Upper Cretaceous dinosaur faunas of North America\\", Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 69(4): 133-159 Tyson concluded it was closely related to Torosaurus, probably even its direct ancestor.\\"Arrhinoceratops.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J.

Restoration of the head The following cladogram shows the phylogeny of Arrhinoceratops according to a study by Scott Sampson e.a. in 2010. Paleobiology Arrhinoceratops lived in a wet coast- land with warm summers but cool winters. It was likely preyed upon by Albertosaurus. Arrhinoceratops, like all ceratopsians, was a herbivore. During the Cretaceous, flowering plants were \\"geographically limited on the landscape\\", and so it is likely that this dinosaur fed on the predominant plants of the era: ferns, cycads and conifers. It would have used its sharp ceratopsian beak to bite off the leaves or needles. Its habitat was densely forested. See also * Timeline of ceratopsian research Footnotes References * Dodson, P.

Titus played high school football but quit because he was too small. He also wrestled.  Career  When Titus graduated from high school, he was 5'6\\" and 140 lbs. By the age of 21, he was 5'8\\" and 185 lbs. Once he started seeing good results from weight training, he decided to become a bodybuilder. Titus's first bodybuilding show was the 1988 Houston Bodybuilding Championships in which he won the Men's Open middleweight class and the overall title.  Criminal convictions  In April 1995 in Louisiana, Titus pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute ecstasy, and was sentenced to 16 months' house arrest via monitoring with an electronic anklet. In July 1997, Titus was sentenced to 21 months in prison for violating his probation by using anabolic steroids. In December 2005, Titus and his wife Kelly Ryan were implicated in the death of Melissa James, their personal assistant, in Las Vegas, Nevada. Titus admitted to an affair with James. After fleeing cross-country, the couple was arrested in Stoughton, Massachusetts. In February 2006, after being extradited to Nevada from Boston, Titus and Ryan were denied bail. On March 29, both pleaded not guilty to a felony charge for killing their live-in assistant. The charge carried the possibility of the death penalty. Despite previous statements asserting their innocence, both Titus and Ryan pleaded guilty to various charges on May 30, 2008, just days before their murder trial was set to begin in Las Vegas. On August 22, 2008, Titus was convicted of second-degree murder, kidnapping and arson. He was sentenced to 21 to 55 years in prison. Ryan was sentenced to two consecutive terms of 3‚Äì13 years in prison. Anthony Gross, also charged as an accomplice in the crime, pleaded guilty in February 2009 and received probation. With time served from the date of capture, Craig Titus is eligible for parole release on December 23, 2026, when he will be 59 years old.

The exact placement of Bahariasaurus is uncertain, although it has been variously assigned to several theropod groups, including Carcharodontosauridae (by Rauhut in 1995) and Tyrannosauroidea (by Chure in 2000). It is potentially synonymous with Deltadromeus, another theropod from the early Late Cretaceous of North Africa, if so, this would possibly make it the largest ceratosaur.Holtz, Thomas R.

Go.com includes content from ABC News, which is owned by Walt Disney Television and is hosted under a .go.com name. Along with Time Warner's Pathfinder.com, Go.com proved to be an expensive failure for its parent company, as web users largely preferred to use search engines to access content directly, rather than using directories.

In January 1998, Disney registered Go.com. source: CNet News.com, http://www.news.cnet.com/ Infoseek and Disney Interactive Media Group joint ventured in developing the Go Network, an internet portal. Go.com was launched in January 1999 as a portal with content from ABCNews.com, ESPN.com and Disney. With Disney's purchase of the remainder of Infoseek in July 1999, the Go Network, Infoseek, the Disney Catalog, Disney Online (Disney.com and DisneyStore.com), ABC News Internet Ventures, ESPN Internet Ventures, and Buena Vista Internet Group were merged into the Go.com company; the company was 72% Disney-owned, with the other outstanding ownership in a tracking stock. In October 1999, the Go Guides program, a user-edited directory like DMOZ, was launched. In January 2000, Go.com was forced to abandon its original stoplight logo because of a complaint of similar-looking logos filed by GoTo.com. Concurrently, Go.com company officials announced it was shifting from a general appeal portal to featuring entertainment content. A court later ruled that Go.com had to pay $21.5 million in damages to GoTo.com. However, in January 2001, Disney announced that it would be closing Go.com and its search engine, laying off approximately 400 employees and retiring the go.com tracking stock. Also announced was the closing of Go.com's volunteer-edited directory. With the closing, some volunteers created, or migrated to, offshoot directories including JoeAnt, Goguides.org, and Skaffe.com. In March 2001, Go.com dropped its internal search engine in favor of GoTo.com search results. Current status Despite its announcement, Go.com never ceased operations. Instead, in March 2001, the site ended its search engine and switched to a search engine provided by goto.com, whose parent, Inktomi, was eventually purchased by Yahoo!. As of January 21, 2016, some of Disney's sites, including ABC's network and news divisions and Disney's cable networks continue to be hosted on the go.com domain, although a base address is used for branding and simplicity purposes; for example, the website for Freeform redirects to freeform.go.com. Go.com terminated its email service on August 31, 2010. In 2013, Disney retired the Go.com logo and branding, turning the domain into a Disney-branded landing page without a search engine. The properties of Disney Interactive then began the process of moving the connection of user accounts off from depending on the Go.com domain to a different type of system not dependent solely on one domain. Throughout 2014 and 2015, the ABC Owned Television Stations began to move to only using their on-air domains, mainly for social media considerations.

He was the son of Adelbert Ames and grandson of Benjamin Franklin Butler, both decorated generals in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Born in Lowell, Massachusetts, Ames attended the public schools and Phillips Exeter Academy, in Exeter, New Hampshire, and graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1894. He resigned from the United States Army after appointment as second lieutenant to the Eleventh Regiment, United States Infantry; took a postgraduate course at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a member of Theta Xi fraternity, and graduated in 1896 as a mechanical and electrical engineer. Ames engaged in manufacturing; served as a member of the common council of Lowell in 1896; like his father, he re-joined the Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and was commissioned lieutenant and adjutant of the Sixth Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry; appointed acting engineer officer of the Second Army Corps under General Graham, in addition to his duties as adjutant. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in August 1898; served as civil administrator of the Arecibo district of Puerto Rico until November 1898. Ames' former residence in Washington, D.C. Ames became a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives 1897‚Äì1899; elected as a Republican to the Fifty-eighth and to the four succeeding Congresses (March 4, 1903 ‚Äì March 3, 1913); was not a candidate for renomination in 1912; resumed manufacturing pursuits; president of United States Cartridge Company, and treasurer of Heinze Electrical Co. of Lowell; at time of death was treasurer and a director of Wamesit Power Co. of Lowell, Massachusetts; director of Union Land and Grazing Co., Colorado Springs, Colorado, and vice president and a director of Ames Textile in Lowell. Ames was completely taken with Villa del Balbianello when he visited Europe for the first time in 1911, and he determined to purchase the Villa. Ames almost lost the Villa to Prince Eithel-Friedrich, the Kaiser‚Äôs youngest son, in 1914. The Villa did not sell to Eithel-Friedrich due to an Italian law stating that as the Villa was one of the art monuments of Italy, they had the right to be the preferred purchaser at that price. Ames won his battle in 1919, beautifully restoring the Villa. On a Dictaphone Tape he tells the story (also a short autobiography). The Tape was transcribed, and his greater family published it in book form: \\"Butler Ames and the Villa Balbianello, Lake Como, Italy, An American Oral History.\\" Essays and introductions by Evelyn Ames, Pauline Ames Plimpton, Ezio Antonini, Sarah and George Plimpton plus period photographs and the illustrated Guest Book 1920 to 1970 was added.

Education She graduated with a law degree from the University of Athens Law School. Kanelli also learned to speak several foreign languages. Apart from Greek, Kanelli is also fluent in three foreign languages: English, French and Italian. Career = Journalism and television = In 1973, starting her career in journalism, she was acclaimed by Prime Minister Constantine Karamanlis as the \\"kid of New Democracy\\", a designation she herself denied a while later. In the next decades Kanelli worked as a daily columnist, a reporter at home and abroad, a news anchor and television presenter, host and interviewer. She also worked as a radio host and presenter. Often playing the role of media polemicist, she is noted for her forthright, irreverent, incisive and arrogant style which is criticized by her detractors and applauded by her supporters.  Liana  In 1992 she was given her own self-titled talk show Liana, (also called Liana K. in Greek language rebroadcasts outside of Greece). The show was widely popular and gained her much notoriety in Greece and surrounding Greek-speaking regions (such as North Macedonia and southern Albania) , though it lasted only one year, due largely to some of the controversial views she presented. After the show was canceled it remained quite popular through the practice of underground tape trading in Eastern Europe. The trading of pirated videos and music had become quite commonplace throughout the 1980s and 1990s as so many western films were outlawed in Eastern Bloc nations (as seen in the documentary Chuck Norris vs. Communism). =Politics= In 1999, Kanelli announced from the podium of a rally protesting the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia that she would run as a candidate for the Communist Party of Greece for the European Parliament. In the 2000 national election she was elected as a Member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens' first electoral district, a seat she has successfully held by being re-elected in every election since (2004, 2007 and 2009). While sitting in Parliament, Kanelli continues to work as journalist with more than 35 years of professional experience in newspaper, radio and television media. She is currently the editor of Greece's communist newspaper Rizospastis. She has also been elected to the boards of several of Greece's leading journalists' unions.  Defense of Milosevic (2004)  Liana Kanelli, a member of the International Committee for the Defense of Milosevic, testified at the Trial of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in October 2004. She attacked the United States and their allies, calling them \\"neo-nazis\\" and blaming them for the death of many innocent civilians. She also claimed Milo≈°eviƒá would be with the \\"winners\\" instead of the \\"defeated\\" if he had cooperated more with western leaders.  On-air assault (2012)  In June 2012, during a live talk show, Kanelli was struck three times in the shoulders and the face by Golden Dawn spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, a former army Special forces officer with a checkered criminal past. Kanelli pushed him away after Kasidiaris threw water across the news desk at another guest, and a warrant was issued for Kasidiaris' arrest immediately following the on air incident. The show stopped broadcasting after the melee, at which time, according to Kanelli, Kasidiaris was forced into a room and the door was closed and locked, but that before police could arrive he broke the door down and fled the scene. According to Greek law, such a warrant must be served by police within 24 hours. Following the shocking incident, which gained international attention, Golden Dawn claimed Kanelli assaulted Kasidiaris first by throwing a packet of documents into his face.  Al Jazeera interview (2013)  Kanelli has been an outspoken opponent of Greek's entry into the European Union and adoption of the Euro as a currency. In an October 2013 interview with Al Jazeera's Empire program in Athens she caused a stir by stating that Brussels and Berlin had utilized \\"imposing and blackmailing politics\\" to mislead Greece into accepting the currency. = Author = Kanelli has written three books: ‚ÄúThoughts‚Äù, ‚ÄúFunction of Oaths‚Äù and ‚ÄúRwanda‚Äù. She also established NEMECIS magazine in 1997.  Humanitarian efforts and awards  A member of EEDYE (Greek Committee for International Peace and Detente), Kanelli has been awarded by various associations and organizations as a journalist and politician for her social and anti-racist efforts. This includes the National Silver Medal presented to her in 2015 by Serbian President Tomislav Nikoliƒá for \\"exceptional merits in public and cultural activities\\". She also visited Armenia in 2016 to promote peace in the region with Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, blaming \\"capitalist rivalries\\" for previous bloodshed there.

In the mid-1970s, he was a member of the short-lived group Mallard, formed by ex- members of Captain Beefheart's Magic Band. He is also known as a composer and has recorded solo albums. He was also a member of the Texas group Blackwell, who had a hit single in 1969 entitled \\"Wonderful\\". Biography =Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit= In 1971, \\"Brass Rabbit\\" recorded and wrote five tracks for the album Kossoff Kirke Tetsu Rabbit with guitarist Paul Kossoff, drummer Simon Kirke and bassist Tetsu Yamauchi. =Johnny Nash and Bob Marley= Bundrick toured and recorded with Texan vocalist Johnny Nash. Bundrick played on Nash's hit single and album \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" (1972). He met Bob Marley while in Sweden, while working on the soundtrack to the Swedish film Vill s√• g√§rna tro. Marley, Bundrick, and Johnny Nash became roommates there during the stay. Sometime after their return to London, Bundrick was brought in to collaborate on arrangements for Marley's Catch a Fire album, adding keyboards to the original Jamaican recordings to make the record more accessible to listeners. Around this time, Bundrick also worked with Chris Blackwell of Island Records, appearing on recordings by the company. =Free= In 1972 the members of Free reformed joined by Bundrick on keyboards. They recorded Free's final album Heartbreaker, which included \\"Muddy Water\\" and \\"Common Mortal Man\\" by Bundrick, who was also credited for collaborations on two other tracks. After a brief period of touring Free broke up. =Pete Townshend and The Who= The Who in 2007; L to R ‚Äì drummer Zak Starkey, Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend and John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick Bundrick first worked with Pete Townshend in 1977 when he performed on Rough Mix, Townshend's solo collaboration with Ronnie Lane, former bass player for Small Faces and Faces. He was invited to play on the Who's album Who Are You (1978), but broke his arm falling out of a taxi at the studio door and was unable to participate in recording sessions. Bundrick toured with The Who from 1979 to 1981 along with drummer Kenney Jones and played on their album Face Dances (1981), then briefly parted with the band during the recording of It's Hard (1982) and the subsequent tour. Bundrick later rejoined the band performing with them at Live Aid in 1985 and played live with them until 2012. Bundrick played on the Who's single \\"Real Good Looking Boy\\" and \\"Old Red Wine\\" in 2004, and on their album Endless Wire (2006) and joined the band for The Who Tour 2006‚Äì2007, appearing in the summer and fall concerts. He missed the start of the second leg of the North American tour due to the illness of his wife Sue; keyboard technician Brian Kehew took keyboard duties. Townshend said at the time that Sue was \\"very close to the end, and [Rabbit] will be back with us when she's gone\\". =2008‚Äìpresent= In the spring of 2008, Bundrick married Canadian Jody Ahern. On July 12, 2008, he performed at the recording of VH1 Honors The Who in Los Angeles. He then worked with English alternative folk band Small Engine Repair and played on their track \\"This Whole Setup Is A Lie\\". In December 2009, it was announced he was working with the band Night Parade on their new album. Bundrick performed with the Who for their Super Bowl XLIV halftime show in 2010. He played with the group in 2011 at a charity show but was replaced in the subsequent tours. Pete Townshend has commented that there \\".. was an issue between Roger Daltrey and Rabbit.\\" Selected discography *1971 Kossoff Kirke Tetsu Rabbit *1972 Johnny Nash ‚Äì I Can See Clearly Now *1972 Sandy Denny ‚Äì Sandy *1973 Free ‚Äì Heartbreaker *1973 Paul Kossoff ‚Äì Back Street Crawler *1973 John Martyn ‚Äì Solid Air *1973 Bundrick ‚Äì Broken Arrows *1973 Donovan ‚Äì Cosmic Wheels *1974 Bundrick ‚Äì Dark Saloon *1974 Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Nico, Eno ‚Äì June 1, 1974 *1974 Bryn Haworth ‚Äì Let the Days Go By *1975 The Rocky Horror Picture Show *1975 Jim Capaldi ‚Äì Short Cut Draw Blood *1975 Andy Fairweather Low ‚Äì La Booga Rooga *1977 Joan Armatrading ‚Äì Show Some Emotion *1977 Eric Burdon ‚Äì Survivor *1977 Townshend & Lane ‚Äì Rough Mix *1979 The Only Ones ‚Äì Special View *1980 Pete Townshend ‚Äì Empty Glass *1981 The Who ‚Äì Face Dances *1985 Deep End ‚Äì Deep End Live! *1988 Bundrick ‚Äì Dream Jungle *1992 Roger Waters ‚Äì Amused to Death *1998 Fairport Convention ‚Äì Cropredy 98 *2006 The Who ‚Äì Endless Wire *2007 Mick Jagger ‚Äì The Very Best of Mick Jagger (Deluxe Edition) *2015 208 Talks of Angels ‚Äì Made in Hell *2017 The Puss Puss Band - Echoes Across the Cruel Sea *2019 Neil Hamburger - Still Dwelling References External links *www.rabbitwho.com 1948 births Living people American rock keyboardists American organists English rock keyboardists English organists British male organists People from Houston People from Finchley Island Records artists American expatriates in the United Kingdom Free (band) members Back Street Crawler (band) members 21st-century American keyboardists 21st-century organists 20th-century American keyboardists ","title":"John Bundrick"},{"id":"3534505","text":"Cetiosauriscus ( ) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived between 166 and 164 million years ago during the Callovian (Middle Jurassic Period) in what is now England. A herbivore, Cetiosauriscus had‚Äîfor sauropod standards‚Äîa moderately long tail, and longer forelimbs, making them as long as its hindlimbs. It has been estimated as about long and between in weight. The only known fossil that was later named Cetiosauriscus includes most of the rear half of a skeleton as well as a hindlimb (NHMUK R3078). Found in Cambridgeshire in the 1890s, it was described by Arthur Smith Woodward in 1905 as a new specimen of the species Cetiosaurus leedsi. This was changed in 1927, when Friedrich von Huene found NHMUK R3078 and the C. leedsi type specimen to be too different from Cetiosaurus, warranting its own genus, which he named Cetiosauriscus, meaning \\"Cetiosaurus-like\\". Cetiosauriscus leedsi was referred to the sauropod family Diplodocidae because of similarities in the tail and foot, and had the dubious or intermediate species \\"Cetiosauriscus\\" greppini, \\"C.\\" longus, and \\"C.\\" glymptonensis assigned to it. In 1980, Alan Charig named a new species of Cetiosauriscus for NHMUK R3078 because of the lack of comparable material to the type of C. leedsi; this species was named Cetiosauriscus stewarti. Because of the poor state of preservation of the Cetiosauriscus leedsi fossil, Charig sent a petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to instead make C. stewarti the type species. Cetiosauriscus stewarti became the oldest confirmed diplodocid until a phylogenetic analysis published in 2003 instead found the species to belong to Mamenchisauridae, and followed by studies in 2005 and 2015 that found it outside Neosauropoda, while not a mamenchisaurid proper. Cetiosauriscus was found in the marine deposits of the Oxford Clay Formation alongside many different invertebrate groups, marine ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs and crocodylians, a single pterosaur, and various dinosaurs: the ankylosaur Sarcolestes, the stegosaurs Lexovisaurus and Loricatosaurus, the ornithopod Callovosaurus, as well as some unnamed taxa. The theropods Eustreptospondylus and Metriacanthosaurus are known from the formation, although probably not from the same level as Cetiosauriscus. History of discovery =Background= Fossil limbs and vertebrae of Cetiosaurus oxoniensis The fossil later known as Cetiosauriscus was originally ascribed to the genus Cetiosaurus‚Äîone of the first sauropods to be named, in 1842 by palaeontologist Richard Owen, and one with a complicated history due to many unfounded referrals of species and specimens, involving almost all English sauropod specimens. The type species of Cetiosaurus has changed throughout history because of incomplete remains and the taxon's significance, and many aspects of its anatomy and relationships are still uncertain. Cetiosaurus was originally named to include C. medius, C. brevis, C. brachyurus and C. longus, which span from the Middle Jurassic to the Early Cretaceous of various localities across England. As none of these species are truly diagnostic, and Cetiosaurus is a historically and taxonomically important taxon, the more complete Middle Jurassic species C. oxoniensis named by geologist John Phillips in 1871 became the type species. C. glymptonensis was also named in the same publication by Phillips, but is less complete and of a questionable validity. Lectotype dorsal vertebra of Ornithopsis hulkei Another English taxon, Ornithopsis hulkei, was named in 1870 by palaeontologist Harry Govier Seeley for vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous Wessex Formation, younger than the existing species of Cetiosaurus. Seeley considered Ornithopsis to be closely related to Cetiosaurus, but different due to the internal bone structure. An additional species, Ornithopsis leedsii was named in 1887 by John Hulke for a pelvis, vertebrae and ribs collected by Alfred Nicholson Leeds, an English farmer and amateur fossil collector who throughout his life compiled numerous collections of fossils from the Oxford Clay. O. leedsii, from the Late Jurassic, showed similarities to older Cetiosaurus oxoniensis as well as younger O. hulkei. It was described in more detail by Seeley in 1889, where he considered O. hulkei, C. oxoniensis and O. leedsii to all be in the same genus, bearing the name Cetiosaurus. But naturalist Richard Lydekker discussed with Seeley, before the publication of Seeley's 1889 paper, that Cetiosaurus and Ornithopsis were not the same taxon. Lydekker suggested that Wealden fossils (including O. hulkei) belonged to Ornithopsis and the Jurassic remains (including O. leedsii and C. oxoniensis) to Cetiosaurus. Lydekker in 1895 changed his mind and referred the species O. leedsii to Pelorosaurus (known already from the species P. brevis, once named Cetiosaurus brevis)‚Äîas P. leedsi‚Äîand referred the genus to Atlantosauridae. Lydekker's classification of the species was not supported by later authors like palaeontologist Arthur Smith Woodward in 1905, who followed Seeley's classification scheme. =Discovery and naming= The sauropod fossil today known as Cetiosauriscus stewarti was discovered in May 1898 by clay workers in the area around Fletton to the south of Peterborough and east of the Great Northern Railway. Pits in this region expose the fossil-rich sedimentary rocks of the marine Oxford Clay, which is of middle Callovian age and today regarded as one of the classic geological formations of British palaeontology. The sauropod fossil possibly stems from NPBCL pit No.1, which was the northernmost pit operated by the New Peterborough Brick Company Limited, and which produced the most vertebrate fossils. The discovery was brought to the attention of Leeds, who, after excavation, took the sauropod specimen to Eyebury, the Leeds' family home. In mid-August, after some cleaning and repairing of the specimen, geologist Henry Woodward visited Eyebury and produced a life-sized drawing of the remains for presentation at the British Association for the Advancement of Science Meeting. Following this presentation, on 17 August 1898, Henry Woodward returned with American palaeontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, who considered the sauropod to be closely related to the North American taxon Diplodocus. Alfred Leeds offered the sauropod to the British Museum of Natural History (BMNH, now abbreviated as NHMUK) for ¬£250, which would equate to about ¬£30,529 in 2017. The NHMUK had earlier in 1890 and 1892 bought the First and Second Collections of Alfred Leeds, respectively. Woodward, Keeper of Geology at the NHMUK, had \\"great pleasure\\" to recommend to the Trustees of the NHMUK the fossil be purchased. The purchase was sanctioned on 25 February 1899, along with the purchase of assorted other remains for just over ¬£357 (~¬£43,596 now), where the Leeds sauropod gained the accession number BMNH R3078 (now NHMUK R3078). Known elements of Cetiosauriscus The amount of material made NHMUK R3078 the most complete sauropod specimen from the United Kingdom, comparable only later to the \\"Rutland Dinosaur\\" (referred to Cetiosaurus) discovered in 1967. Known regions of the specimen include the forelimb, hindlimb and vertebral column. The forelimb lacks the manus (hand) and part of the radius and ulna, although the hindlimb lacks only a few bones in the pes (foot) and fragments of the tibia, fibula and ilium. The vertebrae known are four parts of dorsal vertebrae, the neural spines of the sacrum, multiple anterior caudal vertebrae (tail bones), and a series of 27 nearly complete vertebrae from the middle of the tail with associated or articulated chevrons (ribs along the underside of the tail), although the vertebral series is not continuous. A tail tip (NHMUK R1967) from the same locality, but a different individual was thought by palaeontologist Alan Charig in 1980 to belong to Cetiosauriscus. The assignment of NHMUK R1967 to Cetiosauriscus was considered unlikely in alternate studies by palaeontologists Friedrich von Huene, Paul Upchurch and Darren Naish because of the lack of overlap and uncertain phylogenetic positions. In 1903, the skeleton was mounted as preserved in the British Museum, so it could be more easily compared with other mounted sauropods from North America. The mount of Cetiosauriscus was put on display just prior to the cast skeleton of Diplodocus, and was displayed with the dorsal vertebrae NHMUK R1984 and some isolated teeth from a camarasaurid (possibly referable to Cetiosauriscus), making it the first sauropod skeleton mounted in the United Kingdom. NHMUK R3078 was referred in 1905 by Arthur Woodward to the species Cetiosaurus leedsi, as it was from the same geologic formation as other specimens that were assigned to C. leedsii. Woodward also referred the dorsal vertebrae NHMUK R1984 and the tail tip NHMUK R1967 to the species. In 1927, Huene briefly described the anatomy of the species C. leedsii, where he noted that it shared many similarities with Haplocanthosaurus and was most likely between Cetiosaurus proper and the former genus. For this reason, Huene proposed the new genus name Cetiosauriscus for the species. To the genus he referred the specimens NHMUK R1984‚ÄìR1988 and NHMUK R3078. =Misassigned species= Caudal vertebra of \\"Cetiosauriscus\\" longus (now Eusauropoda indet.) seen from in front, above, the side, and cross section Huene (1927) assigned \\"Ornithopsis\\" greppini, which he had named in 1922, to the genus Cetiosauriscus. The known material, discovered in Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) deposits in the Reuchenette Formation of Switzerland, includes dorsal and caudal vertebrae, forelimb bones and a hindlimb and partial pes, from at least two individuals. The long humerus was built like Cetiosauriscus stewarti (C. leedsi of von Huene's 1927 usage), and the two species were originally distinguished from Cetiosaurus by having shorter dorsal vertebrae, a shorter forelimb, and a longer lower leg.Huene, F. V. (1927a). Short review of the present knowledge of the Sauropoda. Memoirs of the Queensland Museum,9, 121‚Äì126. The similarities like the anatomy of the caudal vertebrae were suggested by Christian Meyer and Basil Th√ºring in 2003 to support referral of greppini to Cetiosauriscus. However, Weishampel et al. (2004) and Whitlock (2011) considered \\"Cetiosauriscus\\" greppini to be Eusauropoda incertae sedis, while Hofer (2005) and Schwarz et al. (2007) concluded that \\"Cetiosauriscus\\" greppini represents an unnamed genus of basal eusauropod.Hofer, C. (2005).

Swiss J Geosci 113, 2 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s00015-020-00355-5 The species Cetiosaurus longus, named in 1842 by Owen, was referred to the genus Cetiosauriscus without comment by sauropod palaeontologist John Stanton McIntosh in 1990. Material the species was named for included a dorsal and caudal vertebrae from the Portland Stone of Garsington, Oxfordshire, two other caudal vertebrae from the same deposit of nearby Thame, and a single vertebra and some metatarsals originally named Cetiosaurus epioolithicus (an invalid nomen nudum), although the material from Garsington has been lost since its description. One of the vertebrae (OUMNH J13871) may instead be a cervical, as it has one mildly convex and one concave articular face. Characterised as having uniquely elongate vertebral centra (body of the vertebra), C. longus is not a diagnostic taxon. As it lacks any diagnostic features of Cetiosauriscus, the species should be referred to by its original designation, Cetiosaurus longus. Cetiosaurus glymptonensis, named on the basis of nine middle-distal caudal centra from the Forest Marble Formation of Oxfordshire, England, was referred to Cetiosauriscus by McIntosh in 1990. These caudal vertebrae were considered to be more elongate than those of Cetiosaurus oxoniensis, but caudal length proportions vary significantly throughout the tail and in different taxa, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus and Cetiosauriscus having similarly elongate caudal vertebrae. The more anterior caudals have a large ridge two-thirds up the centrum and a smaller ridge one-third up. These ridges are similar to the middle caudals of Cetiosauriscus, but are absent in caudals of the same size and proportions, and because of this difference the species was concluded to be separate from Cetiosauriscus by Upchurch and Martin in 2003. \\"Cetiosaurus\\" glymptonensis is considered to be Eusauropoda incertae sedis by Upchurch and Martin (2003), Weishampel and colleagues (2004) and Whitlock (2011), and is in need of a new genus name because it has a single diagnostic feature, the lateral ridges. Forelimb of Cetiosauriscus in front and top views In 1980, Charig described a specimen of indeterminate diplodocid from the Early Cretaceous of England, and re-examined the holotype of Cetiosauriscus leedsii to compare its characteristics. In this publication he confirmed that the ilium of the holotype of C. leedsi, NHMUK R1988, was too incomplete to be compared to the also incomplete ilium of the referred specimen NHMUK R3078. Because of the lack of overlap the referral of NHMUK R3078 to Cetiosauriscus leedsii was no longer verifiable, so Charig named the new species Cetiosauriscus stewarti for NHMUK R3078. The specific name was chosen to honour Sir Ronald Stewart, the chairman of the London Brick Company that owned the clay pit the fossils had been found in. Furthermore, Charig considered Cetiosauriscus leedsii and Cetiosauriscus greppini to be dubious taxa, making C. stewarti the only valid species within Cetiosauriscus. Because of the invalidity of the type species C. leedsii, Charig made a petition to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) in 1993 to designate Cetiosauriscus stewarti as the type species of its genus, being the taxon containing the specimen Huene had originally named the genus for and distinguished from Cetiosaurus, and also a taxonomically more stable name. This was accepted by the ICZN in 1995, making Cetiosauriscus stewarti the type species of Cetiosauriscus. The only specimen that can confidently be assigned to C. stewarti is the holotype NHMUK R3078, although it is possible that isolated teeth from the Oxford Clay could be from the taxon. Description A diagram showing the possible size of Cetiosauriscus compared to humans Cetiosauriscus was a moderately sized, quadrupedal eusauropod. It had a moderately long tail, and relatively long arms making the shoulders level with the hips. Cetiosauriscus was approximately long based on the known skeleton, comparable to possible relatives like long Cetiosaurus, and long Patagosaurus. The weight of Cetiosauriscus is less certain, depending on its phylogenetic placement. Restored as a diplodocid, Cetiosauriscus was estimated by Paul (2010) as , but restored as a cetiosaur it was estimated by Paul (2016) as . =Vertebrae= Posterior dorsal vertebra in rear and side views The dorsal vertebrae of NHMUK R3078 are incomplete or fragmentary. A partial anterior dorsal is known from a single centrum, which is about as long as wide, with a strong anterior articular ball (an opisthocoelous condition). On the lateral surfaces (sides) of the centrum there are deep but small pleurocoels (depressions in the sides of vertebrae for air sacs). A single middle dorsal centrum is preserved, being slightly smaller than the anterior dorsal. The pleurocoel is more elongate, but like the anterior dorsal there is no ventral (underside) concavity. A posterior dorsal is also known and is probably the last dorsal before the sacrum (vertebrae between the pelves). It preserves the entire centrum and most of the neural arch, and is significantly shortened in length compared to the other dorsals, although it is about as wide across as tall. A shallow pleurocoel is also present, but is placed higher on the side of the centrum and disappears into the neural arch. Unlike the anterior dorsal, the posterior dorsal is only very slightly opisthocoelous. A tall and narrow hyposphene (thin vertical ridge below the anterior processes of the arch, providing additional vertebral articulation) is present and well expanded off the arch. A single dorsal neural spine is also preserved. It is flattened and not tall, with a narrowed tip, and the only noticeable laminae present are the spinopostzygapophyseal laminae running down the rear corners of the spine to the postzygapophyses. This is unlike most diplodocoids where there are many laminar running along the length of the spines. Four neural spines of the sacrum are preserved, three of which form a single plate and the fourth of which is separate, like in Diplodocus. Fourth caudal vertebra in front and side views Of the anterior four caudal vertebrae, the anteriormost two are highly incomplete. Both the short, but wider-than-tall, centra preserve traces of the sideways projections (transverse processes) found in other vertebrae, which are very low on the sides compared to following caudals. The neural spines are very thin, thinning to a single ridge in front (the prespinal lamina), but having two spinopostzygapophyseal laminae like the dorsals. The fourth caudal is the most complete anterior caudal. The centrum is concave in front, but flat behind (amphiplatyan). There are no pleurocoels unlike the dorsals, and the transverse processes begin in the top half of the centrum. The centrum is long, tall and wide, with the total vertebra being tall. Anterior caudals of the Cetiosaurus leedsi specimen NHMUK R1984 are very similar to those of Cetiosauriscus, but the neural arches are not as tall in C. leedsi, and the transverse processes lack a prominent ridge along the top of them. Middle and posterior caudals from a nearly continuous series of 27 bones are well preserved in Cetiosauriscus. The later vertebrae are slightly more elongate than those in front, and slightly less concave in their anterior face. Moving towards the end of the tail the centra reduce in size and the transverse processes shrink until they are completely absent, with the neural spines becoming shorter, thinner, and more slanted. The seventh vertebrae of the series, at tall, is long, only one cm longer than the 21st of the same series that is tall. A distinguishing characteristic of Cetiosauriscus is the presence of a front-to-back concavity on the top of the anterior and middle caudal neural spines. =Appendicular skeleton= Femur of Cetiosauriscus in rear, top, and bottom views and cross sections Cetiosauriscus preserves a single right scapula (shoulder blade), which is elongate and slender. The scapula is long and wide at the middle, making it very narrow. The inner face is flat across, while the outer face is gently convex. There is no expansion of the far end of the blade. The bone thickens close to the humerus joint, where it also articulates with the coracoid. The coracoid is incomplete, but enough is preserved to show it is rectangular, and longer, at , than it is wide‚Äî. A long humerus is known, and complete with minimal crushing. The bone is short and stout, with a robust crest for the deltoid muscle along the upper half of the bone. The shape of the humerus is similar to the shortness of Neuquensaurus, although overall the forelimb is long, as in Diplodocus and Cetiosaurus, being 69% of the femur length. The distal end is roughened for a large cartilage cap as found in some other eusauropods like \\"Cetiosauriscus\\" greppini. The radius and ulna are broken, but complete they would have been long. The hindlimb of Cetiosauriscus is about the length of the forelimb. Both ilia are very fragmentary, but the two sides supplement each other to give a reasonable idea of the proportions of the complete bone. The ilium is long, and has a long and slender pubic peduncle. It is proportionally lower than in Cetiosaurus, being similar in proportions to Haplocanthosaurus and the later \\"Titanosauridae\\". The left femur is complete, but part of the shaft is eroded away. It is very slender, being tall but only wide at the middle. This very gracile femoral morphology is shared with Amphicoelias, Shunosaurus, Ligabuesaurus and a specimen of Diplodocus, being more gracile than Cetiosaurus and most other eusauropods. A prominent fourth trochanter is present, but the remaining shaft is very compressed. The tibia, fibula and pes are also preserved, but are fragmentary and disarticulated making comparisons difficult, the lower hindlimb being about upright. The foot is similar to Diplodocus and Brontosaurus, where the first toes are large and clawed, and the outer ones are small and clawless. Metatarsal III is the longest, followed by metatarsal IV, II, V and I. Metatarsal I is the widest, and the width of the bones decreases numerically. Classification Life restoration of Cetiosauriscus as a eusauropod Cetiosauriscus was originally classified by Huene as a genus in the family Cetiosauridae, within the subfamily Cardiodontidae. The subfamily, including the other taxa Cetiosaurus, Haplocanthosaurus, Dystrophaeus, Elosaurus and Rhoetosaurus, was founded upon the general basal features of elongate cervicals and shortened dorsals‚Äîboth opisthocoelous, amphicoelous caudals that are rod-shaped distally, paired sternal plates, an ilium lacking the postacetabular process (region of the ilium behind the ischium joint and acetabulum), a very wide pubis, wide distal ischium, significantly shorter forelimb than hindlimb, fibula lacking the middle muscle attachment, and long metacarpals and short metatarsals. This classification was emmended in 1932 when Huene concluded Cetiosauriscus was closer to Haplocanthosaurus than Cetiosaurus in the family, because of forelimb and hindlimb proportions. Conversely, in 1956, Alfred Romer synonymised Cetiosauriscus and Cetiosaurus, a position that has not been followed by subsequent studies on the taxon. David S. Berman and McIntosh in 1978 referred Cetiosauriscus to the family Diplodocidae along with multiple other genera; Diplodocus, Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Mamenchisaurus Dicraeosaurus and Nemegtosaurus. Like other members of the family, Cetiosauriscus possesses wing-like transverse processes, divided chevrons with forward and backward projections, the tail is \\"whiplash\\"-like, the humerus is 2/3 the length of the femur, the calcaneum is absent, metatarsal III and IV are the longest, and metatarsal I has a process on the bottom back corner. This referral would make Cetiosauriscus, known from the Callovian, the oldest diplodocid, millions of years older than Diplodocus, Barosaurus or Apatosaurus. In the paper naming Cetiosauriscus stewarti, Charig also described the chevrons of a new specimen and created the term \\"diplodociform\\" to describe them. This meant they were robust and double-beamed, as in Diplodocus and its relatives like Mamenchisaurus. Because of the similarly \\"diplodociform\\" chevrons, Charig referred Cetiosauriscus to the Diplodocidae along with the new specimen. Elaborating upon his earlier paper, McIntosh (1990) weakly referred Cetiosauriscus to the subfamily Diplodocinae, characterised by more cervicals and fewer dorsals, tall sacrum neural spines, short forelimbs, no calcaneum, metatarsals III and IV being the longest, and a small process on the distal end of metatarsal I. The subfamily also included Diplodocus, Barosaurus and Apatosaurus. In 2004 this placement was followed by Weishampel et al. without comment. A phylogenetic analysis of Cetiosauriscus was conducted in 2003 by Julia Heathcote and Upchurch, based upon the two most inclusive matrices of the time, those of Jeffrey A. Wilson (2002) and Upchurch (1995), neither of which had included the taxon in the past. Added to the analysis of Upchurch, Cetiosauriscus placed as the sister taxon of Tehuelchesaurus, in a group including Mamenchisaurus, Omeisaurus and Euhelopus, and a placement within a group of Omeisaurus and Mamenchisaurus was also found by using the Wilson matrix. Based on these two results, Heathcote and Upchurch concluded Cetiosauriscus was not a diplodocid or even within Diplodocoidea, instead being a more basal sauropod outside Neosauropoda. The phylogenetic analysis of Rauhut et al. (2005) resolved Cetiosauriscus in a clade with Omeisaurus, itself in a group with Losillasaurus and Mamenchisaurus, outside of Neosauropoda. The phylogenetic relationships of Cetiosauriscus were also tested in 2015 by Tschopp et al., as a potential diplodocid. Although the genus was found to be within Diplodocimorpha with one analysis method, it was also found outside Neosauropoda. In both, Cetiosauriscus stewarti was found to be in a clade alone with Barosaurus affinis, a dubious species known only from foot bones. Tschopp et al. concluded that Cetiosauriscus was not a diplodocid or a diplodocoid, as forcing it to be outside Neosauropoda was more parsimonious than forcing it to be within Diplodocoidea in all analyses. As the paper was only to test relationships within Diplodocidae, more solid conclusions regarding the position of Cetiosauriscus could not be made. The results of the favoured cladogram of Tschopp et al. is shown below: 1905 drawing of the mounted skeleton of Cetiosauriscus Palaeobiology Unpathologic distal caudal of ?Cetiosauriscus specimen NHMUK R1967 =Palaeopathology= The series of distal caudal vertebrae NHMUK R1967, once referred to Cetiosauriscus, is similar to the caudals of Diplodocus, with two convex ends (biconvex) and a long and thin centrum. These caudals display signs of injury at two points along the series of ten vertebrae, where there are signs of breakage that was later healed. These lesions were identified as the same form of pathologies as found on the tail of Diplodocus. It has been suggested that the biconvex distal caudal vertebrae in sauropods were used for making whip-like cracking noise, being thin and delicate and not intended for impact, as the joints would be very vulnerable to damage rendering them useless. =Palaeoecology= Life restoration of Eustreptospondylus facing Lexovisaurus in the Oxford Clay Formation environment Cetiosauriscus lived during the Callovian, an epoch in the Middle Jurassic, about 166 to 164 mya. The single specimen is known from the Lower Member of the Oxford Clay Formation, along with multiple other dinosaur genera and many other groups of animals, in the biozone of the index fossil Kosmoceras jason. The Oxford Clay Formation is a marine deposit of southern and middle England, known for the high-quality preservation of some fossils and the large diversity of taxa. Sediments are generally brownish-grey mudstone, organic-rich with plentiful crushed ammonites and bivalves, at most thick. A large diversity of flora can be seen, preserved in the form of pollen and spores. Gymnosperms are present, along with pteridophytes, unidentifiable wood fragments, other intermediate pollen, and miscellaneous organic plant material. The intermediate sauropod Ornithopsis leedsi is known from the same section of the formation as Cetiosauriscus, along with the stegosaurids Lexovisaurus durobrivensis and Loricatosaurus priscus (which are possibly synonyms), the basal ankylosaur Sarcolestes leedsi, the ornithopod Callovosaurus leedsi, and a second unnamed ornithopod taxon. Dinosaur eggs that have not yet been assigned to a taxon are also known from the Lower Oxford Clay. The theropods Eustreptospondylus and possibly Megalosaurus are also known from the Oxford Clay Formation, but slightly younger deposits (the Middle Member). In addition, the theropod Metriacanthosaurus is from an unknown level and age in the formation. Hundreds of invertebrates are known from the marine deposits, including bivalves, gastropods, scaphopods, ammonites, teuthoids, a nautiloid, foraminifera, coelenterates, bryozoans, brachiopods, annelids, crustaceans, ostracods, cirripedes and echinoderms. Fish are known from the clades Elasmobranchii, Chimaera, and Actinopterygii, and the ichthyosaur Ophthalmosaurus, the plesiosaurs Cryptoclidus, Muraenosaurus, Tricleidus, Liopleurodon, Peloneustes, Pliosaurus and Simolestes, the crocodilians Metriorhynchus and Steneosaurus, and the pterosaur Rhamphorhynchus were all present.

As a student of Benno Landsberger and Sidney Smith, his knowledge was grounded in immediate knowledge and experience that went back to the earliest years of Assyriology. Early Life and Education Hayim Tadmor was born in Harbin, Manchuria, as Hayim Frumstein. His father, David, a fur trader, relocated to Manchuria once the trans-Siberian railway had been extended, having also travelled to Canada. In 1935, after his father‚Äôs death, Hayim emigrated with his mother to Mandatory Palestine, and completed his schooling in Jerusalem while also providing for his mother, working as a tutor in Mathematics and Hebrew Grammar. In 1943 he started his studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem specialising in Classics, Jewish History of the First and Second Temple periods, and Biblical History, which he studied with Benjamin Mazar. At the same time, he served in the Haganah. Early career In 1950 he completed his MA. In 1951-1952 he obtained a British Council Scholarship to study Akkadian with Sidney Smith at the Department of Assyriology at SOAS. His doctoral dissertation submitted in 1954 elucidated biblical chronology in the light of Assyrian sources. In 1954 he travelled once more, further to specialise in Akkadian at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, studying with Benno Landsberger. He returned to Israel and took up a post at the Hebrew University, from 1958 teaching Bible and Ancient Near Eastern History. In 1965 he established the department of Assyriology at the Hebrew University, which he chaired, and which became an international centre. Research Combined specialisation in biblical history and Ancient Near Eastern History became the hallmark of Tadmor‚Äôs work. He published 57 articles mainly in Hebrew and English. His main book dealt with the Assyrian royal inscriptions of king Tiglath-pileser III, known as particularly difficult to decipher, since after their excavation in Nimrud in 1845 by A.H. Layard they were much vandalised. As early as 1963, whilst spending a sabbatical year in London, Tadmor was given access to Layard‚Äôs folio drawings at the British Museum and started reconstructing the texts. His book on the inscriptions was published in 1994. He also edited the Biblical Encyclopaedia vols. 6-8, and with Mordechai Cogan published a new translation and scholarly interpretation of the Second Book of Kings. Later career He was appointed as a professor in 1971 and was elected to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 1985. He was known for his excellent relationships with his students and numerous international collaborations, for example with students from Japan and Korea. He held visiting professorships at the universities of Yale, City University of New York, Ann Arbor, Pennsylvania, and Berkeley. Having retired in 1994, he was elected Vice-President of the Israel Academy in 1996, serving until 2004. In USA he was elected honorary member of the American Oriental Society and a Fellow of the Academy for Jewish Research. In 2000 he was awarded the Rothschild Prize for his life‚Äôs work. He received an honour from the Heilongjiang Academy of Social Sciences in Harbin. Two Festschriften appeared, one in his honour and another a joint tribute for him and his wife. Another volume was published in his memory by the Israel Academy. In 2010 his and his wife‚Äôs library was acquired by the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World of New York University, where it is available for readers. His papers are held at the Hebrew University Archive. Personal life In 1953 Tadmor married Miriam Yehieli, n√©e Skura, a fellow student and archaeologist. The couple had two children: Naomi, and David.

Its age makes it one of the oldest species of stegosaurs, living about 160 million years ago. Since it was an herbivore, scientists think that Chialingosaurus probably ate ferns and cycads, which were plentiful during the period when Chialingosaurus was alive. Discovery and species The fossils of Chialingosaurus were collected by the geologist Kuan Yaowu or Guan Yao-Wu in 1957, at Taipingstai in Quxian County, while surveying the Chialing River in southern China. The type species Chialingosaurus kuani was named and described by paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, (\\"C. C. Young\\") two years later in 1959. The generic name refers to the Chialing. The specific name honours Kuan. Chialingosaurus was the first stegosaurian described from China.C.-C. Young, 1959, \\"On a new Stegosauria from Szechuan, China\\", Vertebrata PalAsiatica 3(1): 1-8 Femur and humerus (IVPP V2300-17), Paleozoological Museum of China The holotype, IVPP 2300, was found in a layer of the Upper Shaximiao Formation, dating from the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian. It consists of a partial skeleton lacking the skull. It contains six vertebrae, the coracoids, the humeri, a right radius and three spines. The original material has been supplemented after November 1978 by Zhou Shiwu of the Municipal Museum of Chongqing. A second specimen, CV 202, was referred. It represents a skeleton with a partial skull and lower jaws, some vertebrae and limb elements, and four plates. Zhou considered it likely that the holotype and CV 202 represented a single individual, as the material was not overlapping. A third specimen, CV 203, a partial skeleton lacking the skull, was made the paratype. All specimens are juvenile or subadult. In 1999, Li Kui, Zhang Yuguang and Cai Kaiji mentioned a second species: Chialingosaurus guangyuanensis.Li Kui, Zhang Yuguang & Cai Kaiji. 1999. The Characteristics of the Composition of the Trace Elements in Jurassic Dinosaur Bones and Red Beds in Sichuan Basin. Geological Publishing House, Beijing A description was not provided, however, and the name is seen as a nomen nudum. Description Mamenchisaurus and Chialingosaurus in environment Yang in 1959 provided a diagnosis, emphasising the slender build of the animal. It might have been only four metres (thirteen feet) long. However, the gracile proportions may have been caused by the subadult age and the remainder of the diagnostic traits were in fact shared by other stegosaurs. In 1990, Peter Malcolm Galton identified just a single autapomorphy: the lesser trochanter of the thighbone is triangular with a broad base.Galton, P.M., 1990, \\"Stegosauria\\", in: D.B. Weishampel, P. Dodson, & H. Osm√≥lska (eds.), The Dinosauria. University of California Press, pp. 435-455 Susannah Maidment in 2008 even listed Chialingosaurus kuani among the invalid stegosaur taxa in her phylogeny of Stegosauria.Susannah C. R. Maidment, David B. Norman, Paul M. Barrett and Paul Upchurch (2008). \\"Systematics and phylogeny of Stegosauria (Dinosauria: Ornithischia)\\". Journal of Systematic Palaeontology, 6: 367-407 doi:10.1017/S1477201908002459 This was based upon previous work by Maidment & Wei in 2006 in which the authors were unable to identify any autapomorphies or unique character combinations for Chialingosaurus, therefore making it a nomen dubium. Yang modelled Chialingosaurus after Kentrosaurus. Some plates and spine bases having been found, he suggested that the plates were placed on the front upper parts of the animal, the spines at the hip and tail. Phylogeny Yang in 1959 placed Chialingosaurus in the Stegosaurinae within the Stegosauridae. In 1969, Rodney Steel suggested that Chialingosaurus might have actually been an early ancestor of other stegosaurs.Steel, R., 1969, Ornithischia. Handbuch der Palaeoherpetologie, 14 However, Galton in 2004 recovered a rather derived position, albeit indeed close to Kentrosaurus.Galton, P.M., and P.

[In Chinese, with English summary] though some subsequent studies suggested that it may be a spinosauroid, possibly a primitive member of the spinosaurid family (Sereno, 1998; Chure, 2000; Rauhut, 2001) because it had large claws on the forelimbs thought to be unique to that group. Other studies suggested that it could be a member of an alternate offshoot of neotetanuran theropods, with some similarities to allosauroids, spinosauroids, and coelurosaurians. A 2009 study noted that it was difficult to rule out the possibility that Chilantaisaurus was the same animal as the carnosaur Shaochilong, which is from the same geological formation. However, they did note an enormous size difference between the two. Further study by Benson, Carrano and Brusatte found that it was not as closely related to Shaochilong as first thought, but that it was a carnosaur (of the family Neovenatoridae), closely related to Allosaurus as Hu had initially thought. Phylogenetic analysis published by Porfiri et al. in 2018 recovered Chilantaisaurus as a basal coelurosaurian. Several species have been described based on very poor remains. The species \\"Chilantaisaurus\\" sibiricus (previously informally known as either Allosaurus? sibiricus or Antrodemus? sibiricus) is based on a single distal metatarsal from the Turginskaya Svita of the Buryat Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, Russia, dating to the Early Cretaceous periods (Berriasian to Hauterivian stages).Riabinin, 1915.

The foundation stone for Rupertswood was laid on 29 August 1874 with around 1,000 people in attendance. The house was the country seat completed in 1876 for Sir William Clarke a land owner and pastoralist who was one of Australia's wealthiest men and the first Australian-born baronet. It was designed by local architect George L. Browne in the Free Classical style. The estate was sold in 1925 to Hugh Victor McKay, a wealthy industrialist and inventor of the Sunshine Harvester. When McKay died in 1926, Rupertswood was bought by pastoralist William Naughton, and then in 1927 by the Salesian Society, which used the mansion and surrounding property as a male boarding school. The school later became co-educational, relocated into separate premises nearby, and is known as Salesian College, Rupertswood. In March 2006, the Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay travelled to the area, where a re-enactment of the handing over of The Ashes to the English took place in front of a small local crowd. The mansion was restored with the help of interior designer and Victorian architecture specialist Jacqui Robertson and converted into a hotel that was often used for weddings and other formal events until its closure in 2014. The contents were auctioned on site in July 2014 by Glenelg Auction Centre. The building is now used as administration offices for Salesian College.

Raised in York, Pennsylvania, at age 11 he started riding BMX and began BMX racing in 1982. Though successful, he abruptly quit, as he enjoyed dirt jumping more than racing. In 1983, Jones' interest in breakdancing peaked. He formed a troupe with fellow BMXers Mark Eaton, Mike Daily, Jamie McKulik and Dale Mitzel, calling themselves the Cardboard Lords. By April 1985, they had won numerous local competitions, including a York cable show called The Great York Talent Hunt. However, breakdancing's popularity was waning, and Jones drifted back to BMX. Around that time, Daily introduced Jones to his freestyle team, the Plywood Hoods. Daily also showed Jones the modern freestyle BMX bike. Jones bought a similar bike for himself, realizing that the additions of components such as pegs for standing and cable detangling rotors permitted a variety of more daring tricks. Flatland career In November 1986, Jones entered the AFA Veladrome Finals as an expert. He turned heads with some new innovative tricks like the \\"Hang glider Boomerang\\", the \\"Chicken Hook Switch\\", and the \\"Insanity Roll\\". in the following months, Kevin focused his riding toward inventing new tricks to measure up to what he assumed to be the \\"norm\\", and continued to practice hard for their next competition in Austin, TX. In Austin, Texas, 1987, Jones entered his 3rd AFA Masters contest, debuting four of his own tricks, the Locomotive, the Trolley, the Standup Infinity Roll, and the Elephant Glide. Months later at the velodrome in Carson, California, Jones had an amazing, flawless run, debuting another new trick called the Dump Truck where he turned the bike upside down while riding a wheelie from the rear pegs. Around this time, fellow Plywood Hood member & film maker Mark Eaton would release the first of a series of freestyle BMX videos named Dorkin' In York. The Dorkin' videos, as they would become known as, captured equal parts of flatland, ramps, and street riding. The series would continue on for years to come, showcasing the latest tricks from Jones and the rest of the Plywood Hoods, as well as coverage from major contests and some more private jams and practice sessions. Eaton recently released the entire series in a DVD boxset titled Dorkin' in York - The Complete DVD Collection. in December 1988, Kevin invented & pulled off the first ever \\"Hitch Hiker\\", a trick where the rider stands on the 2 front pegs, with the bike upside down in front, rolling on the front wheel, and the rider holding the back tire in his hand. This was one of the first 2 footed rolling tricks to be introduced to BMX Flatland, and the beginning of what is now considered to be modern-day flatland. In 1990, the Kudos granola bar company hired Jones to endorse its product on national television. That same year, Jones toured with the Wilkerson Airlines bike company. However, after these thrusts into the national spotlight, Jones became more reclusive. Aside from the installments of the Dorkin' series, Jones had virtually disappeared from the BMX scene. In 1991, Kevin was riding with Chase Gouin on an average of 10hrs/day, and they were setting out to master every trick both \\"switch\\" & \\"regular\\", on a quest to be able to link any trick into any other trick. , Jones still rides, but has never re-entered the contest scene, nor has he toured for a major bike manufacturer. In August 2006, it was announced that Jones was making a new version of the legendary Big Daddy frame for Hoffman Bikes, and that he'd be rejoining the company's pro team. The new version of the frame was called the Strowler.

The firm has over 450 lawyers, and has United States offices in New York City, Washington, D.C., Hartford, San Antonio, Seattle, Dallas and Austin, and overseas offices in Dubai,CNW Group  BRACEWELL & GIULIANI LLP  Bracewell & Giuliani LLP Opens Office in Dubai and London. The firm's areas of specialization include energy, environmental strategies, financial institutions, financial restructuring, government, litigation, private investment funds, technology, and white collar defense.  History  The firm was founded on November 1, 1945, when J. S. Bracewell and his two sons, Searcy and Fentress, joined with Judge Bert H. Tunks to practice together in Houston under the name of Bracewell & Tunks. J. Searcy Bracewell Jr. was then elected to the Texas Senate in 1946, representing Harris County, and ultimately becoming the Majority Leader of the Senate. Fentress Bracewell led the development of the firm. Harry W. Patterson joined the firm in 1951, and was made name partner in 1966 as Bracewell & Patterson prospered from the commercial growth of Houston. National expansion began during the 1970s, followed by international expansion later. On March 31, 2005, former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani joined the firm as a named partner, with the firm becoming known as Bracewell and Giuliani. Upon this he helped them establish a New York office. Subsequently, Bracewell recruited Mark E. Palmer (formerly with the London firm Linklaters), top restructuring lawyer Evan Flaschen, former federal prosecutor Marc L. Mukasey (son of Judge, U.S. Attorney General, and Giuliani friend Michael Mukasey), former Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for Air and Radiation Jeffrey Holmstead, and former U.S. Associate Attorney General Kevin J O'Connor. The firm would have some overlap in clients with the Giuliani Partners consulting operation, but otherwise be independent. For 2006, Giuliani received a $1 million base salary and a 7¬Ω percent share of the profits realized by the New York office, which share amounted to $200,000. During Giuliani's presidential campaign for 2008, he remained a participating partner but did not do direct client or operational work. Giuliani subsequently returned to work for the firm, splitting time between it and his consulting company Giuliani Partners and focusing on overseas efforts. In January 2016, Giuliani left the firm by ‚Äúamicable agreement,‚Äù and the firm was rebranded as Bracewell LLP. Many other noteworthy political figures have worked at the firm, including former U.S. Congressmen Jim Chapman, Edwin Bethune, and Henson Moore, as well as former Governor of Montana and Republican National Committee chair Marc Racicot, former U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Tony Garza, current Governor of Texas Greg Abbott, and Texas State Representative Morgan Meyer.  Client base  Bracewell has for decades represented clients on government relations matters in Washington, D.C., and in Austin, Texas. The firm's clients have included major energy and natural resource concerns, from conventional energy sources to renewable energy such as solar power and wind power. In 2009, Bracewell's energy practice ranked as the largest in the U.S., according to Law360, with 117 dedicated energy attorneys. The firm has acted as counsel in high-profile energy transactions including Apache Corp.'s 2010 acquisition of BP assets in Texas, New Mexico, Canada and Egypt, and Kinder Morgan's 2011 IPO, the largest IPO in the energy industry in over a decade, and Kinder Morgan's 2014 consolidation of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP, Kinder Morgan Management LLC and El Paso Pipeline Partners LP, the $70 billion deal was the second largest energy deal when announced.

Citgo had been the focus of boycott efforts due to the Socialist policies of President Hugo Chavez and allegations by the U.S. government that Venezuela had \\"not cooperated\\" in the War on Terror. Giuliani's presidential campaign said he did no lobbying for Citgo. As of May 2007, the firm no longer lobbied on behalf of Citgo.

Career Quinn started his career in 1884 with the Union Association's St. Louis Maroons, which won the pennant. He was one of few players from that league to later find success in the National League. Throughout his career, Quinn was known for his defensive skills, and he led NL second basemen in fielding percentage twice. Quinn also had two stints as a big league manager, with the St. Louis Browns in 1895 and the Cleveland Spiders in 1899. His Browns club went 11‚Äì28 under his guidance, and the Spiders were even worse, going 12‚Äì104. His career .148 winning percentage is one of the lowest in baseball history. He was, as a player, arguably the best hitter on the Spiders team that he managed, which is considered to have been the worst team in major league history. He umpired two games; one each in 1894 and 1896. In the offseason, Quinn was a mortician, and he owned a funeral home after his playing days ended. He died at age 75 in St. Louis, Missouri.

The type species is Chirostenotes pergracilis. History of discovery Holotype hands Chirostenotes has a confusing history of discovery and naming. The first fossils of Chirostenotes, a pair of hands, were in 1914 found by George Fryer Sternberg near Little Sandhill Creek in the Campanian Dinosaur Park Formation of Canada, which has yielded the most dinosaurs of any Canadian formation. The specimens were studied by Lawrence Morris Lambe who, however, died before being able to formally name them. In 1924, Charles Whitney Gilmore adopted the name he found in Lambe's notes and described and named the type species Chirostenotes pergracilis. The generic name is derived from Greek cheir, \\"hand\\", and stenotes, \\"narrowness\\". The specific name means \\"throughout\\", per~, \\"gracile\\", gracilis, in Latin. The holotype is NMC 2367, the pair of hands. Another fossil connected to Chirostenotes is specimen CMN 8776, a set of jaws with strange teeth, which were originally referred by Gilmore to Chirostenotes pergracilis. Now that it is known that Chirostenotes was a toothless oviraptorosaur, the jaws have been renamed Richardoestesia and are from an otherwise unknown dinosaur, likely a dromaeosaurid.Currie, P.J., Rigby, Jr., J.K., and Sloan, R.E. (1990). Theropod teeth from the Judith River Formation of southern Alberta, Canada. In: Carpenter, K., and Currie, P.J. (eds.). Dinosaur Systematics: Perspectives and Approaches. Cambridge University Press:Cambridge, 107-125. . Chirostenotes was but the first name assigned. Feet were then found, specimen CMN 8538, and in 1932 Charles Mortram Sternberg gave them the name Macrophalangia canadensis, meaning 'large toes from Canada'. Sternberg correctly recognized them as part of a meat-eating dinosaur but thought they belonged to an ornithomimid. In 1936, its lower jaws, specimen CMN 8776, were found by Raymond Sternberg near Steveville and in 1940 he gave them the name Caenagnathus collinsi. The generic name means 'recent jaw' from Greek kainos, \\"new\\", and gnathos, \\"jaw\\"; the specific name honours William Henry Collins. The toothless jaws were first thought to be those of a bird. Slowly the precise relationship between the finds became clear. In 1960 Alexander Wetmore concluded that Caenagnathus was not a bird but an ornithomimid.Wetmore, A. 1960. A classification for the birds of the world. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections 139 (11): 1‚Äì37 In 1969 Edwin Colbert and Dale Russell suggested that Chirostenotes and Macrophalangia were one and the same animal.E.H. Colbert and D.A. Russell, 1969, \\"The small Cretaceous dinosaur Dromaeosaurus\\", Amer. Mus. Novit., No. 2380, pp. 1-49 In 1976 Halszka Osm√≥lska described Caenagnathus as an oviraptorosaurian. In 1981 the announcement of Elmisaurus, an Asian form of which both hand and feet had been preserved, showed the soundness of Colbert and Russell's conjecture. Pelvic elements of assigned specimen TMP 1979.020.0001 In 1988, a specimen from storage since 1923 was discovered and studied by Philip J. Currie and Dale Russell. This fossil helped link the other discoveries into a single dinosaur. Since the first name applied to any of these remains was Chirostenotes, this were the only name that was recognized as valid. Currie and Russell also addressed the complicating issue of a possible second form being present in the material. In 1933 William Arthur Parks had named Ornithomimus elegans, based on specimen ROM 781, another foot from Alberta. In 1971, Jo√´l Cracraft, still under the assumption Caenagnathus was a bird, had named a second species of Caenagnathus: Caenagnathus sternbergi, based on specimen CMN 2690, a small lower jaw. In 1988 Russell and Currie concluded that these fossils might present a more gracile morph of Chirostenotes pergracilis. In 1989 however, Currie thought that they represented a separate smaller species, and named this as a second species of the closely related Elmisaurus: Elmisaurus elegans. In 1997, this was renamed to Chirostenotes elegans by Hans-Dieter Sues. The species was moved to the new genus Leptorhynchos in 2013. Several larger skeletons from the early Maastrichtian Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta and the late Maastrichtian Hell Creek Formation of Montana and South Dakota have been referred to Chirostenotes in the past, though more recent studies concluded that they represent several new species. The Horseshore Canyon formation specimen was renamed Epichirostenotes in 2011, while the Hell Creek Formation specimens have been referred to the genus Anzu. In 2007 a cladistic study by Philip Senter cast doubt on the idea that all of the large Dinosaur Park Formation fossils belonged to the same creature. Coding the original hand and jaw specimens separately showed that while the Caenagnathus holotype remained in the more basal position in the Caenagnathidae commonly assigned to it, the Chirostenotes pergracilis holotype was placed as an advanced oviraptorosaurian and an oviraptorid. Subsequent studies found that the Caenagnathus jaws did in fact group together with other traditional caenagnathids, but not necessarily Chirostenotes. New specimens described by Funston et al. (2015) and Funston & Currie (2020) indicated that Chirostenotes is a distinct form from Caenagnathus. Description Life restoration Chirostenotes was characterized by long arms ending in slender relatively straight claws, and long powerful legs with slender toes. In 2016 Paul estimated its length at and its weight at 100 kg (220 lbs), while the same year Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a length of 2.6 meters (8.5 ft) and a weight of 40 kg (88 lbs). Classification The cladogram below follows an analysis by Funston & Currie in 2016, which found Elmisaurus within Caenagnathidae. Paleobiology Mandible of Caenagnathus (left) compared to that of Chirostenotes (right) Chirostenotes was probably an omnivore or herbivore, based on evidence from the beaks of related species like Anzu wyliei and Caenagnathus collinsi. In 2005 Phil Senter and J. Michael Parrish published a study on the hand function of Chirostenotes and found that its elongated second finger with its unusually straight claw may have been an adaptation to crevice probing. They suggested that Chirostenotes may have fed on soft-bodied prey that could be impaled by the second claw, such as grubs, as well as unarmored amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. However, if Chirostenotes possessed the large primary feathers on its second finger that have been found in other oviraptorosaurs such as Caudipteryx, it would not have been able to engage in such behavior.Naish, D. (2007). Feathers and Filaments of Dinosaurs, Part II Tetrapod Zoology, April 23, 2011. =Paleopathology= In 2001, Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior. They found that only one of the 17 Chirostenotes foot bones checked for stress fractures actually had them.Rothschild, B., Tanke, D. H., and Ford, T. L., 2001, Theropod stress fractures and tendon avulsions as a clue to activity: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.

Description Skull Conchoraptor was a small dinosaur, only 1‚Äì2 meters (3.3-6.6 feet) in length. Unlike many other oviraptorids, Conchoraptor lacked a head crest. Like its relatives, it lacked teeth. Instead of teeth, oviraptorids had powerful beaks, possibly adapted to crushing mollusk shells. The skull of Conchoraptor was heavily pneumatised, with most of the bones hollow.Kundrat, M. 2007, \\"Avian- like attributes of a virtual brain model of the oviraptorid theropod Conchoraptor gracilis\\", Naturwissenschaften 94: 499-504 Internal connections between both ears functioned as resonance chambers and improved hearing.Kundrat M. and Janacek, J., 2007, \\"Cranial pneumatization and auditory perceptions of the oviraptorid dinosaur Conchoraptor gracilis (Theropoda, Maniraptora) from the Late Cretaceous of Mongolia\\", Naturwissenschaften 94:769‚Äì778 Discovery When first discovered in the Red Beds of Hermiin Tsav of the Early Maastrichtian Nemegt Formation by a Polish-Mongolian expedition in 1971, scientists believed that Conchoraptor was a juvenile Oviraptor and that the animal's missing crest would have begun to grow when the animal reaching sexual maturity.\\"Conchoraptor.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 136. . Further study of multiple skeletons showed that Conchoraptor belonged in a new genus. The hands of Conchoraptor were a major reason that scientists decided to split it off from Oviraptor. Anatomically the hands seemed to be an evolutionary intermediate between those of Ajancingenia and Oviraptor, making it obvious that this animal was not a member of a known species. The type species of this new genus, Conchoraptor gracilis, was described and named by Barsbold, in 1986. The generic name is derived from Greek konkh√®, \\"mussel\\", and Latin raptor, \\"plunderer\\".Rinchen Barsbold, 1986, \\"Raubdinosaurier Oviraptoren\\". In: Vorobyeva, E. I. (ed.), Herpetologische Untersuchungen in der Mongolischen Volksrepublik. Akademia Nauk SSSR. pp. 210-223 This name reflects Barsbold's hypothesis that oviraptorids, rather than preying primarily upon eggs as had been traditionally thought, may have been specialized to feed on mollusks. The specific name means \\"gracile\\" in Latin. The holotype is IGM 100/20, a partial skeleton with skull. Later about two dozen specimens were formally referred to the species. Classification Skeletal restoration Conchoraptor was by Barsbold assigned to the Oviraptoridae in 1986. Recent analyses show it was a member of the oviraptorid subfamily Ingeniinae. The cladogram below follows an analysis by Fanti et al., 2012.Fanti F, Currie PJ, Badamgarav D (2012). \\"New Specimens of Nemegtomaia from the Baruungoyot and Nemegt Formations (Late Cretaceous) of Mongolia.\\" PLoS ONE, 7(2): e31330. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0031330 Paleoecology =Habitat= Subadult specimen The Nemegt Formation of Mongolia, is estimated to date back to the Maastrichtian stage, between 70 and 66 million years ago of the Late Cretaceous period. During the Late Cretaceous period, the land that is now the Nemegt Formation had an arid environment with fields of sand dunes and only intermittent streams. It is slightly younger than the nearby Djadochta Formation, and seems to have been slightly wetter. This formation is noteworthy for the exquisite preservation of small and fragile dinosaur skeletons, a rare occurrence considering that these fossils are typically broken up and dispersed when found in other rock formations.Novacek, M.

It was named for Michael Crichton, the author of the famed dinosaur novel Jurassic Park. History Front of reconstructed skeleton The first fossils of the genus were discovered in 1999 in the Sunjiawan Formation of Xiafuxiang, near Beipiao in Liaoning Province, China. It was named and described by Dong Zhiming of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2002. The type species is Crichtonsaurus bohlini. The generic name is in honor of Michael Crichton, American author whose novels include Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain and others. The specific name honours Birger Bohlin, a Swedish paleontologist who during the 1930s took part in several paleontological expeditions to China. He described numerous Chinese ankylosaurs. As well as his work on dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals, Bohlin was part of the group that established the existence of Peking Man. The holotype, IVPP V12745, was found in a layer of the Sunjiawan Formation dating from the Cenomanian-Turonian. It consists of a left lower jaw with three preserved teeth. Additionally, two specimens have been referred: IVPP V12746, consisting of two neck vertebrae and a back vertebra; and LPM 101, a partial postcranial skeleton including four sacral vertebrae, seven tail vertebrae. a shoulder blade, a coracoid, a humerus, a thighbone, foot bones, a cervical halfring and osteoderms.Z.-M. Dong, 2002, \\"A new armored dinosaur (Ankylosauria) from Beipiao Basin, Liaoning Province, northeastern China\\", Vertebrata PalAsiatica 40(4): 276-285 In 2014, Victoria Arbour pointed out that the referral of the additional specimens could not be justified because of a lack of overlapping material. She also failed to find any unique traits in the holotype itself, concluding that Crichtonsaurus bohlini was a nomen dubium.Arbour, Victoria Megan, 2014, Systematics, evolution, and biogeography of the ankylosaurid dinosaurs. Ph.D thesis, University of Alberta The specimens referred to Crichtonsaurus bohlini are rather small. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated their body length at 3.5 metres, their weight at half a tonne.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 231 Crichtonsaurus bohlini was placed in the Ankylosauridae and was a likely member of the Ankylosaurinae. Misassigned species A second species, Crichtonsaurus benxiensis, was named by L√º Junchang, Ji Qiang, Gao Yubo and Li Zhixin in 2007. The specific name refers to the Benxi Geological Museum. The holotype, BXGMV0012, was discovered in the same early Late Cretaceous-age (Cenomanian- Turonian) Sunjiawan Formation of Beipiao, Liaoning, as the type species. It consists of a complete skull. Additionally, specimen BXGMV0012-1 has been referred, a partial skeleton lacking the skull, found at the same location. Also, according to Arbour, a skeleton displayed at the Sihetun Fossil Museum under the name of C. bohlini, probably belongs to C. benxiensis. Paul suggested C. benxiensis were a junior synonym of C. bohlini. However, apart from indicating C. bohlini as a dubious species to which no other species can be justifiably seen as identical, Arbour established diagnostic differences between the shoulder blades of BXGMV0012-1 and LPM 101, so two ankylosaurid taxa seem to be present in the formation. Based upon her conclusion that C. bohlini was a nomen dubium, Arbour suggested a new generic name for the second species: Crichtonpelta, for the time being an invalid nomen ex dissertatione. However, in 2015, the name was validly published and it was officially separated from the dubious type species C. bohlini.

It had long, unusually slender hind limbs for its size, suggesting that it was a swift runner. The skull is not known. One fossil specimen of a single species (D. agilis, or \\"agile delta runner\\") has been described, found in the Kem Kem Beds, which date to the mid Cretaceous Period (mid Cenomanian age), about 95 million years ago. It may be a junior synonym of the contemporary Bahariasaurus.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information Deltadromeus has often been considered a ceratosaurian, more specifically a member of the family Noasauridae. In 2016, a South American theropod known as Gualicho shinyae was found to possess many similarities with Deltadromeus. Depending on the phylogenetic position of Gualicho, Deltadromeus may have been a neovenatorid carnosaur, a tyrannosauroid, or a basal coelurosaur if its close relation to Gualicho is legitimate. Description Deltadromeus feeding on a sauropod The holotype of Deltadromeus agilis (museum catalogue number SGM-Din2) is a partial skeleton of an animal which is estimated to have measured 8 meters (26.24 feet) long. The weight of the living animal was estimated to have been around 1050 kilograms, slightly more than an imperial ton. Size of the holotype, speculatively restored as a noasaurid, compared to a human A number of specimens (catalogued under IPHG 1912 VIII) were originally considered by Ernst Stromer to be conspecific with Bahariasaurus,Stromer (1934). \\"Ergebnisse der Forschungsreisen Prof. E. Stromers in den W√ºsten √Ñgyptens.\\" II. Wirbeltierreste der Baharije-Stufe (unterstes Cenoman). 13. Dinosauria. Abh. Bayer. Akad. Wiss., Math.-Nat. Abt., (n. s.) 22 1-79, 3 pls. but were referred to Deltadromeus by Paul Sereno in 1996. They were thought to come from a much larger individual, with a femur (upper leg bone) length of 1.22 meters (4 feet), compared to the 0.74 meter (2.46 foot) long femur of the holotype. These referred specimens, if legitimately assigned to Deltadromeus, would have indicated that members of the genus could grow up to 12.2 meters (40 feet) in length, approximately the size of a Tyrannosaurus rex. However, the referral of the coracoid, pubes, and hindlimb material catalogued under IPHG 1912 VIII to Deltadromeus has been questioned because the remains came from different horizons and localities in the Bahariya Formation, and actually exhibit notable differences from the holotype of Deltadromeus. The Deltadromeus skeleton has been found in the same formation as those of the giant theropods Carcharodontosaurus, Spinosaurus, and Bahariasaurus, which may be synonymous with Deltadromeus. No skull material has been found for either Deltadromeus or Bahariasaurus, and though carnivore teeth labelled as \\"Deltadromeus\\" are commonly sold in rock shops, there is no way of knowing if they actually come from this animal. Classification Cast with alternate skull reconstruction Pectoral and forelimb = Deltadromeus as a ceratosaur = Many studies published since the original description of Deltadromeus have considered it to be a ceratosaur, although different studies disagree on what kind of ceratosaur. One 2003 study suggested it was a member of the Noasauridae, though others have found it to be more primitive, possibly related to the primitive ceratosaurs Elaphrosaurus and Limusaurus. A more comprehensive study of noasaurid relationships published in 2016 found that both of these interpretations were essentially correct, with Deltadromeus, Limusaurus, and Elaphrosaurus all found to be within the Noasauridae.Rauhut, O.W.M., and Carrano, M.T. (2016). The theropod dinosaur Elaphrosaurus bambergi Janensch, 1920, from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru, Tanzania. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, (advance online publication) A 2017 paper describing ontogenetic changes in Limusaurus and the affect of juvenile taxa on phylogenetic analyses placed Deltadromeus as a noasaurid in every analysis regardless of which Limusaurus specimen was used, although the analyses did not include Gualicho or Aoniraptor. According to the writers of the paper, resolving the phylogenetic positions of Gualicho, Aoniraptor, Deltadromeus, and megaraptorans is one of the most critical issues presently facing theropod systematics. The cladogram below follows a 2016 analysis by Oliver Rauhut, and Matthew Carrano. = Deltadromeus as an avetheropod = The original description of Deltadromeus in 1996 found that it was a fairly basal coelurosaur, only slightly more advanced than the Late Jurassic genus Ornitholestes. In 2016, an analysis of Gualicho, a South American theropod considered to belong to the allosauroid family Neovenatoridae, finds Deltadromeus to be Gualicho's probable sister taxon. However, the analysis also noted that Deltadromeus shared many features with ceratosaurs and that if Gualicho was removed from the analysis, Deltadromeus would resolve to a member of Ceratosauria. In an analysis of Aoniraptor, which may be the same animal as Gualicho, Deltadromeus was found along with Aoniraptor and Bahariasaurus to probably form a still poorly known clade of megaraptoran tyrannosauroids different from the Megaraptoridae. A 2018 study by Porfiri et al. has supported the idea that Gualicho and megaraptorans were basal coelurosaurs, outside of both Neovenatoridae and Tyrannosauroidea. However, this study did not include Deltadromeus. The cladogram below follows the 2016 Gualicho analysis by Sebasti√°n Apestegu√≠a, Nathan D. Smith, Rub√©n Juarez Valieri, and Peter J. Makovicky.

A robotic lawn mower is an autonomous robot used to cut lawn grass. A typical robotic lawn mower (in particular earlier generation models) requires the user to set up a border wire around the lawn that defines the area to be mowed. The robot uses this wire to locate the boundary of the area to be trimmed and in some cases to locate a recharging dock. Robotic mowers are capable of maintaining up to of grass. Robotic lawn mowers are increasingly sophisticated, are self-docking and some contain rain sensors if necessary, nearly eliminating human interaction. Robotic lawn mowers represented the second largest category of domestic robots used by the end of 2005. In 2012, the growth of robotic lawn mower sales was 15 times that of the traditional styles. With the emergence of smart phones some robotic mowers have integrated features within custom apps to adjust settings or scheduled mowing times and frequency, as well as manually control the mower with a digital joystick. Alt URL Modern robotic lawn mowers can contain specialized sensors, allowing them to automatically mow around obstacles or even go to sleep when it starts to rain. The vast majority of robotic lawn mowers tackle the task utilizing a \\"random\\" mowing system. Basically the machine bounces around on the lawn until it hits the boundary wire limiting the working area, then changes heading until it hits the wire again. Depending on the lawn size, this might take a very long time, so the machine must more or less be in continuous operations. One exception is the Bosch robotic lawn mower \\"Indego\\" which creates a map of the users garden and then tackles the task in a systematic manner.  History  In 1969, the MowBot is introduced and patented by S Lawrence Bellinger and already showing many features of today's most popular products. It weighted , was selling for $800 ($5600 in 2020 dollars) and had an autonomy of 3 hours and In 1992, the first fully solar powered robotic mower is patented by Andr√© Collens and sold to Husqvarna which markets it in 1995. In 2012, the Bosch Indego introduced lawn mapping, to mow in a systematic manner instead of a random pattern. As of 2019, vision-based robotic mowers, without perimeter wire, were announced.  Technology  The mower can find its charging station via radio frequency emissions, by following a boundary wire, or by following an optional guide wire. This can eliminate wear patterns in the lawn caused by the mower only being able to follow one wire back to the station. To get to remote areas or areas only accessible through narrow passages the mower can follow a guide wire or a boundary wire out of the station. Batteries used include nickel‚Äìmetal hydride (NiMH), lithium-ion and lead-acid. In 2019 an all-wheel-drive (AWD) drive robotic mower was released by Husqvarna.

The Bishop received Theodulos among his clergy and made him door-keeper of the church. Meanwhile, Nilus, having left his monastery to find his son, at last met him at Elusa. The bishop then ordained them both priests and allowed them to return to Sinai. The mother and the other son had also embraced the religious life in Egypt. St. Nilus was certainly alive till the year 430. It is uncertain how soon after that he died. Some writers believe him to have lived till 451.Leo Allatius, op. cit., 8-14. The Byzantine Menology for his feast (12 November) supposes this. On the other hand, none of his works mentions the First Council of Ephesus (431) and he seems to know only the beginning of the Nestorian troubles; so we have no evidence of his life later than about 430. From his monastery at Sinai Nilus was a well known person throughout the Eastern Church; by his writings and correspondence he played an important part in the history of his time. He was known as a theologian, Biblical scholar and ascetic writer, so people of all kinds, from the emperor down, wrote to consult him. His numerous works, including a multitude of letters, consist of denunciations of heresy, paganism, abuses of discipline and crimes, of rules and principles of asceticism, especially maxims about the religious life. He warns and threatens people in high places, abbots and bishops, governors and princes, even the emperor himself, without fear. He kept up a correspondence with Gainas, a leader of the Goths, endeavouring to convert him from Arianism;Book I of his letters, nos. 70, 79, 114, 115, 116, 205, 206, 286. he denounced vigorously the persecution of St. John Chrysostom both to the Emperor Arcadiusib., II, 265; III, 279. and to his courtiers.I, 309; III, 199. Nilus must be counted as one of the leading ascetic writers of the 5th century. His feast is kept on 12 November in the Eastern Orthodox calendar; he is commemorated also in the Roman martyrology on the same date. The Armenian Church remembers him, with other Egyptian fathers, on the Thursday after the third Sunday of their Advent.Nilles, Kalendarium Manuale, Innsbruck, 1897, II, 624. Prophecy of St. Nilus The Prophecy of St. Nilus is an apocryphal work of uncertain origin (thus often referred to as the Prophecy of Pseudo-Nilus) predicting the apocalypse to occur in the 19th or 20th century (depending on the version of the text). The creation of this work is very dubioushttp://southern-orthodoxy.blogspot.com/2005/01/spooky- doxy.html whose date of creation is unverified.http://www.traditioninaction.org/Questions/B260_MoreNilus.html With the advent of the Internet, the work has taken on the status of urban legend. One source has cited the Bibliotheca Sanctorum, volume IX, page 1008 as a possible origin of the text.Prophecy of St. NilusBiblioteca Sanctorum, volume IX, page 1008 These prophecies likely originated from the Russian Orthodox St. Nilus, called Nilus of Sora, but has been wrongly attributed to Nilus of Sinai. Between the years 1813 and 1819, a certain monk named Theophanes, also known as the ‚ÄúPrisoner‚Äù, was troubled by a demon due to his many sins, and he also suffered from a hernia. In despair over his condition he planned to leave the Holy Mountain until one day St. Nilus appeared to him. St. Nilus showed him an abandoned hut and instructed him to settle there, promising to provide for his needs. Theophanes obeyed, although at first he did not know it was St. Nilus - only later did the Saint reveal himself. St. Nilus appeared to him several times, healed him, and taught him about spiritual warfare. Cleansed of his passions and sins through proper ascetic struggle, St. Nilus ordered him to take the Great Schema and bear the name Ekhmalotos (Prisoner) as a sign that now he was a captive of St. Nilus for healing him of demonic possession and vice. St. Nilus told Monk Ekhmalotos he wanted a path made to his cave so that monks could go there to pray. He also wanted the Liturgy to be served in the cave church he himself had built. When the Fathers heard this, they wished to build a new church in honor of St. Nilus. As they were digging the foundation, they found the saint‚Äôs grave. From his relics an ineffable fragrance came forth. This took place on May 7, 1815. Then the monks informed the Fathers of the Great Lavra of their discovery. They came and transferred the relics to the Lavra, leaving only a portion of the saint‚Äôs jaw at the cave to be venerated by those who came there. At the request of certain monks from Kafsokalyvia, Monk Ekhmalotos wrote down the appearances of the Saint, and later St. Nilus told him to write down his words in full. Because he was barely literate he dictated the story and prophecies to a Hieromonk Gerasimos from Constantinople, who recorded it word for word. The entire chronicle of St. Nilus‚Äô teachings and prophecies to the Monk Theophanes between the years 1813 to 1819 fill a six-hundred page book, available in Greek and Russian. A monk by the name of Iakovos from Iveron Monastery copied this entire text and published it in 1906. It includes prophecies of the invasion of the Holy Mountain during the Greek Revolution, the 1821 Revolution itself, the end of monasticism on the Holy Mountain, and the struggles of the monks of the last times. So this is the likely source of the prophecies of St. Nilus.http://www.roacamerica.org/ann- historical_instances_righteous_hierarchs_unjustly_condemned_by_synods.shtml Works The writings of St. Nilus of Sinai were first edited by Petrus Possinus (Paris, 1639); in 1673 Suarez published a supplement at Rome; his letters were collected by Possinus (Paris, 1657), a larger collection was made by Leo Allatius (Rome, 1668). All these editions are used in Patrologia Graeca, vol. 79. The works are divided by Fessler-Jungmann into four classes: # Works about virtues and vices in general: ‚Äî \\"Peristeria\\" (P. G., 79, 811-968), a treatise in three parts addressed to a monk Agathios; \\"On Prayer\\" (peri proseuches, ib., 1165‚Äì1200); \\"Of the eight spirits of wickedness\\" (peri ton th'pneumaton tes ponerias, ib., 1145‚Äì64); \\"Of the vice opposed to virtues\\" (peri tes antizygous ton areton kakias, ib., 1140‚Äì44); \\"Of various bad thoughts\\" (peri diapsoron poneron logismon, ib., 1200‚Äì1234); \\"On the word of the Gospel of Luke\\", 22:36 (ib., 1263‚Äì1280). # \\"Works about the monastic life\\": ‚Äî Concerning the slaughter of monks on Mount Sinai, in seven parts, telling the story of the author's life at Sinai, the invasion of the Saracens, captivity of his son, etc. (ib., 590-694); Concerning Albianos, a Nitrian monk whose life is held up as an example (ib., 695-712); \\"Of Asceticism\\" (Logos asketikos, about the monastic ideal, ib., 719-810); \\"Of voluntary poverty\\" (peri aktemosynes, ib., 968-1060); \\"Of the superiority of monks\\" (ib., 1061‚Äì1094); \\"To Eulogios the monk\\" (ib., 1093‚Äì1140). # \\"Admonitions\\" (Gnomai) or \\"Chapters\\" (kephalaia), about 200 precepts drawn up in short maxims (ib., 1239‚Äì62). These are probably made by his disciples from his discourses. # \\"Letters\\": ‚Äî Possinus published 355, Allatius 1061 letters, divided into four books (P. G., 79, 81-585). Many are not complete, several overlap, or are not really letters but excerpts from Nilus' works; some are spurious. Fessler- Jungmann divides them into classes, as dogmatic, exegetical, moral, and ascetic. Certain works wrongly attributed to Nilus are named in Fessler- Jungmann, pp. 125‚Äì6.

Œ¥ŒπŒ∫œÅŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ, dikraios \\"bifurcated, double-headed\\" + Gr. œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ, sauros \\"lizard\\") is a genus of small diplodocoid sauropod dinosaur that lived in what is now Tanzania during the late Jurassic. It was named for the spines on the back of the neck. The first fossil was described by paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914. Description Restoration of D. hansemanni Unlike most diplodocoids, Dicraeosaurus had a large head with a relatively short and wide neck. The neck contained 12 unusually short vertebrae, so it could probably browse vegetation only from ground level to a height of about . It also lacked the whiplash tail that other diplodocids had. It was smaller, at only reached in length. It gets its name, which means two- forked lizard, from the spines that came from the vertebrae. They were not straight as in some members of the family. Each one was ‚ÄúY‚Äù shaped, like a fork. These spines also provided muscle attachment points. Classification Dicreosaurids shown to scale The following cladogram follows an analysis by Sereno et al. in 2007.Sereno PC, Wilson JA, Witmer LM, Whitlock JA, Maga A, et al. (2007) Structural Extremes in a Cretaceous Dinosaur. PLoS ONE 2(11): e1230. Palaeoecology Restoration of the head Dicraeosaurus lived in the Late Jurassic. It was herbivorous; however, it didn't compete with other dinosaurs for vegetation. Fossils have been discovered in the rocks of Tendaguru Hill in Tanzania. The rocks also yield fossils of Giraffatitan and Kentrosaurus. As there was a distinct difference in size between these animals, they would probably have browsed for vegetation at different levels, allowing them to co-exist without significant competition.

The National Action Network (NAN) is a not-for-profit, civil rights organization founded by the Reverend Al Sharpton in New York City, New York, in early 1991. In a 2016 profile, Vanity Fair called Sharpton \\"arguably the country's most influential civil rights leader\\". Organization The organization's Board of Directors is chaired by Rev. Dr. W. Franklyn Richardson, the pastor of Grace Baptist Church in Mount Vernon. The Board of Directors has a tradition of including those most recognized in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, as it was first chaired by Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker, Pastor Emeritus of Canaan Baptist Church in Harlem, New York, and former Executive Director to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In addition to Dr. Walker, the late Coretta Scott King, widow of Dr. King, supported the organization and her son, Martin Luther King, III, participates annually in the Keepers of the Dream Awards Dinner and National Convention. National Action Network's Annual Convention draws more than 8,000 delegates and leaders from media, business, politics, entertainment and the civil rights from across the country. The 2007 convention featured six presidential candidates and was dubbed by the media the \\"Sharpton Primary\\". In Barack Obama's speech during the 2007 convention he said that Rev. Al Sharpton was \\"The voice of the voiceless and a champion for the downtrodden.\\" In 2011 President Barack Obama delivered a keynote address at their convention, applauding NAN's activism by saying: \\"National Action Network is not the National 'Satisfaction' Network; it's the National 'Action' Network\\". At the National Action Network's convention in April of 2014 close to 7,000 people attended, making it the biggest in the history of the organization and the largest civil rights convening of the year in the nation. During the 2014 convention President Barack Obama returned to address over 1,200 convention attendees where he addressed voting rights and said \\"We've got to create a national network committed to taking action. We can call it the National Action Network.\\" Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders spoke at the Silver Anniversary 2016 National Action Network Convention. \\"You stand up and always have against gun violence, advocate for criminal justice reform, help young people find jobs, hold corporations accountable, and in a million ways, lift up voices that often go unheard,\\" Clinton said during her speech. The National Action Network is headquartered in Harlem, New York and has regional offices in Washington, D.C.., Atlanta and Los Angeles. It currently has over 105 chapters in cities around the nation. Issues of focus The National Action Network is widely credited with drawing national attention to critical issues such as racial profiling, police brutality, and the US Naval bombing exercises on the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico. Notably, the organization was prominently involved with the police brutality cases of Amadou Diallo (New York), Abner Louima (New York) and Patrick Dorismond (New York) Eric Garner (New York), Michael Brown (Ferguson). In 1999, the organization launched The Madison Avenue Initiative or \\"MAI\\", a program designed to address the inequities in the advertising industry. MAI was created after a racially charged memorandum, infamously dubbed, \\"The Katz Memo\\", was circulated among certain radio stations, stating that advertisers wanted \\"prospects, not suspects\\". The recognition of this memorandum set off an investigation into the spending practices of corporations, specifically examining whether their advertising budgets with African-American and Latino publications and advertising agencies was commensurate with their consumer bases. In 2000, the organization launched the Truth Hamer Voter Registration and Education Initiative. The Truth Hamer Initiative set out to register one million women to vote, targeting populations in traditionally overlooked areas, such as public housing developments, transitional housing communities and rural areas. Sharpton's organization has been heavily courted by endorsement by presidential candidates including both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. =Walgreens= In 2011, Walgreens announced they would be ending their relationship with Express Scripts, a prescription drug program serving mostly poor individuals that gave them discounted prescriptions. This would have resulted in low-income individuals paying up to 30 percent more for their prescriptions. A coalition of minority groups, led by Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network, sent letters urging Gregory Wasson, CEO of Walgreens, to reconsider. Groups sending letters were National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, the Congress of Racial Equality, Hispanic Leadership Fund, and others. =Comcast NBCUniversal MOU= In 2011 National Action Network, joined forces with the National Urban League and NAACP to negotiate an agreement between three of the leading civil rights organizations and Comcast NBCUniversal. As part of their filings with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Comcast NBC Universal agreed to a written African American Memorandum of Understanding to provide four television stations owned and operated by African Americans (two of which were designated to Magic Johnson and Sean \\"Diddy\\" Combs) The MOU was a comprehensive commitment covering all business units and focusing on the following five areas: corporate governance, employment/workforce recruitment and retention, procurement, programming and philanthropy and community investment. =Trayvon Martin= On February 26, 2012 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was killed by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman, who said that he had acted in self-defense. A month later National Action Network and other civil rights organizations came to Sanford, FL for a series of protests and marches to call for Zimmerman's arrest. Six weeks after the shooting, Zimmerman was arrested. On July 13, 2013 George Zimmerman was found not guilty of second-degree murder. He was also acquitted of manslaughter, a lesser charge. On July 20, 2013 National Action Network organized rallies in 100 cities around the country to speak out against the Zimmerman verdict and stand-your-ground-laws. On March 10, 2014 the National Action Network led a march to Florida's state capitol to rally against stand-your-ground laws. Among those present were the family of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, and Oscar Grant. The family of Marissa Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years for firing a gun at her estranged husband and the family of Michael Giles, a U.S. Airman sentenced to 25 years in a self-defense case also joined. =Stop and frisk= On June 17, 2012 National Action Network joined the NAACP and SEIU and 115 other organizations in a march down Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, NY to call for an end to Stop-and- frisk. This New York Police Department policy, National Action Network had been opposed to and spoke out against for years due to its bias towards individuals of color and the databases created by people stopped by Stop-and- frisk. The NYPD released data that nearly 90 percent of those targeted by stop-and-frisks in the city in 2011 were either black or Hispanic. Blacks and Hispanics together make up less than 53 percent of the city's population. A total of 685,724 people ‚Äî 8.6 percent of the city's population ‚Äî were detained by cops for \\"reasonable suspicion.\\" Out of the total of the stop-and-frisk stops 605,328 were totally innocent (88 percent). In January 2014 the City of New York under the leadership of Mayor Bill de Blasio reached an agreement which resulted in the withdrawal of the City's appeal of the landmark stop- and-frisk case, Floyd v. City of New York. =Shop and frisk= On October 29, 2013 National Action Network along with other civil rights groups formed a shop-and-frisk task force and convened their first meeting with Barneys CEO Mark Lee. The meeting was brought about when a young African American man claimed that after making a purchase of a designer belt Barneys, after leaving the store he was confronted by undercover New York Police Department officers, who said a Barneys employee raised concerns over the sale. In court documents, Christian says he showed officers his receipt, debit card and identification but was told \\"he could not afford to make such an expensive purchase\\" before being placed in a cell for more than two hours. Ultimately, no charges were filed. At this initial meeting Barneys CEO Mark Lee promised a thorough review of Barneys' practices and procedures to ensure they reflect the company's \\"continued commitment to fairness and equality.\\" Following this meeting the task force met with Macy's Inc Chairman Terry Lundgren to address similar concerns. One of the outcomes from these meetings was the creation of a 'Customers' Bill of Rights' that was then posted in 2013 during the holiday shopping season. Among those rights outlined in the document is a requirement for store security personnel ‚Äî some of whom roam the aisles in plainclothes ‚Äî to identify themselves when interacting with customers. Prohibited is \\"the use of excessive force\\" or \\"threatening, vulgar language\\" when detaining people suspected of theft. People suspected of engaging in a crime can be detained \\"only in a reasonable manner and not for more than a reasonable time.\\" =March on Washington 50th anniversary= National Action Network organized the 'national action to realize the dream' march in honor of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, on August 24, 2013. The march was led by Rev. Al Sharpton and Martin Luther King, III with: US Attorney General Eric Holder; Congressman John Lewis; Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader; Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer; the families of Trayvon Martin and Emmett Till; and many more. National Action Network brought down 1,000 buses carrying activists and marchers. =Ministers March for Justice= The Ministers March for Justice On August 28, 2017, the National Action Network organized the Ministers March for Justice. The event, which focused on fighting racism, was attended by thousands of Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh ministers. The march also criticized President Donald Trump's response to the Unite the Right rally, in which one person was killed by a vehicle attack. Tax and salary controversies The United States and the New York State governments have investigated the organization for tax payment irregularities. As late as 2006, the National Action Network owed $1.9 million in payroll taxes and penalties.Chuck Bennett, \\"Subpoena Blitz Puts Heat on Al\\", New York Post, June 19, 2008. Many donors to the National Action Network were subpoenaed in connection with a 2008 tax probe, including Anheuser-Busch. According to IRS filings, the organization paid Sharpton $241,402 plus personal expenses for 2011. Sharpton's rate of pay remained around the same until 2014, when he was given a 71% raise to $412,644, which included a bonus of $64,400. The organization's explanation for the increase was that it represented repayment of loans previously made by Sharpton to the National Action Network. The organization's 2018 IRS Form 990 listed Sharpton's compensation at about $1.05 million. Controversial donations Sharpton has engaged in controversial donation policies ‚Äî specifically the practice of threatening protests and boycotts of corporations while simultaneously soliciting donations and sponsorships from them. According to the New York Post, several major corporations, including Anheuser-Busch and Colgate-Palmolive, have donated thousands of dollars to the National Action Network. The Post asserted that the donations were made to prevent boycotts or rallies by the National Action Network.Isabel Vincent and Susan Edelman, \\"Rev.

It is part of the Nodosauridae, a family within Ankylosauria. It is named after the Edmonton Formation (now the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Canada), the unit of rock it was found in. Description =Size and general build= Size comparison Edmontonia was bulky, broad and tank-like. Its length has been estimated at about 6.6 m (22 ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul considered both main Edmontonia species, E. longiceps and E. rugosidens, to be equally long at six metres and weigh three tonnes.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 238 Edmontonia had small, oval ridged bony plates on its back and head and many sharp spikes along its sides. The four largest spikes jutted out from the shoulders on each side, the second of which was split into subspines in E. rugosidens specimens. Its skull had a pear-like shape when viewed from above. Its neck and shoulders were protected by three halfrings made of large keeled plates. =Distinguishing traits= Restoration of E. rugosidens In 1990, Kenneth Carpenter established some diagnostic traits for the genus as a whole, mainly comparing it with its close relative Panoplosaurus. In top view, the snout has more parallel sides. The skull armour has a smooth surface. In the palate, the vomer is keeled. The neural arches and neural spines are shorter than those of Panoplosaurus. The sacrum proper consists of three sacral vertebrae. In the shoulder girdle, the scapula and coracoid are not fused. Carpenter also indicated in which way the main species differed from each other. The type species, Edmontonia longiceps, is distinguished from E. rugosidens in lacking sideways projecting osteoderms behind the eye sockets; having tooth rows that are less divergent; possessing a more narrow palate; having a sacrum that is wider than long and more robust; and in having shorter spikes at the sides. Also, an ossified cheek plate, known from E. rugosidens specimens, has not been found with Edmontonia longiceps. =Skeleton= Restored E. rugosidens skeleton without back armour The skull of Edmontonia, up to half a metre long, is somewhat elongated with a protruding truncated snout. The snout carried a horny upper beak and the front snout bones, the premaxillae, were toothless. The cutting edge of the upper beak continued into the maxillary tooth rows, each containing fourteen to seventeen small teeth. In each dentary of the lower jaws, eighteen to twenty- one teeth were present. In the sides of the snout large depressions were present, \\"nasal vestibules\\", that each possessed two smaller openings. The top of these was a horizontal oval and represented the bony external nostril, the entrance to the nasal cavity, the normal air passage. The more rounded second opening below and obliquely in front, was the entrance to a \\"paranasal\\" tract, running along the outer side of the nasal cavity, in a somewhat lower position. A study by Matthew Vickaryous in 2006 proved for the first time the presence of multiple openings in a nodosaurid; such structures had already been well established in ankylosaurids. The air tracts are however, much simpler than in the typical ankylosaurid condition, and are not convoluted while lacking bony turbinate bones. The nasal cavity is separated into two halves along the midline by a bone wall. This septum is continued to below by the vomers, which are keeled, the keel featuring a pendulum-shaped appendage. Another similarity with Ankylosauridae is the presence of a secondary bone palate, a possible case of parallel evolution. This has been shown too for Panoplosaurus. The AMNH 5381 specimen of E. rugosidens, 1915 (first referred to Palaeoscincus by Matthew in 1922), showing the position of the dermal armour The head armour tiles, or caputegulae, are smooth. Details differ between the various specimens but all share a large central nasal tile on the snout, bend large \\"loreal\\" tiles at the rear snout edges and a large central caputegula on the skull roof. The tiles behind the upper eye socket rim in Edmontonia longiceps do not stick out as much as in E. rugosidens, combined with a more narrow, pointed snout in the former. Some E. rugosidens specimens are known that possess a \\"cheek plate\\" above the lower jaw. Contrary to that discovered with Panoplosaurus, it is \\"free-floating\\", not fused with the lower jaw bone. The vertebral column contains about eight neck vertebrae, about twelve \\"free\\" back vertebrae, a \\"sacral rod\\" of four fused rear dorsal vertebrae, three sacral vertebrae, two caudosacrals and at least twenty, but probably about forty, tail vertebrae. In the neck the first two vertebrae, the atlas and axis, are fused. In the shoulder girdle, the coracoid has a rectangular profile, in contrast to the more rounded shape with Panoplosaurus. Two sternal plates are present, connected to sternal ribs. The forelimb is robust but relatively long. In Edmontonia longiceps and E. rugosidens the deltopectoral crest of the humerus is gradually rounded. The metacarpus is robust compared to that of Panoplosaurus. The hand very likely was tetradactyl, having four fingers. The exact number of phalanges is unknown but the formula was by W.P. Coombs suggested to be 2-3-3-4-?. =Osteoderms= Skull and neck armor Edmontonia reconstruction in Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology Apart from the head armour, the body was covered with osteoderms, skin ossifications. The configuration of the armour of Edmontonia is relatively well known, much of it having been discovered in articulation. The neck and shoulder region was protected by three cervical halfrings, each consisting of fused rounded rectangular, asymmetrically keeled, bone plates. These halfrings did not have a continuous underlying bone band. The first and second halfrings each had three pairs of segments. Below each lower end of the second halfring a side spike was present, a separate triangular osteoderm pointing obliquely forward. In the third halfring over the shoulders, the two pairs of central segments are bordered on each side by a very large forward- pointing spike that is bifurcated, featuring a secondary point above the main one. A third large spike behind it points more sideways; a smaller fourth one, often connected to the third at the base, is directed obliquely to behind. The row of side spikes is continued to the rear but there the osteoderms are much lower, curving strongly to behind, with the point overhanging the rear edge. Gilmore had trouble believing that the shoulder spikes really pointed to the front as this would have greatly hampered the animal while moving through vegetation. He suggested that the points had shifted during the burial of the carcass. However, Carpenter and G.S. Paul, trying to reposition the spikes, found that it was impossible to rotate them without losing conformity with the remainder of the armour. The side spikes have solid, not hollow, bases. The spikes differ in size between E. rugosidens individuals; those of the E. longiceps holotype are relatively small. Behind the third halfring the back and hip are covered by numerous transverse rows of much smaller oval keeled osteoderms. These are not ordered in longitudinal rows. The front rows have plates oriented along the length of the body, but to the rear the long axis of these osteoderms gradually rotates sideways, their keels ultimately running transversely. Rosettes are lacking. The configuration of the tail armour is unknown. The larger plates of all body parts were connected by small ossicles. Such small round scutes also covered the throat. Discovery and species Life restoration of two E. rugosidens from 1922, based on the 1915 AMNH specimen In 1915, the American Museum of Natural History obtained the nearly complete, articulated front half of an armoured dinosaur, found the same year by Barnum Brown in Alberta, Canada. In 1922, William Diller Matthew referred this specimen, AMNH 5381, to Palaeoscincus in a popular-science article, not indicating any particular species. It had been intended to name a new Palaeoscincus species in cooperation with Brown but their article was never published. Matthew also referred specimen AMNH 5665, the front of a skeleton found by Levi Sternberg in 1917. In 1930 Charles Whitney Gilmore referred both specimens to Palaeoscincus rugosidens. This species was based on type specimen USNM 11868, a skeleton found by George Fryer Sternberg in June 1928. The specific name is derived from Latin rugosus, \\"rough\\", and dens, \\"tooth\\". In 1940, Loris Shano Russell referred all three specimens to Edmontonia, as an Edmontonia rugosidens. Meanwhile, the type species of Edmontonia, Edmontonia longiceps, had been named by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1928. The generic name Edmontonia refers to Edmonton or the Edmonton Formation. The specific name longiceps means \\"long-headed\\" in Latin. Its holotype is specimen NMC 8531, consisting of a skull, right lower jaw and much of the postcranial skeleton, including the armour. It was discovered near Morrin in 1924 by George Paterson, the teamster of the expedition led by C.M. Sternberg. Edmontonia species include: * E. longiceps, the type, known from a complete skull, is known from the middle Horseshoe Canyon Formation (Unit 2) which used to be dated to 71.5-71 million years ago. This unit, which straddles the Campanian-Maastrichtian boundary, has since been recalibrated to an age of about 72 million years. Isolated bones and shed teeth from E. longiceps are also known from the upper Judith River Formation in Montana. Left side of E. rugosidens specimen AMNH 5665 * E. rugosidens. This species has been given its own genus, Chassternbergia, first coined as a subgenus by Dr. Robert Thomas Bakker in 1988, as Edmontonia (Chassternbergia) rugosidens and is based on differences in skull proportion from E. longiceps and its earlier time period.Bakker, R.T.

Dinosaurs of New Mexico. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 17:157-176. It was given its full generic name in 1991 by George Olshevsky.G. Olshevsky, 1991, A revision of the parainfraclass Archosauria Cope, 1869, excluding the advanced Crocodylia, Mesozoic Meanderings 2, 268 pp The name Chassternbergia honours Charles, \\"Chas\\", M. Sternberg. This subgenus or genus name is rarely applied. E. rugosidens is found in the Campanian lower Dinosaur Park Formation, dating from about 76.5-75 million years ago. Many later finds have been referred to E. rugosidens, among them CMN 8879, the top of a skull found in 1937 by Harold D'acre Robinson Lowe; ROM 433, a forked spine found by Jack Horner in 1986 among Oohkotokia material; ROM 5340, paired medial plates; ROM 1215, a skeleton; RTMP 91.36.507, a skull; RTMP 98.74.1, a possible Edmontonia skull; RTMP 98.71.1, a skeleton;Currie P.J., Russell D.A., 2005, \\"The geographic and stratigraphic distribution of articulated and associated dinosaur remains\\", In: Currie P.J., Koppelhus E.B., (editors). Dinosaur Provincial Park: A spectacular ancient ecosystem revealed. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. pp 537‚Äì569 RTMP 98.98.01, a skull and right lower jaw; and RTMP 2001.12.158, a skull. Edmontonia schlessmani was a renaming in 1992 of Denversaurus schlessmani (\\"Schlessman's Denver lizard\\") by Adrian Hunt and Spencer Lucas.Hunt, A.P. and Lucas, S.G., 1992, \\"Stratigraphy, Paleontology and age of the Fruitland and Kirkland Formations (Upper Cretaceous), San Juan Basin, New Mexico\\", New Mexico Geological Society Guidebook, 43rd Field Conference, San Juan Basin, volume 4, p. 217-240 This taxon was erected by Bakker in 1988 for a skull from the Late Maastrichtian Upper Cretaceous Lance Formation of South Dakota, specimen DMNH 468 found by Philip Reinheimer in 1922. This type specimen of Denversaurus is in the collections of the Denver Museum of Natural History (now the Denver Museum of Nature and Science), Denver, Colorado for which the genus was named. The specific name honours Lee E. Schlessman, whose Schlessman Family Foundation sponsored the museum. Bakker described the skull as being much wider at the rear than Edmontonia specimens. However, later workers explained this by its being crushed,Carpenter, K. 1990. \\"Ankylosaur systematics: example using Panoplosaurus and Edmontonia (Ankylosauria: Nodosauridae)\\", In: Carpenter, K. & Currie, P.J. (eds) Dinosaur Systematics: Approaches and Perspectives, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 281-298 and considered the taxon a junior synonym of Edmontonia longiceps. The Black Hills Institute has referred a skeleton from the Lance Formation to Denversaurus, nicknamed \\"Tank\\". It has the inventory number BHI 127327. New research indicates that it is closely related to Panoplosaurus.Burns, ME. Intraspecific Variation in Late Cretaceous Nodosaurids (Ankylosauria: Dinosauria). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, Program and Abstracts, 2015, 99‚Äì100. () Edmontonia australis was named by Tracy Lee Ford in 2000 on the basis of cervical scutes, the holotype NMMNH P-25063, a pair of medial keeled neck osteoderms from the Maastrichtian Kirtland Formation of New Mexico and the paratype NMMNH P-27450, a right middle neck plate. Although later considered to a dubious name, it is now considered a junior synonym of Glyptodontopelta mimus. The naming history was further complicated in 1971, when Walter Preston Coombs Jr renamed both Edmontonia species, into Panoplosaurus longiceps and Panoplosaurus rugosidens respectively.Coombs, W.P. Jr., 1971, The Ankylosauria, Dissertation Columbia University, New York, 487 pp The latter species, which due to its much more complete material has determined the image of Edmontonia, until 1940 thus appeared under the name of Palaeoscincus, and during the 1970s and 1980s was shown as \\"Panoplosaurus\\" until newer research revived the name Edmontonia. In 2010, G.S. Paul suggested that E. rugosidens was the direct ancestor of Edmontonia longiceps and the latter was again the direct ancestor of E. schlessmani. Phylogeny C.M. Sternberg originally did not provide a classification of Edmontonia. In 1930, L.S. Russell placed the genus in the Nodosauridae, which has been confirmed by subsequent analyses. Edmontonia was generally shown to be a derived nodosaurid, closely related to Panoplosaurus. Russell in 1940 named a separate Edmontoniinae. In 1988 Bakker proposed that the Edmontoniinae with the Panoplosaurinae should be joined into Edmontoniidae, the presumed sister group of the Nodosauridae within Nodosauroidea which he assumed not be ankylosaurians but the last surviving stegosaurians. Exact cladistic analysis has not confirmed these hypotheses however, and the concepts of Edmontoniinae and Edmontoniidae are not in modern use. The following cladogram shows the position of Edmontonia in the nodosaurid evolutionary tree according to an analysis in 2011 by paleontologists Richard Stephen Thompson, Jolyon C. Parish, Susannah C. R. Maidment and Paul M. Barrett. Paleobiology =Function of the armour= Close up of the shoulder spikes of AMNH 5665 The large spikes were probably used between males in contests of strength to defend territory or gain mates. The spikes would also have been useful for intimidating predators or rival males, passive protection, or for active self- defense. The large forward pointing shoulder spikes could have been used to run through attacking theropods. Carpenter suggested that the larger spikes of AMNH 5665 indicated this was a male specimen, a case of sexual dimorphism. However, he admitted the possibility of ontogeny, older individuals having longer spikes, as the specimen was relatively large. Traditionally it had been assumed that to protect themselves from predators, nodosaurids like Edmontonia might have crouched down on the ground to minimize the possibility of attack to their defenseless underbelly, trying to prevent being flipped over by a predator. =Paleoecology= Rings in the petrified wood of trees contemporary with Edmontonia show evidence of strong seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature; this may hold an explanation for why so many specimens have been found with their armor plating and spikes in the same position they were in life. The Edmontonia could have died due to drought, dried up, and then rapidly became covered in sediment when the rainy season began.\\"Edmontonia.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 141. . Edmontonia rugosidens existed in the upper section of the Dinosaur Park Formation, about 76.5‚Äì75 million years ago. It lived alongside numerous other giant herbivores, such as the hadrosaurids Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus and Parasaurolophus, the ceratopsids Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, and ankylosaurids Scolosaurus and Dyoplosaurus Studies of the jaw anatomy and mechanics of these dinosaurs suggests they probably all occupied slightly different ecological niches in order to avoid direct competition for food in such a crowded eco-space.Mallon, J. C., Evans, D. C., Ryan, M. J., & Anderson, J. S. (2012). Megaherbivorous dinosaur turnover in the Dinosaur Park Formation (upper Campanian) of Alberta, Canada. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. The only large predators known from the same levels of the formation as Edmontonia are the tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus libratus and an unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. Edmontonia longiceps is known from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, from the middle unit, which was dated to 71.5-71 million years ago in 2009. The fauna of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation is well-known, as vertebrate fossils, including those of dinosaurs, are quite common. Sharks, rays, sturgeons, bowfins, gars and the gar-like Aspidorhynchus made up the fish fauna. The saltwater plesiosaur Leurospondylus has been found in marine sediments in the Horseshoe Canyon, while freshwater environments were populated by turtles, Champsosaurus, and crocodilians like Leidyosuchus and Stangerochampsa. Dinosaurs dominate the fauna, especially hadrosaurs, which make up half of all dinosaurs known, including the genera Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus and Hypacrosaurus. Ceratopsians and ornithomimids were also very common, together making up another third of the known fauna. Along with much rarer ankylosaurians and pachycephalosaurs, all of these animals would have been prey for a diverse array of carnivorous theropods, including troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and caenagnathids. Adult Albertosaurus was the apex predator in this environment, with intermediate niches possibly filled by juvenile albertosaurs.Eberth, D.A., 1997, \\"Edmonton group\\". In: Currie, P.J., Padian, K.

He was the first Asian American man to win an Olympic gold medal for the United States (the second Asian American to win a gold medal overall) and the first man to win back-to-back gold medals in Olympic platform diving. Early life and education Lee was born in Fresno, California to parents of Korean descent who owned what he described as \\"a little chop suey restaurant\\". His father was fluent in English and Korean, tutored in French, graduated with a degree in civil engineering from Occidental College, and opened a chop suey restaurant and market. As a twelve- year-old living near Los Angeles in 1932, Lee saw and was motivated by the many Olympics banners and souvenirs on display for the Summer Olympics being held in Los Angeles that year. Later that summer, he found that he could do somersaults much better than all of his friends, which led to his goal of becoming an Olympic champion in diving. Lee's parents moved to Highland Park, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. At the time, however, Latinos, Asians and African-Americans were only allowed to use the nearby Brookside Park Plunge in Pasadena on Wednesdays, on what was called \\"international day\\": the day before the pool was scheduled to be drained and refilled with clean water. Because Lee needed a place to practice and could not regularly use the public pool, his coach dug a pit in his backyard and filled it with sand. Lee practiced by jumping into the pit. Lee attended Franklin High School and later was a student-athlete at Occidental, where he received his undergraduate degree before attending the University of Southern California School of Medicine, where he received his M.D. in 1947. He joined the Army Reserve to pay for his medical school tuition. Diving career Miller Anderson in 1948 Under the tutelage of renowned diving coach Jim Ryan, Lee won the United States National Diving Championships in 1942 in both the 3-meter springboard and the 10-meter platform events, becoming the first person of color to capture the United States national championship in diving. In 1946, he again triumphed at the 10-meter platform event while finishing third at the 3-meter springboard competition at the national diving competition in San Diego. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England, Lee earned a bronze medal in the 3-meter springboard and a gold medal in 10-meter platform diving events. In so doing, he became the second Asian American to earn a gold medal, behind only Vicki Draves, who won an Olympic gold medal two days earlier in springboard diving. Military and medical careers Four years later, by then a major in the United States Army Medical Corps, he expected to serve in the Korean War, but he was instead sent to compete in the Olympic Games (\\"but you better win\\", he was told). He won the gold medal in the 10-meter platform competition at the Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Lee served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps in South Korea from 1953 to 1955, where he specialized in diseases of the ear. In 1953, while serving his tour of duty in Korea, he won the James E. Sullivan Award in 1953, which is awarded annually by the Amateur Athletic Union to the most outstanding amateur athlete in the United States. He continued to experience discrimination in later life. In 1954, he faced housing discrimination in Garden Grove, California, where he attempted to buy a home only to be told that he could not, and in one case having nearby residents gather petition signatures to \\"disallow\\" or discourage him from buying in \\"their\\" neighborhood. (In the latter case, a counterpetition sought to rectify this prejudice, but the discriminatory effect had been achieved, and Lee looked elsewhere.) Lee practiced as an ear, nose and throat doctor for 35 years before retiring in 1990. Coaching Following Lee's diving career, he helped coach two-time diving gold medalist Bob Webster. Later, he coached Greg Louganis, who lived with Lee's family before winning a silver medal in platform diving at the 1976 Olympics at the age of 16. Lee also coached Olympic medalist Pat McCormick. In 1979, Lee played himself in Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story, about stuntwoman Kitty O'Neil, whom Lee had coached in diving. Honors and awards Lee was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1968, and was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1990. Sammy Lee Square, at the corner of Olympic Boulevard and Normandie Avenue in Los Angeles' Koreatown, was named after him in 2010. He was also honored with a spot on the Anaheim/Orange County Walk of Stars in 2009. The Los Angeles Unified School District honored Lee by renaming Central Region Elementary School #20 as the Dr. Sammy Lee Medical and Health Sciences Magnet School in 2013. Personal life and death Lee was married to Rosalind Wong; the couple had a daughter and a son. Lee died from complications of pneumonia on December 2, 2016 at his home in Newport Beach, California, aged 96. He also suffered from dementia and heart disease.

It contains a single species, E. caroljonesa, named by paleontologist James Kirkland in 1998. The type specimen of Eolambia was discovered by Carole and Ramal Jones in 1993; the species name honors Carole. Since then, hundreds of bones have been discovered from both adults and juveniles, representing nearly every element of the skeleton. All of the specimens have thus far been found in Emery County, Utah, in a layer of rock known as the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Measuring up to long, Eolambia is a large member of its group. While it closely approaches the Asian hadrosauroids Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and Choyrodon, in traits of the skull, vertebrae, and limbs, it may actually be more closely related to the North American Protohadros. This grouping, based on the straightness of the quadrate bone and scapula, would represent an isolated, endemic radiation of hadrosauroids. Despite resembling hadrosaurids ‚Äì lambeosaurine hadrosaurids in particular ‚Äì in several features, leading to its initial identification as one of them, these similarities have been rejected as either entirely convergent or misinterpreted. Eolambia would have lived in a forested environment at the edge of lakes in a humid floodplain environment, feeding on gymnosperms, ferns, and flowering plants. The water levels in the lakes changed over time with cyclical wet and dry spells caused by the precession of the Earth, reflected by alternating bands in the sediments of the Mussentuchit Member. As a juvenile, Eolambia would have been preyed upon by large crocodylomorphs residing in the lake waters. With increasing age, however, they became impervious to the crocodylomorphs, and mature individuals (at least eight to nine years in age) were preyed on by large theropods such as the neovenatorid Siats. History of discovery =Initial discoveries and description= The dentary of the holotype Eolambia specimen CEUM 9758 In 1979 Peter Galton and James A. Jensen described a fragmentary right femur, BYU 2000, belonging to a hadrosaurian dinosaur discovered in sediments belonging to the Cedar Mountain Formation in Arches National Park, Utah. Though poor material, it was important for it (alongside a second North American femur described in the paper) was the first hadrosaur specimen from the Lower Cretaceous anywhere in the world. Galton and Jensen hypothesized more complete remains of a hadrosaur may be found from the formation in the future. Various hadrosauroid teeth had also been found in quarries of small vertebrates in the western region of the San Rafael Swell, near Castle Dale in Emery County, Utah; they were described in 1991 by J. Michael Parrish. Subsequently, in 1993, Carole Jones and her husband Ramal Jones discovered fragmentary bones in a fossil site located in the northwestern region of the Swell. They brought the site to the attention of Donald Burge, director of the institution then called the College of Eastern Utah Prehistoric Museum (CEUM). The site, which is formally known as CEUM Locality 42em366v, would subsequently be named Carol's Site (sic) in her honour. The fossils, stored under the specimen number CEUM 9758, represent the partial remains of an adult hadrosauroid, including parts of the skull, vertebrae, ischium, and leg. CEUM 5212, a partial skull and forelimb from an adult, was found nearby in CEUM Locality 42em369v. CEUM 8786, a left femur from an adult, was discovered later in Carol's Site, and was not described until 2012. At the same time, the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History (OMNH) had recovered remains belonging to the same hadrosauroid from excavations in the southwestern region of the Swell. Specimens discovered by the OMNH initially consisted of six individuals from five localities: two juvenile skeletons, including vertebrae, scapulae, an ulna, an ilium and ischium, and hindlimb elements from locality OMNH v237; a partial juvenile skeleton, including parts of the skull, forelimbs, and hindlimbs along with a dorsal vertebra from OMNH v824; OMNH 27749, a sacrum and ischium from OMNH v696; OMNH 24389, an ischium from OMNH v214; and OMNH 32812, a partial skeleton including a scapula, two caudal vertebrae, and other unexcavated elements from OMNH v866. The OMNH also made further discoveries of the hadrosauroid's teeth in various quarries. Richard Cifelli of the OMNH allowed James Kirkland to study the collected specimens. Kirkland went on to preliminarily describe the specimens in 1994 in a conference abstract at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Eolambia was named after Lambeosaurus due to its initial interpretation as a basal lambeosaurine In a 1998 paper published in the bulletin of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Kirkland formally named the specimens as a new genus, Eolambia, with the type and only species being Eolambia caroljonesa. The generic name combines the Greek prefix eos/·º†œéœÇ (\\"dawn\\", \\"morning\\", implying \\"early\\") with the suffix lambia (derived from Lambeosaurus, which is in turn named after Canadian paleontologist Lawrence Lambe). In all, the genus name means \\"dawn (or early) lambeosaurine\\", in reference to its supposed position as the most basal lambeosaurine. Meanwhile, the specific name honors Carole Jones. The name Eolambia was suggested by paleoartist Michael Skrepnick; it replaced the informal name \\"Eohadrosaurus caroljonesi\\", which was used by Kirkland before the 1998 paper. =Subsequent discoveries= Specimen CEUM 34447, an unusually deep dentary which may or may not pertain to Eolambia Additional excavations since 1998 have revealed additional skeletal elements belonging to Eolambia. It is now the most completely-known iguanodont from between the Cenomanian and Santonian stages. Nearly every single skeletal element belonging to the taxon is represented by multiple fossils across existing collections. At least twelve individuals, including at least eight juveniles, were discovered in a quarry south of the town of Emery, including parts from both the skull and the rest of the body. The quarry is known as the Cifelli #2 Eolambia caroljonesa Quarry, or more formally CEUM locality 42em432v. Another quarry south of the town of Emery ‚Äì the Willow Springs 8 quarry, or CEUM locality 42Em576v ‚Äì preserves at least four juveniles. Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material. One specimen discovered at the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual compared to other Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is the expansion of the front end of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is possible that this individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid. Specimen FMNH PR 3847, discovered by the Field Museum of Natural History in 2008 The Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH) also conducted excavations south of the town of Emery from 2009 to 2010, with permits from the Utah Geological Survey. These excavations were conducted in a site discovered by Akiko Shinya in 2008, FMNH locality UT080821-1, which has been named Akiko's Site in her honor. During the excavations, 167 disarticulated but closely associated elements were collected in two plaster jackets. One of these plaster jackets, containing elements from the hip and vertebrae, was given the specimen number FMNH PR 3847; the specimen was subsequently described by McDonald along with Terry Gates, Lindsay Zanno, and Peter Makovicky in 2017. Another locality discovered by the FMNH is the Triple Peak quarry, FMNH locality UT130904-2, which contains a bonebed of over 400 juvenile bones that belong to at least four individuals. =Geology and dating= The sandstone block containing specimen FMNH PR 3847; these rocks are typical of the Mussentuchit Member All of the localities that Eolambia were discovered in belong to the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar Mountain Formation. Predominant rocks in the Mussentuchit consist of interleaved light gray to gray layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone. Deposits representing two separate river channel systems are also present in the Mussentuchit. The lower of these systems consists of four layers, respectively of muddy sandstone, fine-grained sandstone, silty mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone, with the latter two layers bearing plant debris. The Cifelli #2 Quarry is associated with this system. The upper system consists of greenish fine-grained sandstone. Three layers of bentonite clay layers, representing volcanic ash deposits, are also present in the Mussentuchit, being respectively whitish-gray, yellow, and tan in color. The middle of these layers cuts through the Cifelli #2 Quarry. Bentonite is also present within the sandstone itself throughout the Mussentuchit. In the Cifelli #2 quarry, the bones themselves are blackened, having been replaced by calcite, quartz, pyrite, and carbonate-hydroxyapatite. Palynology (the study of pollen), as well as studies of fossil megaflora and invertebrates, had initially suggested that the uppermost Cedar Mountain Formation ‚Äì including the Mussentuchit ‚Äì dated to the Albian stage. A 1997 argon-argon dating of sanidine crystals recovered from a volcanic ash layer in the upper Cedar Mountain Formation by Cifelli and colleagues indicated an age of 97 ¬± 0.1 million years, which was then considered to be just after the boundary between the Albian and Cenomanian stages. This is similar to the early Cenomanian age reported for the overlying Dakota Formation. Subsequently, in 2007, James Garrison and colleagues dated the volcanic ash layer passing through the Cifelli #2 Quarry ‚Äì which is likely the same layer dated previously by Cifelli and colleagues ‚Äì to 96.7 ¬± 0.5 million years ago. At an approximate level, the Cifelli and Garrison estimates agree with each other, thus indicating a Cenomanian age for Eolambia. Garrison and colleagues also re-analyzed the pollen assemblage from localities throughout the Mussentuchit, concluding that the assemblage spans the Albian-Cenomanian boundary. Description A restoration of Eolambia caroljonesa based on skeletal diagrams and related species Eolambia is a large hadrosauroid. Initial estimates placed the length of its skull at in length, although this was due to a disproportionately long snout that was later corrected by the discovery of additional material. In 2016, Gregory S. Paul estimated a body length of and a weight of for Eolambia, which agrees with a prior body length estimate of by Thomas R. Holtz Jr. in 2012. Earlier, in 2008, an adult specimen was estimated as having a length of and a height at the hip of . =Skull= Maxillae of Eolambia The crestless skull of Eolambia has a similar overall shape to those of Equijubus and Probactrosaurus. The front of the snout is highly roughened, being punctuated by many foramina (openings). At the tip of each premaxilla, there are two tooth-like structures known as denticles, which is also seen in its closest relative Protohadros. Further back, the rear portion of the lower branch of the premaxilla abruptly projects upwards, closing off the nostril at the rear as in Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. This part joins with the two finger-like processes of the maxilla, which is similar to Protohadros. The body of the maxilla itself does not bear a recess or any indication of an antorbital fenestra, like Equijubus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. One of the characteristics used to distinguish Eolambia is the concave profile of the tooth row of the maxilla when viewed from the side, which is like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Protohadros. Like Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids, the back of the maxilla connects to the jugal ‚Äì which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra ‚Äì through a finger-like projection that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a roughened surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At the back of the skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion of the back of the skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids. Dentary of Eolambia As with the premaxilla, the predentary of Eolambia bore denticles. There is a prominent dorsomedial process, a tab-like structure also seen in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauriforms. Several additional tab-like denticles were present on either side of the dorsomedial process, which are likewise present in Probactrosaurus. The predentary is joined at the back by the dentary, which constitutes most of the lower jaw. There is a short recess, or diastema, between the articulation of the predentary with the dentary and the first tooth position on the dentary, which is observed in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and other hadrosauroids. The front of the dentary characteristically deepens, as in Protohadros, Ouranosaurus, and Bactrosaurus. Two bulges are present on the outer surface of the dentary, one of them representing the coronoid process as in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids. Like Protohadros and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Probactrosaurus, only the front end of this process is thickened. As in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and various other iguanodonts, a small foramen is present on the side of the surangular, which is located behind the dentary. Similar to other iguanodonts, the teeth of Eolambia are arranged in tightly- spaced and interlocking rows. At any given time, each of the 32 maxillary tooth sockets holds three teeth, while each of the 30 dentary tooth sockets holds four teeth. Out of these, two of the teeth in each socket are replacement teeth like those of Probactrosaurus; the others are active teeth. Every active tooth has one wear facet. Like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids, each maxillary tooth crown has only one ridge, which is slightly offset towards the midline of the mouth. Meanwhile, each dentary tooth crown characteristically bears a primary ridge, and an accessory ridge closer to the midline of the mouth, a condition which is also present in Protohadros and other hadrosauroids. All of the crowns also bear small, denticle-like serrations on the front and rear edges, which is also seen in Probactrosaurus. =Vertebral column= Cervical vertebrae of Eolambia, showing unusual third cervical (A) Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other styracosternans, Eolambia has cervical vertebrae which are very opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, the front end of the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate articular processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further articular processes ‚Äì the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses ‚Äì are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections. Dorsal vertebrae of Eolambia, showing transition in location of vertebral processes The first few dorsal vertebrae are similar to the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses at the front of the vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals. Among the Eolambia specimens found to date, the best-preserved sacrum includes seven vertebrae. Given that this individual is immature, and hadrosaurs increase their sacral vertebra count with age, adults may have had more sacrals. The caudal (tail) vertebrae are amphicoelous, having both the front and back ends being concave. They have pedestal-like prezygapophyses and tab- like postzygapophyses, the latter of which are separated by a depression. The prezygapophyses lengthen to become stalks and the postzygapophyses shrink in the middle and rear caudals. Furthermore, the neural spines transition from rectangular to strongly curved (concave in front and convex behind), the centra become more elongated, and the transverse processes disappear as well. =Limbs and limb girdles= Shoulder girdle elements of Eolambia, including scapula (C-D) Like Probactrosaurus, the scapular blade of Eolambia is nearly rectangular, with the sides of the blade being straight and meeting the end of the blade at an almost-right angle. The humerus is bowed towards the midline, and the deltopectoral crest on the humerus is prominently thickened. A knob is present on the outer surface of the joint with the radius on the humerus. Both the ulna and the radius are relatively straight bones. The top of the ulna bears three \\"prongs\\", namely the olecranon process and two additional triangular flanges. Meanwhile, the radius bears a flattened inner surface at the top end, and a distinct platform on the inner surface at the bottom end, both for articulating with the ulna. The hand has five digits. Among the metacarpal bones of the hand, the second is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. Like Iguanodon, Probactrosaurus, and other basal iguanodonts, the claw on the first digit is distinctively conical. The second and third claws are hoof-like, with the third claw bearing roughened flanges on its sides ‚Äì a trait also shared with other iguanodonts. Lower leg of Eolambia The preacetabular (i.e. located in front of the hip socket) process of the ilium bears a horizontal \\"boot\\" which forms an obtuse angle with the bottom of the process. Additionally, the top edge of the bone projects outwards to form a rim located above the ilium-ischium articulation on the bottom edge of the bone. These traits are also seen in Probactrosaurus and other iguanodonts. The hip socket itself is quite large relative to the ilium for an iguanodont. A distinctive flange is present along the top surface of the ilium, a trait which is shared with an unnamed hadrosauroid from the Woodbine Formation. The postacetabular (i.e. located behind the hip socket) process of the ilium tapers at its rear with no break in its top margin. On the pubis, the forward-projecting process expands towards the front, like Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts. The shaft of the ischium is characteristically straight in adults (juveniles have a curved shaft, which is more common among iguanodonts), and the bottom of the shaft bears a compressed \\"boot\\" that is expanded forwards. Like the humerus, the femur is bowed, but outwards. However, characteristically, the bottom half of the femur is straight. The fourth trochanter, located halfway down the femur, is vertically tall and triangular, similar to Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, and other iguanodonts but dissimilar to more basal ornithopods. Like the ulna and radius, the tibia and fibula have straight shafts, and they articulate with each other; a roughened projection on the bottom of the fibula fits between two bulb-like condyles located just behind the cnemial crest on the bottom end of the tibia. The top of the tibia is rough, indicating the presence of a cap of cartilage between the femur and tibia. The foot has four digits. Like the metacarpals, the second metatarsal is curved, the third is straight, and the fourth is strongly curved. The phalanges of the foot are very stout, with the terminal phalanges near the end of each digit being particularly stout. As with the second and third claws on the hand, the second, third, and fourth claws of the foot are uniformly broad, flat, and hoof-like. Classification =Initial hadrosaurid identification= Teeth of Eolambia In Kirkland's initial description of Eolambia, he considered it to be a member of the Hadrosauridae, as defined by David B. Weishampel, David B. Norman, and Dan Grigorescu in 1993. Weishampel and colleagues used seven unifying characteristics to define the Hadrosauridae: the upward expansion of the ascending process of the maxilla; the absence of the paraquadrate foramen, which separates the quadrate and quadratojugal; the location of the angular on the inner surface of the lower jaw; the absence of the surangular foramen on the surangular; the narrow teeth of the maxilla; the presence of three or more teeth in each dentary tooth position; and the reduction of the top margin of the scapular blade. The first, fifth, sixth, and seventh of these traits were recognized in Eolambia, with the rest being unknown due to missing material. Kirkland further assigned Eolambia to the Euhadrosauria, defined by Weishampel and colleagues to include the common ancestor of Hadrosaurinae (now the Saurolophinae) and Lambeosaurinae ‚Äì the two primary branches of hadrosaurids ‚Äì and all of its descendants. This assignment was based on five characteristics, all present in Eolambia: the presence of denticles on the premaxilla; the quadrate's narrow joint with the lower jaw; the narrow dentary teeth; the presence of a single edge, or carina, on each dentary tooth; and the angled deltopectoral crest on the humerus. Caudal vertebrae of Eolambia; note the tall neural spines Within the Hadrosauridae, Kirkland further considered Eolambia to either be a basal member of the Lambeosaurinae, or the sister group of Lambeosaurinae. He identified five characteristics shared with the Lambeosaurinae, as defined across various studies: the absence of a foramen on the premaxilla; the (at least partial) enclosure of the nostril by the premaxilla; the development of a shelf on the maxilla; the very tall neural spines of the caudal vertebrae; the robustness of the humerus; and the large \\"boot\\" of the ischium in adults. Kirkland found that two additional traits separated the crestless Eolambia from other, crested lambeosaurines, which were considered as being related to the development of the crest: the elevation of the nasal cavity above the eye socket, and the shortening of the parietal. If Eolambia were to be recognized as a lambeosaurine, then the Lambeosaurinae would have to be redefined to exclude those two traits. Alternatively, if Eolambia was instead the sister group of the Lambeosaurinae, then it would represent a morphology in hadrosaurids that is close to the divergence between hadrosaurines and lambeosaurines. This possibility is supported by the presence of a groove on the bottom of the sacrum of Eolambia, which was recognized by Kirkland as a defining trait of hadrosaurines ‚Äì albeit one convergently present in the Ankylosauria and Ceratopsia. To support the lambeosaurine affinities of Eolambia, Kirkland conducted a phylogenetic analysis; the tree recovered by his analysis, which accordingly places Eolambia as the most basal lambeosaurine, is reproduced below. Despite the evidence he cited in support of this position, Kirkland also noted a seemingly inconsistent trait. As observed in the juvenile ilium he initially described, the antitrochanter ‚Äì a projection on the ilium that limits the greater trochanter of the femur ‚Äì is more poorly developed than would be expected for a basal hadrosaurid. Michael Brett-Surman noted that adults may have had a better-developed antitrochanter. On the other hand, the derived lambeosaurine Hypacrosaurus has a well- developed antitrochanter even at the hatchling stage. Kirkland noted the possibility that basal hadrosaurids developed their antitrochanter later in life than derived hadrosaurids such as Hypacrosaurus. He thus remarked that adult Eolambia specimens would resolve this issue. Pelvic girdle elements of Eolambia ‚Äì ilium (A-B), ischium (C-D), pubis (E-F) Sacrum of Eolambia; note the groove on the bottom surface (A) =Reidentification as non-hadrosaurid= Premaxilla of Eolambia In 2001, Jason Head re-evaluated the phylogenetic position of Eolambia based on specimens stored at the OMNH. He recognized Kirkland's identification of supposed lambeosaurine distinguishing traits in Eolambia as either erroneous or dubious. As demonstrated by Head, there is actually a foramen on the premaxilla; the premaxilla only borders the nostril on the bottom edge; there are two finger-like processes at the front of the maxilla in addition to the shelf; high neural spines of the caudal vertebrae also occur in the non-lambeosaurines Ouranosaurus and Bactrosaurus; and the expansion of the tip of the ischium also occurs in Camptosaurus, Iguanodon, Ouranosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, indicating that the expansion is plesiomorphic for iguanodonts and was secondarily lost in hadrosaurines. While M.L. Casanovas and colleagues in 1999 characterized lambeosaurines as having a \\"expanded foot\\" at the tip of the ischium, as opposed to a \\"club- like\\" condition, Head argued that Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus have ischial tips no more an expanded than those of Mantellisaurus or Ouranosaurus. Skull of Probactrosaurus, the closest relative of Eolambia according to Head Head also demonstrated that the teeth of Eolambia were broader and more asymmetrical than Kirkland had assumed; he also noted that subadults only possessed two teeth per tooth position, unlike hadrosaurids, although adult specimens in fact have the three or more tooth positions as originally demonstrated by Kirkland. Head further showed that Eolambia possessed seven sacral vertebrae, unlike eight or more in derived hadrosaurids, and that its antitrochanter was actually more poorly developed than those of Ouranosaurus and Altirhinus. Examination of the OMNH specimens further demonstrated that the postacetabular region of the ilium did not form a distinct process, and the articulations at the bottom of the femur are not very prominent, both of which separate Eolambia from more derived iguanodonts such as hadrosaurids. Thus, Head concluded that Eolambia was a basal member of the Hadrosauroidea, outside of the Hadrosauridae, a conclusion supported by a phylogenetic analysis finding it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid closely related to Probactrosaurus. =Subsequent research= Skull of Altirhinus, considered by Norman as the sister group of Eolambia but now known to be more basal In 2004, Norman included Eolambia for the first time in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts, as part of a chapter focusing on iguanodonts in the second edition of The Dinosauria. He found that Eolambia was the sister group to Altirhinus, with both of them being more basal than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, or the Hadrosauridae. Within the same volume, Horner, Weishampel, and Catherine Forster conducted a separate phylogenetic analysis of hadrosaurids, likewise including Eolambia. They found Eolambia again as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, albeit as the sister group to Protohadros. Although Head had specifically redefined the Hadrosauridae, based on shared characteristics, to include Protohadros, Horner and colleagues adapted a taxon-based definition that excluded Protohadros and thus Eolambia. They also identified additional characteristics differentiating Eolambia from hadrosaurids: there are coarse denticles on the teeth of the dentary, and the coronoid process is weakly expanded. Quadrate of Eolambia Variance in recovered phylogenetic positions for Eolambia persisted in following years. In the 2009 description of Levnesovia, Hans-Dieter Sues and Alexander Averianov found that Protohadros occupied an intermediate position relative to Altirhinus and Probactrosaurus, being the sister group of Fukuisaurus. Meanwhile, in accordance with the results of Horner and colleagues, Albert Prieto-M√°rquez and Mark Norell found in 2010 that Eolambia was instead the sister group of Protohadros. He also noted features of Eolambia that were convergent upon hadrosaurids: the presence of a single tooth carina; the nearly-square outer corner of the predentary; and the midpoint of the quadratojugal notch (which articulates with the quadratojugal) being located roughly halfway up the surface of the quadrate (being located less than 60% of the bone's height down from the top). In 2012, Holtz classified Eolambia as a primitive member of the Styracosterna along with Altirhinus. In 2012, McDonald conducted a phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts incorporating data from new Eolambia specimens. Contrary to previous authors, he found instead that Eolambia was the sister group of Probactrosaurus. This close relationship was based on two shared characteristics: the quadrate being straight save for the top end, which is curved backwards; and the top and bottom margins of the scapular blade being nearly parallel. Wenjie Zheng and colleagues added Jintasaurus to the group in 2014, while Jos√© Gasca and colleagues recovered the original group in 2015. However, McDonald extensively revised his phylogenetic dataset further in preparation for the 2017 description of the FMNH specimens. As with Horner and colleagues, as well as Prieto-M√°rquez and Norell, McDonald and colleagues found that Eolambia was the sister group of Protohadros, with both of them being placed as basal hadrosauromorphs (results reproduced below). Using the 2012 version of the McDonald dataset, Francisco Verd√∫ and colleagues independently recovered a similar result, with Eolambia being closely related to Protohadros and Jeyawati; however, McDonald and colleagues found the latter to be more derived in 2017. Reconstruction of Jintasaurus, recovered by Zheng et al. as a sister group of Eolambia In 2018, Terry Gates and colleagues described the new iguanodotian genus Choyrodon, from the same locality as Altirhinus, considered in the past a relative of Eolambia. Their phylogenetic analysis, based on the matrix of Norman (2015), found Choyrodon to be the sister taxon of Eolambia. Eolambias commonly recovered relative Protohadros was not present in this matrix. Three characteristics supported this sister relationship: a trapezoidally-shaped occiput, and two shared traits of the teeth. The placement of these genera relative to other hadrosauriformes depended on whether the antorbital fenestra was coded as present or absent in Choyrodon; the juvenile type specimen has one, but the possibility that adults would have a closed one couldn't be ruled out. The following two trees (labelled with clades identified by Gates and colleagues in the text) show the results with it coded as present and absent respectively, the former showing a large polytomy: Topology A: Antorbital fenestra coded as present in Choyrodon Topology B: Antorbital fenestra coded as closed externally in Choyrodon Paleobiology Eggshells possibly belonging to Eolambia have been discovered at various localities alongside isolated teeth. They have reticular (net-like) surface patterns, and have a thickness of . =Growth= Cross section of a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847; LAGs marked by arrows Being known from a variety of juvenile and adult specimens, the changes Eolambia underwent as it grew are well-documented. The number of teeth in the maxilla increased with age, from 23 in a juvenile to 33 in an adult. A similar increase occurred in the dentary teeth, from 18‚Äì22 in juveniles to 25‚Äì30 in adults. While juveniles lack secondary ridges on the crowns of their dentary teeth, faint secondary ridges are present in adults. The size of the \\"boot\\" of the ischium also increased with age, as documented by Kirkland. Changes may also have occurred in the straightness of the shaft of the ischium, as documented by specimens discovered by the FMNH. Skeletal diagram comparing the known material of the holotype adult (right) and a juvenile individual (left) Results from a histological analysis performed on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling has occurred in the internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable. Since LAGs can be obliterated by bone remodeling, this represents an underestimate of the true number of LAGs that had actually developed; McDonald and colleagues estimated three or four missing LAGs by examining the spacing between the visible LAGs. This indicates that the animal was eight to nine years old when it died. The spacing between the LAGs decreases significantly towards the outer surface, indicating that growth was slowing, but the lack of the external fundamental system (a series of tightly- spaced LAGs) indicates that growth had not yet ceased. This is consistent with the unfused sutures between the centra and neural spines in the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and the unfused sutures between the sacral centra and their corresponding ribs. Overall, the growth rate of Eolambia appears to have been comparable to that of Hypacrosaurus and Maiasaura, which reached maturity after seven or eight years. Paleoecology =Environment and taphonomy= The precession of the Earth influenced the local climate Sedimentological data from the Mussentuchit Member indicates that Eolambia lived on a poorly-drained floodplain, around a system of large, perennial lakes. The lakes fluctuated between high and low water levels in Milankovitch cycles of roughly 21,000 years, caused by the Earth's axial precession. These cycles is reflected by the alternating layers of muddy sandstone and mudstone in present-day rock deposits. During dry periods, the exposed lakebed formed a broad beach devoid of plants. The cracked mud of the lakebed produced mud clasts, while organic debris and scavenged carcasses were scattered around the water's edge as the lake progressively retreated. Meanwhile, during periods in which the sea level rose, small rivers invaded the floodplain, which reworked and displaced the debris that had been deposited during the dry season. Shoreline debris at the present-day Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park Most of the fossils discovered in the Mussentuchit are scattered and disarticulated, with intact skeletons being relatively rare. Although the lakes did not actively destroy bones, it was not particularly conducive to good preservation either due to the long duration of the burial process. Before burial, scavengers could have disrupted the skeletal material, which is evident in the severed Eolambia tibiae bearing tooth marks discovered in the Cifelli #2 quarry. The regression of the lake could have occasionally created bogs, but they would not have been permanent enough to entrap and preserve larger vertebrates. Action by water currents seems to have played a role in the deposition of Eolambia bones in the Cifelli #2 quarry, where the bones are largely deposited at 28¬∞, 69¬∞, 93¬∞, 131¬∞ and 161¬∞ azimuth (i.e. relative to north). These directions would have been parallel or sub-parallel to the edges of the lake, indicating orientation by lake currents, except for the 69¬∞ and 93¬∞ azimuths, which probably represent river currents. The abundant plant debris, combined with the absence of sink (playa) deposits, indicates that the local climate was relatively humid during the deposition of the Mussentuchit. This is in marked contrast to earlier deposits in the area, which are calcareous (chalky), indicating periods of aridity lasting up to 10,000 years. Paleoclimatic reconstructions support these interpretations, with the encroachment of the Mowry Sea from the north (a process which would eventually form the Western Interior Seaway) resulting in arid (Mid-latitude Continental Interior) climates being replaced by more humid (Mid-latitude East Coast) climates. With a paleolatitude of 46¬∞ N, the Mussentuchit would have had a warm mean surface temperature of , about warmer than the present day, according to general circulation models. =Ecosystem= Pholidosaurids like Sarcosuchus, shown here, might have lived alongside Eolambia Crocodylomorphs are abundant in the Mussentuchit deposits, being represented largely by teeth. The largest known teeth have been referred to the Pholidosauridae; they are broad with rounded bases, and some of them bear longitudinal ridges. These large crocodilians would have been capable of preying upon at least juvenile Eolambia at the water's edge. The abundance of juvenile Eolambia specimens in the lakeside fossil material supports this hypothesis; larger Eolambia would have been invulnerable to crocodilians. Smaller crocodilian teeth are also present, with two distinct morphotypes: an ovoid form bearing ridges, which has been referred to two different species of Bernissartia; and a compressed, triangular form bearing heavy ornamentation, which has been attributed to the Atoposauridae. However, given the uniform small size of these teeth, and the co-occurrence of these morphotypes in some crocodilians, they may belong to the same species. Skeleton of the co-existing nodosaurid Animantarx Larger Eolambia would have been vulnerable to the large neovenatorid theropod Siats, which was discovered by expeditions from the FMNH. A variety of smaller maniraptoran theropods are also present in the Mussentuchit, which would have functioned as scavengers; their remains include teeth attributed to the Dromaeosauridae, Paronychodon, and Richardoestesia. As for herbivorous dinosaurs, the nodosaurid Animantarx was discovered in Carol's Site, near the type specimen of Eolambia. Teeth belonging to more basal ornithopods have also been discovered, with similar teeth having been referred to the Pachycephalosauria or to toothed birds by Cifelli in 1999. More complete remains referred to two different ornithopods ‚Äì an orodromine and a basal iguanodont ‚Äì remain unpublished. A giant oviraptorosaur has also been discovered, alongside teeth from ceratopsians and sauropods. Fish, which may have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are represented by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing a canopy of tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia. =Paleobiogeography= Leg bones of Eolambia ‚Äì femur (A-F), tibia (G-L), fibula (M-N) Kirkland, Cifelli, and colleagues noted that the fauna of the Mussentuchit ‚Äì iguanodonts, pachycephalosaurs, and ceratopsians ‚Äì bears strong similarities to contemporary Asian faunas. They proposed that Eolambia was part of an influx of Asian dinosaurs into North America during the Cenomanian, which supplanted the earlier low-diversity native fauna. This hypothesis is supported by the close relationship between Eolambia and either Probactrosaurus or Fukuisaurus, which have respectively been recovered by the phylogenies of Head and Sues & Averianov. However, the results of Horner and colleagues, Prieto-M√°rquez, and McDonald and colleagues, which consider the North American Protohadros to be the closest relative of Eolambia, contradict this hypothesis. This alternative interpretation suggests that the common ancestor of Eolambia, Protohadros, and more derived hadrosauroids was not exclusively Asian, but instead distributed across Asia and North America. McDonald and colleagues further suggested that Eolambia and Protohadros represent a localized group of hadrosauroids endemic to North America, much like other groups of styracosternans throughout the Cretaceous. Such contemporary groups included a central Asian group of Shuangmiaosaurus, Zhanghenglong, and Plesiohadros.

He subsequently established the Sunshine Harvester Works, which became one of Australia's largest manufacturers of agricultural equipment. Early life Elmore, Victoria, Australia. McKay was born the fifth child of a family of twelve near Drummartin, between Elmore and Raywood, Victoria. His parents were Irish Protestants from Monaghan in Ulster who arrived in Victoria in 1852. His father, Nathaniel McKay had been a stonemason and then a miner, before becoming a farmer around the end of 1845. Hugh attended Drummartin Primary School, and received some education from his father Nathaniel, before returning to the farm at 13. In 1883 he read about combine harvesters in California. With his brother John and his father he built a prototype stripper-harvester by January 1885 and patented the Sunshine Harvester on 24 March 1885, which revolutionised wheat harvesting and sold throughout the world. Although he lost a Victorian Government prize for the first working stripper-harvester to James Morrow in 1885, he successfully commercialised his invention, and had them built under contract in Melbourne and Bendigo. In 1888, he opened a working factory in Ballarat. In 1891 he married Sarah Irene Graves. He later acquired the Braybrook Implement Works, and renamed it the Sunshine Harvester Works after his Sunshine Harvester. In 1907, the residents of Braybrook Junction voted to rename the suburb Sunshine. The plant was expanded rapidly and at its peak employed nearly 3000 workers. It was the largest factory in Australia and as an example of entrepreneurship has probably not been surpassed in Australia. Sunshine Gardens In 1909 the Sunshine Gardens were developed to provide an amenity for the employees of the Sunshine Harvester Works. Designed by the assistant city engineer at Ballarat Mr F. A. Horsfall and laid out by head gardener S. G. Thompson, the eight-acre Gardens were sited alongside the factory and incorporated recreation facilities and popular horticultural displays.Bampton, B., 'H. V. McKay Gardens, Sunshine: an industrial garden 100 years on‚Äô, Australian Garden History, 21 (3), 2010, pp. 10‚Äì15. According to Bill Bampton, the Gardens included tennis courts and pavilion, a bandstand, a bowling green, a substantial house for the head gardener, a conservatory and associated works areas. Under inaugural curator Thompson (1909‚Äì27), and curators James Willan (1930‚Äì39) and Harold Gray (1939‚Äì50), the Gardens developed a reputation for its chrysanthemums and dahlias, attracting workers and their families, as well as other local residents. In 1953, the management of Sunshine Gardens was handed to the newly established City of Sunshine. At this time, it was renamed the H.V. McKay Memorial Gardens. In the 1990s, the garden was listed by the National Trust of Australia and in the Register of the National Estate. In 2007 the Friends of McKay Gardens was formed to help maintain the gardens. Harvester judgement A dispute between McKay and the unions representing the Sunshine workers was heard before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in Melbourne between 7 October 1907 and 8 November 1907. H. B. Higgins heard evidence from employees and their wives. In the Harvester Judgement, he obliged McKay to pay his employees a wage that guaranteed them a standard of living which was reasonable for \\"a human being in a civilised community\\", regardless of his capacity to pay. McKay successfully appealed this judgement, but it became the basis of the basic wage, which dominated Australian economic life for the next 60 to 80 years. Later life McKay died at Rupertswood, a mansion in Sunbury, Victoria (notable as the birthplace of the Ashes) on 21 May 1926 and was survived by his wife, his daughter Hilda Stevenson and his two sons. His will was valued at ¬£1,448,146; a codicil vested the income from 100,000 shares in the H. V. McKay Charitable Trust, chaired by George Swinburne. The trust's aims are to improve country life and aid charity in Sunshine. Honours He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. H.V. McKay Memorial Gardens are named for him.

During the late 1970s the company also marketed a range of portable pianos ready-fitted with the pickups. These instruments were built by Kimball to Helpinstill's specifications. The company's founder and namesake, Charles Helpinstill, performs in Houston with his band, Ezra Charles and The Texas Blues Band. Description The Helpinstill pickup comprises three (or four in the case of some uprights) long electromagnetic bar pickups which can be temporarily attached to a piano's iron frame with magnets and clamps. The pickups only sense vibrations from the strings, virtually eliminating the possibility of feedback. A small mixer allows the pianist or sound engineer to adjust the output balance of the pickups. The Melodipro piano In the mid-1970s, the Aeolian piano company marketed the Melodipro upright piano, a semi-roadworthy version of its Melodigrand 64-note piano fitted with a Helpinstill pickup system. The shortcomings of this instrument inspired Helpinstill to produce its own completely portable instruments. Helpinstill pianos Three models were produced between 1977 and about 1980. All were true acoustic pianos with soundboards. =Roadmaster 88 and 64 models= These were uprights, built into aluminium flightcases on casters with fold-away keyboards and sustain pedals. The 88 offered a full piano range while the 64 lacked the top and bottom octaves. =Portable Grand= This was an 88-note baby grand without its heavy outer case, and designed to separate into a keyboard and a \\"harp\\" section with removable \\"hairpin\\"-style legs. A fibreglass cover was fitted to the \\"harp\\" in lieu of a traditional case and lid. This made the instrument considerably lighter than a traditional grand of the same size. Both instruments are still renowned for their authentic sound when amplified, and the Helpinstill pickup remains an industry standard.

The gallery's exhibitions often coincide with a public programme including artist talks, symposia, screenings, workshops and reading groups. It was originally called Untitled Gallery. Sharna Jackson has been in post as Artistic Director since July 2018, co- directing alongside Judith Harry. Details Site Gallery is a registered charity.Its charity registration number is 510322. It must raise the funds to deliver exhibitions, event and produce events. It was founded officially in 1979 with a funding grant from Yorkshire Arts (Arts Council England) and began as an independent photography gallery in the Walkley area of Sheffield in 1978. During the period between 1979 and 1985 the gallery expanded to offer space for workshops, offices and darkrooms, whilst touring exhibitions throughout Britain. In 1988, the gallery moved to 1 Brown Street under the guidance of gallery director Matthew Conduit. In 1995 the gallery expanded to incorporate new digital and multimedia work alongside its traditional image production. In 1996 the gallery changed its name to Site Gallery. In July 2014 the gallery secured funding from the Arts Council to redevelop the building and increase the size of the galleries. A shop in Site Gallery stocks products made by artists and designers as well as a variety of magazines and greetings cards. Site Gallery exhibits work by nationally and internationally based artists, commissioned new work or UK premieres, of international standard as well as emergent talent. The programme maintains a balance between photography, installation, electronic media and film and video work. The gallery has hosted individual shows of high-profile artists, including the first UK solo show of Sophie Calle. Other events have included exhibitions by Susan Hiller, Breda Beban, Mat Collishaw, George Chakravarthi, Susan Philipsz and Paul Rooney, Marie-Jo Lafontaine, and Wendy McMurdo.

Discovery and naming Nopcsa's 1905 skeletal restoration In 1870, workers at the Summertown Brick Pit, just north of Oxford, England, found the skeleton of a theropod. The remains were acquired by the local bookseller James Parker, who brought them to the attention of Oxford Professor John Phillips. Phillips described the bones in 1871, but did not name them.Phillips, J., 1871, Geology of Oxford and the Valley of the Thames. 529 pp At the time, the remains represented the most complete skeleton of a large theropod ever found. Eustreptospondylus is still the most complete of any large Jurassic European theropod. In 1890, the skeleton was bought by Oxford University, and Arthur Smith Woodward examined it and referred it to Megalosaurus bucklandi. In 1905 and 1906 Baron Franz Nopcsa reassigned the skeleton to the species, Streptospondylus cuvieri, which had been first described by Sir Richard Owen in 1842, based on a now lost vertebra from the Bathonian stage of the Jurassic period.Owen, R. (1842). \\"Report on British fossil reptiles\\". Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 11: 60‚Äì204 The reason for this assignment was that the type species Streptospondylus altdorfensis from France, was a clearly related form, and Nopcsa decided to subsume all British material of this nature under a single Streptospondylus species, for which then the name S. cuvieri could not be avoided.Nopcsa, F., 1905, \\"Notes on British dinosaurs. Part III: Streptospondylus\\", Geological Magazine 5: 289-293Nopcsa, F., 1906, \\"Zur Kenntnis des Genus Streptospondylus\\", Beitr√§ge zur Pal√§ontologie und Geologie √ñsterreich-Ungarns und des Orients: Mitteilungen des Geologischen und Pal√§ontologischen Institutes der Universit√§t Wien 19: 59-83 The assignment of a rather complete find to a species based on very poor remains was troublesome. This was compounded by German palaeontologist Friedrich von Huene, who sometime referred to the specimen as Streptospondylus cuvieri and at other times considered it a species of Megalosaurus: Megalosaurus cuvieri.Huene, F. von, 1926, \\"The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe\\", Revista del Museo de La Plata, 29: 1-167 In 1964, Alick Donald Walker clarified matters by erecting a separate genus and species for the Oxford specimen: Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis. The genus name Eustreptospondylus, was intended to mean \\"true Streptospondylus\\". Streptospondylus means \\"turned vertebra\\", and is derived from the Greek words streptos (œÉœÑœÅŒµœÄœÑŒøœÇ) meaning \\"reversed\\" and spondylus (œÉœÄŒøŒΩŒ¥œÖŒªŒøœÇ), a reference to the fact that its dorsal vertebrae were opisthocoelous, in contrast to the typical procoelous vertebrae of crocodiles. The specific name \\"oxoniensis\\", refers to its provenance from Oxford. Von Huene's 1923 restoration of Streptospondylus cuvieri, which actually depicts Eustreptospondylus The holotype, OUM J13558, was recovered by W. Parker from claystone in a marine layer of the Stewartby Member of the Oxford Clay Formation, which dates to the Callovian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 162 million years ago. It consists of a rather complete skeleton, with a skull which is missing elements including the nasal bones, the jugals, the rear ends of the lower jaws, the lower arms and the end of the tail. It represents a subadult individual. The only other specimen ever referred to Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis is OUMNH J.29775, a left ilium. The holotype was fully prepared and exhibited in 1924, in a rather erect position. In the early twenty-first century a new display changed this to a horizontal position of the body. Modern skeletal restoration In 2000, Oliver Walter Mischa Rauhut found that only minor differences in the hip bones ‚Äî a more upward extending fusion of the \\"feet\\" of the pubic bones ‚Äî make Eustreptospondylus different from a previously known megalosaurid called Magnosaurus, and in 2003 he proposed that they should be the same genus, which would make the full species name Magnosaurus oxoniensis. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul considered the species identical to Streptospondylus altdorfensis.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 89 The first detailed description of the Eustreptospondylus material was in 1906 by Nopcsa. A modern description was published in 2008 by Rudyard Sadleir e.a.R. Sadleir, P.M. Barrett and H.P. Powell, 2008, The anatomy and systematics of Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis, a theropod dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, England, Monograph of the Palaeontological Society, 160(627) 82 pp In 1964, Walker also named a second species of Eustreptospondylus: Eustreptospondylus divesensis, based on a French find. In 1977 this became the separate genus Piveteausaurus. Description Size comparison of E. oxoniensis The main specimen of Eustreptospondylus was not fully grown, and according to an estimate by Paul in 1988 was about long and weighed about . Various estimates suggest that Eustreptospondylus was an \\"average-sized\\" theropod, with a hypothetical adult length of around , and a mass of . The skull of Eustreptospondylus has a rather pointed snout in side view, with a large horizontally oriented nostril. There is no lacrimal horn. The skull roof is relatively thick. Oblique grooves in the jaw joints caused the gape of the mouth to be widened when the lower jaws were opened. These jaws at the front are rather tall and wide. No teeth have been preserved in either the upper or lower jaws, but the size of its toothsockets proves that the third tooth of the lower jaw was enlarged. Though not keeled, the front dorsal vertebrae have paired hypapophyses at their undersides, just as with Streptospondylus altdorfensis. =Distinguishing anatomical features= Skull fragments, NHM Sadleir et al. (2008) established several traits that distinguish Eustreptospondylus from its direct relatives. In the corner of the lacrimal a shallow depression is present, which is pierced by a smaller foramen. The descending branch of the postorbital has a groove in its outer rear corner. The outer side of the squamosal has a well-developed drooping flange covering, in side view, the upper rear part of the lateral temporal fenestra. The tenth neck vertebra has a clear depression on its front underside. The neck and dorsal vertebrae are not keeled. In 2012 Matthew Carrano added to these traits. The peduncle of the ilium to which the pubic bone is attached, is as transversely wide as it is long from front to rear. With the rear blade of the ilium, the lower edge of the outer blade side is turned upwards to an almost horizontal position, creating and denuding over its total length a bone surface, the \\"brevis shelf\\", forming the internal face of the inner blade side ‚Äî this shelf with dinosaurs functions as an attachment area for a tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis.M.T. Carrano, R.B.J. Benson, and S.D. Sampson, 2012, \\"The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\\", Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 10(2): 211-300 Sadleir also found additional traits proving that Eustreptospondylus differed from Magnosaurus nethercombensis in more than a single detail. The interdental plates reinforcing the back of the teeth are longer from front to rear than they are tall; with M. nethercombensis the opposite is true. Seen from above, the pubic bone forms transversely a more narrow part of the lower rim of the hip joint. Seen from behind, the upper part of the inner side of the thighbone is straight. The cnemial crest of the upper shinbone has no ridge running to the front and below, on its outer side. Classification In 1964, Walker assigned Eustreptrospondylus to the Megalosauridae, which was historically included in a paraphyletic \\"Carnosauria\\", though sometimes a separate Eustreptospondylidae was recognised.S.M. Kurzanov, 1989, \\"O proiskhozhdenii i evolyutsii infraotryada dinozavrov Carnosauria\\", Paleontologicheskiy Zhurnal 1989(4): 3-14 Today Eustreptospondylus is commonly considered a member of the Eustreptospondylinae, clade within the Megalosauridae. A possible position of Eustreptospondylus in the evolutionary tree is given by this cladogram based on a cladistic analysis by Carrano et.al.: Paleobiology Eustreptospondylus feeding on an ichthyosaur =Diet= Eustreptospondylus, like many other theropods, fed on smaller dinosaurs and pterosaurs, or scavenged the carcasses of fishes, marine reptiles, and other dinosaurs. It might have foraged on shorelines for carcasses and marine life. Reconstructed skull, showing known remains of the holotype in white =Swimming= Eustreptospondylus is known from a fossil from on an island, at a time when Europe consisted mostly of archipelagos. This suggests that it might have been able to swim short distances. Eustreptospondylus has been considered a good swimmer, strong enough to swim from island to island like the modern day Komodo dragon. Not all palaeontologists agree with the swimming hypothesis. The opposing theories hold that the fossil of Eustreptospondylus was either swept out to sea during a flood after the animal died on the mainland, or it was carried to the ocean after it died in a river. =Insular dwarfism= Eustreptospondylus has been portrayed as a genus that suffered from insular dwarfism. In 2000, David Martill and Darren Naish pointed out that the portrayal of the animal as an island-dwelling dwarf species was caused by not realizing that the holotype specimen represented a subadult.

Live to Be 100) is the fifth studio album by Yugoslav rock band Bijelo Dugme, released in 1980. The album marked the band's shift from their folk-influenced hard rock sound towards new wave. It is the band's second and the last studio album to feature Zoran \\"ƒêiƒëi\\" Jankeliƒá on drums. Do≈æivjeti stotu was polled in 1998 as the 35th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best Albums of Yugoslav Pop and Rock Music). Background During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Yugoslav rock scene saw the emergence of a number of new wave and punk bands. Noting this trend in popular music in the country, Bijelo Dugme leader Goran Bregoviƒá reportedly became fascinated with the developing scene based around the emerging bands, especially with the works of Azra and Prljavo Kazali≈°te. During 1980, the band decided to move towards new sound. In December 1980, Bijelo Dugme released new wave-influenced album Do≈æivjeti stotu. Do≈æivjeti stotu was the first Bijelo Dugme album produced by the band's guitarist and leader Goran Bregoviƒá. Unlike the songs from the band's previous albums, which were prepared long before album recording, most of the songs from Do≈æivjeti stotu were created during the recording sessions. As the recordings had to be finished before the scheduled mastering in London, Bregoviƒá reportedly resorted to using cocaine in order to stay awake, writing the lyrics in the nick of time. The saxophone on the recording was played by jazz saxophonist Jovan Maljokoviƒá and avant- garde musician Paul Pignon; Bregoviƒá stated that they originally invited Stjepko Gut to play brass sections, but that he turned them down. From the songs on the album, only \\"Pristao sam biƒáu sve ≈°to hoƒáe\\" and \\"Pjesma mom mlaƒëem bratu\\" resembled Bijelo Dugme's old sound. The songs \\"Ha ha ha\\" and \\"Tramvaj kreƒáe (ili kako biti heroj u ova ≈°ugava vremena)\\" were the first Bijelo Dugme songs to feature political-related lyrics. In accordance with their shift towards new wave, the band changed their hard rock style: the members cut their hair short, and the frontman ≈Ωeljko Bebek shaved his trademark moustache. Album cover The provocative cover, which appeared in three different versions, was designed by Mirko Iliƒá, artist closely associated with the Yugoslav new wave scene.

Due to the radically new sound, the album was met with a lot of skepticism. However, bandleader Bregoviƒá stated as the group prepared to start a tour: Most of the critics, however, praised the album. In the album review published in Duga magazine, Petar Lukoviƒá wrote: At the end of 1980, the readers of D≈æuboks magazine polled Bijelo Dugme the Band of the Year, ≈Ωeljko Bebek the Singer of the Year, the band's keyboardist Vlado Pravdiƒá the Keyboardist of the Year, ƒêiƒëi Jankeliƒá the Drummer of the Year, the band's bass guitarist Zoran Red≈æiƒá the Bass Guitarist of the Year, Goran Bregoviƒá the Composer, the Lyricist, the Producer and the Arranger of the Year, Do≈æivjeti stotu the Album of the Year, and Do≈æivjeti stotu cover the Album Cover of the Year.

Some members of this family include Megalosaurus, Torvosaurus, Eustreptospondylus, and Afrovenator. Appearing in the Middle Jurassic, megalosaurids were among the first major radiation of large theropod dinosaurs, although they became extinct by the end of the Jurassic period. They were a relatively primitive group of basal tetanurans containing two main subfamilies, Megalosaurinae and Afrovenatorinae, along with the basal genus Eustreptospondylus, an unresolved taxon which differs from both subfamilies. The defining megalosaurid is Megalosaurus bucklandii, first named and described in 1824 by William Buckland after multiple finds in Stonesfield, Oxfordshire, UK. Megalosaurus was the first formally described dinosaur and was the basis for the establishment of the clade Dinosauria. It is also one of the largest known Middle Jurassic carnivorous dinosaurs, with the best- preserved femur at 805 mm and a proposed body mass of around 943 kg. Megalosauridae is recognized as a mainly European group of dinosaurs, based on fossils found in France and the UK. However, recent discoveries in Niger have led some to consider the range of the family. Megalosaurids appeared right before the split of the supercontinent Pangaea into Gondwana and Laurasia. These large theropods therefore may have dominated both halves of the world during the Jurassic. The family Megalosauridae was first defined by Thomas Huxley in 1869, yet it has been contested throughout history due to its role as a \\"waste-basket\\" for many partially described dinosaurs or unidentified remains. In the early years of paleontology, most large theropods were grouped together and up to 48 species were included in the clade Megalosauria, the basal clade of Megalosauridae. Over time, most of these taxa were placed in other clades and the parameters of Megalosauridae were narrowed significantly. However, some controversy remains over whether Megalosauridae should be considered its own distinct group, and dinosaurs in this family remain some of the most problematic taxa in all Dinosauria. Some paleontologists, such as Paul Sereno in 2005, have disregarded the group due to its shaky foundation and lack of clarified phylogeny. However, recent research by Carrano, Benson, and Sampson has systematically analyzed all basal tetanurans and determined that Megalosauridae should exist as its own family. Description =Body size= Scale comparison of 3 Afrovenatorines Like other tetanurans, megalosaurids are carnivorous theropods characterized by large size and bipedalism. Specifically, megalosaurids exhibit especially giant size, with some members of the family weighing more than one tonne. Over time, there is evidence of size increase within the family. Basal megalosaurids from the Early Jurassic had smaller body size than those appearing in the late Middle Jurassic. Due to this size increase over time, Megalosauridae appear to follow a size increase pattern similar to that of other giant sized theropods like Spinosauridae. This pattern follows Cope's Rule, the postulation by paleontologist Edward Cope about evolutionary increase in body size. =Anatomical characteristics= Megalosaurid skulls. Clockwise from top left: Dubreuillosaurus, Torvosaurus, Afrovenator, Megalosaurus, Eustreptospondylus One unambiguous synapomorphy of Megalosauridae is a lower and longer skull with a length to height ratio of 3:1. In addition, the typical skull roof tends to be much less ornamented than that of other tetanurans, and crests or horns are either very small or absent entirely. Megalosaurids also have femoral heads with an orientation 45 degrees between anteromedial and fully medial. Megalosauridae are also defined by the following unique unambiguous synapomorphies: * A humeral deltopectoral crest that terminates about halfway along the humeral shaft * The absence of a fibular anterolateral tubercle. * Nares which extend as far as the premaxillary teeth, yet the portion of the premaxilla anterior to the nares being longer than the portion under them; angled snout tip (angle between the anterior and alveolar margins <70 degrees). * Medial foramina on the quadrate adjacent to the mandibular condyles. * Pleurocoelous fossae on the sacral vertebrae. * The oblique ligament groove on the posterior surface of the femoral head is shallow. Megalosaurinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to Megalosaurus than Afrovenator) are characterized by a moderate (0.5-2.0) height/length ratio of the premaxilla below the level of the nares, compared to other megalosaurids which have a lower ratio and thus less tall snout tip. Afrovenatorinae (all megalosaurids more closely related to Afrovenator than Megalosaurus) are characterized by a squared anterior margin of the antorbital fossa and the puboischiadic plate being broadly open along the midline. =Dental morphology= Tooth from Megalosaurus Dental findings are frequently used to differentiate between various theropods and to further inform cladistic phylogeny. Tooth morphology and dental evolutionary markers are prone to homoplasy and disappear or reappear throughout history. However, megalosaurids have several specific denture conditions that differentiate them from other basal theropods. One dental condition present in Megalosauridae is multiple enamel wrinkles near the carinae, the sharp edge or serration row of the tooth. Ornamented teeth and a well-marked enamel surface also characterize basal megalosaurids. The ornamentation and well-marked surface appears in early megalosaurids but disappears in derived megalosaurids, suggesting that the condition was lost over time as megalosaurids grew in size. Classification = Historical classification = Megalosaurus femur From the family's inception, many specimens found in the field have been wrongly classified as megalosaurids. For example, most large carnivores found for about a century after the naming of Megalosaurus bucklandii were placed in Megalosauridae. Megalosaurus was the first paleontological finding of its kind when William Buckland discovered a giant femur and named it in 1824, predating even the term Dinosauria. When initially defined, the species M. bucklandii was anatomically based on various dissociated bones found in quarries around the village of Stonesfield, UK. Some of these early findings included a right dentary with a well-preserved tooth, ribs, pelvic bones, and sacral vertebrae. As early paleontologists and researchers found more dinosaur bones in the surrounding area, they attributed them all to M. bucklandii since it was the only named and described dinosaur at this point in history. Therefore, the species was initially described and classified by a mass of possibly unrelated characteristics. Modern paleontology first began to approach the problematic cladistic separation of Megalosauridae during the early 20th century. Fredrich von Huene separated carnivorous theropods, which had all been grouped into the broad category of megalosaurids, into two distinct families of larger, more giant sized and smaller, more lightly built theropods. These two groups were named Coelurosauria and Pachypodosauria respectively. Later on, Huene distinguished between carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs in Pachypodosauria, placing the meat-eaters in a new group Carnosauria. As more information was uncovered about basal theropods and phylogenetic characteristics, modern paleontologists began to question the proper naming for this group. In 2005 paleontologist Paul Sereno rejected the use of the clade Megalosauridae due to its ambiguous early history in favor of the name Torvosauridae. Today, it is accepted that megalosaurids existed at least as a group of basal tetanurans, due to the fact that they have more derived taxa than ceratosaurs and that the name Megalosauridae should represent this group. Megalosauridae also has priority over Torvosauridae under ICZN rules governing family names. =Phylogeny= A reconstruction of 233x233px Megalosauridae was first phylogenetically defined in 1869 by Thomas Huxley, yet was used as a ‚Äòwaste-basket‚Äô clade for many years. In 2002, Ronan Allain redefined the clade after he discovered a complete megalosaurid skull in northwestern France of species Poekilopleuron. Using the characters described in this study, Allain defined Megalosauridae as dinosaurs including Poekilopleuron valesdunesis, now known as Dubreuillosaurus, Torvosaurus, Afrovenator, and all descendants of their common ancestor. Allain also defined two taxa within Megalosauridae: Torvosaurinae was defined as all Megalosauridae more closely related to Torvosaurus than to Poekilopleuron and Afrovenator, and Megalosaurinae was defined as all those that are more closely related to Poekilopleuron. Megalosauridae also falls under the basal clade Megalosauroidea, which also contains Spinosauridae. However, many taxa are still quite unstable and cannot be placed in one clade with absolute certainty. For example, Eustreptospondylus and Streptospondylus, while they are both defined as Megalosauridae, are often excluded to make more stable cladograms since they are not defined to a certain subgroup. The cladogram presented here follows Benson (2010) and Benson et al. (2010). Supporting Information Wiehenvenator, a typical megalosaurine Then, in 2012, Carrano, Benson, and Sampson did a much larger analysis of tetanurans and defined Megalosauria more broadly as the clade containing Megalosaurus, Spinosaurus, and all its descendants. In other words, Megalosauria is the group that contains the two families Megalosauridae and its close relative Spinosauridae. Within this new cladogram, Megalosauridae was given a new subfamily Afrovenatorinae, which included all megalosaurids more closely related to Afrovenator than Megalosaurus. Carrano, Benson, and Sampson also included various megalosaurids that had previously been excluded from cladograms in their 2012 study, such as Duriavenator and Wiehenvenator in Megalosaurinae and Magnosaurus, Leshansaurus, and Piveteausaurus in Afrovenatorinae. Scuirumimus albersodoerferi, a small theropod described in 2012 which preserved protofeathers, was initially believed to be a juvenile megalosauroid. This led to the belief that megalosaurids may have had feathers. However, subsequent analyses have placed Sciurimimus as a basal coelurosaur. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. This would render Megalosauridae a family of carnosaurs. Palaeoecology Megalosaurid trackways from Vale de Meios Megalosaurids have been suggested to be predators or scavengers inhabiting coastal environments. Middle Jurassic-era tracks believed to have left by megalosaurids have been found at Vale de Meios in Portugal. During the middle Jurassic, this site would have been a tidal flat exposed at low tide on the edge of a lagoon. Unlike most coastal tracks, which are parallel to the coastline and probably left by migrating animals, the Vale de Meios tracks were perpendicular to the coast, with the vast majority oriented towards the lagoon. This indicates that the megalosaurids which would have left these tracks approached the tidal flat once the tide retreated. This indicates that megalosaurids could have scavenged for the carcasses of marine creatures left by the receding tides. Another possibility is that megalosaurids were piscivorous, approaching the coast to hunt for fish. Spinosaurids, which were close relatives of megalosaurids, had numerous adaptations for piscivory and semiaquatic life, so such a lifestyle is supported by phylogenetic data. Shark teeth, cartilage fragments, and gastroliths have been documented as stomach contents in Poekilopleuron. Both this genus and Dubreillosaurus were discovered in sediments also preserving mangrove roots, providing further evidence for a coastal habitat. Nevertheless, this does not rule out the possibility that megalosaurids also fed on terrestrial prey. =Palaeogeography= Pangea before the split into Gondwana and Laurasia Species included in Megalosauridae have been found on every modern continent, split relatively equally between sites on the Gondwana and Laurasia supercontinents. Paleogeography findings show that Megalosauridae was mainly restricted to the Middle to Late Jurassic, suggesting they went extinct at the Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary 145 million years ago. The global radiation of these carnivorous theropods occurred in two steps. First, radiation occurred during Pangaea's breakup during the Early Jurassic, about 200 million years ago. When the Tethys Sea emerged between the supercontinent, megalosauroids radiated to the two halves of Pangaea. The second step of radiation occurred during the Middle and Late Jurassic, 174 to 145 million years ago, in allosauroids and coelurosaurs. Megalosauridae appears to have gone extinct at the end of this time period. Megalosaurid remains have been found in various areas of the world throughout history. For example, Megalosauridae contains the most primitive theropod embryo ever found, from Early Tithonian Portugal 152 million years ago (mya). In addition, various megalosaurid fossil discoveries have been dated to Bajocian-Callovian England and France 168 to 163 mya, Middle Jurassic Africa about 170 mya, Late Jurassic China 163 to 145 mya, and Tithonian North America about 150 mya. Most recently, megalosaurids have been found in the Tiourar√©n Formation in Niger, proving again that these basal tetanurans have experienced global radiation.

Yellow Tail as well as Casella Family Brands as a whole are both based in Yenda, New South Wales. History In 1957 the Casella family, headed by Filippo Casella and his wife Maria, emigrated from Sicily to Australia for a better life. Yellow Tail was developed for the Casella family winery to enter into the bottled wine market‚Äîhaving previously supplied bulk wine to other wineries. Yellow Tail was developed in 2000 and was originally marketed to export countries. It became the number one imported wine to the United States by 2011. The namesake of the brand, Yellow Tail, is the yellow- footed rock wallaby (Petrogale xanthopus), a relative of kangaroos.  Vineyard  The vineyard produces approximately three percent of all wine and is around , located in the Riverina, Griffith, New South Wales, Australia. Wines Approximately a third of the grapes that are harvested by Yellow Tail are from their vineyard in Riverina, Australia. The rest are from other vineyards in South Eastern Australia. All Yellow Tail wines have their own specific label color. In addition to sparkling wines, Yellow Tail makes varietal wine from the following grape varieties: Moscato, Riesling, Semillon, Sauvignon blanc, Pinot gris, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Merlot, Grenache, Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon in addition to some blended wine and Ros√©. Each wine has different colours, for example Merlot is Orange, Shiraz is yellow, etc.  International sales  In 2000, the Casellas joined with W.J. Deutsch & Sons, a family-owned marketing and distribution firm, in order to distribute Yellow Tail wines in the United States. In 2001, it sold 200,000 cases, a number that jumped to 2.2 million the next year. Yellow Tail has enjoyed similar success in the UK which, in 2000, began importing more wine from Australia than from France for the first time in history. In 2005, Yellow Tail sold more wine in the US than all the French producers combined.http://wineeconomist.com/2008/02/26/the-yellow-tail-tale/ See also * Australian wine * Globalization of wine  References  * Bieler, Kristen Wolf, Wisconsin Beverage Guide (March, 2006). \\"Behind the [Yellow Tail phenomenon: How it happened and what's next?\\"] * Kim, Chan W.; Mauborgne, Renee, Harvard Business School Press (2005). \\"Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make the Competition Irrelevant\\", Boston Massachusetts, 28, 189, pp. 31‚Äì32  External links  * Australian brands Australian wine Wine brands Riverina ","title":"Yellow Tail (wine)"},{"id":"3534943","text":"David Worth Bagley (January 8, 1883 ‚Äì May 24, 1960) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War II. He was also the brother of Ensign Worth Bagley, the only United States Navy officer killed in action during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and the father of Admirals David H. Bagley and Worth H. Bagley. Early life and career Born in Raleigh, North Carolina, Bagley was the son of Major William Henry Bagley and Adelaide Ann Worth. Bagley attended North Carolina State College in 1898 and 1899 before entering the United States Naval Academy in 1900. After graduating on February 4, 1904, he went to sea in attached to the North Atlantic Fleet. In December 1905, Passed Midshipman Bagley was reassigned to the Asiatic Fleet and served successively in Concord (Gunboat No. 3) and . While in Concord, he was commissioned ensign on February 2, 1906. He was detached from West Virginia in March 1907 and, the following year, reported on board of the Atlantic Fleet and made the voyage around the world in her with the Great White Fleet. In April 1909, he left Rhode Island and went to the General Electric Co. in Schenectady, New York, for a year of instruction. He then became aide and flag lieutenant to the Commander, 2nd Division, Atlantic Fleet, in April 1910. After a similar tour of duty on the staff of the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, and a two-month furlough, Bagley reported for duty at the Naval Academy in September 1912. Two years later, Bagley returned to sea as first lieutenant in serving with the Atlantic Fleet. He got his first command in September 1915 when he took over . World War I During the first month of 1917, Bagley moved from Drayton to . By May 1917, he and his ship were conducting antisubmarine patrols and convoy escort missions in the western approaches to the British Isles. Later, his area of operations widened to include the Irish Sea and the English Channel. On December 6, 1917, Bagley conned his ship out of Brest harbor. At about 1621 that afternoon, the watch spied a torpedo wake. The destroyer maneuvered to avoid the torpedo, but in vain. It struck the ship's starboard side and pierced the fuel oil tank. Though Bagley and his crew worked frantically to save the ship, it went down within eight minutes carrying 64 crewmen with it. Bagley and 37 others made it into the icy water in boats and on rafts, and, thanks to the humanitarian gesture by Kapit√§nleutnant Hans Rose, the U-boat commander who radioed their location to Queenstown, they were all picked up by the 8th. Bagley earned the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his part in handling the situation. Bagley returned to the United States after the sinking of Jacob Jones and became the prospective commanding officer of then under construction at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. He put her into commission on October 2, 1918, but commanded her only until January 1919 when he became the American port officer at Rotterdam in the Netherlands with additional duty as the assistant naval attach√© in the American legation at The Hague. Interwar years USS McCall at Mare Island Navy Yard in June 1938. Captain James L. Kauffman, Captain of the Yard (left) with Bagley (center), Commandant of the Yard and Lieutenant Commander John Whelchel, commanding officer of McCall. Bagley later served as naval attach√© before returning to the United States in December 1921 for a tour of duty ashore in the Office of Naval Intelligence. In March 1922, Bagley returned to sea in command of and as Commander, Destroyer Division 32, Pacific Fleet. He transferred to command of Division 35, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet, in August 1923. Bagley went ashore again in May 1924 for another two‚Äëyear tour of duty at the Naval Academy. At the end of the academic year in 1926, he left the academy to become chief of staff to the Commander, Naval Forces, Europe, embarked in . In April 1927, Bagley moved to the 9th Naval District as the assistant (later changed to chief of staff) to the commandant with temporary additional duty as acting commanding officer of the Naval Training Station, Great Lakes. Bagley returned to sea in December 1931 as the commanding officer of heavy cruiser , then serving in the Atlantic with Cruiser Division 4, Scouting Fleet. That assignment lasted until May 1933 when Bagley was called to Washington, D.C., for duty in the Bureau of Navigation. He later became assistant bureau chief.

He was the most prominent member of the Hrvatiniƒá noble family, and one of the major feudal lords in Kingdom of Bosnia. He was Grand Duke of Bosnia under three Bosnian kings: King Tvrtko I, King Stephen Dabi≈°a and King Stephen Ostoja. In 1403 he was named regent for Hungary, Croatia and Dalmatia, and was made Duke of Split. He played a crucial role in the dinastic struggles between the Anjou and Luxembourg claimants to the Hungarian-Croatian throne at the end of the 14th century, as well as in the emergence of the Bosnian Kingdom as a regional power during the same period.  Family Connections  Hrvoje was the eldest son of Duke Vukac Hrvatiniƒá. He had three brothers: Vuk (who was Ban of Croatia), Dragi≈°a and Vojislav. He was married to Jelena Nelipƒçiƒá,Sveuƒçili≈°te u Zagrebu. Institut za hrvatsku povijest; Radovi, 1987 granddaughter of the powerful Croatian noble Ivan I Nelipac (Prince Nelipiƒá) and sister of Ivan III Nelipac (Ivani≈° Nelipiƒá). He is first mentioned in 1376 as being prince and knight during the reign of Hungarian king Louis I. The territories over which he reigned were the Donji Kraji () in Medieval Bosnia, facing Croatia and Slavonia westwards.  Rise of Vukƒçiƒá's power  Realm of Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá in the early 15th century In the year 1380 he was made Grand Duke of Bosnia by Bosnian King Stjepan (Stephen) Tvrtko I of House of Kotromaniƒá, granting him a seat in La≈°va. In 1387 Hrvoje's first action as Grand Duke was leading a squadron of Bosnian troops to Croatia to raise the siege of Bishop Ivan Horvat in Zagreb. After the death of king Louis I he participated in the battles of succession between Sigismund of Luxembourg and Ladislaus of Naples. He sided with Ladislaus with the promise of becoming ban of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1391. During the reign of King Stephen Dabi≈°a of Bosnia, he participated in the fights against the Ottoman Turks in Bosnia in 1392 - earning Dabi≈°a's eternal gratitude. Hrvoje became Dabi≈°a's main guarantee of staying at the throne - as he declared that he is a faithful servant of the Hungarian King in all cases but those that might damage King Dabi≈°a in 1393. In the heat of internal struggles in Bosnia in 1397 during the reign of Queen Jelena Gruba Hrvoje invited the Ottomans to offer assistance. As an opposer of Queen Jelena, he participated in the selection of Stephen Ostoja as the new King of Bosnia in May 1398. Opposing King Sigismund's Hungarian pretensions, Hrvoje greatly influenced King Ostoja. Jajce fortress, seat of Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá, southwest entrance with the Kingdom of Bosnia coat of arms Duke Hrvoje opposed King Sigismund's rule in Bosnia and actively worked to bring Ladislaus of Naples as the new King of Hungary - that would leave Bosnia alone since 1389, and the same year King Sigismund invaded Bosnia. Duke Hrvoje defeated his forces before they reached the City of Vrbas and chased them across the river Una, invading and conquering the ≈æupa of Dubica. King Sigismund counterattacked in the fall by assaulting Bosnia. Here, Duke Hrvoje led the forces for King Stephen Ostoja, together with Duke Sandalj Hraniƒá and Duke Pavle Radenoviƒá. By the end of 1402, Duke Hrvoje made all Dalmatian cities with the exception of Dubrovnik to recognize King Ladislaus' rule. After the crowning of Ladislaus as the Hungarian King in Zadar in 1403, and in political maneuvering against his arch political rival and enemy, the King Sigismund, he made Hrvoje his deputy for Dalmatia territory, as promised, calling him his Vicar General for the regions of Sclavonia (in partibus Sclavonie). He was also named Duke of Split, and given possessions on the islands of Braƒç, Hvar and Korƒçula. From then on he carried the title of \\"Grand Duke of Bosnia and Knyaz of Donji Kraji, Duke of Split, regent of Dalmatia and Croatia\\", or as title visible on coins duke was able to mint in Split read in . In 1406 Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá Hrvatiniƒá fortified and strengthen Prozor Fortress over the Vrlika valley in Croatia, also given to him by Ladislaus of Naples. He continually exerted his influence over Bosnia affairs. He came into conflict with King Ostoja and participated in the plot to remove him from the throne and replacing him with Tvrtko II Kotromaniƒá in 1404. Together with Tvrtko II he formed a movement against Hungary and Sigismund of Luxembourg. After Sigismund's military intervention in 1408 and the massacre of the Bosnian army, he allied himself with Sigismund. However, Hungary's victory in Bosnia and the retaking of the throne by King Ostoja weakened him severely. He soon lost control over the islands he had been given, as well as Split. At this point, he sought help from the Ottoman Empire. The Hungarian army was defeated at La≈°va in 1415, but this would open the door to Ottoman expansion into Bosnia. Hrvoje died the following year and his widow, Jelena Nelipƒçiƒá, married King Ostoja. Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá's dukal coat of arms as depicted in Hrvoje's Misal manuscript.

Broadcasting under the branding of 55KRC, the station airs a talk radio format. The studios are on Montgomery Road in Cincinnati, and the transmitter is in Cold Spring, Kentucky. WKRC operates at 5,000 watts by day and 1,000 watts at night. WKRC is co-owned with another Cincinnati iHeartMedia talk station, 700 WLW. While WLW airs mostly local talk and sports programming, WKRC largely carries nationally syndicated talk shows. WKRC is the former sister station to Channel 12 WKRC-TV in Cincinnati, both having been owned by Taft Broadcasting and later Clear Channel Communications (now known as iHeartMedia), until the television station was sold to Newport Television, LLC. Despite the similarities in their call letters, WKRC was not the inspiration behind the television show WKRP in Cincinnati. The show's creator, Hugh Wilson, wrote the premise based on his experiences at WQXI in Atlanta. The similarity of the two sets of call letters was used as a joke on the program. History WKRC is one of the oldest radio stations in Ohio. It was first licensed in May 1924 to the Ainsworth-Gates Radio Co. of Cincinnati, and was issued the sequentially assigned call letters WFBW.\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 2, 1924, page 3. The station changed its call sign to WMH beginning on June 14, 1924.\\"WFBW is Now WMH\\", Cincinnati Post, June 11, 1924, page 6. (An earlier WMH, which was Cincinnati's first broadcasting station, had been operated by the Precision Equipment Company until January 1923.) In 1925, the station was purchased by the Kodel Radio Corporation.\\"Kodel Buys Station WMH\\", Radio World, April 4, 1925, page 9. Kodel changed the call letters to WKRC to match its initials.\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1925, page 11. WKRC was a charter member of the CBS Radio Network, and was one of the 16 stations that aired the first CBS network program on September 18, 1927. CBS purchased WKRC in November 1931, turning it into an owned and operated station. CBS sold it to The Cincinnati Times-Star in September 1939. The Times-Star was owned by the Taft Family, and this purchase was the genesis of Taft Broadcasting, with WKRC as its flagship station.\\"Times-Star buys WKRC, Cincinnati\\", Broadcasting, September 1, 1939, pg. 34.\\"WKRC's transfer approved by FCC\\", Broadcasting, December 1, 1939, pg. 36. In 1947, Taft signed on an FM station at 101.9 MHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1948 page 310 The FM station used its own call sign at first, WCTS, which stood for Cincinnati Times-Star. It later switched to WKRC-FM and today is WKRQ. In 1949, Taft Broadcasting added Cincinnati's second television station, Channel 11 WKRC-TV (now on Channel 12).Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 235 As network programming moved from radio to television in the 1950s, WKRC switched to a full service middle of the road (MOR) music format and was an affiliate of the ABC Entertainment Radio Network.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-160 In the 1980s, the music moved from MOR to adult contemporary. On November 29, 1992, after Jacor acquired the station via a local marketing agreement (LMA), WKRC began stunting with a computerized countdown.\\"WKRC in Flux\\", Radio & Records, December 4, 1992, page 16.

In 1994, the station assumed the WCKY and some programming used on WCKY (1530 AM), itself renamed WSAI (1530 AM). In 1997 the station's call letters returned to WKRC, offering a schedule of local and national talk programs, some of them from Westwood One. In 1999, Clear Channel Communications, the forerunner of current owner iHeartMedia, acquired Jacor Broadcasting, including WKRC.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page 414 Programming WKRC personality Brian Thomas hosts the station's locally- based morning drive program.

The album features R&B; and soul singer Goapele. It was released on November 8, 2005 on Rumble Pack Records. Much like their previous work together, Nuntype is a conceptualized album crafting original music, visual artwork, story telling lyrics and a multimedia extension (in this case, the Nuntype website) to help create a world for the listeners to indulge in. Story Tajai is a deity who wields the power of Creation. Swirling within the doldrums of his ponderous age, the deity has become bored and seeks to satiate his loneliness by mindlessly toying with the fates of his human \\"playthings.\\" But after many millennia of evolution, the humans have become advanced lifeforms, and they have progressed so mightily in their civilized, organically-technologized culture. As a Prophecy is foretold by the stars and comes to pass, Chaos ensues, threatening the very grip the deity needs to maintain control of a universe that has outgrown him. History The pre-production of Nuntype began almost immediately after the completion and publication of Projecto in 1999. On his website, SupremeEx mentioned after completing the sci-fi-heavy Projecto, the duo wanted to go in the polar opposite direction, instead focusing on magic, chaos and prophecy to convey their next chapter. The name \\"Nuntype\\" was originally coined as \\"Nu_type\\"; a name Tajai and SupremeEx tentatively referred to their new album to amongst themselves (\\"New type\\"). However, in researching the history of prophecies, SupremeEx came across the name of the Egyptian god of Chaos, Nun. Ironically, the hieroglyph for Nun closely resembles the iconic insignia of the Hieroglyphics hiphop band whom Tajai is a member of. The coincidence was enough for Tajai and SupremeEx to officially coin their album's title, \\"Nuntype\\" in reference to the Egyptian god. Instrumental album An instrumental version of the album with extended versions and unreleased tracks was exclusively released online in November 2006. Initially seeded by SupremeEx himself as a \\"test\\" over BitTorrent networks, the album was then officially released on music download services such as iTunes, Napster and eMusic.

Early life and career Taylor was born in Miami and lived in South Florida with her parents and two older sisters. Taylor‚Äôs foray into the modeling world was largely due to being supermodel Niki Taylor's younger sister. At age 11, Taylor began going to shoots with Niki, and photographers began to include her in photos. Her first shoot with sister Niki appeared in Seventeen. She soon signed with her sister‚Äôs modeling agency in New York, IMG. At age 13, after accompanying Niki to castings for the Fall Shows in Milan, the designers impulsively fitted Taylor, and she walked the runways alongside Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, and Claudia Schiffer. Thereafter, Taylor began getting calls to work solo. Taylor had amassed an impressive r√©sum√© of credits, including ELLE, Italian Glamour, YM, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue. She had 13 covers to her credit, and appeared on Entertainment Tonight and MTV. She also did the 1994 Spring Collections in New York, landing eight shows, including Ralph Lauren. Her last photo shoot was with sister Niki Taylor for the July/August 1995 cover of Ocean Drive magazine. Death On July 2, 1995, Niki Taylor found Krissy lying unconscious on the floor of their family's home in Florida. After attempts to revive Taylor by her family and authorities failed, she was rushed to Memorial Hospital West and pronounced dead at 5:39 a.m. She was 17 years old. Taylor was known to have had allergies that congested her upper respiratory system. The official cause of death was an acute asthma attack complicated by sudden cardiac arrhythmia. However, she had no prior history of asthma, and no symptoms of a heart condition. Uncertain of the medical examiner's diagnosis, the Taylor family hired independent experts to study tissue samples of Taylor's heart muscle, and concluded that the more likely cause of her death was a rare cardiac disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Taylor‚Äôs mother, Barbara, is now involved with the Cardiac Arrythmias Research and Education (CARE) Foundation.

It was originally named as an African species of Brachiosaurus (B. brancai), but this has since been changed. Giraffatitan was for many decades known as the largest dinosaur but recent discoveries of several larger dinosaurs prove otherwise; giant titanosaurians appear to have surpassed Giraffatitan in terms of sheer mass. Also, the sauropod dinosaur Sauroposeidon is estimated to be taller and possibly heavier than Giraffatitan. All size estimates for Giraffatitan are based on the specimen HMN SII, a subadult individual between 21.8‚Äì22.5 metres (72‚Äì74 ft) in length and about 12 meters (39 ft) tall. Mass estimates are varied and range from as little as 15 tonnes (17 short tons) to as much as 78.3 tonnes (86.3 short tons) but there is evidence supporting that these animals could grow larger; specimen HMN XV2, represented by a fibula 13% larger than the corresponding material on HMN SII, might have attained 26 metres (85 ft) in length or longer. Description =Size= Size comparison with a human being Between 1914 and the 1990s, Giraffatitan was claimed to be the largest dinosaur known, (ignoring the possibly larger but lost Maraapunisaurus) and thus the largest land animal in history. In the later part of the twentieth century, several giant titanosaurians found appear to surpass Giraffatitan in terms of sheer mass. However, Giraffatitan and Brachiosaurus are still the largest brachiosaurid sauropods known from relatively complete material. All size estimates for Giraffatitan are based on the skeleton mounted in Berlin, which is partly constructed from authentic bones. These were largely taken from specimen HMN SII, a subadult individual between in length and about twelve meters (forty feet) tall. The often mentioned length of 22.46 metres is by Werner Janensch, the German scientist who described Giraffatitan, and was the result of a simple adding error: the correct number should have been 22.16 metres. Mass estimates are more problematic and historically have strongly varied from as little as to as much as . These extreme estimates are now considered unlikely due to flawed methodologies. There are also a large number of such estimations as the skeleton proved to be an irresistible subject for researchers wanting to test their new measuring methods. The first calculations were again made by Janensch. In 1935, he gave a volume of 32 m¬≥ for specimen SII and of 25 m¬≥ for specimen SI, a smaller individual. It is not known how he arrived at these numbers. In 1950, he mentioned a weight of forty tonnes for the larger skeleton. In 1962, Edwin Harris Colbert measured a volume of 86.953 m¬≥. Presuming a density of 0.9, this resulted in a weight of 78,258 kilogrammes. Colbert had inserted a museum model, sold to the public, into sand and observed the volume displaced by it. Gregory S. Paul in 1988 assumed that the, in his opinion, unrealistically high number had been caused by the fact that such models used to be very bloated compared to the real build of the animal. In 1980, Dale Alan Russell e.a. published a much lower weight of 14.8 tonnes by extrapolating from the diameter of the humerus and the thighbone. In 1985, the same researcher arrived at 29 tonnes by extrapolating from the circumference of these bones. In 1985, Robert McNeill Alexander found a value of 46.6 tonnes inserting a toy model of the British Museum of Natural History into water. More recent estimates based on models reconstructed from bone volume measurements, which take into account the extensive, weight-reducing airsac systems present in sauropods, and estimated muscle mass, are in the range of . In 1988, G.S. Paul measured a volume of 36.585 m¬≥ by inserting a specially constructed model into water. He estimated a weight of 31.5 tonnes, assuming a low density. In 1994/1995, Jan Peczkis calculated a weight of 40 tonnes extrapolating from limb bone circumference. In 1995, Hans-Christian Gunga e.a. used a laser scan of the skeleton to build a virtual model from simple geometrical shapes, finding a volume of 74.42 m¬≥ and concluding to a weight of 63 tonnes. In 2008, Gunga revised the volume, using more complex shapes, to 47.9 m¬≥. Donald Henderson in 2004 employed a computer model that calculated a volume of 32.398 m¬≥ and a weight of 25,789 kilogrammes. Newer methods use bone wall thickness. However, HMN SII is not the largest specimen known (an assertion supported by its subadult status) but HMN XV2, represented by a fibula 13% larger than the corresponding material on HMN SII, which might have attained in length.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2008) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages Supplementary Information In 2020 Molina-Perez and Larramnedi estimated the size of the HMN XV2 specimen at 25 meters (82 ft) and 48 tonnes (53 short tons),with a shoulder height of 6.8 meters (22 ft). =General build= Restoration Giraffatitan was a sauropod, one of a group of four-legged, plant- eating dinosaurs with long necks and tails and relatively small brains. It had a giraffe-like build, with long forelimbs and a very long neck. The skull had a tall arch anterior to the eyes, consisting of the bony nares, a number of other openings, and \\"spatulate\\" teeth (resembling chisels). The first toe on its front foot and the first three toes on its hind feet were clawed. =Nostrils= Skull cast in Berlin Traditionally, the distinctive high- crested skull was seen as a characteristic of the genus Brachiosaurus, to which Giraffatitan brancai was originally referred; however, it is possible that Brachiosaurus altithorax did not show this feature, since within the traditional Brachiosaurus material it is known only from Tanzanian specimens now assigned to Giraffatitan. The placement of Giraffatitan nostrils has been the source of much debate with Witmer (2001) describing in Science the hypothesized position of the fleshy nostrils in Giraffatitan in as many as five possible locations. Comparing the nares of dinosaurs with those of modern animals, he found that all species have their external nostril openings in the front, and that sauropods like Giraffatitan did not have nostrils on top of their heads, but near their snouts. There has also been the hypothesis of various sauropods, such as Giraffatitan, possessing a trunk. The fact that there were no narrow-snouted sauropods (Giraffatitan included) tends to discredit such a hypothesis. Stronger evidence for the absence of a trunk is found in the teeth wear of Giraffatitan, which shows the kind of wear that would result from biting and tearing off of plant matter rather than purely grinding, which would be the result of having already ripped the leaves and branches off with a trunk. History of discovery A hindlimb during excavation in the Tendaguru In 1906, mining engineer Bernhard Wilhelm Sattler, while travelling, noticed an enormous bone jutting out of the ground at the Tendaguru (the \\"steep hill\\") near Lindi, in what was then German East Africa, today Tanzania. In early 1907, his superior Wilhelm Arning in Hannover received a report on the find. Arning again informed the Kommission f√ºr die landeskundliche Erforschung der Schutzgebiete, a commission in Berlin overviewing the geographical investigation of German protectorates.Maier (2003), p 1 The German secretary of state of colonies, Berhard Dernburg, at the time visited German East Africa accompanied by the industrialist Heinrich Otto. Otto had invited the paleontologist Professor Eberhard Fraas to join him as a scientific advisor.Maier (2003), p 3 In the summer of 1907, Fraas, already for some months travelling the colony, received a letter from Dr Hans Meyer in Leipzig urging him to investigate Sattler's discovery. On 30 August, Fraas arrived by steamer at the coastal town of Lindi.Maier (2003), p 8 A five-day march brought him to the Tendaguru, where he could confirm that the bones were authentic and dinosaurian.Maier (2003), p 10 Soon Sattler joined him with a team of native miners who uncovered two large sauropod skeletons which were transported to Germany.Maier (2003), p 11-12 Ultimately, these would become the holotypes of the genera Tornieria and Janenschia. Fraas had observed that the Tendaguru layers were exceptionally rich in fossils. After his return to Germany he tried to raise enough money for a major expedition. He managed to attract the interest of Professor Wilhelm von Branca, the head of the Geologisch-Pal√§ontologische Institut und Museum der K√∂nigliche Friedrich-Wilhelm Universit√§t zu Berlin.Maier (2003), p 15 Von Branca considered it a matter of German national pride that such a project would succeed.Maier (2003), p 16 He involved the well-connected pathologist David von Hansemann.Maier (2003), p 17 Von Hansemann founded a Tendaguru Committee headed by Johann Albrecht, the duke of Mecklenburg. Soon it became fashionable to join this committee which counted a large number of prominent German industrialists and scientists among its members. Many of their rich friends donated considerable sums.Maier (2003), p 18 To lead the expedition, von Branca sent out one of his curators, Werner Janensch,Maier (2003), p 19 and one of his assistants, Edwin Hennig.Maier (2003), p 22 Both men arrived in Dar es Salaam on 2 April 1909.Maier (2003), p 23 Porters carrying a large bone at the Tendaguru The expedition initially employed about 160 native porters as beasts of burden could not be used because of the danger posed by the tse tse fly. During four field seasons, of 1909, 1910, 1911 and 1912, about a hundred paleontological quarries were opened. Large amounts of fossil material were shipped to Germany. Soon it became evident that apart from Tornieria and Janenschia, other sauropods were present in the layers. One was the medium- sized Dicraeosaurus, a relatively common find. More rare was a gigantic form that far surpassed the others in magnitude and that is today known as Giraffatitan. The first quarry with Giraffatitan material was \\"Site D\\", located about one kilometre northeast of the Tendaguru Hill and opened on 21 June 1909. It contained a relatively complete skeleton of a medium-sized individual, lacking the hands, the neck, the back vertebrae and the skull. It included an articulated series of twenty-nine tail vertebrae. The other bones were found in close association on a surface of twenty-two square metres. \\"Site IX\\", located 1.4 kilometres northeast of the Tendaguru Hill, was opened on 17 August 1909. Among an assemblage of 150 disarticulated dinosaur bones, also two Giraffatitan thighbones were present. The next Giraffatitan quarry was \\"Site N\\", at nine hundred metres east of the Tendaguru Hill, excavated in September 1909. It held a single disarticulated skeleton containing a back vertebra, a tail vertebra, ribs, a scapula. a possible scapula, a humerus, two ischia and a number of unidentifiable bones. The most important source of Giraffatitan fossils would be \\"Site S\\" at one kilometre southwest of the hill. Excavations started on 11 October 1909 and continued well into 1912. In 1909 limb and girdle elements were dug up. During 1910, a cut bank of the Kitukituki river was gradually deepened, removing a high overburden. To prevent the quarry walls from collapsing, they were covered by a high wooden framework. That year, first several ribs were uncovered and later part of the vertebral column. In October, close to some neck vertebrae a skull and lower jaws were discovered. From 5 June 1912 onwards more neck and trunk vertebrae were found. Initially it was thought that a single skeleton was being uncovered. Only much later Janensch realised that two skeletons had been present. Skelett SI was represented by a skull, six neck vertebrae and some back vertebrae. Skelett SII was larger but despite its size still a subadult individual. It included skull bones, a series of eleven neck and eleven back vertebrae, ribs, the left scapula, both coracoids, both forelimbs, the pubic bones and the right hindlimb. The sacrum and the tail had been lost to relatively recent erosion. The animal was found in an upright position with vertical limbs, which has been explained by its becoming mired in mud. Native foreman Boheti bin Amrani preparing a large rib In early October 1909, \\"Site ab\\" was excavated, 1,2 kilometres northeast of the hill. Among disarticulated remains of many sauropods, also two Giraffatitan thighbones were collected. A gigantic possible humerus was too damaged to be salvaged. \\"Site cc\\", 2.9 kilometres northeast of the hill, contained a disarticulated Giraffatitan skeleton including neck vertebrae, a trunk vertebra, ribs, a scapula and a humerus. In 1910, another Giraffatitan quarry was opened, \\"Site Y\\" at 3.1 kilometres north of the Tendaguru Hill. It contained the skeleton of a medium- sized individual including a braincase, a series of eight neck vertebrae, a trunk vertebra, ribs, both scapulae, a coracoid, a left humerus and a left fibula. The quarries listed above represent only the most important sites where Giraffatitan bones were found. In dozens of other Tendaguru locations finds were made of large single sauropod bones that were referred to the taxon in Janensch' publications but of which no field notes survive so that the precise circumstances of the discoveries are unknown. Partly this reflects a lack of systematic documentation by the expedition. Many documents were destroyed by an allied bombardment in 1943. Part of the fossils were then lost also. Nevertheless, most of the skeleton is known. Mounted skeleton of Giraffatitan before it was remounted Giraffatitan brancai was first named and described by German paleontologist Werner Janensch in 1914 as Brachiosaurus brancai, based on several specimens recovered between 1909 and 1912 from the Tendaguru formation. It is known from five partial skeletons, including three skulls and numerous fragmentary remains including skull material, some limb bones, vertebrae and teeth. It lived from 145 to 150 million years ago, during the Kimmeridgian to Tithonian ages of the Late Jurassic period. A famous specimen of Giraffatitan brancai mounted in the Berlin's Natural History Museum is one of the largest, and in fact the tallest, mounted skeletons in the world, as certified by the Guinness Book of Records. Beginning in 1909, Werner Janensch found many additional G. brancai specimens in Tanzania, Africa, including some nearly complete skeletons, and used them to create the composite mounted skeleton seen today. Classification Authentic Giraffatitan skull (behind), compared to that of the small brachiosaur Europasaurus In 1988, Gregory S. Paul noted that Brachiosaurus brancai (on which most popular depictions of Brachiosaurus were based) showed significant differences from the North American Brachiosaurus, especially in the proportions of its trunk vertebrae and in its more gracile build. Paul used these differences to create a subgenus he named Brachiosaurus (Giraffatitan) brancai. In 1991, George Olshevsky asserted that these differences were enough to place the African brachiosaurid in its own genus, simply Giraffatitan. Further differences between the African and North American forms came to light with the description in 1998 of a North American Brachiosaurus skull. This skull, which had been found nearly a century earlier (it is the skull Marsh used on his early reconstructions of Brontosaurus), is identified as \\"Brachiosaurus sp.\\" and may well belong to B. altithorax. The skull is closer to Camarasaurus in some features such as the form of the front teeth and more elongated and less hollowed-out on top than the distinctive short-snouted and high-crested skull of Giraffatitan.Carpenter, K. and Tidwell, V. (1998). \\"Preliminary description of a Brachiosaurus skull from Felch Quarry 1, Garden Park, Colorado.\\" Pp. 69‚Äì84 in: Carpenter, K., Chure, D. and Kirkland, J. (eds.), The Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation: An Interdisciplinary Study. Modern Geology, 23(1-4). The classification of Giraffatitan as a separate genus was not widely followed by other scientists at first, as it was not supported by a rigorous comparison of both species. However, a detailed comparison was published by Michael P. Taylor in 2009. Taylor showed that \\"Brachiosaurus\\" brancai differed from B. altithorax in almost every fossil bone that could be compared, in terms of both size, shape, and proportion, finding that the placement of Giraffatitan in a separate genus was valid. Taylor found evidence of a sister relationship between Giraffatitan and Brachiosaurus, although his analysis omitted other Brachiosaurids. A more recent study on Titanosauriform sauropods by D'Emic (2012) places Giraffatitan as sister to a clade containing Brachiosaurus and a tritomy of Abydosaurus, Cedarosaurus, and Venenosaurus as shown below: Paleobiology The feeding range of Giraffatitan (left) and Sauroposeidon The nostrils of Giraffatitan, like the huge corresponding nasal openings in its skull, were long thought to be located on the top of the head. In past decades, scientists theorized that the animal used its nostrils like a snorkel, spending most of its time submerged in water in order to support its great mass. The current consensus view, however, is that Giraffatitan was a fully terrestrial animal. Studies have demonstrated that water pressure would have prevented the animal from breathing effectively while submerged and that its feet were too narrow for efficient aquatic use. Furthermore, new studies by Lawrence Witmer (2001) show that, while the nasal openings in the skull were placed high above the eyes, the nostrils would still have been close to the tip of the snout (a study which also lends support to the idea that the tall \\"crests\\" of brachiosaurs supported some sort of fleshy resonating chamber). =Brain= Giraffatitans brain measured about 300 cubic centimetres, which, like those of other sauropods, was small compared to its massive body size. A 2009 study calculated its Encephalization Quotient (a rough estimate of possible intelligence) at a low 0.62 or 0.79, depending on the size estimate used. Like other sauropods, Giraffatitan has a sacral enlargement above the hip which some older sources misleadingly referred to as a \\"second brain\\". However, glycogen bodies are a more likely explanation. =Metabolism= If Giraffatitan was endothermic (warm-blooded), it would have taken an estimated ten years to reach full size, if it were instead poikilothermic (cold- blooded), then it would have required over 100 years to reach full size. As a warm-blooded animal, the daily energy demands of Giraffatitan would have been enormous; it would probably have needed to eat more than ~182 kg (400 lb) of food per day. If Giraffatitan was fully cold-blooded or was a passive bulk endotherm, it would have needed far less food to meet its daily energy needs. Some scientists have proposed that large dinosaurs like Giraffatitan were gigantotherms. Internal organs of these giant sauropods were probably enormous. Paleoecology Restoration of two individuals Giraffatitan lived in what is now Tanzania in the Late Jurassic Tendaguru Formation. Since 2012, the boundary between the Kimmeridgian and Tithonian is dated at 152.1 million years ago.Gradstein, F.M.; Ogg, J.G.; Schmitz, M.D. & Ogg, G.M., 2012, A Geologic Time Scale 2012, Elsevier The Tendaguru ecosystem primarily consisted of three types of environment: shallow, lagoon-like marine environments, tidal flats and low coastal environments; and vegetated inland environments. The marine environment existed above the fair weather wave base and behind siliciclastic and ooid barriers. It appeared to have had little change in salinity levels and experienced tides and storms. The coastal environments consisted of brackish coastal lakes, ponds and pools. These environments had little vegetation and were probably visited by herbivorous dinosaurs mostly during droughts. The well vegetated inlands were dominated by conifers. Overall, the Late Jurassic Tendaguru climate was subtropical to tropical with seasonal rains and pronounced dry periods. During the Early Cretaceous, the Tendaguru became more humid. The Tendaguru Beds are similar to the Morrison Formation of North America except in its marine interbeds. Giraffatitan would have coexisted with fellow sauropods like Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and D. sattleri, Janenschia africana, Tendaguria tanzaniensis and Tornieria africanus; ornithischians like Dysalotosaurus lettowvorbecki and Kentrosaurus aethiopicus; the theropods \\"Allosaurus\\" tendagurensis, \\"Ceratosaurus\\" roechlingi, \\"Ceratosaurus\\" ingens, Elaphrosaurus bambergi, Veterupristisaurus milneri and Ostafrikasaurus crassiserratus; and the pterosaur Tendaguripterus recki.Weishampel, David B; et al.

While the Barkley Forum has experienced remarkable competitive success in the last two decades, the Forum has also remained committed to providing debate opportunities for those in under-served communities, both rural and urban. The Emory National Debate Institute initially began in the 1960s to provide debate training for students from rural Georgia. That role expanded in the 1980s to provide opportunities for students from urban areas. The Barkley Forum began extensive outreach in the late 1980s establishing the first metro area Urban debate league. This effort, initially supported by grants from the National Forensic League and Phillips Petroleum, eventually expanded under grants from the Open Society Institute (OSI). The combination of OSI and the Barkley Forum made the growth of Urban debate leagues possible nationwide. From twenty students from various area public schools in the Atlanta area, the Urban Debate Leagues now exist in over fifteen major cities with thousands of participants each year. Melissa Wade is the Executive Director of the Barkley Forum; William Newnam is the Associate Director. Edward Lee is the Director of Debate for the Barkley Forum.

His most recent album, \\"Diamond is Unfadable\\" was released in 2017 on Rumble Pack Records. Light of Love / Sound of Fire In 2010, Yameen released an anime music video for his single, ‚ÄúLight of Love‚Äù featuring singer, Lady Alma. The video was a production of Daisuke Nakayama‚Äôs Realthing studio located in Shibuya, Tokyo and directed by Jamie Vickers (Studio 4¬∞C, Madhouse). ‚ÄúLight of Love‚Äù was a vertical slice of an intended full-featured television pilot called ‚ÄúThe Sound of Fire,‚Äù consisting of characters such as the titular Yameen, Meca, Ichi-go and more featured in the video. The video ends with the cast of characters sitting atop the iconic Hieroglyphics music group 3-eyed logo, a clear nod to Yameen's history as \\"StinkE\\" with the group. SupremeEx The recording alias \\"SupremeEx\\" is generally reserved for collaborative concept albums between Yameen and Tajai of Souls of Mischief / Hieroglyphics. In 1998, SupremeEx released the instrumental-only affair, Destructor on retail cassette which originally caught the ear of Tajai and also lead to collaborations with Bobbito's Footworks, Electronic Arts / EA Sports and Eck≈ç Unltd. clothing, among others. SupremeEx & Tajai began recording what would become their first project together, Projecto: 2501 that same year. In 1999, SupremeEx and Tajai released Projecto: 2501 as the first album on Tajai's fledgling Hieroglyphics Imperium sub-imprint, Clear Label Records. The critically acclaimed EP - applauded for its imaginative use of story telling elements such as included trading cards, Enhanced CD and web- delivered content - featured guest artists Shing02, Low Budget (Hollertronix), Jay Biz (Hieroglyphics), DJ Nozawa & Major Terror. Additional content was also included on the Enhanced CD including a bonus MP3, computer wallpaper, videos in the studio recording \\"Projecto\\" and more. In 2005, Rumble Pack Records released an all-new full-length album from SupremeEx & Tajai entitled, Nuntype. Again, building on the story-telling aspects the duo established on, \\"Projecto\\" Nuntype is an album about Chaos, Prophecy and Change with Tajai as a deity who wields the power of Creation. Guest artist included R&B; crooner, Goapele on the album's single, \\"Meaning\\". Although never established as an official labelmate, nor indicative of the classic \\"Hiero sound\\", Yameen's roots as Stinke -- the creator and curator of Hieroglyphics.com between 1995 and 2001 -- offer him a curious niche in helping broaden the Hiero discography. StinkE (Web Developer) Yameen, under his nom de web \\"StinkE,\\" designed and coded many popular hiphop websites and was featured as one of URB magazine's \\"Next 100\\" people to watch in April 2001. His work with the music group Hieroglpyhics proved particularly ground- breaking. In 1995 when the individual group members of Hieroglyphics were each released from their respective major record labels, Yameen‚Äôs fansite caught the attention of Souls of Mischief member Tajai who made the website the official online destination of Hieroglyphics. Hieroglyphics.com was one of the first websites from any music artist and was featured heavily in popular media of the time. Yameen as the site‚Äôs webmaster engaged directly with the group‚Äôs fanbase, fostering a vibrant and active online community at a time when most people did not have access to personal computers or the internet. This community-driven aspect is what allowed the Hieroglyphics to continue to flourish as independent artists without the need of a major label. In 2013, Oakland, California mayor Jean Quan recognized the efforts of Yameen and Hieroglyphics.com as \\"a pioneering entity in technology and innovation and shining example of a local, homegrown business with worldwide appeal and recognition\\" while officially establishing September 3rd as \\"Hiero Day\\" in the city of Oakland, CA. Yameen also coded websites for artists such as Aesop Rock, The Giant Peach, Murs, Mr. Len & more.

He was a member of the New Jersey State Highway Commission and was the president of both the Hoboken Land and Improvement Company and the First National Bank of Hoboken. He was also a director of the First National Bank of Jersey City. Early life Henry Otto Wittpenn was born on October 23, 1871 to Dora and Henry Wittpenn in Jersey City, New Jersey. His father was a fireman, and later owned and operated a grocery store at 320 Communipaw Avenue. He had a brother and two sisters. One of his sisters married Edwin M. Houghtaling and lived in Montclair, New Jersey, and his other sister married George Dinkel.Wittpenns in the 1880 US Census in Jersey City, New Jersey Wittpenn worked for his father, and later for his uncle, at family-owned stores. Career Wittpenn became interested in politics when he gave a speech for James J. Murphy at a convention in Jersey City. Murphy lost the election, but Wittpenn's speech was remembered. He formally entered politics in 1904 as one of the Hudson County, New Jersey supervisors. His run for mayor of Jersey City, New Jersey was in 1907 against the Republican incumbent Mark Fagan. Whitpenn remained in office until 1912 when he lost to Frank Hague. While in office he appointed Cornelia Foster Bradford to the Board of Education. While mayor he saw the completion of the Jersey City Medical Center begun under Mayor Mark Matthew Fagan. =Later career= In 1916, Wittpenn, the comptroller of customs at the New York Customs House, was nominated by the Democratic Party for governor. Frank Hague is believed by many to have connived with Walter E. Edge, the Republican candidate, to help Edge win by a relatively slim 7,430 votes by not encouraging Democrats to vote for Wittpenn. President Woodrow Wilson named Wittpenn as the civilian overseer, of the Port of New York. Wittpenn ran for Governor again in 1916, but was not elected. Henry registered for the draft as \\"Henry Whitpenn\\" but did not serve. In March 1929 Wittpenn was appointed as a State Highway Commissioner by Governor Lawson. Personal life He married Caroline Bayard Stevens (1859-1932), the eldest daughter of Edwin Augustus Stevens on January 6, 1915. She was 11 years older than Wittpenn and the mother of Archibald Stevens Alexander, who had died in 1912. Caroline had previously been married to Archibald Alexander, but her husband had been missing since the divorce. She divorced and waited 20 years to remarry, reportedly to ensure that her first husband was no longer living when she remarried. Wittpenn died on July 25, 1931 at 9:30, at night, aged 59, from blood poisoning. He had been in a coma for the previous two days. He was buried in Hoboken Cemetery. His widow died in 1932. =Legacy= The Wittpenn Bridge opened in 1930, and crosses the Hackensack River between Jersey City, New Jersey and Kearny, New Jersey.

The Dinosauria. 2nd edition. University of California Press, Berkeley. 833 pp. Sauropodomorpha. Macronarians are named after the large diameter of the nasal opening of their skull, known as the external naris, which exceeded the size of the orbit, the skull opening where the eye is located (hence macro- meaning large, and ‚Äìnaria meaning nose). Fossil evidence suggests that macronarian dinosaurs lived from the Late Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) through the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian). Macronarians have been found globally, including discoveries in Argentina, the United States, Portugal, China, and Tanzania. Like other sauropods, they are known to have inhabited primarily terrestrial areas, and little evidence exists to suggest that they spent much time in coastal environments. Macronarians are diagnosed through their distinct characters on their skulls, as well as appendicular and vertebral characters. Macronaria is composed of several subclades and families notably including Camarasauridae and Titanosauriformes, among several others. Titanosauriforms are particularly well known for being some of the largest terrestrial animals to ever exist. Macronaria was described by Wilson and Sereno who proposed the new subdivisions among the clade Neosauropoda. Previously, this clade was thought to have Brachiosaurus and Camarasauridae forming one sister group, and Titanosauroidea and Diplodocoidea forming another. This proposed shift with Macronaria placed Diplodocoidea as an outgroup to the new clade Macronaria, under which all other neosauropods would fall.  Anatomy  The following list includes some of the distinguishing characteristics that are diagnostic for Macronaria: * The long axis of the distal ischial shaft lie on the same plane * Middle and posterior neural spines have distal ends that extend out transversely * Posterior neural spines extend at the tip forming a triangular process upwards. * The anterior chevrons of the tail have open proximal articulation * Robust, spatulate (spoon-like), and broad-crowned teeth * Crests formed by large protruding nasal * Elongate metacarpals * Forelimbs are relatively long in comparison to the hind limbs (most clearly demonstrated by brachiosaurs)  Paleobiology  = Posture, body size, and locomotion = The posture of macronarians is characterized by a novel ‚Äòwide-gauged‚Äô locomotor style, particularly in titanosaurs. While sauropods are known to be the giants of the dinosaurs, macronarians were not exclusively large-bodied. Macronarians show divergence in the evolution of body size with some members both increasing and decreasing in size from the primitive condition. For example, despite all being in the titanosaur clade, Argentinosaurus reached enormous sizes (~50 tons), while Saltasaurus and Magyarosaurus reached only 1.5-3 metric tons, which is fairly small for sauropods. While some macronarians represent some of the largest terrestrial vertebrates ever known, other macronarians experienced a steady size decrease over time. = Biogeography = Sauropods, widely speaking, have been associated with both coastal and inland environments. It is believed that macronarians such as titanosaurs were strictly terrestrial and associated with inland environments such as lacustrine systems. These findings are based on ‚Äòwide-gauged‚Äô trackways produced by titanosaurs which are strongly correlated with terrestrial sediments. It is also believed that macronarians have Gondwanan origins. Camarasaurus is among the most commonly found dinosaur from the Late Jurassic deposits of the Morrison Formation in the US. Unlike Camarasaurus, Titanosaurs were most commonly found in the Southern Hemisphere with the exception of Alamosaurus which was found in North America. There is strong geologic evidence that a land bridge between South and North America existed at the end of the Cretaceous allowing for dispersal of organisms between the two landmasses. Cretaceous sauropods are thought to have moved northward from South America, thus explaining the high density of South American sauropods, and the sole appearance of Alamosaurus in the Western Interior. = Diet = It is well established that all sauropods, including macronarians, were obligate herbivores. Unlike their sister group, the diplodocids, which were thought to feed on low-lying plants, camarasaurids and other macronarians likely had strongly upward-oriented necks for browsing trees and taller plants. Each tooth family in Camarasaurus is thought to have had a maximum of three replacement teeth and tooth formation took about 315 days. The replacement rate is thought to be one tooth every 62 days ‚Äì this is about the same level or higher than non-sauropod herbivores, though it is lower than the replacement rates of the sister taxa, Diplodocus. It is thought that this may be related to the fact that the low-browsing taxa ingested more grit and thus needed to replace teeth more, while Camarasaurus and other macronarians fed on mid to upper canopy plants where exogenous grit is almost non-existent. Given the large body size of these neosauropod herbivores, it is thought that this type of niche partitioning, characterized by different species taking advantage of different resources, was necessary for coexistence. It was at one point believed that polished pebbles occasionally found with sauropod skeletons were gastroliths. Gastroliths are stones intentionally swallowed to aid with digestion (as is seen in a variety of modern birds). However, more recent taphonomic and sedimentological evidence suggests that sauropods did not use stones for digestion due to the general rarity of finding gastric mill-like stones with sauropod remains, and low relative mass of the stones to the size of sauropod bodies. When gastrolith-like rocks are found with sauropods, it may be that they were accidentally ingested, or intentionally ingested for mineral uptake. Phylogeny Macronaria is nested within Neosauropoda and is sister to Diplodocoidea. These groups split around the mid- to late-Jurassic and end at the K/Pg boundary. In the less than 100 Myr that they lived, macronarians developed at least 216 synapomorphies and autapomorphies. Despite the fact that macronarians are named after cranial openings, they are described by more appendicular synapomorphies. The species that survived late into the Cretaceous were characterized by stocky, wide- gauged posture, most notably the highly derived saltasaurines. Also under Macronaria are Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Titanosauria. Camarasauromorpha is the most basal group of Macronaria. The cladogram below follows Jos√© Luis Barco Rodr√≠guez (2010).

Foreign Service Officers formulate and implement the foreign policy of the United States. FSOs spend most of their careers overseas as members of U.S. embassies, consulates, and other diplomatic missions, though some receive assignments to serve at combatant commands, Congress, and educational institutions such as the various U.S. War Colleges. Foreign Service Officers are one of five categories of Foreign Service employees. Other categories include Chiefs of mission, Ambassadors at large, Foreign Service Personnel, and Foreign Service Nationals. As of 2017, there were over 8,000 FSOs. FSO career tracks FSOs of the State Department are split between five career tracks, called \\"cones\\": Consular Officers, Economic Officers, Management Officers, Political Officers, and Public Diplomacy Officers. *Consular Officers are charged primarily with working with American citizens with activities such as adoptions and would be charged with evacuating Americans from the country in the case of a disaster. *Economic Officers work with foreign economic agencies to facilitate economic issues as well as foreign policy dealing with technology and sciences. *Management Officers are responsible for the affairs of an embassy or consulate and dealing with the personnel and budgets of the embassy. *Political Officers have the responsibility of interacting with foreign governments on policy issues and negotiating policy. *Public Diplomacy Officers inform the citizens of their respective countries on the actions of the embassy, including meeting with the press and giving educational events. FSOs of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), Commercial Service, Foreign Agricultural Service, and Broadcasting Board of Governors are selected through processes specific to the hiring agency, and follow career tracks separate from those of State Department FSOs. For example, within USAID, there are multiple technical \\"backstops\\" including: * Agriculture * Contracting * Crisis Stabilization and Governance * Economic Growth * Education * Engineering * Environment * Executive * Financial Management * Legal * Population, Health and Nutrition * Private Enterprise * Program/Project Development Many leadership roles at U.S. embassies are filled from the ranks of career FSOs. Recently, about two-thirds of U.S. Ambassadors have been career Foreign Service members primarily drawn from the Department of State, although other foreign affairs agencies have produced Ambassadors from time to time. Almost all of the remaining third are political appointees, though a handful of State Department Senior Executive Service personnel have received Ambassadorships. FSOs also help fill critical management and foreign policy positions at the headquarters of foreign affairs agencies in Washington, D.C. Hiring process Applicants for State Department FSO jobs go through a highly competitive written exam, oral assessment, and security investigation process before they are eligible to be hired. Of the more than 100,000 applicants for State Department FSO positions between 2001 and 2006, only 2,100 became Foreign Service Officers.H. Kopp and C. Gillespie, Career Diplomacy: Life and Work in the U.S. Foreign Service, 2008. Once candidates have completed the application process, received a top secret security clearance, been medically cleared for worldwide deployment, and passed a final suitability review, they receive a score and are placed on a hiring register for their career tracks. New candidates are appointed from the top of the register (highest score), and candidates who are not appointed within 18 months will be removed from the register. Candidates may decline one offer; declining a second will strike their names from the register. Some candidates go on \\"do-not-call\\" status until they are ready to receive offers, but the 18-month timer still continues to run. It is common for a candidate with a low score to simply expire from the register, thus making the process even more competitive. In the end, fewer than 2% of initial applicants to the State Department Foreign Service will matriculate as Foreign Service Officers. In extremely rare cases when no Foreign Service Officers are available, non- career civil servants can be appointed by the Secretary for entry into the Foreign Service, providing they meet rigorous standards expected of career members. These limited appointees are not officially members of Foreign Service and must leave anytime a career officer becomes available for their positions. This is a legal requirement negotiated with the American Foreign Service Association. Applicants for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) FSO jobs follow a somewhat different process. Because USAID has a strong technical focus in many of its overseas positions, FSOs are generally recruited for specific backstops. Most successful candidates will have an advanced degree (often a masters) and pertinent job experience related to their backstop and will undergo an interview and testing process tailored to that backstop, but otherwise it is similar to that for State Department applicants.\\"USAID Careers\\".

The transformation was invented by Danish mathematician Johannes Hjelmslev. It utilizes Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky's 23rd theorem from his work Geometrical Investigations on the Theory of Parallels. The method for mapping an infinite line onto a finite one in hyperbolic geometry Lobachevsky observes, using a combination of his 16th and 23rd theorems, that it is a fundamental characteristic of hyperbolic geometry that there must exist a distinct angle of parallelism for any given line length. Let us say for the length AE, its angle of parallelism is angle BAF. This being the case, line AH and EJ will be hyperparallel, and therefore will never meet. Consequently, any line drawn perpendicular to base AE between A and E must necessarily cross line AH at some finite distance. Johannes Hjelmslev discovered from this a method of compressing an entire hyperbolic plane into a finite circle. By applying this process to every line within the plane, one could compress this plane so that infinite spaces could be seen as planar. Hjelmslev's transformation would not yield a proper circle however. The circumference of the circle does not have a corresponding location within the plane, and therefore, the product of a Hjelmslev transformation is more aptly called a Hjelmslev Disk. Likewise, when this transformation is extended in all three dimensions, it is referred to as a Hjelmslev Ball. A completed Hjelmslev disk representing two intersecting lines A completed Hjelmslev disk representing two hyperparallel lines frameleftA completed Hjelmslev disk representing two ultraparallel lines There are a few properties that are retained through the transformation which enable valuable information to be ascertained therefrom, namely: #The image of a circle sharing the center of the transformation will be a circle about this same center. #As a result, the images of all the right angles with one side passing through the center will be right angles. #Any angle with the center of the transformation as its vertex will be preserved. #The image of any straight line will be a finite straight line segment. #Likewise, the point order is maintained throughout a transformation, i.e. if B is between A and C, the image of B will be between the image of A and the image of C. #The image of a rectilinear angle is a rectilinear angle. The Hjelmslev transformation and the Klein model If we represent hyperbolic space by means of the Klein model, and take the center of the Hjelmslev transformation to be the center point of the Klein model, then the Hjelmslev transformation maps points in the unit disk to points in a disk centered at the origin with a radius less than one. Given a real number k, the Hjelmslev transformation, if we ignore rotations, is in effect what we obtain by mapping a vector u representing a point in the Klein model to ku, with 0<k<1. It is therefore in terms of the model a uniform scaling which sends lines to lines and so forth. To beings living in a hyperbolic space it might be a suitable way of making a map.

Town Manager Matt Galligan said 200 people from South Windsor and neighboring towns were sleeping in the high school each night. Fuel cell power helped more than 600 people eat three hot meals a day prepared by kitchen staff. The nurses' station was operational; there were hot showers and charging stations for electronics. May 2015: South Windsor High School suspends and eventually compels the resignation of a tenured and decorated teacher for involvement in a reading of Allen Ginsberg's poem \\"Please Master\\" during an Advanced Placement English Class.

During the conflict Mar√≠as sided with the Republicans, although his actual contributions were limited to propaganda articles and broadcasts. Following the end of the war in 1939, Mar√≠as returned to education. His doctoral thesis was rejected by the university, however, and handed over to the police, due to his inclusion of a number of lines critical of the rule of Franco. As a consequence of his writings Mar√≠as was briefly imprisoned and, upon his release, banned from teaching. Fortunately for Mar√≠as the proceeds from the sales of his History of Philosophy, which went through countless editions, meant that the punishment did not seriously damage his livelihood. In 1948 he co-founded, along with his former teacher Jos√© Ortega y Gasset, the Instituto de Humanidades (which he went on to head after the death of Ortega in 1955). Between the late 1940s and the 1970s, being unable to teach in Spain, Mar√≠as taught at numerous institutions in the United States, including Harvard University, Yale University, Wellesley College, and UCLA. Mar√≠as wrote on a wide variety of subjects during his long career. A subject of particular interest was Miguel de Cervantes' Don Quixote. In 1964 he was elected into the Real Academia Espa√±ola, and he won a Prince of Asturias award in 1996. He is the father of novelist Javier Mar√≠as and art historian Fernando Mar√≠as, and married the sister of director Jes√∫s Franco.  Works  *Juventud en el mundo antiguo.

Her book Emigrants and Society received the 1990 Herbert E. Bolton Prize of the Conference on Latin American History. She is Professor Emerita of History at the University of Florida and served as Department Chair. Altman is noted as a social historian for her primary research into migration patterns and individual migrations in the Spanish colonial period and the effects of source communities in the Old World on the economies and social development of destination communities in the New World, and vice versa. Life and education Ida Altman was born in Washington, D.C. She graduated from Washington-Lee High School in Arlington, Virginia. She received her B.A. from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor; a master's degree from the University of Texas at Austin; and her Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University, where she studied Atlantic history. Altman taught at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and taught for many years at the University of New Orleans, where she was Professor of History and then designated University Research Professor. She served as chair of the History department until shortly after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Dr. Altman joined the faculty of the University of Florida in August 2006 and became chair of the history department in August 2010. In 2002, she married Richmond F. Brown (1961-2016), a historian of Guatemala (PhD Tulane University).  Publications  Altman's first article was published in 1976, \\"A Family and Region in the Northern Fringe Lands: The Marqueses de Aguayo of Nuevo Le√≥n and Coahuila\\", in the now classic anthology on regional variation in colonial Mexico.James Lockhart and Ida Altman, eds. The Provinces of Early Mexico: Variants of Spanish American Regional Evolution, UCLA Latin American Center Publications 1976, pp. 253-272 For her study of the elite Marqueses de Aguayo over several generations, she drew on rich archival sources, mainly at the University of Texas, with specificity of locale and individuals, and placed them within the larger colonial world. When Altman finished her Ph.D. in 1982, the idea of the Atlantic World was not widely accepted as a field in history, although Johns Hopkins University was an important innovator in this field. Through meticulous archival research, she traced patterns of Spanish conquistadors returning to their home region of Extremadura in Western Spain. Her doctoral dissertation brought attention to the whole field of Spanish Atlantic history, which culminated when she was a co-winner of the Conference on Latin American History's Bolton Prize (1990) for the book, followed quickly by a prize awarded by the Spanish Ministry of Culture. Altman followed up Emigrants and Society quickly with her second co-edited and co-authored volume, \\"To Make America\\": European Immigration in the Early Modern Period, which broadened the conversation about transatlantic migration.Ida Altman and James J. Horn, eds.), \\"To Make America\\": European Emigration in the Early Modern Period, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991. In her second single-author monograph, Transatlantic Ties, Altman focused on two particular localities, the textile-producing Spanish town of Brihuega and Mexico's second-most important colonial city, Puebla de los Angeles. She traced social and economic networks, as well as cultural continuities and discontinuities in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Puebla was a natural way-station between the port of Veracruz and the viceregal capital, Mexico City, but it developed as a rich agricultural zone and as a locus for textile production for a colonial mass market. Push factors from Spain as local industry declined meant that Puebla represented new economic horizons for skilled Spanish immigrants. Altman's research and reconstruction of social networks in Brihuega and Puebla shows how immigrants maintained their identity in a new location. Her work demonstrates that identity politics of immigrants is not a modern phenomenon, but one with a long history.Ida Altman, Transatlantic Ties in the Spanish Empire: Brihuega, Spain, and Puebla, Mexico, 1560-1620. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2000. In her third major monograph, The War for Mexico's West, Altman brings to an English-speaking readership the story of the Spanish attempts to conquer and settle Western Mexico, a far more complex and lengthy endeavor than the quick and decisive victory which they had gained in Central Mexico with the aid of indigenous allies. This historical study blends narrative history of the early campaigns from both the Spanish and indigenous perspectives, without the benefit of contemporary accounts by the participants. Through the close reading of Spanish-language documentation she has been able to produce a multifaceted picture of the indigenous peoples' response to Spanish conquest, settlement, and attempts to extract labor and tribute where there were no indigenous precedents. Unlike the conquest of central Mexico, the war in the west was protracted and marked by the most serious challenge to Spanish triumphalist expansion in the multi- ethnic region rebellion known in history as the Mixton War (1541). Altman examines the initial Spanish expeditions to the region, one by a kinsman of Hern√°n Cort√©s, and then the more horrific campaign of Nu√±o de Guzm√°n. Altman's examination of the historical dynamics of the Mixton rebellion is concrete evidence for long-term, complex planning by multiple indigenous groups to expel the Spaniards and regain their autonomy. Her examination of the role of viceroy Don Antonio de Mendoza in putting down the rebellion supports the general picture of Mendoza as a remarkable administrator. In Altman's close examination of Mendoza's end-of-term assessment (residencia) she recounts incidents that show even he had a ruthless and pragmatic side.Ida Altman, The War for Mexico's West. Indians and Spaniards in New Galicia, 1524-1550. Albuquerque: New Mexico, 2010. Altman's book brings narrative back into history, which is particularly for non-specialists. With Mexicanist colleagues Sarah Cline and Javier Pescador, Altman co-authored a textbook entitled The Early History of Greater Mexico. It is described in a review as \\"the best textbook on colonial Mexico to date. It is unrivaled in its breadth of coverage and its insight.\\"John Kicza, \\"New Interpretations of Colonial Mexico from the Conquest to Independence,\\" Latin American Research Review vol. 40, Number 3, 2005, p. 334.

It aired as the second episode of the season on May 31, 1990. The episode was written by Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David and directed by Tom Cherones. The narrative features Jerry Seinfeld agreeing to attend a birthday party with his ex-girlfriend Elaine Benes. During the party, Jerry tries to flirt with another woman, but fails to learn anything about her except her place of work. Jerry is reluctant to ask Elaine for the woman's number because he does not talk to her about other women. Jerry's father, Morty, suggests that he \\"stake out\\" the woman's workplace and pretend to meet her accidentally, which Jerry does. \\"The Stake Out\\" is the first episode to feature Jerry's parents. The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Plot Jerry and Elaine have just ended their relationship, but have chosen to remain friends. Elaine invites Jerry to a birthday party; he agrees to go on the condition that she accompanies him to a wedding that he and his parents have been invited to. At the party, Jerry meets an attractive woman named Vanessa. He wants to flirt with her, but is uncomfortable doing so in Elaine's presence. The woman leaves with another man before Jerry finds out her name; however, he learns that she works at a law firm called \\"Sagman, Bennett, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft\\". During the party, Elaine tries to tell Jerry about a dream she had, which featured him. Jerry tries to end the conversation but this results in an argument after the party is over. Back at his apartment, Jerry's parents, Morty and Helen, sleep over, with Jerry sleeping in Kramer's apartment. He talks about the party and claims that he cannot get the phone number of the woman from Elaine because he does not talk about other women with her; additionally, she is still angry with him. Morty suggests that Jerry \\"stake out\\" the woman by waiting outside her office, an idea which Jerry likes. The following day, Jerry and George Costanza perform the stake out, pretending that they are coming to see someone else in the building named \\"Art Corvelay\\", but under pressure, George insists that they make it \\"Art Vandelay\\". They meet the woman, who says the man she left the party with was her cousin. The two then decide to go out on a date. Later that night, Jerry finds out from his mother that Elaine knows about the stake out. On the day of the wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry was because it was the first time she saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their relationships if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out. Production \\"The Stake Out\\" is based on a real life incident in which David was with a woman that he had dated previously named Monica Yates. They then went to a restaurant and David met another woman. However, he could not flirt as much as he wanted due to the presence of Yates. David did find out the name of the building where she worked at and staked her out. The names of the people in the title of the law firm are friends Larry David made at college. This episode prompted running gags that were used in later episodes. These were the importer-exporter, George's ambitions of becoming an architect and Art Vandelay. The character of Vanessa (named after a woman David once went out with) also reappears in a later episode from the first season, \\"The Stock Tip\\". \\"The Stake Out\\" is the first episode to mention the past relationship between Jerry and Elaine. Although it was the third episode to be filmed (after \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\" and \\"Male Unbonding\\"), it was the second episode to be broadcast. The episode order was changed because \\"The Stake Out\\" provided more background information about Elaine and her relationship with Jerry. Julia Louis-Dreyfus commented that she liked the script for the episode because it made the character seem human. She also commented on the fact that it was racy due to the mention of a pornographic film. The opening scene caused some problems because it featured a woman walking off the set and taking one step down to get off it. Gleen Forbes, the set designer, thought that this made the show look cheap. The scene in which Jerry and Elaine are in a taxi was filmed in a studio using a black background and moving a fake taxi, due to budget restraints, in a method known as \\"Poor Man's Process.\\" This is the first episode to feature Jerry's parents. Only one casting session was performed to find the actors for the roles. Philip Sterling was originally cast to play the role of Morty Seinfeld, but was replaced with Phil Bruns. Bruns was then replaced as well because Seinfeld and David wanted the character to be harsher. As a result, the role was recast and given to Barney Martin ‚Äî who had no idea that another actor had already established the part. In this episode Kramer greets Morty by name. Unlike later episodes featuring recast characters, this episode featuring Phil Bruns' scenes were not re-filmed for syndication with Barney Martin substituting for Bruns, as the characters had aged too much in the show for that to be an option.https://screenrant.com/seinfeld-dark-hidden-secrets- behind-the-scenes-facts/ Reception When \\"The Stake Out\\" was first broadcast on May 31, 1990, the episode attracted a Nielsen rating of 16.2/24, meaning that 16.2% of American households watched the episode, and that 24% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. When the episode was first repeated, on December 2, 1992, a special introductory film was made featuring Louis-Dreyfus and Seinfeld, in which they stated that this episode was the first one they did together. Strictly speaking, though, it was just the first episode broadcast ‚Äî in terms of production order, \\"Male Unbonding\\" was the first episode in which the two characters both appeared. The episode was nominated for a Writers Guild Award in 1991. Holly E. Ordway for DVD Talk Review commented positively on not just this episode, but the whole of the first season, saying, \\"What's not to like about an episode like 'The Stakeout,' in which (among other things) we are witness to the invention of George's alter ego, Art Vandelay (and his import/export business)?\\" Mary Kay Shilling and Mike Flaherty of Entertainment Weekly also liked the episode but had some doubts, saying it was, \\"A painfully realistic take on the lovers-to- friends transition that should have been more comically fruitful.\\" However, some reviews of the episode were critical, both now and at the time. When first broadcast, Matt Roush from USA Today wrote: \\"Lacking much in the way of attitude, the show seems obsolete and irrelevant. What it boils down to is that Seinfeld is a mayonnaise clown in the world that requires a little horseradish.\\" Colin Jacobson for DVD Movie Guide criticized the writing, saying, \\"the show's rather bland. It provides the occasional chuckle, but the characters aren't formed yet, and that makes the program ring false. The ending reconciliation between Jerry and Elaine causes particular problems; it doesn't turn sappy, but it comes too close for Seinfeld.\\" References  External links  Seinfeld (season 1) episodes 1990 American television episodes ","title":"The Stake Out (Seinfeld)"},{"id":"3535198","text":"√ñmer Z√ºlf√º Livanelioƒülu (born June 20, 1946), better known as Z√ºlf√º Livaneli, is a Turkish musician, author, poet, and politician. Livaneli is known for his novels that interweave diverse social and historical backgrounds, figures, and incidents, such as in Bliss which won the Barnes & Noble's Discovery of Great New Writers Award in 2006,Discover Great New Writers: 2008 Discover Award Archive, Barnes & Noble, 2006, Retrieved 17 September 2008. and in his Serenade for Nadia, Leyla's House, and My Brother's Story, which were all translated into 37 languages and won numerous Turkish and International literary awards. His novels have been turned into theatrical films, stage plays, and operas. Livaneli was imprisoned several times during the 1971 Turkish coup d'√©tat because of his political views and had to leave Turkey in 1972 and went on exile. He lived in Stockholm, Paris, Athens, and New York where he met and collaborated with artists and intellectuals such as Elia Kazan, Arthur Miller, James Baldwin, and Peter Ustinov among others. Livaneli returned to Turkey in 1984. His works and cultural and political activities and contributions to world peace were recognized by UNESCO in 1995 when he was appointed Goodwill Ambassador to UNESCO‚Äîa post. He quit this UNESCO post in 2016 to protest the Turkish State's deliberate destruction of the historic Kurdish Old Town of Diyarbakir.https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey- rights-un/turkish-writer-quits-unesco-to-protest-damage-to-heritage-rights- abuse-idUSKCN0YH1KA He served a term in the Turkish Parliament as well as in the Council of Europe. Livaneli is a writer as he is as a poet and a songwriter, cultural and political activist. Although he first became known for his contemporary music, Livaneli turned his focus to writing, in the last decades, when he realized that literature was closer to his heart. His first collection of short stories, A Child in Purgatory, published in 1978 was turned into a movie by Swedish and German TV. He is also a prominent social- democrat politician and was a member of the Turkish parliament for one term. Livaneli's novels have been turned into theatrical movies, stage plays, and operas. Livaneli has composed some three hundred songs, a rhapsody recorded by London Symphony Orchestra‚Äì, and a ballet. His compositions have reached cult status nationwide and have been performed by artists such as Joan Baez, Maria Farantouri, Mar√≠a del Mar Bonet, Udo Lindenberg, Haris Alexiou, Jocelyn B. Smith, and Kate Westbrook. He has also written five plays and thirty film soundtracks. Among these soundtracks are the soundtrack for \\"Yol\\" (The Path), directed by Yilmaz G√ºney and winner of the Golden Palm in Cannes Film Festival, \\"The Herd\\", directed by Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney and Zeki √ñktem, and \\"Shirin's Wedding\\" by German director Helma Sanders-Brahms. He has produced albums and performed with Mikis Theodorakis and Maria Farantouri, and he has also collaborated with Manos Hatzidakis, Giora Feidman, Inti-Illimani and √Ångel Parra. His 1997 Ankara concert was attended by no less than 500 thousand people.CHP'de barƒ±≈ü, yurtta barƒ±≈ü, d√ºnyada barƒ±≈ü, Sabah, 19 January 2005, Retrieved 16 September 2008. In 2010, he sang 'Mothers of The Disappeared' with Bono at U2's concert in Istanbul, Turkey, which was U2's first-ever concert in Istanbul. Livaneli has been distinguished with the awards Best Album of the Year (Greece), the Edison Award (Holland), and Best Album of the Year (Music Critics Guild of Germany), and the \\"Premio Luigi Tenco\\" Best Songwriter Award, San Remo, Italy, in 1999, among others. Personal life Livaneli's real name is √ñmer Z√ºlf√º Livanelioƒülu. His father was a judge and later president of the Turkish Supreme Court. He has four brothers and a sister. His mother died at the age of 38, when he was 20, and his father later remarried. His wife's name is √úlker and his daughter's name is Aylin; she was born in Ankara, Turkey. √úlker is a translator. In March 2020, Livaneli announced that he and his wife had become infected with coronavirus during their visit to New York in February during the COVID-19 pandemic. He further stated that after receiving treatment both of them had fully recovered and were quarantined in Turkey. First album and rise to fame Livaneli was trying to go to Europe because he had gone to jail two times. For his first album, he didn't use his current name, Z√ºlf√º Livaneli. Instead, he used the name \\"Ozanoglu\\". Yet he did not get to the point where he wanted to be, therefore, he started using his current name, Z√ºlf√º Livaneli, on his new album, Chants R√©volutionnaires Turcs (Turkish Revolutionary songs) in 1971 or 1973. When he was in Europe, his brother Ferhat informed him about how his songs were being sung by everyone in Turkey while they were protesting the government. Livaneli then made an album called Nazim T√ºrk√ºs√º. The album turned the well renowned poet N√¢zƒ±m Hikmet's poems to music and it became and stayed at the top hit on albums album for 48 weeks. In 1986, the Greek composer Mikis Theodorakis met Livaneli. They then proceeded to make an album called G√ºne≈ü Topla Benim ƒ∞√ßin (Gather The Sun For Me). After when the album was released in Turkey it was one of works at the peak of the Turkish music market. At that time Livaneli met Ahmet Kaya which was another folk singer. 1980s were the years Livaneli reached his first peak. The London Orchestra performed with Livaneli in 1998, and in 1999, UNESCO assisted Livaneli on the release of that album. Political life Apart from his remarkable career as an author and poet, Livaneli was highly influential in Turkish politics over the last thirty years. In the 1994 Turkish local elections, he was nominated as candidate for mayorship of Istanbul by Social Democratic Populist Party but his bid failed. In the 2002 Turkish general election, Livaneli was elected to the T√ºrkiye B√ºy√ºk Millet Meclisi (Grand National Assembly of Turkey) as a Deputy for Istanbul for the Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi (CHP). Livaneli resigned from the CHP in early 2005, however, in protest at \\"CHP's non-democratic and authoritarian system of politics\\",Two Turk MPs resign from their parties, highlighting tensionsZ√ºlf√º Livaneli CHP'den istifa etti During his political career in Ankara, Livaneli presented a legislative proposal for amending Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code. The amendment proposed that the concept of \\"Turkishness\\" should be replaced with that of the \\"Turkish nation\\" which would put an emphasis on the concept of \\"nation\\" which, as formulated by the Republic, unites under its umbrella people of different origins. With this amendment, there would no more be a stress on the notion of Turkish race. Besides this, in 2006 he presented a proposal to the National Assembly demanding that a commission be established in order to investigate the reasons for increasing violence and fanaticism among the youth; his proposal was accepted. Following his 2005 resignation from the party membership, Livaneli continued in his position in the Grand National Assembly as an independent until the end of that term. He did not take part in the 2007 Turkish elections and appears politically inactive. He has since concentrated on his art and books. Livaneli was a daily contributor as a columnist in the newspapers Sabah, Vatan, and Milliyet. Films Livaneli directed four feature films: Iron Earth, Copper Sky, Mist, Shahmaran and Veda. His film Iron Earth, Copper Sky was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. Veda that based on the life of Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk is the last film written and directed by Z√ºlf√º Livaneli. One of the most acclaimed Turkish films of the decade ‚Äì and one of the first narrative films to tackle the highly charged subject of honor killings ‚Äì Bliss was originally adopted from Livaneli's best-seller novel.

Such boots are generally installed on the leading edges of wings and control surfaces (e.g. horizontal and vertical stabilizer) as these areas are most likely to accumulate ice and any contamination could severely affect the aircraft's performance.  Design  A deicing boot consists of a thick rubber membrane that is installed over the surface to be deiced. As atmospheric icing occurs and ice builds up, a pneumatic system inflates the boot with compressed air. This expansion in size cracks any ice that has accumulated, and this ice is blown away into the airflow. The boots are then deflated to return the wing or surface to its optimal shape. Boots require proper care. Holes in the boot may create air leaks that will decrease the effectiveness of the boots. As such, boots must be carefully inspected before each flight and any holes or cuts must be patched.  History  Deicing boots were invented by the B.F. Goodrich Corporation in about 1929/30 in Akron, Ohio. The work was begun by retired Ph.D chemist, William C. Geer. In its quest to develop deicing boots, the company built a large indoor facility in Akron to replicate bad weather and icing on aircraft wings.\\"Artificial Blizzards Help To Protect Planes\\", February 1931, Popular Mechanics illustration of blizzard machine and how de- icing boots work\\"Overshoes For Planes End Ice Danger\\", November 1931, Popular Science bottom of page 28William M. Leary, \\"We Freeze to Please: A History of NASA's Icing Research Tunnel and the Quest for Flight Safety, 2002, p. 10  Alternatives  The use of deicing boots may enable an aircraft to be certified for flight into known icing conditions. However, they may not be sufficient to handle extremely severe icing, where ice can accumulate faster than the boots can shed it, or it accumulates on non-booted surfaces to the point where there is a dangerous loss of lift or control, or increase in weight. Deicing boots are most commonly seen on medium-sized airliners and utility aircraft. Larger airliners and military jets tend to use heating systems within the wing, keeping it constantly warm and preventing ice from forming. Sources of heat include: * Bleed air systems use high-temperature, compressed air from the engine compressor sections, and duct it towards the sections to be de-iced where it delivers its heat before being released into the airflow. * Electrothermal systems pass electric current through resistive parts, usually the leading edges themselves. These systems require substantial electrical power and are generally used on large aircraft, such as the 787. Resistive deicing may also be applied to propeller and helicopter rotor blades.  Ice bridging  'Ice bridging' is the theory that activating deicing boots early may lead to a condition where slushy ice is pushed into a hollow shell around the inflated boot, then freezes in place. This shell can then no longer be dislodged by any further operation of the boot. Bridging was described by the aviation writer Ernest Gann in his memoir Fate Is the Hunter. The bridging theory is now disputed. In 2008 the NTSB issued an alert that pilots should, \\"activate boots as soon as the airplane enters icing conditions\\". Their claim was that bridging was \\"extremely rare, if it exists at all\\" and that there were no instances where it had led to an accident. Unwarranted fear of ice bridging contributed to the fatal crash of Comair Flight 3272.

Use In the early days of cross-country travel by horse and wagon, Terre Haute, Indiana, benefited by its location on the old National Road between Indianapolis and Vandalia, Illinois. The National Road was later named U.S. Highway 40 when it became a U.S. Highway in 1926. At the same time, US 41 was commissioned between Chicago, Illinois, and Miami, Florida. This north‚Äìsouth highway through downtown Terre Haute followed Seventh Street at the time, and met US 40, which followed Wabash Avenue, the main east‚Äìwest street in town. The Seventh and Wabash intersection thus became known as the \\"Crossroads of America\\", an appellation now memorialized with a historical marker at that corner. Indianapolis, the state capital, is also unofficially nicknamed the Crossroads of America, due to its central location at the junction of four major Interstate Highways: Interstate 65, Interstate 69, Interstate 70, and Interstate 74. Vandalia, Ohio, has also been called the Crossroads of America because US 40 and the eastern division of the Dixie Highway crossed in the middle of the town.

In all, 18 campaigns were fought, primarily in what is now northern Germany. They resulted in the incorporation of Saxony into the Frankish realm and their forcible conversion from Germanic paganism to Catholicism.Jennifer R. Davis (2015), Charlemagne's Practice of Empire (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press), p. 179. The Royal Frankish Annals record battles in the years 772‚Äì780, 782‚Äì785, 793‚Äì799, 802 and 804. The Saxons were divided into four subgroups in four regions. Nearest to the ancient Frankish kingdom of Austrasia was Westphalia, and farthest was Eastphalia. In between the two kingdoms was that of Engria (or Engern), and north of the three, at the base of the Jutland peninsula, was Nordalbingia. Despite repeated setbacks, the Saxons resisted steadfastly, returning to raid Charlemagne's domains as soon as he turned his attention elsewhere. Their main leader, Widukind, was a resilient but unresourceful opponent and accepted a peace offering from Charlemagne in a perilous situation, losing face and not preventing Charlemagne from continuing a baptizing war. The agreement failed to save the Saxon tribes' exceptional rights in their homeland. Widukind was baptized in 785 and buried later in the only Germanic church without any honours. First phase In mid-January 772, the sacking and burning of the church of Deventer by a Saxon expedition was the casus belli for the first war waged by Charlemagne to the Saxons. It began with a Frankish invasion of Saxon territory and the subjugation of the Engrians and destruction of their sacred symbol Irminsul near Paderborn in 772 or 773 at Eresburg. Irminsul may have been a hollow tree trunk, presumably representing the pillar supporting the skies--similar to the Nordic tree Yggdrasil and apparently a common belief among the Germanic peoples. Charlemagne's campaign led all the way to the Weser River and destroyed several major Saxon strongholds. After negotiating with some Saxon nobles and obtaining hostages, Charlemagne turned his attention to his war against the Lombards in northern Italy; but Saxon free peasants, led by Widukind, continued to resist and raided Frankish lands in the Rhine region. Armed confrontations continued unabated for years. Charlemagne's second campaign came in the year 775. Then he marched through Westphalia, conquering the fort of Sigiburg, and crossed Engria, where he defeated the Saxons again. Finally, in Eastphalia, he defeated them, and their leader Hessi converted to Christianity. He returned through Westphalia, leaving encampments at Sigiburg and Eresburg. All of Saxony except Nordalbingia was under his control, but the recalcitrant Saxons would not submit for long. After warring in Italy, he returned very rapidly to Saxony (making it to Lippe before the Saxons knew he left Italy) for the third time in 776, when a rebellion destroyed his fortress at Eresburg. The Saxons were once again brought to heel, though Widukind fled to the Danes. Charlemagne built a new camp at Karlstadt. In 777, he called a national diet at Paderborn to integrate Saxony fully into the Frankish kingdom. Many Saxons were baptised. Charlemagne and the Saxons, A. de Neuville, c. 1869 The chief purpose of the diet was to bring Saxony closer to Christianity. Missionaries, mainly Anglo-Saxons from England, were recruited to carry out this task. Charlemagne issued a number of decrees designed to break Saxon resistance and to inflict capital punishment on anyone observing heathen practices or disrespecting the king's peace. His severe and uncompromising position, which earned him the title \\"butcher of Saxons\\", caused his close adviser Alcuin of York, later abbot of Marmoutier Abbey, Tours, to urge leniency, as God's word should be spread not by the sword but by persuasion; but the wars continued. In summer 779, Charlemagne again went into Saxony and conquered Eastphalia, Engria, and Westphalia. At a diet near Lippspringe, he divided the land into missionary districts and Frankish countships. He himself assisted in several mass baptisms (780). He then returned to Italy, and there was no Saxon revolt. From 780 to 782, the land had peace. Middle phase Charlemagne returned in 782 to Saxony and instituted a code of law and appointed counts, both Saxon and Frank. The laws were severe on religious issues, namely the native paganism of the Saxons. This stirred a renewal of the old conflict. That year, in autumn, Widukind returned and led a revolt that resulted in many assaults on the church. The Saxons invaded the area of the Chatti, a Germanic tribe already converted by Saint Boniface and firmly in Charlemagne's empire. Widukind won over a Frankish army at the Battle of S√ºntel while Charles was campaigning against the Sorbs. It was in response to this setback that Charlemagne, at the Blood court of Verden, ordered the beheading of 4,500 Saxons who had rebelled. Upon this Blutgericht, some historians have stated the massacre did not happen, or that it was actually a battle, but according to Alessandro Barbero, none of these claims are credible. The action led to two straight years of constant warfare (783-785), with Charlemagne wintering in central Saxony, at Minden. Gradually, the Franks gained the upper hand. The turning point came in 785, when Widukind had himself baptized and swore fealty to Charlemagne. It was with the conclusion of this war that Charlemagne could have claimed to have conquered Saxony, and the land had peace for the next seven years, though revolts continued sporadically until 804. Conversion of the Saxons, A. de Neuville, c. 1869 Final phase In 792, the Westphalians rose up against their masters in response to forcible recruitment for wars against the Avars. The Eastphalians and Nordalbingians joined them in 793, but the insurrection did not catch on as previous ones and was completely put down by 794. An Engrian rebellion followed closely in 796, but Charlemagne's personal presence and the presence of loyal Christian Saxons and Slavs immediately crushed it. In the battle of Bornh√∂ved in 798, the Obotrite allies of Charlemagne under Thrasco defeated the Nordalbingian Saxons, killing 2,800‚Äì4,000 of them. The last insurrection of the Engrian people occurred in 804, more than thirty years after Charlemagne's first campaign against them. This time, the most unruly tribe of them all, the Nordalbingians, found themselves effectively disempowered to rebel. Charlemagne deported 10,000 of them to Neustria and gave their now vacant lands to the loyal king of the Obotrites. Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, said on the closing of the conflict: > The war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding > to the terms offered by the King; which were renunciation of their national > religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of > the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one > people. Towards the end of the wars, Charlemagne had begun to place more emphasis on reconciliation. In 797, he eased the special laws, and in 802, Saxon common law was codified as the Lex Saxonum. This was accompanied by the establishment of ecclesiastic structures (including bishoprics in Paderborn, M√ºnster, Bremen, Minden, Verden and Osnabr√ºck) that secured the conversion of the Saxon people. The last Saxon uprising was the Stellinga, which occurred between 841 and 845. Religious nature Alluding to the Saxons, the contemporary poet of the Paderborn Epic praises terror as a means of conversion: \\"What the contrary mind and perverse soul refuse to do with persuasion, / Let them leap to accomplish when compelled by fear.\\"Mary Garrison, \\"The Emergence of Carolingian Latin Literature and the Court of Charlemagne (780‚Äì814),\\" Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation, ed. Rosamond McKitterick (Cambridge, 1994), 133.: Quod mens laeva vetat suadendo animusque sinister, / Hoc saltim cupiant implere timore coacti. One of Charlemagne's famed capitularies outlined part of the religious intent of his interactions with the Saxons. In 785, he issued the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae which asserted, \\"If any one of the race of the Saxons hereafter concealed among them shall have wished to hide himself unbaptized, and shall have scorned to come to baptism and shall have wished to remain a pagan, let him be punished by death.\\"Munro, Dana Carleton (Trans.)

Podil (–ü–û–î–Ü–õ). Encyclopedia of History of Ukraine. is a historic neighborhood in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. It is located on floodplain terrace over Dnieper between the Kyiv Hills and the lower stream of Pochaina River. Podil is one of the oldest neighborhoods of Kyiv, and the birthplace of the city's trade, commerce and industry. After the Mongol invasion of Rus' and destruction of Kyiv, it served as a city center until the 19th century.Old Podil (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–π –ü–æ–¥—ñ–ª). Seven Wonders of Ukraine. Here the city administration (magistrate) and the main university were located, and later the city's port and shipyard were established here. Podil contains many architectural and historical landmarks, and new archaeological sites are still being revealed. It is a part of the city's larger administrative Podilskyi District. History View of the Podil in the late 19th century. Kyiv Mohyla Academy fa√ßade The name ‚ÄúPodil‚Äù means something that is situated downwards. This area used to be the trading and crafting center of Kyiv. The names of some Podil neighborhoods reflect this fact: \\"Dehtyari\\" (those who work with tar), \\"Honchari\\" (potters), \\"Kozhemyaki\\" (craftsmen working with leather). On the territory of Podil ancient constructions were found. Some of them date back to the first half of the first millennium BC. It is first mentioned, however, in chronicles around 945. At times of Ancient Rus, Podil served as the main city's posad which was connected with the Upper city (Old Kyiv Hill) by Borychiv Descent. According to archaeological data, Podil appeared at the end of the 9th century. In 12-13th centuries its total area was reaching . Out of written sources it is known about \\"Stolpiye\\" (wooden fortifications) that protected Podil from northwest, Fairgrounds (later Zhytniy Fairgrounds, main city market), Church of Saint Elijah (the oldest Christian temple mentioned in 945), and Pyrohoshcha Church. Probably, the legendary churches of Turov and Novgorod also existed at Podil. The Soviet \\"Outline of Ancient History of the Ukrainian SSR\\" of 1957 () mentions that the Novgorod traders had own church in Kyiv.Praying House (–ë–û–ñ–ù–òÃÅ–¶–Ø). Ukrainian language dictionary. The Pochaina River served for the city's harbour. Podil has accumulated a cultural layer built up of 6 to 12 metres saturated with great abundance of artifacts of 9‚Äì18th centuries. Its uniqueness consists of the fact that in its lower strata due to high soil moisture are well preserved objects of organic matter such as wooden structures. There were researched residential and commercial buildings (predominantly above-ground blockhouses), craftsman shops, port warehouses, burial grounds, segments of streets. There were discovered remnants of five masonry temples of the 12th century. It was established that Podil had built-up manors with consistent courtyard limits. Each resident's manor that had area of consisted of 2-3 buildings. After the Mongol invasion of Rus' and destruction of Kyiv, Podil transformed into the main and the most populated part of the city. However, the area of Podil shrank, in 16-17th centuries its northwestern border served the Hlybochytsia River that used to drain into Pochaina (today Hlybochytsia in the underground collector). Upon obtaining its Magdeburg rights in the 15th century, in Kyiv was built a rathaus, later Kyiv magistrate. The center of Podil became the market square later known as Mahistratska and Konstraktova where stood a rathaus and the city's cathedral Pyrohoshcha Church. The first \\"hostynnyi dvir\\" (trading courtyard) is known as early as the mid 16th century. In the 15th century there was established the Convent of St Florus. In beginning of the 17th century, there was established Epiphany Monastery of the Kyiv Orthodox Brotherhood, which also later contained the Kyiv Mohyla Academy. Until mid of the 17th century at Podil existed Armenian community that had own Church of the Nativity of the Virgin. Also during the first half of the 17th century there were built two stone Catholic temples, the cathedral kosciol that was destroyed in the 1660s and its remnants found during archaeological excavations and a cathedral of the Dominican Monastery of St Nicholas that existed in 1400s-1649 and at end of the 17th century was turned to Orthodox cathedral of the Monastery of Sts Peter and Paul. In 1667 due to the Truce of Andrusovo, Kyiv was officially ceded to the Tsardom of Muscovy. Intensive building within Podil took place in the 17th century. An annual fair was conducted since 1797 to 1929 at the Kontraktova Square (Square of Contracts). Before building of the Contract House, the Kontraktova Square was known as Mahistratska Square.Old new Podil (–°—Ç–∞—Ä–∏–π –Ω–æ–≤–∏–π –ü–æ–¥—ñ–ª). Hmarochos Kyiv. The western part of the square was ending with the Pyrohoshcha Church that was mentioned in the 12th century epic poem The Tale of Igor's Campaign. Following traditions of medieval cities, in the 18th century in front of magistrate was built a rotunda along with fountain of Felicitas (Roman goddess) and later in 19th reattributed to Samson. The fountain became the first hydro-engineering structure at Podil. Not far form Kontraktova Square at Podil was located Zhytniy (Rye) Fairgrounds that existed at least since the 15th century and where was located the main Roman Catholic cathedral Kosciol of Virgin Mary. Before the Great Podil fire of 1811 it was the most populous neighborhood of the city with 2,068 houses out of 3,672 dwellings in all of Kyiv. The fire damaged the neighborhood extensively and changed the appearance of Podil dramatically. After the fire Podil was newly planned and a large number of new streets appeared on the project of Scottish architect William Heste and Russian architect Andrey Melensky, which still exist today. At this time such buildings as the Contract's House (1817), Hostynnyi Dvir the shopping arcade and other buildings were constructed. The Contracts House was built in 1817 where at its ground level were signed contracts and treaties, while the second floor hall hosting concerts. In 1835 the Kyiv magistrate was disassembled on bricks which were used for finishing the building of Hostynnyi Dvir and Contracts House, while in its place was created a small city park. In 1938 in the park was placed a British tank Mark V that was taken as a trophy during the Russian Civil War from the Russian White Guards. The tank also remained at park few years after the World War II. Later in 1977 in the park was built a monument of Hryhoriy Skovoroda. The Kyiv tramway was among the first in the Russian Empire. The tram commuting started at Podil among the first in Kyiv in 1896. It originally was connecting Kontraktova Square and Poshtova Square and later stretched to Kurenivka and then Pushcha-Vodytsia. Until World War II, the section just north of Nyzhniy Val street was called Ploska chast or Ploskaya sloboda. It was home to many poor Jews who lived there in wretched conditions.Instituta Yudaiki Ukrainy, Yehupets, Vol. 4 (1998), p. 265: \\"–ü–ª–æ—Å–∫–∞—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å ‚Äî –æ–¥–∏–Ω –∏–∑ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ü–µ–π—Å–∫–∏—Ö —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–∫–æ–≤ –ö–∏–µ–≤–∞ (–º–µ–∂–¥—É —É–ª. –ù–∏–∂–Ω–∏–π –í–∞–ª –∏ –ö—É—Ä–µ–Ω—ë–≤–∫–æ–π, —Ç–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –ü–æ–¥–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω), –≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –¥–æ–ø—É—Å–∫–∞–ª–æ—Å—å –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –µ–≤—Ä–µ–µ–≤, –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏–≤—à–∏—Ö—Å—è –≤ –ö–∏–µ–≤–µ.\\"Vladimir Meshchersky, –û—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ –Ω—ã–Ω—£—à–Ω–µ–π –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å—ñ–∏, Vol. 2 (–¢–∏–ø. –ú–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ö –¥—£–ª, 1870), p. 38.A.

It took its name from the mythological character Arcas, and in Greek mythology it was the home of the god Pan. In European Renaissance arts, Arcadia was celebrated as an unspoiled, harmonious wilderness; as such, it was referenced in popular culture. Modern Arcadia more or less overlaps with the ancient region, but is slightly larger. History Ancient Regions of Peloponnese with cities Arcadia was gradually linked in a loose confederation that included all the Arcadian towns and was named League of the Arcadians. In the 7th century BC, it successfully faced the threat of Sparta and the Arcadians managed to maintain their independence. They participated in the Persian Wars alongside other Greeks by sending forces to Thermopylae and Plataea. During the Peloponnesian War Arcadia allied with Sparta and Corinth. In the following years, during the period of the Hegemony of Thebes, the Theban general Epaminondas reinforced the Arcadian federation in order to form a rival pole to the neighboring Sparta. Then he founded Megalopolis, which became its new capital. Over the next centuries Arcadia weakened. It initially was subjugated by the Macedonians and later the Arcadians joined the Achaean League. Geography Mount Lykaion Geographically, ancient Arcadia occupied the highlands at the centre of the Peloponnese. To the north, it bordered Achaea along the ridge of high ground running from Mount Erymanthos to Mount Cyllene; most of Mount Aroania lay within Arcadia. To the east, it had borders with Argolis and Corinthia along the ridge of high ground running from Mount Cyllene round to Mount Oligyrtus and then south Mount Parthenius. To the south, the border Laconia and Messenia ran through the foothills of the Parnon and Taygetos mountain ranges, such that Arcadia contained all the headwaters of the Alpheios river, but none of the Eurotas river. To the south-west, the border with Messania ran along the tops of Mount Nomia, and Mount Elaeum, and from there the border with Elis ran along the valleys of the Erymanthos and Diagon rivers. Most of the region of Arcardia was mountainous, apart from the plains around Tegea and Megalopolis, and the valleys of the Alpheios and Ladon rivers. Arcadians The Arcadians were an ancient Greek tribe which was situated in the mountainous Peloponnese. It is considered one of the oldest Greek tribes which settled in Greece and it was probably a relative tribe of the proto-Greeks who are mentioned by the ancient authors as Pelasgians.Herodotus I, 56‚Äì57 Whilst Herodotus seems to have found the idea that the Arcadians were not Greek far-fetched, it is clear that the Arcadians were considered as the original inhabitants of the region.Herodotus VIII, 73 This is testified by ancient myths, like the myth of Arcas, the myth of Lycaon etc. Arcadia is also one of the regions described in the \\"catalogue of ships\\" in the Iliad.Homer, Iliad II, 603‚Äì611 Agamemnon himself gave Arcadia the ships for the Trojan war because Arcadia did not have a navy. Language Due to its remote, mountainous character, Arcadia seems to have been a cultural refuge. When, during the Greek Dark Age (c. 1200 BC ‚Äì 800 BC), Doric Greek dialects were introduced to the Peloponnese, the older language apparently survived in Arcadia, and formed part of the Arcado-Cypriot group of Greek dialects. Arcadocypriot never became a literary dialect, but it is known from inscriptions. Tsan is a letter of the Greek alphabet occurring only in Arcadia, shaped like Cyrillic –ò; it represents an affricate that developed from labiovelars in context where they became t in other dialects. Towns The Arcadians founded numerous towns. Of these the strongest were the cities which controlled the few fertile valleys; Mantinea, Tegea and Orchomenos. The remaining towns were more mountainous or had smaller plains. Some of these were Asea, Ypsounta, Teuthis, Heraea, Thyraion, Nestani, Alea, Lykosoura, Trikolonon, Tropea, Caphyae, Pallantion, Petrosaca, Feneos, Phoezon, etc. From 370 BC the capital of Arcadia became Megalopolis.

Military historian David Glantz claims the battle resulted from a Stavka order to the forces of the 2nd & 3rd Ukrainian Fronts to commence a coordinated invasion of Romania. It was directed towards Ia»ôi with a secondary objective of establishing bridgeheads across the Prut river.Glantz, Summer offensive 1944, pp.355-356 The battle was only briefly described by Soviet historians.

For example, the four volume Great Patriotic War (1998) prepared for the Russian Federation states: > Thus, during the T√¢rgu-Frumos operation, the 2nd Ukrainian Front's forces > tried unsuccessfully to complete a deep penetration of the enemy's defense > and reach the territory between the Prut & Siret Rivers.

There are however questions about the accounts by the two German officers, relating to the failure to include Romanian forces into their account. Prelude During April 1944 a series of offensives by the Red Army, including in the Ia≈üi sector, was intended to deceive OKH as to the real time and place of the major offensive planned in Belorussia. The German-Romanian forces successfully defended against the local limited objective attacks throughout the month of April. The attack aiming at T√¢rgu Frumos was the initial attempt by the Red Army to achieve its goal of deceiving the OKH, and testing the Axis defenses in Romania while preventing movement of reserves to the Belorussian sector of the Eastern Front.Glantz, Summer offensive 1944, pp.348-362 > It had been thought that May Day, the traditional workers' day of > celebration, would see the opening of a new assault by the Soviet forces. > But the offensive re-opened on 2 May heralding three shattering and > unceasing days and nights of combat. Behind a sixty-minute drum fire at > dawn, two Soviet armies moved into an attack.Lucas, James Germany's Elite > Panzer Force: Grossdeutschland (MacDonald And Jane's Publishers, Ltd., > London, 1978 ) The battle The battle of T√¢rgu Frumos was a series of engagements and smaller combats over several days during which armoured forces of the Wehrmacht LVII Panzer Corps, in particular of the Grossdeutschland Division and 24th Panzer Division, engaged the Red Army‚Äôs 16th Tank Corps of the 2nd Tank Army, which was also attacking from the north. One unit's experience in the opening hours of the battle was described as such: > (1st Battalion), P(an)z(er)Gr(enadier) R(e)g(imen)t G(ross)D(eutschland) and > its Romanian allies occupied a well wired-in and T-Mine-strewn line running > to the right of 3. SS-Pz.Div. \\"Totenkopf's\\" positions. The Soviets advanced > in great waves, their tanks and infantry mixed together. Moving much faster > than the Germans had anticipated, they overwhelmed...(the 1st Company), > wiping it out to the last man. While (the) temporary battalion > commander...attempted to halt and repulse the Soviets with what was left of > his battalion, the Romanians to the left of (the 2nd Company) cowered in > their trenches like \\"herrings\\", as (the) company commander...later > recounted. Indeed, the Romanians seemed to have reached an unofficial cease > fire with the enemy. That night the Luftwaffe succeeded in mounting an air > strike in the enemy rear area, to no avail. The next morning the Soviets > resumed their attack, preceding it with a bombardment of phosphorus shells. > Over 100 enemy tanks and assault guns advanced against (the 3rd Platoon). > With his Romanian artillery remaining inactive, (the 3rd Platoon of the 2nd > Company) could count only on the support of three...(assault guns) and the > four 15cm Nebelwerfer multiple rocket launchers of (the 10th Company, Panzer > Artillery Regiment Grossdeutschland). (The 2nd Company) was soon back to the > Nebelwerfer's position where it formed a 'hedgehog' defense...and a handful > of...men then managed to gain the temporary safety of the railway embankment > in their rear. His battalion scattered, (the 1st Battalion commander) sent > (the 2nd Company commander) with four SPW's to cover the wide open left > flank, completely vulnerable when the Romanians abandoned their positions. > Although the enemy had not made any deep penetrations, the tension of the > past two days had exhausted the Panzergrenadiers. \\"Suddenly...four T-34s > were in among the SPWs when, as if by magic, tanks and assault guns of the > SS-Division \\"Totenkopf\\" appeared.

The battle reduced Soviet tank strength to a point where a continued attack into Romania was not possible. In the three days of fighting, the Wehrmacht LVII Panzer Corps (mainly Grossdeutschland and 24th Panzer Division) and LII Army Corps defeated the Soviet force and claimed the destruction of over 350 Soviet tanks, ca. 100 of these claimed by 24th Panzer Division. During the battle, Hasso von Manteuffel, commander of the Grossdeutschland division, first encountered the new Soviet Stalin tank, \\"It was at T√¢rgu Frumos that I first met the Stalin tanks. It was a shock to find that, although my Tigers began to hit them at a range of 3,000 metres, our shells bounced off, and did not penetrate them until we had closed to half that distance. But I was able to counter the Russians' superiority by manoeuvre and mobility, in making the best use of ground cover.\\"Liddell Hart, Basil, The Other Side Of The Hill p 132 (Cassell and Company Ltd., London, 1948 ) Manteuffel also noted that the Stalin tanks had several \\"disadvantages: slow, not manoeuvrable enough; as well, in my opinion their crews were not sufficiently familiar with the tank.\\"Spaeter, p.324  Historiography  Soviet sources make few references to the battle. Historian David Glantz has found some mention of operations in Romania in April and May 1944 in divisional histories. The main source for him is the Soviet 2d Tank Army‚Äôs history, where a direct reference to the battle is found. It states that in late March 1944, the tank army was shifted into the sector of 27th Army with the mission of \\"attacking in the direction of Focuri and Podul-Iloaei. Subsequently, the army was to strike a blow toward the city of Yassy and secure it.\\" In the narrative on follow-on operations by the Tank Army it is stated that it attacked together with 27th Army‚Äôs 35th Rifle Corps. It also claims that the 3rd Tank Corps reached T√¢rgu Frumos, but was repulsed by the German counterattacks. The 16th Tank Corps identified by the German officers appears not to be mentioned in the account.Glantz, D. Slaughterhouse Despite German claims that the Soviet attack was a full-fledged offensive, it appears now that the battle of T√¢rgu Frumos was a relatively small-scale operation in the context of 1944's fighting on the Eastern Front, even though a Soviet success would have put the Red Army into a much stronger position for its eventual attack into Romania.Glantz, D. Slaughterhouse; Historians are thus left with the question of whether the Soviet offensive was a major effort to penetrate into Romania or simply a local assault to improve the Soviet operational posture and opportunities for a renewed offensive in the future. The Germans maintain it was the former. This author has argued that it was the latter and was also associated with deception planning for future operations in Belarus (to fix the future presence of 2nd Tank Army in Romania, while it was shortly moved elsewhere). Only further release of Soviet archival materials will settle this long-standing debate. Aftermath At the end of the Battle of T√¢rgu Frumos the frontline stabilised. However, it was from these positions that the Soviets launched the successful Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive in late August 1944. On a political level, the battle accelerated the activities of anti-German forces in Romania, leading to negotiations between the traditional political parties and the Romanian Communist Party, represented by Lucre»õiu PƒÉtrƒÉ»ôcanu.Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism for All Seasons: A Political History of Romanian Communism, University of California Press, Berkeley, 2003, p. 86.

Known by many as the \\"petit prince\\", the goofy-foot surfer often gained attention for charging the treacherous barrels at Teahupoo, Tahiti. He was credited in 2003 with the Billabong XXL Tube of the Year for riding one of the largest waves ever to be surfed in history.Global Surf News Joyeux was one of the Tahiti's best known professional surfers and was featured on the cover of Surfer Magazine's 2004 \\"Big Issue\\".Pro Surfer Malik Joyeux Dies at Pipeline Early life Joyeux was born in FranceMalik Joyeux obituary, Honolulu Star Bulletin, Wednesday, December 7, 2005 and moved to French Polynesia at a young age, where his mother H√©l√®ne raised her three children on the tropical island of Moorea.Honolulu Advertiser, Thursday, December 8, 2005 He started surfing at the age of 8.Tribute page by friend Tim McKenna For years his older brother Teiva, little sister Tylane and mother H√©l√®ne lived in a big hut near Haapiti on Moorea with no luxuries. It had no walls, just a wooden structure with a roof, surrounded by ferns and palm trees, and the ocean just meters away. Teiva managed to turn professional windsurfer and kite-surfer and moved to Hawaii to pursue his dream. Malik started to get some sponsorship deals as a surfer: just a few clothes, some boards and plane tickets. For the Tahitian surf community, he was like a little brother. Everybody would help him out as best they could and Malik would give a lot back. French surfer Didier Piter took him under his wing in the European Gotcha team and managed to finally finance his surf trips with an official contract. Death On Friday, December 2, 2005, Joyeux took off deep on an eight-foot wave at Oahu's Pipeline in Hawaii. It has been stated by witnesses that as Joyeux dropped into the wave the nose of his board sank into the face of the wave slowing his forward momentum but he quickly recovered, however the damage had been done. He tried to maneuver, but due to the loss of critical speed on this highly technical wave, he was struck by the lip of the wave and forced underwater. The force of the wave broke his board. Aamion Goodwin, who caught the next wave, commented that the leash of his board was completely intact, ripped off by the force of the wave. With his board no longer attached to his body, he was impossible to locate visually. Water photographers and other surfers searched for Joyeux, however difficulties and conditions hindered the search. He was found 15 minutes later at Pupukea beach break, off to the right of the peak at Pipeline, by surfer Myles Padaca. Padaca reached him and brought him to the beach with the help of several other surfers. Lifeguards and paramedics attempted to resuscitate him but failed to do so. An autopsy report revealed that he had likely hit his head on his surfboard, instantly rendering him unconscious.

UHW is a teaching hospital of Cardiff University School of Medicine. Construction started in 1963, with the official opening in 1971. It was Europe's first fully integrated hospital and medical school, at a cost of ¬£22 million. The hospital is the third largest University Hospital in the UK, and the largest hospital in Wales. The hospital was previously managed by Cardiff & Vale NHS Trust. In 2009 the Trust was dissolved and the hospital is now managed by Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. History = Construction = Planning for construction of the hospital first began in 1951. The land was provided by Cardiff Council who selected the site based on its accessibility from other parts of Wales as well as within Cardiff. The Welsh Board of Health and University Grants Committee outlined the criteria for an 820-bed hospital in 1953 and proposed a competition for architects to submit plans, although this was not sanctioned until 1958 due to \\"concerns over funding.\\" The competition was launched in April 1959 and judged by Sir Percy Thomas (Past President of the Royal Institute of British Architects), J.H. Forshaw (FRIBA), F.R.S. Yorke (FRIBA), A. Trevor Jones (Provost of the Welsh National School of Medicine), and A.R. Culley (medical member of the Welsh Board of Health). Forty entries were submitted and the winning design was by Stanley Wayman Milburn (1887-1961), an architect with a special interest in schools and hospitals and who had previously designed 10 hospitals in the north east of England. The architecture of the hospital is \\"dominated by long, parallel slabs, one eight-storied, the other five-storied. The Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales, completed in 1975, followed a similar design. Construction began in 1963 and the dental school opened to clinical students in 1965. Construction of the main hospital building began in 1966 and the topping out ceremony was conducted by G.R. Findlater on 4 July 1969, the eve of the 21st anniversary of the founding of the National Health Service. The hospital was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 19 November 1971. = Operation = The main building was found in 1978 to have deteriorated dangerously; ¬£1 million was spent on repairs. The Welsh Office revealed in 1981 that a further ¬£7.7 million was required for repairs. In 2005 a ¬£1 million project by Base Structures to construct a walkway joining separate parts of the hospital was completed. A ¬£16 million birthing centre was opened at the hospital in August 2009, featuring three birthing pools. The Midwife Led Unit handles around 90 births a month. A new delivery suite has also been built at the Women's Unit which was completed in February 2010. It includes 14 delivery rooms and two dedicated operating theatres. In early 2019, the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board announced plans to build a new hospital by 2030, as part of a wider reorganisation of hospital services, including the University Hospital at Llandough, Noah's Ark Children's Hospital, Cardiff Royal Infirmary, Barry Hospital and Whitchurch Hospital. In September 2020, the University Hospital of Wales became the major trauma centre for the South Wales region. Departments A MBB Bo 105 Helicopter landing at the University Hospital of Wales =Accident and Emergency unit= The Accident and Emergency unit is the third largest in the United Kingdom and treats on average 750 people every weekend in 2009. The unit was scheduled to have a ¬£3.4 million refit in 2013 but this has been rescheduled due to increased demand on the service and the disruption the work would cause. In July 2020 the \\"call before you walk\\" system was adopted. Less severely ill patients are to be directed to other services and those who need to be in A&E; will be given an appointment. An analysis of 515 patients who attended on 18 November 2019 found that 109 patients could have been given advice on how to treat themselves or been seen elsewhere. =Transplant unit= A ¬£4.27m transplant unit opened in August 2010. The unit had been planned over three years and is on the top floor of a new building that also houses a renal outpatients‚Äô department. It replaced a unit on ward B5 to increase availability of kidney transplants in Cardiff. UHW is Wales‚Äô only kidney transplant centre and caters for patients from South, Mid and West Wales. =Hospital radio= The University Hospital of Wales is home to Radio Glamorgan, founded in 1967. In March 2014, the station won three national awards at the National Hospital Broadcasting Association awards held in Bristol. Car Parking Parking facilities at the hospital are managed by Indigo Park Services UK Limited on a 15 year contract. It made a profit of ¬£2.8 million in 2016 from this contract, from charges and fines. 80 staff who have been fined are challenging the fines in court. A three-day trial in the small claims court ruled that staff had to pay ¬£128 for each parking ticket, and the costs of the hearing, which amounted to ¬£29,000. There were three lead cases and the result was binding on 72 others. The company cancelled parking charge notices issued up to the end of March 2016. There are more than 100,000 unpaid tickets outstanding. In popular culture University Hospital of Wales was the subject of the television series Hospital 24/7, a documentary drama from BBC One about patients and staff of the hospital. The first season was filmed in August 2008 and broadcast in January 2009. Two further seasons were broadcast in 2010 and 2011. Controversies =Breaches of the Human Tissue Act= In August 2009 postmortem examinations had to be stopped at the hospital following an inspection which revealed serious breaches of the Human Tissue Act 2004, including the unauthorized storage of human brains. =H1N1 virus= In November 2009 the first person-to-person transmission of Tamiflu- resistant H1N1 in the world was confirmed at the hospital. Five patients were infected, with three apparently having been infected in the hospital itself in a case of iatrogenic transmission. =Sterility of surgical instruments= In June 2010 surgery was discontinued temporarily after surgeons complained the instruments they had been given had not been sterilized properly and were visibly dirty.

In 1911, they merged with Sport-Club Westen 05 and changed their club colors from yellow and blue to black and white.  History  Through the early 1920s the club went through other mergers and played football in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg (I) as Union-SCC Charlottenburg ‚Äì through its association with FC Union Halensee (1898) ‚Äì with their best result coming in 1922 when they finished as vice-champions after losing a two-game final to Norden-Nordwest Berlin (2‚Äì4, 0‚Äì1). The club changed its name to SC Charlottenburg in 1927 and was relegated that same year. SCC returned to the Oberliga for a single season in 1928‚Äì29. Charlottenburg played lower-tier football throughout the 1930s and most of the 1940s. After World War II it was one of a number of sides that was part of a single association known as SG Charlottenburg representing the district. The combined side re-appeared in the top flight in the Oberliga Berlin in 1946, promptly capturing the division title. SG Charlottenburg soon began to break up into its original separate clubs and in 1949 SC Charlottenburg re-emerged to play third tier football. They were promoted to the Amateurliga Berlin in 1950 for a three-season turn before being relegated. In 1963, the same year that the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league, was formed, SCC made a single season appearance in the Amateurliga before slipping from sight into lower division play. Charlottenburg enjoyed a brief resurgence in the early 1980s, rising quickly through the Landesliga Berlin (IV) and the Amateur Oberliga Berlin (III) to play the 1983‚Äì84 season in the 2. Bundesliga. That campaign ended in the failure of an 18th-place finish and relegation. The team remained competitive, earning a second-place result in the Oberliga in 1985 and another title in 1986. SCC took part in the subsequent promotion round for 2. Bundesliga play, but finished behind FC St. Pauli and Rot-Weiss Essen, before crashing disastrously to a last-place finish the following season. The club competed in the third and fourth division through the balance of the 1980s and well on into the 1990s before finally slipping to the fifth tier Berlin-Liga and Landesliga Berlin. A runners-up finish in the latter in 2015 took the club back up to the Berlin-Liga but it was relegated back to the Landesliga in 2016.  Other activities  Today one of Berlin's largest sports clubs, SCC offers a wide variety of activities to its membership including American football (Berlin Rebels), baseball and softball, basketball, handball, ice hockey, field hockey, athletics, tennis, swimming, and volleyball. = Volleyball Bundesliga = Berlin Recycling Volleys was during several years the biggest rival of VfB Friedrichshafen. They won three German Championships; in 1993, 2003 and 2004, as well as three German Cups in 1994, 1996, and 2000. In the season 2004‚Äì05 lost of the SCC, nevertheless, in the semi-final unexpectedly against the new vice master evivo D√ºren and became, finally, only fourth. A year later the Berliners could protect the third place to themselves after a renewed half final defeat against evivo D√ºren. In 2007 they fail for the third time in the semi-final in evivo D√ºren, but in 2008 they became for the third time according to 2000 and 2002 vice masters. The cadre for the season 2008‚Äì09 exists of twelve players. Besides, there were in each case six departures and new players. The home matches take place in S√∂mmering-Hall with a capacity of 2,600. SCC Berlin changed their name to the \\"Berlin Recycling Volleys\\" in 2011.

Before 1998, this school was part of the East York Board of Education. It is the host school of the Talented Offerings for Programs in the Sciences (TOPS) program, a selective math, science and English enrichment program. History Overlea Secondary School, the third high school in the former East York, opened its doors in 1972 with 250 students as one of the first open concept schools in Canada. On September 4, 1973 it had 400 pupils and 42 staff. On October 16, 1987, Overlea S.S. was renamed 'Marc Garneau Collegiate Institute' after Canada's first astronaut Marc Garneau, who regularly visits the school and its students. It hosts the TOPS program and has offered pilot courses in Earth and Space Science, Science Journalism, and Cisco Networking. The school was built in the jurisdiction within North York as opposed to East York. It is the only high school in Canada dedicated to helping students with careers in the space sciences. Valley Park Middle School is the main school that feeds students into MGCI but there are other schools as well such as Cosburn Middle School. In 1993, MGCI was honoured with the Roberta Bondar Science and Technology Award in recognition of the school's achievements in numerous student programs, particularly its Students for the Exploration and Development of Space chapter, which no longer exists. Renovations to the school in 1998 removed many of the open concept elements of the school's original design. Despite declining enrolment across the Toronto District School Board, MGCI is one of the most densely populated secondary school institutions in the province of Ontario as of 2015, operating at around 131% capacity with a building that can hold 1323 students. High enrollment has resulted in around 12 portables occupying a large portion of the school's back field. . Overview =Student life= There are numerous extra curricular activities at Marc Garneau. Some of the clubs include chapters of DECA, MGCI EcoTeam, MGCI Muslim Student Association, Student Council, The Reckoner of MGCI, and the Key Club. The school has had several first and second-place finishes in the International DECA Competition. Garneau provides students with a wide variety of sports teams including: Football, Rugby, Basketball, Soccer, Volley Ball, Baseball, Field Hockey, Ultimate Frisbee, Cricket, Tennis, and an annual ball hockey tournament. The official mascot for the school is the cougar. Offered extracurricular activities include the Concert Band, Choir, Guitar Club, Music Council, Mock Trials, Reach for the Top, and Stage Band.

India saffron  The Flag of India (since 1947) is saffron, white and green Bhagwa Dhwaj, used as the flag of the Maratha Empire. Deep saffron approximates the colour of India saffron (also known as bhagwa or kesari). India saffron, representing courage and sacrifice, was chosen for one of the three bands of the National Flag of India, along with white (peace and truth) and what is now called India green (faith and chivalry). The Flag of India is officially described in the Flag Code of India as follows: > The colour of the top panel shall be India saffron (Kesari) and that of the > bottom panel shall be India green. The middle panel shall be white, bearing > at its centre the design of Ashoka Chakra in navy blue colour with 24 > equally spaced spokes. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, who later became India's first Vice President and second President, described the significance of the Indian National Flag as follows: In Rajasthani, this colour is called kay-ser-ia.

He was born in the Sivrialan village of the ≈ûarkƒ±≈üla district, in the province of Sivas. He was an ashik, poet, songwriter, and a baƒülama virtuoso, the prominent representative of the Anatolian ashik tradition in the 20th century. He was blind for most of his lifetime. His songs are usually sad tunes, often dealing with the inevitability of death. However, Veysel used a wide range of themes for his lyrics; based on morals, values, and constant questioning on issues such as love, care, beliefs, and how he saw the world as a blind man.  Biography  = Early life = Smallpox was prevalent throughout the Ottoman region that included Sivas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His mother G√ºlizar and his father Ahmet had already lost two daughters to smallpox before Veysel was born. When Veysel turned seven in 1901, another smallpox outbreak occurred in Sivas, and Veysel contracted the disease as well. He became blind in his left eye and a cataract developed in his right eye. After an accident, his right eye was blinded as well. His father gave his blind son a baƒülama and recited many folk poems to him. Poets of the region also started to drop by Ahmet ≈ûatƒ±roƒülu‚Äôs house as well with their friends. They played instruments and sang songs. Veysel used to listen to them carefully.  Veysel, the child baƒülama player  Veysel devoted himself wholeheartedly to playing baƒülama and singing. He was first instructed by his father's friend, √áamƒ±≈üƒ±hlƒ± Ali Aga (√Ç≈üƒ±k Al√¢), who taught him about the works of Pir Sultan Abdal, Karacaoƒülan, Dertli, R√ºhsati and other great Alevi poets and ashiks of Anatolia. = World War I and after = Veysel was 20 when the First World War started. All of his friends and his brother rushed to the front, but because of his blindness he was left alone with his baƒülama. After the war, he married a woman named Esma, who bore him a daughter and a son. The son died 10 days after birth. On 24 February 1921 Veysel's mother died, followed eighteen months later by his father. By then Esma had left him and their six-month-old daughter, running off with a servant from his brother's house. His daughter also died at a young age. = 1930s = He met Ahmet Kutsi Tecer, a literature teacher in Sivas High School, who along with his colleagues founded the Association For Preservation of Folk Poets in 1931. On 5 December 1931 they organized the Fest of Folk Poets, which lasted for three days. Veysel's meeting with Ahmet Kutsi Tecer thus marked a turning point in his life. Until 1933, Veysel played and sang the poems of master ozans. In the tenth anniversary of the Republic, upon the directives of Ahmet Kutsi Tecer, all folk poets wrote poems about the Republic and Mustafa Kemal. Veysel submitted a poem starting with the line \\"Atat√ºrk is the revival of Turkey...\\". This poem came into daylight only after Veysel left his village. Ali Rƒ±za Bey, the mayor of Aƒücakƒ±≈üla to which Sivrialan was then affiliated, had much appreciation for Veysel's poem and wanted to send it to Ankara. Veysel said he would like to go to visit the nation's leader, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, and traveled to Ankara on foot with his faithful friend ƒ∞brahim under tough winter conditions. They arrived in Ankara three months later. Veysel resided with his hospitable friends for forty five days in Ankara. Sadly, he was unable to present his poem to Atat√ºrk. His mother G√ºlizar said that \\"He felt bitter regret for two things in life: first not having been able to visit the great leader, and second, not being able to join the army‚Ä¶\\". However, his poem was printed in a printing house named Hakimiyeti Milliye in Ulus, and was published in the newspaper for three days. Then, he started to travel around the country to perform his poems. Veysel said the following about this time in his life: = Teacher of the Village Institutes = Upon the establishment of the Village Institutes, an initiative from Ahmet Kutsi Tecer, √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel worked as a baƒülama teacher in the Village Institutes of Arifiye, Hasanoƒülan, √áifteler, Kastamonu, Yƒ±ldƒ±zeli and Akpƒ±nar. In these schools, many intellectuals who later scorned Turkey's culture were able to meet the artist and improve their poetic sensibilities. = Later life and legacy = In 1965, the Turkish Grand National Assembly resolved upon allocating a monthly salary in 500 TL to √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel in return for ‚Äúhis contribution to our native language and national solidarity.‚Äù On 21 March 1973 at 3:30 am, Veysel died in Sivrialan, the village he was born in, in a house that now serves as a museum. In 2000, a compilation album of √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel's songs named √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel Klasikleri was released. In 2008, Joe Satriani's album Professor Satchafunkilus and the Musterion of Rock featured two songs called √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel and Andalusia, which were dedicated to √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel. In the same year, a remixed version of √Ç≈üƒ±k Veysel's song Uzun ƒ∞nce Bir Yoldayƒ±m was featured as the main theme in a Turkish film series, Gece G√ºnd√ºz.  Uzun ƒ∞nce Bir Yoldayƒ±m (lyrics)  \\"Uzun ƒ∞nce Bir Yoldayƒ±m\\", translated to English: \\"I Walk On A Long And Narrow Road\\" is one of Veysel's best known works and is still popular among fans of Turkish folk music. { width=\\"75%\\"  Turkish Lyrics Uzun ince bir yoldayƒ±m, Gidiyorum g√ºnd√ºz gece, Bilmiyorum ne haldeyim, Gidiyorum g√ºnd√ºz gece.

Castle Market was an indoor market in Sheffield city centre, England. The building lay in the north east of the present city centre, by the River Don, and was built on top of the remains of Sheffield Castle, which could still be seen via guided tours. The market closed in 2013 when the Moor Market opened on The Moor, further south in Sheffield city centre, and demolition began in 2015. Description The oldest part of the building was the Fish and Vegetable Market, constructed in the inter-war period. The remainder of the building was constructed by J. Stuart Mackie and Andrew Derbyshire under the auspices of J. L. Womersley between 1960 and 1965. It had two main floors, both of which included small shops and stalls, and each accessible from street level. Other stores faced on to the surrounding streets, while a gallery found a storey above the main part of the market contained several more shops, and access to an office building surmounting the structure. The gallery was linked by bridges across Exchange Street to further above-ground shopping areas. Replacement and site redevelopment The whole Castle markets area has been the subject of redevelopment proposals since the 1980s, with part of the adjacent area being redeveloped with a hotel, multi-storey car park and several new office blocks in a development known as \\"The Square\\" by Carillion. The original scheme to replace the markets fell victim to the 1990s recession. A new markets building opened on The Moor in 2013, which is a partnership between the council and private developers. The multi-storey car park for the Moor Market scheme has been built on Eyre Street. Part of the council's current plans for the Castle Market was to demolish the existing complex and open up a pedestrian route from the city centre to the Victoria Docks area and the new Riverside Quarter, now that the ring road has been diverted.

The facility is served by buses operating across the Sheffield region, as well as National Express coaches that connect Sheffield with many destinations across the United Kingdom. At the northern end of the Interchange is Castle Square tram stop, which serves all four Sheffield Supertram routes. A short distance away via a signposted covered walkway is Sheffield railway station, providing train services to locations across the country. The majority of services use the Central Bus Station (CBS) site. However, the Interchange also includes two other sites, on Flat Street and Arundel Gate. Both of these are adjacent to and within walking distance of the main CBS site. Directly next to CBS is the Archway Centre, which contains information centres, ticket kiosks, toilets (20p charge), and a WHSmith store, amongst others. History It was opened in 1936, as Pond Street bus station. Covered accommodation was built in 1956, replacing the collection of bus stops. From 8 October 1960, it ceased to share its accommodation with the Sheffield Tramway. Work began on the reconstruction of the bus station in the early 1990s, and it was renamed Sheffield Interchange. A large section of the Interchange was demolished in the early 2000s, owing to under-use; this was subsequently redeveloped, and the area is now home to the Digital Campus. Present As well as containing around 30 bus stops, it also has an information desk, National Express ticket office, public toilets and a WHSmith store within the Archway Centre (the main building). There is also a coach passenger waiting area and a cafe next to the coach stands. The Interchange is integrated with the railway station by way of a signposted covered walkway between the two; it is a short walk from the city centre and the nearest Supertram stop (Fitzalan Square/Ponds Forge). Services =Coach services= Sheffield Interchange also has several dedicated coach stands (E1 to E6) which are used by services beginning and terminating at the interchange, as well as several others which are passing through. Stand E1 is the primary pick up/drop off point and this is where the National Express office is located. This should not be confused with the Ticket Office, which is located in the Archway Centre. Sheffield Interchange is also served by a limited number of Stagecoach Express coach routes, as well as other lesser known coach operators.

They recorded fourteen albums and performed in Latin America, the Caribbean and United States. Band members included Tony Croatto, Silverio P√©rez, Josy LaTorre, Irvin Garc√≠a, Nano Cabrera, Ivan Gonzalez, Jorge Arce, Jos√© Vega Santana, Moncho Diaz, Jose ‚ÄòPache‚Äô Cruz and many others. Haciendo Punto‚Äôs repertoire has been sung by generations and it has become part of the Puerto Rican folklore.Biograf√≠a en Fundaci√≥n Nacional para la Cultura Popular Haciendo Punto‚Äôs contribution was the dissemination of other performers' music from the Caribbean and Latin America as well as their own Puerto Rican culture. Band history The original quintet recorded the first two albums. Tony and Nano departed the group to form their own band which focuses on folklore and not \\"Nueva Trova\\". The third album was a huge success. Since the fourth album, Silverio Perez was the only member left from the original group. Bassist and producer Ivan Gonzalez Aulet lead the group from the fourth to the ninth album, \\"Punto Final\\" (March, 1986). Tony, Silverio, Josy and Irvin recorded additional albums after the tenth, el Concierto Original (2000). First album Haciendo Punto's eponymous album has reached classic status in Puerto Rico. All of its songs (except \\"R√≠e y Bosteza\\", written by Cuban singer Silvio Rodr√≠guez) either were radio hits or have become cultural references in Puerto Rico. The album features the following: *\\"En la vida todo es ir\\", a poem written by Juan Antonio Corretjer, set to music by the group. It has since been versioned by various Spanish language interpreters, including Joan Manuel Serrat, Fiel a la Vega and others *\\"Verde Luz\\", a song written by Antonio Caban Vale which has become a virtual second national anthem for Puerto Rico *\\"Ensillando mi caballo\\", a set of d√©cimas written by P√©rez, at the suggestion of Corretjer, using a popular South American verse as the \\"pie forzado\\" (basis) of the song (it became the subject of a copyright dispute in 2006, when Perez discovered that his copyright had been granted to Corretjer by mistake and Corretjer's heirs could not allow him use of the song because of legal restrictions by the publishing agency, ACEMLA), *\\"La vida campesina\\", a cover of a Pafu song with the same name. It was a popular medley of Puerto Rican jibaro songs which was Haciendo Punto's first radio hit, *\\"M√∫sica\\", an ode to music that became Haciendo Punto's second radio hit, *\\"Ag√ºeyban√°\\", a homage to the Puerto Rican indigenous chief, curiously written by German-born Puerto Rican actor Axel Anderson, *\\"Mujer de 26 a√±os\\", a song about a disillusioned society girl who bitterly matures into a marriage of convenience, written by Jos√© Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, the brother of former Puerto Rican governor Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n, and *\\"Los caminos\\", a rumba sung by Garc√≠a and written by Cuban songwriter Pablo Milan√©s. The album also features two parody songs, \\"Bolero de Mastropiero\\" (or merely \\"Bolero\\"), originally written by the Argentine musical comedy group Les Luthiers, and \\"Tango (di Vestimenta Interiore)\\", a parody of the Peruvian song \\"El Rosario de Mi Madre\\" in which Tony Croatto asks a former lover to give him back a particular piece of underwear.

The station began as a \\"very low power broadcast station\\", known as Radio UPEI and operated from the top floor of the administrative building in 1970. The transmitters were home-made and of solid state design. In 1972, the UPEI Student Union funded upgrades to a carrier current system operating on 700 kHz using the callsign CSUR. This conflicted with international callsign allocations (the ITU prefix CS is assigned to Portugal, not Canada), so a new application was made for the callsign CIMN (Campus Information Music & News). A series of transmitters, using the electrical wiring of buildings as the antenna system, were located in the various residences. A set of control rooms and production studios located on the 4th floor of Main Building remained in operation for a number of years. At that time, the station had a station manager, and a news director, paid by the Student Union. The station also began to simulcast audio via the local cable television system into homes in the area. In 1982, the studios were moved to the Barn, which housed student union offices and student activity areas on campus. The station received a full FM license in 1995 to broadcast at 90.3 FM,Decision CRTC 95-298 and at this point, legal problems began. CIMN became the first Canadian station without a full-time staff person to be granted a broadcast licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). The licence expired in August 2000 and was not renewed.

Overview In the previous book, Hangfire, it was related that the Skinks (an alien race thus far mostly unknown to the Human Confederation) have invaded the planet Kingdom. The planetary government reluctantly requests Confederation assistance, but thanks to miscommunications and pure bureaucratic bungling, the Marines of 34th FIST are deployed thinking that they are on their way to put down a peasant rebellion. Kingdom's government are very religious and make it harder for the 34th FIST to fight the Skinks. Kingdom's army is poorly equipped and poorly trained to fight the Skinks. So the Skinks catch the 34th FIST by surprise. Only one platoon of the unit has encountered the Skinks before, in Blood Contact, and had been forbidden to talk about their experiences, or even reveal the existence of these aliens. Even worse than this surprise is a new devastating weapon in use by the Skinks. The Rail Gun, a weapon that makes it impractical for the Marines to use aircraft or armored vehicles in close combat. To make matters worse for Company L, their commander is unexpectedly summoned back to Earth. In this book, the casualty rate is very high for the 34th, even worse than they had experienced in Steel Gauntlet. Sherman and Cragg have been very careful so far in the series not to kill off important characters, but break this rule in Kingdom's Swords.

He has undertaken in Colombia, his adopted country, several studies of rural economy, sociology and history. He also has been teaching at university subjects related to these topics to students in economics, rural development and forestry. One of the research works he has completed in the Santander department, concerns a traditional cottage industry which was then about to fall in disuse. It relates the history of cotton growing and textile production. It gives an overview of the agronomic, economic and social aspects of this activity and describes the traditional techniques of spinning and weaving. It all started while undertaken field work on another investigation (traditional production of sugar cane and brown sugar), he accidentally met three old ladies that were processing cotton fibre by ancient techniques. The results of this research were published in three places (two editions of \\" Vida y muerte del algod√≥n y los textiles santandereanos \\", Universidad Javeriana, 1981, new and revised edition, editorial Ecoe, 1989; \\" Historia del algod√≥n en Santander \\", Banco de la Rep√∫blica, 1990).

Later on, a German NGO known in Colombia as \\"Pan para el Mundo\\" took over this endeavour. This organization accompanied for several years efforts to improve the quality and diversity of homemade cotton products.

This is the second Starfist book taking place largely on the planet called Kingdom, a world with a crazy-quilt religious theocracy involving various flavors of Christians, Muslims, and others. This book continues where Kingdom's Swords left off. Plot summary 34th FIST has been reinforced by the 26th FIST, now that the Confederation is aware that this is a full scale Skink invasion. With the reinforcements, the Marines are now able to go off the defensive and take the battle to the Skinks. The Skinks have been using a devastating weapon never before seen by the Confederation armed forces, but in this book the Navy figures out what the weapon is, a Rail Gun. There doesn't appear to be a true defense, but at least there is now a warning when it is about to be used. The Fist Marines launch a major operation where the Skinks have made a stronghold in the swamps on Kingdom. Meanwhile, Skink Battle Cruisers are on their way to Kingdom. Having been pushed back from their swamp on Kingdom the Skinks launch a diversion cover their retreat to the Skink fleet. Up to this point in the Starfist series there have been no portrayals of space Naval battles, but this omission is now rectified. The Marines and Confederation Navy drive the Skinks off world and push them back to the planet \\"Quagmire\\" where they used its natives as slaves and used the planet as a staging area to invade Kingdom. The 26th and 34th Fist Marines then go to Quagmire and Kill most of the Skinks there, with the help of the Natives. Also, Marine General Aguinaldo is promoted to come up with an Anti Skink task force. He has the entire military at his disposal. There is also a subplot involving the government of Kingdom, as one of the more powerful figures among the Kingdomites takes advantage of the distraction caused by the extensive combat to overthrow the theocracy and establish a fascist-style government. 2003 American novels American science fiction novels 2003 science fiction novels StarFist series Del Rey books ","title":"Kingdom's Fury"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},H={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",H,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",I]]),N=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/36.md","filePath":"sponsor/36.md"}'),D={name:"sponsor/36.md"},E=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{N as __pageData,E as default};
