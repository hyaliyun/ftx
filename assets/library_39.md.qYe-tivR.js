It is an M4 carbine utilizing a short-stroke gas piston system. REC7 is available in either 5.56×45mm NATO or 6.8mm Remington SPC. The REC7 is Barrett’s second AR-pattern rifle chambered for the 6.8mm Remington SPC cartridge, the first being the Barrett M468 rifle. The 6.8 SPC-chambered M468 rifle employed the same direct gas-impingement system as the M4. Design and features Unlike possible replacements for the M16/M4 such as the now canceled XM8, the REC7 is not an entirely new rifle, instead it is made up of an upper receiver that is attached to a M16/M4 lower receiver and is compatible with many accessories intended for the M16/M4 family. It can also be mated to M16/M4 lower receivers currently in the possession of the US military. The rifle uses a short-stroke gas piston mechanism, unlike the M16 or M4 which use direct impingement. In addition, the REC7 uses the new 6.8mm Remington SPC (6.8×43mm) cartridge, a round that is of roughly equivalent length to 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition, so it is compatible with a standard-size lower receiver currently in use by the United States military. The REC7 uses a short-stroke gas piston designed by Barrett. It rides above the barrel and is housed inside the fore-end. The spring-loaded piston is a one-piece 17-4 stainless steel rod. The forward and rearward movement of the piston is approximately one inch. Like many AR-15 type rifles, such as the M16/M4, the barrel is threaded to allow muzzle attachments such as a suppressor. The REC7 employs a free-floating Daniel Defense rail system, which allows many military accessories such as a bipod, night vision devices, and combat optics to be placed on the rifle. The REC7 features forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers that are hard-coat anodized a deep black. The lower receiver has a single-stage trigger, a Magpul enhanced trigger guard for firing with gloves, and a beveled magazine well for rapid magazine changes. The upper receiver is flat-top with a Picatinny rail. The barrel is chrome-lined and is fitted with a M16A2 flash suppressor, a six-position Magpul MOE butt stock and pistol grip. The REC7 outfitted in a shortened barrel PDW configuration was one of the weapons displayed to U.S. Army officials during an invitation-only Industry Day on November 13, 2008. The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 carbine. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high- strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring- free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

Origin, development, and use The components of what would become the Mountain ration were developed in 1941-42 by U.S. Army officers in experimental mountain warfare companies, largely consisting of former ski instructors, forest rangers, and other experienced alpine travelers. Based on their recommendations, the Mountain ration was finalized and packaged for use by mountain and alpine troops by personnel at the Quartermaster Corps' Subsistence Research Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. In order to make the rations suitable for high-altitude climates, the Mountain ration was designed as a specialized compact ration that was easier to prepare in high-altitude environments, have adequate roughage, and enough bulk and quantity when heated to satisfy four men in one day at high altitude, weigh less than , and contain a total of per man per day. The ration was formally adopted in November 1942.Koehler, Franz A., Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - A Historical Background, QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958) The Mountain ration was produced from 1942 to 1943, and issued to soldiers of several elite U.S. and British Commonwealth forces then in training for alpine or winter combat, especially the 10th Mountain Division, and the First Special Service Force. As packaged, the Mountain ration was sized to serve four men for one day (three meals per man). It was normally prepared at the platoon or squad level, though 10th Division troopers were also taught to prepare it individually.Earle, George F. (Capt), History of the 87th Mountain Infantry in Italy, p. 6 http://www.10thmtndivdesc.org/87th%20History.pdf The 1st Special Service Force first tried out the Mountain ration on November 28, 1942 during a training patrol to MacDonald Pass, Montana: > \\"At 1400 hours all company commanders and one other officer from each > company and a few others left by truck for MacDonald Pass to try living > under winter conditions and try a new mountain ration ... On arrival at the > selected spot the party broke up into groups of four and built shelters and > fires of many different types.

(1958): The Quartermaster Corps was not pleased that combat officers went outside the Army chain of command for ration specifications: \\"In the history of rations, it was nowhere better demonstrated than in small-group rations that there should be clear-cut lines of central authority for evaluation of needs before ration development was begun ... This was evident during the early days of World War II when three small-group rations made an almost simultaneous debut because diversified groups sought special rations for unusual but not clearly defined military purposes.\\" by the Quartermaster Command, headed by Quartermaster General Edmund B. Gregory, whose organization had to procure, store, and ship it.Kearny, Cresson H., Jungle Snafus ... And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), p. 291 To bolster their argument, Quartermaster Corps and Subsistence Branch staff heavily criticized the Mountain ration for its weight, although for its caloric content a day's ration was lighter than alternative canned C rations, and it had nearly more than the K ration. The Mountain ration was also criticized for its involved preparation times; the Mountain ration required heating, which was difficult to accomplish for ordinary infantry soldiers without individual or squad-level cooking stoves, though this did not affect mountain troops such as the 10th Mountain Division, who had such equipment. In common with the alpine troops of other countries, the 10th's officers recognized the distinct benefits of heated, easily digested foods at high altitudes. However, the noise and bulk of heating equipment and additional cooking utensils was disliked by some 10th Mountain troopers, who viewed the mountain ration as better suited to bivouac areas or mountain strongholds not subject to sudden enemy assault.Imbrie, John and Evans, Hugh M., Good Times and Bad Times: a History of C Company, 85th Mountain Infantry Regiment, Tenth Mountain Division, Interview of Charles Page Smith, Vermont: Vermont Heritage Press (1995) http://www.smithtrust.com/htmlpages/Goodtimes.html Significantly, diagnosed cases of malnourishment and vitamin deficiency, which had been reported among other light infantry units of the U.S. Army in the ETO who had been forced to consume the K ration for extended periods of time, did not arise among troops of the 10th Mountain Division, who received a wider variety of food rations including the Mountain ration, K ration, C ration, and 10-in-1 group ration while in the field.Field Survey, Essential Technical Medical Data, North African Theater of Operations, U.S. Army for December 1943, 27 January 1944, Appendix V: A survey of troops in the forward areas and evacuation hospitals of the Fifth U.S. Army serving in the Italian campaign noted that almost all soldiers questioned in infantry, engineer, and other mobile forward units said they had lost weight since the beginning of the Italian campaign. Surgeons commented upon a noticeable decrease in body fat and wasting of muscle, requiring copious feeding and rest, as well as ascorbic acid deficiency. By early 1943, less than three months after adoption, the Quartermaster Corps' Food Services Branch was already requesting the Army to abolish all non- standard lightweight individual rations except for the K and D rations.Koehler, Franz A., Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - A Historical Background, QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958) To the immense relief of the Quartermaster Corps's Food Services branch, the Mountain ration was discontinued and production terminated in 1943,U. S. Army Quartermaster Museum, Army Operational Rations - Historical Background, Article : While specifications were not declared obsolete until 1948, the Mountain and Jungle rations were in reality ended with the termination of production in 1943. though supplies continued to be issued well into 1944. The 10th Mountain Division, which was issued the ration while in training, did not deploy to combat until January 1945; in the last months of the war, with supplies of the Mountain ration exhausted, most of the 10th's troopers serving in combat were issued the K ration, the C ration, or the 10-in-1 ration. At war's end, after the shortcomings of the C ration (monotony and weight) and the K ration (malnourishment and vitamin deficiency) had become apparent,Field Survey, Essential Technical Medical Data, North African Theater of Operations, U.S. Army for December 1943, 27 January 1944, Appendix V the Quartermaster Corps attempted to shift responsibility for individual ration inadequacies. Contravening their earlier statements, the QC now asserted that overuse of the K and C rations (beyond two or three days) had caused the problem.U. S. Army Quartermaster Museum, Army Operational Rations - Historical Background,Article : At its introduction, the QMC stated that the lightweight K ration was intended for \\"infrequent use\\", \\"for not more than 15 consecutive meals\\". After the war, in light of K ration malnourishment reports, the QMC had shortened that period even more - \\"for a period of two or three days only.\\"Longino, James C. (Col.), Rations in Review, The Quartermaster Review, May–June 1946: In 1946, Col. Longino noted that the early 'C' wartime ration was designed for only three days' continuous use, while a new Type 'E' (revised Type 'C') ration was in then process of production with a continuous consumption limit of twenty-one days. This ration plan was deemed adequate by the QC in spite of the fact that many U.S. troops in frontline combat operations during WWII had existed by necessity on continuous or near-continuous consumption of 'C' or 'K' rations for periods of up to four months. Having successfully obtained the discontinuance of suitable alternative packaged rations, the QMC's Historical Summary report was conspicuously silent on how Army commanders could have observed this new ration restriction for troops in daily contact with a determined enemy.Pogue, Forrest C., Pogue's War: Diaries of a WWII Combat Historian, University Press of Kentucky (2001), , , p. 117Ruth, William B., Roetgen, Germany and the Siegfried Line, 3rd Armored Division History, 12 September 1944 - 16 December 1944: Field kitchens serving 'A' or 'B' rations, even when located on reverse slopes or behind masking terrain, were a favorite target for German artillery observers, who waited for the men to queue in lines before calling down a barrage of shellfire. Surprisingly, even with this new admission, the QC still refused to abandon their prior recommendation for standardization on a single type of canned wet individual ration, a recommendation that was eventually adopted.U. S. Army Quartermaster Museum, Army Operational Rations - Historical Background At war's end, rather than introduce a new and improved lightweight ration designed for prolonged use, the K ration was itself promptly discontinued (along with the 10-in-1 small group ration, which had proven somewhat useful in boosting nourishment levels for men living for extended periods on C or K rations). Instead, the C ration, still designated for \\"infrequent use\\", went through a series of largely unsuccessful minor revisions.

It tells the story of a young Australian boy who is determined to buy a bicycle for four pounds. Along the way he gets into many misadventures. It was based on the 1945 novel of the same name by Moore Raymond who also co-wrote the film with Anthony Kimmins. Their screenplay received a Best British Screenplay nomination at the BAFTA awards.http://awards.bafta.org/award/1957/film Plot Smiley (Colin Petersen) is a mischievous boy who lives in the small country town of Murrumbilla (based on Augathella). His father is an alcoholic drover who is a poor provider for the family, his mother works as a laundress to make ends meet. Smiley is always getting into trouble with his best friend Joey (Bruce Archer). He decides to try to save up enough money to buy a coveted bicycle. Smiley takes on various odd jobs, showing enterprise, hard work, and persistence in slowly accumulating the considerable sum (four pound) needed, despite getting involved in a number of pranks, including getting into trouble with the local law enforcement in the figure of Sergeant Flaxman (Chips Rafferty). Smiley unwittingly helps the local publican, Jim Rankin (John McCallum), sell opium to aborigines who live in a camp near the town. Smiley's father steals his savings and loses it playing two-up. Smiley accidentally knocks him out and runs away to the bush, where he is bitten by a snake. His life is saved by a boundary rider, Bill McVitty (Guy Doleman). Rankin is arrested and the townspeople chip in to buy Smiley a bike.

The book was hailed as an Australian Huckleberry Finn and film rights were bought immediately by Sir Alexander Korda. Korda sent Raymond to Australia in 1946 to find a possible child actors and locations over three months. However Korda said he could not find an appropriate director and shelved the project. Korda eventually assigned the project to Anthony Kimmins, who had served in Australia in World War II. Kimmins arrived in Australia in March 1950 to begin preproduction and announced he would make the film near Augathella for £100,000. However, after actually inspecting the site he doubted it would be useful and he was unable to find a lead actor he was happy with. Plans to make the movie were delayed again. Kimmins returned to Australia September 1955 to begin preproduction. After interviewing over 2,000 boys, he cast Colin Peterson as Smiley and Bruce Archer as Joey. Part of the budget was provided by 20th Century Fox, who had money frozen in Australia due to currency restrictions. Apart from Ralph Richardson, the entire cast was Australian. Filming started in late October, with the township of Murrumbilla being created on an estate at Camden Park and Gundy NSW, and finished eight weeks later. Post production work was done at Pagewood Studios. Release The film was very popular and led to a sequel, Smiley Gets a Gun. It also spawned a hit single, 'A Little Boy Called Smiley', composed after the film was completed by Clyde Collins. Colin Petersen moved to Britain and enjoyed a successful career as a child actor and musician.

Owned by the Kentucky Authority for Educational Television, the station is operated as part of the statewide Kentucky Educational Television (KET) network. WCVN-TV's transmitter is located near Winston Park in Kenton County. It is one of three PBS member stations serving the Cincinnati market, alongside WCET/Cincinnati and WPTO/Oxford, a unit of WPTD/Dayton. History WCVN-TV came to the air on September 8, 1969, becoming the 12th KET station to sign on and the 13th educational television station to broadcast within the State of Kentucky. Beforehand, the northernmost areas of the state of Kentucky had been receiving an educational television signal from WCET Cincinnati for 15 years. It signed on in July 1954, together with WMUB-TV (now WPTO) of Oxford, Ohio. After WCVN began broadcasting, the Cincinnati metropolitan area had three choices for educational programming courtesy of PBS, although WPTO did not have a presence on the Kentucky-side of the river until their digital FCC-mandated signal upgrade 2009 digital television transition. All three were members of the National Educational Television (NET) network before joining PBS in October 1970. In the Cincinnati market, KET often competes with WCET and WPTO, but KET, through WCVN, does have viewership in the Cincinnati metro area, including a few contributors to KET's Fund for Excellence. WCVN was one of three satellites slated to be part of the network, but signed on later than the ten other charter satellites; the other two were WKMU/Murray and WKMJ- TV/Louisville, which signed on in October 1968 and September 1970, respectively. In the Kentucky side of the Cincinnati market, however, before WCVN's inaugural sign-on, WKON/Owenton was the default KET satellite in the northern Kentucky area for more than eleven months after KET's ten charter stations signed on. Digital television The station's digital television companion signal, WCVN-DT, along with the digital companions of thirteen other KET stations (except WKPC and WKMJ), signed on the air in May 2002. =Analog-to-digital conversion= In compliance with the 2009 digital television transition, WCVN-TV shut down its analog signal, UHF channel 54. Although the mandatory deadline was June 12, 2009, the analog signal was shut down on April 16. The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 17. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 54, which was among the high-band UHF channels (channels 52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. =Spectrum incentive auction results= WCVN holds a construction permit to move its digital signal to UHF channel 22 as part of the network's participation in the 2016–17 FCC Spectrum incentive auction. WCVN must relocate its digital signal to its new allocation no later than the time between September 7, 2019, and October 18, 2019. As of October 18, 2019. Coverage area =Signal coverage= WCVN's signal covers Kentucky's northernmost counties, along with south-western Ohio and southeastern Indiana. It can reach from Germantown, Ohio in the north to northern Harrison County, Kentucky in the south and from Vevay and Brookville, Indiana in the west to rural central Brown County, Ohio and Bracken County, Kentucky in the east. The signal does cover some of the same areas as that of WKON from Burlington to near Owenton, Kentucky. The WCVN signal also covers portions of the small coverage area of low-powered translator W20CT-D of Augusta, which repeats the broadcast signal of Morehead-licensed WKMR. =Cable and satellite availability= KET's statewide cable coverage includes Charter Spectrum (formerly Time Warner Cable) systems in northern Kentucky.

It was directed by Richard Lester and written by George MacDonald Fraser. It was originally proposed in the 1960s as a vehicle for The Beatles, whom Lester had directed in two other films. The film adheres closely to the novel, and also injects a fair amount of humor. It was shot by David Watkin, with an eye for period detail. The fight scenes were choreographed by master swordsman William Hobbs. Plot Having learned swordsmanship from his father, the young country bumpkin d'Artagnan arrives in Paris with dreams of becoming a king's musketeer. Unaccustomed to the city life, he makes a number of clumsy faux pas. First he finds himself insulted, knocked out and robbed by the Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, and once in Paris comes into conflict with three musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, each of whom challenges him to a duel for some accidental insult or embarrassment. As the first of these duels is about to begin, Jussac arrives with five additional swordsmen of Cardinal Richelieu's guards. D'Artagnan sides with the musketeers in the ensuing street fight and becomes their ally in opposition to the Cardinal, who wishes to increase his already considerable power over the king, Louis XIII. D'Artagnan also begins an affair with his landlord's wife, Constance Bonacieux, who is dressmaker to the Queen, Anne of Austria. Meanwhile, the Duke of Buckingham, former lover of the Queen, turns up and asks for something in remembrance of her; she gives him a necklace with twelve settings of diamonds, a gift from her husband. From the Queen's treacherous lady-in-waiting, the Cardinal learns of the rendezvous and suggests to the none-too-bright King to throw a ball in his wife's honor, and request she wear the diamonds he gave her. The Cardinal also sends his agent Milady de Winter to England, who seduces the Duke and steals two of the necklace's diamonds. Meanwhile, the Queen has confided her troubles in Constance, who asks d'Artagnan to ride to England and get back the diamonds. D'Artagnan and the three musketeers set out, but on the way the Cardinal's men attack them. Only d'Artagnan and his servant make it through to Buckingham, where they discover the loss of two of the diamond settings. The Duke replaces the two settings, and d'Artagnan races back to Paris. Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, wounded but not dead as d'Artagnan had feared, aid the delivery of the complete necklace to the Queen, saving the royal couple from the embarrassment which the Cardinal had plotted. Captain Tréville eventually inducts d'Artagnan into the Musketeers of the King's Guard.

It would be Lester's first film in five years, although he had been busy directing commercials and had sought finance for other projects in that time, including an adaptation of the novel Flashman by George MacDonald Fraser. Lester says he had \\"never heard of\\" the Salkinds. They asked him if he was interested in doing The Three Musketeers and asked if he had read it. Lester said \\"Yes, I have read it, everybody's read it\\". He read \\"the first 200 pages, got excited and said yes\\". Lester said the producers \\"wanted it to be a sexy film and they wanted it to be with big sexy stars\\" such as Leonard Whiting and Ursula Andress. He said \\"I just didn't say no to anything in the early stages\\" and that the \\"die was cast\\" when he was allowed to hire George MacDonald Fraser to write the script.Soderbergh p109 Fraser had never written a script before but thought that Flashman had the tone he was going for. In late 1972 Lester offered Fraser the job.Soderbergh p 109 According to Fraser, Lester originally said he wanted to make a four-hour film and cast Richard Chamberlain as Aramis. It was later decided to turn the script into two films.George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p1-16 Fraser says he wrote them as two films, but no one told the actors.At the Movies: Costs of making 'Superman' go up, up and away. Buckley, Tom. New York Times 26 May 1978: C6. Lester says Fraser wrote the scripts in five weeks and they were \\"perfect... just wonderful.\\" \\"It's the journalism training,\\" said Fraser. =Casting= Lester says the Salkinds left him alone creatively for most of the film apart from insisting that Raquel Welch and Simon Ward be cast.Soderberg p 110 \\"Raquel is very big in all the small countries,\\" said Ilya Salkind. \\"I did the picture because of Dick Lester,\\" said Charlton Heston. In August 1973 Welch withdrew from the film due to creative and artistic differences. She announced she would instead make a film 'Decline and Fall of a Very Nice Lady.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Bart Signs Paramout Pact Murphy, Mary. Los Angeles Times 8 Aug 1973: d13. However Welch wound up rejoining the film. =Filming= The film was originally meant to be shot in Hungary. However after visiting the country Lester felt this would not be feasible, in part because of restrictions of the government on filming.Soderbergh p110 The movie ended up being shot in Spain over seventeen weeks. Locations included Sergovia, where Lester had made A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Lester says the producers assembled twenty minutes of footage and sold the film to 20th Century Fox.Sodeberg p 110 Lester says Michael Legrand \\"had about a week and a half\\" to write the music.Soderbergh p 113 Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 83% based on reviews from 12 critics. Variety gave the film a positive review, and wrote: \\"The Three Musketeers take very well to Richard Lester’s provocative version that does not send it up but does add comedy to this adventure tale\\". They praised the various performances, but noted that although Dunaway is underused she gets to make up for it in the sequel. Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote: \\"Mr. Lester seems almost exclusively concerned with action, preferably comic, and one gets the impression after a while that he and his fencing masters labored too long in choreographing the elaborate duels. They're interesting to watch, though they are without a great deal of spontaneity.\\" =Awards and nominations= Raquel Welch won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance. The film was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. George MacDonald Fraser won the Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best British Comedy Screenplay. Salkind Clause The film was originally intended to be an epic which ran for three hours including an intermission, but during production, it was determined the film could not make its announced release date in that form, so a decision was made to split the longer film into two shorter features, the second part becoming 1974's The Four Musketeers. The cast only became aware that they had made two films when they attended an advanced screening of the first film. After the movie ended a trailer for The Four Musketeers was shown, which none of them knew about until then. This incensed the actors and crew, since they were being paid for one film, and their original contracts made no mention of a second feature, resulting in lawsuits being filed to receive compensation for salaries associated with the sequel. This led to the Screen Actors Guild requiring all future actors' contracts to include what has become known as the \\"Salkind clause\\" (named after producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind), which stipulates that single productions cannot be split into film instalments without prior contractual agreement. Sequels The Four Musketeers was released the following year, with footage originally intended to combine with this film's to be part of a much longer film. In 1989, much of the cast and crew of the original returned to film The Return of the Musketeers, loosely based on Dumas' 1845 novel Twenty Years After.

He first appeared in World's Finest Comics #246 (August–September 1977). His first several appearances marked an antagonistic relationship with Wonder Woman and he later faced both the Amazon and Superman towards the end of World War II. A version of the character named Baron Reiter appeared in the fourth season of the television series Arrow played by Jimmy Akingbola. Fictional character biography He is a frequent opponent of the heroic All-Star Squadron, a band of costumed adventurers who fight domestic and foreign menaces during World War II. Baron Blitzkrieg was originally an especially vicious German army officer who was blinded and disfigured when a concentration camp prisoner threw a bottle in his face. German scientists restored his sight but not his appearance. So they experimented on Blitzkrieg, giving him superhuman strength, invulnerability, optical energy beams and the ability to fly. However, each of these abilities are manifested one at a time and only with training is he able to incorporate them together. Baron Blitzkrieg is the leader of Shadowspire and allied with Vandal Savage's organization known as Symbolix. Together, they incorporate experimental research which produces the superhero Damage. The Baron becomes a recurring foe in Damage's series, starting with issue number three. During the JSA tie-in to Infinite Crisis, it is revealed that Baron Blitzkrieg has joined the Society. The Philadelphia heroine known as Liberty Belle, who gets her powers from the Liberty Bell, attempts to jumpstart her abilities by ringing the bell. However, due to the recent supposed death of Uncle Sam (who later returned in A Brave New World), her powers are unfocused, and Blitzkrieg is thought to have been killed by the sonic shockwaves. He appears again in Infinite Crisis #7 where he is killed by Superboy-Prime who destroys the Baron's head with his heat vision. Baron Blitzkrieg has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the Hall of Justice. In Blackest Night #4, he is revived as a member of the Black Lantern Corps. He also appeared in Batman: The Widening Gyre by Kevin Smith. =Baroness Blitzkrieg= One Year Later, a new, Nazi-themed speedster supervillain named Baroness Blitzkrieg recently appeared as a member of The Fourth Reich, a team of Nazi-themed supervillains in Justice Society of America. Brutal in her killings, she runs through her victims and turns them into pulp. She is presumably a descendant of the original Baron Blitzkrieg; the Baroness joined the Nazi supervillain group Fourth Reich, and sometime before that group was hired by Vandal Savage to help exterminate the families of old Golden Age superheroes. For her part, the Baroness slaughtered several of the descendants of Commander Steel, but was later beaten by Jay Garrick during an unsuccessful attempt to kill young Mike Dugan, son of retired hero Stripesy and stepbrother of Stargirl. Powers and abilities Baron Blitzkrieg has enhanced strength, agility and endurance. He wore body armor that offered some protection from physical attack. He has heat vision and he can fly. The pre-Crisis version of the character could travel between Earth-2 and Earth-X. Other versions =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Baron Blitzkrieg is killed by Frankenstein with a sword driven through his chest.Flashpoint: Frankenstein and the Creatures of the Unknown #1 (June 2011) In other media =Television= Baron Reiter appears in Arrow as the main antagonist in the fourth season's flashbacks portrayed by Jimmy Akingbola. This version of the character is not German, but African nor is called Baron Blitzkrieg. He's occupying Lian Yu, the same island in previous flashbacks, enslaving people to harvest drugs. Reiter is a leader of criminal organisation called Shadowspire where he appeared in flashback, in the episode \\"A.W.O.L.\\". Oliver Queen is sent there to infiltrate them and learn what they're doing there by A.R.G.U.S.. The harvesting is later revealed to be a front for Reiter while his men look for a magical artifact called the Khushu Idol (which is used frequently by Damien Darhk). Once Oliver Queen and fellow slave Taiana Venediktov finds the map, they begin digging to find it. Eventually, they find it, but Oliver steals it and hides it in some caves then blows the entrance, but Reiter finds the idol and sacrifices two of his men to gain power from it to free himself. In \\"Schism\\", a confrontation between Tania, Oliver and Reiter breaks out resulting in Oliver killing Reiter and burying Taiana next to his dead father. In the Stargirl episode Hourman and Doctor Mid-Nite, it was established that Baron Blitzkrieg murdered former All-Star and Freedom Fighter Red Bee, after his secret identity was exposed. =Web= In Freedom Fighters: The Ray, \\"Blitzkrieg\\" (the Earth-X version of Barry Allen and voiced by Scott Whyte) is a meta-human speedster and a member of the New Reichsmen, an elite group within the New Reich's Schutzstaffel forces. He is an amalgamation of Baron Blitzkrieg, Baroness Blitzkrieg, Blitzen and Nazi Flash. After a battle with the Freedom Fighters, Blitzkrieg, along with Black Arrow, was knocked unconscious long enough for them to lock him up.

Parietal eye of the Merrem's Madagascar swift (Oplurus cyclurus) is surrounded by a black-and-white spot on the skin, giving it the \\"three-eyed\\" appearance A parietal eye, also known as a third eye or pineal eye, is a part of the epithalamus present in some species of fish, amphibians and reptiles. The eye is located at the top of the head, is photoreceptive and is associated with the pineal gland, regulating circadian rhythmicity and hormone production for thermoregulation. Presence in various animals The parietal eye is found in the tuatara, most lizards, frogs, salamanders, certain bony fish, sharks, and lampreys (a kind of jawless fish). It is absent in mammals, but was present in their closest extinct relatives, the therapsids. It is also absent in turtles and in archosaurs, which includes birds and crocodilians, and their extinct relatives. Anatomy The third eye, where present, is always much smaller than the main paired eyes, and, in living species, it is always covered by skin, and is usually not readily visible externally. The parietal eye is a part of the epithalamus, which can be divided into two major parts; the epiphysis (the pineal organ, or pineal gland if mostly endocrine) and the parapineal organ (often called the parietal eye, or third eye if it is photoreceptive). The parietal eye arises as an anterior evagination of the pineal organ or as a separate outgrowth of the roof of the diencephalon. In some species, it protrudes through the skull. The parietal eye uses a different biochemical method of detecting light from that of rod cells or cone cells in a normal vertebrate eye. Many of the oldest fossil vertebrates, including ostracoderms, placoderms, crossopterygians, and even early tetrapods, had a socket in the skull that appears to have held a functional third eye. This socket remains as a foramen between the parietal bones even in many living amphibians and reptiles, although it has vanished in birds and mammals. Lampreys have two parietal eyes, one that developed from the parapineal organ and the other from the pineal organ. These are one behind the other in the centre of the upper surface of the braincase. Because lampreys are among the most primitive of all living vertebrates, it is possible that this was the original condition among vertebrates, and may have allowed bottom-dwelling species to sense threats from above. Saniwa, an extinct varanid lizard, probably had two parietal eyes, one that developed from the pineal organ and the other from the parapineal organ. Saniwa is the only known jawed vertebrate to have both a pineal and a parapineal eye. In most vertebrates, the pineal organ forms the parietal eye, however, in lepidosaurs, it is formed from the parapineal organ. This implies that Saniwa reevolved the pineal eye. Comparative anatomy The parietal eye of amphibians and reptiles appears relatively far forward in the skull; thus it may be surprising that the human pineal gland appears far away from this position, tucked away between the corpus callosum and cerebellum. Also the parietal bones, in humans, make up a portion of the rear of the skull, far from the eyes. To understand this, note that the parietal bones formed a part of the skull lying between the eyes in sarcopterygians and basal amphibians, but have moved further back in higher vertebrates. Likewise, in the brain of the frog, the diencephalon, from which the pineal stalk arises, appears relatively further forward, as the cerebral hemispheres are smaller but the optic lobes are far more prominent than the human mesencephalon, which is part of the brain stem. In humans the optic tract, commissure, and optic nerve bridge the substantial distance between eyes and diencephalon. Likewise the pineal stalk of Petromyzon elongates very considerably during metamorphosis. Analogs in other species Crustaceans have a single eye atop the head as a nauplius (first-stage larva). The eye has a lens and senses the direction of light but cannot resolve more details in images. Later, more sophisticated segmented eyes develop on sides of the head while the initial eye stays for some time. So, it is possible to say that, at some stage of development, crustaceans also have a \\"third eye\\". Some species, like the brine shrimp, retain the primary eye, being three-eyed in the adult stage. Most arthropods have simple eyes, called ocelli, between their main eyes.

Usage While in previous centuries violence may have been involved,For example, from the Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society site (sourced from the Los Angeles Times): \\"The violent, long-running Jenkins-Chormicle feud, which started in 1890 over a boundary dispute, is a colorful and cruel saga – part fact, part myth – of barn burnings, ambushes and gun battles on horseback. It lasted more than two decades.\\" describes a Southern California range war that started in 1890. the term is now applied to nonviolent competition for scarce resources, such as between ranchers and environmentalists,For example, from the U of Idaho Range Management site telling of conflict in Idaho: \\" Range wars continue, just as they did a century ago, between those who have grazing rights and those who do not. Today these range wars pit ranchers, with state grazing leases, against the environmental groups that are trying to restore the grazing lease areas to a healthy and pristine land. The weapons have changed from the cold steel of a gun to the amount of cold hard cash a rancher or an environmental group will pay for a piece of land.\\" or between ranchers and fans of wild horses.For example, from the MSNBC site, telling of Bureau of Land Management policy changes and impacts: \\"The mustangs' current troubles come thanks in part to another Western icon: cattle ranchers. There are currently 37,000 mustangs sharing public rangelands with several million head of cattle. The result has been overgrazing, exacerbated by six years of drought. To restore the land, the BLM has cut the number of cattle allowed, and ranchers say the horses and burros have to be pared substantially. \\"If we don't receive relief, and soon, we'll be out of business,\\" Lemoille, Nev., rancher Kenneth Jones\\" A range war is also a slang term for a turf war or disagreement about proper hierarchy or relationship and is often used in a joking manner. In this sense, the term is found in politicsFor example, the Irregular Times site describes a disagreement among Democratic Party regulars in upstate New York as a \\"range war\\". In this case the \\"unfenced territory\\" is an election district, and the hearts and minds of Democratic party regulars and business.For example, the Mac Observer site characterises the conflict between IBM and the SCO Group as a \\"range war\\". In this case, the \\"unfenced territory\\" is the Unix/Linux marketplace, and the hearts and minds of technical, purchase influencing, IT people.

Origins, development, and use Prior to World War II, during field exercises in Panama and other jungle regions, it was determined that standard heavy canned or 'wet' rations were unsuited to soldiers on foot carrying out extended missions in jungle or tropical environments with an abundance of water sources. Testing in Panama by units of the U.S. Army soon discovered that a dry ration that could be easily decanted into waterproof bags for individual use would best suit jungle infantrymen carrying their own supplies while on foot, to be rehydrated as necessary from local water sources. The Jungle ration was originally based on foods carried by American civilians, such as geologists and engineers, prior to World War II.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), p. 288 Lightweight, ready-to-eat dry foods appealing to American palates and selected for their bulk when rehydrated were included in the menu, such as dried beef, peaches, apricots, and dehydrated whole milk. Water purification tablets were carried in order to purify water required for rehydration and drinking purposes. After extensive field testing in the Panamanian jungles, the Jungle ration was finalized at the U.S. Army Quartermaster Branch's Subsistence Research Laboratory (SRL) in Chicago, Illinois, resulting in a daily energy total of about , and weighing about when packaged for shipping.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), p. 291 The Jungle ration was designed to be compact and to feed four men in one day. A can opener, matches, toilet paper, and cigarettes were packed in each 10-ration waterproof box. In the original issue of the Jungle ration, all food components were dried or dehydrated and could be decanted from their tins or packages into individually carried lightweight waterproof bags; this practice greatly decreased the total weight, yet the foods would still keep for several weeks in jungle heat and humidity.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 289-291 In general, it was favorably accepted by soldiers during experiments with the testing platoons in Panama. Among Australian forces, who were briefly issued the ration in New Guinea, the Jungle ration became known as \\"the Christmas package\\" for its varied components, which were appreciated after a steady diet of hardtack and tins of corned beef. However, because of its expense and specialized nature, the Jungle ration, like the Mountain ration, was never popular with the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Command, who were forced to expend additional funds for procurement and storage of what they viewed as an overly expensive, redundant, and limited-issue field ration.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 291, 391 The Subsistence Research Laboratory staff in particular criticized the Jungle ration for not being packaged from the processor for immediate distribution to an individual soldier fighting in a foxhole or other defensive position, as for example, the K ration.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), p. 391Koehler, Franz A., Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - Historical Background, QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958) This criticism arose as a result of the Army and Quartermaster Corps' own failure to incorporate previous infantry field reports and test data to SRL staff and dieticians.Koehler, Franz A., Special Rations for the Armed Forces: Army Operational Rations - Historical Background, QMC Historical Studies, Historical Branch, Office of the Quartermaster General, Washington, D.C. (1958): The Quartermaster General's Historical Report indignantly notes: \\"Specifications were hurriedly produced without a clear-cut idea of what a ration assembled especially for jungle troops should consist [of]...the Subsistence Laboratory participated in the development only to the extent of determining packaging and packing requirements. [SRL staff] warned that the reasons for developing the ration had not been made clear and indicated that the tactical situation presented was one for which the K ration had been designed. Despite the warranted lack of Laboratory enthusiasm, more than 9,600,000 rations were bought in 1942 and 425,000 more early in 1943.\\" As none of the SRL personnel had ever served as infantry foot soldiers carrying their own loads through jungle terrain, they were unaware that the primary rationale of the Jungle ration was to provide a palatable, lightweight dry ration that could be broken down and carried in waterproof bags for extended patrols in heavy jungle. During its short existence, the Jungle ration was repeatedly altered with heavier, less expensive canned components by the SRL at the direction of Quartermaster Corps staff, defeating the purpose of a lightweight dehydrated ration. Replacement of the dried beef component with processed, tinned pork or beef in 1942, followed by elimination of the dried fruit component, caused a predictable nosedive in the popularity of the Jungle ration.Henry, Mark R. and Chappell, Mike, The US Army in World War II: The Pacific, Osprey Publishing (2000), , , pp. 20-21 It was finally discontinued completely in 1943 in favor of the K ration. The absence of a lightweight, yet sufficiently nourishing and palatable compact field ration had serious consequences for some U.S. troops later in the war, most notably the soldiers of Merrill's Marauders.Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 291-294 Menu contents The jungle ration was repeatedly altered during its existence, as Quartermaster Corps officers substituted less expensive or heavier canned components (such as evaporated milk).Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 288-291 Some known components include: *Biscuits (Hardtack) *Salted beef (1st issue) - A U.S. version of traditional Central and South American carne seca, using dried high-quality cuts of beef, lightly salted and spiced; this component was one of the first to be eliminated in favor of cheaper, heavier canned meats *Canned meat (2nd issue) - tinned beef/pork or pork loaf; some sources indicate pork luncheon meat (Spam) was also a rotating component *Porridge - (a general term for Grapenuts or other precooked dry cereal) *Fruit bars *Chewing gum *Hard candy *Dried apricots *Dried peaches *Lemon powder *Cocoa powder (usually combined with powdered milk and sugar to make a chocolate drink) *Roasted salted peanuts *Whole powdered milk *Raisins *Salt *Black pepper *Instant coffee *White sugar *Cigarettes *Toilet paper See also *LRRP ration (A dehydrated 1960s ration) *Mountain ration *Cresson Kearney *K-ration *B-Ration *C ration *5-in-1 ration Notes External links *History of the Subsistence Research Laboratory - Quartermaster Review *Olive- Drab: Field Rations *Army Rations: Historical Background Military food of the United States ","title":"Jungle ration"},{"id":"4316672","text":"Kang Yun-Mi (Hangul: 강윤미, Hanja: 姜允美, born February 10, 1988) is a South Korean short track speed skater who won gold in the 3000m relay at the 2006 Winter Olympics.

It is located on North Quad in front of North Dining hall, between Zahm Hall and Stanford Hall. Keenan Hall shares the building and The Chapel of The Holy Cross with adjacent dorm Stanford, and it was built in 1957. Its mascot is the Knight, and its colors are blue and white. It leads the Notre Dame halls by number of Hall of the Year titles won, and it hosts a number of the most popular events on campus, such as the Keenan Revue and Muddy Sunday. History The main entrance to Keenan on North Quad, with Stanford in the background Keenan Hall was built in 1957 and was named after James Keenan, a Notre Dame alumnus from Fort Wayne, in memory of his son James Keenan Jr., who died in 1941 before entering the university. The Keenan family operated a chain of hotels in the Midwest, and Mr. Keenan served on Notre Dame's Lay board of Trustees. Keenan Hall was designed by Ellerbe and Co. and built by the M. J. McGough Company. The hall was dedicated on November 23rd, 1957, by bishop Loras Thomas Lane of Rockford, Illinois and president Rev. Theodore Hesburgh. Originally, it accommodated 300 students in 150 rooms. The inaugural rector was Rev. Michael Murphy, C.S.C. Keenan and Stanford were built as part of Rev. Hesburgh's vision of hosting all undergraduate students on campus housing. Initially, they accommodated freshmen. Keenan and Stanford are hosted in two wings of the same building, built on the spot that once hosted the toboggan of the University's minims program. They are connected by a lobby and the chapel of the Holy Cross which they share. The building is representative of functionalist architecture with a simple double-L shape plan, a flat roof, and little exterior ornamentation. Until the mid-60s, it was a hall for incoming freshmen. The entrance doors are split in between the two dorms, and traditionally, Keenan residents do not use the Stanford doors and vice versa. The corridors of Keenan are blue and white, reflecting the dorm colors. Each floor is divided into two sections, North and West. The Holy Cross chapel features a 13-foot crucifix and a wooden carving depicting \\"Christ as a Young Boy in the Temple\\" by Ivan Meštrović, former professor and artist in residence at Notre Dame. The chapel also features stained glass windows by Robert Leader, one of the last remaining Iwo Jima veterans who witnessed the famous flag-raising. The current rector is James \\"Jimmy\\" Tull. Jimmy earned a Bachelor's degree in History from Brown University and Masters in Theology from Notre Dame. He became the rector of Keenan in 2017. Traditions =Keenan Revue= The east entrance to Keenan Hall, also located on North Quad Keenan Hall hosts many activities and events, the most prominent of which is the Keenan Revue, a comedy sketch attended annually by more than 4600 students, making it Notre Dame's most popular hall event. The first Revue was organized in 1976 by two Keenan Hall RAs, Thomas Lenz and Richard Thomas. The event was created as an alternative pastime to the campus drinking culture, and was meant to showcase the performance talent of Keenan residents. Lenz was a member of the Glee Club and Thomas had previous experience in theater. The first show, called \\"New Keenan Revue\\", opened on November 6 in Washington Hall. The first Revue was a variety show, with performances including singing, comedy, violin, poetry, juggling and others. Over time, the Revue evolved mostly into a skit-based comedy show. In 1979, issues with the electric wiring of Washington, together with the small size of the building, prompted the 1980 show to move to the O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's College. The Revue broke even in terms of finances for the first time in 1983, and in 1984 it was taped for the first time. Because the residents wanted to keep the show free of charge as a gift for the community, the Revue was subsidized by Hall Presidents' Council in 1986. The comedy of the Revue was often based on Notre Dame inside jokes and stereotypes. This led to a long contention with St. Mary's College, which hosted the show, but was also the frequent target of jokes. St. Mary's students started expressing their discontent with the show in 1991, and in 1996 Keenan invited St. Mary's representatives to preview the show's dress rehearsal. Nonetheless, controversy persisted, and many took aim at the Revue for the content of its jokes, sometimes deemed offensive. In 2000 the St. Mary's Board of Governance voted to allow the Revue to remain on campus, but controversy did not cease and in 2004 the editorial board of the student paper The Observer wrote a column to invite students to take the issue less seriously. The show was hosted in the O'Laughlin Auditorium at Saint Mary's College for the last time in 2010, when St. Mary's administration decided to cut ties.http://articles.wsbt.com/2010-02-18/year-s_24801706 Since 2011, it moved to Stepan Center on the campus of Notre Dame. In recent years, the skits of the show have parodied and made fun mostly of campus life and stereotypes, have been less harsh, and have caused less controversy. The show is the signature event of Keenan Hall. Three shows are offered on consecutive Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in February. The show is loved by the student body, and ticket distribution is an event in itself, always drawing large crowds, with tickets running out in minutes. With an attendance of over 4600 (1500 per show), it is the most attended hall event, and one of the most popular and beloved events at Notre Dame. The south entrance to Keenan Hall, directly across from Zahm Hall, one of its rivals =Muddy Sunday= Another popular event on campus is Muddy Sunday, a volleyball tournament played in mud during the annual spring An Tóstal celebrations. All the profits go to Habitat for Humanity. =Keenan Kommons= The basement, known as the Keenan Kommons, is one of the largest common spaces on campus. It features lounges, ping pong tables, pool tables, televisions, and study spaces. It was recently renovated and now features three TV's, including a 90-inch flat screen.http://www.arkosdesign.com/OC/site/index.php?page=galleries&type;=misc&id;=stanford_hall_keenan_hall_renovations The Kommons also includes a weight room, two kitchens, a laundry room, a music rehearsal space, a library and study room, and a meeting room. Especially beloved to students is a student-run eatery called Zaland, which is an affordable option for late-night food and sells the \\"Best Pizza in Zaland\\". =Rivalries with Stanford and Zahm= Traditionally, the rival dorm of Keenan has always been the twin dorm Stanford Hall, with whom Keenan shares its chapel. The annual inter-hall football match is called \\"Battle for the Chapel\\". Keenan is very active in sports, especially in interhall tackle football. In recent times the main rival of Keenan has been Zahm Hall. Residents of Keenan and Zahm have a long history of pranks and feuds. Keenan has several times won Hall of the Year and Men's Hall of the Year, and currently retains the \\"Hall of the Year\\" title. =Other Traditions= Keenan Hall's \\"SYR\\" is Disco Roll, a 70's-themed disco dance held at a local roller skate rink. Keenan is also extremely active in service, partaking in two major service events each year as well as a weekly trip to South Bend's Dismas House, a safe haven for individuals recently released from incarceration, every Monday evening for dinner. The two major service events are the Great Pumpkin, a haunted house set up in the Kommons for underprivileged children in South Bend for Halloween, and Day of Service, which takes place in late March. Keenan also runs Keenan Klassic, a two-on-two charity basketball tournament the weekend of Reading Days in May.http://keenanhall.nd.edu/events/disco- roll/http://keenanhall.nd.edu/events/great- pumpkin/http://keenanhall.nd.edu/events/reindeer- roast/http://keenanhall.nd.edu/events/keenan-klassic/ Awards Hall of the Year: * 1996-1997 * 2001-2002 * 2013-2014 Men's Hall of the Year: * 2003-2004 * 2005-2006 * 2007-2008 * 2010-2011 * 2014-2015 Notable residents * George Atkinson III '14 - former NFL running back * Stan Bowman - Chicago Blackhawks Vice President and General Manager * Joe Montana - 4-time Super Bowl champion quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs * Allen Pinkett - former running back for the Houston Oilershttp://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/VOL_0125/VOL_0125_ISSUE_0005.pdf * Jamie Reidy '92 - Huffington Post author and screenwriter * Matt Storin '64 - former editor of the Boston Globe * Steve Bartman - fan infamous for interfering in Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS * Alize Mack - former Notre Dame Football tight end * Cole Luke References External links * Official Notre Dame Keenan Hall profile 1957 establishments in Indiana University of Notre Dame residence halls University of Notre Dame buildings and structures ","title":"Keenan Hall"},{"id":"4316688","text":"Dirty Pretty Things were an English band fronted by Carl Barât, a member of The Libertines. The formation of the band was announced in September 2005, after a dispute between Barât and Pete Doherty led to the breakup of The Libertines in 2004. Barât had worked with Vertigo Records and had previously revealed that his new project was with the label. Didz Hammond announced he was leaving the Cooper Temple Clause to join the band alongside Libertines drummer Gary Powell and guitarist Anthony Rossomando, who had filled in for Doherty following his departure from The Libertines. They played their first shows in October 2005 in Italy and Paris, France. They announced their split on 1 October 2008 and played their final shows during November that year. After adopting the name Dirty Pretty Things, problems arose - a four-piece band from Salisbury had been playing as \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" since early January 2005, claiming to have already trademarked the name in the UK. The two groups came to an agreement over the name, and the other band was renamed Mitchell Devastation. An Australian band had been playing under \\"Dirty Pretty Things\\" since 2003, although it also opted to change it. The name was shared by Barât's club nights in venues throughout London; they assumed the name \\"Bright Young Things\\" to avoid confusion. History = Formation and Waterloo to Anywhere: 2005–2006 = Dirty Pretty Things began recording their first album in Los Angeles, California with high-profile producer Dave Sardy, and in Glasgow, Scotland with producer Tony Doogan. \\"You Fucking Love It\\", a track from the band's debut album, was made available on a free CD with 1 April 2006 issue of NME entitled \\"NME and MTV2 present Best Newbands Showcase 2006\\". The band's debut album, Waterloo to Anywhere, was released on 8 May 2006, reaching number three on the music charts and receiving critical approval. The first single (and first official band release) from the album, \\"Bang Bang, You're Dead\\", was released on 24 April 2006 and reached number five in the singles chart in its first week of sales. The second single, \\"Deadwood\\", was released on 10 July 2006 and reached number 20 in the singles chart. The album's third single, \\"Wondering\\", was released on 25 September 2006 and reached number 34. The band toured extensively in the UK during the first half of 2006. They played their first American show at the SXSW festival in Texas. During the summer of 2006, the group played at several UK festivals, including the Gonville & Caius College May Ball 2006, Isle of Wight Festival, Wireless Festival, T in the Park, Kendal Calling and the Irish festival Oxegen. The band played with the Red Hot Chili Peppers at their concerts in Ipswich and Coventry in July 2006. The band were supported on their debut tour of the UK by Dublin band Humanzi. On 13 May 2006 Barât and Hammond appeared on the football show Soccer AM. The pair appeared to be high or drunk following a night out after a gig in Wolverhampton, causing fellow guest Noel Gallagher to compare Barât's slightly incoherent rambling to that of his brother, Liam. Following a festival appearance in Taipei, Barât broke his collarbone after falling from a motorbike during a drinking session, leading to speculation that Dirty Pretty Things would have to cancel upcoming performing dates in North America. On 16 October 2006, the band released a DVD, Puffing on a Coffin Nail, which featured more than two-and-a-half hours of concert footage and documentaries. On 25 October 2006, Barât appeared as a special guest at Paul Weller's set during the Electric Proms, duetting on \\"Peacock Suit\\" and \\"In the City\\". =Romance at Short Notice: 2007–2008= The band supported Muse at their 16 June 2007 Wembley Stadium show and supported the Red Hot Chili Peppers on 24 June at Goffertpark Nijmegen in The Netherlands. They also played at Glastonbury 2007 and performed several new songs. On 22 July the band supported Pet Shop Boys at the Eden Project in Cornwall, playing a slew of new songs including \\"Come Closer\\".Dirty Pretty Things and Pet Shop Boys - Eden Sessions \\"Radio Song\\" (co-written by Barât and Chris McCormack) was released as part of the original soundtrack for Run, Fat Boy, Run, on 7 September 2007 for download, and on 10 September 2007 on CD. In October the band appeared on the Love Music Hate Racism CD, which was given away with copies of the NME and also available as a download from the LMHR website . \\"9 Lives\\" was Dirty Pretty Things' contribution to the free album and was in a finished studio form (although it was recorded in guitarist Anthony Rossomando's flat in London). The band planned to record their second album in the summer of 2007, to have it ready for a tentative September 2007 release. However the band were having problems with production and the release date had to be pushed back. On 2 May 2008 the band had completed 12 tracks for the album and later revealed the title to be Romance at Short Notice. The name is a reference to the final line in Saki's short story \\"The Open Window.\\" Previously, the title This Is Where The Truth Begins had been circulated as the title of the album. On 12 May 2008, the song \\"Hippy's Son\\" was made available for free download from the band's official website and on 22 June the band made all of the album available for free streaming on NME.com. Romance at Short Notice was released on 30 June 2008, with the single \\"Tired of England\\" released a week earlier on 23 June. Both, album and single, failed to reach high chart positions. The album entered the UK albums chart at number 35 and left it after only two weeks. On 7 July the band placed 4 songs available for download on Napster - \\"Buzzards and Crows\\", \\"Plastic Hearts\\", \\"Hippy's Son\\" and a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\". On 11 July the band appeared on XFM's Live From Leicester Square programme. They played \\"Plastic Hearts\\", \\"Bang Bang You're Dead\\" and a cover of Glasvegas' \\"It's My Own Cheating Heart That Makes Me Cry\\". In May 2008, Dirty Pretty Things had their Coventry Kasbah gig filmed and later broadcast on Channelbee. =Separation= On 1 October 2008 it was announced that the band would split after a month-long UK tour, beginning in Preston on 3 October. In a statement, the band said it was time for them \\"to try new things\\" but added that these would not involve The Libertines. The last Dirty Pretty Things gig, 'The Last Hurrah' was announced for 20 December 2008, at the Astoria 2 in London. Support was from The Paddingtons. The band promised 'a night to remember' and signed memorabilia to thank the loyal fans of the band.

He is an owner-operator truck driver and was a candidate in the Democratic primary for United States Senate in May 2006, for the seat held by Republican R. Michael DeWine. Ohio election law requires only 1000 signatures to run for Senate as a major party primary candidate, and Keiser claimed to single-handedly gather these signatures. He lost the primary to Sherrod Brown for the Ohio United States Senate election, 2006, receiving 163,628 votes (21.89%). He is a U.S. Army veteran who served in Iran and in Vietnam. He has a Bachelor in Science degree in Watershed Management from the University of Colorado and also holds a Master of Divinity degree in Christian Education from Denver Conservative Baptist Seminary. Keiser does not claim prior political or legal experience. Keiser holds several controversial positions. He is a vocal proponent of \\"traditional values\\" including heterosexual marriage - between one man and one woman only; appointment of strict constructionist jurists on every level, especially the Alabama Supreme Court, federal district courts and the Supreme Court; the Second Amendment; capital punishment; \\"winning\\" the War on Terror; teaching and encouraging school prayer; taxpayer-financed school vouchers; and a \\"Biblical\\" view of Israel. Additionally, Keiser is anti-abortion and called for denying funding to health providers who provide information about abortion. He claims on his blog that abortion is \\"sacrificing our babies to the gods of pleasure and convenience\\". Keiser is in favor of adult stem cell research and opposes embryonic stem cell research. On his campaign's weblog he wrote, \\"It (embryonic stem cell research) is a ploy of money-hungry academic researchers and blood-thirsty liberals and politicians who want to bring a culture of death to America and it part of their religion. It is just like the religions of old in which they used human infant sacrifice in idol worship.\\" He is an advocate for a strong national defense and military. This includes using the US armed forces to \\"battle drugs and terrorism\\", something Keiser claimed Sherrod Brown is opposed to. Keiser did not cite the source of his claim. Keiser called creationism \\"true\\" and endorses its teaching over evolution. Keiser says school children should be \\"taught to pray\\" and that \\"liberals\\" have spent too long worshipping the \\"god of Reason\\". Keiser is in favor of de-funding and total U.S. withdrawal from the United Nations. He has also said that he would not oppose making homosexuality a crime punishable by death for the overall spiritual and moral health of society, although he, himself, would not introduce such legislation. He also advocates reducing the deficit, limiting government spending and decreasing taxes but doesn't detail plans for such changes. Furthermore, Keiser claims \\"God’s law is very clear about abortion, the death penalty and corrupting children.\\" Additionally, the idea that \\"God's law\\" should affect policy in a secular democracy is itself controversial. In March 2006, Keiser sparked further outrage with his suggestions that Elton John should be killed (\\"worthy of death\\"), as should Mary Cheney (daughter of Dick Cheney), for being homosexual. In May 2006 he called for homosexuality to be punishable by death. \\"Just as we have laws against taking drugs, we should have laws against immoral behaviour.\\" External links *Merrill S.

In 2001, she won two silver medals at the World Championships as a member of the national team. In 2001 Jeon was omitted from the national team roster and did not participated in the 2002 Winter Olympics. In February 2002, however, Jeon gained attention again, winning five gold medals at the national collegiate championships. Jeon first participated at the Winter Olympics in February 2006. She was expected to compete in the 500 metres as well but competed only in the 3000 metre relay due to injuries, combining with Choi Eun-Kyung, Byun Chun-Sa, Jin Sun-Yu and Kang Yun-Mi. Team Korea eventually won its fourth consecutive Olympic women's 3000 metre relay gold medal. Jeon was selected as the reserve member of the South Korean national team for the 2010 Winter Olympics, ranked sixth overall in the national Olympic trials. However, she did not get a chance to participate in any event at the Olympics. In February 2011, Jeon won the gold medal in the women's senior 500 metres at the 2011 Korean National Sports Festival by .37 of a second to beat out 2006 Olympic gold medalist Kang Yun- Mi.

Its slogan is \\"The Call of the Friendly Islands\\". Radio Tonga currently broadcasts services on three separate frequencies. Radio Tonga 1 The most far-reaching of all Radio Tonga's services, this channel broadcasts daily from 6am to midnight, on a frequency of 1017 kHz. This is the only service of TBC that has been in operation since TBC's inception in 1961. It features local, Pacific & international news, as well as Tongan music, and overseas retro music, mostly from the 1970s & 1980s. Several local church organisations and businesses have weekly programs, and, though it is government-owned and funded, a significant source of its profit relies on in-house commercial advertising. In the event of local emergencies, such as tropical cyclones, Radio Tonga has been known to stay on the air all night with constant cyclone updates from the Tonga Meteorological Service. Radio Tonga 1 can be heard throughout the entire Kingdom of Tonga, including the outer island groups of Ha'apai, Vava'u, Niuafo'ou & Niuatoputapu, although there have been reports of listeners receiving the signal in other countries, such as Samoa and Finland. The station broadcasts with a power output of 10,000 Watts into a non directional antenna. Radio Tonga 2 - Kool 90FM Formerly known as FM97, now broadcasting on a frequency of 90.0 MHz, this commercial FM station commenced in the early 1990s, and now runs 24 hours a day, playing mostly chart-toppers from abroad. After the local broadcast ends at midnight, BBC programming is relayed live via satellite until the local broadcast resumes at 6am. This service can only be heard on the main island of Tongatapu, and its closely surrounding islands such as 'Eua, Pangaimotu and Atata. The station broadcasts with 500 watts. 103FM Launched on 21 November 2005, this FM service—broadcast on 103.0 MHz—relays Radio Australia 24 hours a day, and is only available to listeners in Tongatapu and 'Eua.

In 2005, she was named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers for contributions to image and video analysis and affective computing. In 2019 she received one of the highest professional honors accorded an engineer, election to the National Academy of Engineering for her contributions on affective computing and wearable computing. Picard is credited with starting the branch of computer science known as affective computing with her 1997 book of the same name. This book described the importance of emotion in intelligence, the vital role human emotion communication has to relationships between people, and the possible effects of emotion recognition by robots and wearable computers. Her work in this field has led to an expansion into autism research and developing devices that could help humans recognize nuances in human emotions. Academics Picard holds a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with highest honors and a certificate in computer engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology (1984), and master's (1986) and doctorate degrees (1991), both in electrical engineering and computer science, from MIT. Her thesis was titled Texture Modeling: Temperature Effects on Markov/Gibbs Random Fields. She has been a member of the faculty at the MIT Media Laboratory since 1991, with tenure since 1998 and a full professorship since 2005. Picard is a researcher in the field of affective computing and the founder and director of the Affective Computing Research Group at the MIT Media Lab. The Affective Computing Research Group develops tools, techniques, and devices for sensing, interpreting, and processing emotion signals that drive state-of-the-art systems that respond intelligently to human emotional states. Applications of their research include improved tutoring systems and assistive technology for use in addressing the verbal communications difficulties experienced by individuals with autism. She also works with Sherry Turkle and Cynthia Breazeal in the field of social robots, and has published significant work in the areas of digital image processing, pattern recognition, and wearable computers. Picard's former students include Steve Mann, professor and researcher in wearable computers. Picard is Faculty Chair of the MIT MindHandHeart Initiative, a \\"coalition of students, faculty, and staff [...] working collaboratively and strategically to strengthen the fabric of [the] MIT community.\\" =Affective computing= While working in the field of affective computing, Picard published Affective Computing. MIT's press release for Picard's textbook states, \\"According to Rosalind Picard, if we want computers to be genuinely intelligent and to interact naturally with us, we must give computers the ability to recognize, understand, even to have and express emotions\\". Picard explains the need to monitor emotional cues and how this is present with humans when she states: :\\"Whatever his strategy, the good teacher detects important affective cues from the student and responds differently because of them. For example, the teacher might leave subtle hints or clues for the student to discover, thereby preserving the learner's sense of self-propelled discovery. Whether the subject matter involves deliberate emotional expression as is the case with music, or is a \\"non-emotional\\" topic such as science, the teacher that attends to a student's interest, pleasure, and distress is perceived as more effective than the teacher that proceeds callously. The best teachers know that frustration usually precedes quitting, and know how to redirect or motivate the pupil at such times. They get to know their student, including how much distress that student can withstand before learning breaks down.\\"Picard, Rosalind. Affective Computing. MIT Press, 1997. p. 93-94 But such emotional cues are not part of robotic intelligence. In order to portray how such a recognition would alter interactions with robots, Picard gave an example situation: :Imagine your robot entering the kitchen as you prepare breakfast for guests. The robot looks happy to see you and greets you with a cheery \\"Good morning.\\" You mumble something it does not understand. It notices your face, vocal tone, smoke above the stove, and your slamming of a pot into the sink, and infers that you do not appear to be having a good morning. Immediately, it adjusts its internal state to \\"subdued,\\" which has the effect of lowering its vocal pitch and amplitude settings, eliminating cheery behavioral displays, and suppressing unnecessary conversation. Suppose you exclaim, \\"Ow!!\\" yanking your hand from the hot stove, rushing to run your fingers under cold water, adding \\"I can't believe I ruined the sauce.\\" While the robot's speech recognition may not have high confidence that it accurately recognized all of your words, its assessment of your affect and actions indicates a high probability that you are upset and maybe hurt. (article by R.Picard) In such a situation, it is necessary for the robots to understand the emotional aspects of humans in order to better serve their intended purpose. Her work has influenced many fields beyond computer science, ranging from video games to law. One critic, Aaron Sloman, described the book as having a \\"bold vision\\" that will inspire some and irritate others. Other critics emphasize the importance behind the work as it establishes an important framework for the field as a whole. Picard responded to Sloman's review by saying, \\"I don’t think the review captures the flavor of the book. However, he does raise interesting points, as well as potential misunderstandings, both of which I am grateful for the opportunity to comment on\\". In 2009, Picard co-founded Affectiva, along with Rana el Kaliouby, and became the company's chief scientist for the next four years. The company was based on technologies the two began developing at the Affective Computing Research Group within the MIT Media Lab. In April 2014, Picard co-founded Empatica, Inc, a business creating wearable sensors and analytics to help people understand and communicate physiological changes involved in emotion. Her team showed that physiological changes in the emotion system could help identify seizures that might be life-threatening. =Autism research= Besides researching robotic intelligence, Picard has performed research in the field of autism. Her team created an \\"emotional-social intelligence prosthesis\\" (ESP), that allowed a person diagnosed with autism to monitor their own facial reactions in order to educate them on social cues in others. This device had a 65% accuracy rate for reading one of eight emotional states from an individual's facial expressions and head movements. She revealed parts of this technology at the 11th Annual International Symposium on Wearable Computers. =Emotion research= Picard has put forward theories to improve the research of emotions through the implementation of new technologies with a focus to gather emotional information outside of a lab setting. With devices that can measure heart-rate, electrodermal activity, and other physiological changes, and that are non-obtrusive and simple to wear (Picard uses an example of the iCalm sensor) emotional responses can be more accurately observed in a real life. She also argues against nomothetic research over idiographic research when it comes to studying emotions claiming that an individualized approach would be more fruitful than just throwing out data when a group correlation is not found. In this way, data from individuals could still be kept and analyzed and then paired (not averaged) with data clusters that were similar.Picard, Rosalind J. (July 2010) Emotion Research by the People, for the People. Volume 2 Number 3. Emotion Review. 250-254. Religion and science Picard says that she was raised an atheist, but converted to Christianity as a young adult. She is a practicing Christian\\"Presbyterians Want Their Newton Church Back\\"\\"An MIT Professor Meets the Author of All Knowledge\\" ~ Christianity Today and does not believe there is a separation of the \\"material body and immaterial spirit\\" but that there is \\"something else that we haven't discovered yet\\", and believes \\"that scientists cannot assume that nothing exists beyond what they can measure\\". She believes it likely that there is \\"still something more\\" to life, beyond what we have discovered, and sees DNA as too complex to have originated through \\"purely random processes\\". To her, the complexity of life shows \\"the mark of intervention\\", and \\"a much greater mind, a much greater scientist, a much greater engineer behind who we are\\". She sees her religious beliefs as playing a role in her work in affective computing, and explains that when \\"Digging into the models of how the emotions work, I find I feel even greater awe and appreciation for the way we are made, and therefore for the Maker that has brought this about\\". Picard is one of the signatories of the Discovery Institute's A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism, a petition which the intelligent design movement used in an effort to cast doubt on evolution as adequate for explaining the complexity of life and saying examination of the evidence should be encouraged. Although her view about the complexity of DNA \\"sounds similar to the intelligent design debate\\", reporter Mirko Petricevic writes, \\"Picard has some reservations about intelligent design, saying it isn't being sufficiently challenged by Christians and other people of faith\\". She argues that the media has created a false dilemma by dividing everyone into two groups, supporters of intelligent design or evolution. \\"To simply put most of us in one camp or the other does the whole state of knowledge a huge disservice.\\" Awards * Georgia Engineering Foundation Fellowship(s) 1980, 81, 82, 83 * Society of Women Engineers: “The Outstanding Woman Engineering Student” 1981, 82, 83, 84 * National Science Foundation Fellow 1984 * AT&T; Bell Laboratories “One Year On Campus” Fellow 1984 * Georgia Institute of Technology Department of Electrical Engineering Faculty Award 1984 * Voted Omicron Delta Kappa, Georgia Tech and Southeast U.

The brand name is currently owned by retail chain MonkeySports, which acquired it in 2008.Koho on The Stick Guru Following a brief revival in the early 2010s, the brand is currently dormant. Products commercialised included skates, sticks, and helmets.  History  Koho 700 CA Senior Pro chest and arm protector The brand was founded by the Karhu Company in the 1950s, launching a line of ice hockey sticks.\\"The Hockey Company profile\\" on Reference for Business By the mid 1970s they started making goaltending equipment. They were one of the first companies to produce team colored pro leather leg pads for goalies as early as 1976. In the 1980s Billy Smith, Grant Fuhr, Mario Gosselin, Kari Takko, and Mike Vernon were some of the NHL goalies to use the brand. That success made Koho the largest Finnish manufacturer in the 1980s.HOCKEY STICK MAKER STRUGGLES IN NEWLY COMPETITIVE MARRKET, The New York Times, 15 March 1982 In the 1980s, Karhu sold Koho to CCM. Beginning in the early 1990s, Koho offered a line of goaltending equipment called Evolution. It was designed with former NHL goalie Bob Suave who at the time, worked for Koho. Arturs Irbe of the San Jose Sharks was well known for using this line of gear for many years and doing all the repairs himself. Soon after the Evolution line of gear, the Revolution line was developed and made popular by goalies such as Patrick Roy and Felix Potvin. Later mid 1990s versions of Koho goalie equipment were designed by goalie equipment maker Michel Lefebvre, who started with the 530 series, which were based on the pad which was sold previously under the Lefebvre brand. Lefebrve, contracted now to develop pads to be sold exclusively through the Koho brand, designed the 560, 570, 580 and 590 series. Beginning with the 560 series, Koho pads were designed exclusively by Lefebvre, and the equipment line was designed for the butterfly style of play. The 590 was the last pad that Patrick Roy wore during the 2002–03 season. Koho GB700 Senior Pro blocker During the 2004 World Cup of Hockey, the original plan was to have Roberto Luongo premiere the Koho 600 pad. However, as a result of the unexpected purchase of The Hockey Company by Reebok, Luongo appeared in the World Cup wearing 590s. When The Hockey Company was purchased by Reebok, the Koho name was momentarily dropped and replaced by Reebok, with the intent of eventually phasing out the Koho name from its main product line. The Hockey Company did so previously with the Heaton brand, and would eventually do the same with the CCM goalie brand. Koho was then delegated to a price-point street hockey goalie equipment set, featuring the graphic of the 570. However, on Reebok's first goalie equipment lines, including the RBK Premier and RBK Premier 2, a small tag with the Koho by Lefebvre logo remained, as the names Koho and Lefebvre still had (and continue to have) residual market value. Initially, Rbk was used for the pro and intermediate pro lines of equipment, while Reebok was reserved for all other lines (senior, junior and youth). When Reebok discontinued the use of Rbk in 2008, the Rbk branding was dropped from the hockey equipment as well. When the NHL resumed play in the 2005–06 season following the lockout, only one goaltender, Maxime Ouellet of the Vancouver Canucks, was using Koho equipment. Because the Koho name had been dropped by The Hockey Company, which consequently had not paid the NHL the appropriate licensing fees, the Koho name was not permitted to appear in a game or in any league or team media or promotional materials. Nonetheless, the Koho name remained on Ouellet's pads, which was an oversight by the league. Koho GM700 Senior Pro trapper At the beginning of the 2007–08 season, Jonas Hiller of the Anaheim Ducks appeared in pre-season games in 580 leg pads, which were white and blue, matching the colors of his previous team, HC Davos. The Koho name had actually already been removed from Hiller's pads prior to the 2006 IIHF World Championships. By the start of the regular season, Hiller was wearing 580s in colors matching the Ducks' uniform colors. However, about halfway through the season, the logos were removed from his pads. In 2008, retail company GoalieMonkey acquired rights to the brand, producing a set with the name Koho 700. The set included pads, blocker, glove, chest protector and a composite goal stick. None of these products were actually designed by Lefebvre, however. They were a pad designed for the hybrid goaltender, but nevertheless feel very similar to the Lefebvre Koho lines, minus the traditional shin rolls, which were never a feature of Lefebvre's design. Meanwhile, Jonas Hiller began the 2008–09 season with 580s with no Koho logos. About halfway through the season, however, Hiller switched to a nearly identical pair of leg pads, this time featuring the Koho logos. This indicated that Monkey Sports, Inc. had successfully negotiated the licensing rights with the NHL, marking Koho's official return to the NHL. In 2009, rumors circulated that a new Koho pad, dubbed the \\"900\\" series, would be produced, in conjunction with Michel Lefebvre. At the start of the 2009–10 season, Hiller began play in his trademark 580s, along with a blocker and catching glove with custom Koho graphics, thus giving credence to earlier rumors of a new Koho pad. It was later revealed there was a new pad to match his blocker and catching glove but since Hiller had no time to break them in after receiving them after training camp, he stuck with his signature 580s. Hiller debuted the Koho 588 pad in the beginning of the 2010–11 season.

Early life and education  George Brown was born at Barnard Castle, Durham, England, the son of George Brown, barrister, and his wife Elizabeth, née Dixon, sister of the wife of Rev. Thomas Buddle, missionary in New Zealand. Brown was educated at a private school and on leaving, became an assistant in a doctors surgery, was afterwards with a chemist, and then in a draper's shop. Brown reacted to his stepmother's discipline and attempted to run away to sea.  Seagoing life  Brown, when 16 years old, sailed in a large East Indiaman chartered by the government as a troop-ship. After going to the Mediterranean it went to Quebec. There Brown had an accident and broke his leg, fortunately in his case, as the vessel was lost with all hands on her next voyage. After a short stay in Canada, Brown returned to England but could not settle down. In March 1855 Brown migrated to New Zealand, among the other passengers being Bishop Selwyn and the Rev. J. C. Patteson, afterwards bishop of Melanesia. He joined Patteson's bible class, but \\"could not remember receiving any great spiritual benefit at that time\\". Landing at Auckland he went to Onehunga where he was kindly received by an uncle and aunt, the Rev. Thomas and Mrs Buddle.  Conversion and missionary work  Piula Theological College in Samoa Under their influence Brown experienced a conversion and became a local preacher. In 1859 he decided to offer himself as a missionary to Fiji, and at the Sydney Methodist conference of 1860 was appointed. On 2 August 1860 he was married to Miss Sarah Lydia Wallis, daughter of the Rev. James Wallis. They left next month for Sydney where Brown was ordained, and going on to Samoa, arrived on 30 October 1860. He lived in Samoa between 1860 and 1874, mostly on the island of Savai'i. He learned the language and wrote about Samoan culture. He was a key figure in the early days of training Samoans for the ministry and the establishment of Piula Theological College on the north coast of Upolu Island in Samoa. Brown began writing his manuscript journals in Samoa, recording his experience as a missionary in the Pacific. When Brown began his work most of the natives were already professing Christians, and he immediately set to work building churches and mission houses and attending to the education of the children. He quickly learned the language, and every condition seemed favourable, but there was one disturbing feature. Germany was extending her influence in the islands, and some of her traders far from trying to keep the peace were selling arms and ammunition to the natives. One day war broke out between the natives of an adjoining district and those of his own centre, and Brown immediately hastened to place himself between the contending parties, and sat for the remainder of the day in the sun trying to make a truce between them. In this he was not successful and there was much fighting for some time. Brown, however, became a great figure among the Samoans. His varied experiences as a youth in the doctor's surgery and chemist's shop helped him in the simple doctoring of native ills, and his career as a sailor had taught him many useful things. His mastery of the language was a great asset, and his human charity helped much in all his relations with both the natives and the white beachcombers living on the islands. He left Samoa in 1874 with the intention of being transferred to New Britain and New Ireland, and travelled through Australia appealing for funds. In August 1875 Brown went to the New Britain group of islands and began his work there. In the early days he was constantly in danger of losing his life, as he worked among cannibalistic natives who were constantly fighting among themselves. In 1878 he led a punitive expedition against a cannibal chief responsible for the massacre of Christian native teachers, this caused an uproar in the Australian press and was known as the 'Blanche Bay affair'. However it did improve the situation for Europeans, later Brown's wife could join him. He was there a little more than five years and returned to Sydney in the beginning of 1881.  Deputation and circuit work  During the next six years Brown was engaged in deputation and circuit work. He also wrote a series of anonymous articles in the Sydney Morning Herald regarding the necessity of British control of the islands of the Pacific. He was thoroughly familiar with German methods, and was convinced that they constituted a menace both to the natives and the world in general. In 1887 he was appointed secretary of the board of missions of the Methodist Church and held this position for many years. In the following year he was appointed a special commissioner to report on the position in Tonga, where there had been serious trouble for some years during the premiership of Shirley Waldemar Baker. He was able to speak the language of the natives and gather evidence for himself. He compiled a comprehensive and valuable series of Reports by the Rev. George Brown, Special Commissioner of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist General Conference to Tonga, printed at Sydney in 1890. He continued for many years to keep in touch with missionary work in Papua, the Bismarck Archipelago, the Solomons, Samoa, Fiji and Tonga. In the islands in the German sphere of influence he had to walk warily, but his knowledge and experience were of the greatest value not only to his own church but to the British government. He resigned his position of general secretary of missions in 1907, and in the following year brought out his autobiography George Brown, D.D., Pioneer-missionary and Explorer. Unfortunately he had declined an offer by his friend, Robert Louis Stevenson, to write his biography.  Writing  Ten volumes of Brown's manuscript journals survive. Brown published Melanesians and Polynesians Their Life-histories Described and Compared (1910), a valuable record of the manners, customs and folklore of the islanders written by a man who had spent much of his time among them over a period of 48 years, and who was familiar with the Samoan, Tongan, Fijian and New Britain languages. Brown died at Sydney on 7 April 1917. His wife survived him with two sons and three daughters. Brown was also the author of various pamphlets and articles, and was associated with the Rev. B. Danks in the preparation of a Dictionary of the Duke of York Language New Britain Group.

It is run as part of the University of Otago, the main campus of which is 23 kilometres to the southwest in Dunedin's main urban area. History The laboratory is New Zealand and Oceania's oldest established marine research facility and was opened on 13 January 1904. It was originally proposed for Dunedin by leading MP and naturalist G. M. Thomson as a fish hatchery. Initially planned to be sited at Pūrākaunui, north of Port Chalmers, the current site on the shores of Otago Harbour was deemed more suitable. The laboratory went through a period of revival in the 1950s, in which Elizabeth Joan Batham was a key player. The laboratory is highly regarded worldwide for its facilities and research, and is an important asset to the university's Marine Science Department. The facility also includes the New Zealand Marine Studies Centre and Aquarium, which offers education programmes to pre-booked groups.

A prominent feature of the P.1101 prototype was that the sweep angle of the wings could be changed before flight, a feature further developed in later variable-sweep aircraft such as the Bell X-5 and Grumman XF10F Jaguar. Design and development Within nine days of the 15 July 1944 issuance of design specifications for the Emergency Fighter, the Messerschmitt design bureau, under Dr. Woldemar Voigt, had formed a preliminary paper design for the P.1101. The aircraft which was developed initially had a short and wide fuselage, tricycle landing gear, and mid-mounted wings with an inner sweep of 40°Christopher, p.157, says 45. near the fuselage, and a shallower 26° outboard. The single HeS 011 jet engine was to be mounted internally within the fuselage, being aspirated by two rounded intakes located on either side of the cockpit. The high tail was of a V configuration, and mounted on a tapered boom which extended over and past the jet exhaust, while the cockpit was forward-mounted, with the canopy integrated into the fuselage and forming part of the rounded nose of the aircraft. By late August 1944, the design, still in paper form, had evolved into a sleeker incarnation, with the previously stout fuselage lengthened and narrowed with a conical nose section, added in front of the cockpit. The compound sweep wing was also abandoned, with the outer wing of the Me 262 instead being adapted. Proposals for a pulsejet and rocket combination, the P.1101L, were also put forth. The design was further developed, including a longer nose, and after the wind tunnel testing of a number of wing and fuselage profiles, the decision was made to undertake the construction of a full-scale test aircraft. This finalized design and associated test data were submitted to the Construction Bureau on 10 November 1944 and the selection of production materials was begun on 4 December 1944. On 28 February 1945, the RLM settled on a competing design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 183, as the winner of the Emergency Fighter program. This decision was based in part on the considerable design difficulties being encountered by the Messerschmitt P.1101 design team. For example, the cannon installation was proving too crowded, the mainwheel retraction and door mechanisms were too complex, the fuselage needed a great number of \\"strong points\\" to deal with loads, and the anticipated performance had fallen below the RLM specifications, due to increased weight. =Production prototype= Since considerable work had already been done on the P.1101 design, the RLM decided to continue reduced funding in order for Messerschmitt to carry out experimental flights, testing the swept back wing at anticipated speeds up to Mach 1. The worsening war situation led to the expedited, but risky, approach of building a full-scale prototype in parallel with detail construction and continuing statistical calculation, while existing components such as the wings (Me 262), landing gear (extended Bf 109), and flight components were utilized where feasible. It was also intended for the test flights to be conducted with 35, 40, and 45-degree wing sweep. Production of the V1 prototype was begun at Messerschmitt's Bavarian Oberammergau Complex with a projected first flight in June 1945. The P.1101 V1 prototype was of duralumin fuselage construction, retaining the outer wing section of the Me 262, but with larger slats and, as mentioned previously, the wing sweep could be adjusted on the ground from 30, 40, to 45 degrees; this was for testing only and never intended as an operational feature. The fuselage-mounted tandem intakes of the preliminary designs were replaced by a single nose intake, and the canopy became a bubble design, which afforded better allround vision than the initial integrated canopy offered. The production prototype also incorporated a more conventional swept tail design, which was constructed out of wood and remained mounted on the tapered tailboom. A T-tail was also designed. The tricycle undercarriage consisted of a steerable, rearward- retracting nosewheel and long forward-retracting wing root-mounted main gear. The prototype was fitted with an apparently inoperable Heinkel He S 011 jet engine, but given the non-availability of this engine, a Jumo 004B was fitted for test flights. (Changing the type of engine was meant to be comparatively easy.) In addition, the production model was to be equipped with a pressurized cockpit and armored canopy,Me P.1101 - Luftarchiv and to be armed with two or four MK 108 cannons, Ruhrstahl X-4 air-to-air missiles, or both. USO personnel posing in front of the P.1101 V1 prototype. =Postwar= By the time an American infantry unit discovered the Oberammergau complex on 29 April 1945, the V1 prototype was approximately 80% complete. The wings were not yet attached and appear to have never had skinning applied to their undersides. The airframe was removed from the nearby tunnel in which it was hidden and all associated documents were seized. There was some lobbying by Messerschmitt Chief Designer Woldemar Voigt and Robert J. Woods of Bell Aircraft to have the P.1101 V1 completed by June 1945, but this was precluded by the destruction of some critical documents and the refusal of the French to release the remaining majority of the design documents (microfilmed and buried by the Germans), which they had obtained prior to the arrival of American units to the area. The airframe meanwhile became a favorite prop for GI souvenir photos. Later, the prototype was shipped first to Wright Patterson AFB, then to the Bell Aircraft Works in Buffalo, New York in 1948. Damage ruled out any possibility for repair although some of the Me P.1101's design features were subsequently used by Bell as the basis for the Bell X-5, which was the first aircraft capable of varying its wing geometry while in flight. Variants =Me P.1101 First Design= The 24 July 1944 design by Hans Hornung of a single- seat jet fighter. It was powered by one Heinkel He S 011 turbojet. This was the shortest of all versions with a blunt nose and a v-tail. It had a wingspan of 7.15 m and a length of 6.85 m. The armament was two MK 108 cannon.Messerschmitt Me P.1101 - Luft'46 =Me P.1101 Second Design= A sleeker design, dating from 30 August 1944. Also a v-tailed single-seat jet fighter with a more pointed nose and wings swept back at 40 degrees. It had a wingspan of 8.16 m and a length of 9.37 m. =Me P.1101 Third Design= Full- scale prototype design of a flying test single-seat jet fighter with a wingspan of 8.06 m and a length of 8.98 m. It had a conventional tail and swept wings designed to be set at different angles while on the ground. Test flights were first intended to be undertaken with a 35-degree wing sweep, followed by a 45-degree sweep. The first test flight was to take place in June 1945. =Me P.1101 Fourth Design= The final single-seat jet fighter design that went into production with a wingspan of 8.25 m, a length of 9.175 m and a weight of 1250 kg. =Me P.1101 L= A ramjet-powered single-seat fighter that would have eight additional small rocket engines for takeoff. This design would have a much wider fuselage covering the large Lorin ramjet located to the back of the cockpit, as well as a conventional tail. =Me P.1101/92= A different design of a two-seat v-tailed heavy fighter and destroyer. It was an all-metal aircraft armed with a large 7.5 cm Pak 40 cannon and was powered by two Heinkel He S 011 turbojets. It had a wingspan of 13.28 m and a length of 13.1 m.Me P.1101/92 - Luft'46 =Me P.1101/99= Another very different variant altogether. Two-seat attack/destroyer all-metal aircraft powered by four Heinkel He S 011 turbojets. It had the cockpit at the front end of the fuselage and was armed with a 7.5 cm Pak 40 cannon and one MK 112 55 mm autocannon in the nose, and four additional MK 112 in Schräge Musik configuration behind the cockpit. Its tail was of the conventional type and it had a wingspan of 15.4 m and a length of 15.2 m.Messerschmitt Me P.1101/99 - Luft'46 Specifications (P.1101 fourth design 22 February 1945) Messerschmitt P.1101 See also References Further reading * - Bell X-5 External links * Airborne Unlimited drawing page * Build a scale model of the p. 1101 * Messerschmitt Me P.1101/99 Model 1940s German fighter aircraft P.1101 Variable-sweep-wing aircraft World War II jet aircraft of Germany ","title":"Messerschmitt P.1101"},{"id":"4316844","text":"Belches may refer to: * Peter Belches, early explorer of Western Australia; * Point Belches, a geographic feature in the Swan River. * Belches, physical reactions to buildup of gas in the digestive tract.

It was a relatively small hadrosaur, approximately five meters (16 ft) long, found in what is now Romania. Description The relatively small size of Telmatosaurus with a length of five metres and a weight of half a tonne, has been explained as an instance of insular dwarfism. Discovery Size of Telmatosaurus compared to a human In 1895 some peasants presented Ilona Nopcsa, the daughter of their lord, with a dinosaur skull they had found at the estate Săcele in the district Hunedoara (then named Hunyad) in Transylvania. Ilona had an elder brother, Ferenc or Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás who was inspired by the find to become a paleontology student at the University of Vienna. In 1899 Nopcsa named the skull Limnosaurus transsylvanicus. The generic name was derived from Greek λιμνή, limné, \\"swamp\\", a reference to the presumed swamp-dwelling habits of hadrosaurs. The specific name referred to Transylvania.F. Nopcsa, 1900, \\"Dinosaurierreste aus Siebenbürgen (Schädel von Limnosaurus transsylvanicus nov. gen. et spec.)\\", Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Classe 68: 555-591 Later Nopcsa discovered that the name Limnosaurus had already been used by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1872 for a crocodilian (later reclassified as Pristichampsus), so in 1903 Nopcsa renamed the genus Telmatosaurus. Telma again means \\"marsh\\".F. Nopcsa, 1903, \\"Telmatosaurus, new name for the dinosaur Limnosaurus\\", Geological Magazine, decade 4 10: 94-95 In 1910 Barnum Brown, unaware of Nopcsa's replacement name, named the genus Hecatasaurus,B. Brown, 1910, \\"The Cretaceous Ojo Alamo beds of New Mexico with description of the new dinosaur genus Kritosaurus\\", Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History 28(24): 267-274 but this is a junior objective synonym. The holotype, BMNH B.3386, was found in the Haţeg Basin in a layer of the Sânpetru Formation dating from the Maastrichtian, about 68 million years old, at the time part of the Haţeg Island, one of the islands of the European Archipelago. It consists of a skull with lower jaws. In 1915 Nopcsa referred his species to the genus Orthomerus, as an Orthomerus transsylvanicus.F. Nopcsa, 1915, \\"Die dinosaurier der Siebenbürgischen landesteile Ungarns\\", Mitteilungen aus dem Jahrbuche der Königlich-Ungarischen Geologischen Reichsanstalt 23: 1-24 However, since the 1980s, Orthomerus has been considered a nomen dubium, leading to a revival of the name Telmatosaurus. Fragmentary hadrosauroid material from Spain, France and Germany, that had been referred to Orthomerus, is now often assigned to Telmatosaurus, but an identity is hard to prove; the same is also true of many Romanian fragments and eggs.F.M.

A dinosaurian facial deformity and the first occurrence of ameloblastoma in the fossil record. Scientific reports, 6. bears a large non-cancerous tumor called an ameloblastoma on its lower jaw. The presence of this benign tumor in a dinosaur is a first, as before the discovery, ameloblastomas were known only from modern mammals (including humans) and reptiles. The discovery of an ameloblastoma in a dinosaur gives evidence that the development of benign tumors is a basal characteristic, not just a relatively modern condition. It is unlikely that the tumor caused the dinosaur any serious pain during its early stages of development, just as in humans with the same condition, but researchers can tell from its size that this particular dinosaur died before it reached adulthood. Since its preserved remains consist of only the two lower jaws, no one can ascertain its cause of death. The researchers were left wondering whether the presence of the ameloblastoma could have contributed to its death.

Gelman was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia from a rich noble Jewish family who emigrated in Germany during the October revolution (1917) . During the 1920s, he worked as a still photographer in Europe at a motion picture studios, and became a distributor of French films. He arrived in Mexico just before the outbreak of World War II, and as a result of the conflict, found himself stranded there. In 1943, he became the third partner of Posa Films, along with Mario Moreno and Santiago Reachi Fayad. The company's prime asset was Moreno's comedic talent, and the three producers crafted and marketed the image of Cantinflas. It was Gelman who proposed the recreation of European classics as a way to appeal to audiences outside Latin America. Los tres mosqueteros and Romeo y Julieta were produced during this period, and Los tres mosqueteros was selected to be screened at the first Cannes Film Festival in 1946. The endorsement of Charlie Chaplin secured the feature's billing, but in the eyes of French critics, it failed to live up to Chaplin's proclamation that Moreno was the leading comic of the era. The French people, however, were not as hostile to \\"Cantinflas\\", seeing in him a Mexican version of their Fernandel. In 1958, a rift between Gelman and Reachi concerning some wrongdoing in contracts with Columbia Pictures by Gelman and Moreno, allowed Gelman to produce the film without Reachi as a Producer. dubbing into French over the objections of Reachi who advise him about the possible poor reception of Moreno's dialect to the Europeans. The imitative efforts at universalize failed to appeal to non-Spanish-speaking audiences. Gelman stood beside Moreno throughout his career, accompanying him during the filming of Around the World in 80 Days and to the Golden Globe Awards ceremony. When the three partners disbanded in 1960 over the creation of Pepe, As Reachi formed a new company named Posa Films Internacional, S.A. 1959, all assets of Posa Films, S.A and its obligations, was transferred to the new company (buy-out)1961. After Reachi retired as Producer, President and partner of Posa Films INTERNACIONAL S.A.(1963) Gelman had the opportunity to change his status as a Manager to a new Producer of Cantinflas movies.(1964). Jacques Gelman died on July 22, 1986 in Houston, Texas where he was undergoing a heart operation. He and his wife Natasha were avid collectors of Mexican art, and became its patrons when they commissioned Diego Rivera to paint her portrait. Mexican painter Gunther Gerzso, a friend of Gelman, painted his portrait and gave it to him as a gift. Upon Mrs. Gelman's death in 1998, their collection was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and has since been exhibited at the Seattle Art Museum and New York City's Museo del Pueblo. A great part of their collection is also on exhibit in the newly founded museum \\"Muros\\" in Cuernavaca, following Natasha Gelman's wish.

However, its similarity to Polacanthus has been noted since Lucas renamed in 1902, the two being most similar in armor, although Hoplitosaurus lacks the sacral shield of armor found in Polacanthus.

The Hawaiian language name is believed to mean \\"long mound\\", where means to swell, as a wave, heap, or mound, and means long.  Geography  Āhualoa is located at 20°03' North, 155°28' West (20.06, -155.48). The Old Māmalahoa Highway is the principal road running through Āhualoa. The land is zoned agricultural. A typical lot is in size. Land use is for residence and small-scale agriculture, including farming, orchards and livestock.  History  There is no record of Native Hawaiian settlement in the area that is now Āhualoa. It is likely that the Native Hawaiians visited the area for extraction of resources from the ōhia lehua-hāpuu native forest, but did not live there, as wet forest was not considered a desirable place to live. According to research for an archaeological survey in 2002, the area that is now Āhualoa: :appears to have been carved out of the upper reaches of at least four ahupuaa: Lauka, Kuliahai, Koloaha, and Āhualoa. These are all relatively narrow and short land units that are cut off on the mauka sides by the larger ahupuaa of Nienie, which in turn is cut off on its mauka side by the ahupuaa of Pāauhau. [...] The forest zone in Hāmākua was traditionally a location for collecting wauke and māmaki bark for fish nets and cloth, for bird catching to obtain feathers, and for harvesting koa canoe logs. The land of Āhualoa differs from many other parts of Hawaii in that it was never used for either sugarcane plantations or large-scale cattle ranching. Instead, in the late 19th and early 20th century it was allocated to families of sugarcane workers as farm homesteads, and remains largely so today. The families, primarily Japanese and Portuguese in ethnicity, were the first inhabitants of the area, and many of the present residents are descended from those families. The original native forest was cleared and replaced by a patchwork of pasture, farms and windbreaks. Small- scale ranching did occur, and included a slaughterhouse that operated for a century before closing in 2008. Āhualoa was also the location for early plantings of coffee, which is still being grown there today. In the 1970s, many countercultural families from Oahu and the mainland US moved to the Āhualoa area. They brought values and ideals of the back-to-the-land movement. A book of material gathered in 2003, Once Upon Ahualoa, explores the experience of this generation with memories and photographs. Infrastructure Although the main road through Āhualoa has services (electricity, water, telephone, cable internet), many residents living on side roads depend on rainwater tanks as a supply of water. During 2008–12, improvements were made to the water supply, supported by federal stimulus funding, including a new deep well at the top of Āhualoa, a 1 million gallon storage tank, and an upgrade of the main waterline to a 12\\" pipe.Hamakua Times, One Million Gallon Water Tank coming online  References   External links  * Ahualoa.net a site located in Āhualoa serving information about the community.

A modified version of the song was re-released by The Emmet Spiceland Ballad Group and reached number 1 in the Irish singles music chart on February 24, 1968. This success prompted the creation of the Mary From Dungloe International Festival, an Irish music festival held in Dungloe, in northwest Ireland. There exists two versions of the song, the original long version by Pádraig MacCumhaill and a shorter version by Colm O'Laughlin, the latter version is the most popular today.  Story of the song  The original 'Mary' in question is said to be a Mary Gallagher, a native of Dungloe, she was courted by a man (from the Gweedore area) who had just returned from the United States but her parents refused to let them marry and he left to return to the US on October 6, 1861. On December 5, 1861 she emigrated to New Zealand to join her relatives there. On the boat she met and married Dónal Egan. She gave birth to a baby but died within four months while her son only survived a few more months. Lyrics = Original Pádraig MacCumhaill Lyrics = Oh, then fare ye well, sweet Donegal, the Rosses and Gweedore. I'm crossing the main ocean, where the foaming billows roar, it breaks my heart from you to part, where I spent many happy days. Farewell to kind relations for I'm bound for Amerikay. Ah, then Mary, you're my heart's delight, my pride and only care, it was your cruel father would not let me stay there. But absence makes the heart grow fond and when I'm o'er the main, may the Lord protect my darling girl till I return again. And I wished I was in sweet Dungloe and seated on the grass. And by my side a bottle of wine and on my knee a lass. I'd call for liquor of the best and I'd pay before I go and I'd roll my Mary in my arms in the town of sweet Dungloe. O me maid is tall and beautiful and her age is scarce eighteen She far exceeds all other fair maid as she trips o'er the green Her lovely neck and shoulders are fairer than the snow Til the day I die, I'll ne'r deny O me Mary from Dungloe. = Colm Ó Lochlainn Lyrics = Oh then fare thee well sweet Donegal, the Rosses and Gweedore, I'm crossing the main ocean where the foaming billows roar, It breaks my heart from you to part where I spent many happy days. Farewell to kind relations, I am bound for Amerikay.

Mompox depends upon tourism, fishing and some commerce generated by the local cattle raising. It has about 30,000 inhabitants, and is adjacent to the municipalities of Pinillos and San Fernando. Simón Bolívar, liberator of much of Spanish South America, said \\"If to Caracas I owe my life, then to Mompox I owe my glory.\\" Simón Bolívar arrived in Mompox in 1812 and recruited nearly all of the able bodied men, some four hundred, who formed the basis of the army for his victory in Caracas.  History  Mampo (or Mompoj) was the local indigenous chieftain of the Malibu culture, when the Spanish conquistadors arrived, and Mompox means \\"land of the ruler Mampo\\". The city was founded on May 3, 1537 by Alonso de Heredia, brother of Pedro de Heredia, as a safe port on the Magdalena. Fundaciones de ciudades y poblaciones - Banco de la República Santa Cruz de Mompox became quite prosperous as a port for the transportation of goods upriver into the interior. A royal mint was established here and the town was famous for its goldsmiths. This prosperity had begun to wane in the nineteenth century, but continued until early in the twentieth century when the river shifted and sediment accumulated on this arm of the river, at which point Magangué became the favored port.  Buildings and architecture  Iglesia de Santa Bárbara in 1845, Watercolor by Edward Walhouse Mark. Santa Cruz de Mompox is known for the preservation of its colonial architectural features, as expressed by the mixture of its Spanish and Indian styles. UNESCO named the historic center of Mompox as a World Heritage Site in 1995. Today, most of the colonial buildings are still used for their original purposes, which provides an excellent example of a Spanish colonial city. Of particular note is the wrought iron work decorating doors, railings and window grills along the streets, notably on Calle de la Albarrada, Calle Real del Medio and Calle de Atrás. Notable churches include Santa Bárbara (built 1613), San Agustín (built 1606), San Juan de Dios and Immaculate Conception. There is also a museum of colonial art which houses religious gold colonial masterpieces. * The San Francisco Church was originally built in 1564 and the convent was founded in 1580 by Fray Francisco Gonzaga. The church is known for its handsome mural which was unfortunately damaged during reconstruction work in 1996. Since then the foundations have been reinforced and restoration is, for the time being, complete. * San Juan de Dios Hospital was founded in 1550. In 1663 La Orden de todos los Hermanos Hospitalarios (Order of the Hospital Brothers) took over its management. It depended on the donations of the powerful families in the region and the royal tax charged on shipping along the Magdalena River for its maintenance and operation. San Juan de Dios is considered to be the oldest hospital in America still functioning in its original building. * The House of the Apostles located on Calle Real del Medio was the mansion of a local shipping family, and is visited by tourists to see the handsome images of the twelve apostles and of Jesus at the Last Supper. * City Hall contained the colonial dungeons and the mayor’s reception room. It was here that on August 6, 1810 the Act of Independence from Spain was signed, and the cry \\"Ser Libres o Morir\\" (\\"Freedom or Death\\") was first heard. * The Municipal Palace, also known as the Cloister of San Carlos, was built in 1660. This cloister housed the city’s first secondary school until the Jesuits were driven out. It ceased to be a convent in 1767. Here in 1809 the Universal School of Saint Peter the Apostle was founded by Pedro Martínez de Pinillos. * The Church of the Immaculate Conception was originally built of adobe by Pedro de Heredia in 1541. Ten years later it was enlarged and masonry replaced much of the adobe, and the straw roof was replaced with tile. Because of its large size it was often regarded as the cathedral of Mompox. Over the years, the original building was restored several times, with the last restoration completed in 1795. In 1839 the Governor of the Province ordered its demolition and the present church was built on the site. * The Santa Bárbara Church is one of the best-known and most important churches in the city. Completed in 1613, the church has a beautiful baroque bell tower with a balcony. It is decorated with moldings of palm trees, flowers and lions. The tower’s dome is equally baroque, and the church’s three altars are heavily gilded. Santa Barbara Church  Music  Mompox is famous in Colombia as the home of the musician/singer Totó la Momposina and her band. Their music is a fusion of African and Spanish influences as well as the harmonies of the natives of the region, and is associated with cumbia music.

It and its predecessors were a vital commercial and passenger linkage between Philadelphia and Baltimore for over 100 years. Earlier bridges on the site Several bridges have been built on the site, with the first wooden covered bridge erected in the early 1830s to replace a nearby smaller toll bridge immediately upriver that had been destroyed by ice. Set on 26 stone piers, the new massive oaken structure was the longest covered bridge in the world (over a mile and a quarter in length). It used timber salvaged from the previous bridge and provided a link for the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad to the Northern Central Railway, as well as for carriages, pedestrians and wagons. A towpath on the southern wall enabled teams of horses or mules to pull boats from the Mainline Canal on the Columbia side to the Tidewater and Susquehanna Canal on the Wrightsville side. This bridge was burned by state militia under Col. Jacob G. Frick and Maj. Granville O. Haller on June 28, 1863, to block elements of the Confederate States Army under Brig. Gen. John Brown Gordon from crossing into Lancaster County shortly before the Battle of Gettysburg. For the rest of the war, cargo and passengers had to be laboriously ferried across the broad Susquehanna River. The Columbia Bridge Company constructed another wooden bridge on the same stone piers in the years just after the Civil War, restoring the railroad line. The Pennsylvania Railroad purchased this replacement bridge in 1879, but it was destroyed by a severe windstorm in 1896. These bridges were each known as the \\"Columbia- Wrightsville Bridge.\\" Pennsylvania Railroad Bridge First train across the new bridge. The last bridge on the site was built in 1896, just 29 days after the destruction of the previous wooden bridge. A steel truss bridge made of long prefabricated sections, it carried a single railroad track for the Pennsylvania Railroad, as well as a two-lane roadway. It was designed to be resistant to fire, floods, and ice, elements that had destroyed previous wooden structures. Like the previous bridges, tolls were collected for passage to recover a portion of the half million dollar investment. As originally envisioned, the new bridge was to have had two decks, the bottom one for trains and the upper for other traffic. The top deck was never added, and freight and passenger trains shared the planked lower deck with carriages, wagons, and [later] with automobiles and trucks crossing the river on the Lincoln Highway. In 1930, automobile traffic was rerouted to the newly constructed Veterans Memorial Bridge, just downstream. The steel bridge reverted to only being used by the railroad, although usage eventually diminished considerably as commercial truck traffic on the Veterans Memorial Bridge (then part of US 30) increased. The track was removed and the bridge dismantled in 1963. The stone piers are still present in the river. A historical marker now commemorates the history of the bridge.

He was the seventh and youngest son of the eleven children of James Rivett (17591802) of the East India Company (EIC) by his wife Henrietta Fisher (17651837), daughter of James Fisher, of Bombay. His eldest brother was James Rivett-Carnac who would become the Sir James Rivett-Carnac, 1st Bt., and a Governor of Bombay. His father assumed the name of Rivett-Carnac by Sign Manual on in compliance with the last will and testament of General John Carnac. General Carnac had married his father's sister ElizabethA portrait of Mrs Carnac by Sir Joshua Reynolds hangs in the Wallace Collection in London and in 1776 his father went to live with them in Bombay, where he remained until his death in 1802. Throughout his life, John Rivett-Carnac and his sons used the name of Rivett-Carnac, while his elder brothers were inconsistent in their surname. John Rivett-Carnac emigrated to England with his mother in 1804, two years after his father's death. French frigate Bellone, renamed HMS Junon He entered the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth in 1810, and in 1813 was appointed midshipman on the 38-gun . He saw action in the War of 1812, taking part in operations under Sir George Cockburn and Lieutenant Philip Westphal. In October 1814 he joined the 38-gun , with whom he went to Greenland to search for the American Commodore John Rodgers. He later transferred to the 74-gun , then the 98-gun , and finally the 100-gun . After passing his Navy examinations in May 1816, he was involved in the Bombardment of Algiers. From 1816 to 1818, Rivett-Carnac served as an admiralty-midshipman on the , and later on the . On he was promoted to lieutenant in the . In January 1819 he joined the , and in November 1821 transferred to the . He served on that ship until August 1825, when he was transferred to the . On 23 January 1826, John Rivett-Carnac joined under Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling as First Lieutenant. Three months later he married Maria Jane Davis, daughter of EIC director and orientalist Samuel Davis at St. Marylebone, London. Rivett-Carnac was on board the Success in March 1827 when the Success arrived at the Swan River in what is now Western Australia, to undertake the Swan River expedition of 1827, an exploring expedition for the purpose of assessing the area's suitability for establishing a British colony there. The Success explored the coastal waters off the Swan, during which time Stirling renamed the island named \\"Isle Berthelot\\" by the French in 1801 to Carnac Island in honour of Rivett-Carnac. Stirling then formed a party to explore up the Swan River, leaving the Success under Rivett-Carnac's command. In April 1827, Rivett-Carnac received a military award and was promoted to Commander. Later that year, the Success spent two months in Penang, during which time sickness hit the crew. Rivett- Carnac was so ill that on 1 November he was sent home on half pay. In September 1830 he was appointed Second-Captain on the . After leaving the ship in January 1832 he did not go to sea again, settling in London. Rivett-Carnac was promoted to Captain on 1 October 1837, Rear-Admiral on 18 June 1857, and Vice-Admiral on the Reserved List on 30 November 1863. He was promoted to full Admiral on 8 April 1868, but died eight months later on 1 January 1869.

However, Datousaurus's elongated vertebrae gave it a higher reach and its teeth were more spoon shaped. This may be a sign that these contemporaries fed on different plants and/or at different heights in the trees. This strategy may have reduced competition between the two genera. A similar pattern of height difference possibly associated with feeding behaviors is found in the diplodocids.

Olympic qualification race controversy In December 2001, Shani Davis traveled to Utah to race for a spot on the 2002 Winter Olympics short track team. Teammates Smith and Apolo Ohno already had slots on the six-man team due to points earned from earlier races, and Ron Biondo was a lock for the third spot. In order for Davis to qualify, he would have to actually win the final race. As both Ohno and Smith were also participating, Davis would have to beat them both. Since Ohno had been dominant in the meet to this point, winning every race he entered with ease, a win by Davis seemed to be a long shot. However, the 1,000m race would end with Ohno coming in third, Smith second and Davis at the top of the podium. However, the victory was short- lived, as rumors began to swirl that Ohno and Smith, both good friends of Davis', intentionally threw the race so that Davis would win.Price, S.L.

Ohno would later confess that he subconsciously held back for fear of suddenly crashing into Davis or Smith, a common occurrence in the sport, pointing out that he did not need to win the race because he already had a spot on the team. Question persisted that if Ohno had really held back, why did he keep passing Ron Biondo? Some speculated that Ohno was holding off Biondo from challenging Smith, as Smith also needed to finish ahead of Biondo in order to secure a spot in the 1000m for Salt Lake. Even this scenario would have been a violation of the rules of team skating. Both claims went unproven in the arbitration case, and all three were absolved of guilt. On February 13, 2002 Sports Illustrated writer Brian Cazeneuve published an article stating that, after reviewing the race, \\"To this day, there is no concrete proof that any skaters violated the spirit of competition.\\"Cazeneuve, Brian (2002). \\"More on the great short-track speed skating controversy\\" SportsIllustrated.CNN.com (accessed May 30, 2007) Cazeneuve would, however, also publish the comments of Outside Life Network commentator Todd Harris and 1998 Winter Olympian speed skater Eric Flaim, which were made during the broadcast of the race; both men agreed that Ohno and Smith had not skated at 100%.

Naming and description  The genus was named in 1927 by Friedrich von Huene, but without a description, so that it remained a nomen nudum.Huene, F. von, 1927, \\"Sichtung der Grundlagen der Jetzigen Kenntnis der Sauropoden\\", Eclogae geologicae Helvetiae, 20: 444-470 In 1929 the type species, Laplatasaurus araukanicus, was described by Huene.Huene, F. von, 1929, Los Saurisquios y Ornithisquios de Cretaceo Argentino, Anales Museo de La Plata, 2nd series, v. 3, p. 1-196 The generic name refers to La Plata. The specific name is derived from the Araucanos or Mapuche. By accident Huene in 1929 also mentioned a \\"Laplatasaurus wichmannianus\\" but that was a lapsus calami for Antarctosaurus wichmannianus. In 1933 however, he and Charles Alfred Matley renamed Titanosaurus madagascariensis to Laplatasaurus madagascariensis.Huene, F. von, and Mately C. A., 1933, \\"The Cretaceous Saurischia and Ornithischia of the central provinces of India\\", Palaeontologia Indica, 21: 1-74 This last species is today commonly referred to the original Titanosaurus. Huene based Laplatasaurus on fragmentary material found in three locations in Argentina, in strata of the Allen Formation, dating from the Campanian faunal stage. It consisted of limb elements, some dorsal vertebrae and a series of caudal vertebrae. Part of the finds had earlier been referred by Richard Lydekker to Titanosaurus australis. Huene never assigned a holotype, but in 1979 José Fernando Bonaparte chose MLP 26-306 as the lectotype, a specimen consisting of a tibia and a fibula that perhaps originate from different individuals. Huene assigned those fossils to Laplatasaurus that seemed to indicate a rather large yet at the same time elegantly built sauropod. The about eighteen metres (60 ft) long Laplatasaurus was perhaps similar to Saltasaurus. Osteoderms forming an armored plating on the back, have been referred to Laplatasaurus but the association is uncertain. These plates had much smaller ridges than those of Saltasaurus.  Taxonomy  Huene placed Laplatasaurus in the Titanosauridae, which is still a common classification. In his 2003 review of South American titanosaurs, Jaime Eduardo Powell assigned Laplatasaurus to Titanosaurus, creating the new combination Titanosaurus aurakanicus.Powell, J. E., 2003, \\"Revision of South American titanosaurid dinosaurs: palaeobiological, palaeobiogeographical and phylogenetic aspects\\", Records of the Queen Victoria Museum 111: 1-173 Others however, continued to treat Laplatasaurus as valid genus separate from Titanosaurus.Wilson, J.

While stamps of this design were the common 1-cent stamps of the 1860s, the Z-Grill is distinguished by having the so-called \\"Z\\" variety of a grill pressed into the stamp, creating tiny indentations in the paper. Although the 1-cent Z-Grill is generally cited as the rarest and most valuable of all US postage stamps, the 15-cent Lincoln Z-Grill is just as rare and the 10-cent Washington Z-Grill scarcely less so. All three of these stamps were produced at the same time, along with more common Z-grill versions of the contemporary 2-cent, 3-cent, 5-cent and 12-cent stamps (The earliest known postmarks on Z-grill stamps date from January 1868). The \\"Z\\" pattern, unique among grill templates used by the Post Office because it incises horizontal ridges into the stamp rather than vertical ridges, was replaced within a very short time, for stamps with the D- and E-Grills were already being postmarked in mid-February. The purpose of grilling was to permit the canceling ink to be better absorbed into the stamp paper, thus preventing reuse of stamps by washing out the cancellation marks. The use of grills was found to be impractical and they were gradually discontinued after 1870. Known stamps The Z Grill: Gross collection There are currently only two known 1-cent 1868 Z-Grills, both with cancellation marks. One is owned by the New York Public Library as part of the Benjamin Miller Collection. This leaves only a single 1-cent 1868 Z-Grill in private hands. This 1868 1 cent Z-Grill stamp sold for $935,000 in 1998 to Mystic Stamp Company, a stamp dealer. Siegel Auctions auctioned the stamp as part of the Robert Zoellner collection. Zachary Sundman, the eleven-year-old son of Mystic Stamp Company President Donald Sundman, was the individual responsible for wielding the paddle and doing the actual bidding. Later, in late October 2005, Sundman traded this Z-Grill to financier Bill Gross for a block of four Inverted Jenny stamps worth nearly $3 million. By completing this trade Gross became the owner of the only complete collection of U.S. 19th century stamps. Both Z-Grills were on display at the National Postal Museum along with the first part of the Benjamin Miller Collection from 27 May 2006 until 1 October 2007. Stamp numbering In the Scott catalogue of U. S. Stamps, the 1¢ Z Grill is listed as #85A: it is one of the very few issues that does not bear a unique number but must share its numeral (85) with other stamps of different denominations. This anomaly arose because Scott created its system long before the Z pattern gained general recognition as a separate variety of grill (which did not occur until the 1910s). Accordingly, Scott assigned capital letters to the Z Grill denominations and inserted them into the catalogue after #85 (the 3¢ D Grill). The 1¢ Z Grill appeared as #85A and the 2¢ through 15¢ Z Grills were designated 85B through 85F. This expedient enabled Scott to retain the existing numbers for all subsequent stamps, beginning with the E Grill issues (#86-91).

It is a titanosaurian that lived near the end of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 71 million years ago in the early Maastrichtian. Found in the province of Neuquen, Argentina in the Allen Formation. Due to the presence of armour, at first it was thought that it was an ankylosaur, but today it is considered to be the armour of a titanosaur. Armour The armour of Loricosaurus has caused some controversy. When Huene first described it, he considered it to be from an ankylosaur. Later, it was discovered to not belong to ankylosaurs, but to belong to titanosaurs.Holtz, Thomas R Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete,Up-to-date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers Of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. Now it is considered to possibly belong to Neuquensaurus or Saltasaurus. Species In 1929 von Huene described Loricosaurus based on some armour osteoderms found in Argentina. The type species, Loricosaurus scutatus, is now considered possibly a synonym of Neuquensaurus.

It is based on fragmentary remains and has often been confused with or included in Megalosaurus. History and taxonomy restoration In 1923, Friedrich von Huene named Megalosaurus nethercombensis from a partial skeleton (OUM J12143) from the Aalenian-Bajocian-age Middle Jurassic Inferior Oolite, found in the nineteenth century by W. Parker near Nethercomb, north of Sherborne, in Dorset, England. The material included partial dentaries, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, a partial ilium, a partial right pubis, internal casts of the femora, and tibiae, from a possible juvenile individual. Huene interpreted it as a more primitive species of Megalosaurus.von Huene, F. (1923). Carnivorous Saurischia in Europe since the Triassic. Bulletin of the Geological Society of America 34:449-458. In 1926, he named the tooth species Megalosaurus lydekkeri for a specimen, BMNH 41352, from the Lower Lias (Lower Jurassic) of England that Richard Lydekker had first described in 1888.von Huene, F. (1926). The carnivorous Saurischia in the Jura and Cretaceous formations, principally in Europe. Revista del Museo de La Plata 29:35-167.Lydekker, R. (1888).

Containing the Orders Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Dinosauria, Squamata, Rhynchocephalia, and Proterosauria. British Museum (Natural History):London, 309 p. Finally, in 1932, he created the genus Magnosaurus for M. nethercombensis, referred M. lydekkeri to it, and created a third species, M. woodwardi, for the genus. M. woodwardi was based on a tibia (BMNH R.3542) from the Lower Lias, which he simultaneously and accidentally also named Sarcosaurus andrewsi;von Huene, F. (1932). Die fossile Reptil-Ordnung Saurischia, ihre Entwicklung und Geschichte. Monographien zur Geologie und Palaeontologie 1(4) [German] in 1956 the latter name was given priority by von Huene. Even more confusing, in the same 1932 publication von Huene renamed Sarcosaurus woodi into Magnosaurus woodi. Until the 1990s, the genus had been ignored as a species of Megalosaurus.Waldman, M. (1974). \\"Megalosaurids from the Bajocian (Middle Jurassic) of Dorset\\". Palaeontology 17(2):325-339. However, with growing concern over what exactly is constituted by Megalosaurus, Magnosaurus has been generally separated as its own genus.Molnar, R.E., Kurzanov, S.M., and Dong, Z. (1990). \\"Carnosauria\\". In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.), The Dinosauria. University of California Press:Berkeley and Los Angeles, p. 169-209. Rauhut, O.W.M.

(eds.), The Dinosauria (second edition). Berkeley: University of California Press:Berkeley, p. 71-110. Also, there are morphological differences: for example, possible Megalosaurus tibiae are compressed at the far end, unlike those of Magnosaurus. Rauhut (2003) considered it and Eustreptospondylus to be the same genus, because the two share a similarly expanded front tip of the dentary and enlarged third dentary tooth. He therefore renamed Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis a Magnosaurus oxoniensis but this has not been generally followed. Reviews have found it to most likely be a basal tetanuran, probably a megalosaurid.Paul, G.S. (1988). Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. Simon & Schuster:New York, 464 p. A detailed redescription by Roger Benson in 2010 concluded Magnosaurus was valid taxon, a megalosaurid megalosauroid, and at about 175 million years old the oldest certain known member of the Tetanurae.Benson, Roger B.

In such cases the combinations are: *Magnosaurus woodi (Andrews, 1921) = Sarcosaurus woodi Andrews, 1921 *Magnosaurus oxoniensis (Walker, 1964) Rahut, 2003 = Eustreptospondylus oxoniensis Walker, 1964 *Magnosaurus bucklandi (Meyer, 1832) Weishampel et al., 2004 = lapsus calami, Megalosaurus bucklandi Meyer, 1832 = Megalosaurus bucklandii Mantell, 1827 Description afrovenatorines Because the remains are sparse and fragmentary, most details about its anatomical features are unknown. It would have been a bipedal carnivore of moderate size for a dinosaur. The most similar animals to it would probably be Eustreptospondylus, Dubreuillosaurus, and Afrovenator. Paul (1988) roughly estimated the mass of the type individual as around 175 kg (386 lb), which would correspond to a length of roughly four metres (13.1 ft), judging by his estimates for the sizes of other theropods. Benson however, in 2010 gave a higher estimation of about half a tonne; the animal would have stood at over a metre at the hip.

It was an independent film, produced by Lydia Dean Pilcher and shot by Declan Quinn in his film debut.. Plot The film is set in a small coastal community in New Jersey where the only action in town is a nightclub called The Pavilion. The owner, Pete (played by Jackson Sims), can barely make the payroll so in an effort to bring in more business, he hires a sultry stripper named Danny Lee (Cathy Haase). Danny Lee's act soon turns the head of Ralph, which is not good news for his bed-ridden wife Luanne (Loretta Gross). Luanne's nasty talent is her gift for gossip, and when she begins to suspect that Ralph has adultery on his mind, she starts spreading more ugly rumors that have just enough basis in fact to stick. Soon things spin out of control and a wave of violence begins.

At that time, the film was one of three Jim Thompson novel adaptations to be made into a film within one year. The others were The Grifters and After Dark, My Sweet. =Film noir look= This neo-noir is very darkly filmed by Declan Quinn and at times the images shot of anyone more than a few feet from the camera can be difficult to see. As such, it mirrors the stylistic photography of the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s. =Filming locations= The filming locations include: The Keansburg Amusement Park, Keansburg, New Jersey; and other locations in New Jersey. Reception =Critical response= The film received some good press. Critic Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film, \\"...a down-and-dirty thriller...\\". And film critic Marjorie Baumgarten liked the film and the direction of Maggie Greenwald and wrote in the Austin Chronicle, \\"[the] protagonists and pernicious moral rot are well-captured in Greenwald's film version of The Kill-Off. The milieu is compellingly perverse, and Greenwald and the actors get the seedy tone just right.\\"Baumgarten, Marjorie. Austin Chronicle, film review, July 12, 1991. The New York Times was less impressed with the film. Critic Caryn James wrote, \\"[Thompspon's lurid drama] is tossed away by Ms. Greenwald's flaccid script and scenes so badly paced that the actors seem to be holding their breath between lines, waiting for their next cues\\"James, Caryn.

Distribution The producers used the following tagline when marketing the film: :The closer you look, the less you want to know. The film premiered at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1989. Later, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival and Maggie Greenwald was awarded the Dramatic Grand Jury Prize. The film opened in a limited release on October 19, 1990 in New York City but it was never widely shown. The film was not released onto videocassette in the United States until 2001, when Xenon Entertainment released it onto VHS. The film has yet to premiere onto DVD. Comparison to novel Thompson's noted style was his ironic plots and language, yet Greenwald's film eliminates many of the intertwined plots that run through the book and contains very little of its dialogue. In addition, the film differs from the book in a few ways. First, the movie shows us who the murderer is where the book leaves that a mystery. Second, the movie also spares one of the characters that the book does not, thus turning the character into a moral center.

In 1885, she purchased a nursery; within a few years she was the owner of a flower shop as well as growing fields and nurseries in Coronado, Pacific Beach, and Mission Hills.Christman (1985), p. 18.Pourade (1965), p. 32. The Mission Hills Nursery, which she founded in 1910 and sold to her employees the Antonicelli brothers in 1926, is still in operation.Pioneer Park history In 1892 Sessions struck a deal with the City of San Diego to lease of land in Balboa Park (then called City Park) as her growing fields. In return, she agreed to plant 100 trees a year in the mostly barren park, as well as 300 trees a year in other parts of San Diego. This arrangement left the park with an array of cypress, pine, oak, pepper trees and eucalyptus grown in her gardens from seeds imported from around the world; virtually all of the older trees still seen in the park were planted by her. Among many other plant introductions, she is credited with importing and popularizing the jacaranda, now very familiar in the city. She also collected, propagated, and introduced many California native plants to the horticulture trade and into gardens. In 1900, she took a trip to Baja California to find a palm tree not native in San Diego to be planted at the park. She would also later take a seven-month trip through Europe where she collected multiple plant varieties that she eventually helped plant in the park. Together with Alfred D. Robinson she co-founded the San Diego Floral Association in 1907; it is the oldest garden club in Southern California. The garden club was influential in teaching San Diegans how to grow ornamental and edible plants, at a time when most San Diego landscaping consisted of dirt and sagebrush. Sessions worked with architect Hazel Wood Waterman on the garden design for a group of houses built by San Diego socialite Alice Lee near Balboa Park. Personal life Sessions never marriedChristman (1985), p. 16. and lived to be 82, when she died in San Diego on March 24, 1940. She is interred in Mount Hope Cemetery. Honors Her work with plant introduction, as well as her extensive writing on the subject, won her international recognition. At the California Pacific International Exposition on September 22, 1935, the day was dedicated to Sessions, where she was named the \\"Mother of Balboa Park\\".Christman (1985), p. 88. In 1939, she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Frank N. Meyer medal of the American Genetic Association.Christman (1985), p. 20. In the San Diego area, the Kate Sessions Elementary school in Pacific Beach bears her name, as does Kate O. Sessions Memorial Park on Mount Soledad, located less than a mile from the school and constructed only a few years later. A bronze statue of Sessions, dedicated in 1998, is situated in a prominent location in Balboa Park, in the southwest corner of Sefton Plaza, near the Sixth Avenue entrance to the park. In 2006, the Women's Museum of California inducted Sessions into the San Diego County Women's Hall of Fame, under the title of Trailblazer. In popular culture A 2013 children's picture book, The Tree Lady: The True Story of How One Tree- Loving Woman Changed a City Forever, tells the story of Kate's life, education, and contribution to San Diego civic life.

Microvenator was an oviraptorosaurian theropod. The holotype fossil is an incomplete skeleton, most likely a juvenile, with a living length of about 1.2 m. The adult size of Microvenator is estimated to be closer to 3 m long. Microvenator celer is primitive and may be the \\"sister taxon to all other oviraptorosaurs.\\" Restoration. Barnum Brown collected the type specimen (AMNH 3041) of this animal in 1933 and included what are now known to be Deinonychus teeth with the specimen, and thought that his new animal had a small body with an unusually large head. Thus, he informally dubbed it \\"Megadontosaurus\\" (\\"big-toothed lizard\\"). He had illustrations made of it, but never published the name, a fate shared with several other Cloverly dinosaurs (Deinonychus, Sauropelta and Tenontosaurus). AMNH 3041 includes parts of the skull. hand, foot, left fibula, 23 vertebrae, 4 ribs, and fairly complete ilia, pubes, femora, tibiae, the left ankle, left humerus, radius, and ulna. In 1970 John Ostrom described the type specimen and gave it its formal name. Ostrom also referred a single tooth from the Yale Peabody Museum collection, YPM 5366, to this new species.Ostrom (1970). The illustrations that Brown had prepared were finally published in a detailed and exhaustive monograph by Mackovicky and Sues in 1998. They were unable to confirm that YPM 5366 belongs to Microvenator. They confirmed that Microvenator is an oviraptorosaurian, and that it is the earliest known member of this group from North America.Mackovicky and Sues (1998).

It lived during the Late Cretaceous (85-80 Ma) and two species are known: M. suessi and M. vorosi.  Discovery and species  In 1859 coal mine administrator Pawlowitsch notified the University of Vienna that some fossils had been found in the Gute Hoffnung mine at Muthmannsdorf in Austria. A team headed by geologists Eduard Suess and Ferdinand Stoliczka subsequently uncovered numerous bones of several species, among them those of a euornithopod dinosaur. Stored at the university museum, the finds remained undescribed until they were studied by Emanuel Bunzel from 1870 onwards. Bunzel in 1871 named the euornithopod a new species of Iguanodon: Iguanodon suessii.E. Bunzel, 1871, \\"Die Reptilfauna der Gosauformation in der Neuen Welt bei Wiener-Neustadt\\", Abhandlungen der Kaiserlich-Königlichen Geologischen Reichsanstalt 5: 1-18 The specific name honours Suess and is today more often spelled suessi. In 1881 Harry Govier Seeley named a separate genus: Mochlodon. The generic name is derived from Greek mokhlos, \\"bar\\", and odon, \\"tooth\\", a reference to the bar-like median ridge on the teeth. The type species is Mochlodon suessi. Mochlodon and Struthiosaurus, the latter found at the same site, are the only dinosaur genera named from Austrian finds. The type specimen PIUW 2349 was found in the Grünbach Formation of the Gosau Group dating from the Lower Campanian, about 80 million years old. It consists of a dentary, two vertebrae (presently lost), a parietal, a scapula, an ulna, a manual ungual, a femur and a tibia. Bunzel did not assign a holotype. In 2005 the dentary was chosen as the lectotype. Vertebrae of Mochlodon vorosi At the end of the nineteenth century Baron Franz Nopcsa noted the similarity of fossils found in Romania to both the French Rhabdodon and the Austrian Mochlodon. In 1899 he named some of these Mochlodon inkeyi, the specific name honouring Béla Inkey, but the same year changed the name into Rhabdodon inkeyi. In 1900 Nopcsa named some Romanian remains Mochlodon robustumF. Nopcsa, 1900, \\"Dinosaurierreste aus Siebenbürgen (Schädel von Limnosaurus transsylvanicus nov. gen. et spec.)\\", Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften. Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Classe 68: 555-591 (emended to M. robustus in 1990 by George Olshevsky). In 1915 however, he concluded that all this material could be referred to Rhabdodon, the Austrian remains to Rhabdodon priscus. In later years, Mochlodon was often considered a nomen dubium. In 2003, when M. robustus was renamed Zalmoxes, Mochlodon was tentatively reinstated as a separate genus for the species Mochlodon suessi. In 2005 a study concluded that no unique derived features, autapomorphies, could be established for Mochlodon in relation to Zalmoxes, assigning the Austrian remains provisionally to a Zalmoxes sp.; a definite identification would give Mochlodon nomenclatural priority. A second species, M. vorosi, was described from the Santonian aged Csehbánya Formation of Hungary in 2012.

It is an obscure tooth genus sometimes referred to the Lower Cretaceous English wastebasket taxon Pelorosaurus.  History and taxonomy  The French paleontologist H. E. Sauvage based this genus on a single worn tooth, apparently now lost, which he compared to those of Hypselosaurus.Sauvage, H.E. (1874). Memoire sur les dinosauriens et les crocodiliens des terrains jurassiques de Boulogne-sur-Mer. Mémoires de la Société Géologique de France, second series. 10:1-58. [French] Oddly, despite illustrations of the tooth, and the implications of comparing it to a titanosaur with narrow-crowned teeth, it was included as a synonym of Pelorosaurus in two major reviews.Romer, A.S. (1956). Osteology of the Reptiles. University of Chicago Press:Chicago 1-772. Steel, R. (1970). Part 14. Saurischia. Handbuch der Paläoherpetologie/Encyclopedia of Paleoherpetology. Part 14. Gustav Fischer Verlag:Stuttgart p. 1-87. Pelorosaurus, being a putative brachiosaurid, is assumed to have had broad- crowned teeth. Age, however, was not an issue, because it was referred to the possible Pelorosaurus species P. manseli (=\\"Ischyrosaurus\\"), which was also from the Upper Jurassic (the question of whether \\"Ischyrosaurus\\" or any Jurassic species should be included in Pelorosaurus at all is another issue). The most recent review considers it to be a nomen dubium without further comment.Upchurch, P.M., Barrett, P.M., and Dodson, P. (2004). Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd edition). University of California Press:Berkeley 259-322. Sauvage also suggested that a partial right humerus belonged to the type individual. Paleobiology Morinosaurus would have been a large, quadrupedal herbivore. Having titanosaur-like teeth may suggest more titanosaurian- or diplodocoid- like feeding habits, but this is speculative. The tooth crown was 50 mm (1.97 im) tall and had a cross-section of .

The SSAT consists of a brief unscored writing sample and multiple choice sections that include quantitative (mathematics), reading comprehension, and verbal questions and a experimental section at the end which is unscored. The test, written in English, is administered around the world at hundreds of test centers, many of which are independent schools. Students may take the exam on any or all of the eight Standard test dates; the SSAT \\"Flex\\" test, given on a flexible date by approved schools and consultants, can be taken only once per testing year (August 1 - July 31). Although each year several different SSAT forms are utilized, the SSAT is administered and scored in a consistent (or standard) manner. The reported scores or scaled scores are comparable and can be used interchangeably, regardless of which test form students take. This score interchangeability is achieved through a statistical procedure referred to as score equating. Score equating is used to adjust for minor form difficulty differences, so that the resulting scores can be compared directly. The SSAT measures three constructs: verbal, quantitative, and reading skills that students develop over time, both in and out of school. It emphasizes critical thinking and problem-solving skills that are essential for academic success. The overall difficulty level of the SSAT is built to be at 50–60%. The distribution of question difficulties is set so that the test will effectively differentiate among test takers who vary in their level of abilities. In developing the SSAT, review committees are convened which are composed of content and standardized test experts and select independent school teachers. Test sections = Quantitative = Middle and Upper Level: In the Middle and Upper Level SSATs, there are two 30-minute math sections with 25 questions each. These sections are called the quantitative sections. The quantitative questions measure the test taker’s knowledge of basic quantitative concepts, algebra, and geometry. The words used in SSAT problems refer to basic mathematical operations. Many of the questions that appear in the quantitative sections of the Middle Level SSAT are structured in mathematical terms that directly state the operation needed to determine the best answer choice. The challenge is to figure out what the questions is asking. Some of the wording can be misleading. Other questions are structured as word problems. A word problem often does not specifically state the mathematical operation(s) to perform in order to determine the optimal answer. Often it becomes down to two very similar solutions. Sometimes one must re- read the problem to distinguish between the correct answer; this is time consuming. Elementary Level: The quantitative section of the EL SSAT consists of thirty quantitative items. These items are a mixture of concepts that are considered to be the basis of the third and fourth grade mathematics curricula and a few that will challenge the third- or fourth-grade student. These include questions on number sense, properties, and operations; algebra and functions; geometry and spatial sense; measurement; and probability. Preparing for the SSAT's: This requires practice. Because this is a timed test, it may help one's performance to work with practice tests. = Reading Comprehension = In the Middle and Upper Level SSATs, the 40-minute reading comprehension section has 40 questions based on reading passages. These questions measure the test taker’s ability to understand what is read in the section. In general, the SSAT uses two types of writing: narrative, which includes excerpts from novels, poems, short stories, or essays; and argument, which presents a definite point of view about a subject. By presenting passages and questions about the passages, the reading comprehension section measures a test taker's ability to understand what he or she read. Following each passage are questions about its content or about the author’s style, intent, or point of view. The passages are chosen from a variety of categories, including, but not limited to: humanities: art, biography, poetry, etc.; social studies: history, economics, sociology, etc.; science: medicine, astronomy, zoology, etc. In the Elementary Level SSAT the reading section consists of seven short, grade-level-appropriate passages, each with four multiple-choice questions. These passages may include prose and poetry, fiction and nonfiction, from diverse cultures. Students are asked to locate information and find meaning by skimming and close reading. They are also asked to demonstrate literal, inferential, and evaluative comprehension of a variety of printed materials. Questions ask the reader to show understanding of key ideas and details to determine the main idea of the text. Additionally, they ask the reader to determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in a text, distinguishing literal from non-literal language. The reading comprehension section of the SSAT of any kind, is the way for a school that requires a SSAT score, to place the student in classes that consist of reading comprehension. Since not all schools require an SSAT score, and only few schools use the SSAT to judge the students academic skills, the reading comprehension test does not help unless it is an independent school judging a students academic skills by the SSAT. = Verbal = SSAT Verbal Reasoning is the first and fastest section in the test. Verbal reasoning is mainly understanding and reasoning using concepts expressed in words. It aims at assessing the ability to think constructively, rather than at simple fluency or vocabulary recognition. This section of the test is composed of two parts – synonyms and sentence completions. It takes 20 minutes to complete the 20 Synonym Questions and 20 Sentence Completion Questions. These questions test your familiarity with vocabulary and your ability to apply that knowledge. Outside of the test having Verbal Reasoning skills will allow oneself to develop qualities such as understanding, and solving complicated subject questions, logical reasoning as well as guaranteeing they have a vast vocabulary. Synonym questions in the ISEE look like this: CELEBRATE: (A) align (B) fathom (C) rejoice (D) salivate Sentence completions in the ISEE look like this: The farmers were wisely ------- to use the damaged farm equipment. (A) desperate (B) eager (C) happy (D) hesitant On the Middle and Upper Level SSATs, the verbal section is 30 minutes long and consists of 30 synonym and 30 analogy questions. It asks students to identify synonyms and to interpret analogies. The synonym questions test the strength of the students' vocabulary, while the analogy questions measure their ability to relate ideas to each other logically. Analogies are a comparison between two things that are usually seen as different from each other but have some similarities. They act as an aid to understanding things by making connections and seeing relationships between them based on knowledge already possessed. Comparisons like these play an important role in improving problem-solving and decision-making skills, in perception and memory, in communication and reasoning skills, and in reading and building vocabulary. Analogies help students to process information actively, make important decisions, and improve understanding and long-term memory. Considering the relationships stimulates critical and creative thinking. Elementary Level SSAT: The verbal section of the EL SSAT has two parts. The first is a vocabulary section and the second is an analogies section. These sections test understanding of language, word relationships, and nuances in word meanings by relating them to words with similar but not identical meanings (synonyms). = Writing Sample = In the writing sample section of the Middle and Upper Level SSATs, test takers are given 2 pages and a choice of two writing prompts: Middle Level test takers receive a choice of two creative prompts, and Upper Level test takers receive one essay and one creative prompt from which to choose. The writing sample section is 25 minutes long and is not scored. However, the writing sample is sent to admission officers at the school to which the test taker is applying, along with the scores of the other sections of the test. Schools simply look at writing proficiency so there is no need to waste time thinking about which one would look \\"best\\" to schools. Elementary Level SSAT: The writing sample gives students an opportunity to express themselves through written response to a picture prompt. Students are asked to look at the picture and tell a story about what happened, each being sure their story includes a beginning, a middle, and an end. This writing sample is not graded, but a copy is provided to the school to which the student is applying. Here are some general tips: test takers must make sure to write legibly because a school can not judge a test taker's writing if they can't read it. Save a few minutes in the end for fixing grammar and/or changing wording. Test takers should have the booklet filled enough so the schools have more than one paragraph to judge (don't compromise quality though). For the upper level persuasive essay the goal is to build a clear and convincing argument. This means test takers should use solid facts and think logically to convince others of their opinion. Test takers should aim for five paragraphs (Introduction, three arguing why you are right, and a conclusion). Test takers should make sure their intro paragraph has a thesis statement at the end of the introduction paragraph. Test taker's paragraphs will probably follow the CEAL format (claim-evidence-reasoning- link/concLusion to next evidence or to wrap up your paragraph). Test takers should maintain a clear point of view in other words don't try to argue for both sides (test takers can still use a counterargument if they wish). When figuring out what to put as evidence test takers can look at past events, current event, or in their own life to find convincing evidence. For writing a story test takers must make sure keep the tense and point of view the same and that the reader knows exactly where they are. A good way to do this is use details that makes the reader see where the story takes place. Make sure the reader clearly knows who the main character/s are and what is the conflict. Conflicts are character against nature, character against character, and character against self. A story can have more than one type of conflict. Test takers should make sure the story follows the structure that in the beginning there is a conflict and overtime gets worse until they solve the problem and things are better in the end (I guess test takers could kill their characters but that would be a good idea in very few circumstances). Test takers will not receive essay unless purchased separately.  Scoring  For the Upper and Middle Level SSATs, formula scoring is used, with students receiving 1 point for each question answered correctly, losing one-quarter point for each question answered incorrectly, and zero points awarded or deducted for questions left unanswered. The Elementary Level SSAT does not use formula scoring, instead giving 1 point for each correct answer and 0 points for each incorrect/incomplete answer, so if taking the elementary test it is best to guess on questions with the chance of choosing the right answer. The SSAT is designed so that students should be able to reach all questions on the test. Scaled Scores: SSAT scores are broken down by section (verbal, quantitative/math, reading). A total score (a sum of the three sections) is also reported. For the Middle Level SSAT sections, the lowest number on the scale (440) is the lowest possible score a student can earn and the highest number (710) the highest score. All scores combined the lowest score you could get was 1320 and the most at 2130 with a mid point at 1725. For the Upper Level SSAT sections, the lowest number on the scale (500) is the lowest possible score a student can earn and the highest number (800) is the highest score this leads to the lowest score someone could get being 1500 and the highest 2400 and the median at 1950. For the Elementary Level SSAT sections, the lowest number on the scale (300) is the lowest possible score a student can earn and the highest number (600) is the highest score and a combined lowest score of 900 and the highest being 1800 with a midpoit of 1350. The experimental section (15-17 for elementary and 16 questions for middle and upper levels) as stated before is not graded SSAT Percentile: The SSAT Percentile (1 to 99) compares the student's performance on the SSAT with that of other students of the same grade and gender who have taken the SSAT in the U.S. and Canada on a Standard test date in the previous three years. test takers may send their results to the independent schools they wish to apply to at any time (before they sit for the test, after they sit for the test, or after they have viewed their scores) and there is no charge for sending scores to schools through the online SSAT account. Students have score choice and may report only the scores they wish for a school to see. There is no designation on the score report if a student has tested multiple times or with testing accommodations. Scores are released approximately 2 weeks after receipt of test materials. If a test taker takes the test multiple times they may not take their best scores from different test or \\"super score\\". In other words if you get a quantitative score in the 68 percentile and 88 percentile in reading comprehension and the second time you take the test you're in the 74 percentile for quantitative and 82 percentile you have to choose one result for schools to see and not 74 percentile quantitative and 88 percentile reading comprehension. Some schools do \\"super score\\" but they will ask for the scores themselves. Each school then evaluates the scores according to its own standards and requirements.

Its giant fossils were found in the U.S. states of North Carolina and Missouri. It is believed to be a hadrosauroid, although the Missouri remains were first thought to belong to a small sauropod (\\"Neosaurus\\", renamed Parrosaurus). The type species, Hypsibema crassicauda, was described by Edward Drinker Cope, and was found in Sampson County, North Carolina in 1869.E.D. Cope, 1869, \\"Remarks on Eschrichtius polyporus, Hypsibema crassicauda, Hadrosaurus tripos, and Polydectes biturgidus\\", Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 21: 191-192 The generic name is derived from Greek υψι/hypsi, \\"high\\", and βεμα/bema, \\"step\\", as Cope believed that the species walked particularly erect on its toes. The specific name means \\"with a fat tail\\" in Latin. The syntypic series, USNM 7189, originally consisted of a caudal vertebra, a metatarsal, and two femoral fragments that were originally identified as humeral and tibial fragments, all found in 1869 by North Carolina state geologist professor Washington Carruthers Kerr in the Black Creek Group of North Carolina. A second vertebra referred to the species, USNM 6136, was later discovered by Edward Wilber Berry and referred to H. crassicauda in 1942.^Lull, R.S., and Wright, N.E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. Geological Society of America Special Paper 40:1-242. In their 1979 review of dinosaur remains from the Black Creek Group, Baird and Horner (1979) noted that the femoral fragments come from a tyrannosauroid similar to Dryptosaurus, and made the caudal vertebra included in the syntype series of H. crassicauda the lectotype, while stating that the metatarsal could not belong to the same individual as the caudal. Parrosaurus was considered a species of Hypsibema, H. missouriensis, Donald Baird and Jack Horner in 1979,D. Baird and J. R. Horner, 1979, \\"Cretaceous dinosaurs of North Carolina\\", Brimleyana 2: 1-28 and since 2004 the official state dinosaur of Missouri.

Often in the past, it had been assigned to the wastebasket taxon Pelorosaurus, but restudy has suggested that it could be related to Turiasaurus, a roughly-contemporaneous giant Spanish sauropod. It is only known from six teeth. History and taxonomy Moussaye named this genus for a large, broken, worn tooth found in Wilmille, near Boulogne-sur-Mer, and neglected to give it a species name. He thought that it belonged to a theropod like Megalosaurus.Moussaye, M. de la. (1885). Sur une dent de Neosodon, trouvée dans les sables ferruginaux de Wilmille. Bulletin, Société Géologique de France 3(13):51-53. [French] Since then, five more teeth have been found and assigned to Neosodon.

Biography Ludwig Traube was a son of a Jewish wine merchant. In 1835, at age 17, he left the gymnasium in Ratibor. He studied medicine in Breslau, Berlin and Vienna. Among his teachers were Jan Evangelista Purkyně (1787–1869) and Johannes Müller (1801–1858). Besides medicine, he was very active in philosophical studies; he especially appreciated the philosophy of Spinoza. In 1840 he received his doctorate („Specimina nonnulla physiologica et pathologica“), a work about pulmonary emphysema. Then he moved to Vienna to broaden his knowledge (Baron Carl von Rokitansky (1804–1878) und Joseph Škoda (1805–1881). Since 1841 he was assistant of a physician for paupers in Berlin. In 1848 he became an unsalaried lecturer and in 1849 the first civilian assistant of Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793–1865) at the Charité. Ludwig Traube was involved as physician during the revolutionary occurrences in 1848. The later well-known botanist Nathanael Pringsheim (1823–1894), who was a friend of Traube, was arrested during the fighting. Another friend of Pringsheim was severely wounded, but saved by the help of Ludwig Traube. In 1853 Traube became the leading physician of the pulmonary department at the Charité and later chief of the propaedeutic clinic. He was also teacher at the military-medically seminaries. At the hospital of the Jewish community in Berlin he was head physician of the internal medicine department. Traube's Jewish ancestry was a great handicap for his career, but despite this he became in 1857 an adjunct professor, and in 1862 ordinary professor at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Institute in Berlin. In 1866 he got the title “Geheimer Medizinalrath” and in 1872 he was appointed a professor at the University of Berlin. Ludwig Traube had a coronary disease, which led to death. His grave is at the Jewish cemetery Berlin Schönhauser Allee. Ludwig Traube was the elder brother of Moritz Traube, who was an extraordinary private scholar and a pioneer of physiological chemistry. The Berlin physician Moritz Litten (1845–1907) was his son-in-law. Ludwig Traube married Cora Marckwald, and they had 3 daughters and 2 sons. It was an impressing happening, when a son died from diphtheria the age of 5 years. Another son, Ludwig Traube (1861–1907), was a palaeographer. His nephews Wilhelm Traube (chemist, 1866–1942) and Albert Fraenkel (physician, 1848–1916) belong also to the scholars-family Traube-Litten-Fraenkel. One of his daughters was Margarete Traube, a chemist and activist, married firstly to the physiologist and histologist Franz Christian Boll and secondly to the Italian engineer and politician Guglielmo Mengarini. Another daughter was the mother of Anna Fraentzel Celli, a nurse and philanthropist. Assessments Ludwig Traube earned great fame and honours by his establishing experimental pathophysiological research in Germany (e.g. he did animal experiments in the 1840s in his Berlin flat in the Oranienburger Str.) He improved the physical- medical methods like auscultation and percussion and was a taxonomist of the medical documentation. (e.g. inaugural of the temperature-pulse-frequency of respiration-curve into clinical praxis). He investigated the pathophysiology of respiration and the regulation of the body temperature, and gave a scientific basis to digitalis therapy. The narrow coherencies between heart and kidney diseases have been well demonstrated. He worked together with Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902), they substantiated the „Beiträge zur experimentellen Pathologie“. Acknowledgments The University of Leiden awarded Ludwig Traube the honorary doctorate in 1875. In the areal of Charité was built in 1878 a memorial monument. A street of Ratibor was named \\"Dr. Traubestraße“ in 1927. Some eponymous are associated to Ludwig Traube and describe clinical phenomena of auscultation, palpation and percussion: Traube's bruit, Traube's corpuscles, Traube's double tone, Traube's dyspnea, Traube's plugs, Traube's pulse, Traube's space and Traube-Hering-Mayer waves.

In ancient Roman religion, a Bidental was a sacred spot erected on the location where lightning had struck. Any remains and scorched earth were to be burned in a hole at the location by priests called bidentales. Any person killed was to be buried in the earth where the lightning hit, as opposed to traditional cremation. A Puteal, or sometimes plural, was then placed on the spot of burned earth. In order to further consecrate the spot, the head officiator would sacrifice a two-year-old sheep—bidens—. Finally, an altar was built, surrounded by a wall or fence to keep any trespassers away. Considered sacred, it was not to be touched, tread on, or even looked at after completion. Occasionally when falling into a state of decay, Bidentals would be repaired or reconstructed. Places being struck by lightning were regarded as a terrifying example of godly wrath, and not to be taken lightly. Had any person committed sacrilege, they were punished severely with frenzy.

It was built in 1927 adjacent to the Seattle Civic Auditorium (the present location of the Seattle Opera House), as part of the $1 million Seattle Center.Venue information and background The venue predated the Seattle Center Coliseum by about 35 years. Origins and usage as a venue (1928–2003) Initially conceived as an ice arena, the facility eventually became a large multi- purpose venue. It was nicknamed \\"the House of Suds\\" because of the large underwriting contribution of local tavern owner James Osborne. The name changed to Seattle Center Arena after the Century 21 Exposition (1962 World's Fair). In 1995 the name changed again, to the Mercer Arena, due to its location on Mercer Street and to avoid confusion with the Seattle Center Coliseum's new name, KeyArena. Its large, flexible spaces allowed an average of 183 events each year. From 1962 until 1974 it was first home to the Seattle Totems of the old minor professional Western Hockey League. The Seattle Thunderbirds of the modern junior Western Hockey League originally played their games in Mercer Arena before using the Coliseum beginning in 1989, although they continued to use Mercer Arena on a part-time basis; in 1992 it played host to the CHL's Memorial Cup when games at the Coliseum failed to draw their expected crowds. From 1996 to 1998, it was the home of the Seattle Reign, the city's first professional women's basketball franchise, a part of the American Basketball League (1996–98). From 2000 to 2003, it was used as a temporary venue for the Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet during construction of McCaw Hall, the new opera house. $6 million of improvements were put into the building to house the opera. New additions like heating and cooling systems, orchestra pit, and carpet were installed. The general infrastructure was reworked as well. The general purpose stage was reworked to a more traditional opera setting, old pipes that were used to freeze water for the ice rink were buried or removed, and the drop ceiling was removed creating a more acoustically sound environment. As the opera's occupation was only temporary, structural issues were not addressed and the arena was shut down after 2003. For concerts, it had a capacity between 5,000 and 8,000 depending on seating configuration. The building sat dormant from 2003 until its demolition in 2017. Proposed redevelopment (2007–present) On December 4, 2007, Mayor Greg Nickels announced a proposal to convert the arena into use by the Seattle Opera. The building will contain administrative offices, rehearsal spaces and workshops for the company. Sharing a common wall with the opera's performance venue at McCaw Hall, the arena would allow sets to be built within the workshop, then transported directly to the stage. This would be the first company in the world to have such an amenity. The Seattle Opera moved to lease the arena from the city, hoping to raise enough to convert the arena; the Great Recession of the late 2000s forced the opera company to put the project on hold in 2008, and to negotiate a lease-option extension with the city in 2010. In February 2016, the Seattle Opera unveiled plans for a $60 million facility to replace the Mercer Arena. The new building, named the Seattle Opera at the Center, is planned to be four stories tall and house of space for offices, storage, scene assembly, and community spaces. The condemned arena was demolished in 2017 and its replacement might be completed by the end of 2018.

Discovery and species In 1859 coal mine administrator Pawlowitsch notified the University of Vienna that some fossils had been found in the Gute Hoffnung mine at Muthmannsdorf in Austria. A team headed by geologists Eduard Suess and Ferdinand Stoliczka subsequently uncovered numerous bones of several species, among them those of an ornithopod dinosaur. Stored at the university museum, the finds remained undescribed until they were studied by Emanuel Bunzel from 1870 onwards. Bunzel in 1871 referred the scapula PIUW 3518 along with a humerus and metapodial (identified by him as a femoral fragment) to Lacerta sp.E.

Only scant remains are known, which makes Omosaurus hard to classify. The type, and only species, Omosaurus perplexus, was named and described in 1856 by Joseph Leidy. Discovery and naming In the middle of the nineteenth century, geologist Professor Ebenezer Emmons discovered several reptilian teeth in the colliery of the Chatham company in North Carolina. In 1856, the fossils in his collection were described by paleontologist Joseph Leidy. Leidy combined the teeth with some vertebrae and ribs; adding to them an osteoderm or scute found in the same strata by Professor Michael Tuomey, he named the whole Omosaurus perplexus.J. Leidy, 1856, \\"Notice of remains of extinct vertebrated animals discovered by Professor E. Emmons\\", Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia 8: 255-257 Leidy provided no etymology; the specific name suggests he was intrigued by the \\"intricate\\" find. The generic name might be derived from the Greek ὠμός, omos, \\"rough\\", perhaps in reference to the rough surface of the scute or to the \\"savage\\" nature of a carnivorous reptile. Today, all syntypes are lost. Description The teeth were described as being rather straight, slightly curved inwards, conical and pointed with a length of up to one inch. They had two edges at the inside and a D-shaped cross-section with the convex part positioned at the outer side. The surface of the teeth was smooth with little wrinkles, running vertically at the inside and horizontally at the outside. The vertebrae were amphicoelous and constricted at the waist, with a length of about three centimetres and somewhat taller than wide in cross-section. The scute was ornamented with a fan-shaped pattern of splitting ridges. Phylogeny Leidy himself believed Omosaurus to be a marine reptile, probably a plesiosaur, suspecting the remains were referable to some already named genus. In 1902, Frederick Augustus Lucas recognised the fossils as \\"crocodilian\\" in nature and placed Omosaurus in the Crocodilia. At the same time he affirmed the priority over Omosaurus Owen 1875, which stegosaur was by him renamed to Dacentrurus.F.A. Lucas, 1902, \\"Paleontological notes.

While the Taliban were well known for numerous human rights abuses, several human rights violations continue to take place in the post-Taliban government era. Afghanistan has an interesting strong human rights framework within its constitution. A bill of rights is enshrined in chapter two of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan's constitution. The right to life and liberty are constitutionally protected as are the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence for all persons. This gives the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan a strong human rights framework that is guaranteed to all citizens. Afghan security forces and its intelligence agency have been accused of committing grave human right violation like enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and torture of suspects. Moreover, Afghan security forces and Afghan air force have also been involved in killing civilians in ground operations as well as in air strikes. History Under the monarchy of Zahir Shah, human rights were usually respected. The Prime Minister as of 1949, Shah Mahmud Khan, increased press freedom, but these moves were soon reverted. The Press Law implemented in July 1965 gave considerable freedom to the press for the first time. While the press was mostly free, in some cases the King closed down media from dissidents that were considered threatening. The communist Khalq republic that governed Afghanistan after the Saur Revolution in 1978 was brutal, vigorously suppressing opposition. The government abducted and executed thousands of prisoners, rural civilian dissidents.Derailing Democracy in Afghanistan: Elections in an Unstable Political Landscape by Noah Coburn, Anna Larson. New leader Babrak Karmal promised to end the Khalq's brutality, which it partly did, but human rights abuses still continued. The government along with the Soviets (during the Soviet–Afghan War) intentionally targeted civilian settlements in rural areas. Under President Mohammad Najibullah's reforms, freedom of expression was further improved but human rights overall remained restricted. In the 1990s, many atrocities were committed by various militias against civilians. Indiscriminate rocket attacks during the Battle of Kabul, especially those by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's militia, killed thousands of civilians. The Taliban, in power from 1996, imposed strong restrictions on women, performed public executions, and prevented international aid from entering the country for starving civilians. =21st century= The Bonn Agreement of 2001 established the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) as a national human rights institution to protect and promote human rights and to investigate human rights abuses and war crimes. The Afghanistan Constitution of 2004 entrenched the existence of the AIHRC. While the ongoing turmoil, violence and reconstruction efforts often make it difficult to get an accurate sense of what is going on, various reports from NGOs have accused various branches of the Afghan government of engaging in human rights violations. There have also been various human rights abuses by American soldiers on Afghan civilians, most notably in the Baghram prisons where innocent civilians endured torture, humiliating conditions, and inhumane treatment. The United States was heavily criticized for lenient sentencing for the soldiers responsible. Former Afghan warlords and political strongmen supported by the US during the ousting of the Taliban were responsible for numerous human rights violations in 2003 including kidnapping, rape, robbery, and extortion.Afghanistan: Warlords Implicated in New Abuses 29 July 2003 Several thousands of people in Afghanistan have been victims of enforced disappearance over the past four decades, Torture agreement In March 2002, ABC News claimed top officials at the CIA authorized controversial, harsh interrogation techniques. The possible interrogation techniques included shaking and slapping, shackling prisoners in a standing position, keeping the prisoner in a cold cell and dousing them with water, and water boarding. A United Nations study in 2011 reported on interviews with 379 detainees. It found those held by police or intelligence services were subjected to beatings, removal of toenails and electric shocks. Elections during combat Several elections have been held in Afghanistan since 2001. The most recent election was held 18 September 2010, for the National Assembly with a reported 2,499 candidates competing for 250 seats. During the electionsAfghan Journal: Heroes & Demons September 2010 the Taliban attacked many of those involved, killing 11 civilians and 3 Afghan National Policemen in over 300 attacks on the polls.Afghanistan: Taliban Elect Explosives 18 September 2010 The low death toll at the hands of the Taliban can be attributed to stepped up operations specifically targeting the leaders of insurgents planning attacks in the days leading up to the elections, which captured hundreds of insurgents and explosives. Turnout at election was 40%.  Justice system  Afghanistan has two dominant justice systems: the formal state system and the informal traditional system. Despite existence of ordinary judicial system e.g. Supreme Court, National Security Court (dealing with terrorism related cases), first and second instance courts, \\"jirga\\" and \\"shura\\"-traditional institutions are operating. Law and order The National Directorate of Security (NDS), Afghanistan's national security agency, has been accused of running its own prisons, torturing suspects, and harassing journalists. It has also been accused of deliberately killing civilians during its raids. The security forces of local militias, which also have their own prisons, have been accused of torture and arbitrary killings. Warlords in the north have used property destruction, rape, and murder to discourage displaced Pashtuns from reclaiming their homes. Child labor and human trafficking remain common outside Kabul. Civilians frequently have been killed in battles between warlord forces. Poor conditions in the overcrowded prisons have contributed to illness and death amongst prisoners; a prison rehabilitation program began in 2003. In the absence of an effective national judicial system, the right to judicial protection has been compromised as uneven local standards have prevailed in criminal trials. Fair trial principles are enshrined in the Afghan constitution and the criminal procedure but frequently violated for various reasons, including the lack of well-educated, professional staff (especially defence lawyers), lack of material resources, corruption and unlawful interference by warlords and politicians.See Tilmann J. Röder, ‘Human Rights Standards in Afghan Courtrooms: The Theory and Reality of the Right to a Fair Trial’, in: ‘Islam and Human Rights’, ed. by H. Elliesie, Peter Lang Verlag (Frankfurt am Main) 2010. Several thousands of people in Afghanistan have been victims of enforced disappearance over the past four decades.Agony of Afghanistan’s Enforced Disappearances On 27 June 2020, two human rights defenders associated with Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) were killed in a bomb attack. They died after an explosive device attached to their vehicle detonated. The attack came less than a week after two prosecutors and three other employees from the attorney general’s office were shot dead by gunmen in Kabul. On August 14, 2020, the United Nations experts demanded the Afghanistan government to take an early decisive action to prevent the killing of human rights defenders. Nine human rights defenders have been killed since the start of 2020. The number has already surpassed 2019’s figure. Freedom of speech and the media Article 34 of Afghanistan's constitution allows freedom of speech and press, though there are restrictions on media that may invoke Islamic law or be offensive to other sects. However, there have been and harassment and threats targeting journalists and legal experts, especially outside Kabul. Freedom of the press was guaranteed by interim President Hamid Karzai in February 2002. The 2004 Media Law was signed by Karzai in 2005. In 2008, documentary filmmaker Nasir Fayaz was arrested for criticising politicians from the President's cabinet on his weekly show on Ariana TV. The arrest caused an outcry from journalists and it violated Article 34 which reads \\"Freedom of expression shall be inviolable\\". Afghanistan ranks 120th in the 2017 Press Freedom Index, better than all its neighbors. Journalist in Afghanistan face threat from both the security forces and insurgents. Journalist are threatened, assaulted and killed by Afghan officials, warlords and insurgents to stop them from reporting. Furthermore, Human Right Watch report claim that many Afghan journalists self-censors by steering clear of reporting on sensitive issues. Afghan Journalists Safety Committee (AJSC) in 2017 claim that Afghan government accounted for 46% of the attacks on Afghans journalist. While insurgents were responsible for rest of the attacks. Religious freedom No registration of religious groups is required; minority religious groups are able to practice freely but not to proselytize. Islam is the official religion; all law must be compatible with Islamic morality, and the President and Vice President must be Muslims. Apostasy remains officially punishable by death, per the Constitution of Afghanistan. In 2006, Abdul Rahman, an Afghan Muslim who had been arrested for converting to Christianity, was granted presidential permission to leave the country, and moved to Italy, where he received asylum.\\"Afghan convert arrives in Italy for asylum\\", CNN, 29 March 2006 In 2014, an Afghan Muslim who had renounced Islam and become an atheist was granted asylum in the United Kingdom, on the grounds that he could face death if he returned to his country of origin.\\"Atheist Afghan granted religious asylum in UK\\", BBC, 14 January 2014 Women's rights Women constitutionally have equal rights to men, which were severely restricted in the Taliban regime The Constitution promises equal rights for men and women, and women are permitted to work outside the home, to engage in political activity, and the Constitution requires each political party to nominate a certain number of female candidates. During the time of Taliban rule, women had virtually all their rights taken away. Matters ranging from wearing nail polish to job opportunities were severely restricted. By keeping women indoors, the Taliban claimed to be keeping them safe from harm. In late March 2009, Afghan President Hamid Karzai signed into law an internationally condemned \\"Shia Family Law\\" which condones apparent spousal rape (in Article 132), child marriage and imposes purdah on married Afghan women. Although the offending legislation is said to have been dormant for a year, President Karzai was trying to gain the support of Afghan northern Shia legislators and the neighbouring Islamic Republic of Iran, which is Shia- dominated. According to Britain's Independent newspaper, the 'family code' was not read in the Upper House/Senate, and also enshrines gender discrimination in inheritance law and divorce against women Despite various promises from the government to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, the law could not be implemented. The Kabul peace talks that took place in June 2017, included only two women among 47 government and international representatives. On 18 September 2020, Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani signed a new law to include mothers’ names on their children’s birth certificates and identification cards. Afghan women’s rights activists had been campaigning on social media for several years to include the name of both parents, under the hashtag #WhereIsMyName. Sexual orientation Homosexuality and cross-dressing were capital crimes under the Taliban, but have been reduced to crimes punished by long prison sentences.

It is known from a single tooth usually referred to the contemporaneous \\"wastebasket taxon\\" Pelorosaurus, although there is no solid evidence for this. History and taxonomy In 1852 geologist Thomas Wright reported the find of a large reptilian tooth from the Wealden Clay near Brixton Bay on Wight. Wright had presented the find to several experts, among them Richard Owen, David Forbes, George Robert Waterhouse and Samuel Pickworth Woodward but only Gideon Mantell came with a useful suggestion pointing to a similarity with the teeth of the dinosaur Hylaeosaurus. Not convinced by this, Wright concluded that the tooth, in view of its sharpness, belonged to a carnivorous reptile of unknown affinities.Wright, T. (1852). Contributions to the palaeontology of the Isle of Wight. Annals and Magazine of Natural History 2:87-93. Wright had also asked the French paleontologist Paul Gervais for his opinion on the fossil. Gervais in 1852 based the type species Oplosaurus armatus on it. The generic name would normally read as \\"armoured lizard\\" from the Greek hoplon, \\"body armour\\". The usual story about the — given the fact that Oplosaurus is not known to be armoured — odd choice of name is that Gervais named this large, well-preserved tooth (holotype BMNH R964) under the mistaken belief that its owner was an armoured dinosaur like Hylaeosaurus following Mantell's suggestion.Naish, D., and Martill, D.M. (2001). Saurischian dinosaurs 1: Sauropods. In: Martill, D.M., and Naish, D. (eds.). Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight. The Palaeontological Association:London 185-241. However, recent research by Ben Creisler shows that Gervais compared it to Mosasaurus, not Hylaeosaurus, and that the name may have been intended as \\"armed lizard\\", with the teeth as the weapons of a carnivore, as hoplon can also mean \\"weapon\\" (although this would make the specific name redundant, as armatus too means \\"armed\\" in Latin).Gervais, P. (1852). Zoologie et paléontologie française (animaux vertébrés) (1st edition). A. Bertrand:Paris, 271 p. [French] Richard Lydekker (1888) suggested that a maxilla with a tooth (BMNH R751), also from the Isle of Wight, was another exemplar of this animal, but this opinion has not been substantiated. Lydekker also used the improved spelling \\"Hoplosaurus\\" but the original Oplosaurus has priority. The tooth is large, 85 mm (3.35 in) tall in total, with a spatulate crown 52 mm (2.05 in) tall, comparable to Brachiosaurus; it has a pointed tip, a slightly compressed form \\"cheek\\" to tongue, a slight convexity to the base of the tongue-facing side, and wear facets. It is vaguely like a Brachiosaurus tooth, which is why the genus has for a time been referred to the Brachiosauridae.McIntosh, J.S. (1990). Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria. University of California Press:Berkeley 345-401. Earlier, Oplosaurus was typically referred to Pelorosaurus following an opinion of Friedrich von Huene in 1909, although Pelorosaurus is based on fragmentary remains that do not include teeth, making it impossible to prove the identity. (See Naish and Martill (2001) for a good review of Oplosaurus and Wealden sauropods in general; here is a more recent informal summation of the state of work.) Given how poor the Pelorosaurus holotype material is, and that it doesn't include teeth, recent reviews have retained Oplosaurus as a potentially valid but poorly known genus.Upchurch, P.M., Barrett, P.M., and Dodson, P. (2004). Sauropoda. In: Weishampel, D.B., Dodson, P., and Osmólska, H. (eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd edition). University of California Press:Berkeley 259-322. Darren Naish, a British palaeontologist familiar with Wealden sauropods, has suggested informally that the genus may be a turiasaur but also co-authored an article concluding it was a member of the Camarasauridae. In any case, it likely belongs to the more general Macronaria. Paleobiology As Naish and Martill point out, the tooth is comparable in size to that of Brachiosaurus, indicating that the owner was a large sauropod; as a possible turiasaur, the size should not change drastically. It would have been a quadrupedal herbivore, possibly around 25 m (82 ft) long.

Unlike a conformation show, it is the young handlers who are judged, not their dogs.  History  County agricultural fairs in the United States began holding livestock judging contests for members of the 4-H, a club run by state agricultural extensions for children of farm families, in the early 1900s. Showmanship, in which the child was judged for ability to display \\"an animal to its greatest advantage\\" was a component of livestock judging. As the idea of 4-H as a youth development club, not just a club for future agriculturalists, spread around the world, horses and pet animals were added to showmanship categories. The first dog handling competition for children at a formal dog show was held in 1932 at the Westbury Kennel Club Show in Long Island, New York, in the United States. In 1933 the Westminster Kennel Club in New York offered a children's handling class, and prizes were established in the names of early promoters of children's events, Leonard Brumby, Sr, and George F. Foley. The American Kennel Club recognized Junior Showmanship as a dog show class in 1971. Today, major Junior Showmanship competition is offered worldwide through Fédération Cynologique Internationale clubs, as well as through the Kennel Club (UK), The Canadian Kennel Club, The American Kennel Club, The United Kennel Club (US), as well as 4-H and similar clubs. Other show-giving dog clubs and businesses may also offer Junior Showmanship events.  Purpose  Learning sportsmanship and developing knowledge of the dog are given as the purpose for Junior Showmanship (Junior Handling) by most organizations. The Junior learns sportsmanship, ring procedures, and grooming and showing techniques specific to the dog he or she is showing, and develops a close bond with the dog. For the major show-giving bodies, Junior Showmanship can also be an apprenticeship in dog handling, preparing young people for careers in dog handling, raising, and training.  Eligibility  In general, children and young people may compete with dogs of any breed or in some cases, mixed breed dogs. Competition is by age group, in various classification levels. Rules are specific to each show giving organization. Children as young as two years old are allowed in the ring by the United Kennel Club (US), at age four by the Canadian Kennel Club, at age six by the Kennel Club (UK), and at age nine by the American Kennel Club and the 4-H. All end eligibility at age eighteen except for the Kennel Club (UK), which allows Juniors to compete until they are 24. Fédération Cynologique Internationale clubs have similar rules.  Nature of the competition  The Junior Showmanship competition is organized in a similar manner to a conformation dog show. The Juniors are separated into their age and experience levels, and enter the ring in order of the size of their dog. The juniors must move their dogs around the ring according to the instructions of the judge in pre determined patterns. The judge notes whether or not the Junior follows instructions correctly and presents the dog properly according to the dog's breed or type. Dogs are examined as in a conformation show, but the emphasis is on how the Junior interacts with the dog and the judge, not on the quality of the dog. At the basic or novice level, children are judged on how well they follow the judge's instructions, their understanding of ring procedure and of the standard of the breed or type of dog they are showing. In some clubs, the children may be quizzed or questioned by the judge. In close competition between advanced Juniors, judging is also based on the Junior's knowledge of his or her dog's faults, and how well they disguise the faults through skillful handling so that \\"what a judge observes are animals at the top of their form.\\"  Related activities  Junior Showmanship is a sport limited to children and young people, but many young handlers also enter adult show classes in conformation and performance (obedience, agility, hunting events, flyball, etc.) as well. Some organizations have set up separate performance event categories for junior handlers.  Judging  As junior handling is a separate sport from regular conformation showing, judges are usually given separate training and are expected to know the rules for the sport. Westminster continues to be the \\"crown jewel\\" of the Juniors Competition. Only one winner of Best Junior Handler at this prestigious show has ever returned to judge the event.

Six months earlier, while staying in Aleppo, Wilfrid and Lady Anne had made a plan to import some of the best Arabian horses to England and breed them there. In Lady Anne's words, \\"it would be an interesting and useful thing to do and I should like much to try it.\\"  Travels in Arabia  The Blunts' Arabian journeys are described in Lady Anne's books Bedouin Tribes of the Euphrates and A Pilgrimage to Nejd, based on Lady Anne's journals, though heavily edited by Wilfrid. In the winter of 1877/1878 they left Aleppo for what is now Iraq and reached the camps of Faris, a prince of the Anazeh tribe; Ferhan and other Bedouin leaders. Wilfrid became the blood brother of Faris. On a subsequent trip in 1881 he and Lady Anne reached the heart of the Najd in what is now Saudi Arabia. Among the horses the Blunts acquired on these journeys were the bay filly Dajania, purchased on Christmas Day in 1877; a dark bay mare eventually named Queen of Sheba, purchased from the Sheykh of Gomussa and his cousin in the summer of 1878; and a chestnut mare named Rodania. All three have left many descendants. Through their connections among the tribes, the Blunts also heard of a celebrated grey stallion. They sent a trusted friend, Zeyd Saad el Muteyri, to buy him; the horse was named Azrek, and became an influential sire.  Egypt  As important to Crabbet as the desert Arabians were, the collection of Egyptian leader Abbas Pasha proved an equally valuable source. This Governor of Egypt acquired horses from Arabia and Syria; his stock formed the foundation for the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif. The Blunts made their initial visit to Ali Pasha Sherif in 1880 and purchased the stallion Mesaoud, in 1889. Lady Anne wrote of the stallion: \\"He is four white legged and high up to the knee but surprisingly handsome.\\" As he aged, Ali Pasha Sherif's health failed and he encountered financial and political problems, leading to the ruin of his stud. In 1896 and 1897 Lady Anne inspected what she called the \\"sad remnants\\" before they were sold at auction, and was able to procure several of the best horses that remained. Some of these horses remained in Egypt, at a stud farm owned by the Blunts called Sheykh Obeyd. Thus, according to breed expert Rosemary Archer, some of today's horses of Crabbet breeding carry a higher proportion of Abbas Pasha blood than many present-day Egyptian Arabians.  Difficulties under the Blunts  Thanks to these purchases, Crabbet eventually became a principal center of Arabian horse breeding in England. However, there were many problems along the way. The Blunts spent much of their time travelling in Arabia and did not know what was going on in their absence. The pastures were ill-tended, the stables and paddocks not cleaned, stallions were shut up without exercise for weeks at a time. The Sheykh Obeyd stud fared little better while the Blunts were in England. Horses in Egypt were cared for by inattentive grooms and alcoholic managers, left tethered in the hot sun without shade or water, and many died. Further, Wilfrid Blunt had no experience of horse breeding and believed that Arabians should live in \\"desert conditions\\" - that is, with little food or shelter provided. Lady Anne disagreed, but she was not able to demonstrate the superiority of her methods of horse management until the Blunts separated in 1906. In that year, Wilfrid's mistress, Dorothy Carleton, moved in with Wilfrid, and the Blunts agreed to a formal separation. The Stud was divided. Lady Anne signed a Deed of Partition drawn up by Wilfrid. Under its terms, Lady Anne kept Crabbet Park and half the horses, while Blunt took Caxtons Farm, also known as Newbuildings, and the rest of the stock. Soon thereafter, Lady Anne retired to Sheykh Obeyd in Cairo, where she lived for most of the remainder of her life. Wilfrid frequently had to sell off horses to pay off debts. Lady Wentworth wrote of Wilfred, \\"His tyranny and spirit of discord eventually alienated him from his family, from most of his friends, and from several countries...He had a theatrical tendency to thunder and lightning stage effects which verged on melodrama...and his temper was not improved by hashish and morphia...\\"Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. The Authentic Arabian Horse, 3rd ed. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1979. Lady Anne died in 1917, passing on her titles to the Blunt's only child, their daughter, Judith, who became known as \\"Lady Wentworth\\". The Crabbet estate went to Lady Anne's granddaughters, as did what horses she still owned in England. Lady Wentworth had already purchased back some animals that Wilfred had sold to third parties and thus had a small herd of her own. Wilfrid then attempted to seize the horses and land, making a nighttime raid on Crabbet and initially taking all of the horses, including those already legally owned by Lady Wentworth. The mare Bukra, too near foaling to travel, was shot on Wilfred's orders. Bitter and anxious to pay off his creditors, Wilfrid sold 37 horses, exporting several to W.R. Brown's Maynesboro stud in the United States. Between thefts and sales of horses at Newbuildings, many horses of the original Blunt breeding program were lost to Crabbet. In turn, Lady Wentworth and her children forcibly took her favorite mare, Riyala, from Wilfrid's stable, and purchased back many horses from their new owners. A protracted lawsuit ensued between Wilfred against both his granddaughter's trustee and his daughter. Eventually the courts ruled against Wilfred. At one point, after Wilfred had shot seven more horses, the Trustee for the granddaughters obtained an injunction to prevent the sale or destruction of any more animals. In 1921, the court declared that Wilfrid's seizure of horses was illegal, and that even the Deed of Partition was invalid, having been signed by Lady Anne \\"under duress\\". Lady Wentworth was able to buy out her granddaughter's share in the estate from the Trustee, who was anxious to liquidate the assets. Upon Wilfrid's death in 1922, Lady Wentworth also bought Caxtons Farm from his executors and finally reunited the entire Stud.Cadranell, R.J. \\"The Mistress of Crabbet,\\" Arabian Visions, March 1990.  Crabbet under Lady Wentworth  Lady Wentworth had an unhappy marriage, divorcing in 1923. Upon the death of Lady Anne Blunt in 1917, she obtained her mother's title, and became the 16th Baroness Wentworth. The Wentworth title, one of the oldest in England, is one of the few that can be passed through the female line. By the time she took over the Stud, Crabbet Park had been leased. The Stud itself retained only eight horse boxes, some cowsheds and a few weed-choked pastures. The horses had been sorely neglected, some had starved to death, and others took years to recover. Lady Wentworth spent many years carefully rebuilding her stock and refining her breeding practices. To raise funds, she sold some bloodstock back to Egypt in 1920, including the stallions Kasmeyn, Sotamm, and Hamran, as well as the mares Bint Riyala and Bint Rissala. She also sold a number of horses to Spain's Duke of Veragua, including five Skowronek daughters. In 1926, she again received a significant infusion of much-needed cash when the famed Kellogg Arabian Ranch in California, owned by breakfast cereal magnate W. K. Kellogg, spent over $80,000 to purchase a number of Crabbet horses. Lady Wentworth rejected Wilfred's \\"desert conditions\\" theory as well as a prevailing conviction that Arabians were naturally the size of large ponies (that is, under ). She first proved that Arabians could produce taller horses from the progeny of Rijm, a grandson of Rodania, who reached . Her great contribution to Arabian breeding, however, was her outcross of the Blunt bloodstock to Skowronek. = Skowronek = Skowronek as a young horse Lady Wentworth knew that she needed additional horses to outcross on descendants of her parents' original bloodstock. Therefore, she added the chestnut stallion Dargee, and her most famous purchase, the gray stallion Skowronek. The English painter Walter Winans bought Skowronek from Count Josef Potocki's Antoniny Stud in Poland, where he had been foaled in 1909. Winans rode the stallion and used him as a model for several bronzes, then sold him to Webb Wares, who used him as a hack, and eventually sold him to H. V. Musgrave Clark, where he was shown and used at stud for the first time, coming to the attention of Lady Wentworth. Lady Wentworth bought Skowronek under circumstances that remain a bit confusing even today. Clark believed he was selling the horse to an American exporter, but at the last minute, the export was cancelled and Lady Wentworth suddenly was the owner of Skowronek. Clark was a rival Arabian breeder, and Lady Wentworth may have used the agent as a front; concerned that if Clark had known she was interested, he might have increased the price - or refused to sell the horse at all. Clark was not happy with the result, and the two breeders had a somewhat cool relationship after she purchased the stallion.\\"Skowronek\\" While Count Potocki apparently found Skowronek unimpressive as a colt, having sold him to Winans for 150 pounds, the gray became a spectacular stallion and was named \\"Horse of the Century\\". Lady Wentworth later turned down an offer of $250,000 from the Tersk Stud, and bragged that she once received a cable \\"from the Antipodes\\" addressed to \\"Skowronek, England.\\" The outcross of the Crabbet stock with Skowronek was extremely successful, and the resulting animals not only sold throughout England but were exported to Argentina, Australia, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, Spain, Russia and the USA. The Skowronek controversy Lady Wentworth herself was satisfied that Skowronek was a purebred (or asil) Arabian, tracing his pedigree and strain to several reliable desert sources. In the General Stud Book, however, Skowronek's pedigree ends with three grandparents. This has led some Arabian enthusiasts to question if Skowronek was in fact a purebred. His sire, Ibrahim, was desert-bred and imported to Poland. His dam Jaskoulka (variously known as Yascolka or Yaskolka) was a Polish-bred Arabian. However, while the Poles had bred Arabians for centuries and kept careful pedigree records, they also crossed Arabian stallions on Thoroughbred and other non-Arabian mares. In addition, some breeders used different terminology to distinguish horses bred in the desert and imported to Poland from the descendants of those horses bred in Poland, with translation issues leading some English language researchers to argue that second and third generation Polish-bred purebred Arabians were not actually purebred.\\"Is Purity the Issue?\\" Section: 'General Introduction,' WAHO Publication Number 21, January 1998 For these reasons, some people argued that his dam was not asil. However, research of Jaskoulka's pedigree shows that her sire Rymnik and her dam Epopeja (also spelled Epopeia or Epopya) both traced to Abbas Pasha horses. Nonetheless, due to this controversy, some private breeders' organizations, such as Al Khamsa, exclude descendants of Skowronek. =The Depression, World War II, and the postwar years= Crabbet's peak year was 1929, when over 30 mares were bred. But as the Great Depression deepened, it affected Crabbet Park, with Lady Wentworth only breeding 8 foals in 1932, and 2 foals in 1933. To reduce the size of the herd, she made major sales in 1936 to the Tersk Stud of the Soviet Union, selling 25 horses, including the beautiful Skowronek son Naseem. The stud's financial picture also improved by selling 3 more horses to the Kellogg Ranch. In this period, Lady Wentworth also sold horses to Australia, Brazil, Holland and Portugal. Nonetheless, the Depression years resulted in the birth of many fine horses, including Sharima, Indian Gold, Indian Crown, and Sharfina. During World War II, Lady Wentworth's aunt, Mary Lovelace, died, leaving a large fortune. This inheritance was much needed and marked the end of the financial problems which had been a problem for Lady Wentworth and the Crabbet Stud. In the war years, even though Lady Wentworth cut back her herd due to shortages and the necessity for the Stud to be completely self-supporting in horse feedstuffs, horses such as Grey Royal, Silver Gilt, Indian Magic, Silfina, and Serafina were produced. While Crabbet was bombed during the war, with over 32 incendiaries dropped, all landed on farmland and no humans or horses were injured. A Canadian Army Supply Unit took over part of the stud, with soldiers billeted in the house and even in some of the horse boxes. After the war, she purchased the stallions Raktha and Oran, and produced other significant breeding stock including Sharima, Silver Fire, Indian Gold, and Nisreen. By the time of her death in 1957 at the age of 84, she owned 75 horses, noted for their height, excellent movement and regal carriage.  Crabbet under Cecil Covey  Lady Wentworth died on 8 August 1957. She left the Stud to its manager, Geoffrey Covey, but as he predeceased her by a few days it passed to his son Cecil. (The Queen Anne house itself passed to Lady Wentworth's daughter Lady Winifred Tryon, who sold it; today, it is an office block and its royal tennis court has been restored.) Fortunately, Cecil Covey had inherited some other land. Only by selling land and nearly half of the 75 horses was he able to pay the 80% death duties owed on Lady Wentworth's estate and keep the Stud going. What followed was the largest single consignment of Arabians ever made from England, to Bazy Tankersley's Al Marah Stud in the USA. In 1961 Covey also sold the stallion Sindh to Dora Maclean of Fenwick Stud in Australia, where he became one of Australia's most important Arabian sires. For twelve years the stud ran smoothly under Covey, with twenty to thirty horses plus visiting mares; for the first time, the Crabbet sires were open to outside breeders. In early 1970, however, Covey learned that the government planned to build a motorway connecting South London with Gatwick Airport and Brighton. The motorway eventually bisected Crabbet Park, and, having lost most of the horse pastures to development, in 1972 Covey reluctantly sold off the last of the Stud.  The legacy of Crabbet  Serafix, bred by Lady Wentworth, foaled 1949, imported to the United States in 1954, was one of the best-known of the \\"modern Crabbet\\" stallions, the result of over 60 years of Crabbet breeding. In this photo, he was 22 years old. At least 90% of all Arabian horses alive today trace their pedigrees in one or more lines to Crabbet horses such as Mesaoud and Skowronek. Many major Arabian sires worldwide show a strong Crabbet influence in their bloodlines. Polish and Russian bloodlines have a Crabbet influence through the Skowronek son and Mesaoud grandson Naseem, and his son Negatiw (or Negativ). Mesaoud himself was sold to Russia in 1903. Spanish bloodlines have a Crabbet influence through the stallion Nana Sahib and others. Even major historic \\"Egyptian-bred\\" sires such as Nazeer trace to Mesaoud through his Crabbet-bred grandson, Sotamm. The Crabbet-owned stallion Raktha, sire of Serafix, was exported to South Africa in 1951, along with several other Crabbet horses. The first Crabbet stallion imported to Australia was Rafyk, who was imported, along with two Crabbet mares, in 1891.Gordon, Coralie. \\"In Search of the Crabbet Arabian in His Own Land\\" Somerset Publications.

An even smaller group of breeders maintain preservation bloodlines tracing strictly to the horses imported or bred by the Blunts. For the average Arabian horse owner, horses with Crabbet ancestry are noted for athletic ability, attractive appearance, and good dispositions. They are popular in under saddle classes and seen in many equestrian disciplines, both those limited to Arabians and those open to all breeds. The particular virtues of Crabbet horses - sound, athletic conformation, good movement, solid temperament and performance ability - show up especially well in under saddle competition, and particularly in the Arabian-dominated field of endurance riding, highlighted by 100-mile competitions such as the Tevis Cup in the USA and the Australian Quilty 100-Mile Endurance Ride. Crabbet breeding is also popular in the \\"Sport Horse\\" disciplines such as Dressage and show jumping, for which the Arabian Horse Association now sponsors a National Championship. Thus, the modern Arabian of Crabbet ancestry can be seen in the backyard of the single horse owner, on rugged wilderness terrain, or at the highest levels of national performance competition.

History of discovery Lectotype dorsal vertebra in anterior view, as illustrated in 1875 The type species, Ornithopsis hulkei, was named and described by Harry Govier Seeley in 1870. The type consisted of two dorsal vertebrae: NHMUK R.2239, found in the Hastings Group of East Sussex, and NHMUK R.28632 found on the Isle of Wight in the Wessex Formation dating from the Barremian. The genus name is derived from Greek ὄρνις (ornis), \\"bird\\", en ὄψις (opsis), \\"face\\" or \\"likeness\\", a reference to the fact that Seeley considered the animal to be an intermediate form bridging the gap between pterosaurs, birds and dinosaurs. The specific name honours John Whitaker Hulke.Seeley, H.G., 1870, \\"Ornithopsis, a gigantic animal of the Pterodacyle kind from the Wealden\\", Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 4th series 4(5): 305-318 Seeley's creation of the genus was, however, not accepted by Richard Owen, who rejected the evolutionary interpretation of the material. Disregarding priority, he therefore in 1875 split it, making NHMUK R2239, that he had in 1841 described as the quadrate of Iguanodon, the holotype of Bothriospondylus elongatus, and making NHMUK R.28632 the holotype of Bothriospondylus magnus. As a result of the split both vertebrae now went their separate nomenclatural way. BMNH R28632 was in 1876 by Owen made the type of Chondrosteosaurus magnus.Owen, R. 1876. \\"Monograph on the fossil Reptilia of the Wealden and Purbeck Formations. Supplement 7. Crocodilia (Poikilopleuron) and Dinosauria? (Chondrosteosaurus)\\", Palaeontographical Society Monographs 30 : 1-7 John Whitaker Hulke made NHMUK R.28632 the lectotype of O. hulkei, rendering Bothriospondylus magnus a junior objective synonym. By 1882, Hulke grouped all vertebrae of Ornithopsis and Eucamerotus under the new name Ornithopsis eucamerotus along with a set of three pelvic bones (NHMUK R.97, R.97a), and recognized the Bothriospondylus elongatus holotype as being distinct from NHMUK R.28632 in proportion. In 1995 William Blows restricted Ornithopsis to NHMUK R.28632, assigning other vertebrae referred to the genus to Eucamerotus and agreeing with Hulke (1879) the Bothriospondylus elongatus holotype was older than the Ornithopsis lectotype and not conspecific. Anterior caudal (NHMUK R1894) of Ornithopsis leedsi In 1887 Hulke named Ornithopsis leedsii for NHMUK R1984-1988, vertebrae and partial remains of a pelvis found by Alfred Nicholson Leeds near Peterborough.

The Ornithopsis hulkei holotype is basically a centrum lacking the neural spine. The vertebra is heavily pneumatised, filled with large cavities, camellae. It is narrow, tall, has a ridge on the underside, is opisthocoelous and has a posteriorly placed deep subtriangular pleurocoel over two thirds of its length.

History Paul Mauser developed his bolt-action rifle from 1867 to 1871. In 1870–71 trials with 2,500 test rifles took place, with the M1869 Bavarian Werder being the Mausers' chief competitor. The Mauser was provisionally adopted on 2 December 1871, pending the development of an appropriate safety. With support from the government's Spandau arsenal, the improvements to the safety mechanism were completed and the rifle was formally accepted on 14 February 1872 as Infantry Rifle Model 1871 by the German Empire, excluding Bavaria that adopted the Werder. The rifles were issued to the German Army from late 1873 to 1875, with approximately 1.82 million rifles and Jägerbüchse and 80,000–100,000 carbines produced. The Mauser 1871 was replaced by the magazine-fed, smokeless powder using Gewehr 1888 from 1888 through 1890. Design The action was not based on its predecessor, the Dreyse needle gun which had seen service during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, and which was found to have a number of weaknesses. The now well known Mauser \\"wing\\" type safety lever was developed for the Gewehr 71. The Gewehr 71 is a conventional looking bolt action chambered in 11mm using black powder cartridges. The action included only a bolt guide rib as its single locking lug, locking forward of the receiving bridge. The original design was a single-shot. After troop trials in 1882 and 1883, the design was updated in 1884 with an 8-round tubular magazine designed by Alfred von Kropatschek, making this the German Army's first repeating rifle. This version was designated the Gewehr 1871/84, of which over a million examples were produced. A version of this repeater was adopted by the Ottoman Empire. Designated M1887, it differed from the M71/84 in that it had a side-mounted cleaning rod, a second locking lug on the rear of the bolt and that it was in 9.5×60mmR, which Paul Mauser touted as the most efficient (black powder) cartridge. In the early 20th century, a few were converted to 7.65×53mm smokeless by the arsenal in Ankara. A short version, the M1871 Jägerbüchse was developed for the Jäger or light infantry and served with engineers, fortress and navy units. It was a shortened and lightened M71. A Karabiner 1871 was also developed to equipped the German cavalry but did not enter full-scale production until 1876. A shorter version of the Model 1871, the M1879 Grenzaufsehergewehr, was issued to the border guards in 1880. It shot a unique 11.15×37.5mmR cartridge, a trimmed down version of the full-power military cartridge. Various German arsenals and the Austrian company Steyr also manufactured the M71 rifle. Serbia adopted a more up-to-date version of the rifle in 1881, the M1878/80, still single-shot, but chambered in its own 10.15×63R caliber. It had unique additions in that it had a bolt guide (much like the M1870 Italian Vetterli) and the \\"progressive rifling\\" (rifling which increases in twist rate as the bullet travels up the bore, to more gradually impart spin) developed by the Serbian Major Kosta \\"Koka\\" Milovanović (Коста \\"Кока\\" Миловановић), and it is commonly known as \\"Mauser-Koka\\", \\"Mauser- Milovanović\\", or \\"Kokinka\\" (\\"Кокинка\\"). The muzzle velocity of the Mauser-Koka was . It saw first combat in the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Approximately 110,000 Mauser-Koka rifles entered the Serbian arsenal. Starting 1907, about half of these were converted in Kragujevac to shoot the 7×57mm from a 5-shot box magazine; the new barrels were purchased from Steyr. Both the old and new guns (designated M80/07) saw action in the Balkan Wars and World War I.John Sheehan, 1 of 110,000. The Serbian M78/80 is one of the Rarest of Mauser Rifles\\", Guns magazine, May 2012, pp. 36-39 The converted M80/07 are often referred to as \\"Đurić Mausers\\" (Ђурић-Маузер). In 1894, Uruguay had their stockpile of M71 rifles converted to smokeless 6.5×53.5mm SR (Daudeteau system) by Société Française d'Armes Portatives Saint Denis in France. They were given new stocks, barrels, sights, bands, and side-mounted cleaning rods. These were unsatisfactory due to weak springs, and many were thrown away.  Service  The M71 was used by the Korean Empire Army (especially Guard units—this rifle replaced the Russian Berdan rifle). The number of rifles used is uncertain but the Korean Empire manufactured ammunition for them, which means that the Korean Empire used a respectable number of them. From 1876, the Chinese Qing dynasty bought M71 rifles and carbines from Mauser, Steyr and Spangenberg&Sauer.; After the Germans adopted the Gewehr 1888, over 1,000,000 discarded Model 1871 and 1871/84 were put into Chinese service. The South African Republic secretly received many M71 rifles, that saw combat during the First Boer War, the Jameson Raid and the Second Boer War. Some rifles were smuggled to Ethiopia and they were used during the 1894-1896 war against the Italians. The M71 saw service during the Boxer rebellion. The Chinese units used the old M71 while German forces used the M71/84. The Chinese also used the M71 during the First Sino-Japanese War and the Xinhai Revolution. Serbia and Turkey used their M71-based Mausers in the Balkan Wars and during World War I. The M71 Jäger rifles saw service in African theatre of World War I, being the standard rifle of the Schutztruppe. At the same time, Gew 71 with incendiary bullets were used to shoot down observation balloons and German home-guard units were still equipped with M71/84 rifles. Some of these rifles were used during the German Revolution of 1918–19 and surviving rifles were distributed to the Volkssturm units in 1945. The M71 was also exported to Japan for testing and was used to improve the design of the Murata rifle. Uruguay, Siam and Honduras also fielded the M71 from the 1880s. Venezuela bought 27,000 M71/84 rifles after they were retired from front-line German service, while Ecuador acquired 12,000 M71/84s. Irish Republicans imported some 1,500 single-shot 1871 Mausers in the Howth gun-running for the nationalist militia called the Irish Volunteers in 1914. They were used in action by the Volunteers in the Easter Rising of 1916, the insurrection aimed at ending British rule in Ireland which began the Irish War of Independence. The 1871 Mauser became known in Ireland as the \\"Howth Mauser\\".

The 1884 models were altered in appearance by film makers to resemble the more period accurate 1871 models.

Threats to judicial independence, violence against women, and child labor are other major concerns.Bolivia With regard to the report of The Economist dated Dec 1st 2017, in FEBRUARY 2016 Bolivia’s left-wing president, Evo Morales, asked voters through a referendum whether he should be allowed to run for a fourth term in office in 2019. They said no. But on November 28th this year the country’s constitutional court gave him what the voters would not, ruling that a clause in the constitution limiting presidents (and other directly elected officials) to two terms can be ignored. Evo Morales finds a way to run for re- election A 2001 report by the UN Committee against Torture praised new legislation and other efforts by the Bolivian government to improve human rights; but the report also expressed concern about the “continuing complaints of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, resulting on many occasions in death, both in police stations and in prisons and military barracks”; the “impunity accorded to human rights violations...resulting from the lack of any investigation of complaints and the slow pace and inadequacy of such investigations”; the lack of enforcement of laws setting maximum detention periods; prison conditions; the sometimes deadly “disciplinary measures” inflicted on soldiers; the “excessive and disproportionate use of force and firearms by the National Police and the armed forces in suppressing mass demonstrations”; the harassment of human-rights activists; and the return to Peru of refugees “without complying with procedural formalities.” Basic freedoms Although Bolivian law technically guarantees freedom of speech and of the press, the relationship between the government and the news media is hostile, and the government has been charged with “taking actions designed to restrict independent media or to encourage self-censorship.” While there are a variety of news media that operate without restriction, including many that are critical of the government, people living in some rural regions have no source of news other than government radio. Also, insulting public officials is a crime punishable by a jail term of up to three years; an independent Press Tribunal has the power to sanction journalists. A 2010 report by Freedom House described the Bolivian press as “partly free” and increasingly unfree. In 2010, there were 60 cases of reported physical aggression or verbal threats directed at 111 journalists. A group of masked men broke into the radio studio of journalist Fernando Vidal in October 2012 while he was on the air and set him on fire, apparently in reprisal for Vidal's criticism of local smugglers and/or government officials. Despite all the challenges to free expression that exist in Bolivia, Human Rights Watch describes the country as enjoying “vibrant public debate, with a variety of critical and pro-government media outlets,” although it acknowledges that the national atmosphere is “politically polarized.” Bolivians enjoy free access to the Internet, academic freedom, freedom of assembly, and freedom of religion. They also enjoy freedom of movement within the country, the right to travel abroad, and the right to move abroad and repatriate. In practice, however, protesters frequently make movement within the country difficult by blockading major thoroughfares. Also, the fact that many Bolivians have no identity documents makes it difficult for them to obtain passports. Elections are free and fair, although the above- mentioned fact that many Bolivians do not have identity documents can prevent them from voting. While corruption is technically supposed to be punished, it occurs routinely in all branches of the Bolivian government. Bolivian law does not provide for public access to government information. Political rights Bolivians enjoy the right to vote in regular political elections and to assemble for political protests. Often, however, political protests have devolved into violence, and military and police forces have used violent measures to restore order. Bolivian political parties range from far-right to far-left, and citizens are unrestricted in joining the political party of their choice. Workers' rights Most workers in companies with 20 or more employees are technically allowed to unionize, provided a majority of the employees want to belong to a union, although this right is not always honored in practice. Board members of unions must be native-born Bolivians, and unions are not allowed to join international organizations. Before striking, unions are obliged to seek official mediation; moreover, the government may force workers and employers to enter into arbitration to conclude a strike. Public employees are not allowed to strike, although some have done so without being penalized. Some union groups have government ties and act under government pressure. Generally speaking, Bolivian workers enjoy only a limited right to bargain collectively without government involvement. There is a National Labor Court that deals with antiunion discrimination, but it can take more than a year to issue rulings, by which time those rulings may be irrelevant. Although forced labor is illegal, many children and indigenous workers are effectively slaves. While children under age 14 are technically not allowed to work, in practice the Ministry of Labor rarely enforces this law, and many children are employed in mining and other dangerous professions. Child prostitution is common, and the traditional practice known as “criadito,” whereby indigenous families effectively sell their children to well-off families to work as household servants, is widespread, despite its illegality. There is a minimum wage, but it is very low, and many people earn even less. There are laws setting a maximum work week and establishing other such limits, but they are not enforced effectively. Many Bolivians die because of unsafe working conditions, especially in the mines and in construction. Abuse of women and children Abuse of women and children is widespread and often unreported in Bolivia. Family violence, when reported, results in only a few days in jail and a small fine. The Bolivian government, in cooperation with the United Nations, is working to curb abuse of Bolivian women and children both within Bolivia and abroad. The punishment for rape has become more severe in recent years. Those convicted of rape, including statutory rape, face significant jail time. However, a victim must press charges in order for rape to be a crime. =Women's rights= Under Bolivian law, women enjoy equal rights, but many women do not know what their rights are and are, in practice, generally treated as second-class citizens. Rape and other forms of violence against women are widespread. The Center for the Information and Development of Women (CIDEM) says that 70 percent of Bolivian women suffer abuse of some kind. Statutory rape is punishable by up to 20 years in prison; forcible rape of an adult, by up to 10 years. In 2013, Bolivia passed a new comprehensive domestic violence law, which outlaws many forms of abuse of women, including marital rape. Rural women are often denied their inheritance rights, and women in the workplace are often denied their right to equal pay. Under Bolivian law, half of the candidates in municipal elections must be women. The abuse of women in Bolivia “is widespread and goes unreported or unpunished,” according to the Foundation for Sustainable Development. “Women's individual, economic, and social rights are inferior, severely limiting their ability to be agents for economic and social change.” A 2008 report by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women called on Bolivian authorities “to take the necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of existing legislation on gender equality,” “to streamline procedures for review of the compatibility” of its laws with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and “to repeal without delay all legislation that discriminates against women, including discriminatory provisions in its criminal and civil law and to ensure the enforcement of laws prohibiting discrimination against women.” The UN committee also called on Bolivia to take action to promote women's advancement in society, to fight gender stereotypes, to overcome the institutionalization of traditional sexual attitudes and prejudices, and to combat sexual exploitation and trafficking. It further recommended that Bolivia “ensure that all poverty eradication policies and programmes integrate a gender perspective and explicitly address the structural nature and various dimensions of poverty faced by women, in particular women living in rural areas, indigenous women, older women and women with disabilities.” Also, the committee suggested that Bolivia “strengthen its efforts to implement nationwide effective educational programmes in the areas of functional literacy, skills and income-generating training, including the provision of microfinance schemes, as a means of poverty alleviation, and adopt measures to ensure women’s equal access to land, housing, healthcare and basic social services.” =Children's rights= Children born in Bolivia, other than those born to foreign diplomats, are automatically Bolivian citizens, as are children with at least one Bolivian parent. Physical and verbal abuse of children is common in Bolivian schools. Children between ages 11 and 16 who are believed to have committed an offense have no right to trial and may instead be indefinitely detained in special centers on the orders of a social worker. Thousands of children live on city streets. There are also many child prostitutes, and many children who are trafficked to other countries to perform forced labor. A 2008 report by Pastoral de Movilidad Humana indicated that every month around ten children in southern Bolivia “disappeared and were presumed victims of trafficking.” The Defender of Children and Adolescents, a government agency that is charged with protecting children's rights, has 194 offices around the country. Bolivia is not a signatory of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, in a 2009 report, called on Bolivia to “take all appropriate measures to ensure that children are treated as subjects of rights.” In particular it asked Bolivian authorities to address “the low and unequal legal minimum ages for contracting marriage,” as well as the physical abuse of children (including abuse by police), the number of children living without parents or guardians, and the manifold failings of the juvenile justice system. The Committee recommended that Bolivia “establish a Children’s Ombudsman either separate or as part of the existing office of the Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo)” and ensure that such an Ombudsman “conforms to the Paris Principles.” The committee also mentioned a variety of other problems afflicting Bolivian children, such as widespread malnutrition, the plight of children living in prisons with their inmate parents, “children's right to play,” child labor, and child abduction. Human trafficking Economic scarcity has led to human trafficking and Child labor in Bolivia. Children are often trafficked for labor. Prostitution Prostitution is legal in Bolivia, but many Bolivian women are taken against their will to other countries and forced to work in prostitution for little compensation. Disabled persons' rights Discrimination against disabled persons is illegal, but this prohibition is not effectively enforced. The Law on Disabilities requires all public and private buildings to be wheelchair accessible; there is a National Committee for Handicapped Persons that is charged with protecting disabled people's rights. Indigenous rights Indigenous persons, who form a majority of the Bolivian population, have been denied land rights owing to their traditional collective ownership of land under the so-called “ayllu” system. Although Bolivian law technically requires that wrongs against individuals and groups who once owned land under this system be redressed, injustice on this front is still widespread. Indigenous persons are insufficiently represented in government and suffer high unemployment. Amnesty International complained in a 2012 report that Bolivian authorities had made decisions about construction of a highway across the Isiboro Sécure Indigenous Territory and National Park (Territorio Indígena y Parque Nacional Isiboro Sécure, TIPNIS) without consulting the indigenous persons who live there. This lack of consultation resulted in a good deal of confusion and conflict, with some indigenous people supporting the road and others opposing it, and the government reversing its plans more than once. Human Rights Watch asked Bolivia in 2011 to ensure “a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation” of alleged police abuse of peaceful indigenous protestors near Yucomo on September 25 of that year. A report by the UN Committee for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, issued in the same year, called on Bolivia to adopt urgent means to ensure that the Guaraní people are able to exercise their rights, including their rights to recover their ancestral lands. In accordance with the Bolivian constitution and law, seven special “indigenous districts” have been established in order to increase the participation of indigenous peoples in national politics. Asylum-seekers' and refugees' rights Bolivia provides protection to refugees and asylum seekers, although the number of such individuals in the country is quite low. Minority-group rights The Bolivian constitution bans racial discrimination, and the 2010 Anti-Racism Law requires the punishment of discrimination and of racist language, but in reality there is considerable racial discrimination on all these grounds, with the country's small minority of black persons being subject to considerable oppression and mistreatment. The UN Committee for the Prevention of Racial Discrimination, in a March 2011 report, called on Bolivia to intensify its efforts to combat racial discrimination. LGBT rights Bolivian law bans discrimination based on sexual orientation, and transgender persons are allowed to legally change their name and gender. In practice, however, discrimination against LGBT persons is widespread. There are LGBT rights groups, and gay-rights marches and gay-pride parades take place with official approval and are protected by police. Rights of persons under arrest Arbitrary arrest is illegal, although such arrests do take place. Under the law, detainees have the right to face a judge within 24 hours, although this right is not always honored. Most defendants cannot afford a lawyer and the supply of public defenders is insufficient. Although Bolivian law prohibits pretrial periods exceeding 18 months, it is common for periods of pretrial detention to last longer than this. On the orders of a social worker, children between 11 and 16 may be held indefinitely in special centers without judicial review. Although torture is forbidden under the Bolivian constitution and law, security forces frequently engage in it, and punishment for such violations is rare. Rights of persons on trial The Bolivian judiciary has been described as “corrupt, overburdened, and weakened by vacancies at its highest levels.” As of 2010, the Bolivian Supreme Court had an 8000-case backlog, including cases dating back to 2003, and the Judicial Council, which is charged with legal oversight, also had a considerable backlog. The military justice system tends “to avoid rulings that would embarrass the military.” Officially, defendants enjoy the right under the Bolivian constitution to a speedy trial, to an attorney, to due process, and to appeal. In practice, these rights are often violated. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) reported in December 2009, that only “55 percent of municipalities had judges, 23 percent government investigators, and 3 percent public defenders.” When it comes to the roles of the police and judiciary, much of Bolivia is, in effect, all but lawless. Although the Bolivian constitution prohibits capital punishment, in many areas the lack of efficient policing and of a well-functioning court system leads to so-called “community justice” – in other words, mobs taking the law into their own hands and violently murdering criminal suspects. In 2010, there were approximately 15 such cases. One 2010 case involved the capture and execution of four policemen in the town of Uncia who reportedly engaged in extortion and extrajudicial killing; another case in that year involve the burial alive of three brothers in the town of Tapacari in connection with a local conflict over property lines. The Human Rights Foundation, in a 2008 press release, made clear that lynchings and other “barbaric actions such as hanging, crucifixion, stoning, live burial, and burning,” which had been committed by mobs in Bolivia in the name of “communal justice,” could not be reasonably be considered legitimate acts of justice, and warned that more and more such mob actions were taking place. Noting that President Evo Morales had “said that disenfranchised groups should employ communal justice” and that he supported “lashing as a 'symbolic' means of imparting communal justice,” HRF declared that Morales’ position was “untenable in light of guarantees enshrined in Bolivia’s constitution.” Prisoners' rights Bolivian prisons are overcrowded, dilapidated, and lawless, and food supplies and medical care are almost invariably insufficient. Generally, prison officials only control the “outer security perimeter” of these institutions, while the interior is under the control of prisoners themselves, with inmates directing gang activity from behind bars. There is ample violence in Bolivian prisons involving both prisoners and prison officials, and corruption on the part of wardens and guards is widespread. Well-off inmates can arrange for improved living conditions, more liberal visiting rules, shorter prison terms, and transfer to better prisons. Some prisoners have been known to suffer from diseases such as tuberculosis. Prisoners are routinely able to obtain drugs and alcohol, and in some cases children are used as drug couriers. Juvenile offenders are often imprisoned alongside adults, and in at least one prison men and women are confined together as well. Under Bolivian law, spouses as well as children up to age six are permitted to live with a parent in prison, but in practice children up to 12 years old do so. Prisoners have the right to complain about abuses, but they rarely dare to do so for fear of retaliation.

The film's executive producer was Phillip M. Goldfarb. The noir is about a drug heist gone seriously wrong. Plot Raymond Lembecke (Vincent Gallo) is an ex-con just out of prison after serving time for selling drugs for his mob boss Tony Vago (Rod Steiger). (Lembecke was innocent and took the rap for Vago.) Lembecke thinks Vago owes him big time so, when his former boss gets him a measly job in a warehouse, he decides on revenge and plans to steal a million dollars' worth of drugs from him. Lembecke plans the heist with Marcus Weans (Mykelti Williamson) and the disturbed trigger-happy Curtis Freley (Kiefer Sutherland). They kill an undercover DEA agent (who's wearing a wire) during the heist. They decide to skip town and head to Las Vegas to sell the stolen goods; later they hope to make it to Mexico. As they head out of the city they kidnap a couple who own a recreational vehicle. But soon, hostage Gordon Jacobson (Kevin Pollak) falls under the spell of the Stockholm syndrome and begins to emulate his kidnappers and wants to stay involved in their hunt. In addition to fleeing the police, the group must avoid an assassin named Sir (Martin Sheen) who has been dispatched by the mafia.

The chain has stores in fifteen states, primarily in the South. Roses was purchased by Variety Wholesalers Inc. in 1997Variety Wholesalers: About Us and the company's Roses Division has approximately 175 stores which compete chiefly with Kmart and Wal-Mart. In 2010, the Roses Division began expanding beyond its original base of stores in the South, opening stores in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.  History  =Early years= Rose's Stores, Inc was founded in Henderson, North Carolina in 1915 by Paul Howard Rose (1880-1955). A merchant from his youth, Rose took possession of the Henderson store in June 1915 following dissolution of a partnership that had operated stores in Henderson and Charlotte. The chain expanded first in nearby Oxford (1916), then Roxboro (April 1917), Louisburg (March 1918) and in the Rosemary section of Roanoke Rapids (August 1918). With these five stores proving profitable, Rose and other family members began to expand into a wider area in 1920, first into South Carolina (Store No. 6, Mullins) and Virginia (Store No. 7, Franklin). Westward expansion began through North Carolina into Lenoir (Store No. 8), Statesville (Store No. 9) and elsewhere. When the chain incorporated in 1927, there were around 30 stores. Further expansion into Tennessee (Newport, No. 44, 1929) and Georgia (Dawson, No. 74, 1935) completed what would be the core of Roses' market area, which persists through to today. Most stores were in small towns, but in 1938 the company began opening outlets in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area, which would become its dominant urban market. Store 105 opened in 1938 on Colley Avenue in Norfolk, around the corner from where, three years later, the company would open a large department store, the PHR Center Shop, at the time Norfolk's most modern store. The following year, Store 106 (Ocean View Norfolk) and 107 (Downtown Virginia Beach) cemented the company's position in Hampton Roads. At the beginning of World War II, there were 118 Rose's 5-10-25 cent stores. During the conflict, housing boards in Norfolk and Portsmouth asked the company to open stores in government-owned neighborhood shopping clusters in housing areas created for war industry workers. =Expansion into shopping centers= Roses store in a shopping center in Waynesboro, Virginia Following the war, Roses' first real shopping center store opened in the Midtown Center at Wards Corner, also in Norfolk. Roses found the shopping center location successful and quickly went on to open stores in newly constructed centers throughout its marketing area. Early shopping center stores include No. 127 in Greenville, South Carolina's Lewis Plaza; No. 130 in Raleigh's Cameron Village; No. 132 in Greensboro's Summit Center, and No. 135 in Jacksonville, North Carolina's New River Plaza. Each of these stores was larger than the previous, leading the company in the direction it would take in the 1960s. When a shopping center location opened in Spartanburg's Pinewood Plaza in 1961, the building had around of floor space and advertised itself as a \\"discount department store\\". Other similar stores opened in Greensboro, Louisville, Roanoke and Virginia Beach before a prototype store that opened in High Point, North Carolina. In 1965, Roses opened a store in Morristown, Tennessee. From this point on until the 1990s, Roses began replacing smaller stores with these large shopping center locations. These shopping centers stores upgraded the lunch counters that had been a feature in most of the older downtown stores with cafeterias. thumbrightFirst prototype of combination discount store/grocery format \\"Roses Apparel, Home and Grocery\\", Elizabeth City, North Carolina shortly after conversion on 17 September 2012. This location is one of the largest stores in the chain at 65,000 sq. ft. In the late 1970s, the upscale PHR Center Shops (about six remained) were merged into the main operation while the remaining small stores were grouped into a division called \\"P.H. Rose Variety Stores\\", which the company continued to operate until it sold the remaining 50+ locations to Variety Wholesalers in 1984 to concentrate on their larger stores. =Struggles and later developments= When Wal-Mart first moved into the region in the early 1980s, its larger store format seriously diminished Roses' market share and profitability. Roses filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1993, and had emerged from it by May 1995.https://www.ncpedia.org/roses-stores. In 1997, Roses was purchased by Variety Wholesalers, which dates back to the 1932 opening of Pope's 5 & 10 cent stores in Fuquay-Varina and Angier, North Carolina. There were 106 Roses stores in operation when Variety completed the purchase. Variety quickly returned the Roses stores to profitability and soon began an expansion program that has doubled the number of stores. Rose's Stores, Inc. was renamed Variety Stores, Inc. in 2001 but the stores have continued to operate under the Roses name. Roses store at Five Points Mall in Marion, Indiana. This location is Roses first store in Indiana, and among three stores in Indiana--the others are in Anderson and Indianapolis. Rose's has begun opening stores in Jacksonville, Florida, again in 2011 and 2012. They are located on Arlington Road and on Lem Turner Road in an old K-Mart store. In the early 1970s Roses had been recognized as one of the nation's most rapidly growing retail chains. It was in the early 1970s that the company expanded into Florida opening 4 stores in metro Jacksonville, 4 stores in Metro Orlando, and 1 store each in Holiday and Tarpon Springs. This expansion soon created serious supply chain problems with the company's distribution centers located primarily in the Carolinas and these stores were subsequently closed. Starting in mid-2012, Roses launched a prototype combination store located in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, incorporating a full grocery department with complete produce, meat, dairy, and frozen food departments. The grocery location was replaced in 2015 with a Save-a-Lot grocery store operated by Variety Wholesalers as a franchisee following the successful debut of a Save- a-Lot grocery franchised to Variety Wholesalers adjacent to the Roses located in Raleigh, North Carolina. However, the Elizabeth City Save-a-Lot has closed as of September 30, 2017. In 2015 Roses Express moved into the old Food Lion at Hillman Square shopping center on 103rd Street also in Jacksonville, Florida. In 2017, Roses opened a new location in Gainesville, Florida.

Don Quixote, Op. 35 is a tone poem by Richard Strauss for cello, viola, and orchestra. Subtitled Phantastische Variationen über ein Thema ritterlichen Charakters (Fantastic Variations on a Theme of Knightly Character), the work is based on the novel Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes. Strauss composed this work in Munich in 1897. The premiere took place in Cologne on 8 March 1898, with Friedrich Grützmacher as the cello soloist and Franz Wüllner as the conductor.Mark-Daniel Schmid, The Richard Strauss Companion. Praeger (Westport, Connecticut, USA; 2003), p. 111 (). The score is 45 minutes long and is written in theme and variations form, with the solo cello representing Don Quixote, and the solo viola, tenor tuba, and bass clarinet depicting his squire Sancho Panza. The second variation depicts an episode where Don Quixote encounters a herd of sheep and perceives them as an approaching army. Strauss uses dissonant flutter-tonguing in the brass to emulate the bleating of the sheep, an early instance of this extended technique. Strauss later quoted this passage in his music for Le bourgeois gentilhomme, at the moment a servant announces the dish of \\"leg of mutton in the Italian style\\". Graham Phipps has examined the structure of the work in terms of Arnold Schoenberg's ideas of 'surface harmonic logic' and 'developing variation'. Instrumentation The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of the following forces: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets in B (2nd doubling E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 6 horns in F, 3 trumpets in D and F, 3 trombones, tenor tuba in B (often performed on euphonium), tuba, timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, wind machine, and strings: harp, violins i, ii, violas (including an extensive solo viola part), violoncellos (including an extensive solo violoncello part), double basses.

He was the only animal to complete the entire trip. He was purchased for $20 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania by Captain Meriwether Lewis while he was in the city awaiting completion of the boats for the voyage in August 1803, for his famed Lewis and Clark expedition. During the expedition, around May 14, 1805, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark performed surgery on one of Seaman's arteries in his hind leg that had been severed by a beaver bite. In early 1806, as the expedition was beginning the return journey, Seaman was stolen by Indians and Lewis sent three men to retrieve the dog. Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery ate over 200 dogs while traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail, but Seaman was spared. The final reference to Seaman in the journals, recorded by Lewis on July 15, 1806, states that \\"[T]he musquetoes continue to infest us in such manner that we can scarcely exist. for my own part I am confined by them to my bier at least 3/4 of the time. My dog even howls with the torture he experiences from them.\\" Due to a transcription error in Lewis' journals, the dog was once thought to have been named Scannon. However, during Donald Jackson's 1984 study of Lewis and Clark place-names in Montana, he found that Lewis had named a tributary of the Blackfoot River Seaman’s Creek (now Monture Creek) and concluded that the true name of the dog was \\"Seaman\\". In her book Lewis and Clark and Me: A Dog's Tale Laurie Myers reports that Lewis and Clark scholar, Jim Holmberg, discovered a book written in 1814 which listed epitaphs, and inscriptions. The book lists an inscription of a dog collar in a museum in Virginia. This has also been reported by Timothy Alden. The inscription reads: \\"The greatest traveller of my species. My name is SEAMAN, the dog of captain Meriwether Lewis, whom I accompanied to the Pacific ocean through the interior of the continent of North America.\\" Holmberg's research was published in the February 2000 issue of \\"We Proceeded On\\", the newsletter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation. In 2008, Seaman became the official mascot of Lewis & Clark College's Pioneers. A monument to Seaman stands in front of the Custom House in Cairo, Illinois. Other monuments and statues that include Seaman can be found in St. Louis, Missouri, St. Charles, Missouri, Jefferson City, Missouri, Lincoln, Nebraska, Fort Atkinson State Historical Park in Fort Calhoun, Nebraska, the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center in Sioux City, Iowa, Washburn, North Dakota, Overlook Park in Great Falls, Montana, in Fort Clatsop National Memorial in Seaside, Oregon, Cascade Locks Marine Park in Cascade Locks, Oregon and in Columbia View Park in Saint Helens, Oregon. Seaman also has a monument at the Sacagawea Center in Salmon, Idaho. An additional monument stands in Washougal, Washington. Seaman in fiction Seaman has been a character in several novels. In Tall Tails: Cross-Country with Lewis and Clark by Dona Smith, Seaman has a journal and narrates the expedition. In New Found Land by Allan Wolf, Seaman is a main character. In The Captain's Dog by Roland Smith, Seaman is again the narrator, giving his account of the Lewis and Clark expedition. He is also in \\"Seaman: The Dog Who Explored the West With Lewis and Clark\\" by Gail Langer Karwoski.

The UAE does not have democratically elected institutions and citizens do not have the right to change their government or to form political parties. There are reports of forced disappearances in the UAE, many foreign nationals and Emirati citizens have been abducted by the UAE government and illegally detained and tortured in undisclosed locations. In numerous instances, the UAE government has tortured people in custody (especially expats and political dissidents), and has denied their citizens the right to a speedy trial and access to counsel during official investigations. Flogging and stoning are legal forms of judicial punishment in the UAE due to Sharia courts. The government restricts freedom of speech and freedom of the press, and the local media are censored to avoid criticising the government, government officials or royal families. Freedom of association and freedom of religion are also curtailed. Despite being elected to the UN Council, the UAE has not signed most international human-rights and labour-rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Capital punishment The death penalty although authorised is rarely applied in the UAE, because the law requires that a panel of three judges agree on the decision of a sentence to death, which can be commuted if the family of the victim forgives the convicted or accept a financial compensation for the crime. When a family accepts financial compensation, a court can jail a convict to a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven years. Since the law in the UAE is based on a dual system of Shari'a and civil courts execution, death by stoning may be ruled on only if confession and four witnesses are obtained which is legally binding for a stoning sentence to be carried out, however UAE has so far never carried out any death-by-stoning sentence. Execution in the UAE is applied mainly through a firing squad. Sharia law =Flogging and stoning= The UAE's judicial system is derived from the civil law system and Sharia law. The court system consists of civil courts and Sharia courts. According to Human Rights Watch, UAE's civil and criminal courts apply elements of Sharia law, codified into its criminal code and family law, in a way which discriminates against women. Flogging is a punishment for criminal offences such as adultery, premarital sex, and alcohol consumption. Due to Sharia courts, flogging is legal with sentences ranging from 80 to 200 lashes. Verbal abuse pertaining to a person's sexual honour is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes. Between 2007 and 2014, many people in the UAE were sentenced to 100 lashes. More recently in 2015, two men were sentenced to 80 lashes for hitting and insulting a woman. In 2014, an expat in Abu Dhabi was sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption and raping a toddler. Alcohol consumption for Muslims is illegal and punishable by 80 lashes, many Muslims have been sentenced to 80 lashes for alcohol consumption. Sometimes 40 lashes are given. Illicit sex is sometimes penalised by 60 lashes. 80 lashes is the standard amount for anyone sentenced to flogging in several emirates. Sharia courts have penalised domestic workers with floggings. In October 2013, a Filipino housemaid was sentenced to 100 lashes for theft committed after her employer discovered her illegitimate pregnancy. Drunk-driving is strictly illegal and punishable by 80 lashes; many expats have been sentenced to 80 lashes for drunk-driving. In Abu Dhabi, a man has been sentenced to 80 lashes for being drunk while with his girlfriend on the Corniche. Under UAE law, premarital sex is punishable by 100 lashes. Stoning is a legal punishment in the UAE. In May 2014, an Asian housemaid was sentenced to death by stoning in Abu Dhabi. In 2006, an expatriate was sentenced to death by stoning for committing adultery. Between 2009 and 2013, several people were sentenced to death by stoning. Abortion is illegal and punishable by a maximum penalty of 100 lashes and up to five years in prison. In recent years, several people have retracted their guilty plea in illicit sex cases after being sentenced to stoning or 100 lashes. The punishment for committing adultery is 100 lashes for unmarried people and stoning to death for married people. =Apostasy from Islam= Apostasy from Islam is a crime punishable by death in the UAE. Blasphemy is illegal, expats involved in insulting Islam are liable for deportation. UAE incorporates hudud crimes of Sharia into its Penal Code – apostasy being one of them.Butti Sultan Butti Ali Al-Muhairi (1996), The Islamisation of Laws in the UAE: The Case of the Penal Code, Arab Law Quarterly, Vol. 11, No. 4 (1996), pp. 350–371 Article 1 and Article 66 of UAE's Penal Code requires hudud crimes to be punished with the death penalty.Al-Muhairi (1997), Conclusion to the Series of Articles on the UAE Penal Law. Arab Law Quarterly, Vol. 12, No. 4 =Emirati women and Islamic women= Emirati women must receive permission from male guardian to marry and remarry. The requirement is derived from Sharia, and has been federal law since 2005. In all emirates, it is illegal for Muslim women to marry non-Muslims. In the UAE, a marriage union between a Muslim woman and non-Muslim man is punishable by law, since it is considered a form of fornication.United Arab Emirates International Religious Freedom Report, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labour (2009), state.gov; accessed 27 October 2015. =Homosexuality= Homosexuality is illegal and is a crime that is punishable with the death penalty in the UAE. =Public affection= Kissing in public is illegal and can result in deportation. Expats in Dubai have been deported for kissing in public. In Abu Dhabi, people have been sentenced to 80 lashes for kissing in public. =Family law= The Sharia- based personal status law regulates matters such as marriage, divorce and child custody. The Sharia-based personal status law is applied to Muslims and sometimes non-Muslims. Non-Muslim expatriates are liable to Sharia rulings on marriage, divorce and child custody. Sharia courts have exclusive jurisdiction to hear family disputes, including matters involving divorce, inheritances, child custody, child abuse and guardianship of minors. Sharia courts may also hear appeals of certain criminal cases including rape, robbery, driving under the influence of alcohol and related crimes. =Other laws= Article 1 of the Federal Penal Code states that \\"provisions of the Islamic Law shall apply to the crimes of doctrinal punishment, punitive punishment and blood money.\\" The Federal Penal Code repealed only those provisions within the penal codes of individual emirates which are contradictory to the Federal Penal Code. Hence, both are enforceable simultaneously. A new federal law in the UAE prohibits swearing in Whatsapp and penalises swearing by a $68,061 fine and imprisonment, expats are penalised by deportation. In July 2015, an Australian expat was deported for swearing in Facebook. Amputation is a legal punishment in the UAE due to the Sharia courts. During the month of Ramadan, it is illegal to eat, drink, or smoke in public between sunrise and sunset. Exceptions are made for pregnant women and children. The law applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims, and failure to comply results in arrest. Forced disappearances and torture In numerous instances, the UAE government has tortured people in custody (especially expats and political dissidents). UAE authorities are known to be using torture as a means to extract forced confessions of guilt. UAE has escaped the Arab Spring; however, more than 100 Emirati activists were jailed and tortured because they sought reforms. Since 2011, the UAE government has increasingly carried out forced disappearances. Many foreign nationals and Emirati citizens have been arrested and abducted by the state, the UAE government denies these people are being held (to conceal their whereabouts), placing these people outside the protection of the law. According to Human Rights Watch, the reports of forced disappearance and torture in the UAE are of grave concern. The Arab Organisation of Human Rights has obtained testimonies from many defendants, for its report on \\"forced disappearance and Torture in the UAE\\", who reported that they had been kidnapped, tortured and abused in detention centres. The report included 16 different methods of torture including severe beatings, threats with electrocution and denying access to medical care. In 2013, 94 Emirati activists were held in secret detention centres and put on trial for allegedly attempting to overthrow the government. Human rights organisations have spoken out against the secrecy of the trial. An Emirati, whose father is among the defendants, was arrested for tweeting about the trial. In April 2013, he was sentenced to 10 months in jail. Repressive measures were also used against non-Emiratis in order to justify the UAE government's claim that there is an \\"international plot\\" in which UAE citizens and foreigners were working together to destabilise the country. Foreign nationals were also subjected to a campaign of deportations. There are many documented cases of Egyptians and other foreign nationals who had spent years working in the UAE being given only a few days to leave the country. Foreign nationals subjected to forced disappearance include two Libyans and two Qataris. Amnesty reported that the Qatari men have been abducted by the UAE government and the UAE government has withheld information about the men's fate from their families. Among the foreign nationals detained, imprisoned and expelled is Iyad El-Baghdadi, a popular blogger and Twitter personality. He was arrested by UAE authorities, detained, imprisoned and then expelled from the country. Despite his lifetime residence in the UAE, as a Palestinian citizen, El-Baghdadi had no recourse to contest this order. He could not be deported back to the Palestinian territories, therefore he was deported to Malaysia. In 2012, Dubai police subjected three British citizens to beatings and electric shocks after arresting them on drugs charges. The British Prime Minister, David Cameron, expressed \\"concern\\" over the case and raised it with the UAE President, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during his 2013 state visit to Britain. The three men were pardoned and released in July 2013. In April 2009, a video tape of torture smuggled out of the UAE showed Sheikh Issa bin Zayed Al Nahyan torturing a man with whips, electric cattle prods, and wooden planks with protruding nails, and running him over repeatedly with a car. In December 2009, Issa appeared in court and proclaimed his innocence. The trial ended on 10 January 2010, when Issa was cleared of the torture of Mohammed Shah Poor. Human Rights Watch criticised the trial and called on the government to establish an independent body to investigate allegations of abuse by UAE security personnel and other persons of authority. The US State Department has expressed concern over the verdict and said all members of Emirati society \\"must stand equal before the law\\" and called for a careful review of the decision to ensure that the demands of justice are fully met in this case. According to Human Rights Watch annual report 2016, Emirates authorities forcibly disappeared and detained people who criticised the government or its allies. February 2015, Human Rights Watch documented a case in which three Emirati sisters, Asma, Mariam, and Al Yazzyah al-Suweidi, were forcibly disappeared by Emirates authorities. They released them without charge after spending 3 months in incommunicado detention. The three sisters had arrested after posting comments criticising government for arresting their brother Dr. Issa al-Suweidi. In August 2015, Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith was arrested after posting some comments on social media in which he criticised the mass killing of Rab'a protesters in Cairo in 2013. Bin Ghaith's fate still unknown at time of writing. According to Amnesty annual report (2016) on Human Rights in UAE, enforced disappearance has been widely practiced against citizen and foreign nationals in UAE. The international organisation said UAE government has forcibly disappeared dozens of people for months in secret and unacknowledged detention for interrogation. According to the report, Abdulrahman Bin Sobeih was subjected to enforced disappearance for three months by UAE authorities. In addition, Dr Nasser Bin Ghaith, an academic and economist, has been forcibly disappeared by the authorities for more than 10 months. Bin Ghaith has been subjected to torture and ill-treatment as he faced charges relating to his right to freedom of expression. November 2017, Abu Dhabi security forces arrested two journalists covering the opening of the Louvre Abu Dhabi museum for Swiss public broadcaster. The journalists were held for more than 50 hours, with no ability to communicate with the outside world. According to RTS, The journalists were interrogated for up to nine hours at a time, and were blindfolded as they were shuttled between different locations. Furthermore, their camera, computers, hard drives and other material were confiscated. In March 2018, an Emirati princess Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum II, daughter of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, was seized by commandos from a yacht away from the Indian coast, after she fled from UAE. A BBC documentary reported how the princess planned her escape from her residential palace. In a video recorded by Latifa prior to her escape, she claimed to have tried escaping from the UAE previously. However, she was captured at the border and jailed for three years; beaten and tortured. In December, a statement released by her family quoted that the princess was “safe” at her home. Since early March, the whereabouts of the princess have remained unknown. On March 5, 2020, a UK family court's 34-page ruling confirmed that Sheikha Shamsa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum and Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum have been abducted and forcibly detained by their father and the Dubai ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. A number of UAEs royals have been charged for abusing and ill-treating servants in overseas countries. In 2019, a 42-year-old Emirati woman, who was arrested in 2015 by the UAE authorities, grabbed media attention due to the ill-treatment she received during her imprisonment in the UAE. While raising funds for Syrian refugees, Alia Abdel Nour was arrested on the accusations of funding terrorism. She has been imprisoned for 10 years and been subjected to immense torture and solitary confinement, with no access to ventilation, toilet, mattress, blanket, proper food and medicine. Despite being diagnosed of cancer – shortly after her arrest - she did not receive any medical treatment. Emirati authorities claim that Nour herself declined the medical treatment, while her family claims she was forced to sign documents that forbid her access to the treatment. On 4 May 2019, Alia Abdel Nour died in the UAE prison following a prolonged mistreatment and denial of medical care by the Emirati authorities. Since her arrest, her hands and feet were shackled to her hospital bed for long periods of time. The UAE authorities ignored requests by the international rights groups, European parliamentarians and United Nations experts to release her on the grounds of her deteriorating health. In January 2019, the UAE police detained 26-year-old Ali Issa Ahmad for reportedly wearing a t-shirt with Qatar's flag on it after the Qatar vs Iraq AFC Asian Cup match in Abu Dhabi. Ahmad complains that the FIFA \\"failed to protect\\" his human rights. Pictures of scars on Ahmad's body from the torture sustained during detention have released by BBC. The victim has complained about racial discrimination and of being stabbed and deprived of food and water while inside the prison. Complaints have been registered against FIFA as well as directed to UAE authorities through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the UN Human Rights Council. According to UAE authorities, the police took Ahmed to a hospital to be examined for signs of abuse, which he complained of to the police — as is customary in cases of assault in the UAE. A medical report revealed that his injuries were inconsistent with the account of events he gave to police, and that his wounds were self-inflicted. UAE embassy in Britain denied the news allegations that he was arrested for wearing a Qatari shirt, stating \\"He was categorically not arrested for wearing a Qatar football shirt\\". Ahmed was charged for wasting police time and filing a false report, which is an illegal act. During the AFC Asian cup, fans were seen wearing the Qatari football shirt and waving Qatari flags without any instances of arrest.https://www.thenational.ae/uae/british-football-fan-arrested-for- misleading-uae-police-1.822499 In June 2020, it was reported that the UAE has been holding captive a Turkish aid worker Mehmet Ali Ozturk, since 2018. Reportedly, Ali Ozturk has been detained on frivolous grounds and is tortured inside UAE's prison. He was arrested in Dubai, where he alongside his wife, Emine Ozturk, were participating in Dubai's food festival. \\"He lost 25kg after the torture they subjected him to, from denailing to strappado. They would do these things when he refused to take part in a video accusing Erdogan of some crimes,\\" his wife quoted. On 9 July 2020, reports claimed that the UAE authorities declined the requests of human rights organisations to provide information about an Omani man, Abdullah al-Shaamsi, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in May 2020 on a seriously unfair trial. Al-Shaamsi was arrested in 2018 at the age of 19, while attending high school in the UAE. The security forces subjected him to a sustained period of detention without communication, solitary confinement and torture, leaving him with kidney cancer and depression. Despite his health conditions, he was being held in an overcrowded prison known for unsanitary conditions and lack of access to adequate health care, during the COVID-19 crisis. =Prisons= The UAE runs secret prisons in Yemen where prisoners are forcibly disappeared and tortured. On June 10, 2020, Human Rights Watch urged UAE authorities to take care of the mental and physical health of prisoners due to the ongoing covid-19 outbreak in three detention facilities. Freedom of speech In the UAE, it is not permitted to be in any way critical of the government, government officials, police and the royal families. Any attempt to also form a union in public and protest against any issue, will be met with severe action.Freedom of speech in the UAE, wsws.org; accessed 27 October 2015. On 16 November 2007 Tecom stopped broadcast of two major Pakistani satellite news channels, uplinked from Dubai Media City, which was initially marketed by Tecom under the tagline \\"Freedom to Create.\\" The Dubai government had ordered Tecom to shut down the popular independent Pakistani news channels Geo News and ARY One World on the demand of Pakistan's military regime led by General Pervez Musharraf. This was implemented by du Samacom disabling their SDI & ASI streams. Later, policy makers in Dubai permitted these channels to air their entertainment programs, but news, current affairs and political analysis were forbidden. Although subsequently the conditions were removed, marked differences have since been observed in their coverage. This incident has had a serious impact on all organisations in the media city with Geo TV and ARY OneWorld considering relocation.Pakistani TV channels may move out of Dubai Media City , GulfNews.com; accessed 27 October 2015.Geo TV hints at options outside of Dubai, NDTV.com; accessed 27 October 2015. Andrew Ross, a professor at NYU was not allowed to enter the UAE (where NYU has a campus), after he had commented on the treatment of workers who built the campus there. Airline staff at the airport informed him that the UAE authorities told them that they will refuse him entry. Amnesty International released a report about violating the right to freedom of expression in the United Arab Emirates. According to the report, a prominent economist, academic and human rights defender Dr Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced to 10 years in jail by the Federal Appeal Court in Abu Dhabi. He was charged of posting false information on Twitter about UAE leaders and their policies; and the comments state that he had not been given a fair trial where he and four other Emirates prosecuted on charges of publicly insulting the countries' leaders over comments posted online. He was forcibly disappeared, held in secret detention for months and subjected to beatings and deliberate sleep deprivation. Amnesty International published a report about violating the human rights in the United Arab Emirates. According to the report, a prominent human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor was arrested at 3:15 by 10 male and two female uniformed security officials. They raided the family's apartment, carried out a lengthy room-by-room search, including of the children's bedroom, and confiscated electronic devices. He was detained for the peaceful expression of conscientiously held belief. Human Rights Watch issued a report regarding the violation of the rights to freedom of expression in the United Arab Emirates. On 15 March 2017, Tayseer Najjar, a Jordanian journalist, was sentenced to a three-year prison term and a fine of 500,000 UAE Dirhams by Abu Dhabi Federal Appeals Court. He was charged with insulting the state's symbols and criticising Egypt, Israel and Gulf countries through comments he made on Facebook during Israeli military operations in Gaza in 2014, before he moved to the UAE. Ten days after preventing him to travel to Jordan for his wife and children on 3 December 2015, UAE authorities summoned al-Najjar to a police station in Abu Dhabi and detained him. They also prevented him to contact with a lawyer for more than a year before bringing him to trial in January 2017. Najjar was set to be released on December 13, 2018, after completing a three-year prison sentence. However, his sentence was extended for another six months as he failed to pay the substantial fine. Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders urged Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, for an immediate release of the journalist. Sarah Leah Whitson, Director of Human Rights Watch said, “If the UAE were truly committed to its rhetoric of tolerance, it would not have ripped Najjar away from his wife and children for years-old innocuous Facebook posts.” Amnesty International issued a report regarding the violation of the right to freedom of speech in the United Arab Emirates. Hussain al-Najjar has served an 11-year prison sentence; he is one of a number of prisoners convicted in 2013 following the grossly unfair mass trial of 94 government critics and reform advocates. Accordingly, on 17 March 2014, the activist Osama al-Najjar who is a 28- year-old son of Hussain, was sentenced to 3 years in prison after sending tweets to the Minister of Interior expressing concern about his father who had been ill-treated in jail. During the detention, he was denied access to a lawyer for over six months and held in solitary confinement at a secret detention facility for four days after his arrest. During the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Hamad Saif al-Shamsi, the Attorney- General of the United Arab Emirates announced on 7 June that publishing expressions of sympathy towards Qatar through social media, or any type of written, visual or verbal form is considered illegal under UAE's Federal Penal Code and the Federal law on Combating Information Technology Crimes. Violators of this offence face between 3 and 15 years imprisonment, a fine of up to 500,000 Emirati dirhams ($136,000) or both. In March 2017, UAE's prominent economist, academic and human rights defender Dr Nasser bin Ghaith was arrested and imprisoned for 10 years, for his comments on Twitter related to the treatment he received during his previous arrest. Amnesty International condemned and criticised the arrest, asking for his immediate release – which is still pending. Ghaith went on a hunger strike in October 2018; his health has been deteriorating since then. Also, he was denied access to a lawyer during his trial period and still awaits justice. According to Amnesty International, Israeli company NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware was used to target human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor. citizen Lab’s August 2016 report, The Million Dollar Dissident, documents the attempts made to infect Mansoor's phone with Pegasus spyware. On 20 March 2020, Amnesty International and the Gulf Centre for Human Rights wrote a joint-letter and called for the immediate and unconditional release of rights activist Ahmed Mansoor. The groups also called the UAE as an “incubator of tolerance”. In April 2020, the authorities in the United Arab Emirates introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Arab Emirates. On May 11, 2020, a US-based gulf rights group, Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain in its report said that “impunity in the United Arab Emirates is endemic.” Their study documented tactics used by Emirati authorities to stifle dissidents, besides revealing use of torture against those recognised as imminent threat to national security. “This ‘threat’ most commonly includes human rights defenders, political opposition, religious figures, and journalists,” a statement from the report read. In June 2020, International Campaign for Freedom in the UAE (ICFUAE) informed that the UAE continues to detain human rights activists who demanded democratic reform in the country. The campaign group stated Fahad al-Hijri, Abdallah Ali Alhajery, Oman Alharethy and Mahmoud Alhoseny, all have completed their sentences, but continued to remain imprisoned. =Internet= In 2012, a cybercrime decree was issued, imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech in social networking, blogs, text messages and emails. The law outlawed criticism of senior officials and demands for political reform. The law stipulates an imprisonment and a fine of up to 1,000,000 dirhams for publishing information which is deemed to be critical towards the state. In 2015, a man was detained for commenting on his employer's Facebook page after a disagreement with his employer, even though the posts were made while the man was in the United States. Police in Abu Dhabi contacted him after he came back to the UAE and asked him to meet officers at a police station, where he was later detained. Secret Dubai was an independent blog in Dubai, from 2002 until 2010. It generated a significant following in the Middle East Blogosphere until the UAE's Telecoms Regulatory Authority (TRA) in the UAE blocked the website. In July 2016, Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain released a report accusing UAE government of enacting further laws to restrict the freedom of political and social expression. According to the organisation, Federal Law No. 12 of 2016 inhibits social and political resistance, by constraining an individual's right to privacy and the right to freedom of expression. ADHR also said counter terrorism Laws in UAE are used to legalise arbitrary arrests, detainment, prosecution and imprisonment of peaceful protestors and government critics. In 2018, Internet service providers in UAE blocked all VoIP apps, but permitting \\"government-approved VoIP apps (C’ME and BOTIM).\\" In opposition, a petition on Change.org garnered over 5000 signatures, in response to which the website was blocked in UAE. In December 2019, the US intelligence identified that the UAE, which banned VoIP options on several applications, developed its own messaging and video calling app ToTok and has been using it as a spying tool. The country had forbidden the calling options on applications like WhatsApp, Facetime and Skype, prompting suspicion over the self-developed app. Freedom of religion In recent years, a large number of Shia Muslim expatriates have been deported from the UAE, Lebanese Shia families have been deported for their alleged sympathy for Hezbollah. According to some organisations, more than 4,000 Shia expats have been deported from the UAE in recent years. Women's rights The United Arab Emirates ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 2004. This Convention regards violence against women as a form of discrimination and calls on participating governments to put measures in place to combat violence in all forms, be it domestic or public. The UAE regularly participates in and hosts international and GCC conferences on women's issues. The UAE has signed several other international treaties on protecting the rights of women. Among these are the Convention on the Rights of a Child, the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention, the Equal Remuneration Convention, the Conventions Concerning Employment of Women During the Night and the Minimum Age Convention. The 2015 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) status report on Millennium Development Goals noted that the state legislations in the UAE do not discriminate on the basis of gender with respect to education, employment or the quality of services provided. Through several initiatives women in the UAE are playing an increasingly important role in the economy, politics and technology and are viewed by some as leaders of gender equality in the Gulf region. There is an alternative for women to dissolve their marriage found under article 110 of the Personal Status Code, or khul', if the husband agrees to it in return for a financial settlement, however this means a woman relinquishes her right to the mahr – or the dowry she received as part of the marriage contract. As to custody of children, women are considered physical guardians, they have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. But if a woman chooses to remarry she automatically forfeits her right to custody of her children. Furthermore, under article 71, women who leave their husbands can be ordered to return to their marital home. = Violence against women = Marriage In one case the Federal Court sanctioned a husband's beating of his wife so long as he did not leave physical marks, and in another case a man was ordered to pay a fee for taking it too far by leaving physical injuries on his beaten wife.UAE: Spousal Abuse Never a 'Right' Further to this in 2010. Furthermore, there is growing concern at the UAE's lack of action against domestic violence. Human Rights Watch has documented three cases where it was alleged that police discouraged UK nationals from reporting cases of domestic violence. Sexual assault and harassment Women subjected to sexual assault crimes face several obstacles in seeking justice. They will often face zina charges if they report a crime committed against them. Alicia Gali was imprisoned for 8 months for sex outside of marriage after reporting an assault by her co-workers. A Norwegian woman was jailed for 16 months for reporting a rape before being pardoned and returned home. The credibility of the victim's allegations are called into question by the police and Courts will enquire as to whether alcohol was involved, whether the alleged perpetrator was known, and whether the victim resisted the attack. =Migrant workers= According to the International Labour Organization there are 146,000 female migrant domestic workers employed in the UAE. In 2014 a Human Rights Watch report spoke to domestic workers who complained about abuse and not being paid due earnings, getting rest periods or days off and excessive workloads as well as documented cases of psychological, physical and sexual abuse. The report documents how the visa sponsorship system, or kafala, and the lack of labour protections leaves migrant workers exposed to abuse. The kafala system ties a migrant worker to their employers, who act as their sponsors and makes it difficult for them to change employers. If a domestic worker attempts to leave her sponsor before the end of her contract without her sponsor's approval she will be deemed to have \\"absconded\\" which usually results in fines and deportation.Article 95 and 96(a) of Executive Regulations of the Entry and Residence of Foreigners Law Federal law No.8 excludes domestic workers from labour laws and the environment which they work in is not regulated by the Ministry of Labour. This means domestic migrant workers have fewer rights than other migrant workers. In 2012 the government stated that the cabinet had approved a bill on domestic workers, however, Human Rights Watch has received no response to requests to obtain a draft.Human Rights Watch, \\"'I Already Bought you': Abuse and Exploitation of Female Migrant Domestic Workers in the United Arab Emirates,\\" p.29 In January 2016, Amnesty international said UAE government continues to violate rights of migrant workers in the country. The international organisation said workers have been tied with Kafalah system and denied collective bargaining rights. Amnesty also said that women workers from Asia and Africa are explicitly excluded from labour law protections and particularly vulnerable to serious abuses, including forced labour and human trafficking. In March 2019, the Human Rights Watch reported that eight Lebanese nationals have been detained by the Emirati authorities on the accusations of terrorism charges, without any evidence. The defendants have been held in prolonged solitary confinement in an unknown location for more than a year, without any access to lawyers and family members. The detainees have also been forced to sign on blank papers while some of them were blindfolded. In January 2020, Emirati employers were reported to have been hiring the Indian migrant workers on tourist visas, exploiting them and leaving them helpless with illegal status. Recruiters in the UAE chose visit visas because they are cheap and quickly available than the work permits. =Employment= Many women are in paid employment in the UAE, however articles 27, 29 and 34 of the Labour Law restrict women from working at night, working a hazardous, arduous, physically or morally detrimental job or any other work that is not specifically approved by the Ministry of Labour, and working without the consent of her husband. In one case, Human Rights Watch documented that a woman who had been physically abused by her husband was in breach of the law by taking up employment without her husband's approval. Despite this, women's employment in the labour market has risen significantly and in the public sector women make up 66% of employees, with 30% of them in high level positions of responsibility.Freedom House: Women's rights in UAE, 2009 The UAE cabinet is made up of 27.5% women, all of whom play key roles in supporting innovation in the country with results indicating that the UAE is a new hub for women in technology. Women represent 50 percent of scientists in STEM programmes at UAE universities and female nationals in the nuclear sector have tripled between 2014 and 2015. =Political affairs= In 2004 the first woman was appointed as minister, Lubna Al Qasimi. In 2006, in the first parliamentary elections, the first woman was elected to the National Federal Council and in 2016, Noura Al Kaabi was named Minister of state for the NFC. Reem Al Hashimi and Shamma Al Mazrui are two other female ministers. In addition to this the UAE is one of only two countries in the Gulf that permits women to hold the position of a judge or prosecutor, with Bahrain being the first country in the region to elect a female judge in 2006.Kelly, Sanja. \\"Recent gains and new opportunities for women's rights in the Gulf Arab states.\\" Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa: Gulf Edition (2009): 1–8. =Abortion= Under article 340 of the Penal Code abortion is illegal in the UAE except where a woman's life is at risk or the unborn child has a genetic condition that will prove to be fatal. A woman who is found to have undergone an abortion can face a penalty of up to one year in prison and a fine up to Dh10,000.[Article 340, Penal Code] Women that enter hospital seeking treatment for a miscarriage can be accused of attempted abortion if they are unmarried. =Education= Education has been a prime area of growth in the whole Gulf region. Primary school completion rates have grown by 15% for girls and the UAE, as well as Qatar, have the highest female-to-male ratio of university enrolments worldwide. 77% of Emirati women enrol in higher education after secondary school and make up 70% of all university graduates in the UAE. Traditionally women were encouraged to pursue female disciplines such as education and health care but this has changed recently with surges in areas such as technology and engineering. The UAE currently has four women fighter pilots and thirty trained females in the nation's special security forces. In September 2014, the UAE opened the region's first military college for women, Khawla bint Al Azwar Military School. The state-of-the-art military college provides world- class training, physical fitness sessions and leadership development. Migrant and labour rights Construction workers at the Burj Dubai Migrants, particularly migrant workers, make up a majority (approximately 80%) of the resident population of the UAE, and account for 90% of its workforce.Essential Background: Overview of human rights issues in United Arab Emirates (UAE), hrw.org, 31 December 2005. They generally lack rights associated with citizenship and face a variety of restrictions on their rights as workers.Building Towers, Cheating Workers: Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in the United Arab Emirates, hrw.org; accessed 27 October 2015.\\"Building Towers, Cheating Workers: Exploitation of Migrant Construction Workers in the United Arab Emirates\\" (PDF), hrw.org; accessed 27 October 2015. There are reports of undocumented Emiratis who, because of their inability to be recognised as full citizens, receive no government benefits and have no labour rights. These stateless Emiratis – also known as bidun – either migrated to the UAE before independence or were natives who failed to register as citizens. In addition, there are various incidents where local individuals have ill-treated people from overseas, just on the basis of nationality or race. Emiratis receive favourability in employment via the Emiratisation programme forcing companies by law to limit the number of migrant workers in a company. This is done for the purposes of stabilising the labour market and protecting the rights of this group as a minority in their own country. At the same time, however, due to the welfare benefits of the UAE government, many Emiratis are reluctant to take up low paying jobs especially those in the private sector; private sector employers are also generally more inclined to hire overseas temporary workers as they are cheaper and can be retrenched for various reasons, for example, if they go on strikeNew emiratisation drive , gulfnews.com; accessed 27 October 2015.Call for cautious Emiratisation , GulfNews.com; accessed 27 October 2015. Most UAE locals also prefer government jobs and consider private sector jobs to be below them. Migrants, mostly of South Asian origin, constitute 42.5% of the UAE's workforce and have reportedly been subject to a range of human rights abuses. Workers have sometimes arrived in debt to recruitment agents from home countries and upon arrival were made to sign a new contract in English or Arabic that pays them less than had originally been agreed, although this is illegal under UAE law. Further to this, some categories of workers have had their passports withheld by their employer. This practice, although illegal, is to ensure that workers do not abscond or leave the country on un-permitted trips. In 2012, a workers' camp in Sonapur, Dubai had their water cut for 20 days and electricity for 10 days, as well as no pay for three months. They were told that they had been forewarned that the lease was about to expire, and their option was to go to the Sharjah camp, which the workers did not want to do because it was \\"very dirty and [had] a foul smell. * In September 2003 the government was criticised by Human Rights Watch for its inaction in addressing the discrimination against Asian workers in the emirate.Dubai: Migrant Workers at Risk, hrw.org, 19 September 2003. * In 2004, the United States Department of State has cited widespread instances of blue collar labour abuse in the general context of the United Arab Emirates. * The BBC reported in September 2004 that \\"local newspapers often carry stories of construction workers allegedly not being paid for months on end. They are not allowed to move jobs and if they leave the country to go home they will almost certainly lose the money they say they are owed. The names of the construction companies concerned are not published in the newspapers for fear of offending the often powerful individuals who own them.\\".Julia Wheeler, \\"Workers' safety queried in Dubai\\", bbc.co.uk, 27 September 2004. * In December 2005 the Indian consulate in Dubai submitted a report to the Government of India detailing labour problems faced by Indian expatriates in the emirate. The report highlighted delayed payment of wages, substitution of employment contracts, premature termination of services and excessive working hours as being some of the challenges faced by Indian workers in the city.\\"Indian government gets report on problems of Indians in UAE\\", newKerala.com, 23 December 2005. The consulate also reported that 109 Indian blue collar workers committed suicide in the UAE in 2006. * In March 2006, NPR reported that workers \\"typically live eight to a room, sending home a portion of their wage to their families, whom they don't see for years at a time.\\" Others report that their wage has been withheld to pay back loans, making them little more than indentured servants.Ivan Watson, \\"Dubai Economic Boom Comes at a Price for Workers\\", NPR.org, 8 March 2006 * In 2007, the falling dollar meant workers were unable to service debts and the incidence of suicides among Indian workers had reportedly been on the increase. Angsana Tower * Human Rights Watch reported issues during construction of Louvre Abu Dhabi museum including the confiscation of workers passports resulting in forced labour conditions. High \\"recruitment loans\\" paid by migrant workers to construction companies still had not been repaid as of 2019, according to government-paid monitors. 86% of these fees were over $2000. * In October 2020, Dubai witnessed a spike in number of homeless migrant workers. Blue collar workers from Asia and Africa claimed that they were trapped in the city after losing jobs, as the economy tightened due to COVID-19. Reports stated that many migrants gathered in the parks, as they were left abandoned with no money. It was also suggested that migrant workers from poorer countries were paid low wages, worked for long hours and often lived in cramped dormitories that were seen as coronavirus hotbeds in the UAE. =2006 workers' riots and 2007 strike by foreign workers= On 21 March 2006, tensions boiled over at the construction site of the Burj Khalifa, as workers upset over low wages and poor working conditions rioted, damaging cars, offices, computers, and construction tools. A Dubai Interior Ministry official said the rioters caused approximately US$1 million in damage. On 22 March most workers returned to the construction site but refused to work. Workers building a new terminal at Dubai International Airport went on strike in sympathy. A strike by foreign workers took place in October 2007. Many were arrested, but almost all of them were released some days later. =Government action= In the past, the UAE government has denied any kind of labour injustices and has stated that the accusations by Human Rights Watch were misguided.UAE to allow construction unions, BBC.co.uk, 30 March 2006, retrieved 24 April 2006. Towards the end of March 2006, the government announced steps to allow construction unions. UAE labour minister Ali al-Kaabi said, \\"Laborers will be allowed to form unions.\\" The strikes and negative media attention provided exposure of this regional problem and in 2008 the UAE government decreed and implemented a \\"midday break\\" during summer for construction companies, ensuring laborers were provided several hours to escape the summer heat. Illegal visa overstayers were assured amnesty and even repatriated to their home countries at the expense of friends, embassies or charities.The Times (London), \\"Growth brings slow progress on human rights\\", 15 April 2008. In July 2013, a video was uploaded onto YouTube, which depicted a local driver hitting an expatriate worker, following a road related incident. Using part of his head gear, the local driver whips the expatriate and also pushes him around, before other passers-by intervene. A few days later, Dubai Police announced that both, the local driver and the person who filmed the video, have been arrested. It was also revealed that the local driver was a senior UAE government official, although the exact government department is not known. The video once again brings into question the way that lower classes of foreign workers are treated. Police in November 2013, also arrested a US citizen and some UAE citizens, in connection with a YouTube parody video which allegedly portrayed Dubai in bad light. The parody video was shot in areas of Satwa and depicted gangs learning how to fight using simple weapons, including shoes, the aghal, etc. During the UN Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Pre-session of 2017 addressing the human rights violation affairs, a UAE delegate, Ahmed Awad departed from the session after pronouncing it as a \\"waste of time\\". On April 22, 2020, Reuters reported that about hundreds of low-income migrant workers were seen queuing up across the road outside an Abu Dhabi hospital with the temperature outdoors exceeding 35 degrees Celsius, to get tested for Coronavirus. The tests were free of charge in the entire United Arab Emirates only if the person shows symptoms, has travel history, has come in contact with a positive case. However, if not, the test costs around 370 dirham ($100). The doctors confirmed a sharp daily increase in the number of positive cases specifically in the densely populated communities that house low-income group workers. =Labour law issues= The UAE has four main types of labour laws: * Federal Labour Law – Applies to all the seven Emirates and supersedes free zone laws in certain areas. * JAFZA Labour Law – Applies to the Dubai Jebel Ali Free Zone. * TECOM Labour Law – Applies to all Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone properties: Internet City, Media City, Studio City and International Media Production Zone. * DIFC Labour Law – Applies to all companies in the Dubai International Financial Centre free zone. Labour laws generally favour the employer and are less focused on the rights of employees. The Ministry of Labour is criticised for loosely enforcing these laws, most notably late or no wage or overtime payment for both blue collar and white collar employees.Human Rights Watch – VI. UAE Labour Law, hrw.org; accessed 27 October 2015.1,600 workers march from Ajman to Sharjah over unpaid wages , gulfnews.com; accessed 27 October 2015. =How gratuity is calculated in the UAE= Working in the UAE as an employee or an employer is an enough reason to be aware of labour laws of the country regardless of employment status. Companies incorporated within UAE, be it mainland or free zones are bound to comply with the provisions of UAE Labour Law (Federal Law number 8 of 1980) which is further regulated through Ministry of Labour. Such provisions of the Labour Law oblige the employer to pay end of service benefits to the employee post expiration of his employment contract, subject to certain terms and conditions which shall be discussed in this article. End of service benefits is an extensive topic including variety of benefits wherein gratuity holds the biggest proportion thus, can be quite intimidating, considering multiple terms and conditions attached to calculating gratuity. Human trafficking and prostitution According to the Ansar Burney Trust (ABT), an illegal sex industry thrives in the emirates, where a large number of the workers are victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation, especially in Dubai. This complements the tourism and hospitality industry, a major part of Dubai's economy.Web Review: Dubai, Dubai – The Scandal and The Vice, SocialAffairsUnit.org; accessed 27 October 2015. Prostitution, though illegal by law, is conspicuously present in the emirate because of an economy that is largely based on tourism and trade. There is a high demand for women from Europe and Asia. According to the World Sex Guide, a website catering to sex tourists, Eastern European and Ethiopian women are the most common prostitutes, while Eastern European prostitutes are part of a well-organised trans-Oceanic prostitution network. The government has been trying to curb prostitution. In March 2007, it was reported that the UAE has deported over 4,300 sex workers mainly from Dubai. FRONTLINE/World – Rough Cut – Dubai: Night Secrets – The oldest profession in the newest playground, pbs.org; accessed 27 October 2015. The UAE government enshrines conservative values in its constitution and therefore has adopted significant measures to combat this regional problem. The government of the UAE has worked with law enforcement officials to build capacity and awareness through holding training workshops and implementing monitoring systems to report human rights violations. Despite this, the system led to registration of only ten human- trafficking related cases in 2007 and half as many penalised convictions.UAE- US Relations; Factsheet on \\"Initiatives to Combat Human Trafficking\\" , uae- us.org; accessed 9 February 2009. Businesses participating in exploiting women and conducting illegal activities have licenses revoked and operations are forced to close. In 2007, after just one year, the efforts led to prosecution of prostitution cases rose by 30 percent. A year later, an annual report on the UAE's progress on human trafficking measures was issued and campaigns to raise public awareness of the issue are also planned. Internationally, the UAE has led various efforts in combating human trafficking, particularly with the main countries of origin. The state has signed numerous bilateral agreements meant to regulate the labour being sent abroad by ensuring transactions are conducted by labour ministries and not profiting recruitment agencies. In 2020, International United Nations Watch released a report on trafficking to the Middle East from Europe. The documentation highlighted multiple patterns of trafficking and made a mention of how the number of Moldovan women and girls are being trafficked to the UAE. It also said that although the UAE has anti-trafficking measures in place, Dubai continues to be the “amusement park of the Arabian Peninsula\\". =Child camel jockeys= A 2004 HBO documentary accuses UAE citizens of illegally using child jockeys in camel racing, where they are subjected also to physical and sexual abuse. Anti-Slavery International has documented similar allegations.Anti-Slavery – photo gallery – Child camel jockeys in the UAE , antislavery.org; accessed 27 October 2015. The practice is officially banned in the UAE since the year 2002. The UAE was the first to ban the use of children under 15 as jockeys in the popular local sport of camel-racing when Sheikh Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, UAE's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs announced the ban on 29 July 2002.UAE enforces stringent steps to eradicate child jockeys, Khaleej Times, 24 May 2005. Announcing the ban, Sheikh Hamdan made it very clear that \\"no-one would be permitted to ride camels in camel-races unless they had a minimum weight of 45 kg, and are not less than 15 years old, as stated in their passports.\\" He said a medical committee would examine each candidate to be a jockey to check that the age stated in their passport was correct and that the candidate was medically fit. Sheikh Hamdan said all owners of camel racing stables would be responsible for returning children under 15 to their home countries. He also announced the introduction of a series of penalties for those breaking the new rules. For a first offence, a fine of 20,000 AED was to be imposed. For a second offence, the offender would be banned from participating in camel races for a period of a year, while for third and subsequent offence, terms of imprisonment would be imposed. The Ansar Burney Trust,Ansar Burney Trust – Child Camel Jockeys – Modern Day Slavery , ansarburney.org; accessed 27 October 2015. which was featured heavily in the HBO documentary, announced in 2005 that the government of the UAE began actively enforcing a ban on child camel jockeys, and that the issue \\"may finally be resolved\\".Ban on child camel jockeys \\"may finally be resolved\\" , cameljockeys.org; accessed 27 October 2015. =Victim support= Special funds to provide support for victims have been created such as Dubai's Foundation for the Protection of Women and Children, Abu Dhabi's Social Support Centre, the Abu Dhabi Shelter for Victims of Human Trafficking and the UAE Red Crescent Authority.

The first remains were discovered from the Sant Romà d’Abella fossil locality and assigned to the genus Rhabdodon, and later named as the distinct species Pararhabdodon isonensis in 1993. Known material includes assorted postcranial remains, mostly vertebrae, as well as from the skull. Specimens from other sites, including remains from France, a maxilla previously considered the distinct taxon Koutalisaurus kohlerorum, an additional maxilla from another locality, the material assigned to the genera Blasisaurus and Arenysaurus, and the extensive Basturs Poble bonebed have been considered at different times to belong to the species, but all of these assignments have more recently been questioned. Initially, the material was thought to belong to a rhabdodontid dinosaur, or some other similar type of primitive iguanodontian. Later discoveries of additional material revealed its true nature as a hadrosaur. Its placement within the group remained controversial - in 1999 it was proposed it belonged to the subfamily Lambeosaurinae, making it the first known from the continent of Europe. Later studies questioned this, instead classifying it as a more primitive hadrosauroid. In 2009 evidence was put forward that it was indeed a lambeosaurine, and more specifically a close relative of Tsintaosaurus, a genus from China. This position has been consistently found since, and the group containing them was later named Tsintaosaurini. History and assigned material =Sant Romà d’Abella material= Restoration Excavation of specimens that would later be used to erect Pararhabdodon began in Spring 1985, at the Sant Romà d’Abella (SRA) locality (in the Pyrenees near Isona, Lleida, Spain) of the Talarn Formation in the Tremp Group. In 1987, Casanovas- Cladellas et al. described remains of an ornithopod from Catalonia, including a cervical vertebra, some partial dorsals, a humerus, and a fragmentary scapula, as Rhabdodon sp.Casanovas, M.L, Santafé, J.S., Sanz, J.L., and Buscalioni, A.D. (1987).

Estudios Geológicos. Volumen extraordinario Galve-Tremp:95-110. [Spanish] New remains from this site, excavated in 1990, brought about a reconsideration of the material, and Casanovas-Cladellas and colleagues named it as the new genus and species Pararhabdodon isonense in 1993. At the time, it was still considered to be a rhabdodont-like basal iguanodont, hence the name; isonense was in reference to Isona.Casanovas-Cladellas, M.L., Santafé-Llopis, J.V., and Isidro-Llorens, A.

Morphology, radio-tomographic study, and biomechanic considerations]. Paleontologia i Evolució 26-27:121-131. [Spanish] Additional material from the type locality was collected in 1994 - including two maxillae, two dorsal vertebrae, a complete sacrum, two fragmentary ribs, and a partial ischium. The species name was corrected to isonensis in 1997 by Laurent et al..Laurent, Y., LeLoeuff, J., & Buffetaut, E. (1997). Les Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria, Ornithopoda) du Maastrichtien supérieur des Corbières orientales (Aude, France) [The Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria, Ornithopoda) from the Upper Maastrichtian of the eastern Corbières (Aude, France)]. Revue de Paléobiologie 16:411-423. [French] The new material, most importantly cranial and mandibular elements (those from the skull) led to Casanovas-Cladellas' team re-classifying it as a hadrosaurid as opposed to a basal iguanodont. In 1999 it was more specifically identified as a lambeosaurine hadrosaur, in a paper again by Casanovas-Cladellas et al.. This made it the first member of the subfamily from the continent, and the second valid hadrosaur, preceded by Telmatosaurus and the dubious Orthomerus.Casanovas, M.L, Pereda-Suberbiola, X., Santafé, J.V., and Weishampel, D.B.

(1997). Nouveaux restes de Pararhabdodon (Dinosauria, Hadrosauridae) et synthèse de l’ensemble du materiel découvert dans le Cretacé supérieur de Catalogne. In Second European Workshop of Vertebrate Paleontology, Abstracts (unpaginated). In total, known material from the type locality includes: a left and a right maxilla; five cervical, five dorsal, and one caudal vertebra; a sacrum; fragmentary rib bones; one end of the right ischium; a fragment of the left scapula, an ulna and a humerus. All of this material was excavated from a by surface, and it is thought to have belonged to a single individual. The holotype is a nearly complete caudally located cervical vertebra (a cervical vertebra located near the base of the neck), specimen number IPS SRA-1. Another cervical, a humerus, and an ulna were designated the paratype specimens. =Referred material from other localities= Maxilla MCD 4919 from the Serrat del Rostiar 1 locality, possibly from a Pararhabdodon In their 1997 paper, Laurent and colleagues referred remains from the Le Bexen site of the uppermost Cretaceous of Aude, southern France, to the genus.Prieto-Marquez, A., Gaete, R., Rivas, G., Galobart, Á., and Boada, M. (2006). Hadrosauroid dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous of Spain: Pararhabdodon isonensis revisited and Koutalisaurus kohlerorum, gen. et sp. nov. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 26(4): 929-943. Prieto-Márquez and colleagues commented on this referral in a 2006 paper, although noted they had not examined the material themselves. They concluded all the specimens, excepting one fragmentary humerus, were too poorly preserved to allow proper comparison with the holotype material. As such, they disagreed with the referral. Of the humerus, they found it distinguishable from that of the SRA material, and so also not referable to the species. First hand study for a 2013 re-evaluation of European lambeosaurine material supported these conclusions. Laurent had, in a 2003 dissertation, referred more French lambeosaurine material to Pararhabdodon, held at the Musée des Dinosaures d’Espéraza; the referral was made as the genus was at that point the only named lambeosaurine from the continent.Laurent, Y. (2002). Les faunes de vertébrés continentaux du Maastrichtien supérieur d'Europe: systématique et biodiversité (Doctoral dissertation, Toulouse 3). Prieto-Márquez et al. (2013) used this material to establish a new taxon, Canardia garonnensis. A maxilla, specimen MCD 4919, was referred to P. isonensis in 2013. It possessed traits of the tsintaosaurin tribe which Pararhabdodon was by that point assigned to. It was referable to Pararhabdodon in particular because of the rostrocaudally broad rostrocaudal region of the maxilla, a trait unique to P. isonensis among the tribe. The specimen was discovered at the Serrat del Rostiar 1 locality, part of the Conques Formation; this is part of the Tremp Group just like the type locality, but in a lower section of the strata, making it older. The referral to Pararhabdodon thus extended the range of the genus further within the upper Maastrichtian. A 2019 a paper questioned the referral of MCD 4919 to P. isonensis. The specimen was found to have a differing compared to the maxilla of the holotype, which would conflict with belonging to the same species. As the specimen was still recognized as having tsintaosaurin characteristics, the authors still considered it to likely belong to a close relative of P. isonensis. A selection of dentary material from the Basturs Poble bonebed The same 2013 study also evaluated Blasisaurus canudoi, from the Blasi 1 locality of the underlying Arén Formation, and Arenysaurus ardevoli, from the Blasi 3 locality of the La Posa Formation, another part of the Tremp Group. Previously claimed diagnostic traits of the two taxa were shown to be found in other hadrosaurs. This left the former with two unique characteristics - both in the jugal - and a unique combination of other characteristics, and the latter with only one unique characteristic - in the frontal. As overlapping fossils were not known for the relevant areas, it couldn't be ruled out that they were indeed synonymous, representatives of a single species. The same re-evaluation could not rule out that this single species or either of the separated species were synonyms of Pararhabdodon isonensis, as no taxonomically informative areas of the skeleton are known from both Pararhabdodon and the other two taxa. The authors refrained from considering any of them representatives of one species pending data from more material. A hadrosaur mega-bonebed, later termed the Basturs Poble bonebed, was discovered in outcrops of the Conques Formation during the late 1990s. The taxonomic status of this bonebed has fluctuated over time. It has been debated whether the material represents a singular species or a combination of two distinct ones; but today a single, variable species is considered most likely. It was suggested the material likely belong to Koutallisaurus, based on geographic proximity, but this reassignment was abandoned when that genus was recognized as indeterminate.Prieto-Márquez A, Gaete R, Galobart A, Riera V. New data on European Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) from the latest Cretaceous of Spain. J Vertebr Paleontol. 2007;27(3): 131A. Since then, it has instead been tentatively assigned to the genus Pararhabdodon. However, due to the lack of any suitable material for comparison and the lack of tsintaosaurin characteristics in the bonebed material, it has been more recently suggested that it should instead be considered indeterminate lambeosaur material. =Relationship with \\"Koutalisaurus\\"= Holotype dentary and only specimen of \\"Koutalisaurus kohlerorum\\", considered at different times a distinct taxon, specimen of P. isonensis, or indeterminate lambeosaurine specimen Near the village Abella de la Conca, in the 1990s, palaeontologist Marc Boada discovered a new site in the Talarn Formation, bearing dinosaur fossils. From this site, later named Les Llaus (LL), a right dentary, specimen designation IPS SRA 27, was excavated. In 1997, Casanovas-Cladellas and colleagues stated this dentary was discovered from SRA, the site where the original Pararhabdodon remains were found. The following year, they described the specimen and referred it to P. isonensis, and again stated it was from the same stratigraphic level. In 2006, the stratigraphy of the region was re- evaluated, and the dentary's location was corrected to the LL locality, away from and below the SRA locality. The same 2006 study, by Albert Prieto-Márquez and colleagues, noted that no dentary had been found at the SRA locality to compare to the LL specimen, and so they restricted P. isonensis to material known from its original locality. Additionally, they named a genus and species for IPS SRA 27, Koutalisaurus kohlerorum. The generic name is derived from the Greek word koutali, meaning spoon, in reference to the shape the jaw of the animal would've had, and the specific name honours Terry and Mary Kohler, for their support of vertebrate paleontology. One autapomorphy (unique trait) was used to diagnose the taxon as a new species: a very elongated edentulous section on the dentary, which was medially (inwardly) extended. No teeth were preserved, but there are 35 tooth positions. Several other European hadrosaur dentaries were compared based on published data, and the specimen was found to be unique compared to all of them. Though the specimen proved too fragmentary to be used for phylogenetic analysis, it was determined to be a hadrosaurid of some kind, more derived than Pararhabdodon, considered the sister taxon to Hadrosauridae. The authors noted the possibility future discoveries could lead to synonymization of their taxon with P. isonensis Diagram of the holotype skull of Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus; the taxon was compared to Koutalisaurus and Pararhabdodon and used to justify their synonymy in 2009 Evidence for this synonymy would later come in a 2009 study, from Prieto-Márquez alongside Jonathan R. Wagner. Material from Pararhabdodon, the holotype of Koutalisaurus, and material of the Chinese species Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus were examined and compared, and the edentulous slope previously thought unique to Koutalisaurus was found to be nearly identical in T. spinorhinus. It was noted various approaches could be taken to this matter. As the species K. koelerororum shared a unique trait with Tsintaosaurus and could not be distinguished from it, the former could be considered a junior synonym of the latter. However, it was noted that the likelihood of a large archosaur species with a large enough range to include both specimens is completely unprecedented, so they refrained from this referral. K. kohlerorum could instead be considered a nomen dubium, a taxon of uncertain distinctiveness due to lacking any autapomorphies. But they disliked this course of action too, as unless a second taxon with the same morphology was found in the area, they posited the specimen likely did represent a unique component of the local fauna. Thus, they decided to keep it distinct, relative to Tsintaosaurus. No material had, as yet, been discovered from the SRA locality permitting comparison with Pararhabdodon. However, traits uniting P. isonensis with T. spinorhinus were found. As both taxa from the Talarn Formation uniquely shared traits with the Asian genus, the authors decided to treat the two as one species, as maintaining them as provisionally separate would in their eyes be misleading to non-specialists, who would likely not distinguish the two taxa were kept separate to be conservative and not due to strong evidence for two hadrosaurs in the area. Prieto-Márquez returned again to the dentary in 2013, in a study alongside colleagues providing a review and investigation of hadrosaurs from all over Europe. Further preparation of the specimen in the time since his last study regarding it revealed the uniqueness of the dentary had been exaggerated significantly by reconstruction of the specimen when it was first prepared in the 1990s. The Tsintaosaurus specimens showing the similar condition were found to have been distorted from a similar process. Correcting for the inaccuracies, the Los Llaus dentary is indistinguishable from that of multiple lambeosaurines, and shares no particular connection to Tsintaosaurus. With this, their reasoning for assignment of the specimen to Pararhabdodon was voided, and the specimen is now considered a completely indeterminate lambeosaurine dentary. Description Pararhabdodon most likely was a bipedal-quadrupedal herbivore, in the neighborhood of 6 m (19.7 ft) long, fully grown. The dorsal and sacral neural spines were elongate, so the animal would have had a tall back, like other hadrosaurids. Because the material is sparse, more specific conclusions cannot be reached. Classification Modern life reconstruction of a Rhabdodon, which Pararhabdodon was originally thought to be closely related to Pararhabdodon has been classified in a number of different positions within Iguanodontia since its remains were first discovered in the mid-1980s. When the first specimens were originally discovered and described by Casanovas-Cladellas and colleagues, they were not thought to belong a new taxon at all, but merely to belong to the genus Rhabdodon, and of an uncertain species. Not long after, they would be recognized of those of a unique species, and in 1993 they were given their modern name. At this point it was still thought to be a rhabdodontid or some other type of primitive iguanodont closely related to them. This was based on the characteristics of its vertebrae, as the cranial remains had not yet been found. In 1994 these cranial remains would be found - two maxilla - and these would be used by the original authors to establish it as a species of hadrosaur. Front of a skeletal mount of a Lambeosaurus, archetypal member of the hadrosaur subfamily Lambeosaurinae which Pararhabdodon is placed in today Casanovas-Cladellas et al. revised their position for a final time in 1999, when they published a paper arguing for a position as a primitive member of the hadrosaur subfamily Lambeosaurinae - this made it the first such species known from the continent of Europe. Characters of the skeleton supporting this viewpoint were the truncated and rounded anatomy of the articulation of the maxilla to the jugal, the truncated nature of the back of the maxilla itself, the ventral deflection of the front of the dentary (thought the only known dentary was later referred to a new species, Koutalisaurus, and later declared that of indeterminate lambeosaurine), its tall neural spines, and of the humerus being distally projected. The proposal that P. isonensis was the first known European lambeosaurine was soon challenged, however. In 2001, Jason Head, in a study re-evaluating the status of another species, Eolambia caroljonesa, as a primitive lambeosaur. Both Pararhabdodon and Eolambia were found to instead be more primitive hadrosauroids more basal than the split between Lambeosaurinae and \\"Hadrosaurinae\\" (later renamed to Saurolophinae). In regards to Pararhabdodon, this was based on rebuttal of arguments put forward in the 1999 study; the present anatomy maxilla-jugal articulation was not considered a synapomorphy in Lambeosaurinae, merely the presence of this in the jugal itself, unknown in the species, and the angular deltopectoral crest is a trait present even in primitive iguanodontians. Additionally, its tooth count was lower than those of known lambeosaurs. In the 2006 re-evaluation of the genus by Albert Prieto-Márquez and colleagues, it was included in a phylogenetic analysis for the first time. This found it to be a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, a similar position as had been argued by Head. The cladogram of Prieto-Márquez et al. (2006) is seen below on the left: { width=\\"100%\\" - valign=\\"top\\"  align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"   align=\\"left\\" width=\\"50%\\"  align=\\"right\\" width=\\"40%\\"  } Modern restoration of Tsintaosaurus, today thought to be the closest relative of Pararhabdodon Prieto-Márquez would return to the issue in 2009 along with Jonathan R. Wagner. They once again turned to the articulation between the maxilla and the jugal, finding this to link Pararhabdodon to the Asian lambeosaurine, Tsintaosaurus spinorhinus. In the 2006 phylogenetic analysis, P. isonenis had been scored as having an ancestral hadrosauroid condition for this trait, which had a strong effect on its position. Upon instead coding it for a modified version of the more advanced hadrosaurid condition, the connection between the two species to the exclusion of other lambeosaurines was supported. Multiple synapomorphies were found uniting to the two taxa, as well as identifying Pararhabdodon as a member of the subfamily as opposed to outside of Hadrosauridae. This relationship was again supported in Prieto- Márquez et al. (2013), where the group containing the two genera was coined as the taxonomic tribe Tsintaosaurini; a diagnosis for the tribe was provided. Their cladogram is reproduced above, on the right.

Everett did a variety of things before joining CIDOC, including selling maps, playing professional football, printing greeting cards, and working at a tire factory. During the Second World War he was a civil servant. After the war Reimer worked for the Atomic Energy Commission, for the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, and for the Washington Research Center of the Maxwell School, University of Syracuse. After these jobs Reimer came to Puerto Rico as Secretary of Committee of Human Resources, and worked for the Alliance for Progress. Reimer met Ivan Illich in 1958 in Puerto Rico, where they jointly developed their philosophy of deschooling. Reimer then joined the Center for Intercultural Documentation (CIDOC), as the Director of the CIDOC seminar on Alternatives in Education.

Peltosaurus belongs to the anguid subfamily Glyptosaurinae. The type species Peltosaurus granulosus was named in 1873 by American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. Many additional species have been named, but most have been reassigned to different genera. For example, Peltosaurus piger, named in 1928, was reclassified as Odaxosaurus piger, and P. jepseni, named in 1942 from the Paleocene of Wyoming, but was later reclassified as Proxestops jepseni. In 1955 a new species, Peltosaurus macrodon, was named from the Eocene of California. Lizard bones from the Late Miocene of Nebraska were attributed to a new species of Peltosaurus called P. minimus in 1976, extending the fossil range of Peltosaurus and Glyptosaurinae into the Neogene. However, these bones were later referred to a genus of skinks called Eumeces, meaning that the fossil range of Peltosaurus and Glyptosaurinae does not go beyond the Paleogene. The name Peltosaurus was going to be used for the dinosaur now named Sauropelta, but when it was realized that the name was preoccupied, Sauropelta was substituted.Worth, Graeme. Peltosaurus.

It had been considered a synonym of Stenonychosaurus or Troodon for a significant time, before being declared a nomen dubium. History of discovery The holotype and only known specimen of Polyodontosaurus was collected in 1928 by Charles Mortram Sternberg, and includes only a left dentary, lacking any teeth. Sternberg presented the dentary to Charles Gilmore, who identified it as a lizard. Gilmore thus named the binomial Polyodontosaurus grandis for the new taxon. Sternberg revisited the material in 1951 and determined that it represented a carnivorous dinosaur based on the general morphology of the bone, as well as the anatomy of the Meckelian groove, multiple nutrient foramina, and separation of teeth into multiple sockets. Sternberg compared this dentary to one referred to Troodon by Russel in 1948, and decided that they belonged to the same family, and potentially the same genus. While similar, there were a few differences, that might be shown to relate to age or variation within the genus. Sternberg, therefore, referred Polyodontosaurus to the family Troodontidae, until further material could be found. The name Polyodontosaurus has been misspelled as \\"Polydontosaurus\\" by some authors. Polyodontosaurus, represented by the holotype CMN 8540, was found in the Steveville area in the Dinosaur Park Formation. It was found about below the highest layer of the formation, and comes from the MAZ (Megaherbivore assemblage zone)-2 portion of the fauna, which existed after MAZ-1. This exact stratigraphic location cannot be verified. MAZ-2 spans from 75.9 to 75.3 million years ago, CMN 8540 is from slightly above (younger) than the middle of the formation. In 1969 Dale Russell described a new specimen of Stenonychosaurus, a troodontid closely related to Saurornithoides. This specimen, CMN 12340, was from the Oldman Formation of Alberta, which lies directly above the Dinosaur Park Formation. This specimen was later named Latenivenatrix and comes from the MAZ-2 level of the formation. Because of the similarities between Polyodontosaurus, Stenonychosaurus, and more complete Saurornithoides, Russell concluded that Polyodontosaurus was a junior synonym of Stenonychosaurus, and that they both might be synonyms of the tooth-taxon Troodon, although the material of Troodon is very incomplete. Classification After being initially named as a lizard, Polydontosaurus was reclassified as a troodontid, a classification which stands today. Since 1969 Polyodontosaurus has been considered a synonym of Stenonychosaurus, and later its senior synonym Troodon. Polyodontosaurus is potentially a synonym of the taxon Latenivenatrix, named in 2017, but they may come from separate regions of the formation. Van der Reest & Currie in 2017 determined that due to the lack of sufficient material in the holotype, and that the dentaries of troodontids to not bear unique, autapomorphic features, Polyodontosaurus was a nomen dubium, and could not be considered senior synonym of Latenivenatrix. Below is the phylogenetic analysis of van der Reest & Currie (2017). Polyodontosaurus has been considered a synonym of the \\"Two Medicine troodontid\\" and Latenivenatrix previously. Paleoecology Megafaunal dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation The single specimen of Polyodontosaurus was found in the central level of the Dinosaur Park Formation, and was a member of a diverse and well-documented fauna of prehistoric animals that included such well-known dinosaurs as the horned Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Chasmosaurus, fellow duckbills Prosaurolophus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.

Financial services institutions can be divided into three sections: the front, the middle and the back office. The front office is composed of customer-facing employees such as sales personnel. The middle office is made up of the risk managers and the information technology managers who manage risk and maintain the information resources. The back office is composed of the human resources department, office managers and customer care representatives who provide support, administrative and payment services. Generally, the back and middle office involves non-revenue generating operations related to risk management and ensuring proper execution of transactions. Three contributions to middle office The middle office plays numerous roles in financial services organisations and investment banking. It ensures that deals negotiated during financial transactions are processed, booked and fulfilled. Workers manage global agreements concerning business transactions, risk management, and profit and loss. They ensure that documents are completed according to agreements. The information technology middle office designs software to support trading strategies. It manages contracted software systems such as Reuters 3000 and Bloomberg for trading. The information technology middle office assists both the back and front offices by monitoring and capturing market and marketing information.  History  The term middle office dates to 1868 as part of the origin of foreign exchange and Investment banking. Gold and silver were the standard measure of the global monetary system. Countries used these two metals when trading with other nations. During this period the term middle office was used to refer to those employees working in financial institutions whose primary role was to calculate the profits and losses realised after trading. The meaning changed during the First World War after the introduction of paper money in the international market. The term investment banking originated in America while in Britain this was referred to as merchant banking. These investment banks enabled government agencies and firms to raise money through issuing and selling of securities. These banks acted as intermediaries among trading customers. They advised companies on investments. Later, investment banks organized into front, middle and back offices. Since 2013, with the rise of regulation, more and more Hedge Funds or Asset Management companies are outsourcing their middle-office activities in order to share their costs or get access to a specific expertisehttps://www.agefi.fr/asset- management/actualites/hebdo/20151210/gerants-se-delestent-middle- office-150853.

In practice, the reality has been that the powerful can abuse the human rights of their subjects with impunity. From 1977 to 1988, Amnesty International reported that there \\"...were 1,436 alleged cases of arbitrary detention, 58 forced disappearances, 148 torture [sic] and 345 extrajudicial killings in Thailand....The authorities investigated and whitewashed each case.\\" Amnesty International's (AI) Amnesty International Report 2017/18; The State of the World's Human Rights demonstrates that not much has changed in the interim. A 2019 HRW report expands on AI's overview as it focuses specifically on the case of Thailand. As the newly elected government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha assumes power in mid-2019, Thailand's human rights record shows no signs of change according to HRW. Constitutional guarantees The 1997 constitution was abrogated in September 2006 following the military coup. The military regime imposed an interim constitution which was in effect until the 2007 version was approved a year later by referendum. The 2007 constitution was partially abrogated by the military regime that came to power in May 2014 and replaced by an interim constitution in effect until the new constitution was approved in 2016. Many new rights were introduced in the 1997 constitution. These included the right to free education, the rights of traditional communities, and the right to peacefully protest coups and other extra-constitutional means of acquiring power, the rights of children, the elderly, rights of the handicapped, and equality of the genders. Freedom of information, the right to public health and education, and consumer rights were also recognized. A total of 40 rights, compared to only nine rights in the constitution of 1932, were recognized in the 1997 constitution.Thanet Aphornsuvan, The Search for Order: Constitutions and Human Rights in Thai Political History , 2001 Symposium: Constitutions and Human Rights in a Global Age: An Asia Pacific perspective The current (2016) constitution, drafted by a body appointed by the military junta (NCPO), states in section 4: \\"The human dignity, rights, liberty and equality of the people shall be protected\\". This is unchanged from the 2007 constitution. 2007 Constitution (unofficial translation) Sections 26 to 63 set out an extensive range of specific rights in such areas as criminal justice, education, non-discrimination, religion, and freedom of expression. The 2007 constitution reinstated much of the extensive catalogue of rights explicitly recognized in the People's Constitution of 1997. That constitution outlined the right to freedom of speech, freedom of press, peaceful assembly, association, religion, and movement within the country and abroad.  Infringements  The U.S. Department of State and others have registered concerns in several areas: =Assaults on activists= Since 2018, there have been 11 physical assaults on political activists in Thailand. Police investigations of the assaults have shown no progress. Regime critic Ekachai Hongkangwarn has been assaulted seven times since 2017. Attacks have targeted his property and his person. The latest assault took place in May 2019, when he was beaten by four attackers in front of a court building. Authorities appear powerless to stop the attacks. One culprit was arrested in 2018, paid a fine, and was released. On 28 June 2019, anti-junta activist Sirawith \\"Ja New\\" Seritiwat was attacked by four assailants wielding baseball bats on a busy Bangkok thoroughfare. Earlier in June, Sirawith was attacked by five men when traveling home from a political event. In the case of the latest attack, the deputy prime minister broke the government's silence on political attacks and ordered the police to act swiftly to find the attackers. =Forced disappearances= According to Amnesty Thailand, at least 59 human-rights defenders have been victims of forced disappearance since 1998. The Bangkok Post counts 80 confirmed disappeared, and likely murdered, since 1980. A report compiled in 2018 by the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights Centre showed that at least 86 political refugees left the country after the 2014 coup d'état for coup-related reasons. The government of Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha continues to refuse to criminalize torture and enforced disappearances. Human rights advocates across Asia fear that Southeast Asian countries, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Laos, have jointly agreed to cooperate to ensnare political activists who have fled their own borders and send them back to their home nations without due process to face torture and possible death. The Bangkok Post has noted that disappearances began to happen after the Thai and Lao governments agreed in December 2017 to cooperate in tracking down persons deemed \\"security threats\\". Among those who disappeared: * Somchai Neelapaijit, human rights attorney who championed the rights of Thai-Malay Muslims in the deep south. He was abducted and killed in 2004 during the Thaksin Shinawatra administration. His body was never found and no one has been punished. * Porlajee \\"Billy\\" Rakchongcharoen, Karen-ethnic activist whose murdered remains were later discovered. * Den Khamlae, villager-turned-activist * On 22 June 2016, an anti-monarchist in Laos, Itthipol Sukpan, a 28-year-old pro-democracy broadcaster known as DJ Zunho, was snatched by unknown assailants and pulled into the woods. He was never seen again. * Wuthipong Kachathamakul, also known as Ko Tee, red shirt activist, disappeared in July 2017. * Surachai Danwattananusorn, also known as Surachai Sae Dan, a radical red shirt and critic of the monarchy, together with two aides, Chatchan \\"Phoo Chana\\" Boonphawal and Kraidet \\"Kasalong\\" Luelert. Surachai's family, a year after his disappearance, is still being held liable for 450,000 baht in bail bond fees by the Thai courts system. , the Thai police still consider Surachai a \\"missing person\\". They have failed to make progress on the case and the Thai government \\"...seems to have ignored these cases,...\\" * Siam Theerawut, Chucheep Chivasut, and Kritsana Thapthai, three Thai anti-monarchy activists, went missing on 8 May 2019 when they are thought to have been extradited to Thailand from Vietnam after they attempted to enter the country with counterfeit Indonesian passports. The trio are wanted in Thailand for insulting the monarchy and failing to report when summoned by the junta after the May 2014 coup. Their disappearance prompted an \\"alert statement\\" from the Thai Alliance for Human Rights. Their disappearance passed the one-year mark on 8 May 2020 with still no sign of the trio. * Od Sayavongm, a Lao refugee and critic of the Laotian government, disappeared from his Bangkok home on 26 August 2019 and has not been seen since. * Wanchalearm Satsaksit, an exile who left after the 2014 coup, first for Laos and then Cambodia. He was abducted in Phnom Penh on 4 June 2020 in broad daylight by several men. The Cambodian authorities initially refused to investigate the case, calling it \\"fake news\\". The Cambodians relented on 9 June, saying they would investigate while denying any responsibility. The case has galvanized numerous groups into action on Wanchalearm's behalf. According to the legal assistance group, Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, at least 86 Thais left Thailand seeking asylum abroad following the military takeover in May 2014. Among them are the five members of the Thai band Fai Yen. Their music is their crime, as some of their songs mock the monarchy, a serious offense in Thailand. The band, whose name means 'cool fire', announced on social media that its members feared for their lives after \\"many trusted people told us that the Thai military will come to kill us.\\" In August 2019 Fai Yen band members were admitted to France to seek refugee status. All of those who disappeared in late 2018 and early 2019 were accused by Thai authorities of anti-monarchical activity. =Forced repatriation= Human rights NGOs consider Thailand \\"...a place that's no longer safe for refugees.\\" Since the 2014 Thai coup d'état, Thailand has sent 109 Uighurs back to China and a further 52 have been detained for about five years. Gulenists have been refouled to Turkey and others to repressive regimes in the Middle East. Vietnamese journalist Truong Duy Nhat has been detained in Hanoi (as acknowledged by Vietnamese authorities) after being picked up on 26 January 2019 in Bangkok, right after filing for refuge with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Thai authorities are now being pressured to investigate Thai police involvement in the abduction and detention of Nhat, according to human rights NGO Amnesty International. =Freedom of speech= Critics charge that the Thai criminal code's defamation provisions are de facto threats to free speech. Both the civil and commercial codes have provisions to deal with defamation, but plaintiffs often prefer to file criminal cases against activists or the press. Criminal charges, which can result in arrest, seizure of the accused's passport if they are a foreigner, and court proceedings that may last for years, do not require the participation of police or government prosecutors but can be filed directly with a court by the accuser; courts rarely reject these cases. Slander carries a maximum sentence of one year's imprisonment and/or a fine of up to 20,000 baht, while libel is punishable by up to two years in jail and/or a fine of up to 200,000 baht. In December 2019 a Thai reporter was sentenced to two years in prison for a comment she made about worker's grievances filed against a Thammakaset Company poultry farm. She sent a tweet in 2016 in response to a ruling that the company pay 14 migrant workers 1.7 million baht in compensation and damages for having to work 20 hours a day without a break for 40 consecutive days at a wage less than the legal minimum. In her description of the ruling, she used the term \\"slave labour\\" to describe the workers' employment. Thammakaset sued her and the workers for criminal defamation, but lost the case against the workers. The court ruled that her choice of words misrepresented the facts and damaged the firm's reputation. British journalist Suzanne Buchanan reported on a series of tourist deaths and sexual assaults on Ko Tao. Though she has not been to Thailand in years, she is wanted by police who say she is peddling fake news. The Southeast Asian Press Alliance noted that freedom of speech in Thailand's domestic media environment—prior to the coup considered one of the freest and most vibrant in Asia—had quickly deteriorated following the military ousting of Thaksin Shinawatra. It noted the closure of community radio stations in Thai provinces, the intermittent blocking of cable news channels and the suspension of some Thai websites devoted to discussing the implications of military intervention to Thai democracy. SEAPA also noted that while there seemed to be no crackdown on journalists, and while foreign and local reporters seemed free to roam, interview, and report on the coup as they saw fit, self-censorship was a certain issue in Thai newsrooms. =Human trafficking= Human trafficking is a major issue in Thailand. This includes misleading and kidnapping men from Cambodia by traffickers and selling them into illegal fishing boats that trawl the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. These men are promised better paid jobs but instead forced to work as sea slaves as much as 3 years.\\"Forced to Fish: Cambodia's sea slaves\\" . The Guardian Weekly, Jan. 30, 2009. Numerous international news organizations including The Guardian, AP, and The New York Times have extensively covered the topic; The Associated Press, in particular, has won prominent awards for their coverage (although not without controversy for overstating their role in combating trafficking). Children trafficking is also another major issue in Thailand forcing kidnapped children as young as four to use as sex slaves in major cities like Bangkok and Phuket. Such activities are especially rife in rural areas of Thailand.\\" New York Review\\", 25 June 2008 Instances of forced labor in the fish and shrimp industry as well as child labour in the pornography industry are still observed in Thailand and have been reported in the 2013 U.S. Department of Labor's report on the worst forms of child laborThailand, 2013 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor and in the 2014 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor. =Right of assembly= In the wake of the 2006 and 2014 coup d'états, the right to free speech, association, and freedom of movement were seriously eroded. Military governments have implemented bans on political meetings and prohibited media criticism. Political activities of all types were prohibited. The Public Assembly Law enacted in 2015 by the military government requires a protest notice to be filed with authorities 24 hours prior to an event. A violation carries a maximum fine of 10,000 baht. The law has been repeatedly invoked by authorities to suppress gatherings since its enactment. On August 7, 2020, an activist namely, Panupong Jadnok, and human rights lawyer Arnon Nampha, were arrested in Bangkok over charges of participating in the “Free Youth” rally on 18 July along with 1000 others. They reportedly demanded a new constitution with the dissolution of parliament and asked the authorities in-charge to stop harassing people for exercising their freedom of expression and freedom of speech. The demonstrators were charged with sedition, assembly with intention to cause violence, violating the ban on public gathering, along with several other criminal charges. On 8 August 2020, the Bangkok Criminal Court ruled that the suspects should be put in a pre-trial detention at the Bangkok Remand Prison. They were released on the same day on bail, with the condition that they should never be found guilty of anymore criminal charges in future. =South Thailand insurgency= Problems have been reported in the southern provinces related to the South Thailand insurgency. Some 180 persons are reported to have died there while in custody in 2004. In a particularly high- profile case, Muslim human rights lawyer Somchai Neelaphaijit was reportedly harassed, threatened, and finally forcibly disappeared in March 2004 following his allegations of torture by state security forces. In 2006, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra stated that he believed that Somchai was dead and that state security forces appeared to be responsible. Five policemen were eventually charged in Somchai's death, though the trial only resulted in one conviction that was overturned on appeal in March 2011. The verdict was denounced by the Asian Human Rights Commission, and Somchai's wife Angkhana declared her intention to continue to appeal the case to the Thai Supreme Court. Since 2007, a number of suspected insurgents in custody have died, some with suspicious injuries. In late 2019, three young woodcutters were murdered by Thai troops in Bo-ngo Subdistrict, Ra-ngae District, Narathiwat Province. The government claimed initially that the killings occurred in a clash between paramilitary Rangers and terrorists. Later, the Human Rights Protection Committee, appointed by the Fourth Army Area Commander, concluded that soldiers mistook the dead men for terrorists and killed them as they were running away. Families of the deceased pointed out that the young men possessed nothing but wood cutting tools. Images of the dead men on social media showed that each of them was shot in the head—two of them sitting crossed-leg on the ground, leaning forward. The Commander of the Fourth Army Area issued an apology, a compensation payment of 500,000 baht for each death, and transferred the responsible commander of the 45th Ranger Forces Regiment elsewhere. From January 2004 to June 2020, Pattani, Yala, and Narathiwat Provinces, together with four districts of Songkhla Province have suffered at least 20,323 violent incidents, resulting in at least 6,997 deaths and 13,143 casualties, 61% of whom were civilians. =Torture= The Constitution of Thailand prohibits acts of torture, but the Thai legal system has no definition of torture and torture is not recognized as an offence by Thailand's legal system. In a report entitled, \\"Make Him Speak by Tomorrow\\": Torture and other Ill-Treatment in Thailand that was to have been formally released in Bangkok on 28 September 2016, Amnesty International accused the Thai police and military of 74 incidents of brutality. An Amnesty International press conference to unveil the report was halted by Thai authorities who cited Thai labour laws prohibiting visiting foreigners from working in Thailand. The three foreign speakers were Rafendi Djamin, Amnesty International Director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific, Yubal Ginbar, a lawyer working for the rights group, and Laurent Meillan, acting Southeast Asia representative for the United Nations High Commission on Human Rights. The Thai government denied the torture allegations. The government spokesman, General Sansern Kaewkamnerd, emphasized that, \\"Our investigations into such allegations have shown no indication of torture, I have seen no indication of torture and the Thai people have seen no indication of torture,...\\" Jeremy Laurence, a representative of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNOHCHR) had been scheduled to speak at the press conference. \\"This incident is another striking illustration of a new pattern of harassment of human rights defenders documenting torture in Thailand,\\" he said. Thailand has been a signatory to the United Nations Convention against Torture since 2 October 2007. Section 28 of the Thai 2016 constitution states, \\"A torture, [sic] brutal act or punishment by cruel or inhumane means shall be prohibited.\\" A bill to prevent torture and enforced disappearance will be put before Thailand's National Legislative Assembly (NLA) in late-December 2018. The bill would criminalise torture and enforced disappearances, including during wars and political unrest. The draft law specifies that the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) be responsible for investigating cases of enforced disappearance and torture. Only in events where DSI officials are accused of such crimes would police be assigned to investigate. Imprisonment for five to 25 years, and/or a fine of 100,000 to 300,000 baht would be levied on guilty parties. Were the bill to become a law, every government agency restricting people's rights would be required to maintain a database of people whose rights are restricted, actions taken, and the disposition of their cases. =2003 war on drugs= The government's antidrug war in 2003 resulted in more than 2,500 extrajudicial killings of suspected drug traffickers.\\"Thailand War on Drugs Turns Murderous, 600 Killed This Month -- Human Rights Groups Denounce Death Squads, Executions\\" .

Prison conditions and some provincial immigration detention facilities are characterized as poor. In 2004 more than 1,600 persons died in prison or police custody, 131 as a result of police actions. The Nation reported on 27 November 2007: > Of 2,500 deaths in the government's war on drugs in 2003, a fact-finding > panel has found that more than half was not involved in drug at all.

Mr. Suwit said 10 other people in his neighborhood had also > been killed after surrendering to the police. =Women's rights= To mark International Women's Day 2020 on 8 March, Protection International and a network of Thai grassroots organizations handed the government its \\"Women's Report Card\\". The government flunked in all major areas of rights protection. The assessment indicates that the government's promise to protect the rights of women is not only perceived as empty, but that the state itself is believed to be the perpetrator of violence against grassroots efforts by Thai women. Thailand is obligated under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) to safeguard women's rights and to follow policy recommendations from the CEDAW committee to right wrongs. On 30 September 2020, 110 Chief Executives of Thailand-based companies signed Women’s Empowerment Principles by UN, committing to gender equality, equal pay and a safer workplace for women. The document was signed on the 10th anniversary of the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEP). The event was hosted by \\"WeEmpowerAsia\\". Burmese refugees Burmese refugees in Thailand can stay in one of the refugee camps along the border with Burma, which protect them from arrest and summary removal to Burma but they lack freedom to move or work. Or, they can live and work outside the camps, but typically without recognized legal status of any kind, leaving them at risk of arrest and deportation. From 2005 to 2011, more than 76,000 Burmese refugees were resettled from the border camps to third countries, though the total number of camp residents has remained at about 140,000. Camp refugees who venture out of the camps are regarded by the Thai government as illegal aliens and are subject to arrest. Thai police or paramilitaries regularly apprehend camp residents and either return them to camp if the refugees pay sufficient bribes, or send them to one of Thailand's Immigration Detention Centers and then deport them to Burma. Refugees in the camps find themselves subject to abuse and exploitation at the hands of other refugees. Refugees working as camp security as well as camp leaders and camp residents with hidden connections to ethnic armed groups inside Burma all wield power in the camps.

S. Ravikumar. The film stars Rajinikanth and Meena with Sarath Babu in lead roles. The film's score and soundtrack is composed by A. R. Rahman. The film was remake of Malayalam film Thenmavin Kombath (1994). Muthu was released on 23 October 1995, during Diwali, and became a major success. The film became one of the highest-grossing Tamil films at the time, running for over 175 days in theatres across Tamil Nadu. A dubbed Japanese version released in 1998 and became a major success in Japan. This film was remade in Kannada as Sahukara.  Plot  Muthu is a kind-hearted man working in the zamin of Sivakami Ammal taking care of the chariot and the horses used by her son Raja Malayasimman. Muthu is very loyal to the zamin family and in the meantime, Muthu and Raja encounter Ranganayaki, a stage artist during their visit to a show and Raja immediately falls in love with Ranganayaki. Ambalathar is the maternal uncle of Raja and he has plans of getting his daughter Padmini married to Raja. Though Padmini loves Raja, he does not respond to her love. Muthu and Raja offer lift to Ranganayaki’s troupe for their performance and Raja signals to Ranganayaki to meet him discreetly after the show if she loves him however she does not hear Raja and walks away. Then a battle breaks out between villagers and Ranganayaki’s troupe when the performance is on going. As the battle ensues, Muthu and Ranganayaki end up falling in love with each other. After getting chased by the villagers and stranded in a remote island Ranganayaki shares about her past to him. Ranganayaki had brother in law who is a police officer in Andhra, killed her sister and is now finding her. Muthu brings Ranganayaki back to Raja’s palace. Raja falsely believes that Ranganayaki came to the palace responding to his discreet message earlier. Ranganayaki’s drama troupe faces financial issues and Raja offers jobs to the entire troupe in his zamin. Kaali is a spy for Ambalathar working in the zamin and keeps informing him about the happenings in the zamin. Kaali lies to Raja that Muthu is forcing Ranganayaki to marry him. This angers Raja and he has Kaali beat up Muthu, then orders him to leave the zamin. Sivakami gets angry on hearing about her son’s behaviour and informs him the truth that both Muthu and Ranganayaki are in love which shocks Raja. She reveals that Muthu is the real proprietor of Sivakami and Raja's property. The story moves to a flashback where it is shown that Muthu’s father is the zamindar and real owner of all the properties. Rajasekhar is the cousin of zamindar. Sivakami is married to Rajasekhar and their son Raja is adopted by the zamindar as he did not have children. Later the zamindar’s wife gives birth to a child and dies. Rajasekhar and Ambalathar plan to grab the zamindar’s properties by forging false documents. The zamindar on knowing these worries about the nature of people around him and decides to give all the properties to Rajasekhar and his family and also to leave the place along with his son Muthu. But Sivakami pleads for guilty of her husband and asks to at least give his son so that she will raise him. The zamindar hands over Muthu to Sivakami but says that he should be brought up as an ordinary man, not as a zamindar, and Sivakami agrees. Rajasekhar feels bad about his cruel activities and upon seeing the generous behaviour of the zamindar, commits suicide. The zamindar leaves the place and Sivakami moves to another town. She informs everyone that the zamindar’s child is dead as she has been asked to raise the child as an ordinary man by the zamindar. Sivakami says that the zamindar currently lives in a nearby place as a nomad and Raja, realising his mistake, decides to go and meet zamindar and bring him back. Kaali overhears the conversation made between Sivakami and Raja and informs to Ambalathar. Now Ambalathar decides to murder Raja and frame Muthu so that he can take over all the zamin properties. But he is saved by zamindar and is married to Padmini. Finally, Muthu comes to know all the truth and wishes to see his father but he leaves the place before Muthu could reach there. He asks Sivakami whether his father didn't like him and regrets that at least while leaving he could've blessed him. Suddenly in a fast wind, his father's robe flies in the air and falls on him. Muthu considers it as a sign of blessing and prays in silence. Muthu becomes the new zamindar, but prefers to see himself as a worker.

P. Pratap Rayudu * Kanthimathi as Poongavanam *Pandu as Pallavarayan *Kumarimuthu as Kamalakannan *K. S. Ravikumar as the Tamil-speaking Malayali (cameo appearance)  Production  Muthu is a loose remake of the 1994 Malayalam-language film Thenmavin Kombath. It was directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who also wrote the screenplay, making substantial changes to suit Rajinikanth's image and the tastes of Tamil- speaking audiences. Although the film was produced by K. Balachander's company Kavithalayaa Productions, Balachander was not credited as producer; Rajam Balachander and Pushpa Kandaswamy were. Jayaram was offered a role but declined since it involved slapping Rajinikanth; the role went to Sarath Babu. Years later Jayaram recalled, \\"if I had slapped Rajni in Muthu, his fans would have taken me apart!\\" Shooting locations included Kerala, and the Lalitha Mahal in Mysore.  Themes  Numerous critics have felt that the dialogue \\"Naan eppo varuven, epdi varuvennu yarukkum theriyathu. Aana vara vendiya nerathula correcta vandhuduven\\" (Nobody knows when or how I will come, but I will come when the time is right) hinted at Rajinikanth's political aspirations.http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/birthday-special-rajinikanths- hit- dialogues/20161212.htmhttps://www.indiatoday.in/movies/celebrities/story/thalaivar- rajinikanth-political-dialogues-in-tamil- fims-977821-2017-05-18http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/2018/jan/01/the- longest--teaser-rajinikanth-may-have-hinted-his-political-debut-with-his-film- dialogues-1741284.html Writing for Mint, Shoba Narayan said that Rajinikanth's heroines play to every traditional stereotype, beginning with their names, and cited Ranganayaki (Meena's character) as an example, adding, \\"The names set the tone for the character.\\"https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/hlKt3H7p6zzeLkCA0TOV4K/All-is- well-in-the-Rajini-world.html  Music  The soundtrack was composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by Vairamuthu. Muthu is the first Rajinikanth film for which Rahman composed music. The soundtrack for this movie turned out to be a major hit and Rahman gained popularity in Japan when the movie was released in Japanese. The Hindi version is titled Muthu Maharaja and had lyrics penned by P. K. Mishra, whereas the Telugu version of Muthu is penned by Bhuvanachandra.http://www.telugufm.com/modules/music/moviedetail.aspx?mid=10643 The \\"Omanathinkal Kidavo\\" portion of \\"Kuluvalilae\\" is written and composed by the famous Malayalam poet Irayimman Thampi. The song \\"Vidukathaiya\\" is set in Chakravakam raga. The video for the song \\"Thillana Thillana\\" became famous for the belly dance of Meena featuring a lot of closeup shots of her navel. Rahman sampled African humming in the song; French group Deep Forest had earlier sampled the same in their song \\"Night Bird\\". \\"Thillana Thillana\\" was later adapted by Nadeem-Shravan as \\"Deewana Deewana\\" for the 1996 film Jung. The soundtrack of Muthu was selected as the most popular foreign soundtrack in Japan. The songs from Muthu were later retained in the Kannada remake Sahukara (2004), though Rajesh Ramanath was credited for the music.  Release and reception  Muthu was released on 23 October 1995, on Diwali day. The film was a blockbuster and completed a 175-day run at the box office. It was dubbed into Telugu under the same title. It was also dubbed in Hindi as Muthu Maharaja and was distributed by Eros Labs. Indolink wrote \\"What makes the movie charming is the clean, simple hearted humour, and of course the unfailing Rajnikanth formula – dances, punch lines, fights, comedy, and restrained doses of preaching. And add some political undercurrent in the dialogue/lyrics, you have a jubilee film\\".https://web.archive.org/web/19970607043707/http://www.indolink.com/Film/muthu.html  Japanese version  In 1996, Japanese film critic Jun Edoki discovered the film at a video shop in Singapore's Little India. He said, \\"[Muthu] was absolutely fascinating—even without subtitles\\". He then approached several Japanese distributors to release the film in Japan, before Xanadeux eventually agreed to release it. In 1998, the film was dubbed in Japanese, by the distributor Xanadeux. It was given the Japanese title , which means Muthu – The Dancing Maharaja.Mutu: Odoru Maharaja It initially had a limited release on 13 June 1998 at Cinema Rise in Tokyo's Shibuya district, where it completed a 23-week run, selling 127,000 tickets and grossing (). It was the theatre's highest-grossing film of 1998, with distributor Atsushi Ichikawa describing it as \\"the 'Titanic' of the art theaters\\". It then received a nationwide release across 100 theatres, drawing nearly 500,000 audiences and grossing , which was equivalent to () in 1998, or () adjusted for inflation. Prior to Muthu, the previous highest-grossing Indian film in the country was the Shah Rukh Khan starring Bollywood film, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman (1992), which released in Japan in 1997. Muthu surpassed it to become the most successful Indian film in Japan, as well as becoming 1998's top film in the category of independent “first-run show” theatres. The success of Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman and especially Muthu sparked a short-lived boom of Indian films released in Japan, up until 1999. Muthu was also the second highest-grossing 1995 Indian film overseas, behind only another Shah Rukh Khan starring Bollywood film, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

It mainly broadcasts American films and hit series but also reality shows, comedy, travel, international shows and local productions including Expeditie Robinson, Holland's Next Top Model & Benelux' Next Top Model, Dutch versions of America's Next Top Model, Dutch version of Project Catwalk', So You Think You Can Dance and a Dutch version of ITV's Take Me Out. Officially RTL 5 - along with RTL 4, RTL 7 and RTL 8 - is headquartered in Hilversum, broadcasting with a Luxembourg TV license. This allows them to avoid more severe control by the Dutch media authorities as Luxembourg's television watchdog is less strict. History RTL5 logo from 2012-2017 RTL 5 started as RTL V via the Astra 1C satellite on 2 October 1993. The programming mainly consists of shows about cars and programmes for men. In 1994 it changed the Roman number V into 5. In 1995 Veronica joined RTL 4 S.A., starting a joint venture called HMG (Holland Media Groep), and with three major channels RTL could disrupt the television market in the Netherlands. Therefore under pressure of the European Commission the channel was rebranded as RTL 5 Nieuws & Weer (in English: RTL 5 News & Weather) between 1997 and 1998. RTL 5 became a thematic news channel. In 2001 the European Commission reversed the restrictions for RTL 5 because competitive channels had been launched in the Netherlands. In 2001 a Business and Financial News block called RTL Z started on RTL 5 during daytime. RTL Z moved from RTL 5 to RTL 7 on 12 August 2005. Since 2005 RTL 5 has become a 24-hours channel.

The school is named after Archbishop Joseph Rummel, a former Archbishop in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Tradition Archbishop Rummel is a high school dedicated to educating the young men of the eastbank of Jefferson Parish; Archbishop Rummel is owned by the Archdiocese of New Orleans and administered and staffed by lay and religious personnel. Archbishop Rummel High School is accredited by the Department of Education of the State of Louisiana and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, and is nationally recognized as a Secondary School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education. The school continues the tradition of the Christian Brothers who responded to the request of the Archdiocese of New Orleans in 1962 to conduct the school. For a period of 31 years (1962–1993), the Christian Brothers provided administrators and faculty who brought into the school the 315-year tradition of St. Jean- Baptiste de la Salle, the founder of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, who was named patron of all teachers by Pope Pius XII on May 15, 1950. On February 19, 2013 Archbishop Rummel High School officially re-associated itself with the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Brother Tim Coldwell, FSC, Visitor of the New Orleans-Santa Fe District and Archbishop Rummel alumnus, presented the certificate of re-association to Brother Gale Condit, FSC, Archbishop Rummel High School president. History Opened on September 10, 1962, Archbishop Rummel High School was one of four archdiocesan Catholic high schools established for students of Jefferson Parish, a New Orleans suburb, as a result of an archdiocesan campaign. On that first day of class, 225 freshmen formed the charter class of the school. In its second year, with the admission of nine freshman classes, the school had an enrollment of almost 600 students. Additional freshman classes were added each year until the 1965–66 school year when the school was a complete high school with 1,100 students. The charter class of 222 was graduated on May 27, 1966. The school operated as a four year high school until 1981 when the Archdiocese of New Orleans gave permission for the school to begin an eighth grade program for the 1982–83 academic year. The senior high school plant occupies one third of the campus and consists of five separate building adjoined by covered walkways. The remaining portion of the campus is structure-free for athletic programs and future development. The senior high campus is divided into the faculty office wing, the administration-library wing, and the classroom wings completing a quadrangle in the center of which is the school chapel. A senior wing was added in 1966 to accommodate the first senior class. Additionally, in 1985 the school purchased the former Stuart Prep property adjacent to the school to use for a junior high campus. The school cafeteria and gymnasium are located on the senior high campus. In memory of the Nelson-Smyth family of Chicago, the gymnasium was dedicated in May 1963. A building program that saw the construction of the senior wing also included the music building, an athletic field house, and an addition to the faculty office wing. During the 1980–81 school year, the school enclosed the area under the senior wing to make a student mall and also added a weight room to the field house. The Brothers of the Christian Schools (Christian Brothers) conducted Archbishop Rummel High School through June 1993, when they relinquished governance to the Archdiocese of New Orleans. On February 19, 2013 Archbishop Rummel High School officially re-associated itself with the Brothers of the Christian Schools. Two Christian Brothers currently remain on staff for the school year. They and lay men and women comprise the administration, faculty, and staff of the school. From 2001 to 2011 enrollment declined by 34%. Michael Scalco, an alumnus of Rummel, became principal in 2005 and left in 2008. In 2011 Thomas Moran Jr., the next principal, quit, and the school brought Scalco back as principal. By 2011 there were 890 students. That year Scalco stated that his plan was to get enrollment to increase again. From 2013-2014 the enrollment declined by 3%, down to 684. Scalco announced he was resigning in 2015.  Blue Ribbon Award  On September 28, 1989, Archbishop Rummel High School was recognized as a Secondary School of Excellence by George H. W. Bush at ceremonies in Washington, D.C. Created by the Secretary of Education in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Recognition Program's purpose is to identify and honor America's outstanding public and private schools. To receive recognition, Archbishop Rummel was nominated by the Council for American Private Education and then passed a rigorous screening and two-day site visit. The school was then recommended to the Secretary of Education who presented the award to Archbishop Rummel representatives.  Academics  The Program of Studies at Archbishop Rummel High School is the result of the continuous work of the Curriculum Committee. It complies with the requirements of the Louisiana State Board of Education, the Louisiana Tuition Opportunity Program for Students (TOPS), the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS), and the general entrance requirements of universities and colleges. The Louisiana State Board of Education, the Office of Catholic Schools of the Archdiocese of New Orleans, and the Archbishop Rummel Curriculum Committee, have approved these requirements. The primary purpose of a Catholic high school like Archbishop Rummel is the faith development of its students. With this as its goal, the gospel values and teaching of faith are integrated throughout the school curricula and programs. The religion program, classroom instruction, prayer and worship opportunities, retreats, and service projects articulate the unique Catholic identity of the school in its faith development of the students, as well as that of the total school community. Therefore, it is essential that every student participate fully in the total program.

The access to basic human rights remains limited, as corruption in the government, leading to the systematic abuse of the human rights of its citizens, slows down the progress of democratic and social reform in the country. According to the US Department of State's report on human rights in Tajikistan, citizens are denied many of their rights and have limited ability to change the system of government. The report found this to be especially true in the case of prisoners, whose access to basic Human Rights was inadequate: there have been reports of torture, threats, and abuse of prisoners and detainees by security forces due, in part, to their ability to act with impunity. The denial of the right to a fair trial for those who stand accused of a crime has been identified as another issue, which can often contribute to harsh and life-threatening prison conditions as well as the blocking of international access to Tajikistan prisons. Pre-trial detention is typically longer than needed, and court proceeding are controlled by the prosecution. Prisons are overcrowded, and the incidence of tuberculosis and malnutrition is high among inmates. Other restrictions include restrictions on media, freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom of worship, as well as restrictions on political opposition. Registration and visa difficulties, violence and discrimination against women, human trafficking, and child labour have also been reported. Tajikistan is also reported to be both a source and a transit point for human trafficking. Intimidation and killings of journalists It has been reported that, in the 1990s, dozens of journalists were killed or disappeared under mysterious circumstances in Tajikistan. Together with increasing attacks on journalists, the 2005 parliamentary elections brought increased closures of independent and opposition newspapers. In 2003, the government blocked access to the only internet website run by the political opposition and in June 2014, YouTube was partially blocked by the government.YouTube Partially Blocked In Tajikistan By RFE/RL's Tajik Service, June 10, 2014, http://www.rferl.org/content/youtube- partially-blocked-in-tajikistan/25416452.html Name change law According to Ilan Greenberg, writing in the New York Times in 2007, The President of Tajikistan Emomalii Rahmon, stated that the Slavic \\"-ov\\" ending must be dropped for all babies born to Tajik parents. The policy came about in the wake of recent policies intended to remove vestiges of Russian influence on the country. In light of this, some Tajiks have expressed confusion or opposition at the denial of the freedom to choose the name for one's child. Freedom of religion Some activities of religious groups have been restricted by the requirement for registration with the State Committee on Religious Affairs. Islamic pilgrimages are restricted, and religious groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses have suffered occasional persecution: since October 22, 2007, Jehovah's Witnesses have had their practices banned by the government. Allegations of systematic violence against military conscripts In June 2014 Global Voices Online reported that the practice of systematic violence against military conscripts (referred to as dedovshina) had risen to public awareness following a recent increase in incidences of manslaughter and suicides in the Tajik Army, and the April 17, 2014 death of Akmal Davlatov, who was beaten to death by his lance sergeant.Tajikistan's Army Chokes Young Draftees to Death, Posted 10 June 2014 8:57 GMT , http://globalvoices.org/2014/06/10/tajikistans-army-chokes-young-draftees-to- death/Radio Free Europe, 11 июня 2014, Таджикистан, Дело о «поперхнувшемся хлебом» солдате направлено в суд, http://rus.ozodi.org/content/article/25411009.html Kidnapping of recruits was said to be a common practice in Tajikistan and victims have sometimes videotaped their own kidnappings.YouTube, Published on Apr 11, 2012, видео, добавленное с мобильного телефона, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogYXVMin43A  Examples of human rights violations  Within the country of Tajikistan, human rights violations have been a regular occurrence among the locals due to the refusal of rights from the government. These rights include religious rights, women's rights, journalists' rights, political rights and many more; these were established not only by the United Nations but the constitution of Tajikistan. When the country of Tajikistan became an independent nation after being under the control of the Soviet Union, a constitution was established in 1994. Chapter 2, Articles 14 to 47 of the Constitution of the Republic of Tajikistan is titled \\"Rights, Liberties, [and] Basic Duties of Individuals and Citizens\\". This chapter of the constitution states basic rights for the people of Tajikistan such as the rights to life and judicial protection. There have been many instances where the Government of Tajikistan has not upheld this constitution. During 2016, human rights within Tajikistan were frequently violated, including imprisonment of opposition party members and leaders and persecution of human rights lawyers. Modification of the constitution by President Emomali Rahmon paved the way for him to reign over the country until his eventual death. The government of Tajikistan has made multiple arrests of activists within other nations that oppose government policies and ‘corruption’. In the year 2013, the Tajik government passed a law stating that torture while in custody was considered illegal, yet a UN report shows that these acts still occur. Men continue to violate the constitution by participating in physical, mental and sexual abuse against women. This has affected about a third of the women living in Tajikistan. Tajikistan continues to struggle with human rights. High rates of unemployment, poverty, and crime contribute to this ongoing problem.

The book was written by Kelly Holden- Bashar and Joel McCrary with music by Allen Simpson and lyrics and additional material by Brian D. Bradley, Lisa Fredrickson, Kelly Holden-Bashar, Joel McCrary, Edi Patterson, Steve Purnick, Cory Rouse, Allen Simpson, Ryan Smith, Peter Allen Vogt and Matthew Stephen Young. The musical was first performed at the El Portal Forum Theater in North Hollywood, California. Synopsis The play follows the major events of Tolkien's story. It re-imagines Bilbo Baggins as an aged Jewish comedian, the Balrog as a sleep-deprived diva, the battle on Weathertop as a West Side Story-style gang fight, and Rivendell as a Scientologist stronghold. Part live action, part puppet show and part animation, the show removes or summarizes parts of the story that would slow it down. While played for laughs, the music features original compositions instead of parodies, and the song styles range from cheesy 1980s rock to sleazy cabaret numbers. Productions The play had a successful six-week run in early 2005, and played several sold-out shows at the 2005 San Diego Comic Con. L.A.

Early life Born and raised in Philadelphia, the son of Lucius Cole, a violinist in the Philadelphia Orchestra, he entered the first class of the Curtis Institute of Music in 1924 as a pupil of Felix Salmond and graduated in 1934. He was a founding member in 1927 of what was then known as the Swastika Quartet.Barbara B. Heyman (1992) Samuel Barber: The Composer and His Music. p.42. In 1932, shortly before Adolf Hitler's election and adoption of this symbol (albeit rotated), the fledgling quartet renamed itself as the Curtis String Quartet after the school's founder, Mary Louise Curtis. Collaboration with Samuel Barber During this time, Cole was a classmate and friend of the composer Samuel Barber, who dedicated his Cello Sonata, op. 6 to Cole. Mr. Cole and the composer collaborated closely on its composition, reading a page at a time as it was written, until they gave the work its premiere in New York's Town Hall in 1933. Barber wrote also wrote his Quartet, op. 11, with its famous adagio, for the Curtis Quartet. The ensemble played this work from manuscript for several years, and it was only when the time of publication arrived that Barber chose to make major changes: the first movement was shortened significantly, with its coda ultimately becoming the finale of what is now the third movement, and the original contrapuntal third movement was abandoned entirely in favor of a reprise of the first movement's basic thematic material. In the years since, several ensembles have sought to perform this original version, but Barber's longtime companion, Gian Carlo Menotti, the holder of his copyrights, forbade it. Barber acknowledged to Cole in a letter accompanying the manuscript score sent from Rome attesting to the composer's great confidence in the slow movement. The quartet's first performance of the work in Curtis Hall is testament to the same - so rapturous was the audience's response following the adagio that the ensemble was compelled to encore it right away before continuing on to the finale. Samuel Barber also composed for the Curtis String Quartet his work for voice and string quartet, Dover Beach, set to the lyric verse of the same name by Matthew Arnold. The vocal line was originally sung by Rose Bampton in its premiere in Curtis Hall and recorded in this form, but as the composer was dissatisfied with the work's dramatic impact given the male personage of the text, Samuel Barber chose to sing it himself for its recording in 1935. An earlier piece, the Serenade, was also written for the Curtis String Quartet, though it fell quickly from the composer's favor and is rarely played today. The Curtis Quartet The Curtis String Quartet was a pioneer in its time and earned great acclaim: as the foremost string quartet in America during the prewar years; the first touring quartet to be trained entirely in the United States; and as the first American quartet to tour Europe, including a command performance before Mary of Teck, Queen Consort of George V of the United Kingdom. The ensemble undertook two extensive and triumphant tours of the United Kingdom and the European continent during the seasons 1936-37 and 1937–38, and were scheduled to continue the same until the outbreak of World War II. At a time when gramophone recordings were still a rarity and chamber music had not yet taken hold in the United States, the Curtis String Quartet served as ambassadors, giving over 5000 concerts in its career and often presenting the first quartet performances heard by the communities in which they played. Before disbanding in 1981 due to the death of Max Aronoff, the founding nucleus of Brodsky, Aronoff, and Cole remained intact. The quartet was formalized in 1932 with members Jascha Brodsky, Benjamin Sharlip, Max Aronoff, and Cole, but shortly after, Sharlip resigned and they engaged Charles Jaffe as their second violinist; it was with him that they achieved many of the aforementioned milestones. Cole's primary instrument, the 1739 'Sleeping Beauty' by Domenico Montagnana, was a gift to him which had been purchased for $17,000 in 1952. It was with this instrument that the Curtis String Quartet's best known recordings for Westminster Records were made, among them Dvořák's American Quartet and Smetana's Quartet in E Minor From My Life; Mendelssohn quartets, opp. 12 and 44, no. 1; Schumann quartets, op. 41, nos. 1 and 3; Debussy and Ravel quartets; the Franck Piano Quintet; and two works of Ernő Dohnányi, the Quartet in Db-Major, and the Piano Quintet No. 2. In the two works with piano, the Curtis String Quartet was joined by their longtime friend and collaborator, the pianist Vladimir Sokoloff. Teaching career Cole taught at the Curtis Institute of Music for seventy-five years, first as Salmond's assistant while still a student and then in succession of his own teacher. There was a brief gap in his tenure at the school, however, during the years following World War II. The members of the quartet had grown dissatisfied with certain of the objectives and policies of the school and decided to found their own institution for the training of chamber and orchestral musicians, called the New School of Music which was located just a few blocks from Curtis and, for more than thirty years, served as an important training center. After returning to their duties at Curtis in 1953, Cole and the members of the quartet taught concurrently at both schools. After the 1981 death of the ensemble's violist, Max Aronoff, who was also director of the New School, the school was absorbed into Temple University where Cole and Brodsky continued to teach. Cole gave master-classes all over the world. In 2005 he was appointed to the emeritus faculty of the Curtis Institute.

It is situated along the east bank of the Nakdong River, and since 2003 has been divided into three dong, Hwamyeong 1, 2, and 3-dong. The total area of the three dong is approximately . It was made to serve the role of commuter town of Busan, and it is home to about 99,000 people on the date of February 2020.  Name  The name Hwamyeong, has many view of where it is derived from. The most reliable theory is that Mt. Geumjeong, which is the mountain surrounds Hwamyeong, has another name, Mt. Hwa. It is originated from being called an ideal or bright place near Mt. Hwa, and the Chinese letter for ideal is pronounce 'myeong' in Korean, when put together, it becomes 'Hwamyeong'. Second theory is that the place's original name was Hwe-Bulgi, which means 'bright sun' or 'red sun'. The sun was interpreted as shining, and the adjectives were interpreted as bright with the Chinese character. The literal translation of name's current meaning is 'brightly shining'. It was first attached to the region in 1914, during the period of Japanese rule. At that time it was Hwamyeong-ri, a subdivision of Gupo-myeon. In 1963, it became a dong, part of Busanjin-gu. In 1978, it was transferred to Buk-gu, which it remained a unitary part of until its division in 2003.  Transportation  Hwamyeong Station lies on the Gyeongbu Line, and is served by several Mugunghwa-ho and Tonggeun trains daily. The number of subway station in Hwamyeong-dong is two, which are named Hwamyeong station(Busan Metro) and Sujung station(Busan Metro). Train station Bus number that stops in Hwamyeong-dong is: Busan city bus 15, 59, 111, 111-1, 121, 126, 300, and 1009. Yangsan city bus 21, 23, and 23-1. Busan town shuttle Gyeumjung 1, Bookgu 3, Bookgu 7, and Bookgu 7-2.  Tourism  Hwamyeong ecology park is located near Hwamyeong Station. It has walking trails, baseball parks, soccer fields, tennis courts, basketball courts, an in-line skating rink, and many other amenities for the public to enjoy. At the southern end of the park, there is natural lotus habitat along with an adjacent aqua sports center and outdoor pool, which is open to the public during the Summer. Hwamyeong arboretum can be found along the banks of the Daechun stream, which traverses Hwamyeong-dong. It has over 200,000 varieties of plants for visitors to observe, and is conveniently located adjacent to the Geumjeongsan hiking trail network. Visitors can look up where certain plants are located using the electronic plant dictionary provided on the website. The Busan Fishing Village Folk Museum is located right in front of Hwamyeong station. It presents exhibitions detailing the fishing activity of Busan folk villages through the ages, traditional fishing technologies, historic sites, and folklore. The museum also has experiential learning programs for children to help them to understand life before Hwamyeong's rapid development and modernization. The Hwamyeong Rose Park is right next to the Busan Fishing Village Folk Museum. It is a botanical park divided into 49 sections containing different rose species, and is especially popular during May and June, when the roses are in bloom. A basketball court, a football field, and a multipurpose sports field can also be found within the park.

Biography She was born in poverty in Tilbury, Ontario as Margaret Finlayson, daughter of John Finlayson, a farmer and mechanic, and Ann Mather. She was one of the most famous Shakespearean actresses in the 1880s, although her reputation arose as much from clever publicity as from her skill. She premiered as Juliet in New York at the Union Square Theater in 1885. Heavy advance publicity guaranteed a large turnout, but response to her performance was mixed. While she was striking in her physicality and energy, many critics found her too indecorous and overbearing, particularly in the later acts. In the following years, she toured the country and returned to New York, to perpetually mixed reviews. Her noteworthy roles included Lady Macbeth, the title role in Bulwer-Lytton's The Lady of Lyons and in Augustin Daly's Leah the Forsaken. She was a manifest failure as Joan of Arc in a translation of Jules Barbier's play on that subject in 1890. She retired early in the decade, after marrying Gustave Pabst, scion of the Pabst Brewing Company, but they divorced after she threatened him with a whip. She returned as Imogen in Cymbeline. The production, at Wallack's Theatre,Brown:356-7 was lavish, costing forty thousand dollars, but it failed; the play was too little-known to attract large audiences, and Mather herself was judged too emotional to succeed in the role. She toured the US and Canada in 1883–1884 in the role of Juliet and As You Like It. She suffered from a chronic illness and died April 7, 1898 in Charleston, West Virginia. She was in performance of Shakespeare's Cymbeline and fell unconscious during the performance, dying that evening.New York Times April 8, 1898 Margaret was buried in a white gown from her role as Juliet on Easter Sunday.

Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent (29 April 1915 – 21 December 2005) was a Cronista Rey de Armas (\\"Chronicler King of Arms\\") of the Kingdom of Spain. Biography A native of Madrid, Spain, Cadenas was born on 29 April 1915, the son of Francisco de Cadenas y Gaztañaga and Vicenta Vicent y Nogués. Beginning in 1932, he studied the fields of history and journalism, at the University of Madrid. He maintained dual professions as both the Chronicler of Arms and as a journalist. He was for many years a member of the Deputation of the Constantinian Order, of which he was Secretary and which he joined in 1960 upon the succession of the Infante D. Alfonso as Grand Master. Cadenas founded the Asociación de Hidalgos a Fuero de España in 1954 to obtain the recognition of the untitled nobility(nobleza llana). In 1953 he founded the review Hidalguía (with the particular aim of challenging false genealogies, fake titles and pseudo orders of chivalry) and the Instituto Internacional de Genealogía y Heráldica. The following year he founded the Instituto Luis de Salazar y Castro and in the following years the Colegio Mayor Marqués de la Ensenada, the Casasolar Santo Duque de Gandía, and the Casa Quinta Vita Natural Durante, each of which were dependent on the Association of Hidalgos. He also organized two meetings of the International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Madrid (1955 and 1982) The 15th Congress met in Madrid from 19 to 25 September in 1982 under the presidency of His Royal Highness Infante Carlos, Duke of Calabria (a cousin to King Juan Carlos I of Spain who opened the meeting) with Vicente de Cadenas serving as one of three vice presidents. He published books and articles on historical themes as well as heraldry, genealogy, chivalric orders and documentary sciences. Between 1976 and 1991, Vicente wrote articles on three of the four Spanish military orders: the Order of Alcántara, the Order of Calatrava, and the Order of Santiago. Actas del último consejo nacional de Falange Española de las J.O.N.S.

Additionally, because of inadequate sanitation facilities, untreated industrial waste (particularly from aluminum production) and sewage combine with agricultural runoff to cause water pollution in the Aral Sea Basin. Soviet-Era mining operations in Tajikistan extracted and processed uranium, gold, antimony, tungsten, mercury, and molybdenum, each of which is known to leave toxic waste that also threatens water quality. Pockets of high air pollution caused by industry and motor vehicles have resulted in Tajikistan ranking 133rd in the world in greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution is a particular problem during times of the year when atmospheric conditions hold industrial and vehicle emissions close to the surface in urban areas. In summer, dust and sand from the deserts of Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan cause air pollution across the entire southwestern lowland region. Although a destructive civil war, budget shortfalls, poverty, and the dissolution of the Soviet Union reduced industrial and agricultural activity, these issues, as well as the destruction of infrastructure and loss of Soviet programs (such as the Committee on Nature Protection, state-owned agriculture, and region-wide networks of hydroposts) have amplified environmental concerns. Additionally, the Tajik government is hesitant to acknowledge these concerns, which has tensed its regional relationships.  Water Scarcity  In 2010, 64% of the Tajik population had access to potable water, 54% in rural areas and 92% in cities. Water shortage first became a threat in Tajikistan under the Soviet Union's pressure to expand cotton cultivation in Central Asia. During this time, minimal regulation on water use was implemented and much of it was allocated towards irrigation. The Tajik government has since expanded limits on water use, however the agencies involved in their application lack the effective judicial and legal systems necessary to implement them. Agriculture accounts for 90% of Tajikistan's water use, and 33% of Tajikistan's irrigated land is used to cultivate cotton. Much of Tajikistan's irrigation and water treatment systems have not been updated since the end of the Soviet Era, after which a catastrophic civil war ravaged much of the countryside and further damaged already corroding infrastructure. Cotton irrigation uses a majority of Tajikistan's water resources, however the equipment used for irrigation, being outdated, is inefficient and loses a majority of the water it carries. Tajikistan has been slow to update these water systems due to a multitude of political and economic factors, such as a limited budget and mounting debt since the conclusion of the civil war. Additionally, Tajikistan has undergone pressures to cultivate less resource-heavy crops, which have been met by resistance from a politically influential cotton industry. Climate change is expected to particularly affect Central Asia in terms of water scarcity. By 2030, demand for water sourced from glaciers in Tajikistan is projected to increase by a third, while glacial runoff is expected to decrease by 30%. As a result, Tajikistan's water use has complicated its relationship with its neighbors. Irrigation, in addition to the construction of hydroelectric dams like the Rogunon the Vakhsh, Panj, and Amu rivers without consultation, has resulted in water shortages and public outcry in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, as well as contributed to the shrinking of the Aral Sea.  Pollution  13% of Tajiks have access to public sewage and 34% are without indoor plumbing or lavatories, resulting in 38% of the population depending on water from potentially contaminated sources and subsequent outbreaks of typhoid and cholera. This lack in infrastructure dates back to the Soviet Era and was exacerbated by poverty and civil war. Other causes of water and air pollution include pesticides (particularly DDT and HCH) and fertilizers in surface runoff (exacerbated by landslides from soil degradation), industrial waste, burning of fossil fuels, and tailings from former Soviet mining operations. Most polluted rivers in Tajikistan cross into several other Central Asian nations and are therefore a transnational problem; the Navruz experiment in 2000, which involved several Central Asian governments, discovered high levels of metals and radionuclides in the Aral Sea river basin. Otherwise, regional approaches to pollution have been limited. After the dissolution of the USSR, the region-wide network of data collection posts was fragmented, which, in combination with the destruction of hydroposts during the civil war, has restrained Tajikistan's access to information on pollution in its rivers and its subsequent response. Consequently, Tajikistan's regional relationships have become tense. In 2005 the Uzbek government blamed Tajikistan's industrial pollution for problems in its ecosystems, public health, and agriculture. Uzbekistan has since insisted on operating under a 1994 agreement that required the neighbors to manage transnational environmental problems together, however Tajikistan maintains that its industry has had no impact on the environment and that the operation of its industrial sector is an exercise of sovereignty. = Industrial = Aluminum is Tajikistan's top export and its production is piloted by TALCO, the state aluminum company and operator of the largest aluminum plant in Central Asia in Tursunzoda. Heavy metals such as antimony, arsenic, copper, and mercury are found in rivers near aluminum plants as well as greenhouse gases and mercury in the air. All heavy metals in water are known to cause health problems when consumed, particularly arsenic, which causes liver damage, dermal lesions, and anemia, as well as mercury, which also pollutes soil and the crops that grow in it. No longer a part of a Soviet-wide supply chain, pressure for TALCO to match Soviet-Era production levels has exacerbated the environmental effects of aluminum manufacturing. The Tajik government has historically denied any ecological or health impacts related to TALCO and made plans in 2017 to partner with China in the construction of a new plant in Tursunzoda. = Uranium = From 1945 to 1965, the development of the USSR Nuclear Program resulted in the opening of the Andrasman, Chkalovsk, Digmai, and Taboshar uranium mines. Comparatively minimal cleanup efforts by Soviet and Tajik governments since the abandonment of the mines, in conjunction with Tajikstan's steep mountain topography, have caused uranium tailings to be carried by landslides into soil, pastures and public water sources. Studies in Taboshar and Digmai pit lakes and surrounding areas showed Uranium concentrations to be significantly higher than international recommendations in drinking water and local fish used for consumption. In 2008, the Tajik government claimed to have 14% of the world's untapped Uranium reserves within its borders and drew interest from China, Iran, and Russia to partner with in opening new mines.  Land Degradation  = Soil Erosion = The combination of land inequality, water scarcity, deforestation, and overgrazing leads to an estimated 70% of irrigated cropland being affected by soil erosion. Because the majority of rural populations are near landless, stripping steep slopes of water in mountainous areas is common practice, causing landslides and soil degradation. The effects of soil erosion include agricultural inefficiency, ecological destruction, and lower water quality from nitrification and increased pesticide use. During the Soviet Era, agriculture was state owned and livestock was raised communally, permitting herds to migrate to remote pastures during seasons of extreme heat and cold; entire villages would often be emptied during summers and winters to migrate with livestock. Since the USSR's collapse, livestock numbers have dropped significantly, reducing pressure on grazing lands. However, under the Tajik government, territorial governments are responsible for the allocation of agricultural land, which has resulted in the private ownership of herds and pastures. Because it is less economically viable for an individual to move its herds to remote pastures and because pastures are often privately owned, livestock mobility is limited. Consequently, overgrazing has resulted in pastures without topsoil, vegetation, and ecological diversity. = Deforestation = 2% of Tajikistan's land is occupied by forest, a 23% decrease over the past century, two-thirds of which occurred since Tajik independence. The combination of increased population and poverty in rural areas is the main cause, which results in desertification, reduced watershed protection, and landslides. The rural population in Tajikistan has doubled since 1979, causing competition for arable land and farmers spreading to forested areas. Additionally, high energy prices caused by lacking infrastructure have forced rural populations to turn to illegal logging practices for fuel during the winter.  Energy  Due to high prices and dependence on imports from its Central Asian neighbors, Tajikistan faces significant energy shortages. During the Soviet Era, energy was shared regionally, however, since the dissolution of the USSR and fragmentation of its Central Asian territory, regional energy agreements did not continue, leaving Tajikistan with limited domestic energy resources. The destruction of infrastructure during the civil war and refusal of World Bank funds has also contributed. In 2010, 2% of Tajik households had access to central pipeline heating and 15% to pipeline gas. TALCO, Tajikistan's main aluminum producer, consumes 40% of output from Barqi Tojik, Tajikistan's national power company. Tajikistan has largely turned to hydropower to meet its energy demands. In 2010, hydropower accounted for 16% of Tajikistan's electric output. This shift included plans to complete the Roghun and Sangtuda dams on the Vahksh river from the Soviet Era, in addition to expanding the Nurek hydroelectric plant and constructing several smaller dams. In addition to contributing to the shrinking of the Aral Sea and complicating Tajikistan's relationship with its neighbors, these plans have created concerns for siltation, lowering the water table, and changes to the river's ecosystem; accumulation of silt has already reduced the Nurek reservoir's capacity by 17%, and the Tajik government denies the prevalence of other ecological concerns, particularly those voiced by neighboring countries.

Life He was the younger son of Richard Molyneux, 1st Viscount Molyneux and Mary Caryll, daughter of Sir Thomas Caryll of Bentone in Sussex. He inherited the title from his elder brother, Richard Molyneux, 2nd Viscount Molyneux, in 1654. He married Mary Barlow, daughter of Sir Alexander Barlow of Barlow (elder brother of the Catholic martyr Ambrose Barlow) and his wife Dorothy Gresley, by whom he had one surviving son, William, and five daughters, Mary, Frances, Margaret, Elizabeth and Anne. Molyneux joined the Royalist army at the outbreak of the English Civil War, and served with his brother in the Lancashire Regiment, which was mostly Catholic, through almost all the fighting from Manchester (1642) to Worcester (1651). After the death of his brother in 1654, he succeeded to the viscounty and the constableship of Liverpool Castle. As a well-known Catholic Cavalier, he experienced harsh treatment from the victors; and the family estates suffered. It was not until the reign of James II that Molyneux's fortunes improved. He was then appointed Custos Rotulorum of Lancashire (1685–89), Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire (1687–1688) and Admiral of the Narrow Seas, and was one of the few who fought with any success on James's side against the Prince of Orange, seizing and holding Chester, until all further resistance was in vain. After using the castle to store arms, he was arrested on a fabricated charge of treason for a suspected Jacobite rebellion called \\"The Lancashire plot\\". Along with other Catholics, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London, but was acquitted in 1694. He did not however recover the hereditary constableship, and the castle was leased to the burgesses, who in 1704 were authorised by the Crown to destroy it. After Viscount Molyneux's death at Croxteth in 1700 his title passed to his only surviving son, William Molyneux, 4th Viscount Molyneux.

With his original name of Heung- an, he was the eldest son of Munjamyeong. He was named Crown Prince in the seventh year of Munjamyeong's reign (498), and assumed the throne when his father died in 519. He was supposedly assassinated in 531 without heir. Under Anjang, Goguryeo continued to maintain close relations with the Chinese dynasties, notably Wei and Liang with constant 'tribute missions', to counterbalance the volatile relationship with the southerly Korean kingdoms of Baekje and Silla. He attacked Baekje in 523 and 529, slaying more than 2,000 Baekje soldiers. Historical records during the reign of Anjang are rarely found throughout East Asia with some erroneous marks on his death: the Book of Liang completed in 635 says Anjang died in 526 but it was about five or six years later;《梁書》(Book of Liang) V. 54 Annal of Goguryeo: “(普通)七年 安卒 子延立 遣使貢獻 詔以延襲爵”이라고 기록되어 있다. The Japanese chronicle Nihon Shoki quoting Baekje Bongi says Anjang was killed amid bloody chaos,《日本書紀》 卷第十七 男大迹天皇 繼體天皇: (廿五年) 冬十二月丙申朔庚子 葬于藍野陵; 或本云 天皇 廿八年歲次甲寅崩 而此云 廿五年歲次辛亥崩者 取百濟本記爲文 其文云 太歲辛亥三月 軍進至于安羅 營乞乇城 是月 高麗弑其王安 又聞 日本天皇及太子皇子 俱崩薨 由此而言 辛亥之歲 當廿五年矣 後勘校者 知之也 which implies the final years of his reign were not fairly stabilized. Since series of chaos also sparked at the end of his brother, Anwon’s reign, it is speculated the succession issue had already been entrenched as extreme affair of Goguryeo court among the aristocracy. When Anjang died without heir in 531, he was succeeded by his younger brother, Anwon. The Love story of Go Heung-an and Lady Han Among the numerous historical Korean stories, there is the Love story of a Baekje woman and the 22nd Great King of Goguryeo. It shows many parallels to the Western culture's Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and also the story of Prince Hodong and Princess Nangnang, who also had a forbidden love.

It lies to the east of the urban area, in the historic county of Monmouthshire and the preserved county of Gwent. The population rose to 402 by the 2011 census. https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000820  Location  Llanvaches is located roughly midway between the market town of Chepstow and the city of Newport. The village lies just north of the A48 road and below Wentwood, with both Newport centre and Chepstow about distant.  History  The village is named after Saint Maches (Latin: Machuta), a daughter of Saint Gwynllyw or Woolos and sister of Saint Cadoc, who according to tradition lived a humble life as a shepherdess in the 5th century but was killed by robbers stealing her finest ram. Saint Tathan, Abbot of nearby Caerwent, to whom the murderers confessed their crime, built a church on the spot where she was killed,Hando, F.J., (1958) \\"Out and About in Monmouthshire\\", R. H. Johns, Newport. which became known as Merthyr Maches and later Llanfaches (the letter m mutating to -f- in Welsh). The parish church largely dates from the 14th century and is dedicated to Saint Dubricius (Welsh Dyfrig), with Bishops Transcripts dating back to 1725. =The First Independent Church in Wales= The first Independent Church in Wales was founded at Llanvaches in 1638 by William Wroth (1576–1642), Rector from 1617. In 1633, King Charles I, advised by the Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, reissued the \\"Declaration of Sports\\". This listed the sports that were permitted on Sundays and other holy days, and was published to counteract the growing Puritan calls for strict abstinence on the Sabbath day. Wroth defied Charles' instruction to read the Declaration to his congregation, and in 1634 the Bishop of Llandaff reported him to the Court of High Commission, seeking to remove him from his position in the Church. In 1638 Wroth, along with fellow dissenter Walter Craddock, resigned, but continued to preach and gather followers. His preaching became so popular that people travelled from Somerset, Gloucester, Hereford, Radnor and Glamorgan to Llanvaches to hear him, and it became necessary for him to preach in the churchyard because the church was too small to accommodate all those who attended. By 1639, although he had not formally left the Church of England, Wroth is likely to have been ejected from his living. He set up his Congregationalist chapel, \\"according to the New England pattern\\", completed in 1639, with the help of the leading Dissenter, Henry Jessey. The historic meeting at Llanvaches in November 1639 marked the real beginning of Non- conformity in Wales.David Williams, A Short History of Modern Wales (John Murray, 1961). Wroth died shortly before the outbreak of the first English Civil War, and was buried beneath the church porch at Llanvaches.Caerwent Historic Trust His will, at one time on display in the church vestry, concluded: :\\"I leave my body to be buried where ye Lord shall please to call for mee praying him to bring my hoarie-head into the grave in his peace which passeth all understanding\\" The original church stood in the neighbouring hamlet of Carrow Hill and was rebuilt in Llanvaches in 1802, when a suitable plot of land was found.\\"Tabernacle, Llanvaches: Setting the record straight ...\\" at urc-wales.org.uk In 1854 the great linguist and traveller George Borrow passed the chapel on his walk from Newport to Chepstow, a journey later included in his 1862 Wild Wales.The Oldest Nonconformist Chapel in Wales The current Tabernacle URC Chapel was built in the 1920s. =Llanvaches Roman coin hoard= Hoard of Roman denarii found at Llanvaches in 2006 In 2006 a hoard of 599 silver denarii, hidden in a locally made cooking pot, was found at Llanvaches by a metal detectorist. The coins, which are dated to about AD 160, are now held at the National Roman Legion Museum in Caerleon. Amenities Although Llanvaches is set in a quiet, rural area the need for more houses and the boom in housing development means that the village has a rising population.  Governance  The area is governed by the Newport City Council and the Llanvaches community council.

Racialization or ethnicization often arises out of the interaction of a group with a group that it dominates and ascribes a racial identity to for the purpose of continued domination; over time, the racialized and ethnicized group often gradually identifies with and even embraces this identity and thus becomes a self-ascribed race or ethnicity. These processes have been common throughout the history of imperialism, nationalism, and racial and ethnic hierarchies.  History  Eugène Delacroix, Women of Algiers in their Apartment, 1834, Oil on canvas, 180 × 229cm Louvre Racial categories have historically been used as a way to enable an oppressive figure or group to discriminate against other groups or individuals which were seen as different from that of the oppressor. In nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe, artwork was a common form of racialization which targeted countries in the Middle East and Asia. The artwork, predominantly paintings, were portrayed in order to instill prejudice in the Western populations through sexualizing and manipulating images. One of the most prominent examples of Orientalist work in art is a piece by Eugène Delacroix titled Women of Algiers in their Apartment. Dating back to 1834, it portrays three women resting in a harem in exotic clothing while an African woman is dressed in plain clothing, depicting her role as a servant. Fine textiles, hookahs, and other paraphernalia adorn the room, which represents a European fantasy of an exotic scene. Attempts to portray these cultures as strange, foreign and exotic through Orientalism led to intolerance towards the Arab and Asian communities in Europe and the United States. Others argue that Delacroix, who travelled in North Africa sketching extensively, was depicting a realistic scene of the era based on his first-hand knowledge and experience. In such an interpretation the clothing, for example, is consistent with the times, as Arab North Africans dressed differently from Europeans, and kept black slaves who would not have been treated as equals. Many North African and Middle Eastern countries, such as Tunisia, Algeria, and Syria, were colonized by European nations. These countries were not fully independent until the mid- twentieth century, a time in which globalization began to rise both economically and politically. With the rise of globalization came an expanding cultural influence and an increase in immigration to Western nations. New cultures, ethnic groups, and ideals have contributed to the process of racialization which is familiar in modern society. Racialization is a long process, and members of each group are categorized based on their perceived differences relative to those who are considered elite within a society. Another major contributor to the process of racialization is the media. News outlets, films, television shows, and other forms of public communication portray racial groups to often reflect stereotypes which contribute to the public’s opinion of certain cultural groups. These opinions and stereotypes may become institutionalized and racial groups must then encounter the institutionalized racism that is a result. Dominant groups in a society tend to racialize others because new cultural and racial groups are seen as threatening to their society. These threats instill fear into the dominant members of the society due to the possibility of downward mobility or perceived loss of national security. While threats can be imagined or real, they are most prominent when there is some other issue in the nation, such as a poorly performing economy. The effects of racialization are often more harmful to racial and ethnic groups than the actual racialization itself, a few examples being systemic and structural racism. Further significant research in this area is aiding politicians and policy makers in creating a more equal society that embraces and supports different racial and ethnic groups.  Racialized incorporation  The process of racialization can affect newly arriving immigrants as well as their second-generation children in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation bridges the idea of assimilation with critical race studies in general and the concept of racialization in particular. While immigrants may possess specific ethnic and cultural identities associated with their countries of origin, once they arrive in the U.S., they are incorporated into a society that is largely organized along the lines of race. The racial hierarchy in the United States is pervasive in many aspects of life including housing, education, and employment. The racialized incorporation perspective argues that regardless of the ethnic and cultural differences across immigrant groups, racial identification is the ultimate and primary principle of social organization in the United States. So an immigrant from Sweden and his/her U.S. born second- generation children are likely to be incorporated into the White mainstream, while an immigrant from Ghana and his/her U.S. born second-generation children are likely to be incorporated into the Black community. Because the lived experiences of Whites and Blacks in U.S. society diverge in most areas of social life, the racialized category that immigrants and their children are incorporated into will largely determine their experiences and opportunities in the United States. The concept of racialized incorporation is relatively new and was recently applied in a study of self-employment in the United States. Racialization of religion An ongoing scholarly debate covers the racialization of religious communities. Adherents to Judaism and Islam can be racialized when they are portrayed as possessing certain physical characteristics, despite many individual adherents to those religions not visibly sharing in those characteristics. This racialization extends to the descendants of the adherents, even though those descendants may often convert away from active observance of the religion of their forebears but also retain the lingering cultural aspects of the religion for familial and community purposes. The most immediate effect of the racialization of religion is said to be the internalization of such racialization by the descendants of adherents, whereby the descendants of adherents accept and internalize their religiously-influenced familial culture as an ethnoracial distinction and identity. One of the applications of this racialization is nationalism, whereby the created race seeks to assert cultural and national aspirations which are compatible and accommodating to other groups. Another one of the applications of this racialization is racism and discrimination, whereby those who are racialized are barred from participation in any public or private function of society due to the negative \\"attributes\\" of the race assigned to them. Racialization of labor The racialization of labor is said to involve the segregation and appointment of workers based on perceived ethnic differences.Marta Maria Maldonado, It is their nature to do menial labour': the racialization of 'Latino/a workers' by agricultural employers\\", Ethnic and Racial Studies, vol. 32 no. 6 (July 2009), 1026. This racialization of labor is said to produce a hierarchical arrangement which limits employee agency and mobility based on their race. The process of racialization is reinforced through presupposed, stereotypical qualities which are imposed upon the racialized person by the racializer.Marta Maria Maldonado, \\"Racial Triangulation of Latino/a Workers by Agricultural Employers\\", Human Organization, Vol. 65 No. 4, Winter 2006, 360. Racialization is then normalized by the promotion of \\"colorblindness\\" through the use of \\"soft\\" language which avoids highlighting ethnic differences. The racialization of labor specially limits upward mobility of a person based on race. Dominant racialized labor groups, mainly White/European workers, are generally presented more privileges than subordinate labor groups, mainly Black or Hispanic workers. The subordinate labor groups face the denial of basic citizenship rights, more exploitation, and inferior working conditions. Furthermore, they are less likely to move up in rank within a company or advance to a higher job position. Members of the dominant race (e.g., whites) benefit from the privileges of whiteness, whether these are material or psychological, and are maintained and reproduced within social systems As a result, immigrant workers, especially Latino and Black workers, experience poor working conditions in day labor work. Day laborers experience \\"race\\" and this has impacted their integration into the labor market. Furthermore, research by Edna Bonacich, Sabrina Alimahomed Jake B. Wilson, 2008 regarding the effects of race and criminal background on employment indicates that Black men need to work more than twice as hard as white men to secure the same job. Being Black in America today is about the same as having a felony conviction in terms of one’s chances of finding a job. Specifically, “the combination of minority status and criminal background appears to intensify employers’ negative reactions, leaving few employment prospects for black ex-offenders (200 applications resulted in only 10 callbacks)”. Additionally, According to Chetty, Hendren, Kline, and Saez, the effect of race segregation impacts the labor market, saying “upward income mobility is significantly lower in areas with larger African American Populations”. Race segregation may lead to divergent economic outcomes due to the fact that areas with larger black population tend to be more segregated by income and race and have adverse effects. Lastly, the decline of labor unions has negatively affected racialization of labor. Those who would have benefited from union membership no longer will as labor unions continue to diminish. In Jake Rosenfeld’s article, Little Labor: How Union Decline Is Changing the American Landscape, he describes people who can no longer benefit from labor unions: “an immigrant employee who once would have been organized, a female African-American worker no longer able to rely on a union wage to reduce pay gaps with her white counterpart, or a less-educated worker lacking the training, resources, and knowledge to participate in politics”.  Racialization in education  Racialization in an educational setting is apparent based on the teacher and the background they come from. The teacher’s race along with their views that came along through socialization growing up can affect the way the students portray themselves in a classroom setting. It also has to do with the number of people who come from the same background because the majority of a population will dictate which group is being racialized. An example of students being racialized by their teachers and institutions can be seen through the way high schools teach in America today. Schools tend to teach classes that focus on a more Anglo-Saxon point of view without incorporating any diverse classes that would accommodate for the population of students that come from diverse backgrounds like Latinos, African, and Native Americans. For example, Desert View High School in Arizona has a great population of Native American students who wish to learn more about their cultural background and where they came from. However, author Timothy J. San Pedro who wrote “Truth, in the End, Is Different From What We Have Been Taught: Re-Centering Indigenous Knowledges in Public Schooling Spaces” found that the school mainly focuses on the “Americanized” perspective of history that does not tell the whole story on what came to be in the Native American population. For example, San Pedro describes how the Desert View High School has posters of history classes that glorify “explorers” that were really conquerors of people who initially settled in areas that were “discovered” (San Pedro 2016). That idea of limiting the Native American population from learning about themselves forces them to assimilate to the culture where they are being racialized in an educational setting. They are forced to conform and be put under a racial category among their American teachers and learn things that do not pertain to their culture or social identity.  Racialization and gender  Through the process of racialization, social groups are distinguished and subjected to different treatment on the basis of supposedly biological, phenotypic, cultural, and gender characteristics. Racialization can affect anyone in any race. Therefore, racialization and gender can often intersect (Elabor- Idemudia. 1999). Just as racism and gender intersect or discrimination and gender intersect it is easy for racialization to overlap with gender. During racialization, certain racial categories are created and distinctive and stereotypical characteristics are attributed to that specific category. Within these categories, there can also be subcategories of racialization such as Euro American men or African American women. Often immigrants who migrate to the U.S are affected by racialization if they are not white and fit more into a minority group. For example, African American women may often be stereotyped as uneducated, loud, or improper. Through Racialization if a woman of African descent immigrated to the U.S people will attribute those same stereotypes to her because through a racial lens she fits the African American woman category. Therefore, those same stereotypes will be applied to her as well. Racialization combined with gender can also be seen through the actions of the person that is racializing the other. Racialization and incarceration Coming to fruition in the 1980s, the United States began to enact extensive legal reforms that worked to create a more punitive society. These reforms include mandatory minimum sentences, trying juveniles as adults, three strikes and you’re out laws, truth in sentencing practices, and many other policies and practices which served to increase reliance on imprisonment in response to crime. As a result, U.S. society has been pegged with a “mass incarceration” structure. A recent report has concluded that nearly 1 in 100 U.S. adults are incarcerated and nearly 7.3 million Americans are either in prison or under parole. Although these reforms were intended to apply to all citizens regardless of race, this has not proven to be the reality. Statistically, these punitive reforms have disproportionately impacted African Americans. Specifically, those who are uneducated and/or live in low-income areas. Some have renamed the emergence of the “mass incarceration” society as rather the emergence of “racialized mass incarceration.” The numbers are much more alarming for African Americans behind bars; nearly 1 in 15 African Americans are incarcerated and more narrowly 1 in 9 African American men are incarcerated. These numbers point to an obvious discrimination towards blacks in the U.S. criminal justice system. One clear reason for these disproportionate imprisonment rate can be tied to poverty and social structures. In particular, a pronounced weak attachment to labor among many working-age adults in black communities has fostered a common experience of poverty and economic hardship. Ultimately this has served to create social spaces where bonds of family and community begin to fray and fall apart. These types of environments have created higher levels of juvenile crime, drug use, and even violent and gang-oriented crimes. Although white Americans too have a history of living in poverty, the average national rate of family disruption and poverty among blacks is two to four times higher than among whites. Furthermore, another reason for the United States racialized prison system can be seen with the war on drugs. Despite similar rates of drug use among blacks and whites, blacks make up 50% of those incarcerated for drug use compared to only 26% of whites. While the two examples above point to definite explanations for the United States racialized prison system, ultimately the most salient explanation for disproportionate imprisonment rates is public opinion and prejudice. Social stereotypes and stigmas have created assumptions about African Americans that make them more susceptible to arrest and imprisonment. These latter factors are often influenced by society’s outlook on the prison system. Most educated middle- or upper-class individuals are for things such as the death penalty, minimum sentences, and trying juveniles as adults, which combined with social stigmas make blacks unfairly disadvantaged in the realm of criminal justice. For example, in recent times, these effects can be seen in an increase in police brutality towards minorities. Statistically, it is 2.5 times more likely for blacks to be killed than whites.

They are a vital arm of Egypt's National Security apparatus. History In 1969, a decision was made to create the Central Security Forces from well trained and equipped police forces on large scale covering the whole country under the command of the Ministry of Interior (Egypt) to conduct special police operations in response to operational needs. The creation of those forces followed the paramilitary model, and became close – in formation, training, equipment and operating procedures – to the Italian Carabinieri, Indian CRPF and the Russian OMON. The initial batch of recruits were drawn from the Police and had to undergo military training under the Army. Later on, in 1970, a separate training institute was set up for the CSF and the force started conscripting its recruits, just like regular Army conscripts. The CSF was set up to deal with the growing unrest and public disorder following the Egyptian defeat in the Six day war. The CSF was deployed by the Sadat government to tackle large protests by Leftist and hardline Nasserist groups in January 1972 in Cairo, the protests were called to protest against Sadat's anti-Soviet and anti- Palestinian foreign policy, lack of action against Israel and right-wing economic measures such as cutting some subsidies and increasing some prices of welfare services like public transport. CSF units had to use force to disperse the rioting crowds in Tahrir Square which led to the shooting death of three protestors. Following the 1973 Arab Israeli War between Egypt and Israel – then settling the 1973 & 1974 Ceasefire agreements; the 1979 Egyptian–Israeli Peace Treaty was signed and the subsequent Israeli withdrawal from the rest of Sinai Peninsula occurred. The Treaty stipulated the Egyptian government refrain from deploying regular Egyptian Armed Forces units in the eastern part of Sinai that directly border Israel (Zone “C”). The Egyptian government then tasked the Central Security Forces to take up the task. The CSF force deployed is effectively a motorised light infantry force without the heavy weapons and equipment. Tanks in Cairo during the 1986 riots In 1986, hundreds of third category, low ranking, CSF personnel (soldiers) staged a four-day mutiny, in the Egyptian Conscription Riot. The riot was a reaction to the spread of false rumours among its conscripts that their (three year) conscription time will be extended by a year. The insurrection was suppressed by the Egyptian Army. They rampaged through the suburb of Giza burning some hotels and shops in tourist areas. They also burned dozens of cars and buses. Over 20,000 conscripts were dismissed from service with no benefits, and the agitators received correctional punishment after being tried before State Security Court for arson, violent riots, and insubordination according to penal code. Some reports related that mutiny to a conspiracy against the Minister of Interior in charge by then (Gen. Ahmed Roshdy) due to his policies. After the suppression the government promised to overhaul the force by raising its entry standards, increasing payment and bettering living conditions in their camps. The Egyptian government subsequently came to rely on the CSF to quell any source of instability within the country and to uphold the emergency laws imposed on Egypt since the 1981 assassination of the President of Egypt, Anwar Sadat. The CSF was especially deployed to tackle armed Islamist insurgents. From the 1990s onwards, CSF has become operationally coordinated with the State Security, meaning CSF units can be ordered to deploy by State Security officers, and has been called the \\"battering ram of State Security\\". Organization & Equipment Paramilitary riot police of the Central Security Forces deployed during the 25 January 2011 protests. Rows of Egyptian Central Security Forces on the Day of Anger during the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Police in riot gear on 28th of January - \\"The Day of Rage\\" - during the Egyptian Revolution of 2011. The CSF is headed by a Director General, who is a 3-star Police General of the Interior Ministry, and is organised as follows: * Main Headquarters (MHQ). * Special Operations Command. * (6) Specialized Training Institutes. * (8) AOR Operational Regions – **Cairo, ** Alexandria, ** Giza, ** Central & Western Nile Delta, ** Eastern Nile Delta, ** Suez Canal & Sinai, ** Southern Upper Egypt, and ** Northern Upper Egypt List of Equipment of Central Security Forces ( Egypt ) Deployment and operating procedures Similar to other central paramilitary organizations in other countries, CSF deployment is divided into three parts - Baton, Gas, and Armed. The basic unit formation of the CSF is a company which is commanded by a Police Captain (naqib) or in some cases a Major who is a commissioned officer and a graduate of the Police College. A senior Lieutenant (mulazim awwal) (or Captain when the commander is a Major), is usually second-in-command. A CSF company consists of approximately 150 personnel and is composed of two Baton platoons, a Gas platoon, and an Armed platoon. Each platoon is also commanded by a Captain or a Lieutenant with a Sergeant (raqib) as second-in-command. Approximately 3 to 4 companies make up a CSF Battalion, which is commanded by an officer of full Colonel rank. The Baton platoons are equipped with batons and shields, the gas platoon is responsible for the deployment of Teargas, and the armed platoon usually carries Assault Rifles - usually the AK 47 variants, and is organized like a Light Infantry Rifles platoon. However, under emergency laws and martial law, the non-armed CSF units can be converted into armed units, and they are additionally equipped with LMGs, recoilless rifles and sniper rifles for anti-insurgency operations. Also, the three-part deployment of CSF is not applicable in regions like the North Sinai, where all units are armed at all times. Recruitment The Central Security Forces personnel consists of three categories; * Commissioned Officers (graduated from the Police College of 4 Academic years), who enter the service with the rank of Lieutenant. They are recruited via national-level exams for Police officers, they receive their commission from the President; * Sub-officers (graduated from Police School of 2 Academic years), they are equivalent to the Non-commissioned officers of the Army; and * Conscripts (of 6 months training) recruited entirely from the low educated recruits, as the more educated and college graduates usually end up in the different branches of the regular military service. Conscripts can later be promoted to the ranks of sub- officers if they continue in the service beyond their compulsory terms and if they get a higher education and sit for the mandatory exams for entering sub- officer ranks. There is high competition among conscripts to extend their service and to become regularized troops, this is because of the high rate of unemployment in Egypt. A conscript enters the force as a \\"Private Recruit\\" and is promoted to \\"Private First Class\\" after 2 years of service. At the time of demobilization/release from compulsory 3 years' service, many who have passed their 10th grade in school, are at the rank of Areef or Corporal and can command a section of 10-12 conscripts and 1 riot vehicle. Less educated or illiterate conscripts, however, have to retire at the rank of Private First Class. Those among the Corporals who wish can sit for exams to extend their service and receive the rank of Deputy Sergeant or Junior Sergeant. Most of the conscripts/NCOs are forced to retire at 52 years of age with the rank of Sergeant with no chance of advancement if they do not have a college degree. Less than 2% of conscripts advance into the commissioned officer ranks. Ranks Officers - *Director General (a Lieutenant General ranking officer) *Major General (Liwa) *Brigadier General (Amid) *Colonel (Aqid) *Lieutenant Colonel (Moqaddem) *Major (Raed) *Captain (Naqib) *First Lieutenant (Mulazim Awal) *Lieutenant (Mulazim) Sub-officers- *Sergeant First Class (Raqib awwal) - this rank is held only by the two or three senior-most NCOs in a Battalion. *Sergeant (Raqib) *Deputy Sergeant/Junior Sergeant (Raqib Musaaed) - first NCO rank *Corporal (Areef) - after 3 years of compulsory service, it is usually held by Section/Troop leaders.

Ayodhya was its capital, presently in Ayodhya district, Uttar Pradesh. Rama's sons Lava and Kusha inherited parts of this kingdom. Lava ruled from the city called Ayodhya and Kusa from the city called Kushavati. A colony of Kosala kings existed in Madhya Pradesh. It was called Dakshina Kosala. Rama's mother Kausalya was from this kingdom. King Rama extended his influence up to the island-kingdom of Lanka situated in the southern ocean. He had friendly relations with the southern kingdom of forest dwellers (Vanaras) called Kishkindha. Rama's brother Bharata, colonized the Gandhara kingdom and founded the city of Takshasila there. Gandhara lies close to Kekeya Kingdom, the native kingdom of Bharata's mother, Kaikeyi. Rama's second brother Lakshmana founded the city of Lakshmanapura near river Ganges which is now known as Lucknow. He colonized the Vanga kingdom and founded the city of Chandrakanta there. Rama's youngest brother Satrughna destroyed the forest called Madhu and founded the city of Mathura which later became the capital of the Surasena Kingdom. Nishadha king Nala's friend Rituparna was a ruler of Kosala. Brihadbala another ruler of Kosala during Dwapara Yuga, took part in Mahabharata war and was killed by Abhimanyu, the son of Arjuna. An 1880 reference described Uttara Kosala was one of the five main divisions of the kingdom of Rama in prehistoric Awadh; the region was described as corresponding to the modern trans-Ghaghra districts including Bahraich, Gonda, Basti and Gorakhpur.  Kosala Kingdom through the ages  Kosala Kingdom Mahajanapada was one of sixteen most powerful and vast kingdoms and republics of the era, located mainly across the fertile Indo-Gangetic plains, there were a number of smaller kingdoms stretching the length and breadth of Ancient India. Places Related to Rama and Kosala = Era of Treta Yuga = The Indian epic Ramayana is the window to this era.  Kosala Proper and Dakshina (Southern) Kosala  During the period of the forefathers of Raghava Rama, there was only one Kosala kingdom. It had its capital at Ayodhya, identified as the Ayodhya town near Faizabad in Uttar Pradesh state of India. During the reign of Dasharatha, the father of Rama, Dakshina Kosala came into prominence. It was situated in the Madhya Pradesh state of India. Dasharatha married his eldest wife Kausalya from this kingdom.  Kosala Proper splits into two  Raghava Rama's son's Lava and Kusa, inherited each half of the Kosala kingdom, with Ayodhya as its capital. Thus, this Kosala split into two parts; one ruled by Lava, with capital at Sravasti, to the north of Ayodhya and the other by Kusa at Kusavati, believed to be towards the east of Ayodhya. = Era of Dwapara Yuga = The Indian epic Mahabharata is the window to this era. During the time of Kurukshetra War, and the reign of Pandavas and Kauravas, we find mention of numerous kingdoms with the name, Kosala (as per the references in Mahabharata).  Kingdoms that sprang from Kosala Proper  Raghava Rama's Kosala (Kosala Proper) was already split into two, owing to his two sons attaining kingship after his reign. During the era of Kurukshetra War it was split into five kingdoms. =Eastern Kosala= This was, probably the kingdom ruled by Kusa, with Kusavati as its capital. (see MBh 2.14, Mbh 2.21, referred below). They were described as fleeing to the southern country of Kuntis due to Magadha king Jarasandha. The route was taken by Bhima, Arjuna and Krishna from Kuru Kingdom to Magadha Kingdom was through this Eastern Kosala. =Northern Kosala= This was, probably the kingdom ruled by Lava with Sravasti as its capital. (see MBh 2.29 referred below). This kingdom was defeated by the Pandava general Bhima, in his military campaign to the east. =Kosala Kingdom of Vrihadvala to the south of Ayodhya = Gold carving depiction of the legendary Ayodhya at the Ajmer Jain temple. Vriahadvala was a Kosala king mentioned as a general under Duryodhana, in the Kurukshetra War. (MBh. 5.277, 5.198). This kingdom was defeated by the Pandava general Bhima, in his military campaign to the east. (MBh 2.29). It seems that this Kosala had its power extended to the neighbouring kingdom of Kasi to the south of it, because Vrihadvala sometimes commanded the troops from Kasi also in Kurukshetra War. This probably was the reason to consider Kasi-Kosala as a single kingdom. For a period of time in the past, Kasi would have been a vassal state of Kosala kingdom. The grandmothers of Kauravas and Pandavas were called sometimes as princesses of Kasi and some times as princesses of Kosala, attesting to this fact. =Kosala with Ayodhya as its capital or Central Kosala= This was the original Kosala ruled by king Raghava Rama. This was ruled by Dirghayaghna, during this era. This kingdom was defeated by the Pandava general Bhima, in his military campaign to the east. (MBh 2.29).  Kingdoms that sprang from the Southern Kosala The native kingdom of Raghava Rama's mother Kausalya, considered as Dakshina Kosala Kingdom split at least into two during the era of Kurukshetra War. This became evident if we follow the passage in Mahabharata, describing the military campaign of the Pandava general Sahadeva, who led his troops to the southern direction. (MBh. 2.30) =Western Kosala in Central India= This kingdom was close to the Vidarbha Kingdom ruled by Bhishmaka, probably to the east of it. Sahadeva defeated this kingdom first and moved to the Eastern Kosala. (MBh. 2.30) =Eastern Kosala in Central India = After defeating the other Kosala kingdom Sahadeva defeated numerous kings in the Eastern Kosala, indicating that there were many kingdoms, and not one, however collectively known as Eastern Kosalas. (MBh. 2.30)  References in Mahabharata  India during the Mahabharata = The Mothers of Dhritarashtra and Pandu = *Mahabharata, Book 1, Chapter 114 The mothers of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, viz Ambika and Ambalika, were described to be Kosala princesses. They were some times described as princesses from Kasi Kingdom, Kasi and Kosala being a single kingdom (often denoted as Kasi-Kosalas) during the time of Mahabharata. Then Satyavati and Bhishma and the Kosala princesses were all gratified with the presents Pandu made out of the acquisitions of his prowess. And Ambalika in particular, upon embracing her son of incomparable prowess, became very glad. = The Self-Choice event of Panchali = *Mahabharata, Book 1, Chapter 188 Kosala king was present in this event = The impact of Magadha king on Kosala = *Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 14 The eighteen tribes of the Bhojas, from fear of (Magadha King) Jarasandha, have all fled towards the west; so also have the Surasenas, the Bhadrakas, the Vodhas, the Salwas, the Patachchavas, the Susthalas, the Mukuttas, and the Kulindas, along with the Kuntis. And the king of the Salwayana tribe with their brethren and followers; and the southern Panchalas and the eastern Kosalas have all fled to the country of the Kuntis. So also the Matsyas and the Sannyastapadas, overcome with fear, leaving their dominions in the north, have fled into the southern country. And so all the Panchalas, alarmed at the power of Jarasandha, have left their own kingdom and fled in all directions. = The trip from Kuru Kingdom to Magadha Kingdom = Route taken by Bhima, Arjuna and Krishna from Kuru Kingdom to Magadha Kingdom to meet Jarasandha as per Mahabharata *Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 21 The following was a route taken by Krishna, Arjuna and Bhima to reach Magadha Kingdom. It passes through the Eastern Kosala Kingdom. Having set out from the country of the Kurus, they passed through Kuru-janapada and arrived at the charming lake of lotuses. Passing over the hills of Kalakuta, they then went on crossing the Gandaki, the Sadanira (Karatoya), and the Sarkaravarta and the other rivers taking their rise in the same mountains. They then crossed the delightful Sarayu and saw the country of Eastern Kosala. Passing over that country they went to Mithila and then crossing the Mala and Charamanvati, the three heroes crossed the Ganges and the Sone and went on towards the east. At last those heroes of unfaded glory arrived at Magadha in the heart of (the country of) Kushamva. Reaching then the hills of Goratha, they saw the city of Magadha. = Bhima's Military Campaign = *Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 29 Bhima then vanquished king Srenimat of the country of Kumara, and then Vrihadvala, the king of Kosala. Then the foremost of the sons of Pandu, by performing feats excelling in fierceness, defeated the virtuous and mighty king Dirghayaghna of Ayodhya. And the exalted one then subjugated the country of Gopalakaksha and the northern Kosalas and also the king of Mallas. = Sahadeva's Military Campaign = *Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 30 Sahadeva, vanquishing the invincible Bhishmaka, then defeated in battle the king of Kosala and the ruler of the territories lying on the banks of the Venwa, as also the Kantarakas and the kings of the eastern Kosalas. = Conversation of Nala and Damayanti = *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 61 These many roads lead to the southern country, passing by (the city of) Avanti and the Rikshavat mountains. This is that mighty mountain called Vindhya; yon, the river Payasvini running seawards, and yonder are the asylums of the ascetics, furnished with various fruit and roots. This road leadeth to the country of the Vidarbhas—and that, to the country of the Kosalas. Beyond these roads to the south is the southern country. = Rituparna, King of Kosala visiting Vidharbha Kingdom = *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 73 The ruler of the Vidarbhas, approaching Rituparna, said, ‘Welcome! What is the occasion of this thy visit?’ And king Bhima asked this without knowing that Rituparna had come to obtain the hand of his daughter. And king Rituparna, saw that there were no other kings or princes. Nor did he hear any talk relating to the Swayamvara, nor saw any concourse of Brahmanas. And at this, the king of Kosala reflected a while and at length said, ‘I have come here to pay my respects to thee.’ And the king Bhima was struck with astonishment, and reflected upon the (probable) cause of Rituparna's coming, having passed over a hundred yojanas. = Sacred Places in Kosala Kingdom = *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 85 Sojourning next to the tirtha called Rishabha in Kosala and fasting there for three nights one earneth the merit of the Vajapeya sacrifice, and of the gift of a thousand kine, and also delivereth his race. Arriving at 'Kosala, a man should bathe in the tirtha named Kala. = Karna's Military Campaign = *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 252 Having conquered the eastern quarter Karna then presented himself before Batsa-bhumi. And having taken Batsa-bhumi, he reduced Kevali, and Mrittikavati, and Mohana and Patrana, and Tripura, and Kosala,--and compelled all these to pay tribute. = Ramayana inside Mahabharata = *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 277 Behold my plight! The loss of thy kingdom, and then the death of our father, and then the abduction of Sita, and finally this disaster that hath overwhelmed me! Alas, I shall not behold thee return with the princess of Videha to Kosala and seated on thy ancestral throne as the ruler of the entire Earth! They only that are fortunate will behold thy face, like unto the moon emerged from the clouds, after thy coronation bath in water sanctified with Kusa grass and fried paddy and black peas!’ And the intelligent Lakshmana uttered those and other lamentations in the same strain. *Mahabharata, Book 3, Chapter 282 That descendant of Raghu, who ruleth at Kosala and whose renown hath spread over the whole world, sayeth unto thee these words suited to the occasion. Accept thou that message and act according to it. = Vrihadvala or Brihadbala, the Ruler of Kosala = *Mahabharata, Book 5, Chapter 277 Bhishma rates the battle skills of every king who were to take part in the Kurukshetra War Endued with great impetus and prowess, king Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, is, in my judgment, equal to one Ratha (a grade of battle-skill). = Kosala King supported Duryodhana in the war = *Mahabharata, Book 5, Chapter 198 King Vrihadvala of Kosala, supported Duryodhana in the Kurukshetra War Then came Kritavarman at the head of his troops, and that mighty car-warrior, viz., the ruler of the Trigartas, and the king Duryodhana surrounded by his brothers, and Sala, and Bhurisravas, and Salya, and Vrihadratha, the ruler of the Kosalas. *Mahabharata, Book 6, Chapter 16 And Suvala's son Shakuni, and Salya, Jayadratha and the two princes of Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, and the Kekeya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas and Srutayudha the ruler of the Kalingas, and king Jayatsena, and Vrihadvala the ruler of the Kosalas, and Kritavarman of Satwata's race,--these ten tigers among men, stood each at the head of an Akshauhini of troops. These and many other kings and princes, mighty car- warriors conversant with policy, obedient to the commands of Duryodhana, all cased in mail, were seen stationed in their respective divisions. *Mahabharata, Book 6, Chapter 45 The mighty bowman Abhimanyu battled with Vrihadvala. Soon, however, in that encounter, O king, the ruler of Kosala cut off the standard and overthrew the charioteer of Subhadra's son. The son of Subhadra then upon the overthrow of his charioteer, was filled with wrath and pierced Vrihadvala = Abhimanyu slays Vrihadvala the king of Kosala = *Mahabharata, Book 7, Chapter 45 The ruler of the Kosala struck Abhimanyu, in the chest with a barbed arrow. Abhimanyu, however, quickly felled on the earth his antagonist's steeds and standard and bow and charioteer. The ruler of the Kosalas, then, thus deprived of his car, took up a sword and wished to sever from Abhimanyu's trunk his beautiful head, decked with ear-rings. Abhimanyu then pierced king Vrihadvala, the ruler of the Kosalas, in the chest, with a strong arrow. The latter then, with riven heart, fell down. Beholding this, ten thousand illustrious kings broke and fled. Those kings, armed with swords and bows, fled away, uttering words inimical (to king Duryodhana's Interest). Having slain Vrihadvala thus, the son of Subhadra careered it battle. = Connection with Saraswati Civilization = *Mahabharata, Book 9, Chapter 38 It was on that sacred region, the northern part of Kosala, that the sacrifice of high-souled Auddalaka was performed. Before Auddalaka began his sacrifice, he had thought of the Sarasvati River. That foremost of rivers came to that region for the sake of those Rishis. Worshipped by all those Munis clad in barks and deer-skins she became known by the name of Manorama, as those Rishis mentally called her. = Arjuna's Post War Military Campaign = *Mahabharata, Book 14, Chapter 82 The sacrificial horse then, equipped with beautiful manes, proceeded at his will along the sea-coast, repairing to the countries of the Bangas, the Pundras, and the Kosalas. In those realms Dhananjaya (Arjuna), with his bow Gandiva, vanquished innumerable Mlechecha armies one after another *Mahabharata, Book 14, Chapter 83 That best of steeds then proceeded to the realms of the Kasis, the Angas, the Kosalas, the Kiratas, and the Tanganas. = Other References in Mahabharata = *Mahabharata, Book 12, Chapter 18 Mention of a Janaka king of Videha, with a wife from Kosala *Mahabharata, Book 12, Chapter 67 There was a king of Kosala possessed of great intelligence, named Vasumanas. *Mahabharata, Book 12, Chapter 81 It hath been heard by us that once on a time the sage Kalakavrikshiya came to Kshemadarsin who had ascended the throne of the kingdom of Kosala. *Mahabharata, Book 13, Chapter 6 Saudasa, the king of Kosala, though dignified by the performance of Ashwamedha and other sacrifices, obtained the status of a man-eating Rakshasa, through the curse of a great Rishi.

Let T be a finitely splitting rooted tree of height ω, n a positive integer, and mathbb{S}^n_T the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if mathbb{S}^n_T=C_1 cup ... cup C_r then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T, mathbb{S}^n_R subset C_i for some i ≤ r. This immediately implies Ramsey's theorem; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices. Define mathbb{S}^n= bigcup_T mathbb{S}^n_T where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is mathbb{S}^n partition regular for each n < ω, but that the homogeneous subtree R guaranteed by the theorem is strongly embedded in T.  Strong embedding  Call T an α-tree if each branch of T has cardinality α. Define Succ(p, P)= { q in P : q geq p }, and IS(p,P) to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is strongly embedded in T if: * S subset T, and the partial order on S is induced from T, * if s in S is nonmaximal in S and t in IS(s,T), then Succ(t,T) cap IS(s,S)=1, * there exists a strictly increasing function from alpha to beta, such that S(n) subset T(f(n)). Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T, * S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order * S must preserve the branching structure of T; i.e., if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S * S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.

It was the second mall built in Georgia, and opened on August 15, 1963. Early years The mall was built in a post- World War II suburb of Atlanta by the parent company of Food Fair and featured nearly 50 stores including a Rich's department store (the fourth in the chain), Woolworths, Dunaway Drug (later Eckerd), Davis House restaurant (later Davis Brothers Cafeteria) and a Colonial supermarket. A six-screen movie theater, which later became King's Cinemas, was also opened on an outlot on the north side of the center. The mall was also originally an open-air center with covered walkways and the stores wrapped around the south and west side of the Rich's store, all facing it. For the first ten years, the mall was enormously successful and the two-story Rich's store was quickly expanded with a one-story north wing that greatly increased the total floor space. The mall was a major blow to downtown Marietta, Georgia to the north. When the mall first opened, nearly all of the major clothing stores in downtown Marietta also had branches at Cobb Center. It began to draw out its tenants, leaving the downtown mostly dead by the 1970s. Enclosing Cobb Center Ten years after the mall opened, Cobb Center struggled after the opening of Cumberland Mall, a mall far superior in size and quantity stores compared to the much smaller open-air mall. Cumberland Mall opened in 1973 and featured all of the major Atlanta anchors including Rich's, Davison's, Sears and JCPenney. Cobb Center just had Rich's. The owners of Cobb Center in reaction to the new mall, fully enclosed the structure and added a new anchor, Grant City on the northwest corner of the mall. =Survival= The changes worked and the mall survived. There were two major factors to the success. The first was that Cumberland was the only nearby competition. Second, the Rich's at Cobb Center remained extremely popular. Rich's was enormously successful in the 1970s and this was one of only two locations that existed on the northwest side of Atlanta at the time. When Grant's closed in 1976, a small low-end chain with a store downtown named Kessler's took over the location. Downturn, renovation, and closure Eventually, the mall was unable to continue to survive. The first blow came when Town Center Mall in Kennesaw, Georgia opened in 1986 in what had been a farming area. The mall also included Rich's. Town Center Mall was also much larger than Cumberland and was more convenient to the northern suburbs. The second blow was that the area around the mall was declining very sharply. The shopping base dwindled and so did the mall traffic. By then, Cobb Center looked very dated and small with its dark wood interior and very 1960s retro exterior. Once again, in 1987, the mall was renovated for its 25th Anniversary. This time, it was redesigned to the popular bright pastel look of the 1980s, skylights were improved and the mall was renamed \\"Four Seasons Mall\\" to attempt to remove the stigma of the mall that had been fading slowly for over a decade. As a short-term boost for the center, Howard's Restaurant, which had been a small bar and grill located across the street, located in the former Davis Brothers bringing business back to the center. Unfortunately, this renovation did not lead to expansion and many parts of the mall remained vacant, including the former Colonial/Big Star grocery store on the southwest corner, which closed at the mall somewhere in that period. In the late 1980s, the mall continued to operate with many vacancies and no customers. What kept the mall alive was the Rich's and Kessler's, both which looked little different from the days they opened. With the upscale shoppers avoiding the center, Rich's was downscaled to a clearance store by the early 1990s and Kessler's closed in 1990 with no replacement. Howard's moved to a new location, and all that remained for tenants was a few stores including Woolworth's, Eckerd Drugs in the former Dunaway Drugs and Friedman's Jewelry. One of the wings to the mall had burned and was closed off as well. The mall was finally demolished in 1995 except for the Rich's, which lingered until it closed in February 2004. Cobb Center redevelopment The former Rich's entrances to the mall were sealed except for the front entrance and a strip mall was attached to both sides of the Rich's store. The back parking lot of the mall was converted into a soccer park and the Rich's continued to operate there until it closed. The center was also renamed back to simply Cobb Center without the British spelling. In December 2008, the Smyrna city council unanimously approved a rezoning which would allow for Imagine International Academy to move its school into the two-story part of the Rich's building, covering of floor space. The classic façade will be destroyed and it will be made to look like a \\"modern school\\", to open in August for the 2009-2010 school year. Imagine International Academy is now open for business as of 2010. As of Thursday December 15, 2016 Publix closed down its doors officially and moved to Jonquil Plaza on Atlanta Road in Downtown Smyrna. The former Publix is becoming a Nam Dae Farmers Market as of Thursday, March 16, 2017.

It is the most successful solar car team in North America, having won the North American Solar Challenge (NASC) eight times (out of a possible twelve). The team has also placed third in the World Solar Challenge (WSC) five times. Six of its former vehicles are on display in museums in the United States, including the Henry Ford Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, and the Boston Museum of Science. Composition and history Founded in 1989 by Bill Kaliardos, an undergraduate student in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, the University of Michigan Solar Car Team is one of the largest and most successful student projects at the University. The inaugural 1990 team, which formed in 1989, was eventually managed by Susan Fancy, with Professor and Dean Gene Smith serving as the team's Faculty Advisor. Gene Smith was also Advisor for many other U-M Solar Car Teams to follow. The teams have built eleven solar cars and competed in 15 major races. Although it draws heavily on undergraduate students from the College of Engineering, students from any academic discipline or year of study are allowed to join the team. Students have also come from the College of LS&A;, the Ross School of Business, and the Stamps School of Art & Design. In 1990, the team's first car, Sunrunner, finished in first place in the inaugural GM Sunrayce USA, and third place overall (first place in Student category) in the 1990 World Solar Challenge in Australia. Core team members of the 1990 team included Susan Fancy, Paula Finnegan, David Noles, Chetan Maini (Maini went on to become the founder of Reva which is one of the major electric car companies in India), David Bell, Jef Pavlat, Andy Swiecki, Chris Gregory, and many more. The second generation team built its car, Maize & Blue, and competed in Sunrayce 93 (the predecessor to the North American Solar Challenge) finishing in first place in the national race, and 11th in the World Solar Challenge. After 1993's races, all projects have run on a 2-year cycle. During those two years, the team is typically anywhere from 50 to 100 students. The vast majority of these students volunteer their time freely, although in the past a small percentage opt to receive credit via the University's Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (or UROP). A race crew of approximately 20 students is selected to race the vehicle in competition. These students' function is similar to that of a pit crew in professional auto racing. As of 2016, UM's solar car project has won the North American championship nine times.

In the early 1960s he met several other like-minded people, including Patrick Hughes, Ian Breakwell and Glen Baxter. Hughes persuaded Earnshaw to hold a retrospective at the Leeds Institute in 1966, which was followed by an exhibition in Exeter, The Enchanted Domain, to which he was invited by John Lyle. He began teaching part-time, first at the Harrogate School of Art, then at Bradford Art School, before leaving engineering altogether in 1972 to take up a fellowship at Leeds Polytechnic. He left teaching in 1985 to concentrate on art. In 1968 Earnshaw collaborated with Thacker on an illustrated novel, Musrum, which was not commercially successful, but has become a cult classic. The book is a fantasy, peppered with aphorisms (\\"Sudden prayers make God jump\\"), and tells the story of the title character's kingdom and of his battle with the nefarious Weedking. It was followed in 1971 by a sequel, Wintersol, about the secret criminal nature of Father Christmas. Both books were praised for their elegant writing, wit and wordplay, and especially for their sheer invention. Later publications included a cartoon in the Times Educational Supplement, a wheeled bird named Wokker, and books of aphorisms, the largest being Flick Knives and Forks in 1982. In the 1980s and 1990s Earnshaw began making art boxes, further exemplifying his loyalty to Surrealism. Earnshaw died in 2001. He was survived by his second wife, Gail, and by two daughters from his first marriage.

Biography Nicolas Lebel was born in Saint-Mihiel (Meuse) near Verdun. Interested by the prospects of a military career he enrolled in the Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1855. In 1857, he joined the 58th Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant. During the Franco- Prussian War of 1870–1871, he was a captain and company commander. In September 1870, he was captured after the Sedan encirclement and became a prisoner-of-war. Released from captivity after the Treaty of Frankfurt, he found a command in Tours, during the years of intense reorganization of the French Army which followed the 1871 defeat. He was appointed major in 1876, and dedicated himself to the improvement of infantry weaponry. His competence was soon recognized and in 1883, the Minister for War, General Thibaudin, entrusted him to direct the army's École Normale de Tir. The E.N.T. was the army's training center dedicated to improve shooting performance and recommend small arms improvements. In March 1884 he was made a member of the Commission des Armes à Répétition or Commission for repeating firearms. This commission was presided at the time by General Baptiste Tramond and included Colonel Basile Gras, Colonel Bonnet, Lt-Colonel Lebel, Castan, de Tristan, Captain Desaleux and last but not least Paul Vieille, the inventor of smokeless powder. It is this commission which formulated and supervised the execution of the fusil mle 1886 infantry rifle prototype. This project was carried out within slightly more than one year, between January 1886 and the date of formal adoption: April 1887. Lt-Colonel Lebel's direct contribution was the full-metal-jacket bullet or balle Lebel which had been formulated and extensively tested at the École Normale de Tir under his direction. He had been inspired by the promising results obtained somewhat earlier by Major Eduard Rubin of the Swiss Army who had invented the first copper-jacketed rifle bullets in 1882. Without the jacketed \\"Balle Lebel\\" (\\"Lebel bullet\\") the new Mle 1886 rifle's performance with Paul Vieille's smokeless powder, which imparted much higher velocities than black powder, would have been impossible to achieve. The new Fusil Mle 1886 was soon and informally designated as Fusil Lebel (Lebel rifle) \\"against the protestations of the Commission, including Colonel Lebel himself\\" as quoted verbatim from Challeat's classic Histoire Technique de l'Artillerie de Terre en France pendant un siècle, published in 1935. The historical record shows that the Lebel rifle was the result of teamwork carried out against time and under great pressure exerted from above by War Minister General Boulanger. The original bullet or \\"Balle M\\" designed under Colonel Lebel's direction was flat nosed in order to pose no risk of accidental ignition in the Lebel's tube magazine. The \\"Balle M\\" bullet has a full metal jacket made of cupro-nickel and a lead core. Its weight is . Its muzzle velocity is . Its maximum range is . It was propelled by of the new smokeless \\"poudre B\\". Its ballistic properties were superior to anything else in existence at the time (1887). Lebel was promoted to the rank of full colonel in 1887 but, because of cardiac problems, he took early retirement in 1890 and died on May 6, 1891 at the age of 53. He was decorated with the rank of Commander of the Order of the Legion of Honor.

It was located in what is now Chhattisgarh and western part of Odisha. At its greatest extent, it may have also included a part of the Vidarbha region in present-day Maharashtra. Its capitals at various times included Bhadravati, Sirpur (ancient Shripura), Tuman (ancient Tummana), and Ratanpur (ancient Ratnapura).  Extent  Dakshina Kosala (\\"South Kosala\\"), sometimes simply called Kosala, is so-called to distinguish it from Uttara Kosala (\\"North Kosala\\") in present-day Uttar Pradesh. Epigraphic evidence suggests that the area bounded by the Raipur, Bilaspur, and Sambalpur districts was definitely a part of the Dakshina Kosala region. The inscriptions found in these districts record grants of villages located in the Kosala country, and the rulers mentioned in these inscriptions are given the titles indicating their lordship over Dakshina Kosala (such as Kosaladhisha, Kosaladhipati, and Kosala- narendra). According to the 7th century Chinese traveler Xuanzang, the extent of the contemporary Kosala kingdom was 6,000 li in circuit, that is, around 81,000 square miles in area. This suggests that in the 7th century, the Dakshina Kosala region encompassed an area much larger than the region bounded by the above-mentioned districts. The Somavamshi inscriptions suggest that other areas of present-day Odisha, bordering Sambalpur, were also part of the Dakshina Kosala. During Xuanzang's period, Kosala appears to have extended from 78th meridian east to the 85th meridian east in the east–west direction. The northern boundary of Kosala was located a little to the south of Amarakantaka, which was a part of the Mekala kingdom. The Puranas, including the Vayu Purana and the Matsya Purana, mention Mekala and Kosala as distinct regions. The ancient epigraphs, such as the Balaghat inscription of the Vakataka king Prithvishena II, also distinguish between these two regions. However, at one place, the Vayu Purana mentions the Mekalas as one of the Pancha Kosalas (\\"Five Kosalas\\"), which suggests that at some point, the chiefs of the Mekala region were subordinate to the rulers of the Kosala proper. In the south, the Dakshina Kosala region, at its greatest extent, appears to have included a part of present-day Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. The legend of king Nala states that he reached the capital of Kosala: the description of the route of his march suggests that this capital was present-day Bhadravati. In the 19th century Alexander Cunningham, the founder of Archaeological Survey of India, mentioned Dakshina Kosala as a synonym of Mahakoshal (or Maha-Kosala), without mentioning any source for this claim. However, none of the ancient texts or inscriptions support the claim that Dakshina Kosala and Mahakoshal refer to the same geographical unit. The ancient Sanskrit texts frequently mention Dakshina Kosala, but do not mention Mahakoshal as the name of a region. In ancient times Dakshina Kosala (South Kosala) comprised modern Chhattisgarh and the adjoining territory in the State of Orissa up to the boundary of the Katak District. In the Puranas this country is mentioned with Traipura (the tract around Tripuri near Jabalpur), Kalinga (part of the state of Orissa) and Mekala (the region near the source of the Narmada).What is india:Inscriptions of the kalachuri-chedi era.Source-{ Coins & Currency Systems Of North-Central Indian Kingdoms,(Kalachuri Inscriptions)}. = Capitals = Besides Bhadravati, the other capitals of Dakshina Kosala at various times included Sirpur (ancient Shripura), Tuman (ancient Tummana), and Ratanpur (ancient Ratnapura). Bhadravati may have been the capital of Dakshina Kosala as late as during Xuanzang's time, although Sirpur is another candidate for the contemporary capital of the region. The 601 CE Arang inscription of king Bhimasena II suggests that Shripura was the capital of the local Rishitulyakula kings, possibly since the 5th century. In the subsequent period, it served as the capital of the Panduvamshi kings, who are described as the lords of Kosala in their inscriptions. Tummana and Ratnapura became the capitals of Dakshina Kosala centuries later. Tummana was founded by Kalingaraja, a descendant of the Tripuri Kalachuri king Kokalla I (c. 875 CE). Ratnapura was established by Ratnadeva, a later descendant of Kalingaraja and a king of the Ratnapura Kalachuri dynasty.  Legends  In ancient Indian literature as well as the epic Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranas there are many references to the ancient Kosala Kingdom of northern India. Surya Vanshi Ikshvaku dynasty kings ruled Kosala with Ayodhya as their capital. Sri Ramachandra was a king of that clan, based on whose character and activities, the Ramayana was written. This work mentions that after Rama, the kingdom was divided among his two sons, Lava and Kusha. North Kosala went to Lava as his share with Shravasti Nagari as his capital while Kusha received South Kosala. He established his new capital, Kushasthalipura on the riverKushavrate near the Vindhya mountain range, which divides north and south India. Kushasthalipura is identified as near Malhar in the present-day Bilaspur district of Chhattisgarh state. As part of his military campaigns, Sahadeva targeted the kingdoms in the regions south of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Vanquishing the invincible Bhismaka, Sahadeva then defeated the king of Kosala in battle and the ruler of the territories lying on the banks of the Venwa, as well as the Kantarakas and the kings of the eastern Kosalas.Mahabharata, Book 2, Chapter 30  History  After the fall of the imperial Guptas, the Dakshina Kosala region was ruled by a number of small dynasties, including the Amarāryakulas, the Panduvamshis of Mekala (Pāṇḍavas of Mekala), the Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala (Pāṇḍuvaṃśīs of Śripura), and the Sharabhapuriyas. The chronology of these dynasties not very clear, because their inscriptions are dated in regnal years instead of a calendar era. The only ancient inscription found in this region that appears to be dated in a calendar era is the Arang copper-plate inscription of Bhimasena II of Sura family. However, it is not connected to any other records from the area, and therefore, is not much useful for reconstructing the region's chronology. The Pāṇḍavas of Mekala are known from two Malhar inscriptions issued by king Śūrabala, the last member of the dynasty. The king claimed descent from the legendary hero Pāṇḍu of the lunar dynasty (somavaṃśa). The Amarāryakulas (Amarārya family) are known from the Malhar inscription of Vyaghraraja. D. C. Sircar believes this family to be same as the Sharabhapuriyas, Ajaya Mitra Shastri believes it to an independent dynasty, while Hans T. Bakker believes it to be a vassal of the Sharabhapuriyas. The Sharabhapuriyas initially ruled as Gupta vassals, and may have fought with the Nalas of Pushkari. They laid foundation of the distinct Dakshina Kosala style of art and architecture. The Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala seem to have been related to the Panduvamshis of Mekala, and initially served as feudatories to the Sharabhapuriyas. The early kings of the dynasty were Vaishnavites, but its last known king Mahāśivagupta Bālārjuna called himself a devotee of Shiva (parama-māheśvara), and also patronized the Buddhists. The Chinese traveler Xuanzang visited the region during his reign, and described his kingdom (\\"Kiao-sa-lo\\" or Kosala) as follows: The Panduvamshis of Dakshina Kosala may have been related to the later Somavamshi dynasty, who ruled in present-day Odisha.

While normal classroom or distance education is based on the premise that all should get equal attention (a democratic principle), be exposed to same curriculum and evaluated on the same pattern ('One size fits all'), ILP presumes that the needs of individual students are different, and thus, must be differently addressed. Emphasis on the student's role in the learning experience has been shown in research to be crucial to a productive learning experience. The Individual Learning Plan can also be used by an individual on their own or as part of a community of interest, a team or an organization to manage learning over the course of their life. This is explored further in the article \\"Learning Plan.\\" Adopted by many institutes as a teaching methodology, ILP for a student is generated after interaction between the student and the teacher, and is based upon assessment made therein. Further, ILP: • Incorporates long-term goals of the student • Synthesizes with the larger educational framework • Gives credence to the student's aspirations - cultural, artistic, social, or personal Individual Learning Plans are mandatory to complete for all students in Alaska (2010), Arizona (2008), Colorado (2010), Connecticut (2012), Delaware (2007), Georgia (2009), Hawaii (2009), Idaho (2011), Indiana (2006), Iowa (2008), Kentucky (2002), Louisiana (1998), Maryland (2008), Massachusetts (2007), Michigan (2009), Minnesota (2013), Missouri (2006), Oregon (2011), Rhode Island (2011), South Carolina (2006), South Dakota (2010), Virginia (2013), Washington (2000), West Virginia (1996), and Wisconsin (2013) in order to graduate.  Purpose  The Individual Learning plan has many purposes, including: • Discovery of many careers, beginning in the sixth grade • Career matching making services • Developing education plans • Creating, maintaining and changing resumes • Setting personal goals and keeping these insight as school progresses • Saving and reflecting on activity including community service, work experience, career planning activities, and extra curricular activities • Exploring colleges and postsecondary opportunities that fit with desired career, and other life goals • Collecting personal information including assessment results, advising activities demographic information and educational history • Keeping track of all courses taken Also, the Individual learning plan is set to establish college and career readiness throughout middle school and high school. According to the Alliance for Excellent Education, the graduating classes were more prepared for college-level work (in all four content areas of Mathematics, Reading, English and Science) after students created/used and ILP. On the other hand, in this same research, it was determined that nearly 16,200 students did not graduate in 2012, a fact that equates to a $4.2 billion lifetime earning loss for that class of students. This could be due to the lack of College and Career Readiness throughout states that do not implement Individual Learning Plans. The lack of college and career readiness does not only affect the student themselves, but also communities as a group. The lack of these critical skills in high school students can deny the community jobs and business due to the unfulfilled need for qualified employees.  Functions  = Resume Builder = Tools located within the ILP can help you store and organize information more successfully, with no question about career development, activities, and experiences. Once a student saves information about a chosen career, school or other objective, students can record their opinion, interest, and thoughts. Also, through Career Matchmaker services students can save and name many different matchmaker results, and save which they feel they could be more successful doing. With this comes a tool very common and frequently used, the Resume Builder. This enables help on creating personalized, and more professional- looking resumes. Information saved to an individual’s ILP is automatically shared with the Resume Builder. (Cite) = Career Match Maker/Career Exploration = The Career Exploration section offers a number of assessment tools to help you discover your skills, abilities, and learning preferences. With this it uses that information to identify suitable career options for the students using this tool. Career Cruising and Career Matchmaker can help a student better understand how interest and career choices go hand in hand, due to shared likes, skills, and interest to occupations in certain programs. Throughout the Career Cruising there are hundreds of occupations with profiles. These profiles include interviews with people within the career, salary information, job outlook, and locations. In the employee interviews, located in the profiles of each career, they ask key questions including about their typical workday, pros and cons, and advise for students interested in pursuing that career. There are a couple ways to search for careers, including by keyword, index, school, subjects, career cluster, or career selector given to you after using Career Matchmaker. = College Search = Individual Learning Plan provides detailed school profiles for thousands of 2 and 4 year colleges, career and technical schools across the country. You can either search for particular schools/ programs, or use the School Selector to find schools that meet a variety of criteria. You can see which schools offer your chosen program, cost of enrollment, and the type of the community. (Cite)  Teacher's Point of View  The process of advising students is a shared responsibility that can have a significant impact on transition to postsecondary education. Teachers are required to lead, guide and direct students in setting and reaching goals. This can be done through ILP or by day-to-day contact with students. This leads to several opportunities for teachers to share college and career readiness dialogue that assists students in focusing on their futures. This also enables students and teachers to focus on one specific goal for on student, therefore the conversations are more centered around that individual student. When teachers utilize the resources in the Individual Learning Plan (ILP) during classroom instruction, students can see the relevance of the content as it relates to their plans for life after high school. This may lead students to become more motivated on reaching their goals. There are many benefits of encompassing the ILP into classroom instruction include: • More obvious sight of direct connections between classes and future goals made for students • More individual centered learning for each student for more successful engagement • More motivated students and more willing to take the steps necessary to reach goals through focusing on the work and assignment, which will lead them to gain the skills and knowledge necessary for a career • Teachers see a more direct correlation between the content they are teaching and the students’ goals for college and/or the workforce The role of Counselors, Teachers, and other staff who work with students is to guide, facilitate, and support in the process of developing their ILPs. Also, ensure that students are reflecting on their previous records in their ILP.

Caillat, Paris, pages 76-77, 125 The region and culture of Videha is often mentioned in Hindu literature.Geoffrey Samuel, (2010) The Origins of Yoga and Tantra: Indic Religions to the Thirteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, pages 69-70 The texts mention the idea of royal dynasty and the tradition of philosopher-kings who renounce, with examples including Nami (or Nimi in some texts), Janaka and other kings. Their stories are found in ancient surviving Hindu, Buddhist and Jaina texts, suggesting that renunciation by kings was a respected tradition before the birth of Buddha, and that this tradition was also broadly accepted in regions other than Videha, such as in Pancala, Kalinga and Gandhara. King Nimi or Nami of Videha is included as the 21st of the twenty four Tirthankaras in Jainism (not to be confused with closely spelled Nemi, the 22nd Tirthankara). Towards the end of the Vedic period, Videha likely became part of the Vriji (Pali: Vajji) confederation and subsequently into the Magadha empire.H.C. Raychaudhuri (1972), pp. 70-76Raychaudhuri Hemchandra (1972), Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp. 85–86 The Videha kingdom is also mentioned in the Sanskrit epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. In the Ramayana, Sita is the princess from Videha, who marries Rama creating an alliance between the kingdoms of Kosala and Videha.Raychaudhuri (1972) The capital of Videha is believed to be either Janakpur (in present-day Nepal), or Baliraajgadh (in present-day Madhubani district, Bihar, India).https://hindi.news18.com/blogs/satyam/balirajharh-a-ancient- mithila-915917.html According to the Digambara Uttarapurana text, Mahavira was born in Kundpur in the Kingdom of the Videhas.

By definition, a fist-load weapon increases the mass of the hand so that, given the physical proportionality between the fist's momentum and its mass, it increases the force the bearer can deliver. Some fist-load weapons may also serve, in the same manner, as the guard on a sword, to protect the structure of the bearer's hand. History The Tekko evolved after five stages of development. The first, called the \\"Yawara\\", consisted of nothing more than a stick or rod, held in the inside the hand. The \\"chize kun bo\\", a stick with a loop of rope, which the user could attach to the hand for control,Campbell, 1987 came second. Third, the \\"Tekko\\" resembled the \\"chize kun bo\\" but, rather than a rope, had a sharpened wooden extension of the stick, which fit between the first or second finger. An Okinawan tool to help fisherman weave,Minowa, 1998 or haul in their nets without cutting their hand on coral,http://www.kenshin-kan.com/intex-2.html or a long hairpin used by Okinawan Bushi called a \\"kanzashi\\",Nakamoto, 1983 quite possibly served as the inspiration for this design. The Tekko appeared in hardwood form, and as soft molded metal so as to greater increase the mass of the hand. The fourth stage, or \\"Tek Chu\\", allowed for increased function over its predecessors in that it \\"extended beyond the clenched fist\\", \\"a distinct advancement in the evolution of fist-loaded weaponry\\". The design consisted either of a wooden stick carved with a wooden extension with a finger hole, or of a metal rod with and metal finger ring. The bearer held the rod in hand, with the ring around a finger. The Tek Chu often included a carved point or a metal spike protruding from the ring. Use of the true \\"Tekko\\" per se started with the \\"Horseshoe Tekko\\". Because weapons were banned in Okinawa, the Okinawans sought to put otherwise agricultural implements to martial use. \\"The use of the horseshoe appears to have originated when Bushi in Okinawa used the shoes of their horses as makeshift weapons to defend themselves against surprise attack.McCarthy, 1998; Nakamoto, 1983 \\"They simply put a horseshoe into the hand to punch with\\" (Ryukyu Hon Kenpo Kobjutsu Federation). Held as a \\"U\\" with the hand in the middle, the two ends extended outwards.http://www.shotokankarate.ca/kobudo.html Practitioners also tied two horseshoes together directly facing and overlapping each other. This design provided greater hand mass, and defensive guard, but resulted in larger weapons, not easily concealed, and more difficult to learn. The improved horseshoe tekko featured the two horseshoes welded together. However, the popularity of the horseshoe tekko faded, as attention turned to the smaller, more concealable horse stirrup. The horse stirrup (\\"abumi\\") version consists of a semicircle, with two ends connected by a bar. Some think of this as solely a fist-loaded weapon: primarily a form of knuckleduster (brass knuckles). However, stirrup of Okinawan lineage does not have dividers to separate the fingers. Furthermore, the traditional stirrup tekko consists of light metal and wood, whereas modern day manufacturers of the knucklebuster version tend to focus on heavy metals such as brass, although modern models made out of such diverse materials as aluminium, wood, steel, iron, and even plastic do exist. Construction Artisans crafted the traditional stirrup upon which the modern design evolved from either wood or metal and were often made from a piece of flat bar, bent into a horseshoe shape and held together by a bolt., to form a \\"D\\" shape. For weapons application, would-be combatants sometimes enhanced the design by embedding additional bolts into the horseshoe shape, to inflict greater injury. Other styles of tekko exhibit sharp protrusions at either end and three spikes representative of the position of the knuckles. As the most recent incarnation, the stirrup version remains the favorite of a predominance of Kobudo practitioners. Controversy surrounds the stirrup tekko . because many Kobudo practitioners liken them to \\"brass knuckles\\", the possession of which the jurisdiction of many states prohibit as concealed weapons. Owning, and carrying this brass knuckles, often has legal ramifications. However, \\"brass knuckles\\" have finger dividers; stirrup tekko do not. Although many Kobudo practitioners claim that brass knuckles evolved from the tekko, brass knuckles more closely resembles the handle of the Western \\"trench knife\\". One cannot always distinguish between the appearance of the tekko and that of the knives. Westerners came in contact with Okinawan martial art in the 1940s. The trench knife, and Western brass knuckles, date back to World War I http://www.donrearic.com/brassknuckles.html (with pictures of the \\"brass knuckle handle\\" trench knife dating back to 1917). Another controversy surrounds the desire of some Kobudo practitioners to revive the horseshoe tekko. Differing schools advocate for the stirrup or horseshoe. Although advocates for the stirrup tekko emphasize near consensus, the horseshoe tekko practitioners concern themselves not so much with the forward evolution of the weapons as with the preservation of the original Okinawan cultural \\"jutsus\\" or \\"art forms\\". Advocates of the horseshoe version argue that the design best suits the functions as passed down in traditional kata for the weapon. Specific features of the Horsehoe Tekko, not found in the stirrup version, allow for new and interesting applications to emerge. In form and function, the horsehoe tekko more closely resembles a specialized knife such as a \\"double knife,\\" a miniature \\"moon knife\\" or \\"duck knife\\". Unlike \\"brass knuckles\\" that rely primarily on \\"bludgeoning\\", the Horseshoe Tekko emphasizes \\"shielding against\\" (blocking) and \\"hooking\\" (capturing) incoming weapons attack, as well as \\"stabbing\\" an opponent or \\"hooking\\" anatomically vital points. Current practitioners Current practitioners of Tekko kata include those in the lineage of Master Taira Shinken also called Ryukyu Kobudo, which features the kata Maezato no Tekko. Other Tekko kata include Maezato no tekko (Ryu Kon Kai), Akamine, Takemyoshi, Miyazato, Kakazu, Kaneigawa, and Matayoshi (odo). The kata include heavy use of slashing and stabbing movements. The Tekko of Okinawan Kobudo (weapons kata) can be used to grip, squeeze and impale various parts of the anatomy at close quarters. The use of tekko remains an eclectic weapon used by select martial artists to practice discipline, and to express an ancient form of art. Current experts in the area usually will not teach the discipline unless the prospective student already has displayed appropriate demeanor over the course of many years for the training in other martial arts areas.

It is an active-duty associate unit administratively assigned to the 495th Fighter Group and operates aircraft assigned to the Air Force Reserve Command's 301st Fighter Wing. Prior to its reactivation in 2015, the unit's last assignment was that of a subordinate unit of the 354th Fighter Wing based at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, flying the Republic A/OA-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. The squadron was inactivated on 15 August 2007 as a result of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) 2005. History =World War II= Activated on 15 November 1942 at Hamilton Field, California, initially equipped with P-39 Airacobras and assigned to IV Fighter Command for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to Portland Army Air Base, Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new North American P-51B Mustangs. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the European Theater of Operations, being assigned to IX Fighter Command in England. In late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany being conducted by VIII Bomber Command was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the VIII Fighter Command's Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts lacked the range to escort the heavy B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers deep into Germany to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, Eighth Air Force to perform escort missions. From its base at RAF Boxted, the unit flew long- range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging Luftwaffe day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German Bf 109 and Fw 190 interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty. Was relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to RAF Lashenden on the southern coast of England. Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy and along the English Channel coast of France and the Low Countries, April–June 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. North American P-51B-1-NA Mustang Serial 43-12408 of the 355th Fighter Squadron, photo probably taken at RAF Boxted, England, early 1944. Moved to Advanced Landing Grounds in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France. Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields. Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at Ansbach (R-45). Remained in Occupied Germany as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe XII Tactical Air Command occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at AAF Station Herzogenaurach. Was inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Cold War= Reactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated 354th Fighter-Day Group at the new Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina. Equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the Tactical Air Command within the US and abroad. The unit frequently deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Wheelus Air Base, Libya. Was deployed to Europe during the 1958 Lebanon crisis and was moved to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. =Vietnam War= Former 355 TFS North American F-100D-80-NH \\"Super Sabre\\" 56-3374 on a mission into North Vietnam from Phu Cat AB, South Vietnam In- flight formation of 3 LTV A-7Ds (S/N 70-0967, 70-0983 and 71-296) of the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand in December 1972. On 3 February 1968 the 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron was deployed to support the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Phù Cát Air Base, South Vietnam for five months' Temporary Duty (TDY). At the end of the TDY on 5 July, the 355 TFS was permanently assigned to the 37th, with activated New Jersey and District of Columbia Air National Guard personnel from the 113th Tactical Fighter Wing at Myrtle Beach replacing them and manning the unit. On 15 May 1969 with the reassignment of the 612th and 174th Tactical Fighter Squadrons, it was decided to convert the 37th to a McDonnell F-4 Phantom II wing. The F-100 equipped 355th, along with the 416th Tactical Fighter Squadron were reassigned to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at Tuy Hoa Air Base, replacing the Air National Guard 136th and 188th Tactical Fighter Squadrons which were returning to New York and New Mexico, respectively. At Tuy Hoa, the tail code of the 355th F-100s was changed to \\"SP\\", and deployed Air National Guard personnel from New York and New Mexico and regular Air Force personnel manned the 355th until its inactivation on 30 September 1970. During its time in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close air support, interdiction, search and rescue, and helicopter support missions. The squadron was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm for its service. On 1 November 1970, the 355 TFS was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina as part of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing. Upon its return, the unit transitioned to the new LTV A-7D Corsair II aircraft before redeploying to Southeast Asia in the fall of 1972 as the first A-7 unit to fight there. In 10 weeks of combat before the end of that conflict, the squadron participated in the Linebacker II campaign, generated more than 4,000 sorties, and was credited with 22 rescues of downed airmen. The unit returned to Myrtle Beach in April 1974. =Post-Vietnam era= 355th Tactical Fighter Squadron Personnel – March 1991 – King Fahd International Airport after victory in Operation Desert Storm In February 1978, the 355 FS transitioned to the new Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, a close air support aircraft, becoming the second operational squadron in the nation's first A-10 wing. Duty called again in August 1990 when the unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. There, the squadron's pilots inflicted heavy damage to Iraqi armor and artillery emplacements, helped cut off enemy supply lines, and conducted search and rescue missions. The squadron contributed greatly to the 4,200 artillery, tank and other vehicle kills credited to A-10s during the war. =Modern era= Inactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was reactivated on 20 August 1993, replacing the inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska. The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close air support, interdiction, joint air attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue. With a dual role A/OA-10 Warthog squadron commitment and night vision goggles, the squadron had the ability to deploy forward air controllers with attack aircraft for a complete day and night employment capability. 355 FS deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy from January 1996 to March 1997, supporting Operation Joint Guard. No ordnance was employed, but pilots flew sorties and sat alert with combat loaded aircraft. The 355th FS also provided air liaison officers for the 172d Stryker Brigade Combat, providing advice, as ground forward air controllers, on the use of fighters and the tactical employment of close air support assets. In October 1998, the 355 FS deployed to support Operation Southern Watch. Only two months later, the Warthogs saw their second tour of combat duty over Iraq while participating in the 16–19 December 1998, Operation Desert Fox strike missions. In 2.5 months, the 355 FS flew 597 combat and combat support sorties leading up to, then conducting, National Command Authority directed strikes on Iraqi military facilities and suspected weapons of mass destruction storage areas. They achieved 100 percent target hit rate. An A-10 Thunderbolt II of the 355th Fighter Squadron sits on the tarmac at Eielson before a mission, 2004 The unit deployed to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, in support of Operation Southern Watch, January–March 2001. The 355 FS also exercised at Hurlburt Field, Florida, to train with Special Forces units, October 2003. In Spring 2004 the unit deployed to Bagram Air Base, Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The unit redeployed there again early 2006. During both deployments the unit was responsible to provide close air support to Army ground forces and convoys in Afghanistan. =Base realignment and closure= On 13 May 2005, The Department of Defense proposed a major realignment of the base as part of the Base Realignment and Closure program. The A-10 aircraft were to be distributed to the 917th Wing at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana (three aircraft); to a new active-duty unit at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia (12 aircraft); and to backup inventory (three aircraft). Lt Col Quentin \\"Q-Tip\\" Rideout, 355th Fighter Squadron Commander, flew the last operational A-10 sortie at Eielson AFB on 31 July 2007. The last three A-10 aircraft departed Eielson AFB on 15 August 2007. Lt Col Kevin \\"Crotch\\" Blanchard flew 81-944, Capt Sean \\"Shark\\" Hall flew 79-172, and Capt Dale \\"Porkchop\\" Stark flew 80-259. Although the aircraft were originally scheduled to depart at 0700, they were delayed until 0830 because of foggy conditions. Lt Col Blanchard was the first to lift off, followed closely by Capt Hall. When Capt Stark took off, and shortly before disappearing into the clouds, he tipped the wings of his jet, a final farewell salute to Eielson AFB and the 355th Fighter Squadron. =Current operations= In 2010, Detachment 457, a geographically separated unit of the 20th Operations Group at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, stood up at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, Texas. The unit oversaw the integration of over 130 active-duty General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon pilots and maintenance personnel into the Air Force Reserve Command's 301st Fighter Wing under the Total Force Initiative. On 8 March 2013, the 495th Fighter Group was stood up at Shaw as a dedicated unit overseeing ten active associate fighter units, including Detachment 457. On 5 October 2015, Detachment 457 discontinued and was replaced by the 355th Fighter Squadron, which reactivated the same day. It remains under administrative command of the 495th Fighter Group and flies and maintains F-16s assigned to the 301st's 457th Fighter Squadron at Fort Worth.

The mall's original name came from its location at the intersection of Columbia & Memorial Drives near Avondale Estates. It was demolished in 2007. Anchors The mall's original anchors were Davison's and Sears. Macy's developed the mall, which consisted of of shop space on two levels and was the second-largest mall in Atlanta at the time. After Sears closed and before renovations began, some indoor and outdoor shopping mall scenes for the Chuck Norris movie \\"Invasion USA\\" were filmed here. The \\"entry\\" crash of the Chevy pickup into the mall was shot at the mall's main entrance. The scenes inside the mall with the Nissan pickup were inside the mall nearest the Davison's end. The escalator scene was inside the old Sears building, and the \\"exit\\" crash through the window was on the western side of Sears on the first level (the movie then cut to an exterior scene of a mall in South Florida). After the filming, Columbia Mall was purchased by Cadillac Fairview and Scott Hudgens Co. in 1983, who announced plans to renovate the space. At the same time, Sears announced that it would close its store there. The mall was expanded into both floors of the former Sears store, which were subdivided into smaller tenant spaces. At one time, the lower level of the old Sears building housed a new, smaller Sears Outlet Store, which became a Goody's for some time. The mall also featured a McCrory's. Later years The decline at the mall began in the 1970s and 1980s. When the two anchor stores left in 1984 and 1995, the mall was unable to attract replacements. Management tried in 1995 to increase foot traffic. After Davison's/Macy's left the mall, that anchor building's upper floor was converted to a 16 screen movie theater, while the lower floor remained vacant except for a newly built stairwell leading from the lower level mall to the upper level theaters. This addition to the mall may have helped keep them up and running for another 6 years, but the mall was closed at the end of 2001.Greene, Kelly (16 December 2001). Tough times for the nation's older shopping malls, The Day (New London) (reprint from The Wall Street Journal) Demolition Demolition of the mall began in February 2007. The last two walls of the old Sears came down on March 21, 2007. The former mall was replaced with a Wal-Mart Supercenter, as well as space for condominiums and commercial outlets. This plan met with strong resistance from residents of nearby Avondale Estates. However, the Wal-Mart opened in March 2008.

Built on the slopes of Geumjeongsan, it is one of the country's best known urban temples.  Origin of name  The mountain where Beomeosa is found is said to have huge rock at the summit where there is a golden well which never, ever dries up. The water of this well is believed to have very special magical properties as one day a golden fish came from heaven and has lived there ever since. Beom(범;梵) = nirvana - eo(어;魚) = fish - sa(사;寺) = temple. Thus the name of the temple came to be ＂Heavenly Fish.＂ It is also claimed that the fish came from Nirvana, the Buddhist state of non-suffering. Therefore, the temple also became known as ＂The temple where fish from Nirvana Play.＂ On December 26, 2011, the Los Angeles Times printed a story of the fighting monks at this temple. South Korean Buddhist monk Ando demonstrates Sunmudo martial arts techniques. Monks from Beomeosa Temple are famed for defeating Japanese invaders during the late 16th century and again during the Japanese occupation of Korea in the early 20th century.  History  Beomeosa Temple (Korean: 범어사, Chinese: 梵魚寺, Pronounced “Beo-meo-sa”) is located on Mt. Geumjeongsan in Busan, and was established in 678 as one of the ten major temples of the Avatamsaka School. According to the Sinjeung dongguk yeoji seungnam (新增東國輿地勝覽; Revised Academic Geography for the Eastern Country), a golden fish descended from heaven and frolicked in a well on this mountaintop. Thus, the mountain was named “Geumjeongsan (金井山; literally ‘Golden Well Mountain’),” and the temple built on it was named “Beomeosa (梵魚寺; literally ‘Spiritual Fish Temple’).” As it was established by decree of King Munmu, Beomeosa Temple began on 360 gyeol of land and had 360 dormitory rooms. However, it was almost reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion (1592-1597). Later, in 1613, monks like Ven. Myojeon and Ven. Haemin renovated some of its Dharma halls and the dormitory. The Main Buddha Hall and One Pillar Gate are known to have been built at that time. Beomeosa Temple is considered one of the three major temples in southeast Korea, along with Haeinsa Temple and Tongdosa Temple. Its strong Seon Buddhist spirit has earned it the title “Great Headquarters Temple of Seon Buddhism.” Seon Master Gyeongheo, an eminent monk of modern times, opened a Seon center at Beomeosa in 1900. Inspired by Ven. Gyeongheo, Seongwol, then abbot of Beomeosa, taught the Seon tradition by establishing Seon centers and Seon assemblies in Beomeosa's six hermitages in the span of 10 years as follows: Geumgangam in 1899; Anyangam in 1900; Gyemyeongam in 1902; Wonhyoam in 1906; Ansimnyo in 1909; and Daeseongam in 1910. Eminent monks who have lived at the temple include Great Masters Uisang, Pyohun, Nangbaek, Myeonghak, Gyeongheo, Yongseong, Manhae and Dongsan. Even today, Beomeosa Temple teaches serious Buddhist practice. In 2012, the temple was designated a Geumjeong Chongnim, one of eight comprehensive monastic training complexes for the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism, and its first spiritual patriarch is Master Jiyu.  Landscape  The superb scenery of Mt. Geumjeongsan and Beomeosa Temple are called the “three extraordinary sites of Beomeosa Temple” and “eight scenic wonders of Mt. Geumjeongsan.” The three extraordinary sites are: the rock peak behind Wonhyoam Hermitage; two rocks in the shape of a chicken at Gyemyeongam Hermitage; and the legendary “golden well” on top of Mt. Geumjeongsan. The eight scenic wonders refer to: the pine forest around Eosan Bridge at the entrance of the temple; moonlit autumn nights at Gyemyeongam Hermitage; rain at night at Cheongnyeonam Hermitage; the sound of the temple bell heard from Naewonam Hermitage; the murmuring of the mountain stream at Daeseongam Hermitage; late autumn foliage at Geumgangam Hermitage; the view of the sea from Uisang Peak; and the clouds encircling Godang Peak, the summit of Mt. Geumjeongsan.  Treasures  Well before reaching the Beomeosa Temple compound, visitors first see Jogyemun (Treasure No. 1461), the One Pillar Gate. All of its four pillars have short wooden columns sitting on high stone bases. Around the temple is a mass of wild wisteria, consisting of over 6,500 plants (Natural Monument No. 176). Every year in late spring, their lavender blossoms create an extraordinary sight, unseen anywhere else in Korea. That's why this valley has been called since ancient times “Deungungok (藤雲谷; ‘Wisteria Blossom Valley’).” The temple complex has several buildings and other objects which are designated as official treasures: * Treasure 250 - Three Story Stone Pagoda. This pagoda dates back to the Unified Shilla era probably erected as part of the original temple that was destroyed by fire in 1592. Only the top three-stories are from the Shilla where the base and fence are later additions. * Treasure 434 - Daeungjeon, the main temple hall, was built in 1614 after the temple was burned down during the Japanese invasion of 1592. Major renovations of Daeungjeon were undertaken in 1713, 1814 and 1871. * Tangible Cultural Asset 2 - Iljumun. The first gate to the temple, called the \\"One Pillar Gate\\" because when viewed from the side the gate appears to be supported by a single pillar, symbolizing the one true path of enlightenment, supporting the world. * Tangible Cultural Assets 11 and 12 - Wonhyoam Eastern Pagoda and Wonhyoam Western Pagoda. Wonhyoam (hermitage) is located to the south of Beomeosa and is the site of these two pagodas. This the site of the former residence of the famous Shilla monk, Wonhyo. * Tangible Cultural Asset 15 - Flag Pole Holder. These two very old stone structures, called a jiju, were used to support a flagpole between them. The stones are found on the path up to Beomeosa's main gate. * Tangible Cultural Asset 16 - Stone Lamp. This lamp dates back to the Unified Shilla era and was part of the original temple that was destroyed by fire in 1592. = Gallery - Main Temple = Image:Korea-Busan-Beomeosa 6236-07 Three Stroried Pagoda.JPGTreasure 250 - Beomeosa Three Story Stone Pagoda built some time between 826-836, during the Silla era.

The image greatly exaggerates the size of the Montem moundEton Montem (or ad Montem – literally to the Mountain) was a custom observed by Eton College from at least 1561 until it was finally suppressed in 1847, at the Montem Mound (or Salt Hill) in Chalvey, Slough, Buckinghamshire (later Berkshire). The mound is situated some 2 miles from the college near the London to Bath coach road, now the A4. Montem is first reported in William Malim's consuetudinarium (book of customs) of 1561, when it seems to have been an initiation ceremony for new boys, who were scattered with salt (which can mean 'wit' as well as 'salt') at the mound. By the 18th century, the ceremony had changed to a glorified flag day. Salt was no longer scattered on scholars; instead, pinches of salt and little blue tickets were sold to passers-by (the blue ticket – inscribed on alternate celebrations with 'Mos Pro Lege' or 'Pro More et Monte' – acted as a ticket of exemption from further contributions) for 'salt' – money that went towards the anticipated expenses of the Captain of the School (the senior Colleger) at King's College, Cambridge. Collecting was restricted to two 'salt-bearers' (also senior boys at the college) and ten or twelve 'servitors' or 'runners' who between them covered all the roads around Eton and Windsor. Until 1758, Montem was held annually in January. The timing was then moved to the more clement weather of Whitsun Tuesday and the festival became biennial. In 1778, the frequency was reduced further so that Montem was only celebrated once every three years. As time passed, the event seems to have become bigger, becoming eventually a semi-military muster of the whole school. Crowds and royalty (including at various times Queen Charlotte, George IV, William IV, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert) flocked to see the event. Towards the end of the ceremony's life, more than £1000 would typically be collected in salt, but this was before expenses, leaving substantially less for the Captain of the School to take to university. Eton Schoolboys, in ad Montem dress (Francis Alleyne, before 1815) A feature of the later Montems was the publication of a \\"Montem Ode\\", composed for the occasion, and sold in the form of a broadside to visitors and Etonians. It typically consisted of doggerel punning rhymes, giving the names of the chief personages in the procession and alluding to their individual characteristics. It professed to be written by a local worthy who was styled the \\"Montem Poet\\", but in reality it was the production of some youthful wags in the school. The office of Montem Poet was held from the 1770s until 1834 by Herbert Stockhore of Windsor, an eccentric individual who had begun his career as a bricklayer. Arrayed in a tunic and trousers of patchwork, an old military coat, and a chintz-covered conical head-dress, with rows of fringe on it like the crowns on a papal tiara, he drove about in a donkey-cart, reciting his Ode, and flourishing copies of it in the air to attract the attention of possible customers. After his death, there was a contest for the vacant office, and a certain Edward Irwin was elected, the boys recording their votes as they came out of Church one afternoon.LYTE, Henry Churchill Maxwell, A History of Eton College (1440–1875), London, 1875.Blackmantle, Bernard (pseudonym), The English Spy, Sherwood, Jones & Co., London, 1825 The final Montems in 1841 and 1844 followed the opening of the Great Western Railway and attracted large and rowdy crowds from London. In view of this (and the much diminished profit to be made), headmaster Edward Craven Hawtrey and Provost Francis Hodgson abolished the custom before the 1847 Montem. The reduced anticipated profit can be seen from the fact that the potential beneficiary was compensated with a payment of £200. In 1791, Arthur Atherley, later Member of Parliament for Southampton, had his portrait painted whilst at Eton College by Sir Thomas Lawrence – this portrait now hangs in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The portrait show Atherley in the uniform of captain of the Ad Montem club. In a novel interpretation of the ceremony the early 20th century neo-druidic writer E.O.Gordon suggested that the Montem was one of several ceremonies with pagan origins that the college founder Henry VI stipulated should be followed at Eton. Gordon cites college statutes for the celebration of May Day and the autumnal equinox and suggests that these and the Montem ceremony were instigated by Henry to show his links back to Celtic kings. Gordon describes the Montem mound (which she also calls Sol's Hill) as one of several important Druidic places of assembly around London.Gordon, E.O. Prehistoric London. Its Mounds and Circles. The Covenant Publishing Co.London 1914 Description of Montem by Benjamin Disraeli from his novel Coningsby, circa 1840 Five hundred of the youth of England, sparkling with health, high spirits, and fancy dresses, were now assembled in the quadrangle. They formed into rank, and headed by a band of the Guards, thrice they marched round the court. Then quitting the College, they commenced their progress 'ad Montem.' It was a brilliant spectacle to see them defiling through the playing fields, those bowery meads; the river sparkling in the sun, the castled heights of Windsor, their glorious landscape; behind them, the pinnacles of their College. The road from Eton to Salt Hill was clogged with carriages; the broad fields as far as eye could range were covered with human beings. Amid the burst of martial music and the shouts of the multitude, the band of heroes, as if they were marching from Athens, or Thebes, or Sparta, to some heroic deed, encircled the mount; the ensign reaches its summit, and then, amid a deafening cry of 'Floreat Etona!' he unfurls, and thrice waves the consecrated standard.Disraeli, Benjamin \\"Coningsby\\", London 1844.

The Armenian Orthodox Apostolic Church gave rise to the Armenian Evangelical Church; similarly the Armenian Brotherhood Church was born out of the Armenian Evangelical Church. In the beginning of the twentieth century, many people in some of the suburbs of Cilicia, including Harpert, Marash, Hasan Bay, Aintab, and Adana, joined the Brotherhood fellowship, a group that sprang out of the Evangelical Church which was having unofficial meetings. The Armenian Genocide did not permit this group to prosper in Cilicia. After the massacres, the remaining Armenian people migrated to the Middle East and settled in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Egypt. Those who migrated to Europe mainly settled in Greece and France. Among those who settled in these countries, some spiritual brothers began similar meetings, first at homes and later in rented halls, and finally, when the number of the constituency increased and funds allowed, they began to move into church buildings. Among those who migrated to Aleppo, Syria, were Brothers Abraham Seferian, Minas Bozoklian and Mihran Kasardjian. They gathered people of the three denominations, Orthodox, Catholic and Evangelical, and began to have unofficial home Bible studies. In time this group grew and took more official status, and finally it was named as the Spiritual Brotherhood Church. This later spread into other countries, with names such as Armenian Evangelical Brotherhood Church, Armenian Brotherhood Bible Church, etc. Numerous Brotherhood Churches were established in the Middle East: Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad, Tehran, Cairo, Alexandria.

History The company was founded in 1902 by William Gindra and Edward Green, two Pretoria businessmen who started a small stationery and general printing factory in Pretorius Street and named it after early English printer William Caxton. In 1947, Dr HJ van der Bijl became chairman of the board; he was the driving force behind the company going public the same year, as Caxton Ltd. In 1961, Caxton was purchased by Eagle Press and at the same time acquired its first newspaper, the South African Jewish Times. During the same year Caxton moved its operations to Doornfontein in Johannesburg. In 1968, Caxton again changed ownership, this time to Felstar Publications. During the same year, The Germiston Eagle was introduced as a weekly supplement to the South African Jewish Times. This was the forerunner of all community newspapers in South Africa. By 1978, Caxton were publishing the following newspapers either fortnightly, monthly or weekly: Sandton Chronicle, North Eastern Tribune, Northcliff and Blackheath Times, Randburg Sun, Southern Courier, Mayfair-Brixton, Newlands-Melville Telegraph, Rosebank Killarney Gazette and Roodepoort Record. In 1985, Caxton acquired CTP (Cape and Transvaal Printers), a R100-million printing company. This enabled Caxton to meet the growing demand for the high-speed, high-quality printing of newspapers and magazines. Caxton/CTP (as the company became popularly known) later consolidated their various subsidiary companies under the CTP banner and, post-1994, formed a partnership with the National Empowerment Consortium (NEC). Caxton and another publisher, Perskor, merged in July 1998, forming a company with a turnover in excess of ZAR R2 billion a year. As a result of the merger The Citizen, a daily newspaper, was also acquired. =Magazines= Caxton/CTP's magazine division publishes fifteen titles in the following sectors: family magazines, women's magazines, home, lifestyle and decor, lifestyle and entertainment, religion and farming. Of them, Bona, Country Life, Essentials, Food & Home, Garden & Home, People, Rooi Rose, Vrouekeur, Woman & Home and Your Family were all closed by the company in May 2020. Newspapers Caxton/CTP's newspaper division either owns or co-owns 88 titles, although a significant number of these are free community newspapers. The division's newspapers operate from fifty offices in eight of South Africa's nine provinces and have a combined print run of over two million copies. Websites Of the five newspaper titles which Caxton is involved with, 72 titles have websites which are regularly updated. This group of sites is known as the Local News Network; a network of hyperlocal websites which run daily community content. Local News Network and the success of The Citizen’s website makes Caxton the second-largest digital publisher in South Africa, as per Effective Measure statistics from August 2018.

Woods first came to prominence as a beauty queen, winning the titles of Miss Texas Teen USA and Miss Teen USA 1996. She later appeared as an actress and as a participant on reality television show, The Amazing Race. Pageants =Miss Teen USA 1996= Woods won the Miss Houston Teen USA title in 1995, then competed in Miss Texas Teen USA 1996, winning the title. She represented Texas in the 1996 Miss Teen USA pageant broadcast live from Las Cruces, New Mexico in August 1996, and became the first woman from her state to win the Miss Teen USA title. As Miss Teen USA, her sister titleholders were, Alicia Machado, Miss Universe 1996, of Venezuela, and Ali Landry, Miss USA 1996, of Louisiana. She also reigned alongside Brook Lee, who briefly held the title of Miss USA 1997 before winning the 1997 Miss Universe pageant; and Miss Teen USA 1989 and 1st runner-up to Miss USA 1997, Brandi Sherwood, who succeeded Lee as Miss USA. During her reign, Woods traveled extensively throughout the United States and made appearances for charity, giving up her title in August 1997, when she crowned Shelly Moore of Tennessee as Miss Teen USA 1997 in her home state, Texas. =Miss Texas USA 2002= In 2001, Woods returned to pageantry and competed in the Miss Texas USA 2002 pageant as Miss Central Texas. She was one of six former Miss Texas Teen USA titleholders to participate in the event. Woods won the swimsuit, interview, and Miss Photogenic awards, but only placed third runner-up. This was the first time that a former Miss Teen USA titleholder did not win a Miss USA state pageant on their first try. Woods' successor to the Miss Texas Teen USA title, Andria Mullins, also lost and placed second runner-up to eventual winner, Miss Dallas Fort Worth, Kasi Kelly, who was not even a former Miss Texas Teen USA. =Miss Texas USA 2003= The following year, Woods tried and won the Miss Houston USA title, gaining the right to compete at Miss Texas USA 2003 and once again failed to win the crown, only placing as one of the semifinalists alongside Mullins, who also competed, but was not crowned either. This time Woods' predecessor to the Miss Texas Teen USA crown, Mandy Jeffreys, matched Woods' 2002 placement as third runner-up, only to lose to Nicole O'Brian, Miss Texas Teen USA 2000, who could not capture the Miss Teen USA 2000 or Miss USA 2003 crowns. =Miss Texas USA 2004= Woods competed for the third time in Miss Texas USA 2004, and again only placed in the semifinals. This was her last attempt at the title, because of age restrictions imposed on contestants. Woods would represent the changing times, where none of the former Miss Teen USA titleholders would win a Miss USA state crown. Jamie Solinger of Iowa (3rd runner-up to Mrs. America 2005) and Shauna Gambill of California (first runner-up to Miss USA 1998 and Top 10 at Miss World 1998) would be the last in 1998. Television =Acting= Woods played Rowena in the TV series The New Adventures of Robin Hood in the late 1990s. She also had guest appearances on Malibu, CA (1998) and USA High (1998). The Amazing Race Woods appeared with her then boyfriend, now life partner, Colin Guinn on The Amazing Race 5 and placed second. Woods and Guinn were also expecting to be in the All-Star edition of the show; however, Woods was expecting the couple's first child and therefore could not participate. In 2019, Woods and Guinn competed on and won The Amazing Race 31.

Ministries are located in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. History In 1977 Carl Wieland organised the Creation Science Association (CSA) in Adelaide in South Australia. In 1978 the organisation began the magazine Ex Nihilo (from the Latin phrase Creatio ex nihilo, meaning \\"Creation out of nothing\\"). Soon after, the Creation Science Foundation (CSF) took over production of Ex Nihilo (later renaming it Creation Ex Nihilo, and eventually simply Creation). In 1984, CSF started the Ex Nihilo Technical Journal for more in-depth analysis of creation issues (it was later renamed Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal, then simply TJ, and now the Journal of Creation). In the mid-1990s Ken Ham, formerly of the Creation Science Foundation and then part of the Institute for Creation Research, formed an autonomous ministry in the United States. This ministry, along with the Australian Creation Science Foundation, were branded \\"Answers in Genesis\\" (AiG); eventually, legally-autonomous Answers in Genesis offices were opened in Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. In October 2005 Ken Ham separated the US and UK AIG offices from the other offices.Creation Ministries International – About us, history In early 2006, the Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa re-branded as \\"Creation Ministries International\\". In late 2006 CMI established offices in the UK and United States. Since then CMI has distributed Creation magazine and the Journal of Creation in the United States itself. CMI publishes Creation magazine as well as the Journal of Creation. Creation has subscribers in more than 170 countries, with 60,000 copies of each issue produced. Creation is published four times a year. The Journal of Creation is published three times a year. The Voyage That Shook the World The Voyage That Shook The World is a 2009 dramatised documentary film commissioned by Creation Ministries International and produced by Fathom Media. It was released to mark the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of his seminal work On the Origin of Species. This 52-minute-long film includes interviews with scholars, academics and scientists covering a wide range of views including proponents of the scientific consensus on evolution as well as proponents of intelligent design and young earth creationism. It features wild-life footage from the Galapagos Islands as well as on-location footage from Argentina, Chile, Tierra del Fuego, and the United Kingdom. The film's dramatised sequences were shot on location in Tasmania, Australia. Legal controversy with Answers in Genesis CMI's history is closely linked with that of its daughter ministry in the United States, Answers in Genesis (AiG), founded by former Australian colleague Ken Ham. A legal and personal dispute broke out between the Australian and US arms of AiG in 2005, involving claims of unethical dealing in the handling of magazine subscriptions and autocratic leadership on Ham's part. A more involved analysis of the situation is described in an account in the Reports of the National Center for Science Education. A lawsuit was filed on 31 May 2007, by CMI in Supreme Court of Queensland against Ken Ham and Answers in Genesis, seeking damages and accusing \\"unbiblical/unethical/unlawful behaviour\\" in Ham's dealings with the Australian organisation. CMI produces Creation Magazine and the Journal of Creation, formerly distributed by the US and UK AiG offices to their respective countries prior to the split. The Australian group maintains it was disconnected from all its American subscribers when the US office \\"announced on its web site (without telling us, the publishers) that it was ceasing to distribute both of these publications (and simultaneously announced its own magazine)\\". CMI further alleged in the lawsuit that AiG misrepresented their own magazine to subscribers as a replacement of Creation. CMI is claiming $252,000 (US) in damages for lost revenue by misleading and deceptive conduct in relating to lost subscriptions. The case also concerns use of the trademark \\"Answers in Genesis\\" within Australia, and alleged misuse by Ken Ham of his position as a director for the Australian group to cause it detriment. Answers in Genesis has had little to say in public to these accusations, but in comments to news reporters Ken Ham dismisses them all as \\"totally preposterous and untrue\\". In February 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ordered Australian-based Creation Ministries International into arbitration in the United States with Answers in Genesis (as sought by AiG) over copyrights and control of affiliates in other countries. In April 2009, the ministries reached a settlement and ended their dispute.

It is one of the least well-known Okinawan weapon systems. The tinbe can be made of various materials but is commonly found in vine, cane, metal, or turtle shell. The shield size is generally about 45 cm long and 38 cm wide. The length of the rochin is usually equivalent to the length of the forearm and can be found in many differing designs varying from spears to short swords and machete-style implements. In use, the techniques tend to be circular in order to avoid excessive contact with the shield. The short spear is predominantly used in an upward stabbing motion, piercing armor under the rib cage, armpits, and throat although dependent upon the type of Rochin used, slashing motions can also be employed.

He was patron of the philosopher John Locke. Early life Popham was born at Littlecote House in Wiltshire, the son of Sir Francis Popham and Anne Gardiner Dudley, and grandson of Sir John Popham and wife Amy Games. He was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, and admitted to the Middle Temple in 1622. Antebellum Popham was a prominent figure and Justice of the Peace in Somerset. In April 1640 he was elected Member of Parliament for Bath in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Bath for Long Parliament in November 1640. Civil War and Interregnum Popham came from a Presbyterian family and was himself an elder in the church. He supported the Parliamentary cause and fought in the Parliamentary army with the rank of colonel and had a garrison stationed at Littlecote House. Despite his Presbyterianism, his sympathies lay with the Army during the Second Civil War, so he survived Pride's Purge in late 1648 and – after the execution of Charles I and the founding of the Commonwealth – he served on the Council of State. In 1654, he was elected MP for Bath again in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was elected MP for Wiltshire in the Second Protectorate Parliament and for Minehead in the Third Protectorate Parliament. He did not support the Protectorate and although he sat in the Protectorate parliaments he refused to take his seat in Cromwell's Other House (1657–1658). Restoration In April 1660, he was elected MP for Bath again in the Convention Parliament. After the restoration of the monarchy, he made his peace with Charles II and entertained him to a \\"costlie dinner\\" at Littlecote. He was re-elected MP for Bath in 1661 to the Cavalier Parliament.

He was born in Schoharie, New York in 1770, the son of German immigrants; the family name was originally spelled Krausler or Kruessler. His father served in the British Army during the American Revolution under Sir John Johnson; the son was a drummer with Butler's Rangers. They both settled in Williamsburgh Township after the war. Crysler operated a tavern, cut timber to supply the Royal Navy with masts and built gristmills and sawmills. In 1804, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada representing Dundas. In 1806, he was appointed justice of the peace in the Eastern District. He served with the local militia during the War of 1812, becoming captain. The Battle of Crysler's Farm was fought on his property and his farm sustained heavy damage during the battle. He represented Dundas in the Legislative Assembly from 1812 to 1820 and from 1825 to 1828. In 1825, some of his employees were jailed for cutting timber on clergy reserves. He became lieutenant-colonel in the local militia in 1838 and led his regiment into combat at the Battle of the Windmill. He died in Finch Township in 1852. The village of Crysler was named after him. His son John Pliny served in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada. The former location of his farm was submerged when the St. Lawrence Seaway was built; a monument erected on the site of the battle was moved to Upper Canada Village.

One of his students at the University of Munich was Max Planck, whom he advised in 1878 not to go into physics, saying, \\"in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few unimportant holes.\\" Planck replied that he didn't wish to discover new things, only to understand the known fundamentals of the field. Nevertheless, Planck's work opened up the field of quantum physics. Jolly died in Munich.

Adjacent to the springs is the restored monastery of 'Agii Anargyri which is now being used as a spa hotel. The monastery was built in 1649 and is said to be one of the first ever on the island. It was founded by two brothers who used to care for the sick and dying without taking any payment for it. It is said that this is how the monastery got its name, from the Greek meaning ‘without payment’. Another myth, spread among the inhabitants of the surrounding villages, goes like this: Many years ago a number of monks lived in the monastery and one day an argument broke out. As well as using sticks and stones in their dispute, these mild-mannered monks relieved the cellar of its supply of eggs, as it was during the period of Lent. As a result of the argument, the eggs broke and the water from the springs took the smell of rotten eggs. Miliou is one of the smallest villages in Cyprus and has a population of about 60. It is also one of the greenest villages in the area, thanks to an abundant supply of spring water, surrounded by citrus groves, almond trees and vineyards.

Usually made of wood and standing at least tall, they have a single pole making up most of the height, with a sturdy base to prevent toppling, and an array of lengthy pegs at the top for placement of hats.

He probably died in the beginning of the 10th century in a battle against the Magyars.  Biography  Mojmir succeeded his father Svatopluk I as the king of Great Moravia in 894. At the same time, the Principality of Nitra was given as an appanage to his brother Svatopluk II. But Svatopluk II, supported by Arnulf of Carinthia, king of East Francia, rebelled against Mojmir II in 895 and again in 897, when he concluded an agreement of cooperation with Arnulf. As a result, Mojmir II attacked his brother, but was defeated by East Frankish troops sent to support Svatopluk II's rebellion. Weakened by internal conflict, Great Moravia lost its peripheral territories: It ceded the Balaton Principality to the Eastern Franks in 894, after Magyar tribes had looted this region. Bohemia, seceding from Great Moravia in the following year, became Arnulf’s vassal, and Lusatia followed suit in 897. Another danger emerged, when Magyars crossed the Carpathians to settle permanently in the Carpathian Basin (895/896). In 896, they settled or were settled in the scarcely populated territories of Great Moravia, residing around the upper/middle Tisza River in 900/901. After several looting raids in Europe, they moved to Transdanubia. Despite these disasters, Mojmir managed to consolidate his power. In 898 he asked the Pope to consecrate new Great Moravian clerics in order to decrease the influence of Bavarian clerics in his country. The Bavarians (Eastern Franks), upset by the 898 demand, sent troops to Great Moravia, which Mojmir defeated. Moreover, Mojmir captured the still rebellious Svatopluk II, but the latter was eventually rescued by the Bavarian troops, with whom he fled to Germany. After the death of Arnulf, the Pope finally sent his legates to consecrate a Great Moravian archbishop and three bishops in 899, thus decreasing the influence of the Bavarian clergy. The only thing we know about them is that the archbishop allowed liturgies to be conducted in Old Church Slavonic again (i.e., as opposed to Latin liturgies) and one of them had his seat in Nitra. As mentioned above, in 900 the Magyars invaded Transdanubia (a former Great Moravian territory occupied by Franks) and raided Bavaria together with Mojmir’s troops. Eastern Francia was compelled to conclude a peace treaty with Great Moravia in 901 and Mojmir was reconciled with his brother, who is assumed to have returned to Great Moravia about this time. The peace treaty with the Eastern Franks also put an end to wars between Great Moravia and the Frankish vassal Bohemia lasting since 895. When and whether the territory that is now southern Poland seceded from Great Moravia is unknown. Nevertheless, the Magyars became dangerous for both Eastern Francia and Great Moravia. Mojmir stopped their attacks in 902 and 906. In 904, he was even assisted by a Bavarian contingent. Mojmir II and Svatopluk II probably died in 906, a year of intense warfare with the Magyars. In 907, the Magyars routed the Bavarian army at the three battles of Bratislava. Mojmir or any name of a successor is not mentioned in connection with these important battles. After 907 the Great Moravian Empire began to disintegrate. The remnants of the core territory of Great Moravia were divided between the newly established states of Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary, and small local rulers continued to rule for some decades in the mountains of what is now Slovakia.

The rights and obligations of a husband regarding his spouse and others, and his status in the community and in law, vary between societies, cultures and have varied over time. In monogamous cultures, there are only two parties to a marriage, which is enforced by laws against bigamy and polygamy. Traditionally, the husband was regarded as the head of the household and was expected to be the sole provider or breadwinner, a role that continues in some cultures (sometimes described as paternalistic). Today, a husband is not necessarily considered the breadwinner of the family, especially if his spouse has a more financially rewarding occupation or career. In such cases, it is not uncommon for a husband to be considered a stay-at-home father if the married couple have children. The term continues to be applied to such a man who has separated from his spouse and ceases to be applied to him only when his marriage has come to an end following a legally recognized divorce or the death of his spouse. On the death of his spouse, a husband is referred to as a widower; after a divorce a man may be referred to as the \\"ex-husband\\" of his former spouse. Origin and etymology The term husband refers to Middle English huseband, from Old English hūsbōnda, from Old Norse hūsbōndi (hūs, \\"house\\" + bōndi, būandi, present participle of būa, \\"to dwell\\", so, etymologically, \\"a householder\\"). Related terms At the conclusion of a valid wedding, the marrying parties acquire the status of married persons and, while the marriage persists, a man is called a husband. In heterosexual marriages the woman is called a wife; in same-sex marriages between males, each male is called a husband. Although \\"husband\\" is a close term to groom, the latter is a male participant in a wedding ceremony, while a husband is a married man after the wedding and for the duration of the marriage. The term husband refers to the institutionalized role of the married male, while the term father refers to the male in context of his offspring, a state which may or may not indicate that a marriage ceremony has taken place. In some cases of heterosexual marriage, before the marriage, the forthcoming husband or his family may have received a dowry, or have had to pay a bride price, or both were exchanged. The dowry not only supported the establishment of a household, but also served as a condition that if the husband committed grave offenses upon his wife, he had to return the dowry to the wife or her family. For the time of the marriage, they were made inalienable by the husband.Britannica 2005, dowry He might leave his wife (or wives), then widow (or widows), a dower (often a third or a half of his estate) to support her as dowager. As an external symbol of the fact that they are married, each spouse commonly wears a wedding ring on the ring finger; whether this is on the left or right hand depends on the country's tradition. \\"Husband\\" further refers to the institutionalized form in relation to the spouse and offspring, unlike father, a term that puts a man into the context of his children. Also compare the similar husbandry,See Wiktionary which in the 14th century referred to the care of the household, but today means the \\"control or judicious use of resources\\", conservation, and in agriculture, the cultivation of plants and animals, and the science about its profession.Merriam–Webster's Collegiate Dictionary Western culture =Historical status= Seuso and his wife In premodern heterosexual unions (ancient Roman, medieval, and early modern history), a husband was obliged to protect and support not only his wife and children, but servants and animals of his domain. The father (as the \\"patron\\") was awarded with much authority, differing from that of his wife (in these cultures, no polygamy existed). In the Middle Ages and Early Modern European history, it was unusual to marry out of love, but then doing so became an influential ideal.William C. Horne, Making a heaven of hell: the problem of the companionate ideal in English marriage, poetry, 1650–1800 Athens (Georgia), 1993 During this period, a husband in a heterosexual marriage had more opportunities in society than his wife, who was not recognized as legally independent.William Blackstone, Commentaries upon the Laws of England =Contemporary status= In contemporary secularized Western culture, the rights of the spouses have been made equal. The civil marriage generally forces the wealthier spouse \\"breadwinner\\" to provide alimony to the former spouse, even after separation and also after a divorce (see also Law and divorce around the world). The legal status of marriage allows each spouse to speak on the other's behalf when one is incapacitated (e.g., in a coma); a husband is also responsible for his spouse's child(ren) in states where he is automatically assumed to be the biological father.Cuckoo's egg in the nest, Spiegel 07, 2007 Religion =Islam= In Islamic marital jurisprudence, husbands are considered protectors of the household and their wives. As protector, the husband has various rights and obligations that he is expected to fulfill and thus is offered opportunities different from that of his wife or wives, not only in legal and economical affairs of the family but within the family as well. As in most cases in Islam law and culture, everything is being related to the Qur'an. Many Muslims may agree on a perfectly equal relationship.Heba G. Kotb MD, Sexuality in Islam , PhD Thesis, Maimonides University, 2004 Islam is the only major religion that puts a cap on polygamy, limiting the number of a man's wives to four—provided the husband can do justice to all of them. Although some religions, such as Catholicism for instance, puts a cap on polygamy all together, or even serial monogamy, allowing one spouse until death does them apart, not even accepting divorce. According to the teachings of Islam a Muslim man should have a valid reason and have to get permission from his existing wife (without any force) if he requires to marry again. Islam vehemently abhors any intimate relationship outside the bond of marriage. There is no external sign to show his status as a husband, unless he adopted the tradition of wearing a wedding ring. =Hinduism= A Hindu husband traditionally takes his wife to his home. He is expected to provide for her and to prove his abilities to do so. The marriage in Hinduism is a relationship for Seven births (सात जन्मों का रिश्ता). Before 1951 there was no divorce allowed in Hindu marriage. In modern times once again after 1951, equal rights for women through society and law jurisdiction is given. In Hinduism, based on the different regions, marriage process is observed differently with the same Saat Pheras around agni kund (light pyre) to be taken to become a husband and wife. The Encyclopædia Britannica mentions that \\"In Hindu law, the male members of a joint family, together with their wives, widows, and children, are entitled to support out of the joint property.\\"Britannica, Economic aspects of family law (from family law) =Buddhism and Chinese folk religions= China's family laws were changed by the Communist revolution; and in 1950, the People's Republic of China enacted a comprehensive marriage law including provisions giving the spouses equal rights with regard to ownership and management of marital property.Britannica 2004, Legal limitations on marriage (from family law) = Christianity = In Christianity, according to the Bible, a husband in a heterosexual marriage has a number of honors: * To present his bride to God throughout their lives as perfectly holy and virtuous as can be. * To protect his wife with his own life, physically, emotionally and \\"spiritually\\". * To \\"lay down\\" his life, counting her more important than himself. * To lead his wife and his family into the best things for them. * To be the best that he can be in God's power. * To not withhold his body from her. Other cultures In Japan, before enactment of the Meiji Civil Code of 1898, all of the woman's property such as land or money passed to her husband except for personal clothing and a mirror stand.Britannica, Legal limitations on marriages (from family law) Expectation of fidelity Although there is generally an expectation for a spouse not to have sexual relations with anyone other than his spouse(s), historically, in most cultures, this expectation was not as strong as in the case of wives, a situation which was evident in legal codes which prohibited adultery, with male adultery often being criminalized only if \\"aggravating\\" circumstances existed, such as if he brought his mistress in the conjugal home, or if there was public scandal. The double standard was also evident in divorce laws of many countries, such as the UK or Australia, which differentiated between female adultery, which was a ground of adultery by itself, and male adultery, which was a ground only under certain circumstances.http://www.aifs.gov.au/institute/seminars/finlay.html This double standard continues to be seen today in many parts of the world. For instance, in the Philippines, a wife can be charged with the crime of adultery (for merely having one act of sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband), while a husband can only be charged with the related crime of concubinage, which is more loosely defined (it requires either keeping the mistress in the family home, or cohabiting with her, or having sexual relations under scandalous circumstances). A breach of this expectation of fidelity is commonly referred to as adultery or extramarital sex. Historically, adultery has been considered a serious offense, sometimes a crime. Even if that is not so, it may still have legal consequences, particularly a divorce. Adultery may be a factor to consider in a property settlement, it may affect the status of children, the custody of children, etc. See also * Wife * Husband-selling * Hypergamy * Polygamy in Christianity * Polyandry References Further reading * Terms for men ","title":"Husband"},{"id":"4318359","text":"Bermagui is a town on the south coast of New South Wales, Australia in the Bega Valley Shire. The name is derived from the Dyirringanj word, permageua, possibly meaning 'canoe with paddles'.  Geography  It is said that 12 miles offshore from Bermagui the edge of the continental shelf is at its closest point to the mainland and hence there is good fishing. Anglers may catch, or tag and release; (NSW DPI Game Fish Tagging programme. 2013), Marlin, and Tuna such as Yellowfin, Bluefin, and Albacore, which are sought after 'game fish'.  History  A wharf was built in Horseshoe Bay in 1888 for the coastal trade. The port was serviced by the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company. A 1910 article, 'Bermagui – In a Strange Sunset', published by Henry Lawson in The Bulletin describes a steamer journey from Bermagui to Sydney. Lawson was probably travelling with the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company. In 1880, the Government geologist, Lamont Young, and four others disappeared while on a boat trip from Bermagui. Their boat was found near Mystery Bay, which is about 15 kilometres north of Bermagui, midway between Bermagui and Narooma, near Tilba. The bay received its name because of the disappearance. Zane Grey, the well-known big-game fisherman of the 1930s and author of Westerns, wrote of his experiences there. He was patron of the Bermagui Sport Fishing Association for 1936/37 and anchored his yacht, the \\"Avalon\\" in Horseshoe Bay. He returned briefly for a visit in 1939. Bermagui Beach and Mount Dromedary In 1943, the Japanese submarine I-21 sank the iron ore carrier SS Iron Knight off the coast of Bermagui. Local fisherman had tangled their nets on the wreck deep below the surface in 125 metres of water, but did not know the ship lay there until a team of divers confirmed its existence on 4 June 2006. On 29 July 2006 relatives and descendants of the ship's crew came to Bermagui for a memorial and commemorative service.Yourguide, Narooma site, news article from Wednesday 9 August 2006.  Population  In 2016, there were 1,536 people in Bermagui. 77.9% of people were born in Australia and 89.0% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 35.2%, Anglican 22.5% and Catholic 15.5%.  Literature and movies  Zane Grey filmed part of his shark film White Death (1936) and wrote the storyline for Rangler River (1936) while camped at Bermagui. His book of his game fishing adventures here An American Angler in Australia was published in 1937. He also worked on his epic Australian Western novel Wildness Trek while in Bermagui, which was not published until after his death in 1944. During the 1940s and 1950s the detective writer Arthur Upfield lived in the town and made it the setting for one of his novels, The Mystery of Swordfish Reef, published in 1943. Dorothy Hewett the author and well known Feminist and Communist wrote her gothic love story Neap Tide (Penguin, 1999) set in the fictional town of \\"Zane\\" while camped at Umbi Gumbi, Cuttagee to the south of Bermagui. Outdoor scenes from the film The Man Who Sued God (2001) starring Billy Connolly were shot in Bermagui. There are scenes of the Bermagui Boat Harbour, the main street, and surrounding beaches. Many locals are in the movie, and the classic boat is a local charter fishing boat. Bermagui locals thoroughly enjoyed Billy Connolly's visit .Filming Locations for The Man Who Sued God , IMDb. Retrieved W13 January 2006. In January 2005, the Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, and his family retreated here from the media, before his decision to resign as ALP leader and from Parliament, writing in The Latham Diaries that \\"God has given us Bermagui, let's enjoy it\\". The historic wooden Wallaga Lake Bridge north of Bermagui was the setting for a scene in the 2014 film Unbroken.  Transport  A fishing harbour was built at Bermagui in 1959, the first in a new series by the Public Works Department.

History In the 19th century there was intellectual and spiritual awakening in Constantinople. This awakening and enlightenment pushed the reformists to study the Bible. Under the patronage of the Armenian Patriarchate, a school was opened, headed by Krikor Peshdimaljian, one of the leading intellectuals of the time. The principal aim of this school was to train qualified clergy for the Armenian Apostolic Church. The result of this awakening was the formation of a society called the \\"Pietistical Union\\". The members held meetings for the study of the Bible. During these meetings and Bible studies, questions were raised regarding the practices and traditions of the church, which to them seemed to conflict with biblical truths. These reformists faced strong retaliation from the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople. Eventually, after Patriarch Matteos Chouhajian excommunicated the reformists, they were forced to organize themselves into a separate religious community, the Protestant Millet. This separation led to the formation of the Armenian Evangelical Church in 1846. Today, there are approximately 100 Armenian Evangelical churches in the following countries: Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, England, France, Georgia, Greece, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Uruguay, and the United States of America.

The genus consisted of only two species, both of which became extinct in the mid-1980s. The genus is unique because it contains the only two known frog species that incubated the prejuvenile stages of their offspring in the stomach of the mother. The combined ranges of the gastric-brooding frogs comprised less than . Both species were associated with creek systems in rainforests at elevations of between . The causes of the gastric-brooding frogs' extinction are not clearly understood, but habitat loss and degradation, pollution, and some diseases may have contributed. The assignment of the genus to a taxonomic family is hotly debated. Some biologists class them within Myobatrachidae under the subfamily Rheobatrachinae, but others place them in their own family, Rheobatrachidae. Scientists at the University of Newcastle and University of New South Wales announced in March 2013 that the frog would be the subject of a cloning attempt, referred to as the ”Lazarus Project”, to resurrect the species. Embryos were successfully cloned, and the project eventually hopes to produce a living frog. The southern gastric brooding frog has been listed as Extinct by the IUCN because it has not been recorded in the wild since 1981, and extensive searches over the last 35 years have failed to locate this species. Taxonomy The genus Rheobatrachus was first described in 1973 by David Liem and since has not undergone any scientific classification changes; however its placement has been controversial. It has been placed in a distinct subfamily of Myobatrachidae, Rheobatrachinae; in a separate family, Rheobatrachidae; placed as the sister taxon of Limnodynastinae; and synonymized with Limnodynastinae. In 2006, D. R. Frost and colleagues found Rheobatrachus, on the basis of molecular evidence, to be the sister taxon of Mixophyes and placed it within Myobatrachidae.Amphibian Species of the World – Rheobatrahus (under \\"Comments\\"). research.amnh.org Both species of gastric-brooding frogs were very different in appearance and behaviour from other Australian frog species. Their large protruding eyes and short, blunt snout along with complete webbing and slimy bodies differentiated them from all other Australian frogs. The largely aquatic behaviour exhibited by both species was only shared (in Australia) with the Dahl's Aquatic Frog and their ability to raise their young in the mother's stomach was unique among all frogs. =Common names= The common names, \\"gastric-brooding frog\\" and \\"platypus frog\\", are used to describe the two species. \\"Gastric-brooding\\" describes the unique way the female raised the young and \\"platypus\\" describes their largely aquatic nature. Southern gastric-brooding frog (R. silus) =Distribution= The southern gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus silus) was discovered in 1972 and described in 1973, though there is one publication suggesting that the species was discovered in 1914 (from the Blackall Range). Rheobatrachus silus was restricted to the Blackall Range and Conondale Ranges in southeast Queensland, north of Brisbane, between elevations of above sea level.Hines, H., Mahony, M. and McDonald, K. 1999. An assessment of frog declines in Wet Subtropical Australia. In: A. Campbell (ed.), Declines and Disappearances of Australian Frogs. Environment Australia. The areas of rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest that it inhabited were limited to less than . They were recorded in streams in the catchments of the Mary, Stanley and Mooloolah Rivers.Ingram, G. J. (1983). \\"Natural History\\". In: M. J. Tyler (ed.), The Gastric Brooding Frog, pp. 16–35. Croom Helm, London. Depending on the source, the last specimen seen in the wild was in 1979 in the Conondale Range, or in 1981 in the Blackall Ranges. The last captive specimen died in 1983. This species is believed to be extinct. =Description= The southern gastric-brooding frog was a medium-sized species of dull colouration, with large protruding eyes positioned close together and a short, blunt snout. Its skin was moist and coated with mucus. The fingers were long, slender, pointed and unwebbed and the toes were fully webbed. The arms and legs were large in comparison to the body. In both species the females were larger than the males. The southern gastric-brooding frog was a dull grey to slate coloured frog that had small patches, both darker and lighter than the background colouration, scattered over dorsal surface (back). The ventral surface was white or cream, occasionally with yellow blotches. The arms and legs had darker brown barring above and were yellow underneath. There was a dark stripe that ran from the eye to the base of the forelimb. The ventral surface (belly) was white with large patches of cream or pale yellow. The toes and fingers were light brown with pale brown flecking. The end of each digit had a small disc and the iris was dark brown. The skin was finely granular and the tympanum was hidden. The male Southern Gastric Brooding Frog was in length and the female in length. =Ecology and behaviour= The southern gastric- brooding frog lived in areas of rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and riverine gallery open forest. They were a predominately aquatic species closely associated with watercourses and adjacent rock pools and soaks. Streams that the southern gastric-brooding frog were found in were mostly permanent and only ceased to flow during years of very low rainfall.Meyer, E., Hines, H. and Hero, J.-M. (2001). \\"Southern Gastric-brooding Frog, Rheobatrachus silus\\". In: Wet Forest Frogs of South-east Queensland, pp. 34–35. Griffith University, Gold Coast. Sites where southern gastric-brooding frogs were found usually consisted of closed forests with emergent eucalypts, however there was sites where open forest and grassy ground cover were the predominate vegetation. There is no record for this species occurring in cleared riparian habitat. Searches during spring and summer showed that the favored diurnal habitat was at the edge of rock pools, either amongst leaf litter, under or between stones or in rock crevices. They were also found under rocks in shallow water. Winter surveys of sites where southern gastric- brooding frogs were common only recovered two specimens, and it is assumed that they hibernated during the colder months. Adult males preferred deeper pools than the juveniles and females which tended to inhabit shallower, newly created (after rain) pools that contained stones and/or leaf litter. Individuals only left themselves fully exposed while sitting on rocks during light rain. The call of the southern gastric-brooding frog has been described as an \\"eeeehm...eeeehm\\" with an upward inflection. It lasts for around 0.5 s and was repeated every 6–7 seconds. Southern gastric-brooding frogs have been observed feeding on insects from the land and water. In aquarium situations Lepidoptera, Diptera and Neuroptera were eaten. Being a largely aquatic species the southern gastric-brooding frog was never recorded more than from water. Studies by Glen Ingram showed that the movements of this species were very restricted. Of ten juvenile frogs, only two moved more than 3 metres between observations. Ingram also recorded the distance moved along a stream by seven adult frogs between seasons (periods of increased activity, usually during summer). Four females moved between and three males covered . Only three individuals moved more than (46 m, 46 m and 53 m). It appeared that throughout the breeding season adult frogs would remain in the same pools or cluster of pools, only moving out during periods of flooding or increased flow. Northern gastric-brooding frog (R. vitellinus) =Distribution= The northern gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus vitellinus) was discovered in 1984 by Michael Mahony. It was restricted to the rainforest areas of the Clarke Range in Eungella National Park and the adjacent Pelion State Forest in central eastern Queensland. This species, too, was confined to a small area – less than , at altitudes of . Only a year after its discovery, it was never seen again despite extensive efforts to locate it. This species is considered to be extinct. =Description= The northern gastric-brooding frog was a much larger species than the southern gastric-brooding frog. Males reached in length, and females in length. This species was also much darker in colour, usually pale brown, and like the southern gastric-brooding frogs its skin was bumpy and had a slimy mucus coating. There were vivid yellow blotches on the abdomen and the underside of the arms and legs. The rest of the belly was white or grey in colour. The tympanum was hidden and the iris was dark brown. The body shape of the northern gastric-brooding frog was very similar to the southern species. =Ecology and behaviour= The northern gastric-brooding frog was only recorded in pristine rainforests where the only form of human disturbance was poorly defined walking tracks. As with the southern gastric- brooding frog, the northern gastric-brooding frog was also a largely aquatic species. They were found in and around the shallow sections of fast flowing creeks and streams where individuals were located in shallow, rocky, broken- water areas, in cascades, riffles and trickles. The water in these streams was cool and clear, and the frogs hid away beneath or between boulders in the current or in backwaters. Male northern gastric-brooding frogs called from the water's edge during summer. The call was loud, consisting of several staccato notes. It was similar to the southern gastric-brooding frog's call although deeper, shorter and repeated less often. The northern gastric-brooding frog was observed feeding on caddisfly larvae and terrestrial and aquatic beetles as well as the Eungella torrent frog (Taudactylus eungellensis). Reproduction What makes these frogs unique among all frog species is their form of parental care. Following external fertilization by the male, the female would take the eggs or embryos into her mouth and swallow them. It is not clear whether the eggs were laid on the land or in the water, as it was never observed before their extinction. Eggs found in females measured up to 5.1 mm in diameter and had large yolk supplies. These large supplies are common among species that live entirely off yolk during their development. Most female frogs had around 40 ripe eggs, almost double that of the number of juveniles ever found in the stomach (21–26). This means one of two things, that the female fails to swallow all the eggs or the first few eggs to be swallowed are digested. At the time the female swallowed the fertilized eggs her stomach was no different from that of any other frog species. In the jelly around each egg was a substance called prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which could turn off production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. This source of PGE2 was enough to cease the production of acid during the embryonic stages of the developing eggs. When the eggs had hatched the tadpoles created PGE2. The mucus excreted from the tadpoles' gills contained the PGE2 necessary to keep the stomach in a non-functional state. These mucus excretions do not occur in tadpoles of most other species. Tadpoles that don't live entirely off a yolk supply still produce mucus cord, but the mucus along with small food particles travels down the oesophagus into the gut. With Rheobatrachus (and several other species) there is no opening to the gut and the mucus cords are excreted. During the period that the offspring were present in the stomach the frog would not eat. Information on tadpole development was observed from a group that was regurgitated by the mother and successfully raised in shallow water. During the early stages of development tadpoles lacked pigmentation, but as they aged they progressively develop adult colouration. Tadpole development took at least six weeks, during which time the size of the mother's stomach continued to increase until it largely filled the body cavity. The lungs deflated and breathing relied more upon gas exchange through the skin. Despite the mother's increasing size she still remained active. The birth process was widely spaced and may have occurred over a period of as long as a week. However, if disturbed the female may regurgitate all the young frogs in a single act of propulsive vomiting. The offspring were completely developed when expelled and there was little variation in colour and length of a single clutch.Tyler, M. J. (1994). Chapter 12, \\"Gastric Brooding Frogs\\", pp. 135–140 in Australian Frogs A Natural History. Reed Books Cause of extinction The cause for the gastric-brooding frogs' extinction is speculated to be due to human introduction of pathogenic fungi into their native range. Populations of southern gastric-brooding frogs were present in logged catchments between 1972 and 1979. The effects of such logging activities upon southern gastric-brooding frogs was not investigated but the species did continue to inhabit streams in the logged catchments. The habitat that the southern gastric-brooding frog once inhabited is now threatened by feral pigs, the invasion of weeds, altered flow and water quality problems caused by upstream disturbances. Despite intensive searching, the species has not been located since 1976 or 1981 (depending on the source). The Eungella National Park, where the northern gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented sections of the forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject to weed invasion and chytrid fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with gastric brooding frogs, were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent understanding of the role of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the temporal and spatial pattern of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog. Conservation status Both species are listed as Extinct under both the IUCN Red List and under Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999; however, they are still listed as Endangered under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. =De-extinction attempt= Scientists are making progress in their efforts to bring the gastric-brooding frog species back to life using somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), a method of cloning.Nosowitz, Dan (15 March 2013) Scientists Resurrect Bonkers Extinct Frog That Gives Birth Through Its Mouth. popsci.com In March 2013, Australian scientists successfully created a living embryo from non-living preserved genetic material. These scientists from the University of Newcastle Australia led by Prof Michael Mahony, who was the scientist who first discovered the northern gastric-brooding frog, Simon Clulow and Prof Mike Archer from the University of New South Wales hope to continue using somatic-cell nuclear transfer methods to produce an embryo that can survive to the tadpole stage. \\"We do expect to get this guy hopping again,\\" says UNSW researcher Mike Archer.Messenger, Stephen (15 March 2013) Scientists successfully create living embryo of an extinct species. treehugger.com The scientists from the University of Newcastle have also reported successful freezing and thawing (cryopreservation) of totipotent amphibian embryonic cells, which along with sperm cryopreservation provides the essential \\"proof of concept\\" for the use of cryostorage as a genome bank for threatened amphibians and also other animals.

She was previously Vice-Chancellor and President of RMIT University from 2005 to 2014, and has a background in economics. Education Gardner earned a Bachelor of Economics with first class honours from the University of Sydney, and later a PhD with a thesis on Australian industrial relations. Following the completion of her PhD, she was awarded a Fulbright Postdoctoral Fellowship and studied in the United States at the University of California, Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Cornell University.Professor Margaret Gardner, AO - RMIT University Career as an academic Gardner has had a prominent career as an academic, and has served in executive positions with Deakin University, Griffith University and Queensland University of Technology. Prior to her appointment as the Vice-Chancellor of RMIT, she was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland. Gardner was appointed Vice-Chancellor of RMIT on 4 April 2005, taking over from care-taker Vice-Chancellor Chris Whitaker. She has been Vice-Chancellor of Monash University since 1 September 2014. =Vice-chancellor of RMIT= At the time of Gardner's appointment as vice-chancellor, RMIT was at a crucial point in its 118-year history.RMIT's new chief one of a vice-chancellor pair (David Rood) - The Age, 22 January 2005 RMIT's previous vice-chancellor, Ruth Dunkin, resigned after only four years in the position and the university was fighting to overcome a A$24 million budget shortfall in 2004 that left it teetering on the edge of disaster.Picking up the poisoned chalice (David Rood) - The Age, 9 April 2005 By the end of her first year as vice-chancellor, RMIT had posted a A$23.2 million surplus for 2005 which increased to a A$50.1 million surplus by 2007.RMIT is back in the black (Lisa MacNamara) - The Australian, 2 May 2007 The fast turn around in finances at RMIT was achieved through the sale of property in the university's extensive real estate portfolio, a 9% increase in student fees and cutting 180 staff positions. =Other current leadership roles= Executive: *Chair of Universities Australia *President of RMIT International University Holdings Pty.

She's also a regular contributor to a wide range of international journals and speaker at various academic and government conferences. Between 1998 and 2002, as Chair of two major Queensland Government taskforces, Prof. Gardner also authored three government reviews: Queensland Industrial Relations Legislation, Pathways Articulation Through the Post-Compulsory Years of School to Further Education Training and Labour Market Participation. A selection of Gardner's research is available from the RMIT Research Repository.Author: Gardner, M - RMIT Research Repository Controversy In 2011 whilst Vice-Chancellor of RMIT, Gardner overturned the findings of an internal RMIT Redundancy Review Committee (RRC) and unlawfully terminated the employment of Social Sciences Professor Judith Bessant. The RRC found that fair process had been not been followed by the University and that there had been a failure of natural justice. Despite these findings, Gardner decided to proceed to make Professor Bessant redundant. On behalf of Bessant, the National Tertiary Education Union launched an \\"adverse action\\" claim against RMIT and Gardner in the Federal Court of Australia. The presiding judge, Justice Gray, was critical of Gardner's management of the case, especially given her considerable experience in industrial relations. In deciding the case, Gray also said he took into consideration the \\"apparent determination\\" by Gardner to \\"ignore her knowledge of Professor Hayward's animosity towards Professor Bessant\\". He also found that Gardner displayed a lack of contrition for what the court found to be a blatant contravention of workplace laws. The Federal Court reinstated Bessant, and indicated that she would be entitled to approximately $2 million in compensation if she was not reinstated. The Court also ordered RMIT to pay a civil penalty of $37,000 for two contraventions of the Fair Work Act 2009, as a warning to employers of the risks of using \\"sham\\" redundancies as a means for dismissing difficult employees. The case was reported in the national media, in addition to becoming an important case study that is widely discussed on legal websites. Bessant later published a personal account of the case. Honours In 2007, Gardner was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours, for her \\"service to tertiary education, particularly in the areas of university governance and gender equity; and to industrial relations in Queensland\\".2007 Australia Day Honours: Media Notes - Office of the Governor- General of Australia In 2020, she was upgraded to Companion of the Order of Australia for eminent service to tertiary education through leadership and innovation in teaching and learning, research and financial sustainability.

It is located south of Bickley and Bromley, east of Bromley Common, north of Locksbottom, and west of Petts Wood. History The area gets its name from South Barrow, a house that stood where Birdham Close now is in the 1600s. By the mid-19th century it remained a hamlet, with a few large houses and about 16 cottages. A description of Southborough is given in Charles Freeman's History, Antiquities, Improvements, &c.; of the Parish of Bromley, Kent, published in 1832. > Southborough is situated from Bromley nearly two miles: it contains about > sixteen houses, among which are the pleasant seats of Abraham Welland, Esq., > the late Governor Cameron, and others. Some of the premises here, from their > appearance, would indicate their erection to have taken place many years > ago. \\"Local tradition had it the hamlet had once been the court of a baron with the right to carry out executions, and that a gatehouse that had once stood on a farm there had been his prison. However John Dunkin, writing in 1815, believed that the fact that the Southborough had been part of a manor belonging to the Bishop of Rochester made the story \\"fabulous, or at least exaggerated by the mistakes of the ignorant rustics.\\" Further development occurred following the opening of Southborough Road train station in 1856, later renamed Bickley station. South Barrow went through a number of changes: it became Belmont School in 1901, Cloisters old people's home in 1922, and then later an office of the War Damage Commission, before being demolished in 1954. In 1977 Jubilee Country Park was opened to commemorate the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Amenities The identity of the area has merged somewhat with the contiguous areas of Bromley Common, Bickley and Petts Wood. It is centred on Southborough Road, which contains shops, two pubs (The Chequers and The Crooked Billet), a library and various places of worship.

After the West Coast FRS for the F-14 Tomcat, VF-124, was disestablished in the mid-1990s, VF-101 became the sole F-14 FRS. At the time it was based at NAS Oceana in Virginia. With the retirement of the F-14, VF-101 was deactivated in 2005. It was reactivated in 2012 and redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 101 (VFA-101). It was one of two F-35C Lightning II FRS before being deactivated in 2019 https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=109696. It was based at Eglin AFB, Florida with the joint 33d Fighter Wing (33 FW)http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=66309, as a subordinate unit of the U.S. Navy's Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet. History Two distinct squadrons have been called the Grim Reapers, VF-10 and later VF-101, which is the main subject of this article. Officially, the US Navy does not recognize a direct lineage with disestablished squadrons if a new squadron is formed with the same designation or nickname.http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq6-1.htm Often, the new squadron will assume the nickname, insignia, and traditions of the earlier squadrons. =1950s= F4D-1 aboard in 1957 On 1 May 1952, VF-101 was established at NAS Cecil Field, Florida. This new squadron assumed the nickname and traditions of the previous Grim Reapers and flew the FG-1D Corsair in the Korean War. Later in 1952, VF-101 received the jet-powered F2H-2 Banshee. The squadron was assigned to Carrier Air Group 1 aboard the and circumnavigated the globe between 27 December 1954 and 14 July 1955. In 1956, VF-101 transitioned to the F4D-1 Skyray, their first radar-equipped aircraft. The squadron was only once deployed for a short time during NATO Operation Strikeback from 3 September to 22 October 1957, this time being assigned to Carrier Air Group 7 aboard the . In April 1958, VF-101 was merged with the Fleet All Weather Training Unit Atlantic and began to train all weather fighter pilots on both the F4D-1 and the F3H-2 Demon. In becoming part of the training structure, VF-101 became part of Readiness Attack Carrier Air Wing 4 and ceased to be a deployable unit. =1960s= In June 1960, VF-101 established “Detachment A” at NAS Oceana which operated the F4H-1 Phantom II. By the end of 1962, the Skyray and the Demon had been phased out in favor of the F-4. Detachment A was disestablished and F-4 training moved to NAS Key West, Florida. On 1 May 1966, a new detachment was formed at NAS Oceana primarily to train replacement pilots and Radar Intercept Officers in the areas of aerial refueling, carrier qualification and conventional weapons. The Key West unit concentrated on air-to-air combat, missile firing and radar intercept techniques. In August 1967, VF-101 received the F-4J. =1970s= F-4J of VF-101 Det.66 in 1971 VF-101’s administrative command, Readiness Attack Carrier Air Wing 4, was disestablished on 1 June 1970, with VF-101 shifting control of Command to Fleet Air Key West. This moved lasted only a year, and the squadron moved from NAS Key West to NAS Oceana under the command of Commander Fighter Wing One. A detachment remained at Key West until the 2000s. From 6 July to 16 December 1971, VF-101 Det.66 was assigned to Carrier Air Wing 8 aboard the for a deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. In January 1976, VF-101 began operating and instructing aircrews and maintainers in the F-14 Tomcat. In 1975 and 1976 the squadron was awarded the CNO Aviation Safety Award and in November 1976 the unit received its fourth Safety Citation due to 36 continuous months without accident. On 5 August 1977, the F-4 training department of VF-101 was split into a separate new squadron, VF-171, which continued to train F-4 crews until disestablishment in 1984 after the last two Oceana F-4 squadrons (VF-74 and VF-103) began to transition to the Tomcat. VF-101 continued to train F-14 crews. =1980s= In 1986, VF-101 had completed 3 years of accident free operations earning them another Safety Citation, and in March 1988 they received a third CNO Safety Award. The same year, VF-101 began to receive the F-14A+ (later redesignated F-14B), which upgraded the F-14A's underpowered and troublesome engines with new engines that improved fuel economy and added 14,600 pounds-force (65,000 newtons) of thrust over the F-14A. The new fuel economy gave the F-14B one third more time on-station and sixty percent more range. =1990s= F-14B Tomcat Following a year of dedicated fleet efforts, led primarily by VF-24 at NAS Miramar, California, the first-ever bomb-dropping mission conducted by fleet Tomcats occurred on August 8, 1990 (a joint VF-24/VF-211 division of aircraft). Following that, on 12 September 1990, a VF-101 Tomcat dropped bombs from a \\"fleet aircraft\\" for the first time on the east coast. Previously, although initially designed as both a fully capable fighter and strike aircraft, the Tomcat had been assigned strictly to the air-to-air role. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and continuing to build on the earlier groundwork at both VX-4 and the west coast squadrons, VF-101 continued to add to its air-ground weapons training, eventually encompassing a whole range of air-to-ground weapons, from general-purpose bombs, cluster bombs, laser-guided bombs, air- launched decoys, and JDAM. VF-101's West Coast counterpart, VF-124 at NAS Miramar, was disestablished in 1994, making VF-101 the sole F-14 FRS. A VF-101 detachment was created at Miramar to continue F-14 crews and ground personnel training. When NAS Miramar became Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Miramar in 1996, all F-14 squadrons were moved to NAS Oceana and the VF-101 detachment was disestablished. Around this period the squadron also receive their first group of F-14D airplanes, which was the penultimate version of the Tomcat. =2000s= As F-14 squadrons began to transition to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, VF-101's mission diminished. During this time, several VF-101 aircraft featured the markings of disestablished F-14 squadrons--among them were VF-1, VF-21, VF-24, VF-33, VF-74, VF-84, VF-111 and VF-142. As the only F-14 FRS until its disestablishment in 2005, VF-101 at one point had as many as 130 F-14s of all three variants, as well as a small number of T-34 Mentors for currency training and range safety. VF-101 was deactivated on 30 September 2005, at a ceremony at NAS Oceana. Honored guests at the ceremony were the surviving members of the Flatley family (three generations of which were VF-101 pilots), who were presented with the squadron flag. =Reactivation and redesignation to \\"VFA-101\\" as F-35C Fleet Replacement Squadron= F-35C at Eglin AFB, 22 June 2013 On 1 May 2012, the squadron was reactivated at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida and redesignated Strike Fighter Squadron 101 (VFA-101),Naval Aviation News, Fall 2011, p. 36, published for the Chief of Naval Operations by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD (USPS 323-310 )http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=66309 The \\"Grim Reapers\\" are still an FRS; this time for the F-35C Lightning II, the aircraft carrier-capable variant of the F-35 that will serve in the U.S. Navy and selected carrier-deployable squadrons of the U.S. Marine Corps.http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/06/airforce_jsf_062010w/ The squadron administratively fell under Commander, Naval Air Forces and Commander Strike Fighter Wing, U.S. Pacific Fleet.

Dvārakā, also known as Dvāravatī (Sanskrit द्वारका \\"the gated [city]\\", possibly meaning having many gates, or alternatively having one or several very grand gates), is a sacred historic city in Hinduism, Jainism,See Jerome H. Bauer \\"Hero of Wonders, Hero in Deeds: \\"Vasudeva Krishna in Jaina Cosmohistory\\" in and Buddhism. It is also alternatively spelled as Dvarika. The name Dvaraka is said to have been given to the place by Bhagwan Krishna, a major deity in Hinduism. Dvaraka is one of the Sapta Puri (seven sacred cities) of Hinduism. In the Mahabharata, it was a city located in what is now Dwarka, formerly called Kushasthali, the fort of which had to be repaired by the Yadavas. In this epic, the city is described as a capital of the Anarta Kingdom. According to the Harivamsa the city was located in the region of the Sindhu Kingdom.2.56.22–30; In the Hindu epics and the Puranas, Dvaraka is called Dvaravati and is one of seven Tirtha (pilgrimage) sites for spiritual liberation. The other six are Mathura, Ayodhya, Kashi, Kanchipuram, Avantika (Ujjain) and Puri.  Description in the Harivamsa  *In Harivamsa, Dvaraka is described as largely built on \\"submerged land\\", \\"released by the ocean\\" (2.55.118 and 2.58.34). * The city was the former \\"sporting ground of the King Raivataka\\" called \\"Dvāravāti\\", which \\"was squared like a chess board\\" (2.56.29). * Nearby was the mountain range Raivataka (2.56.27), \\"the living place of the gods\\" (2.55.111). * The city was measured by Brahmins; the foundations of the houses were laid and at least some of the houses were built by the Yadavas (2.58.9 - 15). * It was built by Vishwakarman in one day (2.58.40) \\"mentally\\" (2.58.41 and 44). * It had surrounding walls (2.58.48 and 53) with four main gates (2.58.16). * Its houses were arranged in lines (2.58.41) and the city had \\"high buildings\\" (2.58.50 and 54) (2.58.53), which \\"almost touched the sky\\" (2.58.50), and had \\"doors that had the colour of white clouds\\" (2.58.48). * The fort walls of the city were \\"shining with the colour of the Sun and pots of gold\\" and \\"sounds emanating from grand houses sparkling with golden colour\\" (2.58.53).http://mahabharata-resources.org/harivamsa/vishnuparva/hv_2_058.html * It had a temple area with a palace for Krishna himself, which had a separate bathroom (2.58.43). * \\"The city is beautified on Earth by the ocean\\" like Indra's heavenly city is \\"beautified by an assembly of important jewels\\" (2.58.47 - 66, (2.58.49).  Dvaraka in Hindu scripture  = Description = View of Dwaraka The following description of Dvaraka during Krishna’s presence there appears in the Bhagavata Purana (Srimad-Bhagavatam; 10.69.1-12) in connection with the sage Narada’s visit. The City was filled with the sounds of birds and bees flying about the parks and pleasure gardens, while its lakes, crowded with blooming indivara, ambhoja, kahlara, kumuda, and utpala lotuses, resounded with the calls of swans and cranes. Dvaraka boasted 900,000 royal palaces, all constructed with crystal and silver and splendorously decorated with huge emeralds. Inside these palaces, the furnishings were bedecked with gold and jewels. Traffic moved along a well laid-out system of boulevards, roads, intersections, and marketplaces, and many assembly houses and temples of demigods graced the charming city. The roads, courtyards, commercial streets, and residential patios were all sprinkled with water and shaded from the sun’s heat by banners waving from flagpoles. In the city of Dvaraka was a beautiful private quarter worshiped by the planetary rulers. This district, where the demigod Vishvakarma had shown all his divine skill, was the residential area of Lord Hari Krishna, and thus it was gorgeously decorated by the sixteen thousand palaces of Lord Krishna’s queens. Narada Muni entered one of these immense palaces. Supporting the palace were coral pillars decoratively inlaid with vaidurya gems. Sapphires bedecked the walls, and the floors glowed with perpetual brilliance. In that palace Tvashta had arranged canopies with hanging strands of pearls; there were also seats and beds fashioned of ivory and precious jewels. In attendance were many well- dressed maidservants bearing lockets on their necks, and also armor-clad guards with turbans, fine uniforms, and jeweled earrings. The glow of numerous jewel-studded lamps dispelled all darkness in the palace. My dear king, on the ornate ridges of the roof danced loudly crying peacocks, who saw the fragrant aguru incense escaping through the holes of the latticed windows and mistook it for a cloud. = Events = * Pandu's sons lived in Dwaraka during their exile to woods. Their servants headed by Indrasena lived there for one year (the 13th year) (4,72). * Bala Rama mentioned about a sacrificial fire of Dwaraka, before he set for his pilgrimage over Sarasvati River (9,35). * One should proceed with subdued senses and regulated diet to Dwaravati, where by bathing in \\"the holy place called Pindaraka\\",Srimad Bhagavatam 11.1.12 (Text ); Pindaraka entry on Encyclopedia Indica one obtaineth the fruit of the gift of gold in abundance (3,82). * King Nriga, in consequence of a single fault of his, had to dwell for a long time at Dwaravati, and Krishna became the cause of his rescue from that miserable plight.(13,72). * Sage Durvasa resided at Dwaravati for a long time (13,160). * Arjuna visited Dwaravati during his military campaign after the Kurukshetra War (14,83). * When the Pandavas retire from the world they visit the place where Dvaraka once used to be and see the city submerged under water.  Archaeological findings  During 1983-1990, the Marine Archaeology Unit of India's National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) carried out underwater excavations at Dwarka and Bet Dwarka. According to S. R. Rao \\"The available archaeological evidence from onshore and offshore excavations confirms the existence of a city-state with a couple of satellite towns in 1500 B.C.\\" He considered it reasonable to conclude that this submerged city is the Dvaraka as described in the Mahabharata.

Early life He was born in San Antonio de Béxar (now San Antonio, Texas, United States). He married María Luisa Cásares by 1846 and had at least two children. The son of a military officer, Vicente Tarín and his wife, Juana Isidora Leal, he was grandson of rancher Joaquin Leal and great- great-grandson of Juan Leal, first alcalde (mayor) of San Antonio. Tarín was baptized at the San Antonio de Valero Mission (\\"the Alamo\\") two days after his birth. In 1813, there was much political turmoil in the region. His father, a Spanish officer, joined the invasion forces of the Gutiérrez-Magee Expedition. After the defeat at the battle of Medina, he fled the Spanish repercussions. He went into exile in the Louisiana territory leaving Manuel and his mother in the care of a Catholic priest. Though his father was given a conditional pardon in 1814, he refused it and chose to remain in exile, continuing in the rebellion against the Spanish crown. By 1830, Manuel Tarín became a soldier in the Second Flying Company of San Carlos de Parras (Álamo de Parras), serving first at the Alamo and then Fort Tenoxtitlán. The Mexican government's failed support of its frontier outposts forced its men and their families to suffer under the harshest of conditions. Tarín deserted twice, but was returned to duty both times. His unit ultimately returned to San Antonio and the Alamo. Texas Revolution Tarín was largely dissatisfied with the Mexican army as was demonstrated when he was apprehended with his own brother, José Vicente and other accomplices after trying to steal guns and ammunition from the Alamo stores. By 1835, he deserted the Mexican army and enlisted in the Texas army. On February 22, 1836, Tarin mustered into Juan N. Seguín's company of Tejanos.Barr (1990), p. 18.

Established in 1957 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education and Training, the school has a non-selective enrolment policy and currently caters for approximately 1,260 students from Years 7 to 12. In the 2006 Higher School Certificate, the National Education Directory of Australia named Cheltenham Girls High School the sixth best performing school, and the best non-selective public school in Sydney's Hornsby region. The school is well-known for its distinctive pink uniform and has recently celebrated their 60th anniversary. History Cheltenham Girls High School was founded in 1957-1958 by Bessie Mitchell who also acted as the first Principal. The School is located on the former residential estate of the Vicars family, who had donated the land for the only purpose of building a school. A leadlight window from the original house is now situated in the administration foyer, as well as a larger window of a ship being located in the E block. The ship is used in the header of the school newsletter, Yarrabee Cheltenham Girls High school, Quadrangle The first students of the school were accommodated at Epping Boys' High School buildings during 1957, as the school was still in the process of being built. The Epping boys playground was separated, one side for the girls, one for the boys. The boys were caned if they were seen in the girl's playground. These students finally moved to new buildings on the Cheltenham site in 1958 and comprised four classes of second-year students and 10 classes of first-year students. A common myth associated with the school is that the colour of the uniform comes from a bequest, the terms of which stated that the uniform must be pink. In fact, it was not Bessie Mitchell as some think, who decided the uniforms should be pink dresses; it was the Vicars family who previously owned the land. These dresses are still worn today and are noted throughout the area. One highlight of the Cheltenham school year is the annual Presentation Day, which is held at the Sydney Opera House each year. The majority of students, staff and parents travel to Circular Quay station in a special train reserved for this occasion (the \\"Cheltenham Express\\"). Curriculum Cheltenham Girls' High School is registered and accredited with the New South Wales Board of Studies, and therefore follows the mandated curriculum for all years. The school provides two years of compulsory subjects (Years 7-8); two years of compulsory subjects, plus three elective subjects for the School Certificate (Years 9-10); and two years preparing for the Higher School Certificate (HSC) (Years 11-12). In Years 11 and 12, a minimum of 12 units Preliminary and 10 units HSC must be studied, with English the only mandatory subject. The school also offers two accelerated course for selected students, the subject are IPT, and Aboriginal Studies. Additional courses are also available through TAFE NSW, the Open High School, Saturday School of Community Languages and other providers. The school is a comprehensive high school, and typically performs well in the HSC, outperforming some public selective schools. In the 2006 HSC, the National Education Directory of Australia named Cheltenham Girls the sixth best performing school, and the best non-selective public school in Sydney's Hornsby region. House system Students are divided alphabetically into six house groups. School carnivals in swimming athletics and cross country are organised on a house basis. There are also sport prefects mostly from the senior years, but a few from the juniors in each sport house that lead the houses into house and school spirit chants and organise house meetings and do various jobs. The houses are: *Bookoola (light blue) — \\"wise owl\\" *Mirrabooka (dark blue) — \\"Southern Cross\\" *Coolaroo (yellow) — \\"Stars\\" *Petarli (white and black) — \\"The Moon\\" *Dulkara (red) — \\"Rainbow\\" *Wirreanda (green) — \\"Tall Trees\\" Student Leadership School prefects are elected from year 11 by staff and peers in years 10 to 12 in June each year. The captain, vice-captain and senior prefect are elected by the prefects. Transport prefects are elected from year 11 and support the safety, welfare and conduct of each student as she travels to and from school. Transport prefects report misbehavior, problems etc. to the head welfare teacher. The SRC is a representative body comprising students from each year 7 through 12. Years 8 to 11 elect their six representatives from a whole year. Each year 7 class elects its own representative and if there happens to be a tie between two people, both of them become a member of the SRC. Elections are held in the first semester(late in Term 1 or early in Term 2). The SRC organises many events, sometimes along with other non-elected student body groups. Organisations * P & C Association: Cheltenham's Parents and Citizens' Association takes an interest in the welfare and education of its students.

El asesor espiritual del general Ramón Camps]. ) is an Argentine Roman Catholic priest and a former chaplain of the Buenos Aires Province Police while it was under the command of General Ramón Camps, during the dictatorial period known as the National Reorganization Process (El proceso) (1976–1983). Wernich worked in Miguel Etchecolatz's Direction of Investigations of the provincial police with the rank of Inspector. He became internationally known in 2006 after being indicted for murder and kidnapping in aid of the military junta; he was convicted at trial in October 2007 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Early life and education Christian Federico von Wernich was born in 1938 into an ethnic German Catholic family. He attended parochial school and seminary. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1960. Career He became a chaplain of the Buenos Aires Province Police in the 1970s. The force was commanded by General Ramón Camps. This was during the military dictatorship known as National Reorganization Process (El proceso) (1976–1983), when the military and security forces took extreme actions to suppress political dissent in the country. The period became known as the Dirty War, and the government was later held responsible for tens of thousands of forced disappearances, kidnappings, torture, and deaths of political prisoners, in addition to widespread attacks of rural insurgents, which was later assessed as genocide. Going beyond acting as a spiritual adviser to police and suspects, Wernich worked with the rank of Inspector in Miguel Etchecolatz's Direction of Investigations of the provincial police. Two years after the return of democracy in 1983, the government began to prosecute crimes under the dictatorship, in what was known as the Trial of the Juntas in 1985. Wernich was among those accused of participation in the Dirty War, and collaborating in the torture of political prisoners. He declared that he was innocent.Nuncamas.org. Testimony of Cristian Federico von Wernich , Trial of the Juntas (8 May 1985). Action against those involved in the military dictatorship was discontinued after Congress passed the 1986 Ley de Punto Final, intended to \\"draw a line\\" under all that had happened until then. The country struggled to restore democratic institutions and rule of law. In 1991, President Carlos Saúl Menem pardoned Ramón Camps and other high-ranking leaders who had been convicted in the 1985 trial, setting off waves of protest. In 2003 Congress repealed the 1986 Ley de Punto Final. (In a court challenge, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that the law was unconstitutional.) In 2003 the government re-opened prosecution of cases of crimes against humanity committed during the Dirty War. La Plata Federal Judge Arnaldo Corazza gathered testimony from witnesses who placed von Wernich at three illegal detention centers (Puesto Vasco, Coti Martínez and Pozo de Quilmes). He ordered the priest's arrest on 25 September 2003, after Wernich was discovered hiding in the Chilean seaside town of El Quisco under the assumed name of \\"Christian González\\". He was working as a priest, having returned to Argentina after earlier escaping to Chile.Alexei Barrionuevo, \\"Argentine priest testifies about church's role in 'dirty war'\\", New York Times, 17 September 2007 On 7 March 2006, the Federal Court of La Plata confirmed the indictment and detention of Wernich on charges of co-authorship of homicide, illegal restraints, and acts of torture (including that used against the kidnapped Jacobo Timerman, the editor of La Opinión). Surviving victims declared that Wernich had questioned them under torture, subjected them to mock executions, and, under the guise of counseling, urged them to confess.\\"Argentine priest arraigned for human rights abuses\\" , The Catholic Voice (Oakland), 9 January 2006\\"Von Wernich seguirá en prisión y será sometido a juicio oral\\" , La Capital (Rosario), 8 March 2006. Some of his accusers alleged Wernich violated the sacraments of the church by breaking the seal of the confessional, a charge he has denied. Wernich's trial began on 5 July 2007 in La Plata, the capital of the province of Buenos Aires. He was accused of seven homicides and 41 instances of kidnapping and torture. The tribunal was composed of judges Carlos Rozanski, Norberto Lorenzo and Horacio Insaurralde, the same panel which had convicted and sentenced Miguel Etchecolatz in 2006. Before the trial, Wernich denied all charges, saying that while he did visit detention centers, he did not witness any human rights abuses there; however, on the first day of the trial, he exercised his right to silence.\\"Empieza el juicio al ex capellán Wernich\\", La Nación, 5 July 2007 \\"Un cura que bendijo la represión\\", Página/12, 5 July 2007 His accusers thought this was a sign that he did not want to practice self-incrimination by having to account for his crimes.

Wernich's trial was thought to have revealed \\"the church's dark past during the dirty war, when it sometimes gave its support to the military's persecution of leftist opponents. That past stands in stark contrast to the role the church played during the dictatorships in Chile and Brazil, where priests and bishops publicly condemned the governments and worked to save those being persecuted from torture and death.\\" During the trial, the Church was officially silent, although the Reverend Rubén Capitanio was called as a witness and was required to testify during the trial. He condemned the Roman Catholic Church's \\"complicity\\" in atrocities during the Dirty War. He said, \\"There are some that think that this trial is an attack on the church, and I want to say that this is a service to the church. This is helping us search for the truth.\\" On Wernich's conviction, his superior, Bishop Martín Elizalde, apologised for Wernich being \\"so far from the requirements of the mission commended to him.\\" When in 2010 it was reported that Wernich was still being permitted to officiate as a priest at Mass in prison, the bishop said that \\"at the appropriate time von Wernich's situation will have to be resolved in accordance with canonical law.\\"[Sebastián Lacunza: \\"Torture Priest Still Celebrating Mass – Behind Bars\\", Inter Press Service, 7 February 2010 See also * Dirty War * Forced disappearance * Religion in Argentina * Miguel Etchecolatz * Pope Francis References External links * Information on von Wernich's trial provided by APDH La Plata * A site supporting von Wernich as \\"a prisoner of war and political prisoner\\" * 1938 births Living people Argentine people of German descent Operatives of the Dirty War Human rights abuses Argentine Roman Catholic priests Argentine prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Argentina Place of birth missing (living people) Members of the clergy convicted of murder Catholic priests convicted of murder 20th-century Roman Catholic priests 21st-century Roman Catholic priests Police misconduct in Argentina People convicted of kidnapping ","title":"Christian von Wernich"},{"id":"4318478","text":"John Macgregor (1802–1858) was a Scottish shipbuilder. Birth and early life John Macgregor was christened on 24 August 1802 at Fintry, Stirlingshire. He was the third son of Annie McNicol and James Macgregor, a clockmaker. He also had one elder sister, two younger sisters, and two younger brothers. His father qualified as a clockmaker and he moved through Balfron, Fintry, and Comrie with his family working all the time as an engineer in the cotton mills that were developing in these parts of the Highlands.http://www.gregormacgregor.com/MacGregor/John1802.htm The family were incomers to Fintry, having moved from Balfron. They remained there for about 14 years, before moving on to Comrie in Perthshire, where the last two of their eight children were born. The stay in Comrie must have been short, although Macgregor received a rudimentary education there. When Macgregor was 16, the family moved to Glasgow. Macgregor began his apprenticeship as an engineer under David Napier at Camlachie. He went to Lancefield Foundry with the others in 1821 and was a sea-going engineer on the Belfast which had Napier machinery while still in his early 20s. The Belfast plied between Liverpool and Dublin, and was one of the earliest steamers to cross the Irish Sea. At David Napier’s he made the acquaintance of David Tod. Together, they ran the engineering department for a while and gained considerable managerial experience during this period. They probably also acted as guarantee engineers from time to time. Tod and Macgregor In 1833, Macgregor and David Tod formed a partnership to build steam engines. The partnership, Tod and Macgregor, was initially based at Carrick Street, Glasgow in 1834. The business grew quickly and moved to larger premises in Worroch Street, where they added boiler making to their engineering activities. Towards the end of 1836, Tod and Macgregor opened a shipbuilding yard on the south bank of the River Clyde at Mavisbank. Finally, in 1845, the firm moved to a new purpose built yard at Meadowside in the Borough of Partick. Tod and Macgregor were described as \\"the fathers of iron shipbuilding on the Clyde\\", building famous ships such as the City of Glasgow and the City of Paris. In about 1830, he is assumed to have married Margaret Fleming (born 23 March 1809), the daughter of Margaret Biggar and James Fleming. Together they had seven children, of whom three daughters and two sons survived. In 1834, Macgregor was to be found at 90 Carrick Street, and by 1841 had moved to Clydebank with Margaret and the family, who were found there at the time of the 1841 census. In 1845, he gave his address as Rutland Place, which may have been the same as Clydebank. The family must have moved as the shipyard went to Meadowside in 1846 as he was registered as living at Meadowside House, Partick in 1848. On 18 September 1848 his wife Margaret Fleming died at the age of 39, the cause of her death is not known. On 9 March 1851 he married Margaret York (born 20 April 1823), the daughter of Janet Masterton and William York, at Barony, Glasgow. Together they had two children, William York Macgregor (born Finnart House, Loch Long, Dunbartonshire, 14 October 1855; died Oban, 28 September 1923) and Peter Macgregor (born 21 February 1857 at Partick; died Hove, Sussex 22 April 1901). At the time of the 1851 census, Margaret York, and the children from Macgregor's first marriage, were found at Meadowside House in Partick. In around 1874, after the deaths of both David Tod and John Macgregor, the shipbuilding business was sold and renamed as D. and W. Henderson and Company. Death and obituaries The grave of John Macgregor, Glasgow Necropolis Macgregor died on 16 September 1858 from constipation, a treatable problem today. He is buried in the north-east section of the upper plateau at Glasgow Necropolis. When his funeral cortege took place, beginning at North Street, Anderston, the shops in Partick were closed, the route was lined with thousands of spectators with 'grieved countenances', the bells of the city churches were tolled from 2- to 3 o'clock’, and the flags in the harbour and on the shipping were at half-mast. His obituary states: \\"At the comparatively early age of 57, in the full flush and vigour of his mature manhood, after an illness of only three days, of constipation of the bowels, Mr Macgregor departed this life, at half past eleven o'clock on Thursday night, at his town residence, Meadowside House, Partick.

Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.87. In the Vishnu Purana (IV.11), all the five Haihaya clans are mentioned together as the Talajanghas.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.102. The five Haihaya clans were Vitihotra, Sharyata, Bhoja, Avanti and Tundikera. The Haihayas were native to the present-day Malwa region of Western Madhya Pradesh). The Puranas style the Haihayas as the first ruling dynasty of Avanti.Raychaudhuri, H.C. (1972) Political History of Ancient India, Calcutta: University of Calcutta, pp.130-1. Foundation of Mahishmati In the Harivamsha (33.1847), the honour of founding their future capital city of Mahishmati (in present-day Madhya Pradesh) was king Mahishmant, son of Sahanja and a descendant of Yadu through Haihaya. At another place, it names Muchukunda, one of the ancestor of lord Rama as the founder of Mahishmati. It states that he built the cities of Mahishmati and Purika in the Rksha mountains. According to the Padma Purana (VI.115), the city was actually founded by a certain MahishaPargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, pp.263,263fn3. Arjuna Kartavirya and his successors According to the Mahabharata and the Puranas, the most celebrated Haihaya king was Arjuna Kartavirya.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.265-7 His epithet was Sahasrabahu. He was called a Samrat and Chakravartin. His name is found in the Rig Veda (VIII.45.26).Misra, V.S. (2007). Ancient Indian Dynasties, Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, , pp.157-8 He ultimately conquered Mahishmati city from Karkotaka Naga, a Naga chief and made it his fortress-capital. According to the Vayu Purana, he invaded Lanka and took Ravana prisoner. Arjuna propitiated Dattatreya and was favoured by him.Pargiter, F.E. (1972) [1922]. Ancient Indian Historical Tradition, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.229. Arjuna's sons killed sage Jamadagni. Jamadagni's son Parashurama in revenge killed Arjuna. Arjuna had a number of sons. His son Jayadhvaja succeeded him to the throne. Jayadhvaja was succeeded by his son Talajangha. Arjuna Kartavirya, humbling Ravana, a painting by Fazl, 1597-1605 The Vitihotras Later, the Haihayas were mostly known by the name of the dominant clan amongst them - the Vitihotras (or Vitahotras or Vitahvyas). According to the Puranas, Vitihotra was the great-grandson of Arjuna Kartavirya and the eldest son of Talajangha. The Puranas also mention the names of two Vitihotra rulers: Ananta, son of Vitihotra and Durjaya Amitrakarshana, son of Ananta The northward expansion of the Haihaya territory to the mid-Ganges valley by the Vitihotra rulers was stopped by the Ikshvaku king Sagara.Thapar, Romila (1996). Ancient Indian Social History Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , p.299 The Mahagovindasuttanta of the Dighanikaya mentions about an Avanti king Vessabhu (Vishvabhu) and his capital Mahissati (Mahishmati). Probably he was a Vitihotra ruler. The ISBN printed in the book (0-8426-909-1) is invalid, causing a checksum error. Probably, during the rule of the later Vitihotras, the whole Avanti region developed into two realms, divided by the Vindhyas, having principal cities at Mahishmati and Ujjayini (present day Ujjain). According to the Matsya Purana (5.37), Pulika, one of the ministers of Ripunjaya, the last Vitihotra king of Ujjayini killed his master and made his son Pradyota new king.Raizada, Ajit (1992). Ujjayini (in Hindi), Bhopal: Directorate of Archaeology & Museums, Government of Madhya Pradesh, p.21 It is said that many of the Haihayas were learned in the Vedas.Sarmah, Thaneswar The Bharadvajas in Ancient India, p.69  Medieval Haihayas  A number of early medieval dynasties, which include the Kalachuris, Kansaras, Thatheras, Tamrakars and the Mushakavamsha Mushika Kingdom of Kerala, claimed their descent from the Haihayas.Thapar, Romila (1996). Ancient Indian Social History Some Interpretations, New Delhi: Orient Longman, , p.282 The Haihayas of eastern India fought against Islamists invaders in medieval times.Rajaguru, Satyanarayan. History of the Gaṅgas, p.59 References in Mahabharata =Disputes with the Ikswaku Kings= Sagara was a king of Kosala Kingdom, ruling from Ayodhya. He was of the lineage of Ikshwaku, a famous royal dynasty in ancient India. Sagara is mentioned as the son of Jadu (MBh 12,56). His army numbered 60,000 men, all of whom he treated as sons. The Ikswaku king Sagara is said to have defeated the Haihayas and the Talajanghas. He brought under subjection the whole of the military caste. (MBh 3,106) =The Haihayas and Talajanghas of Vatsa Kingdom= :(MBh 13,30) Haihayas and Talajanghas probably had their origins in Vatsa Kingdom. Haihayas in the Vatsa kingdom, known collectively as Vitahavyas and under King Vitahavya, attacked the neighbouring country called Kasi, during the reign of four successive generations of Kasi kings viz that of Haryaswa, Sudeva, Divodasa and Pratarddana. The last one among them, Pratarddana, defeated the Haihayas and probably expelled them from the Vatsa kingdom. Kasi kings were also born in the race of Ikshwaku. This could be the seed of Haihayas's dispute with them. Under Haryaswa's reign In Saryati’s lineage (Saryati and Ikshwaku were two among the many sons of Manu (MBh 1,75)), two kings took their birth, viz. Haihaya and Talajangha, both sons of Vatsa. Haihaya had ten wives and a hundred sons, all of whom were highly inclined to fighting. In Kasi also there was a king, the grandfather of Divodasa, known as Haryyaswa. The sons of King Haihaya, who was otherwise known as Vitahavyas, invaded the kingdom of Kasi. Advancing into that country that lies between the rivers Ganges and Yamuna, he fought a battle with King Haryyaswa, slaying him there. The sons of Haihaya fearlessly went back to their own delightful city in the country of the Vatsas. Under Sudeva Meanwhile, Haryyaswa’s son Sudeva was installed on the throne of Kasi as its new ruler. That righteous- souled prince ruled his kingdom for some time before the hundred sons of Vitahavya once more invaded his dominions and defeated him in battle. Having vanquished King Sudeva thus, the Haihaya victors returned to their own city. Under Divodasa After that Divodasa, the son of Sudeva, was next installed on the throne of Kasi. Realising the prowess of those high-souled princes, the sons of Vitahavya, King Divodasa, endued with great energy, rebuilt and fortified the city of Baranasi (Varanasi or Banaras) at Indra's command. They teemed with articles and provisions of every kind and were adorned with shops and marts swelling with prosperity. Those territories stretched northwards from the banks of Ganges to the southern banks of Gomati, and resembled a second Amravati (the city of Indra). The Haihayas once again attacked. The mighty King Divodasa, issuing from his capital, gave them battle. King Divodasa fought the enemy for a thousand days but at the end, having lost a number of followers and animals, he became exceedingly distressed. King Divodasa, his army lost and his treasury exhausted, left his capital and fled. He sought protection of his priest, Bharadwaja, the son of Vrihaspati. Divodasa's son Pratarddana retaliates Divodasa wished for a brave son who could avenge the Vitahavyas. With his priest Bharadwaja's, blessings he obtained a son named Pratarddana, would become well skilled in battle. Divodasa installed his son on the throne of Kasi and asked him to march against the sons of Vitahavya. He speedily crossed the Ganges on his car followed by his army and proceeded against the city of the Vitahavyas. The Vitahavyas issued out of their city in their cars and poured out on Pratarddana, showered of weapons of various kinds. Pratarddana slew them all in battle. The Haihaya king Vitahavya then, all his sons and kinsmen dead, sought protection of his priest Bhrigu. Bhrigu converted him a Brahmana. Sage Saunaka, later receiver of the entire Mahabharata narrative from Ugrasrava Sauti, was born from the line of this Vitahavya. =Haihaya King Kartavirya Arjuna= Kartavirya Arjuna (Sahastrabahu Arjun or Sahastrarjun) is described as a noble king and a devotee of Lord Dattatreya. Endowed with a thousand arms (thought to symbolise a thousand attendants acting as his hands, executing his commands) and great beauty the mighty Kartavirya, in days of yore, became the lord of all the world. He had his capital in the city of Mahishmati. Of impossible prowess, that chief of the Haihaya race of yadav Kshatriyas swayed the whole earth with her belt of seas, together with all her islands and all her precious mines of gold and gems. Keeping before him the duties of the Kshatriya order, as also humility and Vedic knowledge, the king made large gifts of wealth unto the Lord Dattatreya (MBh 13,152). =Other Haihaya Kings= *King Vitahavya is mentioned as the son of Vatsa (MBh 13,30) *King Udvarta became the exterminator of his own race (MBh 5,74) *The conversation between a Haihaya king and a sage named Tarkshya is mentioned at MBh 3,183 *As a royal sage of the Haihaya, Sumitra by name is mentioned by name at MBh 12,124. Sumitra is mentioned as the son of Mitra at MBh 12,125. =Enmity with the Bhargavas= The Haihaya tribe's dispute with Bhargava Brahmins is mentioned at various places in the Mahabharata. The leader of the Bhargavas, Parasurama, son of Jamadagni, is said to kill the Haihaya king Kartavirya Arjuna. The dispute didn't end there. The Bhargavas went all over India and slew numerous Kshatriya kings, most of them kinsmen of Kartavirya Arjuna. (MBh 1,104) In acquiring the unrivaled \\"battleaxe of fiery splendour and irresistible sharpness\\" from Mahadeva of the Gandhamadana mountains, in the Himalayas (MBh 12,49), Bhargava Rama became an unparalleled force on earth. Meanwhile, the mighty son of Kritavirya, Arjuna of the Kshatriya order and ruler of the Haihayas, imbued with great energy, highly virtuous in behaviour, and possessing a thousand arms through the grace of the great sage Dattatreya, and having subjugated in battle by the might of his own arms the whole earth with her mountains and seven islands, became a very powerful emperor.(12,49) The King Arjuna, mighty lord of the Haihaya tribe, would be killed by Rama. (MBh 3,115) Signs of a tribal war \\"Even though only the leaders Bhargava Rama and Kartavirya Arjuna are mentioned in most places, there is evidence that many people were involved in this dispute. It could be a dispute between two tribes, spanning generations.\\" Once upon a time the Brahmins, raising a standard of Kusa grass, encountered in battle the Kshatriyas of the Haihaya clan imbued with immeasurable energy. The best of Brahmins inquired of the Kshatriyas themselves as to the cause of this. The Kshatriyas told them, \\"In battle we obey the orders of one person imbued with great intelligence, while you are disunited from one another and act according to your individual understanding.\\" The Brahmins then appointed one amongst themselves as their commander, who was brave and conversant with the ways of policy. And they then succeeded in vanquishing Haihaya the Kshatriyas. (MBh 5,157) Summary of the dispute Bhargava Rama, having his father Jamadagni slain and his calf stolen by the Kshatriyas, slew Kartaviryas who had never been vanquished before by foes. > With his bow he slew 64 times 10,000 Kshatriyas. In that slaughter were > included 14,000 Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country. Of the > Haihayas, he slew a 1000 with his short club, a 1000 with his sword, and a > 1000 by hanging. Rama slew 10,000 Kshatriyas with his axe. He could not > quietly bear the furious speeches uttered by those foes of his. And when > many foremost of Brahmans uttered exclamations, mentioning the name of Rama > of Bhrigu’s race, he proceeding against the Kashmiras, the Daradas, the > Kuntis, the Kshudrakas, the Malavas, the Angas, the Vangas, the Kalingas, > the Videhas, the Tamraliptakas, the Rakshovahas, the Vitahotras, the > Trigartas, the Martikavatas, counting by thousand, slew them all by means of > his whetted shafts. Proceeding from province to province, he thus slew > thousands of scores of Haihaya-Kshatriyas. Creating a deluge of blood and > filling many lakes also with blood and bringing all the 18 islands under his > subjection, he performed a 100 sacrifices.

For CAE, tactical media is situational, ephemeral, and self-terminating. It encourages the use of any media that will engage a particular socio-political context in order to create molecular interventions and semiotic shocks that collectively could diminish the rising intensity of authoritarian culture. Since its formation in 1987 in Tallahassee, Florida, CAE has been frequently invited to exhibit and perform projects examining issues surrounding information, communications and bio- technologies by museums and other cultural institutions. These include the Whitney Museum and the New Museum in NYC; the Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; the ICA, London; the MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the London Museum of Natural History; Kunsthalle Luzern, and dOCUMENTA 13. The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its work has been covered by art journals, including Artforum, Kunstforum, and The Drama Review. Critical Art Ensemble is the recipient of awards, including the 2007 Andy Warhol Foundation Wynn Kramarsky Freedom of Artistic Expression Grant, the 2004 John Lansdown Award for Multimedia, and the 2004 Leonardo New Horizons Award for Innovation. History =1986–1990= Formed in 1987, CAE's focus has been on the exploration of the intersections between art, critical theory, technology, and political activism. In 1986, Steve Kurtz and Steve Barnes began a collaboration to make low-tech videos with students. They credited each person who contributed to the productions under the signature of Critical Art Ensemble. During the summer of 1987, the group transformed into a broad- based artist and activist collective with six core members: Steve Kurtz, Steve Barnes, Dorian Burr, Beverly Schlee, Ricardo Dominguez (professor) and Hope Kurtz. In 1987, the group's first multimedia exhibitions were held at Club Nu in Miami and Pappy's Lounge in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1988, the group's first events are produced: Political Art In Florida? in collaboration with Group Material, and Frontier Production in collaboration with Thomas Lawson. In 1988-89, CAE begin to release their books of plagiarist text poetry (of which there are six in all). In 1989, the group collaborate with Gran Fury to release Cultural Vaccines, a multimedia event in Tallahassee, Florida, which critiques U.S. policy on HIV. In 1990, the group collaborated with Prostitutes of New York to create Peep Show which premiered at Window on Gaines in Tallahassee, Florida. =1991–1995= In 1991, a body of work titled Fiesta Critica was developed in Indiantown, Florida, with local migrant workers; addressing Floridian agricultural labour relations. CAE produces an Easter fiesta platform to show the works. In 1992, the group produces Exit Culture as a series of works developed for Highway Culture. They also propose The Electronic Disturbance to Autonomedia publishers. In 1993, the group is invited to perform their first appearance in Europe at the Audio/Visual Experimental festival in the Netherlands. They complete the associational documentary series Apocalypse and Utopia. In 1994, Autonomedia publishes The Electronic Disturbance and construction begins to create CAE's website Critical Art Ensemble. CAE projects begin to appear in both real and virtual forms as the Useless Technology project is performed as street action and launched online. The concept of electronic civil disobedience is introduced at the Terminal Futures conference in London. In 1995, the concept of the data body is introduced in lectures at the Ars Electronica. The group tours around Europe with the performance of Body Count. =1996–2000= In 1996, Autonomedia publishes Electronic Civil Disobedience (the companion text to The Electronic Disturbance), and research begins for the book Flesh Machine. In 1997, the group tours Flesh Frontiers and Shareholder's Briefing. Castelvecchi publishes the Italian translation of The Electronic Disturbance. The group goes to Documenta X in Kassel, Germany to begin the editing and conceptualizing process for the book README: Ascii Culture and the Revenge of Knowledge at Hybrid Workspace. The performance of Flesh Machine is toured, premiering in Vienna and closing in Helsinki at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in summer 1998. L'Eclat publishes the French anthology of CAE's writings titled La Resistance Electronique. In 1998, Autonomedia publishes Flesh Machine and the German translation is published by Passagen. The group's street action occurs in Sheffield, UK, with the performance of The International Campaign for Free Alcohol and Tobacco for the Unemployed. Castelvecchi publishes the Italian translation of Electronic Civil Disobedience. In 1999, The Society for Reproductive Anachronisms is premiered at Rutgers University in the student cafeteria. Work begins on Cult of the New Eve (CoNE) and is premiered at St. Clara Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. A new book project is begun, entitled Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media. In 2000, Autonomedia publishes Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media and the German anthology of CAE's writings on electronic media is published by Passagen.Critical Art Ensemble, 'Timeline', pp. 132-135. The group has exhibited and performed at diverse venues internationally, ranging from the street, to the museum, to the internet. Museum exhibitions include the Whitney Museum and The New Museum in NYC; The Corcoran Museum in Washington D.C.; The ICA, London; The MCA, Chicago; Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt; Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; and The London Museum of Natural History. Critical Art Ensemble =2003–2004= Free Range Grain was a performance-based project which tested foods to contest the global food trade system. The project used basic molecular biology techniques over a 72-hour period to test foods that others deemed suspicious of \\"contamination\\" even when the authorities were guarding against them. This performance sought to explore biotechnology and the science behind it, as the artists felt it was \\"one of the most misunderstood areas of production in the cultural landscape\\". Works and artistic approach =Performance style= In its performances, CAE creates various performative identities, such as that of a group of scientists or a corporation. Instead of using fancy, high-tech machinery they use 'high school lab equipment as well as common household supplies and groceries',Sholette 2005, p.51. which brings the scientific difficulty down to a level at which the public can understand and engage with because the worlds of science and technology in the modern world are 'increasingly privatised'.Sholette 2005, p.51. This playful style, however, contrasts with the groups numerous books and manifestos which have an analytical focus.Sholette 2005, p.51. Nicola Triscott is the founder of The Arts Catalyst. In her writings about the CAE, she states that their participatory theatre 'aims to involve the public in the processes of biotechnology in order to contribute to the development of an informed and critical public discourse on contemporary bioscience'.Triscott 2009, p.151. This provides people with knowledge of how science can be interesting and that it can be misused if in the wrong hands. Their works have ranged from genetically modified food, the Human Genome Project (CoNE), reproductive technologies, genetic screening and transgenics. The way they approach this style is through directly engaging with the science and presenting techniques generally unknown to the public in a performative way.Triscott 2009, p.151. :The work of the CAE continues to entertain, inform and show the public how biotechnology can be demonstrated via performance.Sholette 2005, p.51. :As part of their critical objectives, they target their attention on private corporations unknown in the public sector who misuse biotechnology. This tactical response is what the CAE have termed 'Fuzzy Biological Sabotage' (or FBS if abbreviated).Sholette 2005, p.52. :Using harmless biological species including plants, insects and reptiles, they make sophisticated pranks 'to operate in the grey, in-between spaces as yet unregulated by institutional regimes'Sholette 2005, p. 52. cited in Molecular Invasion =Publications= The collective has written 7 books, and its writings have been translated into 18 languages. Its books include: The Electronic Disturbance (1994), Electronic Civil Disobedience & Other Unpopular Ideas (1996), Flesh Machine: Cyborgs, Designer Babies, & New Eugenic Consciousness (1998), Digital Resistance: Explorations in Tactical Media (2001), Molecular Invasion (2002), Marching Plague (2006), and the project book Disturbances (2012). CAE is noted for having written the article Nomadic Power and Cultural Resistance, in which CAE argues that with the creation of the internet the power of the elite has become mobile to the extent that it is difficult for a dissident to directly confront the authority, comparing the untrackable, elusive mobility to that of the Scythians.The Electronic Disturbance, 11-30. New York: Autonomoedia, 1994. They demolished the idea that power cannot corrupt and co-opt network and hypertext technologies, that such technologies have a predetermined and manifest destiny of freedom.The New Media Reader. New York: The MIT, 2003 CAE goes on to observe that occupation theory itself is challenged by cyberspace and the difficulties it presents in terms of focusing a group effort against one authority as opposed to a singular hacker, fiddling with code. An important distinction is made that when rebellious acts are carried out by an individual as opposed to a group in singularity, that the dissenter is seen as a vandal instead of a protester. The article mentions that resistance in the form posters, pamphleteering, street theater and public art have been useful in the past but now that the public is electronically engaged one must bring their resistance methods online. =Molecular Invasion= In correlation to CAE's work \\"Molecular Invasion (2002)\\" the collective hosted an exhibit about genetically modified crops. They planted Monsanto's genetically modified seeds that were designed to be immune to Monsanto's commercial pesticide roundup (Glyphosate). They successfully grew these crops in their exhibit however once the plants were fully grown they applied an enzyme inhibitor that was reverse engineered to the plants that eradicated the protection that these crops had against the pesticide. The plants quickly died. This exhibit was a statement against genetically modified foods. =Cult of the New Eve= In 1999, CAE began a new project to draw attention to the ways in which scientific discourses surrounding biotechnologies drew upon promissory religious rhetoric. This participatory performance was titled Cult of the New Eve (or CoNE when abbreviated) and included a \\"communion\\" using a random library of the entire genome of the first female donor to the Human Genome Project taken from a blood sample. CAE spliced the genome and inserted it into yeast, which was then placed into host wafers and beer given to audience members who were willing to participate. The genome from the donor is intended to represent a 'New Eve… a sacrosant Messiah'.Critical Art Ensemble 2000, pp.167-173 The project also offers public and online preaching, baptisms, communion, sacred theological and cosmological texts and prophecies.Critical Art Ensemble, 'Performing a Cult', pp.167-173 =GenTerra= CAE created a performance titled GenTerra which raised issues surrounding ethics and safety in performative science. This was done through an investigation into creating transgenic life forms and seeing the consequences of potentially releasing them into the environment. It was the audience members who had to decide whether the bacteria was harmful or not in a game of 'genetic Russian roulette'.Triscott 2009, p.164 Triscott states through her own experience of participating in the performance that members of the audience were given the opportunity to grow and store their own bacteria, with full instructions and guidance. With the aid of a spinning machine, bacteria were spun with only one of ten chambers holding active bacteria. The purpose of GenTerrra is to 'introduce bioproducts to the audience, and demonstrate the practical applications of such research, such as disease treatment and xenotransplantation'.Triscott 2009, p.164 As CAE wear lab-coats and appear as professional scientists, they simulate actual biotechnology corporations, emphasizing their intentions even further.Triscott 2009 =Collective structure= CAE attributes the collective's longevity to their structure which has contributed to positive attitudes throughout the group. The number of members, ranging from three to eight and known as a 'cellular structure'Critical Art Ensemble 2001, pp.70-73 has managed to be sustained without members feeling alienated. As each member has the opportunity to show off their individual strengths and weaknesses, the risk of conflict and mistrust is reduced. They do not believe in equality; rather that every member has 'a voice in the production process [of a project]; however the member with the greatest expertise in the area has authority over the final product'. =Amateurism= CAE has also stated that amateurs have the ability to see through dominant paradigms, are more free to recombine elements of paradigms thought long dead, and can apply everyday life experience to their deliberations. Most important, however, amateurs are not invested in institutional systems of knowledge production and policy construction, and hence do not have irresistible forces guiding the outcome of their process…'.Sholette 2005, p.52. cited in Critical Art Ensemble 2001, p.9. =Future projects= 'Since 2006, CAE has changed the focus of its work towards a critique of US defense policy, and has moved away from its interrogation of biotechnology'.Triscott 2009, p.166 Controversy =Steve Kurtz's Trial= In 2004, one of its founders, Steve Kurtz, was arrested on suspicion of bioterrorism. On the morning of 11 May 2004, he woke to find that his wife Hope had died in her sleep. He called 911. Police became suspicious after noticing his biology lab which he kept in his own home. They contacted the FBI and Kurtz was detained for 24 hours before being interrogated and his house searched for biohazardous materials. The house was given the all clear, yet a week later, Kurtz's CAE collaborators were ordered to appear before a grand jury to investigate possible violations of the law regarding biological weapons. The jury met in July 2004 and cleared Kurtz of all \\"bioterrorism\\" charges, however the FBI continued to press charges against the artist and the case dragged on for four years.Triscott 2009, p.154. The case was widely covered in the US and international press, and sparked outrage among artists and scientists worldwide. A website was created for people to donate money to help Kurtz pay his mounting legal fees. The case was dismissed in 2008. -- CAE DEFENSE FUND -- According to Nicola Triscott, the FBI 'thought they had a situation out of which they could manufacture a terrorism case, which potentially brought great personal rewards', based upon the 'Lackawanna Six Sleeper Cell' case where six Yemeni Americans were convicted of supporting al- QaedaTriscott 2009, p.165.

Ellalan is traditionally presented as being a just king even by the Sinhalese. The Mahavamsa states that he ruled 'with even justice toward friend and foe, on occasions of disputes at law, and elaborates how he even ordered the execution of his son on the basis of a heinous religious crime. Ellalan is a peculiar figure in the history of Sri Lanka and one with particular resonance given the past ethnic strife in the country. Although he was an invader, he is often regarded as one of Sri Lanka's wisest and most just monarchs, as highlighted in the ancient Sinhalese Pali chronicle, the Mahavamsa. According to the chronicle, even Ellalan's nemesis Dutugamunu had a great respect for him, and ordered a monument be built where Ellalan was cremated after dying in battle. The Dakkhina Stupa was believed to be the tomb of Ellalan. Often referred to as 'the Just King', the Tamil name Ellāḷaṉ means 'the one who rules the boundary\\".  Birth and early life  Ellalan is described in the Mahavamsa as being \\"A Tamila of noble descent . . . from the Chola-country\\"; Little is known of his early life. Around 205 BCE, Ellalan mounted an invasion of the Rajarata based in Anuradhapura in northern Sri Lanka and defeated the forces of king Asela of Anuradhapura, establishing himself as sole ruler of Rajarata. He has been mentioned in the Silappatikaram and Periya Puranam. His name has since then been used as a metaphor for fairness and justice in Tamil literature. His capital was Thiruvarur.  Defeat and death  Despite Ellalan's famously even-handed rule, resistance to him coalesced around the figure of Dutugamunu, a young Sinhalese prince from the kingdom of Mahagama. Towards the end of Ellalan's reign, Dutugamunu had strengthened his position in the south by defeating his own brother, Saddha Tissa, who challenged him. Confrontation between the two monarchs was inevitable and the last years of Ellalan's reign were consumed by the war between the two. Ellalan was near seventy years when the battle with the young Dutugamunu took place. The Mahavamsa contains a fairly detailed account of sieges and battles that took place during the conflict. Particularly interesting is the extensive use of war elephants and of flaming pitch in the battles. Ellalan's own war elephant is said to have been Maha Pabbatha, or 'Big Rock' and the Dutugamunu's own being 'Kandula'. The climactic battle is said to have occurred as Dutugamunu drew close to Anuradhapura. On the night before, both King Ellalan and prince Dutugamunu are said to have conferred with their counsellors. The next day both kings rode forwards on war elephants, Ellalan \\"in full armour . . . with chariots, soldiers and beasts for riders\\". Dutugamunu's forces are said to have routed those of Ellalan and that \\"the water in the tank there was dyed red with the blood of the slain'. Dutugamunu, declaring that 'none shall kill Ellalan but myself', closed on him at the south gate of Anuradhapura, where the two engaged in an elephant-back duel and the aged king was finally felled by one of Dutugamunu's darts. Until 19th century, the Dakkhina Stupa was believed to be the tomb of Ellalan Following his death, Dutugamunu ordered that Ellāḷaṉ be cremated where he had fallen, and had a monument constructed over the place. The Mahavamsa mentions that 'even to this day the princes of Lanka, when they draw near to this place, are wont to silence their music'. The Dakkhina Stupa was until the 19th century believed to have been the tomb of Ellalan and was called Elara Sohona, but was renamed later on by the Sri Lankan Department of Archaeology. The identification and reclassification is considered controversial.Indrapala, K. The Evolution of an ethnic identity: The Tamils of Sri Lanka, p. 368  Influence  The Mahavamsa contains numerous references to the loyal troops of the Chola empire and portrays them as a powerful force. They held various positions including taking custody of temples during the period of Parakramabahu I and Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa.The tooth relic and the crown, page 59Epigraphia Zeylanica: being lithic and other inscriptions of Ceylon, Volume 2, page 250 There were instances when the Sinhalese kings tried to employ them as mercenaries by renaming a section of the most hardcore fighters as Mahatantra. According to historian Burton Stein, when these troops were directed against the Chola empire, they rebelled and were suppressed and decommissioned. But they continued to exist in a passive state by taking up various jobs for livelihood.Journal of Tamil studies, Issues 31-32, page 60 The Valanjayara, a sub-section of the Velaikkara troops, were one such community, who in the course of time became traders. They were so powerful that the shrine of the tooth-relic was entrusted to their care.The Ceylon historical journal, Volumes 1-2, page 197Culavamsa: Being the More Recent Part of Mahavamsa When the Velaikkara troops took custody of the tooth-relic shrine, they renamed it as Mūnrukai-tiruvēlaikkāran daladāy perumpalli.Early South Indian temple architecture: study of Tiruvāliśvaram inscriptions, page 93 There are also multiple epigraphic records of the Velaikkara troops. It is their inscriptions, for example the one in Polunnaruwa, that are actually used to fix the length of the reign of Sinhalese kings; in this case, Vijayabahu I (55 years).Ceylon journal of historical and social studies, Volume 2, page 34 The Sri Lanka Navy Northern Naval Command base in Karainagar, Jaffna is named the SLNS Elara  The Legend of Manu Needhi Cholan  bell and cow of Manu Needhi Cholan Ellalan received the title \\"Manu Needhi Cholan\\" (the Chola who follows justice) because he executed his own son to provide justice to a cow. Legend has it that the king hung a giant bell in front of his courtroom for anyone needing justice to ring. One day, he came out on hearing the ringing of the bell by a cow. Upon enquiry, he found that the calf of that cow had been killed under the wheels of his son's chariot. In order to provide justice to the cow, Ellalan killed his own son, Veedhividangan, under the chariot as his own punishment i.e. Ellalan made himself suffer as much as the cow. Impressed by the justice of the king, Lord Shiva blessed him and brought back the calf and his son alive. He has been mentioned in the Silappatikaram and Periya Puranam. His name has since then been used as a metaphor for fairness and justice in Tamil literature. His capital was Thiruvarur. The Mahavamsa also states that when he was riding his cart he accidentally hit a Chetiya. After that he ordered his ministers to kill him but the ministers replied that Buddha would not approve such an act. The king asked what he should do to rectify the damage and they said that repairing the structure would be enough which is what he did. Chronicles such as the Yalpana Vaipava Malai and stone inscriptions like Konesar Kalvettu recount that Kulakkottan, an early Chola king and descendant of Manu Needhi Cholan, was the restorer of the ruined Koneswaram temple and tank at Trincomalee in 438, the Munneswaram temple of the west coast, and as the royal who settled ancient Vanniyars in the east of the island Eelam.

It is a sequel to Wang's 1971 film One Armed Boxer, and thus the film is also known as One-Armed Boxer 2 and The One Armed Boxer vs. the Flying Guillotine. Plot The film concerns Wang's one-armed martial arts master being stalked by an imperial assassin, the master of two fighters (the Tibetan lamas) who were killed in the previous film. The title refers to the assassin's weapon, the \\"flying guillotine\\", which resembles a hat with a bladed rim attached to a long chain. Upon enveloping one's head, the blades cleanly decapitate the victim with a quick pull of the chain. The Boxer's adversary is the assassin Fung Sheng Wu Chi who is blind, is an expert user of the Flying Guillotine, and relies on others to identify one-armed men, which he then kills. When the One-Armed Boxer is invited to attend a martial arts tournament, his efforts to lie low are unsuccessful, and the assassin soon tracks him down with the help of his three subordinates competing in the tournament: a Thai boxer, a yoga master, and a kobojutsu user. The One-Armed Boxer leaves the tournament and, using a series of traps, defeats the assassin's subordinates. Unable to directly confront the deadly assassin himself, the One-armed Boxer devises a plan that uses misdirection. Taking advantage of the assassin's blindness by using bamboo poles as a lure, each time the blind assassin throws his weapon, it becomes snagged on one of the bamboo poles effectively removing the inner blades of the assassin's deadly weapon; however, as it still contains a jagged outer edge it is still a formidable weapon. The One-armed Boxer then proceeds to convert a coffin-maker's shop into an elaborate trap. Once the weapon is finally destroyed, the One-armed Boxer engages the assassin in a duel and defeats him.

Metacritic rated the film 57/100 based on eleven reviews. Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times called it \\"near-great\\" and \\"a venerable example of the kung fu genre\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"Master of the Flying Guillotine has been called the Holy Grail of the Hong Kong martial arts movies of the '70s, and now that it has been lovingly restored and given a regular theatrical release, it's easy to see why.\\" Joey O'Bryan of The Austin Chronicle rated it 2/5 stars and called it \\"a mess\\" that fails to live up to the epic brawl promised by the alternate title. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called it \\"a delirious kung-fu saga\\" that is \\"wild even by the genre's lenient standards\\". Rabin concludes, \\"Goofy Z-movie fun of the highest order, Master Of The Flying Guillotine needs to be seen to be believed, and even then defies belief.\\" Phil Hall of Film Threat rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"[T]his silly production stands as a dinky reminder of why martial arts film fell out of favor during the mid-1970s\\". J. Doyle Wallis of DVD Talk rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"a complete guilty pleasure that leaves you feeling high off its empty b-movie fun\\". Mike Pinsky of DVD Verdict wrote that the film toys with and subverts many martial arts film cliches, which makes it surprising and entertaining. Soundtrack Most of the music in the film is taken from Krautrock bands, and includes: \\"Super\\" (Opening theme) and \\"Super 16\\" (Master Fung's theme) from Neu!'s second studio album, Neu! 2; \\"Rubycon, Part One\\" (The One-Armed Boxer's theme) from Tangerine Dream's sixth studio album, Rubycon', and \\"Mitternacht\\" (Suspense theme), \\"Morgenspaziergang\\" (courtyard music) and \\"Kometenmelodie 2\\" (End credits) from Kraftwerk's fourth studio album, Autobahn. The soundtrack has been referenced and sampled extensively, including the use of \\"Super 16\\" in Tarantino's Kill Bill. Legacy Quentin Tarantino has cited the film as \\"one of my favorite movies of all time.\\" The character Dhalsim from the Street Fighter video game series has been compared to the Indian assassin in the film.

He was the Labor member for the division of Batman in the House of Representatives from 7 September 2013 to 1 February 2018. Before that, he was a member of the Australian Senate for Victoria from 2008 until his resignation to contest Batman. Feeney resigned as a member of Parliament on 1 February 2018 as he was unable to produce any documentary evidence disproving he was a dual citizen, which is a breach of section 44 of the Constitution of Australia. Background and early career Feeney was born in Adelaide, South Australia in 1970, his father having emigrated from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Raised as a Roman Catholic, Feeney attended Mercedes College, Adelaide, before moving to Melbourne in 1987, where he attended the University of Melbourne. He later completed post-graduate study at Monash University, with a Masters in Public Policy and Management (MPPM). Feeney worked in the National Office of the Transport Workers Union (TWU) as a Federal Industrial Officer from 1994 to 1999. At the TWU, Feeney served as a union advocate before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). Feeney speaking with local constituents Feeney served as Victorian State Secretary of the Labor Party and State Labor Campaign Director from March 1999 to December 2002, where he had considerable success as a fund-raiser and campaign director. At the 2002 state election, Victorian Labor won 20 seats, holding 62 seats in the parliament of 88—the largest majority in Victorian history. Following that election, he joined the private staff of Premier Steve Bracks as his Director of Strategy. In 2005, Feeney returned to his home state of South Australia to become Labor's Assistant National Secretary and campaign director for SA Labor at the March 2006 state election. Feeney helped SA Labor win six seats previously held by the opposition Liberal Party. David served as Assistant National Secretary and Deputy National Campaign Director of the Australian Labor Party between 2005 and June 2008. Political career =Senate= In March 2006, Feeney was placed third on the Australian Senate from Victoria ballot paper as the Labor Party's candidate. Winning against lead candidate from the Australian Greens, Richard Di Natale, Feeney entered the Senate on 1 July 2008. During his period in the Senate, he sat on the Senate Select Committee on Climate Policy. In 2010, Feeney was one of the key MPs (along with Bill Shorten, Mark Arbib, and Don Farrell) who convinced their colleagues to support Julia Gillard in calling for a leadership spill against sitting Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. When Gillard was sworn in as Prime Minister, Feeney was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence in her first ministry, and was reappointed to this role in the second Gillard ministry. He maintained this position in the reshuffle when Rudd regained the Prime Ministership in June 2013. As Parliamentary Secretary, Feeney commissioned the report into Unresolved Recognition for Past Acts of Naval and Military Gallantry and Valour, and was responsible for the Australian Government's Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal. His responsibilities included ADF Reserves, ADF force structure (especially Plan BEERSHEBA in the Army), the Pacific Maritime Security Plan (PMSP) and liaison with Pacific Island Countries, participating in the first meeting of South Pacific Defence Ministers Meeting (SPDMM) in Tonga. Feeney also commissioned the Department of Defence workforce review, known as Plan Suakin, in 2010. =House of Representatives= Feeney was elected as the member for Batman in 2013, succeeding the retired Martin Ferguson. At the 2013 election Labor Leader Bill Shorten appointed Feeney as Shadow Minister for Justice and Shadow Assistant Minister for Defence. After 1 July 2014 the portfolio of Veterans Affairs and Centenary of ANZAC were added to his responsibilities. As a local MP, Feeney campaigned for schools funding, healthcare and public transport. He also worked to promote the Anzac Centenary in his Batman electorate, and to secure grants for local projects to commemorate the service of Australian service-men and women in the First World War. Feeney sought to promote causes in parliament including recognition of same-sex marriage, needs-based school funding, and various environmental concerns, particularly marine parks and fisheries protection. In 2017, Feeney was one of a small number of Labor MPs to express opposition to the Carmichael coal mine proposed by the Adani Group, saying the project didn't \\"stack up\\" and calling the cost to the environment and climate \\"too high\\". Feeney is a regular commentator on strategic and defence matters, was a regular contributor to ADM magazine, and Deputy Chair of the Defence sub-committee of the Joint Standing Committee of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Trade (JSCDFAT). He also served as a contributing author to 'The Long Road': Australia's train, advice and assist mission and Australia's American Alliance: Towards a New Era? David Feeney was keenly interested in the Australian Antarctic Territory, commenting on its importance to Australia’s strategic outlook and travelling there in 2017. At the 2016 federal election the Australian Greens focused their campaign effort against several inner urban electorates with sitting Labor MPs, including Feeney's seat of Batman. Feeney attracted controversy when it was revealed he had failed to disclose an investment property he owned in Northcote (valued at $2.3 million) on the Parliamentary Register of Interests. While Feeney claimed that he had gained no financial advantage from his mistake, accusations that he had \\"forgotten his house\\" caused significant damage to his re-election campaign, which had focused on Labor's policy to abolish negative gearing. His campaign in Batman was described by the Herald Sun as \\"tumultuous\\", with Feeney also leaving confidential Labor briefing notes in a TV studio after an interview on Sky News. On 2 July 2016, Feeney was narrowly re-elected with 51.03% of the two-candidate-preferred vote against the Greens. Feeney was referred to the High Court of Australia on 6 December 2017, over concerns he was in breach of section 44 of the Australian Constitution. Feeney claimed he had taken the steps required of him to relinquish any British and Irish citizenship by descent in 2007, but was unable to produce documentation confirming the British renunciation had taken place. On 1 February 2018, accordingly, Feeney announced his resignation as a member of Parliament, and revealed he would not stand as a candidate for the Batman by-election later that year. Personal life Feeney, Sanger and son Feeney is married to Liberty Sanger, principal of law firm Maurice Blackburn. They have a son, Ned (2014), and a daughter, Matilda (2019). Career after Politics David Feeney was appointed a Senior Fellow to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in August 2018. David has served as a regular guest lecturer at the Australian War College in Canberra since 2018. In December 2018 David Feeney wrote a paper advocating for Australia’s need to develop a comprehensive grand strategy for the Gravity journal of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre of the Australian National University (ANU) Since 2019 David Feeney has been a graduate student at the University of Melbourne.

MicroVAX I The MicroVAX I, code named \\"Seahorse\\", introduced in October 1984, was one of DEC's first VAX computers to use very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology. The KA610 CPU module (also known as the KD32) contained two custom chips which implemented the ALU and FPU while TTL chips were used for everything else. Two variants of the floating point chips were supported, with the chips differing by the type of floating point instructions supported, F and G, or F and D. MicroVAX II The MicroVAX II, code named \\"Mayflower\\", was a mid-range MicroVAX introduced in May 1985 and shipped shortly thereafter. It ran VAX/VMS or, alternatively, ULTRIX, the DEC native Unix operating system. It used the KA630-AA CPU module, a quad-height Q22-Bus module, which featured a MicroVAX 78032 microprocessor and a MicroVAX 78132 floating-point coprocessor operating at 5 MHz (200 ns cycle time). Two gate arrays on the module implemented the external interface for the microprocessor, Q22-bus interface and the scatter-gather map for DMA transfers over the Q22-Bus. The module also contained 1 MB of memory, an interval timer, two ROMs for the boot and diagnostic facility, a DZ console serial line unit and a time-of-year clock. A 50-pin connector for a ribbon cable near the top left corner of the module provided the means by which more memory was added to the system. The MicroVAX II supported 1 to 16 MB of memory through zero, one or two memory expansion modules. The MS630 memory expansion module was used for expanding memory capacity. Four variants of the MS630 existed: the 1 MB MS630-AA, 2 MB MS630-BA, 4 MB MS630-BB and the 8MB MS630-CA. The MS630-AA was a dual-height module, whereas the MS630-BA, MS630-BB and MS630-CA were quad-height modules. These modules used 256 Kb DRAMs and were protected by byte-parity, with the parity logic located on the module. The modules connected to the CPU module via the backplane through the C and D rows and a 50-conductor ribbon cable. The backplane served as the address bus and the ribbon cable as the data bus. The MicroVAX II came in three models of enclosure: * BA23 * BA123 * 630QE - A deskside enclosure. = KA620 = KA620 referred to a single-board MicroVAX II designed for automatic test equipment and manufacturing applications which only ran DEC's real-time VAXELN operating system.

Computer Business Review. In January 1987, the MicroVAX 2000 was the first VAX system targeted at both universities and VAX programmers who wanted to work from remote locations. The MicroVAX 2000 used the same microprocessor and floating-point coprocessor as the MicroVAX II, but was feature reduced in order to lower the cost. Limitations were a reduced maximum memory capacity, 14 MB versus 16 MB in MicroVAX II systems and the lack of Q-Bus or any expansion bus. The system could have a Shugart-based harddrive with ST412 interface and MFM encoding and had a built in 5.25-inch floppy drive (named RX33 in DEC jargon) for software distribution and backup. Supported operating systems were VMS and ULTRIX. It was packaged in a desktop form factor.  MicroVAX 3100 Series  The MicroVAX 3100 Series was introduced in 1987.

Mayfair  = MicroVAX 3500 and MicroVAX 3600 = The MicroVAX 3500 and MicroVAX 3600, code named \\"Mayfair\\", were introduced in September 1987 and were meant to be the higher end complement of the MicroVAX family. These new machines featured more than three times the performance of the MicroVAX II and supported 32 MB of ECC main memory (twice that of the MicroVAX II). The performance improvements over the MicroVAX II resulted from the increased clock rate of the CVAX chip set, which operated at 11.11 MHz (90 ns cycle time) along with a two-level, write-through caching architecture. It used the KA650 CPU module. = MicroVAX 3300 and MicroVAX 3400 = The MicroVAX 3300 and MicroVAX 3400, code named Mayfair II, were entry-level to mid-range server computers introduced on 19 October 1988 intended to compete with the IBM AS/400.Computergram (20 October 1988). \\"DEC Aims New MicroVAX 3300, 3400 At AS/400; New Disk Bus\\".

At introduction, the starting price of the MicroVAX 3800 was US$81,000 and that of the MicroVAX 3900 was US$120,200.\\"US Prices For DEC's New MicroVAXes\\". (11 April 1989). Computer Business Review. A variant of the MicroVAX 3800, the rtVAX 3800, was intended for real-time computing (RTC) applications such as computer-aided manufacturing (CAM). These systems used the KA655 CPU module, which contained a 16.67 MHz (60 ns cycle time) CVAX chip set. They supported up to 64 MB of memory. Operating systems VAX/VMS was the native operating system for the MicroVAX series, though earlier versions required a specialized version designated MicroVMS. =MicroVMS= MicroVMS was, for a while, a separate product with its own distinctive manuals, and it began with \\"tackling the technical problems one by one\\" (beginning with) the limitations imposed by \\"what would fit on a 10-MB system disk.\\" Some of the MicroVMS counterparts differed only slightly from their VMS sibling, such as using the term $TAPE1: rather than $MUA1:. Setting software prices was also a problem. $5,990 vs. $4,490: a $1,500 difference Licenses for MicroVAX software had different codes. Among the versions were 1.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.3 Distribution media \\"The only distribution medium available was the RX50, a 400-KB floppy disk\\" until, by version 4.4, when an option for TK50 tapes was added.

He was sometimes credited as 'Alan Perry'. Life and career Tomlinson was born in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, England, into a musical family, one of four children to Fred Tomlinson Sr and May Tomlinson (née Culpan).His brother Fred Tomlinson Jr developed a musical career in his own right, founding the Fred Tomlinson Singers. His younger brother, Fred Tomlinson, also a musician, founded The Fred Tomlinson Singers and performed the music for Monty Python's Flying Circus. At the age of nine he became a chorister at Manchester Cathedral, where he was eventually appointed as Head Boy in 1939. He later attended Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School and at sixteen won a scholarship to Manchester University and the Royal Manchester College of Music. He spent the next two years studying composition until in 1943 he left to join the Royal Air Force, where, although colour-blind, he became a wireless mechanic and saw service in France during 1944 and 1945. He returned to England in 1945 to resume his studies and graduated in 1947, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Music for composition as well as being made a Fellow of the Royal College of Organists and an Associate of the Royal Manchester College of Music. Tomlinson left northern England for London, where he worked as a staff arranger for Arcadia and Mills Music Publishers, providing scores for radio and television broadcasts as well as for the stage and recording studios. He continued his interest in the organ by taking up a post at a Mayfair church. Tomlinson had his first piece broadcast by the BBC in 1949 and by 1955 he had formed his own orchestra, the \\"Ernest Tomlinson Light Orchestra\\". From 1951 to 1953, he was musical director of the Chingford Amateur Dramatic and Operatic Society. In 1976, he took over the directorship of the Rossendale Male Voice Choir from his father, a post he held for five years, during which the choir won their class for three years in the BBC's \\"Grand Sing\\" competition. He was also the founder of the Northern Concert Orchestra, with whom he gave numerous broadcasts and concerts. He was a chief consultant for the Marco Polo Records label, and was featured a number of times on Brian Kay's Light Programme. In 1984, after discovering that the BBC were disposing of their light music archive, Tomlinson founded The Library of Light Orchestral Music, which is housed in a barn at his family's farmhouse near Longridge in Lancashire. The library currently contains around 50,000 pieces, including many items that would otherwise have been lost. Tomlinson and his wife Jean (née Lancaster) were married from 1949 until her death in September 2006. The couple had four children, Ann, Geoffrey, Hilary and Linda. Tomlinson's four children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren survive him. Awards Tomlinson won several prestigious awards; the Composers' Guild Award in 1965 and two Ivor Novello Awards - one for services to light music in 1970, the other for his full-length ballet Aladdin in 1975. For several years he was on the Executive Committee of the Composers' Guild of Great Britain, including being its Chairman in 1964. In addition, he was from 1965 a composer-director of the Performing Rights Society. Tomlinson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE), in the 2012 Birthday Honours, for services to music. Works Tomlinson was primarily known as a composer of light orchestral pieces and produced a considerable body of works ranging from overtures, suites and rhapsodies and miniatures, of which Little Serenade and Cantilena are probably the most popular. Also notable are a number of English folk-dance arrangements. In the 1960s, he wrote a number of Test Card pieces such as Stately Occasion and the tongue-in-cheek Capability Brown. His Fantasia on Auld Lang Syne (1976) in its 20 minutes weaves in 152 quotations from pieces by other composers. Tomlinson also worked on larger-scale forms, including several works in symphonic jazz style, such as Sinfonia '62, which won an Italian competition for \\"Rhythmic-Symphonic\\" works. Also notable are two symphonies, three concertos - including his Cornet Concerto performed by Maurice Murphy, his Rhapsody and Rondo for horn and orchestra (premiered by Dennis Brain, a one-act opera Head of the Family, a Festival of Song for chorus and orchestra and numerous works for choirs, brass bands and concert bands. In 1966, Tomlinson conducted his Symphony '65, in the Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow, played by the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra and Big Band, which was the first time a symphonic jazz work had been heard in Russia.

Baltimore classification is a system used to classify viruses based on their manner of messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis. By organizing viruses based on their manner of mRNA production, it is possible to study viruses that behave similarly as a distinct group. Seven Baltimore groups are described that take into consideration whether the viral genome is made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), whether the genome is single- or double-stranded, and whether the sense of a single-stranded RNA genome is positive or negative. Baltimore classification also closely corresponds to the manner of replicating the genome, so Baltimore classification is useful for grouping viruses together for both transcription and replication. Certain subjects pertaining to viruses are associated with multiple, specific Baltimore groups, such as specific forms of translation of mRNA and the host range of different types of viruses. Structural characteristics such as the shape of the viral capsid, which stores the viral genome, and the evolutionary history of viruses are not necessarily related to Baltimore groups. Baltimore classification was created in 1971 by virologist David Baltimore. Since then, it has become common among virologists to use Baltimore classification alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary history. In 2018 and 2019, Baltimore classification was partially integrated into virus taxonomy based on evidence that certain groups were descended from common ancestors. Various realms, kingdoms, and phyla now correspond to specific Baltimore groups. Overview Baltimore classification groups viruses together based on their manner of mRNA synthesis. Characteristics directly related to this include whether the genome is made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA), the strandedness of the genome, which can be either single- or double-stranded, and the sense of a single-stranded genome, which is either positive or negative. The primary advantage of Baltimore classification is that by classifying viruses according to the aforementioned characteristics, viruses that behave in the same manner can be studied as distinct groups. There are seven Baltimore groups numbered with Roman numerals, listed hereafter.Bowman 2019, pp. 37–39Lostroh 2019, pp. 11–13 *Group I: double-stranded DNA viruses *Group II: single-stranded DNA viruses *Group III: double-stranded RNA viruses *Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses *Group V: negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses *Group VI: single-stranded RNA viruses with a DNA intermediate in their life cycle *Group VII: double-stranded DNA viruses with an RNA intermediate in their life cycle Baltimore classification is chiefly based on the transcription of the viral genome, and viruses within each group typically share the manners by which the mRNA synthesis occurs. While not the direct focus of Baltimore classification, groups are organized in such a manner that viruses in each group also typically have the same mechanisms of replicating the viral genome.Cann 2015, pp. 122–127 Because of this, Baltimore classification provides insights into both the transcription and replication parts of the viral life cycle. Structural characteristics of a virus particle, called a virion, such as the shape of the viral capsid and the presence of a viral envelope, a lipid membrane that usually surrounds the capsid, have no direct relation to Baltimore groups, nor do the groups necessarily show genetic relation based on evolutionary history. Visualization of the seven groups of virus according to the Baltimore Classification Classification =DNA viruses= DNA viruses have genomes made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and are organized into two groups: double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses. They are assigned to three separate realms: Duplodnaviria, Monodnaviria, and Varidnaviria. Group I: double- stranded DNA viruses The first Baltimore group contains viruses that have a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) genome. All dsDNA viruses have their mRNA synthesized in a three-step process. First, a transcription preinitiation complex binds to the DNA upstream of the site where transcription begins, allowing for the recruitment of a host RNA polymerase. Second, once the RNA polymerase is recruited, it uses the negative strand as a template for synthesizing mRNA strands. Third, the RNA polymerase terminates transcription upon reaching a specific signal, such as a polyadenylation site.Rampersad 2018, p. 66Fermin 2018, pp. 36–40 dsDNA viruses make use of several mechanisms to replicate their genome. Bidirectional replication, which is the typical form of DNA replication in eukaryotes, is widely used. In bidirectional replication, a circular genome is cleaved to separate the two strands, creating a fork from which replication of both strands progresses around the genome at the same time, going in two opposite directions until the opposite end is reached. A rolling circle mechanism that produces linear strands while progressing in a loop around the circular genome is also used that likewise replicates both strands simultaneously. Instead of replicating both strands at once, some dsDNA viruses use a strand displacement method whereby one strand is synthesized from a template strand, and a complementary strand is then synthesized from the prior synthesized strand, forming a dsDNA genome. Lastly, some dsDNA viruses are replicated as part of a process called replicative transposition whereby a viral genome in a host cell's DNA is replicated to another part of a host genome. dsDNA viruses can be subdivided between those that replicate in the nucleus, and as such are relatively dependent on host cell machinery for transcription and replication, and those that replicate in the cytoplasm, in which case they have evolved or acquired their own means of executing transcription and replication. dsDNA viruses are also commonly divided between tailed dsDNA viruses, referring to members of the realm Duplodnaviria, usually the tailed bacteriophages of the order Caudovirales, and tailless or non-tailed dsDNA viruses of the realm Varidnaviria. dsDNA viruses are classified into three of the four realms and include many taxa that are unassigned to a realm: *All viruses in Duplodnaviria are dsDNA viruses. Viruses in this realm belong to two groups: tailed bacteriophages in Caudovirales and herpesviruses in Herpesvirales. *In Monodnaviria, members of the class Papovaviricetes are dsDNA viruses. Viruses in Papovaviricetes constitute two groups: papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. *All viruses in Varidnaviria are dsDNA viruses. Viruses in this realm include adenoviruses, giant viruses, and poxviruses. *The following taxa that are unassigned to a realm exclusively contain dsDNA viruses: **Orders: Ligamenvirales **Families: Ampullaviridae, Baculoviridae, Bicaudaviridae, Clavaviridae, Fuselloviridae, Globuloviridae, Guttaviridae, Halspiviridae, Hytrosaviridae, Nimaviridae, Nudiviridae, Ovaliviridae, Plasmaviridae, Polydnaviridae, Portogloboviridae, Thaspiviridae, Tristomaviridae **Genera: Dinodnavirus, Rhizidiovirus Group II: single-stranded DNA viruses The canine parvovirus is an ssDNA virus. The second Baltimore group contains viruses that have a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome. ssDNA viruses have the same manner of transcription as dsDNA viruses. However, because the genome is single-stranded, it is first made into a double-stranded form by a DNA polymerase upon entering a host cell. mRNA is then synthesized from the double-stranded form. The double-stranded form of ssDNA viruses may be produced either directly after entry into a cell or as a consequence of replication of the viral genome. Eukaryotic ssDNA viruses are replicated in the nucleus.Fermin 2018, pp. 40–41 Most ssDNA viruses contain circular genomes that are replicated via rolling circle replication (RCR). ssDNA RCR is initiated by an endonuclease that bonds to and cleaves the positive strand, allowing a DNA polymerase to use the negative strand as a template for replication. Replication progresses in a loop around the genome by means of extending the 3'-end of the positive strand, displacing the prior positive strand, and the endonuclease cleaves the positive strand again to create a standalone genome that is ligated into a circular loop. The new ssDNA may be packaged into virions or replicated by a DNA polymerase to form a double-stranded form for transcription or continuation of the replication cycle.Rampersad 2018, pp. 61–62 Parvoviruses contain linear ssDNA genomes that are replicated via rolling hairpin replication (RHR). RHR is similar to RCR but each end of the linear genome contains an inverted terminal repeat in a hairpin loop structure. After the genome has been repaired by a DNA polymerase to form dsDNA, the endonuclease unbinds the hairpin loops, which are replicated with the rest of the genome. The dsDNA genome is then cleaved in two, and the hairpin loops at both ends of both strands are formed. For parvoviruses, either the positive or negative sense strand may be packaged into capsids. Nearly all ssDNA viruses have positive sense genomes, but a few exceptions and peculiarities exist. The family Anelloviridae is the only ssDNA family whose members have negative sense genomes, which are circular. Parvoviruses, as previously mentioned, may package either the positive or negative sense strand into virions. Lastly, bidnaviruses package both the positive and negative linear strands. In any case, the sense of ssDNA viruses, unlike for ssRNA viruses, is not sufficient to separate ssDNA viruses into two groups since all ssDNA viral genomes are converted to dsDNA forms prior to transcription and replication. ssDNA viruses are classified into one of the four realms and include several families that are unassigned to a realm: *In Monodnaviria, all members except viruses in Papovaviricetes are ssDNA viruses. *The unassigned families Anelloviridae and Spiraviridae are ssDNA virus families. *Viruses in the family Finnlakeviridae contain ssDNA genomes. Finnlakeviridae is unassigned to a realm but is a proposed member of Varidnaviria. =RNA viruses= RNA viruses have genomes made of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and comprise three groups: double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses, and negative sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses. RNA viruses are classified in the kingdom Orthornavirae in the realm Riboviria. Group III: double-stranded RNA viruses Rotaviruses are dsRNA viruses. The third Baltimore group contains viruses that have a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome. After entering a host cell, the dsRNA genome is transcribed to mRNA from the negative strand by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The mRNA may be used for translation or replication. Single-stranded mRNA is replicated to form the dsRNA genome. The 5'-end of the genome may be naked, capped, or covalently bound to a viral protein.Rampersad 2018, p. 65 dsRNA is not a molecule made by cells, so cellular life has evolved antiviral systems to detect and inactivate viral dsRNA. To counteract this, many dsRNA genomes are constructed inside of capsids, thereby avoiding detection inside of the host cell's cytoplasm. mRNA is forced out from the capsid in order to be translated or to be translocated from a mature capsid to a progeny capsid.Fermin 2018, p. 42 While dsRNA viruses typically have capsids, viruses in the families Amalgaviridae and Endornaviridae have not been observed to form virions and as such apparently lack capsids. Endornaviruses are also unusual in that unlike other RNA viruses, they possess a single, long open reading frame (ORF), or translatable portion, and a site-specific nick in the 5' region of the positive strand. dsRNA viruses are classified into two phyla within the kingdom Orthornavirae of the realm Riboviria: *All viruses in Duplornaviricota are dsRNA viruses. *In Pisuviricota, all members of the class Duplopiviricetes are dsRNA viruses. Group IV: positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses Coronaviruses are +ssRNA viruses. The fourth Baltimore group contains viruses that have a positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome. For +ssRNA viruses, the genome functions as mRNA, so no transcription is required for translation. However, +ssRNA viruses will also produce positive sense copies of the genome from negative sense strands of an intermediate dsRNA genome. This acts as both a transcription and a replication process since the replicated RNA is also mRNA. The 5'-end may be naked, capped, or covalently bound to a viral protein, and the 3'-end may be naked or polyadenylated.Rampersad 2018, pp. 64–65Fermin 2018, pp. 43–44 Many +ssRNA viruses are able to have only a portion of their genome transcribed. Typically, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) strands are used for translation of structural and movement proteins needed during intermediate and late stages of infection. sgRNA transcription may occur by commencing RNA synthesis within the genome rather than from the 5'-end, by stopping RNA synthesis at specific sequences in the genome, or by, as a part of both prior methods, synthesizing leader sequences from the viral RNA that are then attached to sgRNA strands. Because replication is required for sgRNA synthesis, RdRp is always translated first. Because the process of replicating the viral genome produces intermediate dsRNA molecules, +ssRNA viruses can targeted by the host cell's immune system. To avoid detection, +ssRNA viruses replicate in membrane- associated vesicles that are used as replication factories. From there, only viral +ssRNA, which may be mRNA, enters the main cytoplasmic area of the cell. +ssRNA viruses can be subdivided between those that have polycistronic mRNA, which encodes a polyprotein that is cleaved to form multiple mature proteins, and those that produce subgenomic mRNAs and therefore undergo two or more rounds of translation.Cann 2015, pp. 151–154 +ssRNA viruses are included in three phyla in the kingdom Orthornavirae in the realm Riboviria: *All viruses in Lenarviricota are +ssRNA viruses. *All viruses in Pisuviricota are +ssRNA viruses, excluding the class Duplopiviricetes, whose members have dsRNA genomes. *All viruses in Kitrinoviricota are +ssRNA viruses. Group V: negative sense single-stranded RNA viruses The fifth Baltimore group contains viruses that have a negative sense, single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) genome. mRNA, which is positive sense, is transcribed directly from the negative sense genome. The first process for -ssRNA transcription involves RdRp binding to a leader sequence on the 3' end of the genome, transcribing a 5' triphosphate-leader RNA that is capped, then stopping and restarting on a transcription signal which is capped, continuing until a stop signal is reached. The second manner is similar but instead of synthesizing a cap, RdRp may make use of cap snatching, whereby a short sequence of host cell mRNA is taken and used as the 5' cap of the viral mRNA. Genomic -ssRNA is replicated from the positive sense antigenome in a similar manner as transcription, except in reverse using the antigenome as a template for the genome. RdRp moves from the 3'-end to the 5'-end of the antigenome and ignores all transcription signals when synthesizing genomic -ssRNA. Various -ssRNA viruses use special mechanisms for transcription. The manner of producing the polyA tail may be via polymerase stuttering, during which RdRp transcribes an adenine from uracil and then moves back in the RNA sequence with the mRNA to transcribe it again, continuing this process numerous times until hundreds of adenines have been added to the 3'-end of the mRNA. Additionally, some -ssRNA viruses are ambisense, as both the positive and negative strands separately encode viral proteins, and these viruses produce two separate mRNA strands: one directly from the genome and one from a complementary strand.Cann 2015, pp. 154–156 -ssRNA viruses can be subdivided informally between those that have nonsegmented and segmented genomes. Nonsegmented -ssRNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, and segmented -ssRNA viruses replicate in the nucleus. During transcription, the RdRp produces one monocistronic mRNA strand from each segment of the genome.Fermin 2018, pp. 45–46 All -ssRNA viruses are classified in the phylum Negarnaviricota in the kingdom Orthornavirae in the realm Riboviria. Negarnaviricota only contains -ssRNA viruses, so \\"-ssRNA virus\\" is synonymous with Negarnaviricota. Negarnaviricota is divided into two subphyla: Haploviricotina, whose members synthesize a cap structure on viral mRNA required for protein synthesis, and Polyploviricotina, whose members instead obtain caps on mRNA via cap snatching. =Reverse transcribing viruses= Reverse transcribing (RT) viruses have genomes made of either DNA or RNA and replicate via reverse transcription. Two groups of reverse transcribing viruses exist: single-stranded RNA-RT (ssRNA-RT) viruses, and double-stranded DNA-RT (dsDNA-RT) viruses. Reverse transcribing viruses are classified in the kingdom Pararnavirae in the realm Riboviria. Group VI: single-stranded RNA viruses with a DNA intermediate The sixth Baltimore group contains viruses that have a (positive-sense) single-stranded RNA genome that has a DNA intermediate ((+)ssRNA-RT) in its replication cycle.ssRNA-RT viruses are often called retroviruses, although this term is also used to refer to any reverse transcribing virus as well as specifically to viruses in the ssRNA-RT family Retroviridae. ssRNA-RT viruses are transcribed in the same manner as DNA viruses, but their linear genomes are first converted to a dsDNA form through a process called reverse transcription. The viral reverse transcriptase enzyme synthesizes a DNA strand from the ssRNA strand, and the RNA strand is degraded and replaced with a DNA strand to create a dsDNA genome. The genome is then integrated into the DNA of the host cell, where it is now called a provirus. The host cell's RNA polymerase II then transcribes RNA in the nucleus from the proviral DNA. Some of this RNA may become mRNA whereas other strands will become copies of the viral genome for replication.Rampersad 2018, pp. 63–64Cann 2015, p. 156 ssRNA-RT viruses are all included in the class Revtraviricetes, phylum Arterviricota, kingdom Pararnavirae of the realm Riboviria. Excluding Caulimoviridae, which belongs to Group VII, all members of the Revtraviricetes order Ortervirales are ssRNA- RT viruses. Group VII: double-stranded DNA viruses with an RNA intermediate The seventh Baltimore group contains viruses that have a double-stranded DNA genome that has an RNA intermediate (dsDNA-RT) in its replication cycle. dsDNA-RT viruses have a gap in one strand, which is repaired to create a complete dsDNA genome prior to transcription. dsDNA-RT viruses are transcribed in the same manner as dsDNA viruses, but make use of reverse transcription to replicate their circular genome while it is still in the capsid. The host cell's RNA polymerase II transcribes RNA strands from the genome in the cytoplasm, and the genome is replicated from these RNA strands. The dsDNA genome is produced from pregenomic RNA strands via the same general mechanism as ssRNA-RT viruses, but with replication occurring in a loop around the circular genome. After replication, the dsDNA genome may be packed or sent to the nucleus for further rounds of transcription. dsDNA-RT viruses are, like ssRNA-RT, all included in the class Revtraviricetes. Two families of dsDNA-RT viruses are recognized: Caulimoviridae, which belongs to the order Ortervirales, and Hepadnaviridae, which is the sole family in the order Blubervirales. Multi-group characteristics A number of characteristics of viruses are not directly associated with Baltimore classification but nonetheless closely correspond to multiple, specific Baltimore groups. This includes alternative splicing during transcription, whether the viral genome is segmented, the host range of viruses, whether the genome is linear or circular, and different methods of translating viral mRNA. =Alternative splicing= Alternative splicing is a mechanism by which different proteins can be produced from a single gene by means of using alternative splicing sites to produce different mRNAs. It is found in various DNA, -ssRNA, and reverse transcribing viruses. Viruses may make use of alternative splicing solely to produce multiple proteins from a single pre-mRNA strand or for other specific purposes. For certain viruses, including the families Orthomyxoviridae and Papillomaviridae, alternative splicing acts as a way to regulate early and late gene expression during different stages of infection. Herpesviruses use it as a potential anti-host defense mechanism to prevent synthesis of specific anttiviral proteins. Furthermore, in addition to alternative splicing, because cellular unspliced RNA cannot be transported out of the nucleus, hepadnaviruses and retroviruses contain their own proteins for exporting their unspliced genomic RNA out of the nucleus.Rampersad 2018, pp. 71–72 =Genome segmentation= Viral genomes can exist in a single, or monopartite, segment, or they may be split into more than one molecule, called multipartite. For monopartite viruses, all genes are on the single segment of the genome. Multipartite viruses typically package their genomes into a single virion so that the whole genome is in one virus particle, and the separate segments contain different genes. Monopartite viruses are found in all Baltimore groups, whereas multipartite viruses are usually RNA viruses. This is because most multipartite viruses infect plants or fungi, which are eukaryotes, and most eukaryotic viruses are RNA viruses.Fermin 2018, pp. 35–46 The family Pleolipoviridae varies as some viruses are monopartite ssDNA while others are bipartite with one segment being ssDNA and the other dsDNA. Viruses in the ssDNA plant virus family Geminiviridae likewise vary between being monopartite and bipartite. =Host range= Different Baltimore groups tend to be found within different branches cellular life. In prokaryotes, the large majority of viruses are dsDNA viruses, and a significant minority are ssDNA viruses. Prokaryotic RNA viruses, in contrast, are relatively rare. Most eukaryotic viruses, including most human, animal, and plant viruses, are RNA viruses, although eukaryotic DNA viruses are also common. More specifically, the vast majority of dsDNA viruses infect prokaryotes, ssDNA viruses are found in all three domains of life, dsRNA and +ssRNA viruses are primarily found in eukaryotes but also in bacteria, and -ssRNA and reverse transcribing viruses are only found in eukaryotes. =Linear vs circular genomes= Viral genomes may be either linear with ends or circular in a loop. Whether a virus has a linear or circular genome varies from group to group. A significant percentage of dsDNA viruses are both, ssDNA viruses are primarily circular, RNA viruses and ssRNA-RT viruses are typically linear, and dsDNA-RT viruses are typically circular. In the dsDNA family Sphaerolipoviridae, and in the family Pleolipoviridae, viruses contain both linear and circular genomes, varying from genus to genus. =RNA editing= RNA editing is used by various ssRNA viruses to produce different proteins from a single gene. This can be done via polymerase slippage during transcription or by post-transcriptional editing. In polymerase slippage, the RNA polymerase slips one nucleotide back during transcription, inserting a nucleotide not included in the template strand. Editing of a genomic template would impair gene expression, so RNA editing is only done during and after transcription. For ebola viruses, RNA editing improves the ability to adapt to their hosts. Alternative splicing differs from RNA editing in that alternative splicing does not change the mRNA sequence like RNA editing but instead changes the coding capacity of an mRNA sequence as a result of alternative splicing sites. The two mechanisms otherwise have the same result: multiple proteins are expressed from a single gene. =Translation= Translation is the process by which proteins are synthesized from mRNA by ribosomes. Baltimore groups do not directly pertain to the translation of viral proteins, but various atypical types of translation used by viruses are usually found within specific Baltimore groups: *Non-canonical translation initiation: ** Viral initiation of translation: used primarily by +ssRNA and ssRNA-RT viruses, various viruses have evolved mechanisms to initiate translation, such as having internal ribosomal entry sites to allow for cap-independent translation, having downstream hairpin loops that allow for cap-dependent translation in the absence of an eIF2 initiation factor, and initiation at a CUG or other start codon with a leucine amino acid.Rampersad 2018, pp. 69–70 ** Leaky scanning: used by various viruses in all Baltimore groups, the 40S ribosomal subunit may scan through a start codon, thereby skipping an ORF, only initiating translation with the 60S subunit at a subsequent start codon.Rampersad 2018, pp. 73–74 ** Ribosomal shunting: used by various dsDNA, +ssRNA, -ssRNA, ssRNA- RT, a dsDNA-RT viruses, ribosomes will start scanning from a 5'-cap structure then bypass a leader structure in the mRNA, initiation translation downstream from the leader sequence.Rampersad 2018, pp. 74–75 ** Termination- reinitiation: used by some dsRNA and +ssRNA viruses, ribosomes may translate an ORF, but following termination of translation of that ORF, a proportion of 40S subunits of the ribosome remain attached to the mRNA as a way to reinitiate translation of a subsequent ORF. *Non-canonical elongation and termination of translation: ** Ribosomal frameshifting: used by various dsDNA, dsRNA, +ssRNA, and ssRNA-RT viruses, produces merged proteins from overlapping ORFs. This is executed simply by ribosomes slipping one nucleobase forward or backward during translation. ** Suppression of termination: also called stop- codon readthrough, used by various dsRNA, +ssRNA, and ssRNA-RT viruses, certain viruses contain codons in their mRNA would normally signal for termination of translation upon being recognized by a release factor but are instead partially recognized by tRNA during translation, which allows for continued translation up to the next stop codon in order to produce an extended end of the viral protein. In viruses, this is often used to express replicase enzymes.Rampersad 2018, pp. 72–73 ** Ribosomal skipping: also called stop-carry on, used by various dsRNA and +ssRNA viruses, a viral peptide, or amino acid sequence, may prevent a ribosome from covalently linking a new inserted amino acid, which blocks further translation. Consequently, the polyprotein is co-translationally cleaved, and a new amino acid sequence is started, leading to the production of two individual proteins from one ORF. Viroids Viroids are pathogenic -ssRNA strands that behave similarly to viruses but do not encode structural proteins. -ssRNA viruses typically have linear genomes, whereas viroids have circular genomes. Viroids have their own distinct transcription and replication methods. Those that have been classified officially belong to two families: Avsunviroidae and Pospiviroidae.Cann 2015, p. 3 Viroids are transcribed by means of a rolling circle mechanism. After the genome enters a cell, a positive strand, the antigenome, is synthesized by the host DNA polymerase II enzyme, which replicates the genome in a loop around the circular genome. The antigenome can be used as mRNA or it can be replicated to produce genomic -ssRNA. Synthesis of -ssRNA from the antigenome is performed via the same mechanism as for transcription. Viroids use two manners of replication: symmetric and asymmetric rolling circle replication. Symmetric rolling circle replication is used by Avsunviroidae and has a concatemer of multiple linear antigenomes replicated. The concatemer is cleaved into separate antigenomes, both ends are connected to each other, and genomic -ssRNA strands are then synthesized from the antigenome. Asymmetric rolling circle replication is used by Pospiviroidae and has a linear concatemer of antigenomes transcribed. The concatemer is cleaved into separate antigenomes that remain linear, genomic linear -ssRNA is synthesized from the antigenome, and the replicated linear -ssRNA is formed into a circular genome. History David Baltimore Baltimore classification was proposed in 1971 by virologist David Baltimore in a paper titled Expression of Animal Virus Genomes. It initially contained the first six groups but was later expanded to include group VII. Because of the utility of Baltimore classification, it has come to be used alongside standard virus taxonomy, which is based on evolutionary relationships and governed by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). From the 1990s to the 2010s, virus taxonomy used a 5-rank system ranging from order to species with Baltimore classification used in conjunction. Outside of the ICTV's official framework, various supergroups of viruses joining together different families and orders were created over time based on increasing evidence of deeper evolutionary relations. Consequently, in 2016, the ICTV began to consider establishing ranks higher than order as well as how the Baltimore groups would be treated among higher taxa. In two votes in 2018 and 2019, a 15-rank system ranging from realm to species was established by the ICTV. As part of this, the Baltimore groups for RNA viruses and RT viruses were incorporated into formal taxa. In 2018, the realm Riboviria was established and initially included the three RNA virus groups. A year later, Riboviria was expanded to also include both RT groups. Within the realm, RT viruses are included in the kingdom Pararnavirae and RNA viruses in the kingdom Orthornavirae. Furthermore, the three Baltimore groups for RNA viruses are used as defining characteristics of the phyla in Orthornavirae. Unlike RNA viruses and RT viruses, DNA viruses have not been united under a single realm but are instead dispersed across three realms and various taxa that are not assigned to a realm. The realm Duplodnaviria exclusively contains dsDNA viruses, Monodnaviria primarily contains ssDNA viruses but also contains dsDNA viruses, and Varidnaviria exclusively contains dsDNA viruses, although some proposed members of Varidnaviria, namely the family Finnlakeviridae, are ssDNA viruses.

The defendant is in breach of duty towards the claimant if their conduct fell short of the standard expected under the circumstances. General standard of care For a defendant to be deemed negligent, he must have breached his duty of care towards the plaintiff. In order to be deemed as breaching the duty of care, his actions must be proven to fall below the standard of care likely to be taken by the reasonable man. Establishing a breach of duty and ascertaining the standard of care is complex and before establishing that the duty of care has been breached the plaintiff must first prove that the defendant owed him a duty of care. The standard of care is defined as the measures that a reasonable person (in the circumstances of the defendant) take to reduce the risk of harm. In other words, it is the response of a reasonable person to a foreseeable risk. The standard of care naturally varies over time, and is effected by circumstantial factors. Thus, when a standard of care is established in one case, it will not automatically become a precedent for another - each case is judged on its own facts. Special standards The standard of \\"the man on the Clapham omnibus\\" is not applied in all cases, since this might lead to unfairness. There are defendants for whom this standard is much too low and would exonerate an obvious wrongdoing. In other cases, the standard may be seen as too demanding of the defendant in the circumstances. The most common examples are the cases of specialist defendants, inexperienced defendants and child defendants. =Skilled defendants (specialists)= The test of an ordinary average person would not be appropriate for defendants that profess or hold themselves out as professing a certain skill. The \\"man on the Clapham omnibus\\" does not have that skill and the conduct expected from a skilled professional is not the same as could be expected of an ordinary man in the same circumstances.See Bolam v. Friern Hospital Management Committee [1957] 2 All ER 118 The general standard applied to professionals is therefore that of a \\"reasonable professional\\", e.g. car mechanic, doctor etc. Breach of the duty owed, Sabol v. Richmond Heights General Hospital (1996) The court stated that the nurses’ actions were consistent with basic professional standards of practice for medical-surgical nurses in an acute care hospital. They did not have nor were they expected to have specialized psychiatric nursing training and would not be judged as though they did. See Yoder-Wise, Patricia. Leading and Managing in Nursing, Revised Reprint, 5th Edition. Mosby, 2011. =Novices (imperitia culpae adnumerator)= Novices in a certain area of skill must show the same standard of care as a reasonable person with that particular skill. No allowance is given for the defendant's lack of experience. *Nettleship v Weston (1971) 3 All ER 581 requires a novice driver to show the same standard of care as a reasonably competent driver. *Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority (1986) 3 All ER 801 expects a junior doctor to perform compliant to the standard of a competent and skilled doctor working in the same post. *Wells v Cooper (1958) 2 All ER 527 states that someone who does DIY jobs repairing their own house is expected to show the same standard of care as a reasonably skilled amateur in the particular trade involved. However, they are not required to reach the standard of a professional. It is important to note that the claimant's knowledge of the defendant's lack of experience in the skill he is exercising does not result in the standard being lowered. In Nettleship v Weston, a driving instructor was injured due to a mistake of his student. The student argued that the instructor was aware of her lack of experience, but the Court of Appeal refused to accommodate this fact in their decision on the standard of care expected from her. At the same time, the teacher's award of damages was reduced due to his contributory negligence. =Children= While no allowance is made for novices, the courts are prepared to lower the standard of care expected of children, on account of their age. A child defendant is expected to meet the standard of a reasonable child of the same age. * Gough v Thorne (1966) 3 All ER 398: a 13½ year old girl was not contributorily negligent when she crossed the road without looking after being beckoned by a lorry driver and was hit by a car driving at excessive speed. * Mullin v Richards [1998] 1 All ER 920: a fifteen-year-old girl was not negligent when she was play fighting with a friend and a ruler she was fencing with shattered, a splinter flying into the other girl's eye. Conduct expected of a reasonable person In the usual case, having established that there is a duty of care, the claimant must prove that the defendant failed to do what the reasonable person (\\"reasonable professional\\", \\"reasonable child\\") would have done in the same situation. If the defendant fails to come up to the standard, this will be a breach of the duty of care. This is judged by reference to the following factors: *What did the defendant know? According to Denning LJ. in Roe v Minister of Health (1954) 2 AER 131, the defendant will only be liable if the reasonable person would have foreseen the loss or damage in the circumstances prevailing at the time of the alleged breach of duty. *What was the degree of risk? The greater the risk that serious harm can be inflicted, the greater the precautions that the defendant will be required to take. In Bolton v Stone[1951] A.C. 850, [1951] 1 All E.R. 1078, a cricket club was not negligent when a ball was hit out of the ground and injured the plaintiff, because the likelihood of this occurring was so small that the defendant could not be expected to have taken precautions. In Miller v. Jackson ([1977] QB 966, [1977] 3 WLR 20, [1977] 3 All ER 338 however, the ball was hit out of the ground several times every season. In these circumstances, the club was expected to take precautions. *How practical were these precautions? In Wilson v Governor of Sacred Heart Roman Catholic Primary School (1997) EWCA Civ 2644 it was held that a primary school was not negligent in not employing someone to supervise the playground after the close of school hours and until all the children had left. In Haley v London Electricity Board [1964] 3 All ER 185, a blind man fell into a hole in the ground that was indicated by a visual sign. He became deaf as a result. It was held that it was foreseeable that a blind man would be walking on the street and the risk of him injuring himself justified the precautions of putting up a barrier. The test is a balance of reasonableness of precautions against the likelihood of injury being sustained. *What is the social importance of the defendant's activity? If the defendant's actions serve a socially useful purpose then they may have been justified in taking greater risks. Thus, in Watt v Hertfordshire CC (1954) 2 AER 368, the fire brigade was not negligent in getting the wrong vehicle to the scene of an accident because valuable time would have been lost in getting the best vehicle there to help. Since 26 July 2006, this consideration has had a statutory basis under section 1 of the Compensation Act 2006. *Common practice. A defendant complying with a common practice in his area of activity will usually be considered to have met the standard of a reasonable man, unless the court judges the practice itself to be negligent. In Paris v Stepney Borough Council (1951) 1 AER 42 although there was a practice of not providing employees with safety goggles, the Council owed a special duty to protect the claimant because he had already lost the sight of one eye. =Sporting events= The conduct expected from a participant in a sports event towards his competitors or spectators differs from the conduct of a reasonable person outside such events. It has been held that in the \\"heat and flurry\\" of a competition, a participant will only be in breach of duty towards other participants and spectators if he shows \\"reckless disregard for their safety\\".See Wooldridge v Sumner [1963] 2 QB 23 regarding the spectators, and Harrison v Vincent [1982] RTR 8 regarding other sportsmen At the same time, in another case,See Condon v Basi [1985] 2 All ER 453 the standard of care expected from one player towards another is the usual standard of taking \\"all reasonable care in the circumstances in which they were placed\\", although in that case the defendant was also found to be acting recklessly. It is not clear at present if and how the two approaches can be reconciled. Burden of proof THE OBLIGATION TO PROVE ONE'S ASSERTION is burden of proof. Whether or not the defendant in a given case has conducted himself below the standard of \\"a reasonable person\\" is a question of fact and it is for the claimant to prove this fact. However, in certain situations it is unlikely that a certain event could take place without the defendant's negligence, for example if a surgeon left a scalpel in the patient's body. In such cases, it is said that \\"the thing speaks for itself\\" (res ipsa loquitur), and it is for the defendant to show that the fact causing the damage was not attributable to his negligence. The claimant may raise res ipsa loquitur to shift the evidential burden to the defendant. To do so, following criteria must be satisfied: 1. The incident occurred in an unexplainable fashion; 2. The incident would not have occurred in the ordinary course of events if not defendant's negligence; and 3. The defendant or defendants had control of the injury causing object.

King Mesha of Moab (Hebrew: מֵישַׁע Mēša‘; Moabite: 𐤌𐤔𐤏 MŠ‘) was a king of Moab in the 9th century BC, known most famously for having the Mesha Stele inscribed and erected at Dibon. In this inscription he calls himself \\"Mesha, son of Kemosh-[...], the king of Moab, the Dibonite.\\" The two main records: Mesha Stele and the Bible The two main sources for the existence and history of King Mesha are the Mesha Stele and the Hebrew Bible. Aside from these attestations, references to Mesha are scanty, a noteworthy exception being the El-Kerak Inscription. The Books of Samuel record that Moab was conquered by David (floruit c.1000-970 BC) and retained in the territories of his son Solomon (d. c.931 BC). Later, after the split of Israel into two kingdoms, King Omri of the northern kingdom of Israel reconquered Moab after it had been lost subsequent to King Solomon's reign. The Mesha Stele, named after the Moabite king who erected it, makes no mention of earlier history and only mentions the conquest of the land by Omri. The stele records Mesha's liberation of Moab from under the suzerainty of Israel in c.850 BC. reports the same events from the point of view of the Israelites, stating that \\"King Mesha of Moab ... used to deliver to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of one hundred thousand rams\\", before rebelling against \\"the king of Israel... Jehoram\\" (the Mesha Stele does not name the king against whom Mesha rebelled). The Second Book of Kings and the Mesha Stele differ in their explanation for the success of the revolt: according to Mesha, \\"Israel has been defeated\\", but 2 Kings says the Israelites withdrew when Mesha sacrificed the eldest son of either himself or the Edomite king to his god Chemosh (the text is not explicit at this point) on the walls of the capital city in which he was being besieged. If the latter is the case, the interpretation would be that Mesha's deed caused Edom to withdraw from the coalition. While it is plausible that one king held the eldest son of a neighbouring king hostage and sacrificed him when attacked, it is at least as plausible that he offered his own son to his main god in exchange for deliverance from destruction. In any case, the effect stated in the Bible is remarkable. \\"And there came great wrath against Israel. And they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.\\"() Name The name \\"Mesha\\" is based on the Hebrew root meaning \\"to save\\", but some scholars have suggested that it seems to have been etymologically equivalent to the Hebrew \\"Moshe\\" (Moses).Lemaire, André (2007), \\"The Mesha Stele and the Omri Dynasty\\" in Crabbe, Lester L. \\"Ahab Agonistes: The Rise and Fall of the Omride Dynasty\\" (T&T; Clark) See also *List of biblical figures identified in extra- biblical sources Further reading *\\"The Cambridge Ancient History\\", Vol. III Pt. i, 2nd Ed.; Boardman, Edwards, Hammond & Sollberger eds.; Cambridge University Press, 1982 *\\"Reading the Old Testament\\"; Lawrence Boadt; Paulist Press, 1984 *\\"The History and Religion of Israel\\"; G.W.

The moving fluid creates a space devoid of downstream-flowing fluid on the downstream side of the object. Fluid behind the obstacle flows into the void creating a swirl of fluid on each edge of the obstacle, followed by a short reverse flow of fluid behind the obstacle flowing upstream, toward the back of the obstacle. This phenomenon is naturally observed behind large emergent rocks in swift-flowing rivers. Swirl and eddies in engineering The propensity of a fluid to swirl is used to promote good fuel/air mixing in internal combustion engines. In fluid mechanics and transport phenomena, an eddy is not a property of the fluid, but a violent swirling motion caused by the position and direction of turbulent flow.220x220px  Reynolds number and turbulence  alt=In 1883, scientist Osborne Reynolds conducted a fluid dynamics experiment involving water and dye, where he adjusted the velocities of the fluids and observed the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, characterized by the formation of eddies and vortices. Turbulent flow is defined as the flow in which the system's inertial forces are dominant over the viscous forces. This phenomenon is described by Reynolds number, a unit- less number used to determine when turbulent flow will occur. Conceptually, the Reynolds number is the ratio between inertial forces and viscous forces.Schlieren photograph showing the thermal convection plume rising from an ordinary candle in still air. The plume is initially laminar, but transition to turbulence occurs in the upper 1/3 of the image. The image was made using a one-meter-diameter schlieren mirror by Gary Settles. The general form for the Reynolds number flowing through a tube of radius r (or diameter d): mathrm{Re} = {2vrho r over mu} = {rho v d over mu} where is the velocity of the fluid, is its density, is the radius of the tube, and is the viscosity of the fluid. to turbulent flow in a fluid is defined by the critical Reynolds number, for a closed pipe this works out to approximately mathrm{Re}_text{c} approx 2000. In terms of the critical Reynolds number, the critical velocity is represented as v_text{c} = frac{mathrm{Re}_text{c} mu}{rho d}.  Research and development  = Computational fluid dynamics = These are turbulence models in which the Reynolds stresses, as obtained from a Reynolds averaging of the Navier–Stokes equations, are modelled by a linear constitutive relationship with the mean flow straining field, as: :-rho langle u_iu_jrangle = 2mu_tS_{i,j}-{2over3}rhokappadelta_{i,j} where :*mu_t is the coefficient termed turbulence \\"viscosity\\" (also called the eddy viscosity) :*kappa = tfrac1 2(langle u_1u_1rangle +langle u_2u_2rangle +langle u_3u_3rangle ) is the mean turbulent kinetic energy :*S_{i,j} is the mean strain rate : Note that that inclusion of tfrac2 3rhokappadelta_{i,j} in the linear constitutive relation is required by tensorial algebra purposes when solving for two-equation turbulence models (or any other turbulence model that solves a transport equation for kappa . = Hemodynamics = Hemodynamics is the study of blood flow in the circulatory system. Blood flow in straight sections of the arterial tree are typically laminar (high, directed wall stress), but branches and curvatures in the system cause turbulent flow. Turbulent flow in the arterial tree can cause a number of concerning effects, including atherosclerotic lesions, postsurgical neointimal hyperplasia, in-stent restenosis, vein bypass graft failure, transplant vasculopathy, and aortic valve calcification. Comparison of air flow around a smooth golf ball versus a dimpled golf ball. = Industrial processes = Lift and drag properties of golf balls are customized by the manipulation of dimples along the surface of the ball, allowing for the golf ball to travel further and faster in the air. The data from turbulent-flow phenomena has been used to model different transitions in fluid flow regimes, which are used to thoroughly mix fluids and increase reaction rates within industrial processes. = Fluid currents and pollution control = Oceanic and atmospheric currents transfer particles, debris, and organisms all across the globe. While the transport of organisms, such as phytoplankton, are essential for the preservation of ecosystems, oil and other pollutants are also mixed in the current flow and can carry pollution far from its origin. Eddy formations circulate trash and other pollutants into concentrated areas which researchers are tracking to improve clean-up and pollution prevention. The distribution and motion of plastics caused by eddy formations in natural water bodies can be predicted using Lagrangian transport models. Mesoscale ocean eddies play crucial roles in transferring heat poleward, as well as maintaining heat gradients at different depths. = Environmental flows = Modeling eddy development, as it relates to turbulence and fate transport phenomena, is vital in grasping an understanding of environmental systems. By understanding the transport of both particulate and dissolved solids in environmental flows, scientists and engineers will be able to efficiently formulate remediation strategies for pollution events. Eddy formations play a vital role in the fate and transport of solutes and particles in environmental flows such as in rivers, lakes, oceans, and the atmosphere. Upwelling in stratified coastal estuaries warrant the formation of dynamic eddies which distribute nutrients out from beneath the boundary layer to form plumes. Shallow waters, such as those along the coast, play a complex role in the transport of nutrients and pollutants due to the proximity of the upper-boundary driven by the wind and the lower-boundary near the bottom of the water body. :  Mesoscale ocean eddies  Downwind of obstacles, in this case, the alt=Eddies are common in the ocean, and range in diameter from centimeters to hundreds of kilometers. The smallest scale eddies may last for a matter of seconds, while the larger features may persist for months to years. Eddies that are between about 10 and 500 km (6.2 and 310.7 miles) in diameter and persist for periods of days to months are known in oceanography as mesoscale eddies. Mesoscale eddies can be split into two categories: static eddies, caused by flow around an obstacle (see animation), and transient eddies, caused by baroclinic instability. When the ocean contains a sea surface height gradient this creates a jet or current, such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This current as part of a baroclinically unstable system meanders and creates eddies (in much the same way as a meandering river forms an ox-bow lake). These types of mesoscale eddies have been observed in many of major ocean currents, including the Gulf Stream, the Agulhas Current, the Kuroshio Current, and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, amongst others. Mesoscale ocean eddies are characterized by currents that flow in a roughly circular motion around the center of the eddy. The sense of rotation of these currents may either be cyclonic or anticyclonic (such as Haida Eddies). Oceanic eddies are also usually made of water masses that are different from those outside the eddy. That is, the water within an eddy usually has different temperature and salinity characteristics to the water outside the eddy. There is a direct link between the water mass properties of an eddy and its rotation. Warm eddies rotate anti-cyclonically, while cold eddies rotate cyclonically. Because eddies may have a vigorous circulation associated with them, they are of concern to naval and commercial operations at sea. Further, because eddies transport anomalously warm or cold water as they move, they have an important influence on heat transport in certain parts of the ocean.

The OMG Automated Function Point (AFP) specification, led by the Consortium for IT Software Quality, provides a standard for automating the Function Point counting according to the guidelines of the International Function Point User Group (IFPUG) However, the current implementations of this standard have a limitation in being able to distinguish External Output (EO) from External Inquiries (EQ) out of the box, without some upfront configuration.OMG/CISQ Specification \\"Automated Function Points\\",February 2013, OMG Document Number ptc/2013-02-01 http://www.omg.org/spec/AFP/1.0  Introduction  Function points were defined in 1979 in Measuring Application Development Productivity by Allan Albrecht at IBM.A. J. Albrecht, \\"Measuring Application Development Productivity,\\" Proceedings of the Joint SHARE, GUIDE, and IBM Application Development Symposium, Monterey, California, October 14–17, IBM Corporation (1979), pp. 83–92. The functional user requirements of the software are identified and each one is categorized into one of five types: outputs, inquiries, inputs, internal files, and external interfaces. Once the function is identified and categorized into a type, it is then assessed for complexity and assigned a number of function points. Each of these functional user requirements maps to an end-user business function, such as a data entry for an Input or a user query for an Inquiry. This distinction is important because it tends to make the functions measured in function points map easily into user-oriented requirements, but it also tends to hide internal functions (e.g. algorithms), which also require resources to implement. There is currently no ISO recognized FSM Method that includes algorithmic complexity in the sizing result. Recently there have been different approaches proposed to deal with this perceived weakness, implemented in several commercial software products. The variations of the Albrecht-based IFPUG method designed to make up for this (and other weaknesses) include: * Early and easy function points – Adjusts for problem and data complexity with two questions that yield a somewhat subjective complexity measurement; simplifies measurement by eliminating the need to count data elements. * Engineering function points – Elements (variable names) and operators (e.g., arithmetic, equality/inequality, Boolean) are counted. This variation highlights computational function.Engineering Function Points and Tracking System, Software Technology Support Center , Retrieved on May 14, 2008 The intent is similar to that of the operator/operand-based Halstead complexity measures. * Bang measure – Defines a function metric based on twelve primitive (simple) counts that affect or show Bang, defined as \\"the measure of true function to be delivered as perceived by the user.\\" Bang measure may be helpful in evaluating a software unit's value in terms of how much useful function it provides, although there is little evidence in the literature of such application. The use of Bang measure could apply when re-engineering (either complete or piecewise) is being considered, as discussed in Maintenance of Operational Systems—An Overview. * Feature points – Adds changes to improve applicability to systems with significant internal processing (e.g., operating systems, communications systems). This allows accounting for functions not readily perceivable by the user, but essential for proper operation. * Weighted Micro Function Points – One of the newer models (2009) which adjusts function points using weights derived from program flow complexity, operand and operator vocabulary, object usage, and algorithm. *Fuzzy Function Points - Proposes a fuzzy and gradative transition between low x medium and medium x high complexities  Contrast  The use of function points in favor of lines of code seek to address several additional issues: * The risk of \\"inflation\\" of the created lines of code, and thus reducing the value of the measurement system, if developers are incentivized to be more productive. FP advocates refer to this as measuring the size of the solution instead of the size of the problem. * Lines of Code (LOC) measures reward low level languages because more lines of code are needed to deliver a similar amount of functionality to a higher level language.Jones, C. and Bonsignour O. The Economics of Software Quality, Addison-Wesley, 2012. pp. 105-109. C. Jones offers a method of correcting this in his work.Jones, C. Applied Software Measurement: Assuring Productivity and Quality. McGraw-Hill. June 1996. * LOC measures are not useful during early project phases where estimating the number of lines of code that will be delivered is challenging. However, Function Points can be derived from requirements and therefore are useful in methods such as estimation by proxy.  Criticism  Albrecht observed in his research that Function Points were highly correlated to lines of code,Albrecht, A. Software Function, Source Lines of Code, and Development Effort Estimation – A Software Science Validation. 1983. which has resulted in a questioning of the value of such a measure if a more objective measure, namely counting lines of code, is available. In addition, there have been multiple attempts to address perceived shortcomings with the measure by augmenting the counting regimen.Symons, C.R. \\"Function point analysis: difficulties and improvements.\\" IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

The prince-bishop of Münster Max Franz satisfied the wishes of some \\"Heuerleute\\", a kind of farmer, from the nearby village of Hesepe to settle down in the bog \\"Twist\\". This was the starting point of the settlement in Twist; to be more precise it starts at the street of houses which is nowadays called \\"Alt-Hesepertwist\\". The ground was at that time quite infertile because of its composition and did just allow a meager livelihood and so the people did not live in any comfort. The construction of the canal \\"Nord-Süd-Kanal\\" about 100 years later brought significant improvements in the quality of life of the people, because the canal allowed a systematic drainage and removal of the peat. In the 1950s the economic revival finally arrived on the one hand by finding larger oil deposits and on the other hand by commissioning of the production site of the Dutch plastics company Wavin. These two factors were over some decades the driving forces for the economical rise of Twist. In 1986 Twist celebrated its 200th anniversary. The anniversary festivities ended with a pageant which had respect to the history and current circumstances in Twist. For instance one of the numerous parade floats showed a detailed replica of the church St. Georg (biggest church in Twist). In the 1990s the two main columns of Twist's economy, oil production and the plastic production declined more and more; and economic hard times meant many people lost their jobs. With the finishing of the autobahn 31 at the end of the 1990s this negative development was stopped by siting new companies especially in the industrial area close to the autobahn. In August/September 2011 Twist celebrated its 225th anniversary. The 10-day-long festival started with a \\"Twist-Schau\\" (Twist Show). This show was performed like a play in Low German language and telling the history of Twist in a humorous way, with its good old times, but also the very hard living conditions of the first settlers, the loss of loved family members during WWII and the upcoming prosperity caused by the fast economic growth of the last 60 years that offers people of about 30 different nations a new home in Twist. One of the following days of the festival was themed as \\"Tag der Vereine\\" (Day of the Associations) presenting all sporting, cultural and welfare associations in Twist. It showed the wide range of activities for spare time and hobbies. Another motto of one of the festival days was \\"Twist macht Musik\\" (Twist plays music) where all choirs in Twist performed their songs and left the audience very impressed. Part of the festival were also concerts by Queen and Pink Floyd cover bands. The festival finally ended by presenting a pageant related to historical and present developments in Twist. Origin of the name The origin of the name of the municipality Twist has nothing to do with the dance style of the same title. Due to a long disagreement with the Dutch Kingdom about the way the border between both countries should take it was common language use to speak about \\"Twistrich\\" or \\"Twist Gebiet\\" (Twist area). In Low German \\"Twistrich\\" or \\"Twist Gebiet\\" has a meaning similar to \\"disputed border\\". This language was the official language at that time and is still partly in usage. The name is commonly mispronounced as locals pronounce it \\"Tweest\\".Ems Vechte Welle , published July 26, 2007 New research results from Jürgen Udolph, a known scientist in the fields of onomastics, shows that the name Twist probably has its origin in the words \\"twistel\\" in the meaning of \\"Zwiesel\\" or \\"Zweiung\\", that means something is at a bifurcation. In this meaning also words like \\"zwieträchtig\\", \\"twisten\\" and \\"in Zweispalt, Streit sein\\" (in English: discrepancy, dispute) belong to the explanation of the origin of the name Twist. The conclusion of Udolph is, that the name of Twist means something like \\"separated settlement, a place located at a (stream) bifurcation\\". Landmarks =Church St. Vinzenz von Paul zu Hebelermeer= The parish church in the district Heblermeer houses two rococo busts of Ignatius of Loyola and Francisco de Xavier created by the sculptor Johann Heinrich König (1705–1784). =Church St. Franziskus= In December 1928 the construction work on the church started. The architect Theo Burlage designed the church in the style of expressionism. One year after starting construction the first service in the church was celebrated on December 8, 1929. In August 1930 bishop Berning did consecrated the church. The altar crucifix was designed by Wolfdietrich Stein. With a height of 5 meters it fills the complete height and width of the sanctuary. The church spire has clock faces on three of its sides. Contrary to ordinary clock faces, these ones do not show numbers. The top figure is an Iron Cross with the date of 1914 and 1918 (duration of World War I). The other 33 figures on the clock faces are name tags with the names of the soldiers killed in action from the villages Schönighsdorf and Provinzialmoor. =Protestant church in Neuringe= An exceptional feature is the Protestant church in the district of Neuringe, because this church boasts one of the oldest and most valuable organs (constructed in 1719) of the Protestant national church. The church itself was constructed in 1904. As in many villages at that time, there was no money for both construction of the church and the buying of inventory. Therefore, a used organ was bought. Sometimes, as in this case, the used ones have a higher value nowadays than organs that were built in the 1900s. =Center of Twist= In the center of the municipality of Twist numerous retailers are located, such as grocery stores, a travel agency, a bank and so on. Also the city hall and the police station is situated in the center of Twist. A special attraction in the center is the museum for crude oil and natural gas (Erdöl-Erdgas-Museum Twist) and also the \\"Heimathaus Twist\\". The Heimathaus Twist is known for legendary blues, folk, and jazz concerts. =Landscape= In 2006 the German counties Emsland and Grafschaft Bentheim founded together with the Dutch province Drenthe the \\"Internationaler Naturpark Moor\\" (International Nature Park Bog) (wetlands). This park stretches across big parts of the municipality Twist. The park has a unique biota and is the wintering grounds for numerous migratory birds every year. Up to the settlement and cultivation in the 19th century, the area was one of the biggest peat moss areas in Europe with a size of more than 1,200 km². In recent years several projects have started to block ditches and generate a water logging of the area for renaturation. A very successful example for the renaturation in the nature park is the Dutch part of the park, where already in the 1960s first projects started and led to a fully restored peat moss area where very rare plants and animals found a new home. Recreational activity and culture = Culture = The \\"Heimathaus Twist\\" is a reconstructed old farm house located in the center of Twist. It is known for blues and folk concerts which also take place several times a year. However, several events especially for children are also organized by the team of the \\"Heimathaus Twist\\". Directly beside the \\"Heimathaus Twist\\" the museum for crude oil and natural gas is located. It shows several exhibits on this topic and the historical development of the extraction of crude oil and natural gas. The crude oil and natural gas industry has a long history in the area of Twist for this reason it was sometimes also called the German Texas. =Recreational activity= In every district of Twist there are several sport clubs where soccer is the dominant sport, but basketball, table-tennis, competitive dance, horseback riding, swimming, tennis, handball and gymnastics are also offered.

Hence families with two or three children get a special concession on a building land for a one-family house. Families with four children get a building site for free. For this rule limited in time (till 31 December 2009) children count who are younger than 15 years and born the first 10 years after purchase. Economy and Infrastructure = Traffic = By car Twist has a direct connection to the Autobahn 31 which acts as north-south route between the North Sea and the Ruhr. Twist is also connected to Europastraße 233 which is constructed on German side like an Autobahn to the connection point with Autobahn 31 and on Dutch side it already has the status as Autobahn A 37. This Europastraße (E 233) connects the metropolis Rotterdam, Amsterdam with Hamburg and finally Scandinavia. On the German side it's intended over the next years to follow the Dutch side and to convert the road over the whole distance into an Autobahn. Air traffic The closest international airport is Münster Osnabrück International Airport in the German city Greven. The airport is about 90 km away from Twist and easy to reach by using the Autobahn 31 and later changing to Autobahn 30. Düsseldorf is the closest international hub for intercontinental flights. The distance to the airport is approximately 170 km (1,5 hours by car) and for the whole travel distance it is possible to use the Autobahn. Düsseldorf Airport can be reached directly on the Autobahn 31 and later, after changing to Autobahn 44, leaving at the exit airport (Ausfahrt Flughafen). Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is another airport close by. The airport is about 200 km away and easy to reach on the Dutch high-speed road network. The Dutch \\"Autobahn\\" A 37 starts in Twist and for the whole distance to the airport an Autobahn can be used. =Economy= Till the middle of the nineteen-nineties the crude oil, natural gas, and peat industry dominated the economy in Twist. Especially in these industries many employees lost their job at that time. Since then many small and medium size business companies have settled down in the area of Twist especially in the industrial park at the autobahn. The biggest employer in Twist is the Dutch company Wavin. This company is European market leader for plastic pipe systems. =Tourism= In recent years tourism has also become an important factor, where the focus of tourism is on the district of Neuringe. In addition to several holiday flats there is also a campground with a public lake for bathing and a farm for horseback riding. Especially this farm theme park enjoys great popularity among the younger guests. Furthermore, within the area of this farm is an indoor children's playground which is especially suitable for children up to the age of 12. Education In Twist there are 5 grade schools and one junior high. After a bigger replacement and newly constructed building in 2007, this junior high acts nowadays as full-time school. In 2009 the grade schools were also transformed into all day schools. By carrying out modernisation at the schools it is guaranteed nowadays that the students get a warm meal and are supervised throughout the day.

SensorML provides standard models and an XML encoding for describing sensors and measurement processes. SensorML can be used to describe a wide range of sensors, including both dynamic and stationary platforms and both in-situ and remote sensors. Functions supported include * sensor discovery * sensor geolocation * processing of sensor observations * a sensor programming mechanism * subscription to sensor alerts Examples of supported sensors are * stationary, in-situ – chemical “sniffer”, thermometer, gravity meter * stationary, remote – stream velocity profiler, atmospheric profiler, Doppler radar * dynamic, in- situ – aircraft mounted ozone “sniffer”, GPS unit, dropsonde * dynamic, remote – satellite radiometer, airborne camera, soldier-mounted video  What is it?  SensorML provides standard models and an XML encoding for describing any process, including the process of measurement by sensors and instructions for deriving higher-level information from observations. It provides a provider- centric view of information in a sensor web, which is complemented by Observations and Measurements which provides a user-centric view. Processes described in SensorML are discoverable and executable. All processes define their inputs, outputs, parameters, and method, as well as provide relevant metadata. SensorML models detectors and sensors as processes that convert real phenomena to data. SensorML does not encode measurements taken by sensors; measurements can be represented in TransducerML, as observations in Observations and Measurements, or in other forms, such as IEEE 1451.  What is it good for?  Electronic Specification Sheet - In its simplest application, SensorML can be used to provide a standard digital means of providing specification sheets for sensor components and systems. Discovery of sensor, sensor systems, and processes - SensorML is a means by which sensor systems or processes can make themselves known and discoverable. SensorML provides a rich collection of metadata that can be mined and used for discovery of sensor systems and observation processes. This metadata includes identifiers, classifiers, constraints (time, legal, and security), capabilities, characteristics, contacts, and references, in addition to inputs, outputs, parameters, and system location. Lineage of Observations - SensorML can provide a complete and unambiguous description of the lineage of an observation. In other words, it can describe in detail the process by which an observation came to be .... from acquisition by one or more detectors to processing and perhaps even interpretation by an analyst. Not only can this provide a confidence level with regard to an observation, in most cases, part or all of the process could be repeated, perhaps with some modifications to the process or by simulating the observation with a known signature source. On-demand processing of Observations - Process chains for geolocation or higher-level processing of observations can be described in SensorML, discovered and distributed over the web, and executed on-demand without a prior knowledge of the sensor or processor characteristics. This was the original driver for SensorML, as a means of countering the proliferation of disparate, stovepipe systems for processing sensor data within various sensor communities. SensorML also enables the distribution of processing to any point within the sensor chain, from sensor to data center to the individual user's PDA. SensorML enables this processing without the need for sensor-specific software. Support for tasking, observation, and alert services - SensorML descriptions of sensor systems or simulations can be mined in support of establishing OGC Sensor Observation Services (SOS), Sensor Planning Services (SPS), and Sensor Alert Services (SAS). SensorML defines and builds on common data definitions that are used throughout the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) framework. Plug-N-Play, auto-configuring, and autonomous sensor networks - SensorML enables the development of plug-n-play sensors, simulations, and processes, which may be seamlessly added to Decision Support systems. The self-describing characteristic of SensorML-enabled sensors and processes also supports the development of auto-configuring sensor networks, as well as the development of autonomous sensor networks in which sensors can publish alerts and tasks to which other sensors can subscribe and react. Archiving of Sensor Parameters - Finally, SensorML provides a mechanism for archiving fundamental parameters and assumptions regarding sensors and processes, so that observations from these systems can still be reprocessed and improved long after the origin mission has ended. This is proving to be critical for long- range applications such as global change monitoring and modeling.  What are the essential elements?  Component - Physical atomic process that transforms information from one form to another. For example, a Detector typically transforms a physical property or phenomenon to a digital number. Example Components include detectors, actuators, and physical filters. System - Composite physically based model of a group or array of components, which can include detectors, actuators, or sub-systems. A System relates a Process Chain to the real world and therefore provides additional definitions regarding relative positions of its components and communication interfaces. Process Model - Atomic non-physical processing block usually used within a more complex Process Chain. It is associated to a Process Method which defines the process interface as well as how to execute the model. It also precisely defines its own inputs, outputs and parameters. Process Chain - Composite non- physical processing block consisting of interconnected sub-processes, which can in turn be Process Models or Process Chains. A process chain also includes possible data sources as well as connections that explicitly link input and output signals of sub-processes together. It also precisely defines its own inputs, outputs and parameters. Process Method - Definition of the behavior and interface of a Process Model. It can be stored in a library so that it can be reused by different Process Model instances (by using 'xlink' mechanism). It essentially describes the process interface and algorithm, and can point the user to existing implementations. Detector - Atomic component of a composite Measurement System defining sampling and response characteristic of a simple detection device. A detector has only one input and one output, both being scalar quantities. More complex Sensors such as a frame camera which are composed of multiple detectors can be described as a detector group or array using a System or Sensor. In SensorML a detector is a particular type of Process Model. Sensor - Specific type of System representing a complete Sensor. This could be for example a complete airborne scanner which includes several Detectors (one for each band).  How did it come about?  In 1998, under the auspices of the international Committee for Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), Dr. Mike Botts began development of an XML-based Sensor Model Language for describing the geometric, dynamic, and radiometric properties of dynamic remote sensors. Initial development was funded under a NASA AIST Program, and in 2000, SensorML was brought under the oversight of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) where it served as a catalyst for the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) initiative. SensorML design has benefited greatly from the interactions of members of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement Working Group. The continued development of SensorML has been supported by the Interoperability Program of OGC, as well as the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the US National GeoSpatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), the US Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC), the US Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), SAIC, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, Oak Ridge National Labs, and NASA.

It was administrated by the United Nations Environmental Programme. Background The short-lived Centre was created to respond to an initiative proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s. UNEP Governing Council “... decided to establish the Centre at the beginning of 1992 for a period of eighteen month”. Its operations were initially run by a small staff located in a Swiss government office in Geneva, Switzerland. Later, it was relocated to offices inside the International Environment House, found in Châtelaine. The Centre collaborated with national focal points, with the perspective of “act[ing] primarily as a broker between assisting countries and affected countries”. The information requested by the Centre listing national capabilities regarding emergency environmental assistance were directly stored on then Lotus Development Corporation's Lotus Note, supported by a Netware server. These “resources were tested in a simulation exercise carried out in Tunisia in February 1993. The exercise demonstrated that the Centre can act as an effective broker between a State requesting assistance, and potential donor countries and that cooperation with other United Nations agencies partners is feasible.” “As regards mechanisms for dealing with requests for assistance, the Centre has prepared its own internal contingency plan, which has been tested on two occasions.” However, it never received necessary support due to criticism that it overlapped with already-existing agencies, like the International Maritime Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

It aims to widen access and foster care for architectural and environmental heritage. These events are also known as Doors Open Days and Open Doors Days in English-speaking countries. The event began in France in 1984, with La Journée portes ouvertes dans les monuments historiques, sponsored by the Ministry of Culture. In 1985, in Granada, at the 2nd European Conference of Ministers responsible for Architectural Heritage, the French Minister of Culture proposed that the project be internationalised under the Council of Europe. The Netherlands held their first Open Monumentendag in 1987. Sweden and the Republic of Ireland joined in 1989, and Belgium and Scotland in 1990. In 1991 these events were united as European Heritage Days at the initiative of the Council of Europe, supported by the EU. By 2010, 50 signatory states of the European Cultural Convention had joined the EHDs. The most recent European Heritage Days event was hosted by Armenia in September 2019.

There are also two native Irish surnames which were anglicised into Cox. An early record of the surname dates from 1556 with the marriage of Alicea Cox at St. Martin in the Fields, Westminster, London. Cox is the 69th-most common surname in the United Kingdom. Retrieved 25 January 2014 Origin One possibility of the origin is that it is a version of the Old English cocc which means \\"the little\\", and was sometimes put after the name of a leader or chieftain as a term of endearment. Surnames such as Wilcox, Willcocks and Willcox are examples of this practice: all are composed of the name William and the archaic word cocc, coming together to mean \\"little William\\". The suggestion is that only the element -cox may have endured as a surname for some families. Another opinion is that the name is derived from the Old English cock, which means a \\"heap\\" or \\"mound\\", and was a topographic name for a man living near any heap, hill or other bundle. Names like Haycock or Haycox come from such practice, meaning from \\"the hay mounds\\" or \\"the hay fields\\". Again, the element -cox may have only been carried on in some families. The third possibility is that it comes from the Welsh coch, meaning \\"red\\". In this opinion, the word could have either been applied to a man with red hair, calling him in essence \\"the Red\\", or else served as a topographic name for someone living near the ruddy-hued hills found in Wales, implying that the man is \\"from the red hills\\". In Cornwall, the surnames Cock and Couch (pronounced 'cooch') also derive from Cornish cogh \\"red, scarlet\\". As a Cornish surname, Cock can also derive from 'cok', \\"fishing boat\\", the Cornish surname \\"Cocking\\" being the diminutive form 'cokyn', \\"small fishing boat\\". In these cases, the surname is likely to derive from occupation. The English word \\"cock\\", meaning \\"rooster\\", is derived from the Anglo-Saxon word cocc, and a fourth possibility is that the surname came about as a nickname. Another possibility is that the name is of Norman origin. In the Battle of Hastings in October 1066, Alric Le Coq was one of Duke William's companions. Alric was said to have been a \\"a strutting {as a rooster struts} Norman soldier ... who was nicknamed 'le coq' and his children 'little cockes.'\\" Le Coq could easily have been Anglicized to Cox as seen in the previous possibility. The surname Cox is also native to Belgian and Dutch Limburg. This name, like the related Cockx, is a degenerate form of Cocceius, a latinization of Kok (English: cook).Cox at the Meertens Institute database of surnames in the Netherlands Noticeably similar surnames include Cock, Cocks, Coxe, Coxen and Coxon. There is no evidence beyond similar spellings and phonetics that these surnames are related. Given that the origins of the Cox surname are uncertain, it is possible that these names developed as spelling variations, or that each of these names has an origin in a separate word and language. The origins of the surname in North America are speculated across several written accounts, with most sources pointing toward three distinct families arriving from England in the 17th and 18th Centuries: in 1690, brothers Thomas, William, and Walter Cocke originally of Surry; in 1705, the family of Dr. Wilham Cocke of Williamsburg; and at an unknown time before 1658, Nicholas Cocke of Middlesex.https://archive.org/stream/coxfamilyinamer00coxgoog/coxfamilyinamer00coxgoog_djvu.txt Notable people * Alan Cox (born 1968), leader in Linux * Alan Cox (radio personality) (born 1971), American radio personality * Alan Cox (actor) (born 1970), Anglo-Scottish actor * Alex Cox (born 1954), film director * Allan V.

Thomas Augustine Harris was born in West Derby, a suburb of Liverpool, and was educated at St. Cecilia's Primary School and St. Francis Xavier's College, both in Liverpool. In 1933, he went to the Liverpool Archdiocesan Seminary at St Joseph's College, Upholland (which is no longer in existence) to study for the priesthood. On 30 May 1942, he was ordained by Archbishop Downey. After six months as a curate at St Oswald's Church, Old Swan, Liverpool, he then served at St Elizabeth's, Litherland (1943 to 1952), and then as Chaplain at Walton Prison. During his time at St Elizabeth's he had an active Y.C.W. group and was chaplain to the local Catholic Social Guild. He was the English representative to the International Council of Senior Roman Catholic Prison Chaplains from 1957 to 1966. He was a member of the Vatican Delegation to the United Nations' Quinquennial Congress on Crime in London (1960) and Stockholm (1965). Throughout his life, Bishop Harris maintained a personal interest in criminology and published a number of articles in this field. On 11 February 1966, Augustine Harris was consecrated Bishop of Socia and Auxiliary Bishop of Liverpool by Archbishop George Beck in the crypt of the then unfinished Metropolitan Cathedral. A few months later Archbishop Beck had a severe heart attack, so the new bishop had to carry the administration of the largest archdiocese in the country, and the preparations for the imminent opening of the Metropolitan Cathedral. Harris was the principal consecrator of the Cathedral during Archbishop Beck's infirmity. As the first Roman Catholic Cathedral to be built in the 20th century in England, the event attracted international importance; it was featured on European TV. On 20 November 1978, Msgr. Harris was appointed as Bishop of Middlesbrough. It was Pope John Paul II's first episcopal appointment in the British Isles. Among his many projects in Middlesbrough diocese, Bishop Harris carried out a major reorganisation of Catholic schools and established four diocesan pastoral centres which have responsibility for assisting the renewal of parish community life. As Bishop, he produced pamphlets including This Decade is Forever for the Decade of Evangelisation, and Serve the Lord with Gladness (his own personal motto) as a reflection of his years in the priesthood. Bishop Harris acted very much in the ecumenical spirit engendered by Vatican II. While in Liverpool there were instances of his approval of Catholic priests assisting at the baptism of children of mixed confessional identity in Anglican churches with the baptism then registered of parish churches of both confessions. He consecrated Middlesbrough's Cathedral in 1998 which incorporated many of his suggestions to the architect on the church design. In 1980 he promoted a free monthly diocesan newspaper, The Catholic Voice, which, as of 2009, continues to be published and distributed. Bishop Harris served as liaison Bishop between the Bishops' Conference of England and Wales and the Prison Department at the Home Office, was Episcopal Moderator to the Federation Internationale des Associations Medicales Catholiques (1967 to 1976), and was President of the Commission for Social Welfare (1972 to 1984). He was Episcopal Chairman of the Commission for Radio and Television, President of UNDA (the Catholic broadcasters' association) in England and Wales, and a member of CRAC, the religious advisory body for the IBA and BBC. Bishop Harris had a variety of broadcasting experience, including a series of appearances for Terry Wogan's BBC Radio 2 programme in 1974. On 16 October 2003, he led a live broadcast of \\"Morning Worship\\" on BBC Radio 4 to celebrate the Silver Jubilee of Pope John Paul II. In May 2007 he recorded a special half-hour programme for BBC Radio Merseyside on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King, Liverpool. He was Chairman of the Department for Christian Responsibility and Citizenship. In his retirement he continued to write a regular column in the Liverpool Catholic Pictorial. In January 1992, Pope John Paul II accepted Bishop Harris' resignation, tendered in anticipation of his 75th birthday in October 1992 (75 is the statutory retirement age for bishops). The resignation was accepted and Bishop Harris remained in office until his successor, Bishop John Crowley, was appointed in November 1992. In his retirement Bishop Harris returned to his native Liverpool where he continued to serve the Church and administer the sacraments. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of his ordination as bishop, on 11 February 2006, Bishop Harris concelebrated Mass with Bishop John Crowley, his successor in Middlesbrough, and Msgr. Ricardo Morgan, at the time the Vicar General of the Diocese of Middlesbrough, in the chapel at Ince Blundell Hall where he has resided for the past few years. On 22 June 2006, the formal celebration of this event was held in the Liverpool's Metropolitan Cathedral where Bishop Harris was joined by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, as well as, the Papal Nuncio, and twenty bishops, along with priests and lay people from the Liverpool and Middlesbrough dioceses. The homily was preached on that occasion by Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor. In retirement Harris lived in Formby, and later at Ince Blundell Hall, where he died on 30 August 2007, aged 89.

The purpose of the phrase is to alert a driver of a vehicle approaching from behind to sound their horn in case they wish to overtake. On April 30, 2015, the Government of Maharashtra banned the use of \\"Horn OK Please\\" on the rear side of commercial vehicles, on the grounds that it encourages motorists to honk unnecessarily and leads to noise pollution. Signage on the rear side of commercial vehicles, such as trucks and tempos, across Maharashtra is a gross violation of Section 134 (1) of the Maharashtra Motor Vehicle Rules, which deals with signage to be used on the rear and sides of vehicles. Bal Malkit Singh, a former president of the All India Motor Transport Congress, welcomed the ban stating that the phrase was required in the past when the roads were narrow; on modern wide roads and multi-lane highways, the drivers could use lights and indicators to overtake other vehicles.

History Passenger services from Aslockton started on 15 July 1850, when the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway opened its extension from Nottingham to Grantham. This was taken over by the Great Northern Railway.Kingscott, G., (2004) Lost Railways of Nottinghamshire, Newbury: Countryside Books The station building designed by Thomas Chambers Hine was opened by the Great Northern Railway in 1857. On 12 October 1868 a goods train departed Nottingham at 4.15 am. It split near Aslockton station when one of the coupling chains broke. The driver shunted on to the down line, and whilst getting back upon the up line another goods train from Grantham ran into it. The driver of the train from Grantham, Smalley Hutchinson was killed, and the fireman severely injured. On 31 December 1904, George Skillington, aged 78, was killed on the line at Aslockton by a light engine. The station became part of the London and North Eastern Railway under the Grouping of 1923. On 23 July 1933 an excursion train from Skegness to Nottingham crashed through the level crossing gates at Aslockton. On 1 August 1937, a nine-year-old boy, Ernest Love of Sneinton, Nottingham, fell from a Nottingham to Mablethorpe excursion train at Aslockton and was killed.

Specific religious views =Abrahamic religions= Baháʼí Faith Bahá'u'lláh, founder of the Baháʼí Faith, taught that God created humans due to his love for them, and thus humans should in turn love God. \`Abdu'l-Bahá, Bahá'u'lláh's son, wrote that love is the greatest power in the world of existence and the true source of eternal happiness. The Baháʼí teachings state that all genuine love is divine, and that love proceeds from God and from humans. God's love is taught to be part of his own essence, and his love for his creatures gives them their material existence, divine grace and eternal life. The Baháʼí teachings state that human love is directed towards both God and other humans; that the love of God attracts the individual toward God, by purifying the human heart and preparing it for the revelation of divine grace. Thus through the love of God, humans become transformed and become self-sacrificing. It is also stated that true love for other humans occurs when people see the beauty of God in other people's souls. The Baháʼí teachings state that Baháʼís should love all humans regardless of religion, race or community, and also should love their enemies. Christian Most Christians also believe that God is the source and essence of eternal love, even if in the New Testament the expression \\"God is love\\" explicitly occurs only twice and in two not too distant verses: 1 John (NIV). Most Christians believe that the greatest commandment is \\"thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment\\"; in addition to the second, \\"thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself\\", these are what Jesus Christ called the two greatest commandments (see Mark 12:28–34, Luke 10:25–28, Matthew 22:37–39, Matthew 7:12; cf. Deuteronomy 6:5, Deuteronomy 11:13, Deuteronomy 11:22, Leviticus 19:18, Leviticus 19:34). See also Ministry of Jesus#General ethics. In the Gospel of John, Jesus said: \\"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.\\" (NIV, John 13:34–35; cf. John 15:17). Jesus also taught \\"Love your enemies.\\" (Matthew 5:44, Luke 6:27). The New Testament, which was written in Greek, only used two Greek words for love: agapē and philia. However, there are several Greek words for love. *Agapē. In the New Testament, agapē is charitable, selfless, altruistic, and unconditional. It is parental love seen as creating goodness in the world, it is the way God is seen to love humanity, and it is seen as the kind of love that Christians aspire to have for others. *Philia. Also used in the New Testament, philia is a human response to something that is found to be delightful. Also known as \\"brotherly love\\". *Eros (sexual love) is never used in the New Testament but is more prominent in the Old Testament. *Storge (needy child-to-parent love) only appears in the compound word philostorgos (Rom 12:10). Saint Paul glorifies agapē in the quote above from 1 Corinthians 13, and as the most important virtue of all: \\"Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away.\\" (13:8 NIV). Christians believe that because of God's agapē for humanity He sacrificed his Son for them. John the Apostle wrote, \\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.\\" (John 3:16–17 KJV) In Works of Love (1847), Søren Kierkegaard, a philosopher, claimed that Christianity is unique because love is a requirement. Regarding love for enemies, Jesus is quoted in the Gospel of Matthew chapter five: “You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” - Matthew 5: 43-48'' Tertullian wrote regarding love for enemies: “Our individual, extraordinary, and perfect goodness consists in loving our enemies. To love one's friends is common practice, to love one's enemies only among Christians.” =Latter-day Saints= According to Russell M. Nelson, there are examples of the love of Jesus in the Book of Mormon. First there is a covenant with Christ. King Benjamin stated in the Book of Mosiah: Then there are the ordinances of the gospel. Jesus stated in the Book of Mormon in Third Nephi: And at last Jesus exhorts us to follow his example: Moroni, the last prophet of the book, wrote about love: =Unificationism= The concept of True Love is the most central part of Unificationist theology:MAPPING KNOWLEDGE: THE UNIFICATION ENCYCLOPEDIA PROJECT\\" Islam In the Sahih Muslim Hadith, the Prophet Muhammad is reported to have said: “You will not enter paradise until you believe, and you will not believe until you love to the other muslim what you love to your self.” Muslims are directed by Allah ('God') in the ways to become close to Him and how to gain His love. God loves those who: *do good. *are pure and clean. *are righteous. *are just and act rightly. *trust Him. *are patient and persevering. *love Him and follow the Prophet. *fight in His cause. The Qur'an also says that God loved Moses, and God Himself will produce people He will love. Here in this selection of verses we notice again the Arabic preference for the negative to state an opposite. While the following do not state that God hates, it certainly enforces the idea that the love of God is withheld from those who practice certain deeds or are described as manifesting a certain character. Several of the verses are repetitious and so we have the following categories. God does not love: *the mua'tadeen, those who overstep boundaries or limits. *the fasideen, those who spread corruption or mischief. *the kafireen, the unbelievers. *the dalemeen, the wrongdoers or oppressors. *the musarifeen, the wasteful. *the proud and boastful. *those who boast in their riches. *the treacherous. *those who are given to crime and to evil speaking. =Ahmadiyya= According to the Ahmadi Muslims, love of the creatures of God is essential for all Muslims. Ahmadi Muslims express that the Qur'an was sent as a gift to mankind, and its teachings are filled with love, tolerance and respect. The founder of the Ahmadiyya sect in Islam, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad said: > The task for which God has appointed me is that I should remove the malaise > that afflicts the relationship between God and His creatures and restore the > relationship of love and sincerity between them. Through the proclamation of > truth and by putting an end to religious conflicts, I should bring about > peace and manifest the Divine verities that have become hidden from the eyes > of the world. I am called upon to demonstrate spirituality which lies buried > under egoistic darkness. It is for me to demonstrate by practice, and not by > words alone, the Divine powers which penetrate into a human being and are > manifested through prayer or attention. Above all, it ismy task to re- > establish in people’s hearts the eternal plant of the pure and shining Unity > of God which is free from every impurity of polytheism, and which has now > completely disappeared. All this will be accomplished, not through my power, > but through the power of the Almighty God, Who is the God of heaven and > earth. Jewish In Hebrew Ahava is the most Commonly used term for both interpersonal love of family and love of God. Other related but dissimilar terms are chen (grace, good will, kindness) and chesed (kindness, love), which basically combines the meaning of \\"affection\\" and \\"compassion\\" and is sometimes rendered in English as \\"loving-kindness\\" or \\"steadfast love.\\" As for love between marital partners, this is deemed an essential ingredient to life: \\"See life with the wife you love\\" (Ecclesiastes 9:9). The Biblical book Song of Songs is considered a romantically-phrased metaphor of love between God and his people, but in its plain reading reads like a love song. =Indian religions= Buddhist In Buddhism, kama is sensuous, love. The vast majority believe it to be an obstacle on the path to enlightenment, perceiving it as selfish. Karuṇā is compassion and mercy, which reduces the suffering of others. It is complementary to wisdom, and is necessary for enlightenment. Adveṣa and maitrī are benevolent love. This love is unconditional and requires considerable self-acceptance. This is quite different from common conceptions of love which are often confused with attachment and sexual desire, and can be self-interested. Instead, in Buddhism it refers to detachment and unselfish interest in others' welfare. The bodhisattva ideal in Tibetan Buddhism involves the complete renunciation of oneself in order to take on the burden of a suffering world. The strongest motivation one has in order to take the path of the bodhisattva is the idea of salvation within unselfish love for others. Hindu In Hinduism, kāma is pleasurable, personified by the god Kama. For many Hindu schools it is the third end in life. In contrast to kāma, prema or prem refers to elevated love. Love in Hinduism is sacrament. It preaches that one gives up selfishness in love, not expecting anything in return. It also believes \\"God is love\\". A sacred text named Kanda Guru Kavasa quotes, \\" Oh holy Great flame, Grant me with love.. You said the spreading love is Para Brahma, For the thing which is everywhere is only Love, And Love is the only thing which is like a soul within us, Love is Kumara, Love is Kanda\\" This simply means Love is God. The love of the Hindu deity Krishna with Radha and many other gopis (milkmaids) of Vrindavana is highly revered. His amorous dance with the gopis became known as the Rasa lila and were romanticised in the poetry of Jayadeva, the author of Gita Govinda. These became important as part of the development of the Krishna bhakti traditions worshiping Radha Krishna. Sikhism In Sikhism, love means love for the Lord and His creation. This is one of five virtues vigorously promoted by the Sikh Gurus. The other four qualities in the arsenal are truth (sat), contentment (santokh), compassion (daya), and humility (nimrata). These five qualities are essential for a Sikh and it is their duty to meditate on and recite the Gurbani so that these virtues become a part of their mindset. Love is a positive and powerful tool in the Sikh's arsenal of virtues. When one's mind is full of love, one will overlook deficiencies in others and accept them wholeheartedly as a product of God. Sikhism asks all believers to take on godlike virtues, and this perhaps is the most godlike characteristic of all. Gurbani teaches that Waheguru is a \\"loving God\\" full of compassion and kindness. It is the duty of the Sikh to take on qualities of this nature and to easily forgive, never hate anyone, and live in Waheguru's Hukam and practise compassion and humility. In the Dasam Granth, it is stated on ang 40 that \\"he, who is absorbed in True Love, he would realize the Lord.\\" =Polytheist religions= Different cultures have deified love in male and female forms. (Although in monotheistic religions the supreme being is believed to represent love, there are often angels or similar beings that represent love as well.) Below is a list of gods and goddesses of love. * Áine, goddess of fertility and passionate love in Irish mythology * Eros or Cupid, god of passionate love in Roman mythology * Antheia, goddess in Crete mythology of love, flowers, gardens, and marshes * Aonghus or Aengus, god of beauty, youth, and sensual love in Irish mythology * Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and passionate love in Greek mythology * Astarte, goddess of love in Canaanite mythology * Eros, god of passionate love in Greek mythology * Freyja, goddess of love, fertility and war in Norse mythology * Hathor, goddess of love in Ancient Egyptian religion * Inanna, goddess of sexual love in Sumerian religion * Ishtar, goddess of love and war in Babylonian mythology * Kama, god of sensual love in Hindu mythology * Mihr, spirit of love in Persian mythology * Rati, goddess of passionate love in Hindu mythology * Venus, goddess of beauty and passionate love in Roman mythology * Xochipilli, god in Aztec mythology See also *Love *Love of God *Love (scientific views) Sources * Notes External links *Love in Judaism *God and Love in Islam *Definition of Biblical Love in Christianity * Spiritual methods to help one practice loving God *A Definition of Love and Light Religion Submitted by a Love and Light Religion Church Philosophy of love Love Point of view ","title":"Religious views on love"},{"id":"4318843","text":"Gobiopsis atrata, the New Zealand black goby, is a species of goby endemic to the marine waters around northern New Zealand where it occurs in tide pools and on reefs down to depths of about .

It is mostly two lanes each way with frequent climbing lanes between Dortmund-Hafen and the Gambacher Kreuz intersection. In March 2013 30 people were injured in a pile-up on the A45.  History  During the 1960s and 1970s a southward extension was proposed as the „Odenwald-Neckar-Alb-Autobahn“ (ONAA), to pass through Groß-Umstadt, Michelstadt, Schwaigern, Neckarwestheim, Mundelsheim, Berglen, Remshalden, Lichtenwald and Schlierbach, linking the ONAA to the A 8 near Kirchheim unter Teck, however the project was abandoned for ecological reasons in 1979 by the state government of Baden-Württemberg.  Trajectory  The A 45 branches off the A 2 at the Dortmund Nord-West intersection, passes through the eastern Ruhr area and enters the Sauerland near Hagen.

People of all ages and genders may be affected. Presentation Patients will experience a hyperthyroid period as the cellular lining of colloid spaces fails, allowing abundant colloid into the circulation, with neck pain and fever. Patients typically then become hypothyroid as the pituitary reduces TSH production and the inappropriately released colloid is depleted before resolving to euthyroid. The symptoms are those of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. In addition, patients may suffer from painful dysphagia. There are multi-nucleated giant cells on histology. Thyroid antibodies can be present in some cases. The clinical presentation during the hyperthyroid phase can mimic those of Diffuse Toxic Goiter or Graves' disease. In such cases, a radionuclide thyroid uptake and scan can be helpful, since subacute thyroiditis will result in decreased isotope uptake, while Graves' disease will generally result in increased uptake. Distinguishing between these two types of disease is important, since Graves' disease and Diffuse Toxic Goiter can be treated with radioiodine therapy, but subacute thyroiditis is usually self-limited and is not treated with radioiodine. Causes Some cases may be viral in origin, perhaps preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection. Viral causes include Coxsackie virus, mumps and adenoviruses. Some cases develop postpartum . Physiopathology In the initial phase of damage to the gland, preformed thyroid hormone will 'fall out' of the damaged cells. This leads to symptoms and biochemistry of an overactive thyroid (feels hot, trembly, anxious, loses weight, fast heart rate, sweaty, greasy hair), with raised free T3 and free T4, and a suppressed thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) value. The damaged cells will no longer be able to take up iodine in order to manufacture further supplies of thyroid hormone, and thus in due course the patient comes to experience the symptoms of an underactive thyroid (feels cold, tired, depressed, gains weight, dry skin and hair) with low free T3 and free T4, and eventually increased TSH. Diagnosis With the standard overactive thyroid, iodine uptake into the thyroid is avid, whereas if the cells are damaged, then uptake is poor. In this way, if there is doubt about whether the patient has too much thyroid hormone because of de Quervain's thyroiditis, then measuring radio-iodine uptake or technetium uptake gives a clear cut answer as it will be higher than normal in standard thyrotoxicosis and lower than normal in de Quervain's. Treatment Treatment is beta blockers, aspirin, and NSAIDs (or corticosteroids if NSAIDs are ineffective). Eponym It is named for Fritz de Quervain. It should not be confused with De Quervain syndrome. Terminology It is sometimes called subacute thyroiditis, but there are other forms of subacute thyroiditis, subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, postpartum thyroiditis, and autoimmune thyroiditis all of which, in contrast to de Quervain's, are typically painless or \\"silent\\". It is also sometimes called \\"painful subacute thyroiditis\\". This is in contrast to subacute lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is also sometimes called \\"painless thyroiditis\\".

The main considerations were the rising cost of coal against diesel oil and the weight of the trains causing wear and tear on the track. In looking to the dieselisation of their system the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) made early inroads with small, lightweight diesel units, based on those built for the Great Western Railway in England, using the same manufacturers to supply parts and undertaking construction in their own workshops. History AEC (Associated Equipment Company Limited) of Southall, London were a well known bus chassis, engine and body builders responsible for many types of London's famous red buses. They also provided engines for many diesel railcars built for, or by, the Great Western Railway and later British Railways. In the early 1950s, with dieselisation being undertaken on the GNR(I) and the UTA systems, their products were supplied to both companies. In August 1951 UTA's York Road works outshopped two new power cars which, following on the first diesel acquisitions, were numbered 6 and 7. They lasted well, 15 July 1966 seeing their last recorded working, after which they were not used again, although not officially withdrawn. On the formation of NIR they were included in the stock transferred over, to be officially withdrawn in December 1968. To increase capacity the unit ran with coach 279, as a centre trailer car, which was converted to work with this set. It became 528 in 1958. At the same time, (1950/1), AEC were also responsible for power cars supplied to the GNR(I) and on the division of stock of that company in 1958 ten of these entered the UTA lists. Numbered from 111 to 120 inclusive they were, in order, originally GNR(I) No's. 603/602/607/606/611/610/615/614/619/618. Trailers from these railcars were converted from existing GNR steam coaches and retained their GNR numbers (Except vehicles 8 and 9, later UTA 585+586, which were built new as AEC driving trailers). Those that were acquired by UTA became 554 555 580 581 582 585 586 593 (The gaps being due to their numbering in the same series as BUT trailers). Kitchen Car 166 was converted to an AEC trailer in 1967 and retained its number Withdrawal All NIR AEC railcars were withdrawn by 1972. The last set in service was 114-586-115 stopped in September of that year No's 6 & 7 were involved in the Lisburn accident on 5 February 1963 (which also involved Class WT, No.2) and were sent to Dunluce Street for repairs. Technically, and theoretically, No's. 6 and 7 were compatible with 111 - 120 but never ran with them.

Doors Open Days promotes architecture and heritage sites to a wider audience within and beyond the country's borders. It is an opportunity to discover hidden architectural gems and to see behind doors that are rarely open to the public for free. Open Doors Days trace their origin to the 1990 Door Open Day held as part of Glasgow's year as European City of Culture.  Heritage Open Days in England Heritage Open Days established in 1994 celebrate English architecture and culture allowing visitors free access to historical landmarks that are either not usually open to the public, or would normally charge an entrance fee.https://www.heritageopendays.org.uk/about/history =List of Doors Open events in England= * Open House London  Doors open days in Scotland Doors Open Days is organised by the Scottish Civic Trust. Alongside Scottish Archaeology Month,scottisharchaeologymonth.com the open days form Scotland's contribution to European Heritage Days. This joint initiative between the Council of Europe and the European Union aims to give people a greater understanding of each other through sharing and exploring cultural heritage. 49 countries across Europe take part annually, in September. During Glasgow's year as European City of Culture in 1990, organisers ran an Open Doors event, an event credited with popularizing the Doors Open concept and spreading it to other countries. Its popularity encouraged other areas to take part the following year and were coordinated by the Scottish Civic Trust. Doors Open Days now take place throughout Scotland thanks to a dedicated team of area coordinators. These coordinators work for a mixture of organisations: local councils, civic trusts, heritage organisations and archaeological trusts. Scotland is one of the few participating countries where events take place every weekend in September, with different areas choosing their own dates. More than 900 buildings now take part. In 2008, over 225,000 visits were made generating £2 million for the Scottish economy. It is estimated that 5,000 or more volunteers give their time to run activities and open doors for members of the public. Doors Open Days was supported in 2009 by Homecoming Scotland 2009, a year-long initiative that marked the 250th anniversary of the birth of Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns. It was funded by the Scottish Government and part financed by the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. Its aim was to engage Scots at home, as well as motivate people of Scottish descent and those who simply love Scotland, to take part in an inspirational celebration of Scottish culture and heritage.

In a 2007 Thrasher interview, Johnson explained his inspiration in the following manner: > I've wondered about that.

History and singles  Formerly known as Acoustic Faith, Rocksteddy was founded in March 2003 by fellow church members, a trio of Christian rockers including singer Teddy Corpuz, drummer Jeff Cucullo, and rhythm guitar Howie Ramos. In 2005, they decided to drop the Christian lyricism and acoustic style and turned to alternative rock. Corpuz however did not drop the spoken word element of their former music, which became the signature sound of Rocksteddy. The band opened 2006 with the release of their debut album Tsubtsatagilidakeyn. It features the hits \\"Lagi Mo Na Lang Akong Dinededma,\\" \\"Gising Na,\\" and the Close Up single \\"Smile at Me.\\" They also provided the theme song, \\"Superhero,\\" for the ABS-CBN fantasy show Super Inggo and contributed to the \\"Kami nAPO Muna: Tribute to the APO Hiking Society\\" album with a cover of \\"Blue Jeans\\". They became part of the Manila sound tribute album, \\"Hopia, Mani, Popcorn\\", with their rendition of the Juan dela Cruz song, \\"No Touch\\". Teddy Corpuz is a cousin of TV reporter, host and radio anchor Niña Corpuz-Rodriguez. In 2007, the band launched their second album with their single, \\"Break Na Tayo\\". In 2009, Rocksteddy launched their third album, Ayos Lang Ako, now under PolyEast Records, with their single \\"Boy Kulot\\". In 2013, Rocksteddy released Instadramatic, now with Universal Records alongside their single, \\"Matutunan Mo Rin\\", the concept of the album cover was a similar to the Instagram logo.

In the same year, Rocksteddy was also invited to join the tribute album Kami nAPO muna doing their version of Apo Hiking Society's \\"Blue Jeans\\". Another tribute album followed, The Best of Manila Sound: Hopia Mani Popcorn, this time they did \\"No Touch\\" by the Juan Dela Cruz Band. In 2007, Rocksteddy released EP album – dubbed a “maxi” album by Corpuz — Patipatopanabla, which contained their hit songs from different projects. It includes “Superhero”, the TV soundtrack to ABS-CBN's series Super Inggo, starring Makisig Morales. The album also included the band's music videos. Rocksteddy returned with a new album in 2008 with Ayos Lang Ako, which they recorded at musician Vic Mercado's (formerly of band Bamboo) house and co- produced with Lean Ansing, guitarist of metalcore band Slapshock.

The is appointed as a representative of the Council of Ministers. After 2000, there are 12 counties in total. = Municipalities = The second level of government is constituted by the municipalities (bashki), which have resulted from merging several former municipalities and communities. They are run by a mayor (kryebashkiak or kryetar bashkie) and a municipal council (këshilli bashkiak), elected every 4 years. The municipalities are further subdivided into units of local governance (njësi të qeverisjes vendore). After 2014, there are 61 municipalities in total.  History  Following the proclamation of Albania's independence from the Ottoman Empire, the first Albanian government led by Ismail Qemali accepted the administrative organization sanctioned in the \\"Appropriate Kanun of the Albanian Civil Administration\\" announced on November 22, 1913, according to which the country was divided into three main levels. In the first level, the territory was divided into 8 prefectures (Durrës; Berat; Dibër; Elbasan; Gjirokastër; Korcë; Shkodër and Vlorë) governed by prefect. The second and third administrative divisions were the sub-prefectures and provinces. From 1925 to 1945, the Albanian administrative territory was divided into several divisions. According to the \\"Municipal Organic Law\\" adopted in 1921 and thereafter, with the \\"Civil Code\\" adopted in February 1928, the administrative division was: Municipality (). Became operational after 1928. It was mainly an element used in settlements of urban areas or cities. They were governed by the mayor and municipal council elected by citizens every three years. Village (). The village was the initial unit of the local administration. The villages was ruled by the chief of village who was elected by the rural population where he ruled. Commune (). The communes also became operational after 1928 (before 1928 was called Provinces (Krahinë)). It included several villages on the basis of tradition and social relations, ease of communication, the possibility of realizing the needs of residents, etc. The communes center become the village where there were facilities to move the inhabitants or the goods of all the villages that were part of the commune. Sub-prefecture (). It was the third level of local government, led by the sub-prefect, who was nominated by the prefect. The functions of the sub-prefecture consisted in the organization of order, civil status services etc. Prefecture (). Was the largest local government unit. The prefecture and the sub-prefecture exercised only executive functions. *In 1927 Albania had 10 prefectures, 39 sub-prefectures, and 69 provinces with 2351 villages. *In 1934 there were 10 prefectures, 30 sub-prefectures, 160 communes with 2351 villages. *In 1940 there were 10 prefectures, 30 sub-prefectures, 23 municipalities, 136 communes and 2551 villages. After the end of World War II, by mid-1946, Socialist People's Republic of Albania continued with the existing administrative division with 10 prefectures (prefekturë) and 61 sub- prefectures (nënprefekturë), but was abolished the element of commune (komunë) and municipality (bashki). In September 1945, population census was conducted. By Law No. 284, dated August 22, 1946, the new administrative division was approved, which maintained as the first division level of 10 prefectures and lowered the number of sub-prefectures in 39 units, introducing a new element to the locality (lokalitet), but not much extended. In 1947, the locality gained extensive use by dividing the country into 10 prefectures, 2 subdivisions called districts (rrethe), and further into localities, villages and towns. By law no. 1707, in 1953, was moved to a new administrative division, where as the largest administrative unit was admitted to be 10 counties (qark), divided into 49 districts and 30 localities. In July 1958, the county was abolished, dividing the country into 26 districts. The city of Tirana maintained the level of the district. According to this division, there were 26 districts, 203 localities, 2655 villages, 39 cities and some of them had neighborhoods as the smallest administrative unit. After 1967 a new sub- division called united villages () was introduced. In 1968 there were 26 districts, 437 united villages, 2641 villages, 65 cities and 178 urban neighborhoods. This administrative division was preserved until the late 1980s, with some minor changes. In 1990 there were 26 districts, 539 united villages, 2848 villages, 67 cities, 306 urban neighborhoods. The city of Tirana consisted of three regions, which included several neighborhoods.

The label was founded in 1980 by Michel Duval and Annik Honoré. It also had a prominent associated sublabel, Factory Benelux. Both are now run by former employee James Nice. \\"Crépuscule\\" translates as \\"twilight\\", with most of the label's catalogue numbers prefixed by the letters TWI.  History  Duval and Honoré had previously organised and promoted concerts in Brussels at the Plan K venue. The name Les Disques du Crépuscule was coined by Honoré.Shadowplayers, p124 Their first visible work as Crépuscule was the fanzine Plein Soleil, issued in June 1980. The company also issued recordings by Factory Records-affiliated artists as Factory Benelux. Les Disques du Crépuscule went on to release diverse recordings by a cosmopolitan roster that included Michael Nyman, Wim Mertens, Anna Domino, Paul Haig, Josef K, Cabaret Voltaire, Mikado,Cathy Claret, Isabelle Antena, Louis Philippe (under the aliases of The Border Boys and The Arcadians), Gavin Bryars, Bill Nelson, Richard Jobson, Isolation Ward, Thick Pigeon, The Pale Fountains, Tuxedomoon, Repetition and many others. Cosmopolitan, and notably popular in Japan, the label is also celebrated for the artwork of design director Benoit Hennebert. Various compilations highlighting different aspects of the Crépuscule roster were issued by the label in its original form, including the landmark cassette release \\"From Brussels With Love\\" (TWI 007), featuring John Foxx, Thomas Dolby, Bill Nelson, Brian Eno (in conversation), Durutti Column and The Names among others. \\"The Fruit of the Original Sin\\" (TWI 035) was a lavish double- vinyl set featuring Orange Juice, Durutti Column, Richard Jobson and many more. Festive set \\"Ghosts of Christmas Past\\" (TWI 058) featured many label regulars as well as Aztec Camera. Later several retail promos also appeared, notably \\"Non Peut Etre\\" (issued to highlight new releases during 1988).  Factory Benelux  Initial Factory Benelux releases were by Factory Records artists, and were labelled as being \\"Factory Benelux/Les Disques du Crépuscule\\" editions. The first of these was a 7\\" by A Certain Ratio in August 1980, and singles by The Durutti Column and Section 25 followed in November 1980. Thereafter Factory Benelux operated as a separate imprint, although the two labels shared the same premises and staff. Bands released were associated with Factory in Manchester, some being releases that one Factory director liked but another did not (e.g., Crispy Ambulance). Factory Benelux ceased issuing new releases in 1988, although Crépuscule released some FBN-labeled CD reissues in 1990. The label was revived in 2013.  Other sublabels  A UK- based sublabel, Operation Twilight, was run from 1982-1983 by Patrick Moore, who later achieved fame as writer Philip Hoare. Their second UK sub-label, Operation Afterglow (1985-1986) simply issued UK editions of Belgian releases. Other sub-labels include Crépuscule Section Française, Crépuscule America and Crépuscule Au Japon (1983-2002), Interference, Dancyclopaedia and Another Side (1984-1987), and video label Les Images Du Crépuscule. Crépuscule also assisted in the launch of industrial label L.A.Y.L.A.H. Antirecords (1984-1989), éL Benelux, Little Circle and Interior Music (run with James Nice of LTM).  Closure  Having relocated to Paris in the late 1990s, the label became dormant after 2004. Duval went on to work in music publishing at Virgin and Because Music. Honoré's relationship with Joy Division singer Ian Curtis was dramatized in Control, the 2007 film directed by Anton Corbijn. Many of the artists, including Isabelle Antena, Blaine L. Reininger (Tuxedomoon), Winston Tong (Tuxedomoon), Paul Haig, Gavin Bryars, Anna Domino, Devine & Statton and Isolation Ward had their catalogue, old and new, re-issued by LTM Recordings retaining their original Crepuscule artwork. A few Crepuscule- themed collections also appeared on LTM, notably After Twilight (2011), a collection of previously-issued and specially-recorded tracks featuring curator Isabelle Antena plus Anna Domino, Paul Haig, The Names, Blaine L. Reininger and Cathy Claret.  Reactivation  In 2012 and 2013, both Factory Benelux and Crépuscule were revived by James Nice of LTM with the blessing of Duval and Honoré. This gave rise to many reissues, along with new releases by Helen Marnie, Marsheaux, 23 Skidoo and Penelope Queen (daughter of Isabelle Antena), as well as Section 25, The Wake and The Names on Factory Benelux.

The Hydrangea anomala species differs in being smaller (to ) and having flower corymbs up to 15 cm diameter. The common name Climbing hydrangea is applied to both species, or to species and subspecies. Description Hydrangea petiolaris is a vigorous woody climbing vine plant, growing to height and wide. It grows up trees and rock faces in its native Asian habitats, climbing by means of small aerial roots on the stems. The leaves are deciduous, ovate, 4–11 cm long and 3–8 cm broad, with a heart-shaped base, coarsely serrated margin and acute apex. The flowers are produced in flat corymbs 15–25 cm diameter in mid-summer; each corymb includes a small number of peripheral sterile white flowers 2.5-4.5 cm across, and numerous small, off-white fertile flowers 1–2 mm diameter. The fruit is a dry urn-shaped capsule 3–5 mm diameter containing several small winged seeds. Cultivation Hydrangea petiolaris is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North America. Climbing hydrangea is grown either on masonry walls or on sturdy trellises or fences. It is at its best where it gets morning sun and afternoon shade, however it can tolerate dense shade, and is therefore often selected for shady, north- facing areas with little or no sun. Its clinging rootlets are not as strong as some other wall-climbing vines, and so is often anchored with supplemental gardening ties. Its outward-reaching side shoots can be pruned back to a pair of buds to espalier it flatter against its support. When pruned during flowering, the blooms are useful in bouquets.

The town is also the place where Guru build the Sarada temple dedicated to Sarada devi the goddess of knowledge . His tomb attracts thousands of devotees every year during the Sivagiri Pilgrimage days, from 30 December to 1 January. The Sivagiri Mutt, built in 1904, is situated at the top of the Sivagiri hill in Varkala municipality of Trivandrum. This is also the headquarters of the Sree Narayana Dharma Sangham, an organisation of his disciples and saints, established by the Guru to propagate his concept of \\"One Caste, One Religion, One God\\". The Guru Deva Jayanti, the birthday of the Guru, and the samadhi day are celebrated in August and September respectively every year. Colourful processions, debates and seminars, public meetings, cultural shows, community feasts, group wedding and rituals mark the celebrations. Guru's Initial days at Sivagiri Gurudevan's association with Sivagiri in Varkala in south Kerala dates to 1904. Varkala used to be known as the southern Benares. A lover of nature and places radiant with natural beauty Narayana Guru built a hermitage on top of the Sivagiri hill and stayed there. He grew some plants around the place. That solitary hill began to attract public attention ever since Gurudevan appeared there. In course of time the Travancore state government granted the Sivagiri hill to Gurudevan and the people gave some of the surrounding places to him as gifts. Later Sivagiri grew into the nerve centre of Sree Narayana movements At first an elementary school was established there. A night school was also founded for the illiterate people of an untouchable caste. Many people came to Sivagiri to have a darshan of Gurudevan. Prathishta(Consecration) of goddess Sarada After travelling many places in South India and Sri Lanka and establishing temples, he did the prathishta of the goddess Sree Sarada at Sivagiri in April 1912. It ranks as the most remarkable among his consecration of temple deities, and occupies a distinguished place in history. Foundation for it had been laid in 1909. The same year he composed the poem \\"jananee navarathna manjari\\". According to the Indian concept, the goddess Saraswathy is the prime goddess of knowledge. But there are very few temples in Kerala with Saraswathy prathishta. Sivagiri Sarada Mutt was planned and designed by Gurudevan who took a particular interest in it. Ordinary temples do not have windows. Gurudevan called this temple, which is octagonal in shape, Sarada Mutt. Here unlike in other temples, there is no nivedyam (offering of food to the deity) or abhishekam (pouring oil, ghee and such on the idol). Devotees can worship the goddess by reciting hymns. The idol of Saraswathy seated on white lotus is the symbol of knowledge blossoming on whiteness or purity. The Sarada Consecration Committee had Dr.P.Palpu as its president and Kumaran Asan was secretary. Gurudevan's concept of the Temple In connection with Prathishta of goddess Sarada, grand conferences and festivals were conducted for four consecutive days. Sree Narayana Guru introduced original and novel perceptions about temples, departing from traditional ideas on the subject. He shunned tantric rituals. There is no similar temple in India. Here, he established an architecture that was simple and different. For the first time in India, a temple with windows and ventilation was devised. The Guru installed a deity which was traditionally symbolic and aesthetically perfect. The highest standards of hygiene were introduced to maintain the place as a modal to other temples and temple worshipers. The opening of this temple was uniquely marked by the inspirational ceremony of guest of hymns in praise of the mother Sarada. The Guru himself wrote janani-navaratna Manjari, nine Gems in praise of the mother. It is not necessary to build temples in the old style by spending a lot of money he ordained. Further, he also advised not to spend money on festivals and fireworks. In temples there should be spacious rooms where people can sit comfortably and take part in discourses. There must be schools attached to all temples. There should also be amenities attached to the temples to train children in various trades. The money that comes to the temples as donation must be spent in such a way that the poor people benefit from it. It is not desirable to make ponds near temples for the worshipers to take bath. It is not possible to keep the ponds always pure. Therefore bathrooms are to be constructed with an arrangement of small pipes so that the water will fall from above the head. From these words we can clearly understand the progressive nature of Gurudevan's concept of the temple. Sivagiri pilgrimage Sivagiri pilgrimage, now known as Sivagiri Theerthadanam, was conceived by Vallabhasseri Govindan Vaidyar and T K Kittan Writer. It was duly approved by Gurudevan in January 1928. The setting was SNDP's Nagambadam Shiva temple. It was 3 pm and Gurudevan was resting under a mango tree when the two presented the concept of Sivagiri pilgrimage. Before giving it his blessings he set out the goals of such a pilgrimage. He said: \\"Let the pilgrims congregate at the beginning of the European New Year. It should be Dhanu 16-17 in Malayalam calendar. Let the pilgrims observe 10 days' self-purification according to Sri Buddha's principles of five purities (Pancha Dharma) - body, food, mind, word, deed.\\" He ruled that pilgrims could wear yellow clothes - the colour of the garments Sri Buddha wore. Let no one purchase yellow silk because we have recommended yellow garments. Not even new clothes are required on the pilgrimage. A pilgrim can dip a white garment in turmeric water and wear after drying. The pilgrimage should be conducted with simplicity and preferably be accompanied by the chanting of hymns. There should be no shouting and pilgrims should scrupulously avoid trappings of ostentation. To Govindan Vaidyar and Kitten Writer, Gurudevan counted on his fingers the goals of the pilgrimage, explaining how to achieve them. The goals were the promotion of *1. Education *2. Cleanliness *3. Devotion to God *4. Organisation *5. Agriculture *6. Trade *7. Handicrafts *8. Technical training Finally, it was decided to start the first pilgrimage from the village of Elavumthitta. The S N D P unit No.76 of Elavumthitta selected 5 youngsters for the pilgrimage, namely, P.K.Divakara Panicker, P.K.Kesavan, P.V.Raghavan, M.K.Raghavan, S.Sankunni. All the 5 pilgrims wore bright yellow dress, as suggested by Sree narayana Guru. All the way to Sivagiri, they were reciting 'Swaathanthrya gadha' – written by the great poet Kumaranaasan. They were teased with the words 'Manjakkilikal' –meaning yellow birds. They never got provoked, with a smile they moved on. The dominant thought in their mind was the mission to fulfill, will have to reach Sivagiri, a great responsibility bestowed on their shoulders by the Sreenarayana devotees. Their mission was a great success. He advised them to organise a series of lectures on the themes with experts conducting them. The lectures should be listened to attentively. More important, the principles should be put into practice. Success must accompany efforts. Only then will the country and the people benefit. this must be the core purpose of Sivagiri pilgrimage. Festivals Guru Jayanthi celebration at Gokaneswara Temple, Mangalore, Karnataka, India The Sarada temple and mutt has now become a unique place of pilgrimage. The Sri Narayana Jayanthi, birthday of the Guru, and the Samadhi day are befittingly celebrated in August and September respectively every year. On these days colourful processions, seminars, public meetings, cultural shows, community feasts and special rituals are held. In the last week of December, devotees of Sree Narayana Guru, donned in yellow attire stream to Sivagiri from different parts of Kerala and outside, in what may be called a pilgrimage of enlightenment. Seminars and discussions on various themes of modern life ranging from industrialisation to women's emancipation are held during the days of pilgrimage.

It is a resident breeder in the mountains of Central America from southern Mexico to western Panama. It occurs in highlands from 1000 m or higher up to the timberline, usually in dense understory thickets or bamboos. The nest, as with several other wood-quails remains undescribed, but the eggs are known to be creamy-white with brown spots. The spotted wood quail is 25 cm long and weighs 300 g. It has an orange crest which is raised when it is excited. The upperparts are dark brown with black and rufous flecking. The underparts are normally olive brown, but there is a colour morph with rufous underparts. In both cases, the underparts are boldly spotted with white. The forehead is dark brown and the cheeks and throat are black streaked with white. The sexes are similar, but the male averages slightly larger and the female has a duller crest. Immature birds have smaller, more buff-tinted spotting, and the throat is dusky rather than black. There are no subspecies. The advertising call of the spotted wood quail, actually a duet, is a clear whistled coowit CAWwit coowit COO, and the contact calls are clear chirps and peeps. Spotted wood quails are found in groups of 4 to 10; they forage on the ground, scratching at the soil for seeds, fallen fruit and insects. This is a shy and wary species, which will normally make its escape on foot, but if startled it will explode into a short fast flight into cover. The best chance of seeing this species is at dawn, when it may feed at the side of a road or on a forest track. This species is reported as locally common in suitable habitat in Costa Rica and Panama, but has been adversely in much of its range by rampant deforestation.  Feeding  The Spotted wood quail eats insects and nuts especially in summer, as well as plants. Unlike many other bird species, they require a high protein diet.

It is located in the Meurthe-et-Moselle département of France, about ten miles west of the French city of Metz, and about one mile (1.6 km) southwest of Chambley-Bussières, on the south side of the Départemental 901 (D901) (Meurthe-et-Moselle) road. The first use of Chambley-Bussières as an airfield was in 1940, when the French Air Force stationed 9 Potez 631 fighters and 5 Mureaux 117 observation aircraft on farmland. The aircraft were assigned to the GAO 2/506. After the Battle of France ended in May, 1940, Chambley- Bussieres was abandoned as an air base and returned to agricultural use. During the Cold War, Chambley-Bussières was a front-line base for the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). United States Air Force use In 1951 as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, Chambley-Bussières was provided for use by the United States Air Force. Construction of the base on former farmland started in 1952, although construction delays prevented the facility from being ready for wing operations until mid-1955. On 30 January 1953 during the initial construction period, the 73rd Air Depot Wing at Chateauroux Air Depot sent a small team to establish Flight A, 73rd Support Group Depot, Chambley. This flight was sent to receive, store and issue USAF supplies as needed by Air Force personnel and French contractors. This team lived near the main train station in Metz on the local economy and ensured at least one USAF airman was always present on the new base to provide site security. The design of the airfield was to space parked aircraft as far apart as possible by the construction of a circular marguerite system of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. Typically the marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a large central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. This construction can be seen clearly in the satellite image link at the bottom of this article. Enough construction was completed by February 1954 that USAFE established the 7002d Air Base Squadron at Chambley to coordinate the set-up of various facilities, such as security, supply, transportation and communications. Chambley Air Base was formally dedicated and turned over to the USAF on 12 June 1956. =21st Fighter-Bomber Wing= North American F-86F-35-NA Sabre Serial 52-5222 of the 72d Fighter-Bomber Squadron. The aircraft has been restored and is painted in the Wing Commander's motif, with blue, yellow and red striping. North American F-86F-35-NA Sabre Serial 53-1147 of the 21st FBW. Note the aircraft is parked on temporary steel planking, when the parking apron of Chambley was still unfinished. The first USAF unit to use Chambley AB was the 21st Fighter-Bomber Wing, being transferred from George AFB, California. The wing's deployment to France had to be carried out in stages. Four echelons of wing personnel variously traveled by train, ship, and air to reach Chambley between November 1954 and January 1955. The 21 FBW officially established its headquarters at Chambley on 12 December 1954. The 21 FBW consisted of three squadrons, the 72d, 416th and 531st Fighter-Bomber Squadrons, equipped with the F-86F \\"Sabre\\". In 1957, the Cabinet of France decreed that all nuclear weapons and delivery aircraft had to be removed from French soil by July 1958. As a result, the F-86's of the 21st Fighter-Bomber Wing had to be removed from France. During October 1957 it was announced that the 21 FBW would be inactivated on 8 February 1958, and that its assets would be dispersed among existing USAFE units. After three years without any permanent flying units, in 1961 Chambley Air Base was reactivated as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the Berlin Crisis of 1961. On 1 October 1961, as a result of the crisis, the mobilized Indiana Air National Guard 122d Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed to Chambley from Baer Field, Fort Wayne, Indiana. When activated, the 122d consisted of three tactical fighter squadrons, the 112th at Toledo Express Airport, Ohio; the 113th at Hulman Field, Terre Haute, and the 163d at Baer Field. The deployed wing was designated the 7122d Tactical Wing while in France. By 1 December the ground support units arrived and the 7122d prepared for an estimated overseas deployment of 10 months. On 7 June the 163d was directed to return to CONUS with all personnel, however the aircraft and equipment were to remain at Chambley. The assets of the ANG 163rd TFS at Chambley were assigned to the 390th Tactical Fighter Squadron. With the departure of the 390th TFS/366 TFW, Chambley-Bussieres AB was again placed in reserve status, being used for various USAFE exercises over the next two years. The facility was turned over to the 7367th Combat Support Group which acted as the host USAF unit. =25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing= The 25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was activated on 1 July 1965 at Chambley AB, and absorbed the 19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron and 42d Electronic Countermeasures Squadron. On 1 May 1966, the 42d was inactivated and the squadrons remaining aircraft were deployed to Takhli RTAFB, with all of its assets in Thailand being assigned to the 41st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (TEWS). The remaining aircraft of the 25 TRW were assigned to the 363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Shaw AFB, South Carolina. On 15 October 1966 the 25 TRW was inactivated. The 7367th Combat Support Group was activated to close the facility. On 1 April 1967, the last USAF personnel left Chambley AB, and the base was returned to French control. Current Uses \\"Mondial Air Ballons\\" festival 2007 After the USAF's departure in 1967, the French Air Force (Armée de l'Air) assumed control of Chambley AB. It was used for various flight operations and also by airborne forces for many years. Today, Chambley is being developed into a commercial business park. The runway and various taxiways are intact and usable. Many of the old USAF buildings and hangars are used for various non-military purposes. The airfield is still classified as being a military airfield, however many aeronautical activities take place in particular by the means of a club of Ultralight aircraft since more than 20 years and the \\"Lorraine Mondial Air Ballons\\", which is Europe's largest hot air balloon festival and takes place here every two years at the end of July.The \\"Lorraine Mondial Air Ballons\\" on pilatre-de-rozier.com Since July 16, 2009, the main runway (05-23) of the airfield is now open to civil air traffic restricted to Very Light Aircraft with code LFJY.

During the Cold War, Évreux-Fauville was a front-line base for the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) as part of NATO's Allied Forces Central Europe. In 1967, the US forces withdrew and the French air force began again using the base, initially flying the Nord 2501 Noratlas. At present, the base is home of two French tactical transport squadrons flying mostly Transall C-160 transportation planes.http://www.senat.fr/rap/a05-102-6/a05-102-616.html The base is home to: * Escadron de Transport 1/62 Vercors - CN 235 * Escadron de Transport 3/62 Ventoux - CN 235 * Escadron de Transport 2/64 Anjou - C-160 * Escadron électronique aéroporté 1/54 Dunkerque - C-160G Origins The origins of Évreux Air Base go back to the 1920s, when a civil aerodrome was built to accommodate sport flying. In the 1930s concrete runways were constructed along with several hangars. During the Phony War period of 1939/40, the French Air Force maintained Dewoitine D.510 fighters and Potez 630 bombers. In addition, American built Curtis P-36 Hawk, Martin A-22 Maryland and Douglas DB-7 light bombers provided by President Roosevelt's \\"cash and carry\\" program were stationed at Évreux. With the fall of France, the Luftwaffe took up residence at Évreux, flying Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Junkers Ju 88 aircraft during the Battle of Britain. During the war, the Germans improved the runways and other facilities. Later, they stationed Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters on the base. Évreux was heavily bombed and attacked by Allied fighters and bombers, especially those of the U.S. Army Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. By July 1944, within a month of the Normandy invasion of 6 June, the runways and taxiways were useless, pockmarked with bomb craters and debris. With the liberation of France, the Royal Air Force used Évreux Air Base until May 1945. After the war, the base was left mostly unused, with the exception of a small aero club. With the outbreak of the Cold War in the late 1940s, with the Berlin Airlift and the ongoing threat from the Soviet Union to Western Europe, negotiations began in November 1950 between NATO and the United States to establish air bases and station combat wings in France to meet European defense needs. During the negotiations, the World War II airfield at Évreux was proposed for expansion into a modern air base for troop carrier and cargo aircraft. However, the airfield was under local jurisdiction and the facility was being used as a civilian airport. Final approval was obtained in 1951 from the City of Évreux and the Department of Eure. Development of Évreux Air Base was managed by the 7305th Air Base Squadron for the next three years. The USAF planned that a troop carrier wing, flying C-119s could be in place at Évreux by 1954. Preliminary surveys were conducted in April 1952, and construction of a new base began in July. The World War II damage was removed and new runways laid down. The design of the airfield was to space parked aircraft as far apart as possible by the construction of a circular marguerite system of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. Typically the margueriete consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a large central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. This construction can be seen clearly in the satellite image link at the bottom of this article. Roads and buildings were constructed, communications, and other infrastructure was completed and the facilities were ready by the summer of 1955. = 465th Troop Carrier Wing = The first USAF occupant of Évreux Air Base was the 465th Troop Carrier Wing, being deployed to Évreux in May 1955. The base was still in the middle of being constructed, however minimal facilities were available to accommodate the unit. The 465th flew the C-119 \\"Flying Boxcar\\" and consisted of 54 aircraft being assigned to the 780th, 781st and 782nd Troop Carrier Squadrons. The 780th and 781st TCS received the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award in 1956 for extraordinary operations. The Wing airlifted United Nations troops, supplies and equipment to the Middle East and flew Red Cross emergency supplies to Hungarian refugees, along with completing their scheduled training missions. Fairchild C-119C-26-FA Flying Boxcar Serial 51-2640 781st Troop Carrier Squadron, 1954 During early 1957 the Lockheed C-130 was entering the USAF inventory and with its increased range and capacity, the C-119s began to be phased out. Also when the U.S. Army projected a decrease of airborne units in Europe, so the need for troop practice drops would decline. It was determined that the 465th would be phased down and inactivated. The 465th TCW was reorganized on 12 March 1957 when its group headquarters was inactivated and the wing deputy commander for operations took over command of the troop carrier squadrons. At this time, manpower shortages were keeping staffing at about 70 to 80 percent of authorized levels and the reorganization elimitatd about 50 personnel slots. In July, 465th Wing Headquarters and all support squadrons were inactivated. Personnel were transferred from the support squadrons into various wing vacancies, transferred to other USAFE bases or returned to the United States (CONUS). By this time, the 465th along with the 317th TCW shared Évreux, with a total of six flying squadrons. The end of the 465th came on 8 July when it was inactivated and the 780th and 781st squadrons came under the command of the 317th TCW. At this time, the two squadrons were directed to prepare their C-119s for return to Air Force Reserve troop carrier wings in CONUS. By December, 37 C-119s departed. On 20 December the 782d squadron was inactivated. On 6 January 1958, all the C-119s of the 317th TCW were transferred on paper to the 780th and 781st squadrons and they flew the aircraft back to CONUS. On 8 March 1958 they were also inactivated, ending the last remnant of the 465th Troop Carrier Wing's presence at Évreux. In March 1958 the C-119Gs of the three squadrons were returned to CONUS, and the squadrons were inactivated. = 317th Troop Carrier Wing = On 14 April 1958 the 317th Troop Carrier Wing was relocated from Neubiberg AB Germany (near Munich) to Évreux. The United States agreed to return Neubiberg to the German Air Force. By 16 April 1957 the relocation to Évreux was complete, with three squadrons, the 39th, 40th and 41st joining the 465th TCW currently at Évreux. At Neubiberg, the 317th and transitioned from C-54s to C-119s and shared a common mission with the 465th, transporting and paradropping airborne forces and their equipment. At Évreux, its mission was changed to support fighter weapons training at Wheelus Air Base Libya with the transport of maintenance personnel, aircraft support equipment, spare parts, tools, test sets and other equipment needed to support the squadrons at the deployed site. The 317th continued to fly C-119s until the end of 1957 but began converting to new C-130A \\"Hercules\\" cargo transport aircraft. In March 1957, the 317th was inactivated along with the 465th TCW, with the aircraft and personnel coming under the direct command of HQ USAFE. In September 1958 the flying squadrons were assigned directly to the 322nd Air Division. = 322nd Air Division = The 322nd Air Division (Combat Cargo) was the main host unit at Évreux AB, being established on 12 August 1955 and remaining until 1 April 1964. The unit was a command element to control all airlift units assigned to USAFE. The 322nd directed the three Troop Carrier Wings in Europe - the 317th and 465th at Évreux as well as the 60th at Dreux-Louvillier Air Base. Lockheed C-130A-8-LM Hercules 56-0524 of the 40th Troop Carrier Squadron at Évreux, 1958. With the inactivation of the troop carrier wings at Évreux and Dreux, the 322nd became responsible for the operation and maintenance of the aircraft of the Troop Carrier Squadrons, with Air Base Groups being responsible for the command of the base support functions. Units of the 322nd Air Division flew many humanitarian missions and support NATO airborne units throughout Europe. They airlifted life rafts, tents, and emergency food supplies to flood victims in the Netherlands, and aided thousands of earthquake victims in Italy, Greece, Pakistan and Yugoslavia among many others. On 15 April 1963, the 317th Troop Carrier Wing was briefly reactivated at Évreux. HQ USAFE determined a Wing structure to command the C-130 squadrons at Évreux, and reduced the 322nd AD accordingly. In the spring of 1964, it was decided that the 322nd Air Division would be transferred to MATS and the 317th TCW to Tactical Air Command. Subsequently, the 317th TCW departed Évreux on 20 June 1964 to Lockbourne AFB, Ohio. With the departure of the Troop Carrier Wing and Air Division, Évreux was placed in a reserve status, with the 7305th Combat Support Group maintaining the base and its facilities. Tactical Air Command C-130 squadrons on temporary duty replaced the 317th wing. In November 1964 TAC C-130s on rotation to Évreux from the 464th Troop Carrier Wing at Pope AFB, NC flew the famous DRAGON ROUGE rescue mission at Stanleyville in the former Belgian Congo. The Évreux-based C-130s transported Belgian paratroopers to the Congo for the mission, which was followed up a few days later by a similar operation at the town of Paulis. =Transfer to French use= On 7 March 1966, French President Charles De Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967. The 513th Troop Carrier Wing arrived at Évreux on 15 April 1966 from Sewart Air Force Base Tennessee to facilitate the removal of USAF assets in France. Its tenure at the base was brief, moving large amounts of supplies and materiel from France to Germany and the United Kingdom. By January 1967 virtually all was complete, and the Wing was transferred to RAF Mildenhall, England departing on 26 March when Évreux was returned to the French. Today among the French Air Force units stationed at the base are GAM 00.056 Vaucluse, with DHC-6-300, EC725L2, C-160R (on loan), and C-130H/H-30, ET 01.064 Béarn with the C-160R, ET 02.064 also with the C-160R, Escadron électronique aéroporté 1/54 Dunkerque (EEA 00.054 Dunkerque) with the C-160G Gabriel \\"Lion des Flandres\\", and EIE 01.340 also with the C-160R.http://www.scramble.nl/orbats/france/airforce In January 2020, Évreux- Fauville Air Base was announced as the site of the ground based training system for the Archange strategic airborne intelligence program, using two (and possibly a third) Dassault Falcon Epicure (8X variant) aircraft by 2025, replacing two Transall C-160 Gabriel aircraft currently operated by Escadron électronique aéroporté 1/54 Dunkerque (EEA 00.054 Dunkerque).

There were about 26 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters assigned, along with 2 Curtiss Hawk 75s in May 1940, just prior to the Battle of France.Armée de l'Air Order of Battle, 10 May 1940 =German use during Second World War= The airfield was seized by the Germans in late May during the Battle of France. The Luftwaffe quickly moved in combat strike units to continue the Blitzkrieg against French and British Expeditionary Force units in the battle. Known units assigned were: The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 * Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53) 26 May-1 June 1940 Messerschmitt Bf 109E * Jagdgeschwader 2 (JS 2) 26 May-1 June 1940; 2–16 June 1940 Messerschmitt Bf 109E * Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 (SKS 2) 12 June–July 1940, Junkers Ju 87B Stuka The Battle of France saw these JS 53 score heavily during May and June 1940 against Armee de l'Air and Royal Air Force forces, while JS 2 was tasked with escorting raids and defending German airspace to the south of Heinz Guderian's Panzer forces which were encircling the French and the British Expeditionary Force. SKS 2 provided air-ground support of Wehrmacht units moving rapidly south into France and along the channel coast against mostly French Army units. In the immediate aftermath of the German victory in France, the Luftwaffe moved in Kampfgeschwader 77 (KG 77), a bomber wing. KG 77 was initially equipped with Dornier Do 17Z, and later with Junkers Ju 88As in mid July 1940. carrying out attacks on England during the Battle of Britain. Initially having 35 Ju 88s, This unit suffered losses of 9 Ju 88s on a single mission against Gravesend on 18 September, one of the highest losses of any units in a single mission. On 27 September I./KG 77 lost six J 88s when raiding London, while II./KG 77 lost another six on the same night. In February 1941, the unit moved to Reims. When the bombers moved out, the Luftwaffe improved the airfield, putting down two 1600m concrete runways (02/20, 10/28), along with concrete taxiways, dispersal hardstands and improved the support station and barracks. The improved airfield came back onto operational status in October 1942 when a Luftwaffe pathfinder group, Kampfgeschwader 100 (KG 100) moved in on 7 October. Flying Heinkel He 111H, the group led night bombing attacks over England for other Luftwaffe units. It remained until December 1942 when it moved to Glifada, Greece (Athens). Laon's next use by the Luftwaffe was by Kampfgeschwader 101 (KG 101) in March 1944, followed by Kampfgeschwader 30 (KG 30) in July 1944. KG 101 was part of the Mistel (German: Mistletoe), project, in which Junkers Ju 88A, bombers were controlled by a Messerschmitt Bf 109E, which was flown to the target by the fighter, then separated and guided, with a shaped 1,800 kg charge at the nose of the aircraft, and used as unmanned powered bomb. KG 101 flew several attacks against hardened Allied targets along the English channel coast, and later KG 30 flew conventional bombing attacks against Allied harbors in newly liberated areas of the French channel coast. These activities drew Allied attention to the base, with it being attacked by B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bombers of the Eighth Air Force 100th Bombardment Group on 5 May 1944USAFHRA Document 00081645 With the bombers moving out, the Luftwaffe turned Laon- Couvron into a fighter-interceptor base, with Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27) flying Bf 109G day interceptors against Eighth Air Force bomber groups over Occupied Europe. Largely due to its use as a base for interceptors, Laon-Couvron was attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) =American wartime use= In August 1944, the Laon area was liberated by the Third Army and Laon-Couvron was captured about 7 September. The airfield was repaired by the IX Engineering Command, 820th Engineer Aviation Battalion, and declared operationally ready for combat on 10 September. Under American control it was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"A-70 Laon-Couvron\\".IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Ninth Air Force assigned the 50th Fighter Group, based P-47 Thunderbolt fighters to the airfield on 15 September, remaining until 28 September. The fighter planes flew support missions during the Allied invasion of France, patrolling roads, strafing German military vehicles, and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops when spotted. Afterwards, the A-26 Invader- equipped 409th Bombardment Group, arrived in February 1945, remaining until June when the base was closed.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . After the end of the Second World War, Laon Air Base was returned to the French on 23 October 1945 and the facility was unused for several years, the land being leased by the French Air Ministry to farmers for agricultural use. U.S. acquisition and use With the outbreak of the Cold War in the late 1940s and the Berlin Airlift and the ongoing threat from the Soviet Union to Western Europe, the Soviet threat appeared to be growing. Thus negotiations began in November 1950 between NATO and the United States to station combat forces in France to meet European defense needs. During the site selection negotiations, Laon-Couvron was initially proposed by the USAF to become a Light Bomber air base, and also an Air Division Headquarters base. Also, the USAF had historically used the base, and it was presently unused. An agreement was reached with the French Air Ministry in early 1951 for the Americans to return to Laon-Couvron and redevelop the base, and that a USAF light bomber wing would be stationed there as soon as possible.McAuliffe, Jerome J: U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967 (2005), Chapter 2, Base Selection and Movement to France, 1950-1954 90px On 15 June 1951 construction began to upgrade the wartime facilities to NATO standards. When USAF engineers arrived they found the base much as the USAAF had left it in 1945, with wrecked hangars and support facilities full of garbage and vermin after years of abandonment, still in ruins from the numerous bombing raids; two patched runways, and various amounts of aircraft wreckage moved off the grass areas which were leased to farmers in the postwar years. The entire base had to be bulldozed and cleared before construction could begin. New water wells were dug and new water lines and sewage pipes were laid. A new water treatment plant, along with upgraded roads were built. A new jet runway was constructed over the existing wartime secondary runway, the primary being resurfaced and used as a taxiway to a new maintenance support site. The design of the airfield was to space park aircraft as far apart as possible by the construction of a circular marguerite system of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. Typically the marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a large central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. This construction can be seen clearly in the satellite image link at the bottom of this article. By 1954 the base was ready for use by operational Air Force Wings. =126th Bombardment Wing (Light)= Douglas A/B-26C-35-DT Invader Serial 44-35549 of the 180th LBS The first USAF unit to use Laon AB was the activated Air National Guard 126th Bombardment Wing, flying the Second World War vintage Douglas B-26B/C \\"Invader\\" light bomber. The wing consisted of the 108th, 168th and 180th Bomb Squadrons (Light). The aircraft were marked by various color bands on the vertical stabilizer and rudder. Black/Yellow/Blue for the 108th; Black/Yellow/Red for the 168th, and Black/Yellow/Green for the 180th. The 126th BW was called to active service on 1 April 1951 and was initially deployed to Bordeaux AB in November 1951. On 25 May 1952 the wing was relocated to Laon, with Bordeaux becoming a support base. A total of 5 B-26Bs, 6 TB-26Bs, and 26 B-26Cs were transferred from Bordeaux, and an additional 48 B-26C's painted black and equipped for night missions were deployed from CONUS to Laon. At Laon, the 126th used its B-26's for training and maneuvers at Laon until December until being relieved from active duty and transferred, without personnel and equipment, back to the control of the Illinois Air National Guard on 1 January 1953. =38th Tactical Bombardment Wing= Martin B-57B-MA Serial 52-1560 of the 71st Light Bomber Squadron - 1957. This aircraft was also one of the \\"Black Knights\\" aerial acrobatic team. After its withdrawal from France in 1958, this aircraft was eventually assigned to the 8th Tactical Bomb Squadron at Phan Rang Air Base South Vietnam and flew combat bombing missions into the late 1960s. On 1 January 1953, the flying assets of the 126th Bomb Wing were transferred to the 38th Tactical Bombardment Wing. The 38th's squadrons were designated the 71st, 405th, and 822nd Bomb Squadrons. The wing continued flying the B-26's until 1956. In April 1955 the 38th Bomb Wing converted to the Martin B-57 \\"Canberra\\". The B-57 was a replacement for aging Douglas B-26 \\"Invader\\", and with their arrival, the B-26's were returned to CONUS. Because English Electric was unable to meet the USAF delivery schedule, the design was licensed to Martin for US manufacture. A total of 49 B-57B and 8 2-seat B-57C models were deployed to Laon. The mission of the B-57 was to provide a nuclear deterrent for NATO and to deliver nuclear weapons against pre-selected targets, day or night. The aircraft at Laon were painted a gloss black. An acrobatic team was organized and named the Black Knights using five B-57's. The Black Knights performed at several air shows around Western Europe, including the 1957 Paris Air Show. The Black Knights were the only tactical bomber show team in the world. In 1958, General De Gaulle announced that all nuclear weapons and delivery aircraft had to be removed from French soil by July 1958. Since NATO strategy had evolved into \\"massive nuclear retaliation\\" this meant all tactical fighter and bombing wings had to depart France. The 38th TBW was inactivated at Laon on 18 June 1958 and redesignated as the 38th Tactical Missile Wing at Hahn Air Base West Germany, operating and maintaining the TM-61 \\"Matador\\" cruise missile. The support personnel of the 38th were reassigned to the incoming 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The B-57's were returned to CONUS and transferred to the Air National Guard and some were converted into various other versions (reconnaissance, electronic warfare) of the B-57. Aircraft from Laon were assigned to the following units: * 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Kansas ANG, Hutchinson, KS * 154th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Arkansas ANG, Little Rock, AR * 165th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Kentucky ANG, Louisville, KY * 172nd Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Michigan ANG, Battle Creek, MI Many of these aircraft were deployed to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War. By 1973, most of the surviving B-57s had been consigned to the boneyards at Davis Monthan AFB. =66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing= Republic RF-84F-25-RE Thunderflashes of the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing flying over the coast of Morocco near Nouasseur Air Base - 1958. Identified serials are 51-17011, 52-7318, 52-7343 and 52-7295. All of these aircraft were sold to the German Air Force. 17011 was later sold to the Greek Air Force and 7381 to the Italian Air Force. 17011 is now on permanent display at the Hellenic AF Museum, Dekelia AB, Athens. thumbMcDonnell RF-101F-56-MC Voodoo 56-0217 of the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Laon Air Base France, 1959. The combination green, yellow, blue and red stripes on the tail signify the wing commander's aircraft. With the forced withdrawal of the nuclear-equipped B-57s from France, USAFE decided to move the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing to Laon. In 1955 the 66th TRW was assigned to Sembach AB in West Germany, however the flying facilities were inadequate and the base was too small to support flying operations. This move was also in accordance with USAFEs plan to realign the posture of various bases in anticipation of aircraft conversion. The 66th was to convert to the RF-101 Voodoo. On 10 July 1958, 66th TRW Wing Headquarters was transferred to Laon, however its flying squadrons, the 32nd, 38th, 302nd and 303rd, were located at Phalsbourg AB until considerable runway improvements, in particular the preparation of runway overruns could be made at Laon. In September, the 64 RF-84F \\"Thunderstreak\\" tactical reconnaissance aircraft of the 66th arrived at Laon. Just prior to the move, in a public relations exercise, the 302nd engaged in some large-scale oblique photo coverage of all towns and cities within a 30-mile radius of Laon. The processed photos were presented to the various town and city officials as a means of introducing the newcomers to the community. In early 1959 it was announced that the 302nd and 303rd TRS were to be inactivated and their places in the 66th taken by the 17th and 18th TRS from Shaw AFB, South Carolina. These two units arrived at Laon in May 1959, with the 302nd and 303rd inactivated on 20 June. All the RF-84s were ferried to the IRAN facility at Naples for eventual distribution to NATO forces. In January 1959 the announcement was made that the 32nd and 38th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons were to receive the McDonnell RF-101C \\"Voodoo\\". Many of the pilots of the 302nd and 303rd squadrons were transferred to the new Voodoo squadrons. Capt. Neely was the chief test pilot from 1959 to 1962. Capt. Everhart commissioned officer in charge, with Chief Master Sergeant Carl L. Molis as NCO were in charge of field maintenance operations from December 1959 to October 1962. =USAF Closure= On 7 March 1966, Gen Charles De Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's military structure but not leave the political organization. He gave NATO forces one year (until 1 April 1967) to depart France. On 10 June 1966 the 7379th Tactical Group was activated at Laon AB to facilitate the closure of the base. There was no space available in Germany to relocate the 66th TRW, so the Strategic Air Command's standby base at RAF Upper Heyford, England, was transferred to USAFE and the wing relocated to the UK after eight years at Laon AB. The relocation of the 66th TRW was completed by November 1966. Under the US Embassy in Paris, a caretaker force, 7260th Support Group, DET 18 MLS, provided security, with 6 French nationals for records and utility system operations remained until 30 March 1967 when the remaining USAF equipment and personnel were transferred out of Laon and the base was returned to the French. Current uses With the withdrawal of the USAF, the French Army moved into Laon Air Base and renamed the facility Quartier Mangin sur l'ancienne base de Couvron. From 1980 it was the home of the 1st Marine Artillery Regiment (1er Regiment d'Artillerie de Marine (1er RAMa)). Many of the old USAF buildings remain at the technical area and support base, and are used by the French. The three large hangars on the main parking ramp have been removed, with new-purpose-built structures being erected on the parking ramp area. The hangars in the two northern squadron marguerites have been removed, but both parking areas are still relatively intact, albeit with deteriorating hardstands; the marguerite to the east having had much additional construction of army facilities over the years. The main NATO jet runway is no longer in use, however it appears well maintained along with the main taxiway. A small section of the runway is used for helicopter operations. Much of the wartime base remains, the entire length of the German 10/28 runway is visible, being used as an east–west access road and storage area for excess vehicles. The north–south 02/20 runway remains in part, with some buildings erected on parts of it, other parts reduced to a double road with, and other parts of broken-up, deteriorating concrete, with a parallel taxiway also still existing in part, being used as a perimeter road of the facility. A large area in the southwest of the base consists of abandoned streets, with concrete foundations of former buildings still remaining in the grass areas between them. It is not known if the foundations are from wartime or NATO buildings. In addition to the southeast, just outside the current facility to the southeast, remains of what was probably a German aircraft dispersal area remain with large, unconnected concrete areas in agricultural fields, being connected by single-lane concrete farm roads. On 19 Juin 2012, the 1st Marine Artillery Régiment took up new quarters at Chalons- en-Champagne where it relieved the disbanded 402nd Artillery Regiment.

The founder members were, singer/songwriters Graham Dye, and brother Steven Dye, with drummer Sean Heaphy. They began to perform at many top venues, to a well established following, and had already recorded an album of original material, and were signed to a major record company, when joined by fourth member, Mark Gilmour, brother of Pink Floyd's David Gilmour, on lead guitar. The debut single, \\"101 Dam-Nations\\", was released on EMI’s famous Parlophone label, on 16 October 1982, alongside a special re-release of Love Me Do, celebrating The Beatles' 20th anniversary at EMI. This helped to get Scarlet Party noticed, and with the voice of Graham Dye, uncannily resembling that of John Lennon, a television, radio, and magazine, publicity campaign, helped to reinforce the connection. The single was enthusiastically received (Kate Bush described it as her favourite), and reached number 44 in the UK Singles Chart. It was voted number 4 in the All-Time Top 100 Singles from Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums.. Larkin states 'it should have been an anthem monster number one.' The follow-up single \\"Eyes Of Ice\\" reached number 8 in the Portuguese chart. The single was released in February 1983, on ice-clear vinyl, which was a request from the band, and all art-work for the sleeve was created by Graham Dye, using coloured pencils. EMI then decided not to release the completed album, which was to be called 'Scarlet Skies'. 'Scarlet Skies', was recorded at Abbey Road Studios in 1981-82, but has never been officially released. The linked songs explore themes of war, love, and alienation, in styles reminiscent of both the mini pop operas of The Who, and the progressive concept albums of Pink Floyd. The band recorded more original songs written by the Dye brothers, as a four-piece, until the departure of Mark Gilmour at the end of 1983, and then, once again, as a three-piece, also working on other projects, including a musical cartoon adventure based on the band, none of which were taken on by EMI. Scarlet Party continued performing live shows, joined briefly by new member Micky Portman on bass, and recorded several more tracks at Abbey Road Studios. However, the band now feeling disheartened, and disappointed in EMI, decided to call it a day at the end of 1985. Graham Dye went on to work as lead vocalist, on several albums by The Alan Parsons Project, and more recently, a new version of \\"101 Dam-Nations\\" was made, featuring Graham and Steven Dye, together with Phil Collins of Genesis, playing the drums. The brothers requested the help of Alan Parsons to produce the recording, which is not yet available.

Parlophone artists British rock music groups ","title":"Scarlet Party"},{"id":"4319145","text":"Beau Peep was a popular British comic strip written by Roger Kettle and illustrated by Andrew Christine. The strip features the misadventures of the eponymous lead character, Beau Peep, an inept and cowardly British man who joins the tough and hardy French Foreign Legion in the deserts of North Africa to escape his terrifying wife Doris back home. There are also numerous surreal supporting characters. Origins Beau Peep was first published in the launch issue of British newspaper The Daily Star on 2 November 1978, and ran until late 2016. Kettle and Christine also produced the popular cowboy strip \\"A Man Called Horace\\" which was featured daily in the Daily Mirror and Daily Record until August 1, 2015. This strip was commissioned in 1989 by Mirror Group Newspapers in an attempt to lure the Beau Peep fan base from the Daily Star. Roger Kettle also scripts Andy Capp for the Daily Mirror. The strip is drawn by Roger Mahoney. Beau Peep was originally intended as a parody of Beau Geste, a 1924 adventure novel by British author P. C. Wren, which has itself been adapted for the screen several times, and again parodied even more. However Beau Peep grew to have a distinctive character and identity in its own right and is perhaps the most famous of these parodies of Beau Geste, still retaining a large fan base. On the forum of the official Beau Peep website, writer Roger Kettle also claims to have been inspired by the American comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz, in that like Schulz's creation Charlie Brown, Beau Peep is a \\"loveable loser\\". Publication history As well as daily appearances in The Daily Star, paperback anthologies of Beau Peep were published every year between 1980 and 1998. A total of 20 books were published, including, in 1987, a special 'Colour Collection'. These have been issued through various publishing houses, most notably by Pedigree Books. Some comic strips are available for viewing online on the Beau Peep official website. A new collection of strips called \\"The Return of Beau Peep\\" was published by CreateSpace () in February 2012. The strip was dropped from the Daily Star in December 1997, as part of a cost-cutting exercise. This resulted in a huge sales loss for the paper and demands from fans for Beau Peep to be brought back. The strip eventually returned in March 1999, and continued until December 2016, when it was axed for a second time. Reprints of the strip have been in the Sunday Express, the Sunday Mail, and the Daily Star Sunday. For 15 months from December 1999 new strips were published every week in the Sunday People colour magazine. In Italy, the strip is called \\"Beep Peep\\", published in Lanciostory. Characters =Beau Peep= The central character of the strip, Bert Peep, is a short, mustachioed, bespectacled British man who originally fled Britain to escape his terrifying, overbearing and ape-like wife Doris over two decades before the beginning of the strip. Doris followed him, and so Bert joined the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara desert because he believed it was the one place Doris could not reach him. He changed his name to Beau and has been stuck in one fort ever since. Beau is cowardly, underhanded, incompetent, and inept. His colleagues view Beau as an annoyance, his superiors view him as a loser without hope of promotion, having failed his sergeant's exam no fewer than eighteen times. This Beau puts down to a \\"slight lack of composure\\" during moments of stress. On one occasion, when confronted with a difficult question, he ate the exam paper. According to his file, which Beau secretly reads while supposedly cleaning up the sergeant's desk, he is an \\"utterly brainless idiot\\" and suffering from \\"terminal ugliness\\". Beau does however view himself as a brave, gallant, witty, handsome, intellectual, and cultured individual, and does appear to be cleverer than the majority of people in the fort. When he was young, Beau wanted to be a concert pianist, or a great conductor, and often attempts to escape the confines of his dreary existence by going down to the saloon at the local casbah and getting blind drunk. =Dennis Pratt= Dennis is the extremely slow-witted best friend of Beau, the only person who has any patience for him, and vice versa. Dennis is a very simple-minded soul, vulgar, and a bit of a womaniser, although he is actually one of the comic's most likeable characters. Being very dense, Dennis has an inability to grasp the simplest of everyday concepts, and is very childlike. He enjoys attempting to do magic tricks, which he is famously bad at. He has a brother named Hector, who is equally dim and visits the fort occasionally, and a sister called Mavis, which is also the name of his first girlfriend. Dennis is rather brave, but this is down to his stupidity rather than nerve. Dennis likes to be read stories before bed, and is apparently aware of his own stupidity. He wishes to be smart like Beau, because he often does not understand what Beau says. =Doris= Beau Peep's estranged wife Doris is never actually seen in the comics, although her speech bubbles are seen in various strips with Doris herself just out of view. Doris is described as very ugly, having many chins, a large frame, an ape-like stance, short legs, and generally terrifying. Her knuckles drag on the floor when she walks. She is madly in love with Beau, and follows him everywhere, even into the desert, although has not found him at the fort yet in the twenty years Beau has been there. Beau is in constant fear of being discovered by Doris, who is the reason why Beau joined the Foreign Legion in the first place. Doris can be aggressive, and she threatens to punch the Nomad many times. The Nomad is, however, perplexingly madly in love with Doris. =The Nomad= One of the most significant supporting characters of the comic strip, this nomadic Arab lives alone in the desert, and is never named. He was exiled from a local Tuareg tribe for 'nicking' (stealing), and will not be allowed back unless he proves himself by presenting the head of an enemy warrior. For this reason, the Nomad occasionally tries to take over the fort, often failing for stupid reasons, such as forgetting his ladder, forgetting that there is only one of him, or attempting to infiltrate the fort using ridiculous disguises. Beau Peep has outwitted the Nomad on numerous occasions, meaning he has become a mortal enemy of the Nomad. However the Nomad is fond of singing and dancing, and loves sweeties. He still believes that the Earth is flat. He also has the nickname \\"Bobby Brains, the desert whiz kid\\". He harbours an unshakable belief that he is a best-selling author waiting to be discovered. His quest for publication began with his autobiography Sand in my Y-fronts. It was rejected by his own mother, as were Sand in my Y-fronts II and Sand in my Y-fronts – The Musical. He also believes he is a talented golfer (he calls himself Tiger Nomad) and has many times tried to be elected as an MP (slogan: \\"Vote for me or I set the dogs on You\\"). =Honest Abdul= Honest Adbul is a travelling salesman in the desert and the owner of a merchant caravan selling all manner of goods. He is best known in this strip for selling unremarkable, ordinary and everyday items to the slow-witted Dennis at exorbitant prices by claiming the items to be special. He also cheats the Nomad numerous times, such as selling him a rubber duck which Abdul claimed was an \\"enemy detector.\\" =Sergeant Bidet= Described as having a quality that no one else in the comic has – sanity. Bidet has a distinct loathing of the cowardly and useless Beau Peep, whom he regrets ever taking on in the first place and has had to endure for the past twenty years. Bidet has often considered shooting Beau and ending his \\"nightmare.\\" He often sends Beau out on dangerous and even suicidal missions, which usually causes Beau to break down in tears. When Beau survives by either fleeing from danger or by pure chance, rather than skill or ability, the Sergeant often breaks down in tears himself, due to the fact Beau has survived yet again and Bidet knows he must endure Beau Peep's stupidity forever. =Egon= Egon is the chef or cook of the fort, and is beyond being described as unhygienic and unclean, as his habits are downright psychotically revolting. Egon is depicted as being covered in filth, constantly having flies buzzing round his head, keeping rats and cockroaches as pets in his kitchen, and keeping his feet warm in dishes such as fish pie and soup which he then feeds to the soldiers. He has an eye-patch covering his right eye. All his recipes have mince as the main ingredient, including the so-called vegetarian ones, and his one great ambition is to open a classy Parisian restaurant called \\"Monsieur Mince.\\" Egon also appears to be an alcoholic. He loves the drinks cooking sherry and vodka. He also has a bad temper, once holding Beau over the wall of the fort by the ankles because he made a joke about Egon's cooking. Egon does however get on with Beau better than most people in the fort and even sometimes comes to Beau for advice on certain subjects, and to consult Beau on his mediocre cooking skills, which are yet still superior to Egon's. =Mad Pierre= The fort's resident bully, Pierre is a towering hulk of a man, completely unhinged, and whom nobody will dare call \\"mad\\" to his face. Not a man to mess with, he uses violence as a first resort. He once beat up Beau Peep for \\"using a sentence which contained an uneven number of vowels.\\" Pierre's interests include smacking Beau in the mouth, and cracking his knuckles. Seems to leave Dennis alone, because hitting Beau is too much fun. Beau has come to a compromise with Pierre at times, and has also tried flattery, but this doesn't last long before Beau's face comes back into contact with Pierre's fist. =Colonel Escargot= The highly eccentric fort commander. His bizarre grip on the real world can be summed up by his belief that \\"those warmongers of Switzerland\\" have declared war on him. He is totally unsuitable for the job as he is completely and totally insane, often ordering Beau to perform ridiculously stupid tasks. Is receiving psychiatric help, but as he is oblivious to his insanity (and because he is the CO) he chooses to ignore it. He shot his shrink and falls in love with his tablets, believing them to be small women. The only person the colonel goes easy on is his son, who occasionally visits the fort and gets an easy ride whilst there. =Vera of the Seven Veils= An exotic belly dancer and stripper at the local saloon, the men at the fort go crazy for her, especially Dennis, who is madly in love with her. Dennis' advances usually end up with him receiving a punch in the mouth, yet still Dennis fantasizes about Vera every day and counts down the days until he can see her again. =Hamish= A Scottish soldier at the fort, whose accent is so thick nobody can understand him except when they are themselves drunk. Hamish joined the Foreign Legion when his beloved Dundee United F.C. lost a cup-tie to Arbroath F.C. and he could take it no more, and had to get out of Scotland. He often talks of \\"the wild and rugged Glens\\" of his homeland – the Glens being the family who lived in the opposite tenement. He has adapted his favourite song, \\"The Campbells Are Coming\\", to suit his new environment. Expect to hear \\"The Camels Are Coming\\" in a future Eurovision Song Contest where Hamish intends to enter it. He gets on quite well with Beau. =Sopwith= Beau's camel, named after a famous aeroplane. Sopwith is seemingly intelligent and understands what Beau is saying to him, and Sopwith stubbornly refuses to obey any command given to him. Sopwith will often deliberately throw Beau off his back, or spit in his face whilst Beau is attempting to talk down to the animal. After such acts, Sopwith can often be seen with a smirk on his face. =The Vultures= A father-son duo where the generation gap has never been wider. The father, a traditionalist, adheres to the vulture anthem, \\"we eat dead camels and any other mammals\\". The son is a vegetarian who started a band for punk vultures or \\"Punctures\\" for short. Actually the term \\"generation gap\\" doesn't do this relationship justice. This is a \\"generation Grand Canyon\\". =Minor characters= Other characters occasionally appear in the strip and include: Astro the Soothsayer, a fortune teller with a tent in the desert. \\"Headline\\" Harry, a journalist always looking for a scoop. Sergeant Dirk B. Slaughter, a violent replacement when Sgt Bidet is on leave. Llandudno Jones, an intrepid Welsh explorer.

The animals are commonly referred to as \\"yeti lobsters\\" or \\"yeti crabs\\", after the legendary yeti, because of their \\"hairy\\" or bristly appearance. The genus is placed in its own family, Kiwaidae, in the superfamily Chirostyloidea. Four species have been described: Kiwa hirsuta discovered in 2005 on the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, Kiwa puravida discovered in 2006 at cold seeps in the East Pacific (all other species are from hydrothermal vents), Kiwa tyleri, known colloquially as the \\"Hoff crab\\", from the East Scotia Ridge, and Kiwa araonae from the Australian-Antarctic Ridge. Two similar but undescribed species are known from vents on the South West Indian Ridge and at the Galápagos respectively. Analysis of DNA has confirmed the distinction of the species, them having diverged from each other millions of years ago. The third undescribed species of Kiwa was discovered in 2010 in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean at vents on the East Scotia Ridge. Compared with the first two species, it has proportionally much shorter chelae, with the majority of the bacteria-growing setae concentrated on the ventral carapace. Population of Kiwa around a hydrothermal vent Based on the presence of sulphur-oxidising bacteria on the setae of both K. hirsuta and the new South West Indian Ridge species, they may both feed on bacteria in addition to scavenging. For K. puravida, the bacteria have been identified and the feeding behaviour observed, as well as a cyclical rhythmic motion of the crab documented that is suspected to increase the flow of methane and sulfide, the bacterial food, towards the bacteria. The two sexes of the new South West Indian Ridge species prefer different temperatures, with males seeming to prefer warmer water and egg-carrying females and juveniles preferring the coldest. The genus Kiwa is named after \\"the goddess of the shellfish in the Polynesian mythology\\", although Kiwa is a male guardian of the sea in Maori mythology. Internal anatomy Internal anatomy has been studied in Kiwa puravida. Digestive system: The stomach (gastric mill + pylorus) is situated in the upper anterior portion of the cephalothorax. The gut extends as a tube to the telson. A pair of short anterior ceca emanates from the transition between pylorus and gut, appearing as short tubes. The hepatopancreas fills most of the cephalothorax and parts of the pleon and is formed by two bunches of tubular diverticles which are each connected to the pylorus via a main duct. The stomach is embedded ventrally by the hepatopancreas whose anterior diverticles reach into the rostrum. Antennal glands: The antennal glands are flatenned and located anterolaterally in the cephalothorax, near the second antennae. the lobes of the antennal bladder are situated anteriorly and laterally to the stomach and cover a large portion of the hepatopancreas. Reproductive system: The testes are paired and restricted to the cephalothorax. They are connected to the vasa deferentia on each side which run to the gonopores on the coxae of the eighth thoracic segment. Nervous system: The brain is the anteriormost part of the central nervous system. It is relatively small compared to the rest of the body. Emanating from the brain several nerves run to the sensory organs (eyes, antennulae, antennae). A pair of circumesophageal (\\"surrounding the esophagus\\") connectives connect the brain with the cephalothoracic ganglion. The latter is a compaction of several neuromeres in the lower part of the anterior cephalothorax. These neuromeres correspond morphologically with the body segments of the mandibles and the 1st and 2nd maxillae, the thoracic segments I-VIII and the first pleonal segment. The 2nd to 6th pleonal neuromeres form separate ganglia. They are arranged in an irregular segmental pattern with the sixth pleonal segment reaching into the sixth pleonal segment. Circulatory system: The heart is located in the upper portion of the cephalothorax below the carapace and above the anterior portion of the gut. The heart is suspended by several ligaments within the pericardial sinus which is bordered by the pericardial septum. Three pairs of openings (ostia) connect sinus and interior heart space. The interior heart is crossed by asymmetrical arranged muscular bundles which are part of the heart muscle (myocard). Seven arteries which can be categorized into five artery systems (two paired, three unpaired) emanate from the heart and run to the respective organs and body regions. After having left the arteries and having washed around the tissues the \\"blood\\" (hemolymph) is channelled to the gill (branchial) sinus via crevices (lacunae) and channels (sinus). After its oxygenation the hemolymph is returning to the pericardial sinus via the branchio-pericardial sinus. Muscle systems: The general structure and organization of the various muscle systems in Kiwa (puravida) is congruent with that of other decapods.

Grooved rails (or girder rails) are often used to provide a protective flangeway in the trackwork in city streets. Like standard rail tracks, tram tracks consist of two parallel steel rails. Tram rails can be placed on several surfaces, such as with standard rails on sleepers like railway tracks, or with grooved rails on concrete sleepers into street surfaces (pavement) for street running. Tram rails in street have the disadvantage that they pose a risk to cyclists. An environmentally friendly or ecologically friendly alternative is to lay tracks into grass turf surfaces; this is known as grassed track (or track in a lawn), first used in Liverpool in 1924. History Tramway tracks have been in existence since the mid 16th century. They were previously made of wood, but during the late 18th century iron and later steel came into use prominently. The first street tramways were laid in 1832 in New York by John Stephenson to assist horses pulling buses on dirt roads, especially when the roads were muddy from wet weather. The rails enabled a horse to easily pull a load of 10 tonnes compared to 1 tonne on a dirt road. The evolution of street tramway tracks paralleled the transition from horse power to mechanical and electric power. In a dirt road, the rails needed a foundation, usually a mass concrete raft. Highway authorities often made tramway companies pave the rest of the road, usually with granite or similar stone blocks, at extra cost. The first tramways had a rail projecting above the road surface, or a step set into the road, both of which were apt to catch the narrow tyres of horse-drawn carriages. The invention by Alphonse Loubat in 1852 of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove. Grooved rail A grooved rail, groove rail, or girder rail is a special rail with a groove designed for tramway or railway track in pavement or grassed surfaces (grassed track or track in a lawn). The rail has the railhead on one side and the guard on the other. The guard provides accommodation for the flange. The guard carries no weight, but may act as a checkrail. Grooved rail was invented in 1852 by Alphonse Loubat, a French inventor who developed improvements in tram and rail equipment, and helped develop tram lines in New York City and Paris. The invention of grooved rail enabled tramways to be laid without causing a nuisance to other road users, except unsuspecting cyclists, who could get their wheels caught in the groove. The grooves may become filled with gravel and dirt (particularly if infrequently used or after a period of idleness) and need clearing from time to time, this being done by a \\"scrubber\\" tram. Failure to clear the grooves can lead to a bumpy ride for the passengers, damage to either wheel or rail and possibly derailing. =Girder guard rail= The traditional form of grooved rail is the girder guard section illustrated below. This rail is a modified form of flanged rail and requires a special mounting for weight transfer and gauge stabilisation. If the weight is carried by the roadway subsurface, steel ties are needed at regular intervals to maintain the gauge. Installing these means that the whole surface needs to be excavated and reinstated. =Block rail= Block rail is a lower profile form of girder guard rail, where the web is eliminated. In profile it is more like a solid form of bridge rail with a flangeway and guard added. Simply removing the web and combining the head section directly with the foot section would result in a weak rail, so additional thickness is required in the combined section.Grooved or girder rail =Prefabricated grooved rail= A modern version of the grooved block rail has a lower mass and is inserted into a prefabricated spanning concrete girder such as the LR55 LR55 prefab rail without web but fully supported by noise reducing polyurethane grout or a girder rail such as P-CAT City Metro P-CAT City Metro rail is embedded. The prefabricated units if used with ultra light trams can be embedded into existing road base with possibly a reduced requirement for underground services diversions. Track gauge Electrification Electrification needed other developments, most notably heavier rails to cope with electric tramcars weighing 12 tonnes rather than the 4 tonne horse-drawn variety; switching points, as electric trams could not be pulled onto the correct track by horses; and the need for electrical connections, to provide the return path for the electric current, which was usually supplied through an overhead wire. =Conduit and stud systems= In some cities where overhead electric cables were deemed intrusive, underground conduits with electrical conductors were used. Examples of this were New York, Washington DC, Paris, London, Brussels and Budapest. The conduit system of electrical power was very expensive to install and maintain, although Washington did not close until 1962. Attempts were made with alternative systems not needing overhead wires. There were many systems of “surface” contact, where studs were set in the road surface, and energised by a passing tram, either mechanically or magnetically, to supply power through a skate carried under the tram. Unfortunately these systems all failed due to the problem of reliability and not always turning off after the tram had passed, resulting in the occasional electrocution of horses and dogs. In the last five years a new system of surface contact has been installed in the Bordeaux tramway by Alstom. Cable haulage Prior to the universal introduction of electric power, many tramways were cable hauled, with a continuous cable carried in a conduit under the road, and with a slot in the road surface through which the tram could clasp the cable for motion. This system can still be seen in San Francisco in California as well as the system of the Great Orme in Wales. These needed a rather more substantial track formation.

It is located in the Moselle département, about 2 miles(3 km) west of the town of Phalsbourg, on the north side of the Route nationale 4 (N4) Highway adjacent to the village Saint-Jean- Kourtzerode; 29 miles (47 km) northwest of Strasbourg. During the Cold War, Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base was a front-line base for the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE).  Origins  Prior to 1950, there were no existing airfields in the Phalsbourg area. With the advent of the Cold War in the late 1940s and the formation of NATO, agreements were made to expand the United States military presence in western Europe. The United States would also provide some of the tactical air power. This led to the expansion of the United States Air Forces in Europe. The United States would eventually base combat aircraft and personnel in Belgium, England, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and West Germany. In 1950, U.S. representatives began a series of discussions with the French to select air bases and negotiate the details of establishing a large USAF presence. USAFE desired an air field in Alsace or Lorraine due to their eastern location near the Rhine River, but at the time, there were no existing airfields that could meet NATO requirements. The agreed airfield site was west of the city of Phalsbourg, adjacent to French National Route N4 on gently rolling farmland. USAF use The USAF wanted to base a fighter wing at Phalsbourg by 1955. In February 1952 the 7040th Air Base Squadron was activated to administer the base and provide coordination for the various construction activities. Highway N4 was moved a half-mile to the south, and by the summer of 1952, work began on the site preparation of the base. Construction continued during 1953, and in 1954, the base was nearing completion. By the spring of 1955 the runways, taxiways and hangars were constructed, however the base was barely habitable because few roads were paved and the utilities were not yet installed. On 4 February 1955 Twelfth Air Force took possession of Phalsbourg AB, although no combat wing or aircraft had been assigned. Tactical Air Command advised USAFE that due to budget limitations, it would be unable to establish a tactical air fighter/bomber wing at the base until 1961. The design of the airfield was to space parked aircraft as far apart as possible by the construction of a circular Marguerite system of hardstands that could be revetted later with earth for added protection. Typically the Marguerite consisted of fifteen to eighteen hardstands around a large central hangar. Each hardstand held one or two aircraft, and allowed the planes to be spaced approximately 150 feet (50 m) apart. Each squadron was assigned to a separate hangar/hardstand complex. This construction can be seen clearly in the satellite image link at the bottom of this article. The 7040th ABS continued as the caretaker unit of the base until being replaced by the 7486th Air Base Group in 1955. Phalsbourg was kept in a reserve standby status after the construction was completed. = 23rd Helicopter Squadron = CH-21 Shawnee The first USAF unit to be stationed at Phalsbourg AB was the 23rd Helicopter Squadron. The 23d activated on 9 July 1956 at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee, then deployed to Phalsbourg in November. At Phalsbourg, the 23rd flew the Piasecki H-21B. These helicopters provided typical helicopter airlift missions such as special air lift, administrative support, and emergency air evacuation. The helicopters arrived at Phalsbourg during November, being shipped by ocean freight from Brookley AFB, Alabama via Bremerhaven West Germany, then flown to Phalsbourg by 23rd squadron pilots. The 23rd consisted of 4 detachments: * Det 1 and 4 were based at Phalsbourg with 10 H-21s * Det 2 was based at RAF Wethersfield, United Kingdom with 4 H-21's * Det 3 was based at Wheelus Air Base, Libya with 4 H-21's. The 23rd was the only helicopter squadron in USAFE and had difficulties operating, because it was not allowed to fly at night in France and had insufficient manning to provide complete base/wing operations. The helicopters at Wethersfield were equipped for air-sea rescue flights, while the ones at Wheelus supported the 7272nd Flying Training Wing to support gunnery range operations and flight test operations of the Matador cruise missile program. USAFE felt that with the Army developing similar capabilities in France and the limitations of the helicopter airlift missions at Phalsbourg, retaining the 23rd was not worth the costs, and the unit was inactivated on 8 January 1958. The 10 helicopters at Phalsbourg and 2 from RAF Wethersfield were returned to CONUS, being assigned to Brookley AFB, the others being retained at Wheelus for range operations. = 10th and 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wings = In January 1958, the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Spangdahlem AB Germany deployed the 32nd and 38th TRSquadrons, flying the RF-84F to Phalsbourg while the runway at Spangdahlem was under repair and renovation. During May, the 10th TRW began receiving new RF-101A \\"Voodoos\\" from CONUS and the RF-84's squadrons were transferred to the 66th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing which was then based at Sembach AB also in Germany. Because the runway conditions at Sembach were not suitable for F-84 operations, the two squadrons of the 66th, the 32nd and 38th were moved to Phalsbourg during the spring and summer of 1958. The stay of the 66th TRW would be brief, as the wing was being transferred to Laon AB, but they remained TDY at Phalsbourg until the end of September 1958 until Laon's runway was ready for them. = 513th Fighter Interceptor Squadron = North American F-86D-45-NA Sabre Serial 52-4063 of the 513th Fighter Interceptor Squadron The 513th Fighter Interceptor Squadron arrived at Phalsbourg on 16 April 1958 from RAF Manston, England. The 513th FIS flew the F-86D \\"Sabre\\", performing an all- weather air defense mission as part of the 406th Fighter-Bomber Wing. Twenty- six F-86D's were assigned to the squadron at Phalsbourg. They were marked with a red and black sunburst on their vertical stabilizer/rudder with an eagle emblem. The Squadron commander during that era was Col. Robert Rankin a member of the famed World War II 56th Fighter Group and the first ace in a day in the European theater. On 1 May the 406th was inactivated and the 513th FIS was assigned to the 86th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Ramstein AB, Germany. However, the squadron was assigned to Phalsbourg where it stood air defense alert. The F-86's provided the air defense of western Europe for the next five years. In January 1959, the Convair F-102 \\"Delta Dagger\\" began to replace the F-86 in the air defense role, and on 18 November 1960, the aircraft of the 513th FIS began to stand down. The 513th was assigned to the 86th Air Division as it prepared for its inactivation. The F-86's began to leave during November and December 1960 and the 513th FIS was inactivated on 8 January 1961. With the departure of the F-86's Phalsbourg AB was again placed in a reserve status with the 7486th Air Base Group serving as the caretaker unit. = 1961 Berlin Crisis = C-124Cs at Phalsbourg during 1961 Berlin Crisis. After almost two years without any permanent flying units, on 5 September 1961 Phalsbourg Air Base was reactivated as part of Operation Tack Hammer, the United States response to the Berlin Crisis.  102nd Tactical Fighter Wing  North American YF-86H-5-NA Sabre Serial 52-2116 of the 138th Tactical Fighter Squadron/102d Tactical Fighter Wing deployed at Phalsbourg - 1962. Originally manufactured as a pre-production F-86H, this aircraft was modified to production specifications before seeing operational service. During the summer of 1961, as the Berlin Crisis unfolded, several USAF reserve units were notified on 16 August of their pending activation and recall to active duty. On 1 October the Massachusetts Air National Guard 102nd Tactical Fighter Wing and its three fighter squadrons, the 101st, 131st, and 138th went on active duty at Otis AFB. The 138th TACFRON was a New York State Air National Guard unit situated in Syracuse New York at Hancock Field. It was added to the 101st and 131st from Otis. I was a member of the 138th and activated then and believe that Syracuse should get mention in this paragraph. I do not know if there is still an NYANG unit in Syracuse but this should be verifiable in a history of this unit. Between 28 and 30 October, the 102nd TFW departed Logan International Airport to Phalsbourg. The wing deployed 82 F-86H \\"Sabre\\"s. The 101st were marked with green stripes on their vertical stabilizers, the 131st with red stripes, and the 128th with yellow stripes. In addition 2 C-47 and 6 T-33 aircraft were assigned to the wing for support and training purposes. The 102nd's primary mission was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces and air interdiction. This involved keeping its aircraft on 24/7 alert. Starting on 5 December, the 102nd began deploying to Wheelus AB Libya for gunnery training. During its time in Europe, the 102nd participated in several USAF and NATO exercises, including a deployment to Leck Air Base, West Germany near the Danish border. At Leck, ground and support crews from both countries exchanged duties, learning how to perform aircraft maintenance and operational support tasks. On 7 May 1962, Seventeenth Air Force directed that the 102nd TFW would deploy back to CONUS during the summer, and the 102nd TFW returned to the United States in July 1962, Regular USAF personnel, along with a group of ANG personnel who volunteered to remain on active duty formed the 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the newly activated 366th Tactical Fighter Wing. During July and August the 102nd returned to Massachusetts, with the last of the ANG aircraft departing on 20 July. With their departure, Phalsbourg AB was again placed under the control of the 7486th Air Base Group serving as the host unit. After the departure of the 102nd TFW, a major refurbishing of the runway at Phalsbourg commenced, with the base closed to tactical aircraft operations until December. = 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron = Republic F-84F-40-RE Thunderstreak 52-6526 of the 480th TFS. This aircraft is now on permanent display at the Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright- Patterson AFB, Ohio The 366th Tactical Fighter Wing was a USAFE experiment. Wing Headquarters for the 366th was activated at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base on 8 May 1962, with 4 operational aircraft squadrons being equipped with the aircraft left behind by the deployed Air National Guard wings deployed to France as a result of the Berlin Crisis. The 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron arrived in December and reported to the 66th's TFW Wing Headquarters at Chaumont AB. The squadron was equipped with 20 F-84Fs, tail coded with a green band on their vertical stabilizers. Other squadrons of the 366th TFW were located at Etain, Chambley and Chaumont Air Bases. The mission of the 480th was to provide close air support to the Seventh U.S. Army as well as air defense. Like the 102nd preceding it, this required the squadron to be on 24/7 alert. During September 1962 the 480th began sending its pilots to Wheelus for training. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 the squadron assumed a total alert posture with fully bomb loaded aircraft on the alert pads. Bomb loads were frequently changed as targets were relocated during the initial days of the crisis. On 16 July 1963 the 480th TFS departed Phalsbourg and rejoined the rest of the 366th TFW at its new home at Holloman AFB New Mexico. With their departure, Phalsbourg AB was then placed in a reserve status by USAFE, and the 7369th Combat Support Group maintained Phalsbourg in a standby reserve status. Until 1966, the base saw occasional use by NATO for alerts and deployments of personnel and cargo into Germany for Reforger exercises. In October 1963 Phalsbourg was used by the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing deployed TDY from England Air Force Base Louisiana for about 40 days, flying F-100 \\"Super Sabre\\" aircraft from the base. The F-100's were the last tactical aircraft to operate from Phalsbourg Air Base. = USAF closure = On 7 March 1966, French President Charles De Gaulle announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by 1 April 1967. Since no active Wing was present, it was an uncomplicated process to deactivate Phalsbourg. On 15 February 1967 the American flag was lowered and the base returned to the French.  Current uses  After the USAF departure, Phalsbourg AB was used by the French Army as a helicopter base and a logistics depot. The base was renamed quartier La Horie. Currently, the 1er régiment d'hélicoptères de combat (1er RHC) Combat Helicopter Regiment operates from the base and flies Eurocopter Tiger, SA341D \\"Gazelles\\", SA 330 \\"Pumas\\", and AS 532 \\"Cougar\\". The base is well-maintained and has been expanded over the years, and remains a front-line French military facility.

Sri Lanka was affectionately known as Ratna-Dweepa which means Gem Island. The name is a reflection of its natural wealth. Marco Polo wrote that the island had the best sapphires, topazes, amethysts, and other gems in the world. Ptolemy, the 2nd century astronomer recorded that beryl and sapphire were the mainstay of Sri Lanka’s gem industry. Records from sailors that visited the island states that they brought back “jewels of Serendib”. Serendib was the ancient name given to the island by middle – eastern and Persian traders that crossed the Indian Ocean to trade gems from Sri Lanka to the East during the 4th and 5th century. Sri Lanka, geologically speaking is an extremely old country. Ninety percent of the rocks of the island are of Precambrian age, 560 million to 2,400 million years ago. The gems form in sedimentary residual gem deposits, eluvial deposits, metamorphic deposits, skarn and calcium-rich rocks. Nearly all the gem formations in Sri Lanka are located in the central high-grade metamorphic terrain of the Highland Complex. The gem deposits are classified as sedimentary, metamorphic and magmatic; the sedimentary types being the most abundant. The mineralogy of the gem deposits varies widely with, among others, corundum (sapphire, ruby), chrysoberyl, beryl, spinel, topaz, zircon, tourmaline, garnet being common.DISSANAYAKE, C.B., CHANDRAJITH, ROHANA and TOBSCHALL, H.J. 2000. The geology, mineralogy and rare element geochemistry of the gem deposits of Sri Lanka. Bulletin of the Geological Society of Finland 72, Parts 1– 2, 5–20. Residual deposits are mainly found in flood plains of rivers and streams. The metamorphic types of gems constitute 90% of the gem deposits in Sri Lanka. It has been estimated that nearly 25% of the total land area of Sri Lanka is potentially gem-bearing, making Sri Lanka one of the countries with the highest density of gem deposits compared to its landmass.Dissanayake, C.B. 1991.

They were finally withdrawn in 1972. They were the inspiration for the CIÉ 2600 Class. History After 1945 the GNR(I) found itself in a poor financial position as a result of the deprivations of World War II and increased competition from road traffic. It looked to diesel power as a way to streamline costs and bring them back into profitability. Along with diesel locomotives, railcars offered a cheaper and more flexible means of traction than steam-hauled coaches. As a result, in June 1950 the GNR(I) introduced the first of 20 diesel-mechanical railcars (numbers 600–619) ordered from AEC Ltd. of Southall. Design These cars, based on a 1930s AEC/Great Western Railway design, were powered by two AEC underfloor engines of 125 hp, each one driving the inner axle of one bogie through a five-speed, pre-selective epicyclic gearbox. They cost £18,500 each () and were capable of . The bodywork was built by Park Royal Vehicles, which like AEC was part of the ACV Group. The design incorporated a full width cab at the front and a guard's and luggage compartment at the rear, as well as a steam-generating unit. Passenger accommodation was in two saloons, a 12-seater first-class saloon, located immediately behind the driving cab, giving passengers a clear view to the line ahead, and 32 seater third-class saloon. The power cars could operate with either one or two unpowered intermediate coaches. These coaches were built by the GNR(I) at its Dundalk Works. The GNR(I) railcars were painted in cream & dark blue Service Although limited to four coaches, the AEC's were put in service on the Dublin – Belfast Enterprise service. As a result, these units had the distinction of being the first successful main line diesel railcars in either Ireland or Britain. Upon dissolution of the GNR in 1958, 10 AEC's went to CIÉ (Where they joined the existing fleet of AEC railcars, with each vehicle number receiving an 'n' suffix), and 10 went to the UTA. The UTA had experimented with AEC railcars in 1951 as well, turning out two power cars, No.'s 6 and 7. The former GNR's AEC's (Now renumbered 111 -120) were technically compatible with 6 and 7. All 20 were scrapped during the 1970s- CIÉ's inherited 10 were not suitable for conversion to push-pull like their original 60, and were cut up in Mullingar in 1975. The UTA's inherited 10 were subsequently inherited by NIR in 1968 and withdrawn by their new owners in 1972. CIÉ's AEC Railcars At the same time as the GNR order, CIÉ ordered 60 (numbers 2600-2659) almost identical versions of the AEC Class as part of its dieselisation programme. These were delivered and put in service between 1951 and 1954. They had improved acceleration over steam traction, with a 15–25 minutes reduction on the Dublin-Waterford running time. They were painted in dark green with pale green lining at the waist. The CIÉ versions were put on mainline duty and on Cork and suburban lines, as well as the Waterford and Tramore line (2657–59). They were also introduced on the West Cork network to replace the existing steam hauled services. Some of CIÉ AECs were converted to push-pull driving car in 1973–74 for use on Dublin suburban services, propelled by rebuilt CIE 201 Class diesel locomotives. They became redundant with the introduction of the electrification of the service by the introduction of the Dublin Area Rapid Transit and so were phased out in 1987. The sole preserved example of the 60 CIÉ cars (Or any Irish AEC railcar, for that matter) is No. 2624 (renumbered as Push-Pull/DVT 6111), based at the Downpatrick and County Down Railway since 7 February 2015. CIÉ's initial order of 60 AEC's was bolstered in 1956 by six Bullied-designed cars, and again in 1958 when they received 10 cars from the GNR's original order. Model An 00 gauge model of a Park Royal AEC railcar is available as an etched-brass kit from Worsley Works. A Ready to Run OO gauge model is available from Silver Fox Models. It is available as the NIR and the Irish Railways version in various liveries.

The first five were shown as specials during the 1957–58 television season. The remaining eight were originally shown as part of Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse. Its original network title was The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the first season, and Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse Presents The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show for the following seasons. The successor to the classic comedy, I Love Lucy, the programs featured the same cast members: Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley, and Little Ricky (billed as Richard Keith in his post-Lucy–Desi acting assignments). The production schedule avoided the grind of a regular weekly series. Desilu produced the show, which was mostly filmed at their Los Angeles studios with occasional on-location shoots at Lake Arrowhead, Las Vegas, and Sun Valley, Idaho. CBS reran these thirteen specials under the \\"Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour\\" title as prime-time summer replacements, from 1962 to 1965, with a final run in 1967. 1966–67 was the first TV season in which all first-run prime time network shows were in color. These \\"Lucy–Desi\\" repeats were the only black and white series aired that year, after which it, and I Love Lucy, went into syndication. Premise Arnaz was often questioned why he changed the format of I Love Lucy, a weekly, 30-minute program produced at 25 new episodes a season very successfully, to the Comedy Hour format of one-hour specials shown weeks or months apart. He noted at the time: \\"You've got to change in this business. Lucy is my favorite character ever and I love \\"I Love Lucy\\" it's my favorite show. I'd rather make a big change while we are still ahead. It would be ridiculous for us to wait until people got sick and tired of the regular half-hour every Monday night. We have been the luckiest show on the air, but we've worked for it. I have never worked so hard in my life. And while I suppose it's not really for me to say, I think I can honestly say that we have never done a really bad show in six years.\\" He also noted the high stakes involved in the cost per episode ($350,000): \\"They not only have to be good, they have to be great. We're going to be in an awful spot with these shows; they've got to be good.\\"'The \\"I Love Lucy\\" Book, Bart Andrews, 1985 Arnaz's determination to change scheduling formats went back several years, as far back as 1954. \\"When I first suggested it, CBS wouldn't listen. Last year (1956) again, they talked me into continuing with the weekly half-hour. But this time (1957) I made up my mind.\\" Keeping the main plot line of the I Love Lucy program allowed Comedy Hour to retain the main cast. It also allowed Arnaz to drop any hint of continuity by releasing all of the I Love Lucy characters and substituting them with celebrity guest stars. That concept, which proved so successful during the program's Hollywood episodes in seasons 4 & 5, was what Arnaz had in mind when he commented \\"you can't stand still.\\" Except for the main characters (still played by Ball, Arnaz, Vance, Frawley, and Thibodeau) only one fictional character from I Love Lucy appeared on Comedy Hour: Lucy's mother, as Little Ricky's babysitter, in \\"The Ricardos Go to Japan\\"; columnist Hedda Hopper played herself in \\"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\\" as she had in episode 118 of the original series, \\"The Hedda Hopper Story.\\" Arnaz believed the use of celebrity stars would allow him to demand higher fees, take some pressure off himself portraying Ricky Ricardo, and keep the \\"Lucy\\" concept fresh by encouraging continued ratings success. Although done during the last season of I Love Lucy, the move to Connecticut allowed the writers to expand possible script ideas as they had \\"used up every conceivable story line that could be set in the tiny New York apartment.\\" Not noted publicly at the time, Arnaz was suffering serious health problems, and had been ordered by doctors to cut back on his work and acting schedule. When he entered into negotiations with CBS, for a seventh season of I Love Lucy, Arnaz insisted Desilu be allowed to change to the hour format and a monthly production schedule. CBS president William S. Paley would have sued Desilu had Arnaz's health not been an issue but instead agreed to the change. Arnaz quickly found a new sponsor for the 1957–1958 season: Ford Motor Company.'Desilu' Sanders/Gilbert, 1993 Originally Comedy Hour was slated to produce 10 original episodes per season. However, due to high production costs Arnaz cut that to eight, then five episodes. Five were produced in season one (1957–1958) and season two (1958–1959) then cut back to three in season three (1959–1960). Description and evaluation The first episode \\"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\\" is an extended flashback of how Lucy met Ricky. L-R: Ann Sothern, Rudy Vallee, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Cesar Romero, Vivian Vance and William Frawley (1957) During the final season of I Love Lucy (episode 14), the Ricardos, soon followed by the Mertzes, had moved to Westport, Connecticut, reflecting the growth of the suburbs throughout America during the 1950s. Ricky commuted into New York City where he now owned Club Babalu. A key part of the Comedy Hour format was guest stars in each episode, including Hedda Hopper; Ann Sothern; Rudy Vallee; Cesar Romero; Tallulah Bankhead; Fred MacMurray and June Haver; Betty Grable and Harry James; Fernando Lamas; Maurice Chevalier; Danny Thomas and his Make Room for Daddy co-stars; Red Skelton; Paul Douglas; Ida Lupino and Howard Duff; Milton Berle; Bob Cummings; and, in the final episode, \\"Lucy Meets the Moustache\\", Ernie Kovacs and Edie Adams. Comedy Hour episodes focused on Lucy's interaction with the celebrity guest stars. Although still a key character, Ricky isn't a major part of the episodes and has less interaction with Lucy. Nearly every episode features his not allowing her to do something, which allows Lucy to interact with the guest stars to confound Ricky. Ricky's 'manic' personality has changed as well, and by the last episode (aired in April 1960) he's more subtle, almost depressed, and appears tired. His contributions are generally low-key (with the exception of the 'Berle' episode). Fred and Ethel are featured in fewer plot themes after the move to Connecticut, although Ethel does help Lucy carry out her schemes. Although noted in I Love Lucy as the main reason they were able to afford moving to Connecticut, the joint Ricardo-Mertz egg business is only mentioned once. Fred assumes his role as Ricky's band manager. As noted Arnaz had each episode written to 'stand alone' in order to expand themes and plots using celebrity guests. He also expected those guest stars to have significant screen time. Arnaz, Vance, and Frawley all had their dialog and screen time reduced a great deal compared to I Love Lucy. This reduction was not well received by Vance, who considered leaving. Frawley, however, was happy with the reduction which gave him more time to attend to his other interests. New friends from the I Love Lucy Connecticut episodes, the Ramseys (or the Mortons), were not in the Comedy Hour cast and are only mentioned twice, each as babysitters for Little Ricky. Besides the Mertzes the only character from the I Love Lucy show to appear on the Comedy Hour were Lucy's mother (who appeared briefly in the \\"Japan\\" episode) as Little Ricky's grandma.The first hour had Hedda Hopper in\\"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\\").This episode originally ran 75 minutes and Desi had to get permission to air the show intact cutting into the next show on the network-schedule. Unfortunately,after the initial showing on CBS Prime-Time it subsequently was edited down to fit in the 60 minute version that aired during the summers of 1962-1965 and finally 1967. Little Ricky is used more but is still a minor character. Most feature him playing the drums, coming and going (examples include \\"The Celebrity Next Door\\" and, in several, off to school or some other function); he has no friends, unlike the 6th season of I Love Lucy, where a few are noted (\\"Little Ricky Gets Stage Fright\\", \\"Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums\\", several of the Connecticut episodes, etc.); and no plot theme centers on him. Also the Ricardos do not interact with any neighbors in Westport (\\"The Celebrity Next Door\\" is the exception, although Bankhead appears in only that episode and features Lucy's only work with the PTA); and the town, a major plot theme in season 6 of I Love Lucy, is hardly mentioned except in passing. \\"Lucy Wins a Race Horse\\", with Harry James and Betty Grable (1958) Episodes are one hour. Production costs were estimated to be $350,000 per episode. Arnaz had originally proposed to run 10 episodes (one per month) but the high production costs forced Desilu to taper this to 5 episodes each in the 1957–1958, 1958–1959 seasons and only 3 in the final season (1959–1960). Arnaz had signed Debbie Reynolds to appear in a season 4 episode to be broadcast in January, 1961 and had been preparing to produce 3 specials for the 1960–1961 season. Ball and Arnaz divorced in May, 1960. After the final Lucy-Desi program the two never worked together onscreen again, although Arnaz executive produced the first 15 of The Lucy Show episodes before leaving Desilu Productions in 1962. Ratings for each episode broadcast (including reruns) during the 1957–58 and 1958–59 seasons were all good. However, by the start of the 1959–60 season, with the habit of viewing Lucy broken up every few months, being broadcast on different nights, as well as the obvious tension revealed between Ball and Arnaz (due to their real-life marriage unraveling), viewing dropped and it was no longer a major hit in the ratings. Critics commented on the lackluster quality and poor scripts. Cast performances were also panned. The interaction between Ricky and Lucy, a major element of the original program's success, was not up to par (reflecting Ball's and Arnaz's personal problems). Because of these problems (and Desi spending more time trying to maintain Desilu), the live studio audience was replaced with a laugh track by the final season (although both Milton Berle and writer Bob Schiller stated in The Lucy Book by Geoffrey Mark Fidelman, that for the ninth-season premiere, \\"Milton Berle Hides Out at The Ricardos\\", a live audience was brought in for some of the scenes to give a sense of timing). In the penultimate episode of the series, titled \\"The Ricardos Go to Japan\\", Lucy was red-eyed due to her crying during the arguments between herself and Desi (although not seen on- screen due to the show being filmed in black and white). \\"Lucy Goes to Alaska\\" with Red Skelton (1959) While in production of the final episode, \\"Lucy Meets the Mustache\\", tensions between them were so high that Ball and Arnaz couldn't speak to each other without having loud arguments or shouting matches on set. They soon realized it would be best if they didn't speak directly to each other there and instead used surrogates to carry messages or questions back and forth. This allowed them time to calm down and stay in character when the script required them to act. Filmed on March 3, 1960 Ball started divorce proceedings the next day. In the final episode, Edie Adams chose to sing \\"That's All\\", later commenting that she personally chose the song, unaware of Ball and Arnaz marital problems or their pending divorce. Adams and her husband, the avant garde comedian Ernie Kovacs, guested starred on what turned out to be the final new episode ever made of I Love Lucy and the last time its characters: Fred, Ethel, Little Ricky, Ricky and Lucy would ever be seen. Adams commented that Ball's emotions were up and down the entire week of rehearsals and that she had commented to Kovacs how harshly Ball was treating her. Kovacs passed that along to Arnaz who took Adams aside and explained to her that Lucy was under a lot of pressure and wasn't feeling very good. And that she should just be herself and not let Ball push her around. She took his advice and things between them were fine. Kovacs never commented publicly about the episode or the famous couple. Adams stated that the mood on set was tense and sad. Although it had yet to be publicly announced, all of the Desilu executives, the cast and crew knew the fate of the stars' marriage and the effect their divorce would have on the series. Critics have generally regarded the series as a rather pallid continuation of I Love Lucy, with not enough of the original show's brisk pace and memorable sketchwork, and an excessive use of celebrity guest-stars. Still, many fans enjoy the series because of the cast, which remained intact from the original. The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour is occasionally seen on nostalgia outlets like TV Land in its original hour-long format, or in edited thirty-minute installments (beginning in 1987) as We Love Lucy and run directly after the sixth season of I Love Lucy the additional \\"episodes\\" broadcast as a 7th season of I Love Lucy. Me-TV broadcast the program in the original one-hour format during the summer of 2012.Me-TV Broadcast Schedule 2013 The Decades Channel ran a weekend binge marathon of Lucy-Desi in August 2015. With just 13 episodes produced and broadcast during its 3-year run the series was released as one DVD box collection separate from the I Love Lucy sets. The show is briefly memorialized in the Lucille Ball- Desi Arnaz Center in Jamestown, New York.

The task of updating the theme fell to music arranger Frank Comstock, who kept most of the theme (like the harp \\"hits\\") similar, but added were more syncopation and flourishes, as well as a few \\"punch\\" notes. Even though Wilbur Hatch was still musical conductor, studio musicians were employed to record the theme, as the Desi Arnaz Orchestra had been disbanded.

There are two small grocery stores which are a 30-minute walk from Chilseo to Chilwon. Most of the landscape is filled with rice fields and grassy mountains. There is an elementary school located in Chilwon, a middle school and highschool in Chilseo along with a close by Christian church. Surprisingly, there is only one temple, which is located in Chilwon, yet three Christian churches. There is no bus station, but various bus stops located around town. Most of the bus stops are not indicated with a sign and can only be discovered either through direct questioning of residents or by small, bus time tables posted on the walls of close by businesses. To sum it up, this is a very small, farming community located in the true, South Korea, where many traditional ways of life still exist. For example, I can see adjumas drying their chile peppers for the Winter's kim chi on their house roofs, the elderly sitting under a bridge on the ground eating their lunches to escape the Summer's heat, farmers cultivating their land, dogs raised for meat in small cages and watch inhabitants make their purchases at the weekly traditional open air market located in Chilwon.

Electronic Music Laboratories, commonly abbreviated to EML, was an audio synthesizer company. Founded in 1968 in Vernon, Connecticut by four former engineers, the company manufactured and designed a variety of synthesizers sharing the same basic design but configured in different ways. The company originated by accident, after Dale Blake, Norman Millard, Dennis Daugherty, and Jeff Murray, employees of Gerber Scientific, founded the company in order to ensure that they all continued to have a job following an impending layoff. Following the schematics of a fellow audio engineer, Fred Locke, the four made synthesizers that directly competed with those of Moog Music and ARP. Although their synthesizers were not as sophisticated or capable as those designed by Bob Moog or Alan R. Pearlman, they were marketed as being much more reliable, which was true due to their use of op-amps instead of transistors. The company's original EML-200 was designed in part for Connecticut's \\"Pilot Electronic Project\\" or \\"Project PEP\\" as an educational tool for secondary school students. The program was created by then State Music Consultant Lloyd Schmidt. Although the company stopped manufacturing synthesizers in 1976, following the departure of two of their employees, the company continued to operate until 1984, designing and manufacturing products for others and repairing their synthesizers.

Commonly considered to be an imitation of ARP's Sequencer, but in fact, EML offered their sequencer before ARP's. * The ElectroComp 500 - Followed a trend among musicians and manufacturers towards more portable, \\"performance\\" synthesizers. Was essentially a slimmed-down 101 with only 2 VCO's and sliders instead of patch points. Competed directly with the Minimoog and the ARP Odyssey, although it was more similar in design to the Odyssey than the Minimoog. * The PolyBox - a small module designed to add polyphony to monophonic analog synthesizers. They came in black or orange and featured a 13-key keyboard. Only around 150 were made. * The SynKey - one of EML's last products. Unique in its storage of patches on plastic punch-cards. Released in both programmable and non-programmable versions. EML also produced a few custom-built units which used their standard modules in new (usually larger) configurations, Synthesizer modules were also available, giving musicians the ability to build their own modular synthesizers at a lower cost than a Moog, EMS, or ARP.

Career Hunloke was appointed deputy governor by absentee Governor Daniel Coxe after Sir Edmund Andros, governor of the Dominion of New England, was deposed and returned to England. Coxe had initially appointed John Tatham, but Tatham, a suspected Jacobite, was rejected by the province. Edward Hunloke held office at least until Coxe sold his interest in the province to the West Jersey Society, a group of English investors. The West Jersey Society appointed Andrew Hamilton governor, presumably superseding Hunloke.Isaac S. Mulford, M. D.; Civil and Political History of New Jersey; P. Keen and E.

After the late 1690s the government of East and West Jersey became increasingly dysfunctional. This ultimately resulted in the surrender by the Proprietors of East Jersey and those of West Jersey of the right of government to Queen Anne. Anne's government united the two colonies as the Province of New Jersey, a royal colony, establishing a new system of government.

Geography  Albany Creek is located approximately 18.8 kilometres north-west of the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, about a half-hour drive to the Brisbane central business district. It is positioned on a small hill which runs down to the South Pine River. Albany Creek is west of Bridgeman Downs and east of Eatons Hill.  History  The suburb of Albany Creek was originally established on the intersection of two aboriginal tracks. The main track formed the primary route north of Brisbane and is still known as \\"Old Northern Road\\".

Albany Creek was originally known as \\"Chinaman's Creek\\" before its name was changed in 1888. Chinaman's Creek State School opened on 25 January 1875, but was downgraded to Chinamans Creek Provisional School in 1883. In 1887, it became Albany Creek State School. Initially a rural area, Albany Creek began to develop as a suburban area in the 1960s as the Brisbane metropolitan area expanded. This led to the opening of more schools to cater for the growing population with Albany Hills State School opening on 30 January 1979, Albany Creek State High School opening on 25 January 1982, Good Shepherd Christian (Baptist) School opening in 1983, and All Saints (Catholic) Primary School opening on 24 January 1989.

On May 1, 1954, Nash- Kelvinator merged with the Hudson Motor Car Company to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). The Nash Rambler was then built by AMC in Kenosha, Wisconsin until 1955. The Nash Rambler established a new segment in the automobile market and is widely acknowledged to be the first successful modern American compact car. The 1950–1955 Nash Rambler was the first model run for this platform. Using the same tooling, AMC reintroduced an almost identical \\"new\\" 1958 Rambler American for a second model run. This was a rare feat of having two distinct and successful model runs, an almost unheard of phenomenon in automobile history. Development Nash-Kelvinator's President George W. Mason saw that the company needed to compete more effectively and insisted a new car had to be different from the existing models in the market offered by the \\"Big Three\\" U.S. automakers. Mason also realized the basic problem that had eluded others trying to market smaller-sized cars to Americans: low price was not enough to sell in large volumes, but \\"also had to be big enough to appeal to families as their primary car.\\" Therefore, the Rambler was designed to be smaller than contemporary cars, yet still able to accommodate five passengers comfortably. Nash engineers had originally penned the styling during World War II. The new model was the company's entry in the lower-price segment dominated by models from Chevrolet, Ford, and Plymouth. The Rambler was designed to be lighter and have smaller dimensions than the other popular cars. A strategy of efficiency, Nash could save on materials in its production while owners would have better fuel economy compared to the other cars of the era. The Nash Rambler rode on a wheelbase, and power came from Nash's proven L-head (flathead) straight-6 cylinder engine that produced . Following the design of the larger \\"senior\\" Nash models, the compact Rambler's styling was rounded in form and also had an envelope body Nash's characteristic styling with fender skirts that also enclosed the front wheels. This design feature did not impair the car's cornering ability significantly. 1950 Nash Rambler Custom Landau Convertible Coupe The compact Rambler line was designed with several body styles, but the inaugural year was limited to a single model: a fully equipped 2-door fixed-profile convertible. The decision to bring the new car out first in a higher market segment with more standard features was a calculated risk by Mason. Foremost in this strategy was the need to give the new Rambler a positive public image. Mason knew the car would fail if seen by the public as a \\"cheap little car\\". This was confirmed in small car comparisons in the media that described the \\"well-equipped and stylish, the little Rambler is economical and easy to drive\\" with no \\"stripped-down\\" versions, but in only high-end convertible, station wagon, or hardtop (no \\"B-pillar\\") body styles. He knew what Crosley was just finding out with its line of mini cars, and what the Henry J would teach Kaiser Motors; namely, that Americans would rather buy a nice used car than a new car that is perceived as inferior or substandard. Like other fixed-profile convertibles, but unlike traditional convertibles that used frame-free side windows, the Rambler retained the bodywork's doors and rear-side window frames. This metal structure served as the side guides or rails for the retractable waterproof canvas top. This design allowed Nash to utilize its unibody construction on its new compact. It made the body very rigid for an open-top car, without additional bracing. The strength of the windshield pillars and roof-rail structure was demonstrated by the entire car flipped upside down and the rails and supports were undamaged. The convertible top is cable-driven and electrically operated. The design is similar to other fixed-profile convertibles including the 1936 Fiat 500 \\"Topolino\\", Nissan Figaro (1991), Citroën 2CV (1948–1990), Vespa 400 (1957), and the 1957 Fiat 500 (1957) as well as its 2007 Fiat 500 successor. In developing this new car, Nash had originally planned to call it the Diplomat. This name would have rounded out the Nash family of cars; as for 1950, the 600 line was renamed the Statesman, and the Ambassador remained the flagship line. When it was learned that Dodge had already reserved the Diplomat name for a planned two-door hardtop body style, Nash delved into its own past, and resurrected the Rambler name from an 1897 prototype and its first production model, in 1902. Rambler was also one of the popular early American automobile brands. The historical context of the Nash Rambler, along with the Nash-Healey and the Metropolitan, was that U.S. citizens were exposed to and gained experience with the smaller, more efficient compact, and sporty European cars during the Second World War. Along with the styling cues of European designs, the car's input included the approach of more compact cars, which came from Nash-Kelvinator having a wide market overseas. This influence is seen directly in the Pininfarina designed models. AMC would later continue to import European design and styling flair for its products, such as the Hornet Sportabouts by Gucci, the Javelins by Pierre Cardin, and the Matador coupes by Oleg Cassini. Model years =1950= The Nash Rambler was introduced on April 13, 1950; in the middle of the model year. The new Rambler was available only as an upmarket two-door convertible — designated the \\"Landau\\". Without the weight of a roof, and with a low wind resistance body design for the time, the inline 6-cylinder engine could deliver solid performance and deliver fuel economy up to and even more with the optional automatic overdrive. Several factors were incorporated into the compact Nash Rambler's marketing mix that included making the most from the limited steel supplies during the Korean War, as well as the automaker selecting a strategy for profit maximization from the new Rambler line. The new Nash Rambler came only in a convertible body, a style that had a higher price in the marketplace and incorporating more standard features that make the open-top models suitable more for leisure-type use than ordinary transportation. With a base price of $1,808 (equivalent to approximately $ in today's funds), the Nash Rambler was priced slightly lower than the base convertible models from its intended competition. To further increase the value to buyers, the Nash Rambler was well equipped compared to the competition and included numerous items as standard equipment such as whitewall tires, full wheel covers, electric clock, and even a pushbutton AM radio that were available at extra cost on all other cars at that time. In summary, \\"it was a smartly styled small car. People also liked its low price and the money-saving economy of its peppy 6-cylinder engine.\\" The abbreviated first year of production saw sales of 9,330 Nash Rambler convertibles. Nash Rambler Custom convertible =1951= In 1951, the Nash Rambler line was enlarged to include a two-door station wagon and a two-door pillarless hardtop — designated the Country Club. Both the hardtop and convertible models included additional safety features. Two levels of trim were available: Custom and Super. A car tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1951 had a top speed of and could accelerate from in 21.0 seconds. Fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost $1,808 in the U.S., but British sales had not at the time started. A 1951 Nash Rambler convertible was used by Tunku Abdul Rahman in Melaka in 1957 when as Federation of Malaya's first prime minister he declared the country free from British rule. 1952 Nash Rambler \\"Custom Greenbrier\\" station wagon 1952 interior =1952= There were no major changes for the 1952 model year. Models included a new Deliveryman 2-door utility wagon for $1,892. The \\"Custom\\" models featured Nash's Weather Eye conditioning system and an AM radio as standard equipment. The new Greenbrier station wagons received upgraded trim with two-tone painted exteriors and they were priced at $2,119, the same as the Custom Landau Convertible model. The 1950–1952 Nash Ramblers \\"gained instant popularity with buyers who liked its looks, as well as loyalty among customers who appreciated its quality engineering and performance.\\" A total of 53,000 Nash Ramblers were made for the year. =1953= The Rambler received its first restyling in 1953, and resembled the \\"senior\\" Nash models that had received all-new \\"Airflyte\\" styling the year before. The new styling was again credited to Italian automobile designer Battista \\"Pinin\\" Farina.Gunnell, p. 166. The hood line was lowered and a new hood ornament, designed by George Petty was optional. The \\"racy\\" ornament \\"was a sexy woman leaning into the future, bust down, and pointing the way.\\" The standard engines were increased with manual transmission cars receiving a I6 producing , while a I6 powered cars with the optional \\"Hydra-Matic\\" automatic supplied by General Motors. The Custom models added Nash's \\"Weather Eye\\" heating and ventilation system, as well as a radio as standard equipment, with the convertible and hardtop versions all getting a continental tire at no extra cost. 1953 Nash Rambler Deliveryman The marketing campaign focused on the Nash Rambler as a second family car. Advertisements also featured the wife of Jimmy Stewart and her Country Club 2-door hardtop she described as \\"a woman's dream-of-a-car come true!\\" and promoting buyers to spend \\"one wonderful hour\\" test driving to discover how \\"among two-car families - four out of five prefer to drive their Rambler.\\" A survey of owners of 1953 Ramblers conducted by Popular Mechanics indicated the majority listed their car's economy as the feature they like best. After they had driven a total of , owners' complaints included a lack of rear-seat legroom, water leaks, and poor dimmer switch position, but none of the Rambler drivers rated acceleration as unsatisfactory. Fully 29 percent had no complaints and \\"only four percent of Rambler owners described the car as too small and 67 percent rated their Ramblers as excellent over-all.\\" Production for the model year was 31,788 and included 9 Deliveryman models in the station wagon body, 15,255 Country Club hardtops, 10,598 Convertible Landaus, 10,600 Custom station wagons (of which 3,536 were in the Greenbrier trim and 7,035 with 3M's DI-NOC simulated wood-grain trim), and 1,114 standard wagons. =1954= 1954 Nash Rambler Custom Country Club 2-door hardtop After offering only two-door-only models, Nash introduced a four-door sedan and a four-door station wagon in the Nash Rambler line starting with the 1954 model year. This was the automaker's response to demands of larger families for more roomy Ramblers. The four-door body styles rode on a longer, wheelbase. Following the industry practice at the time, the heater and radio were now made optional. Added to the option list was Nash's exclusive integrated automobile air conditioning system, a \\"very sophisticated setup\\" for the time incorporated heating, ventilation, and air conditioning in one system that was \\"priced lower than any other competing system; at $345, it was a remarkable advance.\\" The four-door Rambler sedan was at first only available in \\"Custom\\" trim. The \\"Country Club\\" hardtop became available in the lower-priced \\"Super\\" trim and without the \\"Custom\\" model's standard Continental tire (external spare tire carrier). The 4-door station wagons were designated Cross Country. They featured an unusual roofline that followed the slope of the sedan's roof, then dipped down behind the rear seat area before leveling and continuing rearward. The design by Bill Reddig allowed the use of the same dies to produce door framing for sedans and station wagons, while the dip in the rear portion of the roof included a roof rack as standard equipment to reduce the visual effect of the wagon's lowered roofline. There was turmoil in the U.S. automobile market as the Ford-Chevy sales war broke out and the two largest domestic automakers cut prices to gain sales volume. This battle decimated the remaining independent automakers in their search for customers. The marketing battle put a squeeze on the much smaller independent automakers, so even though the Nash Rambler economy cars proved popular in the marketplace, they were not particularly profitable for the company. On May 1, 1954, Nash and Hudson Motor Car Company announced a merger, and the successor corporation was named American Motors Corporation (AMC). Following the merger, Hudson dealers began receiving Ramblers that were badged as Hudson brand cars. The Hudson Ramblers and Nash Ramblers were identical, save for the brand name and minor badging. =1955= 1955 Nash Rambler brochure describing the interiors 1955 Hudson Rambler Super 2-door 1955 Rambler Country Club The Nash Rambler's most significant change for the 1955 model year was opening the front wheel wells resulting in a decrease in the turn-circle diameter from previous year's versions, with the two-door models having the smallest in the industry at . The \\"traditional\\" Nash fixed fender skirts were removed and the front track (the distance between the center points of the wheels on the axle as they come in contact with the road) was increased to be even greater than was the Rambler's rear tread. Designers Edmund Anderson, Pinin Farina, and Meade Moore did not like the design element that was insisted by George Mason, so soon as Mason died, \\"Anderson hastily redesigned the front fenders.\\" Tongue-in-cheek, Popular Science magazine described the altered design for 1955: the \\"little Rambler loses its pants.\\" As part of the facelift for 1955, the Rambler's grille was also redesigned with only the center emblem differentiating the cars now sold by both Nash and Hudson dealers. The Rambler was a new model for Hudson dealers and it replaced the compact Hudson Jet. The interiors of the economical Nash Rambler were designed by Helene Rother to also appeal to the feminine eye. American Motors featured \\"Created to Your Discriminating Taste\\" in the car's marketing knowing what women looked for in a car and Rother's designs featured elegant, stylish, and expensive fabrics that coordinated in colors and trim. Model and trim combinations were again reshuffled with a two-door Suburban and Club two-door sedans available in \\"Deluxe\\" or \\"Super\\" versions. Four-door sedans and wagons came as Super or Custom models, while a new Deluxe four-door sedan was introduced. The pillarless Country Club hardtop was reduced to only the \\"Custom\\" trim, while the convertible model was no longer available. Fleet sales only versions included a Deliveryman wagon that was not shown in the regular catalog, as well as another new model, a three-passenger business coupe: a two-door sedan with no rear seat. The automaker's marketing efforts included sponsorship of the Disneyland television show on the ABC network. The inaugural broadcast was on 25 October 1955; just five days after the new Ramblers debuted in both Nash and Hudson dealerships, and the Disney show quickly become one of the top watched programs in the U.S., thus helping AMC sell more cars.Gunnell, p. 124. Retrieved 1 September 2012. The focus continued on economy and a Rambler four-door set an all-time record for cars with automatic transmissions of in the 1955 Mobil Economy Run. The U.S. domestic market was turning to bigger and bigger cars; therefore, prospects for the compact Nash Rambler line were limited and production was discontinued after the 1955 model year. Motorsports The smallest car in the July 13, 1951, 400-lap NASCAR sanctioned Short Track Late Model Division race in Lanham, Maryland, was a Nash Rambler Country Club (two-door hardtop). Owned by Williams Nash Motors of Bethesda, Maryland, the car was driven to victory by Tony Bonadies of Bronx, New York. He stayed in the back of the 25-car field on the quarter-mile (0.40 km) track until making a steady move up to the lead position. The Nash Rambler was also the only car to run the entire race without making a pit stop. On July 18, 1952, the NASCAR Short Track race at the Lanham Speedway, was 400 laps on a paved oval for a total of . Tony Bonadies finished the race in 4th place in a 1952 Nash. Replacement The new compact-sized 1956 Nash Rambler in right-hand drive The sales war between Ford and Chevrolet that took place during 1953 and 1954 reduced the market share for the remaining automakers trying to compete against the standard- sized models offered by the domestic Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler). American Motors responded to the changing market by focusing development on the wheelbase four-door versions that it had introduced in 1954. Production of the original compact Nash Rambler ended in 1955 as AMC introduced an all-new Rambler for the 1956 model year. These used the wheelbase and became larger cars, but were \\"compact\\" compared to ones made by the Big Three. The bigger Rambler models were sold by both Nash and Hudson dealers and they carried respective Nash and Hudson brand logos. The new for 1956 Rambler was arguably \\"the most important car American Motors ever built\\" in that it not only created and defined a new market segment, emphasized the virtues of compact design, but also enabled the automaker to prosper in the post-World War II marketplace that shifted from a seller's to a buyer's market. The new Ramblers came only as four-door models. Along with the usual four-door sedan and station wagon was a new four-door hardtop sedan, as well as an industry first, a four-door hardtop station wagon. An OHV version of the engine was also introduced for 1956 to replace the L-head version that was used in previous models. The OHV I6 was the only engine available in the 1956 Ramblers as the new AMC V8s did not appear until the 1957 model year. Nash Rambler Palm Beach American Motors relationship with the Italian designer Battista 'Pinin' Farina as a styling consultant resulted in the 1956 Nash Rambler Palm Beach. All the major mechanical components for the concept car came from a wheelbase Nash Rambler. Influenced by aerodynamic and technical innovations, the Palm Beach was constructed \\"so that it could be introduced to the market in a short period of time.\\" The fully functional show car was intended as replacement for the Nash-Healey, but AMC no longer included a sports car in its lineup by 1956. Revival The revived Rambler American With AMC's focus on economical automobiles, management saw an opportunity with the economic recession of 1958 to revive the small wheelbase Nash Rambler. The automaker had retained the old tooling and the old model would fit between the bigger wheelbase family-sized Ramblers and the imported two-seat wheelbase Nash Metropolitan. This would be a smaller and more efficient alternative to the standard-sized cars that were marketed by the domestic Big Three at that time. The old Nash design was slightly modified and used for AMC's \\"new\\" 1958 Rambler American. Epilogue The book listing the 75 noteworthy American automobiles that made news from 1895 to 1970, documents \\"the 1950 Nash Rambler was a historic car on two counts: its ancestry and its small size.\\" While other compact-sized cars were introduced by the small independent automakers, such as the Henry J, Hudson Jet, and Willys Aero, only the Rambler survived long enough to establish a real place in automotive history. Moreover, the compact-sized Nash Rambler automobile evolved into a business strategy for American Motors as the company firmly associated itself with small cars in the U.S. marketplace. In the 1960s, the automaker \\"prospered on the back of the Nash Rambler, the compact that recalled the name of the vehicle Thomas B. Jeffrey built in 1902 at the Kenosha, Wisconsin factory that continued to be AMC's main production plant.\\" The Nash Rambler succeeded where others \\"tried to entice US consumers looking for practical, economical automobiles\\" during an era \\"when all Detroit had to offer were pricey, ostentatious behemoths.\\" The Big Three domestic automakers exited the entry-level car market to foreign makes starting in the early 1950s. Nash was the only American manufacturer to get the compact formula right by offering Rambler \\"well equipped and priced sensibly\\"; \\"styling that was fresh, distinctive, and attractive\\"; and for \\"the original Rambler’s run in 1950–55 was that there was a full line of Ramblers in many body styles, including a jaunty convertible.\\" According to automotive historian Bill Vance, the Nash Ramblers \\"are not much remembered, but they did provide reliable, economical and sturdy service.\\" \\"Nash's reputation for building eminently sensible vehicles means that their products are often overlooked by the modern-day enthusiast.\\" Cars professionally restored to factory condition have been auctioned to collectors.

It is located on the A4110 road, about west of the town of Ludlow, in the Welsh Marches. In earlier times it was also an administrative district called a hundred. Name The placename is attested as Wigemore (1086), Wiggemora (1165), from an Old English *wicga-mōr, the element wicga likely denoting the yielding quality of the moorland, thus \\"quaking marsh\\" or similar. Wigmore has usually been identified as the Wigingamere of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (s.a. 917, 921) in 19th century scholarship, but Wigingamere is now known to have been in Newport, Essex. The misidentification goes back to Edward Lye, who recorded a Wicinga-mere (introducing an association with Vikings) as a villa in agro Herefordiensi.Dictionarium Saxonico- et Gothico-Latinum (1772), cited by Joseph Bosworth, A dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon language (1838). Also compare Thomas Wright, The history of Ludlow and its neighbourhood; forming a popular sketch of the history of the Welsh border (1852), p. 12: \\"In 921 King Edward built Wicinga-mere (Wigmore); which was attacked the same year by the Danes, who had again entered the Marches of Wales.\\" History =Early history= An early settlement on a hill close by the location of the present village seems to have been called Merestone or Merestun (from the Old English Mersc, meaning mere or marsh and Tūn, meaning enclosure, farmstead, village, manor or estate - thus literally \\"village by the marsh\\"). The name of the marsh itself seems to have been applied to the later village. Although Roman remains have been found in the area (near Bury Farm, to the east) on the western branch of Watling Street (which crosses Wigmore Moor). Wigmore Church is an Anglo-Saxon foundation, with substantial surviving wall portions dating to the 10th century. =The Mortimer period= Ruins of Wigmore Castle At the time of the reign of Edward the Confessor, the barony of Wigmore belonged to Edric Sylvaticus, the English Earl of Shrewsbury. However, he refused to submit after the Norman conquest and was defeated in battle and taken prisoner. His possessions were subsequently granted to the Norman William FitzOsbern, the Earl of Hereford under William I from 1068 to 1072, as a reward for his services. FitzOsbern built Wigmore Castle, as it became known. Although it was probably initially only built of earth and timber, it was to become one of the main English border castles along the Welsh Marches during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. However, FitzOsbern's son Roger de Breteuil took part in the Revolt of the Earls; after the Earl's subsequent defeat William I seized the castle and gave it to another of his supporters, Ranulph de Mortimer. From this time on Wigmore became the head of the barony of the Mortimers, Earls of March. Wigmore is one of very few Herefordshire boroughs recorded in the Domesday Book. Although Hereford was the only borough in the county in 1066, boroughs were attached to the castles of Clifford (also built by FitzOsbern) and Wigmore by 1086. Wigmore, at the time situated in the Hazeltree hundred, is mentioned three times in the Domesday Book. The first entry is under the lands held by Ranulph Mortimer and records that he holds Wigmore Castle, which Earl William built on wasteland that was called Merestun, which Gunfrid held before 1066. It also records that there were two hides that paid tax, two ploughs in lordship and four slaves. The borough of Wigmore is recorded to have paid £ 7 - \\"bergu qd ibi est redd vii lib\\". Secondly, in the section recording the lands of the king, Merestone is recorded as being a part of the manor of Kingsland which Ranulph Mortimer held for the king. A third section mentions that Ranulph Mortimer holds Wigmore, which Alfward held, and that there is half a hide, which Wigmore Castle is situated upon. If a rental of 12 d per burgage (as was customary with other rental properties at the time), the money paid by the borough may represent about 140 burgages. Although it is not considered to have been a failed borough, as it was a fairly prosperous small market town during the thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, Wigmore does not seem to have flourished as much as others in the region, such as Bromyard. There are two 14th-century extents (assessments or valuations of land for taxation purposes) preserved in the Public Record Office which include the settlement. In the one of 1304 it was recorded that there were 102 tenants who held 140 and a quarter burgages. It was also recorded that there was a weekly market and a fair, which was held on the feast of St Andrew. The importance of Wigmore as a market town was at least partly due to the influence of the Mortimer family and their castle, which probably attracted much local and regional business to the town. However, Wigmore's prosperity probably waned somewhat in the mid-14th century when the Mortimer family moved its administrative centre to Ludlow Castle, which they had inherited through marriage in 1314. However, Wigmore Castle still remained the family's official seat for the next 250 years, until the demise of their house; when the male line of the Mortimers died out in 1424, the castle passed to the crown. It was maintained throughout the sixteenth century, partly as a prison, although the castle was already in decay. The town of Wigmore shared the fate of the castle and it declined to village status by the 16th century. The castle was finally dismantled in 1643 to prevent it being garrisoned during the English Civil War. =Modern history= Wigmore Church and Village Wigmore was one of the first areas in England to have an Enclosure Act. Dating from 1772, this act affected the moor and woods nearby. The dividing earth banks still survive. In 1870–1872 it was recorded in the Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales that Wigmore village was a seat of petty-sessions and that it had a post office, a police station, two Methodist chapels and a national school. Fairs were held on 6 May and 5 August. The parish included part of Limebrook and was in the Ludlow district. The size of the village was , it had a population of 499 and 104 houses. Regarding the Wigmore hundred, it was recorded that it contained 14 parishes and 5 parts. It had a size of , a population of 6,309 and contained 1,234 houses. The Gazetteer of the British Isles of 1887 showed that the village of Wigmore had not changed much in fifteen years – indeed, the number of inhabitants had declined slightly: contained a population of 417. Similarly, the Wigmore hundred's contained a population of 5,665. Schools The village has one primary school and one secondary school (Wigmore High School) which became a federated school in 2007. The school has a catchment area of North Herefordshire although some pupils attend from southern Shropshire and from across the border in Wales. Places of interest * Wigmore Abbey, an Augustinian abbey and grange about a mile (2 km) north of Wigmore was founded by Ranulph de Mortimer and his son, Hugh de Mortimer in 1179. In the abbey church many of the Mortimers were buried, among them five holders of the title Earl of March. The abbey continued to flourish until the period of the dissolution of the monasteries, when it was destroyed. * Wigmore Church, dedicated to St James, is also a landmark in the village and surrounding areas, as it stands on the pinnacle of a hill overlooking the village. It was built as a collegiate church in the 11th century by the Mortimer family and lies on the site of an earlier Saxon building. The church has a very early Norman nave and herringbone opus spicatum masonry is still visible on the outside of the north wall. Little, apart from detail, has been added to the church since the 1330s. * Another place of interest is Leintwardine the Roman Fort Bravonium which is found 2 miles from Wigmore.
