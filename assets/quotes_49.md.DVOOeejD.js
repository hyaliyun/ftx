Snoopy bus-based methods scale poorly due to the use of broadcasting. These methods can be used to target both performance and scalability of directory systems.  Full bit vector format  Diagram of full bit vector directory format, where E=Exclusive, S=Shared, M=Modified, and U=Uncached In the full bit vector format, for each possible cache line in memory, a bit is used to track whether every individual processor has that line stored in its cache. The full bit vector format is the simplest structure to implement, but the least scalable. The SGI Origin 2000 uses a combination of full bit vector and coarse bit vector depending on the number of processors. Each directory entry must have 1 bit stored per processor per cache line, along with bits for tracking the state of the directory. This leads to the total size required being (number of processors)√ónumber of cache lines, having a storage overhead ratio of (number of processors)/(cache block size√ó8). It can be observed that directory overhead scales linearly with the number of processors. While this may be fine for a small number of processors, when implemented in large systems the size requirements for the directory becomes excessive. For example, with a block size of 32 bytes and 1024 processors, the storage overhead ratio becomes 1024/(32√ó8) = 400%.  Coarse bit vector format  Diagram of coarse bit vector directory format The coarse bit vector format has a similar structure to the full bit vector format, though rather than tracking one bit per processor for every cache line, the directory groups several processors into nodes, storing whether a cache line is stored in a node rather than a line. This improves size requirements at the expense of bus traffic saving (processors per node)√ó(total lines) bits of space. Thus the ratio overhead is the same, just replacing number of processors with number of processor groups. When a bus request is made for a cache line that one processor in the group has, the directory broadcasts the signal into every processor in the node rather than just the caches that contain it, leading to unnecessary traffic to nodes that do not have the data cached. In this case the directory entry uses 1 bit for a group of processors for each cache line. For the same example as Full Bit Vector format if we consider 1 bit for 8 processors as a group, then the storage overhead will be 128/(32√ó8)=50%. This is a significant improvement over the Full Bit Vector format. Sparse directory format A cache only stores a small subset of blocks in main memory at a particular time. Hence most of the entries in the directory will belong to uncached blocks. In the sparse directory format the wastage is reduced by storing only the cached blocks in the directory. Consider a processor with a cache size of 64KB with a block size of 32 bytes and the main memory size to be 4MB. The maximum number of entries that the directory can have in the sparse directory format is 2048. If the directory has an entry for all the blocks in the memory the number of entries in the directory will be 131072. Thus it is evident that the storage improvement provided by sparse directory format is very significant. Number- balanced binary tree format In this format the directory is decentralised and distributed among the caches that share a memory block. Different caches that share a memory block are arranged in the form of a binary tree. The cache that accesses a memory block first is the root node. Each memory block has the root node information (HEAD) and Sharing counter field (SC). The SC field has the number of caches that share the block. Each cache entry has pointers to the next sharing caches known as L-CHD and R-CHD. A condition for this directory is that the binary tree should be number balanced, i.e the number of nodes in the left sub tree must be equal to or one greater than the number of nodes in the right subtree. All the subtrees should also be number balanced. Chained directory format In this format the memory holds the directory pointer to the latest cache that accessed the block and each cache has the pointer to the previous cache that accessed the block. So when a processor sends a write request to a block in memory, the processor sends invalidations down the chain of pointers. In this directory when a cache block is replaced we need to traverse the list in order to change the directory which increases latency. In order to prevent this doubly linked lists are widely used now in which each cached copy has pointers to previous and the next cache that accesses the block.  Limited pointer format  The limited pointer format uses a set number of pointers to track the processors that are caching the data. When a new processor caches a block, a free pointer is chosen from a pool to point to that processor. There are a few options for handling cases when the number of sharers exceeds the number of free pointers. One method is to invalidate one of the sharers, using its pointer for the new requestor, though this can be costly in cases where a block has a large number of readers, such as a lock. Another method is to have a separate pool of free pointers available to all the blocks. This method is usually effective as the number of blocks shared by a large number of processors is not normally very large.

The algorithm can be interpreted as a beamforming-based approach that searches for the candidate position that maximizes the output of a steered delay-and-sum beamformer.  Algorithm  = Steered-Response Power = Consider a system of M microphones, where each microphone is denoted by a subindex m \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,M\\\\\\\\}. The discrete-time output signal from a microphone is s_m (n). The (unweighted) steered-response power (SRP) at a spatial point \\\\mathbf{x} = [x, y, z]^{T} can be expressed as P_0(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\triangleq \\\\sum_{n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{Z}} \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\sum_{m=1}^{M} s_m(n-\\\\tau_m(\\\\mathbf{x})) \\\\right\\\\vert^{2}, where \\\\mathbb{Z} denotes the set of integer numbers and \\\\tau_m(\\\\mathbf{x}) would be the time-lag due to the propagation from a source located at \\\\mathbf{x} to the m-th microphone. The (weighted) SRP can be rewritten as P(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\sum_{m_1 = 1}^{M}\\\\sum_{m_2 = 1}^{M} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} \\\\Phi_{m_1,m_2}(e^{j\\\\omega})S_{m_1}(e^{j\\\\omega}) S_{m_2}^{*}(e^{j\\\\omega})e^{j\\\\omega \\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x})}d\\\\omega, where ()^{*} denotes complex conjugation, S_{m}(e^{j\\\\omega}) represents the discrete-time Fourier transform of s_m(n) and \\\\Phi_{m_1,m_2}(e^{j\\\\omega}) is a weighting function in the frequency domain (later discussed). The term \\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) is the discrete time-difference of arrival (TDOA) of a signal emitted at position \\\\mathbf{x} to microphones m_1 and m_2, given by \\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\triangleq \\\\left\\\\lfloor f_s \\\\frac{\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_{m_1}\\\\ - \\\\ \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{x}_{m_2}\\\\}{c} \\\\right\\\\rceil, where f_s is the sampling frequency of the system, c is the sound propagation speed, \\\\mathbf{x}_m is the position of the m-th microphone, \\\\\\\\cdot \\\\ is the 2-norm and \\\\lfloor \\\\cdot \\\\rceil denotes the rounding operator. = Generalized Cross-Correlation = The above SRP objective function can be expressed as a sum of Generalized Cross-Correlations (GCCs) for the different microphone pairs at the time-lag corresponding to their TDOA P(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{m_1 = 1}^{M}\\\\sum_{m_2 = 1}^{M} R_{m_1,m_2} (\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x})), where the GCC for a microphone pair (m_1,m_2) is defined as R_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\tau) \\\\triangleq \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^{\\\\pi} \\\\Phi_{m_1,m_2}(e^{j\\\\omega})S_{m_1}(e^{j\\\\omega}) S_{m_2}^{*}(e^{j\\\\omega})e^{j\\\\omega \\\\tau}d\\\\omega. The phase transform (PHAT) is an effective GCC weighting for time delay estimation in reverberant environments, that forces the GCC to consider only the phase information of the involved signals: \\\\Phi_{m_1,m_2}(e^{j\\\\omega}) \\\\triangleq \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert S_{m_1}(e^{j\\\\omega}) S_{m_2}^{*}(e^{j\\\\omega})\\\\vert }. = Estimation of source location = The SRP-PHAT algorithm consists in a grid-search procedure that evaluates the objective function P(\\\\mathbf{x}) on a grid of candidate source locations \\\\mathcal{G} to estimate the spatial location of the sound source, \\\\textbf{x}_s , as the point of the grid that provides the maximum SRP: \\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{x}}_s = \\\\arg \\\\max_{\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{G}} P(\\\\mathbf{x}).  Modified SRP-PHAT  Modifications of the classical SRP- PHAT algorithm have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of the grid-search step of the algorithm and to increase the robustness of the method. In the classical SRP-PHAT, for each microphone pair and for each point of the grid, a unique integer TDOA value is selected to be the acoustic delay corresponding to that grid point. This procedure does not guarantee that all TDOAs are associated to points on the grid, nor that the spatial grid is consistent, since some of the points may not correspond to an intersection of hyperboloids. This issue becomes more problematic with coarse grids since, when the number of points is reduced, part of the TDOA information gets lost because most delays are not anymore associated to any point in the grid. The modified SRP-PHAT collects and uses the TDOA information related to the volume surrounding each spatial point of the search grid by considering a modified objective function: P'(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\sum_{m_1 = 1}^{M}\\\\sum_{m_2 = 1}^{M} \\\\sum_{\\\\tau = L^{l}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x})}^{L^{u}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x})} R_{m_1,m_2} (\\\\tau), where L^{l}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) and L^{u}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) are the lower and upper accumulation limits of GCC delays, which depend on the spatial location \\\\mathbf{x}. = Accumulation limits = The accumulation limits can be calculated beforehand in an exact way by exploring the boundaries separating the regions corresponding to the points of the grid. Alternatively, they can be selected by considering the spatial gradient of the TDOA abla_{\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = [ abla_{x\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}}(\\\\mathbf{x}), abla_{y\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x}), abla_{z\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x})]^{T} , where each component \\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ x, y, z \\\\right\\\\\\\\} of the gradient is: abla_{\\\\gamma\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{c}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma - \\\\gamma_{m_1}}{\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{m_1}\\\\ } - \\\\frac{\\\\gamma - \\\\gamma_{m_2}}{\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_{m_2}\\\\ } \\\\right). For a rectangular grid where neighboring points are separated a distance r, the lower and upper accumulation limits are given by: L^{l}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) - \\\\ abla_{\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\\\\cdot d L^{u}_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}(\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\ abla_{\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\\\\cdot d, where d = (r/2)\\\\min \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert \\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\cos(\\\\phi)\\\\vert}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert \\\\sin(\\\\theta)\\\\sin(\\\\phi)\\\\vert}, \\\\frac{1}{\\\\vert \\\\cos(\\\\theta)\\\\vert} \\\\right) and the gradient direction angles are given by \\\\theta = \\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{ abla_{z\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x})}{\\\\ abla_{\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}}(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\} \\\\right), \\\\phi = \\\\arctan_{2} \\\\left( abla_{y\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x}), abla_{x\\\\tau_{m_1,m_2}} (\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\right).

Biography Very little is known of Gillebert's early life but it is known that he travelled throughout the Continent and was acquainted with Anselm at Rouen where the future Archbishop of Canterbury was a monk so it is very possible that Gillebert was himself a Benedictine. Gillebert was made bishop of Limerick sometime around the year 1106 but unlike bishops from other Norse settlements like Dublin and Waterford he was not consecrated in Canterbury because Anselm was in exile at that period. After consecration Gillebert and Anselm corresponded and exchanged gifts, a copy of the correspondence can be found in Rev Begley's history of the Diocese of Limerick. Gillebert congratulated Anselm for his success in the Investiture Controversy. Gillebert played an important part in reforming the Irish Church of the day and bring it in line with Roman practice. In his first years as bishop he was especially zealous in trying to bring about uniformity of liturgy especially in the canonical hours. It was these reforms that brought him to the attention of Rome and he was appointed Papal Legate. When Muirchertach Ua Briain under the influence of Anselm called the Synod of R√°th Breasail Gilbert presided as legate. This synod began to bring Ireland more into line with the diocesan system that existed in the rest of Christendom. On account of his old age Gillebert resigned as Papal Legate in 1139, and he died in 1145.

Three sectors, A, B and C, were created in 1990 but only sectors B and C remain. The forests have not been managed in a sustainable manner. General The Rio Madeira A, B and C sustainable yield forests were created in 1990, among eight state forests created that year on the left bank of the Madeira River. The others were the Rio Vermelho A, B, C and D sustainable yield forests and the Rio Abun√£ Sustainable Yield Forest They covered an area of . In 1992 the state of Rond√¥nia agreed to implement the Agricultural and Forestry Plan of Rond√¥nia (Planafloro) under a loan agreement with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). However, during the 1990s the Rond√¥nia government took no effective measures to implement the forests. The Rond√¥nia executive has tended to see development and conservation as incompatible, and has placed development first, opening roads and waterways and allowing occupation and unsustainable use of land. On 31 August 2000 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA ‚Äì National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) transferred 19 federal public lands in state conservation units to the state government, including the Rio Madeira A, B and C sustainable yield forests. Law 233/00 of 2000 redefined zoning and eliminated about 70% of the protected areas. Three forests were reduced and three ignored, leaving . The remaining forests were not protected and were subject to invasions. Since then, various people were given ownership documents in Rio Madeira B by INCRA or the Porto Velho department of agriculture. The Banco da Amaz√¥nia released funds for agricultural activities within the forests. Sector A Conservation units in the Purus-Madeira interfluvial. 20/21. Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest B/C The Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest (A) was created in the municipality of Porto Velho by Rond√¥nia state decree 4.574 of 23 March 1990, with an area of about . The land could be declared of public utility and expropriated if the management guidelines were not met. The Rond√¥nia Institute of Land and Colonisation could enter into agreements with public and private enterprises to implement the technical and scientific purposes of the forest. This conservation unit appears to have disappeared after 2000. Sector B The Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest (B) is in the municipality of Porto Velho, Rond√¥nia. The forest originally covered , but this was reduced due to the presence of private land titles in the area. The Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest (B) was recreated by decree 7600 of 8 October 1996 with an area of about under the State Secretariat of State for Environmental Development for the application. The goal was self- sustaining production of renewable natural resources and natural regeneration of the remaining vegetation to ensure the productive capacity of the forest with minimal alternation of ecosystems. On 1 December 2010 the federal government transferred the Rio Madeira B property to the state. A 2012 analysis of deforestation in the sector B unit using satellite images showed that the goal of sustainability was not being achieved. On 19 February 2014 legislative decree 508 revoked the decree 7.600 that had created the forest. The decree revoking creation was itself suspended as unconstitutional on 14 April 2014, and this decision was upheld on 2 May 2016. Sector C The Rio Madeira Sustainable Yield Forest (C) was created by state decree 4.697 of 6 June 1990 with an area of about . It was subject to the Rond√¥nia State Forestry Institute (Instituto Estadual de Florestas de Rond√¥nia), a state agency linked to the Secretariat of State for the Environment.

He was also famously turned down for the Marks & Spencer training scheme. Street thus started his career at the John Lewis Partnership in 1985 as a trainee at Brent Cross. After roles in department stores, head office and manufacturing units, Street became managing director of John Lewis Milton Keynes in 1993, moving to the same role at Bluewater five years later. In 2000 he became supply chain director and then, two years later, director of personnel. He became managing director in 2007 and, during his tenure at the top, oversaw a 50% increase in gross sales to over ¬£4.4 billion, a doubling in the number of stores and the growth of the company's online sales department, in spite of the Great Recession.  Political career  =Mayoral election= On 29 September 2016, Street was officially selected by Conservatives to stand in the first election for Mayor of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which took place on 4 May 2017. Street said: \\"[The Combined Authority] will determine how we create wealth here and what type of society the West Midlands will become. I promise to work tirelessly to convince voters that I am the man to lead us through these decisions... Our economy is being renewed but we have much more to do to ensure everybody feels the benefit. Our mission is therefore to build the economic powerhouse of Britain in an inclusive way. That will need leadership from somebody who has a proven record, can bring people together and can represent us with passion. This election needs to go beyond traditional political loyalties and I look forward to seeking voters' support for the job ahead.\\" The following day, it was confirmed that Street would leave John Lewis at the end of October 2016. He was succeeded by Paula Nickolds, who assumed the role in January 2017. In a speech at the 2016 Conservative Party conference, Street declared his support for Birmingham's bid to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games. He also announced that he would seek to address the \\"imbalance\\" in transportation spending that sees London receive seven times as much spending on transport infrastructure per head as the West Midlands does. Street said that fighting inequality would also be a priority, as \\"social challenges can only be met when everybody shares the fruits of economic progress\\", saying that he would draw on the lessons of Joseph Chamberlain and his own experiences with the John Lewis Partnership, which shares profits with all of its employees. He also called for a series of debates with Labour candidate Si√¥n Simon and Liberal Democrat candidate Beverley Nielsen. Street was endorsed by The Lord Jones of Birmingham, a businessman and crossbench peer who formerly served as Minister of State for Trade and Investment under Gordon Brown.Midlands Today, BBC1, 16 September 2016 Street was elected Mayor of the West Midlands on 4 May 2017 with 238,628 votes (216,280 first preferences, and 22,348 transfers) in the second round of voting, and in October of the same year was placed 82nd on commentator Iain Dale's list of 'The Top 100 Most Influential People on the Right'. =Political views= Street has been an outspoken critic of continually-rising business rates, arguing that \\"property is the way retailers have made money historically and we need a system that is a reflection of the future\\", though he does not believe that online transaction taxes are the answer.  Other posts  In addition to his business career, Street has worked extensively in local economic development, being named Chairman of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership in April 2011. The announcement of his appointment came weeks after the news that John Lewis would open a flagship store in the newly developed Grand Central shopping centre above New Street station. Street stepped down from this role in September 2016 after announcing his intention to run for Mayor of the West Midlands. He has been lead non- executive director for the Department for Communities and Local Government as well as a member of Prime Minister David Cameron's Business Advisory Group. Street was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 Birthday Honours for services to economic growth. He was named the 'Most Admired Leader' of the year by business magazine Management Today in 2014. He received the 'President's award' from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce in for his services to the region. He holds honorary degrees with Birmingham City University, the University of Birmingham and Aston University.  Personal life  For more than 20 years from his school days, Street was involved with the charity Birmingham Young Volunteers (BYV) Adventure Camps, taking underprivileged children nominated by Birmingham Social Services to Wales for adventure camps. Street is a supporter of Aston Villa F.C. and runs half-marathons. He is Vice-Chairman of Performances Birmingham Limited, which is responsible for running the city's Symphony and Town Halls. Street is openly gay. He is a close friend of the Conservative MP Michael Fabricant.

The situation was also aggravated by the priestly community which had refused to absolve any encomiendos (settlers) of their sins via confession until they returned property stolen from the Indians; a stance the bishop supported. The situation soon escalated with the Indian population refusing to work and instead fleeing to the churches for sanctuary and the governor and his successor, Martin, violently removed them by force. Simancas then excommunicated the lieutenant governor, Francisco de Salazar, for publicly living in concubinage with Marian de las Casas. Salazar responded by physically assaulting the bishop's emissary. The situation became so heated that Simancas was forced to sail to Spain to seek the mediation of the King which resolved the situation. However, the conflict so exhausted Simancas that he resigned without license in 1569 and returned to Spain where he died in 1570. He is buried in the Capilla del Esp√≠ritu Santo. While bishop, he was the principal co-consecrator of Pedro de √Ågreda S√°nchez Mart√≠n, Bishop of Coro (1565).

Nearby localities include Jarez to the west, Kaljibrin to the southwest, and Sawran to the east. In the 2004 census, Kafra had a population of 2,859. Syrian Civil War During the Syrian Civil War Kafra proved a strategic location, due to its proximity to the city of Azaz in the west, and towns of Suran and Ihtaymilat in the east. ISIL forces took Kafra on December 2nd 2015 in a planned offensive on Azaz, which was under the control of FSA forces. However, this offensive never materialised as SDF forces captured the vital dam at Tishrin in the Aleppo Governorate, thereby jeopardising ISIL's control of the city of Manbij. Despite their forces in the area becoming increasingly stretched, ISIL made numerous assaults on the FSA frontlines in front of Kafra. Although this resulted in the frontline changing numerous times over the next several months, ISIL gains always proved temporary, and Kafra would quickly return to its position as a frontline town. In a major offensive by FSA forces, Kafra, along with numerous other towns, were captured by FSA forces on October 10th 2016. A large scale mining operation by ISIL forces prior to this offensive hampered FSA progress in the area. ISIL forces ultimately were forced to withdraw from much of the Aleppo Governorate, retreating towards Al-Bab.

It uses positrons which are implanted into a sample and annihilate with the electrons. In the majority of annihilation events, two gamma quanta are created that are, in the reference frame of the electron- positron pair, emitted in exactly opposite directions. In the laboratory frame, there is a small angular deviation from collinearity, which is caused by the momentum of the electron. Hence, measuring the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation yields information about the momentum distribution of the electrons in the solid. Investigation of the electronic structure Fermi surface and electron momentum density of Copper in the reduced zone schema measured with 2D ACAR. All the macroscopic electronic and magnetic properties of a solid result from its microscopic electronic structure. In the simple free electron model, the electrons do not interact with each other nor with the atomic cores. The relation between energy E and momentum p is given by :E=\\\\frac{p^2}{2 m} with the electron mass m. Hence, there is an unambiguous connection between electron energy and momentum. Because of the Pauli exclusion principle the electrons fill all the states up to a maximum energy, the so-called Fermi energy. By the momentum-energy relation, this corresponds to the Fermi momentum p_F. The border between occupied and unoccupied momentum states, the Fermi surface, is arguably the most significant feature of the electronic structure and has a strong influence on the solid's properties. In the free electron model, the Fermi surface is a sphere. With ACAR it is possible to measure the momentum distribution of the electrons. A measurement on a free electron gas for example would give a positive intensity for momenta p and zero intensity for p>p_F. The Fermi surface itself can easily be identified from such a measurement by the discontinuity at p_F. Example of a 1D electron momentum density measured by an ACAR measurement. Bands crossing the Fermi level give discontinuities (green) which are superimposed on a continuous distribution from completely filled bands (orange). In reality, there is interaction between the electrons with each other and the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the Fermi surface can be extracted. Since positrons that are created by beta decay possess a longitudinal spin polarization it is possible to investigate the spin-resolved electronic structure of magnetic materials. In this way, contributions from the majority and minority spin channel can be separated and the Fermi surface in the respective spin channels can be measured. ACAR has several advantages and disadvantages compared to other, more well known techniques for the investigation of the electronic structure like ARPES and quantum oscillation: ACAR requires neither low temperatures, high magnetic fields or UHV conditions. Furthermore, it is possible to probe the electronic structure at the surface and in the bulk (\\\\approx deep). However, ACAR is reliant on defect free samples as vacancy concentrations of up to per atom can efficiently trap positrons and distort the measurement.This sensitivity is used in positron lifetime spectroscopy to investigate even very low defect concentrations. Theory In an ACAR measurement the angular deviation of many pairs of annihilation radiation is measured. Therefore, the underlying physical observable is often called ‚Äòtwo photon momentum density‚Äô (TPMD) or \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}). Quantum mechanically, \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) can be expressed as the squared absolute value of the Fourier transform of the multi-particle wave function \\\\Psi^{ep}(\\\\mathbf{r}) of all the electron and the positron in the solid: : \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p})=\\\\left \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\\\\pi\\\\mathbf{rp}} \\\\Psi^{ep}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\right^2 As it is not possible to imagine or compute the multi-particle wave function \\\\Psi^{ep}(\\\\mathbf{r}), it is often written as the sum of the single particle wave functions of the electron \\\\Psi_{\\\\mathbf{k},j}^e(\\\\mathbf{r}) in the \\\\mathbf{k}th state in the jth band and the positron wave function \\\\Psi^p(\\\\mathbf{r}): : \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p})=\\\\sum_j\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}=\\\\mathrm{occ.}} \\\\left \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\\\\pi\\\\mathbf{rp}} \\\\Psi^{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k},j}(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\Psi^{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) \\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{r})} \\\\right^2 The enhancement factor \\\\gamma(\\\\mathbf{r}) accounts for the electron-positron correlation.For simplicity the electron- electron correlation is ignored in this example. There exist sophisticated enhancement models to describe the electron-positron correlations, but in the following it will be assumed that \\\\gamma=1. This approximation is called the independent particle model (IPM). A very illustrative form of the TPMD can be obtained by the use of the Fourier coefficients for the wave function product \\\\Psi^{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k},j}(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\Psi^{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}): :C_{\\\\mathbf{G},j}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\int \\\\int d\\\\mathbf{r} e^{-i2\\\\pi\\\\mathbf{r(k+G)}} \\\\Psi^{e}_{\\\\mathbf{k},j}(\\\\mathbf{r})\\\\Psi^{p}(\\\\mathbf{r}) These Fourier coefficients are distributed over all reciprocal vectors \\\\mathbf{G}. If one assumes that the overlap of the electron and the positron wave function is constant for the same band j, summing \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) over all reciprocal lattice vectors gives a very instructive result: : \\\\Rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{k})=\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{G}} \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{G+k})=\\\\sum_j\\\\sum_{\\\\mathbf{k}=\\\\mathrm{occ.}} \\\\leftC_{\\\\mathbf{G},j}(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\right^2=\\\\sum_j A_j \\\\Theta(\\\\mathbf{k}_F-\\\\mathbf{k}) The function \\\\Theta(\\\\mathbf{k}) is the Heaviside step function and the constant A_j=\\\\sum_\\\\mathbf{G} \\\\leftC_{\\\\mathbf{G},j}(\\\\mathbf{k})\\\\right^2 . This means, if \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) is folded back into the first Brillouin zone, the resulting density is flat except at the Fermi momentum. Therefore, the Fermi surface can be easily identified by looking for this discontinuities in \\\\Rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{k}). Experimental details When an electron and a positron annihilate, the annihilation radiation conserves the momentum of the initial electron by a Doppler shift and an angular deviation from collinearity. When a positron is implanted into a solid it will quickly lose all its kinetic energy and annihilate with an electron. By this process two gamma quanta with each are created which are in the reference frame of the electron positron pair emitted in exactly anti-parallel directions. In the laboratory frame, however, there is a Doppler shift from and an angular deviation from collinearity. Although the full momentum information about the momentum of the electron is encoded in the annihilation radiation, due to technical limitations it cannot be fully recovered. Either one measures the Doppler broadening of the annihilation radiation (DBAR) or the angular correlation of the annihilation radiation (ACAR). For DBAR a detector with a high energy resolution like a high purity germanium detector is needed. Such detectors typically do not resolve the position of absorbed photons. Hence only the longitudinal component of the electron momentum p_\\\\parallel can be measured. The resulting measurement is a 1D projection of \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}). In ACAR position sensitive detectors, gamma cameras or multi wire proportional chambers, are used. Such detectors have a position resolution of typically but an energy resolution which is just good enough to sort out scattered photons or background radiation. As p_\\\\parallel is discarded, a 2D projection of \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) is measured. In order to get a high angular resolution of and better, the detectors have to be set up at distances between from each other. Although it is possible to get even better angular resolutions by placing the detectors further apart, this comes at cost of the counting rate. Already with moderate detector distances, the measurement of one projection of \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) typically takes weeks. As ACAR measures projections of the TPMD it is necessary to reconstruct \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}) in order to recover the Fermi surface. For such a reconstruction similar techniques as for X-ray computed tomography are used. In contrast to a human body, a crystal has many symmetries which can be included into the reconstruction. This makes the procedure more complex but increases the quality of the reconstruction. Another way to evaluate ACAR spectra is by a quantitative comparison with ab initio calculations. History In the early years, ACAR was mainly used to investigate the physics of the electron-positron annihilation process. In the 1930s several annihilation mechanism were discussed. Otto Klemperer could show with his angular correlation setup that the electron-positron pairs annihilate mainly into two gamma quanta which are emitted anti-parallel. In the 1950s, it was realized that by measuring the deviation from collinearity of the annihilation radiation information about the electronic structure of a solid can be obtained. During this time mainly setups with ‚Äòlong slit geometry‚Äô were used. They consisted of a positron source and a sample in the center, one fixed detector on one side and a second movable detector on the other side of the sample. Each detector was collimated in such a way that the active area was much smaller in one than in the other dimension (thus ‚Äòlong slit‚Äô). A measurement with a long slit setup yields a 1D projection of the electron momentum density \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}). Hence, this technique is called 1D-ACAR. The development of two-dimensional gamma cameras and multi wire proportional chambers in the 1970s and early 1980s led to the setting up of the first 2D-ACAR spectrometer. This was an improvement to 1D-ACAR in two ways: i) The detection efficiency could be improved and ii) the informational content was greatly increased as the measurement gave a 2D projection of \\\\rho^{2\\\\gamma}(\\\\mathbf{p}). An important early example of the use of spin- polarized 2D-ACAR is the proof of half metallicity in the half-Heusler alloy NiMnSb.

The beatification process for the late El√≥segui opened in 1982 ‚Äì she was then titled as a Servant of God ‚Äì and she later became Venerable in 1995. Pope John Paul II beatified her in mid-1996. Life Mar√≠a Antonia Bandr√©s El√≥segui was born in Tolosa ‚Äì in the Kingdom of Spain ‚Äì as the second of fifteen children born to Ramon Bandr√©s and Teresa El√≥segui. Her paternal uncle and godfather was Antonio Bandr√©s. Her siblings and parents often referred to her as \\"Antonita\\". Bandr√©s El√≥segui attended a school that the Daughters of Spain managed in her town and she later entered the religious life in that order in Salamanca on 8 December 1915 ‚Äì the Feast of the Immaculate Conception ‚Äì during World War I. In 1913 while making the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius she met the Daughter's founder Candida Maria of Jesus who said to her: \\"You will be a Daughter of Jesus\\". She made her solemn religious profession on 31 May 1918 and then fell ill that June, marking the start of a long illness and then death ten months later. Her confessor around this time was Fr. Ilario Oscoz. Her doctor ‚Äì Filiberto Villalobos ‚Äì testified that he was moved as he cared for the nun due to her ardent spirit and her commitment to the faith. Her death impacted the agnostic doctor as well as Miguel de Unamuno and Indalecio Prieto who left either oral or written testimonies about the impact her death had on them. She died on 27 April 1919 while singing a Marian song. Beatification The beatification process commenced with the inauguration of an informative process in Salamanca that opened on 23 January 1962. This concluded the following year after her writings were checked by theologians who certified their orthodoxy, on 10 July 1970, leading to the formal introduction of her cause on 11 May 1982, which entitled her to the title Servant of God. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated these two previous processes in Rome on 27 January 1983 and received the official Positio dossier in 1989 for further evaluation. Theologians assented to the contents of the dossier on 28 June 1994 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S.did so on 10 January 1995. She became titled as Venerable on 6 April 1995 after Pope John Paul II confirmed the fact that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in Spain and received full validation on 12 May 1995 from the C.C.S. before a medical team examined the miracle in question and voiced their approval of it on 11 January 1996; theologians also assented on 29 March 1996 and the C.C.S. as well on 16 April 1996.

The highway runs through a pristine part of the Amazon rainforest. It was opened by the military government in 1973 but soon deteriorated, and by 1988 was impassible. In 2008 work began to repair the highway, which will provide an alternative to boat travel along the Madeira River or flying between Manaus and Porto Velho. Protected areas have been created along the route in an effort to prevent deforestation when BR-319 is reopened, a serious concern given the devastation caused elsewhere by highways such as BR-364. As of mid-2016 paving of the middle section of the highway had yet to be approved. Construction permits will depend on measures to prevent future damage to the forest. Location The BR-319 highway connects Manaus, Amazonas, to Porto Velho, Rond√¥nia. The highway runs southeast from Manaus to the Ceasa ferry terminal, where ferries carry vehicles across the Amazon River to the Careiro da V√°rzea terminal on the south shore. From there the highway runs southwest through the interfluvial region between the Purus and Madeira rivers to Porto Velho. The Purus and Madeira basins together account for about 25% of the Amazon basin. Almost all of the highway runs through the Purus- Madeira moist forests ecoregion. In 2006 the federal government approved a decree that created the Area under Provisional Administration Limitation (ALAP) on both sides of the road. The ALAP includes almost all the interfluvial region up to Porto Velho, and extends along the west bank of the lower section of the Purus and the Solim√µes. Within the ALAP only licensed economic activities and public works are allowed. Any other activity that may affect the environment is prohibited. The area of influence of the highway extends about beyond the ALAP. It is about , with a population of about 1.3 million as of 2016, of whom 70% live in urban areas. The interfluvial terrain has very flat topography, with altitudes ranging from . The northern region from the Amazon River to kilometre 260 is covered in recent sediments between 7,000 and 27,000 years old. Minor variations in elevation of cause shallow seasonal lakes to form. In the north and central sections the vegetation is dense lowland rainforest. To the south, near the Humait√° and Porto Velho municipalities, the forest is open lowland rainforest. The mammal fauna of the region have not been well studied. A new primate was discovered recently, as well as a procyonid of the Bassaricyon genus far outside its previously known range. The highway could affect biodiversity in the interfluvial region. Environmentalists are concerned that BR-319 connects untouched forest to the \\"arc of deforestation\\" created when roads like the controversial BR-364 opened up the forest further south to logging and unsustainable slash-and-burn farming. Original construction Construction of the BR-319 to connect Manaus (AM) to Porto Velho was started in 1968 and completed in 1973. The Andrade Gutierrez consortium undertook construction of the road for the Brazilian military government during the period of the economic miracle. The road was officially inaugurated in 1976, intended to provide secure access to the Purus-Madeira inter-fluvial region. Specifications for the road were weak and it quickly deteriorated due to harsh tropical conditions and lack of maintenance. By 1986 the road was impassible. In 1996 president Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced a program to rebuild the highway, but it did not did get off the ground. Alternatives Madeira River near Porto Velho, a cost-effective alternative for bulk cargo Alternatives to BR-319 include developing a railway along the route and improving the waterway. In 2007 the Amazonas Secretariat for the Environment and Development commissioned a pre- viability study for a railway. A railway would have relatively high construction costs, but would avoid 80% of the carbon emitted by construction of the highway, or 760 million tonnes of carbon. Carbon credits could be used to fund construction of the railway and purchase of rolling stock. Another alternative would be to improve the BR-174 highway from Manaus north to Boa Vista, Roraima, and building a railway from there to ports in Guyana. A cost- benefit analysis was undertaken by the National Department of Transport Infrastructure (DNIT), but it was flawed. It made optimistic estimates of the number of people that would use the road and the amount that the bus companies would receive in fares, using this number as a benefit, but did not consider the fares the travellers would have paid if they had gone by air or water. It also assumed that goods such as grain, wood and fuel would now be taken via the highway rather than the Madeira waterway, despite the fact that the waterway provides an extremely cost-effective transport method for bulk cargo. After accounting for distortions in the analysis, the project has estimated direct losses of about $162 million, with potential external damage mounting to $1.13 billion. The highway already provides a corridor for telecommunications. In 2006 Embratel opened a fibre-optical link from Porto Velho to Manaus running along the highway. At a cost of R$15 million a cable with 12 fibres was attached to 7,106 poles along the highway. 250 workers were involved, mostly local. The fibre link is being used to provide internet access to schools in extractive reserves along the route. In 2008 there were plans to replace oil fuelled generators by solar panels to power the computers. The company installed 40 telecommunications towers along the route. The view from a tower in 2009 was a sea of green forest cut by the yellow scar of the highway Reconstruction Pothole on the paved section In 2005 the federal government announced that the highway would be recovered through the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC). The purpose is to make it easier to ship products made in factories in the Manaus Free Trade Zone to S√£o Paulo, as an alternative to sending the containers by sea. Three sections were defined for the purpose of roadworks: a northern section from Manaus to kilometre 250 at Igap√≥-A√ß√∫, a middle section from there to kilometre 655.7 at Humait√°, and a southern section from Humait√° to Porto Velho. In 2007 the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) issued a Terms of Reference requesting completion of an Environmental Impact Study / Environmental Impact Report (EIA / RIMA) for the middle section. This section is considered to be a new road, since it had seen no traffic for several years. The south and north sections did not require an EIA, since they were already paved and in use. However, the EIA considered environmental and social impacts for the full length of the road. Some work was done by the federal government between 2008 and 2009 on the basis of a preliminary EIA prepared by the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM), which was finalised in early 2009. After two versions of the EIA / RIMA had been returned, DNIT prepared a third version in 2009. Almost 80 researchers worked on the EIA over 17 months, at a cost of about US$1.5 million. This still did not meet minimum requirements to verify the project's environmental feasibility. The work was then suspended based on impact studies by IBAMA. Carlos Minc, the Minister of Environment, stated that the work will only be allowed to recommence when the environmental requirements are met, including ensuring that future environmental problems will be prevented in the best preserved region of the Amazon rainforest. Road bridge Maintenance was done on the middle section in 2014 and 2015, including removal of quagmires, repair of wooden bridges, replacement of existing culverts, clearing of the road sides and laying the base for the road surface. In October 2015 IBAMA embargoed work on the middle section after finding evidence of irregularities and serious environmental damage, and imposed a fine of R$7,510,500. The next month the Region 1 Federal Court (TRF1) suspended IBAMA's injunction, saying it would cause \\"serious public harm.\\" On 4 April 2016 IBAMA issued a licence for repairs to the middle section, valid for one year from date of issue. DNIT planned to immediately start work on repairing the wooden bridges and bypasses. Work would resume on the road surface within 40 days, when the rainy season had abated. IBAMA reserved the right to suspend the maintenance work if there were any infringements of the rules, failures to provide accurate information or serious environmental or health risks. As of April 2016 no date had been set for repaving the highway in the middle section, which would depend on completion of an EIA / RIMA. In May 2016 the Federal Public Ministry (MPF-AM) met in Manaus with representatives from the IBAMA and DNIT to clarify what actions were being done by DNIT and how DNIT intended to comply with the IBAMA license. Marilene Ramos, national president of IBAMA, attended. She said IBAMA's main concern was security guarantees to prevent land invasions, deforestation, illegal mining and other problems. BR-319 could not be treated as a conventional paved road, with no controls. Cyclists who rode the BR-319 in July 2016 reported that the highway had major tourist potential, but was being poorly exploited. In Rond√¥nia the countryside was a mess due to colonisation, with deforested fields and cattle. In Amazonas it was better, but maintenance had turned the road into a construction site. Four of the bridges they passed were partly submerged, and the streams were being silted. Bus service along the road was taking about 24 hours. Conservation Group of indigenous people on a paved section of the road The highway is surrounded by extensive protected areas, including conservation units ‚Äì mainly sustainable use ‚Äì and indigenous territories of people such as the Mura, Munduruku, Apurin√£, Paumar√≠ and Parintint√≠n. Many of the conservation units were created recently as part of efforts by the state and federal governments to mitigate the potential negative effects of repaving the highway. A total of 21 conservation units have been established in the ALAP. The minister of the environment, Carlos Minc, supported implementation of what he called a \\"green sheath\\" (bols√£o verde) around the highway. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 provided for a consistent and integrated approach to preparing management plans for the federal conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence. These are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni√£ Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari and Mapinguari national parks, Balata-Tufari, Humait√° and Iquiri national forests, and the Lago do Capan√£-Grande, Rio Ituxi, M√©dio Purus and Lago do Cuni√£ extractive reserves. Six Amazonas state conservation units totalling were created to help meet the requirements for granting an environmental license for reconstruction work on the BR-319 highway. The state-level units in the BR-319 corridor are the Piaga√ßu-Purus, Rio Amap√°, Rio Madeira, Igap√≥- A√ßu and Matupiri sustainable development reserves, Canutama Extractive Reserve, Canutama State Forest, Tapau√° State Forest and Matupiri State Park. In December 2012 the Amazonas state government allocated more than R$6 million to the nine state-level units, covering and 143 communities, to be coordinated by the State Center for Conservation Units (CEUC). The funding was for development of management plans, creation of management councils, environmental monitoring, land survey, and production and marketing. A protected area mosaic of federal and state conservation units along the highway has been defined in an effort to better prevent deforestation through more efficient management of the overall area. However, WWF-Brazil has pointed out that it is not enough to simply create the protected areas on paper. They must be staffed, delimited, legal owners compensated and so on. The Wildlife Conservation Society of Brazil has initiated a 3-year program to monitor mammals along the highway in the section that runs between the Nascentes do Lago Jari National Park to the west and the Lago do Capan√£ Grande Extractive Reserve and Rio Amap√° Sustainable Development Reserve to the east. This should provide baseline data for measuring the impact of the highway.

Set in USSR during the post-World War II era, the opera tells the story of clones of great composers: Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, Verdi, and Mozart. They were cloned by Alex Rosenthal, a scientist who escaped from Nazi Germany to the USSR. The premiere took place at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on 23 March 2005.Kocharova, Anna Kocharova (23 March 2005). \\"Fury over Bolshoi composer clones\\". BBC News. Retrieved 10 September 2016.  Background  Vladimir Sorokin, the opera's librettist The Children of Rosenthal, which premiered in 2005, was the Bolshoi Theater's first world premiere of an opera since 1979.Loomis, George (June 2005). \\"The Children of Rosenthal\\". Opera News. Retrieved 10 September 2016. Eduard Boyakov and Peter Pospelov initiated the project and lobbied the Bolshoi Theater's administration. In 2002 a contract was signed, with Leonid Desyatnikov scheduled to compose the opera, and Vladimir Sorokin to write the libretto. At first, they planned to create libretto based on Sorokin's play Shchi, but since the play uses obscene vocabulary, they decided to create an original libretto instead. When Desyatnikov met with Sorokin, the latter proposed, \\"Let's write an opera about clones of classic composers\\". Desyatnikov and Sorokin selected two Russians and three non-Russians as composers most representative of the opera genre: Wagner, Verdi, Mozart, Mussorgsky, and Tchaikovsky. During preparation Sorokin read Russian translations of librettos of Der Ring des Nibelungen and some of Verdi's operas, and original librettos of Khovanshchina and Boris Godunov. Desyatnikov composed music based on works of 19th-century composers; in an interview he admitted that he also considered modern pop music as potential source material.  Synopsis  = Act I = Scene 1 In the beginning of the first act a silent film is shown, which explains the story of Alex Rosenthal, a talented scientist who escaped from Nazi Germany to the USSR in the 1930s. He invented the method of cloning animals and people. The first subscene of scene 1 happens in Rosenthal's laboratory. He and the Geneticists (chorus) prepare to clone Mozart. They sing the aria that glorifies the \\"resurrection\\" of geniuses: \\"I believe: genius and death do not combine!\\" (–í–µ—Ä—é: –Ω–µ—Å–æ–≤–º–µ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã –≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç—å!). The Voice from a loudspeaker explains the stages of cloning a human being by Rosenthal's method. Then Rosenthal, his Companions, and the Geneticists sing an aria proclaiming that the cloning of Mozart is successful. The second subscene occurs at night. The clones of Wagner, Verdi, Mussorgsky, and Tchaikovsky sleep in hammocks near the scientific center. Rosenthal appears with a cradle. Wagner wakes up and describes a nightmare: the beautiful swan transformed into a rain of worms. Other clones wake up, and Rosenthal notifies them that the Mozart cloning was successful. Scene 2 On the veranda of Rosenthal's dacha, Nanny and Tchaikovsky sing a duet. They are disappointed that she is too old to breast-feed Mozart, as she did for other clones. Tchaikovsky is worried: \\"How complex is this world! / How scary it is / And how strange it is!\\" (–ö–∞–∫ —Å–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω –º–∏—Ä! / –ö–∞–∫ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—à–Ω–æ –≤ –Ω–µ–º / –ò —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ!) Rosenthal brings in the newborn baby: Mozart. The other clones and Nanny remember the first time each of them appeared in the family. When they mention the toys that Stalin presented to them in the Kremlin, the Toys appear on the stage and dance. Rosenthal confesses that he lied to Stalin and told him that the clones are his own children. He was supposed to clone workers, not geniuses, so he cloned them illegally. A line of USSR's leaders' portraits appears, supported by their speeches showing the gradual reduction of the government's interest in the cloning project. The last one is Yeltsin, who says the government has no money for the project. The funeral portrait of Rosenthal then appears, with the dates 1910‚Äì1992. The Voice says that there are no means to support the clones. = Act II = Scene 3 This scene takes place on the \\"Three Stations Square\\" in Moscow in 1993. The Departing Passengers, Taxi Drivers, the Refugee, Gamblers, the Hobo, Prostitutes, and Traders each sing songs. The clones perform their show. Tanya the prostitute is deeply touched by the show. All clones except Mozart leave for the pub. Scene 4 Mozart and Tanya sing about their love. Kela the pimp interrupts them. Verdi pays Kela for Tanya, giving him his father's golden clock. Mozart and Tanya call everyone to their wedding: \\"Love overcomes everything!\\" (–í—Å—ë –ø–æ–±–µ–∂–¥–∞–µ—Ç –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å!). Kela the pimp is disappointed that he lost one of his prostitutes: \\"The wedding will not be long!\\" (–ù–µ–¥–æ–ª–≥–æ —Å–≤–∞–¥–µ–±–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–ª–∏—Ç—Å—è! / –ü–µ–Ω—è–π, –æ—Ç–æ—Ä–≤–∞, –Ω–∞ —Å–µ–±—è!) In the second subscene all of the railway station's inhabitants run back to the stage. The wedding takes place, and everyone is happy. Tanya calls the clones to move to her mother's place in Crimea, so they all would happily live there. Their train arrives. Mussorgsky proposes drinking vodka (a tradition before a long trip). The clones and Tanya soon feel ill and fall on the ground. Scene 5 Mozart is alone in Sklifosofsky's hospital. The Voice explains to him that the vodka was poisoned by Kela the pimp; everyone else died, but Mozart's immunity saved him, as the original Mozart was poisoned by mercury. Mozart's singing is supported by snippets from arias by the clones and Tanya, until those fade away; Mozart is left alone.  Style and structure  The opera's music style is postmodern: each of composer's clones has a scene in the opera which is a \\"mini opera\\" of that composer. The musical references are not limited to the specific composer's original music; for example, there are musical references to Shostakovich.–†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –æ–ø–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π —Ç–µ–∞—Ç—Ä –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç–µ –º–∞—Å—Å–æ–≤–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä—ã The libretto is the conceptual base that supports musical structure, by dividing the opera into scenes which imitate the appropriate composer's style. In the first scene, Wagner sees a nightmare that echoes the Divine Swan image. The second scene's duet between Nanny and Tchaikovsky is a parody of Eugene Onegin. The third scene's background characters and choral singing relate to Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. The fourth scene links to Verdi's works by the love duet of Mozart and Tanya and by phrases in Italian.

Work  In 1920 the art patron Henri James Simon gave the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, among of other pieces, the bust of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, the most famous exhibit of his collection. Simon had financed the excavations of Ludwig Borchardt in the Egyptian Amarna and brought the artifacts to Germany. Heinrich Sch√§fer, director of the Egyptian Museum, greatly appreciated the works of Tina Haim. He commissioned her in 1913 to make a detailed copy of the bust. She made two copies in artificial stone for Wilhelm II, German Emperor and James Simon. In the early 1920s Haim-Wentscher once again made a model bust of Nefertiti, which was used for many years for molding all subsequent replicas. (\\"Historical replica of Nefertiti.

Description A nest of Manica rubida Manica rubida can reach a length of in workers, of in queens, of in males. Workers are reddish brown, slender, usually with a darker head. Thorax and abdomen are very shiny and the abdomen is darker at the rear end. Queens are similar to workers, usually they have a slightly darker color than the worker, but often they are totally dark. Males are black and glossy. Queens and workers have a venomous sting and their stings are very painful, but not dangerous. Biology These ants feed on insects and honeydew. They are a little aggressive, but they defend only their immediate nesting area. Usually they build their nests under stones, but nests can also occur in the soil. These nests often can reach up to 3 meters depth. Around the large opening of their nests they may deposit sand and earth to form a wide flat crater. Colonies are often polygynous and can reach the size of several hundred workers. Swarming occurs from late May to the early September. Hibernation occurs from October to March.

The English translation of the relevant section is as follows: ::It is forbidden you to trade in slaves, be they men or women. It is not for him who is himself a servant to buy another of God's servants, and this hath been prohibited in His Holy Tablet. Thus, by His mercy, hath the commandment been recorded by the Pen of justice. Let no man exalt himself above another; all are but bondslaves before the Lord, and all exemplify the truth that there is none other God but Him. He, verily, is the All-Wise, Whose wisdom encompasseth all things. :::Bah√° ºu'll√°h, The Kitab-i-Aqdas, p. 45) In his letter to Queen Victoria, written to her between 1868 and 1872, Bah√° ºu'll√°h had singled out the action of the British government in using its power to stamp out the world trade in slaves for particular commendation. ::We have been informed that thou hast forbidden the trading in slaves, both men and women. This, verily, is what God hath enjoined in this wondrous Revelation. God hath, truly, destined a reward for thee, because of this. :::(Bah√° ºu'll√°h, The Proclamation of Bah√° ºu'll√°h, p. 30) In 1844, when the B√°b declared his mission, slavery was still very widespread. When the B√°b went on the Hajj pilgrimage in 1844, he was accompanied by Qudd√∫s and an Ethiopian slave. The family the B√°b was born into possessed several slaves: one was his first tutor, and the subject of a eulogy penned by his young pupil/master in later years, crediting him as having raised him and praises him. The B√°b was martyred in 1850, at which time he had not abrogated or changed the laws of Islam that permitted and regulated the practice. Slavery was not finally abolished in Iran until 1929.On February 7, 1929 the Iranian National Parliament ratified an anti-slavery bill that outlawed slave trade or any other claim of ownership over human beings. The bill also empowered the government to take immediate action for emancipation of all slaves. For comparison though slavery had been abolished in the British Empire as late as 1833,The Slavery Abolition Act passed in 1833 abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834 (with the exception of St. Helena, Ceylon and the territories administered by the East India Company, though these exclusions were later repealed). Under the Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of 4 to 6 years of \\"apprenticeship\\". it remained legal in the United States until 1863.On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued a preliminary proclamation warning that he would order the emancipation of all slaves in any state in rebellion against the Union this took effect on January 1, 1863. Nor was slavery immediately abolished among followers of the B√°b and Bah√° ºu'll√°h. The household in which Bah√° ºu'll√°h was raised also included a number of slaves. He became the owner of these on the death of his father, whereupon he gave each of them the choice of remaining in his service as free servants, or leaving. saying \\"How, then, can this thrall claim for himself ownership of any other human being? Nay,‚Ä¶.\\" All of them chose to take up their freedom in full and leave his household, except one called Isfand√≠y√°r, who remained a loyal servant, and later a well known follower, of Bah√° ºu'll√°h.

Life Emma Hohmann was born in Rastenburg, a small garrison town then in East Prussia. Her father was a railway official. Her school career included a stint at the agricultural academy in the nearby town of Prussian Holland. She then trained for employment as a cook: for several years she worked as a cook on large farming estates in East and West Prussia. At the beginning of the twentieth century she was living in the southern part of the country, in Meiningen, where she married the tailor Eduard D√∂ll (1873‚Äì1947). In 1906 the couple moved north, settling in Danzig. Here she became a member of the Social Democratic Party (\\"Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\" / SPD). The issue of support for funding the war was contentious within the party from 1914, and in 1917 the SPD split apart over the issue. In 1918 or 1919 Emma D√∂ll switched to the breakaway group, launched the previous year as the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (\\"Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\\"/ USPD). After the war ended Danzig, for reasons of geography and history, was given a barely fathomable quasi- autonomous status by the victorious powers as a so-called Free City. The arrangement was presented as a compromise between the wishes of the German speaking majority who wished for their city and the surrounding region to remain part of Germany and the Polish speaking minority who wished for it to become part of the newly recreated Polish state: the compromise satisfied neither community, which opened the way for a fractious couple of decades in local politics. In May 1920 Emma D√∂ll was elected as a USPD member of the constitutional assembly mandated to come up with a constitution for the newly redefined territory. Later, in December 1920 the constitutional assembly became the free city's 120 seat legislative assembly (Volkstag). Around this time it was the USPD that split. D√∂ll was part of the leftwing majority that now joined the newly formed Communist Party of Germany. At the Volkstag election in November 1923 the Communist Party vote share of just over 9% was well down on the 17.5% achieved by the USPD in the elections for the constitutional Assembly back in May 1920, but in 1923 the Communists nevertheless received sufficient votes to give them 11 seats in the assembly, and one of these went to Emma D√∂ll. She served the full term, till November 1927, after which she was no longer a member. Three years later, in 1930, Emma D√∂ll died aged just 56/57.

It was built from onwards . It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 August 2001.  History  The Royal Mail Hotel was granted its first license in 1874, a year before Hungerford was gazetted as a township. The town lies on the border between Queensland and New South Wales, on the east bank of the Paroo River, and was a customs post on an important early stock route running between Queensland and the markets in Victoria and South Australia. In the 1830s pastoral settlement in New South Wales pushed northwards and in the early 1840s sheep runs were established on the Darling Downs. In the 1850s and 1860s the pastoral industry continued to expand in what became the colony of Queensland in 1859. Once pastoral stations had been established in Queensland, the transport flow began to reverse as products in the form of wool and livestock were moved to southern markets. The Victorian gold rush greatly increased the demand for beef from the 1850s. One major north-south stock route connected north west Queensland with Victoria following natural watercourses. It began in the Gulf country and passed through Cloncurry and Longreach, down the Thompson to the vicinity of Windorah, south to Hungerford and Bourke, then down the Darling River to Wilcannia and overland to Hay. Thomas Hungerford, 1904 Hungerford is approximately south of Cunnamulla and the same distance north of Bourke in New South Wales. It is named after Thomas Hungerford, later a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, who camped there with his brother while in the district and early references to the place are as \\"Hungerford's Camp\\". Being on a major route and near a watercourse, it was an excellent location for a wayside inn, catering for drovers and carriers as well as pastoral workers. Such inns provided food and accommodation for people and horses and it was usually possible to obtain the services of a blacksmith, leave or collect messages and gain information on the condition of the road ahead. Hotels were also an important source of company and conviviality in isolated areas. Their services made the development of regular supply routes possible, which made a major contribution to the way in which areas were opened up for European settlement. The first license for the Royal Mail Hotel was issued to John George Cooke on 6 November 1874. He was also the postmaster following an earlier attempt to set up a service based on a property at \\"Hoodsville\\", a few miles away. The name of the hotel is particularly apt as several publicans served in this capacity over the years, besides supporting a later Cobb & Co mail and passenger service. The first post office was established at \\"Hungerford's\\" on 1 January 1876. The mail delivery contract was won by Michael McAuliffe who travelled between Bourke, Hoodsville and Hungerford's via Ford's Bridge, Yantabulla and Brindingabba, a distance of on horseback, once a week. Responsibility for the delivery and processing of mail moved from one colony to the other for many years because the exact position of Hungerford in relationship to the border was uncertain. The border between New South Wales and Queensland was not officially surveyed until 1879-1880. When the Royal Mail was built, it was thought to be in New South Wales and licence fees were paid in that colony from 1874 to 1879. The survey revealed that the land was part of Queensland and from 1880 the hotel licence has been issued in Queensland. The town survey shows the hotel with yards and outbuildings close to the \\"Wilcannia Track\\". Near the hotel was a blacksmith, stock yards and \\"gardens\\" presumably for vegetables. Isaac Foster, who had acquired the hotel from Cooke in 1876, formalised his ownership by purchase of the hotel allotment and an adjoining lot in September 1880. Other allotments in the block containing the hotel were reserved for police, post office and customs buildings because Hungerford was one of the 14 settlements along Queensland's borders used as customs posts until the colonies were federated in 1901. The customs post monitored the payment of duty on such goods as wool but also acted to prevent smuggling which was common because duty on alcohol in Queensland was high. The size of the town survey and the government reserves suggests that it was thought that the town would become larger and more important than actually occurred. New South Wales surveyed a \\"twin town\\" to Hungerford on the other side of the border, designated \\"Berriwinnia\\", although it was not developed. Customs posts on state borders were not needed after Federation and it may be that if it had not occurred Hungerford may eventually have achieved its projected size. Beginning in 1882, Cobb and Co ran weekly buggies between Hungerford and Eulo and Thargomindah and Hungerford transporting mail, goods and passengers. The route officially ran between post offices in each settlement, but nearby hotels were commonly used by coach companies to change horses and accommodate passengers and this was the case with the Royal Mail Hotel. Isaac Foster died in 1882 and the license passed briefly to two other men before being taken up by Charles Wethered who held it until 1889, when it was taken over by Thomas G. Foster, who was possibly a relative of Isaac. By this time the Royal Mail Hotel had competition in the form of the Commercial Hotel, built in 1885. The Western railway line had by then reached Cunnamulla and with the coach link, provided access to larger centres. Henry Lawson, 1902 Over December and January 1892-3 Henry Lawson and a friend walked from Bourke to Hungerford and back. In spite of writing about the bush he had little real experience and is thought to have been goaded into the trip by public comments to that effect made by Banjo Paterson. He found the country harsh and did not care for Hungerford from which he wrote a despairing letter to his aunt saying that he was finished with the bush. Even so, this trip proved the inspiration for a number of his early stories and poems so that Hungerford may be said to have contributed to the Legend of the Bush developed in the late 19th century by such writers as Lawson. Lawson described Hungerford in a short story of that name which appeared in While the Billy Boils in 1896: Rabbit-proof fence, Hungerford, 1935 > The town is right on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit- > proof fence - with rabbits on both sides of it - runs across the main > street. Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, > and five houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are > in Queensland. We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence for it > - we had asked for English ale. > The post office is in New South Wales, and the police barracks in > Bananaland. The police cannot do anything if there's a row going on across > the street in New South Wales except to send to Brisbane and have an > extradition warrant applied for; and they do not do much if there's a row in > Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border, where the pubs are. Hungerford was quite prosperous as a small centre though, and in 1895 Cobb and Co upgraded its service between Hungerford and Thargomindah to a coach route. In this year John Logan became the licensee of the Royal Mail. He also purchased the large adjoining reserve on which the blacksmiths and yards had been located in 1880. In 1897 he acquired title to both the hotel allotments and took out a mortgage of ¬£250 on all 3 lots, a total of ¬£750. The purpose of this loan is not known, but it may have been at this time that the hotel was moved to the reserve allotment or a new building constructed or recycled from the old. The current hotel contains features such as windows which are consistent with an earlier building date, but has been added to and adapted over the years using traditional techniques and materials, so that a construction date is difficult to ascertain. John Logan died in 1907 and his widow, Margaret, became the licensee. By this time, the town had passed its peak when it had a population of over 100 and a magistrate's court, police station, post and telegraph office, a school, 4 churches, several shops and 3 hotels. Following Federation, border customs posts were no longer needed. The early years of the century were also very dry and although the Wilcannia Track originally had many waterholes and springs, widespread tapping of the artesian basin caused the level of springs to fall and dry up. An attempt to sink a bore at Hungerford was abandoned at . The Cobb & Co service to Hungerford was discontinued in 1904 and by 1915 Hungerford had been bypassed and was merely a turn off on the Cunnamulla to Thargomindah coach route. The hotel was sold in 1928, though the original 2 lots (105 and 104) were not and were taken over by the Bulloo Shire Council in 1971. The Royal Mail has since had several licensees, and the hotel was sold again in 2000. The town population has in recent years been as low as 10 and the Royal Mail has been the only hotel for most of the 20th century, drawing custom from local people and seasonal pastoral workers. Following the opening of nearby Currawinya National Park, custom is being increasingly drawn from tourism.  Description  Royal Mail Hotel, 2013 The Royal Mail Hotel is a single storey building with a timber frame clad and roofed in corrugated iron. It has two major elevations with a corner entrance and a wing extending to the rear forming a U-shaped plan. The main entrance is on a truncated section at the north eastern corner and the gabled roof and awning is truncated to match. A wide awning supported on timber columns runs around both main elevations and the corner. The corner entrance opens onto the bar which has a high ceiling, is lined with pine boards and has 12 pane sash windows. A double sided brick chimney is between the bar and the original sitting room. The bar fireplace is formed with a brick arch and is in regular use. That to the room behind is lined with ripple iron. A room adjoining the sitting room was also part of the original living quarters, but is now used as a store room. The cellar survives and is reached by a handmade ladder. Shelving for kegs has been cut out of the earth. The original dining room is now living quarters for the licensees. The ceiling and most of the walls are lined with ripple iron as is the pub kitchen and a private bedroom. Modern sliding doors have been added to the kitchen and living quarters. There are 3 guest bedrooms approximately square. 2 rooms are lined with pine boards, but the other is ceiled and lined largely with ripple iron, a material that has also been used in parts of the bar and dining area. The outbuildings are clad with corrugated iron and consist of 2 bathrooms and an unused washhouse. Bathroom fittings are early and feature ripple iron lining and a claw foot bath. The former staff quarters has lost its cladding to all but one wall and is used as a storage shed.  Heritage listing  Royal Mail Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 August 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Royal Mail Hotel illustrates the pattern of development of Queensland in several ways. It was built as a wayside inn serving an early stock and trading route and provided the foundation for a service town as did many such inns. The hotel also illustrates the role of Hungerford as a border post before Federation and held a New South Wales licence until the border was officially surveyed in 1879. As a hotel catering for coach teams and passengers and a postal receiving office from time to time, the hotel illustrates the ways in which communications functioned in remote areas in the 19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Royal Mail Hotel is now uncommon in Queensland as a coaching inn still trading. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The hotel complex has the potential to reveal information about the operation of 19th century hotels in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good example of a vernacular hotel in a remote township as it preserves examples of early building techniques and has changed little in the last century The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Royal Mail Hotel is important as a vernacular building whose form, scale and materials make a substantial contribution to the built character of Hungerford and which is a landmark well regarded by the community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is important for its long connection with the community of Hungerford and the surrounding area as a venue for many social events. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The settlement of Hungerford, including the Royal Mail Hotel, is important for its connection with the life and work of Henry Lawson; Hungerford being the subject of one of his popular writings that contributed to the Australian view of the bush at the end of the 19th century.

Jeremiah Yates, was born in 1810 at Fenton, Staffordshire in the Staffordshire Potteries in England. On his marriage to Ann Smith in 1837, he moved from Stoke to Stafford Row, Miles Bank, Hanley, Staffordshire. He was a potter by trade and owned a coffee house and temperance hotel which he ran with his wife from their house in Miles Bank.  Chartism  During the late 1830s, Jeremiah Yates became an active follower of Chartism, a movement established in 1836, which aimed to gain political rights and influence for the working classes. At that time, due to the failures of the 1832 Reform Act, only 18% of the adult population of Britain were allowed to vote. There was also widespread poverty and unemployment and the 1834 Poor Law Amendment had deprived working people of outdoor relief, i.e., the right to receive assistance to alleviate poverty without the requirement that the recipient enter an institution. As a result, the poor had to live in workhouses, where families were separated. These injustices helped the Chartist movement to gain massive support, particularly in the north of England. Jeremiah Yates became a keen advocate of the Chartist cause attending meetings \\"The Operative\\" The issue for 20 January 1839 and selling a range of Chartist literature from his coffee house, including 'Commonwealthsman' which he obtained from his friend and leading Chartist Thomas Cooper (poet).letter written 12 June 1842 by Jeremiah Yates to Thomas Cooper found in Cooper's house when he was arrested in August 1842 In 1843, Jeremiah named his first born son 'Jeremiah Hampden Fitzgerald Emmet Yates' after John Hampden (1594-1643), Lord Edward Fitzgerald (1763‚Äì1798) and Richard Emmet (1778-1803) who were prominent Chartist and working class heroes at that time. In 1839, the Chartists presented the British House of Commons with a formal petition, or People‚Äôs Charter which had six main demands: a vote for all men (over 21), a secret ballot, no property qualification to become an MP, payment for MPs, electoral districts of equal size and annual elections for Parliament. Although one and a quarter million people had signed the petition, it was rejected by a vote of 235 to 46. A second petition, which also contained demands for freedom from legislation on religion and repeal of the Irish Act of Union 1800, was debated on 5 May 1842. This petition, which had just over 3.3 million signatures, was also rejected by 287 to 49 votes.  Jeremiah Yates and the 1842 Pottery Riots  The rejection of the people's charter by parliament in May 1842 together with growing unemployment, near starvation and wage cuts, led to a wave of strikes in the main industrial areas of Britain which became known as the 1842 General Strike. The Staffordshire potteries saw the worst of the strikes, particularly in Hanley and Burslem in what is now Stoke-on-Trent. The strikes started in early June 1842 by coal miners who had been given a large pay reduction and by the end of July, strikes were endemic across north Staffordshire. The strikes were championed by the Chartists, who called for a General Strike across the Potteries. On 15 August the Chartists called a meeting at Crown bank, Hanley, to vote on resolutions to the effect that all work would cease \\"until the People's Charter becomes the law of the land\\".The Staffordshire Examiner, 20 August 1842 There were between eight and ten thousand present and after a rousing speech by the prominent Chartist orator, Thomas CooperThe Life of Thomas Cooper' Hodder and Stoughton the resolution was passed and a groups of men including Jeremiah Yates left the meeting to persuade others to strike. According to a witness at Jeremiah's trial, on the morning of 15 August, Jeremiah Yates led a 'mob' of 200 (mainly coal miners) to Messrs Ridgway and Marley at Shelton, entered the workshops, stopped all the men from working and 'took them away'.North Staffordshire Mercury, 27 August 1842  Trial and conviction  Jeremiah was arrested at work 6 days later on 21 August.North Staffordshire Mercury, 27 August 1842 In October 1842, he was found guilty of riot and intimidation and given a prison sentence of one year, which he served at Millbank prison, London.The Northern Star, 17 Dec 1842 Jeremiah's sentence was relatively light. While his activities had been peaceable, others engaged in acts of vandalism, destruction and arson. By 16 August, the situation had deteriorated and troops who had been brought in to impose order were ordered to fire on a procession of strikers in Burslem Square. One was killed and many more wounded. The strikers retaliated with attacks on property particularly the houses of coal owners, clergy, magistrates and government buildings.

It is thought to be the first conference of its kind to occur on an American college campus.  History  The Class of 1931 had the first black student to enroll and graduate from Connecticut College, followed by another student in the Class of 1949 who did not graduate. During the 1950s, six black students were present at the College, but the classes of 1959 to 1967 were made up of only white students. However, in 1968, ten black students enrolled in the College. This change prompted administrative efforts to further recruit underrepresented groups into the college. In the same year, the first Afro-American Society at Connecticut College was founded, simultaneous to the admission of men into the previously all-women's college. After a year of planning, the Black Womanhood Conference was set to take place on April 18‚Äì20, 1969 with the aid of Sue Johnson, executive coordinator, and Dr. Mabel Smythe, Advisory Board and Board of Trustees member. Student leader Beverly Phillips described the purpose of the conference in the following statement: \\"Being Black, we feel that the Black contribution to America has been slighted. Being Black women, we have tried to bring distinguished Black women of many fields to this campus, to talk about what it is to be Black in this society and to discuss the Black experience as it relates to their individual professions.\\" Students of Connecticut College gather in the student center, Crozier-Williams, for the first Black Womanhood Conference.  Conference  = Keynote address = Vinie Burrows, star of the one-woman, Off-Broadway production Walk Together, Children, performed a speech that integrated excerpts from Black American literature in order to convey the experiences of black women, asserting that \\"black womanhood is singularly featured in the works of black poets and writers.\\" = Seminars = Seminars led by prominent black woman figures representing a wide range of professional interests took place in the dormitory common rooms. Guest speakers included Jewel Plummer Cobb, a professor of biology at Sarah Lawrence College, cancer researcher, and upcoming Dean of the College at Connecticut College;\\"Guest Speakers at Black Womanhood Conference.\\" Conference on Black Womanhood, Folder 1.

Black Womanhood Conference: 1969, Folder 1. Linda Lear Center for Special Collections and Archives, Connecticut College.  Legacy  The conference is believed to be the first of its kind to occur on an American college campus. This was a significant accomplishment given the conference's historical proximity to the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the majority of white women on Connecticut College's campus.Thomson, Margaret L. \\"Black Womanhood Conference at Connecticut College April 18, 19, and 20, 1969.\\" Letter to Editors and News Directors. 20 Mar. 1969.

Proceeds collected from the conference were donated to a black student scholarship fund in order to build upon mission of the College to foster admission of underrepresented groups. Connecticut College‚Äôs Black Womanhood Conference was recreated and took place on April 2nd 2017. The conference was renamed, ‚ÄúBlack Woman‚Äôs Conference Resisting Invisibility Restoring our minds, bodies, and communities. The conference took place in the Crozier Williams Student Center. The conference took place in one day from 10am-4pm with a combination of different performances and lectures conducted by Black women some who work at Connecticut college and some who do not. The conference was sponsored by a multitude of college offices and departments: Africana Studies Steering Committee, CCSRE (Center for Critical Study of Race and Ethnicity), Gender and Women‚Äôs Studies, Holleran Center, Community Partnerships, Womxn‚Äôs Center, President Bergeron, DIEI (Division of Equity and Inclusion), Dean of the College and SGA (Student Government Association). Some of the speakers of the conference were Bryana White Ph.D. the Assistant Director of Student counseling services, focusing on identity-based issues. Henryatta Ballah, the assistant professor of History, Terry-Ann Craigie and Yazmin Watkins. Some of the sessions were about Black natural hair and the importance of it within the community, mental health and self-care. Shameesha Pryor (class of 2017), was one of the people who started the efforts to recreate this conference.

It was constructed between 1934 and 1938 and is remarkable for its surviving underground air raid shelter, built in anticipation of the Second World War and now Grade II listed. Air raid shelter The shelter is beneath the raised central courtyard in front of the flats, under a grass lawn which is surrounded by a hedge. The entrance, above ground, is via a brick conical turret which has a tiled roof. Steps lead down from inside the turret to the shelter below. The shelter was designed to hold 48 people and, according to the Environment Trust, was built in 1938 and extended in 1941. It has four rooms (two for men and two for women, separated by a central corridor) and a particularly well- preserved interior with some original fittings. According to Historic England, it has some similarities to W. Braxton Sinclair's design of a sophisticated air raid shelter for flats at Queen's Gate, in South Kensington, London, which was published in The Builder in October 1938. In 2007 Richmond upon Thames London Borough Council rejected a planning application, which had been opposed by local residents and councillors, to convert the shelter into two self- contained apartments. The Council's decision was upheld in 2008 on appeal. In 2010 Historic England listed the shelter at Grade II and since then has identified it as a building at risk, in poor condition. The Environment Trust is working with other local organisations (Mortlake with East Sheen Society, Barnes and Mortlake History Society, St Leonard‚Äôs Court Residents Association and Richmond Borough Council) to conserve the building for the benefit of the community and for use as an educational resource. An interpretation board was installed in 2014.

He stayed thirty years in the Dutch East Indies and did research on plant taxonomy on the islands of Java and Madura.  Biography  = Netherlands (1874‚Äì1900) = Birth certificate (1874) From his father's side Backer was a scion of a family of school teachers, from his mother's of the lesser peasantry. On his birth certificate his surname was written Bakker instead of Backer. Following time-honoured custom Backer, when fifteen, attended the State Teachers‚Äô Seminary at Haarlem (1889‚Äì1893). His interest in botany had already expressed itself at the Seminary. After his finals he had posts at several small villages. This was the time that he came into contact with some famous Dutch contemporary botanists, e.g. Hendrik Heukels (1854‚Äì1936) and Eduard Heimans (1861‚Äì1914). = Dutch East Indies (1901‚Äì1930) = Backer (12 August 1930) ‚Äì 55 years old (Tosari, East Java)  Weltevreden  In 1901 Backer left the Netherlands and went to the Dutch East Indies. Between 1901 and 1905 he was employed as a primary school teacher at a private boarding school in Weltevreden (Batavia), (now Gambir, the centre of Jakarta in Java. Immediately he started to collect the plants around him, but to name them unreliable or incomplete treatises had been written, now also outdated and often not readily available. Thus, he decided to write one himself, with the flora of his immediate surroundings as a start, and this marked a milestone in his life and for Malesian botany. Buitenzorg (1910)  Buitenzorg  He came into contact with Melchior Treub (1851‚Äì1910), the Director of 's Lands Plantentuin in Buitenzorg (now the Bogor Botanical Gardens). Through Treub‚Äôs mediation Backer was given an appointment as Assistant at the Laboratory with as instruction to write a critical school flora for Java and to teach at the Agricultural School at Buitenzorg. From 1905 till 1924 Backer was employed at the botanical gardens. He scoured the fields and forests of Java, Madura, and the adjacent Kangean Islands, and so collected about 30,000 specimens while making daily trips of thirty to forty kilometres on foot. An 1888 lithograph of the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa  Pasuruan  From 1924 till 1931 Backer was employed at the ‚ÄòProefstation voor de Java-Suikerindustrie‚Äô (Experimental Station for the sugar industry of Java) in Pasuruan on East Java. He wrote a flora on the weeds of the cane fields of Java (753 species).  The problem of volcano Krakatao  Melchior Treub sent Backer on two expeditions to the volcano Krakatao, in 1906 and in 1908.Backer, C.A. 1909. De flora van het eiland Krakatau.

Vierteljahrschrift d. Naturf. Ges. in Z√ºrich. Jahrg. 52: 289‚Äì363. In 1929 Backer published his contentious book The problem of Krakatao, as seen by a botanist, in which he maintained that not all plant life had been destroyed by the gigantic eruption of the volcano, but that rootstocks and diaspores might have been buried to sprout again.Backer, C.A. 1929.

Indeed, this possibility cannot be ruled out completely because of the failure of the Government to undertake any research immediately after the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa.

Antosiewicz's colleague Anton Malej suffered a fatal injury at that competition after falling at the end of his routine on rings. Yugoslavia did not participate at the 1932 Summer Olympics and also missed the 1934 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships because of political tensions with Hungary. Antosiewicz entered the national trials for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin but was outperformed by younger gymnasts and did not earn a place in the national team. Nevertheless, he went to Berlin as a sport referee and was a referee at the horse vault competition. Yugoslav team at the 1928 Summer Olympics.

They differed only in engine type. Neither reached production but were developed into two similar trainers, the MS.230 and MS.315, which were made in large numbers. Design and development Morane-Saulnier's interest in the parasol wing configuration began with the Morane-Saulnier L of 1913 and its continuous refinement produced a line of fighters, trainers and sports aircraft which continued into the 1930s. The layout offered intrinsic stability and a wide field of view from the cockpit. The MS.300, a basic trainer, had a large gap between wing and fuselage and a wide track undercarriage, easing the progress of its novice pilots. There were two versions, the MS.300 and MS.301, which only differed in their engines. Most of the two part wing of the MS.300 had constant chord and was swept at 5¬∞. The tips were rounded and there was a deep cut-out in the trailing edge over the fuselage to improve the upward view from the forward cockpit. The wings were built around two pairs of duralumin spars with wooden ribs and were canvas covered. They were braced with pairs of near-parallel struts from the spars at mid-span to the fuselage and the central wing was joined to the upper fuselage with a pair of transverse inverted-V cabane struts, one to each spar and cross-braced. Narrow chord ailerons entirely occupied the trailing edges. The fuselage of the MS.300 was a rectangular section girder constructed of dural in the forward part containing the engine and cockpits, but wooden aft. Fairings produced a more rounded section, its surface metal in the front but fabric behind. The MS.300 had a Salmson 9P nine-cylinder radial engine in the nose, whereas the MS.301 had a five- cylinder, Lorraine 5Pa radial. The engine mounting was designed to accept either engine; both were similarly partially enclosed under domed cowlings with cylinder heads protruding for cooling and drove two-blade propellers. The fuel tank, placed behind the engine firewall in the lower fuselage and between the undercarriage legs, could be jettisoned in flight in case of fire. There were two separate, open cockpits in tandem, the forward one under the rear spar and cut-out and the other immediately behind, near the trailing edge. Removable dual controls were fitted and the aircraft could be flown aerobatically from either cockpit. Its empennage was conventional with a large balanced rudder which reached down to the keel, hinged on a small fin. The in- flight adjustable, wire-braced, triangular tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage frame, carrying balanced elevators. The MS.300 had fixed, conventional landing gear with its mainwheels independently mounted on V-struts hinged to the lower fuselage, with vertical Messier oleo strut shock absorbers. These were mounted on the forward wing strut at a point which was strengthened by two additional short struts to the fuselage. Little is recorded about the trials and careers of the MS.300 and 301 and the exact dates of first flights are not known. By early June 1930 the MS.300 had been entered into the rally organised by the Auvergne aero club, where it was to be piloted by Robert Morane, but it was not reported as present the mid-July event. Both variants were completed before December 1930, wearing Air Force markings. L'A√©rophile refers to the two variants as one aircraft, which had by December \\"at last\\" completed its trials. The MS.301 was on display at the 12th Paris Salon in December 1930. Though the MS.300/301 did not reach production, it was developed into the successful MS.230 (1,080 produced) and MS.315 (about 100 produced).

Life and career  Haddad was born in Canton, Ohio, on November 9, 1936, and grew up in Akron. She graduated from the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester in 1958. She subsequently worked in the classical music division of Columbia Records, and at The New York Times radio station WQXR. From 1960 until the early 1970s she worked at the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. During that time, she also lived part-time in Rome where she worked as an interpreter. She acted as courier with the kidnappers of John Paul Getty III in 1973. Haddad was fluent in German, Italian and French. She began working at the Metropolitan Opera in 1994 and was referred to in her obituary in The New York Times as \\"one of the country's leading practitioners of her art\\". She wrote surtitles or subtitles for the Washington National Opera, La Scala in Milan, and the Public Broadcasting Service's series Great Performances. She joined the editorial staff of Opera News in 1998,\\"Obituaries ‚Äì Sonya Haddad\\" (with picture) by Brian Kellow, Opera News, vol. 69, no. 3, September 2004 and was a research associate for the magazine until her death in 2004. Throughout that time she remained living in the Gershwin Building in Manhattan's Upper West Side. Brian Kellow said of her in an obituary in Opera News that \\"As a titlist, her standards were high: she took pains to avoid the cute, the coy, the anachronistic; her titles were as precise and elegant and clearly thought out as her own prose.\\" William Romano, in an article partly based around documentation supplied by Haddad, said of her work that \\"by extending the text's exposure in live performance by a fraction of a second, the titleist imperceptibly adjusts the viewer's engagement with the words'. He goes on to argue that > Titling challenges titleists and the houses that employ them not only to > translate but to make the best case for awkward and weak librettos. The > brief, repetitious texts and credulity-straining plots of the bel canto > repertory, with their attenuated melodic lines and spectacular runs, can > pose more challenges to a titleist than do the complex texts of an opera by > Strauss or Wagner.

Operas for which Haddad did the translation and surtitling in the course of her career include: Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades in 1995; Prokofiev's War and Peace; Verdi's Falstaff and I vespri siciliani; Richard Strauss's Capriccio; Rossini's La donna del lago; Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte and Don Giovanni; Pergolesi's Lo frate 'nnamorato and Conrad Susa's The Dangerous Liaisons.

It was built from 1880s to 1930s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Noccundra Hotel lies approximately west of Thargomindah on the eastern edge of the Sturt Stony Desert. A hotel was established on this site in the nineteenth century, adjacent to Noccundra Waterhole, on the Wilson River and on the stock and trading routes from South Australia and New South Wales. The expedition of Burke and Wills through far southwest Queensland in 1860 paved the way for pastoral settlement of the area, with Bulloo Downs Station being the first run to be taken up in 1864. A small township was established on the Bulloo River to service the pastoral properties in the district, and on 31 December 1874 the Thargomindah Town Reserve was proclaimed and soon other small settlements in the area were trading through it. In 1880 Bulloo Division was gazetted, with headquarters at Thargomindah. Bulloo Division had an area of 45,000 square miles, extending north to Windorah and east to Adavale and Toompine. John Dynan took up Nockatunga Station in the late 1860s and J B Hughes acquired it in 1872. The Noccundra Hotel may have been set up in order to serve this run and the earliest records for the station show amounts paid to the Noccundra hotel. The current building is said locally to have replaced an earlier one, which may have dated from the establishment of Nockatunga, although the first license was granted to James Gardiner (or Gardner) in 1886 and this may have related to a new building. A town reserve was created in 1885 and the future township site of Noccundra was surveyed by James Hood in mid-1889, at which time the only structures there were a hotel with an associated bathhouse, stable and yards on allotments 2 and 3 of section 1 and a store to the west of the hotel owned by James McColl. The two men concerned purchased the blocks from which their businesses were operating at the first land sales in January 1890. These two establishments were well placed, being near a waterhole at the intersection of the stock and trading routes to Innamincka in South Australia and Tibooburra in New South Wales. Trade would have come from teamsters, travellers and staff at Nockatunga at a time when stations had a large workforce and transport to distant towns was impracticable. The hotel is said to have been constructed of stone from Mount Poole quarry about away in New South Wales. It is in a style similar to surviving buildings in Birdsville and Boulia which relates more to South Australia than Queensland, a reminder that south west Queensland in this era had better access to, and more trade with, these colonies than it had with Brisbane far to the east. McColl's store was also of stone and was a rectangular structure with several rooms. Photographs from the 1970s when substantial sections of it remained, show that it had coursed stonework and well-detailed windows with stone sills. The township of Noccundra was first listed in the Queensland Post Office Directory in 1892, at which time William Hogan was the publican of the Noccundra Hotel, having taken over from Gardiner in 1890. In 1894, the license reverted briefly to Gardiner before it passed to Martha Hogan, who was probably William's widow. By this time the town had a constable, though the names in the Post Office Directory suggest that the township was mainly a supply depot and receiving office for several pastoral stations in the vicinity. The publican in 1899 was H L Barber who was soon succeeded as licensee by Catherine Costello who ran the hotel until 1913. McColl continued to operate the store until he died in 1902, after which T.J. Costello became store manager and postmaster. The store was sold to P.J. Leahy & Co Ltd in 1904. William Richards was the next licensee but in 1916 Henry Hughes purchased both the store and hotel, hiring Samuel Milne to run the store. In the 1920s the tiny township gained a saddler and the Noccundra Hotel was extended by the addition of a kitchen/dining room of corrugated iron sheeting on a timber frame, possibly in the 1930s. However, by 1933 the store had closed and Noccundra was no longer listed in the post office directories. It may be that increased access to motor transport and the growth of Thargomindah as a local centre contributed to the failure of Noccundra to develop as a township. The police station closed in 1959. Although the township failed, the hotel continued to be important in the area. Situated in a remote area between supply centres the hotel remained a link in outback communications, a service point for travellers and as a focus for community events. It has served as a venue for monthly medical and dental clinics by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) and for meetings of a social and racing club that raised funds for the RFDS. It is also a landmark place for tourists. In 1977 the National Trust listed the hotel and photographs taken at that time show the store building to the west of the hotel still had large sections of three walls standing with a lean to addition of corrugated iron on the eastern side. This building was used at one time as a bar for the hotel, allowing the hotel proper to be used for meals and accommodation. The front and side verandahs of the hotel were almost completely replaced in 1985 and it was sold in 1990 as part of Nockatunga Station. Some refurbishment was carried out in 1991 and again in the late 1990s. The visible remains of the store have now dwindled to a part of the eastern wall and some footings that have been preserved as part of a garden feature. This area is now lawn and dilutes to some extent the visual starkness of the building in the landscape.  Description  Noccundra is roughly equidistant from the borders of South Australia and New South Wales and is on the road from Thargomindah to the east. The hotel consists of a group of stone and corrugated iron buildings that stand out in their isolation against the flat gibber plain and are seen for a considerable distance when approaching by car. The main part of the hotel comprises two parallel and linked single storey structures built of coursed sandstone blocks. A smaller stone structure containing a bathroom and laundry is linked at right angles to the northwest corner. All have separate hipped roofs clad in corrugated iron. A corrugated iron awning supported on a timber frame and posts runs along the south and west elevations of the hotel and shades a concrete pathway. At the rear a similar awning runs from the laundry across the width of the building. The interior of the hotel has ripple iron ceilings. It has a stone double fireplace set between two of the rooms. Internal walls are rendered and painted. There are sash windows in timber frames and some doors now have metal frames. To the rear of the hotel is a detached kitchen and dining room. This is a gable-roofed building constructed of corrugated iron sheeting over a timber frame with an extension of the same materials to the north. Other small corrugated iron structures are in the grounds.  Heritage listing  Noccundra Hotel was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Noccundra Hotel in far southwest Queensland survives as an important link with the establishment of pastoral settlement in this area. As an inn operating in conjunction with a store to serve travellers and surrounding pastoral stations, it illustrates the way in which remote areas were serviced and how many service towns began. While some went on to become important regional centres others, such as Noccundra, failed to develop due to a variety of causes as circumstances changed. The hotel now remains as an indicator of this failed township but retains its role as a way station for travellers. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Noccundra Hotel is a rare surviving late 19th century outback hotel, and has the potential, through physical investigation and documentary research, to reveal important information about the design, form and function of far western Queensland hotel complexes of this period, and about the people who erected such buildings. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.

Although some changes have taken place, the Noccundra Hotel is important in illustrating the principal characteristics of a vernacular style of masonry construction that spread throughout central Australia, across South Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland in the late 19th century, efficiently controlling the extremes of temperature in the hot, arid interior of the continent, and compensating for the lack of locally-available timber. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Noccundra Hotel has aesthetic appeal, derived partly from its form and materials and partly from its setting as an isolated vernacular structure in a broad, open plain. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Noccundra Hotel is important for its long connection with the community of the surrounding area as a venue for many social events.

The star is approximately the size of the Sun at , but is only half its mass () and a fraction of its luminosity (). This stellar object was first characterized by the 2nd USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog and the Two Micron All- Sky Survey, and was further studied during the Kepler space telescope's extended K2 mission Campaign 2 between 23 August and 13 November 2014. Luminosity In August 2016, a team of astronomers, led by Simone Scaringi of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Germany, reported that this red dwarf star has a resolved circumstellar disc. Further, the research team observed unusual luminosity dimmings of up to 65% for 25 consecutive days (out of 79 total observation days). The variability in luminosity was highly periodic and attributed to stellar rotation. The researchers hypothesized that the irregular dimmings were caused by either a warped inner-disk edge or transiting cometary-like objects in either circular or eccentric orbits.

The family path to parliament  In December 1666 Machell married Helena, daughter of Gervase Warmestry, registrar of the Worcester diocese, and step-daughter of Sir John Covert,Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). who was elected an M.P. for Horsham in 1661 and again in 1669. Helena's sister Cecily was the wife of Edward Eversfield, M.P. for Bramber, Sussex in 1661. Early in 1667 Machell sat as a Justice of the Peace, and became a Commissioner for Subsidies, in which role he continued until 1680. He resumed work as a Justice in 1668. In that year his uncle John Machell of Wendover died leaving an established family.Will of John Machell, Gentleman of Buckinghamshire (P.C.C. 1668). John and Helena had four children, of whom two daughters, Isabella (b. 1670) and Caecilia Maria, survived infancy.Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). In both parliaments of 1679 Anthony Eversfield, brother of Edward, represented Horsham together with John Michell, and in 1681 John Machell, who had acquired burgages in Horsham,B.M.

Sir Arthur Ingram (died 1642), Arthur's great-grandfather, had a long parliamentary career and had received considerable royal favour under James I. In the 1685 election Machell and Anthony Eversfield were returned for Horsham, though as a Whig he took little part in the parliament of James II. They were returned together again for the Convention Parliament of 1689. John Machell held his seat in three further parliaments spanning the 1690s, through the election of 1690 (with Thomas White) and those of 1695 and 1698 (with Henry Yates).P. Watson, 'Constituencies: Horsham (Borough)', in D. Hayton, E. Cruickshanks and S.

He was probably an Exclusionist, and was identified as a Court supporter. Among his parliamentary contributions he advocated the rights of Quakers to make solemn affirmations instead of taking the Oath, attacked the severity of James II's judiciary, and spoke against other oppressive measures. Having been Commissioner for wine licences in 1690‚Äì91, he soon afterwards advocated a general tax on the imports of French red wines. He voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick in 1696.'Machell, John (1637‚Äì1704)', in History of Parliament 1660‚Äì1690 and 1690‚Äì1715.  Last years and legacy  Machell was increasingly inactive or absent from parliament during the later 1690s, sometimes on the grounds of health, and did not contest the 1701 elections. His half-brother Joseph having died, in 1689 the widow made a will entrusting her two children Thomas and Anne Machell and their legacies to John Machell's wardship, a role towards the orphans which he accepted as executor in proving their mother's will in 1693.Will of Susan Machell of Cobham, widow: London Metropolitan Archives, Ref. DW/PA/5/1693 will no. 68. John's stepmother Jane and half-brother Mathew Machell made their residence in London, and in his will written in 1702 John Machell left an annuity of ¬£10 per annum to Mathew Machell of London, Gent., his \\"brother of the half blood\\". Arthur Ingram having died in that year, Edward (1686‚Äì1714) became 4th Viscount while still at Eton, and soon afterwards was making a good impression at Christ's College, Cambridge, where John Covel had him under instruction and sent his good wishes to Lady Isabella and Mr Machell at Temple Newsam.Christ's College, Cambridge: Letters Online. Letter from John Covel to John Rhoades, 3 November 1702. John Machell died at Temple Newsam, but was buried at Horsham in 1704.Challen, 'John Machell, M.P., Horsham', Sussex Notes and Queries (1964). Hughes and Knight, Hills: Horsham's Lost Stately Home, pp. 14, 18. After other bequests (including provision for his orphaned granddaughter Helena Parsons), the bulk of his fortune was entailed upon his Ingram grandchildren, commencing with Rich and his heirs male in succession, and then in default to each of the other grandchildren and their heirs in turn, upon condition that they should henceforth use the surname Machell and not that of Ingram.Will of John Machell of Horsham, Sussex (P.C.C. 1704). The will was proved in 1704 by the Executors, but in March 1711/12 the 5th Viscount Rich Ingram was sworn into probate. An acknowledgement of this wish was made by the eldest grandson Edward Machell Ingram (who, as master of Temple Newsam, never inherited Hills), but not by Rich or his successors, more than one of whom served as MPs for Horsham.

Early and family life Martin was born to Romey Orlando Martin and his wife Hattie Inge in Pittsylvania County, Virginia on July 24, 1910.Virginia birth records on ancestry.com The family included older sisters, Costello Beatrice Martin and Willie Gladys Martin, older brothers, Maceo Conrad Martin and Romey Orlando Martin, Jr., and a twin brother Andrew Inge Martin. I have corrected the identification of Martin A Martin's siblings, based on my personal knowledge. Willie Gladys Martin, who is incorrectly identified as male on 1910 and 1920 census records, is my maternal grandmother. He attended Ohio State University then Howard University Law School, where he became acquainted with fellow students and alumni Oliver Hill and Spottswood Robinson, who would later become his law partners. He married twice. Maria Estelle Wright married him in 1942; they had no children when they divorced in 1947. He was survived by his second wife Ruth Martin (1910-1978). Career Upon graduation in 1938 and admission to the Virginia bar, Martin established a private legal practice in Danville, Virginia. His general practice included representing the Danville Savings Bank (the state's oldest black-owned financial institution), as well as black teachers in salary equalization lawsuits. Martin also came to head the local NAACP office.Eric W. Rise, The Martinsville Seven: Race, Rape and Capital Punishment (University of Virginia Press, 1995) p. 72 Martin first became involved in a nationally prominent case in September 1941, after the conviction of black sharecropper Odell Waller for killing a white landlord in Gretna, Virginia. Martin developed information that the grand jury and later the trial jury that convicted Waller included only white men who paid the poll tax. Thus, the jury excluded blacks and peers of the defendant. However, the local judge who convicted Waller allegedly instructed the court clerk to deny Martin access to further records, so that he could not show all Pittsylvania County juries were similarly selected.Richard B. Sherman, the Case of Odell Waller and Virginia Justice 1940-1942 (Knoxville, University of Tennessee Press, 1992) pp. 90-91 On May 31, 1943, Martin became the first African American attorney in the Criminal Trial Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, under Attorney General Francis Biddle.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/owi2001029109/PP However, he did not like litigating cases involving aliens, so he quit after less than a year. After Oliver Hill's military service ended, he joined as planned with Martin and Spottswood Robinson III to form the Richmond law firm of Hill, Martin and Robinson. Martin was the firm's criminal specialist. He attempted to defend the Martinsville Seven on appeal in 1949, assisted by Samuel W. Tucker, Roland D. Ealey and Jerry Williams of Danville. They secured a limited stay of the execution date from Governor William M. Tuck, and a writ of error from the Virginia Supreme Court, but when time came to argue the appeal, Attorney General J. Lindsay Almond Jr. personally argued the state's case and asked the appellate court to accept the confessions, uphold the convictions and allow the death sentences to be carried out. The Virginia Supreme Court issued its unanimous decision on March 13, 1950 the opening day of the following term, and after Martin filed a petition for review, new Governor John S. Battle issued another reprieve. However, on June 5, the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari, as it would again on January 2, 1951. Meanwhile, publicity continued. Governor Battle conducted a clemency hearing on July 7, 1950 but denied the petition on July 27, and remained firm. Additional litigation in the U.S. District Court and Court of Appeals proved futile. The defendants were all executed on February 2 and 5, 1951. Many (including the state's leading black newspapers) believed the men would not have been executed, but for the temporary involvement of the Civil Rights Congress (a rival to the NAACP, which the parents of one accused boy had involved and which had communist links), and later its organizing protests during the appeal and clemency process.Rise 1995 p. 151 In the 1950s, the firm also litigated various civil rights cases involving schools. Martin became the attorney of record in the 1958 case involving desegregating Richmond's public schools, Warden v. Richmond School Board. In the fall of 1960, two African American pupils were admitted to Chandler Elementary School, over a year after decisions by a three judge federal panel and the Virginia Supreme Court on Robert E. Lee's birthday (but in other cases litigated by the law firm) declared most of the Stanley Plan implementing Massive Resistance unconstitutional as defying the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v.

Button stopped the harassment of NAACP attorneys which was another part of Massive Resistance. The civil rights law firm reconstituted as Hill, Tucker and Marsh. The sentencing disparity arguments Martin had raised received additional impetus from Justice Arthur Goldberg's dissent from a denial of certiorari in Rudolph v. Alabama (1963), but was not addressed by the Supreme Court until McClesky v. Kemp (1987), when it was rejected in a case involving the killing of a white police officer.Rise 1995 at 157-160 Martin A.

Its beaches overlook Long Island Sound. Its sister communities are Silver Beach, south of the Cross Bronx Expressway, as well as Harding Park. History Edgewater Park once housed a mansion built by George T. Adee in 1856. He eventually leased the land to an Irish immigrant who was a member of St. Ann's Episcopal Church in Morrisania and invited church youth to camp on the grounds which became known as Edgewater Camp. Campsites eventually developed into bungalows and by around 1918 a full- fledged bungalow had developed along the coast areas while other sections remained farmland and grazing land. Ruts from early auto traffic became roads. After World War I the community was divided into sections A, B, C, after the names of Army camps; D and E Sections were added later. In 1954, Shaw died. By this time, Edgewater Camp had become a community of full-time residents and became known as \\"Park of Edgewater\\" or \\"Edgewater Park.\\" The community became a co-op in 1988.

Controversies In 2010 the Edgewater Park Owners Cooperative, Silver Beach, and a local real estate broker were sued by Fair Housing Justice Center for racial discrimination in its buying and selling practices. According to the suit, the policy requiring prospective buyers to gain the endorsement of three existing co-op owners served to block African Americans from access to the communities, a charge community residents denied.

Henry Tucker (1742-1800) was a Bermudian politician, and a member of a family that had been prominent in Bermuda since the 1616 appointment of Captain Daniel Tucker as Governor of Bermuda. Henry Tucker was the President of the Governor's Council of the British colony of Bermuda (which had combined the roles of a Cabinet and an Upper House to the House of Assembly of Bermuda) from 1775 to 1807. Prominent men at that time filled a variety of civil and military roles by appointment, and Tucker was also appointed the Colonial Secretary of Bermuda and Provost Marshal General of Bermuda after the resignation of W. O'Brien from those positions in 1785. He was acting Governor of Bermuda in 1796, pending the arrival of new Governor William Campbell. Campbell died almost immediately upon arrival and Tucker resumed the acting Governorship from 1796 to 1798, and again from 1803 to 1805, and in 1806. Henry's father was Henry Tucker of The Grove, at various times a Member of the Council, of the House of Assembly, and an officer of the Militia who would rise to the rank of Colonel. Bermuda's closest links were with the southern British colonies in North America, especially Virginia (of which it had originally been a part) and South Carolina (which, as part of the Province of Carolina had been settled from Bermuda in 1670 under William Sayle, and still had a sizeable and influential enclave of Bermudians). Bermudians had abandoned agriculture after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company, and had developed a maritime economy. Bermudians built large numbers of ships, including the Bermuda sloop, with which they explored every opportunity to exploit distant markets. This meant, however, that they became completely dependent on trade for foodstuffs and basic supplies, and their primary trading partners were the now rebellious American colonies. The ban on trade with the rebels that followed the outbreak of the war meant Bermuda was faced with economic ruin and famine. Colonel Henry Tucker was sent as a Bermudian delegate to the rebel Continental Congress in Philadelphia, where he orchestrated with Benjamin Franklin the theft of a hundred barrels of gunpowder from a magazine in St. George's, Bermuda. The gunpowder was stolen during the night of the 14 August 1775, and rowed out to waiting American vessels which delivered it to the rebel army, even as another rebel vessel was sent to Bermuda by George Washington tasked with the same mission. Washington was unaware of Tucker and Franklin's plot, and sent a letter addressed to the people of Bermuda requesting their assistance.Franklin Papers: Henry Tucker The letter from Washington had read: His father's activities were not the extent of the treasons of President Henry Tucker's family. Two of his brothers, St. George Tucker and Thomas Tudor Tucker, had emigrated to the continent before the war, and both served the rebels. St. George was a Lieutenant-Colonel in the Virginia Militia, and was wounded at both the Battle of Guilford Court House and the Siege of Yorktown. Thomas Tudor served as a surgeon in the Continental Army from 1781 to 1783. He was a South Carolina delegate to the Continental Congress in 1787 and 1788, and later represented South Carolina in the United States House of Representatives, and served as Treasurer of the United States from 1801 to his death in 1828. Bermuda remained a British colony after the war, and became the lynch pin of the Royal Navy's control of North American and West Indian waters after the loss of all her continental bases between The Maritimes and the West Indies, with increasing interest and interference taken by the British Government in its internal self-government. The loyalties of Bermudians were considered highly suspect after the war, during which they had traded with the rebels and supplied them with large numbers of fighting ships, in addition to stolen gunpowder. The activities of his father and brothers might have cast a shadow on Henry Tucker's political career, but he was advantageously married to Frances Brueure, the daughter of the wartime Governor, Lieutenant-Colonel George James Bruere. Brueure was Bermuda's longest serving Governor, having been appointed in 1764. His death in office in 1780 was thought to have resulted from the stress of governing a colony that was almost in rebellion. He was succeeded by his son, Lieutenant George Brueure (1744‚Äì1786), of the 18th Regiment of Dragoons, who had been wounded at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Tucker's brother-in-law had a short Governorship, having set himself against the elder Henry Tucker and the other members of Bermuda's economic and political elite.

Tucker was cape merchant (treasurer) in Jamestown during the Starving Time, and developed habits of extreme discipline. Bermuda was settled in 1609 by the Virginia Company through the chance wrecking there of its flagship, the Sea Venture. The Virginia company's mandate was made official by the 1612 extension of its Royal Charter to include Bermuda, officially named Virgineola, but quickly renamed The Somers Isles. Later that same year, Bermuda's first Governor, Richard Moore, arrived with a shipload of new settlers to join the three men left behind by the Sea Venture. Bermuda quickly became self-sufficient and its requirements were quite different from the still-struggling Jamestown. The shareholders consequently spun-off a second company to manage Bermuda separately. Called the Somers Isles Company, King James I granted it a Royal Charter in 1615, and Tucker was appointed to replace Moore as Governor. Tucker arrived there in 1616. According to Tucker family papers, he found the people lazy and uninspired, and imposed a stern discipline on the colony that was generally resented. Within days of his arrival he had a man hanged for speaking derisively of the new governor and his methods. Governor Moore's immediate concern had been building a ring of fortifications to protect the new settlement from attack by the Spanish. Planting of crops had been neglected, with settlers relying largely on fishing, hunting and foraging. Tucker's Virginia experience had taught him that food was essential to a successful colony. Under his rule, crops were planted, rats (accidentally introduced by a visiting privateer) reduced, fishing routines established, and living accommodations were built. Tucker's insistence on the development of a reliable food and water supply before pearl diving and whaling for ambergris irritated the company shareholders, and caused his critics to proclaim that he was \\"fitter to be a gardener than a governor.\\" The Company sent Richard Norwood to survey the island in 1616, which led to a scandal when Tucker appropriated the 200 acres of overplus (surplus) shares of land left unclaimed by the survey. All shares of land were originally assigned based on Norwood's preliminary estimate of the total land area. Norwood had deliberately underestimated in order to leave a sufficient margin-of-error. Tucker was accused of first interfering with Norwood's survey to ensure that the land ultimately determined to be overplus would be a valuable tract on the boundary of Southampton and Sandys' Parishes, rather than the small, rocky islands that would otherwise have been the last surveyed, and then further accused of improperly claiming that overplus land for himself, where he built himself a mansion in 1618 with public funds. In a preface to his third survey of 1672-1673, Richard Norwood asserted that Moore had interfered with his East-to-West survey only to ensure that the small western islands, which were free of the rats that destroyed the mainland's crops, were quickly planted.The Royal Gazette, official Facebook page.[http://www.thebermudian.com/features/543-hog-bay-park Hog Bay Park, by Elizabeth Jones.

In September 2015, Blue Apron launched Blue Apron Wine, a direct-to-consumer wine delivery service that sends customers six 500ml bottles per month. The wines, made specifically for Blue Apron, are purchased directly from vineyards and sent directly to customers. In October 2016, Buzzfeed reported a history of safety and health violations at the company's Richmond, California distribution center. The company attributed the problems to operational issues while scaling up during its early days. In February 2017, the company announced that it would be opening a fulfillment center in Linden, New Jersey. On June 29, 2017, Blue Apron had its initial public offering of 30 million shares of class A common stock (ticker APRN) priced at $10 per share; it is the first U.S. meal-kit company to go public. Since going public, Wall Street has cut Blue Apron's stock price in half.

He was born in Copenhagen Street, Islington, London, to drinking club proprietor Alfred White and Victoria Bayford. White became one of the most ruthless and vicious London gangsters between the World Wars and was the main force behind the Sabini gang of Clerkenwell, which he partnered in terrorising bookmakers on racecourses and street corners. He was also a local protection racketeer who extended his operations into West End clubland. In his youth White had been a member of the Bemerton Street Boys, who were constantly battling the Clerkenwell Boys and White Lion Street gang in local hooligan wars. In 1908 he led the Titanics in the 'First Battle of the Nile' against the Sabinis. He supported the McCausland brothers' West End gang in their struggle with the Elephant gang for supremacy in Soho and after the McCauslands were jailed, he graduated to become a leading light in the pickpocketing Titanic gang, together with his brother-in-law Charlie Wooder. Both were convicted in 1913 of picking the pocket of a traveller on the West Coast Corridor train on its way to Carlisle. In 1919, the Titanic were crushed by the Elephant and Castle Mob. White went on to form the King's Cross Boys, and combined with the Sabinis and Alf Solomon's Yiddishers to form a counterbalance to the Elephant, Camden Town and Finsbury gangs, and their Birmingham allies led by Billy Kimber. Years of racecourse warfare followed. In 1922, White was sentenced to five years' imprisonment for his part in the shooting of George Sage and Freddie Gilbert outside the Southampton Arms in Mornington Crescent, Camden. Joe Sabini and others of the White-Sabini gang were also jailed. When George Sage's wife withdrew her evidence at his appeal hearing, White was released. White was involved in numerous fights where coshes, razors and guns were used. In 1925 he was badly beaten in a Paddington gambling club by a combination of Elephant Boys led by Tommy Benneworth and Bethnal Green Boys led by Dodger Mullins. In 1935, Big Alf was jailed for twelve months for a vicious assault in which his victim lost an eye. White tired of his association with the Sabinis, transferred his operations to greyhound tracks and became part owner of Hackney Stadium. He was married to Caroline Wooder and their three children, Alf junior, Harry and Billy took over leadership of the gang until they were crushed by Jack Comer in 1947.

He did his schooling at Sree Rama Varma High School, a government-run school in the city and did his early college studies at Maharaja's College after which he joined the Presidency College, Chennai from where he graduated (BSc Hons) with first rank in 1941. It was during this period he had the opportunity to meet M. O. P. Iyengar, the renowned algologist, who was known to have fostered Subramanian's interest in phycology. Before completing his master's degree (MA) in mycology in 1944, he prepared his first dissertation on Acanthus ilicifolius, a halophyte found in the saline waters of western coastal India. Subsequently, he joined Toppur Seethapathy Sadasivan as the first research student of the plant pathologist who also headed the Centre for Advanced Studies in Botany of the University of Madras during that time. He received his doctoral degree (PhD) in 1948 for his thesis, Soil conditions and wilt diseases in plants with special reference to Fusarium vasinfectum Atk. on cotton after which he continued his research on mycology and did post-doctoral research, on an ICS fellowship of the Indian National Science Academy (then known as the National Institute of Sciences of India) at the Botany School of Cambridge University and, later at Commonwealth Mycological Institute, UK where he was associated with known mycologists, Stephen Denis Garrett and E. W. Mason. Subramanian started his academic career in 1951 when he joined the University of Madras as a senior lecturer where he rose to the position of a reader in 1953. During this period, he continued his researches and his published work, Floristic and taxonomic studies on Fungi Imperfecti, earned him the degree of DSc in 1957 from the University of Madras. A year later, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute created a new Chair in Plant Pathology and invited Subramanian to hold the position which he did till his move to the University of Rajasthan in 1960. There, he established the Department of Botany and headed the department as its founder professor till his return to Madras University in 1964 as a professor of Botany. In 1973, he succeeded his mentor, T. S. Sadasivan as the head of the Centre for Advanced Study in Botany, a position he held till his superannuation in 1985. He continued his academic career past his official retirement and worked as a visiting professor at such institutions as the National University of Singapore, the University of Western Australia and the National Taiwan University.

The society has since grown to be a national organisation with 400 members and interest in studies related to taxonomy, ecology, pathology, genetics, molecular biology and physiology. The society also publishes a journal, Kavaka and he was its founder editor, holding the position till 1998. He was also a member of the University Grants Commission from 1977 to 1982. It was reported that Subramanian personally appealed to Indira Gandhi, the then Indian prime minister, to abandon the proposed hydro-electric project in the Silent Valley, a bio-reserve area in his home state of Kerala, eventually leading to its declaration as a national park in 1985. = Scientific contributions = While serving as a senior lecturer at Madras University, Subramanian published a two-volume work in 1956 under the title, List of Indian Fungi, which listed the known species of fungi in India. Major focus of his research was on Fungi imperfecti. He was known to have conducted extensive research on Hyphomycetes and his work has been detailed in a monograph, Hyphomycetes: An Account of Indian Species, Except Cercosporae, published in 1971 and another book, Hyphomycetes, taxonomy and biology, published in 1983, where he proposed a classification based on conidium ontogenesis. He also proposed a new nomenclature protocol based on Sanskrit terminology; MycoBank, an online repository managed by the International Mycological Association has listed 384 genera of fungi named by him and Angulimaya, Dwayabeeja, Kutilakesa, Nalalanthamala, and Tharoopama are some of them. He worked on the re- assessment of Dematiaceous hyphomycetes and his work assisted in reclassifying the genus by attempting to disprove that Sporidesmium had a different ancestral species (monophyletic). Aspergillus, a genus of moulds, was another subject of his developmental taxonomical studies and his research on its teleomorphs helped in the better understanding of the fungi. His researches also explained the systematics, distribution and ecological behaviour of Fusarium and Drechslera, two plant pathogens. He documented his researches in several articles and books besides the ones noted above; Moulds, Mushrooms and Men and Soil microfungi of Israel are two such works.  Awards and honours  The University of Madras awarded Subramanian the Pulney Andi Gold Medal in 1944 for academic excellence on his completion of the master's degree. The Indian Academy of Sciences elected him as their fellow in 1955 and Indian National Science Academy followed suit with their fellowship in 1960. He received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, from the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in 1965. The Birbal Sahni Medal of the Indian Botanical Society reached him in 1972; the society would again honour him in 2009 with their Lifetime Achievement Award. The Indian Council of Agricultural Research awarded him the Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award in 1973 and he held the Jawaharlal Nehru Fellowship from 1976 to 1978. The Mycological Society of America selected him as their honorary member in 1983 and the Government of India awarded him the E. K. Janaki Ammal National Award for Taxonomy in 2000. The scientific community honoured Subramanian for his work; Subramaniula, Subramanianospora, Subramaniomyces, Subramania, Ceeveesubramaniomyces, Civisubramaniana and Ascosubramania are seven species of fungi named after him.

The region is almost exactly coextensive with that covered by the Planning Region of Southwest Thuringia, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce of South Thuringia, the Trades Chamber of South Thuringia and the Agricultural Office of Hildburghausen.  Origin of the name  Henneberg Franconia today The term relates to the Franconian Princely County of Henneberg at its largest extent in the mid-14th century when even the entire Pflege of Coburg belonged to it. The southern and easternmost parts of the County of Henneberg lie today in Upper Franconia, Lower Franconia and East Hesse. The society of Henneberg-Itzgrund-Franken has striven since mid-2013 to establish the name.  South Thuringia  The historical South Thuringia, as part of the subsequent Landgraviate of Thuringia lies north of the Rennsteig way. The term South Thuringia is not only used for the southwestern part of the Free State of Thuringia, however. In its broader sense the relationship with Thuringia is wrong and misleading because the region is culturally part of Franconia. Even from a political standpoint, the region belonged to Franconia for a very long time and was only transferred to through inheritance and as a dowry from the Hennebergs to the territorial lordship of the Saxon Wettins and then subsequently to Thuringia.  Henneberg Franconian  The term Henneberg Franconian (Hennebergisch- Fr√§nkisch) is occasionally used as part of the name of clubs and societies and also in referring to Henneberg Franconian timber-framed architecture (Hennebergisch-Fr√§nkischen Fachwerk).  Dialect  The main dialects spoken in Henneberg Franconia are Main-Franconian Hennebergisch, Itzgr√ºndisch, Rh√∂ner Platt and Grabfeldisch.

Protests and riots  Riots on the Schulterblatt Peaceful demonstration in boats, Binnenalster in Hamburg near town hall (2 July)The G20 summit was the main focus of German far left propaganda in 2017. More than 320 police officers were injured in the riots. Interior minister Horst Seehofer especially criticized that photos of police on duty during the summit were spread in the far left networks. Of the 1135 far-left violent incidents in that year in Germany, 832 occurred during the summit.A burnt BMW car after the first night of riots. In the weeks prior to the summit, sporadic car fires in remote places, such as the neighborhood of Blankenese, occurred regularly in the city. On the night of 18 June 2017, unidentified individuals in Berlin, Hamburg, Cologne, Dortmund, Leipzig, and Bad Bevensen caused a total of 13 arson attacks on tracks of the German railways. A security expert was quoted by the German press agency DPA as saying that a connection to left-wing extremism related to the upcoming G20 Summit was \\"conceivable\\". According to a German interior ministry spokesman, cable fires had been caused by \\"unconventional explosive and incendiary devices\\". In spite of high temperatures (30C, 86F) on 18 June, police discounted the possibility that the fires had been caused by hot weather. On 19 June, a group called \\"Shutdown G20 ‚Äì Hamburg vom Netz nehmen!\\" claimed responsibility for the attacks in an internet post. On 2 July, Greenpeace activists forced a bulk freighter loaded with charcoal from Murmansk arriving in the city to stop. The police intervened and the vessel was allowed to pass through. During the G20 week a large variety of over 25 registered protest actions and marches were planned to take place in the city of Hamburg. They included an alternative Global Solidarity Summit from 5 to 6 July and a peaceful dance-protest-march Lieber tanz ich als g20 with between 11,000 and 20,000 people attending on 5 July. Around one thousand performance artists called 1000 Gestalten covered themselves in grey pigment and slowly walked through the streets like zombies. This performance was done to draw awareness of political apathy. After walking, they all removed their grey clothes. Underneath were colourful clothes that symbolized becoming engaged and awake. On 6 July, protests turned violent when over 160 police were injured in clashes with protestors and more than 75 people were arrested. As protestors attempted to storm into the \\"red zone\\" where the summit took place they were dispersed with water cannon. Some protestors stated their goal was to block the attendees route to the summit venue; US First Lady Melania Trump was unable to attend a harbor cruise on account of the protests. On 7 July rioters set dozens of parked cars on fire. Several shops were destroyed and looted during 7 July night-time riots in the Schanzenviertel area. Masked rioters and militants from the \\"black bloc\\" went uncontrolled for a period of three hours, prompting the deployment of special armed police forces to end the violence. On 8 July 76,000 people attended the largest peaceful protest march \\"Solidarity without Borders\\", organized by an alliance of 174 groups and organizations. On early Sunday morning, 9 July, riots continued in the Schanzenviertel though the G20 leaders had already departed; 144 rioters were arrested. In total, more than 15,000 police were deployed from across the country, while 100,000 protesters attended. Local residents believed that authorities made a mistake by having the summit in a densely populated area. Police arrested 186 people overall: 132 Germans, 8 French, 7 Italians, 5 Swiss and citizens of Russia and Spain. An additional 225 people were taken into temporary custody.\\"Schweizer randalieren in der \\"H√∂lle\\"\\" Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung vom 10. Juli 2017 In the analysis by German police, it was estimated that the far-left protesters had committed more than 2000 crimes, among them vandalism (575), bodily harm (330), disturbing the peace (303), arson (123) and resisting arrest (45). Activists and media criticised police reactions to the protests, accusing them of violence and intentional conflict escalation. The riots prompted debates in the Hamburg Senate on violence from leftist militants and how to mitigate further violence in the future. Researchers concluded that methods that had been successful in reducing violence from right-wing and Islamist militants could not be re-used against left-wing militants. = Investigations and trials = In January 2020 there were thousands of court proceedings underway, where police was processing 3580 cases. Police had identified 135 suspects which were sought with photographs. Also there were 156 complaints against police, 109 of which had been dismissed. Left politicians in the Hamburg council complained that no proceeding against police had started. In July 2020 five men, four from Hesse in Germany and one from France were found guilty on riot charges after a trial which lasted 18 months. The French citizen was found guilty of inciting arson, causing bodily harm and assaulting police and was sentenced to three years in prison. The four German defendants received probationary sentences or community service. The prosecutor had called for prison sentences for all five for committing arson. = Incidents = On the eve of the G20 summit in Hamburg, China's most famous political prisoner, democracy activist and Nobel laureate Liu Xiaobo, had been given medical parole after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.

Early life and family Moorhouse was born in Dunedin in 1904. He had four sisters and two brothers. His father, Charles Edwin Moorhouse, was a keen yachtsman in Otago in his early years. His grandfather, William Sefton Moorhouse, was a nephew of the second Superintendent of Canterbury Province of the same name. As a teenager, he suffered an accident that disfigured his foot, and his left leg was shorter than the other one. He received aquarobic therapy and spent so much time in the water that at age 18, he started competing in swimming. His disability was serious enough that he had difficulty walking, and being in water was a relief. Competitive swimming He was one of two swimmers from Christchurch to compete at the 1928 Summer Olympics in swimming; the other Christchurch competitor was Dave Lindsay. At the time of the 1928 Olympics, Moorhouse was the New Zealand backstroke champion for 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, and 150 yards. Lindsay was considered New Zealand's strongest swimmer, followed by Ena Stockley from Dunedin. Moorhouse was ranked third and thus did not qualify for financial assistance, but he chose to travel to the Amsterdam Olympics at his own expense. The costs were estimated to be NZ¬£400 per athlete. At the Olympics, Moorhouse competed in the 100 metre backstroke event. He came third in his heat, with only the top two swimmers qualifying for the semi-finals. After the Olympic Games, he was highly critical of the training conditions in Amsterdam, where the American competitors were given preferential treatment and had access to the competition pool, whilst the New Zealand swimmers were given 10 minutes per day to train in a canal with stagnant water polluted with oil from ships. He lobbied for trainers to accompany all Olympic sports, even if that meant that fewer athletes could be sent. Moorhouse was the swim manager for the 1950 British Empire Games held in Auckland. Later life On 3 April 1937, Moorhouse married Kathleen Margaret \\"Peg\\" Blunden (born July 1917) at St Paul's Church in Christchurch. At the time of their wedding, he was 33 and she was 19 years old. Fellow swimmer Dave Lindsay acted as best man. A reception was held at her aunt and uncle's place Risingholme in Opawa; her uncle was the son of John Anderson, the second Mayor of Christchurch. After the wedding, the Moorhouses lived in Deans Avenue fronting Hagley Park. For most of his life, Moorhouse worked for Dominion Breweries. In 1958, they bought a home in the Marlborough Sounds. In the 1960s, they bought a house in Sunshine Bay near Waikawa, north-east of Picton. He died on 4 May 1970; sources differ as to whether this happened at Sunshine Bay in the Marlborough Region or in Christchurch. He is buried at Picton Cemetery. , his wife‚Äîweaver Peg Moorhouse‚Äîwas still alive.

Early life Born Sierra Ditson Moselle, in San Francisco, she attended Tamalpais High School in Mill Valley, California, graduating in 1998. She graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Career In 2010 Moselle was walking around New York City, where she worked and lived, when she was struck by six brothers with an unusual appearance. Introducing herself to them she began bonding over their shared love of movies. She began filming them and after a year learned that they had spent the majority of their lives stuck in a small four bedroom apartment due to their abusive father's paranoia of the outside world. Moselle completed her documentary on the brothers, entitled The Wolfpack in 2015. The film premiered at the 2015 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Documentary Grand Jury Prize. In 2016 Moselle was approached by Miu Miu to direct a short for their Women's Tales series in which female directors were given carte blanche to make short films as long as they featured Miu Miu clothing. Moselle, who had been collaborating with teenage skater girls she had met in a park, decided to film them for her short That One Day. The short premiered at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. Moselle used many of the same actors she filmed for That One Day in her 2018 film Skate Kitchen. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. In 2020, Moselle served as writer, director, and executive producer of Betty, an HBO series based upon Skate Kitchen.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Architecture and history The Peabody Library stands near the western end of the dispersed rural village of Post Mills in northern Thetford, just south of the junction of Vermont Routes 113 and 244. It is a modest single-story wood frame building, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It is well decorated with Greek Revival and early Italianate features, including quoined corners, tall windows topped by corniced lintels, and a recessed front porch supported by paneled pilasters. Above the porch is a fully pedimented gable with oculus window at the center. The interior has a single large chamber, which includes a narrow mezzanine level accessed by winding stairs near the front corners. with The library was a gift to the community of Post Mills by George Peabody, one of the first great American philanthropists. Peabody spent some time in Post Mills as a teenager, where his maternal grandfather lived. Peabody's grant of $5,000 paid for purchase of the land, construction of the building, and acquisition of 1,100 volumes.

It is in the historic parish of Rathpatrick in the south-east of the Barony of Ida. Along with the ruins of Rathpatrick church and another church, it is one of several ruins in Rathpatrick Parish. The ruin consists of a gatehouse that may have belonged to a larger structure. Gorteens comes from the Irish na goirtinsdhe which means little gorts or gardens. Archaeological excavations near the castle in 1993 indicated that the site was used between the 16th and 18th centuries, with further excavations in 2003 identifying additional castle walls and outbuildings.  Owners  The castle was originally built upon lands acquired by Raymond FitzGerald, who died in the late 1100s. The FitzGeralds were the most powerful Norman-Irish aristocratic dynasty in medieval Ireland until the 1500s. Gorteens was included in the Down Survey of Ireland in 1656 as being in the Baronys of Ida, Igrim or Ibercon and in the Parish of Rathpatricke. John FitzGerald, a Catholic, is recorded as being the last FitzGerald holder of Gorteens. Following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, FitzGerald forfeited Gorteens under the Cromwellian Settlement and was initially transplanted to Connaught in December 1653, before being assigned lands in Turlough and later in Carra, County Mayo by 1677. The duellist George Robert FitzGerald was descended from this family. By 1670, the castle at Gorteens was reputedly in the hands of Samuel Skrimsheire or Skrimshaw, a Protestant. In 1700, it was owned by members of the Forstall family.

It is hosted by Brian Williams, the network's chief anchor and former host of NBC Nightly News.  History  The show launched on September 6, 2016, as a temporary program wrapping up the election news of the day, while previewing stories that will be top-ticket news items the next morning. It replaced a rerun of All In with Chris Hayes. The program is Williams' second show in MSNBC's primetime schedule, as he formerly hosted The News with Brian Williams, which aired on the network from 1996 to 2002 before moving to CNBC. Originally the program was Monday to Thursday only, and despite its name, aired for only a half hour, which some commenters considered ironic given Williams's removal from NBC Nightly News for embellishing a speech about his experience during the Iraq War. The last half hour of Hardball aired following the half hour program. At times the program was extended due to breaking news coverage. The program expanded to Friday nights in January and on March 20, 2017 was extended to one hour daily. On April 13, 2017 MSNBC officially extended the program to an hour long. The program primarily features interviews with reporters covering the major stories of the evening, panels composed of former government officials and subject matter experts, and the occasional politician. Williams eschews the conflict-ridden panels of competing opinion shows. Interviews with newsmakers are either live or to tape as close to air time as possible, to maintain immediacy. Similar to the original Nightline which focused on the Iran hostage crisis, the program focuses primarily on the actions of the presidency of Donald Trump and Williams leads each broadcast noting the number of days of the Trump presidency. After the 2016 election, the program continued to air despite its initial billing as a temporary program. In February 2019, the New York Post labeled the show as a \\"legit hit,\\" noting it had been \\"beating CNN and Fox News for three months straight.\\" NBC News contributors Nicolle Wallace and Eugene Robinson provided commentary on most of the 2016 editions. Wallace also served as a substitute anchor in Williams' absence. Wallace's duties on the program resulted in her hosting her own show, Deadline: White House.

Pipelined parallelism may exist at different levels of abstraction like loops, functions and algorithmic stages. The extent of parallelism depends upon the programmers' ability to make best use of this concept. It also depends upon factors like identifying and separating the independent tasks and executing them parallelly.  Background  The main purpose of employing loop-level parallelism is to search and split sequential tasks of a program and convert them into parallel tasks without any prior information about the algorithm. Parts of data that are recurring and consume significant amount of execution time are good candidates for loop-level parallelism. Some common applications of loop-level parallelism are found in mathematical analysis that uses multiple-dimension matrices which are iterated in nested loops. There are different kind of parallelization techniques which are used on the basis of data storage overhead, degree of parallelization and data dependencies. Some of the known techniques are: DOALL, DOACROSS and DOPIPE. DOALL: This technique is used where we can parallelize each iteration of the loop without any interaction between the iterations. Hence, the overall run-time gets reduced from N * T (for a serial processor, where T is the execution time for each iteration) to only T (since all the N iterations are executed in parallel). DOACROSS: This technique is used wherever there is a possibility for data dependencies. Hence, we parallelize tasks in such a manner that all the data independent tasks are executed in parallel, but the dependent ones are executed sequentially. There is a degree of synchronization used to sync the dependent tasks across parallel processors.  Description  DOPIPE is a pipelined parallelization technique that is used in programs where each element produced during each iteration is consumed in the later iteration. The following example shows how to implement the DOPIPE technique to reduce the total execution time by breaking the tasks inside the loop and executing them in a pipelined manner. The breaking into tasks takes place in such a way that all the dependencies within the loop are unidirectional, i.e. the following iteration does not depend on the previous iteration. = Example = The program below shows a pseudocode for DOPIPE parallelization. In this code, we see that there are three tasks (F0, F1 and F2) inside a loop iterating over \`j\` for 1 to \`N\`. Following is a list of dependencies in the code: F1[j] ‚Üí T F1[j+1], implies that statement F1 in iteration \`j+1\` must be executed after statement F1 in iteration \`j\`. This is also known as true dependency. F1[j] ‚Üí T F2[j], implies that statement F2 in iteration \`j\` must be executed after statement F1 in iteration \`j\`. for (j=1; j<=N; j++) { F0: o[j] = x[j] - a[j]; F1: z[j] = z[j-1] * 5; F2: y[j] = z[j] * w[j]; } If this code would have been executed sequentially, then the total time consumed would be equal to N * (TF0 \\\\+ TF1 \\\\+ TF2), where TF0, TF1 and TF2 denote execution time for functions F0, F1 and F2 respectively per iteration. Now, if we parallelize the loop by pipelining the statements inside the loop in the following manner: for (j=1; j<=N; j++) { F0: o[j] = x[j] - a[j]; // DOALL parallelism } for (j=1; j<=N; j++) { F1: z[j] = z[j-1] * 5; // DOPIPE parallelism post(j); // The result of F1 is posted and available for use } for (j=1; j<=N; j++) { wait(j); // It waits till the F1 completes and produces the value z[j] to be used by F2 F2: y[j] = z[j] * w[j]; } Since, F0 is an independent function, i.e. it does not have any loop-carried dependency (no dependence on \`j+1\` or \`j-1\` iterations). Neither it has any dependency across other statements in the loop. Hence, we can completely separate out this function and run it parallelly using DOALL parallelism. On the other hand, Statements F1 and F2 are dependent (explained above), therefore we split them into two different loops and execute them in a pipelined fashion. We use \`post(j)\` and \`wait(j)\` to synchronize between F1 and F2 loops. Starting from the first iteration of \`j\`, statement F1 gets executed in TF1 time. Meanwhile, F2 is not getting executed since it is waiting for the value \`z[j]\` to be produced by F1. When F1 completes its execution for iteration \`j\`, it posts the value using \`post(j)\`. After waiting for F1's execution, using \`wait(j)\`, F2 starts its execution since it has the value \`z[j]\` available for use. Also, since F1's execution is not restricted by F2, hence F1 executes \`j+1\` simultaneously. The figure below shows the execution timeline of all the statements. DOPIPE example From the figure, we see that the total time to execute F0 is TF0, since all the iterations of F0 are executed in parallel. While for F1 and F2, the total execution time is equal to N * TF1 \\\\+ TF2 (considering negligible synchronization time). This is considerably less than the time obtained during sequential execution.  Comparison with other models  DOALL parallelism mainly works on principle of divide and conquer. Here all the tasks run in different iterations that use unique set of data. So the problem with this implementation is that when large amount of data works is computed together, a large cache space is needed to work for different threads. Since there is no dependencies in the threads, there is no overhead for the inter - thread communication. While in DOPIPE, there is a synchronization overhead between the threads. But, due to its pipelined structure, it requires less cache space because the data produced is immediately consumed by the consumer.

The district, developed as an upper middle-class residential area beginning in 1880, features a variety of architectural styles encapsulating the community's growth through about 1930. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The village of White River Junction had achieved a significant measure of economic importance in the upper Connecticut River valley by the middle of the 19th century, serving as a major railroad hub with service in four directions. The village grew in the lowlands at the mouth of the White River, with residential development at first closely spaced and near the railroad-related services. By 1880, the local merchant class sought housing that was at a remove from the noise and pollution associated with the railroad, resulting in the development of the Terraces, set on a rise southwest of the village and south of the White River. The principal roads of this area, Fairview Terrace and Hillcrest Terrace roughly follow the contours of the steep hillside. with The district includes all of Hillcrest Terrace, and all of Fairview Terrace between its junction with Hillcrest in the north and Gates Street in the south. It includes Forest Hills Avenue, which joins the two terraces near the southern end, and extends along Gates Street to Maplewood Terrace in the south. The area includes well- spaces houses that are typically vernacular interpretations of architectural styles popular between 1880 and 1930. Most are two or two-and-one-half stories in height, and of wood frame construction. A few of the houses were either built as multi-unit residences, or have been converted to such since their initial construction. A number of properties include period carriage houses.

(page number not visible) It is the oldest creamery in Ontario.\\"Why does Skim Milk have a bad rep? \\". Product Reviews Canada, April 12, 2013 Since 1981 it has been owned by the Gay Lea Foods Co-operative. History Teeswater Creamery established in the 1875 by John Hettle and John Inglis. It was the first established creamery in Ontario, and second in Canada. (Canada's first was established at Athelston, Quebec and was open for just nine days). In 1876, Hettle and Inglis entered samples of their butter in the International Exhibition in the United States, where it was judged well-made and finely flavoured. Initially, the creamery received milk from 120 cows and produced about 71 pounds of butter daily. It was open from May 10 to November 10 of each year. It was powered by a treadmill that was located on the north side of the factory. By 1880, Inglis had left, and Hettle was managing the creamery. In the early 1880s Teeswater Butter Factory, as the company was known at the time, began gathering cream instead of milk. The cream was gathered from patrons in wooden tin-lined tanks mounted on horse-drawn wagons, and measured in pails. Samples taken to measure butterfat content were tested using the inaccurate \\"oil test\\". Butter produced at the creamery was stored in 56-lb tubs. On April 19, 1894 (as reported in the Teeswater News) \\"The building of the factory for the Culross and Teeswater Butter and Cheese Manufacturing is progressing rapidly. Mr. John Y. Scott is the contractor and he expects to have his work completed by May 1.\\" At this time, the creamery was owned by S.R. Brill's father who later sold it to his son.\\"Village of Teeswater\\".

At some point between 1894 and 1922, it was renamed \\"Star Creamery\\" and had ceased making cheese. In 1922, William and Roy Thompson bought the business and changed the name to \\"Thompson Bros.\\" Cream was now brought in cans, loaded onto trucks, which were mainly Model T cars stripped of their bodies with racks added to carry over a ton of cream. It was still necessary to use horses in the winter months. For summer refrigeration, large chunks of ice were cut (primarily from the Maitland River in Wingham) and stored. Pasteurization of cream began in 1922. An 11-horsepower boiler heated the water in the water jacket; then the cream was cooled by placing ice and salt in four 18-inch metal pipes which ran from floor to ceiling in the butter storage room. In 1928, the first cork-insulated storage room was built, cooled by an ammonia compressor. In 1927, the parents and the remainder of the Thompson family followed Will and Roy to Teeswater and at one time, the partnership included five brothers: Will, Roy, Carman, Earl and Bob. In 1932, Thompson Bros. purchased the Mildmay Creamery from Ontario Dairies Limited, which at that time was producing about 80,000 lbs of butter annually. At about that time the brothers began expanding their business to include poultry and eggs. The trucks on routes picking up cream, also picked up eggs and poultry. Approximately 10 employees worked at the poultry operation, which was located in the basement of the old reformed Presbyterian Church building in Teeswater. The egg grading station was located in the former Bank of Hamilton building at Clinton and Union streets. During the war years, eggs were frozen in a form called a melange: cracked eggs were placed in a pail with a stirring device, and the result was frozen in 28 pound pails. The melange was used by commercial bakeries, and some were shipped out of Canada. Earl Thompson left in 1945, and purchased a creamery in Colbourne. At that time Roy moved to Port Credit. Bob Thompson died suddenly in Mildmay in 1950. The poultry business was conducted during the fall and winter months until the early 1950s. The egg grading station operated until the early 1970s. In 1956, the creamery began purchasing whole milk from the producers, and separating at the creamery. The skim milk was made into skim milk powder and the cream was used for butter. The first year, on the peak day, 47,000 lbs of milk were processed through the plant. In 1957 the partnership was dissolved, and Thompson Bros. became Teeswater Creamery, a private corporation with the partners of the old company becoming shareholders in the newly branded company. Equipment was upgraded at least three times over the years, to accommodate the growing business. In the 1960s, the company spent about $40,000 to build a milk waste treatment plant, and was given the Delaporte Award for environmental responsibility. In 1972 daily volume was approximately 600,000 pounds of milk, sufficient to produce 50,000 pounds of skim milk powder and 25,000 pounds of butter. Much of the milk brought into the plant in Teeswater was diverted on behalf of the Ontario Milk Marketing Board to markets in Toronto be bottled in dairies or turned into cheese. In 1977, the Milk Marketing Board and the Ontario Government banned the shipping of milk in cans, and vehicles with stainless steel bulk tanks were put into use. In 1979, a study of the plant's milk waste treatment process was carried out by the Water Research Centre, which was researching methods of treating dairy waste. In May 1981, the Teeswater Creamery was sold to Gay Lea Foods Co-Operative,\\"Gay Lea lays out dairy processing expansion plans\\".

Hudson joined the expedition whilst a 'mate' in the Royal Navy. He earned the nickname of 'Buddha', when the rest of the crew successfully tricked him into dressing-up in little more than a bedsheet for a 'fancy dress' party on the whaling station at South Georgia. During the expedition, Hudson was famed for his ability to catch penguins, which the crew used as a source of food whilst trapped on the ice. Towards the end of the expedition, Hudson suffered a severe breakdown of mental morale, possibly due to a massive boil that he developed on his buttocks. His illness caused Frank Wild, the second-in- command, a lot of worry that he would not survive. However, Hudson pulled through and eventually recovered his health. Upon return from the expedition, Hudson took part in World War I, serving on 'mystery ships'. He later also took part in World War II as a Royal Navy Reserve Convoy Commodore.

A respected scholar of law, Kokoshkin did a lot to establish the theoretical basis for the proposed development of liberal state ruled by the law, emphasizing the need to limit the possibilities for the state's interference with the personal life of an individual. Among other issues he concentrated on in his essays were the decentralization of power, autonomy and federalism, as well as theoretical and practical ways of organizing local governments for Russian provinces. Kokoshkin's political career started in 1897 when he was elected a for the Zvenigorod local government. In 1900 he joined the Moscow Governorate offices, and was for a while the head of its economy department. He was also the deputy to Sergey Muromtsev, then the secretary of the Moscow City Duma. Starting with 1903, Kokoshkin became more and more involved with the liberal politics. He joined several legal or semi-legal groups, like Beseda (Soliloquy), The Union of Local Constitutionalists and the Union of Liberation, and earned a reputation as a brilliant speaker, as well as an activist of the zemstvo movement in mid-1900s, which he provided a vast organizational work for. Kokoshkin became one of the founding members of the Constitutional Democratic Party, which he had also been a co-founder of. In 1906 he was elected for the First Russian State Duma, and became its vice-secretary. Arguably his most notable achievement there was law project regulating the principles for the equality of all citizens and the respect for civil right, backed by 151 fellow Duma members.

December 1907 After the 1907 dissolution of the Russian Duma, Kokoshkin co- authored and signed the Vyborg Manifesto, which he was promptly arrested for to spend three months in prison. As all other signatories of the document he was stripped of the right to ballot for the State Duma. Also that year, alongside several other members of the Kadet Party he was expelled from the Moscow Dvoryanstvo Assembly. Starting with 1907, Kokoshkin became an active member of the stuff of Russkiye Vedomosti, where he regularly published articles on a wide range of subjects, including parliamentarism, national identity, the situation around the Old Believers. He was the Kadet Party's leading expert on the issues of the state law and national politics. After the 1917 February Revolution Kokoshkin became the chairman of the Provisional Government's Juridical Council and a First Department senator. He was elected chairman of the special committee for preparing the project for the procedures of the election to the Constituent assembly. In the second coalitional Provisional Government of July‚ÄìAugust 1917, he was the State Controller and the leader of the Kadet fraction. After the Bolsheviks took power Kokoshkin became actively involved in preparations for the Constituent assembly elections, speaking at rallies and meetings.

Description P. algidus is 13‚Äì28 mm in length with females usually larger than males and in some areas it is a mainly black wasp with a red spot on the metasoma. However, the wasps of the genus Poecilopompilus may be M√ºllerian mimics of other wasps and that the variation in appearance of P.algidus over its range is due to it mimicking other sympatric wasps with painful stings, for example it resembles the paper wasps in the genus Polistes in the south, and thus be difficult to distinguish from its congener Poecilopompilus interruptus, but in the northern part of its range, it mimics the spider wasps of the genus Anoplius. To identify the two species, the observer needs to examine the spines on the front tarsi of females and the inner margin of the eyes, P. algidus females have 3 strong spines and the species shows convergent inner eye margins, while P. interruptus shows four weak spines on the front tarsi in females and parallel inner eye margins. Subspecies There are 5 recognised subspecies *Poecilopompilus algidus algidus (Smith, 1855) eastern North America. *Poecilopompilus algidus coquilletti (Provancher) south western United States *Poecilopompilus algidus fervidus (Smith, 1873) Neotropical *Poecilopompilus algidus marcidus (F.W., 167815) western North America *Poecilopompilus algidus rubiginosus Distribution From the Ontario south through the United States of America, Mexico and Central America to Argentina. Habitat Prefers sandy areas where it is fossorial but can be found in well vegetated areas. Biology In the northern part of its range it is a univoltine mid-summer to late autumn species, bit in the warmer parts of its range it is probably multivoltine. Male specimens have been captured at flowers of Baccharis spp, Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Heracleum lanatum and Melilotus albus while females have also been taken at the flowers of Melilotus. Females provision the burrows with spiders of the family Araneidae. In S√£o Paulo State, Brazil females of P.a. fervidus were observed while breeding in a sandy bank among a plantation of Eucalyptus. The wasps hunted spiders in the understorey, these wasps are regarded as a specialist hunter of orb web spiders, in the family Araneidae. The wasps were observed to switch from Nephila clavipes in July to Parawixia sp., Argiope argentata and Araneus sp. as the year progressed. Observations of the nominate subspecies in southern Florida showed that the female wasps hunted in the late afternoon and that they actively hunted within the scrub and trees at heights of between 3m and 20m. The wasps hunted by actively walking on the surface of the vegetation, intermittently flicking their wings but stayed in the outer layers of leaves and did not enter into deeper cover. The only prey observed as an adult female Eriophora ravilla which the wasp had placed in vegetation 8 cm above the ground, while the wasp excavated a burrow 1.2m away. The burrow was excavated in bare sand among dried pine needles, the wasp used her mandibles to break the crust on the surface of the sand, and then used her forelimbs to excavate the looser sand, which was removed by the wasp backing out to a distance of 10‚Äì13 cm. Her digging activities got faster as she neared completion of the burrow, occasionally interrupting her efforts to inspect and move the prey. To move the prey it was dragged backwards over the ground and under the vegetation while the wasp held it by the base of the hind femur. before placing the spider in the nest she carried out further excavation and appeared to line the nest with dried pine needles which she carried into the burrow, then the spider was grabbed by its chelicerae and dragged into the burrow. The wasp then backfilled the burrow with loose sand using its forelegs and once the burrow was filled it appeared to tamp the sand down with its abdomen before place pine needles over the now buried nest.

With population of approximately 1.08 million people, they constitutes 70% of Pahang state's population, making them the dominant ethnic group in the state. Their language, Pahang Malay is one of many Malayan languages spoken in the region that belong to the Malayo- Polynesian group of Austronesian family. Although their history goes back more than one millennium, the community came to prominence when the old Pahang Sultanate was established in 1470. The sultanate was merged with Johor in 1623, but later revived in 1881 and incorporated as protectorate of the British Empire. In 1948, it formed Federation of Malaya together with other Malay Sultanates in the peninsular, that later reconstituted as Malaysia. The Pahang Malays, along with Terengganuan Malays and Kelantanese Malays (and sometimes Thai Malays and the Malays of Anambas islands and Natuna islands in Indonesia) are collectively referred to as the Orang Pantai Timur (People of the East Coast) due to their closely related history, cultures and languages. History The Tembeling Valley which constitutes the upper reaches of the Pahang River is an area of great historical significance to Pahang. There yielded many archeological relics of Paleolithic, Hoabinhian, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Age cultures. Ancient Pahang sits astride the 'Austric marchland'- the territory where the Mon-Khmer-speaking (Austroasiatic) cultures meet up with the Malayic and pre-Malayic-speaking (Austronesian) cultures. The early settlers lived by mining gold, tin and iron and planting rice. They left many traces; irrigation works, mine workings, remains of brick buildings, and probably the pottery industry at Kuala Tembeling. Ancient settlements can be traced from Tembeling to as far south as Merchong. Their tracks can also be found in deep hinterland of Jelai, along the Lake Chini, and up to the head-waters of the Rompin. One such settlement was identified as Koli from Geographia (2nd century CE), a thriving port located on the estuary of Kuantan River, where foreign ships stopped to barter and resupply. The oldest known reference to Pahang ‚Äì as the kingdom of 'Pohuang' (Â©ÜÁöá)- was found in the Book of Song from the 5th century CE. This polity is believed to be the southernmost extension of the federation of city states of Langkasuka-Kadaram, that later incorporated into an even larger federation of Srivijaya from the 7th century. It remains unclear when Islam began to gain its foothold in Pahang, but historian like de Er√©dia mentioned that Islam already introduced in Pahang before it was accepted by Melaka in the 15th century. Pahang, described by de Er√©dia as Pan, was one of the two kingdoms of Malayos in the peninsula, in succession to Pattani, that flourished before Melaka. The Pahang ruler then, titled Maharaja, was also the overlord of countries of 'Ujong Tanah' (land's end), the southerly part of the peninsula including ancient Singapore. The old court name was Inderapura, and the capital has always been known as 'the town'. The pre-Melakans calling it by Sanskrit name Pura, the Malays 'Pekan', the Portuguese 'a Cidade', while the people of Rompin and Bebar described the Capital as Pekan Pahang. Pura may have covered a much larger than the town known as Pekan today. In addition to modern Pekan, it appears to have comprised the land on the banks of Pahang river as far as Tanjung Langgar. Pahang Malay women wearing traditional dress in a rifle training during the Malayan Emergency. The Malayisation of Pahang intensified from the mid 15th century after the state was annexed by Melaka Sultanate. Following a brief period of being a governorate, the state was established as a sultanate in 1470 by a Melakan prince, Muhammad Shah, and remained a vassal of Melaka until the latter's demise in 1511. In 1624, Pahang was nominally merged with Johor, when its 14th Sultan, Abdul Jalil Shah III was also proclaimed as the 7th Sultan of Johor. Pahang remained a constituent dominion ruled by the Bendaharas, until Johor Empire's gradual dismemberment in late 18th century. In 1805, ruler of Pahang, Tun Ali formally proclaimed independence, ending more than two centuries of union with Johor. His son, Tun Ahmad, who won the bitter civil war against his elder brother Tun Mutahir, revived the Pahang Sultanate after proclaiming himself Sultan of Pahang in 1882. Not long after that, the British imperialism manifested itself in Pahang with the appointment of a British Resident to the Sultan of Pahang in 1888. Like other Malay States, Pahang also suffered during the Japanese occupation of Malaya until the year 1945. Then in 1948, it joined the Federation of Malaya, which gained Independence in 1957. Today, Pahang is a prosperous state with an expanding economy, fuelled by agriculture, manufacturing and tourism. Language Pahang Malays are known for their unique spoken language called Pahang Malay, and natively referred as Base Pahang (which means \\"Pahang language\\") or Cakak Pahang (which means \\"Pahang speech\\"). This form of Malayan language is closely related to Terengganu Malay (Base Tranung) and Kelantan Malay (Baso Kelate) due to their common origin. These east coast dialects demonstrate a number a shared lexical, synctatic, and phonetics innovations and their speakers can easily communicate with each other, although there are still some phonological and vocabulary differences. The distribution of Pahang Malay is predominantly in the Pahang state, although there are other Malayan language spoken, for example a unique dialect of Tioman Island closely related only to Sarawak Malay spoken across the South China Sea. An east coast dialect, Terengganu Malay is in fact native in certain areas primarily in narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang. This complicated spatial layering of different Malay variants, often within a few kilometres radius between hamlets of Pahang Malay speakers along the riverine systems and the Terengganu-speaking coastal fishermen villages, is influenced by the historical movement of Terengganu Malays to that area. There are small Pahang-speaking community in the valley of the Lebir River in Kelantan and the upper portions of several rivers near the Perak and Selangor boundaries, descendants of fugitives from the civil war that ravaged their homeland in the 19th century. There are three main variants of Pahang Malay, spoken along the lining of the three main rivers; Pahang River, Jelai River and Lipis River, which differs between one another in phonological pattern and vocabulary. These variants have been classified further into two main sub-dialects; Hulu Pahang ('Upper Pahang') consisting Lipis and Jelai rivers variants, and Hilir Pahang ('Lower Pahang') consisting Pahang River variant. Culture Traditional Pahang Malay style houses seen in Kampung Baharu, Pahang, circa 1930‚Äì1940. The ancestors of modern Pahang Malays, were a hybrid community of multiple origins and cultures. The early settlers consist primarily from both various Mon-Khmer speaking Austroasiatic tribes and Malayic speaking Austronesians. These early communities, were largely animists, believing in the existence of semangat (spirits) in everything. Around the opening of the common era, Hinduism and Buddhism were introduced by Indian traders to the Malay Archipelago, where they flourished with the establishment of a Hindu-Buddhist state from the 5th century. The shift into the dominant Malayic cultures with Siamese influence, is believed to have taken place in situ, involving such political processes as the establishment of a late Srivijayan outpost in the Ithmus, the fall of Srivijaya, the extension of Thai rule into the area and lastly the arrival of Islam in the region from as early as the 14th century. Malayisation intensified in Pahang after it was established as a Malay-Muslim Sultanate in 1470, and continued until as late as the 19th century. The development of many Malay-dominated centres in the state, drew many of the aboriginals to embrace Malayness by converting to Islam, emulating the Malay speech and their dress. Due to their closely related history, Pahang Malays share a similar culture with other sub-groups of Malay people native to the Malay peninsula. They are in particular closely affiliated to peoples of the east coast of the peninsula like Thai Malays, Terengganuan Malays and Kelantanese Malays. Nevertheless, there are still aspects of Malay culture that unique to Pahang itself. =Traditional dress= In the pre-Islamic Pahang, like most of the tropical world, the early traditional costumes were simple, using a single piece of cloth. This was the description by Fei Xin, a Chinese Muslim and an Arabic scholar who wrote in the Xingcha Shenglan in 1436. He wrote an interesting account of Pahang and its people, extract of the text of which are as follows:\\\\- The \\"knot\\" mentioned above actually refers to the chignons ('sanggul' in Malay). There are various ways of tying the hair in a chignon or locks, and one of the hairstyles of the Pahang women is called distinctively as the Sanggul Pahang (Pahang chignon). When the trade with foreign countries flourished, the clothing styles began extensively accepting foreign influences and became more sophisticated. The 15th century was the time when Melaka Sultanate at its apex with Islam as its official religion. The strong Islamic influence had transformed the clothing styles in accordance to Islamic values. The early forms of Baju Melayu and Baju Kurung originated from this period, which both would become the primary traditional dress of Malay people for many centuries to come. Over the centuries, a distinctive style of Baju Kurung was developed in Pahang, commonly known as Baju Kurung Pahang or Baju Riau-Pahang, or sometimes called Baju Turki. This is a long gown styled dress, cut at the front with 7 or more buttons and worn with a sarong. The Malay handloom industry traced its origin since the 13th century when the eastern trade route flourished under Song dynasty. Mention of locally made textiles as well as the predominance of weaving in Malay peninsular was made in various Chinese and Arab accounts. By the 16th century, the silk weaving industry in Pahang had perfected a style called Tenun Pahang, a special clothing fabric used in the special traditional Malay costumes and attires of Pahang rulers and palace officials. In addition to silk weaving, Batik weaving has been part of the small cottage industry in the state. Although not as popular, Pahang batik has, nevertheless, thrived as a small industry in the periphery of the fame and popularity of the Trengganu and Kelantan batik. =Martial arts= Silat Melayu practiced in Pahang are diverse, with vast differences in training tools, methods and philosophy across different schools and styles. The Silat Melayu of Pahang may generally be divided into two major groups. Styles like Lincah, Gayong and Cekak which are widely practiced at national level in Malaysia, coexist with eclectic local Pahang styles like Silat Terlak, Silat Lian, Silat Tari Pulut, Silat Melayu Lok Keris 9, Silat Sendeng 2 Beradik, Silat Tongkat Panding Juan, Silat Laksamana, Silat Sutan Muaakad, Silat Pedang, Silat Setimbun Tulang, Silat Carik Kapor and Silat Sangkar Maut. Other forms of silat also exist especially in the very remote villages, with members consisting of a few students. The current law and regulations require that the silat bodies need to be registered as an association or club. Therefore, we find that those silat forms with very few members are those which are being practiced in a secretive way in remote areas and are taught only by invitation of the master. The variety of styles of Silat Melayu not only demonstrated many different combat skills, but also the ability of the martial art itself in manifesting different personages and community in warrior traditions from various districts of Pahang. =Literature and folklore= The literary tradition in Pahang traced back to the time of the old Pahang Sultanate. Contribution into the rich Classical Malay literature is attested in the form of legal literature like Hukum Kanun Pahang and historical literature like Hikayat Pahang. Until the early 20th century, many of the literary works were the effort of individual writers specialized in certain subjects. Among notable writers were Shihabuddin Zainal Abidin whose works are of religious literature in syair genre and Ibrahim Hj Yaacob whose works promote nationalistic sentiments in colonial Malaya. Other prominent literary figures include Ishak Haji Muhammad (Pak Sako), Keris Mas, Hj Zakaria Hitam (Pak Zek) and Hj Ibrahim Omar. The natural setting of Pahang, its history, people and culture became important themes for the literature in Pahang. The famous fictional work of Ishak Haji Muhammad, Putera Gunung Tahan (1938) took Mount Tahan as its setting, while Keris Mas's Rimba Harapan set in Kampung Ketari, Bentong. There are also poems by Sahmad Malaya describing Janda Baik, Mount Tahan, Bukit Tinggi and Chini Lake. Another writer, Zakaria Hitam was a notable Pahang-born scholar known for his collection of oral tradition of Pahang folklore. Prominent Malay folklore of Pahang origin, includes such bardic tales as the legends of Walinong Sari, Sang Kelembai, Seri Gumum Dragon and Seri Pahang. In 1957, the community of Pahang writers established Dewan Persuratan Melayu Pahang ('Institute of Pahang Malay Letters') as a platform to promote new generation of writers and to spread Pahang literary works to the Malaysian masses. =Folk songs= Pahang folk songs refer to the collection of songs of unknown origin, possibly in existence among Malay communities in Pahang since the animistic era. The songs may be classified as a type of old oral literature in poetic forms, which exist in several different genres. The most notable one is a set of 36 songs in Indung dance. The singing of Indung begin with the song Anak Indung, and ends with the song Pulang Indung, in which both songs share the same melody but different in their lyrics. Another significant genre is a set of healing songs in Saba dance commonly performed to celebrate the recovery of a patient by a Bomoh (Malay shaman). As Saba is a part of the traditional curing, the lyrics have many special terms used in shamanistic charms. There are other genres exist, among others are songs from traditional dances of Mayang', Limbung and Lukah, songs from Dikir Rebana, Berdah, Main Puteri and Ugam performances, as well as Lagu dodoi (lullabies), Lagu bercerita (story telling songs) and Lagu Permainan (children game songs). Popular Pahang folk songs included; Walinong Sari, Burung Kenek-Kenek, Pak Sang Bagok, Lagu Zikir, Lagu Orang Muda, Pak Sendayung, Anak Ayam Turun Sepuluh, Cung-Cung Nai, Awang Belanga, Kek Nong or Dayang Kek Nong, Camang Di Laut, Datuk Kemenyan Tunggal, Berlagu Ayam, Walida Sari, Raja Donan, Raja Muda, Syair Tua, Anak Dagang, Puteri Bongsu, Raja Putera, Puteri Mayang Mengurai, Puteri Tujuh, Pujuk Lebah, Ketuk Kabung (Buai Kangkong) and Tebang Tebu. =Performing arts= Of the wide of Malay performing arts, many of are localized in particular regions, while others shared with a variety of local styles. Early forms of ritual theatre amongst the Pahang Malays include the Main Puteri, Saba and many forms of Ugam performances. There are Ugam Mayang, Ugam Lukah, Ugam Kukur and Ugam Serkap, all of which involve trance and serve as agents of healing through communication between a bomoh in trance and invisible beings who are believed to be one of the principal causes of diseases. Ugam Mayang is also popularly known in Terengganu and the rest of Malaysia as Ulek Mayang. One of the most popular dance theatre is Mak Yong, which is also performed in Kelantan and Terengganu, and based on east coast mythology. Performances involve about a dozen artists, accompanied by an ensemble of musicians playing the rebab, gongs and drums (gendang). Popular dance forms also include Joget Pahang( a local style of Joget), Zapin Pekan and Zapin Raub (local styles of Zapin), and Dikir Pahang or Dikir Rebana (a modified and secularised form of dhikr or religious chanting, also performed in Kelantan as Dikir barat). Dikir Rebana which is further divided into Dikir Maulud and Dikir Berdah, has many songs played by a group of 5 to 7 people and was historically performed in the royal court. Pahang performing arts also include some native dance forms like Limbung, Labi-Labi, Pelanduk and Indung. Indung is performed with a set of 36 songs traditionally sang by women while working in the paddy field, especially during grass cuting. Each song was attached with a specific pantun. It is a group singing, in unison, where the form is an alternation between a solo singer and the whole group. There were no musical instruments involved in Indung singing. Within the Indung songs, there are many lullabies. On the other hand, there are also a few songs that are sung with dance movements. A distinct form of gamelan adopted from the Javanese culture during the time of Johor Empire, known as Malay Gamelan or Gamelan Pahang, forms the main musical ensemble heritage in the state and patronized by royal court of Pahang since the 19th century. =Cuisine= Traditional Pahang cuisine has a lot of similar features with other Malay cuisine, and features a lot of seafood. From its rivers and lakes come the fresh water fish such as the patin (silver catfish). Certain dishes are shared with other Malay groups, like Singgang, Tembosa, Satak and Lempeng Nyiur which also commonly found in Kelantan and Terengganu. While some other regional dishes are prepared in Pahang style like Ikan Bakar Petai and Laksa Pahang. There are also popular foreign dishes prepared with the distinctly Pahang style like Murtabak Mengkasar and Puding Diraja ('Royal Pudding'), both can be found in Pahang's royal capital, Pekan. Like many other Asian cultures, the staple food in a Pahang culinary tradition is rice, which is commonly served with gulai or singgang, ulam and sambal condiments. Popular sambals are sambal hitam, sambal tempoyak and sambal belacan. One of the most famous gulai in Pahang that has been established as the signature dish of the state, is Gulai Tempoyak Patin. This is a traditional dish consists of juicy, tender patin fish cooked in curry made of tempoyak (fermented durian). Other notable Pahang gulai are Gulai Patin Asam Rebus (a dish similar to the Gulai Tempoyak Patin but the watery soup or gravy, tastes a little sour and spicy) and Gulai Asam Rong (a sour and slightly bitter taste gulai made of processed rubber tree fruits). Other popular Pahang dishes are Nasi Kebuli, Opor Daging and Paceri Nenas.

The theater, which caters to families and school groups, operates both in a physical location (Geppetto's Marionette Theater) and as a touring group.  History  The theatre opened in Arlington, Texas, in 1992. The theater was founded by John Hopkins, a former puppeteer from Six Flags Over Texas and Pady Blackwood, of Howdy Doody fame and former Bil Baird artist. The theater was created by converting the former Greyhound bus station in downtown Arlington into a miniature stage that housed a bridge stage with a fly rail system, seating for 80 persons, concession counter, and a small retail gift shop. The theater catered to families and children, as well as welcomed child care organizations, schools field trips, and other youth organizations. Unlike most theaters, the company structure was for profit. The primary income source for the theater was ticket sales derived through group bookings. The shows the first season included Hansel and Gretel, Aladdin, and The Wizard of Oz. Although popular with local families, the theater experienced a sluggish start. In the 4th year of operation, the landlord raised the rent and the theater became financially unstable when sales stalled during non-peak seasons. In 1995, an agreement was made to move the theater to Dallas, and the Arlington location closed in 1996. = Le Theatre de Marionette at NorthPark Center and Ridgmar Mall = In 1995, Le Theatre de Marionette was invited to join NorthPark Center in Dallas. An agreement was made with the mall management and construction of a marionette theater began in September 1995. The theater opened the week of Thanksgiving in 1995, with Hopkins and Blackwood as the key managing figures, and Hopkins as the actual theater owner. In 1996, amidst internal conflicts, Blackwood left Le Theatre de Marionette to start his own company. In January 1997, Hopkins sold the NorthPark Le Theatre de Marionette to John Hardman who continued to operate the theater with his other theatrical operations, including an annual marionette show, The World on a String, performed at the State Fair of Texas, and seasonal shows for NorthPark center. Hopkins and Hardman continued to work together with Hopkins maintaining a production role and Hardman tending to the day-to-day operation of the theater. In 1999, a second Le Theatre de Marionette was opened at Ridgmar Mall in Fort Worth, TX by Hopkins in a joint venture with Shopco Group of New York, as part of the mall expansion and renovation. The theater was located in the newly-remodeled wing of the mall. Like the Dallas location, the theater was located directly next to prominent retailer Neiman Marcus. In 2002, amid fears arising from the recent 9/11 attacks, and subsequent loss of business, the theater announced a sudden and abrupt closure as a temporary measure. Within six months, it was decided to not reopen the Fort Worth location. In 2003, the NorthPark theater closed normal operation when the mall began a massive remodeling. The theater opened annually for Christmas for two additional years before closing permanently in 2005. In 2004, John Hardman sold his interests in Le Theatre de Marionette to a Dallas circus performer, Dick Monday, who attempted to open a similar operation at a competing Dallas mall, the Galleria. The new business was called Slappy's Playhouse and had no actual affiliation with Le Theatre de Marionette. Slappy's Playhouse closed in 2010, citing lack of business to sustain the operation. File:LTDM Proscenium - 1993.jpgNick Coppola Stands in front of proscenium at Le Theatre de Marionette, 1994. = Le Theatre de Marionette as a touring company = In 2005, Kent Williams, a local Dallas voice actor, kabuki artist, and puppeteer entered into agreements with John Hopkins and John Hardman to retrieve and refurbish the shows and tour the programs in local schools, museums, and other cultural centers with grants made in part by ArtsPartners Texas Commission on the Arts. In 2006, Le Theatre de Marionette became a roster presenter for Big Thought. In 2007, John Hopkins regained control of the company and transformed Le Theatre de Marionette into a touring and production company with Kent Williams as the newly founded director of education. The duo teamed with Todd Haberkorn, a Dallas voice actor and film director who contributed audio and video production experience to enhance the stage quality of the productions and projects. The focus of the new company was larger stage shows and commercially viable events. The theater company continued to build on previous shows and launched their first large stage show, The Little Mermaid in 2013, at the Historic Palace Theater in Grapevine, Texas. Le Theatre de Marionette continued to expand into markets beyond schools, libraries, and museums. Since 2013, Le Theatre de Marionette has produced shows for special events with an emphasis on holiday programs and restaged classic children's fairy tales. In 2014, Le Theatre de Marionette entered into an agreement with Hilton Hotels and Crow Holdings to open Geppetto's Marionette Theater inside the Hilton Anatole in Dallas. As part of the hotel's strategic move to cater to families, Hilton announced the collaboration in June 2014. Le Theatre de Marionette performs over 200 shows per year outside their theater home, Geppetto's Marionette Theater. Most of their performances are designed for schools, libraries, and museums. In 2015, Le Theatre started construction of touring stages and explored other puppetry mediums including black art puppetry, large body puppets and shows geared for larger arenas.

He based his description of C. nodanotherwon on three specimens, collected from 1980 to 1981 by Robin Best of the National Institute of Amazonian Research. The male holotype and female allotype were both deposited in the UNSM. The specific name, nodanotherwon, is wordplay referring to the English phrase \\"not another one\\". Ratcliffe's description listed its etymology as \\"the result of an arbitrary combination of letters\\", but that it resulted in \\"a species name not inappropriate in such a large genus\\". Cyclocephala is the largest genus in the subfamily Dynastinae, with approximately 350 described species ; at least 240 Cyclocephala species had already been described by the time Radcliffe wrote his description of C. nodanotherwon.

It has a frame story about a man who enters the world of theatre, but the book mainly consists of phantasmagorical tales and allegories concerning art, alienation and German identity. An English translation by Roslyn Theobald was published in 1995. Plot Leon Pracht, a young man, abandons a budding career in the footsteps of his father‚Äîa historian of religion specialised on Montanus‚Äîafter the positive reception of his debut as a theatre director. He is recruited for an adaptation of Jean Genet's The Maids in Cologne, starring the two diva actresses Petra \\"Pat\\" Kurzrok and Margarethe \\"Mag\\" Wirth. However, Pat and Mag turn out to be too much to handle. Leon asks for advice from the local star director Alfred Weigert, but still fails to actualise his vision for the play. A woman enters a forest and finds a department store named The Tower of the Germans. After a phantasmagorical episode she finds herself naked in front of the proprietor of the Germans. The proprietor of the Germans is a large, floating head which is half man and half carp. A man is doing a study on an alternative community whose members are known as the Syks. After observing their unusual habits he commits a social error which freaks out a local woman. He is banished from the colony and takes part in a dreamlike ritual involving scatological sexual activity. Afterwards his female colleague writes a scathing report about his unprofessional behaviour. A king dies and is condemned as a criminal, which becomes a long-lasting national trauma. At a terrace behind the castle, a number of people are gathered: the paramedic Reppenfries, his sister-in-law Paula and wife Dagmar, the beautiful Almut, the \\"modern\\" Hanswerner, the mail clerk Yossica, and the narrator, Leon. Each person tells a personal story or discusses art and philosophy. Later, Leon finds Yossica who has been transformed into a clump of earth with a face. She explains how she, an aspiring songwriter, had met two peculiar talent scouts, Schwarzsicht and Zuversicht. The first, dressed in ragged clothes, offered her a slowly developing talent which eventually would result in timeless quality. The second, dressed elegantly and dancing, offered her to become the leading star of a new trend. Yossica tried to trick the agents so she could have both, but the attempt failed badly and she became a lump of earth. She asks Leon to bring her with him and put her in soil so she can grow into her former self. Leon works as a photographer and lives with Yossica. She convinces him to go and meet Alfred Weigert who is staying at a skyscraper hotel in their city. Weigert has had a massive success as Ossia, the main character is a series of comedy films which he also directed. As Ossia‚Äîthe name he has become known under also in private‚Äîhe brilliantly captures the German national character, playing a Prussian vagabond described in the press as a mix between Parsifal and Paracelsus. Leon had been involved in the making of the first Ossia film but after that left the industry. When Leon and Yossica meet Ossia in his room, he has aged poorly and become an overweight recluse. He has not appeared as an actor in his last two films, which have been disjointed, pseudo-profound and not nearly as successful as the previous ones. In desperation, Ossia asks Leon to collaborate on a new film project. Ossia hands him notes to read and starts to explain the project, intended as a vehicle for Pat in a great female comedic role, but the film lacks structure and Leon disapproves of it. Leon asks Ossia to come along for a walk to get some fresh air, but Ossia declines and remains inside the tower. Reception Publishers Weekly reviewed the book in 1995 and described it as \\"a bulky series of fables, phantasmagoria and allegories\\". The critic wrote that some of the stories \\"include unsettling surreal touches\\", but that most of them \\"are heavier-than-air fantasies that tend to revolve around the usual postmodern problems of alienated intellectuals, cultural collisions and consumer dystopias\\". \\"Ultimately\\", the critic wrote, \\"this is less a novel of ideas, or even of characters, than a series of grandiloquent speeches and freakish dream sequences\\".

Investigators initially suspected Meehan had fled the scene out of fear, or was suffering from amnesia as a result of head trauma. Over 5,000 alleged sightings of Meehan were reported in the months and years after her disappearance, several of which were confirmed by police, but none of which led to her discovery. The case received substantial media attention for its unusual circumstances, as well as the Meehan family's cross-country search for their daughter. Her disappearance was featured on the NBC series Unsolved Mysteries in the fall of 1989. , Meehan's disappearance remains unsolved. Timeline =Prior to disappearance= Meehan was born to Dolly and Thomas Meehan in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she was raised. Meehan attended college in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma where she studied early childhood development in preparation for a career in daycare. In 1985, she abandoned that pursuit and relocated to Bozeman, Montana where she worked as a ranch hand, citing her love of animals as the reason behind her career shift. Meehan had been working odd jobs in addition to the ranch work in order to support herself.

Bueller managed to swerve onto the shoulder, avoiding a head-on collision, but the vehicle crashed into the car traveling behind her, driven by off-duty police dispatcher Carol Heitz. Heitz emerged from the car wreckage unharmed; on the road, she witnessed a blonde woman emerge from the other car, walk up to her, and stare as though she were \\"looking right through her.\\" According to Heitz, the woman did not speak. Bueller, who remained pulled over on the shoulder of the road, then witnessed the blonde woman climb over a fence and stand motionless, observing the scene: > As I looked out across the accident, I noticed someone on the other side of > the fence. [She was] standing there like a spectator - not like it had > happened to her. Bueller watched as the unidentified woman stood silently for several moments on the opposite side of the fence before walking away into an empty field, vanishing into the night. Bueller immediately drove into town to reach a phone, while her father stayed with Heitz at the scene of the accident. When police arrived, the unidentified female driver of the other vehicle was nowhere to be found. Within thirty minutes, her identity was revealed to be Meehan, which police determined after running the vehicle's license plate number through the Department of Motor Vehicles database. =Investigation= In their search immediately following the accident, police discovered a trail of tennis shoe tracks beginning in a desolate field approximately from the scene of the crash. Based on the size of the shoe impressions, the tracks were believed to be Meehan's. Investigators followed the tracks until 3 a.m. on the morning of April 21, before finding that they eventually disappeared in the terrain. The search was suspended until the following morning. The Meehan family arrived in Montana shortly after their daughter's disappearance, and distributed over 2,000 missing person flyers throughout the area. Local volunteers searched the surrounding mountains and terrain near the site of the crash by horse and ATV, and the Meehan family also employed a helicopter search to no avail. Abandoned coal mines in the area were also searched, but no traces of Meehan were discovered. The site of the accident near Circle was nearly 400 miles from Meehan's home in Bozeman,According to Google Maps, Circle, Montana is approximately 381.2 miles from Bozeman and neither law enforcement nor Meehan's family could explain her reasons for being in the area. Police initially theorized that Meehan fled the scene by hitchhiking, or stowing away on a hay truck that had been parked from the site of the accident, though no sightings were reported to support either claim. According to Meehan's mother, she had been experiencing depression at the time, and had also been visiting a psychologist, whom she had made an appointment with for the morning of April 21. Amidst her belongings, Meehan's family developed a roll of film from her camera, which revealed a self-portrait she had taken in front of a mirror. Early on in the case, it was suspected that Meehan may have been suffering from amnesia. =Alleged sightings= There have been over 5,000 reported sightings of a woman resembling Meehan since her disappearance. On May 4, 1989, a police officer in Luverne, Minnesota claimed to have seen Meehan sitting inside a Hardee's restaurant; she had been drinking water alone in a booth for over five hours until the restaurant's closing time, then walked to a nearby 24-hour diner. When the officer questioned her, she refused to give her name, and claimed to be from Colorado and then Israel. The following day, on May 5, two other sightings of Meehan were reported : one in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where a waitress claimed Meehan had sat inside a truck stop diner drinking coffee from 12 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.; the same day, a waitress at another diner in Murdo, South Dakota reported seeing Meehan between 10 and 11 p.m. in the company of a man who appeared to be in his thirties. On May 19, 1989, shortly after her disappearance, a waitress at a restaurant near Meehan's home in Bozeman reported seeing her there. According to the waitress, Meehan ordered and ate breakfast in a hurried manner, and mentioned that she had to go shopping at 9 a.m. Another waitress working the same morning also saw Meehan at the restaurant, and reported that she appeared to be disoriented and talking to herself. The same week, another reported sighting occurred at a horse auction in Billings, Montana. Over two weeks later, on May 30, a woman resembling Meehan was seen by a passing truck driver on Interstate 90 in rural Washington. The driver offered her a ride, which she declined, and the woman told another passing female motorist that her car had broken down and that she was going to find a phone. Another alleged sighting of Meehan was reported the following week in Tacoma, Washington by a Port of Tacoma employee who claimed to have seen her at a truck stop on Interstate 5 asking strangers for directions to Aberdeen. By June 1989, over twenty-five sightings of Meehan had been reported, three of which were confirmed by police. Other reported sightings of Meehan were received by law enforcement throughout the Pacific Northwest, many at truck stops between Montana and Seattle. Law enforcement believed Meehan may have been in Washington state during this time, as she had an ex-boyfriend in Spokane, and her sister resided in Seattle. On August 30, 1990, a transient woman was arrested by police in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho for littering. The woman bore a resemblance to Meehan, and the arresting officer initially believed it to be her. On September 1, the woman appeared in a Kootenai County court, where she claimed before the judge to be a missionary traveling between Montana and Washington. Although the reported sighting made news in The Seattle Times, it was confirmed through fingerprint analysis that the woman was in fact not Meehan. Speaking to the media and law enforcement, Meehan's former boyfriend Kurt Fletcher of Spokane, Washington noted there was a \\"strong resemblance\\" and that the woman had a similar voice to Meehan's. Media depictions Meehan's case was featured on NBC's Unsolved Mysteries on November 1, 1989, which would have been Meehan's 38th birthday, on episode 6, season 2.

Its congregants include 1,200 families. It was founded in 1852. History Monroe already had a Catholic parish when St. Michael's was founded, but because the members of the existing church were predominately Francophone, in 1852 the German- speaking immigrant families asked bishop Peter Paul Lefevre for a new parish and their request was approved. The present building was built from 1866‚Äì1867. It is in the Archdiocese of Detroit. Its current priest is Rev. Kishore Battu, who is currently serving as administrator. When the parish was first established, the mayor of Monroe palatial residence was remodeled as a temporary church. It was used as a church on the first floor and on the second it was used for the school. Later it would only be used as St. Michael School. Then in 1866 the cornerstone for the present church was laid. The large 187 foot steeple wasn't added until 1883. In 1874 the 3-story rectory was built east of the church. In 1918 the parish built the present building of St. Michael School which is now a part of Monroe Catholic Elementary Schools. The movement to establish the parish started in 1845 by 14 German immigrants who wanted to worship in their native language. The only nearby church was St. Mary of the Immaculate Conception right across the river where St. Michael stands today. St. Mary's only worshiped in French and wouldn't hold services in other languages like German and Irish. The German and Irish families were forced to move to the second floor of the rectory to have mass in their native languages. When the German families were able to acquire land they were eager to leave St. Mary's to start a parish of their own. They first purchased an empty lot Humphrey Street but the plan was soon abandoned. They then purchased the first mayor of Monroe's estate to build the church and it remains the current site of the church. Inside of St. Michael's looking towards the three altars from the choir loft. The inside of the church consists of many beautiful paintings and statues. The stations of the cross inside of the church are very large and one of a kind. They were added into the Church in the summer of 1923 when artisan Matthew Ising was paid to decorate St. Michael's. The original stained glass windows were donated at $100 each. The last remaining stained glass window from when the church was first built is the beautiful rose widow above the altar. The present windows were installed in the 1940s. St. Michael's has three breathtaking altars. There is an altar dedicated to Mary and Joseph and the main altar. Rev. Stephen Rooney (pastor 1995-2008) had the church repainted and remodeled in the late 1990s and the paintings were made to represent how the church once looked in the late 1800s. The three altars were painted, the wall in the middle of the choir loft that covered the beautiful stained glass window in the middle of the south end of the church was removed giving off more light, and organ was fixed and replaced. Hardwood floors were also added in the sanctuary and replaced the carpet that was there. In the main altar there are other statues besides the crucifix. They were added in the late 1990s to match the look of how the altar look before the original statues were removed. The original statues were removed in the late 1940s because the altar was leaning forward causing an angel at the top to lose its balance and fall nearly hitting Rev. Bernard C. Loeher (pastor 1947-1949) who was saying mass.They were taken to the basement and then removed from the basement in the 1970s. It is rumored the statues were taken to the city dump for disposal. For years the altar was empty until the late 1990s. The east entrance was also added in the 1980s when the church was being \\"touched up.\\" The original cost of the church including the large steeple and bells was about $40,000. In 2002 St. Michael's celebrated their 150th anniversary. A book was dedicated to the 150-year history of the church titled Partners in Faith: 150 Years of Saint Michael the Archangel Catholic Church written by Michael G. Roehrig.

He acquainted them of the existence of a state of war between Britain and France, and asked them if they would be willing to serve.

The spacecraft is not expected to fly before 2020. Spacecraft description Born out of the need to reduce the flights to the ISS from 2018 onward, it was designed as a radical departure from the Progress design. It would incorporate concepts and technologies developed from the Orel and Progress-MS projects. One critical characteristic would be a 370 days on-orbit design life, compared to the 210 days of the Progress and Soyuz. This would allow less ships to be launched per year while maintaining a full complement on the station. It would consist of a service module on the aft, an unpressurized propellant cluster of six tanks on the center, a pressurized module with docking adapter on the fore and a truss structure connecting all the parts. It would use the reaction control system of the Progress-MS and an orbital manoeuvring rocket engine already developed for another spacecraft. The new design would have a single deposit of propellant that could be used by the spacecraft or to refuel the space station.

The name is derived from the Catalan word for \\"establishments\\". History Establiments dates to the 16th century, although the area surrounding the district has been occupied for much longer. Prehistoric remains were found in the Son Bau√ß√† caves and Ca‚Äôn Mallol, as well as some talai√≤tic remains. During the period when much of Spain was under Muslim rule, approximately from the 700s-1400s AD, agriculture developed in the area. After the conquest of Mallorca by the Kingdom of Arag√≥n, the land was transferred to Nun√≥ San√ß. For centuries, the agrarian structure of the area was rooted in possessions of large estates. Establiments emerged from upland rustic parceling of these possessions.\\" The name Establiments comes from the word for \\"establishments\\" or possessions in Mallorquin, a dialect of Catalan. The first possessi√≥ parcelled was Son Gual which is now Establiments Vells, named El Rutl√≥. The refuge d'es Rutl√≥ was documented for the first time in 1584, with 14 parcels. In the 12th century began the parceling of d'es Muntant from the \\"possessi√≥\\" de Sarri√†, which eventually came to be known as Establiments Nous. In 1685 the vells had 69 parcels and the nous had 33. For several centuries Establiments was part of Esporles, but after a time, an independent municipality was formed. In the Cardenal Despuig map of 1785 the large \\"possessions\\" of Es Canyar, Son Cotoneret, Son Gual, Bunyol√≠ (documented around 1402), Sarri√†, Son Morl√†, Son Mallol i Son Berga appear, most as the property of families of nobility. In 1776 Son Berga Nou was built. Considered one of the most beautiful Majorquin \\"possessions\\" it was the property of the Safortesa family. In 1837, Establiments was separated from Esporles and became an independent municipality. In 1847, it had a population of 1460. 367 houses occupied an area of 22.55 km2 (8.707 mi¬≤). Throughout the 19th century the municipality's principal occupation was farming, and the principal crops were wheat, barley, almonds, olive oil, carob beans and legumes. During the 1870s, the principal \\"possessiones\\" were Sarri√† (426 ha), Bunyol√≠ (376 ha), Son Gual (195 ha), Son Morl√† (95 ha), and Es Canyar (84 ha). In the first half of the 20th century three tissue factories, a shoe factory and a mosaics factory were established. In 1910, Establiments was annexed by Palma de Mallorca and officially gained the category of neighborhood. Many of its original features were preserved, similar to the neighborhood of Son Espanyol. It is likely that the reason for its annexation was a combination of economic troubles and political squabbling between liberal and conservatives. In 1926, Establiments obtained an electric tram line whose trolley cars departed from Sant Miquel Sreet. This tram served until 1959 when it was replaced by a bus line. In 1933 Joan Colom's cement factory started the quarries exploitation, which caused a lot of problems. During the Spanish Civil War prominent figures such as the administrator of Socialist Youngsters Antoni Roca Llad√≥, and the esporlerist socialist and Establiments resident, Gabriel Calafell Serra, were imprisoned and executed. This caused some residents to seek refuge. A tourist boom in the 1950s decreased agriculture and many factories closed. An important collective of immigrants from the Peninsula arrived, which the native people called strangers (forasters in Catalan). Sarri√† \\"possessi√≥\\"  Boundaries  The district borders the municipalities of Esporles and Puigpu√±ent to the north and west, respectively. It borders the districts of Son Anglada and Secar de la Real to the south and the suburb of Son Espanyol to the east.

CEPI is focused on the World Health Organisation's (WHO) \\"blueprint priority diseases\\", which include: the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Nipah virus, the Lassa fever virus, and the Rift Valley fever virus, as well as the Chikungunya virus and the hypothetical, unknown pathogen \\"Disease X\\". CEPI investment also requires \\"equitable access\\" to the vaccines during outbreaks, although subsequent CEPI policy changes may have compromised this criteria. CEPI was conceived in 2015 and formally launched in 2017 at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. It was co-founded and co-funded with US$460 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, The Wellcome Trust, and a consortium of nations, being Norway, Japan, Germany; to which the European Union (2019) and Britain (2020) subsequently joined. CEPI is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. In 2017, Nature said, \\"It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats\\". In 2020, CEPI was identified by several media outlets as a \\"key player in the race to develop a vaccine\\" for coronavirus disease 2019. History =Founding= Jeremy Farrar, co-author of the concept of CEPI, and board member The concept for CEPI was outlined in a July 2015 paper in The New England Journal of Medicine, titled \\"Establishing a Global Vaccine- Development Fund\\", co-authored by British medical researcher Jeremy Farrar (a director of Wellcome Trust), American physician Stanley A. Plotkin (co- discoverer of the Rubella vaccine), and American expert in infectious diseases Adel Mahmoud (developer of the HPV vaccine and rotavirus vaccine). Their concept was further expanded at the 2016 WEF in Davos, where it was discussed as a solution to the problems encountered in developing and distributing a vaccine for the Western African Ebola virus epidemic. Co-founder and funder, Bill Gates said: \\"The market is not going to solve this problem because epidemics do not come along very often ‚Äî and when they do you are not allowed to charge some huge premium price for the tools involved\\". CEPI's creation was also supported and co-funded by the pharmaceutical industry including GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), with CEO Sir Andrew Witty explaining at the WEF, \\"It is super-disruptive when the red phone rings in our vaccine division because of a health emergency. People do not realise that there's no spare capacity in the world's vaccine production system today\\". CEPI was formally launched at the 2017 WEF in Davos, with an initial investment of US$460 million by a consortium that included the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany, The Wellcome Trust, and the Gates Foundation; India joined a short time afterwards. In a launch interview with the Financial Times (FT), Gates said that a key goal was to reduce the time to develop vaccines from 10 years to less than 12 months. The initial targets were the six EID viruses with known potential to cause major epidemics, being: MERS, Lassa fever, Nipah virus, Ebola, Marburg fever and Zika. The FT reported CEPI would \\"build the scientific and technological infrastructure for developing vaccines quickly against pathogens that emerge from nowhere to cause a global health crisis, such as Sars in 2002/03 and Zika in 2015/16\\", and fund research papers on the costs and process of vaccine development. Town & Country listed it as one of the top-10 newsworthy moments from the 2017 Davos. At launch, Norwegian physician John-Arne R√∏ttingen, who led the steering committee for Ebola vaccine trials, served as interim CEO, and CEPI was based at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo. In April 2017, Richard J. Hatchett, former director of the U.S. government's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), became the full-time CEO. Hatchett was also a member of the United States Homeland Security Council under George W. Bush, and the United States National Security Council, under Barack Obama. Also in April 2017, CEPI opened an additional office in London, and in October 2017, a further office was opened in Washington, D.C. =Funding= At its launch in 2017, CEPI announced five-year financial pledges from its founders that amounted to US$460 million and came from the sovereign governments of Japan (US$125 million), Norway (US$120 million), and Germany (US$10.6 million in 2017 alone, and which later became US$90 million), and from global foundations of the Gates Foundation (US$100 million), and the Wellcome Trust (US$100 million); India was finalising their financial commitment, which was made shortly afterward. A funding target of US$1 billion was set for the first 5 years of operation (i.e. by January 2022). The journal Nature said of the amount raised that: \\"It is by far the largest vaccine development initiative ever against viruses that are potential epidemic threats\\". As part of its funding structure, CEPI has used \\"vaccine bonds\\" to \\"frontload\\" multi-year sovereign funding pledges. In 2019, the International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm) issued NOK 600 million in vaccine bonds to front-load the commitment by Norway, through Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to CEPI. In March 2019, the European Commission granted access to CEPI into the EU's Horizon 2020 programme, and a longer-term financial funding programme. CEPI note presentations that the EU's financial commitment amounts to US$200 million, which when added to the seed amount (including the full German commitment), came to US$740 million. By February 2020, Bloomberg News reported that CEPI had raised a total of US$760 million with additional donations from the governments of Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the U.K. Bloomberg said that \\"CEPI solves what economists call a 'coordination problem'. It can help pair boutique research and development companies with big vaccine manufacturers, work with regulators to streamline approval processes and resolve patent disputes on the spot. Its scientific advisory committee has executives from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical, among others\\". In March 2020, the British government pledged ¬£210 million in funding to CEPI to specifically focus on a vaccine for the coronavirus; making Britain CEPI's largest individual donor. =Mission= The founding mission of CEPI was \\"equitable access\\" in pandemics: selling vaccines to developing nations at affordable prices. Affordable access to existing patented vaccines had long been a concern for the medical community, and concern mounted in the wake of the struggle to get access to vaccine in the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic. Averting a repetition of this crisis was the motivating factor behind founding CEPI. The struggle to get access to vaccine in the 2013-2016 Ebola epidemic was one of the factors motivating the creation of the CEPI Policy changes CEPI's original policy contained specific measures to prevent some of these market problems. All vaccine-manufacturing contracts would need initial approval by a public review board. The policy also stated that vaccine prices would be set at levels affordable to those needing vaccines and sustainable to the manufacturer. Trade secrets would not be funded by the CEPI. Companies had to share all research data developed with CEPI funds. While CEPI would, controversially, not retain and license the intellectual property developed with CEPI funds (allowing the groups awarded funding to own it), the CEPI retained \\"step-in\\" rights: the right to license and use intellectual property developed with CEPI funds for vaccine production, even if the company that had received the funding and taken ownership of the IP later withdrew from the agreement with CEPI. The original policy also required that funded parties pre-register any trials in a clinical trials registry, publish results within a year of study completion (except with compelling reason and permission of CEPI), publish results in open-access articles, and have mechanisms for securely sharing underlying data and results, including negative results, in a way that preserves trial volunteer privacy (see AllTrials for further information). Pharmaceutical corporations, including Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and Takeda, objected to the original policy, and these provisions were removed in December 2018, after the CEPI had obtained significant funding. The policy changes met with strong criticism, led by M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. CEPI was also criticized for not following its own policies on transparency, and for removing the requirement that CEPI's board review CEPI's contracts. The CEPI stated that its vaccines would continue to be affordable and available, and published an article discussing the changes, saying that the old policy \\"while reflective of the idealism that inspired the creation of CEPI, was felt by others not to be pragmatic or reflect the business realities confronted by vaccine developers\\". It said that several unnamed vaccine manufacturers had declared that they could not work with the CEPI under the original policy. It said that the policy change did not reflect a change in commitment to access, and CEPI would still retain the right to do research and development using intellectual property it had funded, if the old partner was unable to continue. It also said that the CEPI would retain the right to find a new manufacturer if the old manufacturer could not continue, provided the old manufacturer agrees to the transfer of the information and intellectual property to the new one. The New York Times said that CEPI had made a \\"failed effort to get large pharmaceutical firms to agree to be partners without insisting on substantial profits or proprietary rights to research that CEPI helped to finance and produce,\\" and had replaced specific implementation measures with lip service to its funding mission. Structure Richard J. Hatchett, CEO of CEPI from 2017 CEPI is incorporated under Norwegian law, and had the following governance structure as of March 2020: *Leadership. A full-time staff of 68 that runs the organisation on a day-to- day basis under the direction of a chief executive officer, Richard Hatchett. *Board. Twelve members, four from the Investors Council, and eight of which are \\"independent members representing competencies including industry, global health, science, resource mobilization, finance.\\" The board includes: Charlotte Watts, Cherry Gagandeep Kang, Jane Halton, Jeremy Farrar, and Peter Piot. *Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC). 24 voting members that provide \\"scientific support, advice, and guidance to the CEPI Board and Secretariat.\\" The SAC includes members such as Alash‚Äôle Abimiku, Christian Br√©chot, Delese Mimi Darko, Helen Rees, James Robinson (vice-chair), Kathleen Neuzil, , Peter Smith, Stanley Plotkin, Thomas Kariuki, and Yves L√©vy. In addition, five non- voting members of the SAC represent Johnson & Johnson, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Pfizer, and Sanofi Aventis; the final non-voting member being from the WHO. *Joint coordination group (JAG). The JAG is a \\"roundtable of independent institutions with an interest in seeing CEPI's vaccines successfully developed and deployed in an outbreak.\\" Members of the JAG included the WHO, GAVI, European Medicines Agency, Food and Drug Administration, M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, UNICEF, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, African Vaccine Regulatory Forum, National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, and The Wellcome Trust. *Investors Council (IC). The IC nominates four investor representatives to the board, and its approval is required for single investments over US$100 million. The IC included representatives from the governments of Norway, UK, Germany, Japan, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, Belgium, the EU, and the Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. Publications In October 2018, CEPI scientists estimated that the costs of developing at least one vaccine for each of the diseases that could escalate into global humanitarian crises was between US$2.8 billion and US$3.7 billion. In November 2019, CEPI discussed its target portfolio was on the WHO's \\"blueprint priority diseases\\", that included: MERS-CoV, Nipah virus, Lassa fever virus, and Rift Valley fever virus, as well as Chikungunya virus, and the WHO's Disease X. CEPI outlined its projects to update CEPI priorities for establishment of technical and regulatory pathways for vaccine development, develop sustainable manufacturing solutions for vaccine candidates nearing completion, and create investigatory stockpiles of its vaccine candidates for use in emergency situations. Investments =General development= *In December 2018, US$8.4 million to Imperial College in London, to fund the development of a \\"self-amplifying RNA vaccine platform\\" that CEPI said: \\"would enable a tailored vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens (including H1N1 influenza, rabies virus, and Marburg virus)\\". *In December 2018, US$10.6 million was given to the University of Queensland to fund the development of a \\"molecular clamp\\" vaccine platform, that CEPI described as a \\"transformative technology that enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens (including influenza virus, MERS-CoV, and respiratory syncytial virus)\\". *In February 2019, US$34 million was given to the German-based CureVac biopharmaceutical company, to fund the development of an \\"RNA Printer prototype\\", which CEPI described as being a \\"transportable, down-scaled, automated mRNA printing facility, that can produce rapidly, a supply of lipid-nanoparticle‚Äìformulated mRNA vaccine candidate that can target known pathogens (including Lassa fever, yellow fever, and rabies); and prepare for rapid response to unknown pathogens (i.e., Disease X)\\". =Specific vaccines= Lassa fever/MERS-CoV TEM of Lassa virions *In March 2018, US$37.5 million was given to Austrian-based Themis Bioscience to fund a vaccine against Lassa virus and MERS-CoV, using a measles vector technology. *In April 2018, US$56 million was given to U.S.-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals to fund a DNA-vaccine against Lassa virus and MERS-CoV. *In May 2018, US$54.9 million was given to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), to fund a vaccine against Lassa virus via replication- competent vesicular stomatitis viral vector technology. *In June 2018, US$35 million was given to U.S.-based Profectus Biosciences, to fund an attenuated \\"VesiculoVax\\" vaccine against Lassa virus. *In August 2018, US$36 million was given to German-based IDT Biologika, to fund a vaccine against MERS-CoV (only) using a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara viral vector technology. *In September 2018, US$19 million to Janssen Pharmaceutica and the University of Oxford, to fund a vaccine against Lassa and MERS-Cov using a simian adenoviral vaccine viral vector technology. Nipah virus *In May 2018, US$25 million was given to U.S.-based Profectus Biosciences, to make a recombinant protein subunit vaccine against Nipah virus. *In February 2019, US$31 million was given to the University of Tokyo, to develop a vaccine by inserting the Nipah-virus G gene (\\"Malaysia strain\\"), into a measles vector (\\"Edmonston B strain\\"). *In August 2019, US$43.6 million was given to Public Health Vaccines LLC, to fund the development and manufacture of a vaccine using a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus technology. SARS-CoV-2 SEM of SARS-CoV-2 *In January 2020, CEPI funded three teams working on a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, being: Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and the University of Queensland (UQ). By February 2020, Inovio announced that it had produced a pre-clinical DNA- based vaccination to fight COVID-19 at its lab in San Diego. Inovio collaborated with a Chinese firm to speed its acceptance by regulatory authorities in China for human trialing. The strategy of the UQ team is to develop a molecular clamp vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to make them mimic the coronavirus and stimulate an immune reaction. *In January 2020, CEPI announced a fourth SARS-CoV-2 project in a collaboration with their existing partner CureVac, to develop and manufacture a vaccine. CEPI's CEO, Richard J. Hachett said in an interview with the FT that CEPI expected to have human trials within 16 weeks, but cautioned \\"All these timelines are aggressive and aspirational. As circumstances unfold there may be opportunities to reduce the timing but it is critically important that any new vaccine is safe and effective\\". *In February 2020, Bloomberg News, citing virologists, identified CEPI as a \\"key player in the race to develop a vaccine\\"; a status other media outlets have attributed. In reviewing vaccine development on the virus Vox said: \\"CEPI is a large part of why there are already dozens of Covid-19 vaccine candidates making their way through animal and human trials, as well as platforms to develop more\\", while The Guardian said CEPI was \\"leading efforts to finance and coordinate Covid-19 vaccine development\\". *In March 2020, Hatchett gave an interview to Channel 4 News saying that \\"war is an appropriate analogy\\", for the steps needed to counter the virus, and that \\"this is the most frightening disease that I have ever encountered in my career, and that includes Ebola, it includes MERS, it includes SARS. And it's frightening because of the combination of infectiousness and a lethality that appears to be many-fold higher than flu\\". Hatchett told The Daily Telegraph that coronaviruses are the most serious threat to public health since the Spanish flu, and that a vaccine will take up to 18 months to deliver at a cost of ¬£1.5 billion. CEPI said that its funds for fighting the virus would be fully allocated by the end of March and that it was launching a new funding call for US$2 billion to support fighting the virus. *In March 2020, CEPI invested US$4.4 million in two more projects with Swedish vaccine laboratory Novavax, and with Oxford University, bringing its total investment in SARS-CoV-2 vaccine work to US$23.7 million, and announcing that it would invest up to US$100 million in further COVID-19 projects. Chikungunya virus *In June 2019, US$21 million was given to Themis Bioscience to fund phase 3 clinical trials and regulatory approval of a vaccine using measles viral vector technology. *In July 2019, US$23.4 million was given to Austrian-based biotech Valneva SE to fund manufacturing and late- stage clinical development of a single-dose, live-attenuated vaccine. Rift Valley fever *In July 2019, US$12.5 million was given to Dutch-based Wageningen University and Research for a single-dose vaccine candidate for Rift Valley fever that uses an attenuated virus technology, which included: vaccine manufacturing, preclinical research, and a phase 1 study. *In July 2019, US$9.5 million was given to Colorado State University for manufacturing and preclinical studies to assess another single-dose vaccine candidate against Rift Valley fever (also using an attenuated virus technology).

The song was written by Noyes and Norwegian songwriter William Wiik Larsen and produced by the duo as well. Musically, \\"In My Mind\\" is a harmonic, retro-pop song which makes use of electric guitar and drum instrumentation. The vocals are backed by mildly synthesized beats. The song has charted in Sweden, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. An accompanying music video was released to Noyes's Vevo account on September 7, 2016, ahead of the EP's release. It features Noyes having mixed feelings about a lover in a bedroom, and singing the song while contemplating what to do. The video also features a flower theme: Noyes can be seen singing in a bed of flowers and in a bathtub surrounded by flowers that appear to be Rhododendrons. The video has achieved over 6 million views on YouTube/Vevo. Background & composition The song was written by Noyes and William Wiik Larsen and produced by the duo as well. The song utilizes G, E minor, C, and D chords. Lyrically, Maty Noyes told Fader in an email that the song is about a situation where she was too in love to walk away, \\"Love makes people do and say crazy things. Sometimes you need to escape to a place within to gain perspective and remind yourself that the relationship is worth it, even when it doesn‚Äôt feel that way in the moment. ‚ÄúIn My Mind‚Äù talks about this need for clarity ‚Äì the need for a mental escape.\\" Critical response In an interview with Noyes, writer James Wood of AXS commented, \\"It's a track that combines tasty elements of classic orchestration with 21st-century groove.\\" Calvin Paradise, a writer for BitCandy, wrote a positive review of the track: \\"At the risk of over- exaggerating, ‚ÄúIn My Mind‚Äù is a perfect slice of pop. Co-written with Norwegian songwriter William Wiik Larsen (whom no one has heard of), the track feels [instantly] familiar, like it‚Äôs already been on loop in your brain for days.\\" Mike Wass, a writer for Idolator, wrote of the song, \\"The 18-year-old returns today with ‚ÄúIn My Mind‚Äù ‚Äî a brooding mid-tempo pop song with intricate production and a deceptively catchy chorus. You‚Äôll be hooked after the second listen!\\" Chart performance \\"In My Mind\\" has gained some traction in Europe, peaking at number 46 in the Czech Republic, 51 in Slovakia, and reaching number 72 on the Sweden Sverigetopplistan singles chart. Music video The music video for \\"In My Mind\\" was uploaded to Noyes's Vevo account on September 7, 2016. The video was directed by Dano Cerny and produced by Lauren Solie. It features Noyes and her lover contemplating the complications of their relationship in a bedroom with dim lighting. Noyes is also watching a TV, which depicts dizzying images of flowers. As Noyes sings the song, there are intercut scenes of Noyes singing and posing on the bed, in a bed of flowers, and in a field of grass while wearing a blue dress. In the second verse of the song, she is seen in a bathtub surrounded by flowers, wearing a black bra. Later in the video, Noyes is watching her lover chase her through a field on the TV.

He was best known for wrestling extensively during the 1970s and 1980s for the American Wrestling Association, and for the National Wrestling Alliance territories.  Early career  Stamp, who grew up in Brainerd, Minnesota, won the 1965 Minnesota State High School Wrestling Championship for the 175 pound weight class. After entering professional wrestling and having his first match on August 9, 1971, in Thunder Bay Ontario, he would join Verne Gagne's AWA where he became their 1971 Rookie of the Year. Shortly thereafter, he joined Leroy McGuirk's Tri- State territory, and in 1973 he and Bull Bullinski won the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship. After losing the titles seven days later, he would regain the titles (with a new partner, Dewey Robertson) in May of that year. In 1974, Stamp had moved to the NWA's Los Angeles territory, where he was a two-time Television Champion, first defeating Man Mountain Mike and then Greg Valentine. By the fall of 1975, he had joined Vancouver's All Star Wrestling, and with Tiger Jeet Singh won the Canadian Tag Team Championship. By 1976, he had joined the NWA's Western States promotion operated by Dory Funk and his sons Dory Jr. and Terry. There, wrestling primarily as a heel, he would become a two-time Western States Tag Team Champion, and four-time Brass Knuckles champion. Stamp appeared with several other professional wrestlers, including Ted DiBiase, Bob Roop, Dick Murdoch, Gene Kiniski, and Tonga Fifita, in the 1978 Sylvester Stallone movie Paradise Alley.  Later career  Beginning in the 1980s, Stamp began hiring out as an enhancement talent, for which work he would later receive praise from fellow wrestler Manny Fernandez. He also appeared occasionally in the WWF in the mid 1980s, including a December 1986 match shown on the TV program WWF Wrestling Challenge where he teamed with fellow jobber Mike Luca against the Fabulous Rougeau Brothers. He later returned to the AWA, which was in decline at the time due to heavy competition from the WWF and World Championship Wrestling. He was used primarily by the AWA to put over major stars and veterans, like Superfly Jimmy Snuka, Colonel DeBeers, Jerry Lawler, and The Midnight Rockers. Throughout his career, Stamp wrestled about 2,000 matches.  Life after wrestling  When his wrestling career declined, he began working at a pest control company, where he remained for over 30 years. In 2011, he was diagnosed with Stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which he beat. In 2014, Stamp published a book about his wrestling days titled The Stamp Collection: A Collection of Short Stories from the World's Most Famous Unknown Wrestler. That year he also refereed a main event for Scottish Wrestling Entertainment. In 2016, Stamp announced that his cancer had returned. He died of lymphoma on March 13, 2017 after which wrestlers including Ted DiBiase and Tommy Dreamer paid tribute to him on social media. In November of 2017, Stamp was posthumously inducted into the Amarillo Pioneer Hall of Fame by the local Amarillo Pioneer newspaper.  Beyond the Mat appearance  Stamp attained a measure of cult popularity after appearing in the 1999 documentary Beyond the Mat. The film's footage of him was from 1997, when he was the referee for one of Terry Funk's many \\"retirement\\" matches (this one against Bret Hart). In the film, Stamp said that he did not wrestle as much anymore because he had not been booked for matches, but had kept in shape in case he received a call. His training ritual involved holding arm weights and jumping up and down on a trampoline in his backyard in his underwear. His repeated use of the phrases \\"I'm not booked!\\" while discussing his referee job with Funk, and \\"I don‚Äôt do tricks. I just jump.\\" while working out, resulted in popular memes.

Despite only moderately favorable conditions, the storm quickly intensified while moving north and became a hurricane roughly a day after being designated. Attaining peak intensity early on September 6, Newton then proceeded to make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula shortly afterwards. It quickly weakened and degenerated into a remnant low on September 7, before dissipating the next day. Ahead of the storm, several preparations were made to avoid a calamity similar to what Odile had caused two years prior. The hurricane was responsible for at least nine deaths, mainly attributed to flooding; and US$95.7 million in damages.  Meteorological history  The origins of Newton can be traced to a tropical wave that crossed the west coast of Africa on August 25, 2016. Though the wave initially had some deep convection, the showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave decreased significantly after it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean. The wave moved quickly across the tropical Atlantic, reaching the Lesser Antilles four days later and Central America on September 1. The wave moved into the vicinity of a surface trough south of the coast of Mexico on September 3. A low pressure area developed within the wave early on September 4, and associated deep convection became sufficiently organised for the system to be classified as a tropical depression at 1200 UTC that day. Operationally, the NHC did not classify the system as a tropical depression until nine hours later. Preparations Upon the formation of Newton, the government of Mexico issued a hurricane watch for the western side of Baja California Sur. Upon being named, the hurricane watch was upgraded into a hurricane warning, while a tropical storm warning was briefly issued for Cabo Corrientes. By the afternoon of September 5, tropical storm warnings and watches were issued for much of Sonora and Sinaloa. During the afternoon of September 5, authorities issued a \\"yellow\\" alert in southern Jalisco, \\"green\\" alert for the state of Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, northern and central Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, and Michoacan. A blue alert was declared in Guerrero and Baja California. Classes were suspended in Colima, in three municipalities in northern Jalisco, in Baja California Sur, and in Mazaltan. A total of 800 military personnel was deployed, and a plan to designate all tourists in the Baja California Peninsula. A total of 56 shelters were opened across the peninsula, with a net capacity of 16,000; however, only 1,500 used these shelters. Impact Newton near hurricane status and approaching Baja California on September 5 The outer rainbands of Hurricane Newton brought heavy rains to Guerrero and Chiapas that resulted in flooding. Across Chiapas, three people were killed and two others were reported missing. In the capital city of Tuxtla, almost 900 homes were damaged and six were demolished, leaving 3,500 displaced. In Guerrero, a total of 695 homes were flooded and 12 communities were isolated. Due to the flooding, officials evacuated about 150 people in seven shelters. In Petatlan, two people were swept away in a river, one of whom was found alive, but the other one was found dead. Seventy homes were damaged and 200 people were trapped in the resort town of Acapulco, prompting air evacuations via police, marines and the army. Further north, severe flooding was reported in Colima and Jalisco. Two rivers overflowed, resulting in several communities being isolated. The communities of El Sentinel and El Rebalse were the worst affected by the storm. Several people sought shelter in schools and other public spaces. Statewide, 20 families were evacuated because of flooding. While damage near the landfall location was minor, the hurricane's heavy rains deluged the municipality of Mulege. There, power and drinking water access was lost. In the municipality's seat of Santa Rosalia, dozens of houses and vehicles were buried in rocks and debris. Nearby, the communities of San Ignacio and Herocina Mulege were cut off from the outside world due to damage to the Mexican Federal Highway 1. Offshore, in the Gulf of California, a shrimp boat capsized due to rough seas, resulting in five people being swept away. Two dead bodies were later found ashore while the other three were briefly missing. before being reported dead on September 8. Damage across Baja California Sur reached 700 million pesos (US$37 million). Guaymas suffered extensive impacts from the hurricane, with more than 3,000 homes damaged. Total losses in the municipality reached 1.1 billion pesos (US$58 million). The remnants of Newton brought heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States, peaking at at Miller Carr Canyon in southeastern Arizona. Precipitation reached near Texico, New Mexico, the highest in that state. Losses in Kansas were at US$752,100. Aftermath Due to the flooding in Guerrero, 817 troops, 25 radio stations, 24 first aid kits, and 124 automobiles were displaced for cleanup. Following Hurricane Odile in 2014, where extensive post-storm looting was reported, officials guarded numerous shops in the southern portion of the Peninsula to prevent such looting. However, police noted that five people were arrested for trying to loot two convenience stores in Los Cabos.

Tue legislation is part of the Scottish Government's Getting it right for every child policy implementation. The scope of the act as described in its long title is to make provision: *about the rights of children and young people; *about investigations by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland; *about the provision of services and support for or in relation to children and young people: *for and about an adoption register; *about children‚Äôs hearings, detention in secure accommodation and consultation on certain proposals in relation to schools. In the course of legal proceedings on the part of The Christian Institute and others who were concerned with information privacy law, and who challenged provisions of the act, the judgments of the Court of Session in Edinburgh and, on appeal, of the Supreme Court in Westminster referred to the Data Protection Act 1998, the EU Data Protection Directive, and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Session upheld the provisions of the act, but was overruled by the Supreme Court's decision that the provisions were defective and were not in the Parliament's legislative competence, and therefore could not be brought into force. Key provisions The key provisions of the Act include: * The introduction of specific and continuing duties on the Scottish Ministers for maintaining and improving Scotland's compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. * Certain public bodies such as local authorities, health boards and the police (among others) must report every three years on what action they have taken to promote the rights of children and young people. * The creation of a new Complaints and Investigation Service to support the work of the Commissioner for Children and Young People. * The institution of a 'named person service', for which an individual is to be identified and made available in respect of every child in Scotland until they reach age 18. * Provides public funding for free school meals for school pupils in P1-3. A government document published in June 2014 described the Scottish Government‚Äôs overarching plans for implementing the Act and stated that the named person provisions in Part 4 were then currently focused on developing guidance in relation to the \\"GIRFEC\\" approach.Implementation of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, published in June 2014. Legal challenge The Act has generated controversy, and in The Christian Institute and others (Appellants) v The Lord Advocate ([2016] UKSC 51), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that certain data sharing provisions of the Act were in breach of the right to respect for private and family life prescribed in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, meaning the Scottish Parliament must amend the Act in order for it to become law. The Scottish Conservatives and Scottish Liberal Democrats have called for the Act to be repealed and Scottish Labour, whilst initially supportive of the Act, have called for a 'pause'. A Survation poll has found that 64% of Scottish adults are opposed to the Named Person provisions of the Act.http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14539070.Poll64of_Scots_say_named_person_policy_is_anunacceptable_intrusion_/ The appeal to the Supreme Court was from the Opinion of the Inner House of the Court of Session (delivered 3 September 2015) on a reclaiming motion ([2015] CSIH 64) between seven parties as petitioners and reclaimers, namely, The Christian Institute, Family Education Trust, The Young Me Sufferers (\\"TYMES\\"), Christian Action Research and Education (\\"CARE\\") (four registered charities with an interest in family matters), and three individual parents, against The Scottish Ministers as respondent. The Inner House refused an appeal from Lord Pentland's decision, as Lord Ordinary. Lord Pentland had refused a petition for judicial review (lodged 11 July 2014), holding that the named person service provisions in Part 4 of the 2014 Act were within the devolved competence of the Scottish Parliament and did not contravene fundamental common law rights, or the European Convention, or the EU law on data protection.The Christian Institute and Others -v- The Scottish Ministers, website of the Judiciary in Scotland The Opinion of the Inner House, which the Supreme Court's judgment overruled, was that the legislation was in accordance with the law, had a legitimate aim and was necessary in a democratic society in the interests of, amongst other things, public safety, the prevention of crime, the protection of health or morals or of the rights of others. The Inner House's Opinion was based on observing that the legislation was intended to provide for every child a suitably qualified professional able, if necessary, to act as a single point of contact with any public service from which the child could benefit, and that this would have no effect whatsoever on the legal, moral or social relationships within the family, and, further, that the legislation did not involve the state taking over any functions currently carried out by parents in relation to their children, and would not permit any interference with a parent‚Äôs or child‚Äôs right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, nor bear upon a child‚Äôs right to education or his parent‚Äôs right to bring up a child according to his conscience and religion. =Possible remedy under Scotland Act 1998= The proceedings and judgments were mainly concerned with provisions in Part 4 of the Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014, including ten sections that had not then been brought into force under section 102, namely, *s.20 Named person service in relation to pre-school child. *s.21 Named person service in relation to children not falling within section 20. *s.22 Continuation of named person service in relation to certain young people. *s.23 Communication in relation to movement of children and young people. *s.24 Duty to communicate information about role of named persons. *s.25 Duty to help named person. *s.26 Information sharing. *s.27 Disclosure of information. *s.28 Guidance in relation to named person service. *s.29 Directions in relation to named person service. When allowing the appeal, the Supreme Court, following the precedent of its ruling in Salvesen v Riddell ([2013] UKSC 22),Salvesen v Riddell, para.58 invited the parties to produce, within the period of 42 days from 28 July (expiring in early September), written submissions on the terms of an order that the Court could make under 102(2)(b) of the Scotland Act 1998 to allow the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Ministers an opportunity to correct the defects which the Court had identified, but the Court stated that in the meantime, since the defective provisions were not within the legislative competence of the Parliament, they could not be brought into force.Supreme Court judgment, paragraphs 109 to 110 =Government's September announcement= The Scottish Government announced on 8 September a process involving the offices of the Children's Commissioner and the Information Commissioner in order to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court, including development of a code of practice to set out how information should be shared under the legislation, with the intention of working towards a commencement date for the legislation of August 2017.

An ethnic Armenian, Aziz al-Dawla started his political career as a trusted ghulam (military slave) of Manjutakin al-Azizi, the Fatimid governor of Damascus during the reign of Caliph al-Hakim (996‚Äì1021). The latter appointed Aziz al-Dawla governor of Aleppo, which experienced prosperity during his rule. By 1020, Aziz al-Dawla was acting independently of al-Hakim's authority by issuing coins in his name and having his political sovereignty declared in Friday prayers. When al-Hakim sent an army to force Aziz al-Dawla into submission, the latter appealed for Byzantine support but canceled the appeal when al-Hakim mysteriously disappeared in early 1021. Afterward, the Fatimid court attempted to reconcile with Aziz al-Dawla, who nonetheless moved to secure his rule by building a well-fortified palace at the foot of the Aleppo's citadel. In July 1022, Aziz al-Dawla was murdered in his sleep by one of his ghulams (slave soldier) in a plot devised by another of his ghulams, Abu'l-Najm Badr, with likely backing from al-Hakim's virtual successor, Sitt al-Mulk. Badr briefly succeeded Aziz al-Dawla as governor but was arrested three months later.  Early career  Aziz al-Dawla was an ethnic Armenian and a ghulam (military slave) of Manjutakin al-Azizi, the Fatimid governor of Damascus, during the reign of Caliph al-Hakim (r. 996‚Äì1021).Dadoyan 1997, p. 108. The 12th-century historian Ibn al-Adim wrote that Manjutakin highly favored Aziz al-Dawla and described him as wise, courageous and generous. Aziz al-Dawla was a Muslim, and the 15th-century historian al-Maqrizi described Aziz al-Dawla as \\"intelligent and pious\\".  Governor of Aleppo  = Appointment by al-Hakim = In 1016, the governor of Aleppo, Mansur ibn Lu'lu' fled the city amid a revolt led by his commander of the citadel, Fath al-Qal'i, with support from the local Banu Kilab led by Salih ibn Mirdas.Zakkar 1971, p. 56. The latter coveted control of Aleppo, while the Fatimids, who controlled the central and southern parts of Syria, saw an opportunity to extend their rule to the city and northern Syria.Zakkar 1971, p. 58. Fatimid troops from Afamiyah led by Ali ibn al-Dayf had been invited to help Fath maintain control of the city,Zakkar 1971, p. 57. but as the unrest continued, al-Dayf called for reinforcements.Zakkar 1971, p. 59. Afterward, al-Hakim dispatched troops from Sidon and Tripoli and compelled Fath to leave Aleppo and take up the governorship of Tyre; Fath had preferred ruling jointly with Salih, but the people of Aleppo rejected Bedouin rule and preferred a Fatimid administration. In October 1016, al-Hakim appointed Aziz al-Dawla to replace Fath, making Aziz al-Dawla the first Fatimid-appointed governor of Aleppo and Jund Qinnasrin (province of Aleppo).Dadoyan 2013, p. 78. Al-Hakim concurrently bestowed upon him a robe of honor, a sword and gold- plated saddle. Aziz al-Dawla entered Aleppo on 3 February 1017. Early in his rule, in 1018, Aziz al-Dawla persuaded Salih to have his mother, Rabab, reside in Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 60. The move was meant to solidify his friendship with Salih and the Banu Kilab, and to demonstrate to Aleppo's inhabitants, who constantly lived in threat of a Byzantine invasion, that he was establishing a military alliance with the powerful Bedouin tribe against the Byzantines. Nothing else is known about the interactions between Aziz al-Dawla and Salih, but historian Suhayl Zakkar, presumes that Salih must have been satisfied with Aziz al-Dawla's rule. = Moves toward independence = Aziz al-Dawla was an ambitious governor and established Aleppo as an autonomous entity in between the Fatimid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, two traditional enemies.Dadoyan 2013, p. 79. Upon assuming the governorship, Aziz al-Dawla convinced Fatimid troops in the city that with their assignment being completed they should withdraw to their garrisons in Sidon, Tripoli and Afamiyah. He later dismissed Fatimid officials from the city and provincial posts. To publicly demonstrate his sovereignty, he issued his own coins omitting the name of al-Hakim and had his own name read by the city's mosques in the khutba (Friday prayer). Moreover, he had his honorary name, Al-Sayyid Amir al-Umara Aziz al-Dawla inscribed on the city's Antioch Gate and in silver chandeliers in the Great Mosque of Aleppo. The date of Aziz al-Dawla's formal acts of sovereignty was not recorded by contemporary sources, but Zakkar presumes they likely occurred in 1020. That year, al-Hakim launched an expedition to reassert direct Fatimid rule over Aleppo, prompting Aziz al- Dawla to request military assistance from the Byzantine emperor, Basil II (976‚Äì1025). Al-Hakim mysteriously disappeared in February 1021 and when news of this reached Aziz al-Dawla, he canceled his deal with Basil II, whose army had reached the vicinity of Ayn Tab, and gained the backing of the Banu Kilab to counter the Byzantines. Basil II consequently withdrew.Zakkar 1971, p. 61. The succession of al-Hakim's young son az-Zahir as caliph boosted Aziz al- Dawla's confidence, and the Fatimid court, which was effectively controlled by al-Hakim's sister, Sitt al-Mulk, sent him numerous gifts and robes of honor to reconcile with him. Nonetheless, Aziz al-Dawla sought to secure his virtual independence and built a well-fortified palace and bathhouse at the foot of the Aleppo's citadel. Furthermore, he recruited several ghulams into his service and bodyguard. The ghulams resided in the citadel and their commander was Abu'l-Najm Badr, a Turk who also served as governor of the citadel. = Assassination = Badr, with Sitt al-Mulk's secret encouragement, plotted to assassinate Aziz al-Dawla.Zakkar 1971, p. 62. The plot, according to medieval Muslim chroniclers, was initiated by Sitt al-Mulk and the Fatimid court. Aziz al-Dawla was apparently unaware of communications between Badr and Sitt al- Mulk; Zakkar presumes that the when Sitt al-Mulk dispatched envoys carrying gifts for Aziz al-Dawla, she also sent them with messages to Badr promising him Aziz al-Dawla's post should he betray his master. Badr manipulated another ghulam of Aziz al-Dawla named Tuzun, who was of Indian origin, to commit the murder by warning him that Aziz al-Dawla attempted to have Tuzun killed on several occasions, but these were all averted by Badr's intervention; Badr convinced Tuzun that he should kill Aziz al-Dawla to save his own life. In truth, Aziz al-Dawla deeply loved Tuzun. On 6 July 1022, Aziz al-Dawla had gone hunting while Badr and Tuzun plotted his murder.Zakkar 1971, pp. 62‚Äì63. Upon his return to the palace, Aziz al-Dawla bathed, ate, became drunk then went to bed.Zakkar 1971, p. 63. While Aziz al-Dawla was sleeping, Tuzun decapitated him with his sword in one blow. Badr witnessed the slaying and then immediately turned on Tuzun by raising a cry that awoke the other ghulams, who then killed Tuzun. Zakkar explains that the aforementioned story is the only narrative describing Aziz al-Dawla's murder and that \\"it is difficult to accept it at face value\\". He also finds Sitt al-Mulk's alleged participation in the plot to be \\"questionable\\". In any case, Badr reported Aziz al-Dawla's murder to the Fatimid court, which publicly mourned Aziz al- Dawla, but was secretly satisfied with his death. Badr was appointed as Aziz al-Dawla's successor, but he governed for a little over three months before al-Dayf was sent to arrest him.Zakkar 1971, pp. 63‚Äì64. He was thereafter replaced by separate governors for the city and citadel of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 64. By 1025, Salih and the Banu Kilab evicted the Fatimid governors and established Mirdasid rule over the city.  Culture  Aziz al-Dawla was a cultured ruler with a particular affection for poetry, literature and philosophy. He wrote poetry himself. The local and well-known poet al-Ma'arri had friendly relations with Aziz al-Dawla and dedicated two of his works to him:Dadoyan 2013, p. 78.

In 1854, he decorated the tribune of the church of San Regolo in Montaione, depicting the Virgin in Glory with Saints Regolo and Bartholemew. In 1855, he completed frescoes for the sacristy of the church of Santa Caterina, Livorno. In 1858, he also painted for the Chapel of Larderel in the church of San Matteo in Livorno. Luigi Ademollo commissioned from Maffei the frescoes for the cupola in Santa Caterina, followed by a collaboration with Pietro Calamai, to paint images of the four evangelists, scenes from the life of the Virgin, and St Dominic receives the Rosary. This work was completed in 1876. Bibliography *AA.VV., La pittura in Italia. L'Ottocento, Milano 1991. *A.M.

Specialising in runway designers, the company offers the work of labels including Saint Laurent, Givenchy, C√©line, Stella McCartney and Christian Louboutin. Cricket is revered as one of Vogue's best independent stores outside of London. On Tuesday 17 September 2019, Cricket moved location into Liverpool‚Äôs Metquarter. History Originally starting in 1991 as a menswear boutique in Cavern Walks on Liverpool‚Äôs famous Mathew Street by Gerard Mannix and Justine Mills, Cricket moved into exclusive high-end ladies fashion in 1999. Cricket was one of the first and very few independent retailers to stock Christian Louboutin shoes and accessories and was chosen alongside Harrods and Harvey Nichols to celebrate Louboutin‚Äôs 20th anniversary limited edition collection in 2012. Co-founder and buyer, Justine Mills, is considered a respected fashion industry expert and businesswoman, recognised by the British Fashion Council as one of their representatives and part of their selection committee. British designer, Matthew Williamson, hosted Cricket's Celebration Of Style event across Liverpool city centre in November 2014 in association with Matalan. Cricket was named as one of The 50 Best Boutiques in Britain by The Daily Telegraph in 2019, published by Sunday supplement, Stella Magazine. New Store Cricket confirmed speculation that they were moving location in December 2018 with the unveiling of huge hoardings across the front of Liverpool city centre‚Äôs celebrated shopping centre, the Metquarter. WAGs In 2005, The Guardian dubbed Cricket Fashion \\"an unofficial footballers' wives' headquarters\\" with paparazzi regularly camping outside the shop in a bid to see which WAGs of footballers from Liverpool, Everton and Manchester United were shopping there. Regulars include Coleen Rooney, Alex Curran (wife of Steven Gerrard), ex-Emmerdale actress Sheree Murphy and Abbey Clancy (wife of Peter Crouch). Famously, Coleen Rooney was first photographed by the press in 2003 as the then girlfriend of Wayne Rooney; she was 16 years old and in her school uniform carrying a Cricket Fashion carrier bag.

In 1957, construction began on a new library building on Electric Boulevard, and the library reopened at its current location on August 11, 1958. Several notable expansion projects have been undertaken, including a 1980-1983 project that doubled the size of the library, and a 1990-1994 project that again expanded it to its current space of 55,000 square feet. In 2014, the Board of Library Trustees approved a $700,000 renovation of the 1994 addition. The renovation was completed by April 2015, and was celebrated with a reception and open house event. In 2011, the Library celebrated its 80th anniversary with a commendation from the Ohio House of Representatives and a proclamation from the city of Avon Lake.

As a player, he served EVV Eindhoven (now known as FC Eindhoven) and FC VVV (now known as VVV-Venlo). As a manager, he has coached VVV, the Netherlands women's national football team and several other representative teams of the Royal Dutch Football Association.  Playing career  Reynierse was born in Rhenen and started playing football as an attacking midfielder with Eerste Divisie club EVV Eindhoven in 1979. After making 124 league appearances, he moved to fellow Eerste Divisie side FC VVV in 1984. During the 1984‚Äì85 season, he helped the club achieve promotion to the Eredivisie. Reynierse saw VVV avoid relegation during the 1985‚Äì86 season, and they subsequently accomplished two consecutive fifth-place finishes during the 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88 seasons. During this time, he played alongside future Dutch international Stan Valckx. However, they were relegated at the end of the 1988‚Äì89 season. After one more Eerste Divisie season, Reynierse retired from professional football in 1990, having made 188 league appearances for VVV and 312 in total.  Managerial career  In 1986, Reynierse started his managerial career with VVV, even before he had retired as a player. After his retirement, he became head of academy. In 1994, he became head coach at the request of the board, who were looking to replace outgoing manager Frans K√∂rver. After one season, he returned to his former post as head of the academy. In 1998, he moved to PSV Eindhoven to fulfill the same role, which he eventually did for three years. In 2001, Reynierse signed with the Royal Dutch Football Association, where he would become the manager of several national youth teams. In 2004, he coached the Netherlands women's national football team on an interim basis for a total of four games. As assistant of Netherlands national under-21 football team head coach Foppe de Haan, Reynierse helped Jong Oranje to win the 2006 and 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championships and to reach the quarter-finals at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Aside from managing national youth teams, Reynierse also worked as youth scout and as developer of the youth academies of Dutch professional football clubs. On 1 June 2016, VfB Stuttgart announced that Reynierse and Olaf Jan√üen would become the assistants of new head coach Jos Luhukay, starting from 1 July.

It was founded by Maureen Kelly in 1999; her first product was a cheek stain that was used the following year for the cover of Self magazine. Also in 2000, Tarte Cosmetics debuted its first order at Henri Bendel. In 2003, Tarte products were being stocked by Sephora and in 2005 at QVC. By 2010, the company's products were being sold by Ulta Beauty. Tarte products are sold in U.S. department stores, including Macy's and Beauty Brands, and in Sephora stores internationally.  History  Tarte Cosmetics was founded by Maureen Kelly. She was pursuing a PhD in psychology at Columbia University when she decided to pursue her interest in cosmetics because she could not find effective makeup she liked; she wanted natural makeup that gave a glamorous look. Kelly started the company with the support of her first husband. Kelly began to research cosmetics and worked out of her apartment until her cheek stain was developed. The cheek stain caught the attention of beauty writers a week after launching in Henri Bendel. Kelly spent much of the first two years delivering sample products to the mail rooms of magazine publishers, hoping they would invite her back. As sales continued, Tarte launched in Sephora in 2003 and two years later on QVC. In March 2014, a 93.5 percent stake in Tarte Cosmetics was acquired for $135 million by Japanese company Kos√© Corporation, which wanted to expand into North America. In June 2018, Tarte announced the revival of its sister brand, Awake, which produces a line of cruelty-free skincare products.  Ingredients  Maureen Kelly has stated that she wanted makeup that uses natural ingredients, including Amazonian clay, goji berry extract, passionfruit and vitamins A, C, and E. Tarte Cosmetics does not use parabens, mineral oil, synthetic fragrances or gluten in their products. Parabens are excluded because they are known to disrupt hormones. Mineral oil is also not included because it clogs pores and can be contaminated with toxins. Synthetic fragrances are avoided due to the risk of allergic reactions. Gluten is not included because if it is accidentally consumed, it will cause a reaction. ref> Tarte is a cruelty-free makeup brand. They do not test on animals or sell products where animal testing is legal. Tarte is certified by PETA. Tarte is not 100% vegan, but some of their individual products contain only vegan ingredients.  Philanthropy  Maureen Kelly partnered with Sustainable Amazon Partnership, which encouraged forest stewardship, created new jobs, boosted living conditions, and offered educational opportunities. On 28 August 2017, Tarte announced the company's support of an anti-cyberbullying campaign with the Tyler Clementi Foundation. Tarte asked consumers to take a self-portrait and upload it to Instagram with a hashtag #kissandmakeup. For each self-portrait uploaded, a donation was made to the foundation and one poster received a lifetime supply of Tarte Cosmetics.

Biography P√°l Harrer was born into a poor farming family of Swabian origin as the son of P√°l Harrer Sr. and Katalin Thaller. His mother tongue was the German language. Due to a congenital disorder affecting his left hand, Harrer chose an administrative career after finishing his secondary studies in Esztergom and Buda. Because of his family's financial situation, he was unable to start his studies in higher education. He entered civil service in 1848, working as a clerk at the √ìbuda local government. He was appointed notary of √ìbuda on 1 January 1850, when the town was administratively attached to Buda. In 1872, √ìbuda received the status of \\"town with settled council\\" (or borough) from King Francis Joseph. Harrer was elected the first mayor of the town on 10 November 1872. He held the position until the election of the first Mayor of Budapest, K√°roly Kamermayer, on 4 November 1873. Harrer actively supported the merger process. After the unification, Harrer functioned as prefect of √ìbuda (3rd district or prefecture of Budapest, today called √ìbuda-B√©k√°smegyer) until his retirement in 1886. His son was the jurist and MP Ferenc Harrer, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1919, and was a key promoter of the establishment of Greater Budapest. Harrer's life-size bronze statue sculpted by L√°szl√≥ Kutas was unveiled on 5 March 2010 in √ìbuda, next to the town hall. A local secondary grammar school is also named after him.

It is located on the east side of the second floor rotunda. On the north wall it depicts abolitionist Kansan John Brown with a Bible in one hand, on which the Greek letters alpha and omega of Apocalypse 1:8 can be seen. In his other hand he holds a rifle or \\"Beecher's Bible\\". He is in front of Union and Confederate soldiers, living and dead, with a whirlwind and a prairie fire approaching. Emigrants with covered wagons travel from east to west. The \\"tragic prelude\\" is the Bleeding Kansas period of 1854‚Äì1860, prelude to or dress rehearsal for the Civil War, which period John Brown was at the center of, preventing Kansas from being made a slave state. The term \\"tragic prelude\\" for this period of Kansas history is attributed by Curry to his champion, the newspaper editor William Allen White However, the mural has other figures in addition to Brown, as it turns a corner and continues on another wall, making it difficult to photograph in its entirety. The three figures are rarely discussed as part of the work. Chronologically from right to left are the Franciscan missionary Fray Juan de Padilla and the conquistador Coronado, the first Europeans to visit the land that became Kansas, followed by a plainsman, who has just killed a buffalo. It is by far Curry's most famous work, the only work of his to have a book devoted to it. History Emporia Gazette editor William Allen White began the campaign to get Curry to paint murals for his native Kansas rather than Wisconsin (whose university offered him employment he could not find in Kansas). Other newspapers joined in, and the result was the Kansas Murals Commission. Chaired by Governor Walter Huxman, it was charged with choosing a Kansas artist or artists to create murals for the Capitol, as Missouri artist Thomas Hart Benton had done in the Missouri State Capitol. Benton's very large mural was on the topic of, and titled, A Social History of Missouri. The Commission decided, not without some controversy, that in contrast with the Missouri Capitol, where Benton was one of several artists, Curry would be the sole artist to create murals for the Kansas Capitol, on the theme of Kansas history. No state money was involved; White led a fundraising campaign that easily succeeded in raising the money to hire Curry. Tragic Prelude was completed in 1937, using egg tempera and oil paint. It is 11 feet 4 inches (350 cm) tall, and 31 feet (940 cm) long. Curry's description Kansas Governor Sam Brownback (left) and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, 2012 In a newspaper interview of 1939, he explained that \\"I wanted to paint him as a fanatic, for John Brown was a fanatic. He had the wild zeal of the extremist, the fanatic for his cause‚Äîand we had the Civil War, with its untold misery.\\" Later, he wrote in a letter: \\"I think he is the prototype of a great many Kansans. Someone described a Kansan as one who went about wreaking good on humanity. This might be the kernel of my conception.\\" Rejection of Tragic Prelude The Kansas Legislature rejected the mural, and refused to hang it in the Capitol as planned. Curry left Kansas in disgust, abandoning the rest of his Capitol project, and did not sign this or the other completed work, Kansas Pastoral, because he considered the project incomplete. It was hung in the Capitol after his death. His planned first-floor rotunda panels never got beyond preliminary sketches. Much to the displeasure of some Kansans, and reflecting the views of agronomists at his employer, the Agricultural College of the University of Wisconsin, one panel blamed poor farming practices for the erosion and dust storms of the 1930s. Archival material A study for the mural is in the Spencer Museum. In popular culture The image was used as the album cover of Kansas (1974), the debut album of the rock band Kansas. Poster recreations and t-shirts are made every year for the annual \\"Border War\\" between the University of Kansas and the University of Missouri.

The county seat of Dodge County is Eastman. For decades, it was rumored that Dodge County had severely scandalous politicians. Due to the fact that vote buying was a known rural tradition, the situation stayed relatively low-key until the 1990s. Vote buying has been known to happen in obvious ways, but few situations have ever been as blatant as incidences in Dodge County. There were several stories of individuals selling votes in public places such as the Dodge County Courthouse.Sack, Kevin. \\"Georgia Gets Tough on a County Tradition: Vote-Buying.\\" The New York Times. N.p., 23 Mar. 1997. Web. 16 Oct. 2016. . This is a practice that would be inconceivable to most Americans. However, this had become everyday life for the voters and politicians in the rural south Georgia area. There were many different forms of voter fraud that were intertwined with the actual buying of votes that was taking place. There were several claims of convicted criminals casting ballots, which is illegal. Some voters were believed to have claimed that they were illiterate or physically disabled, when in fact they were making these claims so that campaign staff could go into the polling booth with them. These are just a few of the rumors and convictions that have been made over the past 20‚Äì30 years.  1990s  The most notable incident of voter fraud in Dodge County in the 1990s is the case of United States vs. McCranie. In this case, there were two defendants being tried together for several different methods of voter fraud. These methods included vote buying, vote selling, multiple voting, and votes cast by felons and deceased voters. The case involved the winners of the July 9th, 1996 races for Dodge County Sheriff and Dodge County Commissioner. The races were decided by 9 votes and 31 votes, respectively. The original results of the election had been contested, and a secondary election took place in an attempt to resolve the issue. In the secondary election, the Dodge County Sheriff's race was overturned, but the results of the Dodge County Commissioner's race remained the same. Through a joint federal-state investigation into the events that took place during this election, it was discovered that the defendants had likely worked together in order to buy votes. It was rumored that the parties discussed payments of roughly $20 per voter, and implemented plans to drive voters to voting stations. This was backed up with bank records that showed that the defendants had each obtained $15,000 in cash in $20 bills from the Bank of Eastman. The use of absentee ballots made it easier for the voter fraud to take place. An unprecedented 15% of all ballots that were submitted in this race were absentee ballots. According to the Elections Superintendent, this was very unusual for Dodge County. The two defendants were accused of voter fraud and sentenced on March 12, 1999. Many federal officials described the 1996 election trial as the largest election-fraud prosecution in United States history. 2000s Even though the sentencing of multiple candidates and voters in the 1996 Dodge County local and state election caused quite a stir in the county, it did not put the age-old tradition of voter fraud away. This is evidence that vote buying is more than just something that a few individuals did in an attempt to get elected. The reoccurrence of voter fraud in Dodge County shows that it is actually a tradition. While this may seem laughable, it is true that some voters in Dodge County were even unaware that the practice of vote buying was illegal. This may very well be due to the fact that the candidates were so open in their fraudulent practices. The most notable case of voter fraud in the 2000s is the case of the 2004 Dodge County Sheriff's race. Former Dodge County Sheriff Lawton Douglas Jr. was indicted on two counts of conspiracy and four counts of vote buying in July 2009. This indictment came due to an investigation of the 2004 election, and did not include any charges for the potentially fraudulent 2008 election. Former Sheriff Lawton Douglas received a maximum sentence. The sentencing cited Douglas's use of cash, liquor, and drugs to buy votes in the election. Also, Douglas had people accompany voters into the polling booths in order to ensure that the vote actually went to him. His punishment was 18 months in federal prison.  Resolution  The voter fraud tradition in Dodge County, Georgia is far from being resolved. There are ongoing investigations throughout local, southern politics, many of which will likely end in indictments. Regardless of the past or future reception of punishment by those committing acts of wrongdoing in Dodge County, there will likely be voter fraud continuously taking place in the region. Until all voters are informed on the issue of vote buying, there will be little that can be done to enforce the laws. Without knowing they are committing a criminal act, voters will have little motivation to stop receiving money for votes. Likewise, until all fraudulent candidates are held accountable, it will be difficult to assume that the elections are fair. Resolution to the tradition of vote buying in Dodge County is far from complete.

The outcome of the sprint is a deliverable, albeit with some increments. The scrum is used for projects like Web Technology or development of a product for the new market, i.e. the product with many requirements or fast-changing requirement.  History  Sprint (Scrum) came into existence during early 1990s when Ken Schwaber was working with Mike Smith and Chris Martin, and Jeff Sutherland was working with Jeff McKenna. In 1995, Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland presented Scrum at OOPSLA conference.  Values  The key feature of Sprint is its fixed time- frame. In the beginning of the Sprint, some goals are defined which are then worked upon and carefully reviewed throughout the sprint. If review implies any deviations in the product, then adjustments are made as soon as possible to control further deviation. Sprint thus takes as input \\"Sprint Backlog\\" and gives an incremental deliverable version of the product as the output. To accomplish this, Sprint employs transparency, inspection and adaptation as its basic values. Transparency ensures that all the stakeholders have a common understanding of what is considered \\"done\\". Inspection and Adaptation help control any deviations so that at the end of the sprint, a maximum value product is delivered. Immediately after the conclusion of previous Sprint, next Sprint follows.  Terminologies  Sprint works in conjunction with Sprint Backlog, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review and other such events. = Product Owner = Product Owner is responsible for product's current state of development and for maximizing the product's value. Product Owner can be one person, even if they represent a committee. Their job includes: * Maintaining items in Product Backlog. * Assigning order to items in Backlog. * Ensuring that items in Product Backlog are clear to the Development Team. = Development Team = The development team is responsible for the implementation of the articles in Sprint Backlog . Although several members of the development team may specialize in different areas, the development team as a whole is responsible for the development of functionality. = Sprint Backlog = Sprint Backlog refers to a subset of Product Backlog that is selected for a Sprint along with its delivery plan. Based on the items in the Sprint Backlog, Development Team decides how they will create a \\"Done\\" product. = Daily Scrum = Daily Scrum is a fixed time, fixed place event that allows Development Team to synchronize and plan work for the next 24 hours based on the amount of work done since the last Daily Scrum. During Daily Scrum, Development Team members explain: * What did I do yesterday that helped towards Sprint Goal? * What am I going to do today towards my Sprint Goal? * What Impediments I see towards accomplishing my Sprint Goal? Daily Scrum usually lasts for 15 minutes, but can be followed by other meetings for detailed discussions. = Sprint Review = Sprint Review is scheduled after the sprint ends. The team and stakeholders inspect the amount of work done. The Product Owner adapts the Product Backlog if necessary. . Sprint review is one inspect-and-adapt opportunity at the end of each sprint. = Sprint Retrospective = Sprint Retrospective is used to analyze what went right in the Sprint and what could be improved upon. The Scrum Team examines the process used to build that increment. This Retrospective feedback helps improve the process in Sprints to follow. Sprint retrospective is one inspect- and-adapt opportunity at the end of each sprint.  Process Flow  An idea to create a system initiates the Scrum project. At first, the vision may be ambiguous, but as the project evolves, team members start getting a clear picture of the desired system. The role of Product Owner is to frame the strategy, together with Product Backlog and deliver the vision project to those funding the project. A prioritized Project Backlog is then created where Core functionality is assigned the highest priority. Additional features, however, can be left for the incremental product. The key objective now is to translate this prioritized list into \\"Done\\" product. Every Sprint starts with a Sprint Planning Meeting and lasts for 30 days or less. In the meeting, prioritized items from Product Backlog are discussed amongst the development team, Scrum Master and the Product Owner. Development Team then discusses and presents their views regarding the feasibility of the tasks. Once decided, finalized tasks are then discussed and assigned to Development Team members. This is followed by the second phase of the meeting, which only constitutes Development Team where the team discusses the plan of work. Daily Scrums are held where the team discusses current state of work and any impediments they encountered. Quick adjustments are made if deviations are observed. At the end of the Sprint, Team, Scrum Master and Product Owner review the Sprint and plan accordingly for the next one.

Description  The oil painting on canvas measures 56 x 39 centimeters, and is in the collection of the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in Brescia. The painting depicts Salome dressed in expensive clothes and a rich fur, laying a golden scepter in her left hand. Long hair are twisted together with a green veil and pearl strands. The figure of the woman seems to rest on a marble plaque placed in the foreground, over which, in black characters, there is the inscription \\"QVAE SACRV[M] Ioanis CAPVT SALTANDO OBTINVIT\\". The background is covered by some laurel trees  Analysis  The work is also known by the name of Tullia d'Aragona, or more often, Tullia d'Aragona as Salome, though the identification with the historical character of Tullia d'Aragona is without references. The work, according to critics, inaugurates the late production of the artist, where Moretto is much freer in composition and colors than previous works, in the style of Titian.  History  The original patron of the painting is unknown, and it appears for the first time in historical documents in a 19th-century inventory of Count Teodoro Lechi, reported under the title Herodias with fur and a wand in his hand. He then transferred it to other owners, in Brescia, and on 20 July 1814 it was used in exchange to obtain the Baptism of Saint Catherine by Paolo Veronese. The painting was then bought by Count Paolo Tosio in 1829 and along with the rest of the noble collection entered the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in 1846.Pier Virgilio Begni Redona, pag. 354 The painting has been restored in 1986, and the operation has freed the painted surface from previous fillings, recovering almost completely the brilliance of the original color scheme.

When Robert was a baby, Sexton's family moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey, as New Jersey was the home of Robert's maternal grandmother. His mother, uncle, and maternal grandmother and grandfather were Holocaust survivors from Lithuania who had been forced into a concentration camp by the Nazis. Sexton obtained a degree from Middlesex College, in business and marketing. Sexton then attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City. He also obtained a film and television production certificate from LACC. Career =Music= As a teenager, Sexton joined the band Gen√∂cide and played with them for seven years. The drummer for Gen√∂cide was Brain Damage (Brian Keats), and the band was fronted by vocalist Bobby Ebz (Bobby is also noted for spending the day with the notorious shock rocker GG Allin on the day GG died). Shortly before the band broke up, Pete \\"Damien\\" Marshall joined Gen√∂cide and played second guitar. During the years Sexton played with the band, they released the albums \\"Reign of Terror\\", \\"Guttercat\\", and \\"Submit to Gen√∂cide\\" (engineered by Al Theurer, who also worked with Wendy O. Williams, Joan Jett, and Carly Simon).Al Theurer - Engineer Discography Sexton then founded the band One Bad Eye, who he played with for three years. One Bad Eye put out their self-titled debut album \\"One Bad Eye\\" in 1993. The album was engineered by Mark Pakucko, who also worked with Dinosaur Jr., Frank Black, Def Leppard, and Rage Against the Machine).Matt Pakucko - Engineer Discography It was produced by Mark Christian, who produced albums by Cher, The Supremes, and Steve Perry. He also played with the bands Undesirables and Pound of Flesh, for three years and two years, respectively. =Music videos= Sexton started his career in Los Angeles as a film editor. Meeting director Brian Smith in an editing bay, he was offered a job as a production manager. Becoming a producer, he produced major music videos for country artists including Toby Keith, Reba McEntire, Brad Paisley, and Clint Black; rock artists including Marilyn Manson, OK Go, and John Fogerty; hip-hop artists like Busta Rhymes; and Christian artists including Skillet, KJ-52, and ZOEgirl. Sexton then moved largely into directing. One of his videos for Incite, which premiered on the Wall Street Journal, was the first ever narrative-driven heavy metal virtual reality video. In his career, he has directed many music videos for bands including Soulfly for \\"Unleash\\", The Devil Wears Prada for \\"Sailor's Prayer\\", and Cavalera Conspiracy for \\"Killing Inside\\". =Virtual reality= Sexton's entrance into the world of virtual reality was with his creation of \\"cinematic virtual reality\\", the technique of blending together traditional film techniques with virtual reality. His most notable work in this realm is his short \\"Psycho City, TX\\". \\"Psycho City, TX\\" was released on Sexton's app HollywoodAsylumVR and premiered at VRLA. Sexton described the medium as being good for horror for its realism. He told LA Weekly in May 2018, \\"Your brain thinks it's a real event that's happening and remembers it as something real. It's not like watching a TV screen or a movie screen. You're in there, you know, it's a hot environment; your brain is thinking this is real.\\" Personal life Robert J.

It ran north from Hamilton on the western end of Lake Ontario to Collingwood on Georgian Bay and Barrie on Lake Simcoe. Through the purchase of the Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway, the route continued south from Hamilton to Port Dover on Lake Erie. The H&NW; was formed to compete with the Northern Railway of Canada, which ran from Toronto to Barrie and then onto Collingwood. Towns along the H&NW; route put up bonuses for construction in the hopes that it would lead to lower prices. Construction began in 1874 but economic troubles delayed it for the next two years. Major construction began in 1876, officially reaching Barrie on 1 December 1877, and Collingwood in 1879. The entire line was officially opened in December 1879, although it had been operational for some time at that point. To everyone's surprise, in June 1879 the H&NW; merged with its supposed competitor to become the Northern and North-Western Railway. Both railways saw their ultimate role as a connection between the Toronto area and the newly completely Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) mainline across northern Ontario. Flush with cash from the merger, the new company built the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway to the CPR at North Bay in 1886. The value of this route made them a takeover target, and the entire network was purchased by the Grand Trunk Railway in 1888, eventually becoming part of the Canadian National Railway (CNR) in 1923. With the CNR takeover, the railway now had two routes into Collingwood. The H&NW;'s Collingwood branch was considered sub-par and the subject of jokes, but it was not until 1955 that CNR finally received permission to stop daily service along it. The northern section from Collingwood to Creemore remained in freight service until 1960, and the section from Alliston to Beeton until 1990. The mainline from Hamilton to Barrie closed in sections during the 1980s. Short sections remain in use to this day, and a section in the middle is now part of the South Simcoe Railway. History =Southern Ontario railway race= Through the middle of the 19th century, the growing cities of Hamilton and Toronto were in a constant battle for resources in order to establish themselves as the industrial capital of Upper Canada. By 1860 it seemed that Toronto was winning this race; the Great Western Railway, Grand Trunk Railway and Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway all met at its waterfront. There had been some work on a Hamilton and Port Dover Railway as early as 1834. The company did not officially charter until 1853, and another decade before construction started. The cost of driving the line up Hamilton Mountain forced the company into bankruptcy and they were taken over by the newly- formed Hamilton and Lake Erie Railway (H&LE;) in 1869. The H&LE; reached Jarvis in 1873, and then stalled at this point only a short distance from their goal. The Ontario, Simcoe and Huron, by this time known as the Northern Railway of Canada, had built up a lucrative route for shipping wood and grain, first from southern Lake Simcoe and later, Collingwood which offered connections to the upper Great Lakes. Customers along the line accused the company of price gouging and there was considerable demand for a second route. =Hamilton and North-Western= Beeton was a stop on the Hamilton and Northwestern Railway. The line split a short distance north of the station at Allimil, with the mainline running to Barrie and a branch-line to Collingwood. In March 1872, the Hamilton and North-Western formed and announced their intention to build this second route, running from Hamilton to Barrie with a branch to Collingwood. Towns along the proposed routes gave up large bonuses to be selected as stops along the line. This included the city of Hamilton, who pledged $100,000 if the railway would run along Beach Strip, which they were developing as a recreational site. The announcement caused the Northern to begin plans for their own expansions in the area, approaching the same towns with offers to built new lines. However, ill-will against the Northern was too strong, and by 1877 their plans to compete directly appear to have been abandoned. Some of the extensions planned during this period would be built, but they did not pass through the same route. Construction of the line began in 1874, but was almost immediately stopped due to the Panic of 1873 and the ensuing Long Depression. Work continued in fits and starts over the next year. The line reached Milton on 13 November 1876 where it met the Toronto and Hamilton Railway (by this time, part of the Great Western Railway) and Georgetown later that year, where it met the Toronto, Grey and Bruce Railway (part of the Grand Trunk). It reached Beeton (then known as Clarksville) in October 1877, and Barrie on the last day of the year. Construction of the branch to Collingwood was completed in 1878, with a station built on Walnut Street. The lines continued for a short distance past the station to the Collingwood Milling Company on the lakeshore, and there were plans to extend this onto a wharf with a large grain silo to compete with the Northern's on the east end of town. The Collingwood line officially opened for business on 1 January 1879, and ran its official inspection train on 16 January. In 1877, the H&NW; bought and merged the operations of the H&LE.; As part of the purchase, they completed the line to Port Dover in 1878. However, by this point the Port Dover and Lake Huron Railway (PD&LH;) had built up most of the better spots in the port, so their line was forced to run on the east side of the Lynn River where they built a station. The two railways eventually came to an agreement to share the waterfront and the grain elevator and the H&NW; built a bridge over the river to connect to the PD&LH.; With the completion of the Collingwood and Port Dover portions in 1878, the network now provided a route that connected lakes Huron, Simcoe, Ontario and Erie. In 1884, the Silverbrook Tramway chartered to build a short connection westward from Tioga station to a lumber mill. =Merger with Northern= In June 1879, to the great consternation of the cities that had put up bonuses, the H&NW; accepted a bid from the Northern to merge their operations into the new Northern and Northwestern Railway (N&NW;). The H&NW;'s station on Walnut was abandoned in favour of the Northern's on St. Paul Street to the east, and plans for their own wharf and silo were abandoned. The Northern was at that time a Provincial gauge line, and directly connecting the two in Collingwood was not possible. The Northern lines were switched to Standard gauge in sections during 1881. In 1882 the Canadian Pacific Railway reached North Bay, some distance north of Barrie. As the railhead began to approach North Bay, a new railway rush broke out to connect the CP line to Toronto. The Northern was an obvious choice as a starting point as by this time they had constructed an extension to Bracebridge, Ontario and had most of the good routes west of Lake Simcoe locked up. The merger with the H&NW; provided the capital and cashflow needed to build the remaining section, the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway, which reached North Bay in 1886. The next year, the rapidly expanding Grand Trunk purchased a controlling interest in the N&NW;, and a completed the takeover on 24 January 1888. This formed the basis of the company's Toronto- area network, and was soon joined by new east-west lines to compete with the CP. =Closure= As part of the Grand Trunk's 1918 bankruptcy, the line eventually became part of the Canadian National Railway in 1923. Service along the H&NW; route was reduced from two to one trains a day, and in 1930 the passenger stations at Duntroon and Glen Huron were closed. During the following years, the section from Beeton to Collingwood became the Alliston Subdivision, while the mainline from Hamilton to Barrie became the Milton Subdivision. In 1955, CNR received permission to stop daily service on the Alliston Subdivision. By this time it was the subject of jokes about its poor construction. The rails were very lightweight at 56 pound/yard, and it was said the contractor saved money by backfilling with trees which then rotted and left the line in very rough condition. A joke was that speed was limited to 60 mph - 20 forward, 20 side-to-side, and 20 up-and-down. The last daily train on the Alliston Subdivision ran on 29 October 1955. In April 1956 the line between Alliston and Creemore was lifted, leaving the main line into Barrie complete, along with what amounted to spurs from Collingwood to Creemore and Beeton and Alliston. The northern section in Collingwood became part of the Meaford Subdivision, the CNR name for the original Northern route into town, while the southern section became part of the Milton Subdivision. The northern section was used only briefly until April 1960, mostly between Collingwood and Glen Huron for the Hamilton Brothers lumber yard. The condition of the tracks deteriorated to the point where speeds were limited to . Still largely powered by steam at this point, this spur presented a problem because there was no way to turn around south of Collingwood. Trains to Creemore or Glen Huron had to back all the way to Collingwood where the railway turntable remained in use. Between August 1955 and January 1957, a 4-6-4 \\"Baltic\\" tank engine was used for this service as it eliminated the tender which made operations somewhat simpler. On 28 October 1963, as part of a reorganization, the section of the Milton Subdivision north of Georgetown became known as the Beeton Subdivision, and then again one year became part of the Halton Subdivision. On 27 January 1975, CNR received permission to abandon the section between Georgetown and Cheltenham, a little less than . On 22 June 1984, they received permission to abandon the section from Cheltenham to Beeton. The remaining line from Beeton to Barrie became the Beeton Spur on 3 March 1988, part of the Newmarket Subdivision. On 15 August 1989 they received permission to abandon the remaining section on 1 January 1990. When CNR received permission to abandon the section from Cheltenham to Beeton, the section north of Tottenham to Beeton was purchased by what is today the South Simcoe Railway. They run heritage steam trains on this short section. The section between Burlington and Georgetown is today part of CN's busy Halton Subdivision, while the section from Georgetown to Tottenham is a rail trail, which is part of the Trans-Canada Trail. Route Midland, and the route to Collingwood was built further west than shown here. :From the Ontario Railway Map Collection, unless otherwise noted. The original H&NW; route starts near the shore of Lake Ontario in Hamilton where it wyed off the Great Western Railway just east of Ferguson Avenue, about east of the original train station on the banks of Hamilton Harbour. A second wye about a block east of the split connected it the Hamilton and Lake Erie, which ran south through town. The line continued eastward, parallel to the Great Western, for about to the Dofasco plant. This section remains in use as industrial spurs. Just east of Dofasco it turned to the northeast and then followed a long curve near Woodward Avenue that turned it to the northwest along the spit across the entrance of Hamilton Harbour. From here it runs northwest along the beach across the entrance of the harbour beside today's Burlington Skyway. The Burlington Canal Lift Bridge over the Burlington Bay Canal into the harbour, built for the line in 1962, has since been reused for the local road Eastport Drive and the Breezeway Trail recreational trail. A second branch met the line where it ran onto the beach, leading southeast to meet the Great Western at Stoney Creek station, forming a huge wye out of the Hamilton lines with its northern apex on the beach. The line continues northwest into Burlington, turning slightly westward to meet the Hamilton and Toronto Railway (Grand Trunk) at Burlington Junction. From there it turns northeast for a short distance before curving to the northwest again near Appleby Line. The line runs through Milton, jogging for a short distance to the northeast in the middle of town, before leaving town heading northwest again. It bends northward to Georgetown where it crosses the Toronto and Guelph Railway (also Grand Trunk). A switch north of town connects to a short line running eastward to large wye that connects to the Toronto and Guelph at the switchyard in town; this section was originally constructed by the Toronto and Guelph in 1854 to service a quarry north of town. The mainline continues roughly northward out of Georgetown to Inglewood station, turns north-northeast through Palgrave, then north again through Tottenham and into Beeton. Just north of Beeton, at Allmil, the line spits. The mainline to Barrie runs northeast out of Allmil to Cookstown and then northward through Thornton. On the far side of town, it makes a sharp turn to the east, running east- northeast under Ontario Highway 400 and then turns sharply again to run northward into southern Barrie. Just south of Yonge Street (formerly Ontario Highway 11) it turned westward to run just south of Burton Avenue and then north along the west side of Bradford Street, looping around Kempenfelt Bay to end in a station at Sophia Street. After the merger with the Northern, the Sophia station was abandoned and the line was extended across Yonge Street to join the Northern close to the Allendale Station. The Collingwood spur runs northwest from Allmil through Alliston and on to Everett where it begins a more northerly route to Tioga. Here it meets the Silverbrook Tramway. It continues north-northwest to Glencairn, then northwest through Creemore where it turns westward around some high hills. North of Websterville i turns north again, passing through Smithdale where Glen Huron station was situated, then northwest again past Duntroon, Nottawa and finally into Collingwood along Walnut Street. The line met the Northern again on the North Grey Railway line, just north of First Street. The total distance of this portion was officially . Various sections of the former H&NW; remain in use. A short section outside Allandale Station in Barrie south to Innisfil Heights is now part of the Barrie Collingwood Railway . The other end of the line, the section between Georgetown and Burlington provides a crossover route from what was formerly the Hamilton and Toronto along the lakeshore, and the Grand Trunk Railway running to Guelph further north.

This form of feminism allows for a broader audience beyond the white middle aged women who began the movement. It actively fights racism and class privilege by ‚Äúensuring that those most affected by policies and practices are at the decision making table.‚Äù It advocates for more women of color in leadership roles and allows recognition for global gender justice and women's rights.  Florence Kelley  In response to the obstacles women faced in the workplace involving wages, hours, and conditions, Florence Kelley from Philadelphia initiated and coined the term social justice feminism in the early 1900s. Kelley envisioned the passage and implementation of labor legislation for working women. When Kelley died in 1932, Melly Dewson, her protege, takes over the movement.  History  During the 1899 New Women's Movement Initiative (NWMI), Social Justice Feminism was made the emphasis of the women's movement. The NWMI was a series of meetings meant to ‚Äúbuild relationships, trust, and analysis necessary to revitalize US feminism‚Äù During these meetings, there was a struggle to agree on, ‚Äúwhether the women‚Äôs movement should aspire to be about [women‚Äôs] rights or social justice‚Äù. Those who wanted it to be about women's rights feared that a social justice title would ignore the discrimination that women face. This is due to the fact feminism and the beginnings of the woman's movement was portrayed as for white middle aged women. Therefore, these white women did not want the movement to be seen as social justice. They did not understand that by viewing it as social justice feminism, it includes more people's right than just theirs; it includes minorities just as much. Ultimately, the NWMI wanted to ‚Äúregain momentum in the political arena‚Äù so the women agreed to base the movement on promoting principles of social justice feminism. Social Justice Feminism first focused on labor reforms. This included advocating for reduced working hours and better working conditions for women. This turns from protecting women workers to expanding workplace protections for all employees after some time. In the Muller V Oregon Supreme Court Case, the issue of a minimum work was addressed. Muller had required one of his employees at his factory to work beyond the minimum hour work day and was taken to court due to this. Florence Kelly assisted Oregon's attorney, Louis D. Brandeis, in the case and luckily the outcome was in their favor. ‚ÄúBy a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld the Oregon law,‚Äù As a response to this case, Kelly and other social justice feminists lobbied for minimum wage laws. Their success consisted of twelve states obtaining such legislation by 1917.  Intersectionality  Social Justice Feminism is built on the fundamentals of intersectionality. Intersectionality is defined as, ‚Äúthe theory that the overlap of various social identities, as race, gender, sexuality, and class, contributes to the specific type of systemic oppression and discrimination experienced by an individual,‚Äù As an example, one can be discriminated against based on their gender for being a woman, but one can also be discriminated based on their race and gender for being a Latina woman. These layers of oppression intersect with one another, making it harder on them. In relation to Social Justice Feminism, the movement is about evoking change for all rights therefore intersectionality must be looked at. It allows us to view the different ways men and women can be oppressed thus leading to taking action. During the National Women's Movement Initiative, ‚Äúparticipants were diverse in terms of race, ethnicity, economic status, sexuality, geographic locale and age. There was a strong presence of women of color as well as a cross generational representation of women who became active in the women‚Äôs movement\\" A more diverse group of people were wanting to participate in the movement but worried about feeling accepted. They questioned whether they were accepted in the movement. Ultimately, these women felt welcome and valued as they shared a similarity with the rest of the women; a desire to ‚Äúmaximize the potential of the movement as a social change agent‚Äù.  Social Justice Feminism today  Social Justice Feminism is not a thing of the past. We still see it today around the world. As an example, in San Francisco, the Young Women's Freedom Center (Formally, Center for Young Women's Development) becomes the first United States non-profit that is run and led entirely by young women. These cis and trans women are ‚ÄúBuilding a movement of formerly incarcerated and system involved young women to transform the systems that keep us living in poverty, stuck in cycles of violence, and incarcerated‚Äù Their goal is to, ‚Äúchange the systems, policies, services, and narratives that ensnare young women of color, poor young women, and queer and transgender young women in cycles of violence, economic marginalization, incarceration, and self destruction,‚Äù. One of the organizations provided by this group is called Sisters Rising. The women who lead this provide young women that have been in the juvenile system with paid internships. Because it is difficult to obtain a job with their status, Sisters Rising is truly providing these girls with great resources. The internships, ‚Äúincorporate healing, skills development, political education, community organizing and reintegration into the community‚Äù Overall, Sisters Rising is helping young women who struggle to stay out of the criminal justice system by providing with meaningful employment. This is more than what most of our world does today to help young women like this. Another organization that provides social justice is the National Latina Business Women Association-Los Angeles (NLBWA-LA). This organization offers workshops, programs and networking connections to Latinas who are expanding their business. The goal of NLBWA-LA is to support Latina women in the business industry allowing women of color to be noticed more. Social Justice Feminism today, like it always has, consists of making change happen for all those who are oppressed whether that be due to sex, race, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, etc. The difference is that since the New Women's Movement Initiative in 1899, there have been various waves of Feminism that have been tacked onto the movement. Issues that social justice feminists have fought such as, suffrage, education, representation, have broadened to equality, sexism, environmental justice, and domestic violence. Although the issues continue to change or become broader, social justice feminists is continuing to fight.

Early life  She was born Viola Katherine Clemmons in Scott County, Illinois. Her father Seldon Perry Clemmons was thirty-one, and her mother Martha Isabell (n√©e) Kilpatrick was twenty-nine. Seldon worked in retail running his own company called \\"S. P. Clemmons\\" and her mother Martha was a homemaker. In Katherine's first years of life, she was raised in Montezuma, Pike County, Illinois. Katherine was the couple's third child. Their oldest daughter was named Ella May (1861‚Äì1935). Seldon and Martha would later have Ida Susan (1864‚Äì1871). Sadly Ida died young, at the age of six. Katherine's parents later divorced when she was still young. After the divorce, the two surviving children (Ella May and Katherine) went to live with their father. In 1876, they went to live with their mother Martha, who had married Judge Walton Dayan, a stationer for the Southern Pacific Railroad. Occasionally, Katherine and Ella would visit their father and eight half-siblings. In 1891 Katherine, Ella May, Martha, and Walton moved to 449 Seneca Street in Palo Alto, California. Walton and Martha lived there until 1916.  Acting career  Katherine went by the stage name of \\"Katherine Dayan\\". Some of her first acting appearances were made at Maguire‚Äôs Opera House in San Francisco. Later, Katherine acted in a play called A Lady of Venice starring as a woman called \\"Nina\\", first in New York City, and then in Boston. The play was bought by Buffalo Bill. According to one newspaper columnist's review, Katherine had a \\"beautiful profile and a lissome figure but was devoid of any acting ability\\".  Relationship with Buffalo Bill  Katherine first met Bill at one of his shows in England. Bill at first had doubts about Katherine and in a letter to Frank Butler emphasized that \\"She is too swift and dishonest for me\\". But Bill later recanted his views on Katherine and called her \\"the finest looking woman in the world\\". However, when asked about her relationship with Buffalo Bill by the media, Katherine stated that \\"he was only her dramatic agent and as such had advanced her no funds that had not been repaid\\". Later in divorce court, her husband Howard Gould accused Katherine of improper conduct with Bill while Katherine and Howard were still married.  Marriage to Howard Gould  Katherine traveled to England in 1891, and there she met Howard Gould. After four years of courtship, they announced their engagement in June 1895. His father, Jay Gould, disapproved of his son's wish to marry Katherine and threatened to take away his son's inheritance. This was not enough to dissuade Howard, and the couple wedded on October 12, 1898, in a private ceremony held in Clemmons' apartment at the Holland House. The low-key reception was at Katherine's request; knowing how ferociously her father-in-law disapproved of their marriage. The wedding cost Howard Gould $5,000,000 out of his inheritance. The marriage itself lasted for less than a decade. Howard accused Katherine of adultery with Dustin Farnum and Buffalo Bill. The couple lived separate lives for several years before the divorce was finalized in 1909. Howard had to pay Katherine $36,000 per year in alimony (approximately $950,000 today). It was the largest alimony settlement at the time.  Later years  After the divorce, Katherine spent much of her leisure days raising thoroughbreds on Blue Gap Farm in Boonsboro, Virginia near Lynchburg. In 1910 Katherine was convinced that someone had tried to poison her three times; however, the doctor found no signs of poison in her system and her physician diagnosed her with \\"extreme nervousness\\". She died at the age of sixty-one after an illness of several months at Blue Gap Farm on October 24, 1930.

The building complex is listed. History Seal from Christians Plejehus In the early 1760s, Christian Carl Pflueg. an officer in the engineering troops, proposed an improvement of the conditions in the home for war veterans at Ladeg√•rden. In 1764, the fieldmarshal-general assigned him as an assistant to the director of the institution. The following year he left the engineering troops to assume a position as director of a new institution which was given the name Christians Plejehjem after Christian VII. Kammerr√•d Gilles Vilhelm Faenen's former factory site in Store Kongensgade was chosen as the location of the new institution and Plejehus designed the buildings which were completed in 1769. The complex contained a linen weaving mill operated by the residents using yarn made by soldier wives and daughters. Other crafts were also practiced in the facility. The complex was originally intended for 300 residents but was home to 500 by 1772 approximately half of which were children. The building in the late 19th century In 1775, Christians Plejehus was moved to S√∏lvgade Barracks together with Almindelig Hospital and Pflueg was placed under supervision of a director general since his administration was deemed to costly. The move hadm however, disturbed the operations of the weaving mill and deteriorated the institution economy even further. In 1782, Pflueg was fired without pension and Christians Plejehus moved to Eckernf√∏rde in Schleswig-Holstein in 1785. When Christians Plejehus moved to S√∏lvgade in 1775, its old buildings in Store Kongensgade were taken over by Det kgl. Opfostringshus. It was based there until 1880 when a new building in Randersgade in √òsterbro was inaugurated in 1880. The Salvation Army rented the chapel from 1886 until 1948 and became home to several house share collectives in the 1960s. It has later been converted into a housing cooperative. The buildings were renovated in 2009. Building The rear side of the main wing One of the two courtyards The building is 15 bays long has a median risalit with rustication and the ground floor is decorated with 10 lesenes. Above the gate is a two-bay wall dormer and a coat of arms Frederick V's monogram and. The gate opens to two consecutive courtyards. The wing separating the two courtyards from each other contains the chapel. Today The complex contains a mixture of apartments and offices.

History Zip's Drive In was founded in 1953 in Kennewick, Washington, by Robert \\"Zip\\" Zuber. Zip's was originally created to serve scientists and workers coming to the Tri-Cities to work at Hanford and other nuclear industry companies. Zip's attracted so many customers, that Zuber decided to build another store, this time in Spokane. The new store was an immediate hit with college kids from Gonzaga. Zip Zuber then sold the Spokane store to Jake Vorrath, who opened another burger store in Spokane. He then sold the store to Harold Laing, and the other store to the drive-in's manager, Harold Fettig. When Henry Laing died, his wife sold the restaurant to Ed Minor, who partnered with Don Kelly. Fettig, Minor, Kelly, their families, and former store managers remain operators of the most of the restaurants today. In the 1960s, Zip's was a typical American drive-in restaurant, but by the 1970s many drive-ins across America were closing. Zip's began to decline, but Minor and Kelly built some of the first drive-thrus in the Northwest. Their quick thinking ended up saving the chain, and it is one of the few local restaurant chains still in operation today. Locations Zip's Locations by county. Current locations are in red, while former locations are in pink Zip's is located in 8 counties across Washington and Idaho, and was located in 11 counties at its peak. The chain started in the Tri-Cities, spread to Spokane, and then eventually spread to the Idaho Panhandle and the Palouse. Locations in Ritzville and Boise were opened, but due to the recession, the Boise location has since closed down.

It is known to host one planet, a super-Neptune, named K2-33b. It is also notable for its young age. Nomenclature and history K2-33 also has the 2MASS catalogue number J16101473-1919095 and EPIC designation 205117205. Planetary candidates were detected around the star by NASA's Kepler Mission on its K2 mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars. These dips in brightness can be interpreted as planets whose orbits pass in front of their stars from the perspective of Earth, although other phenomenon can also be responsible which is why the term planetary candidate is used. Following the acceptance of the discovery paper, the Kepler team provided an additional moniker for the system of \\"K2-33\\". The discoverers referred to the star as K2-33, which is the normal procedure for naming the exoplanets discovered by the spacecraft. Hence, this is the name used by the public to refer to the star and its planet. Candidate planets that are associated with stars studied by the Kepler Mission are assigned the designations \\".01\\" etc. after the star's name, in the order of discovery. If planet candidates are detected simultaneously, then the ordering follows the order of orbital periods from shortest to longest. Following these rules, there was only one candidate planet were detected, with an orbital period of 5.424865 days. The designation of b is given to the first planet orbiting a given star, followed by the other letters of the alphabet. In the case of K2-33, there was only one planet, so only the letter b are used. The name K2-33 derives directly from the fact that the star is the catalogued 33rd star discovered by K2 to have confirmed planets. Stellar characteristics This star was identified as a young pre- main-sequence object that belongs to the Upper Scorpius subgroup of the Scorpius‚ÄìCentaurus Association in a 2001 article, based on its high lithium content and position in the HR diagram. This is the nearest OB association and recent massive star formation region, with the Upper Scorpius subgroup having a mean distance of 145 parsecs (470 light-years). Direct parallax measurements, by the Gaia spacecraft, indicate that K2-33 is at a distance of 140 ¬± 2 pc, consistent with association to Upper Scorpius. The age of this subgroup is estimated at 11 ¬± 2 million years, while evolutionary models estimate to K2-33 an independent age of 9.3 million years. K2-33's spectrum is best modelled with a spectral type of M3.3 and a visual extinction of 0.75 magnitudes, so the star can be considered to be a red dwarf. Its effective temperature has been measured at 3,540 K, which together with the apparent brightness of the star indicates a luminosity of 0.15 times the solar luminosity and a radius of 1.05 times the solar radius. This large size is typical of young stars and indicates that the star is still in the process of contracting towards the main sequence. The mass of this star is not known accurately, and has been estimated at 0.56 or 0.31 times the solar mass. The metallicity of K2-33 is consistent with being equal to the solar value ([Fe/H] = 0). As a young star, K2-33 has a fast rotation, with a projected rotational velocity of 8.2 km/s. The rotation period of the star, 6.3 days, is known from the light curve obtained by the Kepler spacecraft, causing periodic variations of about 2% in the brightness of the star as star spots appear and disappear from Earth's line of sight. This stellar variability was removed for the analysis of the transit signal of the planet K2-33b. K2-33 is almost certainly not a binary star. Radial velocity data obtained by the HIRES spectrograph, in the Keck I Telescope, do not show an acceleration larger than 2.6 km/s/yr, which excludes objects more massive than 0.14 solar masses at 3 AU or closer. Adaptive optics infrared observations by the NIRC2 imager, in the Keck II Telescope, can exclude companions more massive than 19 Jupiter masses at 3 AU or further, and 11-12 Jupiter masses at 6-23 AU. The combination of both observational limits only allows for the existence of brown dwarfs or very low mass stars at separations of 1-3 AU. Planetary system The only known planet transits the star; this means that the planet's orbit appear to cross in front of their star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Its inclination relative to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight it is, vary by less than one degree. This allows direct measurements of the planet's periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring the planet's transit of the star. K2-33b is known remarkably for its extremely young age, only one other planet is younger (V830 Tau b), with an age of around 2 million years, while K2-33b is only 9.3 million years old. Nonetheless, it is quite a discovery in the search of exoplanets. Infrared measurements by the Spitzer Space Telescope show that there is still a disk of planetary debris, indicating that planet formation may not be finished yet.

Early life and education Leslie Wolfe exhibited an interest in literature at a young age. She was encouraged by her mother, who owned several thousand titles in the family library. She gave Wolfe reading assignments of increasing difficulty, matching her evolving interests. By age 10, it was all about cloaks, daggers, and adventure, with Jules Verne and Alexandre Dumas. By age 16, Edgar Allan Poe, Leo Tolstoy, but also A.J. Cronin, Margaret Mitchell, and W. Somerset Maugham kept Wolfe company. Then history and geopolitics caught her attention for a while, enticing her to read about the making of the atomic bomb and the most relevant moments of World War II. As a young adult, she explored the fascinating world of science fiction, with the works of Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert. As a teenager, Wolfe tutored younger children, her family encouraging of her entrepreneurial spirit. Her unusual, yet popular and highly effective teaching methods included the literary analysis of hit music lyrics, which she called, \\"the only surviving form of modern-day poetry.\\" Career Wolfe began writing stories at a young age and published several short stories before finishing school. However, she followed a career path in business, putting her writing aspirations on the back burner for a while. She published her first novel, Executive, in 2011, while working as a senior business leader. The novel was received well by critics and readers, and later received inquiries from Hollywood. Leaving the coveted world of corporate boardrooms for the blissful peace of what she calls \\"the Wolves' den,\\" Wolfe applied herself to her one true passion, writing. To date, Wolfe has published thirteen novels and a multi-author collaboration anthology. Screenwriting Encouraged by the feedback received from readers of her books, and by the interest manifested by the movie industry, Wolfe wrote Adverse in 2016, an adaptation of her debut novel Executive for the big screen. Writing style Wolfe's novels break the mold of traditional thrillers. She is passionate about technology and psychology. Her extensive background and research in these fields empower and add texture to her multidimensional, engaging writing style. She has been recognized many times as one of the few women who endeavor on the almost exclusively male turf of political thrillers and espionage. Regardless of how prominently technology is featured in Wolfe's novels, mostly people go awry in Wolfe's often cautionary tales. Whether it's unchecked, destructive corporate greed (Executive) or personal weakness setting the stage for blackmail by a foreign interest (The Backup Asset), Wolfe surprises with remarkable understanding and portraying of human frailty, strife, and growth. Readers and critics describe her books as incredibly fast and engaging, while educational at the same time. \\"Reads like a movie,\\" is the common theme in the feedback received from many critics and reviewers. Wolfe's novels are mainly plot driven, although her future plans include the exploration of different themes and literary techniques, more character driven. Influencers With diverse interests as a reader, Wolfe noted Isaac Asimov and Frank Herbert as her most influential science fiction authors. Nora Roberts, Sidney Sheldon, Thomas Harris, and David Baldacci have also left their mark on Wolfe's craft. However, the most notable influencer for Wolfe was Michael Crichton. Wolfe admires Crichton's versatile talent and acute, analytical mind. She wishes she could have had the privilege to meet Crichton before his untimely death. Favorite Quotes ‚Ä¢ \\"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\\" ‚Äì Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry ‚Ä¢ \\"What one man can do, another can do.\\" ‚Äì Charles Morse in the movie The Edge, written by David Mamet ‚Ä¢ \\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\\" ‚Äì Albert Einstein Fiction Foretells the Future =1. Executive (2011)= In Chapter 39 of her debut novel, Wolfe describes an out-of-control drone, crashing on Florida Highway 98. Two years later, on July 17, 2013, a drone crashed on the same Florida Highway 98, only a few miles west of the spot Wolfe described in her book. The fictional crash took lives; the real one fortunately didn't. As for the causes of the two crashes, they are uncannily similar. =2. The Backup Asset (2015)= Wolfe depicts a guided missile destroyer as being the US Navy's biggest asset, posing a challenge for Russia. On May 20, 2016, the Navy announced the first Zumwalt-class destroyer was delivered from the manufacturer. News articles released in June and July 2016 feature Zumwalt generously, calling it the \\"greatest match-up ever\\" against Russia's s. Trivia The sound track for Executive's video trailer was mixed by Wolfe personally. Digital sound mixing is one of her hobbies. Personal life Leslie Wolfe lives in Florida with her husband, \\"the Wolfe,\\" and their dog. She enjoys engaging with her readers every day, exchanging emails and Facebook postings. Other than such remote engagements, Wolfe is a private person. Like many other authors, Wolfe is somewhat of a hermit. When working on a new novel, Wolfe doesn't leave the house for days in a row, choosing to stay locked in her office, focused on her work until the new novel is ready. Charities Wolfe has involved herself, many times anonymously, in supporting the Wikimedia Foundation, the California YWCA, an EMS/Air Rescue Service, North American Wild Wolves, and several dog rescue organizations.

He has appeared in several forms outside of the original stories. Theatre * In the William Gillette play, Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty was played on Broadway in the original (1899‚Äì1900) run by George Wessells (and again in 1905), then by Frank Keenan (1928), John Miltern (1929‚Äì30) and Philip Locke, Clive Revill and Alan Sues from 1974‚Äì76. * In the play Sherlock Holmes by Ouida Berg√®re (wife of actor Basil Rathbone), which ran at the New Century Theatre in New York City for only three performances from 30‚Äì31 October 1953, Moriarty was played by Thomas Gomez. *Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke, who played Holmes and Watson in the Granada Television series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1984‚Äì94), reprised their roles for Jeremy Paul's revisionist stage play, The Secret of Sherlock Holmes (1988‚Äì89). The only characters in the play are Holmes and Watson, and it highlights many aspects of their relationship from their first meeting to the Reichenbach Falls. In the second half, it is indicated that Moriarty never existed: he was a figment of Holmes' imagination, as the detective needed a worthy enemy as much as he needed a devoted friend like Watson. Radio *Louis Hector played the villain in numerous episodes of NBC's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (1934-1935). * Orson Welles played Professor Moriarty opposite Sir John Gielgud's Holmes in the episode \\"The Final Problem\\" of the 1954 series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. *Ralph Truman portrayed Moriarty in the 1955 BBC Home Service adaptation of \\"The Final Problem\\". * In the BBC Radio 4 November 1992 broadcast of The Final Problem and 24 February 1993 broadcast of The Empty House, Moriarty was played by Michael Pennington. * In the 1999 BBC radio comedy series The Newly Discovered Casebook of Sherlock Holmes, Moriarty was played by Geoffrey Whitehead. * In the podcast Hollywood Handbook, Moriarty is played by Hayes Davenport where he is usually fighting the antihero Santaman, played by Sean Clements.

In this version he is not the story's villain, but merely a harmless man who becomes an increasingly paranoid victim of Holmes' delusions, brought on by his addiction to cocaine and based on the fact that Moriarty indirectly contributed to the death of Holmes' mother, who was his lover. * In Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), Anthony Higgins plays Holmes' schoolmaster, Rathe, who turns out to be an evil Egyptian mastermind called \\"Eh-Tar\\". During the long credit roll at the end of the film, Eh-Tar is seen walking to an inn and signs the ledger as \\"Moriarty\\", indicating that he will become Holmes' archenemy in the future. Higgins later portrayed Holmes in Sherlock Holmes Returns (1993), making him one of only two actors to portray both Holmes and Moriarty on film (Richard Roxburgh being the other; Orson Welles played both Holmes and Moriarty in radio programmes). * Paul Freeman appeared as Moriarty in Without a Clue (1988); the film revolves around the premise that Dr. Watson (Ben Kingsley), who is the real crime- solving genius, has hired a boozy, out-of-work actor (Michael Caine) to play \\"Holmes\\". Moriarty is aware of the deception and refers to \\"Holmes\\" as \\"that imbecile\\", as opposed to Watson, whom he grudgingly respects. * Anthony Andrews appeared as Moriarty in Hands of a Murderer (1990). * In the anime film Case Closed: The Phantom of Baker Street (2002), Professor Moriarty tells Conan that he trained Jack the Ripper when Jack was a street urchin. * Vincent D'Onofrio appeared as Moriarty in the TV movie Sherlock: Case of Evil (2002). * In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), the film adaptation of the graphic novel by Alan Moore, Richard Roxburgh portrays the main antagonist named the Phantom, whose true identity was eventually revealed to be Professor James Moriarty.

The role was voiced by the film's dialect coach, Andrew Jackhttp://andrewjack.com/career/ (although director Guy Ritchie refused to reveal his identity). Jared Harris played the role in the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows.\\"And In Other Film Deals...\\", deadline.com, September 2010; accessed 28 September 2010. In the second film, Moriarty and Holmes attend a European Peace Conference held near the Reichenbach Falls which Moriarty seeks to sabotage, and the two plunge down from a balcony overlooking the falls, Holmes being too injured to defeat Moriarty in a straight fight but knowing that Moriarty will go after Watson if he lives. While Holmes is shown to have survived, Moriarty's fate is less certain. * Jamie Demetriou voiced a pie mascot version of Moriarty in the 2018 animated film Sherlock Gnomes. * Ralph Fiennes portrayed Moriarty in the 2018 film Holmes & Watson, a comedic take on the Holmes and Watson characters. While the film was criticised, many fans complimented the presence Fiennes created as Moriarty. Television * John Huston portrayed Moriarty in the made-for-TV movie Sherlock Holmes in New York (1976) opposite Roger Moore's Holmes, attempting to rob the international gold exchange in New York while threatening Irene Adler‚Äôs son to prevent Holmes from investigating, although Holmes and Watson are able to rescue the son and solve the crime regardless, forcing Moriarty to flee after a last attempt to kidnap Irene's son after Holmes exposes the truth behind the crime and is able to arrange for the rest of Moriarty's American forces to be arrested. * In the Soviet series of television films The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (1979‚Äì1986) by Igor Maslennikov, Moriarty was played by Viktor Yevgrafov and voiced by Oleg Dahl in the second film of the series, also titled The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson (1980). The film is made of three episodes: \\"The King of Blackmail\\" (based on \\"The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton\\"), \\"Deadly Fight\\" (based on \\"The Final Problem\\") and \\"The Tiger Hunt\\" (based on \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\"). * An anthropomorphic incarnation of Moriarty appeared in the anime series Sherlock Hound (1984‚Äì1985), voiced by Chikao ≈åtsuka for Japanese and Hamilton Camp for English. During the series, Moriarty is the main antagonist behind every crime in almost each episode. As the characters were depicted as anthropomorphic dogs, Moriarty himself is seen closely resembling a wolf. *Eric Porter portrayed Moriarty in three episodes of the TV series Sherlock Holmes (1984‚Äì1994), starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes: \\"The Red-Headed League\\" (1985) \\"The Final Problem\\" (1985) and \\"The Empty House\\" (1986). The three episodes in question are the last two of the first series, known as The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, and the first one of the second series, known as The Return of Sherlock Holmes. Stock footage of Moriarty also appeared as a hallucination in the episode \\"The Devil's Foot\\" (1988), also from the second series. In the feature-length episode The Eligible Bachelor (1993), adapted from \\"The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\\", Holmes describes Moriarty as \\"a giant of evil\\" and says, \\"I regret Moriarty's death [because] without him, I have to deal with distressed children, cat-owners‚Äîpygmies, pygmies of triviality. You see, Moriarty combined science with evil. Organization with precision. Vision with perception. I know of only one person that he misjudged. Me.\\" The episode is part of the third series, known as The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes. * Moriarty appeared in two episodes of the animated series BraveStarr (1987‚Äì1988), voiced by Jonathan Harris. * A holodeck simulation of Professor Moriarty, played by actor Daniel Davis, appeared in the Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987‚Äì1994) episodes \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" (1988) and \\"Ship in a Bottle\\" (1993), accidentally achieving an artificial sentience when Geordi La Forge asks the holodeck to create an opponent able to defeat Data (rather than Sherlock Holmes). * \\"Elementary My Dear Winston\\", the third episode for the 1989 season of The Real Ghostbusters (1986‚Äì1992), features Holmes, Watson and Moriarty (voiced by Alan Shearman, Maurice LaMarche, and Rodger Bumpass, respectively) by way of \\"belief made manifest\\": so many people believed in them that they became real. Moriarty now has supernatural powers and employs the Hound of the Baskervilles as his henchman. Holmes and Moriarty are both sucked into the Ghostbusters' storage facility while wrestling, in the same manner as the conclusion of \\"The Final Problem\\". * In the animated series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century (1999‚Äì2001), Moriarty (voiced by Richard Newman) was the villain behind nearly all of the crimes. He had been cloned back to life by a rogue geneticist, requiring Holmes to be \\"resurrected\\" as well in order to match him. The body of the original Moriarty was still frozen in ice behind the waterfall that he fell from during his battle with Holmes. * Moriarty appears as a holographic character in the Futurama (1999‚Äì2013) episode \\"Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch\\" (2003), where he comes out of the Holoshed of the Nimbus with Attila the Hun, Jack The Ripper, and Evil (Abraham) Lincoln. * Jim Moriarty is played by actor Andrew Scott in the modern-day BBC adaptation, Sherlock (2010‚Äìpresent), as a psychopathic \\"consulting criminal\\" who develops a murderous obsession with Holmes. He appears behind the scenes for most of the first two seasons, creating a series of apparent suicides and then setting up a sequence of events where Holmes must solve key mysteries before people are blown up by timed bomb vests, culminating in a confrontation in a swimming pool that is cut short by an unexplained phone call that prompts Moriarty to depart to deal with other matters. In the Series 2 finale \\"The Reichenbach Fall\\" (2012), he briefly assumes the identity of Richard Brook (\\"Reicher Bach\\" in German), creating the illusion that Holmes is behind his crimes and paid him to assume the role of Moriarty. Through this he destroys Holmes' reputation and also threatens his friends in order to drive Holmes to suicide. He himself commits suicide in the climax of the episode, but, at the end of the later episode \\"His Last Vow\\" (2014), his face appears on TV screens across the country. Although Holmes spends most of the subsequent special (\\"The Abominable Bride\\", 2016) in an elaborate hallucination of a similar case in 1895 to try to determine how Moriarty might have survived, he eventually concludes that Moriarty is genuinely dead, but had planned in advance to have others carry out his plans after his own death. During \\"The Six Thatchers\\" (2017), Holmes states his confidence that Moriarty's plans will go into action at some future date, but makes it clear that he will currently act as normal as he is certain that Moriarty's trap will make itself obvious when the time is right. The episode ‚ÄúThe Final Problem‚Äù reveals that, prior to his death, Moriarty had conspired with the true mastermind of the plot, Sherlock‚Äôs sister Eurus. * In the US television series Elementary (2012‚Äìpresent), Moriarty is a composite character with Irene Adler (played by Natalie Dormer). As with Moriarty, she is first mentioned in the 12th episode of the first season (\\"M\\", 2013). Holmes tracks an apparent serial killer who uses the name \\"M\\"; upon his capture, he is discovered to be Sebastian Moran, Moriarty's henchman, whose seemingly random murders were actually assassinations carried out for his employer, whom he claims to have never met. In the season finale, \\"Irene Adler\\" is revealed to be an alias created by Moriarty in order to get close to Holmes and observe him (a male voice who spoke to Holmes as \\"Moriarty\\" over the telephone is revealed to be a hired actor). The episode \\"We Are Everyone\\" (2013) reveals her true name as Jamie Moriarty and she continues to write letters to Holmes from prison. She briefly escapes prison to assist in an investigation of a kidnapping of a girl who is revealed to be her daughter, abducted by the man who acted as Moriarty in past conversations, but willingly returns to custody after her daughter is safe. Despite being in prison, she later arranges for a ruthless crime boss to be assassinated after the woman attempts to kill Holmes‚Äô assistant Joan Watson, sending her a letter to confirm her involvement. In the last episodes of Season Four, Holmes and Watson meet the father of Moriarty's child, who has taken over her organization after her incarceration. He is arrested thanks to the actions of Sherlock's father Morland, who takes over the operation in order to dismantle it from within and ensure that none of its assets can be used against his son. By the time of the final episode of the series, Morland is dead, Moriarty's organisation basically disbanded, and Moriarty herself is presumed by the government to be dead, although Holmes expresses doubts about this even after attending her funeral. * In the Russian-produced Sherlock Holmes (2013) series by Andrey Kavun, Moriarty was played by actor Alexey Gorbunov. Moriarty is a mathematics professor who attempts to assassinate the Queen. He appeared as the head of a London-wide criminal network called \\"The Cabmen Gang\\". * In the NHK puppetry Sherlock Holmes (2014‚Äìpresent), Moriarty is the tall and blond deputy headmaster of Beeton School where Holmes and Watson study and live, and has a face with two different aspects: one of which looks calm but the other looks severe. Though he always behaves gentlemanly, he is strict with pupils, especially Holmes, who behaves at his own pace.Shinjiro Okazaki and Kenichi Fujita (ed.), \\"„Ç∑„É£„Éº„É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éõ„Éº„É†„Ç∫ÂÜíÈô∫„Éï„Ç°„É≥„Éñ„ÉÉ„ÇØ ShƒÅrokku H≈çmuzu B≈çken Fan Bukku\\", Tokyo: Shogakukan, 2014, p. 13 He usually calls a pupil by his/her given name and surname; for example, he calls Watson \\"John Hamish Watson\\".\\"Sherlock Holmes\\" production team (Ed.), \\"NHK „Ç∑„É£„Éº„É≠„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Éõ„Éº„É†„Ç∫Êé®ÁêÜ„Éñ„ÉÉ„ÇØ Mystery quiz book of Sherlock Holmes\\", Tokyo:Shufu to seikatsu sha, 2014, p. 57 He is voiced by Masashi Ebara. * Moriarty is a recurring character in season 2 of The Librarians (2014‚Äì2018), where is he is played by David S. Lee. Here, Moriarty has been brought to life by Prospero of William Shakespeare‚Äôs The Tempest, and is forced to serve as his strategist. Though he maintains his loyalty to Prospero throughout the season, he eventually betrays him in the final episode, only to be banished back to his story as punishment. At the last second, he reveals that the only way to beat Prospero is to destroy his staff. *James Moriarty is a recurring character in Case File n¬∫221: Kabukicho. He is voiced by: Seiichir≈ç Yamashita (Japanese); Justin Briner (English). * In HBO Asia/Hulu's re-imagining Miss Sherlock, Moriarty is first mentioned in episode six under the name Akira Moriwaki, and is believed to be behind the events of most of the series. Episode seven reveals Moriwaki to be Wato's (the Watson analogue) middle-aged female psychiatrist, Dr. Mariko Irikawa. Literature * In Nicholas Meyer's 1974 revisionist novel, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, Moriarty is portrayed as Holmes' childhood mathematics tutor, a whining little man with a guilty secret. He is incensed to hear that Holmes, apparently under the influence of cocaine, has depicted him as a criminal mastermind. Due to Holmes' worsening condition, Moriarty threatens to tell the authorities about Holmes' addiction. Dr. Watson seeks the help of Sigmund Freud, who uncovers the truth behind Holmes' perception of \\"the Napoleon of Crime\\". This is one of many works to seize on the fact that Moriarty never actually shows his face in the Holmes canon. The novel was made into a 1976 film and starred Laurence Olivier as a very different sort of Professor Moriarty. * John Gardner has written three novels featuring the arch-villain: The Return of Moriarty (1974), in which the Professor, like Holmes, is shown to have survived the meeting at the Reichenbach, The Revenge of Moriarty (1975) and Moriarty (released posthumously in 2008 after the author's death in 2007). In these novels, Moriarty is depicted as a Victorian-era Al Capone or Don Corleone, who single-handedly controls London's organised crime structure. \\"The Professor\\" is not really Moriarty, but Moriarty's younger brother, also named James, and as brilliant as his older brother, whom he impersonates, disgraces and murders, later stealing the deceased's identity. * Kim Newman used Moriarty as a minor character in the first volume of his Anno Dracula (1992) series; he claims to have given up his criminal interests, in the face of Count Dracula's increasing domination of London, and become a vampire in order to have infinite time to pursue his mathematical researches. Newman later wrote a series of short stories about Moriarty, narrated Watson-style by Colonel Moran, in which Moriarty interacts with many of his fictional contemporaries. They have been collected in Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles (2011). One of the stories, \\"The Red Planet League\\", first appeared in Gaslight Grimoire. Another story, \\"The Adventure of the Greek Invertebrate\\" (a play on \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\", which introduced Sherlock Holmes' brother Mycroft), features Professor Moriarty's two brothers, also named James, the colonel and the station master, and offers an explanation for the lack of variety in their forenames. The last story, \\"The Problem of the Final Adventure\\", is a revisionist retelling of \\"The Adventure of the Final Problem\\" from the other side. * Moriarty appears in a short story by Donald Serrell Thomas, in his collection The Secret Cases of Sherlock Holmes (1997), as the mastermind of a blackmail plot involving the alleged bigamy of Prince George. His younger brother, Col. James Moriarty, appears as the antagonist of another short story in Thomas' The Execution of Sherlock Holmes (2007). * Michael Kurland has written a series of five novels (The Infernal Device, Death by Gaslight, The Great Game, The Empress of India, and Who Thinks Evil) and four short stories featuring Moriarty. * Moriarty appears in Alan Moore's comic book series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (1999‚Äìpresent). Recruited from university by British Intelligence, he supposedly set up his criminal empire as part of an undercover operation to monitor crime in London which got out of hand, to the point where the 'cover' became more real to Moriarty than his role in British Intelligence. Having survived the encounter with Holmes, he went on to become head of British Intelligence under the code- name \\"M\\" but still maintained his criminal interests. He instigated the creation of the League as a covert ops unit with plausible deniability and used them to recover an anti-gravity mineral called Cavorite which had been stolen by his crimelord rival the Doctor. He used the Cavorite to bomb the East End of London in an attempt to destroy the Doctor but was thwarted by the League which had uncovered the double-cross. Following his supposed death (indicated, but not clearly portrayed, as he \\"falls\\" into the sky while clutching the Cavorite), he was ironically succeeded as \\"M\\" by Mycroft Holmes, Sherlock's older brother. In The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, it is suggested that Jack Kerouac's Dean Moriarty (from On the Road) is his great-grandson, and the rivalry between the two criminals is continued by the fact that the Doctor's great-grandson is Kerouac's other creation, Doctor Sax. In the third volume, set more than six decades later, Mina Murray comes across his carcass, still holding on to the Cavorite, inside a block of ice floating through space. * In The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes (1999), set during Holmes' three-year fake \\"death\\", Holmes encounters Moriarty during his trip in Tibet, where he learns that Moriarty is actually \\"the Dark One\\", a former Tibetan mystic possessing great psychic powers who lost his memories in an attack on the Dalai Lama, only for his near-death experience on the Reichenbach Falls to restore his memory, albeit leaving him horribly crippled and disfigured by his injuries. He attempts to acquire a legendary crystal that would allow him to wield even greater power, but, although Moriarty acquires the crystal, boosting his powers and healing his injuries, he is defeated when it is revealed that Holmes is partly possessed by the spirit of the Dark One's old rival. Sharing the spirit of a former llama allows Holmes to wield similar powers to Moriarty's, utilizing these mental powers to delay his old enemy long enough for Holmes' ally, Huree Chunder Mockerjee, to knock the crystal away from Moriarty and into Holmes' hands, giving Holmes the power to turn Moriarty's own abilities against him, vaporising Moriarty's body and destroying him once and for all. * In Neil Gaiman's short story \\"A Study in Emerald\\" (2003), the Moriarty and Holmes of an alternate history reverse roles. Moriarty (who, although never named as such in the story, is identified as the author of Dynamics of an Asteroid) is hired to investigate a murder. The murder has apparently been carried out by Sherlock Holmes (who signs his name Rache, an allusion to Doyle's first novel starring Holmes and Watson, A Study in Scarlet, in which \\"Rache\\"‚ÄîGerman for \\"revenge\\"‚Äîis found written above the body of a murder victim) and Dr. Watson. The story is narrated by Colonel Sebastian Moran, given the rank of Major (Ret.) by Gaiman. * In a 2006 comic book story featuring Lee Falk's The Phantom, the 19th Phantom has to fight Moriarty; the climax of the story features the Phantom and Moriarty falling down a waterfall in the Bangalla jungle. At the end of the story, Moriarty is shown to be alive, as he returns to London to find \\"a detective named Sherlock Holmes\\". * In the comic series Victorian Undead (2010), Holmes and Watson must face a 'reborn' Moriary as he unleashes a zombie plague on London, having survived his own death via a modified zombie formula that allows Moriarty to retain his intellect despite his deathly state. * In Paco Ignacio Taibo II's \\"The Return of the Tigers of Malaysia\\" (2010), Dr James Moriarty appears as the mastermind behind the attacks on Sandokan and his friend Yanez. * In Anthony Horowitz' 2011 novel The House of Silk, a chapter is dedicated to Watson's meeting with a secretive criminal mastermind. This character is not definitively identified, however it is heavily implied that he is Moriarty. Watson later states that he believes this to be the case, and in an appendix Horowitz states the identity of the character outright. Moriarty also appears as a corpse in Moriarty, the 2014 sequel to this novel, in which Pinkerton detective Frederick Chase is investigating the events that took place at the Reichenbach Falls. * In The Thinking Engine (2015) by James Lovegrove, set in 1895‚Äîspecifically at the same time as the events of \\"The Adventure of the Three Students\\"‚ÄîHolmes is called to challenge the Thinking Engine, an early computer that is seemingly capable of solving crimes using the same deductive abilities as Holmes himself. As the novel unfolds, Holmes realizes that every case the Engine has been called on to solve was committed by a perpetrator who had to be assisted by someone else to come up with such an intellectual scheme. In the final confrontation, Holmes and his allies realize that the Thinking Engine is actually a hollow construct with Moriarty inside it; he survived the confrontation at the Reichenbach Falls as he was wearing a specially designed body armour that protected his vital organs, although his limbs were so injured that his legs and one arm have been amputated and he can still barely speak on his own due to damage to his larynx. With his deception exposed, Moriarty apparently dies due to complications of the drugs being used to medicate his injuries, although it is strongly implied that Holmes gave him a deliberate overdose to prevent the risk of a trial allowing Moriarty to escape again. * In Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell (2016) by Paul Kane, it is revealed that Moriarty was able to escape his demise by using an incantation to transfer himself into the realm of the Cenobites, where he is transformed into the 'Engineer' of the Cenobites, intending to mount a new assault on Earth. Holmes is able to make a deal with the master Cenobites to transform himself into a Cenobite to oppose Moriarty's forces, the final confrontation seeing Moriarty destroyed once again, while Watson is able to make his own deal to restore Holmes to normal. * In The Cthulhu Casebooks by James Lovegrove, presenting an alternate version of Holmes' cases where he and Watson regularly faced the Great Old Ones of H. P. Lovecraft's work, Moriarty is the antagonist of the first novel, Sherlock Holmes and the Shadwell Shadows (2016), set in 1881, where he attempts various sacrifices to win the aid of the old god Nyarlathotep, but is drawn in by his would-be god when he attempts to sacrifice Holmes, Watson, Mycroft and Gregson, although Holmes speculates that he has some plan to return. ** In the sequel, Sherlock Holmes and the Miskatonic Monstrosities (2017), Holmes and Watson learn in 1896 that Moriarty's willing sacrifice of himself to Nyarlathotep gave him the strength of will to consume his would-be god's power for himself, leading some of the other Outer Gods against the Old Ones in preparation for an assault on Earth due to his greater ambition and drive. Holmes and Watson are able to defeat Moriarty's current assault by destroying his human agent, but they are each aware that Moriarty will return. ** In the conclusion of the trilogy, Sherlock Holmes and the Sussex Sea-Devils, set in 1910, after killing Mycroft Holmes and various other old allies of Sherlock with his mortal agents, Moriarty captures Holmes and Watson with the intention of taking them to witness his destruction of Cthulhu's physical form as his Outer God forces destroy Cthulhu's mind on the higher planes, which he believes will allow him to kill Cthulhu and ensure his own dominance. However, Holmes had secretly made a deal with Cthulhu years ago to maintain his own vitality while hunting Cthulhu's enemies on this plane, and when Holmes grants permission for Cthulhu to take back what was given, it gives Cthulhu such a power boost that he recovers from the injuries inflicted by Moriarty's efforts, with the two last shown engaging in a physical struggle as they ascend into the higher planes. Video games * In the computer adventure Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened (2007), Holmes encounters Moriarty locked in a Switzerland mental hospital in 1895 (four years after \\"The Final Problem\\"), where the Professor has suffered severe brain injuries from the Falls. Not recognising Holmes in disguise, Moriarty is tricked into thinking his nemesis is in the hospital lobby, and charges from his cell in a frenzy, giving Holmes a diversion so he may investigate the asylum's secrets further. * In Sherlock Holmes versus Ars√®ne Lupin, or Sherlock Holmes: Nemesis, there has been no word of any mental recovery or escape attempts by Moriarty. Holmes remarks to Watson, \\"If there had, we would be on the way to Switzerland already.\\" * Moriarty returns in The Testament of Sherlock Holmes (2012), as the main antagonist who tries to frame Holmes and create anarchy in response for being tricked by Holmes in the Black Edelweiss Institute in Switzerland. * In Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter (2016), Moriarty's death continues to haunt Holmes due to the fact that Sherlock adopted Moriarty's daughter Katelyn and is living in fear of her discovering the truth about her biological father and following in his footsteps. After Kate is kidnapped Holmes discovers Moriarty's crypt and a message he left for Kate where it's revealed Moriarty anticipated both his death and Kate's adoption, he attempts to convince her to turn against Holmes and continue his work. * In the mobile game Fate/Grand Order (2015), Moriarty is an Archer class Servant and the antagonist of the Shinjuku chapter. His alias is Archer of Shinjuku. * In the massive-multiplayer role-playing online game Wizard101 (2008) there is a character based on Moriarty, named \\"Meowiarty\\". * Although he doesn't properly make an appearance in it, the videogame Dai Gyakuten Saiban 2: Naruhod≈ç Ry≈´nosuke no Kakugo (2017) features a serial killer named \\"The Professor\\", in an allusion to Moriarty.

He was the main adviser to three successive kings of Ava: Swa Saw Ke, Tarabya and Minkhaung I. Under his guidance, Ava made several attempts to restore the Pagan Empire, and methodically acquired its immediate surrounding Shan states between 1371 and 1406. By his death in 1421, he had advised his kings almost for the entire duration of the Forty Years' War (1385‚Äì1424) between Ava and Pegu. The influential court treatise Zabu Kun-Cha, which includes Machiavellian political principles, and mentions several archaeologically known Pyu settlements unmentioned in other prior Burmese chronicles, is attributed to Min Yaza. Early life Yaza was born Nga Nyo (, ) to Daw Chon (, ) and her herbalist physician husband Saya Ohn (·ÄÜ·Äõ·Ä¨ ·Ä°·ÄØ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏, ) in 1347/48.Sandalinka 2009: i, footnote 2Khin Maung Nyunt 2016: 8 His parents were athi commoners‚Äîthose who did not live on royal land and paid substantial taxes but owed no regular military service.(Lieberman 2003: 113) His zata or Burmese zodiac name was Maung Okka \\"Mr. Meteor\\" (, ) because a sizable meteor passed through the night he was born. Nyo grew up in his native village of Wun Zin, about from Meiktila. He began his primary education at a local monastic school where proved to be a brilliant student, mastering all the subjects in just two years. His father died 1355, and his mother sent the 7-year-old to another monastic school for further education. By his teens, he was already collecting manuscripts, copying stone inscriptions and ink writings at local temples and pagodas, and participating in literary seminars alongside adults. At 14, he began tilling the fields as a farmer but he continued to pursue his hobbies of historical research and book collecting. He became well known in the region as \\"Sa To Nga Nyo\\" (Nyo the literary works collector). In his late teens, he married Me Chit, daughter of the village headman, U Moe. According to legend, his father-in-law had a rather low opinion of Nyo whom he deemed a talker and not a hardworking farmer. Nonetheless, Moe gave the couple a pair of cattle and three pes (2.13 hectares) of paddy fields, and allowed them to stay at his farmhouse.MSK 1979: 362 Royal service =Joining the service= Nyo's opportunity to escape the village life came when he was 20. In 1368, King Swa Saw Ke came to the Meiktila region with an army of men to restore the broken levee of the Meiktila Lake. When the king inquired about the small golden statue of a young woman in what appeared to be a nat shrine on the embankment, the locals referred Nyo to the king as someone who might know the answer. Summoned before the king, Nyo explained that based on his research the statue was donated by King Anawrahta (r. 1044‚Äì77) of Pagan in memory of his young/junior queen consort,Exact Burmese term per (MSK 1979: 362) was ·Äô·Ä≠·Äñ·ÄØ·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÑ·Äö·Ä∫, which could mean a junior queen, young queen, or both. who died at the location, and that Anawrahta had also buried another statue underneath the embankment. A skeptical Swa had his men dig beneath the shrine, and the men found another female statue as Nyo predicted. Impressed by the villager's command of history and knowledge, Swa asked Nyo to enter the royal service. Nyo, his wife and his father-in-law were all brought to the capital Ava (Inwa). =Swa Saw Ke years= At Ava, Nyo quickly made his mark. Though he started out as a low-level clerk at the court, Nyo came to be consulted for advice by the king. About a year later, a junior minister at the court died, and Swa appointed Nyo to the position, which came with the title of Sitapyit (·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äê·Äï·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫, ). Though still only in his early twenties, Nyo quickly rose to be the main adviser to the king on the strength of his early advice proving right. His firstwell-known advice recorded in the Burmese chronicles concerned Ava's northern policy. The king, who wished restore the erstwhile Pagan Empire, eyed the various Shan states that now surrounded his Ava Kingdom from the northwest to the southeast. In 1370/71, two northern Shan states of Kalay and Mohnyin were at war, and Nyo advised the king to march to the two states only after they had fought it out and were left exhausted. The king followed the advice, and was able to take over both states in 1371.MSK 1979: 363 When Mohnyin was retaken by the Shan state of Maw soon after the Ava armies left, he advised the king not to overstretch, and redraw Ava's northern border farther south to a more defensible Myedu. In 1372‚Äì73, Maw forces attacked Myedu to reclaim Mohnyin's former territory but were decisively defeated by Ava forces.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 409 The decisive victory brought Upper Burma a respite from Maw raids for the next 14 years.(Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 199): Mohnyin raided again while Ava was deep in the Forty Years' War, forcing Swa to launch a campaign against Mohnyin in 1387‚Äì88. The king relied on the minister for advice on all major decisions for the rest of his reign. He promoted Nyo to chief minister in 1379/80 with the title of Min Yaza.(MSK 1979: 363) (Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 211) (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 442‚Äì443): Chronicles say that he received the title of Min Yaza during the reign of King Minkhaung I. But according to the inscription at the Buddhist pagoda the minister himself donated at the Eingon village per (Khin Maung Nyunt 2016: 8‚Äì9), he was bestowed the title of Min Yaza in 741 ME (30 March 1379 ‚Äì 28 March 1380) in his 32nd year (age 31). The same inscription says that he entered King Swa's service in his 21st year (age 20). To be sure, not all of his advice turned out right. In 1380/81 (or 1383/84),This is another case of Burmese numerals ·ÅÇ (2) and ·ÅÖ (5) being miscopied: Main chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 410‚Äì413) say Saw Mon died in 742 ME (1380/81). But Mani Yadanabon (Mani Yadanabon 2009: 62) says he died in 745 ME (1383/84). he advised against the king's top four nominees for the western kingdom of Arakan's throne, and agreed to Saw Me as the candidate.See (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 414‚Äì415) and (Mani Yadanabon 2009: 62‚Äì63) for Yaza's recommendations for the next king of Arakan. According to (Harvey 1925: 86), the nominee was Swa's own son by the daughter of Yaza. But the chronicles (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 414‚Äì415) do not list Saw Me as a son; they mention him as a long-time loyal servant of Swa. Moreover, according to the chronicles, Swa met Yaza only in 1368/69 (730 ME) and never mentioned Swa being married to Yaza's daughters. Even if Swa had married Yaza's daughter in 1368, their son would only be about 11 years old in 1380. Saw Me turned out to be a tyrant, and was driven out of Arakan in 1385/86.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 414‚Äì415Mani Yadanabon 2009: 63 Likewise, his advice to the king to accept the offer of Gov. Laukpya of Myaungmya to attack the Hanthawaddy Kingdom resulted in three failed campaigns between 1385 and 1391.See (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 290‚Äì293, 295‚Äì297, 300‚Äì302) for Ava's first three failed campaigns of the Forty Years' War. =Minkhaung years= After King Swa's death in 1400, Min Yaza continued his role as chief minister under the new king, Tarabya. But Tarabya's reign lasted only seven months; the new king was assassinated in November 1400. The court led by Yaza placed Prince Minkhaung, Swa's son by a concubine, on the throne (although the court's selection was later unsuccessfully challenged by Gov. Maha Pyauk of Yamethin).Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 439 A grateful Minkhaung kept Yaza as the chief minister, whom he called \\"grandpa\\". He also appointed Yaza's son Pauk Hla governor Yamethin, and Yaza's son-in-law Thado Theinkhathu governor of Badon and Tabayin.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 441‚Äì443According to (Mani Yadanabon 2009: 191), Yaza had another son who was governor of Yenantha. But Mani does not mention when that son was appointed. Yaza was now fully part of the power structure of the Ava regime. The old minister advised Minkhaung during the difficult early years (1401‚Äì02) when the country came under attack by Razadarit.Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 213, 218 Ava survived the invasion, and Yaza led the Ava delegation that negotiated a truce in early 1403.(Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 220‚Äì221): Attempts to reach a truce began about 10 days after Ava forces defeated Pegu forces at the battle of Nawin near Prome on Tuesday, 3rd waxing of Tabodwe 764 ME (26 December 1402). It means the first attempt to negotiate began around 5 January 1403. Though not a military man, Yaza was officially the commander of the army that accompanied the delegation to the Hanthawaddy capital Pegu (Bago).Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 469‚Äì470 In all, he and his delegation spent five months in Pegu. King Razadarit was impressed by the old minister's intellect, and gave a daughter of a Hanthawaddy minister in marriage. Yaza and the young wife had a child, Saw Yin, later governor of Badon. Back in Ava, Yaza guided Minkhaung who set out on acquiring the surrounding states in the following years. He personally led the 1404/05 embassy to Onbaung (Hsipaw) that resulted in Onbaung's submission. He got the neighboring Nyaungshwe and Mohnyin to submit in 1405/06 and 1406 respectively.Chronicles (Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 224‚Äì225) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 445‚Äì446, 467) say that Nyaungshwe and Mohnyin submitted in 767 ME (1405/06) and 768 ME (1406/07) respectively. According to Ming records, per (Fernquest 2006: 51), Ava had acquired Bhamo, Mohnyin, and Kalay by 25 August 1406 when the Ming court sent an envoy to Ava in response. (Ava also acquired Arakan in 1406 but the main chronicles do not explicitly mention Yaza or the court in the invasion decision.) Nonetheless, Yaza apparently was the power behind the throne: the king accepted his chief minister's recommendations for governorships at Kalay and Mohnyin. He advised Minkhaung to appoint Kye Taung Nyo, the eldest son of Minkhaung's predecessor Tarabya to the faraway Shan state of Kalay (by the Manipur border)Yazawin Thit Vol. 1 2012: 224‚Äì225 while advising the appointment of Thado, a proven commander, to the crucial northern Shan state of Mohnyin.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 467 The year 1406 was apparently the pinnacle of Yaza's influence. After Crown Prince Minye Kyawswa's successful 1406 Arakan campaign, Minkhaung increasingly relied on his highly militaristic son for policy. For his part, Yaza carried on. In 1406, at the king's behest, Yaza unsuccessfully tried to mollify Theiddat, who believed he should have been the heir-apparent. The minister persuaded Minkhaung not to execute his younger brother but Theiddat defected to Hanthawaddy soon after.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 472‚Äì473 In April 1408, Minkhaung famously ignored Yaza's advice to wait until after the rainy season to invade Hanthawaddy, which had driven out the Ava appointed king from Arakan and taken Minkhaung's daughter captive.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 476‚Äì477 Yaza accompanied Minkhaung to the front. After three months, the Ava armies were bogged down in the rainy season weather, and were starving. Minkhaung sent Yaza and Yaza's son Sithu of Yamethin to negotiate a truce but the Ava delegation retreated after suspecting an ambush attempt by Hanthawaddy troops.Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 480 According to the chronicles, after the disastrous invasion, Min Yaza had to persuade the king to reappoint the latter's favorite queen Shin Bo-Me, who was temporarily lost during the disastrous retreat, as a senior queen again. Minkhaung had demoted her because he suspected she had become involved with the mahout who found her, and brought back to Ava. Minkhaung accepted Yaza's advice. A restored Bo-Me was grateful; she gave the old minister lavish gifts.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 1‚Äì3 It was the last mention of Yaza before his death in the standard chronicles. His last advice to the king recorded in the court treatise Mani Yadanabon came in 1413/14 (775 ME).Mani Yadanabon 2009: 181 Min Yaza died in 1421 at 73, a few months before Minkhaung's own death.Chronicles (Maha Yazawin Vol. 2 2006: 55) and (Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 51) say that Yaza died in 783 ME (30 March 1421 to 29 March 1422). But he apparently died in early-to-mid 783 ME (1421) as Minkhaung was still alive for several more months. Yaza's age of 73 is per (Khin Maung Nyunt 2016: 8‚Äì9), which however is inconsistent; it says the minister was born in 1347 and died in 1423 in his 74th year. But according to the Eingon Shwezigon Pagoda inscription donated by Yaza himself, the minister was in his 32nd year (aged 31) in 741 ME (30 March 1379 to 28 March 1380), meaning he was born in either 1347 or 1348, and could not have been in his 74th year in 1423. Writer The influential court treatise Zabu Kun-Cha is attributed to Min Yaza.Aung-Thwin 2005: 123Wade 2012: 124 The treatise is a compilation of the famous advice offered by Yaza to kings from Swa Saw Ke to Minkhaung. The text also includes a section on early history of Myanmar, which mentions several settlements across Myanmar that map to the archaeologically known Pyu settlements.Hudson 2004: 30 According to Hudson, the author(s) of Zabu (Min Yaza or otherwise) knew that \\"the sites they listed all had some kind of archaeological evidence of antiquity. Kaungsin, Allagappa and Legaing, not prominent in other chronicles, were known to the author(s) when the Zabu was written.\\"Hudson 2004: 29 The Zabu was later included in the 1781 treatise Mani Yadanabon, which also includes advice by later ministers. The Zabu portion represents \\"somewhat half under the total\\".Lieberman 1983: 137 The Zabu portion has been described as \\"a repository of historical examples illustrating pragmatic political principles worthy of Machiavelli.\\"Woolf 2011: 416 In popular culture Min Yaza is best remembered in Burmese history for his encounter with Minister Thihapate of Hanthawaddy during the first truce negotiations between Ava and Pegu in 1403. Yaza recounted in Zabu how his counterpart bested him in an impromptu philosophical debate in which Thihapate argued in support of the concept of carpe diem, and Yaza argued for delayed gratification. After a respectful and polite exchange, Yaza conceded his defeat.Mani Yadanabon 2009: 126‚Äì127 In 1912, a biography of the minister, called Wun Zin Po Yaza Wuthtu was published by Maung Maung, a school headmaster of Prome (Pyay).Tun Aung Chain 2004: 164, 179 The Fine and Performing Arts Department produced a traditional Burmese opera titled \\"Wun Zin Po Yaza\\", which was performed between 1965 and 1973 in Myanmar as well as abroad.Khin Maung Nyunt 2016: 9 Commemorations * Wun Zin Min Yaza Hall, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Yangon * Po Yaza Street, Yankin Township and North Dagon Township, Yangon * Po Yaza Street, Mandalay Notes References Bibliography    1340s births 1421 deaths Government ministers of Myanmar Burmese writers People from Mandalay Region ","title":"Min Yaza of Wun Zin"},{"id":"51523703","text":"Maryam Garba (born 7 August 1995) is a handball goalkeeper from France who plays for Paris 92.

FFO is a performance indicator created by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) that is recognized by the SEC to be the standard non-GAAP gauge of financial performance for the real estate sector. Analysts calculate the standard version of FFO by adding amortization and depreciation to net income, and subtracting any gains made on the sale of assets. There are other forms of FFO that the SEC requires real estate companies to report such as the adjusted FFO, company FFO, and others. No matter the type of FFO they use, public companies are required to disclose their FFO on their income statement. Investors can use the FFO to determine the financial performance of a real estate company. Unlike other accounting methods, the FFO attempts to remove distortion caused by traditional GAAP accounting methods. Using the FFO allows companies to more accurately state their performance. Often, the FFO is divided by a per-share basis for securities that are publicly traded. Investors frequently utilize the FFO per- share ratio much like they would utilize the EPS of company.

Though often performed at Tennessee Volunteers football games, it is not the official fight song of the University of Tennessee (Down the Field).

Parton also reminisced on her rural childhood in her 1984 song, Tennessee Homesick Blues. East Tennessee Blues, written in 1926 by Charlie Bowman, (from Gray), continues to be a popular bluegrass song. Please Come to Boston, recorded and written in 1974 by Dave Loggins, has been covered by many artists, including David Allan Coe and Joan Baez. The song concludes with the line, \\"I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee.\\" Loggins, born in Mountain City in 1947, is the second cousin of singer Kenny Loggins. Chattanooga Choo Choo, originally published in 1941, tells the story of a train trip to Chattanooga. In 1957, the British musician Lonnie Donegan had a No. 1 UK hit with a skiffle version of \\"Cumberland Gap\\". In addition, Dixieland Delight, released by Alabama in 1983, was inspired by a highway drive through Rutledge, Tennessee. Davy Crockett The Ballad of Davy Crockett helped to popularize the 1955 film Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier. First recorded and introduced on the television series Disneyland in 1954, it has been covered by a number of artists, most notably Tennessee Ernie Ford. The song's lyrics say Crockett was \\"born on a mountaintop in Tennessee\\", but his actual birthplace was Limestone, Tennessee, the home of Davy Crockett Birthplace State Park.http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/t/theballadofdavycrockett.shtml In addition to his renowned frontier exploits and military service, Crockett served East Tennessee as a state legislator and Congressman. Daniel Boone The folk hero Daniel Boone, who helped explore East Tennessee, was honored in the soundtrack for the television series Daniel Boone, which ran from 1964 until 1970.http://lyricsplayground.com/alpha/songs/d/danielboone.shtmlhttps://vimeo.com/22152238?lite=1https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hwqdQ0SkjQ The last of three versions of the theme song was sung by The Imperials, a Grammy-winning Christian music group.

The expansion of Logan Airport in the late 1960s and early 1970s displaced families along Neptune Road, which is now used for warehouses and rental car property. As the airport expanded, planes flew in low over the residential blocks and conflicts with airport officials escalated. Wood Island Park was leveled early one morning in 1967. On April 23, 1969, 35 workmen with 35 chain saws toppled 35 elms along the road. The Massachusetts Port Authority, under the reign of then-director and later Governor of Massachusetts Edward J. King, seized by eminent domain some of the street, and evicted families with the help of US Marshalls. The airport has since implemented four \\"airport edge buffers,\\" which include parks and greenery. Some of Boston's last surviving elm trees are still located on Neptune Road, resisting the Dutch elm disease that have felled most of the Boston-area elms in the 20th Century.

A historical fiction forerunner to Jurassic Park, the novel is set in the American West in 1876 during the Bone Wars, a period of fervent competition for fossil hunting between two real-life paleontologists noted for their intense rivalry, Othniel Charles Marsh and Edward Drinker Cope. The plot follows the protagonist William Johnson, a Yale student who works during the summer alternately for the two paleontologists.  Plot Summary  William Johnson is an irresponsible student studying at Yale college. He makes a bet with his rival, a student named Marlin, that he will go west the following summer. Johnson then attempts to join Prof. Othniel Charles Marsh on his yearly expedition fossil hunting in the Badlands. Marsh is reluctant until Johnson lies, saying that he is a photographer. Johnson learns to take photographs and leaves with Marsh at the appointed time. However, upon learning of Johnson's Philadelphia background, Marsh begins to suspect that he is a spy for Edward Drinker Cope, a rival paleontologist. Marsh abandons Johnson in Cheyenne. Shortly thereafter, Johnson meets Cope, who invites him to join his expedition. They head out west, despite Marsh's attempts to discredit and stop them. They are finally forced to stop in Fort Benton, when news of Custer's defeat at the hands of Sitting Bull causes a ban on travel into Montana. Even so, Cope's group manages to sneak away from the Fort. When they arrive in the Judith Basin, they immediately begin to dig for fossil bones. They remain there for several months. Marsh attempts to spy on them and poison their water, but leaves after Cope's group lures him into camp and fires at him. At the end of the summer, they leave for Fort Benton. As they have too many bones with them for a single trip, they leave half of the bones at camp, intending to retrieve them on the second trip. Johnson volunteers to lead the second trip, and is accompanied by a fellow student named Toad, a snake scout named Little Wind, and the teamster, Cookie. As they approach the camp, they see the fires of the Sioux army in the distance. Cookie and Little Wind desert Johnson and Toad, leaving them with the wagon. They decide to carry on and retrieve the bones anyway, and are pursued by Sioux warriors on horseback. They come across Little Wind, and manage to escape by driving the wagon into the badlands, but Toad is killed in the process. Meanwhile, at fort Benton, Cookie arrives with several arrows stuck in him, and dies. Cope assumes that Johnson is dead, and telegrams his parents. Johnson and Little Wind drive the Wagon east, hoping to put distance between themselves and the Sioux. Little Wind dies of blood loss. Eventually, Johnson arrives, barely alive, in the town of Deadwood Gulch. Johnson sets up a photography studio in order to earn money to pay for a stagecoach fare to Fort Laramie. The residents of the Town become convinced that his boxes of bones in fact contain gold. Tensions rise, and, fearing that he will be robbed, Johnson buries the bones. This infuriates a local outlaw named Black Dick Curry, who had been planning to steal the boxes. He challenges Johnson to a duel, which Johnson wins. An injured Curry swears revenge and flees the town. Johnson raises enough money for the coach and prepares to leave. He offers half of his bones to Wyatt and Morgan Earp in exchange for guarding the coach on its journey, as he suspects that Dick Curry will try to rob it on the way to Laramie. He is proven to be correct, and Dick tries twice to rob the coach, but is unsuccessful. When they arrive in Laramie, Johnson discovers that Wyatt made a deal with Marsh to sell half of Johnson's bones. While they bargain, Johnson removes the bones from the boxes and replaces them with rocks. Johnson then continues on to Cheyenne, and eventually arrives back in Philadelphia, much to the surprise of his parents and of Cope. He turns the bones over to Cope. Finally, he returns to Yale to claim his winnings from Marlin.

He was buried in 1861. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 1994.  History  Ludwig Becker, an 1861 memorial lithograph by fellow German Club member, Frederick Schonfeld Doctor Ludwig Becker, a member of the Burke and Wills expedition, died on 29 April 1861 and his grave, together with those of William Purcell and Charles Stone, is located on a stock route along the western bank of Kooliatto Waterhole on the Bulloo River. Becker was born at Darmstadt, Germany in 1808. He achieved a Doctorate of Philosophy and left Germany for political reasons during the 1848 revolution. After some time in Rio de Janeiro he arrived at Launceston, Tasmania in 1851. He was described by Lady Denison as: > one of those universal geniuses who can do anything...a very good > naturalist, geologist...draws and plays and sings, conjures and > ventriloquises and imitates the notes of birds so accurately In 1852-54, while gold digging in Bendigo, Victoria, Becker made meteorological observations and produced sketches which he exhibited in Melbourne in April 1854. He became a council member of the Victorian Society of Fine Arts in 1856 and of the Philosophical Institute of Victoria in 1859, and was a leading member of the German Club. He corresponded with ornithologist and zoologist John Gould, known as the father of bird study in Australia, on the lyrebird, and was one of the first to try to raise a lyrebird chick and sent sketches of the egg to ornithologists in Germany and France. His scientific knowledge and artistic ability qualified him for selection as a member of the Victorian Exploring Expedition in 1860-61, which has since become known as the Burke and Wills expedition. It was organised by the Philosophical Institute which in 1860 became the Royal Society of Victoria. The Burke and Wills expedition was led by Robert O'Hara Burke, who was a superintendent of police in the Castlemaine district when, in 1860, he was given leave to take command of the exploring expedition to cross the continent from south to north. The objectives of the expedition were hazy and its route, from Cooper's Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria, was decided less than a month before it set out. Burke's instructions, sent after him because they were not ready at the time, were incoherent. The real object of the expedition appears to have been to snatch from the South Australian explorer, John McDouall Stuart, the honour of making the first south-north crossing of the continent. Sir Henry Barkly, Governor of Victoria 1856-1863, described it as the glorious race across the continent between the expeditions fitted out in this and the adjacent colony of South Australia. The Burke and Wills expedition was the most expensive in the history of Australian exploration. It cost over and seven lives. Burke was the first Australian explorer to be provided with camels, over two dozen of them, imported complete with cameleers. There were horses and wagons, food for two years and lavish equipment. The party consisted of three officers; Burke, George James Landells the camelmaster, and William John Wills surveyor and meteorologist; German scientific officers Ludwig Becker artist, naturalist and geologist, and Herman Beckler medical officer and botanist; a foreman, nine assistants and the camel-drivers. The expedition left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 and made progress through the settled districts to Swan Hill and Balranald and reached Menindee on the Darling River at the beginning of October. Burke was in haste and left much of his provisions at Balranald and more at Menindee. Becker, as artist, naturalist and geologist on a salary of , received lengthy instructions from Doctor John Macadam, honorary secretary of the Exploration Committee, which stipulated that he should collect specimens, keep a diary and produce daily maps with illustrations and sections. He sent his first dispatches from Swan Hill, and from Menindie sent a number of specimens. He became despondent when these were not acknowledged. Burke became impatient with the lost time in making scientific investigations and ordered that Becker and Beckler give up their investigations and work like the rest of the men and walk instead of ride. In a report to the Exploration Committee, Landells wrote that Burke requested him not to allow Becker to ride and had observed that if Becker accompanied the expedition, and got through, people would say that it would not be difficult to cross to the Gulf of Carpentaria, and that he was to be walked until he gave in. At one stage Becker did not eat for three days and became faint. He had to wait until everyone was asleep to do his writing and sketching. After quarrelling with Burke, Landells resigned at Menindee and Burke promoted Wills to second in command, replacing him as third officer by a local man, William Wright, who proved incompetent and unreliable. Burke's orders were that his base camp was to be at Cooper's Creek; instead, he divided his party, transport and provisions, dashing on to Cooper's Creek with an advance party and ordering Wright to follow with as little delay as possible. However, Wright waited in Menindee for three months - by which time Burke had travelled to the Gulf of Carpentaria and back - before transporting the vital reserve transport and provisions the to Cooper's Creek. Becker was with Wright's party in Menindee, and frustrated due to the lack of communication from the Exploration Committee he no longer wrote his daily reports and concentrated instead on sketching. He became aware of the possible failure of the expedition, but his letter to the committee about the delays was ignored. Art work \\"Border of the Mud-Desert near Desolation Camp\\" at Rat Point, by Ludwig Becker, 1861 Wright's party moved north at the end of January 1861, and reached Torowoto, about half way from Menindee to Cooper's Creek on 12 February. By this time Becker and others were suffering from scurvy and the effects of bad water. At their camp at Rat Point, Becker and William Purcell, the cook, were very ill. Wright moved on to try to reach Cooper's Creek, but only made it to Bulloo and returned. Beckler remained with the sick members, and on 8 April wrote to his brother of Becker's illness and the unlikelihood of his recovery, stating that \\"I shall have to bury him here, and then what an outcry there will be for me in Melbourne!\\" Wright wanted to send the sick men back to Menindee, but Beckler told him that they could not make a single day's journey. Wright then ordered the party on to Bulloo, which they reached on 21 April. Wright's party never continued onto Cooper's Creek. Meanwhile Burke, impatient for Wright's arrival at Cooper's Creek, selected Wills, King and Gray to accompany him to the gulf and left four men under the command of William Brahe, one of the assistants, at camp LXV at Cooper's Creek. Burke decided to explore on foot and took provisions for twelve weeks and six camels and a horse as pack animals. It took four months to complete the , and Gray died before they returned to camp LXV at Cooper's Creek. When Burke's party reached camp LXV on 21 April 1861, spent, starving and in rags, they found it deserted. Brahe's party, having given up hope of seeing Burke and Wills, had left that day for Menindee with six camels, twelve horses, all the clothes and most of the food. Burke decided that as they were in bad shape and had only two camels, they would not be able to catch Brahe's party and would not survive the journey. He decided to make for Mount Hopeless, a journey away, leaving a message of their intentions at camp LXV. Bulla or Koorliatto : view from the camp up and down the Creek, by Hermann Beckler, 1861 - this is the camp where Becker, Stone & Purcell died and were buried Brahe's party arrived at Wright's camp at Bulloo on 28 April. The natives were hostile, and had attacked the camp on 27 April. During this period, Becker was mostly unconscious and died on 29 April, and was buried near the graves of William Purcell and Charles Stone who had died a few days earlier. The Royal Commission to enquire into the causes of the deaths of Burke and Wills also found, from Dr Beckler's evidence, that Dr Becker died of dysentery and the exhaustion consequent upon it; of course with some peculiar symptoms, which were principally owing to the affection of scurvy. After his burial, Becker's clothes, bedding and tent were burned and his other effects were placed in a pack for conveyance to Melbourne. Brahe decided to return to camp LXV at Cooper's Creek, to wait for Burke and Wills, which he reached fifteen days after he had left it. He did not find Burke's message and left again for Menindee for good. Burke, Wills and King, heading for Mount Hopeless, were too weak to get far. Only King survived, by living with the Aboriginals and sharing their food after Burke and Wills had died, and was rescued by Alfred William Howitt's search party from Melbourne in September 1861. A royal commission appointed to inquire into the deaths of Burke and Wills censured Burke for having dividing his party at Menindee and for entrusting Wright, of whom he knew little, with an important command, and that he had showed more zeal than prudence in leaving Cooper's Creek before the arrival of Wright and undertaking the journey to the gulf with inadequate provisions. Burke kept no journal, there was no time for scientific observation and Burke's route was only practicable in unusual weather. Burke won the race to the north, but John McDouall Stuart found the all-weather route. Solid gains in geographical knowledge were made by the explorers Howitt, John McKinlay and William Landsborough who led parties in search of him. Becker had made meteorological observations daily until a month before he died. His death was lamented in newspapers and journals both in the Australian Colonies and in Germany, and he was mourned by colleagues at the Royal Society. Governor Barkly paid tribute to one of the earliest and most indefatigable contributors: > ...the name of Ludwig Becker will...rank with those of Cunningham, Kennedy > and Leichhardt and the rest of that noble band who have sacrificed their > lives in the cause of science The City of Ballarat commemorated the expedition with a clock tower in 1863 referring to the deaths of The Victorian Explorers Burke, Wills, Gray and Becker. The small Queensland parish of Becker perpetuates his name and some timber posts mark his grave. This expedition paved the way for settlement in the area, with the first recorded settlement being Bulloo Downs Station taken up by Jones, Sullivan and Molesworth Green in 1864.  Description  Dr Ludwig Becker's grave, with the graves of William Purcell and Charles Stone, is located on a stock route along the western bank of Kooliatto Waterhole on the Bulloo River near Molesworth Station southwest of Thargomindah. The gravesite, marked by a plinth with a plaque and three timber posts, is surrounded by a low metal fence.  Heritage listing  Dr Ludwig Becker's Grave was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 August 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Dr Ludwig Becker, artist, explorer and naturalist, has been described as a martyr to science and his loved profession, both a devotee to science and to art. He was an integral member of arguably the most famous, and fateful, of the Australian exploring expeditions. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. His grave and its location are both a memorial to his life and to the Burke and Wills Expedition.

Background  For the sixth generation, Honda split the Accord into three separate models, designed for the Japanese, North American, and European markets. However, the wagon was discontinued in North America while the coupe was discontinued in Japan. This generation also spawned two distinctively branded performance versions for European and Japanese domestic markets, dubbed Type R and Euro R, respectively. On the origin of these models, it is rumored that with the advent of the sixth generation Accord, \\"Honda England were let loose to build a car that would compete with Subaru and Mitsubishi's Evo. They came up with the Accord Type R, a lightened (around 1200 kg) track version with no sound deadening or luxuries\\". Honda Japan followed suit in 2000, \\"took the Accord Type R and developed the Accord Euro R (hence the 'Euro'pean tag)\\" which has a similar chassis, suspension that is interchangeable with European model, same engine (slightly detuned for European Type R), and nearly identical interior trim.  Japan  = Mass market = The Japanese models, introduced on 4 September 1997 for the 1998 model year, became narrower than the previous generation, returning to the favorable compact car tax bracket, except for Euro R and wagon, which were classified as the larger mid-sized classification. A nearly identical sister car, the Honda Torneo, replaced the previous Honda Ascot and the Honda Rafaga in Japan, which was sold at both Honda Verno and Honda Primo Japanese dealerships, while the Accord remained at Honda Clio locations. This was the last generation that was badge engineered as the Isuzu Aska. When the previous generation Accord grew in exterior dimensions, this reclassified the Accord as a midsized car in Japan. The second generation Honda Inspire was manufactured in two platforms, with the smaller G20A five-cylinder engine installed in a shorter and narrower sedan that complied with \\"compact\\" regulations. This effort reflected Honda's positioning of Honda Clio as a luxury car dealership that sold the luxury sedans Honda Legend and Honda Inspire, similar to their efforts in North America with the Acura brand. Honda continued to offer the Accord station wagon in Japan. All trim levels sold in Japan were available with Honda's newly created, internet-based telematics service called Internavi. = Performance models =  Accord/Torneo Euro R (CL1, 2000‚Äì2002)  Accord Euro R (CL1) The Euro R included a \\"red top\\" variation of H22A engine producing 220 PS (162 kW; 217 hp) at 7,200 rpm & 163 ft¬∑lbf (221 N¬∑m) at 6,500 rpm, 5-speed T2W4 manual transmission with helical Torsen LSD, Recaro seats, leather-wrapped MOMO steering wheel, sports suspension, sports exhaust (including 4‚Äì2‚Äì1 stainless headers) and an aluminum-alloy gear shift knob. It was also fitted with a unique factory body kit that included flares and was available in some colors not available to other Accords (such as Milano Red). The Accord (sold at Honda Clio locations) and the Torneo (sold at Honda Verno and Primo locations) are the same car, aside from minor cosmetic differences in the exterior, most notably front of the car. The 2002 model was named the Euro-Rx. This model came with a few slight modifications from the 2000/2001 model. These included factory rear privacy glass, a titanium gear knob, optional Red-checker interior (original gold-checker) and bronze coloured alloy wheels. The high-stop spoiler also became standard on all models. Honda also addressed two common issues that had become apparent. The ECU was upgraded to resolve the issue of cold-starts causing hesitation on acceleration and the gearbox syncros were upgraded to a higher quality alloy to lengthen their lifespan.  Accord SiR-T (CF4, 1997‚Äì2000)  The SiR-T model included a 2.0L F20B engine rated at 7200 rpm ( automatic) and at 6600 rpm, 11.0.1 compression, 85 mm X 88 mm (Bore and Stroke) 7800 rpm redline. The H-series DOHC VTEC engines were limited to 7800 rpms. The F20B had a unique blue valve cover and like all the larger displacement Honda engines, the F20B was mounted with a tilt towards the driver. F20B engines could rev at higher rpms than H22As because it had a shorter stroke. The F20B had an 85 mm x 88 mm bore and stroke when compared to an H22A which had an 87 mm x 90.7 mm bore and stroke.http://world.honda.com/ACCORD/history06.html The F20B was also classified as a low emissions engine.  Accord SiR (CF4, 1997‚Äì2002)  The Accord SiR was based on the SiR-T, but used the S-Matic automatic transmission. The engine was rated at but with better midrange characteristics. Moving the gear-stick over to the right allowed manual selection of 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear using up and down shift actions just like the sequential gearboxes used on the JGTC NSX. When a particular gear is selected, the gear stays in position at all rpm. When pushed against the rev limiter, the engine would bounce against it just like a manual. However, the gear ratios for each gear were the same as the normal mode. The transmission still worked like a normal automatic transmission in all other operating modes.  Accord Wagon SiR (CH9 FWD 1999‚Äì2001, CL2 AWD 2000‚Äì2001)  Japan-market 1997 Accord wagon The SiR wagon model included the only 2.3-liter H23A DOHC VTEC H-series engine in the Honda line-up. The H23A engine was rated at 200 hp / 190 hp (AWD) at 6,800 rpm and torque of at 5,300 rpm, 10.6:1 compression, X bore and stroke, and a 7200 rpm redline which is slightly lower than other H-series VTEC engines from factory. The H23A also came with a blue valve cover and was the largest displacement of the H-series Honda engines. The H23A was mounted with a tilt towards the driver. The H23A had a longer stroke than the H22A. Specifications for the H23A were; X bore and stroke and H22A has X bore and stroke. The H23A had better acceleration because the peak torque occurred sooner at lower rpm when compared to the H22A.  Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia  The American Accord was only available in sedan and coupe form, becoming the largest Accord to date, sharing a platform with the Japan-market Honda Inspire/Acura TL. While previous generations of the Coupe were considered two-door versions of the sedan, the 1998 Coupe was the first to be given an exclusive front fascia, rear tail lights (which resemble those found on the NSX), wheels, and many other body panels, and was now marketed as a somewhat separate model, the \\"Accord Coupe\\", to set it away from the more family-oriented sedan version. It also allowed the Coupe, which was exported to other markets, to fit in more easily with the local Accord versions. The tail light appearance was duplicated on the Japanese market Honda Domani for the second generation of production. The coupe's design was styled by Don Herner and directed by lead designer Eric Schumaker into August 1995 in Torrance, CA. It was later scanned as a clay model and transferred to engineering in August 1995 at Honda R&D; in Raymond, Ohio. It was developed by Honda engineer Laura Minor into production form until January 1996, being then developed into prototypes for testing. 1997‚Äì2001 Accord V6 sedan (Australia) Starting with this generation, cabin air filters (also known as pollen filters) were installed as standard equipment and are located behind the glove compartment internationally. G development began in January 1993 (during final development of the CD), with design work starting later that year. A design for the sedan by Shinji Takashima and Toshihiko Shimizu was chosen in January 1995 and later frozen for production by the middle of 1995. Prototype test mules were tested from mid-1995 in CD Accord body panels, with full body prototypes being used from 1996. Design patents were filed on 8 March 1996, with development ending in March 1997. Sedan mass production began in August 1997, with customers deliveries starting on September 23, 1997. Coupe production began in September 1997, going on sale on November 4, 1997. Honda Accord coupe For the 1998 model year, the sedan was offered in DX, LX, LX-V6, EX, and EX-V6 trims while the Accord Coupe was offered only in LX, LX-V6, EX, and EX-V6 trims. The DX model was fitted with a 2.3L I4 non-VTEC engine rated at , while the LX and EX included a 2.3L I4 VTEC engine rated at . All 4-cylinder models, except for the \\"SE\\", came with a 5-speed manual transmission standard, and with a four-speed automatic as optional equipment. The SE was only available with the automatic transmission. The DX remained the value-oriented trim with no audio system, manual windows, manual locks, no cruise control, rear drum brakes, and 14-inch steel wheels. The DX Value Package added a radio-cassette player, air conditioning, and cruise control; this was known as the Accord DX in Canada where it was the base model of the lineup. The LX trim added power windows, power locks, door courtesy lights and 15-inch steel wheels; the SE (special edition) package available since 1999 added 15-inch alloy wheels, and optional leather trim, but was only available with the 4-speed automatic. The EX trim added ABS, alloy wheels, keyless entry, rear disc brakes, and upgraded cloth. Leather seating, CD player, and power sunroof were factory installed options for the EX. All V6 sedan and coupe models received the 3.0L V6 SOHC VTEC engine rated at and (derived straight from the Acura 3.0 CL), ABS and automatic transmission. Some dealer-installed options included: gold finish kit, gold finish exhaust tip(s), gold finish wheel center caps, 6-disc in-dash CD changer, tape deck, fog lights, wing spoiler, alarm system, sunroof visor, car cover and accessory chrome wheels. 2001‚Äì2002 Accord EX coupe (U.S.) In Australia, the 6th generation Accord went on sale in December 1997, and was initially imported from the USA. However, in 1999, the Accord became the first Honda in Australia to be imported from Thailand. In March 2001, the Accord received a facelift, while at the same time, the option of a manual transmission was dropped. New colour choices with the facelift included Naples Gold, Signet Silver, and Nighthawk Black, the first time that black was offered in an Australian market Accord. In September 2000, both the American- market Accord sedan and coupe received a minor facelift. A new front fascia, rear bumper, side skirt alteration, new taillights and wheel designs freshened the Accord's look. The interior saw few changes with the exception of some fabric and audio configuration changes. The LX and LX-V6 now included a standard CD player, and the EX 4-cylinder now included a 6-disc in-dash CD changer with cassette player while the EX-V6 offered that stereo plus automatic climate control. All V6 models also included a traction control system that could be disabled by a switch, the first Accord to have such a system included. The Special Edition returned to the coupe and sedan models for its final model year, 2002. It included all the features of the LX, but added exclusive alloy wheels, keyless entry and a single CD/cassette radio. In the Philippines, only the sedan was available and offered in VTi and VTi-L trims. The VTi model was fitted with a 2.0L I4 VTEC engine rated at while the top VTi-L trim was fitted with a 2.3L I4 VTEC engine rated at . Both models are available with either a 5-speed manual transmission or a 4-speed automatic transmission. Honda made the decision to continue this generation of Accord an extra year. Previously, the Accord ran four years on a single body-style and facelift before being redesigned. The typical Accord generation cycle was a 2:4 trend, with a newly released model running for years 1 and 2 unaltered, then getting a facelift for years 3 and 4 before a major redesign. This generation would run a total of 5 years in a 3:5 trend, with the facelift occurring in year four. Accord sales remained steady despite the additional year. Despite the Accord's reputation for reliability, the V6 models were plagued by transmission failures and prompted class action lawsuits against the company (4-cylinder models were also affected, but not to the same extent). This caused Honda to extend the warranties for the 2000 through 2001 models to seven years or . 1998, 1999 and 2002 cars were considered for extended coverage on a case-by-case basis. No formal recall occurred. In Canada, recall letters were sent out to owners who fell within a certain VIN range; this warranty was later re-extended for some owners to seven years in length. Beginning in 1997 at launch, Accord keys were equipped with immobilizer microchips. In late 1998, the Accord was equipped with foldable mirrors. In 2001, the Special Edition was added and the DX Value-Package was re-introduced for 2002 models. The 1998 Accord was also assembled in New Zealand at the very end of overall CKD car production due to the abolition of import tariffs on built cars which made local assembly uneconomic. 1,200 examples of the car (the mid-sized U.S. sedan version) were built before the Honda New Zealand factory was closed; the very first Honda-owned factory operation to be closed down) and the equipment (which included a paint shop acquired from Nissan when that automaker closed its Australian manufacturing unit in 1994) was shipped to other Honda assembly units, mainly in Asia. Small numbers of Accords were imported (right hand drive) from the U.S. before sourcing switched to Thailand once Accord assembly began there. The Thai factory continues to supply New Zealand with the latest generation Accord and now also ships that line and other Honda models to Australia and elsewhere in South East Asia. Honda Accord (China) Concerns over airbag safety plagued the Japanese automaker. The company announced it was recalling vehicles citing driver's airbags that deploy with too much force during collisions. Honda says 2,430 faulty airbags were installed as repairs to customer vehicles after a collision. But since the company cannot accurately track down which Honda received the flawed airbags, Honda broadened its search to include the 2001‚Äì2001 Accord. Since November 2008, Honda has recalled some 1.7 million of its cars for airbag concerns. At its last similar expanded recall in February 2010, Honda said the too-powerful airbags have been involved in 12 incidents, including one fatality.  Europe  The European Accord, also made in Swindon, was different in its styling and was also shorter than the Japanese- and American-market Accords. It was available as a sedan and a 5-door hatchback (liftback), with the U.S.-imported coupe completing the range. The design approval of the sixth generation Accord came in early 1995. The standard Accord featured more items than the base models of similar cars (Ford Mondeo, Peugeot 406, Opel/Vauxhall Vectra, etc.) in its class. The basic S came with ABS, alarm, engine immobilizer, and air-conditioning, with the SE added the options of metallic paint, cruise control, climate control and later, satellite navigation. The 1998‚Äì1999 ES version came with all those features (except the satellite navigation optional), as well as a walnut and leather trimmed interior with heated front seats. This model was renamed as the SE Executive in late 1999. The EU version had a minor facelift in 2001 including a revised grill, alloy wheels, bumpers and both rear and front lights. In 2001, the trim range was expanded with a Type-V; with leather trim as standard equipment, satellite navigation and a tiptronic automatic transmission as optional. The Sport model, which was as the SE, came with modified styling, spoiler, and a color-coded side skirt (as opposed to black plastic). Other engines included a 1.8 L F18B VTEC engine rated at , a 2 L F20B6 VTEC engine rated at , as well as a 1.6 which was the entry level engine not offered in the United Kingdom, it produces . The Type-V model (2001‚Äì2003) included the F23Z5 VTEC engine, it was the largest engine that European 6th- gen Accord offered. The Type-R, Type-V, and Sport trims can had a badge on the front grill and hood lid, though the pre-facelift models only signified Type-R on the front. The top of the range SE Executive only became identified as such in 2000 with a badge 'SE EXECUTIVE' on the hood lid. Walnut trim interior was also dropped for the SE Executive during the facelift, while a new climate control system was added. = Accord Type R (CH1, 1998‚Äì2002) = 1999 Accord Type R (pre-facelift) The Accord Type R was a performance variant of the standard Accord, sold in European markets. Apart from a similar yet different body, the European Type R is largely identical to the Japanese CL1 Euro R, including the same \\"red top\\" H22A engine; however, in a H22A7 version (compared to H22A for Euro R) producing a lower output at 212 PS (156kW; 209 hp) at 7,200 rpm and 164 lb¬∑ft (222 N¬∑m) at 6,700 rpm (compared to 220 PS (162 kW; 217 hp) for Euro R). The engine was mated to U2Q7 5-speed manual transmission with helical Torsen LSD. Recaro seats, leather-wrapped Momo steering wheel, stiffer suspension, dual exhaust (including 4‚Äì2‚Äì1 stainless headers), and an aluminum-alloy gear shift knob also came standard. Like the Euro R, the Type R was fitted with a factory body kit. Other differences from the standard model include hydraulic power steering on the Type R. The R model was facelifted in 2001 with updates to the bumpers and fog lights, but removing the factory fitted bodykit. The electric radio aerial was also replaced, with a smaller \\"Bee Sting\\" style aerial situated at the rear of the roof line. The 5 speed gearbox was revised with stronger synchros in response to a number of failures on the earlier cars, and the exhaust was fitted with more subtle tips, angled downwards and unpolished in comparison to the pre- facelift's straight chrome tips. The interior and other parts stayed identical. Sales of the Type R were low; for example, less than two thousand were sold in the UK alone.

By 2013, around five tonnes were produced monthly. Characteristics Oxford Blue is prepared using unpasteurised cow's milk and is ripened (aged) for 14 to 16 weeks. Its rind is sticky and wet in texture. The cheese is soft, creamy and moist, has aromatic, tangy and spicy qualities, and has traces of white wine and chocolate in its flavour. It has been described as a \\"French-style English blue\\" that can be used \\"as an alternative\\" to Stilton cheese\\", and as similar to Dolcelatte and St Agur cheeses, with a less strong flavour than Roquefort or Stilton. History Oxford Blue was created by French baron Robert Pouget in 1995. It was initially produced by Hartington Creamery in Derbyshire until 2009, when the creamery closed, and subsequently in Carmarthenshire, Wales. In 2013, efforts began to start producing Oxford Blue at a new, small dairy in Burford, Oxfordshire, which was developed in a converted barn. At the Burford site in 2013, Pouget encountered an initial problem of having nowhere to dispose of waste whey, a byproduct of the cheese's production, which was at around each month. The problem was solved by the introduction of an anaerobic digester to process the whey. In April 2013, around five tonnes of Oxford Blue were produced monthly. In 2015 the cheese was distributed by the Oxford Cheese Company.

The company is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Winmark was founded in 1988 as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation by Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg after they purchased the Play It Again Sports franchise rights from Martha Morris. They renamed the company to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. Grow Biz went public in August 1993. In 2000, John Morgan replaced Dahlberg as CEO and renamed the company to Winmark in 2001. Morgan rescued Winmark from the verge of bankruptcy by selling financially failing franchise concepts and stores and replacing the management team. The company's strategy was to move from owning stores itself to having franchisees own all the stores. Winmark Corporation owns five franchise-based retail companies that focus on used goods: Music Go Round (musical instruments), Once Upon a Child (children's clothes and toys), Plato's Closet (adolescent and young adult clothes), Play It Again Sports (sports equipment), and Style Encore (women's clothing). Winmark also owned but subsequently sold four franchise-based retailed companies: Computer Renaissance (computer equipment), Disc Go Round (CDs), It's About Game (computer games and video games), and ReTool (tools). Its subsidiary Wirth Business Credit is a small-business supplies leasing company. Around 2013, research company IBISWorld reported that in the used goods outlet market, Goodwill Industries was first with a 21.5% share, Winmark was second with nearly 6%, and The Salvation Army was third with nearly 4%. In 2016, Winmark had a $1 billion market share in the $17 billion resell industry through its 1,170 franchisees. History Ron Olson and Jeffrey Dahlberg started a consulting firm, Franchise Business Systems, in 1986. Olson had been the president of R.J. Brandon Galleries and Dahlberg had been the chief executive officer of his father Kenneth H. Dahlberg's company, Dahlberg Inc. (now Miracle-Ear). Martha Morris was an initial customer of Olson and Dahlberg's consulting company. Morris, who started Play It Again Sports in 1983 in Uptown, Minneapolis, had purchased camping and backpacking supplies, found out she was not interested in camping, and decided to sell her used goods. She had attempted to sell a costly, lightly used backpack through making ads and visiting a sports shop, where an employee told her, \\"We don't sell used equipment.\\" Morris decided to start her own store since she believed other people might have used sports equipment they would like to sell. Morris expressed a desire to make her idea a franchise. Although Olson and Dahlberg were first concerned about the idea's outlook for success, their worries disappeared after they dropped by her outlet a Saturday morning and found a line of 10 customers before Morris' store had even opened. Their strategy to captivate franchisees was to add urbanity to something they called a \\"garage sale-looking environment\\" but not harm the initial idea. Olson and Dahlberg quickly realized they preferred to be the owners of a company instead of be advisers. Morris sold her Play It Again Sports franchise rights to Olson and Dahlberg in 1988. She sold her stores to them in 1990. Play It Again Sports became Winmark's first division. The company was incorporated as Play It Again Sports Franchise Corporation in 1988 and was renamed to Grow Biz International Inc. in June 1993. It went public in August 1993. The company was listed on NASDAQ as GBIZ; it is now listed on NASDAQ as WINA. In 1995, a significant number of the company's franchises were on Entrepreneurs annual \\"Franchise 500\\" list. In 2001, Grow Biz was renamed to Winmark Corporation. Winmark Corporation is based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In March 2000, John Morgan took over as CEO from Jeff Dahlberg. By a year after joining the company as CEO, Morgan rescued Winmark from the precipice of bankruptcy by introducing stringent review of franchisee finances, shuttering failing Play It Again Sports stores, and appointing his own people to executive and board positions. Morgan chose Steve Briggs, who had been at Valspar, as the company's president. He selected as board members Kirk MacKenzie, whom he had worked with at Winthrop Resources, and Paul Reyelts, the chief financial officer at Valspar. In June 2000, Winmark sold its corporate headquarters building to Koch Trucking. The company had lost $350,700 in 2000; in 2001, it had a net income of $3.2 million. Morgan said in a 2009 interview with the Star Tribune about the state of Winmark before he joined, \\"The company was very good at selling franchises, but it was still losing money.\\" Around 2002, Winmark sold the franchises Retool, Computer Renaissance and Disc-Go-Round. In 2011, Winmark was ranked the 11th company on Forbess \\"The Top 20 Small Public Companies In America\\". Around 2013, research company IBISWorld found that in the used goods outlet market, Goodwill Industries was first with a 21.5% share, Winmark was second with nearly 6%, and The Salvation Army was third with nearly 4%. In 2016, the company had a $1 billion market share in the $17 billion resell industry through its 1,170 franchisees. In February 2016, President Brett Heffes was chosen as Winmark's next CEO, succeeding John Morgan, who became the executive chairman. According to a 2014 article in The Toronto Star, Morgan holds the most shares in the company. Franchises Winmark Corporation owns five franchise-based retail companies that focus on used goods: Music Go Round (musical instruments), Once Upon a Child (children's clothes and toys), Plato's Closet (adolescent and young adult clothes), Play It Again Sports (sports equipment), and Style Encore (women's clothing). Winmark sold four franchise-based retailed companies: Computer Renaissance (computer equipment), Disc Go Round (CDs), It's About Game (computer games and video games), and ReTool (tools). The cost to become a franchisee in 2009 was $25,000 and five percent of the franchisee's gross revenue. Franchisees further are required to pay Winmark for advertising and miscellaneous assistance. Although Winmark's contract with franchisees does not allot them territories, the contract ensures that any rival outlets must be located five or more miles away. Despite Winmark's specializing in used goods, its stores sell new goods too. Through its many stores, Winmark uses its buying power to negotiate competitive prices for the stores' new goods. It also teaches franchisees about the used goods industry and offers pricing software to establish standards for the used goods they purchase. Between 2006 and 2010, Winmark started around 50 stores annually. In 2013, Winmark had over 1,000 franchised stores‚Äînone of which it owned‚Äîthat in total had sales of over $900 million. =Current franchises= Music Go Round Music Go Round purchases, sells, and exchanges used musical instruments and paraphernalia. Founded as Hi-Tech Consignments in Minneapolis by Bill Shell in 1986, Winmark purchased it in 1993 and renamed it to Music Go Round. In 2009, roughly 30% of Music Go Round's musical instruments purchased were new. In 2011, it had 35 locations in the United States. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Music Go Round was $300,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000. Once Upon a Child Once Upon a Child purchases and sells used children's attire and toys. The first Once Upon a Child store was opened in 1985 in Perrysburg, Ohio, by Dennis and Lynn Blum in 1985 after they observed Goodwill Industries accepting and selling used baby attire. Prior to opening a store, Lynn Blum had been selling her three sons' and friends' and neighbors' clothing in a garage sale from her house every week. Her husband resigned from his employment in 1989 to work with Lynn . Winmark purchased the company in 1992. In 2009, roughly 10% of Once Upon a Child's children's attire and playthings purchased were new. In 2011, it had 240 locations in the United States and 24 in Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Once Upon a Child was between $200,000 and $250,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000. Plato's Closet Plato's Closet purchases and sells used brand name children's and teenagers' brand name clothes, shoes, and paraphernalia. It focuses on clothes for people ages 12 to 24. Winmark purchased Plato's Closet from Dennis and Lynn Blum, the founders of Once Upon a Child, in 1998. The store's name was inspired by a Blum son's schoolwork about Plato who had been an early advocate of recycling, which paralleled the aim to recycle used clothes. In 2011, there were over 280 franchisees in the United States and Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Plato's Closet was between $200,000 and $250,000 and the average yearly sales were $825,000. A 2001 article in the Star Tribune noted that Plato's Closet in 2001 stocked up on brand names like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap Inc., Silver Jeans Co., Sean John, Express, Inc., and Dr. Martens that they sold at a markdown of between 50% and 75%. Unlike consignment shops, Plato's Closet pays sellers on the spot. Used clothes are purchased at between 30% and 40% of what Plato's Closet intends to sell them at. According to a 2002 article in Winston-Salem Journal, Winmark spent around $67,000 for each television advertisement for Plato's Closet. In a 2009 interview with Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Plato's Closet did the best during the Great Recession among Winmark's franchises because people were more likely to sell used clothing to make money and to buy used clothing to save money. Play It Again Sports Play It Again Sports purchases and sells used sports goods and is Winmark's largest chain. Roughly 70% of Play It Again Sports' sports equipment is new. In 2011, it had over 330 locations in the United States and Canada. In 2010, the complete cost to start a Play It Again Sports was $300,000 and the average yearly sales were between $650,000 and $725,000. Style Encore Style Encore buys and sells used women's clothing. In January 2013, Winmark announced that it would start a new franchise, Style Encore, that would focus on used women's clothing. The first store opened in Texas in August 2013. Style Encore immediately pays cash to people looking to sell used women's attire, footwear, handbags, and jewelry. =Former franchises= Computer Renaissance Computer Renaissance bought and sold new and used computer supplies like computers, computer memory, computer monitors, and printers. The store also sold computer games and books and helped customers build custom computers. Computer Renaissance was started in 1993. On July 7, 2000, Winmark sold Computer Renaissance, which had 209 stores, to Jack Hollis' Hollis Technologies LLC in Lakeland, Florida, for $3 million. Hollis had been a Computer Renaissance franchisee. CEO John Morgan said that whereas Music Go Round's used musical equipment did not depreciate, Computer Renaissance's aging computers did. Disc Go Round Disc Go Round bought and sold new and used compact discs (CDs). In July 1994, Winmark spent $2.3 million to purchase CDX Audio, which used the name CD Exchange in Green Bay, Wisconsin. When Winmark purchased the company, it had 42 stores. Winmark renamed the used CD store to Disc Go Round because they could not nationally trademark the name \\"CD Exchange\\". The outlet had an electronic system that recorded all the CDs a store had so customers did not have to browse the shelves trying to determine whether a particular CD was present. Disc Go Around also had \\"listening stations\\" for customers to listen to CDs. Winmark sold Disc Go Round, which had increased to 137 stores, to CD Warehouse on June 26, 1998, for $7.4 million. It's About Games It's About Games bought and sold used PC games, video games, and board games. Winmark spent roughly $6.8 million to acquire Video Game Exchange Inc. in 1997 and renamed it to It's About Games. It's About Games locations were largely in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Georgia and Maryland. It made money for Winmark until 1998. During its last year under Winmark management, It's About Games lost $3.4 million because of excessive inventory, a buggy computer system, poorly chosen products, and poorly trained employees. Winmark owned 60 of the 64 It's About Games stores in the franchise and would have been profitable without It's About Games. Winmark sold or closed all its It's About Games stores in 1999 to reduce losses. Winmark also aimed to cut down on the number of stores it owned because it wanted to focus on franchisee-owned stores. ReTool ReTool bought and sold used tools. Winmark opened the first ReTool on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of ReTool's goods were purchased from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses.

Subsidiaries =Wirth Business Credit= Wirth Business Credit is a small-business supplies leasing company owned by Winmark. In a 2008 interview with the Star Tribune, CEO John Morgan said Winmark plowed the $9 million to $10 million in profit from its franchisees into Wirth Business Credit because they believed leasing supplies will become a profitable business even though the current growth had been slow. In 2008, there were 27 Wirth Business Credit franchises. In 2004, Winmark created Winmark Business Solutions, a website for small businesses owners. Winmark Business Solutions was intended to help franchisees and clients of Wirth Business Credit. The website hosted 6,000 pages related to business such as how to found a company and how to sell a company. It had a forum for people to discuss small business issues and its articles also discussed finance, insurance, and technology topics with a focus on business.

The facility opened in 2016, and is located on the site of the canceled Hartsville Nuclear Plant. It holds a maximum of 2672 male inmates at medium security. There are seven housing units within the facility, each housing different number of inmates. The following, three-pod, housing units each house a maximum of 360 inmates: D, C, F, B and E. Housing unit W contains four pods, each holding a maximum of 128 inmates, for a total of 512. The inmates in this housing unit live in an open bay setting. Which means they are not in cells but sleep side by side in bunks. The segregation unit, A, contains five pods with a maximum capacity of 360.  History  Between its opening in January 2016 and May, an inmate was stabbed on February 26 when an officer left a housing unit unattended, the facility's newly-appointed warden resigned by early March without explanation, a TDOC official formally complained that CCA officers had no control over the prisoners, the entire facility unexpectedly halted taking new state inmates because of these \\"growing pains\\", and an officer was assaulted. On September 6, 2017 an officer was assaulted in E Unit by an inmate high on methamphetamine. The inmate used a homemade weapon to stab the officer multiple times. The officer was unable to escape the attack, which resulted in the inmates in his pod to come to his aid. On June 15, 2019 at approximately 3:00 P.M. CDT an inmate was found deceased in his cell during count. Further investigation revealed the inmate had been in an altercation with another inmate. On August 30, 2019 an inmate in W unit attacked and sexually assaulted a mental health staff member. The staff member was flown to Vanderbilt Medical Center for treatment, however, the attack resulted in a loss of vision for that staff member. The matter is currently under investigation. On January 25, 2020 a protective custody inmate was fatally stabbed by another inmate in the segregation unit. In 2020, an outbreak of COVID 19 at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center made Trousdale County the county with the highest per capita infection rate in the United States in early May. As of May 8, 1,284 prisoners at Trousdale had tested positive for the coronavirus, as had 50 employees and contractors at the facility. By August, three infected prisoners had died and a total of 1,379 prisoners had been infected. With the various issues inside the facility and the recent events of COVID-19, the warden has decided to place the facility under lockdown till further notice.  Legal status  As of 2016, Tennessee houses state inmates in four private prisons. The state's Private Prison Contracting Act of 1986, however, authorizes one single private prison for state inmates. As of 2016 Tennessee technically contracts directly with CoreCivic for inmates held at South Central Correctional Facility. For Trousdale and the two others, the state circumvents the statute by contracting with the local county. In turn the county signs an agreement with CoreCivic.

The band also centers its music in a combination of Afrobeat, jazz, Arabic music, and Indian music elements achieving a contemporary approach. As for the band's name, the word Jonda, a Spanish anachronism for \\"deep\\", is related to the Cante Jondo (in English, Deep Singing), the very origin of Flamenco. The band sets ground on those flamenco roots and the \\"Fusion\\" begins as they implement the Hispanic, Indian and African harmonies that have been inherited in the Caribbean.  History  Fusion Jonda began in 2010 as a trio around its creator, musician-singer- songwriter Juan Luis Romero, percussionist Wilfredo \\"El Canela\\" D√°vila and flamenco dancer Patricia Mu√±iz. From Salsa music, rock music to jazz sceneries, the music blends had not been unfamiliar to bandleader Romero who is from Puerto Rican and Dominican descent and belongs to a family dedicated to music, poetry, journalism, law and education. He studied piano and music composition at a very young age when he dreamed to produce musical interchanges between rhythms from the Antilles and Latin America. At age 13, he led his first orchestra and afterwards, he had a jazz band not without first being singer for a heavy metal music band, tenor of a Gospel music choir, chorister for the salsa legends Richie Ray & Bobby Cruz and pianist for several Tropical music bands. He is also a lawyer since 1990. Fusion Jonda has evolved from being a flamenco trio to a one-of-a-kind musical ensemble; an array of talented musicians from different genres like reggae, rock, jazz, salsa and world music bringing together the seductive sounds of the violin, the crispness of the trumpet and trombone, the modern vibes of the bass and the exotic ethnic percussion. They all share the common goal of blending their collected inspirations creating a new, sophisticated sound. Special appearances by urban poet and rapper Javier \\"Insurgente\\" Vel√°zquez and a tribal fusion dancer also take place during their live performances. The band got its first major break in 2012 when it was invited to perform at the Jos√© Miguel Agrelot Coliseum alongside Spanish singer Rosario Flores in front of a crowd of 15,000 during the 50th anniversary of the salsa orchestra El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.http://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/musica/nota/rosariofloresamadrinaalgrupofusionjonda-2160734 El Nuevo Dia.

The album consists of rare and obscure tracks from hip hop artists and groups originally released between 1983 and 1989 with many tracks that had previously not been released on compact disc. Many of the tracks have been described historically important with many tracks being sampled by more famous hip hop artists on tracks like \\"Holy War (Live)\\" by Divine Force (used by DJ Premier on a Jeru the Damaja song) and \\"Get Retarded\\" by MC EZ & Troup (used by Dr. Dre on \\"Zoom\\" from the Bulworth soundtrack). Ego Trip's The Big Playback was released by Rawkus Records on April 11, 2000. The album was released on vinyl, cassette and compact disc. Reception From contemporary reviews, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club noted that the album \\"offers ample evidence that there's more to '80s hip-hop than you'll find on most old-school compilations. Perhaps the old school's greatest virtue was its artistic freedom: Unencumbered by convention, hip-hop's pioneers made up the rules as they went along, giving their music an unpredictable, exuberant, spontaneous quality that The Big Playback captures for posterity. AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars as \\"required listening for readers of the book\\" and \\"Even for fans who aren't interested in a book of rap lists, Ego Trip's The Big Playback is a stellar compilation\\". Sasha Frere-Jones of Spin noted that \\"as the organising principle is rarity, not quality\\" and the tracks by Lord Shafiyq and MC Mitchski will \\"only be manna for ageing B-boys.\\" but that overall praised the album, stating that it was \\"proof that the current indie boom isn't the first time hip-hop was local, weird or free.\\" Track listing Credits adapted from the liner notes of the album. # Divine Force ‚Äì \\"Holy War (Live)\\" (Sir Ibu) # Lord Shaifiyq ‚Äì \\"My Mic is on Fire\\" (G.

Nelly Hooper Woods (better known as Nell Hooper Ludbrook) was born in Yorketown, South Australia on 14 June 1907. Her mother had studied as a teacher at the University of Adelaide in 1900. After attending Mount Barker High School, Nell enrolled in the University of Adelaide in 1926, taking her B.A. in 1928 and a teaching degree, as she had not studied enough prerequisite science subjects to enrol in a B.Sc.. She studied geology and mathematics, and appealed to Dr C.T. Madigan to give her a research project in geology. She worked on the fossil mollusc collection of Sir Joseph Verco for many years and pursued her M.A.  Career  While working as a teacher at Mount Barker High School, Nell wrote a paper on Cainozoic molluscs, which was rewarded with the Tate Memorial Medal from the University of Adelaide in 1931. Nell married Dr Wallis Verco Ludbrook, who she had met at the University of Adelaide where he was studying his B.Sc. and she her B.A., in 1935, and Nell and Wallis moved to Canberra. Irene Crespin, palaeontologist with the Commonwealth government, moved from Melbourne to Canberra, and employed Nell Ludbrook as an Assistant Geologist from 1942-1949, working on the statistics of minerals for the war effort for the Department of Mines. In 1950, Ludbrook travelled to England to study molluscs at the Imperial College of Science at the British Museum (Natural History), while her husband was away for work. Wallis Ludbrook died in 1951, and Nell was encouraged by her husband's family to remain in England and take her PhD in Pliocene molluscs of the Adelaide plains, at the University of London. After graduation in 1952, Ludbrook returned to Australia and began work as a Technical Information Officer for the South Australian Department of Mines. She was promoted to palaeontologist in 1957 and later senior palaeontologist, continuing in this role until her retirement in 1967. She was the Australian correspondent to the journal, Micropalaeontology from 1962-1966. Ludbrook worked as a consultant in palaeontology for the South Australian Department of Mines after her retirement, describing Tertiary molluscan fauna. She also wrote, Handbooks of the Flora and Fauna of South Australia and Guide to the Geology and Mineral Resources of South Australia. Ludbrook died in 1995. She has been praised for the way that she showed that palaeontology could be useful to the resources industry. The P. Ludbrookiae zone in the Eromanga and Surat basins is named for her.  Awards and legacy  Seventeen fossil species were named for her including, Ludbrookia Chavan, 1951. She published over 70 scientific papers and monographs. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1981, for service to science. The Geological Survey of South Australia named their fossil collection, the Ludbrook Library, within their geoscience laboratory in her honour. Ludbrook was the first female President of the Geological Society of Australia in 1968. She was the first female president of the Royal Society of South Australia in 1961. She received the Sir Joseph Verco medal from them in 1963.

It is located in Lake Tahoe ‚Äì Nevada State Park. History There are historical references to an \\"M. E. Spooner\\" and \\"Spooner & Co.'s House\\" in the area but the first documented eponymous reference was \\"a strip of productive land extends back from the lake for a distance of 2 miles, where it is called Spooner's Meadow\\". A dam constructed in 1927 to store irrigation water apparently converted the eastern part of Spooner Meadow into a small lake. Since the 1930s Spooner Lake has also been used for recreational fishing. Watershed and Geographical characteristics The Spooner Lake watershed is approximately but peak flows from the lake are limited by Spooner Dam. The dam was re-built in 1982 due to leakage. Spooner Lake is at above sea level. It is fed by numerous seeps and snowmelt and its outflow below Spooner Dam is to North Canyon Creek in Spooner Meadow. North Canyon Creek then heads west and then northwest along Highway 28 before turning to the southwest and flowing down Slaughterhouse Canyon to Glenbook and Lake Tahoe. The creek flows through the Toiyabe National Forest on its journey to Lake Tahoe. The reservoir covers approximately 100 surface acres and has a maximum depth of . Recreation In 1973, the Nevada Department of Wildlife began stocking the Spooner Lake with trout. Trout species include the native Lahontan cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii henshawi), as well as multiple non-native species and hybrids including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), brown trout (Salmo trutta), bowcutt trout (rainbow x cutthroat), brook trout (Salvenlinus fontinalis), and tiger trout (brown x brook). However, the lake's shallowness has made trout overwintering difficult and native Lahontan tui chub (Gila bicolor) have come to dominate the lake's fish species. Regulations changed from general (allowing harvest) to zero-harvest in 1982 and then to a 5 fish limit in 2006.

He was able to make it to the door of a nearby house before he collapsed. The homicide remains unsolved; he has been described as \\"the last person killed in New York on 9/11\\", although his death was unrelated to the terror attacks earlier that day. The initial investigation into the crime may have been hampered, police believe, by the diversion of law enforcement resources in the city in the wake of that day's terrorist attacks, which ultimately killed almost 3,000 people. Since he was not robbed, wore camouflage clothing and spoke poor English with a heavy accent, detectives have speculated that his killer may have thought he had something to do with the attacks. Siwiak's homicide is the only one recorded in New York City on September 11, 2001, since the city does not include the deaths from the attacks in the official crime statistics. Background A native of Krak√≥w, Siwiak had worked as an inspector for the Polish State Railways and its successor private entities. He was married and had two children, 17-year-old Gabriela and 10-year-old Adam. After he was laid off around 2000, he went to New York to visit his sister Lucyna, who had been living in Far Rockaway, Queens, for six years. Despite lacking a work permit, he decided to stay and do what work he could, sending several hundred dollars back to his wife Ewa in Poland every few months to supplement her earnings as a high school biology teacher. Siwiak hoped that eventually he could return and build a new house. While Siwiak was able to work, he struggled to learn English. He took classes and watched television with his sister, but improved only slowly. That, Lucyna warned him, could put him at risk in New York. \\"We told him [the city] was a dangerous place\\", she recalled later to the Associated Press. \\"But he didn't believe it\\", perhaps, she said, because he liked living there so much. Throughout most of 2001, he had been working at a construction site in Lower Manhattan. On the morning of September 11, following the attacks, the job site closed down as that part of the city was evacuated. He could not afford to wait until work resumed, so after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge, he took the subway back to his sister's home. After looking through the classified ads in the Polish-language newspaper Nowy Dziennik, he found one with a cleaning service at a Pathmark supermarket in the Farragut section of Brooklyn. To fill out the paperwork, he went to an employment agency in Bay Ridge that served the city's Polish community. At the employment agency, he comforted the owner, whose husband worked at the World Trade Center and had not contacted her since that morning (she later learned her husband had indeed died in the attack).Nowy Dziennik, \\"W≈Ça≈õcicielka tej agencji by≈Ça podenerwowana, bo jej mƒÖ≈º pracowa≈Ç w World Trade Center i ona nie mog≈Ça siƒô z nim skontaktowaƒá.

There he called his wife, Ewa, in Poland to tell her he was safe; he had seen the plane hit the towers. \\"I told him just in case: don't leave tonight, because it can be dangerous in New York\\", she recalled later. Homicide Siwiak had never been to the Farragut neighborhood where the Pathmark was located. So he and his landlady looked over a subway map and decided he should take the A train to the Utica Avenue station, near the north end of Albany Avenue, the street on which the Pathmark is located. However, the landlady did not ask Siwiak for the store's address, so she did not realize that it was actually located three miles () to the south. Since Siwiak did not know the man from the service he was supposed to meet, he told the agency how he would be dressed. Before leaving, he put on a jacket in a camouflage pattern, with matching pants and black boots. He also carried a backpack with different pants and sneakers to change into once he got to the Pathmark. Before leaving, his landlady pleaded with him to reconsider going there, as in her opinion it was a dangerous neighborhood no one should go to at night without a good reason, and especially on that night in particular, with the city's population anxious in the wake of the day's events. She was unable to deter him. Around 11 p.m., Siwiak got off the subway and exited. He began to walk west along Fulton Street toward Albany Avenue, several blocks away. A witness later recalled passing him as he did so. At the Albany intersection, he turned right, heading north, instead of south as his directions said. That area of the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant neighborhood had long been seen by residents and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) as one of the city's more dangerous, with regular drug dealing and the possibility of robbery and assault for those who ventured in unknowingly. A longtime resident told radio station WNYC that the block is only safe in the mornings, \\"after that, you're on your own.\\" All the NYPD's available officers were on duty that night, most already on overtime; some had even returned from distant vacations. Many were needed to provide increased security in the neighborhoods close to the fallen towers or possible targets for a feared follow-up attack; police officials feared that criminals elsewhere in the city would use that distraction to their advantage. One exception to this was the northernmost block of Albany Avenue. \\"I don't know if the World Trade Center falling down really affects the drug trade [there]\\", Michael Prate, the NYPD cold case detective in charge of the investigation, told The New York Times a decade later. Police believe Siwiak may have interacted with some of the individuals present on Albany at that time. At roughly 11:40 p.m., residents said later, they heard an argument, followed by gunshots. A woman living on nearby Decatur Street, who was taking care of her sick mother, said she heard them but was too afraid to look out the window. Siwiak, shot once in the lung, left a trail of blood drops that showed him staggering from where he was shot near the north end of Albany to the stoop of a rowhouse at 119 Decatur, where he rang the doorbell in search of help. A resident of that building told police that she had heard it, but like her neighbor, she was too fearful to answer the door, in the wake of the gunfire that had preceded it. Siwiak went back down the stoop and collapsed facedown into the street. At 11:42 p.m., a call was made to 9-1-1, and what police and ambulance services could respond came within minutes. Siwiak was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigation The NYPD could not bring its full investigative resources to the intersection since so many other officers were needed elsewhere due to the attacks. Normally, in the case of a homicide, its Crime Scene Unit would secure the area and collect forensic evidence, but its members were not available. Instead an evidence-collection unit, normally used only on nonviolent property crimes such as burglaries, performed those tasks. And where as many as nine detectives might canvass the neighborhood, talking to potential witnesses and looking for evidence away from the scene, the NYPD could only spare three, at most. \\"[Siwiak] wasn't afforded the initial experts in processing the homicide scene\\", Prate said in 2011. While he hoped the investigators who were able to respond collected all the evidence they could, he could not be sure they had, either. \\"The Police Department gave that investigation what it could do that day.\\" The evidence-collection technicians were able to retrieve spent shell casings from the .40-caliber handgun that was fired at Siwiak. The shooter had fired seven times but hit him only once.Nowy Dziennik, \\" Policja znalaz≈Ça po drugiej stronie ulicy 7 ≈Çusek. Ale tylko jedna kula trafi≈Ça Henryka.\\" In his wallet was $75 in cash, suggesting that robbery had not been the motive, or that it had been botched if it was. Lucyna Siwiak believes the killer may have thought her brother was a terrorist. His camouflage outfit made him appear military; the first police officers to respond to the scene thought he might have been one of the many National Guardsmen deployed to the city in the wake of the attacks. That, combined with his dark hair and imperfect, heavily accented English, may have led people to believe he was an Arab. \\"I think maybe it was a mistake\\", she said later. \\"There were many angry people.\\" While Prate allowed in his 2011 interview that that might have been possible, the NYPD has not classified the homicide as a hate crime since so little is known about it. \\"The problem was that there were no witnesses on that corner\\", another officer said early in 2002. \\"We haven't heard anything like that from any people in the community; nobody has indicated that to us\\", Prate told WNYC a decade later. \\"There is [sic] no significant targets that a terrorist would target here.\\" Prate does believe that Siwiak's poor English could have led to his death. He likely would not have understood what was happening if someone attempted to rob him. Prate continued to investigate the crime, which is now considered a cold case, until his retirement in 2011. He talked to suspects arrested for other crimes in the area; none of them have provided any information. No new witnesses have come forward. A $12,000 reward has been offered. In 2018 he told ABC News that a botched robbery was still his theory for the most likely cause of the homicide. The homicide received little of the media attention that might have led witnesses to come forward, because of the attacks and their aftermath; what coverage there was came at least a month later. Neither Siwiak's sister nor his widow believe the case will ever be solved. \\"I'm afraid this is forever\\", Ewa Siwiak told the Times in 2011. \\"I think the police have many, many cases and maybe they'll never call me\\", Lucyna said a few months later. She still attends the annual memorial services every September 11 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, if it is not too crowded. As the deaths from those attacks are not included in the city's official crime statistics for 2001, Siwiak's death is the only homicide recorded in New York City on that date. The FBI also did not record the 2,977 deaths from the attacks in their annual violent crime index for 2001, citing the fact that these deaths were statistical outliers and would erroneously skew FBI analyses.

It was the line's northern terminus and was the closest of Caernarfon's ultimately five stations to the historic town centre. Overview The Nantlle Railway was the first public railway in North Wales. It opened on 12 July 1828 and was horse-drawn throughout its life. Its primary purpose was to carry slates from quarries near Nantlle nine miles northwards to the quayside at Caernarfon where most were loaded onto ships. Other products such as lead, dung and iron ore were anticipated, but in practice slate was the clear number one northbound, with copper ore a distant second. Southbound traffic was almost monopolised by coal; carrying fare- paying passengers was an afterthought. The station thumb As with all other Nantlle Railway passenger stopping places, the Carnarvon Castle terminus had no platforms, passengers boarded from and alighted to the trackside. There was no separate station siding or reserved length of track, passenger trains simply stopped at an agreed place near the line's sole passenger building of any description, the \\"Booking Office\\", near the Harbour Office. Finances Passenger carrying did not begin until the railway (sometimes referred to as a tramway) had been running for 28 years, but it nevertheless made a significant contribution to income, e.g. over a quarter in 1862, but its profitability was another matter, particularly as it risked interfering with slate traffic. This issue exercised many contemporary minds. Services From the outset timetables appeared regularly in the \\"Carnarvon & Denbigh Herald\\" and in Bradshaw from October 1856.Example timetable in Bradshaw That of August and September 1856 shows three passenger trains taking 1hr 30mins southbound from Carnarvon Castle to Nantlle and 1hr 21mins northbound, the difference being caused by the prevailing gradients. The speed of six or seven mph compared favourably with what a horseless person from Nantlle could possibly hope to achieve, with effects carried as well. The trains had various mixtures of 1st, 2nd and 3rd class provision. All trains called at all stations (though, as at Carnarvon Castle, \\"stopping place\\" may have been a better description.) The final timetable published in June 1865 showed fewer trains but nearly equal timings north and southbound. There were extra trains on Saturdays but no Sunday service was ever provided. The timetable varied over the life of the service and by season. An additional stop, five minutes before arriving at the Castle terminus, appeared in October 1857, northbound only, advertised as \\"Carnarvon\\"; this disappeared soon afterwards never to reappear. Connecting coaches to Portmadoc were provided from Penygroes and formally advertised from 1860. Different class travel was provided, but the only shred of surviving evidence of what that meant can be gleaned from a press report concerning the line's sole passenger accident, which occurred near Bontnewydd in June 1861. This describes the train as \\"...consisting of the usual open passenger truck and a closed or first class carriage drawn by two horses.\\" The differences must have been real, as the return fares from Carnarvon Castle to Nantlle in 1857 were one shilling 3rd Class, one shilling and sixpence 2nd Class and Half a Crown 1st Class. In a forerunner of modern times the track was owned by and the responsibility of the Nantlle Railway Company, but the services were run by a private supplier - Edward Preston - acting under lease. The impact of the standard gauge By the 1860s the standard gauge Carnarvonshire Railway was being built. Its northern section from what would become Penygroes railway station to Coed Helen by the Afon Seiont south of Caernarfon would obliterate the Nantlle Railway tracks, leaving the tramway with stubs at both of its ends. During the construction period slates were transshipped twice - by pushing Nantlle trucks three at a time onto standard gauge wagons at Tyddyn Bengam north of Penygroes from where they were locomotive-hauled northwards to Hendy Crossing immediately north of what would become Carnarvon (Pant) station. At this point the process was reversed, with the Nantlle trucks being pushed back off the standard gauge wagons onto Nantlle rails. From that point they were horse drawn the last to Caernarfon quayside along the Nantlle company's traditional route. With complexity came delays, breakages and pilfering, with some traffic reverting to road. Passengers were not subject to this cumbersome process; the passenger service was suspended from 12 June 1865 and a through rail replacement service of coaches from Caernarfon to Nantlle was provided by a Mr Morton under contract. When the Carnarvonshire Railway line to Carnarvon (Pant) was opened the coach service to Nantlle ceased, but a shorter one was put in place between Pant and stations until the \\"Town Line\\" was opened in 1870 giving through running from to Bangor.Town line history, via Disused Stations Eventually a branch was built at the Caernarfon end from the standard gauge line to the quayside, rendering the tunnel at Coed Helen and the Nantlle's bridge across the Seiont redundant. This was a two-stage process. The first action by the LNWR (who had taken over the Carnarvonshire railway) was to build a trailing junction a short distance from the southern mouth of Caernarvon Tunnel, not far from the future site of the modern station,Photo of junction and standard gauge wagons on quayside, via Festrail leading into St Helens Road, where goods were transshipped to former Nantlle wagons to be handled on the quay. Later in the 1870s the standard gauge lines were extended to replace all the narrow gauge lines and infrastructure in the harbour area.Caernarfon Harbour with standard gauge tracks and wagons, via Britain from the Air (Free sign in needed to zoom)Caernarfon Harbour with standard gauge tracks and wagons, via Britain from the Air (Free sign in needed to zoom) Although redundant for some years the Nantlle's single-span stone bridge over the Seiont was not demolished until 1879-80. Likewise, at the southern end of the line a standard gauge branch was built from Penygroes to Talysarn, which was confusingly named , replacing the Nantlle trackwork. This nevertheless left a length of horse-drawn former Nantlle track in place between the standard gauge Nantlle station and the quarries in the Nantlle area which, remarkably, passed to British Railways (BR) at nationalisation in 1948 and remained in operation until 1963, being BR's last surviving horse- drawn remnant. Failed revivals At the beginning of the twentieth century the Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway (PBSSR) endeavoured to build an electric railway to connect Porthmadog with the village of Beddgelert and the North Wales Narrow Gauge Railway (NWNGR) at Rhyd Ddu. This venture also obtained powers to build a line to Betws-y-Coed and to connect with existing tramways and slate quarries. The PBSSR's life and history is complex, but two of its enabling Acts made provision for extensions from the northern end of the NWNGR from to the quayside at Caernarfon. The Act of 15 August 1904 authorised a line northwards from Dinas running near the LNWR's to line then veering westwards through the erstwhile Nantlle Railway's Coed Helen tunnel then crossing a new bridge approximately on the site of the original Nantlle Railway bridge over the Afon Seiont terminating on the quayside near the Harbour Offices. This route would effectively reinvent the Nantlle Railway's route from Dinas to Caernarfon Harbour. No source specifically mentions a station at this proposed northern terminus, but as the PBSSR was to be a mixed passenger and goods railway with designs on the tourist market, for it to go to the trouble of getting to Caernarfon without building a station would be very strange. In the event, nothing physical was done north of Dinas. An Order of 8 July 1908 gave the company power to abandon the route through Coed Helen tunnel, replacing it with a line (effectively a street tramway) along St Helens Road in Caernarfon, terminating near the castle. In the application to Parliament (which had been made as long ago as 1905) the estimated cost was \\"¬£3241...with ¬£500 allowed for a station located beneath the castle walls.\\" A great deal of activity took place surrounding the PBSSR and the NWNGR, almost all of which was politicking, meetings, inquiries and business dealings. The only action on the northern extension from Dinas to Caernarfon was the sale of some land by the Caernarfon Harbour Commission to the railway. No building work of any nature took place north of Dinas and powers to do so lapsed in 1910. The onset of the First World War stopped the machinations, but did not close them for good. On 18 October 1921 the Light Railway Commissioners opened a Public Enquiry into the whole question of narrow gauge railways in the Porthmadog-Beddgelert-Caernarfon area, not least in the light of significant unemployment. Caernarfon interests were in favour of the original aim of a through narrow gauge route from Porthmadog to Caernarfon, not least because the need to tranship goods and people at Dinas deterred traffic which even then was being lost to road transport. The LNWR supported all moves to build a unified line northwards from Porthmadog, but opposed a northern narrow gauge extension from Dinas. The Commission's finding was to support the formation of the Welsh Highland Railway which would join the PDSSR and NWNGR to give a through route from Porthmadog to Dinas, but the northern extension to Caernarfon was not backed and thereby died. Modern times No trace of the Nantlle Railway can be discerned on or north of St Helens Road in the lower town. Most if not all was obliterated when standard gauge lines were installed in the 1870s. Modern day road works have completed the job.

Oikos 118, 1830-1843, doi:10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17724.x (2009)  Definition of size asymmetry  Resource competition can vary from complete symmetric (all individuals receive the same amount of resources, irrespective of their size, known also as scramble competition) to perfectly size symmetric (all individuals exploit the same amount of resource per unit biomass) to absolutely size asymmetric (the largest individuals exploit all the available resource). The degree of size asymmetry can be described by the parameter Œ∏ in the following equation focusing on the partition of the resource r among n individuals of sizes Bj.Schwinning, S. & Fox, G. A. Population-dynamic consequences of competitive symmetry in annual plants. Oikos 72, 422-432, doi:10.2307/3546128 (1995) ri refers to the amount of resource consumed by individual i in the neighbourhood of j. When Œ∏ =1, competition is perfectly size symmetric, e.g. if a large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor, the large individual will acquire twice the amount of that resource (i.e. both individuals will exploit the same amount of resource per biomass unit). When Œ∏ >1 competition is size-asymmetric, e.g. if large individual is twice the size of its smaller competitor and Œ∏ =2, the large individual will acquire four times the amount of that resource (i.e. the large individual will exploit twice the amount of resource per biomass unit). As Œ∏ increases, competition becomes more size-asymmetric and larger plants get larger amounts of resource per unit biomass compared with smaller plants.  Differences in size-asymmetry among resources in plant communities  Competition among plants for light is size-asymmetric because of the directionality of its supply. Higher leaves shade lower leaves but not vice versa. Competition for nutrients appears to be relatively size- symmetric,Berntson, G. M. & Wayne, P. M. Characterizing the size dependence of resource acquisition within crowded plant populations. Ecology 81, 1072-1085, doi:10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[1072:ctsdor]2.0.co;2 (2000) although it has been hypothesized that a patchy distribution of nutrients in the soil may lead to size-asymmetry in competition among roots.Rajaniemi, T.

A large body of evidence shows that species loss following nutrient enrichment (eutrophication) is related to light competition (5, 15, 16).Hautier, Y., Niklaus, P. A. & Hector, A.

Herbivores and nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation. Nature 508, 517-520, doi:10.1038/nature13144 (2014) However, there is still a debate whether this phenomenon is related to the size-asymmetry of light competition or to other factors.Harpole, W. S. & Tilman, D. Grassland species loss resulting from reduced niche dimension. Nature 446, 791-793, doi:10.1038/nature05684 (2007) Contrasting assumptions about size-asymmetry characterise the two leading and competing theories in plant ecology, the R* theory and the CSR theory. The R* theory assumes that competition is size-symmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to withstand low level of resources (known as the R* rule).Tilman, D. Resource competition and community structure. Monographs in population biology 17, 1-296 (1982) In contrast the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric and therefore predicts that competitive ability in nature results from the ability to grow fast and attain a large size.Grime, J. P. Evidence for existence of three primary strategies in plants and its relevance to ecological and evolutionary theory. American Naturalist 111, 1169-1194 (1977) Size-asymmetric competition affects also several evolutionary processes in relation to trait selection. Evolution of plant height is highly affected by asymmetric light competition.Tilman, D. Plant strategies and the dynamics and structure of plant communities. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. 360. p. (1988)Falster, D. S. & Westoby, M. Plant height and evolutionary games. Trends in Ecology & Evolution 18, 337-343, doi:10.1016/s0169-5347(03)00061-2 (2003) Theory predicts that only under asymmetric light competition, plants will grow upward and invest in wood production at the expense of investment in leaves, or in reproductive organs (flowers and fruits). Consistent with this, there is evidence that plant height increases as water availability increases,Klein, T., Randin, C. & Korner, C. Water availability predicts forest canopy height at the global scale. Ecology Letters 18, 1311-1320, doi:10.1111/ele.12525 (2015) presumably due to increase in the relative importance of size-asymmetric competition for light. Similarly, investment in the size of seeds at the expense of their number may be more effective undersize-asymmetric resource competition, since larger seeds tend to produce larger seedlings that are better competitors.Falster, D. S., Moles, A. T. & Westoby, M. A general model for the scaling of offspring size and adult size. American Naturalist 172, 299-317, doi:10.1086/589889 (2008) Size-asymmetric competition can be exploited in managing plant communities, such as the suppression of weed in crop fields. Weeds are a greater problem for farmer in dry than in moist environments, in large part because crops can suppress weeds much more effectively undersize- asymmetric competition for light than under more size-symmetric competition below ground.

The memorial was commissioned by a Marlowe Memorial Committee, and comprises a bronze statue, The Muse of Poetry sculpted by Edward Onslow Ford, standing on a plinth decorated with statuettes of actors playing Marlowe roles. The statue is now situated outside the city's Marlowe Theatre. Memorial Committee The Marlowe Memorial at his current location near the Marlowe theatre A Marlow Memorial Committee was established in 1888, arising out of a conception on the part of the Elizabethan Society of Toynbee Hall, that Marlowe, perhaps because of his reputation as an atheist, lacked the national recognition that he deserved. James Ernest Baker of the Society wrote to the Standard newspaper on 28 July 1888 to draw attention to Marlowe's work and legacy, stating that he had \\"laid the foundations of English blank verse, which, in its more developed form through the medium of Shakespeare and Milton, has become the life-blood of English literature and the supreme instrument of tragic poetry.\\" A committee was formed in reaction to the letter, numbering amongst its officers Sidney Lee and Frederick Rogers of the Society, the former acting as treasurer; Lord Coleridge, the Lord Chief Justice of England acting as chairman; and with members including poets Robert Browning, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, James Russell Lowell, Edmund Gosse, Algernon Charles Swinburne, John Addington Symonds, Andrew Lang, Alfred Austin and Henry Beeching; the publisher Arthur Henry Bullen, editor Alexander Balloch Grosart, actor-manager Henry Irving; writers & critics Leslie Stephen, Richard Garnett; and scholars Horace Howard Furness and Francis James Child. The committee raised funds by subscription, and held a public reading at St James's Hall involving Irving and Ellen Terry, which raised ¬£100. Memorial Henry Irving unveiling the memorial in Buttermarket in 1891 The prominent Victorian sculptor Edward Onslow Ford was commissioned to create the memorial; there being no surviving image of Marlowe known at the time, Ford decided on an allegorical representation in the form of The Muse of Poetry, a scantily-clad lyric muse surmounting a square pedestal having statuettes of four notable players of Marlowe characters in niches on each side. These were to be (according to Rogers) Irving as Tamburlaine, George Alexander as Faustus, Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Edward II, and W. S. Willard as The Jew of Malta. Funds were insufficient to realise this plan, and the memorial, situated in the Buttermarket, was unveiled on 16 September 1891 by Irving, with his statuette as the sole plinth decoration. Rogers' asserts that the Memorial awakened a new interest in Elizabethan literature, and quoting Gosse ‚Äì \\"Marlowe had been successfully neglected for three-hundred years\\" noted that \\"he suddenly became the subject of leading articles in the chief newspapers and magazines, and of paragraphs and leaderettes in minor ones\\". Although the statue earned the nicknamed Kitty (the playwright was known as Kit), some objections were raised to the statue's dishabille, especially so near the Cathedral. Shrubbery, railings and four lanterns were erected around the statue in 1892. A close up of the memorial Much later, additional funds were raised to complete the vision, and a second unveiling was conducted by the novelist Hugh Walpole, who had briefly attended Marlowe's alma mater, The King's School, Canterbury. A contemporary source lists the statuettes on the plinth as Irving (Tamburlaine), Sir Johnston Forbes-Roberston as Faustus, James Keteltas Hackett as Edward II, and Edward Alleyn as The Jew of Malta. The statue has been resited on a number of occasions; first to King Street to make way for a World War I memorial; thence to Dane John Gardens in 1921. The memorial was damaged in a 1940 (or 1942) World War II bombing of the city, the muse being thrown to the ground. She was remounted, but facing in a new direction, an error corrected only in 1964. Two statuettes were stolen in 1977. Most recently the statue was again relocated to stand outside the Marlowe Theatre, Ian McKellen performing a rededication ceremony in 1993.

Some plastics are also Class B fire materials. Class B fires are distinguished from the other fire classes: Class A fires (\\"ordinary combustibles\\" such as wood, paper, or rubber); Class C fires (in which the burning material is energized electrical equipment) and Class D fires (in which the burning material is combustible metals). The less-commonly-used Class K (known outside the United States as Class F) refers to fires involving cooking oil or fat; these materials are technically part of Class B.JB Crippin, \\"Types of Fires\\" in Forensic Chemistry (ed. Max M. Houck: Academic Press, 2015), p. 219. Fires are classified by the proper extinguishing agent. While water is used on Class A fires, using water on a Class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter than the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use dry chemicals (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose dry chemicals such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211)Lon H.

One ten-year study, examining the years 1976 to 1985, found that 4.7% of hospitalized burn patients suffered burns from hot grease or oil, with 78% of such injuries occurring in the home. According to the National Fire Protection Association, between 2010 and 2014, nearly half (46%) of home structure fires reported to fire departments in the United States involved cooking; over the same time period, cooking equipment was implicated in 19% of home fire deaths, 44% of home fire injuries, and 17% of total direct property damage.Marty Ahrens, Home Fires Involving Cooking Equipment, National Fire Protection Association (November 2016).

Hibern√≥n was born to nobles who fell poor, and he was robbed when he sought to provide funds for his parents. This occurrence prompted him to revise his approach to material and spiritual goods and so he became a friar to cultivate his spiritual nature. His beatification received formal approval from Pope Pius VI in mid-1791. Life Although Andr√©s Hibern√≥n Real was born in 1534 at his uncle's house in Murcia, he spent his childhood in Alcantarilla where his parents lived. He was baptized in the Murcia Cathedral where his uncle was a chaplain. Andr√©s came from an old noble house that was reduced to poverty due to a range of adverse circumstances. His family had some land and Andr√©s helped them with agricultural tasks. But after a few years of drought they had to send him to work with another uncle in Valencia who raised cattle. This uncle assumed charge of his initial education in order to relieve his parents of their economic burden. In his late childhood and into adolescence he endeavored to earn funds that would support his parents and siblings. From the age of 14 he dedicated himself to caring for livestock and similar tasks. He frequented Marian shrines and had an ardent devotion to the Eucharist. By the age of twenty, he had saved eighty silver ducats and travelled back home to Murcia to help provide for his sister's impending marriage. En route home a group of thieves attacked him and stripped him of all he had. Hibern√≥n interpreted this as a sign of how much he depended on material goods and so resolved to labor for the remainder of his life for other goods that people could not take from him. In the Franciscan Order In Albacete in 1556 he sought admission to a convent of the Order of Friars Minor and was admitted on 1 November 1557 where he commenced his period of novitiate and received the habit. In February 1563 he applied to Peter of Alcantara's discalced convent of San Jos√© in Elche, and in 1564 attended the vesting of the habit of Saint Paschal Baylon. Elche was a house of studies. He remained there until 1574 save for a short duration of time in Villena. In 1574 his superiors sent him to undertake the establishment of a convent in Valencia where he became a friend and counselor of the Archbishop of Valencia Saint Juan de Ribera. In the course of his religious life Friar Andr√©s had occasion to live at a number of different friaries. Among the conventual activities that he carried out were the offices of cook, gardener, porter, janitor, and almoner, and he performed a variety of manual labor. He was noted for his humility, simplicity, and compassion for the poor and sick. When he went with alms to the villages, he helped the parish priests in the catechesis of their faithful, instructing the more rustic and less educated. On more than one occasion he seemed to repeat the Miracle of the Loaves and the Fishes, multiplying the bread to feed the hungry poor. If a friary was in short supply and in great need, the Provincial Father sent Friar Andr√©s as a beggar, and with this their situation improved. Andr√©s was believed to have the gifts of prophecy and of levitation when absorbed in prayer. He died in the early hours of 18 April 1602 in the friary of San Roque de Gand√≠a in Valencia, having foretold that exact date of his death in 1598. Veneration When word of his death spread, the friary was besieged by throngs seeking a small piece of his clothing or of something he had touched, as a relic. He was initially buried in the conventual Church of San Roque de Gand√≠a, to which pilgrims came seeking his intercession, or in thanksgiving for favors received. His incorrupt remains are now housed in the Murcia Cathedral ‚Äì though some are in Alcantarilla ‚Äì after being relocated from Gandia in 1936 due to the Spanish Civil War. The beatification for the late friar was proposed under Pope Urban VIII in 1624, but as the province was already involved in the cause of Paschal Baylon, no formal process was initiated and thus the cause did not come to fruition during that pontificate. The beatification did later receive formal approval from Pope Pius VI who confirmed the local 'cultus' ‚Äì or popular devotion ‚Äì in a decree issued on 22 May 1791.

As the sensor bulb resistance varies with temperature, different amounts of current flow through the coils. This produces varying magnetic fields. These fields interact with the magnetic field of a large permanent magnet, resulting in an indication of temperature. A Ratiometer type temperature indicating system consists of a sensing element and a moving-coil indicator, which unlike the conventional type has two coils moving together in a permanent-magnet field of non-uniform strength. The coil arrangements and the methods of obtaining the non-uniform field depends on the manufacturer's design. The main application behind in this ratiometer system is to find the unknown resistance, namely Rx. This plays a major role in the aircraft industry, in finding cylinder head temperatures exposed to turbine exhaust gases. It can also be used to measure temperatures of systems such as engine oil and carburetor air.  Methods of obtaining non-uniform magnetic coil  = Parallel coil = Parallel coil is a method of obtaining non-uniform coil in ratiometer systems in which the hairsprings are wounded parallelly in order to allow the signal to pass through it. = Cross coil = The coil is wound from 99.99% pure copper on a wood which was treated with many oxidizers and chemicals. The benefits from using foil inductors comes in the form of less distortion and higher dynamic headroom, when used on crossovers for modern high performance speakers. In these methods two parallel resistance arms are formed; one containing the coil and a fixed calibrating resistance R1, and the other containing a coil in series with a calibrating resistance R2 and the temperature-sensing element Rx. Both arms are supplied with direct current from the aircraft's main power source, but the coils are so wound that current flows through them in opposite directions. As in any moving-coil indicator, rotation of the measuring element is produced by forces which are proportional to product of the current and field strength, and the direction of rotation depends on the direction of current relative to the magnetic field. In a ratio meter, therefore, it follows that the force produced by one coil will always tend to rotate the measuring element in the opposite direction to the force produced by the second coil, and further more, as the magnetic field is of non-uniform strength, the coil carrying the greater current will always move towards the area of weaker field, and vice versa. When the temperature at the sensing element Rx increases, then in accordance with the temperature/resistance relationship of the material used for the element, its resistance will increase and so cause a decrease in the force created by it. When the measuring elements at the mid-position of its rotation, the currents in both windings can be in the same field strength simultaneously. A ratiometer systems, however, do not require hair springs for exerting a controlling torque, this being provided solely by the appropriate coil winding and non- uniform field arrangements. Should variations occur in the power supply they will affect both coils equally so that the ratio of current flowing in the coils remains the same and tendencies for them to move to positions of differing field strength are counterbalanced.E H J Pallet,2009, A Book of Aircraft Instruments References Measuring instruments ","title":"Ratio meter systems"},{"id":"51526033","text":"William Johnston is a paralympic athlete from Ireland competing mainly in category C1 events.

The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and unveiled in 1921; it is a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. The King's Somborne memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design; another, King's Somborne War Memorial, is situated in the nearby village of King's Somborne. Prior to the outbreak of war, Lutyens established his reputation designing luxurious country houses for wealthy clients. Like many of his war memorials, the commission for Stockbridge originated with a pre-war client. Lutyens designed Marshcourt, a country house on the edge of the town, for Herbert Johnson at the turn of the twentieth century; during the First World War, Johnson and his wife Violet ran a 60-bed military hospital out of Marshcourt and after the Armistice, Johnson was adamant that Stockbridge and the neighbouring village of King's Somborne should both have a memorial to the war dead. Herbert Johnson chaired the war memorial committees in both Stockbridge and King's Somborne; he also donated the site for the Stockbridge memorial and made a significant financial contribution towards its construction.Skelton, pp. 80‚Äì81. History and design The memorial stands in the east of Stockbridge, on the A3057 road near the junction with the A30. In Portland stone, it is one of Lutyens' fifteen War Crosses. It has a tapering shaft, to which the short arms are moulded close to the top, which sits on a splayed plinth. Below the plinth is a coved base, which forms a seat at the foot of the cross, similar to the memorial at King's Somborne. The whole memorial stands on four stone steps‚Äîsquare for the top two steps and circular for the bottom two. The names of the fallen from the First World War are inscribed on two sides of the plinth; the east side contains the dedication \\"OUR DEAD / THROUGH WHOM / WE LIVE / MCMXIV ‚Äì MCMXIX\\". The west face was originally inscribed \\"THANKS BE TO GOD / WHO GIVETH US / THE VICTORY\\", but this was replaced in 2008 with a dedication for the Second World War: \\"WE WILL REMEMBER THEM / MCMXXXIX ‚Äì MCMXXXXV\\". Black paint was added to the inscriptions in 2005 to improve legibility. The memorial was unveiled on 3 April 1921 by Violet Johnson. After Violet Johnson's death in 1923‚Äîpartly brought about by her wartime work running the hospital at Marshcourt‚ÄîLutyens designed a memorial cross to her, which was placed in Winton Hill Cemetery in Stockbridge, and which is today a grade II listed building. Stockbridge War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 7 February 1986. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

Chunbun Ancestral Rite refers to the annual memorial ritual held during Chunfen, or Chunbun in remembrance of the Go of Balhae, the founder of the Balhae empire. The ancestral rite takes place every year in Balhae Village, a small town located in Gyeongsan, South Korea.  History  The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is a legacy of the Balhae empire, a Northeast Asian state that existed from 698 C.E. to 926 C.E. Balhae has recently begun to receive scholarly attention from the Chinese, Korea, Russian, and the Japanese academia ever since the Chinese government launched the Northeast Project, an endeavor aimed towards amalgamating history of Chinese ethnic minorities under the unified multi-ethnic philosophy. The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is a significant legacy of the Balhae Empire and is also a channel of voice for Korean descendants of the Go of Balhae to contend that Balhae is a part of Korean history. The Chunbun Ancestral Rite is important especially in this context of disputed history.  Time  Chunfen, or Chunbun, refers to the 4th solar term defined by the traditional East Asian calendar, which divides a year into 24 solar terms. Though the exact date varies from year to year, the rite typically takes place on March 20. Supplies needed for the rite are prepared prior to the day of the memorial. The meal preparation for the rite begins in the morning. The memorial ritual is carried out typically at 11 AM. The ritual ends at approximately 1PM. Meals are provided for visitors for free after the memorial is fully over.  Location  * The rite is held in Balhae Village, a small town located in Songbaek-ri, Namcheon-myeon, Gyeongsan, Gyeongsangbuk-do, South Korea.The Balhae village was founded in 1592 before the Japanese invasion of Korea. Sun-geum Tae, the assistant secretary of the Chosun dynasty, spearheaded the establishment of the village. The Tae family has been living in the area since. Today, 30 Tae households (140 people) are residing in the area. * The rite is held in two shrine buildings simultaneously: the public shrine and the main shrine. The main shrine is immediately behind the public shrine and is located on a small hill.
