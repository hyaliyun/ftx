As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing. Any user in the network can serve a file by its content address, and other peers in the network can find and request that content from any node who has it using a distributed hash table (DHT).

His career was one of many firsts. Gibson was the first registered African American architect in the State of Indiana, first African-American architect to be appointed Indiana's State Architect, and first African-American architect in Indiana to own his own firm. His long career included work in both the public and private sector. Gibson overcame many obstacles to become successful and was generous in offering advice and helping younger architects achieve similar success. Personal life Gibson was born on June 2, 1925, in Cumberland, Maryland, and as a youth he moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he graduated from Crispus Attucks High School. He went on to graduate in the top five percent of his class at University of Illinois where he received a Bachelors and Masters of Science in Architectural Engineering. Gibson married Mary E. Gibson, and together they had two sons, Edwin A. Gibson, Jr. and Gary A. Gibson, and one daughter, Eve M. Williams. The Gibsons were grandparents to five grandsons: Edwin A. Gibson, Elliott A. Gibson, Jason P. Gibson, Delford G. Williams IV, and Brenton P. Williams, and two step-granddaughters: Laura E. Hanley and Melinda L. Hanley from their daughter-in-law Elizabeth Booth-Gibson. Edwin A. Gibson died in Danville, Indiana on November 20, 2011, at the age of 86. He was buried in Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis, Indiana. Practice His long career, which spanned from 1945 to 2002, included work in both the public and private sectors. He started at the venerable A. M. Strauss Associates, Inc., a Fort Wayne architecture firm, where he became a partner and treasurer in the firm. He later moved to Indianapolis to start his own firm. In 1962, Gibson won the Governor's Award for Outstanding Achievement, a year later, in 1963 he was appointed as Indiana State Architect, a position he held for two years, leaving in 1965 to work for Chas. W. Cole & Son, as the Architect- Director in charge of the Indianapolis office. The same year, the Indiana Society of Architects, AIA, honored Gibson with a recognition of meritorious service, which was presented to him on October 8, 1965. Gibson opened his own firm (Ed Gibson & Associates, Inc.), a general architecture and engineering company, in 1968. The company was in operation until 1986 when he dissolved the company, and left to work exclusively for Methodist Hospital. After leaving Methodist Hospital, Gibson worked as a consulting architect until his retirement in 2002. Some of the buildings he designed or renovated were located at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Evansville State Hospital, Central Elementary in Plainfield, Broad Ripple Library, renovations at Central Library in Indianapolis, IUPUI, IU Bloomington, including renovation of Ernie Pyle Hall, Hudnut Plaza, and other HUD projects throughout Indiana. When Gibson closed his private practice in 1987 to work exclusively for Methodist Hospital, most of the drawings in his office were discarded and those in this archival collection are the few examples of his work that remain. Shortly after his death in 2011, his family gave an additional donation of photographs and papers, including his Master of Science thesis, awards, and certificates to the Ball State University Drawings and Documents Archive. The family also donated Gibson's personal tape measure engraved with his initials, which can be viewed in the digital collection.

A small patio is located on the north side of the house. A staircase that is made of wood connects the patio to the base of the sand dune and Lake Front Drive. A concrete driveway and terraced wood steps connect the south side of the house to Fairwater Drive, at the base of the sand dune. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. Description The lot straddles a sand dune on the south side of West Lake Front Drive. Dr. Meyer and Mr. Harold Olin, the architect for the house, planted 1,000 saplings on the lot after the house was constructed. These included several white pine trees. The intent was for native vegetation to protect the dune from erosion. A wood staircase is located on the north slope of the sand dune. It connects the house to the street below; however it is badly deteriorated. Flagstones were placed on the ground on the north side of the house to create a small patio area. Flagstones were used for a path and stepping-stones around the northwest and northeast corners. A knoll has a terrace wall composed of flagstones on the east side of the brick wall.

Exterior  South face of the John and Gerda Meyer House, Beverly Shores, IndianaThe configuration is a small rectangular, two-story box with a flat roof. An early addition was created on the northwest corner of the house. Materials chosen for the construction of the home are contextual with the landscape. The house's lower level walls are composed of dark brown colored bricks. This forms a \\"base\\" on which the main level appears to float. The main level is covered with redwood heartwood siding, installed vertically and stained to mimic weathered driftwood. There are large sections of glass windows and doors. The windows and doors have thin metal sashes and wood casings. A tall trim board separates the lower level from the main level between the brick walls and wood siding. The roof appears like a flat plane. The roof is supported by wood rafters spaced on center. The rafters continue through the tops of the walls and support wide overhanging eaves. The owners used the roof as a roof-top deck for viewing the lake.

The upper level of the house overhangs the lower level. the lower level has a wood door with a full window on its west side. A wood side-lite with a full window is on the east side of the door. A sidewalk is in front of this section of wall. A soffit with recessed lighting is against the top of the wall over the sidewalk. This area, which is sheltered by the main level above, functions as a carport. The area west of the brick wall extension was a covered patio with a concrete floor.

Early life and influences Hartley was born in Cockermouth, England February 17, 1796, the fourth child and eldest son of Isaac and Isabella (Johnson) Hartley. Hartley's father moved to America in 1797 and his family followed in 1799; they tried to carve out a living on new land in Charlton, Saratoga County, New York, but realised that they were not suited to this lifestyle. After about two years, Hartley‚Äôs father started a mercantile business in the nearby city of Schenectady, New York. A short while later they moved from the City into the country for health reasons, but this came too late for Hartley‚Äôs mother who died in about 1807. Hartley's father remarried in about 1812 and the family moved to Broadalbin, New York. At the age of 16, Hartley took a position with a woollen manufacturer 10 miles from home where he lived with the owner‚Äôs family. The location was isolated and lacked any form of religious ministry; Hartley considered that this had led to a lowering of moral standards in the community and joined with others in establishing regular prayer meetings. After 4 years Hartley returned to work for his father and later attended Fairfield Academy, Herkimer County. In 1822 he moved to New York and was employed in dry goods, later starting his own mercantile business. In 1824 he married Catherine Munson, daughter of the Hon. Reuben Munson and Abigail Wiltse. Career =Work with the Presbyterian Church= Hartley was a member of the Presbyterian Church since his youth and joined the Young People‚Äôs Missionary Society whilst in his teens. In England Hartley‚Äôs father had been a religious Dissenter, whereas his wife was raised in the Established Church. Living In New York in 1824 he became a member of the Central Presbyterian Church and helped to distribute religious literature. It was at this time that he saw the squalid living conditions that the poor had to contend with in the City. Hartley later became a ruling elder at the Central Presbyterian Church at Broome Street and was instrumental in the move to Madison Square in 1854. =97th Regiment of State Infantry= In 1827 Hartley was commissioned as Captain in the 97th Regiment of State Infantry ‚Äì even though he had no military experience. For a time, this overshadowed his philanthropic and religious works whilst he came to terms with this new role. =New York Temperance Society= Hartley was one of the founders of the New York Temperance Society in 1829. Four year later he became the Corresponding Secretary and Agent. He set about reorganising and extending the scope of the society; publications were circulated and newspapers used to spread the message. Many thousands of the residents signed the pledge, and claims were made that the campaign led to a reduction in crime and pauperism. During his investigations he discovered that much of the waste product from the brewing and distilling industries was used to feed farm animals. He claimed that there was a link between the production of unhealthy milk from these animals and a rise in infant mortality. =New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor= In 1842 Hartley resigned his position as Corresponding Secretary and Agent having fulfilled his mission. He was asked to continue as the Secretary and Treasurer, and held this position for many years. He next became the Corresponding Secretary and Agent for the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. The association‚Äôs mission was to help people find their way out of impoverishment, providing guidance, advice and the bare minimum of charitable aid. Applicants were assessed by volunteers and subjected to strict selection criteria. Those that were already entitled to support from other organisations, such as the old and infirmed, were excluded from the scheme. Over the following years the association‚Äôs scope expanded to include medical aid, tenement housing, child protection, hygiene, sanitary improvements, relief for the disabled and support for soldiers and sailors injured during the Civil War. Other work included a census on social conditions in the city and a report on the situation of those who were crowded together in damp and badly ventilated cellars. Hartley eventually resigned from the association due to failing health in 1876. He also resigned as the Secretary of the Presbyterian Hospital at this time, an establishment that he helped to found in 1868. Several other charitable organisations evolved from the work being done by the Association. These included the New York Juvenile Asylum, the Demilt and North Western Dispensaries, Public Washing and Bathing Establishment, Children‚Äôs Aid Society, Working Men‚Äôs Home and the Society for the Ruptured and Crippled. Personal life Hartley and his wife had a large family, including Isaac Smithson Hartley and Marcellus Hartley. Hartley‚Äôs wife Catherine died in 1873 and he died on March 3, 1881, the same day as his grand-daughter Emma died; she was the wife of Norman White Dodge and mother of Marcellus Hartley Dodge Sr., who had been born three days before.

He wrote the work in 1980, a setting of Psalm 130 in Latin for a four-part men's choir, percussion (ad. lib.) and organ. It was first performed at the Martinskirche, Kassel on 25 April 1981, conducted by Klaus Martin Ziegler. P√§rt dedicated the work of around 7 minutes to Gottfried von Einem. It was published by Universal Edition. P√§rt arranged it for chamber orchestra in 2008.  History  P√§rt composed the work a year after he left Estonia for first Vienna and then Berlin. He set Psalm 130 in Latin, a text speaking of profound distress which has inspired composers through the centuries, from polyphonic settings by Josquin des Prez to use in an opera of the 21st century by Lera Auerbach. P√§rt composed the work in his personal tintinnabuli style, using simple means of expression. He scored it for a four-part men's choir (), percussion (ad lib.) and organ, and dedicated it to the Austrian composer Gottfried von Einem. It was first performed at the Martinskirche, Kassel on 25 April 1981 by the Vokalensemble Kassel conducted by Klaus Martin Ziegler. P√§rt arranged it for chamber orchestra in 2008.  Music  The composer in 2008 De profundis is in one movement, set for a male choir in four parts, organ and percussion. The optional percussion might be bass drum, tam-tam and a single tubular bell. The organ provides in deep registers a slow continuous ostinato pattern. P√§rt built the voices from simple melodic phrases, increasing gradually to a climax. They begin in low register, rising and reaching a passage of unison of the four parts, before returning to silence, marked by a final sound of a bell.  Selected recordings  De profundis was first recorded in 1990 sung by the Hilliard Ensemble as part of a CD Arbos of sacred music by P√§rt. It appears on a 1996 CD titled De Profundis, performed by the choir Theatre of Voices conducted by Paul Hillier. A reviewer wrote: \\"De Profundis (1980) is an impassioned and yet simple vocal setting ... where the voices climb out of the very depths of despair, with a funereal drum beat. Immediately we are drawn into an atmosphere of impassioned worship and reverence.\\" It was recorded in 1997 by the choir Polyphony, conducted by Stephen Layton, among many other recordings. The piece closes a 2013 recording, again titled De profundis, sung by Orphei Dr√§ngar, and conducted by Cecilia Rydinger Alin. The program notes describe the composition as a meditative setting creating \\"a mystical atmosphere\\".

He was the second significant Persian calligrapher after Mir Emad. He had artistic influence on the later calligraphers.  Biography  Mir Ali Heravi was from Herat. In 1506, he emigrated with his family to Mashhad, but after a short time they came back to Herat and stayed there. When he was young, he was a scrivener of orders and instructions for the governor of Herat. Then he started working as a calligrapher in the court of Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara. He became the King's favorite calligrapher and was titled as Kateb os-Soltan. He signed some of his works with Mir Ali al-Kateb os-Soltani. He lived in Herat until the death of Sultan Husayn Mirza Bayqara. After King's death, he lived sometimes in Mashhad and sometimes in Herat. In 1512, Ismail I captured Herat. In this time, Heravi became the prot√©g√© of Karim od-Din Habibollah Savoji. After Habibollah's murder, when Sam Mirza Safavi, the brother of Tahmasp I, was the governor of Khorasan, Mir Ali Heravi was in Herat for 3 years until 1528. In 1528, Obeid Khan captured Herat for a short time and took Mir Ali Heravi to Bukhara and appointed him as a scrivener and calligraphy teacher of his son, Abdolaziz Khan. Mir Ali Heravi lived 16 years in Bukhara. He was not allowed to leave the city. He died in 1544 in Bukhara. Because of homesickness and obligatory emigration to Bukhara and being far from family, Heravi lived in this city under depression and sadness. Heravi was Zein od-Din Mohammad's student. Zein od-Din Mohammad learned calligraphy himself from Soltan Ali Mashhadi.  His students  Mir Ali Heravi had seven important students: * Mir Mohammad Bagher, who was a calligrapher in the court of Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana, Humayun and Akbar. * Khaje Mohammad Shabestari, the chief of Herat's police station. * Ahmad Mashhadi, the scrivener and a companion of Tahmasp I. * Mir Hossein Bokharaei * Malek Deilami, Mir Emad's calligraphy teacher. * Mir Heidar Bokharaei * Mir Chalame  References   External links  Mir ‚ÄòAli KƒÅteb (Heravi), Reed College Category:People from Herat Category:Iranian calligraphers Category:1544 deaths ","title":"Mir Ali Heravi"},{"id":"47786228","title":"Mika Kanai"},{"id":"47786241","text":"also known as My 3 daughters is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Pretz Matsumoto starting in October 2005, which later became an anime television series from April 4, 2008 until December 28, 2010.

It is the first title in Namco's Tales series. Initially released for the Super Famicom in December 1995, it was later ported to a number of other platforms, including a Japan-exclusive version for the PlayStation in December 1998 and a Game Boy Advance version published by Namco in Japan in August 2003 and later published by Nintendo in North America and Europe in March 2006, which marked the first time the game was officially available in English. A PlayStation Portable remake known as followed in September 2006, featuring full voice acting during story scenes, which was later included with further enhancements as part of Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X in June 2010. The game's producers have given it the characteristic genre name beginning with the PlayStation version, with the Full Voice Edition given the moniker . An unofficial fan translation of the original Super Famicom version was released on February 12, 2001 by Dejap. The game takes place in a fantasy world of Aselia and follows Cress Albane and his allies who must travel through time in order to destroy Dhaos, a demon king who seeks to wreak havoc upon the world. The game was written and programmed by Yoshiharu Gotanda, designed by Masaki Norimoto, and scored by Motoi Sakuraba, Shinji Tamura and Ryota Furuya. The character designs were created by manga artist K≈çsuke Fujishima. A short anime series based on the game, called Tales of Phantasia: The Animation, was released in 2004.  Gameplay  = Battle system = Screenshot from the original Super Famicom version In the Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS), the fight is played out on a two-dimensional terrain that usually stretches wider than a single screen width, so the screen can scroll to the left and to the right, depending on where the characters and opponents are relatively located. LMBS contains a pause menu during battle which lets the player select a spell or item. As in some fighting games, it is possible to assign items or combination moves to specific buttons as shortcuts for quick actions. As opposed to most other turn-based systems where the player controls the individual actions of every party member, in LMBS, the player only directly controls the main character in real-time. The other characters in the party can be set to passive mode (defend only), active mode and attack (computer- controlled), or the player can often force the characters to move or use a spell from the pause menu. For the titles that allow multiplayer, the other party characters can be controlled by other human players.  Plot  = Characters = * , the main character of Tales of Phantasia, is a 17-year-old swordsman from a small village who grew up with his best friend Chester. A natural warrior who learned the way of fighting from his father, he is otherwise an earnest and caring individual who develops romantic feelings for Mint. He is voiced by Takeshi Kusao in the Japanese version. * is a 17-year- old archer and Cress's hometown friend. Highly devoted to his friends and family, he has a one-track mind and a tendency to rush into situations without thinking of the consequences. He is voiced by Takeshi Kusao in the Super Famicom version, Kentarou Itou for all other Japanese appearances. * is a 17-year-old priestess and daughter of a famous cleric. She commands powerful healing magic and possesses a strong sense of duty and courage that override her otherwise quiet and modest personality. She is voiced by Satomi Koorogi in the Super Famicom version, Junko Iwao in all other Japanese versions. * is a 29-year-old man with a deep knowledge of spirits. With the aid of magical rings, he is able to summon spirits after defeating them. He lives with a woman named Mirald Rune, who helps him with research into magic and summoning. He is voiced by Kazuhiko Inoue in all Japanese versions. * is a 17-year-old half-elf magician. She uses a broomstick both to fly and to wield as a weapon, and is characterized by a bright, airy personality that masks her years of discrimination due to her mixed heritage. She is voiced by Mika Kanai in all Japanese versions. * is an 11-year-old ninja and the granddaughter of her village's chief. Originally a non-playable character in the Super Famicom version, Suzu became an optional playable character in the PlayStation version and onwards. She is voiced by Taeko Kawata in all Japanese versions. = Story = The game begins as four heroes are locked in battle with a powerful sorcerer king named Dhaos. Before he can be defeated, Dhaos uses his magic to travel several years into the future, where he is immediately met by one of the four warriors' descendants and three companions, who seal him away with two magic pendants.???: Is the task appointed to my family throughout the generations fulfilled at last? Twelve years later, two young men named Cress and Chester return to their village to find it razed to the ground by a dark knight named Mars, whose army kills many of its inhabitants including Cress's parents and Chester's sister. While Chester stays behind to bury them, Cress leaves to meet his uncle Olson for help, who reveals that he is being forced to work for Mars before stealing his father's pendant and locking him in jail.Cress: Uncle, what's this!?/Olson: I'm sorry... We had no choice... If we refused, our city would suffer the same fate as Toltus. Please forgive me... Quickly escaping with the help of a dying woman in a nearby cell, he meets another prisoner, a young priestess named Mint, who reveals that the woman was her mother before the two leave through the dungeon's aqueducts.Mint: Um, thank you so much for freeing me. We should get out here as fast as we can. Yes, let's go!!! Please free my mother, too!!! She's in a cell over that way.\\" After rendezvousing with Chester, the party meets Trinicus D. Morrison, one of the four heroes who sealed Dhaos away years ago, who reveals that their parents were once his comrades and is shocked to discover that Cress and Mint's pendants were stolen.Cress: The black-armored man stole it when I was captured. Why is that pendant so important?/Morrison: This is terrible... It may already be too late. May the gods help us... Following him to a nearby mausoleum, the group encounters Mars just as he uses the pendants to break the seal on Dhaos's tomb, setting him free. As Mars is killed by the dark sorcerer after asking for his power, Trinicus laments that no force in this time can possibly stop Dhaos, and uses his magic to send Cress and Mint back through time to seek out a means to do so while Chester stays behind to cover their escape.Morrison: He can't be slain by weapons. I'm going to use my divine power to send you to another place. There, you must learn how to slay him. There's no other way. The two arrive one hundred years in the past to a time before Dhaos was initially sealed, where the villain is currently waging a war with his demon armies against the human kingdoms. Learning that only magic can harm him, they seek the aid of a young mage named Arche Klein, and summoner named Claus F. Lester, who accompany them to Dhaos's castle. After a fierce showdown, Dhaos escapes once again, and the party makes their way to an ancient city called Thor that houses a functional time machine to return to the future.Claus: Allow me to explain in layman's terms... Apparently an ancient kingdom sank to the bottom of the sea. It was called...Thor. They used incredible technology to actually travel through time. Arriving just moments after they first left, Cress and his companions join Chester in his fight against Dhaos and seemingly defeat him for good. However, they are approached by a traveler named Harrisson from 50 years in the future who tells them that Dhaos is now ravaging the world in his time.Harrisson: I've traveled back in time 50 years by the order of the King of Alvanista./Claus: \\"Really? From the future!?/Harrisson: Several years have already passed since Dhaos appeared in our time. The world is on the verge of utter destruction... and you people are our only hope. Using the Thor machine once again, the team arrives in the new period where they meet a ninja named Suzu who accompanies them (except in the original release). After meeting with a group of elves, Cress obtains the legendary Eternal Sword, the only thing that can stop Dhaos from moving through time, and travel to his invisible fortress for the final confrontation. After finally defeating him, the party learns from a tree spirit named Martel that he is a visitor from a dying planet called Derris- Kharlan, whose world was slowly withering due to the death of its world tree, the source of all mana and lifeblood of everything in it. Attempting to obtain a seed from this planet's world tree, Yggdrasil, Dhaos instead found that its power was fading as well due to the humans' constant misuse of mana-based technology, and decided to wipe them out to save it.Martel: He needed the Mana Seed to save his own world. It is said the Seed is born from mana that has amassed in the Great Tree Yggdrasil... The technology from magitech was powerful enough to suck up all the mana... Letting it continue would cause the Great Tree to wither and die. This is how the war between human users of magitech and Dhaos began... As the party members realize that by saving their world they have doomed his, Martel takes pity on their plight and sends a mana seed into space in an attempt to rejuvenate Derris-Kharlan's tree as Cress and his team return to their proper times.Martel: O blessed Earth, blessed Universe and blessed Gods! May thy merciful spirit grace this imperfect soul with thy power... I beseech thee! Deliver a Mana Seed unto this world!  Development  Tales of Phantasia was developed by members of \\"Wolf Team\\", a studio originally created by Telenet Japan. The story was based on an unpublished Japanese novel called , written by the game's total programmer Yoshiharu Gotanda. The world was primarily based around Norse mythology, science fiction elements were incorporated, and some names were taken from the works of Michael Moorcock and H. P. Lovecraft to accommodate fans of western fantasy fiction. Many changes were made to Gotanda's original story, including the title, character names, and the omission of several proposed scenarios. Due to poor experiences with their parent company, the team sought a different publisher for their title. After unsuccessfully pitching the project to Enix, they secured a publishing contract with Namco. The game includes voice clips during battles and certain story points as well as the opening theme song sequence, which necessitated the use of a high-capacity 48-megabit game cartridge. To help fit the voice acting into the game, the team used a sound system dubbed the Flexible Voice Drive, which enabled full recording of both the dialogue and theme song. The use of voice acting was a noted talking point leading up to the game's release. The redone character designs and artwork was handled by manga artist K≈çsuke Fujishima. The Linear Motion Battle System, which would become a mainstay of the series, was inspired by fighting games, which had become popular at the time. During the later stages of development, there were internal conflicts, leading to a large number of development staff leaving Wolf Team and establishing independent development company tri-Ace. = Later versions = In August 1998, one month before the release of the series' second main title, Tales of Destiny, Namco announced that it would also release a PlayStation version of Tales of Phantasia, which was made available in Japan the following December. The remake contains new features including an animated opening sequence produced by Japanese studio Production I.G., re-drawn character sprites and backgrounds, a 3D-rendered world map, and re-recorded character audio to better accommodate the compact disc format. Elements used in Destiny, such as the inclusion of animated Skits and a modified version of the battle system resembling that used in Destiny, were added. For the battle system, the team wanted to increase the overall battle speed and combo potential. Suzu Fubayashi, a non-playable supporting character in the original release, was also made playable as an optional party member. Namco Hometek translation producer Aki Kozu explained that the company eventually passed on an English release due to \\"Timing and market demand\\", as well as the development team being too busy with Tales of Eternia to properly support a localization effort. The team also felt that \\"[Eternia] was going to be a much better game than [Phantasia] and had a better chance of succeeding in the US market\\". In May 2002, Namco and Nintendo entered into a partnership that both allowed the two companies to cooperate on a new installment of the Star Fox franchise, Star Fox: Assault, and for Namco to develop several exclusive titles for Nintendo's GameCube and Game Boy Advance hardware. One such title, a Game Boy Advance version of Tales of Phantasia, was announced shortly after the deal signing for an originally expected release of December 2002. Namco first showcased the game in March 2003 with a revised release date set for the following June, and eventually received granted it a finalized release for August 2003, one month before Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube. The Game Boy Advance version was based on both preceding versions of the game, and included the Super Famicom release's original opening and two-dimensional world map, and the PlayStation remake's character voices, reduced enemy encounter rate and gameplay tweaks. An English-language version of Tales of Phantasia was announced for the first time in November 2005 by Nintendo Vice President of Sales and Marketing Reggie Fils-Aime for release in North America and Europe in March 2006. In June 2006, Namco announced during a press conference that the game was being remade for the PlayStation Portable handheld as , and would be released the following September. The remake features all the previous features of the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance versions as well as voice-overs for all story text, the ability to walk in eight directions instead of four on map screens, and a new \\"Grade Shop\\" function seen in later games in the series. It made an appearance at 2006 Tokyo Game Show alongside other Namco Bandai titles shortly after release. In March 2010, Namco Bandai announced that its upcoming PlayStation Portable role-playing game Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X would include another remake of Tales of Phantasia called as a bonus title. The new version features a faster, more streamlined battle system where casting magic spells no longer temporarily pauses the action on screen, allowing more attacks to occur simultaneously. A cellphone port of Game Boy Advance version was released in Japan in 2010. The iOS version was released in 2013. The version is free-to- play, but is different from other versions in removing some save points and relying heavily on an in-app purchase system. On May 29, 2014 the Japanese iOS version was discontinued after which the game cannot be started or played. The English version of the game was discontinued on August 28, 2014.  Related media  = Audio = The music of Tales of Phantasia was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, Shinji Tamura, and Ryota Furuya, with the PlayStation release also featuring songs from other Namco titles such as Rally-X, written by Nobuyuki Ohnogi, and Ridge Racer by Shinji Hosoe. It features the opening theme song , performed by Yukari Yoshida in the Super Famicom and Japanese Game Boy Advance versions and YO-MI in the PlayStation version. Yoshida would also perform the PlayStation version's ending theme, . Namco would replace the opening theme in the English Game Boy Advance release with an original instrumental piece. Although the original Super Famicom version did not receive a commercial soundtrack at the time of its release, an official album for the PlayStation remake was made available in May 1999 by Victor Entertainment, and features 77 songs across two discs. A number of radio drama albums were also produced, beginning with a three-volume set called by Movic released between May and July 1999. A two-volume set called was released the following year between January and March 2000, as well as a stand-alone album called released in December 2001. = Books and manga = Famitsu Bunko published a series of related novels written by Sara Yajima in 1999 and 2000. The series contains seven books: the two-volume , , , , and . Other books contains: the novel , written by Ryouji Matsuri and published by Dengeki Bunko in 1999; and written by Ry≈´nosuke Kingetsu, which published by Movic in 2000. A manga adaptation of the game, simply titled Tales of Phantasia, was serialized in the Kadokawa Shoten's magazine Tales of Magazine, starting in its first issue on 7 August 2008, marking the first manga adaptation of the game in the twelve years following the game's release. It was released as compiled Tank≈çbon in 2009. Each version of the game was accompanied by the release of an official game guide, along with several illustration books. = OVA = The Tales of Phantasia: The Animation is an adapted OVA of the game. The anime contained four 30-minute episodes. It released in Japan from November 2004 to February 2006 and distributed by Geneon in America in January 2007. CVs were shared with the same of the games. It was animated by Actas, and directed by Takuo Tominaga (episodes 1-3) and Shinjiro Mogi (episode 4). The plot of the OVA is generally based on the game's plot, but there are details in the anime that are not in the game, namely, additional scenes and dialogue. However, the episodes themselves focus on the party's encounters with Dhaos and the scenes involving the Tree of Life and the Elves, omitting a great portion of the story told in the original game. The opening theme and ending theme \\"Priere\\" both were composed by Mika Watanabe & Ikuko Noguchi, lyriced by tomo and performed by Masami Suzuki. Some related products of the OVA were released in Japan. In 2005, Frontier Works released an original Tales of Phantasia: The Animation Original Soundtrack, it contains 49 tracks and span 73min 15s. The company then released a series of drama CDs in 2006; it contain six CDs each featuring one of the playable characters of the game. Ichijinsha also released the book \\"Tales of Phantasia: The Animation The Animation Art Graphy\\" in 2006, which features illustrations of the anime character designer, special talking between voice actors of Cress and Mint, along with an interview of the game character designer K≈çsuke Fujishima. =Sequel= A sequel, Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon, was released for the Game Boy Color on November 10, 2000. It was the first game in the Narikiri Dungeon series. A remake of the sequel, Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon X, was released on August 5, 2010 for the PlayStation Portable.  Reception  The original Super Famicom release of Tales of Phantasia received a 30 out of 40 total score from Japanese Weekly Famitsu magazine based on individual review scores of 8, 7, 6, and 9. Readers of the magazine would later declare the game to be their favorite Namco title of all time in an August 2003 poll. GameFans panel of three reviewers scored it 90, 86 and 82 out of 100, with one of the reviewers concluding that it \\"is the best RPG I've ever played in Japanese on the Super Famicom\\". Sales of the title were slow during its debut month, which series producer Makoto Yoshidzumi attributed to being released at nearly the same time as Enix's popular Dragon Quest VI, and would sell a total of 212,000 copies in the region. While the PlayStation remake scored slightly lower in Famitsu in 1998, it ended up being far more commercially successful by selling around 769,000 copies in Japan. The 2006 PlayStation Portable Full Voice version sold around 136,000 copies. The iOS free-to-play version was downloaded at least 150,000 times in its first 5 days. = Game Boy Advance version = The Game Boy Advance release marked the first official English- language appearance of Tales of Phantasia, which was met with mostly positive reception in the West, earning a 73% average from GameRankings and 76 out of 100 rating from Metacritic. While websites such as GameSpot felt that the game distinguished itself from other role-playing titles with its action-based combat system, it also overly-relied on too many random battles to \\"drag down the pacing and pad out the playing time\\". IGN commented that the battle system was unrefined when compared to later games in the series such as Tales of Symphonia on the GameCube, but that the graphic and audio quality held up \\"relatively well\\" eleven years after its original release. The site would also call the story and characters \\"amazing\\", but that its dated design would only appeal to players familiar with older games in the genre, calling it a \\"love/hate\\" experience. Editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly similarly remarked that \\"fans of traditional RPGs will appreciate its long, varied dungeons and action-packed, real-time battles,\\" and that it \\"still has an awful lot of charm for such an old game\\". Eurogamer expressed that the title's late release near the end of the handheld's life hurt it when compared to similar ports on Sony's PlayStation Portable, and that the game's \\"messy\\" interface and \\"rough around the edges\\" localization paled in comparison to the Super Famicom's unofficial fan translation. The game would go on to sell approximately 314,000 copies worldwide by December 2007. In December 2012, Game Informer named Chester one of the best characters in the Tales series due to his struggle throughout the story to come to terms with the death of his sister, stating that \\"The whole process builds slowly, but it's done in such a natural way that it makes Chester's transformation believable.\\" = iOS version = The iOS version, however, was panned by critics, garnering a 35 out of 100 rating from Metacritic. Pocket Gamer gave the game a 4/10, calling it \\"A port with potential ruined by obtrusively implemented IAPs\\". TouchArcade gave the game 1 star out of 5, criticizing the heavy use of In-App Purchases as well as how some of the save points (mainly the ones near bosses) have been disabled. Digital Spy gave the game a rating of 2 out of 5, criticizing the overly sensitive and unresponsive controls and how the game auto-saves in the middle of a fight.

A 54-episode anime television series aired on TV Asahi from January 12, 1991 through February 29, 1992. Each episode of the anime contained two 11-minute stories, often unconnected with each other. A short movie (OVA?) was released in 1992. The anime was made into an anime comic format with six episodes per volume. The first volume was released on July 25, 1991. After the end of the series, many of the anime's staff moved on to Sailor Moon (which would succeed this series in its timeslot), including director Junichi Sato and music composer Takanori Arisawa. Many references to Goldfish Warning! are made in Sailor Moon's first season. A complete DVD set of the series was released on March 24, 2005. Plot Chitose Fujinomiya, former heiress and currently an orphan, has been kicked out of her super elite school, Tokai no Gakuen (City Academy), and shunned by her former friends. She is sent to a rural public school, Inaka no Chugakko (Country Jr. High School), where even pigs, oxen and chickens are students. The only possession she has left is a pink goldfish named Gyopi, given to her by her beloved father, and very valuable. Her family's attorney attempts to steal Gyopi, but is foiled by Chitose's new schoolmates, namely Wapiko, a simple girl who can outrun almost anything and is well-liked in school. As it turns out, Chitose isn't poor; the attorney was merely hiding her inheritance for himself. Instead of going back to the super rich school, she buys the rural school and attempts to transform it into a refined school to compete with that of her rival/former best friend. However, the students of the rural school don't want to be refined. Characters =Students= ; : :A very uptight girl with long blonde hair that is kept back with a hair band, she's worried that the students of Shin- Inaka no Chugakko (Wapiko especially) will cause her newly-formed school to be worse than Tokai no Gakuen. She is very arrogant to the point where she is unable to escape from a burning building due to her belief that she was raised as a high-class girl, and that she is not as tough as all the country students of Shin-Inaka no Chugakko, (who had all escaped form the building except Wapiko due to her trying to get Chitose to escape) as well as trying to frequently ban all normal customs of the school to enforce a more \\"proper\\" custom, such as a Tea Ceremony Club, but ultimately fails, due to her plans usually backfiring. She is the president of Shin-Inaka No Chugakko. ; : :An eccentric pink-haired girl who perhaps best inhabits the description of \\"spunky\\", the agile Wapiko may be viewed as the closest thing the series offers to a true heroine. Almost always depicted in a comical chibi art style, she nearly always has a smile on her face and a happy-go-lucky personality, despite often being a chief instigator of events that bring anguish to Chitose. For being a middle school student, Wapiko tends to act and (for all appearances) think like a small child. Nevertheless, her super speed, bloodhound-like nose, winning spirit and bottomless appetite for fun have earned her the respect of the entire student body -- minus Chitose, of course. Despite Chitose owning Gyopi, she and the goldfish are quite close to each other. ; : :Wapiko's classmate, the sub-president of Shin-Inaka no Chugakko (New Country Jr. High school). A doctor's son. His nickname is \\"Shu-chan\\", but he's called \\"Shu-bo\\" by Aoi, and \\"Mr. Bluewhale\\" by Tamiko. ; : :The blonde sunglasses-wearing love interest of Yurika. ; : ; : ; : ; : ; : =Staff= ; : ; : ;  Theme songs  ;Opening theme :* Wapiko Genki Yohou by Junko Uchida ;Ending themes :* Super Kingyou by Junko Uchida :* Gyopi Dance by Junko Uchida  Video games  There were three Goldfish Warning! video games released in Japan.

In 2015, it was ranked the 10th best pizzeria in the United States by TripAdvisor. John's is known for its graffiti-carved wooden booths where any patron can carve their name. The pizzeria does not serve slices, only whole pies cooked in an 850¬∞ F oven, along with calzones, and accepted cash only until 2016. John's began accepting credit cards in May 2016. History John's was founded in 1929 by John Sasso, originally located on Sullivan Street in Greenwich Village. After losing his lease in 1934, he moved the pizzeria to Bleecker Street. The restaurant was later purchased by the Vesce brothers in 1954. In the 1960s Augustine (Chubby) Vesce purchased John's Pizzeria from his brother Joe. He and his wife Rose became the owners of John's until 1980-81. Augustine suffered from health issues and offered 40% of the restaurant's shares to current manager at the time, Pete Castellotti Sr, if he continued to manage the business, allowing Augustine to retire. A year to two later, Castellotti opened up John's on 65th St, then moved to Florida and opened John's of New York in Port Charlotte, letting his two children Pete Castellotti Jr. and Lisa Free run John's of Bleecker Street together with his longtime co-worker Robert \\"Bob\\" Vittoria.

She then opened John's Pizzeria on Times Square in 1994. In 1993, Bob Vittoria became the majority partner of John's Pizzeria on Bleecker. He is a nephew of the Vesce family.

The manga by K≈çichi Tokita ran from April 1996 to March 1997, outlasting the anime by three months, and was collected in three volumes. Sequels After War Gundam X: Under The Moonlight, also known as New Mobile Century Gundam X: Under the Moonlight, is the sequel manga to the After War Gundam X anime and was released between 2004 and 2006. The manga takes place seven years after the final episode in the series. The four-volume series stars a new cast of characters different from those in the anime, but includes the same designs and mechanical drawings of the ships and mobile suits featured in the anime. The series focuses on Rick Aller and a Newtype pilot from the 7th Space War named Kai, as well as a mysterious organization that has rebuilt D.O.M.E. after its destruction at the end of the After War Gundam X anime. This series was written by Chitose Oojima, with artwork by Yutaka Akatsu, and design cooperation from Takyuki Yanase. Originally planned as only a short series in Gundam Ace, the popularity of it caused it to be expanded and compiled into a four-volume manga series published by Kadokawa Shoten. A one-shot sequel manga supervised by the original anime's director Shinji Takamatsu, written by the anime's series composition writer Hiroyuki Kawasaki and illustrated by K≈çichi Tokita was included as a bonus material for the Blu-ray release of the series on March 23, 2018.

Reception According to Japan's Weekly The Television magazine, the series' terrestrial broadcast ratings peaked at 6.2% with the first episode, then declined drastically over the first ten episodes, and averaged 4.3% during the first two quarters.All Gundam TV series ratings, Gunota A decision was made to cut the series short from the planned full year run to the final 39-episodes. In the key Kanto region, the show was moved in its TV Asahi broadcast from a Friday afternoon 5:00 PM timeslot to a Saturday morning 6:00 AM timeslot starting with episode 27. The show lasted 39 episodes of its intended 49. Reception to After War Gundam X in the West has been mixed, with Lauren Orsini of Anime News Network stating, \\"Getting cancelled just might be the best thing that could have happened to After War Gundam X, because the difference in entertainment quality between its first and second halves is like night and day. When the show begins so sluggishly, there's simply no option but to pick up the pace for it to wrap up by the end of the year as ordered.\\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/after-war- gundam-x/sub.dvd-collection-2/.103245 However, she did praise the later half of the show for \\"adapting into a master juggler, balancing the conflict's complexities in both the Earth and space theaters from the perspective of an increasingly likable main cast, with a concise final arc resolving neatly into a satisfying conclusion. Had it not been canceled, Gundam X might have risked overstaying its welcome. Instead, it showed itself out at the perfect time.\\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/after-war-gundam-x/sub.dvd- collection-2/.103245 John Oppliger of AnimeNation gave a more negative review saying, \\"The biggest flaw of Gundam X was in simply creating a series with absolutely no likeable characters. Every character in the series was simply so self-absorbed and ill-tempered that watching the series was simply an exercise in aggravation tolerance that most fans quickly decided to forgo.\\" http://www.animenation.net/ask-john-whats-the-worst-anime-ever-made/ Carlos Ross of THEM Anime gave a mixed review calling the series \\"bland\\" and that \\"The plot seems like a drab retelling of a post-apocalyptic Gundam Wing as told by the recently lobotomized. As the only emotions really expressed are rage, desperation, and, oh yeah, angst, Gundam X strikes me as being just as anti-Gundam as Gundam Wing was, but in a different way. Gundam X focuses on nothing but despair...and as such, fails utterly to keep this reviewer's interest. Whereas Gundam, though at times saddening, was exciting, suspenseful, and full of life, Gundam X is completely bleak and inhuman, and loses the point that Gundam is actually less about the mecha than about humanity itself. Then again, when neither the mecha or the humans inspire anything ... why should we care?\\" He concluded that After War Gundam X was \\"not an absolutely terrible anime, but it's downright mediocre.\\" https://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=116  References   External links  Category:1996 anime television series X Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga Category:Kodansha manga Category:K≈çichi Tokita Category:Post-apocalyptic anime and manga Category:Sh≈çnen manga Category:Sunrise (company) Category:TV Asahi original programming ","title":"After War Gundam X"},{"id":"47786309","text":"Bundesstra√üe 178 (B178) is a German federal highway in the east of the Saxony.

It is a Grade I listed building and stands at Church Lane, on the south side of the village. There is no reference to a church or priest in the entry for the parish in the Domesday Book, which was compiled in 1086. This may indicate the absence of a church building at that stage or, alternatively, only the absence of a resident priest. Most of the current church building was erected in the 13th and 14th centuries and is constructed of square coursed lias with ashlar dressings and a slate roof. There is a chancel, a clerestoried nave of four bays with a south aisle, north porch and west tower. The chancel arch is of 15th-century construction, when it appears that significant further work was carried out such as the addition of the clerestory and porch as well as widening of the aisle. A monument whose Latin inscription commemorates Alexander Ibbs, a rector of the parish who died in 1606, is set in the north wall of the chancel. The church was extensively restored in 1874-5. Alterations at that time included the creation of a vestry and an organ chamber, both leading from the chancel, provision of a barrel roof to the chancel, a new roof to the aisle, removal of a west gallery and alterations to some of the windows. The parish registers survive from 1559, the historic registers being deposited at Northamptonshire Record Office. Old is part of a united benefice which also includes the parishes of Hannington, Scaldwell and Walgrave with each village retaining its own church.

Minter (born January 23, 1961) is an American politician from the state of Vermont. She served in the Vermont House of Representatives from 2005 to 2011, led Vermont's recovery efforts after Tropical Storm Irene, and became secretary of the Vermont Agency of Transportation in 2015. Minter was the Democratic Party nominee in the Vermont gubernatorial election of 2016. She lost to the Republican Party nominee Phil Scott. Early life and career Minter was born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Evelyn and Robert Wilson \\"Bob\\" Minter, who managed a candy business, Minter's Candies. Her family moved to Providence, Rhode Island, while she was in high school. Minter graduated from Moses Brown School in 1979 and from Harvard University with a concentration in sociology in 1983. She then earned a master's degree in urban planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She moved to Vermont in 1991 to become a consultant for Conservation Law Foundation. Political career =State representative= Minter ran for the Vermont House of Representatives in 2004, representing the Washington-Chittenden-1 district (Duxbury, Waterbury, and Huntington). She won, and was reelected for four terms. She served on the Transportation and Appropriations committees, in positions which emphasized budgeting over policy-making, and earned a reputation as a \\"solid\\" but not \\"ultra-liberal\\" Democrat with a good understanding of complex budget issues. =Vermont Agency of Transportation= Peter Shumlin, the Governor of Vermont, appointed Minter as Deputy Secretary of the Vermont Agency of Transportation in January 2011. Following Tropical Storm Irene, Shumlin appointed Neale Lunderville to lead Vermont's recovery efforts, and four months later named Minter to replace him. Minter was praised for her leadership as chief recovery officer. She later served on President Barack Obama's Task Force on Climate Preparedness and Resilience, co-chaired the White House Task Force Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery and Resilience, and led a Vermont team which assisted with Colorado's response to major flooding in 2013. Minter became Secretary of VTrans on January 1, 2015, following the retirement of Brian Searles. In response to an August workplace discrimination lawsuit against VTrans, she boosted employee training in harassment prevention and established an affirmative-action task force. =Candidate for governor= In September 2015, Minter resigned from her position at VTrans to run for governor in the 2016 gubernatorial election. Minter's former House colleagues described her as left-of-center and praised her as a \\"good Democrat\\" with a talent for understanding complicated budget issues, but questioned her preparedness for a gubernatorial run. Minter was endorsed by former Vermont Governors Madeleine Kunin, Howard Dean and Phil Hoff; former Lieutenant Governor Doug Racine; and former State Representative Jason Lorber; along with 52 current legislators and 25 more former legislators, as well as the pro-choice Democratic group EMILY's List. Environmentalist Bill McKibben initially supported her rival Matt Dunne, but switched his support to Minter after Dunne revised his position on wind power. Minter proposed job creation efforts involving strategic investments in infrastructure and housing, as well as industry-government collaboration to promote the technology, energy, and agricultural sectors. Her proposed \\"Vermont Promise\\" initiative would have paid for Vermont high school graduates to attend the Community College of Vermont or Vermont Technical College for two years for free, and for half of the current price afterwards. Minter believes Vermont's pension fund should divest from coal holdings because they are \\"bad for our economy and bad for our environment.\\" Minter followed her rival Matt Dunne in rejecting campaign contributions from corporations, writing \\"Whether you are a multimillionaire or a major corporation, you shouldn't be able to buy the governor's office.\\" After the 2015 Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood shooting, she called for universal background checks on gun sales in Vermont, a position later taken up by her rivals. She also supports a ban on assault weapons. On August 9, Minter won the Democratic Party nomination for governor, defeating Dunne and Peter Galbraith in the primary election. She faced Republican Phil Scott, the Lieutenant Governor of Vermont, in the November general election. Minter lost to Scott, 52% to 44%. Post-political career In September 2017, Minter became the president and chief executive officer of Special Olympics Vermont. She resigned from the job in September 2018. In December 2018, Minter became executive director of Capstone Community Action, a community action agency in Vermont that works to meet basic needs, advocate for economic justice and lift low-income people out of poverty. Personal life Minter lives in Waterbury, Vermont, with her husband David Goodman (brother of Amy Goodman, a journalist for Democracy Now!). They have two children.

The first manga version was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from October 1972 to August 1973, and it later continued in Kodansha TV Magazine from October 1973 to September 1974. It was adapted into an anime television series which aired on Fuji TV from December 1972 to September 1974. A second manga series was released alongside the TV show, this one drawn by Gosaku Ota, which started and ended almost at the same time as the TV show. Mazinger Z has spawned several sequels and spinoff series, among them being Great Mazinger, UFO Robot Grendizer and Mazinkaiser. Mazinger Z: Infinity, a theatrical film sequel, taking place 10 years after the Great Mazinger series, was animated by Toei Animation and released in theaters on January 13, 2018.„ÄåÂäáÂ†¥Áâà„Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„ÉºZ„Äç 2017Âπ¥10Êúà„Å´„Ç§„Çø„É™„Ç¢ÂÖ¨Èñã„ÄÅÊó•Êú¨„Çà„Çä3„ÉµÊúàÂÖàË°å - „Ç¢„Éã„É°„Éº„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Éì„Ç∏„Éç„Çπ„Éª„Ç∏„É£„Éº„Éä„É´  Plot  Mazinger Z is an enormous super robot, constructed with a fictitious metal called , which is forged from a new element (Japanium) mined from a reservoir found only in the sediment of Mt. Fuji, in Japan. The mecha was built by Professor Juzo Kabuto as a secret weapon against the forces of evil, represented in the series by the Mechanical Beasts of Dr. Hell. The latter was the German member of a Japanese archeological team, which discovered ruins of a lost pre-Grecian civilization on an island named Bardos, the Myc√©ne Empire. One of their findings was that the Mycene used an army of steel titans about 20 meters in height. Finding prototypes of those titans underground which could be remote- controlled and realizing their immense power on the battlefield, Dr. Hell goes insane and has all the other scientists of his research team killed except for Professor Kabuto, who manages to escape. The lone survivor goes back to Japan and attempts to warn the world of its imminent danger. Meanwhile, Dr. Hell establishes his headquarters on a mobile island, forms the new Underground Empire, and plans to use the Mechanical Monsters to become the new ruler of the world. To counter this, Kabuto constructs Mazinger Z and manages to finish it just before being killed by a bomb planted by Hell's right-hand person, Baron Ashura, a half-man, half-woman. As he lays dying, he manages to inform his grandson Kouji Kabuto about the robot and its use. Kouji becomes the robot's pilot, and from that point on battles both the continuous mechanical monsters, and the sinister henchmen sent by Doctor Hell.  Development  In his Manga Works series, Go Nagai reveals that he had always loved Tetsuwan Atom and Tetsujin-28 as a child, and wanted to make his own robot anime. However, for the longest time he was unable to produce a concept that he felt did not borrow too heavily from those two shows. One day, Nagai observed a traffic jam and mused to himself that the drivers in back would surely love a way to bypass the ones in front. From that thought came his ultimate inspiration: a giant robot that could be controlled from the inside, like a car. In his original concepts, the titular robot was Energer Z, which was controlled by a motorcycle that was driven up its back and into its head (an idea which was recycled for the Diana A robot). However, with the sudden popularity of Kamen Rider, Nagai replaced the motorcycle with a hovercraft. He later redesigned Energer Z, renaming it Mazinger Z to evoke the image of a demon god (Ma, È≠î, meaning demon and Jin, Á•û, meaning god). The motif of the Hover Pilder docking itself into Mazinger's head also borrows from Nagai's 1971 manga Demon Lord Dante (the prototype for his more popular Devilman), in which the titular giant demon has a human head (of Ryo Utsugi, the young man who merged with him) in his forehead. Koji Kabuto takes his surname (the Japanese word for a helmet) because he controls Mazinger Z from its head.  Adaptations  = Anime =  Tranzor Z In the United States, Three B. Productions Ltd., a production company headed by Bunker Jenkins, developed Mazinger Z for American television by producing an English-dubbed version, which Jenkins retitled Tranzor Z. This adaptation aired in 1985, and was, like many English-dubbed anime shows that were on American TV at the time, re- edited for American audiences. Many of the Japanese names used in Mazinger Z were changed for its adaptation into Tranzor Z; for example, Koji Kabuto became Tommy Davis, Sayaka Yumi became Jessica Wells, Shiro became Toad, Professor Yumi became Dr. Wells, Dr. Hell became Dr. Daemon, and Baron Ashura became Devleen. Only 65 out of the 92 episodes were dubbed into English, as 65 was the minimum number of episodes required for syndication. An earlier English dub that was more faithful to the original was produced and aired in Hawaii for around 30 episodes in the late 1970s.  Sequels  The Mazinger Z anime ran to a total of 92 TV episodes from 1972 to 1974. Its period of greatest popularity lasted from roughly October 1973 to March 1974, during which time it regularly scored audience ratings in the high twenties; episode 68, broadcast March 17, 1974, achieved the series' highest rating of 30.4%, making Mazinger Z one of the highest-rated anime series of all time (1). It culminated in the destruction of the original robot by new enemies (after Doctor Hell's final defeat in the penultimate episode) and the immediate introduction of its successor, Great Mazinger, an improved version of Mazinger, along with its pilot, Tetsuya Tsurugi. The idea of replacing the first robot with Great Mazinger (sometimes called Shin Mazinger Z) is a variation of a death-rebirth myth found in most Japanese action series: the title character, even if it is only a robot, is never truly defeated or destroyed, only improved upon, and replaced by the next version. Koji and Mazinger Z come back in the last episodes of Great Mazinger to help their successors defeat the forces of evil. Another sequel, albeit in a different line, was introduced in 1975, with the appearance of Grendizer, set in the Mazinger and Great Mazinger story continuity that included Koji Kabuto as a supporting character. The shows spawned so-called \\"team-up movies\\" early on, which were like longer episodes that teamed up Mazinger Z with one of Go Nagai's other creations, as in Mazinger Z vs. Devilman („Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„ÉºZÂØæ„Éá„Éì„É´„Éû„É≥) in 1973 as well as Mazinger Z Vs. Dr. Hell („Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„ÉºÔº∫ÂØæ„Éâ„ÇØ„Çø„Éº„Éò„É´) and Mazinger Z Vs. The Great General of Darkness („Éû„Ç∏„É≥„Ç¨„ÉºZÂØæÊöóÈªíÂ§ßÂ∞ÜËªç) both released in 1974. On the franchise's 45th anniversary, a sequel film titled Mazinger Z: Infinity was announced, taking place 10 years after the events of the original series. It was animated by Toei Animation and directed by Junji Shimizu and written by Takahiro Ozawa. It is released theatrically in Japan on January 13, 2018. Viz Media licensed the film for its theatrical release outside Japan. Conceptual art of Dai-Mazinger. In the 1980s, on behalf of Dynamic Planning, Masami ≈åbari and other independent animators (Toshiki Hirano) not part of Toei Animation began work on a miniseries of Mazinger Z. The OVA (Original Video Animation) would have been called Dai-Mazinger (or Daimajinga, Â§ßÈ≠îÁ•ûÊàë) and would have presented the same characters known to the general public, starting with the main protagonist Koji. The robot would be more realistic: for example, it would have exhaust pipes and its rocket fists would not be able to automatically return to its arms. The news, initially protected by a tight secrecy, managed to leak and were spread by the specialized press. Toei protested, saying to Dynamic that the rights of the animation of Mazinger was only theirs and that they did not tolerate a Mazinger animated by others. As a consequence, the project Daimajinga was blocked. This wasn't helped with the fact that Nagai was in the middle of a court battle with Toei, suing them for not properly crediting him and not paying him royalties over the creation of Gaiking in 1976. However, since then the relationship between Nagai and Toei had steadily improved. Thirty years after the start of the original program, Nagai's company Dynamic Planning released a continuation of the original Mazinger series as an OVA--named Mazinkaiser (mazinkaizƒÅ)--in 2002. This work would be succeeded by the movie Mazinkaiser: Deathmatch! Ankoku Daishogun, which in some ways served as a partial remake of Mazinger Z vs. the General of Darkness. Since 2007, several rumors surfaced regarding a new series which would be based on the Z Mazinger manga. In February 2009, it was officially announced a new Mazinger anime called which later began airing on April 4, 2009. On the 2010 June issue of the magazine Hobby Japan, released on April 2010, a new OVA series was revealed, called . The OVA also has a novelization, serialized in the ASCII Media Works magazine Dengeki Hobby, and a net manga, published by Emotion (Bandai Visual) in the mobile phones magazine Shu 2 Comic Gekkin. Crossovers =Transformers= In February 2019, it was announced that Transformers and Mazinger Z would crossover. A manga featuring the two franchises was released on March 28 of the same year.https://tformers.com/mazinger-z-vs-transformers-new-cover-reveals-from- shinobu-kaze-yuki-ohshima/34802/news.html  Merchandise  Mazinger remains one of Go Nagai's most enduring success stories, spawning many products in the realm of merchandising, model kits, plastic and die-cast metal toys (the now famous Soul of Chogokin line), action figures and other collectibles. Mazinger has also been successful in the video game area (at least in Japan), as one of the main stars in the acclaimed battle simulation game series Super Robot Wars, released by Banpresto, featuring characters and units from almost all Mazinger-related shows, alongside other anime franchises. In 1994, Banpresto released an arcade game called Mazinger Z which was a vertical shoot 'em up with three selectable characters : Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger and Grendizer. A 40-foot tall statue of Mazinger Z was built in a suburb called \\"Mas del Plata\\" in Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) in the early 1980s, to serve as the suburb's entrance, yet the suburb was never completed and the statue remains there.  DVD  Discotek Media acquired the American home video rights to the show. The result was a release of all 92 episodes of the original series in 2 volumes: Mazinger Z TV Series Vol 1, Ep. 1‚Äì46 and Mazinger Z TV Series Vol 2, Ep. 47‚Äì92. Discotek Media later released on double feature DVD on April 29, 2014, alongside Amazing Nuts!, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, and Unico.  Reception and influence  Mazinger Z helped to create the 1970s boom in mecha anime. The series is noteworthy for introducing many of the accepted stock features of super robot anime genres, including the first occurrence of mecha robots being piloted by a user from within a cockpit. In 2001, the Japanese magazine Animage elected Mazinger Z TV series the eleventh best anime production of all time. Guillermo Del Toro has cited the show ‚Äì which was a huge success in his native Mexico during the 1980s ‚Äì as an important influence on Pacific Rim.

Version or Mazinger U.S. Version to avoid confusions with the rest of the Mazinger works, is a 57 pages comic series created by Go Nagai specifically for the US market. Sometimes it is also called incorrectly Mazinwarrior or MazinSaga, since its Mazinger's design is similar to the Mazinger of MazinSaga. It features full-color graphics, text in English and left-to-right formatting. It is the second manga created by Go Nagai for the US market after Oni (published in 1983). It is partially inspired by Gulliver's Travels. Plot The story is set in the year 220X A.D., after hundreds of years in war that devastated planet Earth. The environment of the planet is so damaged that the fights have to be done wearing special combat armors. A new battle is rising, and the soldier Major Kabuto boards his combat robot, Mazinger. In the middle of the battle, Mazinger gets caught in an explosion which creates a wormhole that transports Mazinger into a parallel dimension. In this Earth, immediately after appearing, Mazinger saves a beautiful young woman, princess Krishna, from humanoid reptiles that are about to kill her. It turns out that princess Krishna's kingdom of Lithgor is the last human land standing against the newly risen Zard Empire of the reptilian race, a race that cared only for war. The High King of Lithgor desired peace with the Zard empire, and overruled his council to seek a truce, but the Zard empire committed treachery and killed the High King and the rest of the nobles with the exception of princess Krishna. After witnessing what Mazinger can do, Krishna requests his help to defend Lithgor. Mazinger does not want to intrude, but accepts to help on the condition of winning the love of Krishna, who is the woman of his dreams. Krishna had also dreamed of a man like Mazinger, but accepts mainly for the sake of her people. Mazinger warns her of the consequences of her promise, since he is a man from another world, stating that beneath the Mazinger armor, he is not like the men of Krishna's world. Even so, she accepts and Major Kabuto gets out of Mazinger, surprising the princess. Kabuto regrets that he finally finds the woman and the land of his dreams but it turns out to be of the wrong size. The princess comments that she had heard legends about the little people, about a man named Swift. The final battle approaches and Mazinger requests to face all the Zard warriors alone. He uses his powerful armament, obliterating the Zard Empire but gets caught in another massive explosion and returns to his Earth. There, he encounters a partner who tells him that he was lost for a month, even though a day had only passed for him in the other Earth. When asked where he was, Kabuto answers that he was in an adventure and recalls his experience in Krishna's kingdom. He's interrupted by a new attack and gets ready to once again face his enemies. He says that he will keep fighting until he sees his beloved Krishna again. External links * Mazinger at The World of Go Nagai webpage.

Note, however, that the movie features alternate versions of events from both series, and is therefore not canonical to either one. Story The movie opens with a battle between the Super Robots Mazinger Z and Aphrodite A against three of Doctor Hell‚Äôs Mechanical Beasts. The heroes win, but the battle apparently frees the female demon Sir√®ne from below the ground. She flies away before they can do anything about it. However she is seen by Akira Fudo, who transforms into his real form of Devilman to fly after her. Dr. Hell, who observed the battle, correctly realizes that Sir√®ne is part of a ‚Äúdemon tribe‚Äù that according to a legend ruled the Earth in prehistoric times. Using a flying fortress (not Ghoul, the one seen in the regular Mazinger series, but rather the Navalon, one exclusive to this movie) Hell and his henchman Baron Ashura follow Sir√®ne to the Himalaya Mountains, were the rest of the tribe is frozen. Hell helps to free some of the demons (notably absent is their leader, Zenon) and makes a deal with them to help them defeat their enemy, Devilman, if they will help him defeat Mazinger. They are unaware that Devilman has spied on their conversation. Later, Akira goes to warn Koji about this but ends up mocking the Mazinger for being unable to fly; this leads to the two hot-tempered teenagers racing each other on motorcycles (it ends in a draw.) It turns out that Mazinger's headquarters, the Photon Research Laboratory, is already working on solving the robot's disadvantage against flying enemies by making the Jet Scrander, a giant winged jetpack. However one of the demons has spied on them and reports this development to Dr. Hell. He sends the shapeless demon and Sir√®ne to destroy the Scrander. They manage to damage it before being driven off by Koji's raygun; Sir√®ne escapes by taking Koji's brother Shiro and his friend Sayaka hostage. She then lets them fall from the sky, but they are saved by Devilman. When Koji goes to pick them up, he watches Akira change into Devilman and so learns his secret. Devilman follows the amorphous demon to the sea, but falls into a trap; he's rescued by Koji in the Mazinger. Afterwards they talk, and Akira reveals to him that he's a rogue member of the Demon Tribe who fights to protect humanity. The combined forces of Dr. Hell and the demons then attack the Laboratory; Devilman flies to help defend it, but is overwhelmed and captured. He's taken to some (obviously magical) clouds, where he's placed on an ice cross and tortured by the demons for being a traitor. However, as soon as the Scrander is repaired, Koji uses it to fly the Mazinger into the clouds, killing the demons, freeing Devilman and finally destroying the flying fortress, although Hell and Ashura escape alive.

First appearing in Weekly Sh≈çnen Champion's 41st issue of 1973, the series ran until April 1974. It follows an android girl named Honey Kisaragi, who transforms into the busty, red or pink-haired heroine Cutie Honey to fight against the assorted villains that threaten her or her world. One of the trademarks of the character is that the transformation involves the temporary loss of all her clothing in the brief interim from changing from one form to the other. According to Nagai, she is the first female to be the protagonist of a sh≈çnen manga series. The Cutie Honey franchise spans many works, including numerous manga series, three anime television series, two OVA series, two drama CDs, and three live action adaptations. The first anime aired in 1973 and is considered a magical girl series in retrospect. Plot Honey Kisaragi is a regular, 16 year old Catholic schoolgirl, until the day her father is murdered by the \\"Panther Claw\\" organization. After his death, she learns she is actually an android created by him and within her is . With her cry of \\"Honey Flash!\\" she can use the device to transform into the sword-wielding red-haired superhero, Cutie Honey. This device, or similar devices, have been used to explain her powers in all later Honey versions. While attending the Saint Chapel School for Girls, Honey seeks revenge against the Panther Claw organization, which is ruled by an ancient primordial evil known as Panther Zora and her younger sibling Sister Jill. Zora wants \\"the rarest items in the world\\" and seeks to steal the device within Honey created by her father, which would allow them to \\"create an endless supply of jewels\\". Meanwhile Jill, leader of the group's division in Japan, \\"only wants the finest riches\\" and has a crush on Honey. Honey is aided in her quest by Danbei Hayami and his two sons, journalist Seiji and young Junpei. Danbei is based on the character Daemon from Nagai's prior work Abashiri Family. Nagai's manga also borrows the character Naojiro from that series (in a female form named Sukeban Naoko), while the anime borrows the Paradise School along with the characters Naojiro and Goeman (a teacher at the school) from the series. Naojiro is here the boss of the school's delinquent boys before being joined in the job by Honey. Honey is mischievous for a Japanese female hero, often teasing her male friends and mocking her enemies in combat. When transforming into Cutie Honey, she gives a brief rundown of the forms she has previously taken in that particular episode, and then declares, \\"But my true identity is ...\\" before yelling \\"Honey Flash!\\" and transforming. At school, Honey is something of a \\"class clown\\" who enjoys teasing and pranking her teachers Alphonne and Miharu. Much of the comic relief in the series comes from Honey's exploits at school. Miharu initially sees Honey as an incorrigible pest, but Alphonne is attracted to Honey and goes out of her way to be nice to her. Honey's best friend at school is the cute, freckle-faced Natsuko \\"Nat-chan\\" Aki. In the manga, Nat- chan, as well as the other students, had a crush on Honey; this crush was downplayed in the TV series. Honey has a large array of transformations in the series, her most common personae including: *Hurricane Honey (biker). A woman who is \\"cool\\" with her motorcycle, anytime she needs to escape. *Misty Honey (singer). A rockstar with a dusty voice, who uses her microphone as a weapon. *Idol Honey (stewardess). A woman disguised as a flight attendant. *Flash Honey (cameraman). A reporter who blinds her opponents with her camera's \\"flash\\". *Fancy Honey (model). A classy model who uses a long-stick cigar as a weapon. *Cutie Honey (heroine). A sword-wielding pink-haired warrior of love. Production In 1992, Nagai wrote that the idea to create the \\"Seven Transformations\\" hero was pitched by a Toei producer. His inspiration for this character came from classic shows that featured protagonists who took seven different forms, including the Bannai Tarao mysteries. and Warrior of Love Rainbowman (1972).Rainbowman and Seven Color Mask (1959), both created by K≈çhan Kawauchi, were two tokusatsu (live-action) shows involving transforming superheroes (another Kawauchi creation, \\"Gekko Kamen\\", is parodied in Nagai's Kekko Kamen). His decision to make the protagonist a \\"female android\\" came from female characters from his previous works, Harenchi Gakuen and Abashiri Family, and from the character Maria from Metropolis. Originally, Cutie Honey was meant to be a sh≈çjo series like the later Cutie Honey Flash, focusing more on Honey and Shun Kazama (Seiji)'s relationship and lacking any nudity or excessive violence. A great deal of merchandising was initially planned, such as 'changing' dolls of Honey. The manga was slated to run in the monthly Ribbon magazine, and the series was set to air at 7:00 on NET TV, a timeslot previously held by mah≈ç sh≈çjo (magical girl) series. However, the timeslot was given to Miracle Sh≈çjo Limit-Chan (which garnered poor ratings) and Cutie Honey was going to air on the hour show, Maj≈´ Kaijin Daihenshin!!! which previously aired Micord S and Devilman. Because of this, Cutie Honey was now going to be a sh≈çnen (young boys') series, making it the first magical girl series for boys. To make it appeal to a young male audience, more action was added and Nagai proposed to draw Honey nude during her transformations. Media =Manga= The original works of the franchise were various manga series, one made by Go Nagai, two others made by Ken Ishikawa, another two by Yuu Okazaki, one by Chizuko Beppu, one by Yoshiko Suganuma, another by Masatoshi Nakajima, and an animated TV series. Nagai's 1973 manga was republished in 1985 as a single volume, but no further versions of Honey were produced until 1992. A 1992 manga series was also created by Nagai; set 30 years after the originals, it was released in the United States in 1997 by the now-defunct Studio Ironcat, as Cutie Honey '90. It has received criticism for having \\"bad quality\\" and \\"clumsy\\"-looking characters. Several other manga versions have also been produced. The first, , ran from 2001 to 2003. Set in 2005, Seiko Hayami struggles with apparitions of monstrous beings, including the Panther Claw terrorist organization, which she must defeat with the help of Hisashi Hanyu, which is in fact Cutie Honey. The second, , ran from 2003 to 2005; it was not fully released until October 2007. An omnibus volume is planned for release in September 2017 by Seven Seas Entertainment In this version of the tale Aki Natsuko is a squad leader for the public safety bureau. Natsuko takes it upon herself to arrest Honey but Prof. Kisaragi asks Natsuko to befriend Honey and help her become more human. When Natsuko arrives home that night, she finds that Honey has come to live with her. The third, , ran from 2004 to 2006; it was \\"written by Go Nagai, but not drawn by him\\", and tells the story of a boy named Yuuta, a Cutie Honey fan, who meets an alien with powers similar to those of Honey. There is even a one-shot that was serialized in Shueisha's Grand Jump magazine in 2012 that is simply titled \\"Honey VS.\\" =Anime= 1973 TV series Toei Animation produced an anime television series, also titled Cutie Honey, simultaneously as the manga was being drawn. It was broadcast on NET (now TV Asahi) on October 13, 1973 and ran until March 30, 1974. The TV series is much tamer than the manga version, removing much of the violence, gross out humor and lesbian undertones, but retaining Miss Alphonne's attraction to Honey. While the manga was marketed as \\"\\" (\\"science fiction comics\\"), the Toei anime is considered, at least in retrospect, a magical girl series. Outside Japan, the only country in which the original Cutie Honey TV series was released was France, where it aired under the title Cherry Miel (\\"Cherry Honey\\") from August 1988 to February 1989, On November 26, 2013, Discotek Media released a DVD boxset of the complete series in North America. For an anime television series, the original Cutie Honey achieved respectable ratings in Japan, and some of its cast and crew have worked on other major titles. The series achieved a peak rating of 11.6% for episode 18 (broadcast February 11, 1974) and generally scored ratings of around 8‚Äì10%. New Cutie Honey In 1994, the original video animation series New Cutie Honey was released. The series, which ended with eight episodes in 1995, pays homage to some of Nagai's other works, including the Mazinger and Devilman series. It is set after the events of the original version, in a cyberpunk-like future. While the first four episodes contain a complete story, the last four episodes take a monster of the week approach. Some of Cutie Honey's forms in the TV series, as shown in Tokuma Shoten's Cutie Honey Roman Album Archive book. Clockwise from top right: Kisaragi, Misty, Idol, Hurricane, Cutie. When the series was released on DVD in 2004, a scripted but unfilmed episode 9, a Christmas story, was released as a drama CD. The eight filmed episodes were released by ADV Films in the United States. Jessica Calvello, the voice of Honey in the English language version, was hand-picked by Nagai. Until Discotek picked up the first anime, this series remained the only Cutie Honey anime to be commercially released in the US. Cutie Honey Flash Toei Animation also produced a sh≈çjo Cutie Honey series, known as Cutie Honey Flash. It began broadcasting on TV Asahi on February 15, 1997, and aired until its conclusion on January 31, 1998. Employing many of the same animation staff as the recently-finished Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, including Miho Shimagasa, Flash features very similar character designs and fits the more traditional mold of magical girl series. It uses hand-drawn animation; according to Shimagasa, the use of digitally animated characters on hand-painted backgrounds was planned and tested, but later rejected. The series was also broadcast in Germany. The series is unrelated to the previous anime productions, being more of a reimagining of the story. All the characters from the original TV series return, with the exception of Junpei, Naojiro, and the staff of Paradise School. The anime also introduces Misty Honey, a rival and self-proclaimed younger sister of Cutie Honey, whose name was chosen through a contest in Japan. Honey has a larger array of transformations as well, including versions of her original forms Hurricane Honey and Cutie Honey. Re: Cutie Honey Gainax also produced Re: Cutie Honey, a three-episode OVA series. It was first shown on Animax, with the first episode airing on July 24, 2004, two months after the live- action film was released.

He married Phoebe-Ann Hill (daughter of Air Chief Marshal Sir Roderic Hill, who was Rector of Imperial College London), subsequent having five children. He was an excellent pianist and music theorist. Research Following his undergraduate studies, Peter Caldwell worked with Professor Cyril Hinshelwood, completing his PhD on the influences on the growth rate of bacteria, which led to important ideas about the ways in which cells synthesized proteins. The key new idea was that a coded sequence of nucleic acids specified the sequence of amino acids in a protein. In 1950 he moved to University College London to work with the Nobel prize winning Archibald Hill, where he developed new methods for measuring pH. In 1955 he joined the Marine Biological Association's Laboratory in Plymouth, working with squid nerves and crab muscles to study the energy sources for the complex processes involved in the neuronal communication and muscle contraction. IN 1960 he moved to the University of Bristol Department of Zoology as a lecturer, then reader (1966), then \\"personal chair\\" (Professor; 1978). While there, his work included the introduction of EGTA as a tool to study the regulation of Ca2+ inside cells, using it to make the first accurate measurements of the very low free Ca2+ concentration in muscle.

Description The horned bannerfish is a small-sized fish that can reach a maximum length of 19 cm. Its body is compressed laterally, with the first rays of its dorsal fin stretched in short feather-like filaments. The background color is chocolate to black with two white bands. The two white bands are slightly oblique, their run is convergent but they are not intersecting. The first one starts the anterior ventral area, passes between the eyes and the pectoral fin's shoulder and ends with the first rays of the dorsal fin. The head is black to chocolate and this dark area includes the mouth, the eyes, the little horn between the eyes and the frontal growth. The space between the horn and the growth gives the impression that the profile of its forehead is concave. The second white band begins from the base of caudal peduncle and move towards the center of the dorsal fin. The area between the two white bands is black on the ventral part and shades gradually to chocolate color when reaching the dorsal fin. A latter light chocolate band extends diagonally just beyond the second white band. The pectoral and the caudal fins are translucent. The horned bannerfish can be confused with the very similar phantom bannerfish, Heniochus pleurotaenia. The main difference is that the horned bannerfish does not have the reversed \\"v\\" pattern on its sides. Juveniles, which lack the white insert for the phantom bannerfish, can be distinguished by the shorter extension of the first rays of the dorsal fin. Distribution and habitat The horned bannerfish is widespread throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the central Indo-Pacific from Indonesia to Polynesia and from south Japan to New-Caledonia.Lieske & Myers,Coral reef fishes,Princeton University Press, 2009, It inhabits areas rich in coral in shallow lagoons and external reef slopes from the surface to a depth of 30 meters.Allen, G.R. and M.V. Erdmann, 2012. Reef fishes of the East Indies. Perth, Australia: University of Hawai'i Press, Volumes I-III. Tropical Reef Research. Biology The horned bannerfish is a solitary fish but it can live in pairs or even in small groups.Rudie Kuiter, ‚ÄúChaetodontidae & Microcanthidae‚Äù, Aquatic Photographics, 2004, Its diet is varied and consists of coral polyps and various benthic invertebrates. Conservation status In some geographic areas, the horned bannerfish is occasionally harvested for the aquarium trade, however the species does not currently appear threatened is listed as Least Concern (LC) by the IUCN.

People tend to respond to positive statements but react to negative statements that concern them. Children are more sensitive to their self-worth and thrive on what makes them feel good, what makes them feel accepted, included and recognized. AI is a powerful tool that can be used in the field of Education to enable children discover what is good about them and dream of what they can do with this realization. Children of today are very sensitive and make decisions in haste which sometimes costs them their lives. In such a situation, AI plays a very vital role. Overview Appreciative Inquiry is the cooperative search for the best in people their organizations, and the world around them. It involves systematic discovery of what gives a system ‚Äòlife‚Äô when it is most effective and capable in economic, ecological, and human terms. AI involves the art and practice of asking questions that strengthen a system's capacity to heighten positive potential. It mobilizes inquiry through crafting an ‚Äúunconditional positive question‚Äô often involving hundreds or sometimes thousands of people.‚Äù Application Applied in the education sector, AI is a cooperative search for the best in children, their school, their teachers, their classmates, their parents and this discovery influences and helps shape their image of the future. It all begins with a story which the appreciative inquirer tells about him/herself and this story is only about where the child has experienced the best of what he could e.g. in reading, writing, passing tests and exams. With this flow of energy from past experience, the child is poised for a similar experience in the future and so nurtures all that give energy and brings joy of performance, acceptance and readiness to move ahead. AI starts with a statement of purpose or object of inquiry and which then takes the inquirer through the five steps (known as the 5Ds of AI) and graphically illustrated as follows: Refer the picture in Appreciative Inquiry in the education sector can amplify the motivation of the students and help them become most alive and effective. AI brings about social change in the pupil as the emphasis is on what is good and the belief that people nurture what they appreciate, than what they are not happy about. The system of education can be based on the five principles of AI that will enable the child discover through her/his own story, what is good about him/her and dream of how he/she can capitalize on this story of goodness to do more of such things that he/she appreciates about himself, about his environment, about his world. Principles A quick look at the principles will enable the understanding of why AI is suitable for our education system: i. Constructionist Principle ‚Äì argues that the language and metaphors we use don't just describe reality (the world), they actually create ‚Äòour ‚Äòreality (the world). It means that great care is taken in the choice of words that we use as it will influence the kind of future we create. The language of the teacher influences what the child considers as his/her reality and this influences his self-perception and hence his self-worth which is very important for what he/she becomes in future. ii. Principle of Simultaneity ‚Äì change begins from the moment we ask a question about a thing. The heart of AI is an unconditional positive question. For example, ‚Äì what was the best thing that has happened to you in the last week? iii. The Poetic Principle - as the topic of inquiry is on what is good about the individual or the environment, this helps open a new chapter in the life of the child. Stories reveal qualities which had not been previously realized and appreciated. iv. The Anticipatory Principle ‚Äì we grow into the images we create, hence, when the child is made to see himself as good, his imagination about his future will always be good enough and as magnet this imagined future will always pull the child towards this goal. v. The Positive Principle ‚Äì feelings of hope, inspiration, caring, sense of purpose, joy and creating something meaningful or being part of something good are among what we define as positive. It is therefore, important that the questions asked to the child are affirmative and positive. It allows a student to be potentially free from any kind of bondage or control. AI gives an opportunity for the students to showcase their innovative side rather than just rote memory. This in turn makes them autonomous learners. The students are able to understand their strengths every time their potentials are amplified. Use of this in the educational sector would bring about a sea of difference as there would be more room for amplifying the existing positive energy. Even the basic assumptions of AI which includes the assumption that ‚Äòin every human situation, there is something that works‚Äù is a clear indication that no child is incapable of producing a result that would even surprise the child him/herself. All that the child needs are such questions that would enable him/her tap into the core of his/her being. The system of education which relies on an average test or examination grades label children who do not meet the marks as ‚Äòfailed‚Äô. AI in education enables the child to identify the subjects where he/she is very satisfied with the performance, and through story, the child discovers what he/she did differently and how to tap this aspect for more satisfaction. This is why AI is also referred as ‚Äòlocating the energy for change‚Äô. It is a search for what is good through stories and what needs to be done through dreams. AI brings a dream to reality because, motivation for the future depends on the images of success of the past. Educational reform movement One of the strands of educational reform movements in the last two decades has been the call for greater collaborative efforts, both among educators as well as with parents, students and the surrounding community. Educational researcher Hargreaves (1994) referred to collaboration as an ‚Äòarticulating and integrating principle‚Äô (p. 245) for school improvement, providing a way for teachers to learn from each other, gain moral support, coordinate action, and reflect on their classroom practices, their values, and the meaning of their work . These concerns point to the need for a change process that has a positive focus, is essentially self-organizing, encourages deep reflection, and avoids the pitfalls of manipulation by school administrators. This analysis points to a consideration of appreciative inquiry, a strengths-based process that builds on ‚Äòthe best of what is‚Äô in an organization.

He is best known as the developer of the eponymous Curtis steam turbine. Early life Curtis graduated in 1881 from Columbia University with a degree in civil engineering, followed by two years at New York Law School.  Career  After graduating in 1883, Curtis worked first as a patent attorney, then started his own patent law firm. Eight years later, he partnered with friends Charles Crocker and Schuyler S. Wheeler to form 'The Curtis, Crocker, Wheeler Company', with the intention of making and marketing electric appliances, such as motors and fans. =Steam turbine= In 1896, Curtis patented two types of steam turbines. He combined the principles of the Laval turbine and the Parsons turbine into a multi-stage impulse turbine (similar to the independently developed Rateau Turbine). Curtis' turbine reached a lower efficiency than the Parsons' turbine. It was, however, much smaller and simpler in design, thus making it suitable for simple applications and mobile use (e.g.on steamships). Curtis spoke to various companies about his turbines, but met no interest until he met Edwin W. Rice of General Electric. In 1901 he sold the rights to his patent to GE. The Curtis turbine was developed by the International Marine Curtis Turbine Company for use as a marine propulsion, which in turn licensed it to the British shipyard John Brown & Company. The latter built the Brown-Curtis- Turbine used in many ships in the Royal Navy. In 1910, Curtis was awarded the Rumford Premium Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences for his improvements to the steam turbine. =Gas turbine and others= In 1899 Curtis developed the first functioning gas turbine in the United States. To this end, Curtis received the annual award of the gas turbine Division of ASME in 1948 and the Holley Medal of ASME in 1950. In addition to the above-mentioned turbines, Curtis worked on improvements to internal combustion engines (on two-stroke diesel engines) and on the drive of torpedoes.

Their earliest roles were restricted to supportive or administrative jobs, but by the end of the space program there were women astronauts. One issue that NASA faced in recruiting women and minorities for the space program was that throughout NASA's history, the astronauts had always been white men. Another issue was that NASA was not looking for women to work with them outside of specific areas until the government ratified the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. Even then, there has always been tension in the work place between men and women, and many men did not like that they had to accommodate women, such as bathrooms in buildings and spacecrafts. History = 1960s = Dana Ulery, first woman engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Apollo guidance computer lead programmer Margaret Hamilton with software that was written by her and her team Women first worked in support as administrators, secretaries, doctors, psychologists, and later engineers. In the 1960s, NASA started recruiting women and minorities for the space program. By the end of the 1960s, NASA had employed thousands of women. Some of the women like Mary Shep Burton, Gloria B. Martinez (the first spanish woman hired), Cathy Osgood, and Shirley Hunt worked in the computer division while Sue Erwin, Lois Ransdell, and Maureen Bowen worked as secretaries for various members of the Mission and Flight Control teams. Dana Ulery was the first woman engineer to be hired at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) of NASA. Although she was only considered as a junior engineer, for more than seven years, no woman engineer got into JPL besides Ulery. Another woman, Donna Shirley, worked in JPL as a mission engineer in the 1960s. Also, Dr. Carolyn Huntoon, a woman, was a pioneer in researching astronaut metabolisms and other body systems. Margaret Hamilton was the guidance computer lead programmer for the Apollo program. Judy Sullivan was the lead biomedical engineer for the Apollo 11 mission. However, not everyone was accepting of this phenomenon. In 1962, George Low, NASA's Chief of Manned Spaceflight, fought against women by telling the congress that working with women would delay his work. Meanwhile, in the same year, John Kennedy signed the President's Commission on the Status of Women to encourage gender equality in the workforce. This eventually led to James Webb, a NASA administrator, creating an agency-wide policy directive stating that NASA provides equal opportunities for all kinds of people willing to work with NASA. Despite this, no women were selected to join the astronaut corps in 1963/65/66/67. = 1970s = The 1970s was a stepping stone that lead women a step closer to becoming astronauts. At the same time, the military began accepting women for pilot training that eventually led to women astronauts. In 1977, the recruitment of NASA skyrocketed because of Nichelle Nichols's help. Part of the advantage Nichols had in the recruitment was that her role as Lieutenant Uhura on Star Trek inspired young girls to become astronauts at NASA when they grow up. One of these girls was Dr. Mae Jemison, the first black woman astronaut in 1992. Another important character in the 1970s was Dr. Carolyn Huntoon who turned down being an astronaut to serve on the astronaut selection committee. NASA sent Huntoon around the United States to encourage women to apply as astronauts or to get into the STEM field. In 1979, Kathryn Sullivan flew a NASA WB-57F reconnaissance aircraft to 63,300 feet altitude breaking an unofficial altitude record for American women. = 1980s = Sally Ride, America's first woman astronaut On June 18, 1983, Sally Ride made history as the first American woman astronaut to go into space. About more than a year later, Judith Resnik took the Space Shuttle Discovery into space and became the second American woman in space. In 1988, Ellen Ochoa joined NASA and became the first Hispanic woman astronaut. Ochoa took on multiple missions that included Space shuttles Discovery, Atlantis, four flights, and almost 1,000 hours in space. In 1985, Shannon Lucid took on her first flight and by the end of her career she had spent 188 days in space. Lucid set an American record, for both men and women, with the most number of days in space until 2002. = 1990s = By the 1990s, NASA was doing a lot of research in women's bodies and the effects of space to their bodies. Carolyn Huntoon gave a speech in 1994 at the 2nd Annual Women's Health and Space Luncheon by giving light to the unrecognized work of NASA. On February 3, 1995, history was made when Colonel Eileen Collins became the first woman to pilot a spacecraft. Meanwhile, Shannon Lucid, a board engineer, took on five missions in space and worked as chief scientist for NASA in Washington, DC. = 2000s = McAuliffe and Morgan in Teacher in Space Project Starting year 2000, the number of women in NASA's planetary missions started to increase. Women were most given roles as Co-Investigators and Participating Scientists. From below 10% of women selected until the 1990s, this percentage started to increase in the 2000s up to around 30% of women, particularly, the women being given the role as Co-Investigators. Pamela Melroy, for example, took on several missions to the International Space Station on the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis. Not only was Melroy an astronaut but she was also a veteran military pilot who has more than 5,000 hours of flight time. In 2007, Peggy Whitson became the first woman to command the International Space Station. Aside from commanding, Whitson conducted dozens of tests in space that furthered space technologies that are still being used today. In the same year, Barbara Morgan became the first teacher in space; however, it was argued that Christa McAuliffe was announced in 1985 as the first teacher in space, and Barbara Morgan was only an alternate or secondary candidate. In 1986, Christa McAuliffe died in Challenger accident and Morgan was unable to go to space until 2007. = 2010s = Sunita Williams is known for holding many records for women, including 322 total days in space, spent over 50 hours walking in space and being the second women to command the ISS.  Women in Space Program  The unofficial program of Mercury 13 was considered as the start of inclusion of women in U.S space programs, wherein the first seven astronauts chosen for this project were all white men. Randall Lovelace and Donald Flickinger, who are involved in the selection process, considered including women for this project. Lovelace thought that women can also do major tasks in space just like men. Through this, Lovelace and Flickinger met Jerrie Cobb, a woman, in 1960, who played a major role in recruiting and testing women. Some members of the FLATs (Fellow Lady Astronaut Trainees) Women in Space Program (December 20, 1959) was the ‚Äúrevived‚Äù version of the Women in Space Earliest program that was cancelled in November 1959. Similar to the program for men, this required candidate testings. However, the parameters for these tests were varied to accommodate women. In the screening phase, for example, men were required to be degree-holder jet pilots, went to military test pilot school, and with experience of minimum 1,500 hours of flying time. Since women were deprived from some of these opportunities, screenings shifted to women with commercial pilot licenses, especially that women served as instructors during this time. Cobb, who underwent the testing first, became the leader of the FLATs (Fellow Lady Astronaut Trainees) with 12 other women, which made 13 women in total (hence, the media named it Mercury 13). Even though Cobb was assigned as a NASA consultant and continued doing the testings, women were still not trained to be astronauts. During the examinations for women, some scientists thought that women showed advantages for being sent to space rather than men. For example, internal organs of women were assumed to be more suitable in radiation and vibrations. Due to the relatively smaller size of women, spacecrafts and flights would be less expensive if women were to use spacecrafts. However, testings for women were cancelled after it was discovered that NASA did not issue an official request for such action. Lovelace decided to not continue the program and ended up in an uncomfortable situation at NASA. Meanwhile, Jerrie Cobb, who assumed leadership and facilitated the testings for women, was removed from her position at NASA.  Today in NASA  Since the first, Sally Ride, there have been 43 American women who have gone to space by the year 2012. Outside of the U.S. there have only been 12 other women astronauts that have been in space. Today, about 10 percent of astronauts in NASA are women.

It bears many historical buildings, of which several are listed on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Heritage list. Location Bernardy≈Ñska street delimitates the eastern edge of the Bydgoszcz Old Town. It extends along a north‚Äìsouth axis, from Jagiellonian roundabout to Bernardy≈Ñski roundabout, via Bernardy≈Ñski bridge on the Brda river. Its length is approx. 450 m. Sketch of street project, ca 1859 Naming The street bore the following names: * 1870 - 1920, Kaiserstra√üe, referring to Wilhelm I, German emperor and king of Prussia * 1920 - 1939, Bernardynska Street * 1939 - 1945, Kaiserstra√üe * 1945 - 1949, Bernardynska Street * 1950 - 1956, Julian Marchlewski street * From 1956 - Bernardy≈Ñska Street Bernardynska Street gets its name from the Bernardine Monastery inhabited by monks from 1480 to 1829: today still stands the Church of Our Lady Queen of Peace in Bernardy≈Ñska Street. History Bernardynska Street was born from a mid-19th century project to extend the road connecting the Old Town to the suburbs. In addition, the construction of the a Prussian Eastern Railway line passing through Bydgoszcz in 1851 and the building of the Main station in the north-west of the city emphasized the need of a new bridge over the Brda River, so as to abate the traffic in Mostowa street and its narrow bridge. The eastern location was selected because of the need to reach the newly created suburbs in the 1830s. On December 7, 1855, an official application was filled for the construction of the new in the area of the former Bernardine monastery. Many official and financial difficulties, associated with the definition of the course of the street and acquisitions of terrain made the project drag on, coming to completion only 20 years later (1875): discussions with landlords and neighborhood about path locations went on till 1863! Another problem has been to cover the cost of \\"Most Bernardy≈Ñski\\", the bridge over the Brda river, which was a key element of the route: Prussian authorities conditioned the approval of the project upon the realization of a single-span bridge structure, leaving the navigation on the river open and safe. The issue has been solved only in 1866, with a promise from the Prussian government to fund the bridge. The construction work for the bridge started in 1867, first steel elements set on May 15, 1870, and the final completion of the Bernardy≈Ñska street occurred in 1872. The new axis was named \\"Emperor street\\", ( Kaiserstra√üe), in honor of William I, at that time newly proclaimed Emperor of the German Empire.

Mid-16th century Polish Gothic architecture, Renaissance architecture The origin of the church dates back to the arrival in 1480 of Bernardine monks in Bydgoszcz, coming from Krakow. The decision to invite Bernadines was made by king Casimir IV Jagiellon, while staying in Bydgoszcz castle during the Thirteen Years' War (1454‚Äì66) against the Teutonic Knights. On December 5, 1480, Wloclawek's bishop Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki granted the erection in Bydgoszcz of a Bernadine monastery, the third one in Poland after Krakow's and Warsaw's. Official founders were King Casimir IV Jagiellon, Hi≈Ñcza from Rog√≥w, Jarand from Pomian, Bydgoszcz's starost Jan Ko≈õcielecki and Bydgoszcz city council. Extract from a Bernardine monastery chronicle: \\" On the other side of the Brda River, to Kujawy settled down our brothers. A place was given to them with the consent of His Majesty the Polish King Casimir IV Jagiello, His Most Reverend Zbigniew Ole≈õnicki, bishop of Wloclawek. His episcopal Majesty arrived together with his brother Micha≈Ç Bal and his brother Stanislaw from K≈Çobuck, yore a famous of preacher, and two other brothers, designated by order of His Majesty to choose the place according to their taste. Attending also were its highness Jan Ko≈õcielecki, governor of Bydgoszcz, (...) There, the brothers chose a place convenient to the monastery as they saw it. \\" The construction of \\"St. Jerome and St. Francis church\\" has been completed in 1485 and the monastery library in 1488. The original temple was made of brick, as depicted by notes of a preserved chronicle of Bernardine: \\"Brothers of the Order after receiving permission for the construction of the convent, performed bricks, prepared lime, (...) cleared the bushes\\". Like often, the Bernardine monastery created an outstanding environment for intellectual culture development in Bydgoszcz. In the years 1518-1524, the abbey was led by Bartholomew of Bydgoszcz, a scholar, author of the first Latin-Polish dictionary (1532, 1544). During the 17th century, the abbot, Pawe≈Ç of ≈Åƒôczyca, was an active supporter of urban decorations, founder of the extensive gardens of the monastery, which were ancestors of today's Bydgoszcz parks. The Bernardines created the largest library in the city (1919 volumes, partially preserved until today at the municipal library) and established a rhetoric school (1529-1774), an observatory (1677), and a brewery. On August 10, 1545, a lightning stroke the abbey, causing a fire that burned down the church and a large part of the monastic buildings, the only buildings left were the library along with the vestry and the infirmary. On September 23, 1552, king Sigismund II Augustus granted permission for the reconstruction of the burned Bernardine church, with a caveat to its height that should not be taller than the neighboring castle for military-defensive purposes. Its architecture reflects Gothic and Renaissance characteristics. Saint George church was built from 1552-1557, thanks to the financial support of the Ko≈õcielecki family. Temple name was then changed to Holy Trinity. Garrison church, Bromberg ca 1900 On September 10, 1559, Sebastian of ≈ªydowo, a suffragan of Gniezno, consecrated the Holy Cross altar in the church, and in 1563, bell-founder Herman Benincke from Gda≈Ñsk cast the great bell of the monastery. The completion of the reconstruction lasted till the years 1590-1602: at that time, city nobleman Stanislaw Ma≈Ç≈ºewski unveiled the altar of the Holy Cross in the newly built Saint Anne chapel on the south side of the church (the chapel is still standing today). In 1595, Dorothy of Sp≈Çawski, Jan Ko≈õcielecki's wife, the Starost of Bydgoszcz, decorated the chapel of the convent with polychrome and three green rugs. The same year has been also erected the Saint Anne Brotherhood altar. Damaged during Swedish wars, the building has been rebuilt and renovated in the second half of the 17th century: * the western church peak was made taller (1648-1686); * the church tower was rebuilt with a square body (1677), as it is today; * in 1682-1685, to commemorate the 1683 Battle of Vienna, a chapel was built in the courtyard in front of the church, modeled after the sanctuary in Loreto. Under Prussian rule, seven altars were reported in the church, with a rich decor and a collection of liturgical objects. According to a site survey carried out in 1745, the church was covered with tiles, the sanctuary having a ceramic floor with aisles made of wood. In 1605, in the choir, was set a pipe organ, founded by Andrzej Grudzi≈Ñski and Daniel Jastrzƒôbski, town citizens. It was enlarged in 1618, then completely renovated in 1715. It survived until the Secularization of the church decided by Prussian authorities. Main elevation of the garrison church, Bydgoszcz Until the end of the 18th century, the crypt was used to bury religious members of the Bernardine Monastery, along with regular people who deserved to be honored by the convent and the church. Most important figures are buried under the floor of the church, including, among others: * Pawe≈Ç Koszucki (1609), secretary of the king and Poznan Wojski, lord of the royal village of Bartodzieje near Bydgoszcz; * Miko≈Çaj Jastrzƒôbski (1610), disciple of Bernardine observance; * Kazimierz Dornowski (1695), nobleman; * Katarzyna Raczy≈Ñska (1695), wife of a judge from Nak≈Ço nad NoteciƒÖ; * Katarzyna Orzelska (1703), noblewoman; * Stanis≈Çaw Pini≈Ñski (1715), burgrave of Bydgoszcz; * Micha≈Ç Komierowski (1766), nobleman; * Teresa Grabowska (1769), royal favorite. The main church suffered damages in 1812, during the stay of Russian troops. In 1817, with the secularization decided by Prussian authorities, the expropriation of the Bernadine religious property happened, but only at the death of the last monk of the congregation, father Nagabczy≈Ñski, in 1829. The abbey have then provided sanctuary for the Evangelical community (1830) and for evangelical seminary teachers. The cloister and the arcades connecting the church to the monastery were destroyed at this time. In 1840-1860, buildings were turned into a warehouse for furniture, straw or cartridges (the same happened to the Poor Clares' Church on Gda≈Ñska Street). In 1838, the church has been dedicated to the garrison's use, for Catholic and Evangelical soldiers ( Simultankirche). Later the Prussians destroyed the \\"Loreto chapel\\", and deeply rebuilt the interior of the church. From 1864-1866, the church was completely restored, under the supervision of Ferdinand von Quast, with Prussian funds. The main effort was the reconstruction of the western gable with Gothic Revival features: this gave this circular tower with its porch and the neo-Gothic peak, as we can notice today on the main elevation. After 1920, Polish authorities confirmed the use of the church for garrison purposes, as it is still used today. The church has been re-consecrated in 1923, by military bishop Stanis≈Çaw Gall. In 1926, it was renamed Saint George military parish church. During World War II, the building has been administered by the German War Ministry and after 1945, it served again as Polish army garrison church. In 1952, a rector has been nominated for the church, re-consecrated to Saint George on May 31, 1971. The church was built according to late gothic style. The oriented building without transept has got plastered blind openings, friezes and bands panes. From the north to the chancel stands a square church tower - with a 17th-century bell tower. The top of the main facade is crenelated, with neo-gothic pinnacles built in 1864-1866. The south-west corner of the church has a cylindrical tower, topped with a brick spire. Nave windows incorporate neo-Gothic traceries. Inside, the nave church is built with groin vaults. The walls are covered with 17th century tombstones. Adjacent to the church stand: the old remaining buildings of the Bernardine Monastery and the Chapel of Saint Anne built at the end of the 16th century. In the church is the oldest fresco heraldic of the city: an eagle from the first half of the 17th century. In 1967, archaeological excavations in the south of the church revealed foundations of the Loreto chapel, remnants of cloister galleries and a former municipal water oak pipe from the 16th century. In 1999, were discovered underground crypt burials. The oldest object is a rococo pulpit from the 2nd half of the 18th century. Other furniture have moved to the cathedral in the 1850s: * Saint Roch altar (1696) - in the southern nave, right of main entrance gate; * Saint Anthony altar (beginning of 18th century) - in the southern aisle, left of main entrance gate.

The seminar has been created on May 1, 1820, one of three centers of this type in Grand Duchy of Posen. The facility trained teachers for urban and rural elementary schools. From 1822, the Prussian Ministry began to part from the evangelical education institutions, where youth of all faiths were attending. In Bromberg, it was decided that the seminary would educate evangelical teachers, while in Poznan the same institution was converted into a school for catholic teachers. In Bromberg, a separate Catholic seminary would be created later on. The seminary took quickly the character of a German Protestant philosophy institution from 1825. Nearby, the ancient Bernardine monastery housed in 1830 a Lutheran community. In the years 1867-1872, while partly rebuilding the monastery, an evangelical seminary was also constructed in the vicinity. At that time, it was a three-year curriculum. Seminary was financed from state resources. Courses, apart from general and pedagogical subjects, also considered singing, music instruments, as well as horticulture and handicraft. Between 1870 and 1872, the new Bernady≈Ñska street was built on the western side of the building, and in 1880, on the front square was unveiled a War Memorial to commemorate the officers and soldiers who died on the fronts of military campaigns conducted by Kingdom of Prussia (Second Schleswig War in 1864, Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and Franco-Prussian War in 1870-1871). The monument has been liquidated in 1922, at the same place has been standing since 1925 the Monument of the Unknown Insurgent of the Greater Poland Uprising. School building in 1907 After 1920, when Bydgoszcz was rejoined the Poland, massive outflow of Germans from the city let the Protestant seminary for teachers useless. The building then housed in 1923 the University of Agriculture coming from Poznan. It was a 2.5 year long school which accepted applicants over the age of 17, having completed the sixth class of high school and one year of general practice in the farm. The curriculum changed to three years for boys, as a State Secondary School of Agriculture. In 1927, 86 students were enlisted, of which 46 coming from rural area. In 1935, the institution was transformed into a State High School Farm, the first in the country, culminating with the matura examination, which grants the access to university. The school building provided excellent housing conditions. On the back of the property was a large vegetable and fruit garden, in addition the school had its own 90 ha farm in the vicinity of Bydgoszcz. During Nazi occupation, the building housed the German Labour Office. After the end of World War II, the Polish Labour Office has been standing there, then a Technical Equipment department. In the late 1960s, the edifice has accommodated a branch of the University of Life Sciences in Pozna≈Ñ, focusing on agriculture (and animal husbandry from 1972). In 1971, with the return of the Agricultural College to Poznan, the institution became an independent branch of the university of Bydgoszcz as a Faculty of Agriculture (Division of zootechnics). Department headquarters were located in the building at Bernardy≈Ñska street 6, with other facilities in Hetma≈Ñska and Mazowiecki streets as weel as in Osielsko. At that time, it employed 80 teachers. In 1974, after the merger of the College of Engineering with Bydgoszcz Faculty of Agriculture, the building housed the seat of the Department of Agriculture of Bydgoszcz university. In 1975, this department was the first at the university to be granted the right to confer doctoral degrees in agricultural sciences. In 1991, some departments were transferred to the new university facility in Fordon and to a building on Kordecki street. Since 2006, the edifice houses a Department of Agriculture and Biotechnology from the University of Technology and Life Sciences of Bydgoszcz. The building displays characteristics from Historicism, with elements of Neo-Gothic and Neo-Romanesque. Its footprint is rectangle, with a basement and two storeys. the front avant-corps is topped by a triangular, with a tower which used to house a bell. Front upper floor in the avant-corps has got arched windows. Brick facades are divided by narrow pilasters and decorated with arcade cornices.

Works started in 1867, with the necessity to realize a one-span bridge that does not hinder water navigation on the river. The roadway had a width of 7.32, with a pedestrian way, based on cantilever beams. The steel bridge had two arched lattice girders, it was lit by four gas lamps standing on each side. The building was complete in 1872 under the name Kaiserbr√ºcke, referring to William I, emperor of Germany and king of Prussia. At the beginning of the 20th century, part of the renovation of the Wis≈Ça-Oder waterway required to rebuild the bridge to meet the constrains of modern shipping: it was necessary to raise the structure above the water by 60 cm. The new bridge thus was re- opened in 1903 and has stood till the outbreak of World War II. It has been blown up on September 4, 1939, by Polish sappers from the 62nd Infantry Regiment in order to prevent German forces from crossing the Brda. Provisionally rebuilt by Germans in autumn 1939, it has been again destroyed by the retreating Nazis on January 22, 1945. After World War II, remains of the bridge have been extracted from the Brda river and scrapped. From 1945 to 1960, a temporary wooden crossing has been set up, at the same location as today's bridge. The structure's rebuilding began in 1960, and was completed in 1963. The bridge has been built by overhangs, for the first time in the country by means of movable scaffolding. The designer, Maximilian Wolff received for it the second prize from the Committee for Construction, Urban Planning and Architecture. Bridge has re-opened in December 1963: it had a middle-track line for tramway, dual carriageway road with two lanes each and sidewalks for pedestrians. Partial repair occurred in 1968, a full overhaul in 2000. Since 2005, the structure is illuminated by night.

By 1920, it served as the first school for girls ( Erste M√§dchen von Volkschule). In 1921, the building housed a Polish primary school K. Piramowicz. It was a 7-class, primary school, for which headmaster in 1925 was Father Smarzyk, and in 1933 Father Menzel. By 1930, it functioned together with the German, evangelical primary school, located in a wing of the building. In 1933 were created two schools of mixed (girls and boys) pupils. During German occupation, the edifice accommodated for some time a prison, then in 1945 a military hospital. After World War II, it housed primary school No. 8 Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. With the school N¬∞8 in 2004, and after considering to lodge there city's appeal court, it has been eventually decided to put a Secondary School of Organization and Management. Since 2007, the building also houses the Museum of Freedom and Solidarity in Bydgoszcz. In 2010, the building has been transferred to the ownership of Bydgoszcz's University \\"Casimir the Great\\". The building's architecture is characteristic of 19th century's public buildings in Bydgoszcz, with references to the neo-gothic and Neo-Romanesque. The designer Carl Meyer has been influenced by the Hanover school of architecture, characterized by brick facades and absence of exterior plaster, decorative sculptures and colored surface. Carl Meyer also realised several other edifices in downtown Bydgoszcz, among others: * House at Gdanska Street 60; * House at August Cieszkowski Street N¬∞6; * Bydgoszcz Water supply station, along with architect Marshall. The building has a \\"L\\" shape with wings, two-storey, a basement and an attic. The elevation is divided by pilasters and adorned with brick-made friezes running under the cornice, like dentils. Avant-corps are topped with crow-stepped gable, typical of Carl Meyer's works.

On the Juche Idea () is a treatise attributed to North Korean leader Kim Jong-il on the North Korean Juche ideology. It is considered the most authoritative work on Juche. The work, although probably ghostwritten for him, legitimized Kim as the sole bona fide interpreter of the ideology. The treatise systemizes Kim Jong-il and his father Kim Il-sung's thought on the Juche philosophy. The treatise marks Juches departure from the materialism of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and posits the consciousness of the massess as dependent on the working class leader. According to Kim Jong-il, the Juche idea is composed of a philosophical principle, socio-historical principles, and guiding principles. The philosophical principle can be summarized with Kim Il-sung's maxim that \\"man is the master of everything and decides everything.\\" The socio-historical principles entail that the working masses are the subject of history. The guiding principles are: independent stance, creative method, and giving precedence to ideological consciousness. Emphasis on independence in particular has given raise to Kim's Songun, or military first, politics.  Background  On the Juche Idea is one of Kim Jong-il's major writings on Juche and considered the most authoritative work on it. It is a standard textbook on the subject. The treatise is a systematization of both President Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's thought on Juche philosophy and offers the most comprehensive account of Juche. Kim Il-sung's thought in particular began to be formulated as an original philosophy from the 1970s onward. On the Juche Idea was sent to the national seminar on the Juche idea on 31 March 1982 held on the occasion of the 70th birth anniversary of Kim Il-sung (15 April). The occasion was also honored with the unveiling of the Juche Tower in Pyongyang. In the treatise, Kim Jong-il links the birth of the Juche idea to Kim Il- sung's personal history as a guerrilla fighter during the anti-Japanese struggle. On the Juche Idea thus furthered Kim Il-sung's cult of personality. Publishing the treatise helped Kim Jong-il to gain legitimacy, particularly emphasizing his intellectual prowess. At the time of writing Kim Jong-il was working as the ideological chief of the country on behalf of his father. Although it was probably ghostwritten for him, by being named as the author Kim Jong-il became the \\"one and only bona fide interpreter of the 'immortal Juche idea' of Kim Il Sung.\\"  Content  Kim Jong-il explains that Juche is a departure from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism rather than simply a reinterpretation of it. According to Kim, Juche offers not only an \\"independent and creative\\" direction to the Korean revolution, but also establishes a new era for human history. It is idealist as opposed to the materialism of Marxism. The work is considered somewhat abstract in style. In comparison to Kim Il-sung's writings, Kim Jong-il pays particular attention to consciousness and the concept of the leader. These two are often linked. According to Charles K. Armstrong, the main message of the treatise is that \\"regardless of material circumstances, the masses owe unquestioning obedience to the Great Leader, who alone can bring the masses to consciousness\\", adding that the \\"message would be extremely useful for the North Korean state in the difficult years ahead\\", referring to the death of Kim Il-sung and the North Korean famine in the 1990s, soon after the publication of On the Juche Idea. In On the Juche Idea, Kim Jong-il divides Juche into three components: the philosophical principle, the socio-historical principles, and the guiding principles of the Juche idea. = Philosophical principle = The philosophical principle entails that Juche is a man-centered philosophy. Man has independence, and , which places man at the center of the world. This is described by the maxim coined by Kim Il-sung in a 1972 interview with Japanese journalists: \\"man is the master of everything and decides everything.\\" Man transforms the world and embodies ', or independence and autonomy. By putting man at the center, Kim Jong-il denies the existence of any supernatural power, although the Juche philosophy itself can be said to have quasi-religious elements. = Socio-historical principles = The socio-historical principles of Juche can be summarized as follows: the working masses are the subject of history. Human history is the struggle of the masses to realize their independence and defend it. Man's socio-historical mission is to transform both nature and society. Here Kim departs from Marxism‚ÄìLeninism by primarily setting man against nature rather than the proletariat against the bourgeois class. = Guiding principles = There are three guiding principles in Juche: #First, independent stance means Juche in ideology, independence in politics, self-sufficiency in economy and self- reliance in defense. These four aspects of the independent stance can be already found in Kim Il-sung's 1965 speech given in Indonesia, On Socialist Construction in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the South Korean Revolution. Even though On the Juche Idea mentions economy, it is not given precedence. Words like \\"development\\" and \\"growth\\" are more often used to refer to ideology rather than economy. However, noting that an economy built on \\"self-reliance does not mean building an economy in isolation\\", Kim does hint at limited economic reforms. Sure enough, a law on joint-ventures was passed in 1984. #The second principle, creative method, means that all problems arising in the revolution and construction are to be solved by relying on the creativity of the masses. #The third and final guiding principle is giving precedence to ideological consciousness over all other work.  Legacy  On the Juche Idea has been since used as a justification for Kim Jong-il's Songun, or army-first, politics. The justification can be found in an aspect of one of the guiding principles of Juche, which Kim has \\"elevated\\": self- reliance in defense. Kim went on to publish \\"The Workers' Party of Korea Is a Juche-type Revolutionary Party which Inherited the Glorious Tradition of the DIU\\" in October 1982 and focusing in it more on Kim Il-sung's guerrilla activities.

It has been described as \\"an almost perfect kleptocracy\\" in which the scale of systemic corruption and the rulers' indifference towards the people's welfare place it at the bottom of every major governance indicator or ranking, below nations with similar per capita GDPs. \\"Few countries symbolize oil-fuelled corruption and nepotism more than Equatorial Guinea\\", wrote Jan Mouawad in the New York Times in July 2009. Its corruption system, according to the Open Society Foundations (OSF), is \\"unparalleled in its brazenness\\". This government is controlled by a limited group of powerful individuals who divert most of the country's revenues into their own clandestine bank accounts in other nations. Equatorial Guinea's corruption is so entrenched, scholar Geoffrey Wood has claimed, that it can be classified as a criminal state. This situation is especially dramatic due in large part to the massive scale of the country's revenues from oil and other natural resources. The Guardian noted that the nation is enormously wealthy due to vast oil reserves, but that that wealth is concentrated in the hands of an elite minority. Despite its GDP per capita of $32,026 ‚Äì which makes it richer than any other African country and places it above Spain, Portugal, and Russia ‚Äì Equatorial Guinea is ranked 136th out of 187 countries in the Human Development Index measure of quality of life. While the people of Equatorial Guinea technically have a per capita GDP similar to Spain or Italy, the vast majority live in poverty worse than Afghanistan or Chad, according to Arvind Ganesan of Human Rights Watch in 2009, attributing this disparity to the government's corruption, incompetence, and disregard of its own people's well- being. Most people in Equatorial Guinea remain in abject poverty, with no access to healthcare or education. Meanwhile, any criticism of the ruling class is non-existent due to the government's use of force and intimidation to silence opposition. Sasha Lezhnev of Global Witness noted in 2008 that the government earns oil revenues in the billions yearly, while the population lives on less than $1 a day. President Teodoro Obiang is said to have control over the oil reserves and the government, Ganesan claimed, and consequentially the country's immensely rich treasury is \\"a private cash machine for a few\\" rather than used for any public benefit. According to the Financial Times, foreign diplomats joke that Equatorial Guinea is a family-run business which holds a seat at the UN. The nation is known among foreign businessmen as a poor environment for business and investments. The individual who has become most associated in the international media with the corruption of Equatorial Guinea's leaders is Teodorin Obiang, a son of the president whose lavish lifestyle in southern California, Paris, and elsewhere has made headlines and been the target of investigations by American and French authorities, among others. Because of the levels of corruption, the country always ranks near the bottom of Transparency International's (TI) Corruption Perception Index. In 2009, only seven countries were lower. It is the only nation in the world since 2008 to receive a score of 'zero' for budget transparency. In 2008, a U.S. State Department report indicated that officials in Equatorial Guinea are frequently engaging in corruption and illegal practices with impunity. In 2014, the country received a score of zero on TI's \\"Open Budget Index.\\" From 1996 to 2013, the Economic Intelligence Unit gave the country a score of 0.0 for \\"control of corruption\\". On the National Resource Governance Institute's Resource Governance Index, Equatorial Guinea received a \\"failing\\" score of 13/100, ranking 56th out of 58 countries. On \\"reporting practices\\", it received a score of 14/100, for a rank of 55th. In 2011, Freedom House put Equatorial Guinea in its \\"worst of the worst\\" category for governments that violate human rights and civil liberties, which also includes North Korea, Sudan, and Turkmenistan. In its 2014 world report, Human Rights Watch (HRW) stated: \\"Corruption, poverty, and repression continue to plague Equatorial Guinea.....Vast oil revenues fund lavish lifestyles for the small elite surrounding the president, while a large proportion of the population continues to live in poverty. Mismanagement of public funds and credible allegations of high-level corruption persist, as do other serious abuses, including arbitrary detention, secret detention, and unfair trials.\\" Corruption system =Nepotism= This corruption system has existed in more or less its present form since the early 1980s, when the government seized farmland on Bioko Island belonging mostly to Spanish and Portuguese owners and redistributed it to members of the Nguema/Mongomo group. The Nguema/Mongomo group Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo with then-President of Brasil, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva. Corruption in Equatorial Guinea is carried out via an elaborate system that is the exclusive province of President Obiang and his circle, known collectively as \\"the Nguema/Mongomo group\\". The members of this group divert revenue from Equatorial Guinea's natural resources, including land and hydrocarbon, to their own private accounts. Equatorial Guinea's corruption system has been called \\"a seamless and self-reinforcing web of political, economic, and legal power,\\" whereby the members of the Nguema/Mongomo group employ the power of the government to enrich themselves. Their increasing wealth enables them, in turn, to finance ever more efficiently their political machine that subverts and undermines effective opposition through repression, intimidation, violence, and bribery. Meanwhile, the group's domination of the legal system enables them to make their misappropriate of wealth appear lawful. Several sources indicate that there are serious tensions within the group, with considerable competition for power and favors. =Foreign bank accounts and shell companies= Between 1995 and 2004, much of the money extorted from the people of Equatorial Guinea by the Nguema/Mongomo group was deposited in Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C. According to Human Rights Watch, Riggs had been aware of the level of corruption and human rights concerns in the country. A 2004 U.S. Senate probe determined that Equatorial Guinea's oil-revenues account at Riggs Bank was controlled by three persons: President Obiang, Africa's longest-serving dictator; his son Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima (who is minister of mines); and his nephew, Melchor Esono Edjo (who is secretary of state for treasury and budget). Two signatures, the President's and that of either his son or nephew, were required to remove funds from the account. From 2000 to 2003, about $34 million was transferred from that account into foreign bank accounts held by shell corporations ‚Äì for example, an account at Spain's Banco Santander owned by Kalunga S.A., a firm registered in Panama, and an account at HSBC Luxembourg owned by Apexside Trading Ltd. Probes by a Spanish NGO and by the Open Society Justice Initiative showed that millions of dollars from the Kalunga account were spent on properties in Spain purchased in the names of President Obiang and other high officials, former high officials, and Obianga relatives. =Later expropriations= Since then, the government has expropriated other valuable land, mostly the homes of poor and middle-class Equatoguineans. Thousands of people have been the victims of these seizures, for which very few of them are compensated and in response to which they have no legal recourse. Many of those who have protested these expropriations have been abused and intimidated by soldiers or police. Officially, these lands are seized for public purposes, but in fact they have ended up in the hands of members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, who have built homes or businesses on the properties. In 2003, for example, Le Temps (Geneva) reported on a village in which 75 people lived in abject poverty having been uprooted by the regime from their homes, which had been used to construct a methanol factory without compensation or apology. A 2013 Amnesty report stated that over 1,000 families in the country had been forcibly removed from their homes so that the government could build roads, luxury homes and hotels, and shopping centers. Many of the homes demolished were in perfect shape, with the vast majority of those living there holding land titles. Despite promises from the government to relocate victims to new homes, to date no one has been compensated in any way. =Exploitation of natural resources= The 1990s saw the discovery of petroleum and natural gas in the waters off Equatorial Guinea. The \\"oil rush\\" began in 1995 when ExxonMobil began working the Zafiro field; shortly after, Hess and Marathon also began exploiting the nation's natural-gas reserves. By 2005, Equatorial Guinea was sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest oil producer, after Nigeria and Angola. Even as the oil and gas business has thrived, however, most Equatoguineans have continued to support themselves through subsistence farming and lived almost exclusively outside of the nation's monetary economy. This is because government authorities have used their political power to limit participation in the exploitation of the country's natural resources to themselves and other members of the Nguema/Mongomo group, granting business licenses and approvals only to the chosen few. Agencies that provide jobs in these businesses are also owned by members of the group, and the granting of such jobs is also limited in a similar way. =Other forms of corruption= Other means by which members of Nguema/Mongomo group enrich themselves include \\"sweetheart\\" co-investments with foreign companies (deals with such favorable terms they cannot logically be passed up), rigged contracts, bribes from foreign companies to the Nguema/Mongomo group, and monopoly arrangements for all Nguema/Mongomo enterprises involved in the petroleum and gas industry. For example, a U.S. Senate probe noted that Mobil, in 1998‚Äì99, had sold a 15% stake in a joint business, Mobil Oil Guinea Ecuatorial (MOGE), to the Obiang- owned company Socio Abayak, S.A., for $2,300. By 2004, Abayak's MOGE holdings were worth $645,000. ExxonMobil could not explain the sale to Senate investigators. Another firm, Marathon, has paid Obiang over $2 million for land. Amerada Hess paid government officials and their relatives nearly $1 million for building leases. Of 28 properties Hess leased in Equatorial Guinea, 18 were owned by Obiang family members and persons connected to the family. Representatives for both Hess and ExxonMobil told U.S. Senate investigators that they had purchased their security services in Equatorial Guinea, at non-negotiable prices, from Sociedad Nacional de Vigilancia (Sonavi), which is owned by Obiang's brother, Armengol Ondo Nguema, and which has a monopoly on security services in the country. As of 2009, according to the U.S. State Department, most ministers in Equatorial Guinea also operate conflated businesses along with their government responsibilities. For instance, the minister of justice owns his own private law firm, while the minister of transport and communications was director of the firm's board and owned shares in both the parastatal airline and the national telephone company. In addition, in 2008 when the government began distributing funds for social projects for the social development fund (SDF), a development mechanism created jointly with foreign investors to promote a culture of transparency and openness, one minister reportedly chose his own firm to receive funds rather than any bidding firms. It also surfaced that the minister had not even placed a bid of their own. The minister defended his actions by claiming his firm was eligible to receive SDF money. Members of the Nguema/Mongomo group =President Obiang= The President has been criticized as living a life of lavish and absurd luxury yielding considerable waste. He has six personal aircraft, homes in Cape Town, Paris, Madrid, Las Palmas and Maryland, and bank accounts in numerous countries, including France and Switzerland. He bought a $2.6 million residence in Potomac, Maryland in 1999. A 2001 memorandum noted the sale by Obiang of two properties in Spain for $5 million, which was deposited in Riggs Bank. =Constancia Mangue= Obiang's so-called \\"senior wife\\", Constancia Mangue (he has five wives), who is considered first lady, is minister of health and social action. She bought her own $1.15 million residence in Potomac, Maryland, not to be confused with her husband's home in the same city. At one point, five accounts and three certificates of deposit at Riggs Bank were held in Constancia's name, and ExxonMobil made several payments into these accounts. Andrew P. Swiger of ExxonMobil told investigators that his firm co-owned the Obiang energy firm Abayak with Constancia, who, he said, received 15 percent of all revenue from Abayak. A company called Nusiteles, G.E., founded in 2000 to provide domestic telephone and computer services, is partly owned by the Obiangs through Abayak, and partly owned by other high Equatoguinean officials. As of 2004, Abayak is the only construction company in all of Equatorial Guinea. The President and First Lady also own two clinics called Virgen de Guadalupe, as came to light in January 2009 when a Paraguayan couple who had worked at the clinics were arrested in January 2009 for stealing 6.1 million euros in cash, jewelry, and other valuables. In October 2013, according to a Spanish news source, Contancia Mangue and Cristina Lima, another of Obiang's wives, got into a heated argument over dinner with Obiang. Mangue accused Lima, who was described as the country's second lady, of doing nothing to help the country's women. In return Lima accused Mangue of looting the nation's wealth. Obiang reportedly intervened several times and told his wives to go to their own hometowns. =Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima= Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima holds a degree in Economics from Alma College, Dallas in Texas. Between 1999 and 2003, he was Secretary of State for Mines and Hydrocarbons and became the Vice Minister of Mines, Industry and Energy in 2003. He also became the Government Representative in the Equity of the State in production sharing contracts, and Hydrocarbons Presidential Advisor. As the President of the Committee for the Monitoring of Petroleum Operations and a board member of SONAGAS, GEPetrol and SEGESA as well as the Africa Oil & Power (AOP), Gabriel has risen through the ranks to become the current Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons in the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. His astute leadership as a Minister, has led to a resurgence in the production and exportation of more than 350,000 barrels of oil per day. His past positions, experience and initiatives has contributed significantly to advancing the country‚Äôs oil and gas industry as one among the five largest in sub Saharan Africa. For a country whose economy is largely dependent on petroleum exploration and production, a visionary leader like Gabriel Obiang Lima is a great asset to drive an emergent and sustainable agenda. Equatorial Guinea has since 2017, become the 14th Global and 6th African Member State to be part of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Through efforts to foster transparency and combat corruption in the Oil and Gas Industry, Gabriel Obiang Lima also facilitated the country‚Äôs move to rejoin the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI), following its expulsion by the EITI board in 2010. https://www.africaoilandpower.com/about/sponsors/ministry-of-mines-and- hydrocarbons-equatorial-guinea/ President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in 2007 rolled out a strategic development plan, Horizon 2020 agenda aimed at a sustainable economy by 2020. Attempts at its implementation saw a partnership with Energy Allied International, a Houston based firm, to advance the petrochemical sector of the country under the leadership of the then Minister Delegate of the Ministry of Mines, Industry and Energy, Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima, in 2011. https://www.africaoilandpower.com/2017/07/17/cameroon-eq- guinea-to-jointly-develop-gas-fields/ https://roscongress.org/en/speakers/obian-lima-gabriel-mbaga/biography/ The partnership with the firm was projected to create more jobs for citizens. Additionally, Gabriel Obiang Lima supervised the nation‚Äôs partnership with Royal Vopak, a Dutch storage-facilities giant, to build a crude oil storage terminal that will enhance the distribution of crude oil on the island of Bioko. The Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons under the able leadership of Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima, has again executed definitive agreements through engagements with major oil and gas industry players, particularly Alen Unit to monetize gas and has launched several other successful initiatives including LNG2Africa, the Fortuna FLNG, the Gas Mega-Hub as well as the Year of Energy 2019 and Year of Investment 2020 projects. https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/central-africa/equatorial-guinea/equatorial- guinea-economic-outlook All of these projects were aimed at promoting local companies and achievements, boosting foreign capital investments and consequently positioning Equatorial Guinea and the African continent on the international level. The Minister‚Äôs notable and distinguished efforts towards the nation‚Äôs development especially in the mines and hydrocarbons sector cannot be overemphasized. Due to the contribution from the energy and oil sector, there has been improved macroeconomic performance which has affected public finances. Taxes from that sector has increased revenue, with a significant increment of 7.2% in non-oil revenues. https://www.africaoilandpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/3-Equatorial- Guinea-MInister-presentation.pdf Thus, as a result of the country‚Äôs oil windfall and commendable efforts of Gabriel Mbega Obiang Lima as Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons, Equatorial Guinea cease not to witness a rapid infrastructural development in areas such as roads, airports, electricity production and distribution to other African Countries. https://www.hrw.org/news/2019/06/21/equatorial-guinea-move-rejoin-anti- corruption-group =Candido Nsue Okomo= Until early 2015, Candido Nsue Okomo, the First Lady's brother, served as head of the state-owned oil company, GEPetrol. Foreign oil executives complained that Okomo made ludicrous and impossible demands of them and hindered investments. The Netherlands-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations noted that President Obiang and his family have personal interests in GEPetrol and that Transparency International (TI) gave GEPetrol a low score for transparency in its 2008 revenue report, indicating the company to be highly intransparent. Okomo is now minister of youth and sports. =Ruslan Obiang= Ruslan Obiang, a son of the President, is Equatorial Guinea's sports minister and president of a top soccer club, the \\"Panthers\\". He has lived in Spain, where he encouraged firms to do business in his country. Several Spanish businessmen have complained about the consequences of these deals. One Spaniard who had paid $200,000 to secure a contract to build soccer stadiums described a system that involved bribes at every turn. After paying bribes for years, however, his deal eventually fell apart when he refused to pay any more in bribes to Ruslan Obiang and his associates. The businessman was critical of business in the country, saying officials exploit as much money as possible until moving on to another contractor. The businessman also noted that he had been threatened on several occasions, both with violence, and trumped-up rape charges that could have resulted in him being imprisoned. His report claimed that there is no avenue for justice in the nation, since \\"[t]he corruption is absolute and endemic; there is nobody you can turn to.\\" After the deal collapsed, one of his business partners was visited at his Portugal home by men in dark suits who staked outside his home for several days as a threat and then visited him in his office. Herein they warned him that if he reported his story to the media or any authorities there would be consequences. He concluded: \\"You sign a contract with the son of the president and you believe it is worth something. You have no idea what is going to happen to you. We had to flee the country. We were afraid for our lives.\\" =Ricardo Mangue Obama Nfubea= Ricardo Mangue Obama Nfubea became prime minister in 2006 and promised to fight corruption. However his purported efforts have had an almost no impact on corruption in the country. =Emilio O√±ebula= A foreign businessman complained that his difficulties with doing business in Equatorial Guinea only become worse when he was required to deal with Emilio O√±ebula, a senior official in the sports ministry: \\"Everything is so easy that you fall for it. As long as you are paying them, they do not leave you alone for a moment. Initially I thought that this was just the way they did things, but I later realized that they are simply keeping an eye on you. If you went out alone, they got angry. We were watched the whole time.\\" =Teodorin Obiang= Teodoro Nguema Obiang, known as Teodorin, is the President's oldest son and was for many years the country's minister of forestry. He has been sardonically called \\"the world's richest minister of agriculture and forestry.\\" Through his solely owned firm Grupo Sofana and its affiliate Somagui Forestal, Teodorin owned, and may still own, \\"exclusive rights of exploiting and exporting timber in Equatorial Guinea.\\" Teodorin also owns the nation's only TV station, as well as Radio Asonga, the nation's main radio station. In May 2012, he was removed from the ministry and given the title of \\"second vice president\\", a position that is not mentioned in the nation's constitution, and placed in charge of state security. The heir apparent to the presidency, Teodorin has been described as \\"fantastically corrupt\\" and has been called \\"an unstable, reckless idiot\\" by a former U.S. intelligence official. His lifestyle, which has been characterized by Foreign Policy as a \\"surreal playboy life,\\" has been the focus of media attention around the world, making him the personification of the Obiang regime's corruption. A 2009 New York Times article stated that U.S. officials believed that the vast majority of Teodorin's assets derived \\"from corruption related to the extensive oil and gas reserves discovered more than a decade and a half ago off the coast of his tiny West African country.\\" Another source of Teodorin's wealth, according to the article, was a tax on timber, the payments of which were made directly to him. The Justice Department also suggested that Teodorin might be taking bribes or extortion payments from oil companies. Later investigations by the U.S. Senate and other bodies (see below) established many of the sources of his wealth and uncovered details of his personal expenditures. Teodorin \\"shamelessly looted his government and shook down businesses in his country to support his lavish lifestyle, while many of his fellow citizens lived in extreme poverty,\\" said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell in 2014. Although Teodorin's annual salary was about $100,000, he had managed \\"through bribes, kickbacks, embezzlement, and extortion\\" to accumulate a fortune of over $300 million, including major U.S. assets owned and acquired through shell companies and third parties. The U.S. Department of Justice has accused Teodorin of carrying out \\"corruption schemes\\" and charging businesses illegal commissions. It has further charged him with extorting France's Isoroy, Spain's ABM, and Italy's Agroforestal. \\"He threatened timber companies, among them Isoroy and ABM, that refused to meet his payment demands,\\" according to the charge. One Spanish businessmen told El Pais in 2013 that he and his business partners had run several firms in Malabo and Bata between 2009 and 2011, and simply to meet with Teodor√≠n at his house in Paris to make necessary arrangements required payment of a so-called \\"intentions royalty\\" of 40,000 to 100,000 euros. Also, the government compelled foreign businessmen to leave machinery behind when they were done with it so that the government could keep it. \\"If you don't accept,\\" said the businessman, \\"you know that you will end up in the Black Beach prison.\\" Another Spanish businessman, who supervised ABM's operations in Equatorial Guinea from 1995 to 1997, said Teodor√≠n \\"would call us to come to his office, which meant wearing a suit and tie. He would keep you waiting for five hours and then appear wearing shorts. He would then tell you how much he wanted you to pay him, and that you had a week to do so, saying: 'If you don't pay, we will confiscate the machinery and give your concession to the Chinese.' We had to flee the country. He was demanding millions. The only ones who stayed were those who paid him.\\" Yet another Spanish firm, which was forced to work with a local company on whose board of directors Teodorin sat, \\"had to pay commissions at every stage of the way\\" and was confronted \\"with permits and other obstacles\\"; after the firm had filled a warehouse with timber, one member of the firm was arrested and imprisoned on trumped-up charges of rape, apparently a standard way of treating foreign businesspeople. \\"He caught malaria and had a fever....In return for being allowed to leave, he had to agree to leave all his money and the timber warehouse behind.\\" As of March 2014, Roberto Berardi, an Italian businessman who partnered with Teodorin in a construction company, was serving a 28-month sentence in Bata prison after being found guilty on charges of misappropriation brought by Teodorin; Bernardi has said \\"he was unjustly jailed after he demanded explanations from Teodorin for their company, Eloba Construccion S.A., being named in the U.S. investigation against the vice-president.\\" Activities in U.S. In 1991, Teodorin, then 22, enrolled in an English language course at Pepperdine University in Malibu. Walter International, a U.S. energy firm with a stake in Equatorial Guinea's offshore fields, agreed to pay his $3400 tuition and his living expenses. Teodorin rejected the dormitory and instead \\"shuttled between two off-campus residences: a rental home in Malibu and a suite at the Beverly Wilshire hotel. He rarely attended class, instead spending much of his time shopping in Beverly Hills. Teodorin dropped out of the program after five months; Walter International's tab came to about $50,000.\\" From 2004 to 2008, U.S. lawyers, bankers, and real estate and escrow agents helped Teodorin move over $110 million through U.S. bank accounts. From 1998 to 2006, he owned a mansion on a 16-acre estate at 3620 Sweetwater Mesa Road, in the private gated community of Serra Retreat in Malibu. He owned the house through his company Sweetwater Mesa LLC, which in April 2006 sold this property to another of his shell firms, Sweetwater Malibu LLC. (He also owns a firm called Sweetwater Management Inc.) The $35 million purchase price made it the sixth costliest home purchase in the U.S. in 2006. It was also the most expensive home purchase in California in 2006. The estate includes two guard houses. \\"A long, tree-lined driveway runs from the estate's main gate past a motor court with fountains and down to a 15,000-square-foot mansion with eight bathrooms and an equal number of fireplaces,\\" reported Foreign Policy in 2011. \\"The grounds overlook the Pacific Ocean, complete with swimming pool, tennis court, four-hole golf course, and Hollywood stars Mel Gibson, Britney Spears, and Kelsey Grammer for neighbors.\\" Over the years a dozen former employees at his Malibu estate sued him for unpaid salaries, overtime, and expenses. They described a lifestyle consisting of \\"drug 'binges'...escort service girls, Playboy bunnies, and even a tiger.\\" One ex-employee said, \\"I never witnessed him perform anything that looked like work....His days consisted entirely of sleeping, shopping and partying.\\" Teodorin's female companions in southern California have included a porn actress, a former Playboy Playmate of the Month, and a Grammy-winning rapper and actress named Eve, whom he appointed as president, treasurer, and CFO of one of his shell companies, Sweet Pink. He also secured female party guests from escort agencies. In 2005, he paid $700,000 to rent a yacht from Microsoft's Paul Allen for a party. In 2009 he spent a month on Maui, flying there on his Gulfstream V, chartering another jet for employees, and also bringing along escort girls, sports cars, and a speedboat. At one point he routinely carried up to $1 million in cash into the U.S., and always had a bag stuffed with fresh $100 bills. He has stayed in the $5,000-a-night presidential suite at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas and has also spent time in Miami and Palm Beach, in addition to such places outside the U.S. as Bermuda, Nice, and Paris. Teodorin owned and ran TNO Records and TNO Entertainment, which produced two techno records in 2003. He also released a rap song, \\"No Better Than This\\", by Won-G Bruny. A 2009 New York Times article reported that, as of that time, Teodorin frequently visited the U.S., traveling on a diplomatic passport. In addition to the Malibu home, Teodorin also paid $6.5 million in 2001 for a house in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, but never moved in. The house was on Antelo Road, across the street from the residence of the actress Farrah Fawcett. He tried to buy luxury apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan but was barred by the homeowner's association. Senate investigators found he spent $59,850 for rugs, $58,000 for a home theater, and $1,734.17 for a pair of wine glasses. At one point he owned 32 motorcycles and automobiles in California, including \\"seven Ferraris, five Bentleys, four Rolls Royces, two Lamborghinis, two Maybachs, two Mercedes, two Porsches, one Aston-Martin, and one Bugatti, with a collective insured value of $9.5 million.\\" Since there were \\"far too many cars to keep at the estate,\\" he rented garage space at the Petersen Automotive Museum on Wilshire Boulevard. As of 2012, according to Time Magazine, his fleet of cars included a half-million-dollar 2011 Ferrari. Teodorin also owns an expensive collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia. At one point he went on \\"a $3.2 million spree on Jackson items. He paid $275,000 for one of the singer's white crystal-covered gloves and $80,000 on a pair of his crystal-covered socks. He also spent $245,000 on a basketball signed by Jackson and the basketball player Michael Jordan.\\" One report identifies the \\"white, crystal-encrusted glove\\" as having been worn on Jackson's \\"Bad\\" tour. Teodorin also owned the red leather jacket Jackson wore in his \\"Thriller\\" video. In 2005, Teodorin tried unsuccessfully to have a U.S. oil firm, Ocean Energy, buy him a $40 million Gulfstream jet. The next year he spent $30 million up front for a Gulfstream G-V private jet. He bought the jet through a British Virgin Islands-registered shell company called Ebony Shine International, Ltd. Once he sent it from Rio to Los Angeles to fetch his barber. \\"In one six-week period in 2006,\\" reported the New York Times in 2009, Teodorin had \\"transferred $33,799,799.99 to the United States...which was used to buy\\" the jet. As of October 2012 his private jet was \\"believed to be in Equatorial Guinea but US officials said they would try to seize it if it ever lands in another country.\\" In a single month he spent \\"$80,000 at Gucci and $50,000 at Dolce & Gabbana\\" for designer clothing. Dolce & Gabbana would periodically send a sales associate and tailor to his estate with racks of merchandise for him to browse and \\"would close off its second-floor showroom when his girlfriends came in to shop.\\" One girlfriend \\"racked up about $80,000 in purchases, including bronze and red dresses that cost nearly $7,000 apiece.\\" In June 2005 he bought two 50-foot speedboats worth $2 million and shipped one to Hawaii so he could use it there. In 2008 \\"he commissioned a German company...to design a 'mega yacht' worth $380 million, nearly three times what Equatorial Guinea spends on health and education in a year. After the plan became public, Equatorial Guinea announced he would not be buying it.\\" Activities in France In late 2010, Teodorin shipped his collection of sports cars and $400,000 worth of motorcycles, from Los Angeles to France. For a time, he lived at a Paris hotel off the Champs-√âlys√©es; one day in Paris he bought over 30 suits. As of 2012, he owned \\"a five-story mansion on Paris' swank Avenue Foch,\\" where he had \\"kept 11 luxury cars, including a Maserati and an Aston Martin, until French police seized them\\" in late 2011 or early 2012. His neighbors on Avenue Foch described \\"how a parade of tailors from France's top fashion houses regularly arrived at the house while Teodorin was there.\\" Activities in South Africa In 2004, he purchased two homes in Cape Town worth a total of $7 million and also spent about $1.45 million on three cars. George Ehlers, owner of a South African construction firm who said the government of Equatorial Guinea owed him nearly $7.8 million, tried to recoup the debt by gaining ownership of the two mansions as collateral. In 2006, he secured an attachment order from the Cape Town High Court. In a court affidavit, however, Teodorin claimed that the houses belonged to him and not to his government, and explained that he could afford them because \\"Cabinet Ministers and public servants in Equatorial Guinea are by law allowed to owe [sic] companies that, in consortium with a foreign company, can bid for government contracts and should the company be successful, then what percentage of the total cost of the contract the company gets, will depend on the terms negotiated between the parties.\\" Activities in Equatorial Guinea The French engineering firm Bouygues built Teodorin a free mansion in Malabo, the capital of Equatorial Guinea. He also ordered foreign firms to install zinc-tile roofs on thousands of poor Equatorialguinean homes at a time when he had a \\"substantial financial interest\\" in the zinc-roofing industry. Other activities by Teodorin Reportedly, Teodorin also purchased a home in Buenos Aires. =Other family members= Obiang's three other wives also have government positions. Maria Verminia Buckanan Garc√≠a is technical adviser to the ministry of education. Shaw has a position in technical administration, and Elema is in the agricultural ministry. Other members of the family who hold high government positions are Obiang's brother Antonio Mba Nguema, who became defense minister in April 2015, and his nephew Baltasar Engonga, who is head of regional integration. Effects Equatorial Guinea is considered wealthy by African standards, with a GDP that routinely outperforms neighboring African nations, in most instances by over 300 percent, and that has grown steadily in recent years. Indeed, its per capital GDP now exceeds those of Italy, Israel, and South Korea. But thanks to the massive diversion of funds from the national treasury into the Nguema/Mongomo group's bank accounts, the people of Equatorial Guinea live in desperate poverty, with over 60% earning less than $1 a day. Life expectancy is below 50, 57% of the people lack clean drinking water, 47% lack safe plumbing, and the level of medical care is primitive. The country has the world's fourth-highest infant mortality rate. Many of these kinds of indicators have gone from bad to worse in recent years. A 2009 UNDP report found that the difference between Equatorial Guinea's per capita GDP rank and its HDI (Human Development Index) rank was the world's highest, implying that Equatorial Guinea is the worst governed country on the planet. Anti-corruption efforts According to Transparency International, the control of corruption in Equatorial Guinea is among the lowest 1% in the world, with citizens of the country believing that many public authorities perform for personal gain. The rule of law of the country was ranked in the lowest 9% among nations by Transparency International as well. =EG Justice= There is no human-rights organization or anti- corruption group in Equatorial Guinea. The human-rights group EG Justice, which focuses on such issues in the country, is based abroad. Its executive director, Tutu Alicante, has lived in U.S. exile since age 19 and describes his country as having two realities. \\"It has the highest GDP per capita but also the widest gap between rich and poor people.\\" Despite being \\"on paper the richest country on the continent on a per capita basis, on a par with many European nations,\\" he told The Guardian in 2014, Equatorial Guinea has \\"one of the highest income and standard of living disparities....The income per capita is one which should allow people to have the same access to healthcare etc. as most European nations. Then you look at the rates of access to water, access to adequate healthcare, access to education, infant mortality, maternal mortality, and you see that we are basically where the DRC is, where Haiti is. The gap between the income and the access to basic needs and rights is astronomical.\\" The reason for the absence of human-rights or anti-corruption groups, he has explained, is that the country is small, and any institution, such as a church, \\"that the government perceives as sufficiently powerful is immediately co-opted\\" or \\"completely undermined.\\" Also, there are no labor unions, and any meeting of over five people requires a government permit. When the African Football Confederation (CAF) awarded Equatorial Guinea the rights to host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations tournament (AFCON), Alicante protested. \\"At a moment when Equatorial Guinea desperately needs to move from dictatorship to democracy and at a moment when we in Equatorial Guinea and beyond should be concerned with political and economic reforms that would transform the riches of our nations into sustainable economic development for all, it is unfortunate to see the CAF and other institutions acting in complicity with the government of Equatorial Guinea to entrench corruption and bad governance,\\" he said. =U.S. investigations= Although U.S. law prohibits foreign official found to be involved in corruption and their families from receiving visas, U.S. State Department officials told the New York Times in 2009 that Equatorial Guinea's close relationship with the American oil industry led to lax enforcement of the law in Teodorin's case. John Bennett, former U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea, stated that U.S. authorities had \\"turned a blind eye\\" to Obiang's corruption and repression because of its dependence on the country for natural resources.\\" Speaking in Congress on September 26, 2006, Senator Carl Levin blamed the failure of the U.S. to act thus far against flagrant official corruption in Equatorial Guinea on the U.S. oil industry's ties to that country's leaders. The U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) and Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations started to examine the finances of the Obiang family in 2004. The Senate committee found that Teodorin Obiang had utilized shell corporations to circumvent anti money- laundering laws to funnel more than $100 million into United States financial institutions and that Riggs Bank in Washington, D.C., had opened several accounts for Obiang and helped him sequester his wealth in offshore shell corporations. The bank was eventually fined for these actions and for similar dealings on behalf of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. The Senate committee concluded, moreover, that Riggs Bank had ignored evidence suggesting they had handled the proceeds of corrupt foreign practices. After the U.S. fined Riggs Bank for its dealings with Obiang, the bank was allowed to keep his account open, although the funds were transferred shortly thereafter to accounts in Banco Santander and other institutions in the name of Kalumga Company. In three civil cases, the first of which was filed in 2011, the U.S. Justice Department accused Teodorin, whose official annual salary is about $100,000, of buying a long list of expensive items with money stolen from Equatorial Guinea. A former employee of Teodorin's told investigators that Teodorin had a habit of travelling with Louis Vuitton rolling suitcases stuffed with sometimes $1 million in cash. In an October 2014 settlement, filed in a Los Angeles district court, Teodorin gave the U.S. government less than half of what it wanted, including his Malibu mansion, a Ferrari, and \\"six life-size Michael Jackson statues.\\" In exchange, he was permitted to keep his jet, a boat, and the rest of his collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia. The agency agreed not to look into Teodorin's \\"alleged removal of Michael Jackson memorabilia from the U.S. during the civil case.\\" Officials said the agreement with Teodorin showed that the justice department's Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative, under the auspices of which the probe into Teodorin had taken place, had become a key deterrent to foreign kleptocrats. \\"These cases do send a strong message that if you bring your assets into our country, if you buy real estate here, we will find them. We will take them,\\" said U.S. Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell, then head of the justice department's criminal division. The 2014 settlement did not affect Teodorin's ability to enter the U.S., which he continued to enjoy because of his diplomatic immunity. The DOJ investigation of the Obiang family also involved work by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and by Homeland Security Investigation's (HSI) Foreign Corruption Investigations Group (FCIG) and HSI Asset Identification and Removal Group in Miami. The probes involved work in Rome, Madrid, London, and Paris. The Teodorin action was the first ever initiated by the DOJ against a sitting official of a foreign government. =French investigations= In 2007, French police uncovered assets in the tens of millions belonging to the Obiang family, including several luxury cars owned by Teodorin worth a combined $6.3 million. In 2010, a French judge ruled that a related corruption case brought by human rights groups against the Obiangs, along with several other ruling African families, could proceed with investigations and hearings. The French government charged Teodorin with money-laundering and seized his massive, multi-million dollar Paris mansion and his fleet of luxury cars. On July 13, 2012, French authorities issued an arrest warrant for Teodorin, for failing to appear at a French money- laundering investigation to answer questions about his spending millions of dollars despite supposedly earning only a modest government salary. In September 2012, Equatorial Guinea sued France in the International Criminal Court after French police raided a Paris mansion owned by Teodorin and found luxury goods worth millions of Euros. The complaint called on the ICC to prohibit France from interfering in its internal affairs and to order France to stop legal action against its representatives. =Spanish investigations= In 2008, the Pro Human Rights Association of Spain filed a criminal complaint in that country against the government of Equatorial Guinea for money laundering, citing over $26 million in transfers of funds from Riggs Bank to Banco Santander in Madrid between 2000 and 2003. The complaint listed eleven people, including Obiang, his son Gabriel Nguema Lima, his daughter-in-law Virginia Esther Maye, his brother-in-law Teodoro Biyogo, Elena Mensa, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pastor Mincha, Mincha's wife, Magdalena Ayang, and former Minister of Mines Anastasio Ela. As of 2011, a Spanish court was investigating these charges of money laundering as well as the charge that the money had been used to buy luxury homes and chalets primarily in Madrid and the Canary Islands. =Italian investigations= Italian officials also stated that an Italian businessman who was in business with Teodorin Obiang had died in a plane crash in Equatorial Guinea that had suspicious circumstances. Whitewashing To counteract reporting about corruption in Equatorial Guinea, Obiang retains U.S. lobbyists and PR experts, notably Lanny Davis, former counsel to U.S. President Bill Clinton. As of 2011, Davis was earning $1 million a year from Obiang.

It is based on the novel with the same title by Grace Miller White and its adaptation for the stage by Rupert Hughes. The film was released on December 8, 1960, by 20th Century Fox. Plot The move starts with small rural town in. Pennsylvania where a feud simmers between farmer Fred Thorson and the Graveses, the Mennonite family who sold their mill to the Foley chemical company that is now contaminating the river with toxic wastes. Tess MacLean accompanied by her uncle Capt. Hamish MacLean arrives from Scotland to marry John Faulkner. Tragedy strikes when Tess arrives in Pennsylvania and is told that her fianc√©e is dead. This starts a series of events that are the main plot of the novel. Peter Graves a member of the town hurries to tell Tess that his family did not kill Faulkner, however Eric Thorson a member of the rival family and a close friend of John tells Tess that Peter's dad killed John. Tess also learns that John has left his farm to her, so she starts a new life on the farm. However, due to the poisoned water the farm starts dying. When one of the newborn calves dies from poisoning on Tess's farm, she lashes out at Peter telling him to close down the mill. Realizing that they can drive the mill out of business with a dam, Eric's father Fred petitions the Graves to build a dam, but they refuse because only the government can petition a dam. After all this the Graveses invite the MacLeans to dinner, where Tess comments on the strange Mennonite customs. However dinner comes to an end when Fred arrives and says his prize Angus steer has fallen ill and vows vengeance if the animal dies. Eric goes to ask Foley to shut down the mill, and when refused gets drunk. While drunk he kisses Tess who retaliates for he is being too forward. In a day after this Tess rides her bike to the river that crosses the Graveses land. When a bull attacks her Peter saves her. Tess kisses him and admits she respects him. After Fred's bull dies he and Captain McLean plot to blow up the plant. Tess arrives at the plant just after Fred plants the bomb and it explodes. The guards only seeing Tess thinks that she blew up the plant, but Peter helps her into a boat and accepts responsibility for blowing up the plant. After Peter is arrested, Tess visits him in prison and says he is the most wonderful man she knows and kisses him. Then Eric, Captain MacLean, and Foley arrive where Foley lies and says the exploded due to a faulty faulty steam boiler, freeing Peter. Once Freed Peter asks MacLean for Tess's hand in marriage, he consents but refuses to attend the wedding when he learns it will be held in a Mennonite church and Tess will like a life of a Mennonite wife.

He also produced two songs on 2Pac's album Me Against The World.  Biography  = Early career = Mo Bee began producing after hearing music by Ced Gee of Ultramagnetic MCs and Marley Marl, producer of early hip-hop hits for the likes of the Juice Crew and LL Cool J. His first production placement came on Big Daddy Kane's breakthrough album, It's a Big Daddy Thing, after which he was approached to work with another Cold Chillin' Records artist, The Genius‚Äîan early alias for now-Wu-Tang Clan co-founder GZA. Mo Bee produced the majority of the rapper's debut album, Words From the Genius, as well as produced \\"Sexcapades\\", a track that featured on the B-side of fellow future Wu-Tang co-founder RZA's first single, \\"Ooh I Love You Rakeem\\", which the rapper/producer released under the alias Prince Rakeem. Around that same time, Mo Bee had a group with neighborhood friends A.B. Money and J.R. called Rappin' Is Fundamental. The trio released only one album on A&M; Records in 1991: The Doo-Hop Legacy. Jazz pioneer Miles Davis approached the young producer to help fuse jazz and hip-hop. These sessions would become his last studio album, 1992's Doo-Bop. The project, released posthumously after Davis died during the recording process, leaving the project unfinished, garnered generally mixed reviews. = 1990s = Mo Bee first linked up with Sean Combs' Bad Boy Entertainment in 1993, when he produced the first single for Combs' up-and-coming artist, the Notorious B.I.G., \\"Party and Bullshit\\". Easy also went on to produce much of the label's two flagship releases: Project: Funk da World by Craig Mack, and Ready to Die by B.I.G. Additionally, Mo Bee produced the \\"Flava in Ya Ear (Remix),\\" a driving single for both projects, featuring Craig Mack, Biggie, Busta Rhymes, Rampage and LL Cool J. In 1994-'95, Mo Bee was also associated with 2Pac, having produced songs for both, including one called \\"Runnin' From tha Police,\\" featuring both Pac and B.I.G. as well as rapper/producer Stretch and 2Pac's crew Dramacydal. In addition to featuring 2Pac and B.I.G. on the same record, the song is notable for inventive production techniques he described in an interview with HipHopDX. \\"There‚Äôs a bassline in the original version. Go back and listen to that record. I played the bassline live all the way through that record from the SP-1200 through multi-pitch. It was like a bass guitar strumming, and if I messed up, it was like 'Yo bring it back, and plug me in.'\\" Mo Bee went on to produce two songs for Pac's 1995 album Me Against the World, although the two recorded several other songs that did not make the cut. During this time period, he also crafted moderate radio hits for the Lost Boyz (\\"Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz\\"); Das EFX (\\"Microphone Master\\"); and Busta Rhymes (\\"Everything Remains Raw\\"). = Later career = In 1997, Mo Bee produced for Biggie's double-disc album, Life After Death. The producer crafted two songs,I Love the Dough\\" and \\"Going Back to Cali\\"; these songs would mark the last time Easy would produce for Bad Boy. Over the next decade he would craft songs for Kurupt, Big Daddy Kane, Ras Kass, the Wu-Tang Clan, Mos Def, Black Rob, Sean Price, Wiz Khalifa and others, eventually winning a Grammy for his work with Alicia Keys on her album, The Diary of Alicia Keys. In 2000, he put out an album called Now or Never: Oddysey 2000, featuring East Coast staples Busta Rhymes, Raekwon, Prodigy, Smif-N-Wessun, Kool G Rap, and Sauce Money, along with Goodie Mob and Kurupt.

When asked by HitQuarters what inspired the remix he said: \\"I think all of us at one point want to hear Nas on something different.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop.

He was Mayor of Peoria, Arizona from June 1997 to January 2007. Keegan served as a commissioned officer in both the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy and held elected office in all three branches of government. While on the bench, he chaired the Professional Standards Committee and was an outspoken advocate for increased accountability of judges. Additionally, Judge Keegan was a juvenile hearing officer and actively involved in issues of underage drinking, truancy, and other youth offenses. Political career While he was mayor, Keegan initiated major changes to land use planning, environmental protection, cultural opportunities, and economic development in the city. During this time, the population of Peoria more than doubled and the city was consistently ranked as one of the fastest growing cities in the United States. To meet the need of explosive growth in Peoria, Keegan created the first public-private partnership to build a public charter school to increase classroom capacity. At his direction, Peoria instituted an ethics committee for elected officials as well as appointed officers. A program to confiscate illegal weapons on campuses initiated by Mayor Keegan led to reduced violence and increased safety in local schools. In 1999 he was given the Defender of Decency Award by Americans for Decency for his efforts to restrict sexually oriented businesses in the city. Of particular note was the creation of the Peoria Center for the Performing Arts and the Peoria Mountain Park Preserve. Property taxes were lowered four times. In 2005 and early 2006 Keegan was instrumental in raising over $400,000 in equipment, supplies, and cash to assist the City of Long Beach, Mississippi recover from Hurricane Katrina. Keegan led a successful regional effort of local governments and businesses to protect Luke Air Force Base from encroachment and potential closure through the Base Realignment and Closure or BRAC process by lobbying for state and federal legislation as well as local zoning protection for the base. His meetings with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, Governor of Arizona, White House staff and congressional leaders ultimately were successful. The Maricopa Association of Governments recognized Keegan in 2001 with the Desert Peaks Award for Distinguished Service for his commitment to regional cooperation. Keegan was instrumental in having the Challenger Center in Peoria, an aerospace and science education organization, officially designated as an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.; one of only two such designations in the state of Arizona. In 2005 he led a statewide effort to expand access to the Pentagon Channel for service members in Arizona. In 1991 to 1995, Keegan served two terms in the Arizona House of Representatives. He was appointed to fill a vacancy created by the Azscam ethics scandal. In the legislature, Keegan chaired the Criminal Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, was Vice Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and was the first Chairman of the Veterans and Military Affairs Committee. He was an active member of several state and local organizations dealing with juvenile crime and formed a collation of prosecutors, police agencies, and school officials to develop legislation and other solutions to the issue. As a member of the House government committee, he was a leading advocate for reform. In 1994 a political opponent accused him of campaign irregularities. No charges were ever brought, although he withdrew from the race for unrelated reasons. The officials charged with conducting the investigation into the allegations, Grant Woods, Arizona Attorney General, and Jane Dee Hull, Arizona Secretary of State and later governor, subsequently endorsed Keegan in his election for Mayor of Peoria. In 2002, he was a Republican candidate for the United States Congress from the second congressional district in Arizona. Senator John McCain was the chairman of Keegan's congressional campaign committee. In 1996 John Keegan was elected to the Maricopa County Charter Government Commission. The commission was an unsuccessful attempt to modernize the 19th century governance model for the county. Earlier career Professionally he was a consulting engineer and small business owner, and is the former president of the Arizona Society of Professional Engineers.

The common horizontal sundial is a geometric projection of an equatorial sundial onto a horizontal plane. The special properties of the polar-pointing gnomon (axial gnomon) were first known to the Moorish astronomer Abdul Hassan Ali in the early thirteenth century and this led the way to the dial-plates, with which we are familiar, dial plates where the style and hour lines have a common root. Through the centuries artisans have used different methods to markup the hour lines sundials using the methods that were familiar to them, in addition the topic has fascinated mathematicians and become a topic of study. Graphical projection was once commonly taught, though this has been superseded by trigonometry, logarithms, sliderules and computers which made arithmetical calculations increasingly trivial/ Graphical projection was once the mainstream method for laying out a sundial but has been sidelined and is now only of academic interest. The first known document in English describing a schema for graphical projection was published in Scotland in 1440, leading to a series of distinct schema for horizontal dials each with characteristics that suited the target latitude and construction method of the time. Context Umayyad Mosque, also known as the Grand Mosque of Damascus The art of sundial design is to produce a dial that accurately displays local time. Sundial designers have also been fascinated by the mathematics of the dial and possible new ways of displaying the information. Modern dialling started in the tenth century when Arab astronomers made the great discovery that a gnomon parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines show equal hours or legal hours on any day of the year: the dial of Ibn al-Shatir in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus is the oldest dial of this type. Dials of this type appeared in Austria and Germany in the 1440s. A dial plate can be laid out, by a pragmatic approach, observing and marking a shadow at regular intervals throughout the day on each day of the year. If the latitude is known the dial plate can be laid out using geometrical construction techniques which rely on projection geometry, or by calculation using the known formulas and trigonometric tables usually using logarithms, or slide rules or more recently computers or mobile phones. Linear algebra has provided a useful language to describe the transformations. A sundial schema uses a compass and a straight edge to firstly to derive the essential angles for that latitude, then to use this to draw the hourlines on the dial plate. In modern terminology this would mean that graphical techniques were used to derive \\\\sin x and m\\\\tan y and from it \\\\sin x .\\\\tan y . =Basic calculation= *Using a large sheet of paper. *Starting at the bottom a horizontal line is drawn, and a vertical one up the centre. Where they cross is becomes the origin O, the foot of the Gnomon. *A horizontal line draw a line which fixes the size of the dial.

His description relies heavily on the term line of chords, for which a modern diallist substitutes a protractor. The line of chords was a scale found on the sector which was used in conjunction with a set of dividers or compasses. It was still used by navigators up to the end of the 19th century. *Draw a circle, and its two cardinal diameters: E‚ÄìW, and S‚ÄìN (top to bottom). O is their crossing point or origin. *Using a scale of chords or protractor, lay off two lines, \\"0a\\" that is 52¬∞ from OS, and \\"0b\\" that is 52¬∞ from OW. (they will be at right angles. The points \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" are important. *With a straight edge draw a line connect E with \\"a\\", it cuts SN (the meridian line) at P, which is called the pole of the world. Now connect E to \\"a\\", it connects AE. This point is important as it is where the meridian crosses the equinoctial circle. The points E, AE, and W lie on the equinoctial circle. The next task is to use this information to locate the centre and to draw the circle. Use a construction line to join AE and W. At the centre point, raise a line at right angles. Where it cuts the SN (the meridian) will be C, the centre of the equinoctial circle. Use C to draw an arc from E to W, it will pass through AE. * There is now a semicircle passing through E and W, and the equinoctial arc passing through E and W. Divide the semicircle into 12 equal parts, i.e. 15¬∞ angles. Mark with a \\"construction point\\". * A ruler joins O with the points on the semicircle. These lines cut the equinoctial arc: a series of unequal points (\\"markers) are created. * A ruler from P (the pole of the world) takes a line from these markers back over the semicircle. Where it cuts it will be the \\"hour point\\"; these hour points are unequally spaced. * The hour lines are drawn from each of these \\"hour points\\" to O the origin.

It was copied by School World in Jun 1903, then in Kenneth Lynch's, Sundial and Spheres 1971. It starts by drawing the well known triangle, and takes the vertices to draw two circles at radius (OB) sin œÜ and (AB) tan œÜ. The 15¬∞ lines are drawn, intersecting these circles. Lines are taken horizontally, and vertically from these circles and their intersection point (OB sin t,AB cos t) is on the hour line. That is tan Œ∫ = OB sin t/ AB cos t which resolves to sin œÜ. tan t. *Draw the NS line, and the EW line crossing at the origin O. At a convenient point in the first quadrant join the axes with a line set at the target angle. This forms the basic triangle OAB. *Set the compasses at length OB and inscribe a circle.

Lee took the ideas and created a straight white male character that fit the workshop's description: this became the character of Matt in the finished play.

Reception The Broadway production received mixed-to-positive reviews from New York theater critics. The main source of criticism was that the piece was not as confrontational as Lee's other works, with The New Yorker critic Hilton Als writing \\"not only does it not exhibit any of the humor, recklessness, and passion of Lee's previous work; it refutes those things.\\" Others praised it on the basis of the same reasoning, with Matthew Wexler writing for The Broadway Blog that Lee intentionally makes the production \\"a calculated portrait.\\" Jesse Green, writing for The New York Times, compared the Broadway production under Shapiro's direction unfavorably to the 2014 production at the Public directed by Lee herself. Green noted that the Off-Broadway production \\"was shaggier and, paradoxically, more coherent,\\" but overall received the play positively and concluded that the play \\"is still an exceedingly odd ‚Äî and thus welcome ‚Äî presence on Broadway.

From 1910 to 1914, Abbott was vice-president of the Linnaean Society of New York, and from 1918 to 1921 worked as secretary and editor for the New York State Conservation Commission. In 1921, Abbott took charge of public education programs at the San Diego Natural History Museum, becoming director of the museum in 1922. He served as the President of the San Diego Natural History Society from 1923 to 1925. Abbott was director of the museum from 1922 to 1946. Under Abbott's leadership, the museum expanded its research and conservation work, education, and public programming, and in 1932, the museum moved into its current building, designed by noted San Diego architect William Templeton Johnson. In 1927, Abbott proposed the creation of a conservation area in the Borrego Palm Canyon and Thousand Palms Canyon areas east of San Diego; in 1933, BoregoThe double-r spelling was made official by a decision of the United States Board of Geographical Names in 1950. See Brigandi. Palms Desert State Park was created, a 185,000-acre beginning for what would become the 600,000 acre Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Abbott proposed the establishment of a state park in the Borrego Valley. (Flowering Ocotillo Fouquieria splendens photographed above Hawk Canyon at Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, California) Abbott was a member of the American Ornithologists Union, the Western Society of Naturalists, the Cooper Ornithological Society, the National Audubon Society, the International Committee for Wildlife Protection, the American Society of Mammalogists, and many other professional societies.

It is a member of the International Cycling Union and African Cycling Federation. Cycling Federation of Nigeria is the body empowered by the Federal Government of Nigeria to govern and promote Cycling sport in Nigeria. Cycling as an organized sporting activity started back in Nigeria since 1972 and has grown over the years to a popular promotional and award-winning sport. Meanwhile, all the Cycling Associations in Nigeria are affiliated to the Cycling Federation of Nigeria. Cycling is one of the oldest sporting events in Nigeria. Before then, the sport was for leisure, recreation and to keep fit (physical fitness). The national governing body was made up of members nominated and approved from parts of the regions. Cycling is one of the most expensive sports due to cost of equipment and parts which are imported from developed and industrialized countries like Europe, America and Asia. The cost effect, make it difficult for many people or clubs to be involved or procure the special bicycle and outfits. In the early 70s, the governing body of the sport was known as Nigeria Amateur Cycling Association. This body over ruled and regulated other bodies formed in then four (4) regions in Nigeria namely: Northern, Western, Mid Western and Eastern regions. It was introduced into the country as far back as the early days of colonialism. The ownership and use of bicycle by some privileged African then was indeed a mark of arrival. It was prestigious to own a bicycle in those days. The first coaching course took place in Kaduna at the Northern part of Nigeria. The second was at Ibadan, and then the third was at the University of Ife, from 19 August to September, 1976. Cycling competition was first organized in Nigeria on 18 ‚Äì 24 November 1973. The first Cycling Club in Nigeria known as ‚Äú Armstong Cycling Club‚Äù was formed in Lagos in 1956 with Pa Sobayo as the founder and first Chairman. Other prominent members of the club then were Rev. Father Slattery, Chief Kunle Oyero and Prince T. O. Alade. A reliable source has it that the first President of Nigeria Hon. Nnamdi Azikwe was the patron of the Club. In 1962, a group of enthusiastic young men, like J. J Umoh, S. S Bassey, O. O Adeke and U. U Samuel joined the club as cyclists. The first known modern cycling race in Nigeria was organized by ‚ÄúRaleigh‚Äù and it was held in Lagos in 1962. The race was won by of the pioneer cyclist J. J Umoh, information has it that the race was a distance of 20 miles. After the creation of States from the then four regions, each State formed their Cycling Associations known as State Amateur Cycling Association. This body became the governing board to oversee the development of cycling. The state associations are overruled by the Nigeria Amateur cycling Association, which became known as Cycling Federation of Nigeria today. Nigeria Cycling participated for the first time in the African Continental Championship that was held in Sharm-El-Sheik in Egypt in 2013 and won a Silver medal in the Elite Women Team Time Trial.

The island, only two acres in area, had been uninhabited for many years and was considered to be haunted. Goodall came to be regarded as a local Robinson Crusoe in Singapore, however when his story spread through the international press he became known as 'the ruler of the world's tiniest kingdom'.  Early life  William Arthur Bates Goodall was born in Eccles, Manchester in 1880 and was brought up there and in Bedford where he attended Bedford Modern School.H. E. Vipan, A Register of the Old Boys of the Bedford Modern School (Bedford, no date), p. 47 At the age of 16 he enlisted as a private in the First Battalion, the Manchester Regiment, and fought in the Second Boer War for which he was awarded the King's South Africa Medal and the Queen's South Africa Medal with 5 clasps. Goodall was present at the Defence of Ladysmith and later recalled that when the siege was finally broken by the British under Sir Redvers Buller, he 'sat down and wept for joy' when he was offered a cigarette by one of the relieving soldiers.  Civilian Life  The Regiment was drafted to Singapore in 1903 at which point Goodall, who didn't like the prospect of 'soldiering in the East', embarked on a civilian career. He spent some time in Sumatra and tried his hand at tin mining and tea planting. He secured a position with the Singapore Municipal Commissioners in the Water Department and was engaged on the construction of the Pierce, Gunong Pulai and Pontian reservoirs. He was also credited with the discovery of the Sembawang Hot Springs.  Pulau Serimbun  Goodall had been visiting Pulau Serimbun since the 1920s and had spent increasing amounts of his spare time there. When the contracts on the Singapore Reservoirs ended in 1932, he decided to live there permanently. He described the attractions of life as a castaway: 'Being a Robinson Crusoe is a delightfully peaceful existence for those who are not wedded to the pictures, the club, the hotel bar or a bevy of friends and acquaintances and for those who love nature'. He lived alone on Pulau Serimbun until 1935 before succumbing to loneliness and the rigours of maintaining the island. He engaged a Chinese employee to help him in practical and clerical matters and he was followed by other helpers, a Javanese and another Chinese. His story was given an added dimension by a Fleet Street journalist, H. Harvey-Day, who provided a few embellishments: 'Should you happen to sail past Pulau Serimbun at sunset-a most unlikely occurrence, as it is off the beaten track-the musical notes of a Boer bugle will float over the waves, and the Union Jack together with a mysterious ensign being a white horse impressed on dark azure background, will flutter slowly to the ground. Perhaps you will have the good fortune to observe Mr W.A.B. Goodall erectly saluting during this evening rite, for the island is his private kingdom...There he hopes to live peacefully to the end, ruling his four subjects, who are also his friends-a Chinese educated at Cambridge, two Chinese servants and a Malay boatman'. The story appeared in the London Evening News and was picked up by other newspapers across the globe, leading to a spate of letters to Goodall from New Zealand, Germany, Britain and the United States. 'Talking of correspondence reminds me of some very interesting letters which began to arrive in August last, addressed to Coral island in seas west of Singapore. These letters were of a direct consequence of a long and very inaccurate account of my life on the island which appeared without my knowledge in the Evening News, London. Some of my correspondents seemed to think we lived behind a stockade and spent our time beating off the attacks of savages. They exhorted me 'to keep the flag flying' and so on'. Goodall, whilst seemingly not adverse to the attention, was dismayed by some of the inaccuracies. He did, however, seem to accept a measure of jurisdiction: 'I've been dubbed the laird of Serimbun by the press, and as I'm the only authority on the island, with a staff of two Chinese and one Javanese, I suppose the title is a good one'.  Goodall and Singapore  Despite his geographical isolation William Goodall seems to have played a full part in the social life of Singapore. He corresponded regularly with Straits Times in matters relating to the natural history of Serimbun. He once picked up a Kapal Hantu, a Malayan 'Ghost Ship', which he donated to the Raffles Museum. The Manchester Regiment continued to be stationed at Singapore and Goodall was always a prominent figure in the annual commemorations of Ladysmith. He appears to have been an excellent raconteur and he travelled to Singapore to give Radio talks, for example about his life on the island, 'An Amateur Robinson Crusoe', and once gave a broadcast of his reminiscences about the attack of SMS Emden during the Battle of Penang at which he had been an eye-witness. William Arthur Bates Goodall died at the Johore Bahru Hospital in 1941 aged 61.

Picard currently trains under the tutelage of her coach Sylvain Cadieux at the Montreal Archery Club (). Picard became involved in the sport as an eight-year-old pupil at a summer camp in Montreal. She desired to represent the Canadian national team upon watching the Olympic archery on television from Athens 2004, which eventually impelled her to compete in various local and regional tournaments across the nation. Picard's maiden appearance on the Canadian team came as a seventeen- year-old teen at the 2008 World Youth Championships in Antalya, Turkey, where she finished a credible eighteenth in the individual recurve. Following two more editions of the same tournament under the youth level in 2009 and 2011 respectively, Picard seized her opportunity to compete as a member of Canada's senior national team for the first timeat the 2013 World Championships, which were held in the same location as her youth debut. The 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto, Ontario gave Picard a chance to prove her credentials on both the world and continental stage, comfortably notching a top ten placement each in both the individual and team archery recurve, respectively. Leading up to her Olympic debut in Rio de Janeiro, Picard captured a bronze medal at the 2016 American Continental Qualifying Tournament in Medellin, Colombia to hand the Canadians a coveted spot for the Games. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, Picard was selected to compete as a lone female archer for the Canadian squad, shooting only in the individual recurve tournament.

Life  Leutwiler attended the conservatory in Zurich from 1936 to 1944 and received his teaching diploma in violin and piano at the age of 19. He had great international success as a composer and as an arranger for soloists and orchestras. He was at the peak of his professional career in the 1960s. Between 1945 and 1975 he composed and arranged around 2,000 compositions and arrangements, especially for symphonic light music, inspired also by jazz, which had brought the American occupation troops to Europe at that time. Music His music carries the distinctive style of music that was typical of other mid-century composers like Leroy Anderson. Much of it is also marked by virtuosity in the violin parts. These instances of virtuoso passages are very apparent in his compositions Bristol Cream, Happy Time, and Galop on Strings. A typical piece by him follows the ABA format, with two fast sections at the outer parts of the piece that are almost identical to each other and a slow, lyrical theme in the middle. The slow themes contrast very much with its passionate lyricism to the light and frivolous faster sections. The Water Skiing movement from his Summer Suite displays this very clearly. His background as a violinist is extremely noticeable in his works. The violin parts take the melody almost all of the time while the rest of the orchestra simply just accompanies that section.

The barriers that 33.7 million persons with disabilities face within the American electoral process include access to polling information, physical access to polls, current and future laws that deal with the topic, and the moral implications regarding the varying levels of both physical and cognitive disabilities and the act of voting. Denotation and categorization The term \\"disability\\" has a wide range of connotations and associations. Webster's Dictionary defines it as: The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as: The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission further explores the characterization of \\"disability\\" within its Guidance outlines. The Commission outlines three ways in which an individual can demonstrate their disability: #\\"A person may be disabled if he or she has a physical or mental condition that substantially limits a major life activity (such as walking, talking, seeing, hearing, or learning).\\" #\\"A person may be disabled if he or she has a history of a disability (such as cancer that is in remission).\\" #\\"A person may be disabled if he is believed to have a physical or mental impairment that is not transitory (lasting or expected to last six months or less) and minor (even if he does not have such an impairment).\\" Originally signed into law in 1990 and since amended in 2004, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) set a significant precedent in categorizing disability. IDEA outlined 13 distinct categories of disabilities. Though the categories apply under law to individuals between the ages of 3 and 21, they have served as one of the few examples of the federalization of disability categorizations. They include: #Autism #Deaf- Blindness #Deafness #Emotional Disturbance #Hearing Impairment #Intellectual Disability #Multiple Disabilities #Orthopedic Impairment #Other Health Impairment #Specific Learning Disability #Speech or Language Impairment #Traumatic Brain Injury #Visual Impairment (Including Blindness) Political engagement Multiple sources report that persons with disabilities comprise one of the most disenfranchised groups within American society. As a result, Americans with both physical and cognitive disabilities are amongst the least politically engaged members of the electorate. For example, during the 2012 election cycle, 11% fewer persons with disabilities turned out to vote than their nondisabled counterparts. According to a 2013 report penned by Rutgers University professor Lisa Schur, as many as three million more citizens with disabilities would have turned out to vote had they voted at the same rate as non-disabled citizens. Accessibility to polls Voter identification laws greatly impact accessibility to polls for persons with disabilities. As the largest population of citizens without drivers licenses, persons with both physical and cognitive disabilities face the obstacle of strict identification laws at polling places within some states. Within stricter states, many disabled persons who do not have physical identification cards are required to submit absentee ballots. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) provides a web page with ID requirements for voting in each state, and those with the strictest requirements often present the largest challenges to disabled Americans. thumb400px A leading theory that attempts to explain the lack of political engagement within disabled communities deals primarily with access to polling places. In fact, many polling places are considered to be nearly entirely inaccessible to persons with disabilities. To this end, within the past several years, the Federal Election Commission has reported that more than 20,000 polling places across the nation are not fully accessible for disabled individuals, and in 1999, the New York Attorney General fewer than 10% of upstate polling facilities were fully compliant with state and federal laws. The failure to comply with state and federal laws can manifest itself in many ways, but it typically results in a lack of functional wheelchair ramps, sparse placement of handicapped entrance signs, and generally inaccessible physical voting booths. As a result, resources and physical aides such as \\"Help America Vote Act\\"-mandated voting machines are utilized for federal elections and aim to assist persons with disabilities. One of the most popularly utilized methods of combatting these problems in recent years has manifested itself in the utilization of electronic voting machines. Because \\"punch card\\" and \\"lever\\" voting machines are often inaccessible to many parts of the disabled community, adaptive technology has been applied to many traditional devices, and many different kinds of accessible machines have been developed. Legislation like the Help America Vote Act has required that at least one accessible machine be available at each polling place. This voter with a manual dexterity disability is making choices on a touchscreen with a head dauber. This is an example of adaptive technology in use. Contemporary laws protecting suffrage for people with disabilities Both state and federal legislatures have enacted thousands of pages of legislation regarding the rights of Americans with disabilities. Several major \\"landmark\\" pieces of legislation have served as models. = Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act = #Passed into law in 1984, the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act requires polling places to ensure accessibility for all disabled persons during federal elections. = Americans with Disabilities Act = Passed into law in 1990, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or \\"ADA\\") is widely considered to be the first major attempt to define the rights of disabled Americans at a federal level. Signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, the act prohibits discrimination based on disability. Though the ADA is wide-ranging in scope, it has had many lasting effects on the suffrage of disabled Americans. Some of the most prominent changes that resulted from the legislation included calls for accessibility within polling stations. This effort to increase accessibility has led to the establishment of mandatory accessible parking, passenger drop off areas, and building entrances at polling places. = Help America Vote Act = Passed into law in 2002, the Help America Vote Act (\\"HAVA\\") creates \\"mandatory minimum standards for states to follow in several key areas of election administration.\\" Passing both federal legislatures with bipartisan support, the Act authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make polling places accessible to persons with disabilities. The legislation has a particularly sharp focus on individuals affected by visual impairments, and requires each polling station to have to at least one disability-accessible voting machine per federal election. The Act has three main goals: #Replace punch-card and lever based voting systems #Establish the Election Assistance Commission in order to assist with the administration of federal elections #Establish minimum federal election standards Critics of the Act claim that its reach should be expanded to more than solely federal elections. While states receive funding for disability-accessible touchscreen electronic voting machines under HAVA, municipalities such as cities and towns do not directly receive funding. As a result, critics claim that the machines are not evenly distributed. = National Voter Registration Act = Passed into law in 1993, the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 attempted to increase the historically low registration rates of minorities and persons with disabilities by requiring both federal and state agencies to assist in voter registration procedures. = Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act = Passed into law in 1980, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act protects the rights of persons in jails, publicly operated nursing homes, and institutions for people with psychiatric or developmental disabilities. = Voting Rights Act = Originally passed into law in 1965 to combat racial discrimination at polling places, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has recently supported advances of disabled suffrage. Section 208 of the Act allows citizens affected by \\"blindness, disability, or the inability to read or write\\" to assign an individual to help cast votes within a ballot box. Restrictions on the assignment of said individual include the voter's employer or agent of their union. Contemporary laws restricting suffrage for people with disabilities In some states, people who are deemed mentally incompetent are not allowed to vote. In the conservatorship process, people can lose their right to vote.

Career  Wu was selected to compete for the Chinese squad at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, shooting in both individual and team recurve tournaments. She opened the tournament by discharging 653 points, 15 perfect tens, and 10 bull's eyes to lead the Chinese women for the sixth seed heading to the knockout draw from the classification round, along with her trio's cumulative score of 1,933. In the women's team recurve, Wu and her compatriots Cao Hui and Qi Yuhong directly advanced to the quarterfinals as the third-seeded squad, but they were eliminated early by the Italian women in a shocking 3‚Äì5 match. Rebounding from the trio's quarterfinal exit, Wu successfully reached the top eight of the women's individual recurve by defeating Japan's Yuki Hayashi (7‚Äì1), Moldova's Alexandra M√Ærca (6‚Äì0), and her teammate Qi through a tight shoot-off.

Education Porfiri earned his Ph.D. in engineering mechanics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He also holds a Ph.D. in theoretical and applied mechanics from Sapienza University of Rome and the University of Toulon. Career & awards Porfiri is a professor at New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering in the mechanical and aerospace engineering department. He is founder and director of the Dynamical Systems Laboratory which conducts research of modeling and control of complex dynamical systems with a developed expertise in biomimetics and underwater applications. In 2008, Porfiri won the NSF Career Award for dynamical systems. Popular Science listed Porfiri in their Brilliant 10 in 2010. In 2013, he was named the ASME Dynamic Systems and Controls Division Outstanding Young Investigator for his contributions to biomimetic underwater robotics and collective dynamics of networked dynamical systems. He earned the ASME Gary Anderson Early Achievement Award that same year. In 2015, he won the ASME C.D. Mote, Jr. Early Career Award. Research In 2012, Porfiri used robotic rovers to explore the Gowanus Canal in an attempt to learn how the toxic water affects wildlife. The research was funded by the National Science Foundation(NSF). Porfiri and his team at the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering have designed bio-inspired robotic fish to determine whether they could act as leaders to real fish. The robotic models provide predictable, controllable stimuli alongside live animals which is repeatable and consistent. Porfiri has shown that the tail movement of a robotic fish can influence whether or not a zebrafish will accept the robot as a leader. A school of Golden shiner followed the robotic fish in school-like positions in a water tunnel experiment, even though the robot is bigger than the fish and not the same color. The goal is to lead live fish away from dangerous areas including oil or chemical spill and natural disasters. The research was funded by a NSF Faculty Early Career Development award. Porfiri has conducted experiments with robotic replicas which evoke fear responses in zebrafish, and worked with the connection between alcohol and social behavior, finding that alcohol reduces fear in zebrafish. He led a team from both the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign which found that female killifish prefer males with yellow fins. In 2015, Porfiri's research in the directional information flow underlying collective animal behavior will be paired with education and outreach activities in Brooklyn public schools through the STEM program.

Today he is probably most known as co-author of the three-volume book set Modern Opera Houses and Theatres. Life He was born in London the son of G. Sachs, a German. He studied mechanical engineering at University College, London. He then went to Germany to study architecture, qualifying in 1892. During his time in Berlin he worked with the Berlin Royal Fire Brigade and developed a life-long interest in fire prevention. He did further work with both the Vienna fire service and Paris fire service. On his return to Britain he served as vice president of the National Fire Brigades Union and founded the British Fire Prevention Committee. In 1898 he installed electric lifts in the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1900 and 1901 he famously oversaw the reconstruction of the Royal Opera House in London. In 1904 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Thomas Ernest Gatehouse, Boverton Redwood, Sir William Thomson, Lord Kelvin and Andrew Gray.

History After fleeing to Hong Kong as an underground church pastor and a former student leader at Tiananmen Square, Bob Fu escaped to America with his wife, and founded China Aid in 2002 from his new home in Philadelphia. The organization's headquarters were relocated to Midland, Texas, in 2004. Fu believed Midland would be \\"much safer\\" after he found Chinese agents tailing him in Philadelphia. Since 2002, China Aid has been involved in initiatives and campaigns on behalf of human rights advocates and religious freedom groups in China, often leading appeals or campaigns to gain international support on behalf of Chinese nationals. China Aid also maintains the ongoing China 18 initiative to raise awareness for Chinese prisoners of conscience. Each year, China Aid publishes an Annual Persecution report in both Chinese and English. According to Bob Fu, the China Aid Association aims to \\"spiritually and legally [equip]\\" Chinese people \\"to defend their faith and freedom\\", with legal reforms ultimately \\"softening the soil for the Gospel\\" in China. The organization's 2010 tax listing lists its purpose as raising funds to pay the legal funds of indicted Christians in China. The foundation funds house churches in China which dissent from the official Protestant and Catholic churches of China. To this end, it publishes a house church magazine with a distribution of 80,000 in China. It also provides money, training, and pen pal programs to Chinese religious leaders and their families. As a matter of policy, it opposes forced abortions and compulsory sterilizations. In 2010, China Aid received $1.28 million in contributions and grants and $84,741 in other funds. Their staff consisted of 15 paid employees and 40 volunteers. Two years later in 2012, China Aid had a budget of $1.5 million; offices in Midland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles; and a full-time staff of \\"dozens\\" in China and more than six in America. The organization runs an annual China Aid gala at the Midland Country Club, which raised $400,000 in 2012. Most of the money comes from Midland oil and gas industry donors; in relative terms, China Aid does not receive much support from the Chinese American community. The oil town was the childhood home of George W. Bush and houses many evangelical pressure groups that advocate on behalf of Christians in non-Christian countries like North Korea. Many residents are on the board of China Aid. The human rights lawyer Li Baiguang died in February 2018. In 2019, China Aid, represented by Bob Fu, received the Democracy Award for its role as an international non-profit Christian human rights organization committed to promoting religious freedom and the rule of law in China. Organization and philosophy China Aid keeps an in-house staff of five to ten at their Midland location, connecting with a network of volunteers across China. According to the ECFA, the organization reported total revenue of $1,426,028, with $1,411,410 coming from donations in 2013. Expenses that year were $1,493,194. China Aid offers financial and legal support for house church pastors, political dissidents, and prisoners of conscience. Most of China Aid's donations come from oil and gas industry philanthropists. Other donations come from local churches or other Christian ministries. China Aid currently partners with various other ministries and human rights groups, such as National Endowment for Democracy, Freedom House, The Voice of the Martyrs, Christian Solidarity Worldwide, Release International, and International Christian Concern. According to the organization's website, China Aid's mission is threefold: to \\"expose, encourage, and equip.\\" The news and reporting side of China Aid's operations seek to \\"expose the abuses\\" and reveal persecution and human rights abuses to raise awareness of injustices perpetuated in China. Financial contributions and support for individuals and groups who have been targeted \\"encourages the abused.\\" Finally, China Aid organizes training in leadership and rule of law for organizations in China to \\"equip the leaders.\\" Initiatives = China 18 = The China 18 are a diverse group of prisoners of conscience supported by a China Aid-led coalition. The members of the group include human rights lawyers, Tibetans, Uyghurs, political activists, and underground church leaders. The China 18 campaign is intended to raise awareness for the situations of these individuals and their families, to represent thousands of others in similar situations, and to press for their release. The 18-person roster is updated to reflect new cases as members are freed or deceased. As of September 2015, the 18 cases of the China 18 were Wang Bingzhang, Peng Ming, Liu Ping, Liu Xiaobo, Zhu Yufu, Liu Xianbin, Yang Tianshui, Yang Rongli, Guo Quan, Guo Feixiong, Tang Jingling, Li Chang, Alimujiang Yimiti, Gulmira Imin, Khenpo Karma Tsewang, Gao Yu, Zhang Shaojie. Previous members of the China 18 who have been released are Lobsang Tsering, Chen Kegui, Wang Zhiwen, Gao Zhisheng, and Dhondup Wangchen. As of September 2015, only one previous member has died while still in prison, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche. = Free Gao = In 2009, China Aid headed a campaign to free former China 18 member Gao Zhisheng, including a petition to the United States Senate, then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and the Chinese embassy which received over 50,000 signatures. Gao was freed in August 2014, but was moved into house arrest and remains in poor health from his imprisonment. = Advocacy Events = China Aid leads advocacy efforts to promote awareness and garner support for cases and issues, often partnering with other human rights or China-focused NGOs. Often these efforts include drawing up petitions, writing open letters to important government officials, or hosting events. Frequent partners include other ministries and human rights groups, such as, Freedom House, Reporters Without Borders, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, International Campaign for Tibet, and Uyghur Human Rights Project. = Chen Guangcheng = In 2012, China Aid was instrumental in gaining asylum in the US for dissident lawyer Chen Guangcheng after his research discovered 130,000 forced abortions in Shandong. The organization helped him flee house arrest and escape to the American Embassy in Beijing. With additional help from China Aid, he was able to escape to New York on a student visa. China Aid was often the first to release news and updates on Chen's condition and situation throughout his escape and relocation.

He is best known for historical scenes from the Risorgimento.  Biography  His father was a stonemason of Italian origin, working in Switzerland. In 1820, his family moved to accept work in Odessa.Brief biography @ the Carlo Bossoni website (in Russian) Until 1826, he studied with the Capuchins. After graduating, he worked in a shop that sold antiquarian books and prints. It was there that he began to draw and sketch. In 1828, he was hired by the Odessa Opera to work as an assistant to Rinaldo Nannini (?-?), a stage designer who had studied at La Scala under Alessandro Sanquirico. He began to sell his paintings in 1833. His father died three years later and he found himself the sole support of his mother, his sister and her illegitimate son. King Victor Emanuel II and Camillo Cavour at the opening of the \\"Senato Subalpino\\". (1853) Luckily, his work drew the attention of Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, who commissioned him to paint several views of Odessa. Princess Elizabeta was impressed with his abilities and arranged for him to study in Italy from 1839 to 1840. He stayed mostly in Naples and Rome, giving special attention to tempera and gouache and associating with the many British artists who were living there. He returned in 1840 and settled in the coastal resort of Alupka, on the Vorontsov estate. In 1844, at the request of his mother (who was ill), he moved to Milan and opened a studio there. In 1848, he produced popular scenes from \\"Five Days of Milan\\". His mother died the following year, but he remained there until 1853, when an unsuccessful uprising against the Austrians forced him to flee to Turin, which he used as his base of operations for travels to England, France, Spain, Morocco, Germany and Scandinavia. During those years, he produced an album of paintings, showing views of Crimea, which was published in London by Day & Son. It proved to be very popular due to public interest in the Crimean War. Later, in 1859, they commissioned him to produce a series of lithographs depicting the Second Italian War of Independence which were published as \\"The War in Italy\\". After seeing them, young Prince Oddone gave him a commission to follow the Piedmontese Army and make a record of its campaigns. The result was an album of 150 tempera paintings and the Prince declared him to be \\"the painter of our history\\". He fell ill with a fever at this time and his productivity declined dramatically. He divided his time between decorating his home to resemble the Vorontsov Palace and doting on his nephew. In 1883, at the age of sixty-eight, he married Adelaide De Carolis, who was only twenty-one; The marriage was generally believed to be a financial arrangement. The following year, he died of a heart attack. He was buried in Lugano and a street in Turin is named after him.

It was formed by friends while attending the University of New Hampshire in 2007. They have recorded one album, one EP, a split EP with current record labelmates The Digs, and have appeared on two compilations from a small Pennsylvania record label and promotion company, Hateful Notebook. AMR has opened for such national touring acts as The Flatliners, The Atom Age, Badfish, Paranoid Social Club, Michale Graves, Mustard Plug, Mephiskapheles, The Slackers, The Planet Smashers, The Bruce Lee Band, and more. Over the years, the band has developed a following in eastern New England. History A Minor Revolution started when Zack Sprague and Pat Flood (drums and guitar, respectively) met while attending UNH in Durham, New Hampshire. They started jamming with Ryan Lovlien as a secondary guitar player, and Keith Patterson on bass. They were originally called The Pounding 40's until they started writing original music. Looking for a name that would be more serious, and reflect their message, they came up with A Minor Revolution, which they claim has numerous meanings. Patterson was replaced by their current bassist, A.J. Valcourt, in 2010. Occasionally, mutual friend and guitar tech Jameson Savage will fill in on bass. Their first album, AMRica, was self-released in 2012. After recording the album once through, they were unhappy with the finished product. So they returned to the studio to re-record the entire album. At about this same time Flood left the band, but was not replaced by an additional guitar player. Instead, the band added tenor saxophone player Matt Smith. In 2012, an alto sax was added to the horn section by Christopher \\"Luthor\\" Miranda. Their next recording endeavor was an EP entitled Consexual Sense, released in 2014 on an independent Boston record label, Ocelot Records. This CD reflected the band's change in musical direction to ska-punk. In June of that year, the band went on a tour of the Northeast to support the EP. Dylan Morrissette substituted for Sprague on drums for the duration of this tour. Smith parted ways with the band shortly after this, and was replaced for a short time by Andrew Riordan. In 2014, band toured the West Coast to gain exposure out there. Later that year, they released a split EP with their label mates The Digs, called Worst Human Being on the Planet. Their contribution included a re-recording of an earlier song (now with horns), and one new song. Members =Current members= * Ryan Lovlien (aka Ryan Revvolution) (guitar, lead vocals) * A.J.

Early life The architect and builder Charles Kirk was born on 10 March 1791 at Wigston Magna, Leicestershire. The Kirk family had long been connected with the building trade and Charles' father, William (1749-1823), was a builder and architect in Leicester.Colvin H. (1995), A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840. Yale University Press, 3rd edition London, 589 Career Charles Kirk came to Sleaford in 1829 to undertake the building of the new Sessions House at Sleaford which had been designed by the London architect H E KendallBrock D (1984), \\"The Competition for‚Ä¶ The Sleaford Sessions House\\" Architectural History, Vol 27 and when the work was completed he decided to stay in Sleaford. In the years that followed, Kirk's building business and architectural practice flourished and he was involved in the construction or planning of many of Sleaford's new buildings, including Carre's Hospital, Carre's Grammar School (1834) and the Gasworks (1838). He formed a partnership with Thomas Parry, who had been an articled clerk with Kirk's firm. In 1841, Parry married Charles Kirk's daughter, Henrietta. Following Charles Kirk's death in 1847, the firm was taken over by his son, also called Charles in partnership with Parry. The business continued to prosper and Kirk and Parry established a countrywide reputation for their railway buildings and church restorations. Kirk was buried at Quarrington near Sleaford.\\"Antram\\" (1989), pg. 605 =Account book and journal= Fortunately Kirk‚Äôs journal and account book have survived and are now held by the Lincolnshire Archives Office.Reference Name MISC DON 1015 The journal covers the period 1828-32. A particularly interesting entry is 30 October 1828: \\"At Sleaford and Lincoln. I was very much pleased with Smirk's [sic] County hall. There is an ancient grandeur about this modern edifice\\". This entry shows the great influence that Robert Smirke‚Äôs Gothic revival County Hall in Lincoln Castle had on Kirk. The Gothic revival was a style which Kirk was to adopt, very successfully for many of his buildings in Sleaford and elsewhere in Lincolnshire. The accounts at the back of the journal provide a record of the many surveying and building projects undertaken by Kirk over the period 1833-1848. He frequently carried out work on many of the bridges in the Sleaford area. He was the main building contractor for the Stamford architect Bryan Browning for Folkingham House of Correction \\"Antram\\", (1989), pg283 and supervised extensive alterations to Browning‚Äôs Bourne Town Hall in 1845.Journal and Account Book of Charles Kirk Architectural work =Public buildings = Spalding Sessions House Sessions House, Church Close, Boston, Lincolnshire.

In other regions of Central America it is also called corn tamal. In some regions in South America these tamales are called humitas where the recipes may call for some spices, raisins, other sweet ingredients such as cajeta blanca/arequipe/dulce de leche/manjar, etc.  Description  Uchepo consists of a tamal made with tender maize (corn), which sometimes is added to milk. It has a sweet taste and its consistency is soft. The uchepo can be served on its own, or with green tomatillo salsa or tomato cooked and accompanied by fresh cheese or sour cream. As a dessert, it is usually served and bathed in sweetened condensed milk.  Method of preparation  To prepare uchepos for about four people, it is necessary that you have * 12 fresh sweet ears of corn, * 1 teaspoon salt and * fresh corn leaves. Carefully remove the husks from the ears of corn trying to keep the husks whole and set aside. Remove the silk from the corn. With a sharp knife scrap all the kernels from the cobb. Grind the sweet corn using a grain mill. If you have no access to a grain mill, you can use a blender. It works better when it is done in a blender with enough power to blend the corn to a paste without having to add any liquid. When the corn is ground, add the salt and mix. Wash the reserved husk and dry them with paper towels. Spread about four tablespoons of the corn paste on each husk leaving about 1/2 inch from the edges. Fold the husks in the traditional tamale fold. Steam the uchepos in a tamale steamer form 45‚Äì60 minutes. Test to uchepos by taking one uchepo out of the steamer, open the husks and let it cool for 1‚Äì2 minutes. Take the uchepo and they are done when they do not taste like raw corn any longer. Some people claim that they add butter, sugar and/or milk to the uchepos. That is very unlikely that it is an original recipe as the uchepos are from the Purepecha cuisine where the use of butter is negligent and the corn from Michoacan, the Purepechas native territory, is sweet by nature and there is no need to add any sweetner. Uchepos are served with tomatillo salsa, jocoque (a type of sour cream/curd made from fresh milk) and queso fresco. In other instances, uchepos are used instead of tortillas when people eat pork ribs in salsa verde.

It was published by Neko Entertainment / Big Ben Interactive in Europe and by Graffiti Entertainment / O~3 Entertainment in North America. It was released for the Game Boy Advance on December 14, 2006. Gameplay The player controls a warrior who is mysteriously amnesiac and has been experimented on by demonic creatures. Players can move the character around the game's environments freely, jump around platforms, and fight enemies dynamically. Killed enemies turn to stone, which can then be moved around and used to solve puzzles. When the player's character is wounded, he transforms into a demonic monster, which improves his fighting capabilities. The game does not feature any way to save the player's progress, which had been a standard feature of video games for many years by 2006. Instead, the game relies on passwords to allow the player to return to the game where they had left off when they last turned off the console. Reception The game received mixed and negative reviews. Most critics considered the gameplay to be \\"simple\\" and \\"familiar\\", but the stone- pushing puzzles to be \\"unimaginative\\", unoriginal, and repetitive. Some reviewers considered the graphics and design to be \\"charming and varied\\", easy to discern (in contrast to Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge), but many judged the presentation to be \\"drab\\", \\"grainy\\" and \\"muddy\\". The game's smooth framerate and special effects have received praise, as have the intricate boss battles. Several reviewers have noted that controlling the character from the game's isometric 3D perspective was very difficult and \\"unintuitive\\" because of the rigidity of a directional pad and the difficulty in judging depth. Multiple critics have praised the game's length (estimated between 8 and 15 hours), which is considered good for a portable game. The translation's poor quality has also been criticized. Back to Stone was heavily criticized almost unanimously for its lack of saving functionality, instead relying on a password-based system to track the player's progress, which was seen as a \\"cumbersome\\" flaw for a game on a handheld console, as well as \\"stupefying\\", \\"unforgivable\\" and \\"inexcusably archaic\\" when compared to other games released in this era.

They were used mainly as despatch riders, while also conducting reconnaissance and patrolling. It was disbanded in 1919. History When the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was reorganised and expanded in Egypt in 1916 following its evacuation from Gallipoli, each of its five infantry divisions was allocated a company of cyclists in accordance with the British New Army establishment adopted at that time. At this time each company had an establishment of a headquarters and six cycle platoons with a total strength of 204 men. These companies were formed in March and April 1916 from volunteers from other AIF units in the Middle East. However, following their arrival in France, they were subsequently reorganised as corps troops, with the 1st and 2nd Cyclist Battalions being formed and attached to the I and II ANZAC Corps respectively in May and July. Meanwhile, a Cyclist Training Company was also formed in England. The 2nd Battalion included two companies of New Zealanders, and was commanded mostly by New Zealand officers. The establishment of each battalion included a headquarters and three companies, each of three platoons with a total of 26 officers and 310 other ranks. The cyclist battalions were organised like the infantry, and were mainly used as despatch riders. Later, during the periods of semi-open warfare in 1917 and 1918 they operated in a manner similar to cavalry, conducting reconnaissance and patrolling. However, the nature of trench warfare and the mud and rubble that was often encountered on the battlefield meant that they were mostly unsuited to this role. Other tasks performed included laying communications cabling, traffic control, unloading stores from railway wagons, harvesting crops, and burial of the dead. The soldiers were equipped with a variety of bicycle models made by the Birmingham Small Arms Company, ranging from the Mark I to the Mark IV, and were issued the standard Short Magazine Lee Enfield (SMLE) rifle, which was either attached to the bicycle's down tube, or slung across their back. Lewis guns were also used. Following the formation of the Australian Corps in 1917, the II ANZAC Corps became the XXII Corps. As a result, in March 1918 the 1st Cyclist Battalion was assigned to the Australian Corps, while the Australian personnel serving in the 2nd Cyclist Battalion were returned to other units of the AIF (mainly artillery and infantry) as reinforcements and the remaining New Zealand personnel were used to form the XXII Corps Cycle Battalion. Although the battalions were not used as fighting units, their personnel were regularly exposed to the dangers of artillery fire and attacks by hostile aircraft. However, cyclist detachments were used in the last stages of the war, as the German Army withdrew to the Hindenburg Line. During the war the 1st Cyclist Battalion lost 13 men killed, while the 2nd Cyclist Battalion lost 59 dead. The Australian Corps Cyclist Battalion was disbanded on 30 April 1919. Approximately 3,000 men served in the Australian Cycling Corps, although many probably did not serve in operational units. Units The corps consisted of the following units: * 1st Division Cyclist Company (1916) * 2nd Division Cyclist Company (1916) * 3rd Division Cyclist Company (1916) * 4th Division Cyclist Company (1916) * 5th Division Cyclist Company (1916) * I ANZAC Corps Cyclist Battalion (1916‚Äì18) * II ANZAC Corps Cyclist Battalion (1916‚Äì18) * Australian Corps Cyclist Battalion (1918‚Äì19) See also * Army Cyclist Corps * Bicycle infantry Notes Footnotes Citations References Further reading External links  Category:Military units and formations of Australia in World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1916 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 Category:Military bicycling ","title":"Australian Cycling Corps"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},P={class:"card-container"};function D(s,e,n,c,u,t){const m=y("PoemCard");return i(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",P,[(i(!0),o(h,null,p(t.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(i(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",D]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/48.md","filePath":"glossary/48.md"}'),G={name:"glossary/48.md"},N=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(i(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,N as default};
