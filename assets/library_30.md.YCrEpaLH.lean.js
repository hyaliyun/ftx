The official designation of the route runs along Terminal Avenue between DE 9 and the Port of Wilmington, interchanging with I-495. Signage has the route continuing north along Christiana Avenue to an intersection with U.S. Route 13 (US 13) and DE 9 for a total length of . Christiana Avenue originally became a state highway in the 1920s, becoming a part of US 40 that connected to a ferry across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey. US 40 was removed from this road in the 1930s and it later became part of DE 48, which was subsequently removed in the 1950s following the discontinuance of the ferry. DE 9A was designated by 1971. Route description DE 9A southbound on Terminal Avenue approaching DE 9 DE 9A begins at an intersection with DE 9 in the city of Wilmington, heading east-southeast as two-lane undivided Terminal Avenue through residential areas. The road widens into a four-lane divided highway and comes to an interchange with I-495. Past I-495, the road heads through industrial areas, becoming an undivided road as it crosses over Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary railroad line at a grade crossing. The road crosses Norfolk Southern's Christiana Avenue Industrial Track before reaching the entrance to the Port of Wilmington at the Christiana Avenue intersection. At this point, DelDOT officially marks the end of DE 9A, but signage shows it turning north onto Christiana Avenue. DE 9A proceeds north-northwest as a two-lane road, passing through more industrial areas and crossing under I-495 again, this time underneath of the I-495 bridge over the Christina River. After this, the route crosses over both the Norfolk Southern's New Castle Secondary and Shellpot Secondary at grade crossings in marshland. The road continues between residential and commercial areas to the west and industrial areas to the east before terminating at both US 13 and DE 9 near the Christina River drawbridge leading into Wilmington's central business district. DE 9A has an annual average daily traffic count of 8,151 vehicles along Terminal Avenue. The portion of DE 9A along Terminal Avenue between I-495 and the entrance to the Port of Wilmington at Christiana Avenue is part of the National Highway System. History What is now DE 9A was a county road by 1920. By 1924, the Christiana Avenue portion of the route was constructed as a state highway. Christiana Avenue became a portion of US 40 in 1926, running from US 13 to a ferry that went across the Delaware River to Penns Grove, New Jersey. By 1931, US 40 was removed from this road. The road became the easternmost portion of DE 48 by 1936, which connected to a ferry that linked the route to New Jersey Route 48 in Penns Grove. DE 48 was removed from this road by 1952 after the ferry between Wilmington and Penns Grove was discontinued in 1949. DE 9A was designated around 1971 onto its current alignment.

It was a direct command training unit of the 4th Brigade, and part of the 2nd Division, it was responsible for training of ARes officer cadets (OCDTs) for graduation as lieutenants, and provided driver training and promotion courses for junior non commissioned officers. The regiment was named in honour of General Sir John Monash, one of Australia's most famous soldiers and arguably one of the most effective commanders on the Western Front during World War I. Its last Commanding Officer was Lieutenant Colonel Margaret Sorial, and the last Honorary Colonel was Major General Greg Garde.  History  The regiment, which is known as MONUR (not to be confused with MUR, being Melbourne University Regiment), traces its origins back to 23 April 1966, when Monash University Company was formed as a detachment of MUR. On 23 February 1970 it ceased to be the Monash University Company of MUR, and became a regiment in its own right. As a training unit, MONUR does not carry any battle honours on its Colours which are laid up in the Religious Centre on the Clayton campus of Monash University. However, past and present members of the unit have been involved in every major Australian deployment since 1966 with a large number of members assisting in natural disaster relief, including the Black Saturday bushfires. Since its formation the Regiment enjoyed a loose association with Monash University, with a majority of officer cadets also studying at the university. This relationship has not always proved an easy one, especially during the Vietnam War-era when Monash University's Clayton campus was a hotbed of student activism. In 2013, MonUR was amalgamated with Melbourne University Regiment under Plan Beersheba.  Structure  Immediately prior to its removal from the order of battle, the Regiment was structured into a Regimental (Battalion) Headquarters and two sub-units: Cadet Company and Logistic Support Company. Cadet Company contained all the officer cadets undertaking the commissioning course to become commissioned officers in the Australian Army. The Logistic Support Company provided training and logistic support to the Regiment, particularly to the Cadet Company training program in support of the First Appointment Course to train reservists as commissioned officers. Logistic Support Company consisted of a catering cell, a rifle section for demonstration and OPFOR purposes, Q store, a transport section, and administration cell. Monash University Regiment sent approximately 10 Staff Cadets each to the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC-D) each year to complete this part-time officer course, graduates of which were commissioned as Lieutenants at Duntroon before being allocated to their Corps and posted to their first unit. For much of the 2000s decade, MONUR came under command of the Royal Military College of Australia, a brigade-sized formation that included RMC-D and all university regiments in the Australian Army.  Traditions  The regiment's motto is Ancora Imparo which is attributed to Michelangelo and translates as \\"I am still learning\\", which is also the University's motto. Members of the Regiment wear an Academic Blue (or Cambridge Blue) lanyard which signifies the unit's link with Monash University, which in turn adopted many of the traditions of Cambridge University. The regimental badge is backed by a red \\"aura\\" which signifies the alliance of MONUR with the British Army's Light Infantry, now amalgamated into The Rifles. MONUR enjoyed a healthy rivalry with its larger counterpart, MUR. All new inductees to the Officer Cadet's Mess (named in honour of Lieutenant David Sabben, MG) were required to denounce any allegiance to the sister unit. The regiment's mascot was a black sheep (ram) indicative of the status and culture of the Regiment as a historical formation within MUR. The unofficial mascot of MONUR's Cadet Company was a comical orange stuffed toy known as \\"The Muppet\\", with the worthiest Officer Cadet guarding this revered figure at all times. MONUR's regimental quick march is \\"Imperial Echoes\\", which was composed by Arnold Safroni in 1913 and used as the signature tune of the BBC Newsreel feature during World War II.  Notable members  Former unit members and graduates include: * Robert Champion de Crespigny (RCDC), businessman and member of the first graduating class * Peter Carroll, Department of Defence mandarin and member of Cadet Company * Singer and performer Vanessa Amorosi * Bill Shorten, leader of the Australian Labor Party, member 1985‚Äì1986 References ; Notes ;Bibliography * External links * Monash University Regiment History * The Rifles * Antarctic exploration Regiments of Australia Military units and formations established in 1966 Military units and formations disestablished in 2013 ","title":"Monash University Regiment"},{"id":"9782524","text":"Soda s·ªØa h·ªôt g√†, also known as egg soda, is a sweet drink made from egg yolk, sweetened condensed milk, and club soda from southern Vietnam, though it is also consumed in Cambodia.

In horse riding, a refusal or runout is the failure of a horse to jump a fence to which he is presented. This includes any stop in forward motion. A runout occurs when the horse quickly moves sideways to go around the fence instead of jumping it, without stopping forward motion. Problems Refusals and runouts are counted against riders in jumping competitions. In show jumping and the stadium phase of eventing, a refusal is worth four penalty points. In the cross-country phase of eventing, a refusal counts as 20 penalty points. Refusals also have the potential to unseat the rider, which may result in rider injury. Refusals also present the possibility that the horse may crash into the obstacle. In extreme cases, however, it may be best for a horse to refuse rather than jump a fence which he cannot clear, as he might land on the fence, fall on landing, or flip over. Reasons There are several reasons for refusals, and therefore a rider must try to identify the problem before reprimanding the horse for his disobedience. Rider-based reasons * Poor take- off distance, usually due to rider error, which would make it unsafe to jump * Horse does not have enough power (impulsion) to safely clear the obstacle, again usually due to rider error * Horse has repeatedly been hit in the mouth or back due to a poor jumping position of the rider, and now associates jumping with pain * Rider is unsure of jumping the fence, and his or her feelings are transmitted to the horse * Habit: the horse has learned that it can refuse without consequence, and does so to get out of work * A solid, colorful, or otherwise different fence may scare the horse * Horse is \\"sour,\\" or has been over-jumped and has begun to hate the work Physical problems * Back pain, or general soreness * Dental problems * Lameness issues, arthritis * The horse is physically unable to jump the obstacle, due to conformational issues, insufficient conditioning, or lack of ability. If a horse has begun to refuse frequently when before it was willing, a veterinary exam can be performed to rule out pain. When pain is ruled out as a factor, rider error is a very common cause for refusals; poor riding may place the horse in a position so that he physically would find it extremely difficult to clear the obstacle (such as too far or too close to the jump). Additionally, riders who do not release over the fence, preventing the horse from stretching down, will hit the horse in the mouth with the bit and cause pain. If this happens frequently, the horse will associate the pain with the jumping effort itself, and may begin to refuse. Horses that have begun to refuse due to rider error often require retraining. If a horse is physically unable to jump a fence of a certain size or height, even with the best riding, pushing a horse may result in physical harm to the animal or cause an accident involving both horse and rider.

It was named after a well known Ledford family in the area. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the peak of the coal boom in Saline County, it was a thriving mining center home to more than 1000 people. It lies three miles South of Harrisburg on US 45. At one time, it had a population of 1,100 to 1,400 people. According to an early edition of the Harrisburg Daily Register, there was a time during the first 10 years of the 20th century that the population of Ledford was larger than that of Harrisburg, the county seat. In 1905, Saline County had numerous small slope mines and 15 major shaft mines. Thirteen of these larger mines were along the Big Four Railroad that traveled through Ledford. Around these mines were small communities of company houses that were called patches. In Ledford alone there was a 2 patch, 5 patch and a 14 patch, all named for the mine number that provided the company housing. Just south of Ledford was another patch of housing built by the Hungarians, called \\"Hunky Row\\" by the locals. In the early 20th century, these coal mine settlements made up most of the population of Ledford. Prior to the opening of the coal mines, which began around 1870, the families that were scattered around Saline County were pioneer stock. Most came from New England. Around 1900 to 1910, 1,536 immigrants came to Saline County. Most came to work in the coal mines. Most had come from Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Lithuania. The town was known for its lavish gambling, partying, and night life. Notorious gangster Charlie Birger, who lived in Ledford, shot and murdered \\"Crip\\" Yates in Ledford on December 4, 1917. At one time, Ledford had a jail, a post office, opened September 30, 1880 - January 30, 1882, then reopened Feb. 20, 1892 - Oct. 31, 1935. two catholic Churches, a Baptist church, a parish school, East and West Ledford Schools, several grocery stores, a restaurant, a boarding house, and a pool room. Some say there was a roller skating rink and a movie house. Ledford even had its own movie star by the stage name of Frances McIntyre, a local actress. Her real name was Stella Stevers. Ledford also boasted large mining factories and industries that left a distinct fog throughout the town. Ledford today has a cemetery, an abandoned Hungarian cemetery, and the Ledford Baptist Church. Ledford spreads across a 4-mile stretch of land along Rt. 45 between Carrier Mills and Harrisburg with several roads shooting off to the left and right of the highway. Today, Ledford is considered part of Harrisburg, Illinois. Almost all signs of the mining industry are gone. The mines' air shafts and fans are gone as well as the many coal tipples and mine ponds that dotted the area. The smoke stacks are missing and the air is clean. Gone are the sounds of the tipples hoisting coal, the steam whistles signaling the men, and the occasional snorts of a steam locomotive or the groaning of a streetcar motor.

It was directed by Eric Karson and written by Paul Aaron and Leigh Chapman. The film involves a martial artist (Chuck Norris) who must stop a group of terrorists trained in the ninja style by his half-brother (Tadashi Yamashita). It was filmed in Los Angeles and released on August 14, 1980. It is notable for its inventive use of 'voice over' effects to portray the inner life of Norris' character, Scott James. This was actor Richard Norton's film debut. Plot The film opens with a short scene at a terrorist training camp. The main instructor, Katsumoto (Yuki Shimoda) tells the graduating class that all of their actions and whereabouts will be known and that if they do anything to expose or harm the group, they and their families will be killed. The film then cuts to an assassination of a diplomat by members of the group. One of the terrorists is shot by a bodyguard while the others escape. We then meet Scott James (Chuck Norris), a retired karate champion, who is at a dance performance. After the performance, he meets one of the dancers named Nancy (Kim Lankford). He takes her out to dinner because he is interested in how she incorporated the martial arts into her routine. She seems distant during the dinner and is more concerned about a recent assassination that took place abroad. She wonders if \\"an American was killed\\". Scott takes Nancy home, and he senses that someone is there. The lights do not work as they enter, and then they are attacked by a group of ninja. Scott fights them off, but they end up killing Nancy. After he restores power to the house, he finds that the entire family has been killed. The next day, Scott goes to see an old mercenary friend named McCarn (Lee Van Cleef). Scott asks him if he knows about any ninja activity. However, McCarn tells him, \\"If you are seeing ninja, you are seeing ghosts.\\" McCarn tries to recruit Scott to join his cause in eliminating terrorists, but Scott declines. On his way back from McCarn's place, Scott encounters a rich lady named Justine (Karen Carlson), who managed to get her car stuck on the side of the road. She asks Scott for help, and after he helps her, she takes his keys, forcing him to walk back to her place to get them. Scott goes back to Justine's house to get his keys, and she pretends to find them in her purse. She offers to drive him back since \\"It would be the only decent thing to do.\\" Scott agrees, only on the condition that this time, he drives. On their way back, Scott and Justine are chased by two cars. Scott and Justine manage to evade their pursuers. After Scott gets back to his car, Justine identifies one of the cars as being \\"her bodyguards.\\" Scott then asks her out to dinner since she has now become \\"an object of concern\\". Before their date, Scott goes back to McCarn's and notices that the car that was chasing them belonged to McCarn. He confronts Justine, and she confesses that she hired McCarn to be her bodyguard because McCarn told her that Scott would not accept her offer of employment. She also wants him to kill a man named Seikura (Tadashi Yamashita). She confesses that her father was killed by terrorists and that she has since been on a crusade to eliminate them. She has managed to help \\"retire\\" two of the three main terrorist leaders, but Seikura remains. Scott is insulted by her actions, and he promptly declines her offer and leaves. Scott's friend, A.J. (Art Hindle) is a karate champion and feels frustrated by the recent terrorist attacks that have taken place both abroad and on Nancy. He decides to start going after terrorists himself. He tries to find a German terrorist, but that terrorist is killed by McCarn's men before A.J. can catch him. McCarn then fills A.J. in on just who he is and his relationship to Scott. He also tells A.J. that it was Nancy's brother who was killed in the terrorist attack abroad and that she was killed in retaliation. A. J. decides to join McCarn's cause. We see a flashback where Scott remembers training with his half brother Seikura. He and his brother are seen running through an obstacle course to obtain a sword. Scott stumbles at the end but still manages to get the sword. However, his enraged brother grabs the sword and declares it to be his. Scott's adoptive father (John Fujioka), then berates Seikura and disowns him. He tells Scott that Seikura is now his enemy for life. The movie cuts to a scene at the Octagon training camp where a new group of recruits has graduated. One recruit, Aura (Carol Bagdasarian) has reservations about what she is doing but leaves the camp to report to a terrorist dispatcher named \\"Doggo\\" (Kurt Grayson). Scott realizes that A.J. and McCarn are right, so he signs up and attends a mercenary recruiting camp in an attempt to be recruited so he can get to Seikura. He gets interviewed at Doggo's camp, but Doggo knows his true identity, and he refuses his services. Scott then has to fight his way out of Doggo's facility, defeating \\"Longlegs\\" (Richard Norton) and \\"Hatband\\" (Aaron Norris) and returns to his hotel. Later that day, Aura grabs Scott's file and defects from Doggo's camp. Meanwhile, Justine manages to recruit A.J. to find Seikura. As Scott goes back to his room, he encounters Aura, and she tells him that she regrets what she has done and that she can lead him to Seikura's camp. Justine then comes by to try once more to get Scott to help her, but she gives up after seeing Aura and decides to get Seikura herself. As she goes out of the hotel with A.J., she is hit with a poisoned dart from one of Doggo's men and dies. A.J. then leaves to find Seikura's place while McCarn stays behind to watch Scott. A few hours later, several ninja are seen scaling the hotel. They attack Scott and Aura but are defeated‚Äîthe last shot by one of McCarn's men as he is descending the hotel. A firefight then erupts between McCarn's men and Doggo's men, and all of Doggo's men are killed. Scott and Aura then depart to Mexico for Seikura's terrorist camp. Realizing they may not survive, they have sex in a motel room before going in. A.J. is then shown finding Seikura's place (located in Mexico or an unnamed Central American nation) the hard way, and he is eventually captured and taken prisoner. Aura gets Scott to the compound, and Scott infiltrates the camp. He is eventually discovered and led to an area known as \\"The Octagon\\" (a building filled with treacherous paths and enemies). Scott fights his way through and ends up fighting Seikura's \\"enforcer\\" named \\"Kyo\\" (again, played by Richard Norton). Scott defeats Kyo, and as a result, Seikura kills A.J. by slitting his throat. Scott and Seikura fight, but Seikura escapes the compound. Meanwhile, Aura infiltrates the compound and recruits several of her fellow former trainees to fight back and burn the compound to the ground. They end up destroying the entire camp, but only Aura manages to survive. She then goes after Scott and Seikura. As the sun is coming up, she sees Seikura attack Scott from behind. However, Scott stabs Seikura with his sword and the movie ends with Scott standing over Seikura's body.

Release The Octagon opened in Los Angeles on 22 August 1980. Reception Variety noted that the film \\"ought to keep the fans happy. A bizarre plot involving the Ninja cult of Oriental assassins with international terrorism provides plenty of chances for Norris and other martial art experts to do their stuff, and pic has a nicely stylized look with excellent lensing and music. Subtleties of writing and performing are not this film's selling points, so it would be misleading to belabor those inadequacies.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The Octagon\\". Variety. August 13, 1980. 26. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"It has an understandable story with a little bit of sophistication, which immediately places it head and shoulders above the typical kung-fu chop-socky flick. Unfortunately, 'The Octagon' gets a little too complicated for its own good. There are a bunch of supporting characters who really aren't that crucial to the story, once it gets going in a straight line toward the ultimate confrontation between Scott James and his Oriental relative.\\"Siskel, Gene (August 19, 1980). \\"He's no Bruce Lee, but Norris hits in 'Octagon'\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 2. Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"What is deeply disturbing about this movie is its inherent cynicism and wholesale endorsement of and commitment to violence. The screenplay by Leigh Chapman from a story by Chapman and Paul Aaron is predicated on the notion that pacifism causes violence and the only way to stop terrorism is to become a better fighter than your enemy, who in this case happens to be the hero's half-brother. The film also implies that if there are no wars around to fight, it's necessary to invent some.\\"Gross, Linda (August 25, 1980). \\"Violence on All Sides in 'Octagon'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 6. Joseph McLellan of The Washington Post wrote, \\"Clearly 'The Octagon' is no real threat to 'War and Peace' or even 'Beau Geste,' but it will appeal to those who are still in mourning for Bruce Lee, who like carefully choreographed fight scenes and who enjoy standing in front of a mirror looking at their muscles.\\"McLellan, Joseph (August 25, 1980).

Bromby was born in Hull, England, the son of the Reverend John Healey Bromby and his wife Jane, n√©e Amis. His brother was Charles Henry Bromby, later Bishop of Tasmania. Bromby was educated at Hull Grammar School, Uppingham. At 18 he entered St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated ninth wrangler and third in the second class of the Classics tripos in 1832. He was elected a fellow of St John's College. Bromby was ordained deacon in 1834 and priest in 1836. He was appointed second master at Bristol College in 1836 and then for some years conducted a private school at Clifton. From 1847 to 1854 he was Principal of Elizabeth College, Guernsey, was university preacher at Cambridge in 1850, obtaining the degree of D.D., and after 1854 was curate for two or three years to his father at Hull. He was then appointed headmaster of the newly founded Church of England Grammar School in Melbourne, Australia, where he arrived in February 1858 with his wife and nine children. The school opened on 7 April 1858 with 86 students and the number of boys soon began to grow rapidly. There were 195 at the school in 1861 and it prospered for many years. He was appointed a member of a Royal Commission to report on the working of the educational system on 4 September 1866. About 1871 the number of students at the Grammar school began to fall off, partly because of the foundation of other secondary schools, and in 1874, feeling that it might be for the benefit of the school to have a younger headmaster, Bromby resigned and was succeeded by Edward Ellis Morris. He was appointed incumbent of St Paul's, Melbourne, in 1877 a position he held until his death. On the completion of his seventy-fifth year in 1884 he was presented with an address and ¬£1000. He died at his parsonage at East Melbourne and was buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery. He was married twice and was survived by his second wife and two sons and three daughters of the first marriage. He was the author of a volume of Sermons and the Earlier Chapters of Genesis, and several of his lectures and sermons were published as pamphlets. Bromby as a headmaster encouraged games and relied more on a good moral tone than strict discipline. He was for many years a member of the council of the University of Melbourne, and was its first Warden of the Senate. As a clergyman, though he claimed to belong to no school, he was in sympathy with the broad church section of the Church of England, and was one of the best preachers of his period, scholarly and fearless in his independence of thought, with a pleasant voice and delivery. Though apparently somewhat reserved and austere, he was really thoroughly kindly in his disposition, and was a good conversationalist, with much appreciation of wit and humour.

History of the overseas highway. Retrieved from http://www.keyshistory.org/osh.html After a replacement Bahia Honda Bridge was opened in 1972, two spans of the old bridge were removed for the safety of boat traffic and to prevent pedestrian access to unsafe parts of the bridge. History Bahia Honda Bridge during railroad operation (before highway conversion) Postcard of the bridge during operation for highway use. The Bahia Honda railroad bridge was originally built by Henry Flagler as part of the FEC's Overseas Railroad. Opened in 1912, Flagler funded the railway construction between Miami and Key West using his own personal funds. The Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 destroyed much of the line, and FEC sought abandonment. It was purchased by the state of Florida and converted for highway use in 1938., Collingwood Publications. (2010). Bahia Honda State Park. Retrieved from http://www.key-largo-sunsets.com/bahia-honda.html Rather than rebuilding the bridge, the top of the structure was redecked for use as the Overseas Highway (the existing deck inside the truss was too narrow for vehicular traffic). A new four-lane bridge was built and opened in 1972, a few hundred yards north of the old bridge, replacing the former route of U.S. 1. Two of the truss spans have been removed. One near the east end to allow boat traffic to pass through Bahia Honda Channel without the danger of falling debris from the old bridge; the other at the westernmost end to prevent pedestrians from accessing unsafe parts of the bridge. It is a misconception the trusses were removed in order to facilitate traffic for boats needing higher vertical clearance, as the new bridge has roughly the same vertical clearance of about 20 feet. The original bridge has fallen into a state of disrepair; signs have been posted on the bridge warning boat traffic to watch for falling debris, but all of the sections have remained standing (not counting the two that were removed). The easternmost section remains open to pedestrian traffic and is maintained by Bahia Honda State Park. The bridge provides a scenic overview of the area for tourists. Structural Design Before being reused as a highway bridge, the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge carried a single track of FEC across Big Spanish Channel from Bahia Honda Key to Spanish Harbor Key. Unlike other bridges on the Overseas Railway, the Bahia Honda has a steel truss construction. This was a necessary difference from the predominate concrete arch form of the other bridges of the Overseas Railroad, as the channel is the deepest of those spanned, at 24 feet. The central span is a Parker truss with a span of 247 feet. This is surrounded by 13 Pratt truss sections spanning 186 feet on either side, and 13 smaller Pratt trusses each spanning 128 feet outside those. Nine plate girder sections were used for the western approach, for a total length of 5055 feet. The smaller Pratt trusses have riveted connections, but the larger Pratt and Parker trusses use pinned connections, making the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge the longest pin- connected truss bridge in the U.S. The original construction of the bridge was carried out by William Krome and Joseph Meredith, and the vehicular conversion was undertaken by B.M. Duncan.

The park includes a lake, a lodge, bridges, trails, courts and a public amphitheater. The area is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. The park is named for Frances Wintersmith. Location and activities Wintersmith Park is located on the southeastern edge of Ada. It is south of 18th Street, east of Scenic Drive and west of Country Club Road. The park contains of land, Wintersmith Lake, a public swimming pool and splash park, a lodge, courts for basketball, softball, volleyball and horseshoes, a lighted trail, eight picnic pavilions, a playground, a zoo, and a Kiwanis amusement park as well as bridges, trails and a public amphitheater. History Wintersmith Park was a \\"New Deal\\" work program, created during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) to improve communities and provide wages for unemployed people. Work began on the park in 1933 when the young men of camp number 824 arrived in Ada. The men were paid a monthly wage of $30. A Wintersmith Park Bridge The Wintersmith project was unique among New Deal projects as it was the first time the National Park Service (NPS) would be working with the CCC on a project. The NPS usually worked only on the country's national parks. The combined team would work for more than a year to transform on Ada's eastern edge. They built a lake, a lodge, bridges, trails and, perhaps most remarkably, a public amphitheater. =Public Amphitheater= Built into a naturally occurring slope on the parks south edge, the amphitheater consists of natural stone found in the park and stone quarried from nearby Fittstown, Oklahoma. A crew of stonemasons worked for three months to complete the project. When completed in 1934, the amphitheater was arguably one of the most distinctive places in Oklahoma. The amphitheatre served as host for many community events, including plays, musicals, public speaking, beauty pageants, talent shows and community sings. Over the years, however, the amphitheater had slid into disrepair. Frequent use, low level of maintenance and the elements combined to press the amphitheater into a worn out state. The cap stones that serve as seats were often broken, cracked or missing. The risers holding up the seats had suffered significant erosion damage. The barrier walls on the north and sound ends of the amphitheater were compromised or sometimes missing altogether. Wintersmith Park Amphitheater Dr. Marvin Kroeker, a longtime Ada resident and East Central University history professor emeritus, hoped to save the amphitheater and bring it back to its former glory. In 2000, Dr. Kroeker took Oklahoma State Historic Preservation Office deputy Melvena Heisch on a tour of the park and the amphitheater. He sought to convince Mrs. Heisch to nominate the amphitheater for designation on the National Register of Historic Places. After the tour, Mrs. Heisch determined the entire Wintersmith area, to be known as the Wintersmith historic district, should be nominated for the Register. The park, including the amphitheater, was accepted for the Register in June 2000. Following the designation, Dr. Kroeker saw the opportunity to solicit funding from the Oklahoma Centennial Commission for restoration of the amphitheater. The Ada city council voted to designate the amphitheater Ada's Oklahoma Centennial project and made the application for funding from the Centennial Commission. The Centennial Commission accepted the amphitheater project application, and the project was funded with $150,000 of commission grants. Jones Chapel Schoolhouse Restoration of the amphitheater has begun. Student and adult volunteers have cleaned up the amphitheater and took down weeds and undergrowth. Dirt contractors have moved the earth to help protect the area from erosion. Concrete workers have poured the new handicap areas at the top and foot of the amphitheater. New ‚Äúbutternut‚Äù cap stones were put into place to replace the broken and missing seating. Upcoming construction plans call for concrete drop off area and parking, concession and ticket buildings, walkways and a stage. Soon after restoration, a special production reintroducing the amphitheater, celebrating Oklahoma's centennial and recognizing the 75th anniversary of America's New Deal is expected. =Jones Chapel Schoolhouse= Jones Chapel Schoolhouse (also known as the \\"Little Red Schoolhouse\\") is located in the park off 18th Street. The schoolhouse opened in 1907 west of town. It was moved to the Kerr Lab area in 1976, where it was painted red, and then its current location in Wintersmith Park in 1990. The schoolhouse has many windows, which served both for light and air-conditioning when the building was in use. Campbell Cabin =Campbell Cabin= The Campbell Cabin, located next to the schoolhouse, is another structure with historic significance to the area.

The plot follows many of the issues of the day, including race relations, corporate politics, business ethics, terrorism and journalism. (Hailey would later explore (television) journalism in another novel, The Evening News.) Plot Synopsis The novel is described from the point of view of vice-president of Golden State Power and Light, Nimrod \\"Nim\\" Goldman, who, despite being married, tends to be somewhat of a Lothario and has many extramarital affairs. The geographic area of service of the fictional electric utility, Golden State Power and Light, matches the actual Northern California footprint of the real-life Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Golden State Power and Light is a public utility, supplying two-thirds of California's electric power. During a hot summer, GSP&L; as it is called, loses a major part of its capacity to supply power due to a terrorist attack on its largest \\"oil burner\\" (an oil-fired power plant), called Big Lil. There is a board meeting about the incident. The chairman of GSP&L;, Eric Humphrey, leaves the matter in the hands of Nim Goldman, one of the utility's many vice- presidents, and head of security Ray Paulsen. After the explosion at Big Lil, which killed chief engineer Walter Talbot, Nim visits Ardythe, Walter's widow, and Wally, his son. After some time, Nim and Ardythe make love. As a result of Nim noticing how some customers were marked for emergency restoration (because they depend on electric power for survival, such as iron lung users and certain disabled persons), utility billing supervisor Teresa Van Buren convinces Nim go visit one of these emergency restoration customers, Karen Sloan, a quadriplegic who uses a portable respirator on her wheelchair, whom he instantly befriends, angering Ruth, his wife and his children Leah and Benjamin. Later, Nim and Harry London, property protection president, go to Brookside, to catch power thieves. And surprisingly, they catch many. Nim later learns that the terrorist attacks were by a group called \\"Friends of Freedom\\". Later the leader of the group, Georgos Archambault, mails letter bombs and kills five people including utility president Fraser Fenton. Because of this, Nim forms a think group with utility General Counsel Oscar O'Brien, Teresa Van Buren and Harry London. Laura Bo Carmichael, chairman of environmental group Sequoia Clubs (a thinly veiled reference to the real-life Sierra Club) meets with Nim to protest the building of three coal-fired plants at Tunipah, Fincastle valley and Devil's Gate, fearing the environmental damage. Not having much experience with coal, Nim decides to take a trip to Colorado and visit a power plant operated by Public Service Company of Colorado (now known as Xcel Energy). Noticing that a worker on the furnace feed conveyor was in danger, Nim instinctively runs down to the plant floor and saves the man from otherwise certain death. A comely young lady who is part of the group saw what happened and decides she wants to invite herself into Nim's bed and offer him sex as a thank you for what he did. When Nim is back in his bedroom a woman slips in, and he discovers it's not the lady who propositioned him, it's the wife of one of the executives of the Colorado electric company where he is staying, who asks Nim to impregnate her so she can have a child (the other executive had privately admitted to Nim that he is \\"shooting blanks\\", i.e. infertile and unable to get his wife pregnant.) Then, later, the lady who originally wanted to bed Nim arrives, and is able to get Nim to have sex with her as well. Returning to California after his trip, Nim decides the benefits of coal power outweigh the environmental risks, but also decides to continue the startup of other power plants, as a result a geothermal plant at Fincastle and a hydro at Devil's Gate are launched. At Devil's Gate, Nim and the press end up seeing a gruesome electrocution of a plant employee after he tries to save a technician's child (similar to the successful effort of Nim in saving a worker at the Colorado coal plant). A California Examiner (the local newspaper for San Francisco) reporter, Nancy Molineaux, reports Nim to be selfish when she sees him arrive in a utility- owned helicopter. David Birdsong, leader of Power and Light for People, and the Sequoia Club, hold a trial against GSP&L.; Birdsong and Georgos later plan to destroy the power workers, including Nim Goldman who would meet for a conference at a hotel. Unknown to Georgos, Yvette, his mistress, knows of his plans and betrays him to Nancy Molineaux, who reports it to the police thirty- six minutes before the bombs go off. In an attempt to secure the last remaining bomb, Art Romeo, London's assistant, is blown to pieces when the bomb goes off. The think group, using coded incoming mail, finally arrest David Birdsong and expose Georgos. Georgos attempts to bomb Big Lil, but he is killed by the pump's turbine blades. The plant manager, noticing that someone had gotten into the reservoir, realizes that if the plant is bombed while it is operating, the damage would put the plant out of operation for months, but a bomb when the plant is shut down would only cause minor damage, chooses to shut the plant down, causing a major power shortage. Georgio's corpse floats up after the turbines stop, essentially confirming the manager's concern. This shut down, however, causes a major blackout throughout the region. Karen Sloan dies after her respirator fails due to this power outage. Nim discovers his wife is dying of cancer, and the novel ends as Nim finally befriends Nancy Molineaux and visits her at her house as she offers Nim a one-time opportunity to be her lover.

Administered by the Rochester City School District, SOTA is located on the corner of Prince Street and University Avenue, within walking distance of the Memorial Art Gallery, Eastman Theatre, Writers & Books, Visual Studies Workshop, and other cultural organizations. The School of the Arts was founded in 1980 as an experimental program at Wilson Jr. High School. In 1981, the school transferred to Monroe High School as was known as the School of the Arts at Monroe. Only grades 7-9 were represented that year. The school stayed at Monroe for many years, eventually becoming a full Jr-Sr. High School, while retaining the name \\"School of the Arts at Monroe\\". Until it moved into its current space (the old Eastman School of Music dormitories), when it became \\"The School of the Arts\\". School of the Arts has many different after-school arts programs, called Tenth Period. Tenth Period is a class that offers the following classes: Dance, Jazz Band, Theater Technology, Photography, Visual Arts, and Creative Writing. However, Tenth Period was canceled during the 2008-2009 school year, much to the dismay of the students. Another reason for the cancellation of Tenth Period was due to a budget problem. Now Tenth Period is used for test prep, and students have to be accompanied with a teacher, if they are staying after-school. School of the Arts students can audition into the school with one of the following majors: visual arts, creative writing, drama, theatre technology, dance, instrumental, vocal, piano, or strings. Students then starting in their freshman year receive two back-to-back 42-minute classes of their major for the rest of high school. Before these major classes students in the 7th and 8th grade take \\"roll around\\" art classes such as technology, art and general music to get an experience of all the arts offered at the school no matter what their major is. Through this students are able to learn and expand their knowledge and love for their art. Students are also able to join various programs by audition. Some of those programs include: Dance Concert, Fall and Winter Productions, \\"Unaccompanied Minors\\" a cappella group, Black History Program, Playwrights festival, Senior Jazz and Wind Ensembles, and many more. Academics As in other schools, School Of The Arts has academic classes and arts classes. SOTA offers Honors and Advanced Placement(AP) classes, Special Education, Spanish 1,2,3 and 4-Honors. Students carry a full academic course load as well as a fine arts sequence. SOTA offers a rich diversity of arts courses within seven major fine arts concentrations: *Creative Writing *Dance *Drama *Instrumental (Strings, Wind, Brass, and Percussion) *Piano *Strings *Theatre Technology *Visual Arts *Vocal Film and television *SOTA was featured in the major motion picture Cherry Crush, where they used the lunch room, theatres, hallways and classroom as the \\"public school\\" setting for the main characters Jordan Wells played by Jonathan Tucker and Shay Bettencourt played by Nikki Reed. *On June 4, 2009, SOTA received the Signature Schools Enterprise Award. They were one out of six schools that won the award, which comes with a $5,000 grant. During this award ceremony, students held a silent protest while standing in the lobby with their mouths covered with black duct tape. *On June 9, 2009, SOTA students held another protest against the budget plan proposed by former Superintendent Brizard that plans to cut teachers. The students marched from school to RCSD headquarters and back to City Hall, where they performed things including tap dance, poetry reading, Jazz band, and choir outside of the entrance. Performances SOTA puts on two musicals and three plays a year, as well as an annual Dance Concert, music recitals, poetry readings/coffee houses, and other various art performances. The school has also begun celebrating Black History Month with a whole day full of performances dedicated to it. Notable alumni *Christian Simmons, Basketball player *Taye Diggs, actor *Charlene L.

Early life Bromby was the second son of John Healey Bromby (a priest) and brother of John Edward Bromby. He was born in Hull, England. He was educated at Hull Grammar School, Uppingham School and St John's College, Cambridge, where he graduated BA in 1837 with third-class honours in classics, MA in 1840 and DD in 1864. Career Bromby was made deacon in Lichfield in 1838 and served as curate at Chesterfield from 1838‚Äì9; and was ordained priest in 1839 in York and was headmaster of Stepney Grammar School from 1839. In 1843 Bromby was appointed vicar at St Paul's, Cheltenham, and was joint-founder and principal of the Cheltenham training college for teachers 1843‚Äì1864. He published The Sorrows of Bethany and other Sermons (1846), which was followed by The Pupil Teacher's English Grammar (1848), and a volume on Liturgy and Church History (1852), the third edition of this appeared in 1862 under the title of Church Students' Manual. In 1864 he was appointed bishop of Tasmania, the last Colonial bishop to be nominated by the crown, and was consecrated on St Peter's day 1864, by Charles Longley, Archbishop of Canterbury at Canterbury Cathedral. In 1868, when the question of the abolishing of state aid to religion was dealt with, Bromby was largely responsible for the passing of the commutation act which resulted in the Church of England in Tasmania receiving about ¬£60,000 as a perpetual endowment instead of the former yearly payments. Early in 1869 a contract was made for the building of the nave of St David's cathedral, and the cathedral was consecrated in 1874, Bromby himself acting as Dean from 1874 to 1876. In 1880 he visited England, and in 1882 resigned his see. His episcopate was marked by the building of several new churches and a great increase in the number of clergy. Bromby returned to England and became rector of Shrawardine-cum- Montford (1882‚Äì1887), and assistant-bishop of Lichfield (1882‚Äì1891). He was also warden of St John's Hospital, Lichfield (1887‚Äì1891). He then became assistant Bishop of Bath and Wells until he resigned in 1900 at the age of 86. He lived in retirement with his son, Henry Bromby, at Clifton, and died there on 14 April 1907. Legacy Bromby also published several sermons and addresses in pamphlet form. He married in 1839 Mary Anne, daughter of a Dr Bodley of Brighton, and there were several children. The eldest son, Henry Bodley Bromby (1840‚Äì1911) became dean of Hobart in 1876, and the second son Charles Hamilton was in the Tasmanian government. The Tasmanian synod founded a studentship in Bromby's memory in 1910. References *Herbert H.

He said of the film, \\"The 'families' in Rolling Family are already morally 'corrupted.' It is never clearly spoken, but one of the reasons is obvious: they live in the capital. They have urbanised, diversified and standardised themselves; they are no longer the safeguard against problems, but are now a part of them, and perhaps among the most serious ones...the characters are presented in a much crueler and hostile way, and the filmmaker does not just look at 'the others' with a dark gaze, but also at 'us'.\\"Lerer, Diego.

CinemaScope film in WarnerColor, produced by Richard Whorf and directed by Gordon Douglas. The film stars Natalie Wood and Karl Malden, and co-stars Marsha Hunt and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. It was adapted from a Sam Rolfe story by screenwriter Irving Wallace. Leonard Rosenman composed the score. The film's storyline concerns the introduction of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber into the US Strategic Air Command (SAC) inventory during the Cold War era of the 1950s. A dilemma arises for a respected and highly experienced master sergeant when he must choose between continuing his career in the Air Force or accepting a lucrative job offer in the private sector that would pay him three times his military salary. Plot The Strategic Air Command is about to introduce the B-52 Stratofortress bomber as its primary manned strategic weapon. Stationed at Castle Air Force Base, California, with the 329th Bomb Squadron, 20-year United States Air Force (USAF) veteran MSgt. Chuck Brennan dislikes his commanding officer, the \\"hotshot\\" Lt. Col. Jim Herlihy. Brennan has not trusted Herlihy since an incident in the Korean War. This career-long problem interferes with flight operations and aircraft support. When Herlihy starts dating Brennan's daughter Lois, tensions grow. Brennan demands his daughter break off the relationship. Brennan, Herlihy, and others try to solve all the technical problems that plague the introduction of the B-52. On one top-secret test flight to Africa, after being refueled in mid-air, a control panel short- circuits, causing a fire. Herlihy orders everyone to bail out and ejects Brennan when he refuses to leave the bomber. After safely landing the burning aircraft at Castle AFB, Herlihy sends out search parties, who manage to recover all of the crew successfully except for Brennan. Following a hunch, Herlihy eventually finds his chief aircraft mechanic, who is severely injured, and airlifts him by helicopter from remote back country to the base hospital. While recovering, Brennan realizes that he was wrong about Herlihy, who risked his life to bring him home. He accepts that his daughter and his commanding officer should now reunite. Eventually, Brennan also has to choose between a high-paying civilian job and his US Air Force career. When told that his discharge papers are ready to sign, he decides to continue the career he loves in the USAF. Cast * Natalie Wood as Lois Brennan * Karl Malden as MSgt. Chuck V.

Bombers B-52 was filmed with the full cooperation of the United States Air Force at Castle and March Air Force Bases in California, where examples of Boeing B-47 Stratojet bombers, North American F-86 Sabre fighters and B-52s were based. During production, Natalie Wood was named \\"Sweetheart of Castle Air Force Base\\". The first choice for the starring role was Tab Hunter, who subsequently turned it down because he was tired of playing military roles.Hunter and Muller 2005, p. 147. Writer Irving Wallace wrote a \\"racy\\" screenplay; one of the working titles was No Sleep till Dawn (which was used as the title for the film's UK release).

Reception Reviews of Bombers B-52 mainly focused on the aerial scenes, which during the Cold War era did project a near-propaganda effort, using many period aircraft to depict the era faithfully.Maltin 2009, p. 158. The review in The New York Times was mildly laudatory, describing it as a \\"frank tribute to Air Force nuclear power, laced together with a familiar service feud ... Irving Wallace's dialogue is excellent. Furthermore, his unpretentious scenario is credible and persuasive in training sequences and especially in the hearth scenes\\".\\"'Bombers B-52'; Film at Paramount Stars Karl Malden.\\" The New York Times, November 23, 1957. The performances of the leads was also considered \\"natural\\". Overall, The New York Times critic thought \\"'Bombers B-52' is not [terrific], but it could have been much, much worse\\". Variety gushed that it was \\"magnificently mounted, with breathtaking scenes of the new B-52s\\", while Time magazine more aptly characterized Bombers B-52 as a \\"$1,400,000 want ad for Air Force technicians\\". In other reviews, the dichotomy of 19-year-old Natalie Wood being courted by 40-year-old Efrem Zimbalist Jr. was noted, as well as the attempt to portray a contemporary, if tepid, love story.

Early model GE Talaria light valve video projector. Light from a Xenon arc lamp was modulated by a light valve consisting of a rotating glass disc that was continuously re-coated with a viscous oil. An electron beam similar to the one in a cathode ray tube traced a raster on the surface of the coated glass, deforming the surface of the oil. Where the oil was undisturbed, the light would be reflected into a light trap. The raster traced into the oil formed a diffraction grating. The basic unit was monochrome (PJ7000 line). Color display is accomplished in one of two ways: The single lens color projector (PJ5000 line) use dichroic filters to separate the white light of the xenon bulb in two channels, Green and Magenta. RGB color separation and processing is obtained using vertical wobbulation of the electron beam on the oil film to modulate the green channel and sawtooth modulation is added to the horizontal sweep to separate and modulate Red and Blue channels. The optical system used in the Talaria line is a Schlieren optic like an Eidophor, but the color extraction is much more complex. Two units (MLV) or three units (3LV) are stacked one atop the other, each one devoted to a single color (3LV). In early models (PJ5000), the light source was a 650 watt xenon bulb (sealed beam) similar to the units in modern 35mm film projectors, and produced 250 lumens at a 75:1 contrast ratio. The later 3LV model produced as much as 3500 lumens at a 250:1 contrast ratio. The later LV series had an optional \\"Multiple Personality\\" (MP) module that would allow the projector to display various resolutions and scan rates produced by computers of the time.

Bondi Tsunami is a 2004 feature length Australian indie film directed by Rachael Lucas, inspired by young Japanese tourists who come to Australia on working holiday visas in search of sun and surf. The film plays as a road movie about Japanese surfing culture, told through a series of extended montages set to music, interspersed with poetic zen musings. Much of the film's dialogue is in Japanese, with little English spoken despite the Australian setting. The movie was billed as \\"The first Japanese surfing road movie in Australia.\\" Although unable to secure an official cinema release due to its limited appeal, the film has attracted a cult following based on its controversial style. Two scenes from the Bondi Tsunami were adapted into separate short films, with Beach Route winning the 2003 Port Macquarie Short Film Festival and Gunja Men Ahead in the official selection at the International New York Short Film Festival in 2004. Director Rachael Lucas is an Australian director who claims be at the forefront of the digital guerrilla filmmaking revolution. She is known for her unique visual style and has a background in documentary and music video. Bondi Tsunami is Lucas' first feature as writer/director.Australian Film Commission ‚Äì Bondi Tsunami Premise Shark, a surfer from Japan who is living in Bondi with no apparent direction, expectations or goals decides to join his friend Yuto and set off on a road trip through eastern Australia in a 1961 EK Holden station wagon. As they search for the perfect wave, they meet up with Shark's ex-girlfriend Kimiko, a girl who embodies the Japanese kawaii (or \\"cute\\") culture and the mysterious Gunja Man, who claims to be travelling to Nimbin. The four continue their journey stopping at many pubs, smoking large quantities of cannabis and visiting iconic Australian landmarks, including \\"Big\\" tourist attractions, The Big Pineapple, Big Merino and Big Banana. Cast The cast of the film includes Keita Abe as Yuto, Taki Abe as Shark, Nobuhisa Ikeda as the Gunja Man, and Miki Sasaki as Kimiko.Bondi Tsunami movie review Production and marketing Bondi Tsunami was produced on a microbudget of $150,000, with the funds being sourced from the production team's credit cards Lucas's inspiration for the film came about when she stumbled upon a Subculture of Japanese surfers who modeled themselves on Australian surf brands. Identifying a potential audience for a movie, but with a limited budget and no studio interest Lucas used guerilla tactics to garner publicity for the project, which attracted media interest through the Seven Network and Rolling Stone magazine. Shooting took place at various locations throughout New South Wales and Queensland, with most of the beach scenes being shot on the Central Coast, using improvisation in place of a formal script. Large parts of the film have no dialogue at all, while others are narrated through haiku poetry. None of the cast had any acting experience, nor was a professional film crew used. As an independent foreign language film, Bondi Tsunami was unable to secure a cinema release. Instead, the producers hired a number of theatres around the country and embarked on a national publicity tour. A competition on the film's official website allowed people to vote for the movie to screen in their home town. After receiving the most votes, the town of Cobar was selected for the premiere on 3 September 2004 before the film's official release in Sydney on 23 September. Reception The film was received with mixed reactions from reviewers. Variety magazine reviewer Russell Edwards described Bondi Tsunami as misguided, aimless and amateurish \\"sun-bronzed, but lacklustre imitation of the Japanese slacker flicks which regularly unspool at international fests\\" and was critical of the films production techniques. Megan Spencer of national youth radio network Triple J was more generous in her review, giving the film a rating of 3.5/5, praising it as ambitious and experimental, but noting that its repetitious imagery and style akin to music videos may become tedious to some audiences.

The duo became popular in the late 1990s as members of the second incarnation of the professional wrestling stable D-Generation X. The promotion has described James and Gunn as \\"the most popular duo of WWE's Attitude Era.\\" In the same time period, The New Age Outlaws had the third highest merchandise sales in the WWF after Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock. Upon parting ways with the WWF, the team reformed in several promotions, mostly notably in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling where, under the ringnames B.G. James and Kip James, they performed collectively as the James Gang and then as the Voodoo Kin Mafia, the latter of which was a play on the initials of their former boss in the WWF Vince McMahon. The team returned to periodic active competition in WWE under its original name in 2013 (with both members also having full-time backstage jobs with the company as well). They are six-time tag team champions in WWE, having held the WWF World Tag Team Championship five times and the WWE Tag Team Championship once. The duo hold the record for the most amount of time between title reigns in WWE history after becoming the WWE Tag Team Champions at the 2014 Royal Rumble PPV, more than 14 years after their previous Tag Team title reign. History =World Wrestling Federation= Formation (1997) New Age Outlaws The Outlaws first formed on the October 4, 1997 episode of Shotgun Saturday Night when struggling superstars Billy Gunn and \\"Road Dogg\\" Jesse James, then known as Rockabilly and \\"The Real Double J\\" Jesse James respectively, ended their feud and teamed up. On a later edition of Shotgun, Jesse James walked out to the ring following a loss by Rockabilly and asked him to turn on his manager The Honky Tonk Man and team with him. Rockabilly answered by smashing a guitar on Honky Tonk Man's head and telling James he was in. Rockabilly re-dubbed himself \\"Badd Ass\\" Billy Gunn and Jesse James rechristened himself the Road Dogg. The team made an immediate impact on the WWF tag team scene with blatant attacks against other tag teams and, initially not having an entrance theme, walking out to the ring with only Road Dogg making a rant against their opponents over the PA system. The team became known for pulling wins out of nowhere via cheating and use of weapons. Through their attitude, charisma and antics, they began to get over with the crowd as heels. Tag Team Champions and D-Generation X (1997‚Äì1999) James and Gunn defeated the Legion of Doom for the Tag Team Championship in November 1997. This marked Gunn's fourth Tag Team Title reign and Road Dogg's first. Not only did the team win the titles that night, but they also got their \\"Outlaws\\" nickname when they \\"stole\\" the win and then ran to a waiting car, prompting Raw announcer Jim Ross to liken them to outlaws leaving a robbery. The name stuck and the New Age Outlaws quickly became one of the most hated teams in the WWF. During their feud with LOD, the Outlaws joined Triple H and Shawn Michaels, collectively known as D-Generation X, in assaulting the team on an episode of Monday Night Raw, including shaving off one of Road Warrior Hawk's mohawks and throwing Road Warrior Animal through the announcers' table. Shortly before the Royal Rumble in 1998, the New Age Outlaws began a feud with Mick Foley, first fighting him as Dude Love, then as Mankind and finally Cactus Jack. When it became apparent that he needed help dealing with the Outlaws, Foley brought in Terry Funk as Chainsaw Charlie. Following a disqualification against The Legion of Doom at the Royal Rumble, the team were confronted by DX who told them they needed to start making waves by acting more controversially. In response to this, the Outlaws locked Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a dumpster and threw it off the entrance ramp on to the concrete floor. The Outlaws initially looked concerned, but ultimately attacked their injured rivals in what Foley would describe as \\"one of the funnier examples of bad sportsmanship\\".Foley, Mick; Have A Nice Day; 1999 At WrestleMania XIV, the New Age Outlaws lost the titles to Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie in a Dumpster match. The next night on Raw, however, with the aid of Triple H and X-Pac, the Outlaws regained the title in a steel cage match and officially joined DX. The growing popularity of the \\"new\\" DX quickly turned the group from heels to tweeners, eventually becoming faces, and they feuded with many different tag teams over the course of 1998. Their immense popularity was part of what helped the WWF challenge World Championship Wrestling for ratings supremacy during the Monday Night Wars. They lost the tag title to Kane and Mankind in the summer of 1998, only to regain the titles from that same team at SummerSlam in a handicap match after Kane no-showed. In late 1998 Vince McMahon's Corporation tried to tempt the Outlaws away from DX and failed, which led to the Outlaws losing the title to Corporation members Ken Shamrock and Big Boss Man. Singles competition, reunion and split (1999‚Äì2000) As 1999 started, the Outlaws slowly began to drift apart, with each man striving for singles gold. Road Dogg held both the Hardcore Title and the Intercontinental Championship in the first few months of 1999 (including a successful IC title defense at Wrestlemania XV), and Gunn briefly held the Hardcore title as well. In March, the pair started to team once again, leading to a match with Jeff Jarrett and Owen Hart at Backlash in April. A week later, Gunn turned heel on Road Dogg, resulting in a feud and a match at Over the Edge. The following month, Gunn went on to win the King of the Ring tournament. During the fall of 1999 the Outlaws reunited, first as faces, but then as heels when they rejoined the reformed and now heel DX. No Way Out 2000 saw the final end of the Outlaws when Gunn received a serious arm injury during a match with the Dudley Boyz. Gunn was soon kicked out of DX after \\"losing his cool\\" and getting into a fight with all of the DX members; in reality, he needed to have surgery to repair his torn rotator cuff. Road Dogg was released from his WWF contract in early 2001 due to ongoing drug issues while Gunn was released from his contract in 2004 after eleven years with the company. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling= 3 Live Kru (2002‚Äì2005) On September 18, 2002, \\"Road Dogg\\" Jesse James debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling under his birth name B.G. James. In July 2003, he formed a stable with Konnan and Ron \\"The Truth\\" Killings known as The 3Live Kru (3LK). The trio went on to become fan favorites and eventually won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on two occasions, which they defended collectively under the Freebird Rule. Billy Gunn debuted in TNA at Against All Odds on February 13, 2005, interfering in the NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout between Jeff Jarrett and the challenging Kevin Nash. Gunn struck Nash with a chair, but he was able to kick out of Jarrett's subsequent pin attempt. After Gunn seized the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt in order to strike Nash with it, B.G. James ran to the ring and wrestled it away from him. B.G. James and Gunn, now renamed The New Age Outlaw (later shortened to just The Outlaw), came into conflict once more on April 24, at Lockdown, when Jarrett, The Outlaw and Monty Brown faced Diamond Dallas Page, Sean Waltman and B.G. James (who was replacing an injured Kevin Nash) in a Lethal Lockdown match. Page, Waltman and James were victorious, although during the match James and The Outlaw refrained from fighting one another. Through October and November 2005, \\"The Outlaw\\" (now using the name Kip James, due to threats from the WWE that \\"The Outlaw\\" sounded too similar to their trademarked New Age Outlaws name) helped 3LK numerous times during their feud with Team Canada. Although he was obviously helping the Kru at every turn, Konnan refused to trust Kip. On the November 26 episode of TNA Impact!, and even though Konnan had his doubts, 3LK inducted Kip into the group and renamed themselves the 4Live Kru. At Turning Point, however, Konnan turned on the group, eventually forming his own group, The Latin American Xchange (LAX). Killings also went out on his own afterward, leaving only Kip and B.G. together. The James Gang (2006) On January 14, 2006 Kip James and B.G. James, now calling themselves The James Gang, announced that they had reunited in the face of Konnan and his new group after LAX attacked B.G.'s real-life father \\"Bullet\\" Bob Armstrong. Their official in-ring reunion took place the next night at Final Resolution, where they defeated the Diamonds in the Rough. Their feud with LAX continued and included several more appearances by \\"Bullet\\" Bob Armstrong, including an Arm Wrestling match between Konnan and the 67-year-old Armstrong. In May 2006, The James Gang began a feud with Team 3D over which of them was the greatest tag team. The James Gang picked up a victory over Team 3D at Sacrifice after Kip used a pipe on Brother Devon. They met again at Slammiversary, with Team 3D picking up the win this time. With the teams standing at 1-1 (and Brother Runt returning to in-ring action), Team 3D challenged The James Gang to find themselves a partner and face them (Brother Runt included) in a six-man tag match at Victory Road. Whereas Team 3D expected them to get someone from their family (such as \\"Bullet\\" Bob Armstrong), the James Gang \\"made a deal with the devil\\" and paid James Mitchell to have Abyss team up with them instead. The James Gang and Abyss won the no-disqualification six-man tag match after Abyss Black Hole Slammed Brother Runt onto a table and got the pin. Voodoo Kin Mafia (2006‚Äì2008) On the November 2 edition of Impact!, Kip and B.G. James cut a worked-shoot promo announcing they were quitting the company out of frustration. During the promo B.G. claimed that TNA had mismanaged him during his run there, and as Kip attempted to speak into the microphone it was cut off. Attempts to use an announcers microphone and scream directly to the crowd were met with another microphone cutting and then the show abruptly going to commercial. The Voodoo Kin Mafia (Kip, left, and B.G., right) at TNA Lockdown Interaction in 2007 After a November 11 house show in Connecticut (where World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is based) was canceled, TNA filmed a vignette at WWE headquarters featuring the James Gang discussing the show cancellation, posting it on their website two days later. This vignette was followed with a promo on the November 16 Impact!, during which they announced that they had been given \\"creative control\\", and were changing their name to the Voodoo Kin Mafia (VKM for short, a play on Vincent Kennedy McMahon's initials) and declaring \\"war\\" on WWE. During the \\"war\\" they called out the revived D-Generation X (DX), calling it a \\"failure\\" and stated that the original run was saved by their insertion as The New Age Outlaws in 1998. During their matches and promos on TNA television they continually included references to DX, including use of their signature taunts and maneuvers. Soon a series of vignettes began airing on Impact! with B.G. and Kip in and around Stamford, Connecticut, calling out Paul Levesque, Michael Hickenbottom, and Vince McMahon. During the vignettes they said they were trying to get a cease and desist letter signed and get WWE to stop using the DX name. The vignettes were notable for using the same style of humor as the original DX while running down the revived DX for doing the same thing. When The Hardys reunited for December to Dismember and issued an open challenge the TNA website quickly posted a message from VKM accepting, though it had already been accepted by MNM. On December 1, VKM showed up at a WWE house show at the Knoxville Civic Center with Vince Russo, Jeremy Borash, and a camera crew. They interviewed fans outside, filmed themselves purchasing tickets and eventually entered the building, watching the main event match - featuring DX - from an upper level seat. At December's Turning Point, they performed a parody of DX, then, in response to Jim Ross commenting on his website that Vince McMahon probably would not respond to the \\"war\\", and in response to their still receiving of legal warnings from WWE, they issued a \\"Million Dollar Challenge\\" to Vince McMahon and DX, offering to put up $1 million for a big fight between the DX members and themselves. Hermie Sadler of the UWF promotion later offered to host the \\"Million Dollar Challenge\\" at a UWF show during the weekend of WWE's Armageddon pay-per-view event (scheduled for December 17) citing that his event was close to Richmond, Virginia, the site of Armageddon. After the challenge was ignored, they narrowed it on the January 4 Impact!, challenging just Hickenbottom to meet them at the Alamo in his hometown of San Antonio the following Wednesday. VKM declared themselves victorious in their \\"war\\" during a promo at Final Resolution citing WWE's refusal to acknowledge their presence while fans loudly chanted both \\"TNA\\" and \\"VKM\\" during the January 8 episode of WWE Raw. In the same promo, they entered an angle with Christy Hemme, who declared that women deserve respect in wrestling and found herself heavily disagreed with and mocked by Kip James, while B.G. attempted to agree with her. To shut VKM up, the evil Hemme brought in The Heartbreakers (Antonio Thomas and Romeo Roselli) in to TNA as mystery opponents at Destination X, but VKM made quick work of them. Around this time, Lance Hoyt began hanging around with VKM, keeping Christy Hemme out of VKM's matches. In April, at Lockdown, Hemme had Serotonin face VKM on the pre-show, but again VKM came out victorious. At Sacrifice 2007, VKM lost to Hemme's new team Damaja and Basham formerly known as The Basham Brothers in World Wrestling Entertainment, though not fairly, as Basham and Damaja injured (kayfabe) BG James before the match, making it a handicap match. VKM finally defeated Basham and Damaja at Slammiversary after Kip pinned Basham, but Lance Hoyt turned on VKM after the match. Weeks later, at the Victory Road pay-per-view, VKM debuted a new valet/accomplice, the so-called \\"Voodoo Queen\\" Roxxi Laveaux. She attacked Hemme after VKM's match. On February 21, 2008, Kip turned on his partner by hitting him and his father with a crutch in a tag title match against A.J. Styles and Tomko, thus ending the team. TNA creative writer Vince Russo stated that the Voodoo Kin Mafia ended when Triple H was injured, as there was nowhere else to go with the gimmick. =Return to WWE (2012‚Äì2015, 2018)= The Outlaws during the DX reunion at Raw 1000 On July 23, 2012, the New Age Outlaws returned to WWE on the 1000th episode of Raw to re-unite with X-Pac, Shawn Michaels and Triple H to reform D-Generation X for one night only. On December 17, Billy Gunn and Road Dogg appeared to present the Slammy Award to Jerry Lawler for Comeback of the Year. Starting on December 26 in Detroit at the Joe Louis Arena, the team reunited to face Team Rhodes Scholars in a house show loop. On the March 4, 2013, episode of Old School Raw, the New Age Outlaws competed in their first televised tag team match in WWE since February 2000, where they defeated Primo and Epico. The following week on Raw, the New Age Outlaws answered a challenge to take on Rhodes Scholars, but during the match they were attacked by Brock Lesnar, who was in a feud with Triple H at the time. The New Age Outlaws as the WWE Tag Team Champions in January 2014 On the January 6, 2014, episode of Old School Raw, the Outlaws were in the corner of CM Punk during his match against Roman Reigns. On the January 10 episode of SmackDown, the Outlaws teamed with CM Punk in a six-man tag match against The Shield in a losing effort. On the January 13 episode of Raw, the Outlaws again teamed with Punk in a rematch against The Shield, only to abandon Punk and lose the match, thus turning heel in the process for the first time since 1999. Four days later on SmackDown, they defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Goldust in a non-title match. At the Royal Rumble, the Outlaws defeated Rhodes and Goldust to become WWE Tag Team Champions, their first reign with these particular title, their sixth overall tag team championship reign in WWE and first in over 14 years, marking the longest time between reigns in WWE history. The following night on Raw, Rhodes and Goldust invoked their rematch clause, with the Outlaws retaining the title after losing by disqualification after Brock Lesnar interfered and attacked both Rhodes and Goldust. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Triple H granted Rhodes and Goldust a rematch for the titles in a steel cage match, in which the Outlaws would retain their title. At Elimination Chamber, the Outlaws successfully defended their titles against The Usos, but lost the championship in a rematch to The Usos on the March 3 episode of Raw. The New Age Outlaws, now billed as \\"The Corporate Outlaws\\", teamed with Kane to take on The Shield in a losing effort at WrestleMania XXX. Billy Gunn got injured on the night by a Triple Power Bomb that The Shield delivered to him. He developed hemoptysis and The New Age Outlaws did not appear on Raw and the following night on SmackDown. On January 19, 2015 on Raw, they along with the APA and nWo, returned as faces and attacked The Ascension. This set up a match between the Outlaws and The Ascension at the Royal Rumble. They went on to lose to The Ascension after a Fall of Man on Gunn. At WrestleMania 31 The Outlaws, along with X-Pac and Shawn Michaels, assisted their DX partner Triple H in defeating Sting and also fought against the nWo, who had come to aid Sting. On January 22, 2018 on the 25th anniversary of Raw, The New Age Outlaws got together with DX, and Scott Hall. During the segment, the historic stable established an alliance for one night only, with the B√°lor Club. Later that evening, the B√°lor Club defeated the Revival, and after the match the legends of the past performed on the latter, their classic finishers and signature taunts, with a Shake, Rattle and Roll from Road Dogg and a Famouser from Billy Gunn against Scott Dawson.

The project was run by the Department of Biology at √âcole Polytechnique. The project began on December 28, 2006 and ended in June 2008.  Purpose  Proteins@Home was a large-scale non-profit protein structure prediction project utilizing distributed computing to perform a lot of computations in a small amount of time. From their website: The amino acid sequence of a protein determines its three- dimensional structure, or 'fold'. Conversely, the three-dimensional structure is compatible with a large, but limited set of amino acid sequences. Enumerating the allowed sequences for a given fold is known as the 'inverse protein folding problem'. We are working to solve this problem for a large number of known protein folds (a representative subset: about 1500 folds). The most expensive step is to build a database of energy functions that describe all these structures. For each structure, we consider all possible sequences of amino acids. Surprisingly, this is computationally tractable, because our energy functions are sums over pairs of interactions. Once this is done, we can explore the space of amino acid sequences in a fast and efficient way, and retain the most favorable sequences. This large-scale mapping of protein sequence space will have applications for predicting protein structure and function, for understanding protein evolution, and for designing new proteins. By joining the project, you will help to build the database of energy functions and advance an important area of science with potential biomedical applications.  Statistics  On March 25, 2007, Proteins@Home had 6040 of 9548 users actively participating with a total of 10405 of 15381 computers contributing.

Early life Boyce was born at Beverley, Yorkshire, England, is mother's family were Wesleyans. Boyce studied commerce at Kingston upon Hull. He entered the Wesleyan ministry and in 1830 was sent to Buntingvale, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa with instructions to compile a grammar of the Kaffir language. He did this while working as a missionary and published it in 1834 under the title of A Grammar of the Kafir Language (Spelt with one \\"f\\" in the first edition). A second edition, A Grammar of the Kaffir Language expanded and improved with Vocabulary and Exercises by William J. Davis, was published in 1844, and a third in 1863. Boyce was recalled to England in 1843, serving at a church at Bolton, Lancashire for two years. Australia Boyce was then sent to Australia as general superintendent of the Wesleyan missions. He arrived at Sydney in January 1846, carried on his work vigorously, and was elected president of the first Wesleyan conference held in Australia. In August 1847 he edited and published the weekly Gleaner. He published in 1849 A Brief Grammar of Modern Geography, For the Use of Schools. In 1850 he was appointed one of the original sixteen members of the senate of the University of Sydney and took a special interest in the formation of the university library. Brusque at times, he had little time for 'unthinking parrots who repeat without understanding the dogmas and sayings of the popularities of the day'. In 1859 Boyce resigned and went to England to become one of the general secretaries of foreign missions. He edited in 1874 a Memoir of the Rev. William Shaw, and in the same year appeared Statistics of Protestant Missionary Societies, 1872-3. Boyce returned to Sydney in 1871 and took up church work again. He was a busy man, often doing much lecturing during the week and preaching three times on a Sunday. He also found time to do considerable literary work and brought out two important books, The Higher Criticism and the Bible (1881), and an Introduction to the Study of History (1884). Late life and legacy Early in 1885, at a dinner party in Sydney, he met J. A. Froude, who was much attracted to him (Oceania, p. 195). Working until the end, with his mind in full vigour, Boyce died suddenly at Glebe, Sydney on 8 March 1889 and was buried in the Wesleyan section of Rookwood cemetery. He was married twice (1) to a daughter of James Bowden and (2) to a daughter of the Hon. George Allen and was survived by four daughters by the first marriage. He presented two thousand volumes from his own library to the Wesleyan Theological Institution at Stanmore. Boyce's Grammar of the Kaffir Language had special value as it formed the basis on which much of the study of other South African languages was built. His volume on The Higher Criticism and the Bible, and his Introduction to the Study of History, were both excellent books of their period, and his organizing power was shown in his bringing the Wesleyan Church in Australia to the state when it could free itself from requiring help from the missionary society in England. A grandson, William Ralph Boyce Gibson (1869-1935), was professor of mental and moral philosophy at the university of Melbourne from 1911 to 1934 and was the author of several philosophical works. He was succeeded by his son, Alexander Boyce Gibson, born in 1900. A distant relative, born in 1994, Adam D. Binnington is currently a lecturer of Spanish in the town of Scarborough. Making the Bible Available in African Languages By the year 1800, printed copies of the Bible in whole or in part were available in some 70 languages, but very few of those languages were spoken in Africa. At the time, the African Bantu languages did not have a written form. Things changed when individuals, such as William Boyce from England, went to Africa and lived with people who spoke unwritten languages. Boyce helped to develop a written form of Xhosa, and he, along with others, translated the Gospel of Luke into that language. Published in 1833, this Gospel contained God‚Äôs name. Boyce also discovered the key to the complex grammatical rules that govern not only the Xhosa language but also the complete Bantu-language family. This opened the way for translators to produce the Bible in many other African languages. Today, the Bible or portions of it are available in over 1,000 African languages.

It filmed in Tijuana, Baja California and focuses on the factories on the U.S.-Mexican border.PBS Synopsis The film was made in collaboration with its subjects. Funari and De La Torre established workshops for the woman to learn how to use video equipment to tell their own stories.  Synopsis  The film tells the story of women who live in Tijuana and what their lives are like working in the nearby factory. Carmen Duran, a single mother of three, was denied a severance payment that is legally required. The film also focuses on another protagonist who discusses the environmental damage the factories have done to her town and how things have changed since she was a child, such as the river no longer being safe to play in.Meichsner, Sylvia. \\"Maquilapolis: A film by Vicky Funari and Sergio de la Torre.\\" The Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology, Volume 16, Issue 1. The American Anthropological Association, 2011, pp. 229-231. The women had to endure poor working conditions that impacted themselves and their neighborhoods. The poor conditions include smelling like burned plastic when they leave the factories, being harassed by employers, not being allowed to drink or use the bathroom (leading to kidney problems), not being given severance when the company decided to leave, and chemicals polluting their neighborhoods (leading to health complications such as difficulty breathing, skin rashes, and hives), among other issues.Maquilapolis. Directed by Vicky Funari and Sergio de la Torre, California Newsreel, 2006.  Themes  One of the main themes of the documentary is how the assembly plant industry takes advantage of its employees and denying them basic human rights. Young women are preferred for these factory jobs because they have little experience in politics and labor unions. The film makes a statement about globalism and the cost of workers' lives balanced against cheap costs of production.  Directors  Vicky Funari and Sergio de la Torre are both interested in the agency of these women. To make this more evident, they trained the women in the film to use the cameras and involved them in every step of production. When talking about this decision, Funari had this to say: > Within lefty and liberal progressive filmmaking there‚Äôs all this language > about \\"giving people voice\\" and \\"empowerment,\\" but I don‚Äôt like those ways > of talking because . . . they don‚Äôt question the very real power dynamic > that exists between the filmmaker and the subject. You can‚Äôt remove the > power dynamic, because somebody is going to raise the money, somebody is > going to have the camera and somebody is going to make the decision to make > the film. . . . So I think we‚Äôre trying to find ways to create a > collaboration that acknowledges that this dynamic is present and works with > it. I want my films to embody the power of taking and finding voice, not the > power of bestowing it.Fregoso, Rosa-Linda. \\"Maquilapolis: An Interview with > Vicky Funari and Sergio de la Torre.\\" Camera Obscura 74, vol. 25, no. 2, > 2010, pp. 173-181, Accessed 4 Nov. 2019. In an interview with Rosa-Linda Fregoso, Funari also notes that many of the women in these factories are often portrayed as victims, but she believes that they should be portrayed as survivors. Additionally, De la Torre thinks these women are heroes because of how they continue to work to benefit themselves and their community, despite the adverse conditions they face. Additionally, Funari notes the goal of the documentary: \\"I was interested in women who were aware of their own agency. Everybody has agency, but not every- one is able to talk about it and express what that agency means to them.\\" Basically, these women are working to improve the global economy and change the way it operates. Funari wanted to be a part of questioning this global economy, bringing on change, and telling the stories of the women working on the front line for these changes.

It is the third game in the Drift Out series, and was followed by Neo Drift Out: New Technology; unlike the previous Drift Out '94: The Hard Order, it resembles the first Drift Out and is sometimes referred to as a port or remake for that reason. All races in this video game are based on the 1994 World Rally Championship season. Two different types of background music ('normal' and 'hard' beats) and three racing levels (easy, normal, and hard) are available. The top six times are tracked in each of the rally legs; including the super special stage. A North American release was planned by Accolade, though it was never released. The North American version would have featured fake manufacturer names.Snes Central: Super Drift Out (prototype) Gameplay Impreza WRX) is racing along a dirt road at speeds up to 158 km/h in this rally racing event. The player has to finish among the top six race car drivers at the end of each full round. Failing to complete this task will end the game with premature elimination from the world rally. Licensed rally cars from around the world are included in the game for every car. The only exception is the European edition of Ford Escort due to licensing issues; rally races are never done using the North American model. As a result, the Ford Escort RS Cosworth featured in the game was renamed the \\"Tord Ecorst\\"; this was also done with the previous Drift Out '94: The Hard Order. The first level is intended for the player who is new to the game. If the player beats the game at this level, he will be told to try a harder level and will be given the closing credits. Normal games start at the second level; the full credits are given out after beating the game. However, the player doesn't have to deal with the realities of crashing his or her vehicle yet. The third level is the expert's game because crashes become a clear and present danger at this difficulty level. Crashing the car will send the player back to the start, where the time is reset for another chance (and all automobile damage is fixed). After beating the most difficult level of the game, the full credits are played out and the player achieves full mastery of the game. All three levels can be used in either the world rally mode or the time trial mode. Target times are reduced when a harder level of difficulty is introduced in the race.

Formerly known as \\"Polar Eskimos\\", they are the northernmost group of Inuit, and the world's northernmost people, living in Greenland. Inughuit make up about 1% of the population of Greenland.\\"Inughuit: Orientation.\\" Countries and Their Cultures. Retrieved 25 Feb 2012.  Language  The Inughuit speak Inuktun, also known as North Greenlandic, Thule Inuit, or Polar Eskimo. It is a dialect of Inuktitut, an Eskimo‚ÄìAleut language related to the Greenlandic language spoken elsewhere in Greenland.\\"Inuktitut, Greenlandic.\\" Ethnologue. Retrieved 25 Feb 2012. In Kalaallisut, the official dialect of Greenlandic, Inuktun is called Avanersuarmiutut.  Population  Before 1880, their population was estimated to be between 100 and 200 people. From 1880 to 1930, they were estimated to number 250. In 1980, their estimated population was 700, and it rose to 800 in 2010.  History  = Early history = The Inughuit are believed to be descended from the Thule people who spread across the North American Arctic around the eleventh century. The earliest discovered Thule settlement is found in modern-day Uummannaq. There were also extensive contacts with other Inuit peoples from different regions. Around the 17th century, climate change cooled the northwest areas of Greenland which cut off the Inughuit from other Inuit and regions. It was during this time that the Inughuit developed their unique language, culture, and fashion which differs significantly from other Inuit peoples. Around this period, the Inughuit also lost the ability and skills to built kayaks or umiaks, which inevitably further restricted travel and contact with other communities. = Modern history = The Inughuit were first contacted by Europeans in 1818, when John Ross led an expedition into their territory. Ross dubbed them \\"Arctic Highlanders\\". They are believed to have previously lived in total isolation, to the point of being unaware of other humans, and are cited as one of the only non-agricultural societies to live without armed feuds or warfare, a state that continued after contact.; (book article) Erik Holtved, a Dane, was the first university-trained ethnologist to study the Inughuit., pages=323‚Äì5 During the mid-19th century, Inuit from Baffin visited and lived with the Inughuits. The Baffin Inuit reintroduced some technologies lost to the Inughuit like boats, fishing leister, and bows and arrows. The Inughuit in their part taught the Baffin Inuit a more advanced form of sled technology. American and European explorers in the 19th and early-20th centuries had extensive contacts with the Inughuits. Explorers like Robert Peary and Frederick Cook both had Inughuits in their teams acting as guides. However, more sustained contact with outsiders changed many aspects of Inughuit life like a dependence on trade goods and the introduction of new diseases which the Inughuit had no immunity to. Greenlandic anthropologist and explorer Knud Rasmussen established a trading post in Uummannaq in 1910. He also worked to modernize Inughuit society like establishing a governing hunter's council for the Inughuit in 1927. It was during this period that Christian missionaries arrived in the region to evangelize. In consequence of the relative isolation of the Inughuit, they remained absent from growing Greenlandic Inuit nationalism and the nation-building process sweeping the Inuit of western and southern Greenland. The subsequent Cold War era had substantial effects on the Inughuit. In the 1950s, the United States established an Air Force Base close to Uummannaq. This forced many Inughuits to move over north towards Qaanaaq, which proved disastrous to the cultural and social life of the Inughuit.  Settlements  Inughuit people live north of the Arctic Circle on the west coast of Greenland, between 75¬∞‚Äî80¬∞ N and 58¬∞‚Äì74¬∞ W. The northernmost settlement was at the village of Etah (at 78¬∞ 19' N), but it was abandoned due to the extremely harsh conditions there. The northernmost constant settlement is now Hiurapaluk. Pituffik, also known as \\"Dundas\\" or \\"Thule\\" to Europeans, was the chief settlement of the Inughuit until 1953 when it was displaced by the United States' Thule Air Base, with its residents relocated to Qaanaaq. Established in 1953, Qaanaaq is the largest Inughuit settlement.

The Midlands Media Group, LLC station is licensed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to broadcast at 93.1 MHz with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 2.1 kW. History The station signed on the air on August 5, 1965 as WBLR-FM, the sister station to WBLR 1430 AM, located in Batesburg-Leesville. At the time, WBLR-FM was located on 92.1 FM and had featured a middle of the road (MOR) format. In 1979, in order to accommodate a class/power increase for WTWE --Manning, WWBD--Bamberg was moved from 92.7 to 92.1, which required WBLR-FM to move from 92.1 to 95.3. As a result, WBLR-FM became WKWQ-FM when it moved. In the beginning, WKWQ-FM had featured a country music format, but changed to album rock as \\"K-95 Rock\\" in 1986 and started to target nearby Columbia. In 1988, the station changed again to urban contemporary as \\"Hot 95\\" in an attempt to compete with urban powerhouse WWDM, but failed. During this period, the tower was moved closer to Columbia. WKWQ moved from 95.3 to 93.1 in early 1991. The station was re-launched as K-93, but was handicapped by underfunded ownership. The station eventually went to satellite programming using Satellite Music Network's \\"The Touch\\" Adult Urban Contemporary format and was paired with sister station WKSO (now known as WHXT) located in Orangeburg. This arrangement lasted until 1999 when WKWQ broke off from the simulcast with WKSO and flipped to Urban Oldies as \\"Majik 93.1\\", taking the new call letters of WZMJ. Unfortunately, Majic 93.1 never took off due to strong competition from Jammin' Oldies outlet WSCQ (now known as WXBT), which launched a few months later. In 2000, the format was changed to Beach Music. The station, as well as sister urban contemporary outlet, WHXT was sold in 2003 to Inner City Broadcasting. Shortly after the sale, the station changed format to Young Country as 93.1 The Hound. Although it was designed as a flanker to protect sister station WWDM from Clear Channel Communications's country outlet WCOS-FM from being #1 in the ratings, 93.1 The Hound managed to gain a small audience. However, in 2005, after the sign-on of Double O Radio's New Country outlet WWNU, sister AM's WOIC ESPN Radio format moved to WZMJ, while WOIC was re- launched as an Air America Radio outlet. On July 27, 2012, Lake Murray Communications, LLC took ownership of the station from bankrupted ICBC Broadcast Holdings and changed it to its current variety adult hits format, branded as \\"Z93 The Lake\\". The format features a wide variety of classic hits, classic rock & roll, oldies, Motown, and current adult contemporary hits. The Z93 music format was created by Mike Willis, a 40-year radio veteran, station owner & President/CEO of Lake Murray Communications, LLC. According to Willis, \\"The format is a product of my early broadcasting and radio station influences, such as WBBQ Augusta, Georgia; WKZQ Myrtle Beach; WLS Chicago; WABC & WNBC NYC; WLAC Nashville; and WOWO Ft.

Although such traps have been employed for many purposes in physics research, they are best known as the last stage in cooling atoms to achieve Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation. The magnetic trap (as a way of trapping very cold atoms) was first proposed by David E. Pritchard.  Operating principle  Many atoms have a magnetic moment; their energy shifts in a magnetic field according to the formula :\\\\Delta E = - \\\\vec{\\\\mu} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{B}. According to the principles of quantum mechanics the magnetic moment of an atom will be quantized; that is, it will take on one of certain discrete values. If the atom is placed in a strong magnetic field, its magnetic moment will be aligned with the field. If a number of atoms are placed in the same field, they will be distributed over the various allowed values of magnetic quantum number for that atom. If a magnetic field gradient is superimposed on the uniform field, those atoms whose magnetic moments are aligned with the field will have lower energies in a higher field. Like a ball rolling down a hill, these atoms will tend to occupy locations with higher fields and are known as \\"high-field-seeking\\" atoms. Conversely, those atoms with magnetic moments aligned opposite the field will have higher energies in a higher field, tend to occupy locations with lower fields, and are called \\"low-field-seeking\\" atoms. It is impossible to produce a local maximum of the magnetic-field magnitude in free space; however, a local minimum may be produced. This minimum can trap atoms which are low-field-seeking if they do not have enough kinetic energy to escape the minimum. Typically, magnetic traps have relatively shallow field minima and are only able to trap atoms whose kinetic energies correspond to temperatures of a fraction of a kelvin. The field minima required for magnetic trapping can be produced in a variety of ways. These include permanent magnet traps, Ioffe configuration traps, QUIC traps and others. Microchip atom trap ILS in 2005 The minimum magnitude of the magnetic field can be realized with the \\"atom microchip\\". One of the first microchip atomic traps is shown on the right. The Z-shaped conductor (actually the golden Z-shaped strip painted on the Si surface) is placed into the uniform magnetic field (the field's source is not shown in the figure). Only atoms with positive spin-field energy were trapped. To prevent the mixing of spin states, the external magnetic field was inclined in the plane of the chip, providing the adiabatic rotation of the spin at the movement of the atom. In the first approximation, magnitude (but not orientation) of the magnetic field is responsible for effective energy of the trapped atom. The chip shown is 2 cm x 2 cm; this size was chosen for ease in manufacture. In principle, the size of such microchip traps can be drastically reduced. An array of such traps can be manufactured with conventional lithographic methods; such an array is considered a prototype of a q-bit memory cell for the quantum computer. Ways of transferring atoms and/or q-bits between traps are under development; the adiabatic optical (with off-resonant frequencies) and/or the electrical control (with additional electrodes) is assumed.  Applications in Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation  Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation (BEC) requires conditions of very low density and very low temperature in a gas of atoms. Laser cooling in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) is typically used to cool atoms down to the microkelvin range. However, laser cooling is limited by the momentum recoils an atom receives from single photons. Achieving BEC requires cooling the atoms beyond the limits of laser cooling, which means the lasers used in the MOT must be turned off and a new method of trapping devised. Magnetic traps have been used to hold very cold atoms, while evaporative cooling has reduced the temperature of the atoms enough to reach BEC.

Early life Boyce was the son of Francis Boyce, an accountant, and his wife Frances, n√©e Dunsford. He was born at Tiverton, Devonshire, England and was brought by his parents to Australia in the Earl of Charlemont and, after being shipwrecked off Barwon Heads, Victoria, arrived at Sydney in August 1853. Boyce was educated at St James Grammar School and at a private school kept by James Keane, and, his father having died in January 1858, entered the service of the Union Bank of Australia in the following December, and was with the bank for eight years. Clerical career Boyce decided to enter the Church of England and went to Moore Theological College, Liverpool, at the beginning of 1867, was ordained deacon in December 1868 by Bishop Barker and priest on 19 December 1869. His first parish was George's Plains near Bathurst, New South Wales, followed by Molong in 1873 and Orange from 1875. Boyce was a hard-working and enthusiastic country clergyman, he travelled many miles on horseback to reach his people; he also raised money to build churches where no church had been before. The church built at Orange cost ¬£7000, had accommodation for 600 people, and few seats were vacant when Boyce was holding the service. In April 1882 he went to Pyrmont, an industrial area, and in 1884 to St Paul's, Redfern. He remained there for 46 years, was elected a canon of St Andrew's cathedral in December 1899, and in 1910 was appointed archdeacon of West Sydney. St Paul's, Redfern, when Boyce went to it was socially a mixed parish. In George- and Pitt-streets there were many wealthy people, while on the western side of the railway line there was a dense population and part of it was a slum area. Boyce had for some time shown much interest in the temperance question and was active in fights for local option and the earlier closing of hotels. When the New South Wales Alliance was founded in 1882 he was the first secretary and afterwards was its president for over 20 years. He published a volume titled The Drink Problem in Australia (1893), and later brought out other publications on religious and temperance questions. He was much distressed by the poverty of some parts of his parish and especially the position of men and women too old to work. He believed in old-age pensions, and on 9 September 1895 wrote to the Sydney Daily Telegraph advocating the appointment of a committee to inquire into and report on this question. Early in 1896 he called a meeting to form a pensions league. J. C. Neild had also been advocating the granting of pensions in parliament, and eventually a committee was appointed which recommended that pensions should be paid out of the public revenue. Boyce worked hard to keep the question before the public, but it was not until the end of the 19th century that pensions became law. The first pensions were paid on 1 July 1901. Boyce was an ardent Imperialist, and when the question of having an Empire Day was raised in 1902 he supported the suggestion with enthusiasm. He was spokesman of a deputation which waited on Sir Edmund Barton, the prime minister, and he continued his efforts for it until it was founded on 24 May 1905. Boyce was first president of the British Empire League in Australia in 1901 and also in 1909-11. Late life At meetings of the synod of the diocese of Sydney, Boyce took an important part, and he continued active work in his parish until extreme old age. He resigned his arch-deaconry in 1930 and died at Blackheath, New South Wales on 27 May 1931. He was married twice; firstly to Caroline, daughter of William Stewart, who died in 1918, and secondly to Mrs Ethel Burton, who survived him, with two sons by the first marriage. The elder son, Francis Stewart Boyce (1872-1940), became a KC in 1924 and a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1932. Honours Mount Boyce is named in honour of Venerable Archdeacon Boyce. Memorials to Boyce were placed in the Sydney and Bathurst cathedrals and his portrait by Julian Ashton was presented to the National Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1917. His memoirs were published posthumously in 1934 as Four-Score Years and Seven.

Activated in New Caledonia on 3 October 1942. Detachments of the group, which was assigned to Thirteenth Air Force in January 1943, were sent to Guadalcanal, where they used Bell P-39 and P-400 Airacobra aircraft to fly protective patrols, support ground forces, and attack Japanese shipping. Operational squadrons of the 347th FG were the 67th, 68th, 70th and 339th Fighter Squadrons. When the Allied campaign to recover the central and northern Solomon Islands began in February 1943, the detachments, still operating from Guadalcanal and using Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and P-39 Airacobras, escorted bombers and attacked enemy bases on New Georgia, the Russell Islands, and Bougainville. It was P-38Gs of the 339th Fighter Squadron which, on 18 April 1943, flew the mission which resulted in the death of Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Only their aircraft possessed the range to intercept and engage. Pilots were informed that they were intercepting an \\"important high officer,\\" although they were not aware of who their actual target was. On the morning of 18 April, despite urgings by local commanders to cancel the trip for fear of ambush, Yamamoto's planes left Rabaul as scheduled. Shortly after, eighteen specially fitted P-38s took off from Guadalcanal. They wave-hopped most of the 430 miles to the rendezvous point, maintaining radio silence throughout. At 09:34 Tokyo time, the two flights met and a dogfight ensued between the P-38s and the six Zeroes escorting Yamamoto. 1st Lt. Rex T. Barber engaged the first of the two Japanese bombers, which turned out to be Yamamoto's plane. He sprayed the plane with gunfire until it began to spew smoke from its left engine. Barber turned away to attack the other bomber as Yamamoto's plane crashed into the jungle. Afterwards, another pilot, Capt Thomas George Lanphier, Jr., claimed he had shot down the lead bomber, which led to a decades-old controversy until a team inspected the crash site to determine direction of the bullet impacts. Most historians now credit Barber with the claim. One US pilot‚Äî1st Lt. Raymond K. Hine‚Äîwas killed in action. Headquarters moved up from New Caledonia at the end of 1943; and the following month the group moved from Guadalcanal to Stirling Island to support ground forces on Bougainville, assist in neutralizing enemy bases at Rabaul, and fly patrol and search missions in the northern Solomons. The 347th was reassigned to New Guinea in August 1944, and equipped completely with P-38G's. Escorted bombers to oil refineries on Borneo; bombed and strafed airfields and installations on Ceram, Amboina, Boeroe, Celebes, and Halmahera. Received a Distinguished Unit Citation for a series of long-range bombing and strafing raids, conducted through intense flak and fighter defense, on the airfield and shipping at Makassar, Celebes, in November 1944. Moved to the Philippines in February 1945. Supported landings on Mindanao in March 1945: bombed and strafed enemy installations and supported Australian forces on Borneo, attacked Japanese positions in northern Luzon, and flew escort missions to the Asiatic mainland. The 347th Fighter Group was reassigned back to the United States in December 1945, and inactivated on 1 January 1946. Cold War =Occupied Japan= Northrop F-61B-20-NO Black Widow Serial 43-8237 of the 68th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron flying over Japan, 1949. This was one of the last USAF active duty Black Widows. The unit was redesignated as the 347th Fighter Wing (All Weather) and reactivated in Japan on 20 February 1947 as part of Far East Air Forces 315th Composite Wing to perform air defense duties. The wing was assembled from three former Northrop F-61B Black Widow night fighter squadrons, the 6th, 418th, and 421st. The squadrons were redesignated the 339th, 4th, and 68th squadrons, respectively. In August 1948, their designations were changed to Fighter (All Weather) Squadron to more closely identify their mission. The 4th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron was deployed and attached to the 51st Fighter Group at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa. The useful life of the F-61 was extended due to the Air Force's problems in fielding a jet-powered night/all-weather fighter. The Curtiss XP-87/XF-87 Blackhawk was the planned replacement, however problems in development led the Black Widow to be replaced by another propeller-driven fighter, the North American F-82F/G Twin Mustang. The Twin Mustangs started to arrive during mid-1949 and 1950. The 347th was the last active duty USAF unit to fly the Black Widow, the 339th FS retiring its last F-61 in May 1950, missing the Korean War by only a month. =Korean War= North American F-82G Twin Mustang Serial 46-394 of the 68th Fighter (All Weather) Squadron flying a night interceptor mission over the wartime skies of Korea, 1951. As the war in Korea began, on 24 June 1950 the 347th Fighter Wing was inactivated and the 347th Fighter Group's Twin Mustang squadrons were transferred to South Korea. They were the only fighter aircraft available with the range to cover the entire Korean peninsula. The 339th Squadron was attached to the 8th Fighter Wing at Kimpo Airfield, near Seoul South Korea to stem the North Korean advance. The 68th Fighter (AW) Squadron was based at Itazuke, Japan. The 4th (AW) Squadron was reassigned to the provisional 6302d Air Base Group and provided air defense of Japan and the Ryukyu Islands. The 347th Fighter Group provided fighter cover for the C-54 and C-47 transports flying in and out of Kimpo Airfield. On 27 June 1950, an F-82G (46‚Äì383) of the 68th Fighter (AW) Squadron flown by Lieut. William (Skeeter) Hudson (pilot) and Lieut. Carl Fraser (radar operator) shot down a North Korean Yak-7U (possibly a misidentified Yak-11). This was the first air-to-air kill of the Korean War, and, incidentally, the first aerial victory by the newly formed United States Air Force. It is believed that Lt. Hudson was flying an F-82G named \\"Bucket of Bolts\\" (46‚Äì601) instead of his usual aircraft on that historic day. Later that same day, an F-82G (46‚Äì392) flown by Major James Little of the 339th Fighter (AW) Squadron of the 347th Fighter Group shot down a North Korean Yak-9. Records are unreliable, and some experts maintain that Major Little actually was the first to kill. The 339th and 68th Fighter (AW) Squadrons served in South Korea until December 1950, being attached to the 8th FBW, 35th FIW, and 51st FIW. As more jets, especially the all-weather Lockheed F-94 Starfire, became available the F-82s were deligated to ground attack missions before eventually being withdrawn from the Korean Theater, modified, and reassigned to bomber escort duties at Ladd AFB, Alaska. With their F-82's reassigned to Alaska, the 347th Fighter Group was inactivated and stood down. =Japan= The 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Yokota Air Base, Japan in December 1967 as part of Fifth Air Force. In Japan, the wing performed tactical fighter training missions, aerial reconnaissance, and contingency operations. Its operational squadrons were the following: * 34th Tactical Fighter: (Deployed June 1968 ‚Äì March 1971) * 35th Tactical Fighter: 10 June 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971 (TC: GG, Red fin caps) * 36th Tactical Fighter: 15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 May 1971. (TC: GL, Blue fin caps) * 80th Tactical Fighter: 15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 February 1971 (TC: GR, Yellow fin caps) * 556th Tactical Reconnaissance: 1 July 1968 ‚Äì 15 May 1971 Martin EB/RB-57E Canberra, Lockheed C-130B-II, Sun Valley) (B-57 Tail Code: GT, C-130Bs uncoded) The 35th, 36th, and 80th TFS were equipped with the McDonnell-Douglas F-4C Phantom IIs and flew tactical fighter training missions. The 556th flew various electronic warfare and special operations sorties of a classified nature. The 34th TFS was in a deployed status to the 388th TFW, Korat RTAFB, Thailand. 347th F-4C aircrews would rotate TDY to and from the 34th TFS. Squadron transferred permanently to the 388th TFW, March 1971. In 1971 the US and Japan agreed that all combat squadrons based at Yokota were to be reassigned and Yokota became a non-flying station hosted by the 475th Air Base Wing. 35th TFS aircraft were transferred to 67th TFS/18th TFW, Kadena Air Base Okinawa. The 36th and 80th TFS aircraft were transferred to 3d TFW, Kusan AB, South Korea. The 554th TRS's B-57s were reassigned to the 363d TRW at Shaw AFB, South Carolina. The C-130s were retained at Yokota and reassigned to the incoming 475th Air Base Wing. The 347th TFW was inactivated in place in May 1971 prior to reassignment to the United States. =Mountain Home AFB= General Dynamics F-111F (S/N 70-2366), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho. The 347th was reactivated and reequipped with factory-fresh General Dynamics F-111F Aardvarks, replacing the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing as host unit at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho in May 1971. Operational squadrons of the wing were: * 391st Tactical Fighter (July 1971 ‚Äì October 1972) (Tail Code: MO) * 4589th Tactical Fighter (July 1971 ‚Äì October 1971) (Tail Code: MP) 389th Tactical Fighter (October 1971 ‚Äì October 1972) (Tail Code: MP/MO) * 4590th Tactical Fighter (July 1971 ‚Äì June 1972) (Tail Code: MQ) 390th Tactical Fighter (June ‚Äì October 1972) (Tail Code: MO) The 4589th/4590th TFS were provisional units, pending the transfer of the 389th and 390th TFSs from the 12th and 366th TFWs in Southeast Asia. All three squadrons adopted the MO tail code under the common wing concept in June 1972. The 347th had a short stay at Mountain Home, conducting F-111F training until October 1972, when it was replaced by the 366th TFW which moved from Takhli RTAFB, Thailand to Mountain Home. Upon its arrival, the 366th absorbed all the people and equipment of the 347th. =Takhli RTAFB= On 30 July 1973 the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, inheriting two squadrons of F-111As from the 474th Tactical Fighter Wing, which ended its TDY at Takhli from Nellis AFB, Nevada. These were: * 428 Tactical Fighter (Tail Code: HG ‚Äì Red Tail Fin) * 429 Tactical Fighter (Tail Code: HG ‚Äì Yellow Tail Fin) General Dynamics F-111A Serial 67-081 of the 422d FWS taken at Nellis AFB Nevada in 1975 still showing its 347th TFW tail code (HG). It remained in USAF service with various wings until being retired to AMARC on 21 June 1991. For a brief two-week period the 347th flew combat operations into Cambodia until 15 August, when the last wartime mission of the Vietnam Era was flown for final mission of Constant Guard. After the ceasefire, the wing was maintained in a combat-ready status for possible contingency actions. During January 1974 the Secretary of Defense announced a realignment of Thailand resources, with the final pullout of air resources by the end of 1976. In June 1974, two F-111s from the 347th TFW flew from Takhli to Osan Air Base South Korea and conducted live weapons demonstrations for Republic of Korea and US officials at Nightmare Range. Takhli RTAFB was returned to the Royal Thai Air Force in July 1974, with the 347th inactivating in place. =Korat RTAFB= With the return of Takhli to the Royal Thai Air Force, the two F-111 squadrons (428th, 429th TFS) of the 347th were transferred to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base. The 347th TFW was activated in place on 12 July 1974. At Korat, the 347th performed training readiness missions. It participated in the recovery of the SS Mayaguez, an American merchant ship, from the Khmer Rouge Cambodians, 13‚Äì14 May 1975. On 30 June 1975, the two F-111A squadrons were inactivated. The aircraft were sent to the 422d Fighter Weapon Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 347th TFW was reassigned to Moody AFB, Georgia. =Moody AFB= McDonnell Douglas F-4E-39-MC Phantom Serial 68-0447 of the 70th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 1984. This aircraft was retired to AMARC in 1991. Squadron COs' F-16As of the 347th TFW's 68th, 69th and 70th TFS in formation with the 347th wing flagship. On 1 December 1975 the 347th Tactical Fighter Wing was reactivated at Moody AFB, Georgia as a tactical fighter wing under Tactical Air Command. Operational fighter squadrons at Moody were: * 68th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: MY, Red tail stripe) * 69th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: MY, Silver tail stripe) * 70th Tactical Fighter Squadron (Tail Code: MY, Blue/White checkered tail stripe) The 347th flew the McDonnell-Douglas F-4E until 1988, upgrading to the Block 15 General Dynamics F-16A/B. In 1990 the wing upgraded again to the Block 40 F-16C/D. Moody won the Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award for 1991, and the 1994 Verne Orr Award, which is presented by the Air Force Association to the unit that most effectively uses human resources to accomplish its mission. In June 1997, the 347th TFW was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the eighth time in its illustrious history. On 1 October 1991, the 347th TFW was redesignated the 347th Fighter Wing. On 1 June 1992 the 347th FW was assigned to the newly activated Air Combat Command. As a result of the August 1992 destruction of Homestead AFB Florida by Hurricane Andrew, the 31st Fighter Wing's 307th and 308th Fighter Squadrons were initially evacuated to Moody AFB prior to the hurricane making landfall. With Homstead unusable for an extended period after the hurricane, on 20 November the squadrons were permanently assigned to the 347th TFW. On 1 April 1994, the 308th FS was moved without personnel or equipment to the 56th Fighter Wing at Luke AFB, Arizona, replacing the 311th FS. The squadrons Block 40 F-16s were sent to USAFE. On 1 July 1994, the Air Force redesignated the 347th Fighter Wing to the 347th Wing, a force projection, air/land composite wing. Squadrons of the 347th Wing were: * 52d Airlift Squadron (C-130E) (green tail stripe ‚Äì ROOS) Transferred from inactivated 63d MAW, Norton AFB, California 1 May 1994. Was a C-141B squadron at Norton. * 68th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) (red tail stripe ‚Äì LANCERS) * 69th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) (black tail stripe ‚Äì WEREWOLVES) * 70th Fighter Squadron (A/OA ‚Äì 10A) (blue/white tail stripe ‚Äì WHITE KNIGHTS) * 307th Fighter Squadron (F-16C/D) (black tail stripe ‚Äì STINGERS) The 307th FS was inactivated on 31 August 1995 when F-16 operations at Moody were reduced in size. On 1 April 1997 the 347th Wing added a search-and-rescue component with the addition of the 41st Rescue Squadron with HH-60G helicopters and the 71st Rescue Squadron with specialized HC-130P aircraft from Patrick AFB, Florida. To make room for these squadrons, the 52d Airlift Squadron was inactivated, with its C-130s being transferred to the 71st RQS. The F-16s of the 347th began to be transferred out as the \\"Composite Wing\\" concept ended at Moody. The 70th FS was inactivated on 30 June 2000. The 69th FS was inactivated on 2 February 2001, and the 68th FS was inactivated on 1 April. The F-16s were transferred to various active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard squadrons both in the CONUS as well as overseas. On 1 May 2001, the 347th Wing stood down as a composite wing and stood up as the 347th Rescue Wing, becoming the Air Force's only active-duty combat search and rescue wing. The 347th RQW was transferred from ACC to the Air Force Special Operations Command on 1 October 2003.

A representative of Naturalism in Portugal, he wrote, among others, O Bar√£o de Lavos and O Livro de Alda, the first two titles in his \\"Patologia Social\\" series. In 1911, he took part in the commission that selected and approved the draft of what would become the current flag of Portugal. Biography Botelho was born in Tabua√ßo, a small town in Portugal's Douro region, son of Lu√≠s Carlos de Almeida Botelho, an infantry major and a high school teacher in Vila Real and Maria Preciosa de Azevedo Leit√£o, a mother descendant of wealthy farmers. His father had intended him to attend a university course, but his premature death (Botelho lost his father at 12 years old) dictated another direction in the career of the young Abel. As a teen he attended the Military College in Lisbon from 1867 to 1872, joining Escola Polit√©cnica de Lisboa up until 1876. Between 1876 and 1878 he attended the General Staff course at the military academy, beginning in the arms career as a simple private soldier, he climbed the highest ranks of the army, having become a colonel. He married in 1881 to a lady of noble origin. Among other functions, he served as chief of staff of the First Military Division (Lisbon). He belonged to several associations (Academy of Sciences, Association of Portuguese Journalists and Writers (both in Lisbon and Porto), Press Association, Geographical Society of Lisbon, presented in S√£o Paulo in 1910 on the occasion of a Geography congress where he served as a delegate, among others). In 1911 he was appointed Minister of Portugal in Buenos Aires, at that time a position of great importance to which some authors say it significantly contributed to Argentina being the first country to recognize the Portuguese Republic after the republican establishment in 1910. He continued to work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as minister of the Portuguese Republic in Argentina up until his death in 1917 on the pinnacle of World War I. Literature His literary career began in 1885, with a book of verses called Lira Insubmissa. The following year, he released Germano, a drama in five acts, in verse. Proposed to the directorate of the National Theater, this play was refused. A controversy arose after Botelho wrote an article adressing those responsible for not accepting his play. From then on he wrote other plays: Jacunda (comedy in three acts; 1895), Claudina (comedy in three acts; performed at the Teatro do Pr√≠ncipe Real in Lisbon, at the artistic party of actress Lucinda Sim√µes, on 18 March 1890), Vencidos da Vida (satirical play, performed on March 23, 1892 at Teatro do Gin√°sio; three acts), Parnaso (lyrical play, in verse, in an act, written for the students' recital, for the benefit of Aid Box for Poor Students, held at the S√£o Carlos Theater, on May 3, 1894), Fruta do Tempo (comedy, written for the actress Lucinda Sim√µes; 1904). Being of a generally scabrous, delicate subject, as Naturalism demanded, these pieces caused agitation, especially Imacul√°vel, which ended in riots and crowds, and Vencidos da Vida, who could not continue on the scene for what contained criticism of the literary group of the same name, and for being considered immoral, creating a controversy between Botelho and those responsible for the ban. In 1891, Abel Botelho began the study of Portuguese society in the series \\"Patologia Social\\", a demanding and scientific examination of the general bad that infested Portugal, especially Lisbon, the capital and the most prestigious urban center. The first book, O Bar√£o de Lavos (1891) was supposedly the first novel in Portuguese with a homosexual plot. It was followed by O Livro de Alda (1898), Amanh√£ (1901), Fatal Dilema (1907) and Pr√≥spero Fortuna (1910). In addition to these, he left three more novels: Sem Rem√©dio... (1900), Os L√°zaros (1904), and Amor Crioulo (incomplete and posthumous; previously titled Id√≠lio Triste; 1919) and the short story Mulheres da Beira (1898; previously published on Di√°rio de Not√≠cias between 1895 and 1896, and which served as inspiration for the 1921 film of the same name). He also collaborated in several periodical publications, namely in the magazines Brasil-Portugal (1899-1914), Ser√µes (1901-1911), Azulejos (1907-1909) and Atl√¢ntida (1915-1920).

The band was composed of guitarist and singers Doyle Bramhall II and Charlie Sexton and two former members of Stevie Ray Vaughan's band Double Trouble, drummer Chris Layton and bassist Tommy Shannon. The 'Arc' in the band's name came from the Austin Rehearsal Complex where the band first started jamming.According to Bob Meredith of Allmusic. History Their 1992 debut album, Arc Angels, met with critical approval and reached No. 127 on the Billboard chart. Arc Angels made their network television debut on the NBC show Late Night with David Letterman on June 9, 1992, performing \\"Living In A Dream\\". They performed on the show again on January 6, 1993, this time playing \\"Too Many Ways to Fall\\". Bramhall's heroin addiction and internal friction caused the breakup of the band in 1993. The Arc Angels broke up in October of that year, concluding their run with a series of farewell concerts at Austin's Backyard outdoor venue. Beginning in 2002, the Arc Angels reunited for occasional live performances. In recent years, Bramhall has played guitar in Eric Clapton's band and toured with Roger Waters. Charlie Sexton has toured with Bob Dylan. Meanwhile, Layton and Shannon have recorded three albums with the Texas soul quintet Storyville. They have also backed such artists as Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd and John Mayer. In March 2009, the members of Arc Angels, minus Shannon, announced that they would be reuniting, releasing a live album and DVD of concert footage/audio taken during 2005, touring extensively and beginning work on their second album. The album/DVD \\"Living in a Dream\\" was released in 2009, containing live renditions of previously released Arc Angels songs, new songs performed live and three new studio tracks. The launch of their tour was at Austin's annual South by Southwest Festival. Although the band never officially broke up again, members pursued solo projects and there have been no talks about future Arc Angels releases or concerts to this date. In 2014 while on stage Bramhall referred to the Arc Angels as \\"this band I was in\\" further cementing their demise.

The school requires entrance exams for admission (with a 10% acceptance rate). Tran Dai Nghia High School ranks seventeenth nationally in the 2012 Vietnam university admission ranking, and ranks third amongst Ho Chi Minh City high schools. School establishment Founded in 2000, the school was named after Professor Tr·∫ßn ƒê·∫°i Nghƒ©a, a scientist and weapon engineer who invented the Vietnamese bazooka and SKZ recoilless rifle during the Vietnam War. The school was set up by repurposing existing facilities of the Lasantaberd Institute, which was established in 1877. It was the first school to have Intensive English program in H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh City. 2003 marked the school's first graduating class. School facilities The school has many academic facilities, including a library, 2 computer labs, an audiovisual room and a multimedia room. The school also contains one dining hall, a canteen and rooms for students to rest between classes. The school also has two basketball courts, three badminton courts as well as a volleyball court. In addition there are some basketball half-courts for students to practice inside the school ground. There are 6 blocks in the school: the main block in the center for the school managing board; 5 A, B, C, D, E blocks for classrooms. Additionally, block E is also used as a dining hall. As the number of students has been increasing every year, the number of classrooms and teachers has also risen. In 2015, the school opened the second center, at District 2 for only grades 6-7. With this, the entrance exam now accept 525-600 students each year instead of the previous 300-400 students per year. The new center includes 1 computers-lab room with 50 computers. Two out of 4 vice-principals are now working at center 2. Because the second center is located in a remote area, there is shuttle service to help transfer students between the 2 centers at the cost of 400.000VND (~$17.58) Library In 2019, the school opened a free library for all student.

In addition, classes of grade 10, 11 and 12 are ranged in to specializing classes such as English majoring class, Math majoring class, Literature majoring class, Chemistry majoring class, Physics majoring class and Biology majoring class. There are also triple- subjected classes: Math-Chemistry-Physics and Math-Literature-English classes. A growing number of study abroad scholarships are won by students, a fact on which the school prides itself. Class schedule The school is a semi- boarding one in which students stay from 7:00 am to 4:30 pm for grade 8-12. Grade 6-7 stay from 7:30 am to 3:45 pm. Classes are broken into 4 periods for grade 6-9 students and 5 periods for the rest in the morning. In the afternoon, classes start at 1:15 and usually last until 4:30, with a break from 2:45-3:00. On Saturday, students in selection teams gather to take extra classes on the subject they major. After that, they can go home or attend some outdoor activities.

It falls within the class of finite element methods.  Introduction  The hybrid Trefftz finite-element method has been considerably advanced since its introduction about 30 years ago. The conventional method of finite element analysis involves converting the differential equation that governs the problem into a variational functional from which element nodal properties ‚Äì known as field variables ‚Äì can be found. This can be solved by substituting in approximate solutions to the differential equation and generating the finite element stiffness matrix which is combined with all the elements in the continuum to obtain the global stiffness matrix. Application of the relevant boundary conditions to this global matrix, and the subsequent solution of the field variables rounds off the mathematical process, following which numerical computations can be used to solve real life engineering problems. An important aspect of solving the functional requires us to find solutions that satisfy the given boundary conditions and satisfy inter-element continuity since we define independently the properties over each element domain. The hybrid Trefftz method differs from the conventional finite element method in the assumed displacement fields and the formulation of the variational functional. In contrast to the conventional method (based on the Rayleigh-Ritz mathematical technique) the Trefftz method (based on the Trefftz mathematical technique) assumes the displacement field is composed of two independent components; the intra- element displacement field which satisfies the governing differential equation and is used to approximate the variation of potential within the element domain, and the conforming frame field which specifically satisfies the inter- element continuity condition, defined on the boundary of the element. The frame field here is the same as that used in the conventional finite element method but defined strictly on the boundary of the element ‚Äì hence the use of the term \\"hybrid\\" in the method's nomenclature. The variational functional must thus include additional terms to account for boundary conditions, since the assumed solution field only satisfies the governing differential equation.  Advantages over conventional finite element method  The main advantages of the hybrid Trefftz method over the conventional method are: # the formulation calls for integration along the element boundaries only which allows for curve-sided or polynomial shapes to be used for the element boundary, # presents expansion bases for elements that do not satisfy inter- element continuity through the variational functional, and # this method allows for the development of crack singular or perforated elements through the use of localized solution functions as the trial functions.  Applications  Since its mainstream introduction some 30 years ago, this modified finite element method has become increasingly popular to applications such as elasticity, Kirchhoff plates, thick plates, general three-dimensional solid mechanics, antisymmetric solid mechanics, potential problems, shells, elastodynamic problems, geometrically nonlinear plate bending, and transient heat conduction analysis among various others. It is currently being applied to steady, non-turbulent, incompressible, Newtonian fluid flow applications through ongoing research at the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology (FEIT) at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Australia. The hybrid Trefftz method is also being applied to some fields, e.g. computational modeling of hydrated soft tissues or water-saturated porous media, through ongoing research project at the Technical University of Lisbon, Instituto Superior T√©cnico in Portugal.

Biography Isaacs was born on 11 June 1914 in New York City.Who was Who in America, 1981, Vol 7. He worked for the RAND Corporation from 1948 until winter 1954/1955. His investigation stemmed from classic pursuit-evasion type zero-sum dynamic two player games such as the Princess and monster game. In 1942, he married Rose Bicov, and they had two daughters. His work in pure mathematics included working with monodiffric functions, fractional-order mappings, graph theory, analytic functions, and number theory. In graph theory he constructed the first two infinite families of snarks. In applied mathematics, he worked with aerodynamics, elasticity, optimization, and differential games, which he is most known for. He received his bachelors from MIT in 1936, and received his MA and PhD from Columbia University in 1942 and 1943 respectively. His first post after the war ended was at Notre Dame, but he left in 1947 due to salary issues. While at RAND, much of his work was classified, and thus remained unknown until the publication of his classic text on differential games a decade after leaving RAND. His career after RAND was spent largely in the defense and avionics industries. While at RAND, he worked with researchers including Richard E. Bellman, Leonard D. Berkovitz, David H. Blackwell, John M. Danskin, Melvin Dresher, Wendell H. Fleming, Irving L. Glicksberg, Oliver A. Gross, Samuel Karlin, John W. Milnor, John F. Nash, and Lloyd S. Shapley. His work has significant influence on mathematical optimization including fundamental concepts such as dynamic programming (Richard E. Bellman) and the Pontryagin maximum principle (Breitner 2005) which are widely used in economics and many other fields. Isaacs was a professor of Mathematical Sciences and Electrical Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University between 1967 and his retirement in 1977. Selected work(s) *Isaacs, Rufus. Differential Games, John Wiley and Sons, 1965. The Isaacs Award The executive board of the International Society of Dynamic Games decided in 2003 to establish a prize to recognize the \\"outstanding contribution to the theory and applications of dynamic games\\" of two scholars at each of its symposium, starting in 2004. The prize was named after Rufus Isaacs.http://isdg-site.org/Award The recipients of this prize are: * Yu-Chi Ho and George Leitmann (2004) * Nikolay Krasovskii and Wendell Fleming (2006) * and Alain Haurie (2008) * Tamer Ba≈üar and (2010) * Steffen J√∏rgensen and Karl Sigmund (2012) * Eitan Altman and Leon Petrosyan (2014) * Martino Bardi and Ross Cressman (2016) * Andrzej Nowak and Georges Zaccour (2018) See also *Pursuit-evasion games *Princess and Monster game *Search games Notes References *Yu, P.L. \\"An appreciation of professor Rufus Isaacs\\" Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, Springer Netherlands.

With 1.6 times the Sun's mass, at an age of 2.5 billion years it has reached a radius four times larger than the Sun and a luminosity ten times greater. It is radiating this energy from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 4,950 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of a K-type star. Eta Cephei has a high proper motion across the celestial sphere and a large peculiar velocity of .  Hunt for substellar objects  According to Nelson & Angel (1998), Eta Cephei would show two significant periodicities of 164 days and 10 years respectively, hinting at the possible presence of one or more jovian planets in orbit around the subgiant. The authors have set an upper limit of 0.64 Jupiter masses for the putative inner planet and 1.2 Jupiter masses for the putative outer one. Also Campbell et al. (1988) inferred the existence of planetary objects or even brown dwarfs less massive than 16.3 Jupiter masses. However, more recent studies have not yet confirmed the existence of any substellar companion around Eta Cephei. McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets with masses between 0.13 and 2.4 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 AU.

Known as \\"La Explosiva,\\" WSDS carries an all-Spanish schedule featuring contemporary music from a wide variety of genres, most notably Regional Mexican but also including romantica, Spanish rock, salsa, Hurban, and reggaeton. Until WDTW 1310 AM adopted a similar format, WSDS was the only 24-hour Spanish-language radio station on traditional analog radio serving the Detroit area. WSDS previously had a longtime country music format until its sale to Birach Broadcasting from Koch Broadcasting. WSDS began broadcasting in 1963 as WYSI (Ypsilanti), airing a Top 40 format; by 1966, the station had switched to country music format.http://www.keener13.com/images/billboard070266.gif In 1968, WSDS adopted a new strategy of focusing on the western suburbs of Detroit, using the slogan \\"We Serve Detroit's Suburbs\\" and sending its broadcasting van to events in the area; this focus faded away by 1980. By the early 2000s, \\"Suds\\" was still playing country music but had become a classic country station out of necessity, since major record labels were no longer supplying the station with current product. Weekends included specialty programming in Chinese and Spanish, as well as some classic rock and roll oldies. WSDS studio \\"La Explosiva\\" was born in July 2001 when Alex Resendez and Rafael Barrios, two local Mexican-American radio personalities, leased time on WSDS for three hours of Regional Mexican music programming weekly. By 2005, the station, by then sold to ethnic broadcaster Sima Birach, was airing five hours of \\"La Explosiva\\" programming six days a week, and in June of that year, \\"La Explosiva\\" became a 24-hour format over WSDS. As of February 2011, the format was simulcasted to WWCS in Pittsburgh but on January 1, 2012 the format changed to Fox Sports Radio. In April 2012, Birach sold WSDS, pending FCC approval, to Vazquez Broadcasting.http://www.michiguide.com/ The sale was consummated on July 1, 2013, at a price of $1.45 million.

The PlayStation Portable was previously supported from 2008 to 2016. The store offers a range of downloadable content both for purchase and available free of charge. Available content includes full games, add-on content, playable demos, themes and game/movie trailers. Access The store is accessible through an icon on the XrossMediaBar on the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, via the Dynamic Menu on the PlayStation 4, and an icon on the LiveArea on the PlayStation Vita. The service is also available online through the Sony Entertainment Network website. A master account is required to access the PlayStation Store. A log of all previously purchased items, known as \\"Download List\\", records each PlayStation Store account's complete download activity. A guest user can use their master account's Download List to download free content or to purchase content on another console; however, a single account can only be used on up to two consoles. This was previously five, but as of November 2011, Sony reduced this to two. The most recent firmware must be installed on the console to access the PlayStation Store. Each master account is associated with an online virtual \\"wallet\\" to which funds can be added. This wallet is then debited when a purchase is made from the store. Money can be added to the wallet through different systems of payment, although some of these are not available in all countries. All purchases on the PlayStation Store are made in the user's local currency using a 'wallet' system whereby funds are added to the wallet‚Äîeither in set denominations or an amount dictated by the price of the current transaction‚Äîthen debited from the account's wallet when the user makes a purchase, funds added to the PS Store are non-refundable. The user can add funds to their wallet in a number of ways, the most common of which is by credit or debit card. Users in many regions can also purchase PlayStation Network Cards or Tickets in set denominations from retailers including supermarkets or video game stores. These funds are redeemed on the PlayStation Store when the user enters the unique 12-digit code found on the card into the PlayStation Store. Nintendo themselves later adopted this currency system for their succeeding eShop. The Store's account, however, is region-locked and generally only accepts credit card that is billed in and PlayStation Network Cards purchased from the same country selected during the registration process, which cannot be changed afterwards. History Following feedback from many PlayStation Network users, a redesigned version of the PlayStation Store was launched on April 15, 2008 via a firmware update. The new design was OS based rather than the previous Store's web based design enabling the Store to process information more quickly. A minor update to the store was released during Sony's E3 2009 press conference. This update makes the top page rotate pictures (including their links) regularly, and changes the navigation sounds. A major redesign of the PlayStation Store was announced in September 2012, bringing with it a revised navigation structure and new search system. The new store has been developed to bring game and video content together and make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. Content will be integrated into each game's listing, rather than separate categories for items like add-ons, themes, and other downloadable content. The latest design is much less focused on text, and incorporates high-resolution artwork and smooth animations for featured content. The new redesign launched in Europe on October 22, 2012. Shortly after it was launched in the United Kingdom, the Store interface was reverted to the old design due to issues such as long load times and slow navigation, while other countries in Europe retained the new interface despite these issues. The redesign was released in North America on November 2, 2012. On May 11, 2020, the PlayStation Store has been indefinitely suspended in China due to security reasons. Versions =PlayStation 3= PlayStation Store was launched within the PlayStation 3 on November 11, 2006. There are four different versions of the store on the platform: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan and North America (including South America). =PlayStation Portable= PlayStation Store was supported on PlayStation Portable starting by October 2008 with 5.00 firmware update. The native PlayStation Store front on PSP was closed on March 31, 2016 as Sony announced on March 1 the same year. =PlayStation Vita= PlayStation Store was launched on the PlayStation Vita on December 17, 2011 and is accessible via an icon on the LiveArea. As of December 2016, all Vita games were also made available to be downloaded digitally on the PlayStation Network via the storefront, although not all games are released physically. There are four different versions of the PlayStation Store: Asia, Europe (including Oceania and the Middle East), Japan and North America. There is no Vita's PlayStation Store localization in China and South America. =PlayStation 4= PlayStation 4 version of the PlayStation Store was released on November 15, 2013 along with the console in North America, and on November 29 in most of Europe with the console two weeks following the North American launch. The PS4 version of the PS Store uses the same overall design and interface to its predecessor, the PlayStation 3's storefront; however, the color scheme has been altered to match that of the console's theme, changing from black to blue. =Internet browser= In January 2013, the PlayStation Store was made available via Internet browser. Users can purchase content for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable via the online store, then download it (or put it in a download queue) via their respective devices. In October 2015, a \\"Wishlist\\" option was added. =PlayStation 5= PlayStation 5 version of PlayStation Store would be released on November 12, 2020 along with the console in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea, and on November 19, 2020 in rest of the world (excluding China) with the console seven days following the North American and Japan launch.

According to the Canada 2011 Census, the population of Vars was 1,424,Population calculated by combining Dissemination Areas 35061119, 35061120 and 35061121 using the boundaries defined in the Vars neighbourhood planning study area.http://ottawa.ca/calendar/ottawa/citycouncil/occ/2010/02-24/pec/10%20-%20ACS2010-ICS- CSS-0002%20DOCUMENT%201%20EN%20Vars.pdf Facilities Vars has a French elementary school called St-Guillaume, two churches (one Anglican and one Roman Catholic), and an outdoor skating rink located in Alcide Trudeau Park. There are few businesses, including a corner store, and a pizzeria. The town's fire station, Ottawa Fire Service's Station 73, was relocated and rebuilt in 2007 and is now located at the south end of Frank Kenny Road. The local softball teams for children and teenagers, the Vars Vipers and the Vars Vikings, are sponsored by local businesses.  History  The Bear Brook area, where Vars is located, was first colonized in 1824. By 1836 a small settlement began to form. The brook originally got its name from the plentiful number of bears that foraged on acorns produced from the large quantities of oaks found alongside its sides. A Mr. Dunning set up a sawmill operation that used logs that had been channelled down through Bear Brook, and which continued on eastward to the South Nation River, the Ottawa River and finally to the St. Lawrence Seaway. Bear Brook now flows with less than half the water it did when settlers first arrived. By the time the mill was set up the town consisted of a hotel, many stores and approximately 200 people in which the vast majority were English speaking of Irish descent. In 1881, the area was named Bearbrook Station. A train station was built which would help transport logs towards the St. Lawrence. In 1886, the community reached a large enough population to gain a post office, which lightened the work load for Mr. Jack Young, who had previously brought the mail in by horse and by snowshoe in winter. Bearbrook Station was difficult to distinguish from the nearby community of Bearbrook; therefore, it was renamed to Vars. There are two stories of how Vars got its name. The first, is that with the building of the new post office, the people of Bearbrook Station decided to name the community after the four people who brought the post office to the area: Mc(V)eigh, (A)rmstrong, (R)onan, and (S)mith. The second story is that the town was given the name by a retired priest from Embrun, Abb√© C. Guillame, in memory of the village of Vars, Hautes-Alpes, in France. In 1915, permanent sidewalks were built in the main community area. In 1931, the community streets were lit up by their first street lights, one year earlier than the neighbouring community of Cumberland.  References  *Brault, L. 1965.

Hotel Dieu Hospital is a hospital in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. It is affiliated with Queen's University, and is a partner within Kingston's university hospitals, delivering health care, conducting research and training the health care professionals.  History  In 1841, the Catholic bishop of Kingston, Remigius Gaulin, asked the Religious Hospitallers of Saint Joseph (RHSJ) of Montreal to send a group of sisters to establish a Catholic Hospital in his city to provide care for the poor Irish Catholic immigrants in the city. The RHSJs, however, were unable to find suitable buildings for their hospital until 1845. On September 2, 1845, Mother Amable Bourbonniere along with Sisters Huguette Claire Latour, Emilie Barbarie, and Louise Davignon, accompanied by their benefactress, Miss Josephine Perras and Mr. Laframboise, a friend of the community, arrived in Kingston. They stayed with the Kingston Notre Dame Sisters for two days, and then moved into their hospital, located in a small limestone building, now 229 Brock Street, on September 4, 1845. The Kingston RHSJs saw their first patient on September 7. By the end of October, they had refurbished and moved into their monastery, located at 233 Brock Street, allowing them to have a men's ward on the main floor of the Hospital and a women's ward on the second floor.Jessie V.

This usually involves the synthesis and subdivision of double-stranded cDNAs from polyA RNA. Distinct sets of restriction enzymes can then be used to digest sets of the divided cDNAs and resulting fragments ligated to labelled adapters to be amplified by PCR. PCR products are then purified and subjected to gel electrophoresis on a mounted platform employing stationary laser excitation and a multi-colour charge-coupled device imaging system. A fluorescent label at the 5' end of one of the PCR primers allows for visualization of the PCR fragments, and the cDNAs are subjected to several isolated and identical restriction digests to generate a merged profile based on peak height and variance. The merged digestion profiles from the cDNA preparations are then compared to locate differentially expressed fragments (such as between normal tissue and diseased or drug responsive tissue); these profiles are compared by means of various internet-ready databases such as GeneScape.

Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.  Cause  In the last days of the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), a Bosnian Croat military force, captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina. Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia. Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.  The attack  At 11:21 a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters. Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly. Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot. Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place. After 15‚Äì20 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded. The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22 a.m. local time (10:22 UTC). Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with of highly explosive TNT. The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car. The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim. Due to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself. The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place. The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall. As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders). The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.  Aftermath  With the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack. American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al- Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack. Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy. Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995. A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.

Unveiled in June 1929, it is located at the intersection of Bulevardul Geniului and Bulevardul Iuliu Maniu, across the street from Cotroceni Palace. One of Bucharest's most recognisable monuments, it was financed entirely through donations from veteran officers of the Engineer Arm and executed by Spiridon Georgescu. Set into the pyramidal base are bronze reliefs depicting the engineers in action. Four life-sized bronze statues represent troops from the Engineer Arm -- a sapper, a pontoon bridge builder, a Signal Corps engineer and a CƒÉile Ferate Rom√¢ne soldier. But the monument's chief component is a statue of a lion, which stands atop the pedestal. With his front paws he tramples upon the barrel of a cannon (upon which sits a Pickelhaube); a flag flows downward. The lion symbolises the endurance, daring and bravery shown by Romanian troops between 1916 and 1918, especially at the dramatic battles during the summer of 1917 -- MƒÉrƒÉ≈üti, Oituz and MƒÉrƒÉ≈üe≈üti. Carved into the pedestal in relief is the inscription, \\"Spune»õi genera»õiilor viitoare cƒÉ noi am fƒÉcut suprema jertfƒÉ pe c√¢mpurile de bƒÉtaie pentru √Æntregirea neamului\\" - \\"Tell succeeding generations that we made the supreme sacrifice on the fields of battle for the union of the people\\".For a time during the communist period, the last three words were effaced. Since the \\"union\\" mentioned involved not only Transylvania but also Bessarabia and Bukovina, the matter was politically sensitive, as all of the former and the northern part of the latter had been ceded to the Soviet Union in June 1940 (see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina).

(1991) Textbook of Medical Physiology. (8th ed). Philadelphia: W.B. Saunders The taste thresholds of other bitter substances are rated relative to quinine, which is thus given a reference index of 1. For example, Brucine has an index of 11, is thus perceived as intensely more bitter than quinine, and is detected at a much lower solution threshold. The most bitter substance known is the synthetic chemical denatonium, which has an index of 1,000. It is used as an aversive agent (a bitterant) that is added to toxic substances to prevent accidental ingestion. This was discovered in 1958 during research on lignocaine, a local anesthetic, by MacFarlan Smith of Gorgie, Edinburgh, Scotland. =Brewery= Beer bitterness scales attempt to rate the perceived relative bitterness of beer. The bitterness of beer is provided by compounds such as isohumulones from hops used during brewing. The International Bittering Units scale, or simply IBU scale, is measured through the use of a spectrophotometer and solvent extraction a calculation is performed on this absorbance to give a result in IBU. This technique was adopted at the same time as another method based on measuring the concentration (in milligrams per litre; parts per million w/v) of IAA isomerized Œ± acids in a beer, causing some confusion among small-scale brewers. The American Society of Brewing Chemists, in the introduction to its methods on measuring bitterness, points out some differences between the results of the two methods: The European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, is a bitterness scale in which lower values are generally \\"less bitter\\" and higher values \\"more bitter\\". The scale and method are defined by the European Brewery Convention, and the numerical value should be the same as of the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co- operation with the American Society of Brewing Chemists. However, the exact process of determining EBU and IBU values differs slightly, which may in theory result with slightly smaller values for EBU than IBU. IBU can not be determined by perceived bitterness. For example, the bittering effect of hops is less noticeable in beers with a high quantity of malt, so a higher bitterness is needed in heavier beers to balance the flavour and achieve the same perceived bitterness as compared to a lighter beer. For example, an Imperial Stout may have an IBU of 50, but will taste less bitter than an English Bitter with an IBU of 30, because the latter beer uses much less malt than the former. After around 100 IBU, hop utilization is so poor that the number ceases to be meaningful in regard to taste, although continued hop additions will increase bitterness. Light lagers without much bitterness will generally have 8-20 IBU, while an India Pale Ale may have 60-100 IBU or more.

It is also known by the alternative title The Satyr. The work marked a major development in Jonson's career, as the first of many entertainments and masques that he would write for the Stuart Court. The entertainment was designed to welcome the members of the new royal family to England during their progress from Edinburgh to London. It was performed on 25 June 1603, before the new queen consort, Anne of Denmark, and her son Prince Henry, at Althorp, the Northamptonshire estate of the Spencer family. (The then-head of the family, Sir Robert Spencer, was created 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton less than a month later, on 21 July 1603.)E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 391. The main speaker in the entertainment is a satyr, yielding the alternative title, and the cast includes fairies and elves -- a blending of figures from both classical and native English folklore that Jonson would employ in future works as well (see, for example, The Fortunate Isles and Their Union of 1625). The new queen is personified as Queen Mab. Under its full title, A Particular Entertainment of the Queen and Prince their Highness at Althorp, the work was entered into the Stationers' Register on 19 March 1604, and was published later that year in a quarto that also included Jonson's The Coronation Triumph. The quarto was printed by Valentine Simmes for the bookseller Edward Blount. The entertainment was reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and was thereafter included in the collected works. Jonson's attempt to win royal favor during the previous reign had not succeeded: his play Cynthia's Revels was poorly received when acted at Court in 1601, and he gained no preferment from Queen Elizabeth. Jonson fared much better in the new reign: he wrote several entertainments in the early Jacobean era, and in 1605 his first Court masque, The Masque of Blackness, was staged at Whitehall Palace. From then till Chloridia in 1631, Jonson was the most regularly employed masque writer for the Stuarts. He produced a major segment of his total literary output for their court, and received a large share of his income from those works. References External links * The text online.

Mission statement \\"To involve, and be involved within, our community to provide excellent service and programmes\\" Codes of Practice The station is subject to the Community Broadcasting Codes of Practice, as updated in 2009. The station was investigated for reported failure to allow Community Participation in Operations and Decision making. No breaches were found. Programming The majority of music played on the station is country, however there is a variety of genres including Folk, Rock & Pop, Classical, 50s, 60s, 70s 80 & 90s and Christian/Religious. This is what the community surveyed wants to hear. The station provides an easy to access outlet for Australian music artists. The majority of presenters are over 55 and are volunteers. A Programme committee governs the programmes that are put to air. Community radio is focussed on giving people a local voice, especially those who would not normally get access to the airtime. This may include ethnic language programs, programs for the print handicapped, programming for gay and lesbian members, youth programs or niche music. In rural areas such as Narrabri, this is made much more difficult, as censorship and conservatism is the norm. A recent addition to programming is the \\"Max FM Mornings\\" program. Between the hours of 9am-12noon presents information on the local community, including Bush Bargains, school news, Narrabri Shire Council Report by the Mayor, a local weeds report, and a What's On In Our Shire report. History 2MAX FM began life as an aspirant community radio station known as Narrabri Shire Community Radio (NSCR). A small group of locals wanted a local radio station, and had discovered that there were community licences available. A public meeting was held, and a steering committee was formed. The first test broadcast was from the Old Shire Council building, running at approx. 5 watts from a small antenna hung out the office window! The test broadcaster lasted a week, but was largely ignored by the Narrabri community. A series of test broadcasts continued during the 1990s. Another community aspirant group raised its head in the late 1990s forcing NSCR into frequency sharing on a turn about basis. The lack of financial support from the local community was exacerbated by this. Many business houses took a wait and see approach. The full-time licence was finally granted in 2000 - when then-President Terry Hogan received the phone call, he was amazed at the lack of celebration. It was simply business as usual in Narrabri. The launching of MAX FM, coupled with a far more aggressive sales team lead to some limited acceptance by the local community. A focus on the oldest members of the community seemed to be the right niche for MAX FM, with income, membership and technical growth was substantial. Income The station earns income from memberships, sponsorships, fundraising, and grants, which totals approximately $140,000 per year.

This dust has a combined mass equal to 6.6% of the Earth's mass. There is a faint companion star at an angular separation of along a position angle of . This corresponds to a projected physical separation of . The probability of a random star being situated this close to Epsilon Cephei is about one in a million, so it is most likely physically associated. If so, then the debris disk is probably circumbinary. The fact that this companion was not detected during the Hipparcos mission may indicate its orbit has a high eccentricity. The companion star has a K-band magnitude of 7.8 and is probably of class K8‚ÄìM2.

Youth politics encompasses youth policy that specifically has an impact on young people (for example, education, housing, employment, leisure) and how young people engage in politics including in institutional politics (elections, membership of a political party), youth organisations, but also in protest movements and lifestyle. History =United States= With roots in the early youth activism of the Newsboys and Mother Jones' child labor protests at the turn of the 20th century, youth politics were first identified in American politics with the formation of the American Youth Congress in the 1930s. In the 1950s and 1960s organizations such as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Students for a Democratic Society were closely associated with youth politics, despite the broad social statements of documents including the liberal Port Huron Statement and the conservative Sharon Statement and leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. Other late-period figures associated with youth politics include Tom Hayden, Marian Wright Edelman and Bill Clinton. =Europe= Youth politics have an extensive history in Europe, as well. Free German Youth was founded in 1936 as a communist alternative to the Nazi Youth movement. In the UK there is a strong youth politics movement, consisting primarily of the British Youth Council, the UK Youth Parliament and the Scottish Youth Parliament. Although they have no direct power, the young people in these organisations have a close working relationship with Members of Parliament and are fairly influential, albeit ineffectual at bringing about direct change or tangible objectives. Many organisations that strive for youth movement are on the rise. A notable organisation is YouthDebates, an online organisation aiming to engage young people into the world of politics. =Globally= Other continents have experienced a variety of youth politics and political movements. In the recent Mexico‚Äôs presidential election another manifestation of how the youth take the politics in the actual world were see, the students movement called ‚ÄúYo soy 132‚Äù made a very notable change in how the elections developed, showing proofs of the electoral fraud they thought will happen, they changed the percentage of acceptation of the PRI candidate, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto and they achieved to decrease it around 12 percentage points between the highest poll results for the candidate and the final results of the elections. Increasingly, young people are involved in global youth-led protest movements, for example, about social and environmental justice. This activism is in part because young people have been particular affected by various crises (political, social, economic, environmental) notably austerity.Pickard, Sarah and Bessant, Judith. \\"Young People Re-Generating Politics in Times of Crises\\". Palgrave Macmillian, 2017.. Moreover, young people tend to have more post- materialist values (see work by Ronald Inglehart). Present Between the influence of mainstream media and politicians, youth politics in the United States has been illegitimated and deprioritized. Organizations such as National Youth Rights Association and The Freechild Project continue to advocate and educate for issues that affect young people specifically, while other organizations, including Youth Service America and Advocates for Youth work for issues that affect youth directly. The children's rights movement is widely credited with keeping youth politics on the national radar, while other fledgling movements such as youth voice and youth participation have yet to gain the spotlight.Even with the efforts of these organizations, many college students do not see politics as an important part of their lives. Only 33% of college freshman think being knowledgeable about politics to be important.Pryor, J.H., Hurtado, S., DeAngelo, L., Palucki Blake, L., & Tran, S. (2009).

It provides an intercity bus service between the cities of Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Santa Paula, and Fillmore in Ventura County, and to communities in neighboring Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties. The agency is part of the Ventura County Transportation Commission, a governmental body that oversees transportation planning and funding in Ventura County. History Before VISTA was formed in 1994, the County of Ventura provided rudimentary intercity bus service. One line ran along US 101 with stops in Ventura, Oxnard, Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, and Westlake Village. Another service linked Thousand Oaks and Moorpark via SR 23. The city of Fillmore sponsored a route consisting of a few trips between Fillmore and Ventura along SR 126. Because of the limited nature of these services, the Ventura County Transportation Commission proposed a comprehensive intercity bus system. Service on four core lines (Highway 101, East County, Highway 126, and a Central County route serving Camarillo, Camarillo State Mental Hospital, Point Mugu, and Oxnard) started in July 1994. Over time, these routes have been adjusted according to ridership. With the closing of Camarillo State Hospital and the repurposing of the hospital grounds as a California State University campus, the Central route was cancelled and two new campus shuttle routes were implemented. In 1998, service was extended to Warner Center in Los Angeles County, and in 2001, service was extended to Santa Barbara. In early 2015, VCTC changed the name of the service from VISTA to VCTC Intercity. The VCTC Intercity bus service is operated by Roadrunner Shuttle, a subsidiary of RATP Dev USA, under contract. Due to the length of the VISTA routes, over-the-road coaches are used. Routes =Intercity= Highway 101 Provides service along the length of US 101 in Ventura County, originating at the Pacific View Mall, and stopping at various places in Oxnard, Camarillo, and Thousand Oaks. Highway 126 This route also originates at the Pacific View Mall in Ventura and operates along SR 126 to Saticoy, Santa Paula, and Fillmore, with limited service to Piru. East County VISTA East County route operates in the SR 23 corridor between Westlake Village, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, and Simi Valley. Conejo Connection Four round trips, two in the morning and two in the afternoon, connect Oxnard, Camarillo, and Thousand Oaks with the Warner Center Transit Hub and other stops at Warner Center, a business and residential complex in the western San Fernando Valley, in Los Angeles County. At the transit hub, riders may connect with a shuttle to the Metro G Line and other transit services from a variety of agencies, providing access to many points in Los Angeles County. Coastal Express This route connects Ventura with Carpinteria and Santa Barbara. Peak hour trips also serve Goleta and the University of California, Santa Barbara. CSUCI Camarillo and CSUCI Oxnard Originally two separate lines, this shuttle route connects California State University, Channel Islands with the Camarillo Metrolink Station and the Oxnard \\"C\\" Street Transfer Center.

It manufactures single-engined piston-powered general aviation aircraft. Through its history the company has had many American owners and subsequent bankruptcies. Mooney International was purchased in 2013 by a Chinese private equity, real-estate development company, the Meijing Group who ran it until 2020, when it was purchased by a group of Mooney aircraft owners under US Financial, LLC of Wyoming. Among Mooney's achievements are; the first pressurized single-engined, piston- powered aircraft, the M22 Mustang, production of the fastest civilian single- engine piston-powered aircraft in the world, the M20TN Acclaim Type S, the first production aircraft to achieve on , the M20J 201 and the fastest transcontinental flight in a single-engine piston-powered production aircraft, the M20K 231. Many Mooney aircraft have the signature vertical stabilizer with its vertical leading edge and swept trailing edge that gives the illusion of being forward-swept. History A Mooney M-18C Mite The company was founded in 1929 by Albert Mooney and his brother Arthur. Albert Mooney had his first job in aviation at the age of 19 in 1925 when he worked briefly for Alexander Aircraft Company in Denver, Colorado. He worked for the Marshall/Montague Monoplane Company in Marshall, Missouri in 1926, but the company had financial difficulties, and Al soon returned to Alexander, where he designed the Alexander Bullet. He was joined by his brother Arthur, known as Art. Early in 1929 Al was invited to meet with some financial backers in Wichita, Kansas, and the Mooney Aircraft Corporation was established with financial backing from the Bridgeport Machine Company. The company owned an airfield and some buildings which could be used to design and build aircraft. Seven months later, Albert's M-5 airplane was test-flown. Due to the Great Depression, the Mooney Aircraft Corporation went bankrupt in 1930.Ball 1998, p. 22‚Äì26. The Mooney brothers worked for other aircraft companies, including the Culver Aircraft Company, from then through World War II. On June 18, 1948, Albert started Mooney Aircraft Incorporated in Wichita, along with Charles Yankey, Art Mooney and W. L. McMahon.Ball 1998, p. 206. The first aircraft produced by the new Mooney company was the small single-seat Mooney Mite M-18. It was designed to appeal to the thousands of fighter pilots leaving military service. Some thought the Mooney Mite looked so much like the Messerschmitt Bf 109 that they called it the \\"Texas Messerschmitt\\". The Mite was produced into the early 1950s and established some of the design concepts still used by Mooney today. Al Mooney had been developing the designs for a four-seater plane for some time while the Mite was in production. In early 1953, the company moved to Kerrville, Texas, and when it became clear that the Mite was nearing the end of its production, the development of the new plane was accelerated. The first M20 flight took place on September 3, 1953. Charles Yankey had been the primary financial backer since he helped Al establish the company in 1948, and when he visited Kerrville for a ride in the new airplane, he was pleased with the project and began to develop the financial plans necessary to put the plane into production.Ball 1998, p. 49‚Äì52. Later that year, before Yankey transferred the funds from Wichita to Kerrville, he suffered a severe stroke, and he died in December 1953. None of Yankey's heirs had any interest in the aviation business, and although he had left his company stock to the two Mooney brothers, that stock had little value without further investment. The company was on the point of declaring bankruptcy when two investors, Hal Rachal and Norm Hoffman of Midland, Texas, decided to step in and save the company. The M20 was certified in September 1955. Shortly thereafter, Albert Mooney left the company for unknown reasons and went to work for the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation in Marietta, Georgia. His brother Art joined him there, and both remained with Lockheed until retirement.Ball 1998, p. 52‚Äì53. During 1955, Mooney sold 10 of the M20 airplanes. Due to start-up costs, they lost US$3000 on each airplane. Production increased, and they delivered 51 airplanes in 1956 and 105 airplanes in 1957. The M20 gained attention because it was able to achieve speeds of up to with a Lycoming O-320 engine. The combination of speed and efficiency was noteworthy.Ball 1998, pp. 57‚Äì58. In 1958 the M20A joined the lineup with a larger Lycoming O-360-A1A engine, and by 1959 this was the only model offered, with a total sales that year of 231 units. This was the first year the company made a profit. The M20A continued production into 1960 when 166 were delivered. These were the last of the Mooneys to have wooden structures in the wings and tail.Ball 1998, pp. 58‚Äì59. =1960s= Since Al Mooney's departure, John W. Taylor had been the chief engineer. In January 1960, the Mooney company convinced Ralph Harmon to leave McDonnell Aircraft and take over management of the engineering efforts. He had previously worked for Beech Aircraft where he headed the design of the Beechcraft Model 35, one of the first all-metal general aviation monoplanes. He later worked on the larger Cessna 620 and McDonnell Model C119, but his interests lay with small aircraft, and he accepted Mooney's offer. He insisted on replacing the wood in the M20 with aluminum, and the all-metal M20B was completed by the end of 1960, less than a year after his arrival. In 1961 the company sold 222 M20Bs. The following year the M20C, a refined version of the M20B, was introduced; 336 were sold that year.Ball 1998, pp. 60‚Äì63. A Mooney M20C Rachal, Hoffman, and Harmon were not experienced at running an aircraft factory, but saw the need to expand the product line and add dealers, and pushed ahead. In 1963 they introduced the M20D, essentially an M20C with fixed landing gear and a fixed-pitch propeller. This had a slightly lower price than the M20C and was intended as a basic or trainer model which would have lower insurance costs. It could be upgraded with retractable landing gear, and in fact most of them were upgraded over the years. The M20D was produced from 1963 to 1966 with a total production of 141 units.Ball 1998, pp. 65‚Äì66. 1964 saw the introduction of the M20E Super 21, based on the M20C but with a more powerful fuel-injected Lycoming engine. The company sold 366 M20Es that year.Ball 1998, p. 66. A Mooney M22 Mustang To supplement the M20 line, Mooney began development of a high-performance pressurized single, the M22 Mustang. It first flew in September 1965 and was certified two years later. The project was ultimately unsuccessful. Sources disagree on the total production, some saying 36 units, others 32, 29 or 27. What is certain is that each plane was a financial loss for the company. It was reported as having a heavy control response and poor visibility, although it did fly high and fast. The name also could have caused problems, since Cavalier Aircraft had been modifying surplus North American P-51 Mustangs for civilian use and wrote a letter to Mooney asking them not to use the name \\"Mustang\\". The letter was ignored and Cavalier filed suit, but by that time the M22 line was nearing its end and the Mustang name had been dropped.Ball 1998, pp. 74‚Äì85. During several years in the early 1960s, Mooney had discussions with Mitsubishi Motors regarding their MU-2. An agreement between the companies was reached in mid-1964: the MU2 would be fabricated in Japan but assembled by Mooney in the United States. The existing Kerrville facility and workforce was insufficient, so Mooney purchased near the airport in San Angelo, Texas ( to the northeast of Kerrville), set up an assembly line in an existing hangar, and built new support facilities. The MU2 sold slowly. This was partly because the same sales force that was selling the M20 line was also trying to sell the much more expensive MU2. It cost about US$400,000, and marketing and selling such an airplane was different than selling a small four-seater. The company's management was also over- stretched.Ball 1998, pp. 88‚Äì92. In 1967, Mooney acquired production rights to the Aircoupe from Alon Aircraft Company. Owners John Allen and Lee Higdon, who had left Beech Aircraft to start their own company, took managerial positions at Mooney. Production began in 1968 with a total of 38 units. That year Allen and Higdon both left Mooney, Allen returning to Beech to assist with the Beechcraft Duke. In 1969 the tail of the plane was updated and it became the M10 Cadet, but only 9 units were sold that year. 50 were built in 1970 before the model was terminated, marking the end of the Aircoupe.Ball 1998, pp. 93‚Äì96. Despite strong sales of the M20, Mooney was short of cash. The development of the M22 Mustang had cost more than expected, and was ultimately unsuccessful. The collaboration with Mitsubishi had come with substantial financial assistance but proved too much for the company to handle. It went into chapter 7 bankruptcy in early 1969; American Electronics Laboratories quickly acquired Mooney in March of that year and invested US$600,000 to keep it operating. Sales that year were less than half of the previous year's figures, although a new model, the M20E Chapparal, was released with electrically-operated flaps and landing gear. AEL was unable to turn the company around and sold Mooney to Butler Aviation International in December 1969. AEL owned Mooney for just over 9 months and lost nearly a million dollars during that time. Butler Aviation also acquired the troubled Aerostar company and combined it with Mooney in an attempt to save both. The Mooney name was dropped in 1970, as was the M20 designation; the planes were called Aerostars.Ball 1998, pp. 103‚Äì112. =1970s= A Mooney M20J Butler Aviation closed the Mooney plant in early 1971 and it remained closed for more than two years. In October 1973, Republic Steel Corporation acquired company and resumed production in 1974. Robert Cumming, a general manager at Republic Steel, had owned a Mooney M20F Executive for years and flew it frequently, and wished to put the Mooney M20 back into production. This began in January 1974 with the reintroduction of the M20F Executive.Ball 1998, p. 127. The company continued aggressive product development, working on another pressurized single to compete with the Cessna 210, a turboprop designated the \\"301\\". Roy LoPresti, formerly of Grumman Aerospace where he had worked on aircraft design and the Apollo Lunar Module, was hired as chief of research and development to update the M20. The result was the M20J 201, so named because it was capable of with its engine. In a 1979 interview, LoPresti noted that Mooney did not have the resources to develop radical new composite construction aircraft as did other manufacturers, and would focus on evolutionary development of conventional aircraft. The 201 was a big seller, and a turbocharged version was developed later that year. The next year, 1977, three models were offered: the M20C Ranger, the M20F Executive, and the M20J 201. By 1979 the M20C had been dropped, ending production of the short-body M20.Ball 1998, pp. 127‚Äì134. The same year, the company's first turbocharged M20 was released: the M20K 231, so designated because its top speed was . It was based on the earlier 201 with further improvements. This year a total of 439 airplanes were delivered ‚Äî fewer than the top years of the 1960s, but these deliveries resulted in healthy profits. From this point through 1986, the M20J and the turbocharged M20K were the only two models offered.Ball 1998, pp. 141‚Äì144. =1980s= General aviation manufacturing experienced a significant downturn starting in 1982. Mooney was affected along with other manufacturers and was forced to downsize through temporary layoffs. Despite the recession, development work continued. The 201 and 231 received more improvements, including significant reductions in cabin noise levels. The newly-developed six-place 301 had its first flight in the spring of 1982. That year deliveries fell to 218 units, and in 1983 only 154 aircraft were produced; but enthusiasm for the new 301 kept expectations high, and another opportunity arose. The United States Air Force announced a competition to develop a replacement for the Cessna T-41 trainer, and Mooney immediately began to develop a military trainer based on the 231.Ball 1998, pp. 145‚Äì153. In 1984, Republic Steel was acquired by the Ling-Temco-Vought corporation, and Mooney was dropped. There were several bids to purchase the company and it was quickly purchased by a group of investors known as the Morrison Group from Minneapolis, Minnesota. Less than two months later it was acquired by the team of Armand Rivard of Lake Aircraft and Alexandre Couvelair, a Mooney dealer from Paris. They had placed a bid when Republic dropped Mooney and were determined to own the company. When president Tom Smith left to join Fairchild Aircraft, Roy LoPresti became president, but he left the following year (1985) to work for Beech Aircraft Corporation. The 301 was put on hold and was never resumed by Mooney; it eventually became the TBM700 and is now produced by Socata Aircraft. The focus was once again on the M20 line. Sales continued to fall, totaling 143 in 1984 and 99 in 1985.Ball 1998, pp. 154‚Äì160. Mooney opened a new facility in San Antonio, Texas, in 1989. In February of that year, the next M20 model was released: the M20M TLS (Turbocharged Lycoming Sabre). The first year, the TLS accounted for 30 of the 143 aircraft delivered, and in 1990 this increased to 61 units.Ball 1998, pp. 175‚Äì182. Also in 1989, Mooney released a trainer model based on the M20J. Beech, Cessna and Piper had all stopped production of trainers throughout the 1980s, and the 201AT was designed to fill this gap. From 1989 to 1992, 20 units were delivered.Ball 1998, pp. 182‚Äì185. =1990s= 1990 saw the release of the next new model, the M20J 201, also designated the MSE. This was a non- turbocharged model that incorporated many features from the TLS. In early 1991 Mooney decided to offer its Enhanced Flight Screener Trainer model to the general public, given that the Air Force was slow to make a decision on its trainer. It was to have a Lycoming O-540 engine and would be rated for aerobatics. However, it generated little public interest. The TLS continued production through 1995, and the MSE continued too, until it was replaced by the M20R Ovation in 1994. Once again Mooney was offering two models: one with high speed (the TLS) and the other with high efficiency.Ball 1998, pp. 185‚Äì189. A Mooney M20M \\"Bravo\\" The competition for the Enhanced Flight Screener program was finally held in 1992, and the Slingsby T67 Firefly was chosen instead of the Mooney EFS. Sales continued to drop, only reaching 64 units in 1993. The San Antonio location was sold and all operations returned to Kerrville. Development of the M20 continued and the M20R Ovation was released in 1994. It was designed to fill a gap between the normally-aspirated MSE and the turbocharged TLS, and it was powered by a Continental IO-550 engine. Of the 91 Mooney aircraft manufactured in 1995, 54 were Ovations.Ball 1998, pp. 190‚Äì199. The M20M Bravo, a TLS with more power, and the M20K Encore, an M20K with more power, appeared in 1996 and 1997, respectively.Ball 1998, pp. 202‚Äì205. =2000s= In July 2001, Mooney entered yet another bankruptcy and under the leadership of J. Nelson Happy as CEO, the company was acquired by Advanced Aerodynamics and Structures Inc. (AASI) in 2002. AASI resurrected Mooney under the name Mooney Aircraft Company, Inc., a division of Mooney Aerospace Group, Ltd. Two years later in 2004, MASG (AASI) sold off the Mooney assets to Allen Holding Finance in May, and filed for bankruptcy on June 10. In December, MASG restructured and reacquired Mooney Aircraft Company from Allen Holding Finance. Gretchen L. Jahn joined Mooney in November 2004, becoming the first female CEO of a U.S. aircraft manufacturer. She oversaw the development and introduction of the M20TN Acclaim and the Garmin G1000-equipped Ovation2 GX and Bravo GX. In June 2005, Mooney added a second shift and 50 new workers to boost production. A Mooney M20T Acclaim Mooney announced the release of the M20TN Acclaim on April 4, 2006, at the Sun 'n Fun fly-in at Lakeland, Florida. The M20TN also featured the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit, four heated, leather captain's chairs with lumbar support, a range in excess of , and a top speed of . At the time of its introduction, the Acclaim was the fastest single-engine piston-powered production aircraft in the world. Mooney was a publicly traded company after emerging from bankruptcy under the [symbol MNYG (OTC BB) until October 2006, when Mooney Aerospace Group arranged financing to buy out public shareholders. In late 2007, Mooney announced the arrival of its newest model, the M20TN Acclaim Type S. The Acclaim Type S added to the Acclaim's top speed to reach a speed of . Mooney achieved this performance gain through aerodynamic tweaks to the Acclaim's airframe. =2008 production halt= On 16 June 2008, Mooney announced it would lay off 60 employees and cut production from eight aircraft per month to five. Mooney CEO Dennis Ferguson said: The reasons for the cutbacks and layoffs cited by the company include the weak US economy and the high price of fuel inhibiting sales. On 5 November 2008, the company announced it was halting all production and had laid off 229 of its 320 employees, due to an excess unsold inventory of aircraft as a result of the late-2000s recession. Virtually all the laid- off employees were on the production line. The company said all other operations would continue and all customer support and existing customer orders would be filled. In carrying out the layoffs, the company did not comply with the notification requirements of Texas law. In a statement Mooney said: In a third round of layoffs in December 2008, the company let go an additional 40 workers, leaving only about 50 employees at work. The company had 25 unsold aircraft at its factory in December 2008. =2010s= In April 2010, after 18 months with no aircraft production, the backlog of unsold aircraft was cleared and the company announced it intended to resume aircraft production in the near future, subject to the market gaining \\"a little more momentum\\". On 19 November 2010, Mooney started a new round of layoffs, intending to reduce company staff from 53 to less than 10 employees by 1 January 2011. The remaining staff would be employed maintaining the company's physical facilities, its type and production certificates and providing parts and technical support to aircraft owners. The company continued negotiations with potential investors to allow production to resume. Company Chief Financial Officer Barry Hodkin stated, \\"We are not shutting down. However, we cannot continue to subsidize the company at the level we have in the recent past. We have been in discussions with potential investors for more than 18 months and will continue to work with them. If things change, then the scope of this layoff could change\\". A two-door Mooney Acclaim Ultra By August 2013, the company was still not producing new aircraft, but continued to support the existing fleet with parts. The company indicated that a return to production of complete aircraft was contemplated, depending on new investment being found. On 8 October 2013, it was announced that the company had been purchased by Soaring America Corporation, a new California-based company headed by President Cheng Yuan (Jerry Chen) of Taiwan, for an undisclosed amount. Chen heads a group of Chinese investors that some reports indicate include the Meijing Group, a Chinese real-estate developer. Chen indicated his priorities included resuming production of the Acclaim and the Ovation, while continuing to supply parts for the existing fleet. Chen stated the company would remain in Kerrville, and concentrate on supplying new aircraft for the Chinese market. Paul Bertorelli, AVweb's Editorial Director, Aviation Publications, questioned whether the outdated and expensive-to-produce Mooney models, that use engines burning avgas, can succeed in the Chinese market. With the injection of capital from its new Chinese owners, production resumed on 26 February 2014, beginning with the completion of five previously incomplete airframes already on the assembly line. In April 2014 at Sun n Fun, the company announced a US$50M investment, including the construction of a Mooney museum in Kerrville to be run by a new nonprofit organization. With production underway, 85 employees were at work, with the workforce forecast to expand to 140 by the end of 2014. Chief Executive Officer Chen stated the company would deliver 6 aircraft in 2014 and 30 in 2015. In January 2015 the first aircraft, a Mooney M20TN, was delivered to a customer in China. The aircraft was shipped disassembled and then assembled and test flown in Zhengzhou, China. Two new Mooney models were announced on 11 November 2014. The Mooney M10T was to be a fixed gear composite aircraft powered by Continental‚Äôs CD-135 diesel engine; the M10J was a variant which was to have retractable gear and the CD-155 diesel. These were developed largely with the Chinese aviation market in mind. In China, aviation fuel is scarce and expensive, whereas diesel fuel is less expensive and more readily available. The M10 series certification and deliveries were expected to begin in 2017, but in April 2017 the company announced that the project had been canceled, stating that the knowledge gained from this project would be applied to a future project. In August 2016, Mooney named Vivek Saxena as its new President and CEO. Under his tenure, Mooney's newest models, the M20V Acclaim Ultra and the M20U Ovation Ultra, received full FAA ceritification. Mooney also secured a partnership with the rotorcraft research company Carter Aviation Technologies, LLC to work towards the Uber Elevate initiative. In April 2017 it was announced that Saxena and Mooney had ‚Äúdecided to part ways\\", with Chief Financial Officer Albert Li assuming the role of interim executive director. It was announced in July 2017 that investors decided to shut down Mooney's research and development facilities at Chino Airport, California, and relocate to their headquarters in Kerrville, Texas. The company sold only 14 aircraft in 2018 and only 4 in the first half of 2019. The company shut down and furloughed all employees on 12 November 2019. The company was reportedly seeking new American investors to reopen, but in the meantime did not respond to inquiries from the media or from existing aircraft owners seeking support or parts. The company reopened on 2 December 2019, after being closed for 20 days. It was unclear if new financing had been secured at that time or not and the company provided no additional details. It was also unclear how many workers had returned and the company continued to not return aviation media inquiries. =2020s= On 6 January 2020 the company again laid-off all employees and did not provide them with the previously committed holiday pay owed. A company human resources employee indicated at that time that Mooney was still seeking investment, but that the company's future was unknown. On 1 September 2020 the company was taken over by a new ownership group under US Financial, LLC. The existing company management was replaced by a new CEO, Jonny Pollack, and a team consisting of \\"pilots and Mooney owners\\". The company will prioritize providing support for the existing fleet of more than 7,000 Mooney aircraft. Future priorities are anticipated to include increasing the aircraft useful loads by providing lighter parts, such as carbon fiber reinforced polymer engine cowlings. The company will then assess future design changes, including fitting ballistic parachutes, adding auto-landing capabilities and designing larger cabins.

Detail from his fresco cycle at Villa Cornaro Mattia Bortoloni (31 March 1696 ‚Äì 9 June 1750) was an important painter of the early Italian Rococo period.Fabrizio Malachin and Alessia Vedova, editors, Bortoloni Piazzetta Tiepolo: Il ‚Äò700 Veneto (Milan: Silvana Editoriale, 2010). He began his career as a student of Antonio Balestra of Verona and was active throughout northern Italy.Antonio Romagnolo, editor, Mattia Bortoloni (Rovigo: Comune di Rovigo, 1987). Accademia - Gloria di san Gaetano da Thiene (Glory of Saint Cajetan) 1729. Allegory of Merit, Ca' Rezzonico Biography For many years the growth of Bortoloni's reputation was constrained by two factors. First, his work was heavily centered on frescos (that is, wall paintings created in wet plaster), which generally must be viewed on-site and are often located in places of restricted accessibility. Second, some of his most important work became, through the years, anonymous or mis-attributed to others, including his better-known rival, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, who was born in the same year.See, e. g., Ugo Ruggeri, ‚ÄúNuove Opere di Mattia Bortoloni,‚Äù in Antonio Romagnolo, editor, Mattia Bortoloni (Rovigo, 1987), pp. 55-56. Since 1950, however, appreciation of Bortoloni's work has been revived by new scholarly discoveries and several exhibitions with informative catalogs.See Antonio Romagnolo, editor, Mattia Bortoloni (Rovigo: Comune di Rovigo, 1987), and Fabrizio Malachin and Alessia Vedova, editors, Bortoloni Piazzetta Tiepolo: Il ‚Äò700 Veneto (Milan: Silvana Editoriale, 2010). The first major breakthrough came in 1950 with publication of Nicola Ivanoff's provocative discovery that the mysterious and anonymous 104-panel fresco cycle at Villa Cornaro-Gable, the acclaimed villa in Piombino Dese designed by the Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio in 1551, was in fact the precocious work of Bortoloni, executed in 1717 when the artist was just 21 years old.Nicola Ivanoff, \\"Mattia Bortoloni e gli Affreschi Ignoti della Villa Cornaro a Piombino Dese,\\" Arte Veneta, vol. 4 (1950), pp. 123-130. Ivanoff‚Äôs careful research established that the original written contract between Bortoloni and the patron Procurator Andrea Antonio Giuseppe Cornaro dated 10 December 1716 was actually ‚Äúhidden in plain sight‚Äù in the Cornaro family archives at the Correr Museum in Venice. The new attribution and the dating of the frescos moved Bortoloni out from Tiepolo's shadow so that he could be seen as an innovative artist in his own right. Antonio Romagnolo made the point when he noted that the fresco cycle at Villa Cornaro introduces ‚Äúa richness of new elements that anticipates the rococo of Tiepolo.‚ÄùAntonio Romagnolo, ‚ÄúIl Pittore Mattia Bortoloni,‚Äù in Antonio Romangnolo, editor, Mattia Bortoloni (Rovigo, 1987), p. 20. The early 20th century brought the further discovery that Bortoloni had flexibly based his imagery at Villa Cornaro-Gable in large part upon an illustrated Bible published in Amsterdam in 1700, apparently in response to the requirement of the patron, Proc. Cornaro.Roderick Conway Morris, \\"The Irreverence of a Forgotten Master,\\" International Herald Tribune, 29 May 2010; Carl I. Gable, Villa Cornaro in the Enlightenment: Adapting a Palladian Villa to Eighteenth-Century Ideals (Atlanta: Boglewood Press, 2013). Another event prompting reevaluation of Bortoloni's work was the ambitious program launched in 1982 to restore Bortoloni's most spectacular work, the cupola of the Sanctuario Basilica ‚ÄúRegina Montis Regalis‚Äù in Vicoforte, south of Turin. Bortoloni's immense fresco ceiling spans one of the world's largest free-standing cupolas, more than 6,000 square meters in area.Ernesto Bill√≤, Santuario Basilica della Nativit√† di Maria Regina Montis Regalis, Vicoforte (Gorle: Editrice Velar, 2012), pp. 16-17, 20-21, 26-28; Marina Dell‚ÄôOmo, ‚ÄúPer il Percorso di Mattia Bortoloni in Piemonte, tra Documenti, Ipotesi e Contesti,‚Äù in Fabrizio Malachin and Alessia Vedova, editors, Bortoloni Piazzetta Tiepolo: Il ‚Äò700 Veneto (Milan: Silvana Editoriale, 2010).

Ermengol (or Armengol) VI (10961154), called el de Castilla (\\"the one from Castile\\"), was the Count of Urgell from 1102 to his death. He was the son and successor of Ermengol V and Mar√≠a P√©rez, daughter of Count Pedro Ans√∫rez, Lord of Valladolid, who became his tutor when he was orphaned in 1102. Life He was born in Valladolid, whence his nickname comes. During his minority, he was under the regency of his grandfather, Pedro Ans√∫rez, but the real power lay in the hands of Guerau II of Cabrera and Raymond Berenguer III of Barcelona. With their help, the young count conquered Balaguer in 1105 and made it his capital. Armengol collaborated with Alfonso the Battler in the 1118 capture of Zaragoza and in the expedition of Alfonso VII the Emperor, of whom he was his mayordomo mayor, against Almer√≠a in 1147. In 1133, Ermengol ceded Andorra to the Bishop of Urgell. He had good relations with the House of Barcelona and he accompanied Raymond Berenguer IV to Provence in 1144. In 1149, he assisted Raymond Berenguer in the conquest and repopulation of Lleida, receiving one-third of the city which was thenceforward of his dominion. He was a patron of several religious establishments, including Solsona Cathedral as well as the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Retuerta in Valladolid which had been founded by his father- in-law, Pedro Ansurez. On 24 March 1144, Count Ermengol drafted his will and named several executors, including his wife Elvira and his father-in-law, Count Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara. Even though he asked to be buried at Solsona Cathedral, when he died in the Kingdom of Castile on 20 June 1154, he was buried at the Monastery of Santa Mar√≠a de Valbuena, founded by his sister Stephanie, the widow of Fernando Garc√≠a de Hita and Rodrigo Gonz√°lez de Lara. Marriages and issue Before August 1126, he married Arsenda de Cabrera, daughter of Guerau II de Cabrera, first viscount of Ager, and sister of Ponce Giraldo de Cabrera. They divorced and she married as her second husband Galcer√°n de Sales, son of Arnaldo Iohannis, with whom she had a son, also named Galcer√°n de Sales, who died with his half-brother, Ermengol VII.

It is an exclusively clonal, anthropophilic saprotroph that colonizes the upper layers of dead skin, and is the most common cause of athlete's foot, fungal infection of nail, jock itch, and ringworm worldwide. Trichophyton rubrum was first described by in 1845 and is currently considered to be a complex of species that comprises multiple, geographically patterned morphotypes, several of which have been formally described as distinct taxa, including T. raubitschekii, T. gourvilii, T. megninii and T. soudanense. Growth and morphology Bottom view of a Sabouraud agar plate with a colony of Trichophyton rubrum var. rodhainii.Typical isolates of T. rubrum are white and cottony on the surface. The colony underside is usually red, although some isolates appear more yellowish and others more brownish. Trichophyton rubrum grows slowly in culture with sparse production of teardrop or peg-shaped microconidia laterally on fertile hyphae. Macroconidia, when present, are smooth-walled and narrowly club-shaped, although most isolates lack macroconidia. Growth is inhibited in the presence of certain sulfur-, nitrogen- and phosphorus-containing compounds. Isolates of T. rubrum are known to produce penicillin in vitro and in vivo. =Variants= Strains of T. rubrum form two distinct biogeographical subpopulations. One is largely restricted to parts of Africa and southern Asia, while the other consists of a population that has spread around the world. Isolates of the Afro-Asiatic subpopulation most commonly manifest clinically as tinea corporis and tinea capitis. In contrast, the globally-distributed subpopulation manifests predominantly in tinea pedis and tinea unguium. Different members of the T. rubrum complex are endemic to different regions; isolates previously referred to T. megninii originate from Portugal, while T. soudanense and T. gourvilii are found in Sub-Saharan Africa. All species included in the T. rubrum complex are \\"‚Äì\\" mating type with the exception of T. megninii which represents the \\"+\\" mating type and is auxotrophic for L-histidine. The mating type identity of T. soudanense remains unknown. Trichophyton raubitschekii, which is common from northwestern India and southeast Asia as well as parts of West Africa, is characterized by strongly granular colonies and is the only variant in the complex that reliably produces urease. In addition to the regioselectivity of these variants of the genus Trichophyton, combinations of varying species of the genus can have multiplicative effects that are invisible to the host immune system, resulting in potentially chronic infection. Diagnostic tests As a preliminary test indicating infection, plucked hairs and skin and nail scrapings can be directly viewed under a microscope for detection of fungal elements. T. rubrum cannot be distinguished from other dermatophytes in this direct examination. It can be distinguished in vitro from other dermatophytes by means of characteristic micromorphology in culture, usually consisting of small, tear-drop-shaped microconidia, as well as its usual blood-red colony reverse pigmentation on most growth media. In addition, the Bromocresol purple (BCP) milk solid glucose agar test can be used to distinguish it. Different Trichophyton species release different amounts of ammonium ion, altering the pH of this medium. In this test, medium supporting T. rubrum remains sky blue, indicating neutral pH, until 7 to 10 days after inoculation. In primary outgrowth on Sabouraud dextrose agar with cycloheximide and antibacterials, contaminating organisms may cause confusion, as T. rubrum colonies deprived of glucose by competing contaminants may grow without forming the species' distinctive red pigment. Both antibiotic- resistant bacteria and saprotrophic fungi may outcompete T. rubrum for glucose if they contaminate the sample. Red pigment production can be restored in such contaminated isolates using casamino acids erythritol albumin agar (CEA). T. rubrum cultures can be isolated on both cycloheximide-containing media and cycloheximide-free media. The latter are conventionally used for the detection of nail infections caused by non-dermatophytes such as Neoscytalidium dimidiatum. A skin test is ineffective in diagnosing active infection and often yields false negative results. Pathology Trichophyton rubrum is rarely isolated from animals. In humans, men are more often infected than women. Infections can manifest as both chronic and acute forms. Typically T. rubrum infections are restricted to the upper layers of the epidermis; however, deeper infections are possible. Approximately 80‚Äì93% of chronic dermatophyte infections in many parts of the developed world are thought to be caused by T. rubrum including cases of tinea pedis, tinea unguium, tinea manuum, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis, as well as some cases of tinea barbae. Trichophyton rubrum has also been known to cause folliculitis in which case it is characterized by fungal element in follicles and foreign body giant cells in the dermis. A T. rubrum infection may also form a granuloma. Extensive granuloma formations may occur in patients with immune deficiencies (e.g. Cushing syndrome). Immunodeficient neonates are susceptible to systemic T. rubrum infection. Trichophyton rubrum infections do not elicit strong inflammatory responses, as this agent suppresses cellular immune responses involving lymphocytes particularly T cells. Mannan, a component of the fungal cell wall, can also suppress immune responses, although the mechanism of action remains unknown. Trichophyton rubrum infection has been associated with the induction of an id reaction in which an infection in one part of the body induces an immune response in the form of a sterile rash at a remote site. The most common clinical forms of T. rubrum infection are described below. =Foot= Trichophyton rubrum is one of the most common causes of chronic tinea pedis commonly known as athlete's foot. Chronic infections of tinea pedis result in moccasin foot, in which the entire foot forms white scaly patches and infections usually affect both feet. Individuals with tinea pedis are likely to have infection at multiple sites. Infections can be spontaneously cured or controlled by topical antifungal treatment. Although T. rubrum tinea pedis in children is extremely rare, it has been reported in children as young as two years of age. =Hand= Tinea manuum is commonly caused by T. rubrum and is characterized by unilateral infections of the palm of the hand. =Groin= Along with E. floccosum, T. rubrum is the most common cause of this disease, also known as 'jock itch.' Infections cause reddish brown lesions mainly on the upper thighs and trunk, that are border by raised edge. =Nail= Once considered a rare causative agent, T. rubrum is now the most common cause of invasive fungal nail disease (called onychomycosis or tinea unguium). Nail invasion by T. rubrum tends to be restricted to the underside of the nail plate and is characterized by the formation of white plaques on the lunula that can spread to the entire nail. The nail often thickens and becomes brittle, turns brown or black. Infections by T. rubrum are frequently chronic, remaining limited to the nails of only one or two digits for many years without progression. Spontaneous cure is rare. These infections are usually unresponsive to topical treatments and respond only to systemic therapy. Although it is most frequently seen in adults, T. rubrum nail infections have been recorded in children. Epidemiology It is thought that Trichophyton rubrum evolved from a zoophilic ancestor, establishing itself ultimately as an exclusive agent of dermatophytosis on human hosts. Genetic analyses of T. rubrum have revealed the presence of heat shock proteins, transporters, metabolic enzymes and a system of up-regulation of key enzymes in the glyoxylate cycle. The species secretes more than 20 different proteases, including exopeptidases and endopeptidases. These proteases allow T. rubrum to digest human keratin, collagen and elastin; they have an optimum pH of 8 and are calcium dependent. Although T. rubrum shares phylogenetic affiliations with other dermatophytes, it has a distinctive protein regulation system. Transmission This species has a propensity to infect glabrous (hairless) skin and is only exceptionally known from other sites. Transmission occurs via infected towels, linens, clothing (contributing factors are high humidity, heat, perspiration, diabetes mellitus, obesity, friction from clothes). Infection can be avoided by lifestyle and hygiene modifications such as avoiding walking barefoot on damp floors particularly in communal areas. Treatment Treatment depends on the locus and severity of infection. For tinea pedis, many antifungal creams such as miconazole nitrate, clotrimazole, tolnaftate (a synthetic thiocarbamate), terbinafine hydrochloride, butenafine hydrochloride and undecylenic acid are effective. For more severe or complicated infections, oral ketoconazole was historically shown to be an effective treatment for T. rubrum infections but is no longer used for this indication due to the risk of liver damage as a side effect. Oral terbinafine, itraconazole or fluconazole have all been shown to be safer, effective treatments. Terbinafine and naftifine (topical creams) have been successfully treated tinea cruris and tinea corporis caused by T. rubrum. Trichophyton rubrum infections have been found to be susceptible to photodynamic treatment, laser irradiation, and photoactivation of rose bengal dye by green laser light. Tinea unguium presents a much greater therapeutic challenge as topical creams do not penetrate the nail bed. Historically, systemic griseofulvin treatment showed improvements in some patients with tinea unguium; however, failure was common even in lengthy treatment courses (e.g., > 1 yr).

Specifically, alpha secretases cleave within the fragment that gives rise to the Alzheimer's disease-associated peptide amyloid beta when APP is instead processed by beta secretase and gamma secretase. The alpha-secretase pathway is the predominant APP processing pathway. Thus, alpha-secretase cleavage precludes amyloid beta formation and is considered to be part of the non-amyloidogenic pathway in APP processing. Alpha secretases are members of the ADAM ('a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain') family, which are expressed on the surfaces of cells and anchored in the cell membrane. Several such proteins, notably ADAM10, have been identified as possessing alpha-secretase activity. Upon cleavage by alpha secretases, APP releases its extracellular domain - a fragment known as APPsŒ± - into the extracellular environment in a process known as ectodomain shedding. Cleavage of APP via alpha, beta and gamma secretase; defined functions on APP are coloured ADAM10 consists of two protein domains, a disintegrin domain and a prodomain; however, only the prodomain is required for APP processing. Other ADAM proteins, ADAM17 (also called TACE, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± converting enzyme),Detlev Ganten, Aloys Greither : Molekularmedizinische Grundlagen von altersspezifischen Erkrankungen, 2004, Springer-Verlag, ADAM9, and ADAM19 have also been identified as alpha secretases; extracellular expression of mutant ADAM9 (also known as MDC9 or meltrin gamma) lacking the membrane anchor domain has been suggested as one of many possible means of Alzheimer's prevention and treatment exploiting the alpha secretase pathway. Two distinct modalities of alpha-secretase activity have been observed in cells; constitutive activity occurs mainly at the cell surface citation needed and is independent of regulatory mechanisms inside the cell, while regulated activity occurs mainly in the golgi and is dependent on the activity of protein kinase C. Alpha-secretase activity in the golgi is thought to compete directly with the beta-secretase pathway for APP substrates during membrane protein maturation. Cell-surface cleavage by alpha secretase is very rapid after APP reaches the cell surface. The activity of alpha secretases has been implicated in the regulation of learning and memory formation. Release of the APPsŒ± ectodomain has neurotrophic effects that counteract apoptotic signaling and promote synapse formation, processes that are upregulated when ADAM10 is overexpressed. Alpha secretase activity has also been observed to be upregulated in response to the signaling peptide PACAP. Related alpha-secretases, including ADAM10, have also been implicated in similar maturation events for other transmembrane proteins such as MHC class I proteins. Recent evidence suggests that some such proteins are first processed to ectodomains by alpha secretases and subsequently cleaved by another Alzheimer's-associated protease complex, gamma secretase in its presenilin-complexed form. The Notch pathway bears many similarities to APP processing and is also regulated in part by ADAM10.

The school is under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Burlington. History The Academy was started soon after the founding of the Sisters of St. Joseph Rutland community. After they arrived, the sisters began the task of building schools starting with St. Peter's School and, in 1882, the all-girls Mount St. Joseph Academy. In 1927, the Sisters built a larger facility and opened as a co-educational academy. The academic curriculum remained the same. The advent of boys brought the introduction of a full athletics program. The music program grew to include a marching band and orchestra, with special diplomas offered in piano and violin. Drama was offered. Student activities MSJ offers a number of different extra-curricular clubs and societies. These groups include: Student Government, National Honor Society, National Art Honor Society, Yearbook Committee, Scholar's Bowl, and Soles of the Shoestring Theater.

It was founded in 1858 by the Sisters of Saint Joseph. The academy was originally located in Philadelphia on the grounds of what is now Chestnut Hill College. Originally a boarding school, the academy began accepting day students in 1911. In 1928, this all girls high school was the first Catholic school to be approved by the Middle States Association accrediting agency. In response to the growth of the school and evolving educational needs, the Mount moved in 1961 to its present site, just outside the community of Chestnut Hill near Philadelphia. Since relocation to the new campus, the school has grown significantly. Academic Program After beginning with 20 students in 1858, the Mount has a present- day student body of 560. A private day school for girls in grades nine through twelve, the Mount offers a college preparatory education in a Catholic context. The Mount adopted intensive (block) scheduling in 1997. Students now take three or four credits per term (instead of six or seven) for a total of seven or eight credits per school year. Each class period is 80 minutes long and traditional year-long courses last for 16 weeks (September to January or January to June). Facilities The school building, which was constructed during the 1960s, offers classrooms, a cafeteria, 600 seat auditorium, gymnasium, chapel, and choir room. In 1997 a new wing was completed, featuring a library/media center with computer, telecommunications and video capabilities; six classrooms; a computer/writing center, a guidance suite, and faculty areas which allow space for interdisciplinary projects and class preparations. In 2003 the art and theater rooms were renovated with additional space to become a painting and drawing room; a computer classroom with 25 computer graphics systems; separate rooms for ceramics and a kiln; and a classroom for theater arts. At the same time, the gym locker area was renovated to include a new locker room, a health class area, and a fitness center. On the campus grounds are an enclosed courtyard and playing fields. In the Fall 2004 a track field surrounding a soccer field was completed, along with two new softball fields. In 2013, a full renovation of the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) Wing was completed and air conditioning was added to the academic wings.

Georgia, which suspended capital punishment in America from 1972 until 1976. He was also the only prisoner executed in the United States that year.Staff report. (Feb. 17, 1967) Criminal Justice:The Dying Death Penalty. Time Background and crime James French was serving a life sentence in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester for killing a West Virginia motorist who had picked him up from hitchhiking in 1958. French had actually requested a death sentence for that charge, but the jury handed down a life sentence anyway, against his wishes. Dismayed, French wrote several letters to the governor asking for a new trial, one in which he could hopefully get a death sentence, but the letters went unanswered and ignored. While serving his life sentence, French was placed with inmate Eddie Lee Shelton. The two did not get along, in addition to French growing tired of prison life.van Wormer, Katherine (12/8/1995). Execution-inspired murder a form of suicide? Journal of Offender Rehabilitation Volume: 22 Issue: 3/4 As a result, on October 27, 1961, French attacked Shelton. According to Oklahoma County District Judge Charles Owens, who was an assistant attorney general during French's time on death row, French \\"determined the victim should have a last meal,\\" so he treated Shelton to a steak sandwich from the prison canteen and \\"allowed\\" Shelton to go to breakfast. Upon Shelton's return from breakfast, \\"French wrapped a towel around [Shelton‚Äôs] neck\\" and used it to strangle Shelton to death. French was fully aware of the consequences for his actions, making an immediate voluntary confession and explaining that he murdered Shelton because Shelton \\"was stupid [...] and refused to shape up.\\" When he went to trial for Shelton's murder, French asked the judge to sentence him to death and deny all future appeals because he wished to die in the electric chair, and he explained that he committed the murder to compel the state of Oklahoma to execute him. The judge obliged his request. Trials and appeals Third parties tried to save French's life during his time on death row. He won a total of three trials thanks to the efforts of attorneys working against his wishes. After the first trial, those attorneys won French a new trial based on the fact that jury members saw French in shackles while he was in court, which biased their view of him during the trial. After the second trial, attorneys argued that the judge who presided over the trial gave an improper response to an inquiry by the jury regarding what life imprisonment meant. French had his third trial in 1965. All three trials involved French making a full, voluntary, and eager confession to Shelton's murder and giving the exact same reason each time. Each trial ended with a death sentence. The third was the only one that was not successfully appealed, largely because French himself wrote to the Oklahoma Court of Appeals asking them to reject all future legal efforts made on his behalf to save his life, and the Court of Appeals obliged him. During his time on death row, psychiatric tests revealed that French was of above average intelligence. It was also revealed that unlike most death row inmates, French had completed high school and two years of post-secondary education at college. He was also the author of a book on crime compulsion called \\"We.\\" The tests also revealed that French had long been suicidal, with one psychiatrist writing that French had \\"seriously attempted suicide several times in the past but always 'chickened out' at the last minute. His basic (and obviously abnormal) motive in murdering his inoffensive cellmate was to force the state to deliver to him the electrocution to which he felt entitled and which he deeply desired.\\" Execution and last words At the time of French's execution, the death penalty was at a near standstill nationwide as a result of changing sentiments towards the death penalty. Oklahoma's last execution before French's was that of Richard Dare, who died in the electric chair on June 1, 1963. Dare was executed for murdering his father-in-law and notably spent 717 days awaiting execution after his death sentence, which was unusually long for the time. Dare was executed only after a protracted legal struggle. Charles Owens was quoted as saying, almost two decades after French's execution, that had French not aggressively pursued his own death, he likely never would have been executed because of the Furman v. Georgia ruling that was to come six years after French's execution, a ruling that would see the U.S. Supreme Court place a nationwide moratorium on the death penalty and see every state forced to resentence all condemned inmates to life imprisonment. French's psychiatrist, upon reflecting on the crimes that sent French to the death chamber, also wrote that \\"[i]f Oklahoma had not had the death penalty, it is likely that both of the men murdered by James French would still be alive.\\" Nevertheless, after French \\"resisted all efforts to spare his life,\\" he walked calmly into the execution chamber at 10:00 p.m on August 10, 1966; the Associated Press reporter at the scene wrote that \\"James Donald French got what he demanded: death in the electric chair,\\" and commented that \\"He faced death with the same cockiness he faced life.\\" \\"Cocky Slayer Gets Wish: Execution\\", AP report in Wilmington (DE) News-Journal, August 11, 1966, p. 1 In later years, French's last words before his death by electric chair would be said to have been \\"How's this for your headline? 'French Fries'\\".Tibballs, Geoff (2004). The Mammoth Book of Zingers, Quips, and One-Liners. Carroll & Graf. The story appeared as early as 1977 in The Book of Lists, but contemporaneous accounts of the execution mentioned only one of the inmate's remarks, and reported that when prison warden Ray Page asked if French had any last words, \\"French replied: 'Everything's already been said.'\\" \\"Gets His Wish, Dies In Chair\\", Cincinnati Enquirer, August 11, 1968, p. 1 French himself did make a quip about French fries. However, the remark was not made at his execution, but days prior, when French discussed his upcoming execution with reporter Bob Gregory. Gregory attended the execution and corroborated that French's real last words were, \\"Everything's already been said.\\" Days prior, however, Gregory had met with French for an interview in the office of the warden of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. During the interview, Gregory reported that the following exchange took place: The execution of James French was the last execution by electric chair in the United States before Furman v. Georgia. Overall, it was the third to last nationwide, only being succeeded by that of Aaron Mitchell in California's gas chamber on April 12, 1967, and Luis Monge in Colorado's gas chamber on June 2, 1967. After the moratorium on capital punishment was lifted, Gary Gilmore became the first person to be executed nationwide when he volunteered for death by firing squad in Utah on January 17, 1977. Two years later, the first post-Furman electrocution occurred when John Spenkelink was executed in Florida on May 25, 1979. References External links *French v.

[See: Early texts of Shakespeare's works.] Nothing is known of Simmes's early life or personal history. He was active as a printer starting in 1585. Shakespeare In an eight-year period from 1597 through 1604, Simmes printed nine Shakespearean quartos for various London stationers or booksellers. For the bookseller Andrew Wise, Simmes printed: * Richard III, Q1 (1597) * Richard II, Q1 (1597) * Richard II, Q2 (1598) * Richard II, Q3 (1598) For Wise and William Aspley, Simmes printed: * Henry IV, Part 2, Q (1600) * Much Ado About Nothing, Q (1600) For Thomas Millington, Simmes printed: * Henry VI, Part 2, Q2 (1600)This Q2 of 2H6 was the early alternative text, The First Part of the Contention Betwixt the Two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster.

Also for Nicholas Ling, Simmes printed Q3 of The Taming of a Shrew (1607), the alternative version of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. (Scholars dispute the exact nature of the relationship between the two versions.)Halliday, pp. 483-4. And for Thomas Pavier, Simmes printed Q1 of Sir John Oldcastle (1600), a play of the Shakespeare Apocrypha.Chambers, Vol. 3, pp. 306-7. For \\"the Widow Newman,\\" Simmes printed the second, 1607 edition of Lawrence Twine's The Pattern of Painful Adventures, one of the sources for Shakespeare's Pericles, Prince of Tyre.

In Simmes's era, the specialties of printer and bookseller/publisher were usually practiced separately, though some individuals, like William Jaggard, functioned in both. Simmes normally kept to the printshop side of the business, though he did occasionally publish too, as with the first quartos of George Chapman's Humorous Day's Mirth and Thomas Dekker's Shoemaker's Holiday. Other works Best known for his printing of plays, Simmes worked on non-dramatic projects as well; he printed Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum (1611) for the bookseller Richard Bonian ‚Äì a volume of poems by Emilia Lanier, it was one of the very rare books by a woman published in that era.Grossman, p. 1. For John Clapham's The History of Great Britain (1606), he was both printer and publisher. Reputation While Simmes is recognized as among the best printers of his generation, a cynic might complain that this is not saying much -- that it merely identifies Simmes as the best of a bad lot. Simmes, or his compositors, allowed 69 typographical errors in Richard II, Q1; when they printed Q2 they corrected 14 of these typos, but added 123 new ones.Halliday, p. 386. Apart from his reputation for quality, Simmes \\"was constantly in trouble for printing unauthorized works, and in 1622 was forbidden to work as a master printer.\\"Halliday, p. 454.

John Alexander (October 21, 1923 ‚Äì December 8, 1990) was an American operatic tenor who had a substantial career during the 1950s through the 1980s. He had a longstanding relationship with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City, singing with that company every year between 1961 and 1987 for a total of 379 performances. He also periodically performed at the New York City Opera during his career and was a frequent presence at the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company during the late 1950s and 1960s. Although he spent most of his career in New York City, Alexander occasionally traveled to perform as a guest artist with many of the world's leading opera houses, both in the United States and Europe. He was also an active concert singer throughout his career. While most of Alexander's career was spent in lyric roles from the Italian and French repertory, Alexander had enough heft in his voice to successfully tackle some of the lighter Heldentenor roles of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss. Aside from a handful of these roles, however, his repertoire at the Metropolitan did not include heavier parts. Rather, he was known there for an expansive lyric repertoire that encompassed the works of Mozart, Puccini, Verdi, and Donizetti among others. His signature roles included Alfredo in La traviata, Arbace in Idomeneo, Belmonte in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail, the Duke of Mantua in Rigoletto, Edgardo from Lucia di Lammermoor, Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte, Hoffman in Les contes d'Hoffmann, Lieutenant B. F. Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly, Rodolfo in La boh√®me, and the title roles in Don Carlos and Faust. Early life and career Alexander was born and raised in Meridian, Mississippi. He attended the University of Cincinnati College- Conservatory of Music, earning a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance. Many years later, while still working regularly for the Metropolitan Opera, he returned to the conservatory as a member of the voice faculty. In 1951 Alexander moved to New York City to begin studying voice further under Robert Weede and with the intent of pursuing a performance career. That same year he auditioned for and was accepted as a member of the Charles Wagner Opera Company, a touring company which traveled throughout North America. He traveled widely with the company during the Fall of 1951, notably portraying Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata opposite a young Beverly Sills as Violetta. In the spring of 1952 he made his first appearance with at an actual opera house as the title hero in Charles Gounod's Faust with Cincinnati Opera. The following fall he once again traveled with the Charles Wagner Opera Company, this time singing Don Jos√© in Bizet's Carmen opposite Sill's Mica√´la. Over the next five years he appeared in several houses throughout the United States including the Baltimore Opera Company and the Houston Grand Opera. In 1957 Alexander made his debut with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company as Lieutenant Pinkerton in Puccini's Madama Butterfly opposite Dorothy Kirsten as Cio-Cio San. That same year he made his first appearance with the New York City Opera singing the role of Alfredo. The following year he returned to the New York City Opera to portray the role of Henry Morosus for the United States premiere of Richard Strauss's Die schweigsame Frau. He continued to perform periodically at the New York City Opera up through the 1970s, notably excelling as Walther in Wagner's Die Meistersinger and as Bacchus in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos. In 1958 he created the role of Lucentio is the first staged performance of Vittorio Giannini's The Taming of the Shrew. On February 10, 1958, Alexander portrayed the role of Rodolfo opposite Elaine Malbin's Mim√¨ in Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me for the very first opera performance given by the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company. He returned several more times for performances with that company, including portrayals of Vicomte Camille de Jolidon in Die lustige Witwe (1958), Lieutenant Pinkerton (1959, 1962, 1963), Sir Edgardo di Ravenswood in Lucia di Lammermoor (1960, 1961), Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte (1960), Alfredo (1961, 1963, 1972), Faust (1967), Gennaro in Lucrezia Borgia (1969), and Roberto, conte di Leicester in Maria Stuarda (1974). Later life and career In 1961 Alexander joined the roster of the Metropolitan Opera where he sang regularly for the next 26 years. He made his first appearance on the Met stage as Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte on December 19, 1961 with Teresa Stich-Randall as Fiordiligi, Rosalind Elias as Dorabella, Theodor Uppman as Guglielmo, Roberta Peters as Despina, and Frank Guarrera as Don Alfonso. His other roles at the Met included Alfredo, Anatol in Barber's Vanessa, Arbace, Belmonte, Don Carlos, Cassio in Otello, Cavaradossi in Tosca, Des Grieux in Manon, Des Grieux in Manon Lescaut, the Duke of Mantua, Edgardo, Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus, Elvino in La Sonnambula, Faust, Goffredo in Rinaldo, Grigory in Boris Godunov, Fernando in La favorita, Hoffmann, the Italian Singer in Der Rosenkavalier, Kodanda in Menotti's The Last Savage, Lensky in Eugene Onegin, Lionel in Martha, the title role in Lohengrin, Maurizio in Adriana Lecouvreur, Narraboth in Strauss's Salome, Pinkerton, Pollione in Norma, Riccardo in Un ballo in maschera, Rodolfo in La boh√®me, Rodolfo in Luisa Miller, Roland in Esclarmonde, Tamino in The Magic Flute, Tito in La clemenza di Tito, Tonio in La Fille du R√©giment, and Walther von Stolzing in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg among others. During his long and distinguished career at the Met, Alexander sang opposite many famous artists, including the Met debuts of Renata Scotto (Pinkerton to her Butterfly), Montserrat Caball√© (Faust to her Marguerite) and, in the same night as Caball√©, Sherrill Milnes' (who portrayed Valentin). His last performance at the Met was on October 5, 1987 portraying Bacchus opposite Jessye Norman's Ariadne in Ariadne auf Naxos. Although Alexander worked mostly out of New York City he did occasionally travel to perform in other opera houses. In 1967 he made his debut with the San Francisco Opera as Julien in Gustave Charpentier's Louise. He returned to that company a few more times during his career, singing Rodolfo (1969), Pollione (1972), and Hoffmann (1987). Also in 1967, Alexander sang the role of Paul in Korngold's Die tote Stadt for his first performance with the Vienna Volksoper. The following year he sang the role of Rodolfo in La boh√®me at the Vienna State Opera. In 1970 he made his Royal Opera House at Covent Garden debut as Pollione and in 1973 he sang for the first time with the Opera Company of Boston as the title role in Verdi's Don Carlos. In 1975 he made his first appearance with the Opera Company of Philadelphia as Calaf in Turandot opposite Elinor Ross in the title role. He also performed in a few roles with the Berlin State Opera, the Bavarian State Opera, and the Cincinnati Opera. Alexander sang relatively few performances outside of New York City, a conscious choice on his part. He chose to not travel in favor of having a stable life with his wife Sue and their daughter, Cindy. The family made their home on Long Island during the late 1950s through the early 1970s. At this point, Alexander joined the voice faculty at his alma mater in Cincinnati, Ohio. The family then relocated to Cincinnati while maintaining an apartment on the West Side of Manhattan for Alexander to use when he was in town for rehearsals and performances at the Met. In 1990 Alexander died suddenly of a heart attack at the Temple Theater in Meridian, Mississippi, the city where he was born. He was 67 years of age, and still actively performing and teaching at the time of his death. Recordings Alexander may be seen on such videos as Mozart's Idomeneo (also starring Luciano Pavarotti, in Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's production, 1982) and Donizetti's Roberto Devereux (with Beverly Sills and Susanne Marsee, in Tito Capobianco's production, 1975). His discography includes recordings of Bellini's Norma (with Dame Joan Sutherland and Marilyn Horne, 1964) and Donizetti's Anna Bolena (opposite Elena Souliotis, 1968‚Äì69). Additionally, VAI has released his 1967 performance, in New Orleans, of Massenet's Manon, with Caball√© and Louis Quilico. Videography * Mozart, W.

It was later developed in the university debate by Antony Flew, who made several important alterations such as changing the gardeners to explorers and making the original \\"long neglected garden\\" a clearing in the jungle. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on faith and assertions based on scientific evidence, and the problems associated with unfalsifiable beliefs. Flew's main claim in using the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to \\"falsify\\" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. Thus Flew concludes that religious believers cause God to \\"die the death of a thousand qualifications\\". In Flew's version, the tale runs as follows: > Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the > clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, \\"Some > gardener must tend this plot.\\" The other disagrees, \\"There is no gardener.\\" > So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. \\"But > perhaps he is an invisible gardener.\\" So they set up a barbed-wire fence. > They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. > G.

He served as the president of several universities, most notably the University of Texas at Austin from 1939 to 1944.  Early life  Rainey was born in Clarksville, Texas. Although raised by a poor farming family, he graduated at valedictorian of Lovelady High School in 1913. He previously attended high school at Ferris and grade school in Eliasville. After becoming a Baptist minister, he enlisted in World War I. After receiving his bachelor's degree at Austin College, he played for various teams in the Texas League. Early academic career Rainey began his career in higher education by teaching education at Austin College for three years before receiving his masters and doctorate at the University of Chicago. After receiving his doctorate, he taught for three years at the University of Oregon, then became the president of Franklin College in Indiana from 1927-1931 before becoming the director of the American Youth Commission of the American Council on Education. From 1931 to 1935, he was the president of Bucknell University. Subsequently, he served as director of the American Youth Commission of the American Council on Education for four years.  Presidency and controversy at University of Texas  In 1939, Rainey was named President of University of Texas at Austin, at the time the largest university not only in Texas but also in the entire southern half of the United States. The makeup of the board, however, soon changed due to appointments over the next several years by governors W. Lee O'Daniel and Coke R. Stevenson. Clashes started in 1941, when several members of the Board pressured Rainey to fire four full professors of economics who espoused New Deal views. In 1942 the regents fired three untenured economics instructors and a fourth who had only a one-year appointment for having attempted to defend federal labor laws at an antiunion meeting in Dallas. Rainey protested their dismissals, and he also protested the fact that tenure was weakened and funding for social science was cut completely. The most spectacular single issue dividing Rainey from the regents was the board's repression of John Dos Passos's U.S.A. (trilogy) and its efforts to fire the professor who placed the third volume of the trilogy, The Big Money (1936), on the English department's sophomore reading list. The regents deemed the work subversive and perverted. Since the selection had been a committee decision no one was fired, but Rainey was outraged at what he believed to be a witch-hunt. All this, along with the fact that he tried to move the Medical Branch from Galveston to Austin a couple years earlier, caused the board to fire him on November 1, 1944, without citing any reason. After the firing, 8,000 students went on strike and protested at the university and at the state capitol. Less than three months after Rainey's firing, the governor appointed new board members. While the new members increased funding for social science and rehired the aforementioned fired professors, they did not re-hire Rainey. Several organizations, including the American Association of University Professors, the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, and Phi Beta Kappa, reprimanded the university for firing Rainey. The censure by the American Association of University Professors lasted nine years, until the organization was convinced that the regents changed their policies.  Later career  In 1946, he ran for the Democratic Primary for Governor of Texas, but lost in the primary to Beauford H. Jester, who eventually was elected governor. After his defeat, he left Texas entirely and became president of Stephens College in Missouri, then a professor at the University of Colorado Boulder.  Later life and death  After his retirement, he stayed in Boulder, where he died in 1985.  Legacy  Despite the controversy and eventual firing, he is a symbol for academic freedom, even to this day, according to the University of Texas' website. He also is believed to be the 1st candidate for a statewide office in Texas supported by labor unions and minorities. Rainey has received numerous honors and awards, including the Robert L. Stearns Award and the outstanding professor award from the University of Colorado, as well as receiving an honorary doctorate, the founders medal, the distinguished alumnus award from Austin College. He also was elected to their athletic hall of fame and an award was named after him.

West co-founded Actyl Group, a human resource recruitment agency. She serves as the company president. West returned to the University of Manitoba in 2015 to teach in the Asper School of Business. Activist and political candidate West first ran for public office in the 2003 provincial election, as a candidate of the Progressive Conservative Party. She initially sought the party's nomination for Riel, but lost to former Member of the Legislative Assembly Shirley Render at a nomination meeting in late 2002.Mia Rabson, \\"Render wins nomination to run for Tories in Riel\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 13 December 2002, A7. During the nomination contest, one PC insider suggested that West's views on private health care would be a liability for the party.Daniel Lett, \\"Membership dispute delays Tory vote\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 1 November 2002, A1. West subsequently convened a public meeting on Manitoba's physician shortage, which was held at Winnipeg's Transcona Inn in early 2003. During the question and answer session, she announced that she was considering a candidacy in the division of Radission. The political overtones of this meeting were noted in a newspaper report, though West denied that it had been called for political purposes.Alexandra Paul, \\"West eyes Radisson riding in run for office\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 5 February 2003, A5; Linda West, \\"NDP was invited to health panel\\" [letter], Winnipeg Free Press, 13 February 2003, A15. She won the Radisson nomination, but lost to New Democratic Party candidate Bidhu Jha in the general election. The Manitoba Nurses' Union criticized West in late 2003, after she led a group of her own fourth-year undergraduate students in a rally outside the provincial legislature supporting an on-the-job training program. It was alleged that the students received a portion of their grade for participating in the rally, but West said that her students were taught to review both sides of the issue.Mia Rabson, \\"Nursing students rally for job training\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 4 December 2003, B1.

She ran for the new party in the 2006 federal election, and finished second against New Democratic Party incumbent Bill Blaikie in Elmwood‚ÄîTranscona. West's Ph.D. credentials became a source of controversy during the 2006 federal election because Washington International University is an institution that is licensed but not accredited by any educational oversight body in Canada or the United States of America. West challenged Bidhu Jha a second time in the 2007 provincial election, initially centering her campaign around local opposition to a hog-processing plant planned for construction in the Radisson area. The NDP government withdrew its support for the project during the election, and indicated that the plant would not be built. Some NDP insiders nevertheless expressed concern that their early support for the unpopular project had made the seat vulnerable.\\"12 key areas to watch this election\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 21 April 2007, A6; Mary Agnes Welch, \\"Intravenous drug clinic to open in Transcona\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 May 2007, A6.

She was built as a TE (Buckley) type destroyer escort in the United States and delivered to the Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease arrangement. Construction and design The was one of six classes of destroyer escorts built for the US Navy to meet the massive demand for escort vessels following America's entry into World War Two. While basically similar, the different classes were fitted with different propulsion gear and armament. The Buckleys had a turbo-electric drive, and a main gun armament of 3-inch guns. The Buckley- (or TE) class ships were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a mean draft of . Displacement was standard and full load. Two boilers fed steam to steam turbines which drove electrical generators, with in turn powered electric motors that propelled the ship. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . of oil was carried, giving a range of at . The ship's main gun armament consisted of three 3-inch (76 mm) 50 caliber dual-purpose (i.e. anti-surface and anti-aircraft) guns, two forward and one aft, in open mounts. Close in armament consisted of two 40 mm Bofors guns, backed up by eight single Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. A triple mount of 21-inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes provided a capability against larger ships, while anti-submarine armament consisted of a Hedgehog forward-firing anti- submarine mortar and four depth charge throwers and two depth charge rails. Crew was 200 officers and other ranks. The ship, which was originally planned to become USS McAnn with the hull number DE-73, was laid down on 19 April 1943 at Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation's Hingham Shipyard, in Hingham, Massachusetts. DE-73 was re-allocated to Great Britain under the Lend-Lease programme on 10 June 1943. The ship was launched on 10 July 1943, with the name HMS Balfour and commissioned on 7 October 1943, with the pennant number K464. Commanding officers Commanding Officers were Lt Cdr C D B Coventry RN on commissioning with Cdr C Gwinner RN (Senior Officer 1st Escort Group) taking over after the loss of on 26 December 1944 when HMS Balfour became the lead ship for the 1st Escort Group. Actions HMS Balfour served with both the 1st Escort Group and 18th Escort Group earning battle honours for service in the North Atlantic, off Normandy and in the English Channel. In February 1944, Balfour was part of the 1st Support Group, supporting convoys to the west of Ireland. In June 1944, the Allies invaded Normandy, and the 1st Escort Group, including Balfour, was one of six Escort Groups deployed to form a barrier about 130 miles west of Lands End to prevent German U-Boats based in the French Atlantic ports from interfering with the landings. These Escort Groups were later moved into the Channel, and on 25 June 1944 the 1st Escort Group was searching south east of Torquay for a submarine that had torpedoed the frigate when Balfour detected a sonar contact. Balfour attacked with Hedgehog, which resulted in several explosions and a slick of oil. Balfour and sister ship then followed up with depth charges. At the time, the two frigates were credited with sinking with the loss of all hands. The Kriegsmarine had U-1191 listed as missing (no radio contact) since 12 June 1944. The Admiralty later withdrew the credit for sinking U-1191, declaring that the cause of that submarine's loss was unknown. Other sources indicate that Balfour and Affleck had attacked the wreck of the submarine , sank earlier the same day, and that U-1191 was sunk by British destroyers and frigates on 3 July. On the afternoon of 18 July 1944, Balfour attacked the submarine with depth charges. Although U-672 managed to slip away from Balfour, she was badly damaged, and early on 19 July, the submarine surfaced and was scuttled by its commanding officer. All hands (52 crew and officers) were rescued and spent the rest of the war as prisoners of war. This action took place in the English Channel north of Guernsey at position . In December 1944, Balfour was Senior Officer's ship in the 18th Escort Group, operating out of Greenock. By March‚ÄìApril 1945, Balfour had returned to the 1st Escort Group, operating out of Portsmouth against German submarines in the Channel. Disposal Following the end of the war, Balfour was returned to the United States, transferring back to the US Navy at New York on 25 October 1945, and keeping the name Balfour.

The company has been a subsidiary of Bed Bath & Beyond since being acquired in 2012. History Cost Plus opened its first store at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco, California, in 1958. Founder William Amthor discovered that San Franciscans loved imported discount retail merchandise when he sold some extra rattan furniture. Amthor operated a small family-owned furniture store in San Francisco at the time, but instead of displaying the rattan furniture in his store, he rented of warehouse space in the Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco. The rattan furniture sold quickly, convincing Amthor to start importing merchandise as a new business. He opened his first store devoted exclusively to imported merchandise later in 1958 and began importing wicker by the shipload.

During the Heian period, the area came under the control of Kagami Tomomitsu (1143 - 1230), a local warlord and progenitor of the Takeda clan and became the Buddhist bett≈ç temple controlling the nearby Shinto shrine of Takeda Hachiman-gu (in what is now Nirasaki, Yamanashi), the tutelary shrine of the spirits of the Takeda clan. The temple was relocated in 1208 to its present location. The temple continued to be sponsored by the Takeda clan through the Sengoku period, and was later protected by Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu after the fall of the Takeda clan. In the Edo period, Shogun Tokugawa Iemitsu confirmed the temple's landholdings, which included nine subsidiary temples and 20 chapels in 1642. However, the temple burned down in 1781 and never regained its former prosperity. During World War II the entire region along with the temple was destroyed in a bombing raid with just one statue of Fudo Myo-o, The Buddhist Spirit of Disciple and Firm Moral survived.

Preparation  Sevai is mostly made fresh starting from rice grains. It is also prepared from dried sevai packs (or rice sticks) like the instant ones in the Asian grocery stores. Traditionally, making of sevai at home consists of the following steps (with minor variations based on location and family customs): *Soaking of parboiled rice in cold water for about 3 hours *Grinding of soaked rice using a wet grinder into a fine paste *Making of dumplings from the rice paste and steaming the chunks (at least three variations are known in this step as follows) **Saut√©eing the paste into dough, make dumplings (also called kozhukkottais, steam the same on an idli vessel) **pour the paste into moulds of the idli vessel and steam the same **Saut√©eing the paste into dough, make dumplings, drop the same into boiling water and through cook **Saut√©eing the paste into dough, make medium-sized balls of the dough and pass it through \\"sevai press\\" into idli plates and then steam it *Pressing of cooked dumplings into fine strands using a type of sevai press  Ingredients  Homemade sevai is often made from 100% rice (in addition to water and salt) whereas dry rice sticks may often have some additives like tapioca, corn starch, etc. Instant rice noodles have other additives like Wheat gluten, Guar gum, edible starch, etc. In Southern parts of Karnataka, shyaavige is made of different grains with different consistencies. When made with ragi or millet the vermicelli is fatter, whereas when made with rice or wheat the strands are thinner.  Sevai versus Idiyappam  Sevai is similar to idiyappam, in the ingredients and preparation. Sevai, unlike idiyappam, is typically broken or cut up rather than in piles of noodles. In this way, sevai is treated almost as a substitute for rice. Idiyappam, by contrast, is served almost as a substitute for appam with side dishes like curries or kormas. Tamarind, lemon & coconut sevai. The press used to make sevai and idiyappam are essentially the same. Sevai is also typically not served with curries other side dishes, but rather mixed with a flavoring like lemon, tamarind paste, coconut, or uddina pudi (a type of powder made from black gram dal in Karnataka). Called shavige in Karnataka, it can also be prepared with cooked vegetables and tempered with spices with a dash of lemon juice. Sevai is typically served in Tamil Nadu and other South Indian communities as a breakfast or tiffin dish, but also served as a dessert such as payasam when cooked in milk with cardamom or other spices and sugar. The cuisine of Kongu region in Tamilnadu has a variation of this with a name Santhagai and included in wedding ceremony rituals of the region. In the Malnad region of Karnataka, it may be served with chicken curry, rather unlike how it is usually served in other parts of South India. Sankethi communities also differ from the norm in that they prepare idiyappam and serve it like sevai, flavored with lemon, tamarind, or uddina pudi. Other variants of sevai (or idiyappam for that matter) can be made with ragi, jowar, or other grains are served plain with accompaniments like sweetened coconut milk and various edible powders that include powdered chickpea and sesame. In Tamil Nadu santhakai is often flavoured with lemon, tamarind, tomato, coconut, curd etc. and is usually eaten warm.

Although Garry and Phil were former pro skateboarders, Custom Floor was never a skate rock band, instead displaying a heavy Sonic Youth influence. They've described their music as \\"a large dose of guitar, bass and drums-based rock all big banged out into a wide array of minor notes, ringing octaves, heavy distortion, hovering harmonics, cymbal crashes, drum splashes and big-britches bass throb.\\"  History  Custom Floor released their first seven-inch record on Goldenrod Records in late 1991, and started playing frequent live shows throughout Southern California in 1992-'93. The first Custom Floor LP, Clear Day, was released in December 1993 on their own Analog Sound Recordings label, and was supported with a full U.S. tour in Summer 1994‚Äîthe second half of which was spent opening for fellow San Diegans Drive Like Jehu.

The presence of the independent German states in the region (particularly Prussia), and later the German Empire and also in other multi-ethnic countries, such as Austria-Hungary, Poland, Imperial Russia, etc., demonstrates the extent and duration of German-speaking settlements. In the German language the German populations in these parts of Europe are commonly referred to as Volksdeutsche. The number of ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe dropped dramatically as the result of the post-1944 German flight and expulsion from Central and Eastern Europe. There are still a substantial number of ethnic Germans in the countries that are now Germany and Austria's neighbors to the east--Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Slovenia. In addition, there are or have been significant populations in such areas as Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Moldova (more specifically Bessarabia), Ukraine, Russia, and Kazakhstan. Early Middle Ages settlement area In the early Middle Ages, Charlemagne had subdued a variety of Germanic peoples in Central Europe dwelling in an area roughly bordered by the Alps in the South, the Vosges Mountains in the West, the North Sea and Elbe River in the North and the Saale River in the East. These inhomogeneous Germanic peoples comprised several tribes and groups who either formed, stayed or migrated into this area during the Migration Period. After the Carolingian Empire was divided, these people found themselves in the eastern part, known as East Francia or Regnum Teutonicum, and over time became known as Germans. The area was divided into the stem duchies of Swabia (Alamannia), Franconia, Saxony, and Bavaria (including Carinthia). Later, the Holy Roman Empire would be constituted largely, but not exclusively of these regions. Medieval settlements (Ostsiedlung) The fortress Ordensburg Marienburg in Malbork, founded in 1274, the world's largest brick castle and the Teutonic Order's headquarters on the river Nogat. The medieval German Ostsiedlung (literally Settling eastwards), also known as the German eastward expansion or East colonization refers to the expansion of German culture, language, states, and settlements to vast regions of Northeastern, Central and Eastern Europe, previously inhabited since the Great Migrations by Balts, Romanians, Hungarians and, since about the 6th century, the Slavs.Peter Heather, Empires and Barbarians: Migration, development and the birth of Europe (2009), pp. 389-396. The affected territory stretched roughly from modern Estonia in the North to modern Slovenia in the South. Population growth during the High Middle Ages stimulated the movement of peoples from the Rhenish, Flemish, and Saxon territories of the Holy Roman Empire eastwards into the less-populated Baltic region and Poland. These movements were supported by the German nobility, the Slavic kings and dukes, and the medieval Church. The majority of this settlement was peaceful, although it sometimes took place at the expense of Slavs and pagan Balts (see Northern Crusades). Ostsiedlung accelerated along the Baltic with the advent of the Teutonic Order.Sebastian Haffner, The Rise and Fall of Prussia, pp. 6‚Äì10. Likewise, in Styria and Carinthia, German communities took form in areas inhabited by Slovenes. In the middle of the 14th century, the settling progress slowed as a result of the Black Death; in addition, the most arable and promising regions were largely occupied. Local Slavic leaders in late Medieval Pomerania and Silesia continued inviting German settlers to their territories. In the outcome, all previously Wendish territory were settled by a German majority and the Wends were almost completely assimilated. In areas further east, substantial German minorities were established, which either kept their customs or were assimilated by the host population. The density of villages and towns increased dramatically. German town law was introduced to most towns of the area, regardless of the percentage of German inhabitants. =Areas settled during Ostsiedlung= Stages of German eastern settlement, 700‚Äì1400 The following areas saw German settlement during the Ostsiedlung: * within current Germany: Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Holstein * the former eastern territories of Germany: Pomerania, East Brandenburg, East Prussia, Silesia * Sudetenland (Sudeten Germans) * Transylvania as well as significant parts of Moldavia (especially Bukovina) and Wallachia (Transylvanian Saxons) * Carpathian Mountains (Carpathian Germans) * Memelland, Estonia and Latvia (Baltic Germans) * Poland (see History of Poland during the Piast dynasty)) ::Walddeutsche * Bulgaria (see Germans in Bulgaria) * Slovenia (see Gottscheers) * and Others =German-run enterprises resulting in German settlements= The ethnic composition of East Prussia by the 14th century. The term Letts is a historical name for Latvians.\\"Lett\\" at Oxford Dictionaries\\"Lett\\" at Merriam-Webster Online Hanseatic League Between the 13th and 17th centuries, trade in the Baltic Sea and Central Europe (beyond Germany) became dominated by German trade through the Hanseatic League (). The league was a Low-German-speaking military alliance of trading guilds that established and maintained a trade monopoly over the Baltic and to a certain extent the North Sea. Hanseatic towns and trade stations usually hosted relatively large German populations, with merchant dynasties being the wealthiest and political dominant fractions. Teutonic Knights From the second half of the 13th century to the 15th century, the crusading Teutonic Knights ruled Prussia through their monastic state. As a consequence, German settlement accelerated along the southeastern coast of the Baltic Sea. These areas, centered around Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig) and K√∂nigsberg, remained one of the largest closed German settlement area outside the Holy Roman Empire. 17th to 19th century settlements =Thirty Years' War aftermath= When the Thirty Years' War devastated Central Europe, many areas were completely deserted, others suffered severe population drops. These areas were in part resettled by Germans from areas hit less. Some of the deserted villages, however, were not repopulated - that is why the Middle Ages' density of settlements was higher than today's. =Poland= In the 16th and 17th centuries, settlers from the Netherlands and Friesland, often of Mennonite faith, founded villages in Royal Prussia, along the Vistula River and its tributaries, and in Kujawy, Mazovia and Wielkopolska. The law under which these villages were organized was called the Dutch or Olƒôder law; such villages were called Holendry or Olƒôdry. The inhabitants of such villages were called Olƒôdrzy, regardless of their ethnicity. In fact, the vast majority of Olƒôder villages in Poland were settled by ethnic Germans, usually Lutherans, who spoke the Low German dialect called Plautdietsch.Jerzy Sza≈Çygin, Katalog Zabytkow Osadnictwa Holenderskiego Na Mazowszu (Warsaw: DiG Wydawnictwo, 2004), pp. 15-28 =Danube Swabians of Hungary and the Balkans= With the decline of the Ottoman Empire, German settlers were called into devastated areas of Hungary, by then comprising a larger area than today, in the late 17th century. The Danube Swabians settled in Swabian Turkey and other areas, more settlers were called in even throughout the 18th century, in part to secure Hungary's frontier with the Ottomans. The Banat Swabians and Satu Mare Swabians are examples of Danube Swabian settlers from the 18th century. An influx of Danube Swabians also occurred toward the Adriatic coast in what would later become Yugoslavia. Settlers from Salzkammergut were called into Transylvania to repopulate areas devastated by the wars with the Turks. They became known as Transylvanian Landler. =Galicia= After the First Partition of Poland the Austrian Empire took control of south Poland, later known as Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. The colonization of the new crown land began afterwards, especially under the rule of Joseph II. =Russian Empire= Since 1762, Russia called in German settlers. Some settled the Volga area northwest of Kazakhstan and therefore became known as Volga Germans. Others settled toward the coast of the Black Sea (Black Sea Germans, including Bessarabia Germans, Dobrujan Germans, and Crimea Germans) and the Caucasus area (Caucasus Germans). These settlements occurred throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries. In the late 19th century, many Vistula Germans (or Olƒôdrzy) immigrated to Volhynia, as did descendants of early Mennonite settlers, whose ancestors had lived in West Prussia since the Ostsiedlung. Prussia imposed heavy taxes due to their pacifist beliefs. In Russia, they became hence known as Russian Mennonites. According to the 1926 (1939) census, there were 1,238,000 (1,424,000) Germans living in the Soviet Union, respectively.Ezra Mendelsohn, Jews and Other Ethnic Groups in a Multi-ethnic World, 1987, p.85, , =Turkey= Since the 1840s, Germans moved to Turkey who by then had become an ally of the German Empire. Those settling in the Istanbul area became known as Bosporus Germans. 1871‚Äì1914 Prussia (green) within the German Empire 1871‚Äì1918. A map of Austria-Hungary, showing areas inhabited by ethnic Germans in red according to the 1910 census. By the 19th century, every city of even modest size as far east as Russia had a German quarter and a Jewish quarter. Travellers along any road would pass through, for example, a German village, then a Czech village, then a Polish village, etc., depending on the region. Certain parts of Central and Eastern Europe beyond Germany, especially those close to the border of Germany contained areas in which ethnic Germans constituted a majority. =German Empire and European nationalism= The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of nationalism in Europe. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion. The concept of nationalism was based on the idea of a people who shared a common bond through race, religion, language and culture. Furthermore, nationalism asserted that each people had a right to its own nation. Thus, much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of \\"one people, one nation\\". In 1871, the German Empire was founded, partly as a German nation-state. This is closely associated with chancellor Otto von Bismarck. While the empire included German settled Prussian regions formerly outside of its predecessors, it also included areas with Danish, Kashub and other minorities. In some areas, such as the Province of Posen or the southern part of Upper Silesia, the majority of the population were Poles. Ethnic German Austria remained outside the empire, and so did many German-settled or mixed regions of Central and Eastern Europe. Most German settled regions of South Central and Southeastern Europe were instead included in the multi-ethnic Habsburg monarchy of Austria-Hungary. =Ostflucht= Starting in the late 19th century, an inner-Prussian migration took place from the very rural eastern to the prospering urban western provinces of Prussia (notably to the Ruhr area and Cologne), a phenomenon termed Ostflucht. As a consequence, these migrations increased the percentage of the Polish population in Posen and West Prussia.Andrzej Chwalba - Historia Polski 1795-1918 pages 175-184, 461-463 Driven by nationalist intentions, the Prussian state established a Settlement Commission as countermeasure, that was to settle more Germans in these regions. In total 21,886 families (154,704 people) out of planned 40,000 were settled by the end of its existence. The history of the forced expulsions of the Polish population is further explored in the Expulsion of Poles by Germany. 1914‚Äì1939 =World War I= By World War I, there were isolated groups of Germans as far southeast as the Bosporus (Turkey), Georgia, and Azerbaijan. After the war, Germany's and Austria- Hungary's loss of territory meant that more Germans than ever were minorities in various countries, the treatment they received varied from country to country, and they were, in places subject to resentful persecution from former enemies of Germany. Perceptions of this persecution filtered back into Germany, where reports were exploited and amplified by the Nazi party as part of their drive to national popularity as savior of the German people. Streckerau an der Wolga: a German village in Russia, 1920. Russian German refugees stranded in Schneidem√ºhl (Pi≈Ça), 1920. The advance of allied German Empire and Habsburg monarchy forces into the Russian Empire's territory triggered actions of flight, evacuation and deportation of the population living in or near the combat zone. Russian Germans became subject to severe measures because of their ethnicity, including forced resettlement and deportation to Russia's East, ban of German language from public life (including books and newspapers), and denial of economical means (jobs and land property) based on \\"liquidation laws\\" issued since 1915; also Germans (as well as the rest of the population) were hit by \\"scorched earth\\" tactics of the retreating Russians.Jochen Oltmer, Migration und Politik in der Weimarer Republik, 2005, pp.151,152, , 9783525362822 About 300,000 Russian Germans became subject to deportations to Siberia and the Bashkir steppe, of those 70,000-200,000 were Germans from Volhynia, 20,000 were Germans from Podolia, 10,000 were Germans from the Kiev area, and another 11,000 were Germans from the Chernihiv area.Jochen Oltmer, Migration und Politik in der Weimarer Republik, 2005, p.153, , 9783525362822 From Russian areas controlled by the German, Austrian and Hungarian forces, large scale resettlements of Germans to these areas were organized by F√ºrsorgeverein (\\"Welfare Union\\"), resettling 60,000 Russian Germans, and Deutsche Arbeiterzentrale (\\"German Workers' Bureau\\"), resettling 25,000-40,000 Russian Germans.Jochen Oltmer, Migration und Politik in der Weimarer Republik, 2005, p.154, , 9783525362822 Two thirds of these persons were resettled to East Prussia, most of the remaining in the northeastern provinces of Prussia and Mecklenburg. =Danzig and the Polish corridor= Germans from the former Province of Posen cross the demarcation line at ZbƒÖszy≈Ñ, 1920. When Poland regained its independence after World War I, the Poles hoped to regain the city of Danzig to provide the free access to the sea which they had been promised by the Allies on the basis of Woodrow Wilson's \\"Fourteen Points\\". Since the population of the city was predominantly German it was not placed under Polish sovereignty. It became the Free City of Danzig, an independent quasi-state under the auspices of the League of Nations governed by its German residents but with its external affairs largely under Polish control. The Free City had its own constitution, national anthem, parliament (Volkstag), and government (Senat). It issued its own stamps and currency, bearing the legend \\"Freie Stadt Danzig\\" and symbols of the city's maritime orientation and history. From the Polish Corridor, many ethnic Germans were forced to leave throughout the 1920s and 1930s, while Poles settled in the region building the sea port city Gdynia (Gdingen) next to Danzig. The vast majority of Danzig's population favoured eventual return to Germany. In the early 1930s the Nazi Party capitalized on these pro-German sentiments, and in 1933 garnered 38 percent of vote for the Danzig Volkstag. Thereafter, the Nazis under the Bavaria-born Gauleiter Albert Forster achieved dominance in the city government - which, nominally, was still overseen by the League of Nations' High Commissioner. Nazi demands, at their minimum, would have seen the return of Danzig to Germany and a one kilometer, state- controlled route for easier access across the Polish Corridor, from Pomerania to Danzig (and from there to East Prussia).No. 98. Message which was communicated to H.M. Ambassador in Berlin by the State Secretary on August 31, 1939, at 9:15 p. m.: ... (8) In order to guarantee to Germany free communication with her province of Danzig-East Prussia, and to Poland her connexion with the sea after the execution of the plebiscite-regardless of the results thereof-Germany shall, in the event of the plebiscite area going to Poland, receive an extra-territorial traffic zone, approximately in a line from Butow to Danzig or Dirschau, in which to lay down an autobahn and a 4-track railway line. The road and the railway shall be so constructed that the Polish lines of communication are not affected, i.e., they shall pass either over or under the latter. The breadth of this zone shall be fixed at 1 kilometre, and it is to be German sovereign territory. Should the plebiscite be favourable to Germany, Poland is to obtain rights, analogous to those accorded to Germany, to a similar extra-territorial communication by road and railway for the purpose of free and unrestricted communication with her port of Gdynia; yale.edu, in The British War Bluebook: Documents Concerning the German Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939.

By this time, however, Hitler had Soviet backing and had decided to attack Poland. Germany feigned an interest in diplomacy (delaying the Case White deadline twice), to try to drive a wedge between Britain and Poland.See Documents Concerning the German Polish Relations and the Outbreak of Hostilities between Great Britain and Germany on September 3, 1939.

German nationalists used the existence of large German minorities in other countries as a basis for territorial claims. Many of the propaganda themes of the Nazi regime against Czechoslovakia and Poland claimed that the ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) in those territories were persecuted. There were many incidents of persecution of Germans in the interwar period, including the French invasion of Germany proper in the 1920s. The German state was weak until 1933 and could not even protect itself under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The status of ethnic Germans, and the lack of contiguity of German majority lands resulted in numerous repatriation pacts whereby the German authorities would organize population transfers (especially the Nazi-Soviet population transfers arranged between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and others with Benito Mussolini's Italy) so that both Germany and the other country would increase their homogeneity. However, these population transfers were considered but a drop in the pond, and the \\"Heim ins Reich\\" rhetoric over the continued disjoint status of enclaves such as Danzig and K√∂nigsberg was an agitating factor in the politics leading up to World War II, and is considered by many to be among the major causes of Nazi aggressiveness and thus the war. Adolf Hitler used these issues as a pretext for waging wars of aggression against Czechoslovakia and Poland.

The status of ethnic Germans, and the lack of contiguity resulted in numerous repatriation pacts whereby the German authorities would organize population transfers (especially the Nazi‚ÄìSoviet population transfers arranged between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and others with Benito Mussolini's Italy) so that both Germany and the other country would increase their \\"ethnic homogeneity\\". =Resettlement of Germans from the Baltic States and Bessarabia= German populations affected by the population exchanges were primarily the Baltic Germans and Bessarabia Germans and others who were forced to resettle west of the Curzon Line. The Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact had defined \\"spheres of interest\\", assigning the states between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to either one of those. Except for Memelland, the Baltic states were assigned to the Soviet Union, and Germany started pulling out the Volksdeutsche population after reaching respective agreements with Estonia and Latvia in October 1939. The Baltic Germans were to be resettled in occupied Poland and compensated for their losses with confiscated property at their new settlements. Though resettlement was voluntary, most Germans followed the call because they feared repression once the Soviets would move in.Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries, pp 158ff Eventually, this actually happened to the ones who stayed. The Baltic Germans were moved to Germany's northeastern port cities by ship. Poles were expelled from West Prussia to make space available for resettlement, but due to quarrels with the Gauleiter Albert Forster, resettlement stalled and further \\"repatriants\\" were moved to Posen. =Resettlement of Germans from Italy= On October 6, 1939, Hitler announced a resettlement program for the German-speaking population of the Italian province of South Tyrol. With an initial thought to resettle the population in occupied Poland or the Crimea, they were actually moved to places in nearby Austria and Bavaria. Also affected were German speakers from other areas in northern Italy, like the Kanaltal and Gr√∂dnertal valleys. Resettlement stopped with the collapse of Mussolini's regime and the subsequent occupation of Italy by Nazi Germany.Valdis O. Lumans, Himmler's Auxiliaries, pp 154-157 =German \\"Volksdeutsche\\" in Nazi-occupied Europe= The actions of Germany ultimately had extremely negative consequences for most ethnic Germans in Central and Eastern Europe (termed Volksdeutsche to distinguish them from Germans from within the Third Reich, the Reichsdeutsche), who often fought on the side of the Nazi regime - some were drafted, others volunteered or worked through the paramilitary organisations such as Selbstschutz, which supported the German invasion of Poland and murdered tens of thousands of Poles. In places such as Yugoslavia, Germans were drafted by their country of residence, served loyally, and were even held as POWs by the Nazis, and yet later found themselves drafted again, this time by the Nazis after their takeover. Because it was technically not permissible to draft non-citizens, many ethnic Germans ended up being (oxymoronically) forcibly volunteered for the Waffen-SS. In general, those closest to Nazi Germany were the most involved in fighting for her, but the Germans in remote places like the Caucasus were likewise accused of collaboration. German exodus after Nazi Germany's defeat The 20th century wars annihilated most Eastern and East Central European German settlements, and the remaining sparse pockets of settlement were subject to emigration to Germany in the late 20th century for economical reasons. =Evacuation, and flight of Germans during the end of World War II= By late 1944, after the Soviet success of the Belorussian Offensive in August 1944, the Eastern Front became relatively stable. Romania and Bulgaria had been forced to surrender and declare war on Germany. The Germans had lost Budapest and most of the rest of Hungary. The plains of Poland were now open to the Soviet Red Army. Starting on January 12, 1945, the Red Army began the Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive which was followed a day later by the start of the Red Army's East Prussian Offensive. German populations in Central and Eastern Europe took flight from the advancing Red Army, resulting in a great population shift. After the final Soviet offensives began in January 1945, hundreds of thousands of German refugees, many of whom had fled to Danzig by foot from East Prussia (see evacuation of East Prussia), tried to escape through the city's port in a large-scale evacuation that employed hundreds of German cargo and passenger ships. Some of the ships were sunk by the Soviets, including the Wilhelm Gustloff, after an evacuation was attempted at neighboring Gdynia. In the process, tens of thousands of refugees were killed. Cities such as Danzig also endured heavy Western Allied and Soviet bombardment. Those who survived and could not escape encountered the Red Army. On 30 March 1945, the Soviets captured the city and left it in ruins. =The Yalta Conference= As it became evident that the Allies were going to defeat Nazi Germany decisively, the question arose as to how to redraw the borders of Central and Eastern European countries after the war. In the context of those decisions, the problem arose of what to do about ethnic minorities within the redrawn borders. The final decision to move Poland's boundary westward was made by the US, Britain and the Soviets at the Yalta Conference, shortly before the end of the war. The precise location of the border was left open. The western Allies also accepted in general the principle of the Oder River as the future western border of Poland and of population transfer as the way to prevent future border disputes. The open question was whether the border should follow the eastern or western Neisse rivers, and whether Stettin, the traditional seaport of Berlin, should remain German or be included in Poland. The western Allies sought to place the border on the eastern Neisse, but Stalin insisted that the border should be on the western Neisse. Poland's old and new borders, 1945. =The Potsdam Conference= At the Potsdam Conference the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union placed the German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line (Poland referred to by the Polish communist government as the \\"Western Territories\\" or \\"Recovered Territories\\") as formally under Polish administrative control. It was anticipated that a final peace treaty would follow shortly and either confirm this border or determine whatever alterations might be agreed upon. The final agreements in effect compensated Poland for 187,000 km¬≤ located east of the Curzon Line with 112,000 km¬≤ of former German territories. The northerneastern third of East Prussia was directly annexed by the Soviet Union and remains part of Russia to this day. It was also decided that all Germans remaining in the new and old Polish territory should be expelled, to prevent any claims of minority rights. Among the provisions of the Potsdam Conference was a section that provided for the orderly transfer of German populations. The specific wording of this section was as follows: > The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, > recognize that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements > thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be > undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected > in an orderly and humane manner. =Expulsion of Germans after World War II= The expulsion of Germans after World War II refers to the forced migration and ethnic cleansing of German nationals (Reichsdeutsche) and ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) from the former eastern territories of Germany, former Sudetenland and other areas across Europe in the first five years after World War II. It was the largest of a number of expulsions in various Central and Eastern European countries affecting a number of nationalities. The Big Three had agreed on a policy of expulsions, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Poland implemented the policy with American and British acquiescence. The policy had been agreed on by the Allies as part of the reconfiguration of postwar Europe. As the Red Army advanced towards Germany at the end of World War II, a considerable exodus of German refugees began from the areas near the front lines. Many Germans fled their areas of residence under vague and haphazardly implemented evacuation orders of the Nazi German government in 1943, 1944, and in early 1945, or based on their own decisions to leave in 1945 to 1948. Others remained and were later forced to leave by local authorities. Census figures in 1950 place the total number of ethnic Germans still living in Central and Eastern Europe at approximately 2.6 million, about 12 percent of the pre-war total. The majority of the flights and expulsions occurred in Czechoslovakia, Poland and the European Soviet Union. Others occurred in territories of northern Yugoslavia (predominantly in the Vojvodina region), and other regions of Central and Eastern Europe. The total number of the Germans expelled after the war will remain unknown, but was estimated by various scientific approaches. Most of the past research provided a combined estimate of 13.5-16.5 million people, including those that were evacuated by German authorities, fled or were killed during the war. However, recent research places the number at above 12 million, including all those who fled during the war or migrated later, forcibly or otherwise, to both the Western and Eastern zones of Germany and to Austria. Recent analyses have led some historians to conclude that the actual number of deaths attributable to the flight and expulsions was in the range of 500,000 to 1.1 million. The earlier higher figures, up to 3.2 million, typically include all war-related deaths of ethnic Germans between 1939‚Äì45, including those who served in the German armed forces. When Romania signed a peace treaty with the Soviets in 1944, the German military began withdrawing the Transylvanian Saxons from Transylvania; this operation was most thorough with the Saxons of the N√∂snerland. Around 100,000 Germans fled before the Soviet Red Army, but Romania did not conduct the expulsion of Germans as did neighboring countries at war's end. However, more than 80,000 Saxons were arrested by the Soviet Army and sent to labour camps in Siberia for alleged cooperation with Germany. Most of those belonging to the Yugoslavian-German minority were interned at camps and eventually expelled from the country. The majority went to Austria and West Germany. However, there were a number of people who stayed, because they were married to local partners. These people and their descendants were no longer officially considered a part of the German population. Recent history =Expelled Germans in postwar Germany= After World War II many expellees (German: Heimatvertriebene) from the land east of the Oder-Neisse found refuge in both West Germany and East Germany. Refugees who had fled voluntarily but were later refused to return are often not distinguished from those who were forcibly deported, just as people born to German parents that moved into areas under German occupation either on their own or as Nazi colonists. In a document signed 50 years ago the Heimatvertriebene organisations have also recognized the plight of the different groups of people living in today's Poland who were by force resettled there. The Heimatvertriebene are just one of the groups of millions of other people, from many different countries, who all found refuge in today's Germany. Some of the expellees are active in politics and belong to the political right-wing. Many others do not belong to any organizations, but they continue to maintain what they call a lawful right to their homeland. The vast majority pledged to work peacefully towards that goal while rebuilding post-war Germany and Europe. The expellees are still highly active in German politics, and are one of the major political factions of the nation, with still around 2 million members. The president of their organization is as of 2004 still a member of the national parliament. Although expellees (in German Heimatvertriebene) and their descendants were active in West German politics, the prevailing political climate within West Germany was that of atonement for Nazi actions. However, the CDU governments have shown considerable support for the expellees and German civilian victims. =Polish‚ÄìGerman relations= Relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany have generally been cordial since 1991. Status of the German minority in Poland The remaining German minority in Poland (152,897 people according to the 2002 census) has minority rights on the basis of the Polish‚ÄìGerman treaty and minority law. German parties are not subject to the 5% threshold during the Sejm elections so Germans are able to obtain two seats. There are German speakers throughout Poland, but only the voivodeship of Opole/Oppeln has a larger concentration. Finalization of the Polish‚ÄìGerman border For decades, the CDU-controlled German government considered the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line to be completely unacceptable. Even the Social Democrats of the SPD initially refused to accept the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line. The 1991 Polish‚ÄìGerman border agreement finalized the Oder‚ÄìNeisse line as the Polish‚ÄìGerman border. The agreement gave to minority groups in both countries several rights, such as the right to use national surnames, speak their native languages, and attend schools and churches of their choice. These rights had been denied previously on the basis that the individual had already chosen the country in which they wanted to live. Restricting sale of property to foreigners In November 2005 Der Spiegel published a poll from the Allensbach Institute which estimated that 61% of Poles believed Germans would try to get back territories that were formerly under German control or demand compensation., There are also some worries among Poles that rich descendants of the expelled Germans would buy the land the Polish state confiscated in 1945. It is believed that this may result in large price increases, since the current Polish land price is relatively low. This led to Polish restrictions on the sale of property to foreigners, including Germans: special permission is needed. This policy is comparable to similar restrictions on the Baltic √Öland Islands. These restrictions were lifted 12 years after the 2004 accession of Poland to the European Union, i.e. on May 1, 2016. The restrictions were weak and not valid for companies and certain types of properties. The attempts by German organisations to build a Centre Against Expulsions dedicated to German people's suffering during World War II has led Polish politicians and activists to propose a Center for Martyrology of Polish Nation (called also Center for the Memory of Suffering of the Polish Nation) that would document the systematical oppression conducted on Polish people by German state during World War II and which would serve to educate German people about atrocities their state and regime conducted on their neighbours. However, this proposal was attacked and rejected by German politicians. =German minority in the Czech Republic= There are about 40,000 Germans remaining in the Czech Republic. Their number has been consistently decreasing since World War II. According to the 2001 census there remain 13 municipalities and settlements in the Czech Republic with more than 10% Germans. The situation in Slovakia was different from that in the Czech lands, in that the number of Germans was considerably lower and that the Germans from Slovakia were almost completely evacuated to German states as the Soviet army was moving west through Slovakia, and only the fraction of them that returned to Slovakia after the end of the war was deported together with the Germans from the Czech lands. The Czech Republic has introduced a law in 2002 that guarantees the use of native minority languages (incl. German) as official languages in municipalities where autochthonous linguistic groups make up at least 10% of the population. Besides the use in dealings with officials and in courts the law also allows for bilingual signage and guarantees education in the native language. Czech‚ÄìGerman relations On 28 December 1989, V√°clav Havel, at that time a candidate for president of Czechoslovakia (he was elected one day later), suggested that Czechoslovakia should apologize for the expulsion of ethnic Germans after World War II. Most other politicians of the country did not agree, and there was also no reply from leaders of Sudeten German organizations. Later, the German President Richard von Weizs√§cker answered this by apologizing to Czechoslovakia during his visit to Prague on March 1990 after V√°clav Havel repeated his apology characterizing the expulsion as \\"the mistakes and sins of our fathers\\". However, the Bene≈° decrees continue to remain in force in Czechoslovakia. In Czech‚ÄìGerman relations, the topic has been effectively closed by the Czech‚ÄìGerman declaration of 1997. One principle of the declaration was that parties will not burden their relations with political and legal issues which stem from the past. However, some expelled Sudeten Germans or their descendants are demanding return of their former property, which was confiscated after the war. Several such cases have been taken to Czech courts. As confiscated estates usually have new inhabitants, some of whom have lived there for more than 50 years, attempts to return to a pre-war state may cause fear. The topic comes to life occasionally in Czech politics. Like in Poland, worries and restrictions concerning land purchases exist in the Czech Republic. According to a survey by the Allensbach Institut in November 2005, 38% of Czechs believe Germans want to regain territory they lost or will demand compensation. =German minority in Hungary= Today the German minority in Hungary have minority rights, organisations, schools and local councils but spontaneous assimilation is well under way. Many of the deportees visited their old homes after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1990. In 2001, 62,105 people declared to be German and 88,209 people had affinity with cultural values, traditions of the German nationality. =German minority in Romania= Numerous Romanian Germans have emigrated to Germany, especially after 1989 and are represented by the Association of Transylvanian Saxons in Germany (). Due to this emigration from Romania, the population of native Germans there has been dwindling constantly over the course of the previous decades (for example, in absolute figures: 359,109 in 1977 and then only 60,088 in 2002). Furthermore, these Germans (i.e. the Transylvanian Saxons, Banat Swabians, Sathmar Swabians, Bukovina Germans, Transylvanian Landler, Zipser Germans, Regat Germans, and Dobrujan Germans) remaining in Romania are represented by the Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania ().

A significant figure in Catholic resistance to Nazism in France, he was recognised as Righteous among the Nations by Yad Vashem for his efforts to protect Jews from the Nazi Holocaust. Biography Pierre-Marie Th√©as was born on September 14, 1894 in Barzun, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques. He was ordained as a priest on September 16, 1920 and was consecrated as the Bishop of Montauban on July 26, 1940. In 1940 he was present at the last days of the former Spanish President Manuel Aza√±a, and offered support to his widow. =Resistance to Nazism= When the Archbishop of Toulouse, Jules-G√©raud Sali√®ge, led a powerful denunciation of the mistreatment of Jews in 1942, Th√©as joined other French bishops in denouncing the roundup of Jews for deportation to Nazi death camps.The Catholic Hierarchy in France during the War and the Persecution of the Jews, by Ren√©e B√©darida, at Yad Vashem website He wrote a pastoral letter condemning the Nazi deportation of Jews in the summer of 1942 in which he said: \\"I give voice to the outraged protest of Christian conscience and I proclaim‚Ä¶ that all men, whatever their race or religion, have the right to be respected by individuals and by states.\\" For his attempts to prevent the Jewish deportations and persecutions he was later honoured as \\"Righteous Among The Nations\\" by Yad Vashem. The protest of the bishops is seen by various historians as a turning point in the formerly passive response of the Catholic Church in France. Marie-Rose Gineste transported a pastoral letter from Bishop Th√©as of Montauban by bicycle to forty parishes, denouncing the uprooting of men and women \\"treated as wild animals\\", and the French Resistance smuggled the text to London, where it was broadcast to France by the Radio Londres service of the BBC, reaching tens of thousands of homes.Martin Gilbert; The Righteous - The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust; Doubleday; 2002; ; p.230 Th√©as continued to oppose the Nazi policies culminating in a fiery sermon in his cathedral in 1944 in which he condemned the \\"Cruel and inhuman treatment of one of our fellow men\\". He was arrested the night after the sermon by the Gestapo. He was sent to a concentration camp where he spent ten weeks and then was released and returned to his parish. =Post-war= After the war, in March 1945, he became the first president of the movement for reconciliation and peace named Pax Christi. The group, initiated by Marthe Dortel Chaudot, aimed at first mainly at the reconciliation between France and Germany, but in 1952 it was recognized by Pope Pius XII as an official Catholic Peace Movement. On February 17, 1947 he was appointed the Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes by Pope Pius XII, and retired on February 12, 1970. On retirement he was appointed to the titular see of Sanctus Germanus, from which he resigned later in the same year. He was noted for his belief in Liberation Theology. He has been credited as saying: :\\"Urged on by unrestrainable forces, today's world asks for a revolution. The revolution must succeed, but it can succeed only if the Church enters the fray, bringing the Gospel. After being liberated from Nazi dictatorship, we want to liberate the working class from capitalist slavery.\\" He died on April 3, 1977.

It is not a mountain range in the normal sense, because it was formed as a single volcano that has been eroded for the past 5 million years. It lies on the Chilcotin Plateau, located some north-northwest of Vancouver and 30 km north of Anahim Lake. The highest peak of the range is Far Mountain. The range supports a unique grassland ecosystem. This type of grassland has not been seen anywhere else in central and southern British Columbia. The climate is cool and dry; typical of higher elevations of the Interior Plateau. The long West Road River rises in the Ilgachuz Range and flows east to its confluence with the Fraser River between Prince George and Quesnel. It drains an area of approximately 12,000 km2 and loses over 900 m elevation before joining the Fraser. Geology and history =Origins= Location of Anahim hotspot in millions of years ago, including the Anahim Volcanic Belt The Ilgachuz Range began erupting 6.1 million years ago and has grown steadily since then. Like all of the Anahim volcanoes, the Ilgachuz Range has its origins in the Anahim hotspot--a plume of magma rising from the Earth's mantle in central British Columbia. The hotspot remains in a fixed position, while the North American Plate drifts over it at a rate of 2 to 3.3 centimetres per year. The upwelling of the hot magma creates volcanoes, and each individual volcano erupts for a few million years before the movement of the plate carries it away from the rising magma. However, where hotspots occur under continental crust, basaltic magma is trapped in the less dense continental crust, which is heated and melts to form rhyolites. Due to their high content of crystals and gasses, rhyolites initiate violent eruptions, though their water content is low and they have a relatively low temperature (around 800-900 ¬∞C when erupted, whereas basalt can have a temperature of over 1200 ¬∞C). The hotspot has existed for at least 13 million years, and the Anahim Volcanic Belt stretches almost away from the hotspot. More recently, the hotspot has formed the Itcha Range and Nazko Cone, a cinder cone east of the Ilgachuz Range and the youngest Anahim volcano. The Ilgachuz Range is the largest of these, although the Rainbow Range is the largest of all volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt. =First Nations= The first recorded ascent of the Ilgachuz Range was by the South Carrier and Chilcotin tribes. They have lived in the area for hundreds of years, travelling when necessary to hunt and trap animals such as beaver, caribou, moose, and to gather plants and roots. Fishing camps were also established in the area. The Ilgachuz Range is, or was, an important source of obsidian for the South Carrier and Chilcotin tribes. Obsidian was greatly desired because very sharp arrowheads and cutting knives could be made from it. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, creating razorlike edges. It was also used for jewelry. Anahim obsidian was traded extensively throughout the BC Interior and up and down the Coast from Bella Coola. Red ochre used in paint and decoration was also obtained from this area. Structure Southern flank of the Ilgachuz Range The Ilgachuz Range is the second largest shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt which includes other immediately nearby ranges, the Rainbow Range and Itcha Range. It stands at above sea level - slightly shorter than its neighbor, Rainbow Range. It has a diameter of . The Ilgachuz Range was created by two chemically separate magmatic periods; an early complex series of trachyte and rhyolite eruptions, and late extrusion of a sequence of basaltic lava flows. Evacuation of the volcano's magma chamber resulted in the failure of one or more centrally located calderas. It is divided into Precaldera, Dome Forming, Intra Caldera and Shield Forming assemblages. The Precaldera Assemblage is best exposed on the east side of Pipe Organ Mountain where it contains a bedded pile over 300 m thick of weakly consolidated, moderately to extremely different, pyroclastics, flows and deposits of uncertain origin. Colours range from mottled green to grey, yellow, ochre, red and white. A green tuffbreccia composed of pumice fragments, feldspar crystals and minor debris is recognizable in several areas.Report on Preliminary Geology and Geochemistry of the Ilga Claim group Retrieved on 2007-10-11 Smooth northern flanks of the Ilgachuz Range are remnants of the original shield volcano The Dome Forming Assemblages include most of the rhyolite domes, related flows and the Ilgachuz Comendite. The northerly domes are subcircular talus mounds of plate sized pieces of light to dark grey, slightly porphyritic, flowbanded rhyolite with minor obsidian. Massive to banded chalcedony blobs and veinlets are related with these domes. The southern domes are somewhat different in nature, comprising intrusive and extrusive phases of cream colored porphyries. The Sax Dome contains an upper portion of cream coloured, aphanitic to fine quartz porphyry felsite with abnormal green glass filled fractures, and a lower unit of microsyenite with red and green glassy zenocrysts. The Intra Caldera Assemblage is best exposed on the north edge of the caldera. The lower unit, indicative of caldera formation, is an epiclastic boulder-landslide deposit, roughly bedded and dipping into the caldera. Similar material, grading up into finer debris flows and possibly lahars, has been uncertainly known in the gap between Phacelia Peak and Calliope Mountain suggesting this area is the southern edge of the caldera. Alternatively, largely unsorted breccia and debris deposits exist on the ridge north of Saxifraga Peak, possibly indicating the main, or a subsidiary, caldera edge. The Shield Forming Assemblage contains a series of basalt and minor comendite eruptions, and is best exposed on Far Mountain and Mount Scot. The basalts issued from fissure vents primarily located peripheral to the calderas. Brick red cinder deposits are considered to be a late phase of this assemblage. Provincial Park Surrounding and including the range is Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park, a 112,000-hectare park of unique landscape in the West Chilcotin Uplands while the Rainbow Range lies partly in the Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park. The park includes volcanic landforms, alpine environments, and forest sites scattered with wetlands. Itcha Ilgachuz Provincial Park is extremely remote and unroaded; the closest communities are Anahim Lake, Alexis Creek, Nimpo Lake, Redstone, and Nazko. The closest major centre is Quesnel, located approximately 200 km east of the park.

Dodd Mead) Seventeenth Summer is a young adult novel written by Maureen Daly and published in 1942. Daly was born in Ireland but grew up in Wisconsin. Before writing Seventeenth Summer she wrote a short story entitled \\"Sixteen\\". Daly began writing the novel when she was 17. After graduation from high school Daly attended Rosary College in River Forest, Illinois. She wrote all of her life, as did her three sisters. Maureen Daly died in 2006. Plot summary Seventeenth Summer is a book about a 17-year- old girl named Angeline \\"Angie\\" Morrow. It takes place in the early 1940s in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Angie gets asked out on her first date by local high school basketball star, Jack Duluth. They fall in love, knowing that Angie has to leave for college in Chicago in the fall and Jack is moving with his family to Oklahoma to help his uncle with the bakery business. Jack falls in love with Angie, but Angie never says that she loves him back, so the question is, does she? Although Jack spontaneously proposes to Angie at an end-of-summer party, they both know they are too young. The novel ends with a heartfelt goodbye at the train station: Jack gives Angie his class ring and Angie goes away to school, knowing she will never forget Jack or her seventeenth summer. Characters = Main Characters = *Angeline \\"Angie\\" Morrow: Main character and narrator of the novel. She dates Jack and the book shows their young love. Her family is very proper and although she starts hanging out with a rougher crowd she remains proper and wholesome throughout the novel.

The growth of the love between Jack and Angie is symbolized in the novel by the growth of plants‚Äîat the beginning of the summer everything is lush and green, but as it ends the autumn frosts are setting in. The love has a distinct beginning at the start of summer and a distinct death at the end of summer. There is also a theme of propriety (definition) in the novel. While Jack introduces Angie to a crowd whose behavior conflicts with the way she was raised, she retains her sense of propriety and never becomes a flirt or goes wild. Lorraine does not behave properly (according to the mores of the time), and because of this is embarrassed to be with her own family (first on the Fourth of July, then when she sees Angie and Jack out on a date, and finally when she leaves for school). The novel also explores the pressure of appearances, or adherence to social norms. Angie often worries about how a girl is supposed to act towards a boy, or how people view her when she goes out without a date. A group of boys called the \\"checkers\\" often gather in the drugstore or on the street corner to keep an eye on who is dating whom; Angie considers people to be important if the checkers pay attention to them. When she starts dating Jack, she is pleased to be seen dating and to be a part of the in crowd. Literary significance and criticism Some critics claim that \\"the modern period of young adult literature is often said to have begun with Seventeenth Summer\\".Vogel, Nancy. \\"The Semi centennial of Seventeenth Summer: Some Questions and Answers.\\" The ALAN Review 21 (Spring 1994): 41. Daly is a teen writing for teens and her work influenced other writers to write specifically with the young adult audience in mind. Dwight Burton claims that, because Daly was so near adolescence herself, \\"Seventeenth Summer captures better any other novel, the spirit of adolescents.\\"Burton, D. H. Dwight. The Novel for the Adolescent. The English Journal. 40.7. 363‚Äì369. The book was controversial for its time. Though the relationship between Jack and Angie remains chaste, the novel addresses the topic of sexuality and desire in a way that had not been done before in a work of adolescent fiction. It also portrays underage drinking and smoking, both of which were considered highly improper in the 1940s.

Ru. Jotapianus (died c. 249) or Jotapian, also known as Iotapianus or Iotapian, was a usurper in the eastern provinces of the Roman Empire during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab, around 249. Jotapianus is known from his rare coins and from accounts in Aurelius Victor (Caesares xxix.2), Zosimus (i.20.2 and i.21.2), and Polemius Silvius (Laterculus).  Life  =Origins= Jotapianus was a member of the Near East indigenous aristocracy. His name is similar to those of Queen Julia Iotapa and her daughter, princess Julia Jotapa of the Kingdom of Commagene, so he could have been a member of the Royal Family of Commagene, which had lost its power in favour of the Romans under Emperor Vespasian in 72. Aurelius Victor reports that Jotapianus claimed descendance from an Alexander. According to some scholars, he referred to Alexander Severus, while other scholars note that King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene claimed descendance from Greek King Alexander the Great. He could be a possible descendant of Gaius Julius Agrippa or his brother Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus or his sister Julia Iotapa. =Revolt and Death= Jotapianus led a rebellion started in Syria, towards the end of Philip's rule, against the increase in taxation ordered by the rector Orientis Priscus, Philip's brother. It is possible that Philip somehow favoured his Arabia over the other Eastern provinces, since his rule was not quietly accepted by the local population. Jotapianus made Antioch his capital, but the rebellion came to an end and Jotapianus was killed by his own soldiers, possibly during Emperor Decius' rule. =Coinage= Coins issued by Jotapianus had been found. All of them are antoniniani, all of them show a crude design, and all of them have a VICTORIA AVG reverse, celebrating a victory of the rebels over Philip troops or rather \\"the power of the Emperor to conquer\\" (Roman Imperial Coins, 4.3). It has been suggested that Jotapianus also issued Aureus, none of which are known to have survived. The coins are the only source for his names, M. F. RV., which could be expanded as Marcus Fulvius Rufus. Furthermore, their style suggest that the revolt was short and spread over a small territory, since Jotapianus controlled no major mint. =References= *Meckler, Michael and Christian K√∂rner, \\"Jotapianus\\", s.v. \\"Philip the Arab and Rival Claimants of the later 240s\\", in DIR (1999). 249 deaths 3rd-century Roman usurpers Year of birth unknown Fulvii ","title":"Jotapianus"},{"id":"9785446","text":"Tanilba Bay is a suburb of the Port Stephens local government area in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. It is located on the Tilligerry Peninsula adjacent to the bay from which it got its name. \\"Tanilba\\" is said to mean \\"place of white flowers\\" in a local Indigenous language, presumably a reference to the flannel flowers which formerly thrived in the area. At the Tanilba Bay had a population of 3,156. Tanilba Bay Public School is a co-ed government primary school located at 1A King Albert Avenue. Tanilba House The centrepiece of this small town is Tanilba House, on Caswell Crescent, which is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register along with The Temple of the Stork nearby. It is one of Australia's oldest buildings and the oldest in Port Stephens. In 1831 Lieut William Caswell, Royal Navy, received a land grant of , along with an assignment of convicts who cleared the land and built Tanilba House from locally quarried quartz porphry stone and lime mortar made on the property from oyster shells. A small gaol was also built on the southern side of the house. Ten acres (4 hectares) on the eastern side of the hill was used as a vineyard soon after the house was built. An olive tree planted in the vineyard survives to this day and is heritage listed. A bunya pine, the wisteria covered pergola and two Port Jackson figs are also specifically listed. William and Susan Caswell had 11 children in total but two young sons died at the house. The Caswells were impacted by drought and deprived of most of their workforce due to the ceasing of transportation of convict labour by the English government and left the house in 1840s. The house was left uninhabited and became derelict until the late 1800s. Significant restoration and repair of the house was conducted by Elizabeth Holmes in the 1890s using the same builder who built Stanley Park in Fullerton Cove. In 1931 Tanilba House was owned by Henry Halloran who designed such structures as \\"The Temple\\", which is behind Tanilba House and which is visible on the main road leading to the house, the stone circular driveway, a wishing chair and other decorative stone structures on the property plus the elaborate gates at what were then the north and south entrances to the town. The stone for these structures was quarried locally from . The northern gates are known as the water gates as they were designed to welcome visitors approaching from the water. Due to expansion the gates now stand inside the what were originally the suburb limits. Tanilba House has been recently restored and is used as a home and wedding or function venue. Tours, high teas and accommodation are also available. The main beach The main beach in Tanilba Bay is located on the southern side of Port Stephens and runs from east to west. The eastern part of the beach accessed along a board walk with steps down to small inlets that provide access to the beach under the protection of native trees that a known for their koala population. The centre and western parts of the beach are flanked by various picnic areas and parks and boat ramps with the westernmost end having a wide stretch of sandy beach. At very low tide the sandy flats are exposed and on occasions during the high tide the water covers all the sand. The bay is protected from southerly winds which makes it a popular place for water sports such as skiing. Located along the western end of the bay is a large sandy beach.

Career In 1940, John Entenza joined California Arts and Architecture magazine as editor. By 1943, he had completely overhauled the magazine and renamed it Arts & Architecture Magazine. During his editorship, Arts & Architecture Magazine championed all that was new in the arts, with special emphasis on emerging modernist architecture in Southern California. He made it the first American magazine to popularize the work of Hans Hofmann, Craig Ellwood, Margaret DePatta, George Nakashima, Bernard Rosenthal, Charles Eames, Konrad Wachsmann, Jan De Swart and many others. Entenza served as director of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts in Chicago from 1960 until his retirement in 1971. He received a Distinguished Service citation from the American Institute of Architects. He also served as a trustee of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art. Entenza died of cancer in La Jolla, California at the age of 78. Case Study Houses Entenza's most lasting contribution was his sponsorship of the Case Study Houses project, which featured the works of architects such as Raphael Soriano, Charles Eames, Craig Ellwood, Pierre Koenig, Richard Neutra, Eero Saarinen, Rodney Walker and William Wurster. Arts & Architecture also ran articles and interviews on artists and designers such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, George Nakashima, George Nelson, and many other ground-breakers.

Juan Mario de la Espriella Salcedo better known as Juancho de la Espriella Salcedo (born February 26, 1973 in Sincelejo, Sucre) is a Colombian musician interpreter of vallenato in accordion. De la Espriella is the current accordionist of Colombian vallenato singer Mono Zabaleta. References \\"Juancho\\", as they call him baby, born on February 26, 1973 in Sincelejo, Sucre, a son of Rosario Salcedo and Carlos De La Espriella (RIP), who inherited much of his love of vallenato music. Since very little inclination for the accordion was evident: after 3 years changed the toy cars and superheroes by an instrument of these. However, his love for the accordion began formally at age 13, when he began practicing long hours locked in his room, dreaming one day be recognized as one of the best. Time passed and Juan Mario was emerging as a faithful follower of the school of Arturo Gonzalo \\"El Cocha\\" Molina, and this was evident when he played Juancho partying and serenades: the influence of the great accordion was visible in the notes of the accordion. In the early 1990s and after waiting for a long time an opportunity to showcase their talent, Juancho Miguel Cabrera met, with whom he made his first musical called \\"little piece of my life 1994,\\" the singer made one more album \\"lo mejor que tengo\\" 1996, where Juancho failed to show the potential he had in his veins. After acquiring some musical maturity, in the late 90s, Juan Mario teamed with Peter Manjarr√©s.

That same month he joined with Martin Elias Diaz, a young man of Valledupar, heir to one of the most talented musical dynasties of all time and who has done an excellent musical partner, worthy of great prizes and recognition from the public and media. With Martin recorded \\"The boom of the moment,\\" a musical production with a lot of maturity, which is perceived a youthful and modern, mixed with the professionalism that characterizes them. However, Juancho's career does not stop here, there is a very important event that marked much of his musical maturity: the recording in 2003 of \\"Asking Road\\" with Diomedes Diaz the \\"Chief of the Board\\", father of the current musical companion, Elias Diaz Marin, this album was a success and further revealed the talent of this young artist, by then, already received the best reviews of review vallenato.

Meant as an alternative to the condom for males, it was invented by Danish MD Lasse Hessel and designed to be worn internally by the female partner during vaginal sex to prevent exposure to ejaculated semen or other body fluids. Its protection against STIs is inferior to that of male condoms. Internal condoms can be used by the receptive partner during anal sex.[http://www.aidsmap.com/Female-condoms-for-anal-sex/page/1746303/ Female condoms for anal sex] archive 20090430  Description  The female condom is a thin, soft, loose-fitting sheath with a flexible ring/frame or ring/foam disc at the closed end. They typically come in various sizes. For most vaginas, a moderately sized condom is adequate; women who have recently given birth should try a large size first. The inner ring or foam disc at the closed end of the sheath is used to insert the condom inside the vagina and to hold it in place during intercourse. The rolled outer ring or poly frame at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vagina and covers part of the external genitalia. The female condom was developed in the late 20th century (male condoms have been used for centuries). A primary motive for its creation is the well-documented refusal of some men to use a condom because of loss of sensation and the resulting impact on the hardness of the man's erection, and secondarily by its implication that the male could transmit an STI.National Health Service (United Kingdom), \\"What if my partner won't use condoms?\\", July 16, 2014, http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/contraception-guide/Pages/partner-wont- use-condoms.aspx, retrieved February 8, 2017. Versions and materials An illustration of a female condom VA wow brand female condom The FC1 female condom was first made from polyurethane. The second generation female condom is called the FC2 and is made from synthetic nitrile (this material change was announced in September 2005,(PDF) and full transition of the product line to FC2 was done by October 2009). The newer nitrile condoms are less likely to make potentially distracting crinkling noises. FC2 was developed to take the place of FC1, providing the same safety and efficacy during use, but at a lower cost. It is hoped the nitrile condoms will also allow for significant reductions in female condom pricing. FC2 is manufactured by The Female Health Company. The World Health Organization (WHO) has cleared FC2 for purchase by U.N. agencies and the UNFPA (a U.N. agency) has incorporated the female condom into national programming. They are sold under many brand names, including Reality, Femidom, Dominique, Femy, Myfemy, Protectiv and Care. A recent version of the female condom is made from natural latex, the same material used in male condoms. This condom does not make the noises some experience with plastic condoms and fits snugly against the female anatomy. This type of female condom is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd, India and IXu LLC of USA. It is sold under the brand name VA w.o.w Condom Feminine. One more clinical trial is required before it can be considered for FDA approval in the United States. The global health nonprofit Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH) has also developed a female condom tailored for use in developing countries. The Woman's Condom is manufactured by Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus in China and is in early introduction. FC2 condoms The FC2 female condom is a nitrile sheath or pouch in length. At each end there is a flexible ring. At the closed end of the sheath, the flexible ring is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place. The other end of the sheath stays outside the vulva at the entrance to the vagina. This ring acts as a guide during penetration and stops the sheath from shifting during intercourse. There is a silicone-based lubricant on the inside of the condom, but additional lubrication can be used. The condom does not contain spermicide. =VA W.o.W.= The VA w.o.w.¬Æ Condom Feminine is manufactured by HLL Lifecare Ltd and IXu LLC. This latex condom has a pouch attached to its rounded triangular opening and a sponge to secure it inside a woman's vagina. It is available through the distributor IXu LLC for the private and public sectors in several regions, including the EU, South Africa, Brazil, and India. The VA w.o.w.¬Æ received the CE mark, a certification that it meets European Union consumer health requirements. It is also under review by the WHO. =The Woman's Condom= The Woman's Condom, developed by PATH, through a user- centered design process, is a new female contraceptive designed for improved acceptability, ease of use, and good sensation. The Woman's Condom is a polyurethane pouch that is partially enclosed in a capsule to aid insertion. The capsule dissolves quickly after insertion in the vagina, which releases the pouch. The condom is then held stable in the woman by foam pads. The Woman's Condom is packaged dry and comes with a small sachet of water-based lubricant to be applied at point of use. PATH licensed manufacturing and distribution of the Woman's Condom to the Shanghai Dahua Medical Apparatus Company in 2008. Dahua has received the South Africa Bureau of Standards (SABS) certification marking (2013), Shanghai Food and Drug Administration Approval (2011), and the CE Mark approval (2010) for the Woman's Condom, which allows for marketing and distribution of the product in South Africa, China and Europe, respectively. The Woman's Condom is currently under review by the WHO/United Nations Population Fund Technical Review Committee; the Committee's approval could lead to bulk public-sector purchase by United Nations agencies. =Natural Sensation Female Condom= The Natural Sensation Panty Condom is distributed in the US exclusively by the ACME Condom Company. It is manufactured by Natural Sensation Compa√±ia Ltda. (NS) based in Bogot√°, Colombia. The product is made of a polyethylene resin, which is stronger and thinner than latex. Unlike latex, polyethylene is anti-allergenic, ultra sensitive, transparent and odorless. Natural Sensation's condoms are lubricated and may be used with either oil- or water-based lubricants. =Silk Parasol Female Condom= The Female Panty Condom is manufactured by Silk Parasol. It is made of biodegradable latex. It has not yet been approved by the FDA and is currently undergoing clinical trials. =The Phoenurse Female Condom= The Phoenurse‚Ñ¢ is made of a dumbbell-shaped polyurethane sheath and comes with an insertion tool, a water- or silicone-based lubricant, sanitary towels, and disposal bags. It is manufactured by the Tianjin Condombao Medical Polyurethane Tech. Co. Ltd. and is approved for sale in the European Economic Area. The Phoenurse female condom is also available in Brazil, Sri Lanka, China, Kenya, and Mexico. It has not been approved by the FDA. =Cupid's Female Condom= The Cupid's Female Condom is made of natural latex rubber and manufactured in India by Cupid Ltd. It is approved for distribution in Europe and was prequalified for distribution by WHO in 2012. It is currently undergoing clinical trials to gain approval by the FDA. =Origami Female Condom= The ORIGAMI Female Condom‚Ñ¢ (OFC) is fabricated in molded silicone for anatomical conformity. It was validated as 100% biocompatible and non- allergenic in independent pre-clinical lab testing. The condom is not yet approved for sale and must be reviewed by the WHO, the C-Mark (EU), and the FDA to meet regulatory safety requirements. The OFC is in clinical trials in San Francisco, CA in collaboration with the Women's Global Health Imperative at RTI, International. Large-scale clinical trials were to follow in 2014, to evaluate its performance and safety. It had been expected to reach the market in late 2015, pending regulatory pre-market approvals. As of January 2017, no results were available from initial feasibility studies.Unfortunately, because of pending lawsuits involving allegations of embezzlement, the release of the Origami may be indefinitely suspended. Unfortunately, a pending lawsuit involving allegations of embezzlement means that the Origami is, as of February 2017, suspended indefinitely from reaching the market. Costs and \\"reuse\\" of the original FC and FC2 The per unit price of female condoms is higher than male condoms but there is some evidence to suggest that polyurethane female condoms can be washed, disinfected, and reused. Re-using the polyurethane female condom is not considered as safe as using a new one; however the WHO says, \\"Batches of new, unused female condoms were subjected to seven cycles of disinfection, washing, drying and re-lubrication, reflecting the steps and procedures in the draft protocol, but at considerably higher concentrations of bleach and for longer durations. All female condom batches met the manufacturing quality assessment specifications for structural integrity after the test cycles. ‚Ä¶ Disinfection, washing, drying, re- lubrication and reuse of the device were not associated with penile discharge, symptomatic vaginal irritation or adverse colposcopic findings in study volunteers.\\" A presentation at the 1998 International AIDS conference concluded that \\"washing, drying and re-lubricating the female condom up to ten times does not significantly alter the structural integrity of the device. Further microbiological and virological tests are required before re-use of the female condom can be recommended.\\" Research suggests that the FC2 female condoms are a cost-effective method of HIV prevention even at low levels of use. The data shows that the cost-effectiveness would increase significantly at higher levels of use. A study conducted in 2005 by Dr. David Holtgrave, Chair of the Department of Health, Behavior and Society at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, examined the projected public health impact that the FC2 female condom would have at different levels of use in two developing countries: South Africa and Brazil. The study concluded that FC2 use would generate significant cost savings at all levels of implementation by preventing thousands of HIV infections and saving millions of dollars in health care costs. There is some evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of female condoms in preventing transmission of HIV may be similar to that of male condoms. Lubrication As with all barrier contraceptives, water or silicone-based lubricants are safe to use with any female condom. Oil should not be used with a female condom made of latex. FC2 Female Condom comes pre-lubricated with a non-spermicidal, silicone based lubricant. The FC2 is made of nitrile so oil-based (or water-based) lubricants can be added on the inside and outside of FC2 Female Condom or on the penis. Effectiveness When used correctly, the female condom has a 5% failure rate. Inconsistent or incorrect usage has been shown to result in a 21% failure rate. Some benefits of female condoms over other methods of birth control include: * they allow women to share in the responsibility of preventing STIs * they are safe to use for people with a latex allergy * they can be used with both water-based lubricants and (unlike latex condoms) with oil-based lubricants * they have no effect on a woman's natural hormone levels * they can be purchased without a prescription * they may enhance sex and sexual play for both partners - the condom's external ring may stimulate the clitoris and/or penis during vaginal intercourse * they are not dependent on a male partner to maintain his erection in order to stay in place Some disadvantages to the female condom include: * it may cause irritation of the genital area in people of both sexes (including irritation of the vagina, vulva, penis, or anus) * it may slip into the vagina or anus during vaginal or anal intercourse * it may reduce sensation during intercourse Advantages FC2 Female Condom gives women control and choice over their own sexual health; women can protect themselves when their partner does not want to use a male condom; female condoms may provide enhanced sensation for men as compared to male condoms; FC2 is hypo allergenic and is safe to use with people who are allergic to rubber latex; FC2 may be inserted hours before intercourse; female condoms are not dependent on the penis being erect for insertion and does not require immediate withdrawal after ejaculation; FC2 is not tight or constricting; FC2 is highly lubricated and the material warms to body temperature. The external genitals of the wearer and the base of the penis of the inserting partner may be better protected (from skin-to-skin transmitted STDs such as herpes and HPV) than when the male condom is used; however see studies below. Worldwide use Sales of female condoms have been low in developed countries, though developing countries are increasingly using them to complement already existing family planning and HIV/AIDS programming. Probable causes for poor sales are that inserting the female condom is a skill that has to be learned and that female condoms can be significantly more expensive than male condoms (upwards of 2 or 3 times the cost). Also, reported \\"rustling\\" sounds from the original version of the female condom during intercourse turn off some potential users, as does the visibility of the outer ring which remains outside the vagina. Regulatory issues have also limited interest in manufacturing female condoms. In the United States, the FDA historically categorized female condoms as Class III medical devices, a category with more stringent requirements than Class II, which includes external condoms. Following proposals to reclassify female condoms, the FDA announced in 2018 that single-use female condoms would now be known as single- use internal condoms, and moved to Class II. In November 2005, the World YWCA called on national health ministries and international donors to commit to purchasing 180 million female condoms for global distribution in 2006, stating that \\"Female condoms remain the only tool for HIV prevention that women can initiate and control,\\" but that they remain virtually inaccessible to women in the developing world due to their high cost of 72¬¢ per piece. If 180 million female condoms were ordered, the price of a single female condom was projected to decline to 22¬¢. In 2005, 12 million female condoms were distributed to women in the developing world. By comparison, between 6 and 9 billion male condoms were distributed that year. Awareness and access Recently, a number of initiatives have been undertaken by international and intergovernmental organizations to expand access to the female condom. In 2012, the United Nations Commission for Lifesaving Commodities for Women and Children (UNCoLSC) endorsed female condoms as one of its 13 Life-Saving Commodities, catalyzing inter-organizational efforts to overcome several commodity-specific barriers currently inhibiting women in the developing world from benefiting from this product. Price has been one of the key obstacles in expanding access to female condoms on an international level. Female condoms cost, on average, US$2‚Äì4, depending on local market factors. At the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London, the Female Health Company pledged to increase access to the FC2¬Æ female condom for the world's poorest countries and announced a prospective pricing arrangement based on aggregate purchases and 5 percent free goods based on the prior year's purchases, together with a multiyear agreement to provide $14 million in training and education by FHC over the next six years. The Cupid‚Ñ¢ female condoms have been sold in Kyrgyz Republic through UNFPA for their public distribution system. The Woman's Condom has been sold to the public sector in China. Globally, it is acknowledged that further price reductions are necessary to achieve universal access to female condoms. Based on market analysis it is expected that sustainable price reductions are feasible. Campaigns =Prevention Now!= The Center for Health and Gender Equity's Prevention Now! Campaign promotes the use of male and female condoms as a means of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS; reducing instances of unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, and other unsafe outcomes of unprotected sexual intercourse; promote the sexual and reproductive health and rights of all persons; and expand choices for those living with HIV/AIDS. =Put a Ring on It!= The Chicago Female Condom Campaign is a coalition of HIV/AIDS, reproductive justice, women's health, and gay men's health organizations dedicated to increasing access, affordability, availability, awareness, and utilization of female condoms.

Navarro used to be a former Commandant and leader of the 19th of April Movement (M-19), a former guerrilla movement that operated in Colombia in the 1970s and 1980s. After the demobilization through a peace agreement of the M-19, Navarro and others formed the M-19 Democratic Alliance, a political party of which Navarro became a leader of entering mainstream politics in Colombia. In 1990 he ran as a M-19 political candidate during the Colombian presidential elections finishing third and receiving 12.48% of the votes; he ran again unsuccessfully in the 1994 presidential election, and attempted to run for the 2006 presidential elections but lost the candidacy of his party during the primaries. In 1991 he was elected to the National Constituent Assembly, of which became Co-President along with √Ålvaro G√≥mez Hurtado and Horacio Serpa Uribe; it was this Assembly that drafted the Colombian Constitution of 1991 which remains the supreme law of the country. Navarro has also served in Congress, being elected to serve both in the Chamber from 1998 to 2002, and the Senate from 2002 to 2006 and again since 2014; and elected Mayor of Pasto serving from 1995 to 1998, and Governor of Nari√±o from 2008 to 2012.  Before M-19  Antonio Jos√© was born on 9 July 1948 in Pasto to Rafael Navarro Uribe and Mar√≠a Emma Wolff Pizarro. In 1972, Navarro graduated as a sanitary engineer from the University of Valle, after which he took postgraduate courses and eventually became a professor at the same university. He studied Environmental Engineering at Loughborough University, UK in 1976 on a scholarship from the Rockefeller Foundation, the British Council and the International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada. As a sanitary engineer, he was an adviser of the Social Medicine Department of the University of Valle (1972), coordinator of the Multidisciplinary Research Centre for Rural Development (CIMDER, 1972‚Äì1977), international adviser of the IDRC (1976‚Äì1978), Professor at the University of Valle (1972‚Äì1978), director of the Curriculum of Sanitary Engineering at the university, and a private consultant. Militancy in M-19 At the end of the 1970s, he became a part of the guerilla group M-19. Within the M-19, Navarro ascended to second-in-command of the organization. One of the most controversial episodes of M-19 was the take-over of the Palace of Justice by armed guerrillas. They pretended to demand a trial of President Belisario Betancur for violation of the peace accords. During the operation led by security forces to retake the Palace, a large group of guerrillas, civilians, magistrates and soldiers lost their lives‚Äî at least 53 civilian casualties were registered, including several members of Colombia's Supreme Court of Justice. The siege has been catalogued as a holocaust and massacre by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.Comision de la Corte Interamericana de Derechos Humanos: Caso 10738: Holocausto del Palacio de Justicia  Peace Negotiations  Navarro coordinated peace negotiations for this movement during President Betancur' government in 1984 and 1985. He was named head of the Commission to organize the National Dialogue, along with Vera Grabe, Alfonso Jacquin, Andr√©s Almarales and Israel Santamar√≠a. Talks were broken off, truces failed and the peace process died. In May 1985, the talks collapsed after an attack in a cafeteria in the city of Cali, when a soldier threw a grenade that exploded 10 cm away from Navarro, who was severely wounded. The facial nerve that controls the left part the jaw was destroyed and he lost his left leg below the knee. M-19 received news that Navarro was to be attacked in the hospital, so he was evacuated to Mexico where the leg was amputated. He received a prosthesis in Cuba. Later, Carlos Pizarro carried out peace negotiations with the government of President Virgilio Barco. The peace agreement was on signed 11 March 1990. After signing the peace agreement, M-19 nominated its leader, Carlos Pizarro Leong√≥mez to run as candidate for the presidency, but he was assassinated on a commercial flight from Bogot√° to Barranquilla on 26 April 1990. After Pizarro's burial, the leaders of M-19 met and decided to continue with the peace process. They nominated Navarro for the presidency, who came in third in the balloting.  Political life  In the 2000s, M-19 entered a leftist coalition of parties called the Alternative Democratic Pole and Navarro became its Secretary General. Antonio Navarro has been mayor of the city of Pasto, Congressman of Colombia and was one of the three collegiate presidents of the Constituent Assembly of Colombia writing the Colombian Constitution of 1991. He has served as Colombian Minister of Health. In 2006, he ran for the presidency of Colombia, but lost to Carlos Gaviria in the party primaries. He then ran for the Senate and was elected. After he is elected governor of Nari√±o of the PDA. Later after the election of Gustavo Petro as mayor of Bogot√°, Navarro was appointed Secretary of Government which takes turn as spokesman for the mayor. However resignation for personal reasons in late March 2012 in charge subsequently assuming the Progressive Movement spokesperson. He is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.

It is closely related to, and find its origin in, Bhagavatism. Krishnaism is a non-Vedic tradition in origin, but it further developed its appeal towards orthodox believers through the syncretism of these traditions with the Mahabharata epic.\\"Non-Vedic in origin and development, K·πõ·π£·πáaism now sought affiliation with Vedism so that it could become acceptable to the still not inconsiderable orthodox elements among the people. That is how Vi·π£·πáu of the ·πögveda came to be assimilated‚Äîmore or less superficially‚Äîinto K·πõ·π£·πáaism.\\" in In particular Krishnaism incorporated more or less superficially the Vedic supreme deity Vishnu, who appears in the Rigveda. Krishnaism further becomes associated with bhakti yoga in the Medieval period. The central text of Krishnaism is the Bhagavad Gita.James Mulhern (1959) A History of Education: A Social Interpretation p. 93Franklin Edgerton (1925) The Bhagavad Gita: Or, Song of the Blessed One, India's Favorite Bible pp. 87-91Charlotte Vaudeville has said, it is the 'real Bible of Krsnaism'. Quoted in: Matchett, 2000 History Krishnaism originates in the early centuries CE, arising from an amalgamation of the heroic VƒÅsudeva Krishna, the \\"divine child\\" Bala Krishna and the Gopala traditions, and syncretism of these non-Vedic traditions with the Mahabharata canon, thus affiliating itself with Vedism in order to become acceptable to the orthodox establishment. Krishnaism becomes associated with bhakti yoga in the medieval period. =Origins= VƒÅsudeva-Krishna on a coin of Agathocles of Bactria, circa 190-180 BCE.Osmund Bopearachchi, Emergence of Vi·π£·πáu and ≈öiva Images in India: Numismatic and Sculptural Evidence, 2016. This is \\"the earliest unambiguous image\\" of the deity. Northern India The first inscription of the Heliodorus pillar that was made by Heliodorus 110 BCE after his conversion to Bhagavata Monotheism. Early Krishnaism started with the cult of the heroic VƒÅsudeva Krishna, which, several centuries later, was amalgamated with the cult of the \\"divine child\\" Bala Krishna and the Gopala traditions. While Vishnu is attested already in the Rigveda, the development of Krishnaism appears to take place via the worship of Vasudeva in the final centuries BCE. This earliest phase was established the time of PƒÅ·πáini (4th century BCE) who, in his Astadhyayi, explained the word vasudevaka as a bhakta (devotee) of Vasudeva. At that time, VƒÅsudeva was already considered as a demi-God, as he appears in PƒÅ·πáini's writings in conjunction with Arjuna as an object of worship, since PƒÅ·πáini explains that a vƒÅsudevaka is a devotee (bhakta) of VƒÅsudeva.\\"The affix vun comes in the sense of \\"this is his object of veneration\\" after the words 'V√¢sudeva' and 'Arjuna'\\", giving V√¢sudevaka and Arjunaka. Source: A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´ 2.0 Panini 4-3-98 A sect which flourished with the decline of Vedism was centred on Krishna, the deified tribal hero and religious leader of the Yadavas. Worship of Krishna, the deified tribal hero and religious leader of the Yadavas, took sectarian form as the Pancaratra and earlier as Bhagavata religions. This sect has at a later stage merged with the sect of Narayana. The character of Gopala Krishna is often considered to be non-Vedic. By the time of its incorporation into the Mahabharata canon during the early centuries CE, Krishnaism began to affiliate itself with Vedism in order to become acceptable to orthodoxy, in particular aligning itself with Rigvedic Vishnu. At this stage that Vishnu of the Rig Veda was assimilated into Krishnaism and became the equivalent of the Supreme God. The appearance of Krishna as one of the Avatars of Vishnu dates to the period of the Sanskrit epics in the early centuries CE. The Bhagavad Gita was incorporated into the Mahabharata as a key text for Krishnaism. Southern India According to Hardy, there is evidence of early \\"southern Krishnaism,\\" despite the tendency to allocate the Krishna-traditions to the Northern traditions. South Indian texts show close parallel with the Sanskrit traditions of Krishna and his gopi companions, so ubiquitous in later North Indian text and imagery.MONIUS, Anne E.: Dance Before Doom. Krishna In The Non-Hindu Literature of Early Medieval South India. In: Beck, Guy L., ed. Alternative Krishnas. Regional and Vernacular Variations on a Hindu Deity. Albany: State University of New York Press 2005; Ch. 8. pp. 139-149. Early writings in Dravidian culture such as Manimekalai and the Cilappatikaram present Krishna, his brother, and favourite female companions in the similar terms. Hardy argues that the Sanskrit Bhagavata Purana is essentially a Sanskrit \\"translation\\" of the bhakti of the Tamil alvars.Norman Cutler (1987) Songs of Experience: The Poetics of Tamil Devotion, p. 13 Devotion to southern Indian Mal (Tirumal) may be an early form of Krishnaism, since Mal appears as a divine figure, largely like Krishna with some elements of Vishnu. The Alvars, whose name can be translated \\"sages\\" or \\"saints\\", were devotees of Mal. Their poems show a pronounced orientation to the Vaishnava, and often Krishna, side of Mal. But they do not make the distinction between Krishna and Vishnu on the basis of the concept of the Avatars. Yet, according to Hardy the term \\"Mayonism\\" should be used instead of \\"Krishnaism\\" when referring to Mal or Mayon. =Early medieval traditions= Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486‚Äì1534), believed to be an expansion of Krishna in the mood of Radha. By the Early Medieval period, Krishnaism had risen to a major current of Vaishnavism. Vaishnavism in the 8th century came into contact with the Advaita doctrine of Adi Shankara. Vasudeva has been interpreted by Adi Shankara, using the earlier Vishnu Purana as a support, as meaning the \\"supreme self\\" or Vishnu, dwelling everywhere and in all things,Ganguli translation of Mahabharata, Ch.148 although many other schools of Hindu philosophy have a different interpretation of this key concept. There were counter-movements in South India to Shankara's theory of Brahman in particular, Ramanuja in the 11th century and Madhva in the 13th, building on the devotional tradition of the Alvars (Shri Vaishnavas). The Bhakti movement of late medieval Hinduism emerges in the 9th or 10th century, and is based on the Bhagavata Purana. In North India, Krishnaism gave rise to various late Medieval movements: Nimbarka and Ramananda in the 14th century, Kabir and Sankaradeva in the 15th and Vallabha and Caitanya in the 16th. Historically, it was Caitanya Mahaprabhu who founded congregational chanting of holy names of Krishna in the early 16th century after becoming a sannyasi. =Modern traditions= The cult of Krishna later evolved in modern times to form the Hare Krishna Mouvement, founded by A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Beliefs paripurna avatara of Vishnu and as Svayam Bhagavan. =Vishnuism and Krishnaism= The term \\"Krishnaism\\" has been used to describe the sects focused on Krishna, while \\"Vishnuism\\" may be used for sects focusing on Vishnu in which Krishna is an Avatar, rather than a transcended Supreme Being.Flood,(1996) p. 117 Vishnuism believes in Vishnu as the supreme being, manifested himself as Krishna, while Krishnaism accepts Krishna to be Svayam bhagavan or \\"authentic\\", that manifested himself as Vishnu. As such Krishnaism is believed to be one of the early attempts to make philosophical Hinduism appealing to the masses. In common language the term Krishnaism is not often used, as many prefer a wider term \\"Vaishnavism\\", which appeared to relate to Vishnu, more specifically as Vishnu-ism. Krishnaismt is often also called Bhagavatism, after the Bhagavata Purana which asserts that Krishna is \\"Bhagavan Himself,\\" and subordinates to itself all other forms: Vishnu, Narayana, Purusha, Ishvara, Hari, Vasudeva, Janardana, etc.\\"It becomes clear that the personality of Bhagvan Krishna subordinates to itself the titles and identities of Vishnu, Narayana, Purusha, Ishvara, Hari, Vasudeva, Janardana etc. The pervasive theme, then, of the Bhagavata Puran is the identification of Bhagavan with Krishna.\\" =Krishna= Vaishnavism is a monotheistic religion, centered on the devotion of Vishnu and his avatars. It is sometimes described as a\\"polymorphic monotheism\\", since there are many forms of one original deity, with Vishnu taking many forms. In Krishnaism this deity is Krishna, sometimes referred as intimate deity - as compared with the numerous four-armed forms of Narayana or Vishnu.Scheweig, (2004) pp. 13-17 Krishna is also worshiped across many other traditions of Hinduism. Krishna is often described as having the appearance of a dark-skinned person and is depicted as a young cowherd boy playing a flute or as a youthful prince giving philosophical direction and guidance, as in the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna and the stories associated with him appear across a broad spectrum of different Hindu philosophical and theological traditions, where it is believed that God appears to his devoted worshippers in many different forms, depending on their particular desires. These forms include the different avataras of Krishna described in traditional Vaishnava texts, but they are not limited to these. Indeed, it is said that the different expansions of the Svayam bhagavan are uncountable and they cannot be fully described in the finite scriptures of any one religious community. Many of the Hindu scriptures sometimes differ in details reflecting the concerns of a particular tradition, while some core features of the view on Krishna are shared by all. Scriptures =Common scriptures= Jiva Gosvami's Bhajan Kutir at Radha-kunda. Jiva Goswamis Sandarbhas summarize Vedic sources of Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition's accretion of the concept Krishna to be the supreme Lord, ', based on paribhasa-sutra of Bhagavata Purana. While every tradition of Krishnaism has its own canon, in all Krishna is accepted as a teacher of the path in the scriptures Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavata Purana. As Krishna says in the Bhagavad Gita, establishing the basis of Krishnaism himself: * \\"And of all yogins, he who full of faith worships Me, with his inner self abiding in Me, him, I hold to be the most attuned (to me in Yoga).\\"Radhakrishan(1970), ninth edition, Blackie and son India Ltd., p.211, Verse 6.47 * \\"After attaining Me, the great souls do not incur rebirth in this miserable transitory world, because they have attained the highest perfection.\\" In Gaudiya Vaishnava, Vallabha Sampradaya, Nimbarka sampradaya and the old Bhagavat school, Krishna is believed to be fully represented in his original form in the Bhagavata Purana, that at the end of the list of avataras concludes with the following assertion:Bhag. Purana 1.3.28 :' :' Not all commentators on the Bhagavata Purana stress this verse, however a majority of Krishna-centered and contemporary commentaries highlight this verse as a significant statement. Jiva Goswami has called it Paribhasa-sutra, the \\"thesis statement\\" upon which the entire book or even theology is based. In Hari- namamr‚Ä†a-vyakarana, Jiva Gosvami defines paribhasa-sutra as aniyame niyama- karini paribhasa: \\"A paribhasa-sutra implies a rule or theme where it is not explicitly stated.\\" In other words, it gives the context in which to understand a series of apparently unrelated statements in a book. In another place of the Bhagavata Purana (10.83.5-43) those who are named as wives of Krishna all explain to Uraupadi how the 'Lord himself' (Svayam Bhagavan, Bhagavata Purana 10.83.7) came to marry them. As they relate these episodes, several of the wives speak of themselves as Krishna's devotees. In the tenth canto the Bhagavata Purana describes svayam bhagavans Krishna's childhood pastimes as that of a much-loved child raised by cowherds in Vrindavan, near to the Yamuna River. The young Krishna enjoys numerous pleasures, such as thieving balls of butter or playing in the forest with his cowherd friends. He also endures episodes of carefree bravery protecting the town from demons. More importantly, however, he steals the hearts of the cowherd girls (Gopis). Through his magical ways, he multiplies himself to give each the attention needed to allow her to be so much in love with Krishna that she feels at one with him and only desires to serve him. This love, represented by the grief they feel when Krishna is called away on a heroic mission and their intense longing for him, is presented as models of the way of extreme devotion (bhakti) to the Supreme Lord. =Sectarian scriptures= Varkari movement In the Varkari movement the following scriptures are considered sacred in addition to general body of the common writing: * Dyaneshawri * Tukaram-Gatha * Sopandevi * Namdev-Gatha * Eknathi-Bhagwat Chaitanya movement * Sad Sandarbhas * Brahma Samhita Practics =Holy places= Vrindavana is often considered to be a holy place by majority of traditions of Krishnaism. It's a center of Krishna worship and the area includes places like Govardhana and Gokula associated with Krishna from time immemorial. Many millions of bhaktas or devotees of Krishna visit these places of pilgrimage every year and participate in a number of festivals that relate to the scenes from Krishna's life on Earth. On the other hand, Goloka is considered the eternal abode of Krishna, Svayam bhagavan according to some Vaishnava schools, including Gaudiya Vaishnavism and the Swaminarayan Sampraday. The scriptural basis for this is taken in Brahma Samhita and Bhagavata Purana. Traditions Vishnu worship Krishna as an avatar * Brahma Sampradaya (Madhvacharya) (Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Gaudiya) * Sri Sampradaya (Sri Vaishnavism) (Ramanuja) Radha Krishna traditions (Krishna as the Supreme, not as a mere avatar) * Nimbarka Sampradaya (Nimbarka) * Rudra Sampradaya (Vishnuswami) * Pushti sect (Vallabha Acharya) * Chaitanya Mahaprabhu Krishna worship alone without Radha * Srimanta Sankardeva Mixed modes traditions * Vithoba- centric Varkari sect Krishna worship as Ishta-deva * Smartism * Swaminarayan Faith South Indian traditions * Alvars *Tirumal worship Demography Krishnaism has a limited following outside of India, especially associated with 1960s counter-culture, including a number of celebrity followers, such as George Harrison, due to its promulgation throughout the world by the founder- acharya of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. Krishnaism and Christianity Debaters have often alleged a number of parallels between Krishnaism and Christianity, originating with Kersey Graves' The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors claiming 346 parallels between Krishna and Jesus,The World's Sixteen Crucified Saviors by Kersey Graves theorizing that Christianity emerged as a result of an import of pagan concepts upon Judaism. Some 19th- to early 20th-century scholars writing on Jesus Christ in comparative mythology (John M. Robertson, Christianity and Mythology, 1910) even sought to derive both traditions from a common predecessor religion. Notes References =Bibliography= BECK, Guy L., ed. Alternative Krishnas.

History  The group was founded in 1969 by Neville Cooper (aka \\"Hopeful Christian\\"), an Australian- born preacher who was invited to New Zealand , having earlier (as a member of the Voice of Deliverance Evangelist Mission) survived a near fatal 1965 plane crash in south-east Queensland.Clayton, M. 'A wing and a prayer', Aviation Heritage, vol. 48, no. 3 (September 2017), pp.128-130. Cooper founded what became known as the Springbank Christian Community near Christchurch, moving to a larger property on the West Coast of New Zealand between 1991-1995 when the community grew too large for its existing home. This new settlement, located in the Haupiri Valley was named \\"Gloriavale\\", and established the existing Gloriavale Christian Community, roughly inland from Greymouth.  Overview  Known by some outsiders as the \\"Cooperites\\" after their leader Neville Cooper, the group rejects this name and members refer to themselves only as Christians. Members of the community live a fundamentalist Christian life in accordance with their interpretation of the teachings of the New Testament. The community attempts to uphold the example of the first Christian church in Jerusalem (Acts 2:41‚Äì47) for its principles of sharing and holding all things in common. The group teaches that the only true way to salvation is through faith in Jesus Christ and obedience to the commands of God. What We Believe, Springbank, First Edition, The Eighth Month, 1989 (The book, researched and written by the group, sets out the way its members should live, what they should believe, and how they should behave. The book is never taken to replace the authority of the Bible, but is considered only to be guided to doctrines and beliefs.) The community earns its income from several ventures including dairying, deer and sheep farms. The community also earns income from the manufacture of gardening products made from sphagnum moss, as well as formerly running scenic and charter flights from Greymouth through their company Air West Coast. The community runs Gloriavale Christian School, a private coeducational composite (years 1‚Äì13) school with a roll of 200. The school moved to the West Coast in 1990. Controversies In 1995, Neville Cooper was jailed for almost a year on sexual abuse charges. He was convicted based on the testimonies of his son and a young woman who had fled the compound. Cooper later changed his name to Hopeful Christian. Cooper died of cancer on 15 May 2018, aged 92. Those who leave the community are sometimes shunned and denied contact with family members who have not left Gloriavale; because most residents in Gloriavale are born into the community, this can often comprise a person's entire family. The Apologetics Index, a Christian cult-watching organisation, refers to Gloriavale as a \\"cult, both theologically and sociologically\\", stating that \\"theologically, this group is a cult of Christianity, as its theology - as well as its practices based on that theology - places it well outside the boundaries of the Christian faith.\\" A wide-ranging government investigation into the community began in 2015, leading to a number of charges. A police investigation is still ongoing, with no charges yet brought against Gloriavale or members of its community. In 2016, a three-part documentary on TVNZ 2 extensively covered the community, with the documentary team being given unprecedented access to the community. The series is available online within New Zealand. An additional set of 8 mini-episodes, titled Gloriavale: The Return was released in 2018. Television channels made additional films about the cult community in 2017 and 2018. In 2017, Lilia Tarawa, the granddaughter of Gloriavale's founder, spoke at a TEDx Christchurch conference on her experiences as a member of the community and during the conference, she detailed how she had grown up within it.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS7mBbXxJYA Tarawa described abusive practices as part of daily life for members of Gloriavale, including beatings, forced marriages, and psychological control, leading some of Gloriavale's members - including some of Tarawa's siblings - to run away and escape from it if they could. The video of Tarawa's talk became widely popular online following its upload to YouTube. Stories of child abuse, rape, and other forms of cruelty and subjugation also emerged from other former members. News of controversial practices in the community led to the police making daily checks on the community in 2018. On March 29th, 2020, it was reported that members of the Gloriavale community were failing to comply with lockdown procedures amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand, with reports that childcare at community-run daycare centres, lessons at community-run schools, and meetings were all continuing despite social distancing measures. Police forces within the area later confirmed that they were working with Gloriavale in order to ensure that members of its community abided by lockdown restrictions. In late September 2020, WorkSafe New Zealand dispatched inspectors to Gloriavale to investigate claims that some members had been forced to work for more than 20 hours a day. The news company Newshub also reported that current Gloriavale members had been targeted by the sect's leadership for speaking to the media. As a result of the Newshub investigation, Justice Minister Andrew Little had ordered the Police, WorkSafe and the Labour Inspectorate to launch a second investigation into allegations of \\"controlling behaviour\\" and labour exploitation at Gloriavale. On 1 October Little, in his capacity as Minister of Workplace Relations, ordered a major review into practices at Gloriavale after Newshub obtained a government report from July 2017 reporting \\"oppressive psychological practices\\", possible exploitation, bullying, manipulation and coercion within the community. On 2 October, WorkSafe instructed Gloriavale's leadership to improve their work practices but found no evidence to suggest that the religious community was not managing the risk of workplace fatigue. WorkSafe had conducted a workplace assessment on Monday where a team of four inspectors assessed Gloriavale, four subsidiary companies, and 13 workers.

The airport is frequently used for technical training. History In 1921 there was activity on the need for an aerodrome at Mudgee, with a proposal for privately owned air strip to be prepared near the town. From as early as 1933 there was agitation for a licensed public aerodrome for Mudgee. The Mudgee Racecourse was used as a landing ground when the first passenger air service from Mudgee to Sydney commenced 3 August 1937 by Southern Airlines and Freighters Limited. Mudgee was the first stop on a service that proceeded to Dubbo, Narromine, Nyngan, Cobar, Wilcannia, then turned around at Broken Hill for the return trip. The aircraft was a two engined De Havilland Dragonfly. Mudgee Racecourse was used as a landing Aerodrome for many years then in 1949 the Department of Civil Aviation cancelled the licence for the aerodrome as it was unsuitable to be a combined racecourse and an aerodrome. In 1954 the State Government rezoned the Racecourse land and redesignated it as an aerodrome site. In 1955 the aerodrome was re-licensed and reopened.

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates and Baltimore Orioles. √Ålvarez stands and weighs . A third baseman until late 2014, Alvarez transitioned to first base for the Pirates in 2015, and in 2016 became a designated hitter for the Orioles. On June 19, 2018, he was designated for assignment by the Orioles. Early life √Ålvarez was born in the Dominican Republic to Pedro and Luz Alvarez. Alvarez also has a sister. As a young boy, he grew up in the Washington Heights neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan. High school career √Ålvarez first attended the Mott Hall School for gifted and talented students in Morningside Heights, where he was an A student. He then attended Horace Mann School in the Bronx, where he holds numerous baseball records, most notably home runs, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and RBIs. √Ålvarez was named Athlete of the Year his senior season. Though he attended a private school, √Ålvarez's abilities attracted the attention of scouts throughout the New York City area, especially after he led his club team, the Bayside Yankees, to a national title in 2005. In recognition of his success, Louisville Slugger crowned him the Player of the Year in New York and also named him to its All- America team. Vanderbilt career After graduating from high school, √Ålvarez was drafted in the 14th round of the 2005 major league draft by the Boston Red Sox. Though offered a substantial signing bonus, √Ålvarez instead chose to play college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores of the Southeastern Conference. √Ålvarez started slowly and had some trouble adjusting to the college game. However, after growing comfortable, he became an integral member of the Commodore lineup. √Ålvarez put up some of the best offensive numbers in the history of Vanderbilt, setting single-season school records in home runs (22) and second in RBIs to Warner Jones. These stats earned √Ålvarez National Freshman of the Year honors from several publications, including Baseball America. √Ålvarez was then selected to the USA National team, leading the team in batting average. Baseball America ranked him as the second best pro prospect on the squad. In addition, Sports Illustrated ranked him as the best pro prospect on the team and said that he was the \\"early favorite to be drafted first in 2008\\", due to his impressive performance over the summer and as a freshman. Before the 2007 season began √Ålvarez was named to the watchlist for the SEC and national player of the year awards. He was also chosen as a first team pre-season All-American. During the season, √Ålvarez hit .397 with 17 home runs, 65 RBI, 72 runs, an on-base percentage of .467, and a slugging percentage of .706 for the 51-11 Commodores. Vanderbilt captured its first- ever SEC regular-season championship. √Ålvarez was named Tournament MVP. √Ålvarez was invited back to Team USA after his strong performance in 2006. He led the team in homers, RBI, batting average, hits, and slugging percentage. Professional career =Pittsburgh Pirates= √Ålvarez was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first round (second overall) in the 2008 MLB draft. He agreed to a $6 million minor league contract with the Pirates on August 15, minutes before the deadline, but did not immediately sign it. He was placed on the restricted list after the Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance against Major League Baseball over draft picks being signed minutes after the August 15 deadline. On September 22, √Ålvarez agreed to renegotiated terms on a four-year major league contract at $6.4 million. Minor Leagues In 2009, he attended Spring training with the Pirates, but was assigned to the minor league's spring training on March 16, 2009.Alvarez Sent Down SI.com, March 16, 2009 After playing several months with the Pirates High-A affiliate, Lynchburg Hillcats, √Ålvarez was assigned to Double-A Altoona Curve in late June. √Ålvarez led the Pirates organization in home runs and RBI with 27 and 95 respectively. He also batted .288 with an .917 OPS. 2010 √Ålvarez at third base √Ålvarez started the 2010 season with the Pirates Triple-A affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, as the 8th-best prospect in Baseball America's 2010 rankings. In 66 games with the Indians, he hit .277 with 13 home runs, 53 RBI, and 4 stolen bases. √Ålvarez was called up to the MLB on June 16, 2010, and made his MLB debut against John Danks of the Chicago White Sox. He went 0-for-2 with a walk, a strikeout, and a run scored. His first MLB hit came against the Cleveland Indians on June 19, an RBI double off Indians starter David Huff. The following several weeks of his career did not go so smoothly, however. He struck out at least once in each of his first 10 games, capped off by a 4-strikeout game in a 14-4 loss to the Oakland Athletics on June 25. Pirates manager John Russell then gave him a day off. His first MLB home run came against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 3, 2010, a solo shot to left field off of Phillies starter Kyle Kendrick. Following his benching, √Ålvarez responded with an eight-game hitting streak from June 28 ‚Äì July 6 that included 2 home runs, 3 runs scored and 4 RBI. √Ålvarez recorded his first MLB career multi-homer game on July 20, 2010 against the Milwaukee Brewers. He hit a grand slam in the first inning off Brewers starter Dave Bush and then followed with a solo home run in the following inning. He finished the game 2-for-4 with two runs and five RBIs.

In common usage, the term generally applies to the method of amending either the state constitution or statutes through popular initiative, although it may also refer to any legislation referred to the public by the state legislature. Most ballot propositions in the latter context are the end result of the normal legislative process regarding amendments to the state constitution. Occasionally the legislature may choose to refer bills of a statutory nature to the voting public, as well. Origins The first instance of a modern US initiative and referral system appeared in Oregon in 1902. This in itself was a product of the governmental reforms that were a signature of the Progressive Era, which sought to reduce corruption and inefficiency. A strong sentiment that current political systems were cumbersome and slow lead to the popularization of the idea of direct democracy. Citizen initiative became highly popular in newly forming governments and thus is widespread in the Western United States. Itself a product of the Progressive Era reforms, the constitution adopted by Arizona upon admission to the Union in 1912 reflects the sentiment that direct democracy was sacred. The first section of the constitution dealing with the powers of the Legislature is quick to reserve the rights of initiative and referendum for the people. These rights are also granted specific protections, being exempt from veto by the governor as well as not being subject to repeal by the legislature. Citizen initiatives may only be overturned by subsequent initiatives. Process =Initiative= Initiative is the process wherein either the state statutes or the state constitution is amended through citizen action. This process begins when qualified voters (electors) submit a petition outlining the proposed amendment to the Secretary of State. This petition must then be signed by 10% of the registered voters who actually voted in the most recent gubernatorial election for statutory amendments; this percentage increases to 15% for constitutional amendments. If enough signatures are obtained the initiative will appear on the subsequent general election ballot for voter approval. A 50% majority is required for a ballot proposal to pass and become law. =Referendum= Referendum is the process wherein current legislation is referred to the voting public for approval. The legislature may choose to refer any legislation; however, any bills proposing an amendment to the state constitution must be subject to referendum. As with an initiative, only a 50% vote is required to enact the legislation. A referendum on any pending legislation may also be forced by the public in a similar manner to any initiative, requiring a petition signed by no less than 5% of the registered voters. To ensure enough time for any potential referendum, no legislation that is passed may take effect for at least 90 days. The constitution makes provisions for the passage of emergency legislation that is not subject to referendum. Such legislation must pertain to the peace, safety or health of the population, or to ensure the continued function of the state government in emergency situations. Such legislation must pass with a 2/3 majority in both houses as opposed to a simple majority. Criticisms As with the citizen initiative process in general, the ballot initiative process in Arizona has been subject to a number of criticisms. Concern that the initiative process is subject to overuse and abuse has increased significantly. In 2006 there were a record 19 initiatives on the general ballot, creating concern that voters could become confused or simply fatigued by the numerous choices. This has led to legislators considering steps to limit or otherwise exert more control over the initiative process. Paradoxically, any attempt to alter the initiative and referendum process would require an amendment to the state constitution, and thus in itself be put forth as a referendum. The extensive use of the initiative process in Arizona is nothing new, however. In the 1914 elections, a total of 15 initiatives were presented to Arizona voters.

It is gain, integrated along a ray, which makes a round-trip in the cavity. At the continuous-wave operation, the round-trip gain exactly compensates both the output coupling of the cavity and its background loss. Round-trip gain in geometric optics Generally, the Round-trip gain may depend on the frequency, on the position and tilt of the ray, and even on the polarization of light. Usually, we may assume that at some moment of time, at reasonable frequency of operation, the gain ~G(x,y,z)~ is function of the Cartesian coordinates ~x~, ~y~, and ~z~. Then, assuming that the geometrical optics is applicable the round-trip gain ~g~ can be expressed as follows: :~g=\\\\int G(x(a),y(a),z(a))~{\\\\rm d}a~, where ~a~ is path along the ray, parametrized with functions ~x(a)~, ~y(a)~, ~z(a)~; the integration is performed along the whole ray, which is supposed to form the closed loop. In simple models, the flat-top distribution of pump and gain ~G~ is assumed to be constant. In the case of simplest cavity, the round-trip gain ~g=2Gh~, where ~h~ is length of the cavity; the laser light is supposed to go forward and back, this leads to the coefficient 2 in the estimate. In the steady-state continuous wave operation of a laser, the round-trip gain is determined by the reflectivity of the mirrors (in the case of stable cavity) and the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable resonator (unstable cavity). Coupling parameter The coupling parameter ~\\\\theta~ of a laser resonator determines, what part of the energy of the laser field in the cavity goes out at each round-trip. This output can be determined by the transmitivity of the output coupler, or the magnification coefficient in the case of unstable cavity. Round-trip loss (background loss) The background loss, of the round-trip loss ~\\\\beta~ determines, what part of the energy of the laser field becomes unusable at each round-trip; it can be absorbed or scattered. At the self-pulsation, the gain lates to respond the variation of number of photons in the cavity. Within the simple model, the round-trip loss and the output coupling determine the damping parameters of the equivalent oscillator Toda. At the steady-state operation, the round-trip gain ~g~ exactly compensate both, the output coupling and losses: :~\\\\exp(g)~(1-\\\\beta-\\\\theta)=1~. Assuming, that the gain is small (~g~\\\\ll 1~), this relation can be written as follows: :~g=\\\\beta+\\\\theta~ Such as relation is used in analytic estimates of the performance of lasers. In particular, the round-trip loss ~\\\\beta~ may be one of important parameters which limit the output power of a disk laser; at the power scaling, the gain ~G~ should be decreased (in order to avoid the exponential growth of the amplified spontaneous emission), and the round-trip gain ~g~ should remain larger than the background loss ~\\\\beta~; this requires to increase of the thickness of the slab of the gain medium; at certain thickness, the overheating prevents the efficient operation.; For the analysis of processes in active medium, the sum ~\\\\beta+\\\\theta~ can be also called \\"loss\\". This notation leads to confusions as soon as one is interested, which part of the energy is absorbed and scattered, and which part of such a \\"loss\\" is actually wanted and useful output of the laser.

After operating a steamboat business on the Mississippi River, he moved to Texas in 1834 and obtained a land grant on the south bank of the Angelina River in what later became Jasper County. A merchant and land speculator, Huling sold and transported provisions to Capt. James Chesser's locally raised unit during the Texas Revolution. He served as judge and postmaster after the war and owned the land on which Zavala was founded. Along with Henry Millard and Joseph Pulsifer, Thomas B. Huling helped lay out the original plans for Beaumont, Texas. Huling's first wife, known only as Sarah, apparently never came to Texas; she died in 1838, leaving him with one child. He was remarried in May 1839 to Elizabeth Bullock; this couple had eleven children. Huling represented Jasper County in the Fifth Congress of the republic, 1840‚Äì41. Seeking to stimulate the growth of the county, and especially his project at Zavala, he attempted unsuccessfully to persuade some sixty English families to colonize the area in 1847. Nonetheless, many of Huling's economic ventures paid high dividends; by 1850 he owned seventeen slaves and estimated the worth of his real property at $100,000. In 1855 he moved to the Sulphur Fork of the Lampasas River. He died on November 2, 1865 and was buried in the Old Huling-Anderson Cemetery in the Lampasas cemetery. Huling also owned the land upon which the former town of Zavala, Texas, was founded.

He served as MP in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as member of the Irish Parliamentary Party represented Mid Tipperary from 1890 to 1892. He later served as a Royal Irish Regiment officer with the New British Army in World War I, was an extensive writer, and proponent of improved relations between the United Kingdom and Ireland. Biography A Protestant nationalist, Harrison was the son of Henry Harrison of Holywood and Ardkeen, Co. Down and of Letitia Tennent. She was the daughter of Robert James Tennent, who had been Liberal MP for Belfast from 1847 to 1852. Later, when widowed, she married the author Hartley Withers. Harrison went to Westminster School and then to Balliol College, Oxford. While there he developed an admiration for Charles Stewart Parnell and became secretary of the Oxford University Home Rule Group. At this time, the Land War was in progress and in 1889 Harrison went to Ireland to visit the scene of the evictions in Gweedore, Co. Donegal. He became involved in physical confrontations with the Royal Irish Constabulary and as a result became a Nationalist celebrity overnight. The following May, Parnell offered the vacant parliamentary seat of Mid-Tipperary to Harrison, who left Oxford, still aged only 22, to take it up, unopposed. Only six months later, following the divorce case involving Katharine O'Shea, the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Parnell's leadership. Harrison strongly supported Parnell, acted as his bodyguard and aide-de-camp, and after Parnell's death devoted himself to the service of his widow Katharine. From her he heard a completely different version of the events surrounding the divorce case from that which had appeared in the press, and this was to form the seed of his later books. At the general election of 1892, Harrison did not defend Mid-Tipperary. He stood at West Limerick as a Parnellite instead, but came nowhere near winning the seat. In 1895 general election, he stood at North Sligo, polling better but again far short of winning.The Times, Obituary, 22 February 1954, states that Harrison did not seek to stand for Parliament again after the end of his initial term in 1892. This is a mistake as The Times itself reported his candidacies in 1892 and 1895. In 1895 Harrison married Maie Byrne, an American, with whom he had a son. He came to prominence briefly again in 1903 when, in spite of his lack of legal training, he successfully conducted his own case in a court action all the way to the House of Lords. Otherwise, however, he disappeared from public view until his war service with the Royal Irish Regiment when he served on the Western Front with distinction in the New British Army formed for the First World War, reaching the rank of Captain and being awarded the MC. He organised patrols in \\"No Man's Land\\" so successfully that he was appointed special patrol officer to the 16th (Irish) Division. He was invalided out and became a recruiting officer in Ireland. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours. He then made a return to Irish politics, working with Sir Horace Plunkett as Secretary of the Irish Dominion League, an organisation campaigning for dominion status for Ireland within the British Empire. Harrison was a lifelong opponent of Irish partition. He was Irish correspondent of The Economist from 1922 to 1927 and owner-editor of Irish Truth from 1924 to 1927. Harrison's two books defending Parnell were published in 1931 and 1938. They have had a major impact on Irish historiography, leading to a more favourable view of Parnell's role in the O‚ÄôShea affair. F. S. L. Lyons(1977, p.324) commented that he \\"did more than anyone else to uncover what seems to have been the true facts\\" about the Parnell-O'Shea liaison. The second book, Parnell, Joseph Chamberlain and Mr Garvin, was written in response to J. L. Garvin's biography of Joseph Chamberlain, which had ignored Harrison's first book, Parnell Vindicated: The Lifting of the Veil. Later, Harrison successfully repulsed an attempt in the official history of The Times to rehabilitate that newspaper's role in using forged letters to attack Parnell in the later 1880s. In 1952 he forced The Times to publish a four-page correction written by him as an appendix to the fourth volume of the history. During the difficult years of the Anglo-Irish Trade War over the land purchase annuities, declaration of the Republic, Irish neutrality during World War II, and departure from the Commonwealth, Harrison worked to promote good relations between Britain and Ireland. He published various books and pamphlets on the issues in dispute and wrote numerous letters to The Times. He also founded, with General Sir Hubert Gough, the Commonwealth Irish Association in 1942. By the time of his death, he was the last survivor of the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Parnell, and as a member of the pre-1918 Irish Parliamentary Party, he seems to have been outlived only by John Patrick Hayden, who died a few months after him in 1954 and by Patrick Whitty and John Lymbrick Esmonde who were only MPs for a very short time during the First World War. He is buried in Holywood, Co Down.

It was Frith's first solo guitar recording since Live in Japan (1982) and his first solo guitar studio recording since his landmark 1974 album Guitar Solos. Clearing comprises eleven tracks of unaccompanied and improvised music played on prepared guitars by Frith. Ten of the tracks were recorded in Stuttgart, Germany in 1996 and 2000, and one was recorded live at the Konstrukcja w Procesie Festival VII in Bydgoszcz, Poland in 2000. Background In 2000, John Zorn commissioned Frith to make a guitar solo album for Tzadik Records as a follow-up to his 1974 album, Guitar Solos. Using prepared guitars, Frith recorded Clearing in Stuttgart, Germany in July 2000 in a similar vein as Guitar Solos, revisiting areas explored on that album but not developed further at the time. He also included two additional tracks, \\"Gaifu Kaisei\\" and \\"This Earth is a Flower\\" that had been recorded earlier. Frith used a variety of found objects when recording the album. On \\"Chains\\", Frith placed a lozenger tin on the guitar strings and dropped a chain into the tin. An acoustic sound was achieved on \\"Blue\\" by placing microphones close to the electric guitar strings. Chopsticks were jammed between the guitar strings on \\"Gaifu Kaisei\\". \\"Minimalism\\" was performed entirely by striking the guitar strings with drumsticks.

Competitors in a typical match aim to subdue each other into total submission mostly within three rounds. It often results in serious bodily injuries for the challengers such as broken jaws and ribs. The tradition is dominated by Hausa butcher caste groups, and over the last century evolved from clans of butchers traveling to farm villages at harvest time, integrating a fighting challenge by the outsiders into local harvest festival entertainment. It was also traditionally practiced as a way for men to get ready for war, and many of the techniques and terminology allude to warfare. Today, companies of boxers travel performing outdoor matches accompanied by ceremony and drumming, throughout the traditional Hausa homelands of northern Nigeria, southern Niger and southwestern Chad.In pictures: Traditional boxing in Nigeria. Text by Andrew Walker, pictures by Afolabi Sotunde. BBC World Service, March 2008. The name \\"Dambe\\" derives from the Hausa word for \\"boxe\\", and appears in languages like Bole as Dembe. Boxers are called by the Hausa word \\"da√¶ma√¶nga\\".Bole/English wordlist:ucla.edu UCLA Hausa teaching resources: hausarbaka. Techniques Although there are no formal weight classes, usually competitors in Dambe matches are fairly matched in size. Matches last three rounds. There is no time limit to these rounds. Instead they end when: 1) there is no activity, 2) one of the participants or an official calls a halt, or 3) a participant's hand, knee, or body touches the ground. Knocking the opponent down is called killing the opponent. The primary weapon is the strong-side fist. The strong-side fist, known as the spear, is wrapped in a piece of cloth covered by tightly knotted cord. Some boxers would dip their spear in sticky resin mixed with bits of broken glass.Boxing in Nigeria: A rumble in the Sahel, by The Economist, dated Nov 18th 2010. This, however, became an illegal practice. The lead hand, called the shield, is held with the open palm facing toward the opponent. The lead hand can be used to grab or hold as required. The lead leg is often wrapped in a chain, and the chain-wrapped leg is then used for both offense and defense. The unwrapped back leg can also be used to kick. Because wrestling used to be allowed, and the goal of the game is to cause the opponent to fall down which is referred to as killed and the winner is the person that knocks down the opponent, kicks are more common than they used to be. Tournaments Traditionally, contests took place between men of butchers‚Äô guilds who would also challenge men from their village audiences. Drawn from a specific lower caste of Hausa society who were the only ones who could ritually slaughter animals and handle meat, traveling butchers formed boxing teams from their ranks called \\"armies\\". Their bouts took place at festivals marking the end of the harvest season, as clans of butchers would travel to slaughter animals for farm communities. Harvest also marked a time when rural communities were flush with money, so gambling on feats of strength became closely associated with these celebrations. Today, participants are as often urban youths who train in gyms or backyards, competing year-round. While no longer the preserve of the Hausa butcher caste, the fraternity aspect remains, as youths who join the professional ranks join a professional community which travels to perform bouts in carnival like appearances, complete with amplified sound systems and elaborate pre-match ritual. Side betting for spectators and prize purses for competitors remain an important part of the event.Traditional Boxing Offers Opportunities for Poor Young Men in Northern Nigeria . Sarah Simpson/Voice of America, 19 June 2008.Nigeria sports its own style of boxing. AP, Thursday, May 22, 2008. During village bouts, contests take place in a cleared area called the battlefield, with spectators forming the boundaries of the ring. In modern urban bouts, local competitions take place in temporary rings, often setup outside meatpacking plants as members of traditional butcher castes still predominate. In these urban matches, participants wear shorts rather than loincloths. Sand filled West African Lutte Traditionnelle arenas, common in large towns, are used for larger bouts, and are often combined with traditional wrestling championships. Whether traditional or modern, percussive music and chants precede the bouts. The music and chants are associated with both groups and individuals, and serve to call boxers to the ring, taunt opponents, and encourage audience participation. In traditional bouts, amulets are often used as forms of supernatural protection. Amulets are seen in modern urban bouts, too, but officials generally discourage the use of magical protection on the grounds of fairness. It is still common that amulets are placed in the feather filled pillows which fighters place in their wrapped fists, and fighters often scar their striking arm, rubbing salves and resins into the healing wounds which are meant to provide strength or defence. Some modern traveling boxing companies engage in ritual smoking of Hemp or Marijuana before bouts.VOA: 19 June 2008. BBC: March 2008.Green, Thomas A.

Named for empresario Lorenzo de Zavala, the town was founded on land owned by Thomas Huling and situated along the Angelina River. The approximately 40 families who lived in the town survived by farming or logging. The town last appeared on a list of communities in the county in 1878 and has since been abandoned. It is not to be confused with the city of Zavalla, which lies only 20 miles to the northwest, in Angelina County. History In 1829 the Mexican government granted empresario Lorenzo de Zavala land in eastern Texas. The land grant covered an area that is now Jasper County. Thomas Huling purchased some of this land, and in 1834 founded the town of Zavala, named for the empresario, and also known as Muster Point. The town was incorporated on December 24, 1838 by the Republic of Texas, and a post office was erected in 1839. In the 1840s, a fire destroyed much of the town, including the courthouse, many homes, and most of the town records. In 1847, Huling sold much of the town, as well as of land in Jasper County, to Englishman Jerich Durkee in exchange for $1000 and 5000 \\"tin boxes of Green Mountain Vegetable Ointment.\\" Although the post office was discontinued in 1856, the town remained on a list of Jasper County communities as late as 1878. It has since been abandoned. All that remains of the town is a cemetery which includes a granite marker commemorating the town's previous existence. Geography The town was located in Jasper County, Texas, approximately northwest of Jasper and north of Beaumont, and west of the Sabine River, which marks the border between Texas and Louisiana.Truett (1996), p. 76. Positioned \\"on a rise near the east bank of the Angelina river\\", Zavala lay along the Beef Trail, which ran from Texas into Louisiana. The landscape was very wooded, featuring loblolly pines, shortleaf pines, and oak trees.Truett (1996), p. 189. Demographics At its peak, approximately 30‚Äì40 families lived in Zavala. Although Durkee promised to settle immigrants in the area, he was unable to attract enough families to enable the community to survive. Economy Many of the town's residents were farmers. Others worked in logging. Trees would be cut and floated down the Angelina River to the Neches River, with Beaumont as their final destination.Truett (1996), p. 80. At one point in the town's history, a railroad line either went through or came very near the town.Truett (1996), p. 83.

It is located in the historic South End neighborhood, adjacent to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross, the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. Cathedral High School serves a diverse and primarily urban student population, most of whom live in the city of Boston. The school offers substantial financial aid and underwriting, funded through benefactors and an endowment. The school boasts a 100% graduation rate with 100% of graduates also earning college admittance for 16 straight years. History Cathedral High School was founded as an archdiocesan high school in 1926 by Cardinal William Henry O'Connell, then-Archbishop of Boston, primarily to educate the sons and daughters of Boston's large immigrant and first-generation American population. Cardinal O'Connell tasked the Sisters of St. Joseph with teaching at the new school. The Archdiocese of Boston centralized its high schools, including Cathedral, in 1950 under the auspices of Archdiocesan Central High Schools, Inc. Cathedral became an independent Catholic institution in 2004 and is now staffed by mostly lay leadership and faculty and led by an independent board of trustees. In 2014, the school announced a \\"Catholic Urban Partnership\\" with Our Lady of Perpetual Help Mission Grammar School in Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. In 2015, Cathedral High will take in Mission's 7th and 8th grades while Mission will focus on K-6 education. Curriculum between the two institutions will be aligned and Mission graduates receive guaranteed admission to Cathedral for grade 7. Academics As of the 2014-2015 school year, Cathedral had 280 enrolled students and employed 23 full-time teaching faculty to achieve a student/faculty ratio of 12:1. =Curriculum= Students participate in a college preparatory curriculum which includes, in addition to standard core subjects, college readiness and academic literacy classes. As a Catholic educational institution, students also take academic courses in religion/theology every year. Electives include art, Spanish language, and physical education. Cathedral High School offers Advanced Placement (AP) courses including in English, calculus, and U.S. history. Seniors are also required to complete 100 hours of volunteer community service and formally reflect on their experience as a graduation requirement. =August Institute= In 2014, the school inaugurated a summer program called the August Institute for Learning. Students entering grades 7 through 9 are required to attend the three-week program focused on project- based applied mathematics, problem solving, and summer reading. The summer program is in addition to required summer reading assigned to students in all grades. =Internships= Through strategic partnerships with Boston area businesses, Cathedral students can apply to a number of paid summer and school-year internships in a variety of industries. Annual partners in hiring Cathedral interns include Fidelity Investments and WilmerHale law firm. Tuition & Financial Aid Tuition revenue accounts for less than 14% of Cathedral‚Äôs annual operating expenses. To offer a reasonably affordable Catholic college preparatory education most of the school's costs are covered by philanthropy. Tuition for 2020-2021 is $7,000 per student. Full tuition, merit-based scholarships are awarded to a number of students and some students also receive need-based financial aid. Athletics Cathedral High School teams are known as the \\"Panthers\\". They compete as a member of the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association (MIAA) Division IV and in the Catholic Central League. Boys' sports include football, basketball, and baseball. Girls' sports include volleyball, basketball, softball, and cheerleading. Coed teams include soccer, indoor track, and outdoor track. The boys' basketball squad has established a strong reputation as one of the premier small school basketball teams in the state. The Panthers have appeared in five Division IV State Championship games (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2012). The team won their division's state championship in 2006, 2007, and 2009. They were also South Sectional Finalists in 2011, and were Division 4 State Semi- Finalists in 2014. =Football= Cathedral's football team has also developed a strong reputation in Boston recently. Under the leadership of then Head Coach Duane Sigsbury, the Panthers appeared in back-to-back Division 4A State Championship games in 2011 and 2012, winning the State Championship in 2012 with an overtime win against Madison Park. Kadeem Edge, a wide receiver on the 2012 championship team, was selected as a Boston Herald All-Scholastic and was also named a Catholic Central Small All-Star. Also, Panthers defensive lineman Mohammed Braimah was named the Catholic Central MVP, and was also selected as a member of the Boston Globe All-State Team and was named a Boston Globe All- Scholastic. Further honors for the 2012 Cathedral football team also included Sean Elad as the Catholic Central Small Defensive MVP, and Derek Welcome as the Catholic Central Small Defensive Lineman of the Year. Also with the rise of the Class of 2015 who went 41-9 in their tenure at Cathedral included Kejonte Hickman, Jermal Jackson, Justice Turner, Elijah Marcelo, Trehme Haney, Bryan Cedeno and Khalik Clerville. =2011 State Championship \\"Celebration\\" Controversy= In 2011, the football team nearly won the MIAA Division 4A State Championship, but lost due to a controversial official's call which overturned a potential game-winning touchdown in the final minutes. Midway through the 4th quarter, Cathedral trailed Blue Hills by a score of 16-14 in the Division 4A State Championship game. With approximately six minutes remaining in the game, Cathedral quarterback Matt Owens raced around the right side of the line and split the defense for a potential 56-yard game-winning touchdown run. At around the 20-yard line, Owens raise one of his arms in celebration before crossing the goal line.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltRpC3g1Uns The referees threw a flag on the play and called an unsportsmanlike penalty on Owens, which negated the touchdown and moved the Panthers back fifteen yards from the original line of scrimmage. On the next play, Cathedral turned the ball over to Blue Hills, and they eventually ran the clock out to secure a 16-14 win over Cathedral. In the aftermath, Boston mayor Thomas Menino was critical of the call and invited the entire Cathedral football team to lunch. Furthermore, Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith debated the controversial call on ESPN TV series, First Take on December 6, 2011.http://noontimesports.com/2011/12/07/espns-first-take- debates-boston-cathedral-controversy/ The story made national headlines and was covered by sources across the nation. The following season in 2012, the Panthers returned to the Division 4A State Championship game, where they defeated Madison Park by a score of 22-20 in overtime. The school honors alumni-athletes and supporters biennially in a hall of fame induction, among which is notable class of 1984 alumna and WNBA player Michelle \\"Ice\\" Edwards. Tufts Medical Center partners with Cathedral to provide athletic training services and team physicians to serve at home games. Tufts also conducts free annual sports physicals and weekly clinics to assess and serve student athletes. Extracurricular Activities Cathedral students are required in grades 7 through 9 to participate in some form of extracurricular activity (referred to as \\"Extended Learning Opportunities\\").

Origins Morley was the only son of John Parker, 1st Baron Boringdon, of Boringdon Hall, Plympton, of Court House, North Molton, and of Saltram, all in Devon, and his second wife Theresa Robinson, daughter of Thomas Robinson, 1st Baron Grantham. His mother died when he was three years old and his father when he was fifteen. His parents had employed the architect Robert Adam to complete the interior of Saltram House, rebuilt by his own father John ParkerPevsner, p.710 as one of the grandest houses in Devon. The Parker family had risen to prominence in the mid-16th century as the bailiff of the manor of North Molton, Devon, under Baron Zouche of Haryngworth.The early genealogy of the Parker family as given in the heraldic visitations of Devon appears unreliable.

Career Morley took his seat in the House of Lords on his 21st birthday in 1793. He was an active member of the House of Lords, initially supporting government policies until the death of William Pitt the Younger in 1806. After Pitt's death he supported George Canning, with whom he corresponded on political matters for many years. In 1815 he was created Viscount Boringdon, of North Molton in the County of Devon, and Earl of Morley, in the County of Devon. After Canning's death in 1827 he began to support the Whigs, and voted for the Great Reform Act of 1832. Apart from his involvement in national politics, Morley was also a great benefactor to public works in his home county of Devon and was a Fellow of the Royal Society.

Early career Although much of his early life is unknown, Francis Spriggs was first recorded serving as a quartermaster for Captain Edward Low (possibly as part of the original crew members who left the service of Captain George Lowther). However, after being given command of the recently captured the 12-gun British man of war Squirel (renamed Delight shortly thereafter), he and Low apparently had a falling out over the disciplining of one of the crew around Christmas 1724, resulting in Spriggs and Lowther deserting Low in the night. Fisherman Philip Ashton had been forced into service by Low and his new quartermaster John Russell in June 1723 but escaped the following year when Low's flotilla stopped near Roatan. In 1724 he and a few other castaways spotted an incoming vessel and hoped for rescue. When they realized the sailors were Spriggs' pirates (and afraid Spriggs might recognize him), Ashton hid, preferring to take his chances on Roatan rather than return to piracy. Spriggs & Delight A later 19th- century illustration of a captive Portuguese sailor forced to run through \\"the sweats\\" by Spriggs and his crew Flag of Francis Spriggs, Charles Harris, Edward Low and others. After leaving Low, Spriggs and the crew began flying a black flag similar to Captain Low's and set sail for the West Indies. By January 28, 1725, he had looted a Rhode Island slaver captained by Richard Duffie.Elizabeth Donnan (1932), Documents Illustrative of the History of the Slave Trade to America, vol. III, p. 118. Capturing a Portuguese bark en route, they looted the ship's stores while the crew were put through \\"the sweats\\" or a \\"sweat\\", a mild form of torture in which a ring of candles is lit in a circle around the mainmast and each crewman was made to enter the circle and run around the mast while the pirates poked and jabbed at them with pen knives, forks and other weapons in a sort of gauntlet. After they had finished with the bark, the crew were put back on their ship, to which the pirates set fire. Upon their arrival in the West Indies, Spriggs and his crew captured a sloop near St. Lucia, a Martinique merchantman, and a vessel with a cargo of logwood which they tossed into the sea after carrying away as much as they could take. In early 1724, while in New England waters, Spriggs and Delight received word of the death of King George I and discussed the possibility of gaining a royal pardon within the year after sailing from Rhode Island on March 27, 1724. In the Bay of Honduras By early-April, Spriggs anchored off Roatan near the Bay of Honduras, where he ordered many of the prisoners captured during the voyages to be put ashore. Many of these prisoners displayed wounds inflicted by the pirates during their captivity and were subject to forms of torture such as being forced to eat plates of candle wax. Refitting their ship on a nearby island west of Roatan, Spriggs and Delight sailed for Saint Kitts with the intentions of encountering a Captain Moor of Eagle, a sloop which had earlier attacked George Lowther near Blanco. However, they were soon met by a French man of war and forced to flee. After their escape, they captured a schooner near Bermuda and then, as they neared Saint Kitts, they captured a sloop on July 4, 1724. During this latest capture, the crew were tortured by Spriggs and his crew hoisting prisoners as high as the main or top sails and dropping them against the deck. Shortly after this, a ship out of Rhode Island was captured with the pirates riding several of the horses it had been carrying out on the deck (after several accidents, however, the captives were blamed for not bringing along boots and spurs). Return to the Bay of Honduras Here Spriggs rejoined forces with Captain Shipton, who had been given command of Low's ship Merry Christmas after Low's crew mutinied. After the capture of a sloop off Port Royal, Spriggs was forced to retreat from two British warships, and . After their most recent escape, Spriggs captured another sloop and, on his return to the Bay of Honduras, took another ten or twelve English vessels before being chased off by a British man of war. Briefly staying in South Carolina, Spriggs again sailed to the Bay of Honduras where he captured sixteen more vessels before fleeing from the same British warship he had previously encountered. He again managed to avoid capture, although his fleet broke up when he became separated from Shipton. It may have been around this time that Spriggs' quartermaster Philip Lyne took the prize ship Sea Nymph and left Spriggs to sail for Newfoundland. Little is known of his later career; according to newspaper accounts, he was still active in the region and, as of April 1725, had captured several more ships. One newspaper account does suggest Spriggs was still active as late as 1726 when he was marooned on an island with Shipton and another famous pirate, Edward Low. The report comes from the Post-Boy dated June 25, 1726. The only known original of the Post-Boy newspaper still in existence is owned by Eric Bjotvedt and states, in a front-page report, that a sloop from the Bay of Honduras was taken by a Spanish vessel, but that later the Spaniards were captured and \\"...put on board the Diamond Man of War, who had taken a Pyrate, commanded by one Cooper, and had a great many Prisoners on board, and was bound to Jamaica with them ... [and] that Lowe and Spriggs were both maroon'd, and were got among the Musketoo Indians.\\" According to another source, Spriggs and Shipton were still being pursued by HMS Diamond and Spence; Spriggs' men were captured alongside a sleeping Shipton, while both Spriggs and Low himself escaped again, and Cooper blew up his ship with gunpowder rather than be captured.
