Released in 2014 by Westland Press's Tranquebar imprint (), Kalyug is about a bloodless coup in India in 2012 following the death of a decorated war veteran, Major General Iqbal Qureshi. Drawing parallels from the India of those days, Kalyug is part-satire, part-fiction and was noted for its subtle references to real-world incidents and characters.  Summary  The death of a decorated war veteran, one of India's foremost military officials, triggers a chain of events that threatens to spiral out of control. The democratically elected government is overthrown and a new one is formed in its place. A fierce and pure regime that promises its people the kind of governance they have been deprived of. Just. Fair. Unyielding. Operation Kalyug has begun. Caught in the middle is Bala Murali Selvam, a writer who is still tormented by the memories of his persecution at the hands of the erstwhile-establishment. As the new government battles factions fighting for control, international intervention, personal agendas and incompatible motives, Selvam is swept along, a bewildered-pawn in a high-stakes game. Forced to question everything he has believed so far, even his innate sense of justice, Selvam struggles to choose sides. Will his instincts fail him when he needs them the most?  Background  According to the author, Kalyug was inspired in part by the 1974 Emergency, about which opinions still remain divided. There are also references to events that happened in 2012 and 2013, particularly the scams that exposed the then government to a lot of ridicule.  Reception  Kalyug has received good reviews from many readers on account of its fast pace, relevance and thought-provoking passages. Critics have pulled up the rather sudden ending, calling it clich√©d in contrast to the unusual narrative that preceded it.

It was introduced to the public on 14 April 1990. Being a variant of the M48 Patton, it is also known as the M48H Main Battle Tank. The CM-11 is a hybrid M60 chassis fitted with the turret from the older M48 Patton and the fire control system of the M1 Abrams.  Development History  The Republic of China (Taiwan) established the Armored Vehicle Development Center in 1980, and was tasked to develop military armored vehicles, and had cooperated with General Dynamics to develop the CM-11.Global Defense Magazine Vol. 70, June 1990 The development of the tank has two main purposes, first was to avoid the limitations set by the US-PRC Joint Communique (17 August Communique), and second was to allow the ROCA to acquire Second Generation MBTs. The CM-11 is a hybrid tank using the M48A3 turret with the M60A3 tank hull, combined with the new M1 Abrams tank's Fire-Control System (FCS). The United States designated it as M48H, where the \\"H\\" means Hybrid, and the Republic of China designated it CM-11 and named it Brave Tiger.  Design  In 1988, two prototypes were finished and 450 CM-11 were ordered to built. The M60A3 hull was procured from the United States in 1987, and the M48A3 turret and the M68A1 105mm main cannon was produced by the Army Ordnance Maintenance and Development Center. The commander's turret was procured from Israel with an M2 Browning 12.7mm (.50 caliber) machine gun, the loader operates an M240 7.62mm machine gun, the coaxial machine gun is also an M240. Both sides of the turret have a M239 smoke grenade launcher mounted, like the M60A3 tank. = Advantages = The greatest features and advantages of the CM-11 are that it has the same level of digital/analog hybrid ballistic calculator as the M1A1 Abrams; it has a two-dimensional sighting and gun stabilization system, more complete than the M60A3's one-dimensional stabilizing device; combining the AN/VSG-2 thermal imager, AN/VVS-2 Image Intensifier, AN/GVS-5 Nd-YAG laser rangefinder, allowing the CM-11 to have fire-on-the-move and night combat capabilities. It also has the highest probability of first-round hit compared to all other ROCA tanks. = Disadvantages = Disadvantages of the CM-11 are its outdated design, armor, and gun. The Chinese PLA's second-generation Type 96G tank and its third-generation Type 99 tank are both armed with a 125mm main cannon. The CM-11's armor does not offer significant protection against their 125mm APFSDS and HEAT shots. The ROCA knew this disadvantage very early, and tried to introduce explosive reactive armor (ERA) from the French company GIAT. However, the weight of the additional ERA installations caused excessive stress on the M60 chassis's torsion bar suspension, so plans to install ERA on the tanks was put on hold until a solution was found. The CM-11's 750 hp (560 kW) Continental AVDS-1790-2 V12, air-cooled twin-turbo diesel engine is 50-year-old technology as well, having been introduced in February 1963 with the first 600 U.S. Army converted M48A3s. During the Spring Festival in 2012, the ROCA's 542 Armor Brigade of 6th Army Corps initiated their combat readiness drill, and showed a CM-11 installed with ERA for the first time. Developed by CSIST, angling was applied to the ERA design to reduce the probability of penetrating the hull.

The film stars Travis Fimmel, Rachael Taylor, Forest Whitaker, and William Fichtner, telling the story of a gang planning to steal millions of dollars from President Nixon's illegal political slush fund. It was released in the United States on March 15, 2019, by Momentum Pictures. The film is based on the United California Bank robbery.  Plot  In 1980, Harry James Barber tells his story about the California bank burglary he committed eight years ago to his girlfriend Molly Murphy, whose relationship is under strain after discovering his secret. In 1972, Harry lives next to a refurbished theater house in Pennsylvania and is a big fan of actor Steve McQueen. Harry had agreed to the plan led by the handler Enzo Rotella of burglarizing the bank supposedly containing the illegal slush fund of President Richard Nixon. The team is joined by Paul Callahan, Raymond Darrow, and Harry's brother Tommy Barber - a Vietnam War veteran. The gang travels to California and rents a vacation house not far away from the bank. Harry meets the widow Molly Murphy at a bar, whose husband was killed in a vehicular accident. Harry and Molly happily develop their relationship, but he hides his secret about his scheme from Molly throughout the relationship. At night, the gang disables the alarm system, and enters the bank vault by blowing a hole into the vault roof with dynamite. After three days of burglary, they successfully loot about $9 million overall; however, Harry receives only $10,000, and the rest of the team go their separate ways. After the burglary, the bank job has become public knowledge and FBI agents Howard Lambert and Sharon Price take the case. After a thorough investigation, they eventually locate the vacation house linked to the job and manage to identify the culprits through fingerprints left on unwashed dishes and utensils. All members of the gang are subsequently arrested by the authorities, except Harry who escapes and goes on the run. In 1980, Harry tells Molly that he is done running from the law and he had called her father, a sheriff, to arrest him. As they get out from the diner, Howard and the local sheriffs arrive and Harry kisses her goodbye before being brought to the detention. The epilogue states that Harry was sentenced to seven years in prison but is reduced to three years after the letter from the Sheriff was signed by the townspeople to attest to Harry's character.  Cast   Production  Principal photography on the film began in early September 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia. Scenes were filmed in Dallas, Georgia in early October.

Biography William Deering Davis (known by his middle name) was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of physician Nathan Smith Davis, Jr. and Jessie B. Hopkins, who was the daughter of lawyer James C. Hopkins. He graduated from the University of Chicago. Enlisting in the Aviation Section of the U.S. Signal Corps in 1917, he was sent to Italy, where he flew scouting missions.

The painting can be seen as one of a number of Venetian paintings of the 1510s showing two or three half-length figures with heads close together, often with their expressions and interactions enigmatic. Most of these are \\"Giorgionesque\\" genre or tronie subjects where the subjects are anonymous, though the group includes Titian's The Tribute Money, with Christ as the main figure, which in terms of style is similar to this painting,Jaff√©, 98 and his Lucretia and her Husband, also in Vienna, where at least the woman's identity is clear, if not that of the man.Steer, 114-116 Alternative attributions are to Giorgione (in the past) and Palma Vecchio. Description Against a dark background two male figures are shown, one in front of the other, with the rear one looking over his shoulder at a foreground figure who is tapping his shoulder, making him turn sharply. This foreground figure is dressed in armour and his other hand hides a dagger or a sword of which we see only the hilt, suggesting an attack is imminent. The rear figure is a young man with flowing blonde hair, wearing a garland of vine leaves on his head, who has also reached for his weapon, the hilt dimly visible at bottom centre. The foreground figure has his head turned away from the viewer. Various attempts have been made to assign the scene to a specific incident in myth or history. One suggestion is the arrest of Bacchus's follower Acoetes by Pentheus, king of Thebes, which would explain the wreath of vine-leaves in his hair.Jaff√©, 98 An x-ray of the painting showed that the head of the man on the right (the foreground figure) once wore a crown. History and attribution The painting was probably in the Venetian collection of Zuanantonio Venier in 1526, who had one then described as \\"two half-figures attacking each other by Titian\\".Jaff√©, 98 In 1636 it was sold to the Duke of Hamilton, who brought it to London. Most of his purchases were from the collection of Bartolomeo della Nave, who perhaps had it by then. After Hamilton's execution, it was acquired by Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, whose collection later became part of the Habsburg imperial collection in Vienna, then passed to the Kunsthistorisches Museum. An etching after a reduced copy by David Teniers the Younger shows the painting attributed to Giorgione.Catalog #23 in Teniers the Younger's publication Theatrum Pictorium The painting must have been a popular painting when it was in the Archduke's cabinet, as it was portrayed in some of his gallery paintings by Teniers. The work was attributed to Titian by the Italian art historian Roberto Longhi, which remains usual.

The band consists of Phil Douglas, Jason Lubrano, Gordon Lafler, Mike Bruno, and Jesse Litwa. The band has released 3 records to date. All three of their albums have received positive reviews on websites such as Pitchfork, Noisey and PunkNews.org. The band released their third album and first for SideOneDummy Records, titled You Can't Stay Here, on October 13, 2017. Background Iron Chic was formed in 2008 after the dissolution of Phil Douglas' and Brian Crozier's former band Latterman. Following Latterman's break up, Douglas initially joined Small Arms Dealer as a drummer which featured vocalist Jason Lubrano. Small Arms Dealer broke up shortly thereafter with Lubrano and Douglas deciding to start a new band altogether, recruiting Crozier, as well as drummer Gordon Lafler and bassist John Mee. This band released the Demo 2008 and Shitty Rambo under this line up. The band almost broke up the following year when Crozier had to leave the band due to health issues and Mee was asked to leave due to tension within the band. The band immediately chose to continue with Rob McAllister of Capital, and Mike Bruno of Down In The Dumps, Get Bent and Jonesin' as well as owner/operator of Dead Broke Rekerds replacing Crozier and Mee respectively. The new lineup released the debut album, Not Like This, to critical acclaim. The band toured steadily through the year in support of Not Like This and released their 3rd EP, Split N' Shit in 2011. In 2013, the band released the Spooky Action EP in anticipation for their Bridge Nine Records debut The Constant One, which followed later in the year to once again critical acclaim. In 2015 the band replaced Rob McAllister with Broadcaster guitarist Jesse Litwa and released 2 EP's over the course the year: A split with New Mexico's Low Culture and the Y's single. Rob McAllister unexpectedly died on January 9, 2016 at the age of 36. In 2017 the band released their third album overall and first for SideOneDummy Records titled You Can't Stay Here. Written in response to singer Jason Lubrano's divorce and McAllister's death, the album showcased more darker themes and experimentation in contrast to their previous work. They released their first music video for the album's second track, \\"My Best Friend (Is A Nihilist)\\". The band toured with Propaghandi, Hot Water Music and Heartsounds in support of the album. On November 16, 2018, the band released a split with Toys That Kill composed of songs from the You Can't Stay Here sessions. It was released via Recess Records and the band's own Dead Broke Rekerds. DIY ethic The band has earned recognition and respect for being an entirely self-sustaining band. All the band's recordings are handled by guitarist Phil Douglas at his studio: The Hobo House (Douglas has also produced music by Latterman, RVIVR, Petal Head, Crash The Calm and Tender Defender), all the band's artwork is done by singer Jason Lubrano who also runs graphic design company Righteous Indignation with additional designs provided by drummer Gordon Lafler and all the band's merch, EP's and albums (except for 2013's The Constant One and 2017's You Can't Stay Here) is handled and distributed though bassist Mike Bruno's Dead Broke Rekerds (who has also released albums from Beach Slang, Samiam and Fifteen).

The main super stars are Niki Karimi, Jamshid Hashempur, Shahab Hosseini and Merila Zarei. The film depicts Fereshteh's adversities, an underpaid school teacher, after she loses her husband in an accident, so her father-in-law takes the custodycustody of her two sons unless she marries his younger remaining son. Fereshteh makes up her mind, and decides to escape abroad by the aid of her friends, so she can take care of her sons; however, her father-in-law suspects and in a hot pursuit, throws her in jail. The Fifth Reaction, released in 2003, reveals how the patriarchal society views women, and their cultural position. It is Tahmineh Milani's seventh movie regarding women's social position and rights in a patriarchal society which encourages women to struggle to get their human rights back. The movie reflects the inability of Iranian women to take any action in a patriarchal society, and its major concerns are female identity, women's position and power in the society, sexism, the social inequality and injustice, and mainly law's ignoring women's rights in child custody case. Tahmine Milani has related to these matters to awaken women and inspire them to fight for their rights. Fortunately, her works have a great impact on women's awareness and inspire them to try for their social improvement. Plot The opening scene of the film captures Fereshteh among her four other friends and colleagues in a luxury restaurant, gathering for lunch to comfort Fereshteh for the loss of her husband. Typical for this feminist women, they always discuss about their personal problems as women in Iran in their patriarchal society and decide to make feminist movements to stop the inequality and injustice towards women; however, they always talk without taking any further steps. As Fereshteh's father-in-law takes the custody of her two sons, her friends, unlike her lawyer, find it just the perfect opportunity to stand against men. Entertaining themselves with the battle between Fereshteh and her father-in-law, they help her to escape abroad. This game goes on while each competitor tries to score more. Finally, the father-in-law arrests Fereshteh in Bushehr while she is trying to escape to Dubai through seaway. In the closing scene of the movie, we see the patronizing, snobbish and arrogant presence of the father-in-law as his shadow darkens Fereshteh's face as he stands above her in jail and conditions her freedom to his own terms. The father-in-law with his indescribable power is far \\"too extreme to be a credible character\\" due to all injustice he brings to Fereshteh, the lonely woman who valiantly fights in the battle and draws the admiration of the audience. His ego, selfishness and pursuit for his individual desires points to his psychological impediment to perceive women other than weak creatures who have no power to encounter men. About Tahmine Milani Tahmine Milani is an Iranian director who was born in 1969 in Tabriz. She is known for her endeavors for women's rights. The majority of her works include brave women who suffer from difficult conditions and try for their rights. She sees women as humans who must fight for their rights. She is regarded as a social feminist who invites the society to reconsider their conception of women and their roles in the society.

The device is on display at the MIT Museum. The mechanism allowed food manufacturers to control qualities in process and design future food products with specific properties. He later earned an M.B.A. from Northeastern University in 1970. =Career= Brody started his career, while in school, in food technology with the Birdseye Fisheries Lab Division of General Foods in 1951 as a team member in the development of the first frozen precooked foods including fish sticks. While a graduate student, he worked part-time for Raytheon Manufacturing Company where he was a member of a team that developed the first microwave oven, leading to microwave cooking, heating, and browning of foods. After he earned his graduate degree, Brody worked for the Whirlpool Corporation in Benton Harbor, Michigan. He led the development of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), invented an odor control system for refrigerators, a thermoelectric refrigerator/freezer, the Total Environmental Control ‚ÄúTectrol‚Äù controlled atmosphere process for food preservation,Innovations in Food Packaging (2005). New York. Elsevier Academic Press. a progenitor of MAP fresh-cut vegetables, and radiation pasteurization of foods. While at Whirlpool, he invented and patented an apparatus and method of storing perishable animal and plant materials, as well as non-food materials. He developed commercial confectionery products including Starburst (confectionery) and Pop Rocks while employed at M&M; Candies Division of Mars, Inc. At Mead Packaging, he invented the Crosscheck Aseptic Packaging System for high acid fluid food products used commercially for juices and sauces, receiving patents US4,152,464, US4,391,080, US4,409,775. At Container Corporation of America, he led the development of the Versaform insert injection molding system, and he was Marketing Development Manager, which was his last position in corporate America. By the mid 1980s, Brody transitioned into an independent consultant and college professor. He has taught undergraduate and graduate food packaging and food product development and marketing courses at The University of Georgia, MBA strategic marketing and product development courses at Saint Joseph's University, and packaging courses at Michigan State University. Brody is author of numerous articles and ten textbooks in food packaging and food technology, marketing, and packaging. He authored The Encyclopedia of Packaging Technology that covers technologies used to package consumer and industrial products across industries from food to automobiles, soft drinks to pharmaceuticals He also authored Modified Atmosphere Packaging for Fresh-Cut Fruits and Vegetables that covers modern MAP technologies for fresh-cut fruits. =Family= Aaron Brody married Carolyn Goldstein, April 11, 1953. They have three children. Honors In 1964, Brody was awarded the Industrial Achievement Award by the Institute of Food Technologists and the Leadership Award by the Packaging Institute. He was named Packaging Man of the Year in 1985 by the National Association of Packaging, Handling, and Logistics Engineers. The Institute of Food Technologists' Food Packaging Division gave Brody the highest industry award, the Riester-Davis Award for Lifetime Achievement in Food Packaging, in 1988. He was the first recipient of the Institute of Food Technologists' Industrial Scientist Award in 1994 for scientists who made technical contributions to advancing the food industry. In 1995, Brody was inducted into the Packaging Hall of Fame. In 2000, he was awarded the Nicholas Appert Award by the Institute of Food Technologists in recognition of his lifetime contributions. The Michigan State School of Packaging established the Annual Aaron Brody Distinguished Lecture In Food Packaging in perpetuity. This is an endowment that was created by family and friends of Aaron L. Brody and Carolyn Brody in recognition of Aaron‚Äôs lifelong achievements in Food Packaging. The Food Packaging Division of the Institute of Food Technologist renamed the Riester- Davis Award to include Aaron Brody‚Äôs name in 2015 and now called the Riester- Davis-Brody Award. He has been quoted in The New York Times, and featured on National Public Radio and CNN news. One of his NPR interviews was titled, The Weird, Underappreciated World Of Plastic Packaging where he explains that plastic packaging has become an ingrained part of the food system. On CNN, he described how new plastics may keep soft drinks from falling flat. Books *Developing New Food Products for a Changing Marketplace, Second Edition (2000, with John B. Lord).

He was beatified in July 1867 by Pope Pius IX.Fros SJ, Henryk \\"Book of names and saints\\", pp. 423‚Äì37, 2007 \\"Martirologio\\", Roman Curia Pontifical Academies  Early life  Ludovicus Baba was born in Japan. He was befriended by a young missionary friar, Luis Sotelo, from the Franciscan Order.  Servant of Father Sotelo  Luis Sotelo tried to establish a Franciscan church in the area of Edo. The church was destroyed in 1612, following the interdiction of Christianity in the territories of the Tokugawa shogunate on 21 April 1612. After a period of intense missionary activity by the Catholic Church, Tokugawa Hidetada, the second sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, issued a decree which banned the practice and teaching of the Christian faith, and under the threat of loss of life, all the missionaries had to leave Japan. This decree started the bloody persecution of Christians, which lasted several decades. After healing a concubine of the powerful daimy≈ç of Sendai, Date Masamune, in Edo, Sotelo was invited to the northern part of Japan, in the area controlled by Date, under whom Christianity was still allowed. He came back to Tokyo the following year and constructed and inaugurated a new church on 12 May 1613, in the area of Asakusa Torigoe. The Bakufu reacted by arresting the Christians, and Sotelo himself was put in the Kodenma-ch≈ç prison. Seven fellow Japanese Christians, who had been arrested with Sotelo, were executed on 1 July, but he was freed following a special request by Date Masamune. Sotelo, fluent in Japanese, planned and acted as translator on a Japanese embassy sent by Date Masamune to Madrid on 28 October 1613. Baba accompanied Sotelo and the representatives of Japan, on their voyage to Europe, as his personal servant. The embassy was headed by Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and crossed the Pacific Ocean to Acapulco on board the Japanese-built galleon San Juan Bautista. Baba cooked and resided with Sotelo during their nine and a-half months stay in Mexico in 1614. The embassy continued to Vera Cruz and Sanl√∫car de Barrameda, Seville, and Madrid. Sotelo had the Japanese receive baptism while in Madrid, before accompanying them to an audience with Pope Paul V in Rome. The embassy was a product of ambitions of Sotelo to increase the spread of the church in Japan and of Date Masamune to provide more priests for the churches of his Christian subjects and to establish trade between Sendai and New Spain, and it had the approval of the shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. Pope Paul V appointed Sotelo to be new Bishop of ≈åsh≈´ (in Northern Honsh≈´). When the party returned to Manila in June 1618, Bishop-elect Sotelo kept his personal secretary, Ludovicus Sasada, and his servant, Baba, near.  Return to Japan and Martyrdom  In 1622, Sotelo, Sasada and Baba, set sail for Japan, disguised as merchants. As the Chinese captain suspected them for religious missionaries, they were surrendered to governmental authorities at Nagasaki. Within six months, these three prisoners were transferred to the new prison at ≈åmura. Their imprisonment almost lasted for two years, however during this time, Baba was received into the Third Order Secular of Saint Francis by Sotelo. Two other missionary priests, Pedro V√°squez, OP and Miguel de Carvalho, SJ, eventually joined these three Franciscans in captivity. Their life in the ≈åmura prison was like a friary. These priests performed their religious exercises and celebrated Holy Mass. The imprisoned Christians at the risk of their lives procured what was needed. On 24 August, a death sentence was ordered.Borrelli, Antonio \\"Blessed Michael Carvalho, Jesuit martyr\\", 2005-02-22 When they received the news they sang the Te Deum. At ten in the morning, they were taken by boat to the place of execution. They were tied to stakes and a fire was placed around them. Sotelo was placed in the center and the two Japanese were on the outside of the circle. Since the fire burned the ropes of the two Japanese Franciscans, Sasada and Baba prostrated themselves towards the center stake and asked for the Bishop-elect's blessing. Sotelo invoked God's blessing upon them and they returned to their stakes until they were overcome by the fire and smoke. As Sotelo was the farthest from the flames, the executioners put more wood on the fire closer to him. After these martyrs died, the soldiers burned their remains in another fire and took their ashes in a boat to dispose of them at sea, to prevent them being carried away by the Christians, even though a witness was able to collect some of Pedro V√°squez's cremains and had them deposited in a Jesuit Church in the Philippines. Baba was beatified by Pope Pius IX on 7 July 1867. In the Roman Catholic Church, his feast day is celebrated on 25 August, as well as 10 September, the anniversary of the massacre of 205 Japanese martyrs.

The ninth tropical depression, eighth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed in the Florida Straits on August 28 from a long-tracked tropical wave. The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Caribbean, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba. In the former, the storm damaged more than 200 homes and displaced over 1,000 people. Although some areas of Cuba recorded more than of rain, the precipitation was generally beneficial due to a severe drought. After being designated on August 29, Hermine shifted northeastwards due to a trough over Georgia and steadily intensified into an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane just before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle during September 2\\\\. After moving inland, Hermine quickly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 3 near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The remnant system meandered offshore the Northeastern United States before dissipating over southeastern Massachusetts on September 8\\\\. In preparation of Hermine, multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Southeastern United States, while state of emergencies were declared in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Storm surge and heavy rainfall along the Florida gulf coast caused significant damage. In Citrus County, one of the worst areas impacted, 2,694 structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage, while damage reached about $102 million. Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7 homes were destroyed, 305 sustained major damage, and 1,564 received minor damage. Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000 people were left without electricity, including 80% of Tallahassee. One death occurred in the state after a tree fell on a homeless man's tent near Ocala. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina caused further damage, but to a lesser degree. One fatality each occurred in South Carolina and North Carolina. In New York, two fishermen drowned near the Wading River on Long Island due to rough surf. Overall, Hermine caused about $550 million (2016 USD) in damage in the United States. Meteorological history A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa between late August 16 and early August 17. On August 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the tropical wave as a potential area for development, associated with an area of disorganized convection about 300 mi (480 km) southwest of Cabo Verde. Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization. Dry and stable air was an initial inhibiting factor in development, with deep convection waning on August 20 and August 21. However, the convection and circulation had become better defined by August 21. By August 23, the system had developed an elongated and poorly- defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters, though convention continued to expand. On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds. By this point, the NHC noted that the system could develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation. Marginal wind shear disrupted the system's organization, and it passed north of Puerto Rico without further development, with winds dropping below gale-force on August 25. Initially, the system moved quickly westward with a forward speed averaging about , but slowed down considerably after the northern portion of the wave split off on August 26. The low pressure area crossed the southern Bahamas with scattered convection, becoming more defined on August 27 while moving near the northern Cuban coast. Wind shear prevented quicker development, although conditions became more favorable closer to the Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, the convection increased and became more organized. Later that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation. Based on the observations and the convective organization, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00 UTC on August 28 while situated about 60 mi (100 km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida. A rainstorm on the edge of Hermine, shortly after the hurricane achieved Category 1 status. Deep convection increased further as the depression moved more into the Gulf of Mexico, steered by a ridge over southern Florida, although it remained ragged and displaced from the circulation. Dry air to the system's west negated the otherwise favorable warm waters. The depression failed to organize more on August 30 as the low- and mid-level circulations remained misaligned. A large plume of convection developed over the system on August 31 as outflow improved and wind shear decreased. Later that day, reports from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine about 395 mi (640 km) southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. Late on August 31, Hermine began accelerating to the northeast, influenced by a developing mid-level trough over the southeastern United States. Lessening shear and water temperatures around allowed the storm to intensify. Although outflow was restricted to the northwest, curved rainbands increased over the eastern half of the system, increasing the extent of tropical storm-force winds. Additionally, a ragged eye became visible on satellite imagery on September 1, and at 18:00 UTC, Hermine intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. GPM Core Satellite on September 6 The hurricane strengthened slightly further to a peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) by 00:00 UTC on September 2. At around 05:30 UTC (1:30 a.m. EDT) that day, Hermine made landfall just east of St. Marks, Florida, at peak intensity, with a minimum pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 29.00 inHg). Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005. Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded. The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast. The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough. With the convection far ahead of the circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC on September 3 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center, while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. By September 5, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the overall system slowed and turned to the northwest, steered by a ridge to the north. The convection began waning on the next day, as the storm turned due westward. At 18:00 UTC on September 6, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post- tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken amid cooler waters and convective stability. The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, eventually dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts late on September 8. Preparations Workers preparing sandbags ahead of Hermine in North Charleston, South Carolina On August 30, the NHC began issuing tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Florida gulf coast. By the time Hermine reached hurricane status, a hurricane warning was in place from the mouth of the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. A tropical storm warning extended southward to Englewood, which included the Tampa Bay Area, and westward to the Walton‚ÄìBay county line. A hurricane watch was also in effect from the mouths of the Suwannee and Anclote rivers. On August 31, a tropical storm watch was added for the Atlantic coast between Marineland, Florida, to the Altamaha Sound in Georgia. As Hermine approached and moved up the coast, tropical storm warnings were in place as far south as Marineland, and as far northeast as Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, including portions of the Tidal Potomac River, the Chesapeake and Delaware bays, Long Island Sound, New York City, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. All tropical storm warnings were dropped when the NHC discontinued advisories at 18:00 UTC on September 6. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for 51 counties. In response to the then-developing storm, early voting for the primary election on August 30 was extended by one day in Bradford, Broward, Charlotte, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach. and Pinellas counties. In six counties, school was canceled on September 1 and 2, while twenty-nine other counties had no school on September 2. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Dixie, Franklin, Taylor, and Wakulla counties. States of emergencies were declared in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey due to the storm. Hermine affected the east coast of the United States during the busy Labor Day weekend, causing many beaches to be closed in Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Amtrak canceled or altered train lines due to the threat from the storm. In Savannah, Georgia, Bacon Fest was cancelled, and a beer fest was moved indoors. In Charleston, South Carolina, the city government provided 3,000 sandbags to residents, preparing less than a year after damaging floods hit the state. Outer Banks ferry service was cancelled and bridges in Dare County, North Carolina, were closed due to the high winds. Officials deployed or readied swift water teams, helicopters, and the North Carolina National Guard in the eastern portion of the state. The Virginia National Guard utilized 270 members to help prepare for the storm's potential flooding and power outages. A Bruce Springsteen concert in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was postponed two days, and several performances for the town's American Music Festival were cancelled or moved indoors. Impact =Caribbean= On Antigua, a lightning strike produced by thunderstorms associated with the precursor tropical wave severely damaged two 69 kV transmission lines, causing an island-wide blackout on August 24. Some locations in Puerto Rico observed of rainfall, causing flooding, especially in the Ponce area. Primarily, streets were inundated with water, though at least one house was flooded. In the Dominican Republic, some areas received nearly of rain on August 25 alone from Hermine's precursor. In 19 provinces, residents and authorities were on alert due to rapidly rising rivers and expectations of flooding. Throughout the country, the storm damaged more than 200 homes and displaced over 1,000 people. While in its developmental stages, the precursor low dropped of rainfall across northern Cuba. Candelaria in western Cuba recorded . At Cienfuegos, of precipitation fell in only three hours. The rains alleviated drought conditions and helped replenish reservoirs, while also causing landslides. The Zaza Reservoir ‚Äì the largest in Cuba ‚Äì increased its total water volume by , bringing the levels to 30% capacity. In Bataban√≥ on Cuba's southern coast, of rainfall caused moderate flooding. Near Havana, the electric company shut off power to prevent accidents, while damage occurred to gas lines. =United States= Total economic losses across the United States reached US$550 million. Insured losses to property in Florida reached US$80 million with 14,890 claims. Florida Infrared satellite loop of Hermine making landfall in Florida on September 2 Ahead of the hurricane's landfall, a station south of Apalachicola reported wind gusts of at an elevation of . At sea level, sustained winds reached at Keaton Beach, with gusts . While moving ashore, Hermine produced a storm surge at Cedar Key. Heavy rainfall occurred across western Florida, reaching over 72 hours at the Lake Tarpon Canal in Pinellas County. The outer rainbands of Hermine spawned an EF0 tornado just southwest of Windermere with a width of and winds. On the ground for , the twister damaged about 100 trees, along with several fences and windows. The storm spawned three other EF0 tornadoes, all in Taylor County, none of which caused damage. High winds from the hurricane knocked down many trees in northwestern Florida, some of which fell onto power lines and roofs. The resulting power outages affected about 325,000 people, roughly 1% of all homes and businesses in the state. In Leon County, where the state capital Tallahassee is, 57% of homes lost power, including approximately 80% of the city proper, as well as Florida State University. Of the 145,000 homes and businesses that lost electricity, 3,685 were still without power six days after the storm. Strong winds in the Tallahassee area caused trees to fall onto several houses, injuring a number of people. Hermine was the first hurricane to directly affect the city since Hurricane Kate in 1985. Throughout Leon County, 45 homes or businesses were destroyed, 187 suffered severe damage, and 259 experienced minor damage. Losses across Leon County reached $10.3 million. Radar image of Hurricane Hermine about 40 minutes after landfall Storm surge and abnormally high tides caused significant damage along the Gulf Coast of Florida. In Franklin County, coastal flooding occurred in Alligator Point, Apalachicola, and Carrabelle. A total of 27 homes or businesses were demolished, 43 suffered major damage, and 102 others sustained minor damage. Winds in Wakulla County downed a number of trees, with 133 falling on roadways and 7 falling on homes. A total of 115 power lines were downed, with about 14,759 customers losing electricity. The Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory in Panacea suffered extensive damage, especially to their educational Living Dock. The Wakulla River at Wakulla Springs reached its second highest level recorded, behind only Hurricane Dennis in 2005. One business was destroyed and four homes sustained severe damage, while an additional forty-three dwellings experienced minor damage. In Jefferson County, much of the impact consisted of downed trees and power lines. About 62% of residents were left without electricity. Strong winds in Madison County left similar impact, but little structural damage. However, the Madison Creative Arts School suffered severe roof damage, while a mansion was damaged by a large falling tree. Twelve people were rescued in Taylor County due to storm surge, including six in Steinhatchee. Throughout the county, approximately 75 homes or businesses were inflicted major damage, while 60 suffered minor impact. At Dekle Beach, the storm damaged several buildings and wrecked a fishing pier. In Dixie County, storm surge heights generally ranged from and peaked just inches below observations during the 1993 Storm of the Century. A total of 61 homes or businesses that were demolished, 540 sustained major damage, and 322 suffered minor impact. Much of the damage in Levy County was also due to storm surge, with above average tides observed. In Cedar Key, storm surge washed across the entire island. The only grocery store suffered wind and coastal flood damage, with food scattered on the floor. At a motel, water swept away air conditioners and left seaweed and mud inside. The storm caused an electrical fire that burnt down the clam processing plant. On Dock Street, which contains several restaurants on stilts, the decks and interiors of the restaurants were damaged. The post office and city hall were severely damaged. Storm damage in Cedar Key was estimated at over $10 million. Additionally, over 40 homes and businesses in west Yankeetown were damaged by coastal flooding. Throughout Levy County, one structure was destroyed, 68 suffered major damage, and 51 others received minor impact. Coastal areas of Citrus County suffered from significant flooding; 2,694 structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage. Total losses in the county reached $102 million. Damage to a church in Tallahassee, Florida In Hernando County, the storm destroyed two houses and severely damaged 18 more, with 179 sustaining minor damage; the county damage toll was estimated at $7.8 million. Heavy rainfall in the Tampa Bay Area flooded streets, causing cars to stall, and forced people to evacuate their homes. Power outages affected the local wastewater treatment plant, causing of partially treated sewage to flow into Hillsborough Bay. In Pasco County, 18 people required rescue from high-water vehicles and were transported to nearby shelters. Property damage totaled $111 million, making Hermine one of the costliest storms on record in the county. Of the 2,672 households affected, 7 were destroyed, 305 sustained major damage, and 1,564 sustained minor damage. Damage incurred by roads was estimated at $30‚Äì50 million. Much of the impact in Hillsborough County was caused by wind, with a gust up to observed at Port Tampa. Throughout the county, 8 homes sustained minor damage, 7 dwellings experienced major damage, and 9 homes were destroyed. Damage was estimated at $800,000. In Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, about 39,000 people lost electricity. Numerous trees were uprooted or snapped in Alachua County, with several damaging homes in Gainesville. A number of power lines were also downed. In Marion County, trees were reported downed in several areas. A falling tree damaged a house, while another fell on a road and was later hit by a car, causing two people to be hospitalized. Additionally, a homeless man camping near Ocala was killed when a tree fell on his tent.

In Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, Hermine's passage left around 274,000 people without power. In Georgia, Hermine's winds knocked down trees onto cars and homes, resulting in several injuries in the subsequent cleanup process, although there was no major damage. The storm spawned two EF1 tornadoes in the state. The first, with a path, knocked down or broke thousands of trees in Liberty County, some of which fell onto homes. The other struck Skidaway Island and downed hundreds of trees, causing damage to 20 roofs. On St. Simons Island, the storm sank up to five boats at the Morning Star Marina. In southwestern Georgia, impact in several counties was limited to down trees and power lines, including in Berrien, Colquitt, Cook, Dougherty, Grady, Tift, Thomas, Lanier, Mitchell, and Worth counties. A pecan farm near Ray City, located in Berrien County, suffered roughly US$4 million in damage as winds of felled about 1,000 trees and ruined 1 million pounds of fruit. In Grady County, about 2,800 customers lost electricity. The storm left power outages in Colquitt County, where a tree fell on a house. Winds in Dougherty County downed tree limbs that damage two roofs, while 200 electrical service losses occurred. In Tift County, trees and power lines were downed on many roadways, including Route 41 and Route 125. It was estimated that Lowndes County experienced sustained winds near . The storm downed a number of trees and power lines, with hundreds falling in Valdosta, resulting in the closure of about 90 roads throughout Lowndes County. Some of the trees also fell on houses. Another road was closed after a box culvert washed out. A bridge along Old Quitman Road was damaged and required repairs. Additionally, about 31,000 customers were left without electricity. The winds downed approximately 1,000 pecans trees, leaving about $3 million in damage to the pecan crop. Property damage totaled around $1 million. Sewer systems were overwhelmed by heavy rainfall, causing up a sewage spillage of up to 117,000 gallons. Post-Tropical Cyclone Hermine southeast of New England on September 5 The storm flooded roads and downed trees in South Carolina, mostly in Beaufort, Bluffton, and Hilton Head Island. At Hilton Head Island, falling trees severely damaged 13 homes, one of which just over two weeks after a tree had fallen in the same manner upon the same house. Damage to the dwellings reached about $250,000. Falling trees damaged at least two homes in Edisto Beach, while strong winds deroofed and ripped sidings off several other residences. In Cottageville, a man was killed after being hit by a car while he was removing a fallen tree from the highway. In the Charleston area, the airport observed a daily rainfall record of on September 2\\\\. A number of roads were flooded in downtown Charleston and North Charleston. In Dorchester County, high winds downed a number of trees, some of which caused roads to be closed. A tree also struck a liquid oxygen tank at the medical center in Summerville, causing a leak that forced the closure of all entrances to the complex. Nearly 7,000 people in the county were left without electricity at the height of the storm. Strong winds in eastern North Carolina resulted in sporadic power outages. Hermine spawned two EF1 tornadoes and one EF0 tornado over Outer Banks. One knocking over two trailers and injuring four people. The tornadoes collectively left about $30,000 in damage. High winds knocked over an 18-wheeler tractor-trailer crossing the Alligator River bridge on U.S. Route 64, killing the driver. Flooding covered portions of Highway 12, the main roadway through the Outer Banks. Bands of heavy rain associated with Hermine produced rainfall totals of over most of the region, with the highest amounts near the coast. Widespread poor drainage flooding occurred, with a few reports of flash flooding. Damage across Dare County reached $5.5 million; most of the damage was concentrated on Hatteras Island with flooding in Frisco and Hatteras. In Virginia, abnormally high tides resulted in coastal flooding, particularly in the Norfolk area. A number of low-lying and flood prone neighborhoods were inundated, while Willoughby Spit became impassable. Cars parked at Hague Tower apartments were submerged up to their windows. In Virginia Beach, winds downed signs and branches and ripped siding from a hotel. At another hotel, some rooms suffered roof leaks. On eastern Long Island, two fishermen drowned after being swept into the ocean near the Wading River due to rough surf. Their bodies were later recovered in Shoreham. Nantucket offshore Massachusetts recorded sustained winds of on September 5, with gusts to . Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas encountered seas and winds on its trek from New Jersey to Bermuda, leaving several passengers seasick. In Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, minor wind damage occurred because trees were still fully leaved in those states. Coastal flooding was limited due to storm surge peaking at low tide. Aftermath After Hermine exited the state, Florida governor Rick Scott took an aerial tour of the damage in Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, pledging that affected businesses would receive assistance from the state government. On September 20, Governor Scott submitted a request to the federal government for individual disaster assistance in 12 counties and public assistance in 15 counties. United States president Barack Obama issued a disaster declaration on September 28\\\\. Residents and households in Citrus, Dixie, Hernando, Hillsborough, Leon, Levy, Pasco, and Pinellas counties became eligible for aid. In Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Pasco, Pinellas, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla counties, money was allotted to state and local governments as well as some private, nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis; this fund allowed for emergency work on or replacement of buildings damaged by the storm. Additionally, the state of Florida received money from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for hazard mitigation. However, the disaster declaration was eventually expanded to several other counties. By November 2, Alachua, Baker, Columbia, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Manatee, Marion, Sarasota, Sumter, and Union counties were eligible for public assistance or both public and individual assistance. In addition to federal aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened five disaster recovery centers, with one in Citrus County, one in Dixie County, one in Leon County, and two in Levy County. These disaster centers were staffed by representatives of FEMA, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the Small Business Administration, and other state agencies. FEMA agents also went door-to-door in Tallahassee to ask residents about damage to their property. In Lee County, crews were deployed to collect plant debris. Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside debris removal, and two parks were closed. The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February, while the city hall has yet to reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall. In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15 hours after its closure to allow access to cleanup crews.

The Armored Vehicle Development Center (AVDC) used the extra 100 Fire Control System units from the production of the CM-11 to modify the existing M48A3 tanks of the ROC Army. The modification was completed before 1993.  Modifications  The CM-12 program selected some M48A3 hulls and replaced the petrol engines with diesel engines, installed a new transmission and replaced the turret with the CM-11's turret. The modified tank was renamed CM-12. During the Brave Tiger Case (CM-11), AVDC received a M48A5 for reference. The idea of the CM-12 derived from M48A5. Some of the M48A3 received modifications and were upgraded to M48A1/A2. The exterior of CM-12 and M48A5 are similar, but the interior is completely different; the main difference that replacing the engine and turret of M48A3, cost interior fuel capacity, decreasing its range. The Armament of CM-12 is identical to CM-11's. The main cannon is a M68A1 105 mm cannon, which can fire ammunition such as Armour-piercing fin- stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) Round. It can carry 60 rounds on board. One M2HB machine gun is mounted on the commander's cupola, one T-74 machine gun on the gunner's cupola, and one coaxial M240 machine gun inside the turret. The protection on CM-12 is outdated, and the material used is inferior to newer tanks. After the great disarmament of Ching Shih (Á≤æÂØ¶Ê°à) and Ching Chin (Á≤æÈÄ≤Ê°à), the existing CM-11 and M60A3 TTS are enough for ROCA, therefore almost half of the CM-12s are now retired.

In 754, Hieronymus was tasked with Fulradus, abbot of St. Denys, and others, to escort Pope Stephen II back to Rome.

These disorders are difficult to live with and often very difficult to treat, leaving individuals suffering for long periods of time. In general, ECT is not looked at as a first line approach to treating a mental disorder, but rather a last resort treatment when medications such as antidepressants are not helpful in reducing the clinical manifestations. \\"Electroconvulsive therapy entails deliberately inducing a modified generalized seizure under medically- controlled conditions to obtain a therapeutic effect.\\" The therapeutic effect being reduced clinical manifestations of one's mental disorder, therefore leading to less suffering. ‚ÄúECT has been shown through various research trials to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at a molecular level of the brain; however, it is thought that the sustainability of ECT is threatened due to associated stigma and poor impression of the treatment itself‚Äù. In order to decrease the associated stigma and keep the treatment available to those who need it, the evidence on the efficacy needs to be publicized.  History and controversy over ECT  = Early years = Before the 20th century, observations of the relationship between mental health and the physical body began to take place in the world of psychiatry. Between 1917 and 1934, there were developments in treating mental illnesses by physical means. Eventually by 1938, ECT was first used in Italy by neurologist Ugo Cerletti to treat schizophrenia. ECT's popularity grew after it was observed that it was safer and more effective than previous somatic treatments, and it was noted that people with depression benefited more from ECT than those with schizophrenia. = Birth of Controversy = Until the end of the 1960s, the way in which ECT was performed could be considered, for lack of a better term, shocking. \\"In these early days clients might be ‚Äòshocked‚Äô in open, communal wards of psychiatric asylums, tied to beds, without anaesthetic or muscle- relaxing agents, often several times a week. As an unfortunate consequence, many of the patients who underwent ECT felt abused, oppressed, punished and damaged, all of which had a negative impact on the treatment itself and psychiatry as a whole\\". \\"Aside from the therapy‚Äôs crude beginnings, controversy may have also been caused by a lack of information given when practitioners obtain informed consent before treatment, unknown mechanism of action, lack of knowledge about the cognitive adverse effects that can occur, divergent views of clinicians and consumers about ECT, and wide variations in official guidelines on minimal standards of ECT use\\". Essentially, the usage of ECT to treat mental disorder has been highly scrutinized by practitioners, and the general public as whole due to its controversial history in psychiatry, combined with its negative stigma in the modern world. This negative stigma in the modern world has created little importance in providing the adequate education for medical personnel at all levels, including medical student and board-certified psychiatrists. ‚ÄúIt should be standard practice for all medical students to learn the basics of ECT and for all psychiatric residents to know enough about it to refer patients for whom ECT is an appropriate treatment consideration‚Äù. The effectiveness of ECT is high compared to antidepressants and other antidepressant treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation; for this reason, clients, students, and medical professionals should be informed about the benefits and effectiveness that ECT can offer. \\"Some of the professional and popular ambivalence toward ECT is related to the fact that we still do not know exactly how it works‚Äù. The lack of awareness on the effectiveness of ECT and the poor understanding of the exact functionality behind the treatment leads others to believe that ECT is unscientific. ‚ÄúThe precise mechanism underlying the efficacy of ECT remains unclear, but one theory is that it promotes neuroplasticity by optimizing or ‚Äúresetting‚Äù existing brain networks\\". ECT is thought to be morally wrong, just like other medical procedures that bring up controversy, such as abortion. However, ‚ÄúThe best spokespeople for ECT are those patients and their family members who know from personal experience how debilitating depression can be and how effectively ECT can provide relief‚Äù. = Lack of ECT Education = \\"Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for various psychiatric disorders since its introduction, it is one of the most controversial and scrutinized therapies in psychiatry\\". Because it is highly controversial and scrutinized there is lack of importance given to educating students about ECT. \\"The negative connotations related to ECT tend to get reinforced from lack of knowledge and negative attitudes\\". With the lack of knowledge students cannot provide client's all alternatives to their entitled care. Educating students is important because they can go through their career understanding the many alternatives and they can provide patients with a knowledgeable background to support it. \\"Nurses play an essential role in ECT, because of their close involvement with patients before and after the procedure. The knowledge and attitude of the nursing staff working ECT rooms can have direct impact on the quality of their nursing practice\\". In a study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience in Rural Practice, there was a total of 183 nursing students that were surveyed on their knowledge about electroconvulsive therapy. ‚ÄúOnly about half (53.6%) of the participants were aware that ECT cannot be given against the wishes of the patients‚Äù. This result has a lot to do with the associated stigma, that patients receive ECT against their will, no treatment is given against the patients wishes. Changing this stigma can happen with knowledge that starts at school. \\"The present study shows that there are gaps in knowledge about ECT among nursing students‚Ä¶ To fill such gaps there is a need to develop more pro-ECT curriculum\\".  How the procedure works  = Candidates = Electroconvulsive therapy is effectively used in major depressive patients to \\"increase the amount of nerve cells in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is involved in mood regulation and memory. Antidepressants drugs have a similar effect but to a lesser extent than ECT\\". ECT is prescribed by a psychiatrist. Indications for ECT use were initially for schizophrenia, and those who poorly respond to medications. ECT can be used in the treatment for those with major depressive disorder, depressed bipolar disorder, manic bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, manic excitement, and catatonia. \\"Decision to conduct ECT therapy usually comes after there has been failure in other forms of treatment, including medication and psychotherapy\\". Prior to performing ECT, a set of tests are performed to ensure the patient fits the needs for ECT without further complication in their health status, that may prevent them from being eligible for treatment. Other medical screenings are performed to ensure that their depression is not caused by other medical illness because that can lead ECT to be ineffective. ‚ÄúBefore starting electroconvulsive therapy, all patients are screened for medical illnesses, for two reasons. First, a variety of medical illnesses are associated with depression or mania. The second reason for screening the patient is to establish that it is safe to proceed with ECT‚Äù. Once the patient passed those two screening, the patient then is evaluated on their medical history, physical exam, psychiatric history, mental status exam, blood count, chemistries, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram. Contraindications and risk include cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. = Procedure = Before performing ECT, clients are instructed to take nothing by mouth for 8 hours before the procedure to prevent aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs that could increase the risk of pneumonia. The client also has a secured peripheral intravenous (IV) access, blood pressure cuff around one extremity, and is connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and pulse oximetry. The ECG and EEG are used to monitor electrical currents of the induced seizure. The nurse then ensures, ‚Äúthe patient is fully informed about their illness, why ECT has been recommended for them, the treatment process initially and throughout the course, allaying fears of the patient or their family may have about ECT and directing their attention to scientific fact and evidence supporting its use‚Äù The client is then given a short-acting anesthetic, such as methohexital, and also given a muscle relaxant, such as succinylcholine. Once the determination of muscle paralysis is determined, a mild electrical current is administered to the patient's brain. Paralysis is determined by observing the extremity that the blood pressure cuff is placed on. The blood pressure is inflated to stop the effects of the muscle relaxant to a specific part of the body, allowing muscle to contract from the electrical current that is administered to the patient's brain. It is important to see the physical signs along with activity on EEG to determine the effectiveness of the procedure. ‚ÄúSmall amounts of physical movement may be seen in the face, feet, or hands. These movements are not nearly as severe as those that occurred before the advent of muscle relaxants‚Äù. After receiving ECT, ‚Äúnurses will ensure the patient‚Äôs airway is maintained, monitor observations and administer prescribed medications to counter adverse effects‚Ä¶‚Äù. After ensuring the patient is stable, the nurse would observe for normal side effects and document those side effects. ‚ÄúThere is a period of confusion and disorientation that rapidly follows the treatment; it clears quickly. With each successive treatment, the patient is left with an ongoing loss of memory which will gradually clear after the course of therapy is finished‚Äù. ‚ÄúPatients usually receive 6 to 12 treatments for full therapeutic benefit, but the number of ECT applications is titrated individually for each case‚Äù. In many cases, the client receives ECT multiple times per week and a gradual decrease in treatments once the therapeutic effect is reached and noticed by client and physician.  Contraindications and side effects of ECT  = Contraindications = ‚ÄúThere are no absolute reasons not to perform electroconvulsive therapy. There are certain conditions, however, that produce a significant increase risk with ECT‚Äù. The list of contraindications for receiving ECT is relatively short. Once the decision to undergo ECT is made collaboratively between the patient and physician, the patient is screened for any contraindications. These include a history of cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. = Side effects = The client can exhibit side effects such as nausea, headache, muscle stiffness, transient confusion, and temporary memory loss. ‚ÄúThe most disturbing and severe side effect of ECT is memory loss. It is believed that this side effect is attributable to the electricity that is passed through the brain‚Äù. ‚ÄúMost people return to reasonable function within the first month and to complete function after six months.‚Äù (Piotrowski and Guerra, 2013). These side effects are rare but commonly subside shortly after treatment. ‚ÄúFor many people, the potential for adverse events outweigh the potential benefit of the treatment, even if the end result may be remission from depression‚Äù. = ECT compared to antidepressant medications = Antidepressants are considered a first line treatment for depression. While these medications are assessable to most, and effective enough to reduce clinical manifestations and increase quality of life for many suffering from depression, they are often not effective for severe depression and they come with a large array of side effects. There are multiple types of antidepressant medications: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (NRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, all of which have a different list of unpleasant side effects. Side effects of MAOIs include tremors, insomnia, increased appetite leading to weight gain, blurred vision, urinary retention, headaches, acute hypertension and can even lead to intracranial hemorrhage when taken with food substances containing tyramine. As one could imagine, these side effects are not easy to live with, especially on top of the already crippling aspects of living with mental illnesses such as depression. ‚ÄúSide effects of SSRIs and NRIs include nausea, anorexia, insomnia, loss of libido, and when combined with MOAIs, tremors, cardiovascular collapse and hyperthermia. Aside from the aforementioned side effects, perhaps the greatest side effect of pharmacological therapy is the efficacy in general-do they actually work? In some cases, ‚Äúdepression is considered ‚Äútreatment-resistant,‚Äù meaning there is no clinical improvement in depressive symptoms after two trials of at least two antidepressants from two different classes and psychotherapy for 6‚Äì8 weeks; depression with psychotic features is considered ‚Äúrefractory‚Äù when it does not improve after one or two trials of antidepressant/antipsychotic combination‚Äù. When medication is simply not effective, ECT has been shown, through various research trials, to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at molecular level of the brain which accounts for its therapeutic effect.  Efficacy of ECT in treatment-resistant depression  As previously stated, ECT is not considered a first-line treatment for depression, but rather an intervention used when other interventions such as antidepressant medications do not help relieve one's symptoms. According to Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal, a descriptive case study conducted from April 2017 to October 2017 gathered a sample of 47 patients age 18‚Äì65 of either gender with treatment resistant depression with or without psychotic features. Each patient was prescribed ECT for treatment resistant depression when there was no clinical improvement with two trials of anti- depressants from different pharmacological groups along with psychotherapy for at least 6‚Äì8 weeks or no clinical response to one or two courses of an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination in case of psychotic symptoms. Participants in this study underwent 6 sessions (3 weeks) of ECT and were then assessed for clinical symptom improvement. ‚ÄúThe study concluded that efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression was overall high with no major difference found in efficacy with respect to variables like age, gender, and psychosis‚Äù.  Earning its place in the modern world  With the addition of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics to treat mental disorders, ECT is not widely implemented in the U.S. today, despite the research that suggests it is an effective treatment for severe depression and other mental illnesses. The negative stigma surrounding ECT, thanks to its crude beginnings in psychology along with its perhaps not so accurate portrayal in movies and television, is still alive and well. However, because the methods used to perform ECT have drastically changed since its earlier days, individuals may be more open to trying ECT to relieve their symptoms of severe mental illnesses that have not responded to first line treatment. The fears surrounding the procedure are somewhat justified considering the history, but research and new implementation of ECT by trained physicians has proven that this is a safe and effective treatment that has the potential to help many individuals. Further education in medical and nursing schools will help to further promote the implementation of ECT and help those suffering in the vicious cycle of trying to relieve the symptoms of their mental illness.

Life and career Born in Detroit, Michigan, Ludwig began early studies on violin there with Mischa Mischakoff and then attended the Juilliard School in New York with a full scholarship-graduating in violin studies with Ivan Galamian and viola studies with Paul Doktor. At the age of 22, he became music director of the New York City Symphony performing symphonic concerts at Lincoln Center. In 1978 and 1979 he served as resident conductor for Mikhail Baryshnikov and American Ballet Theatre at the Metropolitan Opera House and on tour across the United States. In 1980, Thomas Ludwig conducted the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios and recorded his Symphony in Two Movements. The New York Times described his symphony as \\"vividly orchestrated, possesses tremendous emotional intensity, and yet is succinct and skillful in its control of form\\". In 1982 Ludwig's symphony Age of Victory was premiered at the Inter-American Music Festival at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and was referred to as \\"Ludwig's Eloquent 'Victory'\\" by The Washington Post.

For example, it is required that the set of products of elements in the subset be not much bigger than the subset itself (while for a subgroup it is required that they be equal). The notion was introduced in the 2010s but can be traced to older sources in additive combinatorics.  Formal definition  Let G be a group and K \\\\ge 1; for two subsets X, Y \\\\subset G we denote by X\\\\cdot Y the set of all products xy, x\\\\in X, y\\\\in Y. A non-empty subset A \\\\subset G is a K-approximate subgroup of G if: # It is symmetric, that is if g \\\\in A then g^{-1} \\\\in A; # There exists a subset X \\\\subset G of cardinality X \\\\le K such that A \\\\cdot A \\\\subset X\\\\cdot A. It is immediately verified that a 1-approximate subgroup is the same thing as a genuine subgroup. Of course this definition is only interesting when K is small compared to A (in particular, any subset B \\\\subset G is a B-approximate subgroup). In applications it is often used with K being fixed and A going to infinity. Examples of approximate subgroups which are not groups are given by symmetric intervals and more generally arithmetic progressions in the integers. Indeed, for all n \\\\ge 1 the subset X = [-N, N] \\\\subset \\\\mathbb Z is a 2-approximate subgroup: the set X + X = [-2N, 2N] is contained in the union of the two translates X + N and X - N of X. A generalised arithmetic progression in \\\\mathbb Z is a subset in \\\\mathbb Z of the form \\\\\\\\{n_1x_1 + \\\\cdots + n_dx_d : n_i \\\\le N_i\\\\\\\\}, and it is a 2^d-approximate subgroup. A more general example is given by balls in the word metric in finitely generated nilpotent groups.  Classification of approximate subgroups  Approximate subgroups of the integer group \\\\mathbb Z were completely classified by Imre Z. Ruzsa and Freiman. The result is stated as follows: :For any K \\\\ge 1 there are C_K, c_K > 0 such that for any K-approximate subgroup A \\\\subset \\\\mathbb Z there exists a generalised arithmetic progression P generated by at most C_K integers and containing at least c_KA elements, such that A+A+A+A \\\\supset P. The constants C_K, C_K', c_K can be estimated sharply. In particular A is contained in at most C_K'translates of P: this means that approximate subgroups of \\\\mathbb Z are \\"almost\\" generalised arithmetic progressions. The work of Breuillard-Green-Tao (the culmination of an effort started a few years earlier by various other people) is a vast generalisation of this result. In a very general form its statement is the following: :Let K \\\\ge 1; there exists C_K such that the following holds. Let G be a group and A a K-approximate subgroup in G. There exists subgroups H \\\\triangleleft G_0 \\\\le G with H finite and G_0/H nilpotent such that A^4 \\\\supset H, the subgroup generated by A^4 contains G_0, and A \\\\subset X\\\\cdot G_0 with X \\\\le C_K. The statement also gives some information on the characteristics (rank and step) of the nilpotent group G_0/H. In the case where G is a finite matrix group the results can be made more precise, for instance: :Let K \\\\ge 1. For any d there is a constant C_d such that for any finite field \\\\mathbb F_q, any simple subgroup G \\\\subset \\\\mathrm{GL}_d(\\\\mathbb F_q) and any K-approximate subgroup A \\\\subset G then either A is contained in a proper subgroup of G, or A \\\\le K^{C_d}, or A \\\\ge G/K^{C_d}. The theorem applies for example to \\\\mathrm{SL}_d(\\\\mathbb F_q); the point is that the constant does not depend on the cardinality q of the field. In some sense this says that there are no interesting approximate subgroups (besides genuine subgroups) in finite simple linear groups (they are either \\"trivial\\", that is very small, or \\"not proper\\", that is almost equal to the whole group).  Applications  The Breuillard-Green-Tao theorem on classification of approximate groups can be used to give a new proof of Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth. The result obtained is actually a bit stronger since it establishes that there exists a \\"growth gap\\" between virtually nilpotent groups (of polynomial growth) and other groups; that is, there exists a (superpolynomial) function f such that any group with growth function bounded by a multiple of f is virtually nilpotent. Other applications are to the construction of expander graphs from the Cayley graphs of finite simple groups, and to the related topic of superstrong approximation.

As a two-year-old in 1989 he was one of the best colts of his generation in Europe winning four of his five races including the biggest races for juveniles in Ireland (the National Stakes) and England (the Dewhurst Stakes). In the following year he showed modesrate form in England in spring but went on to win the Prix Eug√®ne Adam in France and the Gran Premio d'Italia in Milan. Background Dashing Blade was a bay horse with a narrow white blaze and three white socks bred by his owner, Jeff Smith's Littleton Stud. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Elegant Air whose wins included the Horris Hill Stakes, Westbury Stakes and Tattersalls Gold Cup. He made a promising start to his stud career but dies in 1990 at the age of nine. Dashing Blade's dam Sharp Castan won one of her seven races and finished third in the 1979 Fillies' Mile. Dashing Blade was trained throughout his racing career by Ian Balding at Kingsclere in Hampshire and was ridden in all but two of his races by John Matthias. Like many of Balding's trainees, she usually raced in a white sheepskin noseband. Dashing Blade was not an easy horse to train: before he appeared in a race he broke loose on the gallops, jumped a gate and ran free for several miles before being recovered. Racing career =1989: two-year-old season= Dashing Blade made his racecourse debut in the six furlong Berkshire Maiden Stakes on 14 June at Newbury Racecourse. Starting the 6/5 favourite he took the lead a furlong out and won by three lengths from Osario. Two weeks later, in a minor race at Salisbury Racecourse the colt started at odds of 1/6 and won \\"comfortably\\" by four lengths from Star Hill. Dashing Blade was then moved up in class and distance for the Group Three Vintage Stakes over seven furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was matched against the undefeated favourite Be My Chief. Starting at odds of 5/2 he tracked the favourite but was unable to quicken in the straight and finished third of the five runners. Despite his defeat at Goodwood the colt was moved up in class again as he was sent to Ireland to contest the Group One National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 9 September. Book The Band (runner-up in the Gimcrack Stakes) started favourite with Dashing Blade next in the betting on 3/1. The other eight runners included Go And Go, Missionary Ridge (later to win the Gallinule Stakes) and the filly Wedding Bouquet (third in the Phoenix Stakes). After tracking the outsider Smokey Native, Dashing Blade went to the front approaching the final furlong and came out best in a closely contested finish, beating Wedding Bouquet by three quarters of a length with Book The Band and Pictorial just behind in third and fourth. Dashing Blade returned to England to contest Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 20 October. The Vincent O'Brien-trained Royal Academy ahead of the Mill Reef Stakes winner Welney and the Michael Stoute-trained Cordoba (third in the Middle Park Stakes). Dashing Blade was next in the betting on 8/1 whilst the other three runners were Cullinan and Anshan (second and third in the Cartier Million sales race) and the 66/1 outsider Call To Arms. Dashing Blade was amongst the leaders from the start and went to the front in the last quarter mile. He was driven out by Matthias in the final furlong and won by a neck and a short head from Call To Arms and Anshan. Ian Balding commented \\"I always thought Dashing Blade would be better as a three- year-old. He was very spooky and nervous earlier this season but has settled down well\\". =1990: three-year-old season= Dashing Blade's training was disrupted by injury in the early part of 1990. On his three-year-old debut he started a 25/1 outsider for the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket on 5 May and finished twelfth of the fourteen runners behind Tirol. On his next appearance at Royal Ascot on 19 June, the colt started the 10/1 fourth choice in the betting and finished fourth of the eight runners behind Shavian. Four weeks later the colt was sent to France and moved up in distance for the Prix Eug√®ne Adam over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse in which his opponents included Starstreak and Elytis who had finished second and third in the Prix La Force. After racing in second place, Dashing Blade took the lead 800 metres from the finish and won by three lengths from the Andr√© Fabre- trained Verre Bleu. Two weeks after his win in France, Dashing Blade was sent to Germany Bayerisches Zuchtrennen in Munich. He stayed on strongly in the closing stages but was beaten a length by the locally trained four-year-old Turfkonig. Ray Cochrane took over from Matthias when the colt returned to England for the International Stakes at York Racecourse on 21 August. After pulling hard in the early stages he took the lead in the straight but faded quickly in the last quarter mile to finish last of the nine runners behind In The Groove. On 22 September Dashing Blade was sent to Italy for the Group One Gran Premio d'Italia over 2400 metres in Milan in which he was ridden by Brian Rouse. He started second favourite behind Houmayoun who had won the Italian Derby in May. The race took a bizarre twist at half way when Houmayoun's pacemaker Trojancar took the wrong course and had to be pulled up. Dashing Blade took the lead in the straight and drew away from his rivals to win \\"comfortably\\" by six lengths from Bold Passion. Jeff Smith was reportedly keen to run the colt in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe but Dashing Blade's racing career was ended by a tendon injury and he was retired at the end of the season. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Dashing Blade was retired to become a breeding stallion and spent most of his stud career in Germany. The best of his offspring included Proudwings (Falmouth Stakes), Lord of England (Bayerishes Zuchtrennen), Faberger (Premio Vittorio di Capua), Soave (B√©nazet-Rennen), Sirius (Grosser Preis von Berlin) and Moon Over Miami (November Novices' Chase). He was also the broodmare sire of Stacelita. Dashing Blade was pensioned from stud duty in 2013 at the age of 26 due to the effects of old age and arthritis. He was euthanised in August 2013 at the Gestut Etzean after developing neurological problems.

Griffith's Valuation (mid-19th century) mentions three families on the island: Skelly, Connell and Heffernan; the island was owned by Susan Galbraith. In the 1911 census, there were 13 people living on the island, of the same 3 families. In winter 2009, the Irish Air Corps sent a helicopter to the island to deliver cattle fodder for the last farmer on the island, John Connell, after Lough Ree froze solid.

After the death of their mother, the children were sent to Yasmar home for infants at Haberfield and later fostered to siblings Bill and Stella Woodbury at their farm near Spencer on the Hawkesbury River. In 1935 officials separated Monica and Dan, who never saw each other again. Monica was then schooled at Strathfield, and was trained in domestic work. After many years working for Sydney suburban families, Clare was released from being a ward of the state in August 1942. She then worked in factories such as W. D. & H. O. Wills (Australia) Ltd's cigarette factory. Career and activism Clare became involved in race relations and Labor politics, after meeting the Aboriginal community at Bellwood reserve in north coast of New South Wales.

It is one of the largest auction companies in the world. Royal FloraHolland is headquartered in Aalsmeer, with locations in Naaldwijk, Rijnsburg and Eelde. Company FloraHolland is a non-profit organization which is a result of a merger between FloraHolland and Aalsmeer Flower Auction in 2007. History by location =Aalsmeer= In response to the increased power of brokering, flower growers in Aalsmeer joined forces. The auction in Bloemenlust was founded in late December 1911 \\"the auction of export flowers will take place in Caf√© Welcome\\". In addition, the Central Aalsmeer Auction was launched on January 5, 1912. Five days later in the pub Three Columns the first flowers appeared at the clock. Both auctions saw their sales grow annually. In 1918 the Central Aalsmeer Auction achieved, for the first tine, annual sales of 1 million guilders. FloraHolland location in Aalsmeer. FloraHolland Aalsmeer assembly hall. FloraHolland Aalsmeer auction room. With flower and plant exports booming the industry desperately needed to expand to a new auction complex with ample space. Against this background it was decided to merge the auctions of Bloemenlust and Central Aalsmeer Auction. The merger took effect on March 6, 1968. The organization continued as: Aalsmeer Flower Auction (Verenigde Bloemenveiling Aalsmeer or V.B.A.:United Flower Auction Aalsmeer) In 1972 a new auction complex at Legmeerdijk came into use. The complex covered an area of nine hectares. Further expansion followed and in 1999 the Aalsmeer Flower Auction and its customers took the first parts of the VBA South into use. This is located on the other side of the provincial road N231. Seven years later the first known plans for VBA Oost were drawn up. VBA Oost has a size of 36 hectares. Construction started in 2009. The main auction building was constructed in 2007 and covers an area of approximately 860,000 sqm and is the largest indoor market building in the world. Other important milestones were in 1973, when the VBA allowed suppliers to market their products through an agency and 2006 when international membership was introduced. The first auction in the world Aalsmeer Flower Auction opened membership to international members; companies located in countries outside the EU (companies from EU member states were already allowed to be members). After a short time there were approximately one hundred international members. =Naaldwijk= On March 2, 1923 was founded the Central Westland Cut Association (C.W.S.). Revenue in the first auction day was fl. 304.59. The C.W.S. rented a building in Poeldijk. In 1923 there were about 75 growers member of the auction. It was auctioned in a single clock. FloraHolland location in Naaldwijk. FloraHolland Naaldwijk assembly hall. On March 30, 1931 has decided the auction association into a cooperative. From that moment the auction is named Cooperative Central Westlandsche Cut Association (C.C.W.S.). It was decided to establish the auction to the Dijkweg in Honselersdijk, where the Naaldwijk is still. In 1971, a small amount of foreign flowers were sold for the first time on the clock. In 1976, the bells were number seven and eight in use for the auctioning of potted plants. This came to an end the auctioning of flowers and plants on the same clock. In 1983 the name changed again, this time in C.C.W.S. Flower in Westland. The auction is still in Honselersdijk, formerly a core in the municipality of Naaldwijk (today part of Westland). The name Naaldwijk has so far not changed Establishment Westland. =Rijnsburg= In 1914, seventeen growers Flower Flora established in Rijnsburg. In the beginning it was auctioned in the local pub. Only became a real auction building inaugurated in Rijnsburg in 1917. Bulb flowers and especially tulips and lilies were for Flower Auction from its inception important products. other flowers were auctioned from about 1927. In 1980, the new auction complex was put into operation just outside Katwijk on the municipal boundary with Oegstgeest. Since the merger is achieved most sales in the Rijnsburgse establishment of bulbous flowers, also in comparison with the other branches. =Bleiswijk= In 1928 from the 'Rotterdamsche Vegetable Auction' except vegetables for the first time auctioned flowers. A year later built a separate auction in Berkel for the auction of flowers and the name was changed to Cooperative Fruit and Flower Berkel en Rodenrijs. In 1973 merged the vegetable department with Tuinbouwveiling in Rotterdam. Auctioning of flowers continued under the name Flower Berkel and Environs. In 1982, the auction building was moved to the Klappolder in Bleiswijk. In 2014, this auction has been closed, the auction operations have been moved to Naaldwijk. The facility is maintained as a logistics center. =Venlo= In 1915 the Cooperative Auction-Vereeniging (CVV) in Blerick. At that time there were auctioned only fruits and vegetables. From 1916 there were eggs in. Selling flowers through the CVV began in 1962 when a grower of Chrysanthemums are reported at the auction. His flowers were auctioned at the vegetable clock, as there was no clock for flowers. Later went many growers instead of vegetables, grow flowers. For example, a flower was born. After a year as many flowers already were auctioned on CVV, there was built a separate Bloemenhal in Grubbenvorst. This is the place where Venlo location is still located. The new auction complex was opened in 1965. On April 30, 1969 the building was destroyed by fire and the sale was to go into a Groentehal. A few years later, they again built its own Bloemenhal. After several mergers, the auction CVV finally went in 1991 with the Cooperative Venlo Vegetable Auction. They continued under the name Cooperative Auction Southeast Netherlands (abbreviated auction ZON). On July 1, 2002 closed the floral part of auction ZON themselves with FloraHolland. =Eelde= In 1927, the first flowers were auctioned in the north of the country, in the city of Groningen.

It was founded by psychologist Margaret Klein Salamon to confront climate change denial and build the political will necessary to achieve the rapid and just transformation of the physical economy and society at large, delivering an integrated package of solutions for a regenerative, zero emissions and safe-climate economy, geared toward reversing global warming and the 6th mass extinction of species as rapidly as possible. History Since at least 2008, public figures like environmental analyst Lester Brown, former vice president Al Gore, author and energy expert Joseph J. Romm, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, writer Naomi Klein, and climate activist Bill McKibben have called for governmental climate action on the scale of the World War II mobilization to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2011, the heads of leading environmental organizations including 350.org, Sierra Club, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and Rainforest Action Network signed a letter to Presidents Barack Obama and Hu Jintao calling for a \\"wartime-like mobilization\\" by the governments of the United States and China to cut carbon emissions 80% (based on 2006 levels) by 2020. However, environmental groups in the United States never organized politically for such an ambitious goal. The Climate Mobilization was launched in September 2014, before the People's Climate March in New York City, specifically to organize politically around the concept of a rapid, World War II-scale government mobilization against climate change. Margaret Klein Salamon, Ezra Silk and allies developed a pledge-based movement-building strategy in which signers agree to vote for political candidates who have signed the pledge over those who have not. The Climate Mobilization‚Äôs \\"Pledge to Mobilize\\" calls on the United States government to commence a World War II-scale mobilization against climate change in order to decrease net greenhouse gas emissions 100% by 2025, deploy a system of removing greenhouse gases (GHG) from the atmosphere with wartime speed, and make reducing net GHGs 100% globally, with the same swiftness, a top political priority. Throughout 2015, citizen activists in California, Iowa and elsewhere in the U.S. began rallying for World War II-scale national climate mobilization, and spreading the Climate Mobilization pledge to local political candidates. In January 2016, The Climate Mobilization sponsored a \\"Climate Emergency Caucus\\" in Des Moines before the Iowa caucuses, which simulated the state's 2016 Democratic presidential primary caucus. Former U.S. Senator Tom Harkin spoke on behalf of candidate Hillary Clinton, and climate advocates Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Nebraska, and Iowa politician and radio host Ed Fallon spoke on behalf of candidate Bernie Sanders. Sanders won 67% of the vote, reinforcing the perception that voters highly concerned about climate change strongly preferred Sanders over Clinton, and that climate voters were a key voting bloc contributing to his competitiveness in Iowa and later primary states. Throughout his presidential campaign, Bernie Sanders discussed fighting climate change \\"in military terms\\", saying at one point during a debate against Hillary Clinton that \\"if we approach this as if we were at war\\", the U.S. could be up to the challenge, as it was during World War II. In April 2016, The Climate Mobilization organized a \\"die-in\\" outside the United Nations building in New York City during the signing of the COP 21 Paris Agreement, meant to protest what the group called the agreement's inadequacy in relation to the scale of the threat of climate change. TCM deputy director Ezra Silk called the agreement \\"historic in the sense that the Munich Agreement was historic ‚Äî a catastrophic act of appeasement meant to maintain business-as-usual arrangements.\\" He explained: \\"It's widely recognized that this agreement is not even close to what is needed... It doesn't really convey a sense of urgency [so] we wanted to sort of inject some reality into the discussion. We need to go on to an emergency war footing like right now[...] The climate is already dangerous, we're already in an emergency. It is understood within the climate movement that this is the kind of approach that is needed. It's just considered politically unrealistic. Our goal is to change the political possibility.‚Äù In July 2016, the national platform committee of the Democratic Party of the United States approved an amendment submitted by Climate Mobilization activist Russell Greene committing the party to a World War II-scale international mobilization against climate change: \\"We believe the United States must lead in forging a robust global solution to the climate crisis. We are committed to a national mobilization, and to leading a global effort to mobilize nations to address this threat on a scale not seen since World War II. In the first 100 days of the next administration, the President will convene a summit of the world‚Äôs best engineers, climate scientists, policy experts, activists, and indigenous communities to chart a course to solve the climate crisis.\\" Politicians who have signed the Climate Mobilization pledge include San Luis Obispo mayor Heidi Harmon, Des Moines mayor Frank Cownie; Iowa State Rep. Dan Kelley; Iowa State Senator and U.S. Senate candidate Rob Hogg; New York State Senate candidate Debbie Medina; and U.S. congressional candidates Peter Jacob of New Jersey, and Tim Canova, Darren Soto, and Alina Valdes of Florida.

Early life  Zenas Sanford Loftis was born in Gainesboro, Tennessee as the son of James H. Loftis and Nancy Eveline Loftis. The Loftis family moved onto a farm in rural Kansas when Loftis was seven years of age and later moved to central Texas where Zenas developed his skills in photography and the printer's trade. In 1894 Loftis became a Christian and soon after began his involvement in his local church. When Loftis was 18, his father died from health complications with paralysis. He entered Vanderbilt University a year later in the Department of Pharmacy and graduated in 1901 while winning the prestigious Founders' medal.  Missionary work  = Calling = Loftis's calling to the life of a medical missionary came about in St. Louis while performing slum mission work and teaching Chinese Sunday-school. He was inspired by the work of Susanna Carson Rijnhart whose husband and child died while on an expedition in Tibet. In response to this calling, Loftis moved to Nashville, Tennessee to earn a medical degree within Vanderbilt University's Department of Medicine. Throughout his studies, Loftis prayed to God \\"that he might be sent to the most difficult and needy field in all the world\\" and \\"wanted to go where no one else was willing to go.\\" In 1906, Loftis was sent by Vanderbilt University to the Southern Student's Y.M.C.A conference in Asheville, North Carolina where Loftis first heard of plans to establish a mission in Batang. = Appointment = In 1903, Dr. Susanna Carson Rijnhart, Dr. Albert Shelton, and his wife, Flora Shelton, were sent by the Foreign Christian Missionary Society (FCMS) to open a mission in Tibet. However, in 1907 Rijnhart departed due to health problems. After learning of Rijnhart's departure from the mission on the border of Tibet, Loftis applied for and was appointed to the mission in Batang by the FCMS in January 1908. = Journey = 198x198pxLoftis's route from the United States to Tibet required that he make stops at San Francisco, Honolulu, Yokohama, Nagasaki, Shanghai, and Nanjing. After reaching Nanjing, Loftis had to travel up the Yangtze River, pass through Hankou, Yichang, Chungking, Luchau, Kiating, Tachienlu, and Litang to reach Batang. He boarded the SS Mongolia on September 15, 1908 and left the United States, never to return. He wrote in his diary that he felt \\"no sorrow in [his] heart\\" as the country held \\"all that was dear to [him] except [his] work.  Experience of Chinese and Tibetan culture  As he traveled through China and eastern Tibet, Loftis recorded his observations of the cultural landscape, providing context to many of the customs and historical landmarks that he encountered. On the way to Nanjing, he described the \\"thousands of graves\\" that covered the fields and detailed the cultural and historical context behind the \\"great stone statues\\" that lay along the road that he traveled. Along the Yangtze River, Loftis observed an \\"artificial cave\\" home to an ancient \\"aboriginal race\\" and entered one of them, concluding that they were \\"the first dwellings\\" of Tibetan ancestors. He also recorded histories of the Purple Mountain, Omei Shan, and a bridge that hovered over the Tong River. Loftis in a coracle Loftis said that the religious icons of the Tibetan people were numerous, and described \\"shrines with many prayer wheels and idols.\\" He listened to the \\"chanting prayers of lamas\\" and looked at \\"devout Tibetans\\" whirling \\"prayer drums ... thus offering millions of prayers in one second.\\" Loftis stumbled upon one prayer drum with \\"some half million or more written mani prayers.\\" Loftis was a harsh critic of the Tibetan people's Buddhist traditions. He wrote, \\"It struck chills to my heart when I saw these deluded wretches groping so blindly in the dark for help from a higher power.\\" Loftis visited the large Litang monastery and its Holy Temple. He interacted with an abbot in Litang who was said to be \\"a Living Buddha\\" and from whom Loftis learned about the Kangyur. Loftis also highlighted the major health hazards found throughout the country. He stated in his diary that they did not \\"know what a sewer is, so everything that is waste [was] thrown into the streets.\\" He described a Chinese as having \\"four verminous beds\\" with \\"inevitable foul smelling pits of human refuse. Conditions were similar in Tibet where Loftis encountered inns that were \\"dirty and foul beyond belief.\\" Along the Yalong River, he described an inn which had \\"cracks in the walls\\" that were \\"filled with their eggs and larva\\" in addition to the presence of \\"bedbugs, fleas, and lice.\\" Loftis also criticized the \\"superstitious\\" nature of the Chinese. One night \\"they make a lot of noise with drums and gongs all night to keep the devils off.\\" As he was traveling up the Yangtze River, he writes that the \\"Chinese believe the river to be infested with devils.\\" Loftis characterized himself as a \\"foreign devil\\" as a crowd was staring as he ate his food with \\"knives and forks.\\"  Healthcare  Loftis visited the Christian missions that he passed by on the way to the Batang mission, and wrote about their progress and conditions. He noted that many of the stations were \\"terribly undermanned\\" and regretted that \\"he could not multiply himself into a hundred\\" to aid the missions. He also treated patients along the way to Batang. On the road, he treated a man who attempted to commit an opium suicide and was received with \\"profuse thanks\\" for his work. While traveling up the Yangtze River, he diagnosed and remedied a case of malaria, allowing him the opportunity to \\"make a demonstration of the power of foreign medicine.\\" In Yachow, he treated a case of opium in a young girl. Near one of the Tibetan villages, he alleviated the pain of a \\"contused and swollen\\" sclera conjunctiva.\\" In Tachienlu, he performed an amputation on part of a finger. Batang = Batang mission = Loftis reached the Batang mission on June 17, 1909, after a journey of ten months from his home in the United States to Batang. He was welcomed at the mission by Dr. Albert Shelton and James Ogden and their wives. Albert Shelton left the responsibility of the mission's dispensary to Loftis while Shelton and Ogden were on an extended trip south of Batang. Loftis treated patients around the area in whatever capacity was needed including attending to dislocations, opium overdose, tuberculosis, skin lacerations, pediatrics, and smallpox. Loftis noted that the Tibetan people \\"knew nothing about dislocations,\\" and a man with a dislocated shoulder whom Loftis had treated \\"praised the skill of the foreign doctor.\\" He treated \\"between five and six hundred people.\\"  Death  234x234pxNot long after Loftis's arrival at the Batang mission, he told his colleagues that he was not feeling well. Dr. Albert Shelton noted that Loftis had attended to two patients with smallpox and suspected that Loftis may have caught the disease. Although Loftis was vaccinated, his condition gradually worsened. Shelton observed that his smallpox \\"was raging everywhere.\\" Loftis inherited Typhus fever while battling smallpox, which only exacerbated his condition. Unable to obtain a vaccine, Shelton isolated himself with his colleague until Loftis perished at the age of 28 at four o' clock one afternoon. Loftis was buried next to the grave of William Soutter, a Christian missionary. Loftis's grave faces the road to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. Engraved on his grave is the quote, \\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" In addition, the third stanza from the poem Break, Break, Break by Alfred, Lord Tennyson is written in English, Tibetan, and Chinese on Loftis's tomb.  Legacy  The other missionaries in Batang named Loftis Memorial Hospital in his honor. Dr. William M. Hardy replaced Loftis, and more missionaries followed over the next 20 years. In 1932, the missionaries abandoned Batang due to tensions and violence between Tibet and China, a lack of funds, and internal dissention in the mission. When Loftis reached Sanba en route to the Batang mission, he came across the grave of the Christian Missionary William Soutter. After seeing the grave, Loftis wrote in his diary, \\"O my Master, if it is Thy will that I fill a lonely grave in this land, may it be one that will be a landmark, and an inspiration to others, and may I go to do it willingly, if it is Thy will.\\" His desires manifested themselves postmortem as the Foreign Christian Missionary and other organizations used Loftis's story in their published literature to recruit medical missionaries. His observations of China and Tibet were a contribution to the knowledge of the western world about a remote region.

Hayes, a native of Raheny, Ireland, one of few early female medical graduates from Ireland in 1904, became a medical missionary and chief of Rewari Hospital in India part of the Cambridge Mission to Delhi.\\"Mission Statement: Heroic Sacrifice.\\" 100ofUs, http://www.100ofus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/100-of-Us-Mission- Statement.pdf. Accessed 30 Oct. 2016. Hayes died unexpectedly from a pneumonia in 1908. Known for her work, passion, and character, a ward was built in her name in St Stephen's Hospital, Delhi.  Early life  Marie Elizabeth Hayes was born on May 17, 1874 in Glebe House, Raheny, Dublin, Ireland. She was the oldest daughter of Reverend Canon F.C. Hayes and his wife Annabella Wilson. Marie‚Äôs father was a Rector at Raheny Parish beginning in 1873 and her mother founded the Mothers‚Äô Union in Ireland to promote the well-being of families. Her parent‚Äôs devotion to helping the less fortunate was passed along to Marie. Young Marie was guarded, but had a clear interest in missionary work and expressed this interest to her parents and her brother early on in her life.  Education  Marie started working towards her medical degree in 1897 at Alexandra College in Dublin, Ireland. She continued her education at Catholic University School of Medicine, which was associated with Royal University. Because gender exclusion in higher education, Catholic University was her only option in receiving a medical degree. At Catholic University she achieved \\"high status\\" with a silver medal in surgery, pathology, and obstetrics. She was one of few female students to achieve this status. She completed a residency in Coombe Hospital, Dublin. She was then invited to return to Coombe as a clerk based on her impact as a resident. She later received a 6-month residency in Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, one of the few hospitals that accepted female residents. She was one of only five female candidates to pass the final degree examination in May, 1904 and was the only female student to obtain an ‚ÄúUpper Pass.‚Äù She was conferred with MB BCh BAO degrees. After obtaining her degree, in preparation for missionary service in India, she returned to school at the London School of Tropical Medicine for 3 months, completed a temporary residency in the S.P.G. missionary hostel in Wandsworth, and studied Urdu. After finishing her studies, Dr. Hayes worked as a locum tenens in the Belfast Infirmary for a few months before beginning her mission in India.  Call to missionary service  Marie's missionary call was attributed to the role her father's and mother's religious service played in her life. Her mother reported Marie first expressed interest in missionary work in 1887, at 13 years old, and never lost her compulsion for service. Her motive in obtaining her medical degree was that so she could become a medical missionary. She worked her entire life to serve the Mission. When she was home in Ireland, Marie was a dedicated member of the active laity at All Saints Church in Raheny. Her mother and father were also active members of the church. In India, Dr. Hayes continued to preach as a member of a Christian Mission.  Missionary service  In 1905, Dr. Hayes started her journey to her first mission post at Cambridge Mission to Delhi, India. She was accepted into the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (S.P.G.) in January of that year. As soon as Dr. Hayes arrived in Punjab, India, her services were essential and her workload was intense due to understaffing in the hospital. The mission was composed of 3 major hospitals. The first and largest hospital of the mission, St. Stephen‚Äôs Hospital in Delhi, was opened in 1885. This was the first mission hospital for women and children in Delhi. Dr. Hayes worked under Jenny Muller who was the first full-time doctor at this hospital. 70 miles north of Delhi, the mission had its second hospital in the city of Karnal. 70 miles southwest of Delhi, the mission had its third hospital in Rewari. Dr. Hayes eventually led the Rewari Hospital. St. Stephen‚Äôs Hospital was rebuilt in its present site in Tis Hazari, Old Delhi beginning in December 1906. Dr. Hayes spent 26 months in India working for the Mission before an early death. However, her short period of service was described as \\"impactful\\".  Death  Dr. Hayes died at the age of 33.\\"Missions and Missionaries around the World, 1611-1922.\\" http://www.ebscohost.com/titleLists/h8c-coverage.pdf She had contracted pneumonia at Christmas in 1907 and returned to Delhi on New Year‚Äôs Day for a celebration. The persistent infection led to death on Saturday January 3, 1908. Her funeral service was held at St. Stephen‚Äôs Church in Delhi and her burial service was held at Indian Christian Cemetery. When word of her death got to her home in Ireland, a memorial service was held at All Saints' Church, Raheny, on January 6, 1908.  Legacy and impression  The \\"Marie Hayes\\" Ward in St. Stephen's Hospital in Delhi, India. Created in memorial of Marie Elizabeth Hayes. Dr. Hayes was known for a significant impact on the mission and for paving the way for many women who wished to pursue medical degrees and residencies. After her death, a memorial fund was established in her name in Dublin. Contributions for the fund came from friends, family, and coworkers living in Dublin, England, and India. This fund was used to finance the construction of a ward in the new St. Stephen‚Äôs Hospital in Delhi. This ward was named ‚ÄúThe Marie Hayes Ward‚Äù for her service to the hospital in Delhi. She is additionally recognized in the hospital chapel with memorial brass name plate and separately a prayer desk inscribed with the words (in Urdu): ‚ÄúFor the service of God in prayer and in memory of Dr. Marie Hayes and what work she did. Placed here by nurses of Delhi, Karnal and Rewari. Year of Jesus, 1908.‚Äù In her home village of Raheny, a memorial Celtic cross was built. The engraved cross currently stands beside St. Assam‚Äôs Church and graveyard in the center of the village. Dr. Haye‚Äôs impact was recognized by Jenny Muller at St. Stephen‚Äôs and Rev. S. S. Allnutt, Head of Cambridge Delhi Mission for her work, spirit, and devotion to God. Rev. S.S. Allnutt wrote an introduction to At Work : Letters of Marie Elizabeth Hayes when her mother chose to publish it. He spoke very highly her character and contribution to the mission. After Marie‚Äôs death, her mother decided to compile and publish all the letters that Marie had sent home during her work on the Cambridge Mission to Delhi. Published as At Work: Letters of Marie Elizabeth Hayes, her mother hoped these letters would inspire others to continue Marie's work.

Despite her physical handicap, she finished at the top of her class at St. John's University in ShanghaiFulcher, Page 178.  Background  = Childhood: A Foundation in Missions = Mary Elizabeth McCracken was born on February 2, 1911, in Canton, China where her parents were stationed as medical missionaries. Mary Elizabeth was the third of eight children. She had five sisters (Helen McCracken Fulcher, Margaret McCracken, Martha Constance McCracken Howard, Elsie McCracken, and Ruth McCracken) and two brothers (Josiah C. McCracken and Stewart McCracken).Fulcher, Page 23 At the young age of thirteen months, Mary Elizabeth was afflicted with infantile paralysis. She could not walk and constantly needed to be carried everywhere. Since Mary Elizabeth's mother graduated with a degree in physical education from Columbia University, Mary Elizabeth's mother persistently cared for her and sought to make her life as normal as possible. As a child, Mary Elizabeth enjoyed music and sang with her family. She knew how to play piano, as all the children in her family were taught by their mother.Fulcher, Page 37 As a child, she enjoyed playing with Kewpie dolls and creating paper doll families with her older sisters. Though she faced many challenges due to her condition, Mary Elizabeth was always a good sport. In sports events requiring physical movement, she could not play with her siblings but instead took on the role of the timekeeper.Fulcher, Page 66 = Education: A Cosmopolitan Journey in Schooling = In the Fall of 1916, Mary Elizabeth began school at the Shanghai American School,Fulcher, Page 36 a private school that was two to three blocks away from the family's residence at 8 Darroch RoadFulcher, Page 38 in Shanghai. She was pulled everyday to school in a long wagon by her mother. As Mary Elizabeth had to be carried to class and recess, her mother often had to be present to perform such a duty. After the family moved to the United States in 1920, it was a challenge to find a school for Mary Elizabeth to attend. Only when a druggist from the neighborhood allowed an employee to carry Mary Elizabeth was she able to finally attend a school.Fulcher, Page 39 Eventually, in 1924, she went to the Watson Home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for both treatment and schooling. She stayed there until she completed high school.Fulcher, Page 51 In the Fall of 1927, Mary Elizabeth followed in her older sister Helen McCracken Fulcher's footsteps and attended Lake Erie College.Fulcher, Page 101 She roomed with Helen the first year and her other sister Margaret for the following two years. Her sisters helped wheelchair and carry her during these times. The college faculty was very interested in Mary Elizabeth and her attitude towards learning. Mary Elizabeth developed a liking for history, learned how to swim, and joined archery during college. After graduating from Lake Erie College, Mary Elizabeth went on to study at the University of Pennsylvania. She studied biology and received her Master of Arts in Anatomy.Fulcher, Page 201 As she told her father Josiah Calvin McCracken she was interested in attending medical school,McCracken, Dr. Josiah Calvin. \\"Merry Christmas.\\" Letter to McCracken Supporters. 26 Nov. 1936. MS. Shanghai, China. her father invited her to study under him in China. She ended up attending Women's Christian Medical College in Shanghai.Fulcher, Page 121 She did so well in anatomy that the second year she was at the school she taught the subject herself. She later transferred to St. John's University,Fulcher, Page 154 continuing to teach anatomy. She completed a year of internship at the Refugee Hospital and then received her graduation diploma at the head of her class in 1939. = Treatments: A Lifetime Battle = Mary Elizabeth struggled against infantile paralysis all of her life. With a physician as a father and physical therapist as a mother, Mary Elizabeth was not left alone to tackle this disease. Her entire family including her brothers and sisters took part in helping Mary Elizabeth move from place to place. During college at Lake Erie College, her older sisters Helen and Margaret carried her throughout the day across campus to her classes. Initially after Mary Elizabeth was struck with this disease, her mother did her best to treat her but this was not enough. Reaching out to his friend, Mary Elizabeth's father sought out consultation from Dr. Abraham FlexnerFulcher, Page 35 in 1915. In 1916, Mary Elizabeth and her father traveled to Boston so she could receive care to straighten her back. In February 1919, Mary Elizabeth began to go to the Red Cross Hospital in Shanghai to receive electrical treatments three times per week. She had to be brought home early to rest before every treatment, thus, she had to leave school early for each treatment.Fulcher, Page 44 Though Mary Elizabeth broke her leg in December 1919, she still persisted in attending school in her cast. In February 1921, the family made the hard decision to send Mary Elizabeth to the Watson Home for crippled children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to receive care under Dr. David Silvers. This is where she ended up for her entire high school career. Though the family returned to Shanghai on June 23, 1921, Mary wasn‚Äôt able to improve in Shanghai and made the decision to return in the Summer of 1923 to the Watson Home. In 1934, Mary Elizabeth attended medical school and was able to use her own rickshaw and coolie.Fulcher, Page 125 This allowed for greater independence for her as she went to school and made new friends. Being the ‚Äúindomitable Mary,‚Äù she was an independent person, never letting others perform any task for her if she could do it herself. Her entire family treated her like a normal child and despite her handicap, she was always welcomed in different settings due to her warm and friendly personality. Such traits were key to her success, allowing the title of the first female to overcome infantile paralysis to become a medical missionary.  Mission Work  = Motivation for Medical Missions = Mary Elizabeth was born into the medical missionary setting in Shanghai as her parents were medical missionaries themselves. With such an upbringing, Mary Elizabeth was able to see all the facets of the missionary life. She didn‚Äôt just view the missionary life from a distance but she herself was actually impacted in many ways by this lifestyle. Her life was split between time in Shanghai and the United States. She became used to being apart from her parents when she was seeking education in the United States while her parents stayed in Shanghai to serve. She knew that her parents wouldn‚Äôt be able to make it to many important life events including her graduation or the weddings of her siblings. Despite all this, she understood the importance of her parent's roles and the impact that the \\"McCrackens of Shanghai\\" had. This motivated Mary Elizabeth to follow in her father's footsteps to pursue a medical degree and become a medical missionary in China. Though this was a lofty goal, she did not let her paralysis hinder her. She took up challenges and obstacles with one goal in mind: to serve the children in Shanghai. To Mary Elizabeth, her fight against infantile paralysis transformed from a part of her that she had to deal with into a trait she could overcome or even leverage to become the medical missionary she hoped to be for the Chinese children. = Service in Shanghai = After Mary Elizabeth's internship at the Refugee Hospital, she stayed one more year to work in the pediatrics department. By this time, she practically ran the entire pediatrics department at the hospital. During the Sino-Japanese War, she worked with the Red Cross to gain access to powdered milk for the refugee babies she took care of. Wanting the best for her patients, she went beyond what the Red Cross gave her, using most of her own money to buy medicines and supplies, like soybean powdered milk‚Äîa more superior supplement than just powdered milk, for \\"her children\\". Specializing in pediatrics, she returned to the United States to work in the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to gain more experience. She finished her work at the Children's Hospital on July 1, 1941. After her time at the Children's Hospital, she hoped to return to China to serve the children in Shanghai. Returning to China was harder now because the Chinese had just banned ‚Äúall women and useless men.‚Äù Despite this, Mary Elizabeth was determined to return. By seeking out her father's second cousin, Dr. Henry Noble McCracken, president of Vassar College whom had relations with President Franklin Roosevelt, she was able to get her passport approved. One reason she was able to receive her visa was because President Roosevelt himself was diagnosed with infantile paralysis too. After receiving approval, she headed back to the Refugee Hospital, where her father was in charge, to take the lead of pediatrics department again. When she returned her father noted a few differences about the way she worked. She didn‚Äôt seek to abide by her father's hospital rules anymore, though she previously was most obedient. She was also overly cautious about not wasting anything‚Äîdrinking even the residual milk in a cup after rinsing it with water. She wanted to use all of her resources most effectively to be able to serve the children the best that she could‚Äînever thinking of herself even though she constantly struggled with her disability. = Homecoming of the McCrackens = Though Mary Elizabeth was born in Shanghai and served for the most part in China, she also spent a large amount of time in the US for schooling or treatment. Where home was for the McCrackens gradually became more and more unclear, especially since the siblings were constantly scattered and split between the two countries. On December 8, 1941, the Chinese Nationalist Government overtook the hospital and told the McCrackens to leave, in addition to this, Mary Elizabeth's condition and her father's health were slowly worsening. As a result, in 1942, Mary Elizabeth left China with her parents on the Italian ship Contri Verde.Fulcher, Page 199 On the ship, she became bedridden with meningitis and was checked into a hospital when she arrived in the United States. Mary Elizabeth McCracken died on October 18, 1945.Fulcher, Page 202  Legacy: The McCracken Signature  Mary Elizabeth followed in her father's footsteps to become a medical missionary despite her battle with infantile paralysis all her life. She graduated medical school at the top of her class and became a pediatrician who served the Chinese people in Shanghai. Mary Elizabeth was the only woman who earned a medical degree from St. John's University.Fulcher, Page 183 She was often referred to as the \\"indomitable Mary\\" as she persevered until the end and did not let her disabilities hinder her service. In honor of Mary Elizabeth and as a memorial to his daughter, Josiah Calvin McCracken created the Mary E. McCracken Fund to further Mary Elizabeth's service to the Chinese. The fund named specifically after her was used to benefit the children in China whom Mary cared dearly for.McCracken, Dr. Josiah Calvin. China Medical Committee Meeting Notes. 10 Nov. 1958. As a result of her family's service in Shanghai, the McCrackens will always be known as the \\"McCrackens of Shanghai\\" for their service during such challenging times in China. In 1942, Mary Elizabeth left China with her parents on the Italian ship Contri Verde. On the ship, she became bedridden with meningitis and was checked in to a hospital when she arrived in the United States.

She was born in Hillsboro, Kansas to a traditional Christian family and was a devout member of both the non-denominational Salina Bible Church and the Baptist Women's Union. She became a registered nurse and studied theology at Tabor College before leaving for a medical mission in British Nigeria in 1938. After returning to America, Wall worked as a Clinical Supervisor of Vocational Nurses for Kern General Hospital during the 1950s and as an instructor and director of nursing services for Bakersfield College during the 1960s. Throughout her adult life, she was a dedicated member of the California State Licensed Vocational Nurses Association. Wall is noted as founder of the Children's Welfare Center at the Katsina Leper Settlement. She documented her missionary work in Sub-Saharan Africa in the book she authored Splinters from an African Log, which was published in 1960.  Early life  Martha Wall was born in the rural town of Hillsboro, Kansas. She had a younger sister, Mabel, who moved to California with her husband to be a homemaker before Wall began her missionary work. She was a devout member of both the non-denominational Salina Bible Church and the Baptist Women's Union. Wall's father threatened to disown her when she decided to join a German Mennonite church and expressed her dedication to Christianity, but she eventually convinced him to also believe in the religion. Wall's mother supported her missionary work and passion for medicine. = Education = After becoming a registered nurse, Wall attended the Christian Tabor College, where she took courses primarily focused on biblical studies. She chose to attend Tabor because she could attend classes there while still cheaply living at her parents' home in Hillsboro, which was very close to the school. As required by her curriculum, Wall additionally acted as a Sunday school teacher to a class of high school girls. In addition, Wall wrote for the Tabor Spectator (present: The View) and attended the school's evangelistic Bible conference services. She was initially uninterested in the school's Mission Band club, only beginning to attend meetings after hearing an inspiring sermon about missionary work by a Tabor alumna.p. 14 = Personal life = Wall had always felt driven to become a nurse. Before deciding to enter the missionary field, Wall had intended to complete her nursing studies at the more prestigious California University after her graduation from Tabor. Although Wall never married or had children, she claimed to have to loved the toddler orphans who she cared for at the Katsina Leper Settlement and treated them as her own. Wall worked as a Clinical Supervisor of Vocational Nurses for Kern General Hospital during the 1950s and as an instructor and director of nursing services for Bakersfield College during the 1960s. Throughout her adult life, she was a dedicated member of the California State Licensed Vocational Nurses Association, chairing fundraising events and giving tours of her hospital to other nurses.  Mission  = Call = When Wall was eighteen, she decided to \\"accep[t] the challenge of Sheldon's book, In His Steps, to begin to do everything 'as Jesus would do'... willing to give up all pleasures, [her] home--or anything-- to please God.\\"p. 14 As a teenager, Wall dedicated herself to practicing nursing and taking Bible classes at Tabor College, where she was highly involved in extracurricular activities and regularly attended church services. In her book, Splinters from an African Log, Wall writes that during her time at Tabor, she had a poor image of missionaries, as she believed they were outcasts who worked with foreigners because they could not deal with their present realities. She imagined she would attend California University after Tabor to prepare to, > ... work only in the finest hospitals with the best staffs and equipment, > and perhaps, because the finest hospitals are expensive...have only the > wealthiest and most cultured patients.p.95-96 Wall first engaged with the idea of missionary work after listening to a provocative sermon by Tabor missionary alumnus Jake Eitzen in 1937. After the sermon, she imagined God instructing her: \\"All these years you have been praying every day, 'Lord, make me the kind of nurse that You want me to be.' Well, I am showing you now. This is the kind of nurse I want you to be.\\"p. 21 The next day, Wall read an opinion piece in a leaflet she was given in a science class titled \\"The Cry of the Leper,\\" which explained the phenomena of Sudan Interior Mission leper colonies in Nigeria. She was initially disturbed and saddened by what she read and attempted to disregard it, believing that missionary work was not a part of the life she imagined for herself and would detract from her journey to becoming a distinguished nurse. The next week, however, Wall's mother unintentionally turned on the radio to a program about missionary work, which Wall interpreted as a second call by God to encourage her to reconsider her career goals. Although she believed she was not talented enough to be a missionary, she rationalized her decision to apply to the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM), while also applying to work for a hospital in California, because she imagined God instructing her: \\"What about the lepers in Africa? You have the address of the Sudan Interior Mission (SIM). Why not write [them]? Do you love your own plans more than you love Me?\\"p. 24 The SIM accepted her application a few weeks later, and Wall agreed to begin training despite private reservations about her father's disapproval and the possibility of contracting leprosy. = Journey = Wall travelled to Monterey, California for the Monterey Bible Conference in late 1937 with the SIM to begin her training and to learn more about what being a missionary would entail. At the conference, Wall was particularly inspired by talks by medical missionaries Dr. Thomas Lambie, Dr. J. Sidlow Baxter, and founder of the Sudan Interior Mission Dr. Rowland Bingham. By the end of her month there, Wall desired a life as a missionary more than a life as a nurse in the United States. After Salina Bible Church, a church from Wall's hometown of Hillsboro, agreed to financially support her missionary work, she took a train to Brooklyn, New York to meet other SIM missionaries before they left the United States. In November 1938, Wall began her journey from New York to Lagos, Nigeria with the SIM. = Service = During the 1930s and 1940s, Martha Wall acted as a medical missionary for the Sudan Interior Mission in different communities in Nigeria. Her roles included Bible teacher, nurse, doctor, writer, anthropologist, interpreter, photographer, and caretaker for orphans. Wall created the Children's Welfare Center at the Katsina Leper Settlement so that the babies and toddlers of parents with leprosy could live near their parents without risk of contracting the disease, and so they would be taken care of regardless of their parents' health.  Wushishi Compound (Wushishi, Nigeria)  Wall spent her first few months in the Wushishi Compound taking care of orphans and learning Hausa until she gained a strong mastery of the local language. After learning Hausa, Wall taught a basic mathematics and finance class to orphans and adults who requested it. Wall also taught Bible services and reading classes using a Bible translated into Hausa to non- Christian Nigerians with the intention of converting them.  SIM Kano Station (Kano, Nigeria)  Wall acted as the primary doctor for a group of around 40 patients with various medical ailments. Before treating her patients each day, Wall lead morning Bible services as required by SIM protocol. She trained a local teenage boy to help her distribute medicine and interpret for patients who did not speak the form of Hausa she earned in Wushishi. Wall also devoted time to learning about tropical diseases, the British names for medicines, and what medicines can and cannot be mixed. She studied doctors' notes and learned how to make pills and mix ointments.  Katsina Leper Settlement (Katsina, Nigeria)  Wall conducted her most impactful missionary work at the Katsina Leper Settlement. She acted as a doctor for hundreds of adults and children with leprosy, treating them with medicine, recording their changing conditions daily, and providing them with emotional and spiritual support. She learned more about the science behind leprosy and novel treatment approaches. In addition, Wall created the aforementioned (see: Service subheading) Children's Welfare Center so that the babies and toddlers of parents with leprosy could live near their parents without risk of contracting the disease and would be taken care of regardless of their parents' health. She prepared meals for, bathed, and medically treated hundreds of these babies and toddlers. At Katsina, Wall also learned more about the impact of Christianity and her mission, SIM, on local Nigerians and developed public health philosophies.  Jega Compound (Jega, Nigeria)  Wall dedicated much of her time at Jega to promoting Christianity among local Muslims, primarily by teaching children Christian hymns. After she had gained their interest, she was permitted to enter their homes and speak with their mothers. Wall believed Islam oppressed women, many of whose husbands she observed treating them as property. She believed Christianity could help Muslim women gain autonomy. Wall's notes on her time at Jega, recorded in Splinters from an African Log, repeatedly express a disgust for the practice of marrying girls without their consent. When a Muslim man refused to let his children be treated by Wall because she was a woman and a Christian, Wall responded sharly, saying that refusing her care made him responsible for the child's death. = Return = Wall officially returned to America from Nigeria in the early 1950s. She worked as a Clinical Supervisor of Vocational Nurses for Kern General Hospital during the late 1950s and as an instructor and director of nursing services for Bakersfield College during the 1960s. Throughout her adult life, she was a dedicated member of the California State Licensed Vocational Nurses Association, chairing fundraising events and giving tours of her hospital to other nurses. After her nursing career, Wall retired to her hometown of Hillsboro, where she died at the age of 90.  Philosophy  = SIM values and conversion = Wall agreed with the SIM Christian conversion strategy that it was beneficial to first treat her patients medically and then treat them spiritually by encouraging them toward Christianity. Wall believed that this tactic was particularly important in the devoutly Muslim communities of northern Nigeria, such as Jega. In these regions, doctors and nurses who explicitly promoted Christianity were denied access to patients. = Children's welfare = Wall believed it was her duty as a missionary to act as a caretaker to the children of her patients and to do everything in her power to protect them from infection. She did, however, disagree with SIM‚Äôs policy accepting coercion as a means to separate children from parents diagnosed with leprosy, Wall dedicated more time to supporting such children than the SIM missionaries who proceeded her. She explained this philosophy, regarding the opening of the Children's Welfare Center at the Katsina Leper Settlement, in Splinters from an African Log: > By kindness and patience we must win the mothers' confidence. In the > meantime we could at least begin to show them that we are kind to babies and > children, and that they would be happy with us. If they would bring their > babies to us for a few hours a day, we would be able to keep an eye on their > general physical condition, checking their weight, treating childhood > ailments before they became serious‚Äîand we would still be giving these > lovely little children a chance to go through life without contracting the > disease.p.99 = American consumerism = After her missions, Wall sought to make Americans aware of their excessive consumerism and the value they placed on superfluous things. She explained this philosophy in Splinters from an African Log: > I have come to see that buying toys or ice cream or dog food is not sin. The > sin lies in permitting Christians to remain victims of a warped sense of > values that is impoverishing their own lives and robbing them of a great > inheritance [in Heaven]... It is sin to allow earnest young Christians to > plan mediocre lives around a materialistic ideal without challenging them to > battle. We sin if we do not offer to lead the charge! God has sent us > [missionaries] into a stirring conflict, one that should stir response in > the blood of every Christian...God holds us responsible for > advance!p.134-135 = Marketing missionary work = Wall was hesitant to simplify or glorify her experiences to attract attention to her cause. In Splinters from an African Log, Wall describes the difficulty of choosing whether to write about an emotional but straightforward experience she had curing a patient or accurately describe the conditions lepers endured and the complex decisions she was forced to make. Wall struggled with how to best to convey the realities she faced while still describing her experiences in a way that would encourage donations and raise interest in missionary work. She explained this philosophy in Splinters from an African Log: > Are we missionaries... partly to blame for this complete oblivion to the > worth of a lost soul? Perhaps because we see people so occupied with > tangibles, we hesitate to present the real purpose of missions‚Äîof our own > work‚Äîfor fear we will offend. People want to be entertained. If we learn how > to achieve this art, the contributions toward our work are quite gratifying. > So we polish up our best stories.p.133  Legacy  Wall created the first Children's Welfare Center at the Katsina Leper Settlement so that the babies and toddlers of parents with leprosy could live near their parents without risk of contracting the disease and would be taken care of regardless of their parents' health. Although SIM had attempted to create similar Centers before, Wall's was the first successful, sustainable program. She encouraged mothers to allow their children to be treated in this center by hosting weekly banquets where she provided families with food, donated new clothes for their toddlers, and gave baths to their babies.

Heston attended medical school at Laura Memorial Women‚Äôs Medical College of Cincinnati and was an associate physician at the General Hospital in Miraj, India, from 1903 to 1907. She performed over five hundred surgical operations during her service in Miraj. Personal life Heston was born in Ionia, Michigan on April 27, 1872, to Alonzo Heston and Mary Elizabeth Heston (n√©e Brown). Heston had one half-sister, Jessie B. Coulter (n√©e Clark), a daughter of her mother‚Äôs from a previous marriage to Henry N. Clark. Heston spent her early life in Charlotte, Michigan, with her mother and half-sister. Heston served as an associate physician at the General Hospital in Miraj, India, from 1903 to 1907. During Heston's first period of missionary work in India, her sister, Jessie B. Coulter (n√©e Clark), died following a long illness. This was very difficult for Heston since she was so far away from her sister, who was still living in Michigan when it happened. The loss made Heston reluctant to return to the United States, since she knew her sister would no longer be there when she arrived in Michigan. Heston returned to the United States in 1908. She sailed from India on March 15, 1908 and arrived in New York on May 22, 1908. During her voyage home from India, Heston became romantically involved with a British officer who had also been working in the Maharashtra State in India during the time Heston was there. He was aboard the same ship Heston took when she left India in 1908, both of them traveling through Italy on their trip back to their respective home countries. Heston and other passengers on the ship, including other missionaries and Italian military officers, visited Naples, Italy, after their ship arrived in Europe. During this time, Heston wrote in letters to friends at home that she had become close to the officer, who was a major in the British army. Heston had encountered the officer before, during her time in India, when he brought her back to the Presbyterian mission after she had fallen off her horse. After they parted ways in Italy, Heston received a letter from the officer, claiming that he would come to visit her if she gave him any encouragement. Heston indicated in a letter that she planned to invite him to visit her in the United States. In a letter to her friend in 1908, Heston suggested that she planned to marry the officer. She feared that this would prevent her from returning to India to do missionary work. Ultimately, Heston never married, and returned to India for a second mission in 1910. After returning home, Heston compiled a collection of her personal letters into the novel A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home, which was published by the Fleming H. Revell Company in 1910. In 1909, Heston took a government position as an eye doctor, serving the Native American population in Arizona. Suffering from poor health after her time in India, she only spent one year working there. After leaving Arizona, she spent a brief period of time living in California but had to return home due to her illness. She returned home to Michigan for a short time, then sailed to Bombay again on December 17, 1910. From 1910 to 1915, Heston worked at a hospital for women and children in Jhelum, India under the United Presbyterian Board. In 1915, Heston sailed back to the United States via China and Japan. Heston died on June 1, 1922, in East Jordan, Michigan, of an accidental morphine overdose. She was 50 years old. Education Heston graduated from Alma College, a Presbyterian university in Michigan, in 1896, and from the Laura Memorial Woman's Medical College of Cincinnati, in 1901, with the degrees of M.D. and M.A. She worked for one year as an intern at the Presbyterian Hospital in Cincinnati before accepting service with the Foreign Mission Society of the Presbyterian Church. Dr. Heston with famine orphans and other missionaries in Western India Journey Heston sailed to Bombay, India, from New York, New York, leaving the United States on October 14, 1902. She was accompanied on her voyage by two other Christian missionaries, who left their ten-year-old daughter behind in America when they left for India. Heston described their parting as tearful, and was very sad to leave New York herself. She arrived in Bombay on November 20, 1902, and began preparing for missionary work. Missionary Work Heston went on her first medical mission to India in 1902, and remained in India until she returned to the United States in 1908. After a period of time working in the United States, she went back to India for another mission in 1910, and remained for five years before returning to the United States in 1915. =First Mission= After arriving in Bombay, Heston began to learn the local Marathi language, which the Presbyterian board required missionaries in Western India to study during the first year of their service in India. Heston, however, took the Marathi proficiency exam after only six months of study and began working actively in the community before the end of her first year in India. After finishing her studies, Heston became an associate physician at the General Hospital in Miraj, India, in the Maharashtra State, which is known today as the Mary Wanless Hospital/Miraj Medical Center. In 1903, the hospital was under the direction of William J. Wanless, M.D., a missionary who, like Heston, had traveled to India with the Presbyterian board. Heston served as an associate physician in Miraj from the beginning of her missionary work in 1903 until she returned to the United States in 1908. During her time in Miraj, Heston performed over five hundred surgical operations. =Return Home= Heston returned to the United States for two years between her periods of missionary service. She sailed from Bombay on March 15, 1908, and arrived in New York on May 22, 1908. She sailed to New York via Italy, stopping to visit Venice and Naples with other missionaries and military officers aboard her ship. Heston had felt ill and tired throughout much of her later years in India, which she felt may have been linked to her grief after the death of her half-sister in 1904 and the loss of another missionary working at the General Hospital in Miraj. Upon her return to New York, she was advised by a nerve specialist to take a \\"rest cure\\" and remain on bed rest for at least four weeks. In 1908 and 1909, Heston lived with her mother in Michigan and compiled letters she had sent while abroad to create her novel A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home, which was published by the Fleming H. Revell Company in 1910. In October 1909, Heston took a government position in Arizona as an eye specialist. She served the Native American community there until leaving for California in 1910. Due to her poor health, Heston only spent a brief period in California before returning home to Michigan. =Second Mission= In 1910, Heston returned to India to continue her missionary work. Before leaving India after her first period of missionary work in 1908, she had been informed that the Presbyterian board planned to open a hospital for women and children in Jhelum, India, which should be ready for work in less than two years. In 1910, Heston took charge of that hospital and worked there until 1915, completing more surgical operations than she had during her previous service. Legacy Dr. Heston is known for her significant surgical service as a female surgeon in India, her leadership as founding director of the mission hospital in Jhelum Cantonment, and her book A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home,. Death In 1915, Heston returned to Michigan, sailing from India via Japan and California. She lived in East Jordan, Charlevoix, Michigan, until her death in 1922. Heston died on June 1, 1922, in East Jordan, Michigan, of an accidental morphine overdose. The overdose may have been connected to Heston's long illness. She was advised to take a \\"rest cure\\" after returning from her first mission to India in 1908, due to poor health during her time abroad, and was troubled by her illness during her time in United States, when she was unable to remain in Arizona or California for long periods of time due to her health issues. She was 50 years old at the time of her death. Publications * Heston, Winifred (1910). A Bluestocking in India: Her Medical Wards and Messages Home. Fleming H. Revell Company.

Kilborn and Retta Kilborn, was born in Sichuan, China. Kilborn greatly advanced missionary work in west China. He was the author of multiple texts, translator of many textbooks, and served as director of the College of Medicine of West China Union University and dean of the Faculty of the College of Medicine. Background Kilborn married Dr. Janet R. McClure, the daughter of missionaries in the Canadian Presbyterian Mission in north China. Therefore, she was well acquainted with Mandarin Chinese, and both began working immediately for missionaries in Sichuan. They had three children. Janet passed away in 1945, and Kilborn married Jean Ewart Millar, an anesthetic specialist. They lived under the Communist regime in China, and helped refugees who sought shelter and accommodation. Millar was born in Guelph, Ontario, in 1906. She served as a missionary for the Woman's Missionary Society in Chinese hospitals between 1932 and 1946, and taught at the University of Hong Kong, where Leslie also worked after 1952. She returned with her husband to Canada in 1963, and died in 1982; he died in 1967. Education Kilborn was born in China, and moved back to Canada to pursue an education. Kilborn enrolled at the University of Toronto in 1913, and took honors classes in physiology and biochemistry. Graduating with first-class honors in 1917, he obtained his M.A. in physiology and obtained his M.D. in 1921. He also received the Victoria Silver Medal in Science. University of Toronto, where Leslie Gifford Kilborn graduated with first-class honors in 1917. He co-wrote the book Observations on the Glycogen Content of Certain Invertebrates and Fishes with John James Rickard Macleod. He also wrote a number of other books about the effects of adrenaline in vascular changes, notably in animals or vertebrates. To advance his academic career further, Kilborn moved from Sichuan to Chengdu. He worked at the West China Union University as a physiology professor. At the university, he collaborated with other faculty to translate many medical textbooks into Chinese. In collaboration with another author, he translated Halliburton‚Äôs Physiology. In the late 1920s, Kilborn earned his Ph.D. degree in physiology in Canada before continuing his career at the university. Kilborn eventually became the director of the College of Medicine and Dentistry, which his father Omar had pioneered, until 1950. He also earned the deanship of the Faculty of Medicine. Journey Kilborn and his wife Janet set out for west China in the autumn of 1921. After arriving at Chengdu, he started medical work in Pengxian county and took Mandarin lessons simultaneously. About a year and a half later, he moved from Pengxian county back to Chengdu where he began his teaching career as a physiology lecturer. Quickly rising through the ranks of the academic world, Leslie became the dean of the Department of Physiology and deputy section head of the medical division. In 1925, Kilborn was seriously injured by a dum-dum bullet. He needed four months to recover partially and his wounds left him with a permanently disabled shoulder. His new disability hindered his penchant for missionary work, making it difficult for him to move around and carry out daily activities. In 1936 he became dean of the College of Medicine and three years later, he was elected the director of the College of Dentistry in 1939. He held the position for eight years. Not only ensuring their accommodation, but also ensuring the continuation of their education, Kilborn allowed the displaced students to use the amenities of his university. His dedication to house refugees manifested ostensibly when he welcomed them to the comforts of his own home. Service In 1952, he left China and became the professor of physiology at the University of Hong Kong. As an academic force, Kilborn pursued research with a fervor. He was deeply involved with research on the tribal people of the west China borderland, and often made trips to the countryside. He continued to remain in Hong Kong as vice-president of Chung Chi College, an institution that contributed to missionary work.Leslie G. Kilborn. Awareness : Address to Weekly Assembly Chung Chi College Chapel, February 15, 1963. Hong Kong: Chung Chi College Staff Club, 1963. The center where Kilborn conducted research promoted the rapid development of regional health care. His mastery of Mandarin allowed him to interact easily with the Chinese native to the region, eradicating suspicion or mistrust because he spoke their native tongue. Morse called him \\"a specialist with the highest professional training we have never seen before. He was able to lead the development of physiology. He was born in China, no other foreign teachers could speak decent Chinese like him.\\" \\"His laboratory was the best of its kind in W.C.U.U.\\"Leslie G. Kilborn.

He was deeply involved in politics and strengthening international relations. When Canada and China first established diplomatic relations, the Canadian government asked Kilborn to assist the newly appointed minister in establishing a legation in Chongqing. He travelled between Canada and Chengdu despite the arduous travel involved.

Background  Colonel Jehiel Elyachar speaking at the cornerstone ceremony of the library which is named after him, June 1962 The Library (on the right) during construction next to Churchill Auditorium, 1964 When the Technion was founded in 1924, in Hadar HaCarmel in Haifa, a library was established; it maintained the collections of all the different disciplines studied and researched in the Technion. In the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of the faculties moved from the historic campus to the new campus in the Nave-Shaanan neighborhood. Small research libraries were set up in the new faculty buildings. The original library, which became the central library, continued its acquisition, cataloging, classification and document supply activities for itself and for all the research libraries. In 1965 the present library building was constructed on the new campus. The library was named in honor of Colonel Jehiel Elyachar, who funded the project.The History and Development of the Technion Library System , at the Technion Libraries' web portal.

The reading halls include several study areas and books that are in high demand and used often including textbooks, reference books and literature. The basement archives historical collections and materials that are significant for research. This floor also houses books that are infrequently used, historical journals and the Technion theses collection. The floor includes a special climate controlled room that preserves rare, ancient and precious books. In addition, several historical collections from the second half of The 20th Century, such as a collection of research reports written in the Technion, a collection of study and exercise books produced by the Technion Student Association, a collection of Technion publications, the historical collections of the Technion Construction Department and the Technion Orchestra archive, can be found on this floor. In the library lobby is a gallery that displays temporary artistic exhibits on Technion related subjects. In the future a cafeteria will be opened in the lobby. According to library data, approximately 2000 patrons visit the library daily. The Central Library serves as an institutional repository for all PhD, MSc and MD theses written in the Technion. Theses written from 2006 through 2015 were deposited in both electronic and print formats and from 2016 only in electronic format. The full text of the theses is available on the Technion's internal network and in the future will be freely available on the internet as well. The library committee is a formal body appointed by the Technion Senate. Its role is to discuss and advise the Technion administration on the libraries' development policies, their budgets and personnel.

He is notable for his meticulous depictions of the impact of aerial bombing upon historic buildings during World War Two. Biography London: Clearance of debris between Gresham Street and St Paul's, 1941 (Art.IWM ART LD 2214) Flanders was born in Walthamstow, East London to Bernard Flanders, a pianist, and Jessie, a skillful painter of miniature flower scenes. The young Flanders was a naturally gifted artist who began drawing at an early age. Aged seven, he won the Princess Louise Gold Medal for the arts. After attending the Merchant Taylors' School, Flanders studied at the Regent Street Polytechnic, St. Martin's School of Art, and at the Central School of Arts and Crafts before working in a variety of jobs. He worked for a firm of accountants, for the interior decorator Maurice Adams and then in a print works before, in 1937, taking the decision to attempt to establish himself as a freelance artist and illustrator. In later life, he claimed he was inspired to do this after seeing a copy of Muirhead Bone's book of illustrations, Old Spain. During the Second World War, Flanders enlisted in the British Army in September 1942. He worked at the School of Military Engineering in Ripon and was then based at Welbeck Abbey in Nottinghanshire where he made models of buildings and landscapes based on aerial reconnaissance photographs. He applied for a commission with the War Artists' Advisory Committee and although he was unsuccessful, the Committee did agree to purchase several drawings from him. These were mostly detailed depictions of bomb damaged buildings and churches in London, Bath and Canterbury and included views of both St Paul's Cathedral and Canterbury Cathedral. The Church of St Anne and St Agnes, Gresham Street, EC2, 1941 (Art.IWM ART LD 1233) After the War, Flanders became a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy and in several other galleries. He held his first solo exhibition at Colnaghi's in 1947. Between 1956 and 1964 he regularly produced drawings and sketches for publication in the Illustrated London News. Flanders was active in a number of art societies and in 1975 served as Master of the Art Workers Guild. Flanders illustrated several books and published two volumes of prints from his own drawings of the British landscape and its architecture, which had been the dominant theme of his artistic career. Both the publication of Dennis Flanders' Britannia, in 1984, and Dennis Flanders' London, in 1986, were supported by public exhibitions, at the Fine Art Society and the Guildhall Library respectively. The former volume contained over 200 drawings created over a span of forty years.

After a lull during the Depression and World War II, the group renewed its activities under a new name, the Fine Arts Association.\\"Depression, War Big Obstacles, but Center for Arts 'Healthy'\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel July 4, 1976 Pg. 60 In February 1953, the group became incorporated as the Mesa County Art Center.\\"Cultural Confidential: The Art Center celebrates 55 years\\" Glenwood Springs Post Independent September 4, 2008 In 1957, the organization was granted 501(c)(3) status, and in January 1968, members voted to change the name to the Western Colorado Center for the Arts. Credit for transforming the small, 1940s art club into a formal nonprofit with an art center for the community is largely given to 21 individuals. In 1947, Fred Mantey, a local philanthropist, offered to donate one acre and $1,000 for the purpose of creating an art center in Grand Junction.Interview with Robbie Breaux, President of the Board of Trustees, Western Colorado Center for the Arts June 2016 Alfred Nestler, an interior decorator, prominent artist of the region, and Mantey's son-in-law, promoted the idea and enlisted other artists to help organize the effort.\\"Arts Center Program will Honor Founders\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel November 2, 1986 After much behind-the-scenes work, Mantey's donation became official in 1953. Other people who devoted significant resources and time to the founding of the Art Center and served on its board included: * E.L. Bacon- president of US Bank at the time * Josephine Biggs * Verona Burkhard - a nationally known artist and teacher, she designed and created the copper doors in the first building constructed to house the Art Center * Bryce Carpenter * Helen Crosbie- a nationally known sculptor * Dr. Stanley Crosbie * Lucy Ela- a former member of the Beaux Art Club, she wrote the Art Center's constitution and bylaws. * Dr. Kenneth Graves- one of the founders of Community Hospital * Glenn Hopper- owner of Intermountain Printing at the time * Jessie Jones * Helen Martin * Ruth G. Moss * Conway Nowlan * Clarence Prinster- one of four brothers who developed the City Market grocery store chain, he pursued oil painting as a hobby. * Alvie Redden- the first full-time art instructor at Colorado Mesa University (formerly Mesa State College) * George Unkless * Gretl Waldapfel * Dr. Richard Waldapfel * Sterling Smith While raising funds for a building of their own, the board and volunteers presented art programs at various locations in Grand Junction. They could be found promoting the arts at such places as elementary schools and city hall. They also circulated art masterpiece reproductions in Mesa County Valley School District 51 schools,\\"The Art Center Celebrates 50 Years\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel special feature July 13, 2003 pg. O&A; 2 and operated a rental gallery where an average of 500 paintings per month were loaned to businesses and private residences.Original scrapbooks of founder Ruth Moss, Art Center historical archives, accessed June 2016. By 1940, the group had purchased six paintings for the Art Center's permanent collection. These art works were stored for safe keeping at the central branch of the Mesa County Public Library and at Mesa Junior College (which later became Colorado Mesa University).McNab, Cheryl \\"Western Colorado Center for the Arts: Employee Handbook\\" 2012 The fundraising campaign included artists' balls, exhibits, sidewalk art sales, musical shows and rummage sales. One effort petitioned school children to buy a brick' for the new building for 25 cents. According to the Art Center, every student attending local schools bought a brick. Art clubs in the area, including the Brush and Palette Club, Paint for Pleasure, the Wednesday Music Club, and the original Colorado chapter of the American Artists Professional League, supported fundraising efforts with projects of their own. In 1957, with approval from Mantey's widow, the board of trustees decided to sell the land given to the organization by Fred Mantey, deeming it too far out of town to serve as a good location for a community arts center. In May 1960, the organization bought and remodeled a two-story frame house at 1745 N. Seventh Street in Grand Junction. The building was meant to serve as a temporary location until an ideal structure could be built. The Mesa County Art Center facility opened its doors November 1960. The main floor of the house was used for exhibits and recitals. Painting classes were held upstairs, and ceramics classes were in the basement. The Art Center boasted 121 members. By 1965, the Art Center had outgrown the original house. A professional fundraising effort kicked off in October 1967, and the Art Center took over its own campaign several months later. With the generous help of area residents and businesses, a new building was erected just north of the two- story house.\\"Business Biography\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel March 12, 1978 pg. 6 The facility included a kitchen, classrooms, and an octagonal room with walls designed for exhibits. This room also included a stage for music and dance performances and productions of a community theater group. The Art Center moved in April, 1970. The Art Center also purchased additional land north of the new building to Orchard Avenue which now serves as the parking lot. The Art Center hired its first director in September 1978,\\"Art Center's New Director to Take Post\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel October 11, 1978 pg. 34 and programs were expanded to include more classes and some major juried shows. In 1982, the Art Center received a $100,000 donation from the Grand Junction Lions Club. This money came with two conditions: Matching funds must be raised from the community and the Art Center must break ground on its second expansion before January 1983. The Art Center broke ground on the expansion just weeks before the deadline.\\"Ground broken for Addition to Western Slope Art Center\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel December 18, 1982 pg. 26 This expansion turned a 7,800-square-foot facility into a 14,000-square- foot building.Dodworth, Allen \\"Western Colorado Center for the Arts Expansion Proposal\\" 1981 Art Center historical archives, accessed June 2016. New features included a large entrance lobby with an art shop, two courtyards, the North Gallery, storage areas, and a ceramics studio. Storage and dressing rooms were added to the theater area during remodeling of the existing building. Both the house and the new building were owned free and clear. The Art Center planned to reopen with an exhibition from the Smithsonian Institution featuring works of 20th century artists, including Pablo Picasso.\\"Going Up: Expanding Fine Arts Center Awaiting Summer Opening\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 15, 1983 pg. 15 Unfortunately, the $750,000 expansion coincided with the collapse of the oil shale industry. Grand Junction's economy took an abrupt downturn and the population declined as major oil shale extraction operations and other energy-related businesses laid off thousands of workers. The Arts Center's funding drive to pay for the expansion came up short.\\"Art Center Climbs Back into the Black\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel August 6, 1987 pg. 1B By 1985, the Art Center had 760 members. However, new membership was down, and existing members were renewing at reduced levels. Simultaneously, the operating costs of the Art Center had increased, and both investment and program revenue were down. The Art Center turned its focus to local artists and exhibits, and cut its professional organization memberships.\\"Interest in Arts Center is Up but Revenues are Down\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 12, 1985 pg. 4C. The director resigned, saying the Art Center could no longer afford his position.\\"Art Center Director Resigns: Dwindling Funds Force Board of Trustees to Consider Changes\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel June 18, 1985 pg. 1B In 1986, 10 members of the Board of Trustees put their own money into sponsoring the biggest juried art show undertaken in Grand Junction to date. The show, titled ART-USA, was organized in less than four months. A sum of $10,000 would be divided among the top four artists. The unusually high cash prizes were designed to attract a large number of entries, and announcements were sent to art schools and institutions nationwide. The board of trustees anticipated thousands of entrants, followed by thousands of visitors to the 6-week exhibition.\\"Backers Plan Huge Show: ART USA aims for a $10,000 purse\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel February 23, 1986 pgs. 1C, 8C.

Emphasis was given to making art fun and accessible for families with the aim of dispelling the perception that the Art Center was an elite club purely for intellectuals. In 1986, the Art Center Foundation was established. This endowment is a separate, supporting entity to the Art Center. At present, the ACF owns most of the permanent art collection housed at the Art Center. On the heels of a second successful ART-USA exhibit that saw 1,600 entries from across the US and abroad,\\"ART USA 'Running Away' with Success\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel August 23, 1987 pg. 8C the Art Center repaid its debts. In the spring of 1989, Dr. Arch Gould approached the Art Center with an idea: He would donate $100,000 worth of Navajo rugs to the ACF permanent collection and $100,000 to expand the Art Center facility if the community could raise $100,000 for the long-term maintenance of the collection. A collector from the eastern United States promised six additional rugs worth an estimated $75,000.\\"Funding Success: Navajo Rug Challenge Nearly Met\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel September 8, 1990 The new space, dubbed the Gould Gallery, was dedicated in January 1991. Beginning in the 1990s, the Art Center found itself struggling once again with space restrictions, high use and limited finances. The Art Center tried twice to negotiate a loan from the city of Grand Junction, but was unsuccessful.\\"Arts Center Finds Unlikely City Ally\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel May 28, 1992 pg. 1A In 1992, an emergency membership drive was staged, and the board reluctantly agreed to charge a general admission fee to the Art Center as a \\"last resort.\\"\\"Arts Center Seeking Funds to Remain Open\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel June 23, 1992 pg. 1B The generosity of local patrons and shrewd management kept the doors to the Art Center open through the tight local economy of the 1990s, when the area was once again experiencing the detrimental effects of a downturn in the energy industry. The Art Center has tried twice to relocate for the sake of space. In 1993, the Art Center abandoned plans to move into the old Main Street Mercantile building when another buyer beat it to the purchase.\\"Arts Center Loses Ground on Fulfilling Goal to Move\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel February 1, 1993 pg. 1B In 2001, the Art Center approached city parks officials with a proposal to build a new art center on a former mill-tailings site near the Colorado River, adjacent to the Grand Junction Botanical Gardens,\\"Arts Center wants to relocate on city land near the river\\" Grand Junction Daily Sentinel February 16, 2001 pg. 1B but this relocation plan was eventually shelved in favor of addressing more immediate goals at the current center.

Life The grave of Canon Edward Joseph Hannan, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh He was born in Ballingarry, County Limerick on 21 June 1836. He was ordained as a priest in 1860. He came to Edinburgh in 1861 on holiday and was persuaded to stay by the bishop to run the recently re-inaugurated St Patricks. During his long period in Edinburgh he did much to address the social problems of the poorer Catholics in the city, and founded a local branch of the Catholic Young Mens Society (CYMS) in 1865, which had been founded in Ireland by his uncle, Monsignor Richard B. O'Brien. In 1871 he became priest in charge at St Patricks. He did much for the inhabitants of \\"Little Ireland\\", the Irish community in Edinburgh, centred around the Cowgate. In 1875, together with the 21 year old Michael Whelahan of the CYMS, and in part to mark the centenary of Daniel O'Connell's birth, he founded Hibernian Football Club. Hannan served as the club's first Manager and as President until his death. Despite only starting as a church club Canon Hannan did much lobbying resulting in acceptance of the team playing for the Scottish Cup in 1877, only two years after their foundation. He lived in the house attached to St Patricks Church.Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory He died of pneumonia on 24 June 1891. He is buried on the western path of the original part of Grange Cemetery in southern Edinburgh. The large white marble memorial was restored By Hibernian Historical Trust in 2006.

Shown in the picture is the Mall of America, one of the largest malls in the USA.Consumer Culture focuses on the spending of the customers money on material goods to attain a lifestyle in a capitalist economy. One country that has a large consumer culture is the United States of America. Over the past hundred years, 1900 to 2000, market goods came to dominate American life and for the first time in history, consumerism had no practical limits. Consumer culture has provided affluent societies with peaceful alternatives to tribalism and class war, it has fueled extraordinary economic growth. The challenge for the future is to find ways to revive the valid portion of the culture of constraint and control the overpowering success of the all-consuming twentieth century.  Types of Culture  According to Berger, \\"Social scientists Aaron Wildavsky and Mary Douglas suggest that there are four political cultures, which also function as consumer cultures: hierarchical or elitist, individualist, egalitarian, and fatalist.\\" # An elitist, is a person who believes that a system or society should be ruled or dominated by an elite. # An individualist, is a person who does things without being concerned about what other people will think. # An egalitarian, believes in the principle that all people are equal and deserve equal rights and opportunities. # A fatalist, is someone who feels that no matter what he or she does, the outcome will be the same because it is predetermined. Consumer culture is based on the idea of demographics, which is targeting a large group of people with similar interests, traits or cultural attributes.  Mass Market Theory  Advertisements like this one help capture the attention of consumers to get them to spend money. = Advertising and Strategies = Over the years, people of different age groups are employed by marketing companies to help understand the beliefs, attitudes, values, and past behaviors of the targeted consumers. This creates a more effective advertisement than the normal data gathering strategy that is used. A quote by Shah states that, \\"The sophistication of advertising done methods and techniques has advanced, enticing and shaping and even creating consumerism and needs where there has been none before.\\"  Labor  After this consumer culture developed, the life of workers changed forever hppts. = Wage Work = As you can see in this picture, both men and women working in the factory together. Before the Industrial Revolution, home was a place where men and women produced, consumed, and worked. The men were high valued workers, such as barbers, butchers, farmers, and lumbermen who brought income into the house. The wives of these men completed various tasks to save money which included, churning butter, fixing clothes, and tending the garden. This system created an equal value to all of the jobs and tasks in a community. Once the Industrial Revolution began, there was no such thing as an equal and high valued work(er) in a mass production industry. The only value these workers had were the wage they made. That meant the wives lost their value at home and had to start working for a living. This new system created the thought of everyone being replaceable.  Life of a Worker  The life of a worker was a challenging one. Working 12-14 hour days, 6 days a week, and in a dangerous environment. The worst part was the infrequency of pay or not being paid at all. At times, employers paid their workers in script pay, or non-U.S. currency, or even in-store credit.

Up until July 2016, Watson concurred with his alt-right label, but has since dropped the label and now self-identifies as being part of the new right. Despite the change, he is still understood to be a far-right individual by multiple sources. In May 2019, Facebook and Instagram permanently banned Watson for violation of hate speech policies. Watson's Islamophobia and support for far-right hate groups has resulted in YouTube sanctioning him to the point that he considered quitting, but ultimately decided against. Watson's career emerged through his work for conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones. As editor-at-large of Jones' website InfoWars, he helped promote fake news and advocated for 9/11, chemtrail and New World Order conspiracy theories. Subsequently, reaching a significant audience, both Watson and Jones altered their focus. Presently their commentary is mainly focused on criticizing feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics. Watson also contributes to InfoWarss talk radio program The Alex Jones Show, where he occasionally either hosts or co-hosts. Watson has been working on InfoWars since October 2002. Since 2011, Watson has hosted his own YouTube channel, prisonplanetlive, from which he expresses his views on topics such as contemporary society, politics, and modern liberalism in an often mocking manner. He describes his channel as \\"Culture, controversy, contrarianism\\" and often lampoons celebrities and politicians. As of January 2020, his channel has over 1.78 million subscribers.  Political stance  Watson described his formative moment as when, at the age of 18, he watched The Secret Rulers of the World, a documentary in which journalist Jon Ronson accompanied Alex Jones in infiltrating Bohemian Grove in California, a location where some conspiracy theorists believe that global elites plot the New World Order. He has described British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who he first read as a teenager, as the person who woke him up. Watson, along with Jones and InfoWars as a whole, has shifted from mainly commenting on conspiracy theories such as chemtrails, the New World Order and the Illuminati, to increasingly commenting against feminism, Islam, and left-wing politics. Watson has been described as a member of \\"the new far-right\\" by The New York Times, which wrote in August 2017 that his \\"videos are straightforward nativist polemics, with a particular focus on Europe\\" and also noted his opposition to modernist architecture and modern art. Iman Abou Atta, the director of the anti-Islamophobia group Tell MAMA, has said that \\"Paul Joseph Watson has become 'the' nexus for anti-Muslim accounts that we have mapped... He has become an influencer in promoting information‚Äîmuch of it bizarre and untrue‚Äîwhich has been regurgitated by anti- Muslim and anti-migrant accounts time and time again.\\" Watson previously described himself as a \\"libertarian\\" and supported Ron Paul in the 2012 presidential election. In a 2016 tweet, he said he no longer considered himself a \\"libertarian\\" because Gary Johnson \\"made the term an embarrassment.\\" Watson has also referred to himself as a \\"conservative\\" and he considers modern-day conservatism to be a countercultural movement. In a post on Facebook in November 2016, Watson differentiated between being a member of the New Right, which he considers to be distinct from the alt-right. He claimed that the alt-right \\"likes to fester in dark corners of subreddits and obsess about Jews, racial superiority and Adolf Hitler.\\" He and Mike Cernovich have feuded with figures such as Richard B. Spencer and David Duke who see white nationalism as necessary for the alt-right. Although he endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election, Watson declared in a tweet on 6 April 2017 he was \\"officially OFF the Trump train\\" following the president's decision to launch missile strikes on Syria in response to a gas attack several days earlier, believing Trump had reneged on his promise to not intervene in Syria. He said the president was \\"just another deep state/Neo-con puppet\\". After a decrease in Twitter followers occurred, he denied he had \\"turned on Trump,\\" saying he was only \\"off the Trump train in terms of Syria\\" and blamed the media for \\"fake news\\". He declared in a separate tweet he would shift his focus on ensuring French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen of the National Front would be elected in the 2017 election, in which she was ultimately defeated. Donald Trump Jr. retweeted Watson's reference to French celebrities leaving France if Le Pen was elected and referred dismissively to similar reputed claims in the US before Trump Sr. was elected. On 16 June 2018, Watson announced that he had joined the UK Independence Party along with Mark Meechan and Carl Benjamin. Watson with Alex Jones in June 2013  In the media  In 2016, he was an early proponent of the health allegations that Hillary Clinton suffers from numerous serious medical conditions, although he was unable to provide any evidence. Watson's part in the manufacture and dissemination of the rumour was taken up by the National Enquirer and mentioned in the mainstream media as part of a discussion of the role of rumour and conspiracy theory in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In February 2017, he tweeted an offer to pay for a journalist to visit Sweden and stay in the \\"crime ridden migrant suburbs\\" of Malm√∂, if they think it would be safe. Many journalists took him up on the offer, and Watson chose New York journalist and videographer Tim Pool, who was already planning a similar investigation. Watson provided US$2,000 to Pool for the trip. Tim Pool also ran a fundraiser to fund an investigation into other 'no-go zones' in other areas of Sweden and Europe. At a White House press briefing in November 2018, persistent questioning of President Trump led to an intern attempting to take a microphone from the hand of CNN's Jim Acosta. Acosta's White House press credentials were subsequently revoked, allegedly for having \\"put his hands\\" on the intern. Watson uploaded an edited version of the original footage in support of this claim. In this version, zoom and frame rate changes create the misleading impression that Acosta had behaved aggressively towards the intern. Watson confirmed that he had applied a zoom and denied making any other alterations, though expert analysis confirmed that \\"the clip repeats several frames that do not appear in the original footage\\" and that it had been speeded up. The video has generally been described as 'doctored', though some experts concluded that the changes do not necessarily represent deliberate manipulation but could be the result of artefacts resulting from accidental degradation during processing. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pointed to the video that Watson posted as clearly documenting Acosta's \\"inappropriate behaviour.\\" The White House was criticised for sharing a doctored video and thereby spreading \\"actual fake news\\" rather than using the original footage. A subsequent court ruling found that the action against Acosta was unconstitutional on due process grounds. On May 2, 2019, Watson and several other people considered to be extremists, including Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan as well as Jones and right-wing commentator Milo Yiannopoulos, were permanently banned from Facebook, which called them \\"dangerous.\\" \\"We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,\\" a Facebook spokesperson said. \\"The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today.\\" Watson stated on Twitter that he had broken \\"none of their rules\\" and complained of \\"an authoritarian society controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley giants\\" in which \\"all dissent must be purged.\\" President Trump retweeted Watson mocking the \\"dangerous\\" epithet.  Views  = Immigration = Watson is anti- immigration. He has claimed that \\"Malm√∂ is known as ‚ÄòSweden‚Äôs Chicago‚Äô\\" due to mass immigration into Nordic countries. According to Salon magazine, the claim is false,Leah, Rachel (1 March 2017) \\"Infowars sponsors a journalist's trip to Malm√∂, Sweden, but he finds little evidence of a Muslim crime wave\\" Salon an assessment which is supported by a study published in Critical Studies in Media Communication.Mulinari, Leandro Schclarek (2017) \\"Contesting Sweden‚Äôs Chicago: why journalists dispute the crime image of Malm√∂\\", Critical Studies in Media Communication, v.34 n.3, pp. 206‚Äì219, = Islam = Watson is anti- Islam. He has labelled Muslim culture as \\"horrific\\" and declared that it produces mass rape, \\"Islamic ghettos\\" and the destruction of Western culture. Watson has said that the western world needs \\"Islam control\\" rather than gun control. Watson wrote in an InfoWars article that \\"Muslims living in both the Middle East and the west show alarmingly high levels of support for violent jihad.\\" He stated that there is \\"violent oppression of gays and Christians in the Middle East\\". In August 2017, he said that YouTube had blocked monetisation on all his videos about Islam, as part of the website's policies dealing with hate speech, and on other subjects including modern art. = Race and ethnicity = Watson has criticised perceived racial tokenism. In 2017, he criticised the BBC for \\"portraying Roman Britain as ethnically diverse\\", after the broadcaster included a black Roman centurion in an educational cartoon. His assertions were contradicted by Mary Beard and Cambridge's Faculty of Classics, citing \\"overwhelming\\" evidence that Roman Britain was a \\"multi ethnic society,\\" but noting that this would have been more noticeable in a military or urban setting than a rural one and the \\"significant gaps\\" in historians' understanding of the topic.

Established by Clifton and Alma Washington at 35 N. Kentucky Avenue, Atlantic City, in 1937, the original 20-seat location attained celebrity status for hosting the performers and patrons of the nightclubs in the Kentucky Avenue black entertainment district. The restaurant was known for its sausage sandwiches and soul food, and also served breakfast to customers leaving the 6 a.m. show at Club Harlem. In the 1950s Clifton Washington moved the restaurant a few blocks away to 1702 Arctic Avenue, where it was renamed Wash & Sons' Seafood Restaurant and specialized in seafood, barbecued ribs, and fried chicken. This larger venue, seating over 100, continued to attract both black and white nightclub guests and was also popular with black hotel employees leaving their shifts. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work. With the commercial downturn in Atlantic City in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Wash's relocated to 128 N. New Road in Pleasantville in 1974. Renamed Wash's Inn and Wash's Catering, the business now focused on catering on-site events and also operated a small dining room, take-out deli, and bar. With the 1994 addition of a large catering hall, the facility hosted hundreds of private parties and community events. The family put the business up for sale in 2010 and closed it in 2012. History =Kentucky Avenue= Wash's Restaurant was founded by Clifton and Alma Washington, who moved from Virginia to Atlantic City in 1925 shortly after their marriage. The young couple moved into Atlantic City's Northside, home to black families in the racially segregated city since World War I, and raised seven children. In 1937 they decided to enter the restaurant business and opened Wash's Restaurant at 35 N. Kentucky Avenue. The restaurant's name was a short form of the family name Washington. The family name came from Clifton's early-19th-century ancestor, a slave in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, who changed his surname to Washington after his emancipation. While Clifton operated a jitney, Alma managed the sandwich shop in the mornings and was assisted by her sons after school and on weekends. Alma prepared most of the food on-site. The restaurant began by selling sausage sandwiches, hot dogs, five-cent milkshakes, one-cent cigarettes, and candy. Breakfast fare of bacon and eggs was served to guests leaving Club Harlem's 6 a.m. show. Soul food entrees were added after customers saw Alma preparing beef stew or chicken and dumplings for her family and asked if they could buy that too. Though it had only six tables, with maximum seating for 20, the restaurant became a popular venue for the entertainers and guests attending the Kentucky Avenue nightclubs, including Club Harlem, the Paradise Club, and Grace's Little Belmont. Among the entertainers who ate at the restaurant after their sets ended were Redd Foxx, Nipsey Russell, Count Basie, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Moms Mabley. In the 1950s Washington's sons broke an outside wall to create a take- out window for fried chicken and seafood meals. =Arctic Avenue= By the 1950s the business had outgrown its space. The Washingtons rented a larger location with an industrial kitchen a few blocks away at 1702 Arctic Avenue. The restaurant was renamed Wash & Sons' Seafood Restaurant and sported large picture windows; the interior had a seashell motif, flower boxes, and placemats with beach scenes. Industrial ceiling fans cooled off the dining area. By the summer of 1953 the new restaurant had been completely renovated and could seat more than 100 customers. Soul food specialties included seafood, barbecued ribs, fried chicken, and sweet potato pie, as well as a full breakfast menu including bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, grits, and home fries. Washington's children and grandchildren all worked in the restaurant from a young age, and those who married into the family were also put to work. The standard pay for family members was $35 a week; they could make another $100 or more per week in tips, especially during the night shifts. During the summer tourist season, Raheem recalled: > The adult males would work their permanent eight-hour day jobs and arrive at > the restaurant in time to eat dinner before the extremely busy night shift. > The adult females would run the day shift as cooks, cashiers and hostesses, > then return home in the evening to tend to their houses and children. Other > family, friends and neighbors worked as pantry help, busboys, dishwashers, > waiters and waitresses. By day the restaurant hosted families and tourists before they spent the day at the beach or boardwalk. By night it welcomed the nightclub set, including free-spending parties of 15 to 20, and was also popular with black hotel employees after their shifts. It was a favorite of black and white customers alike. The restaurant weathered a downturn beginning in the late 1960s, when many black-owned businesses in Atlantic City were closing. It closed in 1974. =Pleasantville= Wash's reopened as a restaurant, bar, and catering facility in Pleasantville, New Jersey, in 1974. Renamed Wash's Inn, it primarily focused on catering in-house dinners and parties, and also had a take-out deli. The catering menu featured the same soul food offerings as the Atlantic City restaurant ‚Äì seafood, barbecued ribs, and fried chicken. As the Washington family continued to expand, sons- and daughters-in-law were enlisted to work on nights and weekends. In 1994 the site underwent renovations, adding a catering hall. This hall went on to host \\"[h]undreds of birthday parties, wedding receptions, family reunions, repasts, anniversary parties, baby showers, weddings, bridal showers, even political rallies, jazz and theatre performances\\". It also hosted Quincea√±eras and Latino music and dance performances, and served as a community center for \\"concerts, poetry readings, scholarship luncheons, dance recitals, political fundraisers and rallies\\". Between 2002 and 2012 four homicides were committed on the restaurant's premises, including a November 2007 shooting, a May 2009 early- morning killing, and a January 2012 fatal beating. Closure In June 2010 the five partners in the business, four of them descendants of the original owners, put the business up for sale with an asking price of $800,000. In November 2012 the family closed the restaurant for good. Legacy In 2009 Turiya S.A. Raheem, a granddaughter of Clifton and Alma Washington, published a memoir of the family business titled Growing Up in the Other Atlantic City: Wash's and the Northside.

She made her first appearance during the twelfth series episode \\"Give My Love to Esme\\", which was broadcast on 11 September 1997. Tina was introduced as a staff nurse in Holby City Hospital's emergency department. Goose was tempted to give up acting when she attended the audition for the part. It marked her first major television role. Goose spent a day at a real-life hospital while researching her character's occupation. Tina was portrayed as being feisty, bubbly, confident, and a bit naive. A notable storyline arc for the character was her rape at the hands of a patient's husband. Producers hoped the plot would raise awareness of the dangers nurses face at work, as well as increase ratings. Goose wanted Tina to be given a love interest to show her continuing recovery from the assault, and Tina begins a relationship with senior house officer Sean Maddox (Gerald Kyd). He later has an affair with Tina's best friend Chloe Hill (Jan Anderson), which results in her pregnancy. Goose chose to leave her role in 1999, and she made her final appearance in the fourteenth series episode \\"Being There ‚Äì Part 2\\" on 25 March 2000. Tina leaves Holby to reunite with Sean in Australia. For her portrayal of Tina, Goose earned a nomination for Best Newcomer at the National Television Awards. Her introduction also led to improved ratings for the show. Goose was praised for her performance during Tina's rape storyline, but her exit was branded \\"nonsense\\" by a television critic. Storylines Tina replaces Jude Kocarnik (Lisa Coleman) as a staff nurse in the emergency department (ED) at Holby City Hospital. She befriends fellow nurse Sam Colloby (Jonathan Kerrigan) and porter Sunny (Vincenzo Pellegrino), who develops a crush on her. Receptionist Amy Howard (Rebecca Wheatley) arranges a blind date for Sunny and Tina, but she does not tell them who they are meeting. While Tina treats Edmund White (Richard Hope), a patient brought in with his wife June (Elizabeth Berrington), who has suffered a fall, he talks to Tina about his marriage problems. Eve Montgomery (Barbara Marten) reprimands Tina for getting too involved and Tina advises Edmund to speak to a counsellor. As Tina is leaving the hospital at the end of her shift, Edmund tells her he will not be able to cope with June's paralysis. Tina replies that he should go and speak with the charge nurse, which angers Edmund. He then drags Tina into the toilets and rapes her. When Tina returns to work, Sam notices bruises on her wrist and she tells him she was robbed. Tina struggles to treat Sunny's sister Karen (Angela Lonsdale), after she is beaten by her boyfriend. Tina takes Karen to the toilets, but panics and leaves her there. Eve questions Tina about her behaviour and Tina eventually tells her she was raped. The rest of the staff find out and Eve takes her home. Tina decides to press charges against Edmund, but Eve learns the security cameras were not working, so there is little evidence. Tina moves in with Sam and Sunny, and later with new nurse Chloe (Jan Anderson). During their house warming party, Tina meets Sean Maddox (Gerald Kyd). She supports him when he is sued for negligence and they begin dating. Tina briefly breaks up with Sean, thinking they want different things, but they reconcile and Tina agrees to move in with him. However, Tina later learns Sean and Chloe had an affair, and Chloe is pregnant. Tina and Sunny visit Sam in Cornwell, where he is recovering from injuries sustained in a fall. They convince him to come back to Holby, but they are involved in a bus crash on the way. Tina accepts Sam's decision to leave the hospital. Duffy (Cathy Shipton) informs Tina that Chloe is having an abortion, and Tina offers to drive Chloe to the hospital. Tina also begins talking to Sean again. She takes part in a charity parachute jump with consultant Max Gallagher (Robert Gwilym). They kiss and begin a relationship, but have trouble telling Sean. He later walks in on them kissing and the men fight. Tina realises she still has feelings for Sean, but struggles to tell Max because he is grieving for his son, so she dates them both. Tina learns Sean is leaving for Australia and she races to the train station, where she finds Sean and asks him to marry her. Tina decides to leave Holby to be with Sean. She flies to Alice Springs and meets Byron (John Gibson), who tells her Sean is working with his daughter Katie (Maya Stange). On the way to meet him, Byron blacks out and crashes the car. Tina goes in search of help and collapses due to dehydration. Sean and Katie find Byron and later Tina. Sean proposes and Tina accepts. She calls the hospital and apologises to Max, who tells the staff Sean and Tina are getting married. Casting Actress Claire Goose attended an audition for the role of Tina at a time when she was tempted to give up acting. She remarked to the casting director that she seemed to get down to the last two for the parts she auditioned for, but was never successful. The casting director told her things would soon change and she was later offered the role of Tina. Tina marked her first major television role. Goose admitted that she had wanted to appear in Casualty since she was a young girl. Her father was a doctor, so she felt comfortable with the medical terms and was able to ask him for help when she needed something explained to her. Goose's father also arranged for her to spend the day at a hospital in King's Lynn, so she could research her character's occupation. Producers were impressed with Goose's performance and asked her to return for the following series. Development =Characterisation= Tina was initially billed as \\"over-keen\\" and clumsy, but \\"a promising member of staff\\". Of her role within the emergency department, Goose said \\"Although she's the lowest grade of nurse, she tends to make decisions herself rather than ask those above her. She keeps on getting into trouble with those above, her. But she isn't jaded or cynical so I hope the viewers will take to her.\\" Tina did not receive any support from her parents, making her \\"determined and headstrong\\". Goose shared some similarities with her character, as they were both independent and enthusiastic. The actress continued, \\"she's young and a bit naive but still speaks her mind and is very determined. I'm like that.\\" Goose did not think Tina's uniform was sexy or flattering, describing it as \\"functional and comfy\\". The uniforms were later updated and changed to green scrubs, which Goose said was \\"far more comfortable and practical\\". She also thought the nurses looked more efficient. During her tenure, Tina's personality changed and she became more resilient and confident. Goose stated that Tina \\"bounces back from whatever's thrown at her\\", making her more fun to play. =Rape= Tina was raped in the hospital by Edmund White, played by Richard Hope (pictured). Towards the end of series 12, Tina's first major storyline arc began as she was raped by a patient's husband. When the producers informed Goose she was getting the dramatic storyline, she was not \\"daunted\\" and instead used the opportunity to show her skills as an actress. Goose immediately undertook research for the storyline, before the writers had a chance to script it. She spent a total of six months researching the topic. She also spoke with rape counsellors ahead of filming, which lasted for a month. Producers hoped the four-part storyline would increase ratings and raise awareness of the dangers nurses face at work from similar attacks. The storyline also dealt with the issue of government cuts, as the \\"cash-strapped\\" hospital's CCTV fails to capture Tina's assault. Tina is dragged into the hospital toilets and raped by Edmund White (Richard Hope). Goose called him \\"a particularly nasty\\" type of rapist, as he also uses emotional violence and threats to terrorise her. The actress said, \\"It's a revenge thing. They seem like regular, nice kind of people. You wouldn't expect them to be like that.\\" Following the assault, Tina goes into denial and initially tells her colleagues that she has been robbed. Goose explained that Tina tries to cope with her ordeal alone, as she feels that she had \\"let everyone down\\". She also feels that she has lost control and does not want her friends to attempt to put her \\"back together again\\". Gavin Docherty of the Sunday Mail observed that Tina's behaviour was typical, as many women were worried that the police and court procedures after reporting an assault would be degrading. Goose admitted she struggled to \\"switch off\\" after a day filming the storyline, saying \\"I was never out of it. I was a lot more introverted and felt quite withdrawn.\\" After the storyline aired, she received letters from real-life rape victims and she replied to them all offering her support. Tina eventually tells fellow nurse Eve Montgomery (Barbara Marten) about her ordeal. Goose hoped Tina would be able to get over her assault and emerge stronger. During the following series, Tina was shown to be rebuilding her life and becoming her bubbly self once more. =Relationship with Sean Maddox= As the rape storyline concluded, Goose teased a potential romance for her character. The actress had suggested Tina was given a love interest, as she wanted to show that it is part of recovering from an assault. Tina later begins a relationship with senior house officer Sean Maddox (Gerald Kyd). He is the first person she has sex with following her rape. A love triangle develops when Sean has an affair with Tina's best friend Chloe Hill (Jan Anderson). At the end of the thirteenth series, Tina discovers Sean has gotten Chloe pregnant. Goose told Wendy Granditer of Inside Soap that Tina feels \\"totally betrayed\\" by Sean and Chloe, but instead of getting upset, she begins acting aggressively towards the pair. Goose was pleased with the changes to Tina's personality during the storyline, saying \\"When she first started in the show she was bubbly, but that was all. Now I get the chance to show another side to her, the bitchy side that comes out when she finds out about Sean and Chloe.\\" The actress admitted that when she played Tina's new \\"no-nonsense\\" side, she got a bit bored shouting all the time, so she asked the directors if she could change things to avoid the audience growing tired of Tina behaviour. Tina rejects both Chloe and Sean in the wake of her discovery. While Sean fights for his relationship with Tina, Chloe struggles with whether to keep the baby or not. Tina also has to cope with the situation on her own, as her confidant and fellow nurse Sam Colloby (Jonathan Kerrigan) fights for his life, after being pushed over a balcony. Tina later visits Sam in Cornwall, where he is recovering, and learns that he does not want to return to the hospital. Tina misses having Sam around to talk to, and Goose commented, \\"It's like her whole world is falling apart.\\" The actress was pleased to be a part of the long-running storyline. She admitted that she was unsure how she would react if she was in a similar situation as Tina, but thought she would regain her confidence and continue on. When Tina learns that Chloe is having an abortion, she supports her through it and they reconnect. Tina also dates consultant Max Gallagher (Robert Gwilym), despite still having feelings for Sean. =Departure= In December 1999, Goose announced her intentions to leave the show the following year. Her decision to leave was influenced by the arrival of younger cast members, and the departures of her co-stars and friends Rebecca Lacey and Jonathan Kerrigan. She commented, \\"I've been left alone. It's a different dynamic now, but it's still fun. I seem to always be in male company these days and I'm desperate for a girly night out.\\" Tina departure storyline was \\"unusual\\", as it was filmed in Australia. During the shoot, Goose feared being bitten by a scorpion or venomous snake. After learning from Max that Sean was leaving Holby, Tina realises that she loves him and proposes to him as his train leaves the station. She then decides to follow Sean to Australia, but she is unsure of his location. Tina soon becomes stranded in the outback and falls unconscious from dehydration. Sean rescues her and they later call the hospital to inform everyone that they are getting married. Maddox reprised his role in 2006. Sean was \\"bitter\\" upon his return, as he and Tina had separated and he rarely saw their child. Reception For her portrayal of Tina, Goose received a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 4th National Television Awards in 1998. Her introduction led to improved ratings for the show, particularly among the younger male viewers; Jane Oddy of the Daily Mirror observed Tina had \\"injected much-needed glamour into Holby City Hospital's accident and emergency room.\\" She also called her a \\"quirky, idealistic staff nurse\\". Oddy's colleague Thomas Quinn branded her a \\"demure yet troubled nurse\\". Kathleen Morgan of the Daily Record said Goose gave a \\"powerful performance\\" during Tina's rape storyline, which \\"produced some of the medical drama's most moving scenes to date\\". The Sunday Mail's Gavin Docherty called the storyline \\"the most harrowing the series has ever tackled\\". He also dubbed Tina \\"the caring face of Holby General.\\" John Russell of The Sunday People branded Tina a \\"sex-crazed nurse\\". When she and Sean left for Australian, Russell quipped \\"who can blame them?\\" He also called the Australia storyline \\"nonsense\\", and stated \\"Birdbrain of the week was scrumptious Tina who turned up in Australia panting for Sean in last night's Casualty and ended up lost in the Outback as dinner for a dingo.\\" Rick Fulton of the Daily Record found the conclusion to the storyline \\"a bit of an anti-climax\\", and pointed out that Tina was \\"up and looking like a million dollars\\" shortly after Sean found her. Fulton's colleague Jan Patience observed Goose \\"captured the hearts of millions\\" as Tina. Fifteen years after her departure from the show, Goose was still being recognised as Tina, which she thought was \\"extraordinary\\". The Daily Mirror's Emma Chadwick included Goose in her 2016 feature about \\"the pin-ups\\" of Casualty. She also dubbed Tina a \\"sexy nurse\\".

The album garnered positive reviews from critics. Double Dare spawned three singles: \\"Stupid for You\\", \\"Hawaii (Stay Awake)\\" and \\"Royal\\". Promotion On August 31, 2016, Waterparks revealed the album's title, artwork, and release date via social media and released the first single from the record, 'Stupid for You'. The first track, \\"Hawaii (Stay Awake)\\", premiered on September 30 on the Sirius XM Hits1 Pete Wentz's Hits and Misses Show and was released on October 3. On August 1, 2017, the band announced via their Twitter account that they joined Monster Energy's Outbreak Tour series with their Made in America Tour, with As It Is, Chapel and Sleep On It as their opening acts. Critical reception Mackenzie Hall of Alternative Press praised the album for combining \\"old- school Hellogoodbye electronic-pop\\" with hip hop music. Hall also compared the work to Twenty One Pilots. Reagan Harrison of The Young Folks gave praise to the genre-hopping style the band used for their pop punk soundscape throughout the album and the lyrical content having \\"deep topics\\" that deliver their messages with a \\"rebellious spirit\\", concluding that, \\"[T]he originality of the band should not be questioned. Even though their music includes multiple styles, it doesn't mean they don't have their own style. As the band grows, I expect for their tone to solidify and music style to become more definitive.\\" Danny Randon of Upset praised the band for crafting energetic bangers (\\"Stupid for You, \\"Made in America\\") and arena rockers (\\"Gloom Boys\\", \\"Dizzy\\") that showcase their potential, concluding that, \\"[I]t may be sicklier than devouring a sherbet fountain in one near-suicidal necking, but there's enough chutzpah in the hooks to balance out the sweetness. Even in creating further opportunities to make waves, Waterparks have delivered on the promise of a big splash.\\" Dork writer Steven Loftin called the record an \\"over-the-top but fun [nonetheless] listen\\", praising the band's self-awareness on tracks like \\"Made in America\\" and \\"Little Violence\\" but was critical of their venture into EDM on \\"Take Her to the Moon\\" being too removed from the rest of the album, concluding that \\"Double Dare is a solid debut that more than makes up for the misses with the hits.

Reception  In a starred review, Publishers Weekly noted Matsumoto's ability for showing how people relate to each other and his simple style which uses sound effects, saying \\"much of the emotional resonance comes from silence and images\\". Shea Hennum of The A.V. Club called the manga \\"engrossing and deeply moving\\", complimenting the coherency of the anthology and concluding that \\"Matsumoto's aesthetic and narrative style simultaneously push and pull on the reader, forcing you to confront the universal themes of alienation, ennui, and emotional distance.\\" The French edition of Cigarette Girl was nominated at the 2011 Angoul√™me International Comics Festival for \\"Best Heritage Comic\\".

History The park is named after the former settlement of Preparation, Iowa, that was located here. It was established in the 1850s by Charles B. Thompson and his followers. They were Mormons who had left the wagon trains heading west to Utah. They believed that their existence in this life was preparation for the world to come, therefore they named their community \\"Preparation.\\" A property dispute between Thompson and his followers, who were instructed to call him \\"Father Ephraim\\" after the Biblical figure of the same name, had to be settled by the Iowa Supreme Court and Thompson fled the state. At one time the town had 67 houses, a post office, skating rink, and blacksmith shop, but by the turn of the 20th century the town had been deserted except for the stockyard, which closed in 1946. Walter and Martha Perrin, who were descended from the original Mormons, sold the first for the park to the state of Iowa in 1934.

He commanded his tribesmen in Aisha's army during the First Muslim Civil War, and later served as the Umayyad governor of Jund Qinnasrin. In 684, during the Second Fitna, he supported Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr's bid to wrest the caliphate from the Umayyads. Afterward, he based himself in al-Qarqisiyah (Circesium) and led the Qays tribes against the Yaman, launching several raids against the latter in the Syrian Desert. By 688‚Äì689, he also became entangled in a conflict with the Banu Taghlib. Zufar made peace with the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik in 691 by abandoning Ibn al-Zubayr's cause in return for stately and military privileges. During the reigns of Abd al-Malik's successors, Zufar and his family maintained their high-ranking positions in the Umayyad government. Early career Zufar belonged to the 'Amr branch of the Banu Kilab, which itself was a major branch of the large Arab tribe of Banu 'Amir.Zakkar 1971, p. 74. The 'Amr branch was known to be one of the more militant and warlike divisions of the Banu Kilab. Zufar's father was al-Harith ibn Yazid al-'Amiri, who participated in the Muslim conquest of Hit and al-Qarqisiyah (Circesium) in the mid-630s.Crone 1980, p. 108. Prior to the First Muslim Civil War (656‚Äì661), Zufar settled in Basra. At the Battle of the Camel in November 656, he fought alongside Aisha's forces and commanded troops from the Banu 'Amir. He also participated in the Battle of Siffin in 657. Sometime later during the war, he migrated to Upper Mesopotamia (al-Jazira). During the reign of Umayyad caliph, Yazid I (680‚Äì683), Zufar served as a commander in Muslim ibn Uqba's army in its 683 campaign to quash a rebellion in the Hejaz; the rebellion was in support of Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr's bid for the caliphate. Zufar is also said to have met with Ibn al-Zubayr in the Hejaz at that time. Rebellion against the Umayyads The deaths of Yazid and his successor Mu'awiyah II in 683 and 684, respectively, amid the revolt of Ibn Zubayr, left the Umayyad Caliphate in political disarray.Kennedy 2004, pp. 78‚Äì79. At this point, Zufar was apparently governor of Jund Qinnasrin, encompassing northern Syria.Al- Tabari, ed. Hawting 1989, p. 49. He may have seized this command after rallying his Qaysi allies and evicting Qinnasrin's previous governor, who came from the Banu Kalb tribe; the latter was the leading component of the Yaman faction, rivals of the Qays.Brockelmann 1960, p. 77. In any case, Zufar was in charge of Jund Qinnasrin in the aftermath of Mu'awiyah II's death, defected from the Umayyads and gave allegiance to Ibn al-Zubayr. While Qaysi chieftains began leaning towards supporting Ibn Zubayr, the leaders of the Yaman sought to ensure continued Umayyad rule and nominated Marwan I to assume the caliphate. The Qays under al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri challenged the Umayyad‚ÄìYaman alliance at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684. Some traditions hold that Zufar himself participated in this battle, but this is dismissed by the historians Ya'qubi and Awana ibn al-Hakam; al-Tabari holds that Zufar dispatched troops from the Qinnasrin garrison to join Dahhak's forces near Damascus.Tabari, ed. Hawting 1989, p. 56. Moreover, al-Tabari writes that when news that al-Dahhak and numerous Qaysi chieftains had been killed and the Qays routed, Zufar fled Qinnasrin to al-Qarqisiyah.Tabari, ed. Hawting 1989, p. 63. The town's Umayyad governor Iyad al-Jurashi initially refused entry to Zufar, who responded \\"I promise you on pain of having to divorce my wives and set free my slaves that once I have entered its bath I will leave the town.\\" He subsequently gained entry with his men and ousted Iyad. =Leader of the Qays= Al-Qarqisiyah was fortified by Zufar and from there he assumed preeminent leadership of the battered, but still powerful, Qaysi tribes, while maintaining his recognition of Ibn al-Zubayr as caliph.Kennedy 2004, p. 81. According to historian Patricia Crone, Zufar and his family \\"were considered to be the very incarnation of Qaysiyya\\". The Battle of Marj Rahit opened a bloody phase in the previously benign Qays‚ÄìYaman rivalry as the Qays sought vengeance for their heavy losses.Kennedy 2004, p. 80. This phase in the conflict was characterized by tit-for-tat raids known as ayyam (days) because each raid was typically a day long. The dates of these raids were not recorded, but Zufar led the first raid in an attack that killed twenty Kalb tribesmen at a place called Musaiyakh in the Syrian Desert soon after setting himself up in al-Qarqisiyah.Wellhausen, p. 202. The Banu Kalb retaliated by killing sixty men from the Banu Numayr sub-tribe of the Banu 'Amir in Palmyra. This prompted an attack by Zufar at a place called Iklil that ended with the deaths of 500‚Äì1,000 Kalbi tribesmen and Zufar's escape to al-Qarqisiyah unscathed. By circa 686, Zufar's participation in the Qaysi‚ÄìYamani conflict in the Syrian Desert was highly restricted by persistent campaigns against his safe haven at al-Qarqisiyah by the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685‚Äì705); Zufar was replaced in this regard by Umayr ibn al-Hubab of the Banu Sulaym.Wellhausen 1927, p. 203. Umayr's Sulaymi tribesmen began encroaching on the lands of the Banu Taghlib along the northern Khabur Valley, prompting the Banu Taghlib to request Zufar intervene and force the Banu Sulaym to withdraw from the area. Not wanting to push the neutral and Christian Banu Taghlib into joining the Umayyad‚ÄìYamani cause, Zufar attempted but failed to calm the situation.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 203‚Äì204. Umayr opened hostilities against the Banu Taghlib in a number of punishing raids in Upper Mesopotamia, and dragged Zufar into assisting him in some of these clashes.Wellhausen 1927, p. 204. Umayr was killed by the Banu Taghlib in 689, obliging Zufar to avenge his death. To that end, Zufar attacked a Taghlibi camp at the northern Tigris River town of Kuhail and executed two hundred Taghlibi captives taken in that raid.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 204‚Äì205. Referencing this event, the poet Jarir taunted his Taghlibi rival al-Akhtal, stating: > The warriors of Qays bore down on you with steeds > Ungroomed and grim-faced, [their backs] bearing heroes > You kept thinking everything after them > Was steeds and men charging over and over > Zufar Abu al-Hudhayl, their chieftain, annihilated you[r men] > Then captured your women and plundered your herds.Stetkevych 2002, p. 112. > ‚Äî Jarir ibn Atiyah taunting the Taghlibi poet al-Akhtal in the Umayyad > court in 692. Reconciliation with the Umayyads In 691, Zufar was compelled to negotiate a peace with Abd al-Malik, who had consolidated his strength by then.Kennedy 2004, p. 84. Per their agreement, Zufar abandoned Ibn al-Zubayr's cause in return for a high position in the Umayyad royal court and army. This effectively broke the Yamani monopoly on the Syrian military, and with the collapse of Ibn al-Zubayr's revolt by 692, put an end to Zufar's war with the Banu Kalb and Banu Taghlib.Wellhausen 1927, p. 205. According to the Orientalist Julius Wellhausen, Zufar and later his sons Hudhayl and Kawthar were \\"amongst the most eminent and notable people at the court of Damascus\\".Wellhausen 1927, p. 211. Later life and descendants Zufar's estate in Qinnasrin was near a fortress at al-Na'ura, downstream of Balis on the Euphrates, which was the residence of Abd al-Malik's son, Maslama (d. 728). Strong ties were established between the families of Zufar and Maslama. The latter married the former's daughter, while Zufar's eldest son Hudhayl became a commander in Maslama's service. The sons of Zufar were supporters of the staunchly anti-Yaman Caliph Marwan II (r. 744‚Äì750), who appointed one of them, Kawthar, as governor of Mar'ash on the Byzantine‚ÄìArab frontier.Crone 1980, pp. 108‚Äì109. According to historian David S. Powers, the sons of Zufar \\"inherited the respect accorded to him. They too were held in high esteem by the caliphs.\\"Tabari, ed. Fishbein 1990, p. 185. Zufar's grandsons Majza'a ibn Kawthar and Wathiq ibn Hudhayl were among Marwan II's top aides, but following Marwan II's defeat at the Battle of Zab in 750, they submitted to the Abbasid Caliphate.Crone 1980, p. 109. However, later that year, Majza'a led a Qaysi revolt against the Abbasids and was killed.

This simple, but beautiful home has been the residence of one of the earliest merchants in the city of Laurens, American Civil War veterans, a prominent lawyer and legislator, and their families. It is a key contributing resource for the South Harper Historic District.  The Hix Family residence  The house was likely built by Edward Hix (1792 ‚Äì 1882), a veteran of the War of 1812 and a native Virginian. After spending some time in Union County, South Carolina, Edward bought the lot where the house is located from Robert Cresswell in January 1818. Cresswell was a prominent citizen, not just of Laurens, but of the state, having served as Lt. Governor from 1814 to 1816 (Lieutenant Governors of South Carolina). Hix himself was a coach and wagon manufacturer, and he also operated a furniture factory and grist mill on Hix Creek, just below the site of the house near the present-day Laurens County Emergency Services Complex, also on South Harper Street. It is not known exactly when the house was constructed. It is possible that the house predates the purchase of the lot on which it sits by the Hix family. The deed recording the property transfer and describing the premises states that there was a \\"small house built on the said lott (sic) by James Bruster.\\" However, it is currently believed that this may refer to an older, smaller dwelling which, according to Sanborne Fire Insurance maps was present in 1906 but had been demolished by 1912. However, it is clear that the house had been built and established well before 1849. In an advertisement in The Laurensville Herald dated August 17, 1849, Edward Hix offers to sell a \\"valuable and desirable house and lot in the Village of Laurens containing two acres with a good well of water with all necessary outbuildings.\\" Apparently Edward Hix was not able to find a suitable buyer for the property, and the house remained in the Hix family for another generation. In addition to his contributions as a veteran and carriage maker, Edward Hix served as one of the first Aldermen of the City of Laurens, serving from January 1846, just after the City was incorporated by the SC General Assembly in December 1845. One of his sons, Jesse, served as the City‚Äôs first Clerk/Treasurer.http://www.genealogytrails.com/scar/laurens/ordinances.htm The house was also the home of Edward's sons: Edward Melville Hix And Jesse Scott Hix, and William Preston Hix. While Preston \\"Press\\" Hix may not have remained in Laurens, he may be the most unusual of the brothers. As a young man, before the Civil War, he became an accomplished artist, winning local awards for his pictures. He served in the Third South Carolina Infantry, and after being discharged, he worked for a photographer in Columbia, South Carolina, taking photographs and using his portrait skills to colorize them. He eventually became a partner in this firm, known as Wearn & Hix. One of his most famous photographs is that of Robert Smalls, leader of a slave rebellion and United States Congressman from South Carolina following the Civil War. This portrait is now kept in the National Gallery in Washington, D.C. His portraiture skills eventually allowed him to move north to New York and befriend prominent national figures, including Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, of whom he painted a full- length portrait.https://civilwartalk.com/threads/the-angel-of- marye%E2%80%99s-heights.167413/page-2 While in New York, he became acquainted with Thomas Edison, eventually becoming a trusted friend and business associate. He worked as an agent for the Edison Company, and was responsible for the installation of a $2 million dollar lighting system for the city of Philadelphia in 1884. While their younger brother Preston painted portraits, Edward M. and Jesse worked in the family business, manufacturing wagons, buggies, carriages, as well as mantels, window sashes, and other furniture items. This family business venture is significant because it represents the coming of the industrial age to this small South Carolina town. The Laurensville Herald of December 20, 1850 reports that Edward Hix (the elder) had \\"purchased the lot behind Mr. S. R. Todd's store from Saxon and Farley and is erecting a steam saw and gristmill.\\" By January 17, 1851, the paper reported that Hix, who had again been elected a \\"Warden of Laurensville,\\" had \\"purchased the necessary material and machinery and is erecting buildings to put up a steam factory on the lot below Mr. Todd's store consisting of a sawmill, gristmill, planing and mortising machine and a variety of other smaller machines.\\" The Herald goes on to editorialize a bit, stating, \\"It will not be long before the dark smoke of the steam horse will be peering aloft over our hitherto quiet little village.\\" These two brothers purchased the business and other property from their father on May 24, 1869. Edward M. Hix (1832-1905), who owned his own house on West Main Street in Laurens (near the site of the present-day First United Methodist Church) eventually moved to Johnston, South Carolina, and was the fourth settler of that town. His departure from Laurens left Jesse Hix (1826-1905) in the South Harper house with his family. Jesse's first wife, Mary Helen Hix, died in 1881, and the couple was childless at that time. However, he was soon remarried to Clara Harlow Boyd (1863-1952), and the couple raised five children in the home. Jesse remained in the house until his death in March 1905, and at the time of his death he was the oldest resident of Laurens. Jesse and Harlow's daughter, Jessie, married Augustus Mahafee, a grocer who operated a store on the Laurens Public Square. Jessie and Augustus and their children remained in the home with Harlow Hix until 1918, when they moved to a newer residence on West Main Street and sold the home to Homer S. Blackwell and his wife. Hix-Blackwell House, front facade showing Blackwell sun-room addition 371x371px  The Blackwell Family Residence & Beyond  Second owner of the house was Homer S. Blackwell, a prominent lawyer and state solicitor and member of the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1913 to 1914. With a growing law practice located in the original Palmetto Bank Building (ca. 1904) and having served in the State House of Representatives, Blackwell and his wife were able to purchase the historic home of the Hix family. As a young couple, they earned money on the side by taking in boarders, as evidenced by the presence of two boarders in their home at the time of the 1920 Federal census. Blackwell and his wife, Jeannie, raised a family in the home and were active members in the community as he grew to become a respected member of the Laurens Bar and she taught school. During the time the Blackwell's owned the home, Homer Blackwell was involved in the aftermath of the notorious lynching of Joe Stewart, and worked to bring to justice those who had committed this crime of hate.https://www.sennlawfirm.com/single-post/2017/04/20/Laurens- Legal-History-The-Tragedy-of-Joe-Stewart After showing character in this incident fairly early in his legal career, Blackwell continued to serve the public through the practice of law. Like the first builder and first owner of the house, Blackwell had a connection to the City of Laurens. Blackwell served as City Attorney for the City of Laurens during the late 1950s until his death in November 1960 at age 83. Jeannie Blackwell continued to live in the home until her death in 1975. At this point, and to a greater extent afterward, the home suffered from a lack of maintenance and care. It continued to fall into disrepair until the early 1990s when an attempt was made to modernize the home and repair much of the damage caused by water leaks, termites, and the passage of time. However, with the exception of removing the stoop and restoring a porch which spanned the entire front facade, the repairs made in the 1990s were not made with care and respect for the historic character of the home. Today, work is ongoing to restore the home and return it to its former beauty, respecting its place as home to one of the City of Laurens' founding families and some of the most influential figures in the city's history.  Architectural features  The house is described on the National Register of Historic Places as a \\"one-and-one-half story, frame residence, sheathed in weatherboarding. The front slope of the metal, gable roof is pierced by three pedimented, gabled dormers. The main entrance, which is centered, has double doors, sidelights, and transom. A porch which extended across the facade was removed and replaced by a gabled portico in the 1920s.\\" Hix-Blackwell House front door showing 19th c. decorative fretwork The home also has a number of other distinctive features which were not noted in the National Register description. The pedimented Pediment gabled dormers mentioned feature detailed wood fretwork, typical of the early decades of the 19th century. This wooden ornamentation is also present on the double screen doors and are likely an early, if not original, feature of the house. The interior of the home features a wide central hallway which showcases a dramatic winding staircase. The rooms on the first floor feature 12 ft. ceilings and two centrally located chimneys allow for each of the four principal first floor rooms to have its own fireplace. These fireplaces, which were originally configured to burn wood were later modified to use coal, and later blocked off altogether for use of propane/gas heaters. The frame of the house is evidence of its extreme (relative) age. The beams which support the house are milled lumber, some measuring 8\\"x12\\" and fitted together with traditional post-and-beam construction techniques and pegged together with hand-shaped pegs. During the period in which the Blackwell family owned the house, older victorian-style homes fell out of fashion and simpler colonial styling was preferred. Unfortunately, the home's original porch was removed in the 1920s, and it is likely that much of the original ornamentation which may have adorned the capitals of the porch columns and the railings was discarded. In place of the large porch, the family built a simple gabled portico which was present at the time the house was listed on the National Register in 1986. They also added a sunroom to the South side of the home. In recent years, the expansive front porch has been restored to the home so it more closely resembles its antebellum appearance, though additional restoration is required to complete the task. By 1906, it appears that the home had a kitchen on the southwest corner and a small covered porch which stood just behind the back door of the central hallway. There was also a separate, small dwelling directly behind the house as well a water well and another outbuilding (likely a stable and/or carriage shed) on the north side of the property. By 1912, the entire rear portion of the house had enclosed by an addition with a metal shed roof. This addition was likely added to provide for indoor bathroom facilities. Gone too, by 1912, was the small dwelling, which may have been the original dwelling present when the lot was sold to the Hix family in 1818. Additional study is necessary to determine the nature, location, and age of these separate structures. While the home's age has not been clearly determined, circumstantial evidence from the property transfer record, architectural features of the home, and contemporary accounts indicate that the house was likely constructed from 1818 to the early 1820s. What is certain is that the home is one of the oldest, and one of the few surviving antebellum structures in the city of Laurens.

They are commonly used in casualty insurance pricing. Overview Often, limited data is available to determine appropriate charges for high limits of insurance. In order to price policies with high limits of insurance adequately, actuaries may first determine a \\"basic limit\\" premium and then apply increased limits factors. The basic limit is a lower limit of liability under which there is a more credible amount of data. For example, basic limit loss costs or rates may be calculated for many territories and classes of business. At a relatively low limit of liability, such as $100,000, there may be a high volume of data that can be used to derive those rates. For higher limits, there may be a credible volume of data at the countrywide level but not much data available for individual territories or classes. Increased limit factors can be derived at the countrywide level (or some other broad grouping) and then applied to the basic limit rates to arrive at rates for higher limits of liability. Formula An increased limit factor (ILF) at limit L relative to basic limit B can be defined as ILF(L) = \\\\dfrac{Expected\\\\ indemnity\\\\ cost(L) + ALAE(L) + ULAE(L) + RL(L)}{Expected\\\\ indemnity\\\\ cost(B) + ALAE(B) + ULAE(B) + RL(B)} where ALAE is the allocated loss adjustment expense provision, ULAE is the unallocated loss adjustment expense provision, and RL is the risk load provision. An indemnity-only ILF can be expressed as ILF(L) = \\\\dfrac{Expected\\\\ indemnity\\\\ cost(L)}{Expected\\\\ indemnity\\\\ cost(B)} = \\\\dfrac{Expected\\\\ frequency(L) * Expected\\\\ severity(L)}{Expected\\\\ frequency(B) * Expected\\\\ severity(B)} Often, frequency is assumed to be independent of the policy limit, in which case the formula can be simplified to ILF(L) = \\\\dfrac{Expected\\\\ severity(L)}{Expected\\\\ severity(B)} The expected severity at each limit is often referred to as \\"limited average severity,\\" or LAS. Examples In the United States, many insurers use ILFs published by the Insurance Services Office, a division of Verisk.

The company has three brands Thinx, Speax and (BTWN). Thinx is underwear that can be worn during menstruation as a substitute or a supplement to traditional feminine hygiene products. Speax is underwear that can be worn for light and moderate incontinence. (BTWN) is a spin-off of the Thinx collection designed for adolescents dealing with menstruation. The underwear come in a range of styles from boyshorts to thongs, and include two patented technologies. One is to absorb different amounts of blood, and the other absorbs different amounts of urine. The underwear is anti-microbial, moisture-wicking, absorbent and leak resistant. In 2019, Thinx launched Thinx Super which is a double absorbency product that holds up to 4 tampons worth of flow. History Thinx was founded in 2011 by Antonia Saint Dunbar, Miki Agrawal and Radha Agrawal. In 2018, Thinx released a new line called BTWN which offers period underwear for teens and tweens. In June 2019, Thinx released Thinx Air, a quick drying version of its underwear. Marketing Thinx has earned a reputation for its controversial ads. In October 2015, Outfront Media rejected Thinx's subway advertisements due to the fact that the ads used the word \\"period\\" and included suggestive visuals of food. Following a social media outcry, the ads were finally allowed to be shown. In 2016, Thinx received attention for featuring trans male models in its ads for period underwear. In November 2016, Thinx launched an ad referencing the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape. The San Francisco subway banned the ads due to the use of the word \\"pussy\\". In November 2017, they created a \\"PMS truck,\\" a truck visiting three cities, allowing visitors to step inside to shop for Thinx products and talk with brand representatives regarding period health. In 2019, Thinx rolled out a national ad campaign featuring a young boy getting his first period with the tagline: ‚ÄòWhat if we all had periods?‚Äù and subsequent campaigns focused on reducing period stigma by showcasing men. These ads were banned by several TV networks including CBS for being ‚Äútoo graphic.‚Äù Reception TIME named Thinx period panties as one of the best inventions of 2015.

Soon after earning her pilot's license she also earned her commercial license.  Early life  Riddle was a member of the Clatsop Tribe in Oregon and the Quinault Indian Nation in Washington. She was the daughter of Albert \\"Doc\\" Riddell, and had two brothers, John and Valentine. Her grandmother gave her the name Kus-de-cha after noting that her cries sounded like a kingfisher's call. On the way home from school, an eleven-year-old Riddle saw her first plane and was mesmerized. From that day forward, she went to every airshow she could. When Riddle was seventeen, she saw a woman fatally crash an airplane. The incident made her determined to prove women could fly well.  Aviation career  = Pilot = Riddle saved money for two years to attend the Rankin Flying School in Portland, run by noted aviator Tex Rankin. Rankin, who also taught Chinese-American pilot Leah Hing, was interested in creating \\"a 'rainbow', all-female stunt team,\\" but Riddle declined to participate, and the idea fizzled out. She flew solo for the first time on May 10, 1930. \\"I wasn't scared,\\" said Riddle one month later. \\"On that first trip alone I just missed the weight of the instructor in the plane.\\" She featured in an airshow at the 1930 Portland Rose Festival, riding up to her plane on horseback and in \\"full tribal costume\\". Riddle was one of three female pilots in the show: the others were Dorothy Hester and Edith Foltz. In August of that year, she made plans to fly to Washington D.C. with \\"beaded gifts from Indian tribes of the Northwest\\", to be delivered to for \\"President Hoover and others\\". Riddle earned a limited commercial pilot's license in 1933. In June 1934, she was featured on the 99's magazine, The 99er. An all-around athlete, she enjoyed swimming, riding, \\"golf, tennis, and ice skating.\\" = Parachutist = Riddle later went to the Spartan School in Tulsa to learn parachute jumping. Though the school was all-male at the time, Riddle convinced them to admit her and graduated with honors. By 1937 she was performing as a parachutist while touring the United States on The Voice of Washington, advertised as the largest tri-motored plane in the world, on which she also served as chief stewardess. Press described her as quiet and charming. Riddle did forty parachute jumps. In 1937, she almost died when her parachute, which had not opened correctly, became tangled with her legs. The next year, a back injury caused her to quit parachuting. = Aircraft Inspector = World War II restrictions on civilian aircraft forced Riddle to give up flying. She began working with aluminum sheet metal as part of the U.S. Air Force's Civil Service, reasoning, \\"I just had to be near airplanes- even if I could not fly them.\\" She was recruited by the government to inspect civilian aircraft and work as an aircraft maintenance advisor. Riddle recalled, \\"I was a sort of guinea pig, really, on account of being the only woman, but I got along fine.\\"  Later life  After the war, Riddle became a receptionist at the Gibbs and Hill firm in New York City, but continued to fly on occasion and to visit the Northwest.

He was not a member of the nobility but, from 1770 to 1860, officers were allowed to use \\"von\\" with their surnames.  Biography  von Seydewitz was born in Nortorf, Denmark. He was the son of Johann Christoph Heinrich von Seydewitz (1748-1824) and Magdalena Maria Ralfs. His father was an architect and builder in the rural districts of Mecklenburg. He followed his older brother, into the Royal Danish Army when he was only fourteen. In 1796, became a f√¶ndrik (roughly equivalent to ensign) √† la suite in the Schleswig Regiment. He was promoted to First Lieutenant in 1804 and Captain in 1810. In 1816, due to cutbacks in troop strength, he was mustered out with the rank of Major. Hannemarie Ragn Jensen. Carl Christian Seydewitz, biography Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon Despite his choice of a military career, he always had a desire to be an artist. Around 1800, after some opposition by Crown Prince (later King) Frederick, he was allowed to attend classes at satellite schools of the Royal Academy. In 1803, he was awarded money from the Fonden ad usus publicos, a fund for the support of artistic and scientific endeavors. Normally, this would be used for study abroad, but he was compelled to use it locally. Later he received an additional grant and was allowed to study in Italy, where he was influenced by the works of Raphael. However, after the English Wars broke out in 1807, official duties occupied most of his time. In 1817, now a retired Major and newly married, he began to paint in earnest. His first major work was done for the Palace Building Commission. He was paid well, but his work was judged by the Royal Academy to be of little artistic value. King Frederick, wanting to make amends for his earlier opposition, ordered a large number of pieces; not only for the Royal palaces, but for church altarpieces as well. Nineteen of these went into the Royal Collection (now the National Gallery of Denmark). Many were lost during the devastating fire at Christiansborg Palace in 1884. Personal life In 1814 he became Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog. He was married in 1816 with Sophie Amalie M√∏ller (1792-1863). He died during 1857 and was buried at Garnisons Cemetery (Garnisons Kirkeg√•rd) in Copenhagen.

In 1880, lightning struck a tower, so it was necessary to make repairs. The most significant damage occurred after World War II. In 1944 the church was in a sorry state, but already during the Soviet era, the church was restored. Simultaneously with the creation of the Diocese of Siauliai on May 28, 1997, the Church of Saints Peter and Paul was elevated to the status of cathedral by Pope John Paul II.

On 10 May 1936 the church was elevated to the cathedral and this time Pope Pius XI sent a gift for safekeeping. In 1944 the cathedral was severely damaged as a result of World War II, and during the period of Soviet occupation was closed to worship and destined for another use, until 1987, when Lithuania regained its independence and religious events were reestablished.

DNOS Concepts and Facilities DNOS includes a sophisticated file management package which provides support for key indexed files, sequential files, and relative record files. DNOS is a multiterminal system that is capable of making each of several users appear to have exclusive control of the system. DNOS supports output spooling and program accessible accounting data. Job level and task level operations enable more efficient use of system resources. In addition to multiterminal applications, DNOS provides support for advanced program development. Users communicate with DNOS by entering commands at a terminal or by providing a file of commands. The System Command Interpreter (SCI) processes those commands and directs the operating system to initiate the action specified by a command. A text editor allows the user to enter source programs or data into the system. A Macro Assembler is provided for assembly language programs. Several high level languages, including Fortran, COBOL, BASIC, RPG II, and Pascal, are supported. A link editor and extended debugging facilities are also provided. A variety of utility programs and productivity tools support access to and management of information contained in a data base, design of specific forms on the screen of a video display terminal (VDT), and word processing. The system supports a wide range of user environments. DNOS can support as few as one or two terminals, thus allowing the user of a smaller System to perform tasks efficiently and yet inexpensively. Larger configurations with a wide variety of peripherals are also supported. The maximum configuration size varies with the user's environment. Almost every minicomputer system requirement or application need can be met with DNOS. DNOS provides the base for a variety of communications products. Standard protocols for IBM 2780/3780 and for IBM 3270 communications are supported. Local area network software is supported for network input/output (I/O) and logon. In addition, sophisticated networking software is available with the Distributed Network Communications System (DNCS) and Distributed Network I/O (DNIO) packages. DNCS includes networking capabilities for X.25 and IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA) protocols. DNIO provides users transparent access to other TI 990s running DNOS and can be used to connect to local or wide-area networks. DNOS is an international operating system designed to meet the commercial requirements of the United States, most European countries, and Japan. DNOS supports a complete range of international data terminals that permit users to enter, view, and process data in their own languages. The system includes error text files that can be edited so that error messages can be easily translated into languages other than English. DNOS Features DNOS supports features that incorporate the computing power of the larger computers, and it is upwardly compatible with other Texas Instruments operating systems. DNOS features include: *Multiple Terminals - The number of online terminals is limited only by the available computing power and memory for system structures. *File Security - The system can optionally include a file security system that allows system managers and other users to determine which user groups can access data files and execute specific programs. *Output Spooling - Output spooling is the process of queueing files for printing. Files are scheduled for printing based on job priority and availability of the printing device(s). You can specify special printing forms and formats. *Accounting Function - The system can optionally include an accounting function that allows you to maintain accounting information on the use of system resources. *Job Structure - The system incorporates a job structure that assists program management and enables efficient use of resources. A job is a sequence of cooperating tasks. *I/O Resource Management - Resource-specific and resource-independent I/O operations allow flexibility in the selection of devices and file types. *Program Segmentation - Program segmentation is the process of separating a program into segments. A program can consist of up to three segments at any one time. Additional segments can be accessed as necessary during program execution. Segments can be shared by programs. *Interprocess Communication - The system provides the capability, through interprocess communication (IPC), for two programs (tasks) to exchange information. *Power Failure Recovery - Should a power failure occur, DNOS maintains the state of the system at the time of the failure, if the optional software and backup power supply have been added to your system. When full power resumes, the operation will continue from the point at which the power failure occurred. *Synchronization Methods - Event and semaphore synchronization methods are included to assist interaction between programs, either within a job or across job boundaries. Event synchronization allows the program to wait for one or more events to be completed before processing is continued. Semaphore synchronization uses variables to exchange signal information between programs. *Concatenated Files - The system supports file concatenation, in which two or more physical files are recognized as a logically contiguous set of data. These files can exist on one or more volumes. *Temporary Files A temporary file is one that exists only during the life of the created job, or during the extent of a program within that job. A job temporary file can be accessed by any program in a job, and is deleted when the job terminates. Other temporary files are created for use by a single program and are deleted when the program terminates. *Diagnostic Support - The system supports online diagnostics that operate concurrently with program execution and system log analysis tasks. *Batch Jobs - A batch job is a job that executes in the background, independent of a terminal. A user at a terminal can be executing multiple batch jobs, and at the same time, be performing foreground and/or background operations in an interactive job. *Dynamic Configuration Changes - Table size, system characteristics, and device configuration changes can be enabled and take effect after the next Initial Program Load (IPL) sequence, rather than during system generation. *Compatibility - DNOS design enables compatibility with the DX10 operating system. Many of the familiar operating concepts of the DX10 operating system are integrated within the design of DNOS. DNOS includes disk and other media formats, a Supervisor Call (SVC) interface, and SCI user commands that are all upwardly compatible with DX10. *System Generation - The system generation utility allows a user to interactively specify all necessary features, available devices, and optional functions when creating an operating system. This data is used to construct a file that defines the configuration of the operating system. *Message Facilities - The system provides a comprehensive set of codes and messages describing errors and special conditions that occur when using the operating system. The system handles messages in a uniform manner to ensure that they are easy to use. Two system direc- tories maintain message files that contain text describing errors, information, and completion messages generated by the system. The directories are expandable to include message files written by users. *System Log - The system log stores information about errors and messages generated by hardware, input/output operations, tasks, and user programs on two files and an optional specified device. *Systems Problem Analysis - If problems occur during system operation, they can be diagnosed by using a system utility that can analyze the system whether the system is operating or has experienced a failure. In a failure situation, an image of memory can be copied to a file. When the system is operating again, an analysis utility can be used with a variety of commands entered by the user. *System Configuration History - Information about all supplied software products installed on a system is maintained on a system disk file. Users can also send entries to the file for application products they develop. *DNOS International Features - Error message files can be text edited to translate into a language other than English. It is also necessary to change the collating sequence of key indexed files (KIF) according to the translation. DNOS provides methods to change the required collating sequence. *DNOS Performance Package - An optional add-on package is available for DNOS on the larger 990 series computers. This package enhances DNOS performance by using several system routines implemented in microcode in the writable control storage.

Straus (November 23, 1946 ‚Äì May 14, 2007) was an American physician, immunologist, virologist and science administrator. He is particularly known for his research into human herpesviruses and chronic fatigue syndrome, and for his discovery of the autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome genetic disorder. He headed the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and served as the founding director of the NIH's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. Biography Straus was born in New York City in 1946, and grew up in Brooklyn, attending the Yeshivah of Flatbush for Elementary and High School. He attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, switching from physics to biology, and gained his BS in life sciences in 1968. He gained his MD from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1972. He subsequently trained at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, and also held a fellowship in infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis. In 1973‚Äì75, Straus researched adenoviruses as a research associate at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). He rejoined NIAID as a senior investigator in 1979, working in the Laboratory of Clinical Investigation. He rose to head first the medical virology section and then, from 1991, the entire laboratory. In October 1999, Straus was appointed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)'s first director (while continuing his work at NIAID), a position he held until November 2006. Straus served on the Institute of Medicine's Clinical Research Roundtable and the NIH Steering Committee. He chaired the NIH Committee on the Recruitment and Career Development of Clinical Investigators, as well as multiple committees associated with the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research. He also advised the NIH director, Elias Zerhouni. He was on the editorial boards of the academic journals Journal of Virology and Virology, and co-edited several textbooks, including Fields Virology. Research Electron micrograph of varicella zoster virus, one of the herpesviruses that Straus studied =Herpesviral and other viral diseases= Straus is particularly known for his wide-ranging research on herpesviruses that infect humans, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus (EBV). His studies included herpesvirus pathogenesis, immune responses and transmission, as well as antiviral drugs and vaccines. He researched the mechanisms by which HSV establishes latency and later recurs. His group was one of the first to show that treating patients with the antiviral acyclovir can prevent genital and oral herpes from recurring. He found that people with asymptomatic genital herpes can transmit the virus to their sexual partners. With Lawrence Corey and David M. Knipe, Straus developed prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HSV, including a glycoprotein subunit vaccine. With William Ruyechan and John Hay, Straus cloned VZV and mapped its genome. They showed that chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (herpes zoster) are both caused by this virus. Straus also studied the persistent pain that can occur after shingles has cleared up. He worked with Mike Oxman and Myron Levin on the Shingles Prevention Study, a large clinical trial which demonstrated that a live- attenuated VZV vaccine is effective against shingles. Straus discovered that infection with EBV very occasionally results in a life-threatening chronic progressive disease, now called chronic active EBV infection. Other viral diseases Straus worked on include HIV/AIDS, influenza and chronic hepatitis B. He also researched Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia bacteria. =Chronic fatigue syndrome= Straus started to research what is now known as chronic fatigue syndrome in 1979. Working on the then-current hypothesis that the syndrome might be caused by EBV, he started a clinical trial of acyclovir therapy in 1984. Although the study showed no benefit from the drug, it provided evidence that EBV did not cause the syndrome. In 1988, Straus was one of a group of physicians to propose the name \\"chronic fatigue syndrome\\" for the condition, and was subsequently one of the lead authors of the International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group's guidelines. He also pursued various virological, immunological, neuroendocrine and neuropsychological studies of the syndrome. =Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome= In the early 1990s, Straus and colleagues discovered autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS), a rare genetic disorder in which the normal Fas-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes is disrupted, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. He found mutations in the genes encoding Fas and Fas ligand, as well as caspase-10 and N-Ras, are associated with the disorder. He followed a cohort of over 200 people with ALPS, and showed that they have a substantially elevated risk of developing lymphoma. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine NCCAM was founded as an independent NIH center in October 1998, replacing the Office of Alternative Medicine, and Straus was appointed the founding director, responsible for an annual budget of a little under $90 million. He stated in a 2001 interview that he did not use alternative therapies, and he accepted the position because: Under his leadership, NIH-funded research into complementary and alternative medicine tripled, with NCCAM funding large (phase III) clinical trials of St John's wort for depression, Ginkgo biloba extracts for dementia, and acupuncture and glucosamine/chondroitin sulfate supplements for osteoarthritis of the knee joint, among other treatment modalities. Early in his tenure as director, Straus prioritised the clinical assessment of treatments widely used in America which had previously shown promising results in small clinical trials. He later wrote: \\"In the early years of NCCAM, there was a sense of urgency to scientifically assess a range of CAM therapies that had been in long use by the public in the absence of proof of safety or efficacy.\\" By 2006, the center's research focus had shifted away from large clinical trials and towards investigating how treatments might work, as well as the optimal dosing strategy for botanical extracts and their interactions with prescription drugs. NCCAM was criticised for funding trials of EDTA chelation therapy in coronary artery disease and the Gonzalez regimen in pancreatic cancer. Donald M. Marcus and Arthur P. Grollman, in a 2006 Science opinion article, claimed that the center funded \\"proposals of dubious merit\\", and that its research strategy was \\"shaped more by politics than by science\\". Straus responded that the center had \\"made important contributions in a field that is fraught with controversy and challenges\\" and that it was \\"applying the same scientific standards to the conduct of research and its review as used by other NIH institutes\\". Awards and honors Straus was an elected fellow of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, the Association of American Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). He was honored with the National ME Fund Award of the Netherlands in 1999, IDSA's John F. Enders Lectureship in medical virology in 2005, and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons's gold medal for Distinguished Achievements in Medicine in 2007. He also received five US Public Health Service medals. In 2009, NCCAM founded a lecture series, the Stephen E. Straus Distinguished Lecture in the Science of Complementary Therapies, as a memorial to him. Personal life Straus's wife, Barbara, worked in education; the couple had a son and two daughters. In November 2004, Straus was diagnosed with a brain tumor, from which he died at Potomac, Maryland in 2007, aged 60.

Although they were unable to find any similar varieties, they did bring back several apples including 'Michelin' and 'Medaille d'Or'. 'Michelin' proved to be an extremely heavy cropping and reliable cider apple.

After a break to raise her family, Macharov√° returned to nursing after World War II, working at a military hospital until 1949. Thereafter, she was appointed Head of the Rehabilitation Department in the clinic of Professor Jir√°sek. Early life Sylva Macharov√° was born on 23 June 1893 in Vienna, which was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at that time. Her father was the Czech poet Josef Svatopluk Machar, who at the time of her birth was working as a bank clerk. After attending the Lyceum in Hradec Kr√°lov√© for her secondary schooling, Macharov√° enrolled in 1913 in the Hospital School of Nursing in Vienna. She graduated in 1915 and went to Prague, becoming one of the first licensed nurses of the city. Career Macharov√°, who spoke Czech, English, and German, began working in a sanatorium in Podol√≠.

Around 1918, Macharov√° went to Zl√≠n at the request of Tom√°≈° Ba≈•a, founder of Bata Shoes, who was the mayor of Zl√≠n at that time. He wanted her to investigate why they had cases of wound suppuration and she was able to discover the cause. In 1920, the International Committee of the Red Cross awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for the first time, and Macharov√° was one of two Czech recipients, the other being Irene Metekickova. The award was designed to recognize those who exhibited exemplary performance of nursing duties. In 1923, Macharov√° became the first headmistress of the Czechoslovakian School of Nursing, taking over from the three American Red Cross nurses who had initially developed the theoretical and practical training for the school. Simultaneously, she became the director of the German Nursing School in the city. During her tenure, the school expanded rapidly, but maintained its dedication to professionalism. Macharov√° developed internship opportunities and workshops to improve skill and she sought to integrate languages in both schools. In 1931, Macharov√° married Alfonse Novacek, a veterinarian.

Posting items via international mail also requires the sending party to complete a customs declaration form. The declaration form helps the customs to control the goods that entered the country, which can affect the country's economy, security or environment. A levy duty may be applied. Travellers have to declare everything they acquired abroad and possibly pay customs duty tax on goods. Some countries offer a duty-free allowance of certain products which may not need to be declared explicitly. Types of forms Customs declaration used for parcels. * When an individual is transporting the goods, the form is called a customs arrival card, or a landing card, or an entry voucher. The traveller is required to fill out the form, sign and submit to the customs or border protection officer before entering the country. *When an individual or an organization ships goods across the borders, one must use other customs declaration forms, such as a commercial invoice, or a proforma invoice, an import declaration form, an ATA Carnet, or a re-export declaration.

It is part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. History The portrait is of Mrs. Hammersley, n√©e Mary Frances Grant (ca. 1863‚Äìca. 1902), who was the wife of a banker and a fashionable London hostess. In the portrait, she is delicately poised on a French sofa. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art: > \\"Her willowy form and candid expression suggest Sargent's ability to > characterize and flatter simultaneously. Her gold-trimmed silk-velvet dress > and the sumptuous setting announce his mastery of varied textures and > patterns.\\" The painting was well reviewed when it appeared at the New Gallery in London in 1893. The reviews it received there, and at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1894, appeared to forgive Sargent for his infamous Madame X in 1884. The painting is among the first of Sargent's series of images of glamorous English women that culminated in The Wyndham Sisters: Lady Elcho, Mrs. Adeane, and Mrs. Tennant of 1899. Conservators at the Metropolitan note, \\"Sargent‚Äôs unabashedly modern portrayal of the daring and stylish Mrs. Hammersley is a superb demonstration of the artist‚Äôs confidence and skill as well that of his sitter.\\" =Provenance= After Mrs. Hammersley's death in 1902, her husband kept the painting until 1923, when financial troubles compelled him to sell the work. At the suggestion of Sargent, it was purchased by Charles Deering (1852‚Äì1927), an American whose portrait Sargent had painted in Newport, Rhode Island in 1876, and who collected Sargent's works.

Residents in the lower parts of the reserve extract babassu for income, and use the ju√ßara, buriti and bacaba palms typical of the wetland environment for family use. They also practice subsistence agriculture, growing rice, beans and corn. History The Chapada Limpa Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree on 26 September 2007 with an area of to protect the livelihoods and ensure the use and conservation of renewable natural resources used traditionally by the residents. The region had for years been an area of conflict between the traditional extractive population and soybean agribusinesses. The reserve conserved part of one of the most threatened biomes in the country. It was the first extractive reserve in the cerrado biome in Maranh√£o. It is administered by the federal Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The reserve is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). Its objectives are to protect the livelihoods and ensure the use and conservation of renewable natural resources traditionally used by the extractive population. On 12 November 2008 the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA ‚Äì National Institute for Colonisation and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve as meeting the needs of 62 families, who would qualify for PRONAF support.

Radelet works as a professor of sociology at University of Colorado Boulder. In his research, Radelet focuses on his interests in criminology, deviance, capital punishment, societal reaction to crime, racial disparities in death sentencing and crime victims. Radelet has taught courses covering introductory sociology, criminology for both undergraduate and graduate levels, capital punishment for both undergraduate and graduate levels, sociology of mental health and illness for both undergraduate and graduate levels, graduate seminar on health professions, social and ethical issues in medical practice, human development, statistics, and social problems. He is the author of the book Facing the Death Penalty that was published in 1989, in which he describes the realities of capital punishment to those of the condemned.  Career  Radelet has been a professor at many universities and has taught in many fields of study throughout his career. Before his work at University of Colorado Boulder, Radelet worked as a professor and the chair of the department of sociology at the University of Florida, where many of his works originated. He has taught all over the U.S. in places like the University of Florida, Florida State, University of Colorado, Indiana University, Eastern Michigan University and Wisconsin University. Radelet has lectured and taught: Mental Health Administration, Sociology of Mental Health and Illnesses, Criminology, Special Topics on Capital Punishment, and Human Development.  Research and findings  Radelet throughout his career has studied the impact that the death penalty has on the mind, and on society. In the midst of the ongoing debate on whether or not the death penalty is more deterrent than long-term imprisonment, Radelet's studies revealed findings that could alter the system. His works surveyed many, coming up with multiple conclusions regarding the issue, these results are displayed in his article 'Do Executions Lower Homicide Rates: The Views of Leading Criminologists.' One of the main statistics projected in this article states that 88% of criminologists do not believe that capital punishment is an effective deterrent to homicide. Radelet's knowledge in Psychology and Criminology helped him produce his book \\"Facing the Death Penalty.\\" This book portrays what Michael experienced while working with those who are facing the death penalty. It talks a lot about the benefits and inhumanities of the death penalty and how Radelet's experience may change people‚Äôs views. = Racial disparities = Radelet has uncovered many facts and statistics relating to the problem of racial disparities in the federal death penalty. He has statistics dating back to 1991 during the first federal death penalty prosecution. In the history of those who were prosecuted and sentenced to the death penalty, most were of color. These injustices continue today, more and more whites are able to evade the death penalty better than blacks. These injustices revealed by Radelet made the notion that racism is apparent in the justice system. These studies triggered an uprising of debate on whether the death penalty is a fair punishment.

They were killed in the early morning in a private residence in a rural area west of the city. It was owned by a brother of Laneta Lester, who had sought refuge there. She and her brother's infant were abducted and taken to Leakesville, Mississippi, by her estranged boyfriend, Derrick Dearman. He released her that day. Lester returned with the infant to Citronelle. She notified police of the killings. Investigators described this mass killing as the worst in Mobile County's history. The house burned down a couple of weeks after the crime. Dearman was considered a suspect. He was arrested after he turned himself in at the Greene County, Mississippi police station. He was extradited to Alabama, where he was charged with six counts of capital murder (including the fetus, under Alabama law) and two counts of abduction. Initially he pleaded not guilty to the charges. In September 2018 he pleaded guilty to the capital murder charges. He still had to face a jury trial, which convicted him of the murders and kidnappings, and sentenced him to death. The court upheld the sentence. Killings In the early morning of August 20, 2016, a male assailant entered a residence in the 1700 block of Jim Platt Road about 4 a.m., in a rural area west of Citronelle. He killed five persons who were sleeping, including two married couples, one including a woman who was five months pregnant. He used a variety of weapons, including an axe and guns. He kidnapped Laneta Lester, his estranged girlfriend, and an infant of her brother and his wife; he took them with him to his father's house in Leakesville, Mississippi, about 30 miles to the west. Later he released them. Lester returned to Citronelle with the infant, where she went to the police department and notified authorities about the killings. She said she had been abducted by her estranged boyfriend, Derrick Dearman, and that he had killed the people at the house. The police found the five bodies at the crime scene. They said it would take time to process the crime scene. Initial reports said Lester had escaped from Dearman, but she and the infant were reportedly released by him. Investigators said that residents had made a 9-1-1 call from the house about 1 a.m., a few hours before the killings, and reported that Derrick Dearman was on the property. Officers responded to the house, but found no evidence of him on the wooded grounds and left. Investigators initially believed the attacker had used an ax and several firearms that were in the house in the attack, and that the killings were committed in the process of an attempted burglary or abduction. Police found two firearms and a \\"bladed weapon\\" at the house. The attack was described as the worst mass killing in the history of Mobile County. Victims and perpetrator =Victims= The deceased victims shared the house where the homicides took place. It was owned by Lester's married brother, Joseph Adam Turner, who lived there with his wife. Lester was said to have gone there seeking refuge from her ex-boyfriend, Derrick Dearman, who lived in Mississippi. Lester's brother Joseph and his wife were both among the homicide victims. The other three adult victims sharing the house included another married couple, of which the woman was five months pregnant. The victims were named as: *Joseph Adam Turner, 26, Lester's brother *Shannon Melissa Randall, 35, Turner's wife *Robert Lee Brown, 26 *Justin Kaleb Reed, 23 *Chelsea Marie Reed, 22, Justin's wife, who was five months pregnant =Perpetrator= After Lester had notified police, a suspect, identified as 27-year-old Derrick Dearman, turned himself in to police in his hometown of Leakesville, Mississippi, located about to the west of Citronelle. He reportedly surrendered after his father convinced him to do so. Dearman was the estranged boyfriend of Laneta Lester. She had left him due to an allegedly abusive relationship and gone to Citronelle to her brother's house, seeking shelter with him. The former wife of Dearman described him as having \\"a temper, especially when he doesn't get his way\\". He had two children from his marriage. In Mississippi, he had accumulated an extensive criminal record. Alabama quickly extradited Dearman to Citronelle under charges associated with the killings. Legal proceedings On August 22, Dearman was extradited to Mobile, Alabama, to face trial. While being escorted to an administrative building, he reportedly said, \\"Don't do drugs\\", apologized, and said he turned himself in after realizing what he had done. He later apologized to Lester by name and described the victims as friends. The following day, he said he was on methamphetamine at the time of the killings, and blamed the influence of the drug on the killings. On August 31, 2016, Dearman was charged with six counts of capital murder (one charge for Chelsea Reed's fetus, under Alabama's fetal homicide law) and two counts of abduction. He pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. It was classified as capital murder first, because it was associated with attempted burglary, and secondly, because two or more persons were killed in commission of the same crime. A couple of weeks after the murders, the Turner house burned down. Dearman was assigned two court-appointed defense attorneys. In mid-August 2017, Circuit Judge Rick Stout, at the request of the state, ordered Dearman to receive a mental evaluation, to be completed by the state of Alabama. It was intended to cover three topics: Dearman's competency to stand trial, his mental capacity at the time of the crimes, and his intelligence quotient (IQ). Around this time, one of his attorneys resigned from the case. Dearman objected to having his IQ and competency tested, as he had not made a plea related to either. He tried to establish limits to such testing, but the court denied the motion. The judge was to receive the results of the testing and review them before sharing with the prosecutor and defense. In September 2018, Dearman pleaded guilty to the charges of capital murder and kidnapping. Under Alabama law, because of the capital murder charges, he was still subject to a jury trial, with the potential of receiving a death sentence. He had fired his two court- appointed attorneys before entering his plea. The judge ruled that he was fit to stand trial. At the jury trial, Dearman was found guilty on the six capital murder charges and first-degree kidnapping counts, and the jury approved the death sentence. This was affirmed by the court on October 12, 2018, and Dearman was sentenced to death for these murders.

He is often known as J. Segar Gravatt, although this is also the appellation of his youngest daughter, Jacqueline Segar Gravatt, who was the first woman ordained as an Episcopal minister in Virginia. He drew national attention for defending the Massive Resistance policy of the Prince Edward County, Virginia School Board to the United States Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education and Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, its companion case. Early life and education Gravatt was born at \\"Birdwood\\" in Blackstone, Nottoway County, Virginia. He was the eldest son of William Moncure Gravatt (1883-1961) and Rebecca Epes Dupuy Gravatt (\\"Budie\\") (1882-1959). He had an elder sister, two younger brothers, and a younger sister. He attended the local public school, then Episcopal High School. After graduation, Gravatt attended the University of Virginia and the University of Virginia Law School, receiving an LLB degree in 1933. He was a member of The Eli and Imp Societies, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and the University's Board of Visitors from 1948-1958. During high school and college, he also earned letters in four sports. During the Great Depression, Gravatt lived with his parents and at least two of his siblings. When he gained a financial footing, he married Isbell Turnbull (1918-1997), daughter of Judge Needham Stuart Turnbull. They had three daughters, Mary and the twins, Isbell and Jacqueline, all of whom outlived their parents. Career After his admission to the Virginia bar, Gravatt established a private legal practice with his father. He briefed and argued dozens of cases before the Virginia Supreme Court and in federal courts. He continued his legal practice almost until his death in 1983, and he was also heavily involved in Rotary club. For 35 years Gravatt was also a part-time trial judge in Nottoway County, after his election to the position by the Virginia General Assembly. He also served in the Circuit Court and the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. Gravatt represented Dinwiddie and Nottoway Counties and the City of Petersburg in the limited 1956 Virginia Constitutional Convention, held between March 5 and March 7, 1956. He handily defeated Wyatt T. Walker, whom Gravatt referred to as a \\"negro of the City of Petersburg\\", and who later became Executive Secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.Jill L. Ogline, Mission to a Mad County, (University of Massachusetts Amherst history dissertation 2007 The convention was necessary to amend the state Constitution to allow tuition grants to private schools, called segregation academies because they primarily served white parents who wanted their children educated in an environment isolated from non-white students, including African Americans. On July 23, 1956, Gravatt gave a speech advocating continued segregation before the Defenders of State Sovereignty and Individual Liberties, with which he was heavily involved. Gravatt assisted David J. Mays in the litigation which gave rise to the U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Harrison v. NAACP (1959)NAACP v. Patty, 202 VA 142 (February 21, 1958) and NAACP v. Button (1963).NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. v. Harrison, 202 VA 142 (September 2, 1960) He was also a member of the Commission for Constitutional Government, which Mays and James J. Kilpatrick led, and which couched segregation policies in constitutional terms to appeal to Northerners.George Lewis, \\"Virginia's Northern Strategy: Southern Segregationists and the Route to National Conservatism, Journal of Southern History vol 72 issue 1 pp. 119-122 (Feb. 1, 2006). From at least early 1955, Gravatt represented the Prince Edward County Commonwealth's Attorney or Board of Supervisors in several cases. He was among those advising the county board that it could choose not to appropriate any funds for public education, and thereby close its schools to avoid desegregation. Prince Edward County thus closed its schools in 1959 to avoid mandated racial integration. In March 1964, after nearly five years of the school closure, and after fellow lawyer Collins Denny, Jr., head of the Defenders of State Sovereignty had died, Gravatt argued Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County before the United States Supreme Court.

Daugherity, \\"Program of Action\\" Virginia Magazine of History & Biography Vol 121 issue 3 as well as argue that schools were solely a matter of state jurisdiction, Justice Hugo Black chided Gravatt for evasiveness and Chief Justice Earl Warren tartly questioned him as to whether that meant black children had a \\"freedom to go through life without an education.\\"Stephen L.

He was governor of the important Navarrese tenancies of Erro (from 1080), the castle of San Esteban de Deyo (1084), the capital city of Pamplona (1092), Aibar and Tafalla (1098) and Falces and Legu√≠n (1112). In Aragon proper, he governed the important fortress of El Castellar overlooking Muslim Zaragoza from 1091 and the town of Ejea from 1113. He held the rank of count (Latin comes) from 1085, before that he was a lord (senior). According to the Historia Roderici, he was captured in the battle of Morella on 14 August 1084 by the forces of Yusuf al- Mu'taman ibn Hud, king of Zaragoza, and Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar. Between 1087 and 1113 he was responsible for the County of Navarre, the interior of the old Kingdom of Pamplona which had passed to King Sancho upon Pamplona's division in 1076. Nonetheless, Sancho Ram√≠rez had done homage for Navarre to King Alfonso VI of Castile and so Sancho S√°nchez acted in fact as Alfonso's vassal in Navarre. The latter is never referred to as Count of Navarre in royal documents, but only in documents of local origin. This is perhaps a sign that the status of Navarre proper between Aragon and Castile was not completely settled. In January 1092, Sancho was still lord of San Esteban de Deyo, but by October he had been replaced by the bishop of Pamplona, Pedro de Roda. According to the 14th-century Chronicle of San Juan de la Pe√±a, in 1094 the inhabitants of Huesca in the taifa of Zaragoza, threatened by Sancho Ram√≠rez, asked Alfonso VI for assistance in return for tribute. In response, Alfonso \\"sent Count Sancho with all of his forces to their aid, and the Castilian army moved up to Vitoria. As soon as the king of Aragon learned of this, he marched against the count with his men and his sons Pedro and Alfonso. The count did not expect him and was forced back into Castile.\\" Francisco Bautista suggests that this episode would be better located in 1090 or in 1091, when Sancho Ram√≠rez was building the castle of El Castellar between April and May. Sancho made donations to the cathedral of Pamplona (between 1101 and 1104) and the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem. He appears in a contemporary document as count of Erro in 1113. In 1127, he issued a carta de arras for his wife, Elvira. This is his last appearance in the record and he probably died not long after. Family Sancho was the son of Sancho Macer√°tiz, lord of √Ålava and Oca, and his wife, Andregoto. She was distantly related to the royal family, referring in a charter to avuncula mea regina domna Endrigoto (my [great-]aunt Queen Andregoto). From the time of Jos√© de Moret, writing in the 18th century, Sancho \\"Macer√°tiz\\" (a Basque nickname referring to physical deformity) has been erroneously identified with Sancho Garc√©s, an illegitimate son of King Garc√≠a III of Pamplona, thereby making Sancho S√°nchez and his wife first cousins, but chronology proves the two to have been distinct men. An alternate theory once proposed was that Sancho S√°nchez was a son of Sancho Fortu√±ones and brother of Fort√∫n S√°nchez, husband of Ermesenda, daughter of Garc√≠a III. Sancho was brother-in-law of the Castilian count Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez who married his sister Sancha, while his nephew, their son G√≥mez Gonz√°lez, became the premier nobleman of queen Urraca of Le√≥n and by tradition her lover. Sancho's first marriage or marriages are unrecorded; they are known only from the existence of legitimate children not by his only known wife. His only known wife was Elvira, the second daughter of Count Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez and his wife, Urraca, daughter of King Garc√≠a III. They were married by 1094, when a charter refers to Sancho as a son-in-law of Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez. Sancho had a legitimate son, Gil S√°nchez, and a daughter, Mar√≠a S√°nchez, who married Count Diego L√≥pez I de Haro. Sancho had eight other illegitimate children: Ramiro, Fernando, Andregoto, Sancha (Sancia de Aizuin), Sancha (Sanza d'Estaldun), Fort√∫n, Garc√≠a and Fernando (Ferrando de Estaldum). All ten of his known sons and daughters shared in his inheritance. There were probably other children who died before Sancho and are not recorded in the limited surviving records.

It was built from 1908 to 1920s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The Blackall Woolscour, a collection of large sheds containing shearing and scouring equipment built for the Blackall Proprietary Woolscouring Company, commenced operations in 1908 at a cost of about . Situated outside Blackall adjacent to the newly opened branch railway line the scour continued to operate until its closure in 1978. Wool scouring, one of the methods for cleaning impurities from wool after shearing, began as an alternative to sheep washing in Australia (e.g. Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash) in the 1840s and had almost replaced it by the 1890s . Initially scouring was done by manual methods such as pot and stick or hand box, but by the early 1890s steam driven mechanised scouring dominated the industry. In Australia the large mechanical scours were generally located in the major urban centres. Western Queensland was the exception with the construction of mechanical scouring plants in Charleville, Barcaldine, Ilfracombe, Blackall, Longreach, Winton, Julia Creek, Richmond, Maxwelton and Alba near Hughenden between the late 1890s and the early 1920s. Of these Blackall scour is the only one to remain intact and was the last to cease operating. Scouring, probably using the hand box method, began in Blackall in 1893 when William Henry Banks established a scour near the town bore. Operations were transferred in 1900, after disputes with the town council over water leases, to Duneira, Banks's property. Construction of the railway line to Blackall began in 1905, based on the understanding that local businessmen would establish a woolscour. The same year the Blackall Proprietary Woolscour Company was founded by five members of the local grazing and business community with John Henry Hart as chairman and in December tenders were advertised for the sinking of a bore \\"not more than three miles from the township of Blackall\\"; in February 1906 the tender of the Intercolonial Deep Well-Boring Company was accepted. In September 1906, the Blackall Proprietary Woolsour Company contracted Renshaw and Ricketts, Rockhampton builders, to erect in four months the scouring and shearing shed was using hoop pine from Maryborough.Renshaw and Ricketts, Rockhampton builders, The plant, offered for sale in 1913, was acquired by Western Queensland Meat Export Company. The Melbourne-based company which already owned a boiling down works and a wool scour in Barcaldine made progressive improvements and modifications to the machinery to increase the efficiency of the scour and therefore its capacity, more than doubling the 1913 output by 1918 to 7640 bales, the largest output in its history. The years of peak production were 1916 to 1920. Business declined in the 1920s with other scours in the region closing temporarily or permanently. The general management of the scour was overseen by Allan Martin Ferguson from 1913 until his death in 1933. Members of the Ferguson family continued to manage the complex until 1957. The Western Queensland Meat Export Company continued to operate the scour, mostly at a profit, until 1964 when it was sold to K Austin of Glencoe Station. In 1974 CF Thomas Pty Ltd bought the scour and it was closed in 1978 after a storm caused damage to the boiler. Subsidiary activities of the scour included fellmongering, the removal of wool from dead sheep skins; selling petrol for the C.O.R. Company and farming in the 1950s. Shearing was also carried out as a separate activity and wool could be classed and pressed without being scoured. The shearing board is still in use. In 1988 Blackall Shire Council (now the Blackall-Tambo Regional Council) took out a 99-year lease. The site has since been subdivided to allow the Historic Woolscour Association to purchase most of the buildings and a substantial amount of associated property. The wool storage shed, on an adjoining property, is currently used by a pet food manufacturer. The bore remains the property of R Politch. From 1998, Brisbane architectural firm Conrad Gargett has undertaken conservation work to stabilise the buildings and provide safe visitor access. The work won an RAIA conservation award in 2003.  Description  Located in a rural setting approximately north-northeast of Blackall on the eastern side of the railway line, the woolscour complex consists of a number of timber framed corrugated iron sheds, varying in size and complexity and serviced by an artesian bore, settling ponds, a railway spur line and sheepyards. The major structures are the centrally positioned main building where the shearing, scouring and associated processes took place, an adjacent wool storage shed situated on the western side of the main building, extensive sheepyards adjoining the northeast corner of the main building and a dispersed group of accommodation and service buildings located about to the southeast of the central group of buildings. The main building, a large L-shaped conglomeration, consists of a series of attached sheds with timber trussed gable roofs. These sheds form a sequence of spaces through which the wool passed, beginning on the sheep's back in the northeast corner and ending in the southwest part of the building as baled wool. Areas associated with the successive phases of the wool processing, the shearing, classing, scouring and drying and pressing, are defined by changes in floor level and separate roofs. The largest space, a long rectangular skylit shed, contains machinery and equipment for scouring, fellmongering and drying and a small office in the southwestern corner. To the east of this space, at the northern end, are the classing area and adjoining shearing board. These three attached sheds form the triple gable of the northern facade. The raised timber floor of the shearing board which is reached from the sheepyards by a timber ramp, steps down gradually to an earth floor in the scouring area. On the southeast side of the main building, the inside corner of the L, are a number of ancillary structures. These include a free standing gable roofed work area and attached to the eastern wall of the scouring shed, a blacksmith's room, an engine room and a roofed area associated with the boilers. Further to the east is a large ash heap and the remnants of a trolley way, once used to cart timber to the boilers. At the southern end of the scouring area is the only two storeyed part of the complex. Roughly square in plan it consists of an upper level wool room; a central open space bounded on the east and west by individual compartments; and an open plan lower level containing a wool press. A timber loading platform is located just outside between the western wall of the two storeyed section and the railway spur line. The spur line runs through the centre of the complex between the wool storage shed, a rectangular building with a double gable roof supported by rows of columns and the main building. The scour buildings contain extensive machinery and equipment, including steam engines, boilers, cast iron tanks, dryers, wool presses, and a complex system of belts, pulleys and shafts. The group of smaller scale buildings to the south east of the main building consists of a kitchen, shearer's quarters, toilet block, shower block and meat preparation shed. Excepting for the meat preparation shed which is a square planned, hipped roof enclosure, these buildings have simple gable roofs. The shearer's quarters has a verandah on the western side. The kitchen has attached skillion roofed spaces on the northern and eastern sides. A water tank and stand is located beside the shower block. A shallow pitched corrugated iron roof on timber posts situated just south of the main building, shelters the head of the artesian bore and the generating plant. Bore water which falls into an adjacent settling pond is distributed via a series of drains. A fuel depot, an elevated timber and corrugated iron shed, is sited southwest of the main complex where the spurline rejoins the railway line. The former manager's residence, a single- storeyed gable roofed timber building with skillion roofed verandahs, is located on a nearby property, to the west of the railway line. The front verandah has wide overhangs and is enclosed with insect screens. A number of structures are attached to the rear verandah, the largest being a gable roofed wing with verandah. Nearly all of the structures associated with the Blackall Woolscour remain largely as built in their original position. The building fabric shows signs of age and wear including the accumulation of dust and lanolin, the effects of weathering and some decay of structural elements.  Heritage listing  Blackall Woolscour was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Blackall Woolscour is important in demonstrating the pattern and evolution of Queensland's history being part of a once flourishing secondary industry which developed in western Queensland in the late 19th and early 20th century in conjunction with the spread of the railway. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The place demonstrates rare aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage (i) as the only known surviving example of an early 20th century mechanised woolscour in Australia; (ii) for the unusual intactness in an early 20th century rural industrial complex of machinery and equipment which is still substantially in situ. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Blackall Woolscour demonstrates the principal characteristics of mechanised woolscours in western Queensland including: (i) an abundant supply of bore water (ii) the rural setting adjacent to the railway line (iii) the dispersed character of the complex with large scale central buildings and scattered outbuildings. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Blackall Woolscour exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the community including: (i) the evocative character of the buildings, machinery and setting due to the intactness of the site, the extensive use of timber and iron construction and the visible effects of age and use on the building fabric (ii) the contrast between the simple utilitarian building forms set in an open landscape and the complex internal arrangements of spaces, levels and intricate machinery (iii) the well detailed construction of the main building and the examples of bush carpentry in the ancillary structures. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. As a well designed and efficiently organised example of the first generation of fully mechanical scours, the Blackall Woolscour demonstrates a high degree of technical achievement at the time of its construction. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. As a place of interaction between the rural and town communities the Blackall woolscour has a special association with the people of Blackall and the surrounding Shire providing a social, cultural and economic focus in the district.

It and adjacent cemetery were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. History The area west of Moorhead had a high enough concentration of Danish immigrants that it became known as \\"Dane Hollow.\\" with The Rev. G.B. Christiansen from Blair, Nebraska organized the Ingemann Lutheran congregation in 1882, and services were held in the Townley Country School and family homes. It was named for Bernhard Severin Ingemann, a Danish novelist and poet who became known for his hymns with a general spiritual and religious interest rather than Biblical dogma. The church was built in 1884 on land donated by John and Anna Marie (Nielsen) Johnson who were natives of Hedensted, Denmark. They donated of the first they bought. The land provided enough space to build a church, cemetery, parsonage, and outbuildings. The church was a plain white, gabled, frame building. The foyer and tower were designed and built by Andrew J. Simonsen in 1904. Christina (Beck) Swanson, wife of Neals P. Swanson, was the first person buried in the cemetery in 1884. She, like the others who were buried there, immigrated to the United States from Denmark in the 1880s to early 1890s. The largest percentage of immigrants in Dane Hollow came from Horsens and Klakring, but they came from other areas of Jutland and from some of the islands as well. A few of the people buried in the cemetery were natives of Sweden and either moved to Denmark after their birth or married Danes. The pastor and a few members of the congregation split from Ingemann Church and formed Bethesda Lutheran Church in 1894. This split happened during the larger split in the Danish Lutheran Church. Ingemann became a Grundtvigian congregation, and became known as the \\"Lower Danish Church\\" because it sits in a valley. Bethesda became an Inner Mission congregation, and became known as the \\"Upper Danish Church\\" because it sat on a hill one mile south of Ingemann. Services were held in Danish until 1918 when Iowa Governor William L. Harding forbid the use of foreign languages in public places, over the telephone, in school, and in religious services. About that same time the congregation at Ingemann grew too small for its own pastor, and services were reduced to a monthly basis. Ingemann and Bethesda formed a joint congregation under the leadership of Pastor F.W. Thomsen in 1948. They built a new Bethesda Church in Moorhead using good lumber salvaged from the old Bethesda Church, which was torn down at that time. The last baptism and confirmation in Ingemann Church were held in 1954. The historic church is maintained by the Ingemann Danish Lutheran Church Preservation Society. The property has been reduced over the years to , which is occupied by the church and cemetery. Services are held on Memorial Day, reunions and a few weddings.

History  The church is named for St. John the Evangelist. The earliest reference to worship in Leukershausen occurs between the years 1279‚Äì85, when the presence of a priest was first documented. From 1368 to 1856, the church was under the patronage of the Hospital of the Holy Spirit (German: Spitalanlage) in Dinkelsb√ºhl.  Architecture  Exterior The church consists of a gothic style choirtower from the 15th century at its eastern end, with a classical style nave from the 18th century at its western end. Originally, the upper portion of the tower employed half-timbered construction, but was rebuilt with stone in 1830 due to severe structural deterioration. The southern face of the choirtower features a mechanical clock, that was added in the 20th century. In terms of materials, the building is constructed of solid masonry with uncoursed random rubble walls. The stone of the tower is exposed, while the nave is finished with a parge coat. The tower has a pyramidal hipped roof topped with a rooster shaped weather vane, while the nave has a combination of gable and hipped roofs, all with squared terra cotta tiles.

Portnoy (born 1956 in Syracuse, NY) is a microbiologist, the Edward E. Penhoet Distinguished Chair in Global Public Health and Infectious Diseases, and a Professor of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Structural Biology in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and in the Division of Microbiology in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. He is one of the world's foremost experts on Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium that causes the severe foodborne illness Listeriosis. He has made seminal contributions to multiple aspects of bacterial pathogenesis, cell biology, innate immunity, and cell mediated immunity using L. monocytogenes as a model system and has helped to push forward the use of attenuated L. monocytogenes as an immunotherapeutic tool in the treatment of cancer.  Education and early career  Dr. Portnoy got his start in microbiology in the lab of Dr. Sydney Rittenberg working on Bdellovibrio as an undergraduate at UCLA where he earned a B.A. in Bacteriology in 1978. He next earned his Ph.D. in 1983 under the tutelage of Stanley Falkow first at the University of Washington finishing at Stanford University. In the Falkow Lab, he worked on the conserved virulence plasmids in Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia pestis, and discovered what turned out to be the first effectors of type III secretion. To further his appreciation of host cells, he did his postdoctoral fellowship in the Zanvil Cohn Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology at the Rockefeller University in New York, working with Jay Unkeless and Jeff Ravetch. At Rockefeller University he worked on macrophage Fc receptors and lysosomal proteases.  Contributions to Listeria monocytogenes biology  Cartoon and electron micrographs from Dr. Portnoy's seminal observation that L. monocytogenes utilizes host actin to spread cell-to-cell. J Cell Biol 2002 Aug 158(3) 409-14, Figure 1. In 1986 Dr. Portnoy started his independent lab at Washington University in St. Louis where he began his studies on Listeria monocytogenes. In 1988, he joined the Department of Microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania, where he collaborated with Dr. Lewis Tilney in the Biology Department and made the observation that L. monocytogenes spreads from one cell to another by exploiting a host cell system of actin polymerization. His lab also defined the role of the listerial hemolysin in mediating dissolution of phagosomes. In collaboration with Dr. Philip Youngman, he showed that expression of the L. monocytogenes hemolysin by Bacillus subtilis led to its growth inside of host cells. Dr. Portnoy collaborated with Dr. Yvonne Paterson, who also arrived at Penn in 1988, on the use of L. monocytogenes as a recombinant vector-based vaccine for the induction of cell- mediated immunity. Both Drs. Paterson and Portnoy went on to work with biotech companies to develop vaccines for both cancer and infectious disease applications. Numerous clinical trials based on their discoveries have shown promising results as immunotherapeutic treatments for cancer. In 1997, Dr Portnoy moved to UC Berkeley where his lab continues to examine fundamental aspects of L. monocytogenes biology, and has expanded to focus on both innate and acquired immunity in the context of Listeria infection. Dr. Portnoy and collaborators have shown that immune cells recognize cyclic di-AMP, a novel and essential bacterial signaling molecule, secreted by L. monocytogenes through multidrug resistance efflux transporters. Dr. Portnoy and Dr. Russell Vance identified that STING was the host receptor of cyclic-di-nucleotides (CDNs) that leads to the production of type I interferon and other co- regulated genes. Modified CDNs are now being evaluated for clinical application as adjuvants and for cancer immunotherapy.  Honors and awards  Dr. Portnoy has been awarded a number of honors over the course of his career including the Eli Lilly and Company Research Award in Microbiology & Immunology, NIH Merit Award, Fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology, Senior Scholar Award in Global Infectious Diseases from the Ellison Foundation, and numerous honorary keynote lectures. In 2013, Portnoy's contributions were recognized by his election to the National Academy of Sciences. In 2017, Portnoy became an Elected Fellow in the National Academy of Inventors.  Personal life  Dr. Portnoy has three children, Eleanor Sophie Portnoy (born 1996), Herschel Michael Portnoy (born 1999), and Anna Rose Portnoy (born 2001). His wife, Anna, is a conservation biologist. His father, Bernard Portnoy, M.D. (1929-2015) was a Professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at USC; his mother, Roslyn Portnoy (born 1931) lives in Dana Point, CA and sister, Deborah Brown (born 1953) lives in Sherman Oaks, CA.

After completing his studies, he began his career as a tenor, being particularly successful in operas by Verdi, and sang in operas by that composer as well as others at leading theatres in Italy, Spain, and England. He appeared at the Royal Opera House, London, for ten consecutive seasons between 1863 and 1872. In Paris, he sang at the Paris Opera from 1862 until 1867 in operas by Verdi, Donizetti, Mozart, and others. The composer of French grand operas, Giacomo Meyerbeer, died before the first production of his final opera L'Africaine but left instructions in his will that the opera's leading role, of Vasco da Gama, must be created by Naudin. The tenor agreed to sing the role, in French, for an enormous fee. After his great success in that part, he sang with the Paris Opera for two more years, and then moved into Wagnerian repertoire, singing Lohengrin (in Italian) in England and Tannh√§user in Moscow.

While a professor at the University of Virginia she helped improve their psychology department, making them a nationally ranked program. Hetherington also introduced a new method of analyzing observational research as well as help open the field of psychology to women by overcoming discrimination in her early career.  Early life and education  E. Mavis Hetherington was born in British Columbia on November 27, 1926. She earned a B.A. degree in English and Psychology in 1947, and a year later earned her M.A. in Psychology at the University of British Columbia.Borstelman, L. (Interviewer) & Hetherington, E.

Retrieved from Society for Research in Child Development Web Site:http://www.srcd.org/sites/default/files/documents/hetherington_mavis_interview.pdf After receiving her masters, she applied to the graduate program at the University of California, Berkeley where she earned her Ph.D. in clinical and developmental psychology in 1958. At Berkeley, Hetherington studied under Leo Postman who influenced her to become involved in research instead of becoming a practitioner.  Marriage and career  Hetherington met her husband, John Hetherington, while working on her Ph.D. She started her academic career at Rutgers University-Newark. In 1960, Hetherington and her husband both decided to get teaching jobs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. While teaching in Wisconsin, Hetherington experienced some discrimination by being paid far less than the men while out publishing them and being one of the most popular professors. Throughout her career she published more than 200 research articles and edited 13 books. Hetherington has received many awards throughout her career including the Distinguished Teaching in Developmental Psychology Award from the APA. She also was honored with the Distinguished Scientist Awards from multiple organizations, the Society for Research in Child Development, the American Psychological Society, the American Family Therapy Association, the Society for Research in Adolescence, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, and the National Council on Family Relations.  Major contributions  = Virginia Longitudinal Study of Divorce and Remarriage. = In 1972, E. Mavis Hetherington and colleagues started a 20-year Longitudinal Study of Divorce and Remarriage. Hetherington followed 450 families who had children that were 4 years of age and lived in Virginia. Today, some of those children are adults and have also been divorced or remarried. This has allowed Hetherington to study the effects of divorce and remarriage throughout generations. Numerous follow up studies have also been completed from this data. Findings have caused controversy and a new perspective on divorce, remarriage, and families. Hetherington and colleagues found that divorce is devastating but not as devastating as most theorists have concluded. She also discovered that divorce can't be looked at as a single event but must be viewed as a process of transitions and perspectives from the entire family. Hetherington concluded that social interactions of the family will affect the outcomes of divorce and remarriage and variations of outcomes must be acknowledged. = Late life = Throughout Hetherington's career at the University of Virginia she made great strides with their psychology program by bringing them up to national status in the psychology world. Hetherington's research continues as our generation strays farther away from traditional marriages and replacing it with cohabitation, remarriages, and single parent house holds. Due to her husband's illness Hetherington retired in 1999 after 29 years at the University of Virginia, but her research still continues through the students she worked with.

The album contains more than 600 original photos of Disneyland construction through opening day. It includes never-before-seen photos of Walt Disney, Roy Disney, Joe Fowler, C.V. Wood, sponsors and celebrities, earliest construction images of the lands, and the earliest known images of children inside of Disneyland. It is presumed most of the photographs were taken by Mell Kilpatrick.  History  The team that discovered the Orangewood Album met with Disney Archives on December 4, 2015. All photos and notes in the album were reviewed. Of particular interest during this meeting was a series of photos of the earliest known documented children inside Disneyland. These photos alone rewrite an important piece of Disneyland history. The images of these children date back to January 1955 based upon the condition of the park. They predate, by 5 months, the previous ‚ÄúFirst Kids to Visit Disneyland‚Äù photos, as officially stated by the Disney Company. Until the Orangewood Album was found, it was believed that Sybil Stanton and Bill Krauch were the first kids to visit Disneyland in June 1955. In these photos, the Sleeping Beauty Castle is still under extensive construction as well as other buildings and lands. The children are seen holding hands as they walk through Main Street, Fantasyland, Frontierland, backstage, and other areas. The most prominent photos in this series are of the two children holding hands on the bridge of the Sleeping Beauty Castle. One photo shows the boy pointing up to the half built Castle. The other is a close-up and shows the children gazing through the walkway of the Castle that is partially covered with construction materials. These photographs are also the only known images of these first kids inside Disneyland. More details to the early history of the album and particularly the identification of the children is currently under research by Disneyland historians.  Content  The Orangewood Album consists of more than 600 original photos of Disneyland construction through opening day. The photos start from the first days of construction in July 1954 and go through to July 1955. The album presents the photographs in a mostly chronological order starting with the first arrival of construction crews to the development site. These are followed by photos showing the first construction of buildings and famous landmarks like Sleeping Beauty Castle, the Main Street Train Station, and the Jungle Cruise, to name a few. Several aerial shots are presented throughout the entire album, documenting the complete construction process. These include very early 1954 views of construction and through to opening day, showing the first crowds entering the park. A few of the photos include never before seen photos of Walt Disney (especially a photo of Walt and Joe Fowler walking down Main Street, in front of a trolley full of guests on opening day), earliest known photo of Sleeping Beauty Castle being built, earliest known photo of Main Street Train Station being built, only known photo of Walt Disney‚Äôs Carolwood Pacific Railroad \\"Lilly Belle\\" train being worked in the shop at the Disney Studios, earliest known photo of the Mark Twain Riverboat being tested, the earliest known photo of track being laid for the Train, the earliest known photos of the C.K.

Origin theories  = Created by unknown Disney executive = The Orangewood Album has been examined by Disneyland historians and determined it was assembled from 1954-1955 based on the album manufacturer, style, materials, photograph type and content, internal notes, and other factors. Because of limited access to original developed photographs of Disneyland construction through opening day during any time, it is believed that a high level executive in the Disney organization was responsible for the creation of the album. This is also supported by the finding of hand written notes in the album regarding original sponsors of Disneyland including, but not limited to, Maxwell House, Richfield, and Goodyear. = Created by C.V. Wood = The first employee of Disneyland and General Manager of the park was C.V. Wood. Though his historical role in the creation of Disneyland has been removed from Disney publication, he was responsible for overseeing the construction of the park, reporting directly to Walt Disney and Roy Disney. It is theorized by some historians that C.V. created the Orangewood Album as there are more than 30 photos of C.V. in the album, including entire pages dedicated to him posing with sponsors. Because C.V. was heavily involved with bringing in the original 33 sponsors of Disneyland, it is believed that the numerous and detailed notes about sponsors in the album are his. The timeline of the album also aligns with the time that C.V. was working on Disneyland, prior to his termination by Roy Disney. The first page showing any person in the album is also of C.V. Wood, as well as the last. Overall, the album appears as a portfolio of his work as the General Manager of Disneyland from 1954-55.

It was written as an homage to Damon Runyon, to whom it is dedicated. The style echoes Runyon's, especially in its use of present and future tenses only throughout. It was first published in 1981 in Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine. Plot A former small time criminal in Manhattan, now an old man living in 1980 in a low-rent apartment, finds a \\"ghost\\" burgling his home. The man is \\"Harry the Horse\\", a ruthless thug and general criminal who died decades before. Harry recognizes his old friend, declares that he will not \\"guzzle his joint\\" (i.e. not rob his home) and tells him how he got there. Back in 1930 during the Depression, Harry and his two cronies were caught passing counterfeit bills and bailed out by \\"Judge\\" Goldfobber, a shady lawyer. Goldfobber told them to pay him back by \\"chilling\\" a man up in Harlem and taking a box the size of a phone box from his apartment to Goldfobber's Long Island home. The box turned out to be a time machine built by a stereotypical crazy old professor, Doc Twitchell, who went to Goldfobber to patent it. Harry saw the opportunity to make money by getting stock or horse racing tips from the future, so he killed the inventor and also his two cronies, before using the machine to send himself 50 years into the future, a time when he thinks the Depression should be over. In the future he finds himself in a derelict building with no power, so the time machine will not function to send him back. Worse, Harlem is not the vibrant multi-ethnic neighborhood he knew and he barely escapes despite being having his trusty \\"roscoe\\" (gun). He eventually robs and hijacks his way to the narrator's neighborhood and breaks into his apartment to steal cash. He needs to steal the racing results, which are now on microfilm, and a machine to read them with, from the library. The two set about getting the time machine working again. The narrator has a friend, \\"Socket\\" Twomey, who dabbles in selling marijuana but is also an electrician. They go up to Harlem where Socket routes some wires to restore power, knowing that the city will take days to notice. Socket and Harry steal the microfilm and the reader, and Socket figures out how to work the time machine to avoid it arriving at the wrong time and causing a \\"pair o'ducks\\". Harry insists that somebody else has the first try, so the narrator himself goes back to the old days and spends a glorious few hours in the city he remembers. Harry leaves for the past, promising to leave his friends half of his first million dollars at the First National Bank after becoming rich. The narrator tells Socket this will not happen, and Socket replies he knows it, because he removed the light bulb from the microfilm reader to get back at Harry for threatening him. The narrator knows another reason: while he was back in 1930 he made a phone call to Goldfobber telling him that Harry was double-crossing him. He remembers being at the courthouse when a real judge gave Goldfobber the \\"hot squat\\", i.e. the electric chair, on account of \\"his personal revolver matches up with the six slugs they dig out of Harry the Horse\\".

It was designed by Kay, MacNicol and Company Engineers and built from 1913 to 1914 by Dorman Long and Company (Melbourne). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008.  History  The current Isis Downs Woolshed was completed in 1914. A prefabricated steel structure clad with corrugated iron, the shed was designed by Kay, MacNicol and Company Engineers for the then property owners, Sir Rupert Clarke and Robert Selmon Whiting. Although smaller than the previous shed that had burnt down, the current shed's design is unique, creating a large semi-circular internal space. The Queensland wool industry commenced in 1840 when Patrick Leslie and his brother Walter Leslie established Canning Downs Station on the Darling Downs. Pastoralists followed explorers in opening up the land for utilization and by 1860 wool had become the primary export earner for the newly established colony of Queensland. Isis Downs was one of the first properties to be established in the Isisford District of far west Central Queensland. The initial lease commenced on 1 January 1867 and was held by Charles Lumley Hill, W St John Holberton and W B Allen. The run was named after the Isis River in England, which is actually the upper reaches of the Thames River. Following the taking up of pastoral properties throughout the area, a town was founded by William and James Whitman in 1877 to provide essential services for the district. It had various early names including Whittown, Wittown or Whittington, but in 1897 was officially named Isisford, as it was near to a ford and not far from Isis Downs Station. Isis Downs changed hands a number of times before Robert Selmon Whiting and Sir Rupert Clarke acquired it in 1910. The eldest son of a prominent Victorian family, Sir Rupert Clarke was the 2nd Baronet of Rupertswood and held vast pastoral holdings across the Australian colonies. His father, William John Clarke, appears to have owned Isis Downs for 6 years from 1877, but let it go. Clarke's long standing business partner, RS Whiting, was a wealthy Melbourne based solicitor. The Clarke-Whiting partnership acquired vast land holdings in Queensland, including Isis Downs, Avington, Emmet Downs, Stockbury, Brynhyfryd, and Bellevue/Kiama in the Isisford area, Sedgeford near Alpha, and Albina near Springsure. Of all their holdings, both in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia, Isis Downs was regarded as their \\"masthead\\" sheep station. By 1910 Isis Downs had grown to over and carried a similar number of sheep. At that time the shearing shed on Isis Downs was a rectangular-shaped timber and corrugated iron structure with a central arched spine. Erected in the late nineteenth century, it contained 100 shearing stands and was larger than the current shed, but it was destroyed by fire in September 1912, immediately after the close of the shearing season. By December 1912 the owners had commissioned Melbourne engineers Kay, MacNicol and Company to design a new shearing shed. A number of designs were considered but by late December the current structure was chosen as the \\"cheapest and simplest form of construction\\". The designers argued that \\"the use of one big pillar 30 feet above the ground and sunk to about five feet below, would provide a clear space of about 70 feet to cover shearing board, tables, bins etc\\". The design allowed for 52 shearing stands around the semi-circle, with the sheep-yards on the immediate exterior. On the flat, far side of the building were the wool bins and presses. A separate engine room provided its own electricity, with the lighting supplemented by clerestory windows. Large, rectangular ventilation shutters were spaced around the curved facade of the building providing more light when open. New round woolshed, 1915 Steel was ordered from Dorman Long and Co. of Melbourne in January 1913, the same company that later built the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The steel could not be produced in Australia at that time and therefore had to be shipped from Middlesbrough (England) to Melbourne to be cut and prepared as per the design. It was then shipped to Rockhampton and moved by rail to Malverton, near Blackall. From there, the steel was carted to the property and installed under the supervision of the property manager, Mr Frank Luck. Construction commenced in 1913 and by April the foundations were well advanced; however, completion was delayed due to the late arrival of the steel. The shed was not complete by the 1913 shearing season, forcing the owners to make temporary alternative arrangements. Adjacent to the woolshed a powerhouse was constructed to supply electric and hydraulic power for the various machines used in the clip. The interior of the Isis Downs powerhouse contained both a boiler room and a generating room. The generating room accommodated an Austral Otis hydraulic pump (which was coupled to an external accumulator) and a single cylinder reciprocating vertical steam engine that was attached to an electric generator. The system produced DC power for the Falkiner Boll shearing machines and hydraulic power for the wool presses, bale dump and hoist. Power was transmitted via a power-board in the powerhouse and a distribution-board in the woolshed. A diesel generator was eventually installed, followed by a belt driven set which was powered by a twin cylinder motor within the skillion annex; these systems were eventually superseded in the 1970s with the introduction of 240 volt electric power. By April 1914 the shed itself had been completed and the machinery installed, but the external pens had not been completed and the shorn sheep chutes had not arrived. The external pens were designed to hold thirty thousand sheep, with an anticipated daily tally of five thousand sheep during the peak season. Accessing sufficient timber for the construction of the pens was a major logistical issue, as the nearest natural supply was away. The shed, yards and powerhouse were finally completed in July 1914, at a total cost of . Whiting and Clarke were known as innovators and had a substantial impact upon the station. In addition to the shearing shed, they built the homestead, sank 3 artesian bores, dug a network of bore drains and introduced a 110-horsepower road train (imported from England). Their descendants held the property until 1979. Isis Downs had substantial impact upon the development of the region. Before World War II approximately 150 permanent staff and numerous seasonal workers were employed at Isis Downs, undertaking the variety of tasks necessary to run the property, including the outstations. Increasing mechanisation drastically reduced permanent staff levels, which had a negative effect upon the local economy and community. Environmental and economic factors led to varying stock numbers over the years. In the late 1950s only 60,000 head of sheep were grazed on the station, but by the 1990s stock numbers had risen to 100,000, due in part to the acquisition of surrounding properties. Stock levels eventually declined as the current owners moved toward cattle grazing. As sheep numbers fell, the shearing season became smaller and the final clip was made in May 2004 with less than 30,000 sheep. In recent years the Isis Downs Shearing Shed has been used to host events such as the Queensland Conservatorium Symphony Orchestra (2003) and the Outback Opera in the Shearing Shed (2005).  Description  The Isis Downs Woolshed complex is located on the Isisford-Blackall Road approximately east of the township of Isisford, within the homestead complex of the Isis Downs Station. The complex consists of the shearing shed (completed with mechanical shearing motors and wool presses), holding yards, powerhouse (with an extensive array of machinery and infrastructure) and a stand-alone bale hoist, located in close proximity to each other, and which were used conjointly to clip and process the fleeces. = Woolshed = The dominate feature of the complex is the woolshed. A large, high-set semi-circle with a low-set section along the rear wall, the woolshed's curved exterior faces the property entrance. The whole is clad in corrugated iron and crowned by a three-tiered roof. The upper two levels of the roof are progressively smaller raised semi-circles that sit in the centre of the roof and do not extend back to the rear wall. These provide light and ventilation to the large interior space via clerestory windows and louvres. In the centre of the front curved wall is a central double-door entry that is met by the holding yard ramp. The sliding doors are rectangular and clad entirely in corrugated iron. Ten smaller sliding ventilation shutters of similar design are evenly spaced in the curved facade, five on either side of the double doors. At the rear ground level of the woolshed is another central double sliding door, clad in corrugated iron. Interior view, circa 1925 Internally, the woolshed has two levels - the main floor, high-set, of timber construction, and semi-circular; and a much smaller ground level floor, of concrete, along the rear, straight wall. There are no internal wall or roof linings, leaving the shed structural components clearly visible. The woolshed has a steel superstructure, with a central pillar that sits directly under the apex of the roof; located at the mid-rear point of the top roof tier. Steel web trusses radiate out from the central pillar over a clear space of . The trusses terminate at supporting steel posts, which frame the 52 shearing bays that follow the curve of the semicircle. Mechanical shearing motors are mounted on the tally boards above each bay, with smaller holding pens located between the bays and the exterior wall. The current motors are modern upgrades but an example of an original motor survives within the shed. The large open space between the central pillar and the bays was used to sort and class the fleeces. Wool presses are located on the rear edge of the timber floor and extend down to the narrow concrete ground level. = Holding Yards = Immediately abutting the curved wall of the woolshed is a series of timber let-out pens. The pens lead into \\"counting-out\\" yards that surround the curved face of the shearing shed. The larger series of holding yards extending beyond the \\"counting-out\\" yards are not included in the heritage boundary. A large timber forcing-up ramp gives access from the yards into the central opening of the woolshed. = Powerhouse = The powerhouse is a simple rectangular building with a gable roof located at the rear of the woolshed, in the north-eastern corner of the complex. With the exception of a small number of windows and fixed louvres, the powerhouse is clad almost entirely in corrugated iron. A tall metal chimney extends out of the north-eastern corner of the roof and is supported by four cable ties. A smaller corrugated iron skillion shed extends from the northern corner. The powerhouse has two internal sections: a boiler room and a generating room, and still contains an extensive array of the machinery used during the woolshed's operation. The boiler room contains a wood-fired boiler and a high pressure water pump. External to the boiler room is a hydraulic accumulator and nearby, a ship's tank. Identified equipment within the generator room includes: * Southern Cross Mark YEB engine, 1200 RPM, manufactured by the Toowoomba Foundry * 240 volt, KW HP 12, continuous current generator manufactured by The British Thomson-Houston Co. Ltd * Lister alternator manufactured by Higgs Motors of Dursley, England * a generator manufactured by Ransomes, Sims & Jefferies of Ipswich, England * a hydraulic pump manufactured by The Austral Otis Engineering Co. Ltd of Melbourne and Sydney The powerhouse also retains much of the associated infrastructure such as pipes and the power board. = Bale Hoist = The bale hoist was used to load bales of wool onto transports and is located on the rear eastern side of the woolshed, adjacent to the powerhouse. The hoist is made from steel and consists of a vertical upright with a horizontal arm at the top. The arm is supported by decorative steel bracing. Part of the hydraulic power network, the hoist had a single cable that operated through a series of sheaves; the lower sheave is now missing. Historical evidence suggests a ball weight was mounted above the hoist hook, which was sufficient enough to pull the cable to the ground and force the piston into position for the next lift. The vertical upright of the hoist is supported by two angled steel braces.  Heritage listing  The Isis Downs Woolshed was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Isis Downs Woolshed Complex (constructed 1913-1914) is important in demonstrating the evolution of sheep shearing processes in Queensland, and in particular of early mechanised shearing. The powerhouse is important in demonstrating the generation of non-grid electricity in remote and regional Queensland prior to World War I. The introduction of both hydraulic and electrical generating systems specifically for a shearing shed was only possible at the largest and most progressive sheep stations. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The large and distinctive semi-circular prefabricated shearing shed is the only example of its type in Australia. The collection of associated machinery within the complex is also \\"unique\\" in terms of its composition and condition. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Isis Downs Woolshed Complex is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a large, early twentieth century shearing operation, comprising shearing shed (completed with mechanical shearing motors and wool presses), holding yards, powerhouse (with an extensive array of associated machinery and infrastructure) and bale hoist. The place was and remains one of the largest and most intact early twentieth century shearing complexes in Queensland, of exceptional value in contributing to our understanding of early mechanised shearing in Queensland. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Although designed as a utilitarian structure, the size and semicircular layout of the shearing shed at Isis Downs makes a dramatic visual impact against the flat, unwooded landscape. The use of corrugated iron cladding coupled with the setting of the Isis Downs Woolshed Complex within a flat, open landscape, evokes a strong sense of isolation. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Isis Downs Woolshed is an innovative approach to design of large-scale pastoral infrastructure in Queensland. The use of prefabricated steel for the superstructure, unusual semi-circular shape, the provision for light and ventilation, is a unique attempt to address the functional, financial and logistical issues associated with a large shearing shed. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Isis Downs Woolshed complex has a special association with the business partnership of Sir Rupert Clarke and Robert Whiting who played a significant role in the development of the region and were known nationally as major figures in the Australian pastoral industry.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. At the time of its nomination it contained 19 resources, which included eight contributing structures, nine non-contributing buildings, and two non-contributing structures. with The historic district is made up of eight gully control dams erected by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp DPE-79, working for the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). They were built between 1937 (or 1938) and 1941. The project was completed by crews from the conscientious objector camp in Denison in late 1941 and 1942. This was one of the first watershed protection projects that SCS took up in the United States, and the first in the State of Iowa. No planning documents could be found among the CCC and SCS official records. The planning for the project appears to have begun when the CCC was developing the newly created Preparation Canyon State Park nearby. Informal discussions were held between SCS engineer Robert Mayberry, local farmer Roy McCue, and CCC camp superintendent Ray Jones. At the time federally funded soil conservation work on private land was considered an inappropriate use of taxpayer money. The Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1939 changed that while this project was already under way. Such projects could be undertaken as long as the projects were sponsored by conservation districts or similar bodies that were organized by the states for soil erosion control and conservation purposes. The local farmers in this project had already been organized in the Soldier-Maple Valley Soil Conservation District. Monona and neighboring Harrison County also had a long history of working together on flood control projects. The dams in this project were built to stabilize upland soils that were being eroded because of current farming practices at that time. The SCS also helped individual farmers convert from planting straight-rows of crops to contour farming on terraced benches. At the same time of badly eroded land were taken out of cultivation and placed into pasture or planted with trees.

It was designed by George Meacham and Archibald Solway and built in 1921 by Edwards, Martin Ltd. It is also known as Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade Centre, QATB Centre, and Longreach Arts & Crafts Centre. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade (QATB) centre in Longreach is a two storey timber building purpose built for the Brigade in 1921 and in use as an Arts and Crafts centre since 1973. The Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade began in Brisbane in 1892. It was formed by Seymour Warrian of the Army Medical Corps after seeing an accident victim suffer considerable aggravation of his injuries through inexpert transport to hospital. The Brigade aimed to provide first aid and skilled transport to hospital for the sick and injured. In the first years the Brigade was wholly funded by subscription, but met such an important need that from 1895 they were subsidised by the Queensland Government, both directly and by involving the Department of Works in the construction of ambulance buildings. In the late 1890s and 1900s they expanded into regional centres. By 1921, a specific layout for ambulance buildings had been formalised into policy. This incorporated a space for vehicles with easy street access, a casualty room, meeting room and sleeping room for ambulance bearers on a ground floor level and residential quarters for the superintendent above. The Longreach branch of the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade was formed on 24 June 1919. A modified Buick car was purchased from Brisbane, and the ambulance began operations from the Commercial Hotel, before moving to premises in Galah Street, and then Crane Street. In 1920, the Ambulance Brigade committee petitioned the Queensland Government for a dedicated reserve for ambulance offices at Longreach, and this was granted at 111 Ibis Street. After a year of highly successful fundraising, the committee was able to commission the construction of a purpose-designed ambulance building. Plans were submitted by Mr George Meacham and the Brigade superintendent, Mr Archibald Solway, and the contract let in 1921 to Messrs Edwards, Martin Ltd of Longreach, with a price of . The building was opened free of debt in May 1921, by the Longreach Shire Chairman, Mr Edward Rowland Huey Edkins. The new building was a two-storeyed timber structure, following the now standard layout for QATB centres. The ground floor contained the casualty room, office, store, and accommodation for the bearers (consisting of 2 bedrooms, an enclosed verandah which served as the living room, kitchen and toilet, shower and bathroom) and a cement floored area for housing the ambulance vehicles. On the upper floor was the superintendent's quarters, comprising 3 bedrooms, a study, kitchen, bathroom, shower and toilet and a large verandah, where all meals were taken. The Ambulance Service was transferred to the Longreach Hospital in 1958, after which the upper floor of the ambulance station was occupied for some years as a residence, but the ground floor remained vacant. The building began to fall into disrepair and in 1971, Longreach citizens formed an Arts and Craft group and petitioned to make use of the disused ambulance building. In 1973, the ambulance reserve was transferred from the Health Department to local trustees as a Reserve for Cultural Purposes and the Longreach Cultural Association undertook to restore the former ambulance building as an arts and crafts centre. Assistance came from local Rotarians and from the Queensland and Australian governments in the form of grants for restoration work and various Arts grants. The building now functions as an Arts and Crafts Centre and accommodates various art and craft classes, an art gallery, potters' workshop, Flying Arts activities, a theatre group, and community group meetings. The upper level currently comprises the Gallery, a flat rented on a semi-permanent basis, a Tutor's Room for visiting arts tutors, a store room, a craft display room, and a QATB memorabilia room. The Gallery was officially opened in November 1979. An adjoining structure that houses the potters' group and the theatre group was constructed in 1988 as a bi-centennial project.  Description  The former QATB centre is a two storey timber framed building with a corrugated iron roof. and has wide surrounding verandahs to both levels. The front of the building is clad with pressed metal sheeting which simulates bricks and stone quoins. This effect is heightened by appropriate painting. The sheeting is continued up into a parapet which conceals the roof from the street and carries the QATB Maltese cross insignia and the date 1921. The remainder of the building has exposed studs and a timber lining. The verandah to the upper floor has dowel balustrading and panels of lattice at the front corners and at the rear. There is a timber valance of vertical boards cut to form shallow arches between the timber post which support the verandah. The building has been changed little to accommodate its new use and the extension building is connected only by a light pergola supporting vines.  Heritage listing  The former QATB Centrewas listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former QATB centre demonstrates the way in which the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade spread through Queensland and the importance of Longreach as a regional centre The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is a good example of a regional QATB centre which uses the standard ambulance station plan comprising garage space, casualty room and bearer's room on the ground floor and accommodation for a superintendent above. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former ambulance station, due to its prominent position in the main street of Longreach and its use of scale, form and materials, makes a major contribution to the townscape and is a well designed and proportioned building adapting a vernacular style well suited to the climate. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The building has a strong association with the people of the Longreach area as a community facility and with the work of the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade.

Philippe Rushton in 1985, which attempts to apply r/K selection theory to human races. According to Rushton, this theory explains race differences in fertility, IQ, criminality, and sexual anatomy and behavior. The theory also hypothesizes that a single factor, the \\"K factor\\", affects multiple population statistics Rushton referred to as \\"life-history traits\\". Many researchers have criticised Rushton's theory. It has been argued that the predictions based on the theory \\"are supported by selective citation and misrepresentation of the research literature and by the use of unreliable sources\\" and that Rushton's methodology \\"indicates a lack of familiarity with ecological thinking and scientific method in general.\\" Additional criticism of the theory has come from Edward M. Miller, who has argued that contrary to the theory, unpredictable environments select for K, not r, characteristics. In contrast, Donald Templer reported finding evidence in support of the theory's prediction of a \\"K factor\\" that accounts for numerous life-history traits, such as \\"birth rate, infant mortality, HIV/AIDS, general intelligence, and life expectancy.\\" A 2012 study analyzing self-reported data found inconsistent evidence in support of the theory. A 2013 study found some support for the theory in regards to the correlation between IQ and two such traits: parental investment and fertility rates. A 2014 study found differences in the General Factor of Personality across races that were not compatible with differential K theory. Another 2014 study reported evidence against the theory with respect to the association between male sexual behavior, social capital, and the favorability of environments. The authors of this study concluded that its results \\"corroborate previous findings regarding relationships between reproductive onset and reproductive behavior, but do not provide strong evidence to suggest that these relationships are part of a general 'K-dimension' as predicted by Differential K theory.\\" Some researchers have also tried to combine differential k theory with Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime to create what they call a \\"unified crime theory\\".

New Zealand Supply Detachment The New Zealand Army first deployed to Somalia in 1992 with a Supply Detachment which was part of the original United Nations Operation in Somalia, (UNOSOM). To facilitate purchase of goods in neighbouring Kenya, personnel were also deployed there on a regular basis. The original commitment was 28-strong, with most members arriving in Somalia in early 1993. New Zealand Supply Platoon The Supply Detachment was replaced in July 1993 with a larger 43-strong Supply Platoon. Due to the deteriorating security situation it included an infantry section from 1st Battalion Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (1 RNZIR). This Platoon witnessed the Battle of Mogadishu unfold including the events of the infamous Black Hawk Down incident. A second Supply Platoon rotated in January 1994. This platoon was present for the draw-down and withdrawal of all of the western forces which was completed by 30 March 1994, which then left the New Zealand platoon, Australian MOVCON, Air Traffic Controllers and ASASR troop and the Irish Transport Company as the few western contingents remaining in Somalia. Role The role of the New Zealand Supply units was the provision of supplies to the UN Force, to facilitate this a section was based at the seaport working with the prime UN contractor Morris Catering, and a section was based at the airport where a warehouse was maintained holding general stores. Conditions in Somalia The New Zealand troops were poorly equipped and only issued with basic small arms and fragmentation vests, which given the threat level were totally inadequate for the task. Vehicle movement was by light skinned commercial vehicles and due to the risk of ambush and IEDs was limited, and often the situation deteriorated to a state where vehicle movement was stopped altogether, and helicopters had to be used to fly to United Nations locations around Mogadishu. Gunfire was constant, with Somali bandits climbing into the surrounding buildings and sporadically firing into the airfield and seaport, with random mortar fire also been a constant threat and annoyance. An increasing casualty list of UN personnel and relief workers, served as a continuing reminder of the hostility and dangers of serving in Somalia. Brigadier Charles Lott, who served in Somalia, recalls that the drive between the UNOSOM HQ in the university compound in Mogadishu itself and the airport was hair-raising. > ‚ÄúSpeed was the main weapon against Somalis who were often under the > influence of the hallucinatory herbal drug known as khat and were taking pot > shots.

In one month alone more than 1000 tonnes of rations were distributed, including live goats. Taniwha Hill The New Zealanders home in Mogadishu was a camp in the sand-hills between the Indian ocean and Mogadishu Airport which had been christened \\"Taniwha Hill\\". Taniwha Hill was a self- contained location with heavily sandbagged tents providing the most austere accommodation, and a large mess tent/kitchen/recreation area as the central point of the camp. Ablution facility's were basic with buckets for showers and dissected 44 gallon drums for toilets, which required the daily disposal by stirring and burning. Modern ablution blocks with hot and cold running water and flush toilets were provided in the last weeks of the deployment. Withdrawal The Supply Platoons ended their mission in June 1994.

It was built in 1921 by Edward and Martin. It is now known as Longreach Powerhouse Museum. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999.  History  The Longreach Powerhouse began operating in 1921 under the Longreach Shire Council until 1966 when it came under the control of the Central West Regional Electricity Board and later the Capricornia Regional Electricity Board. The former Longreach Powerhouse was built by Edward and Martin, under the supervision of consultant engineer Norman White, and was completed by September 1921. Electricity was generated in Longreach by at least 1908 when it was installed in the Longreach Hotel by the City Electric Light Company. The first documented moves to provide Longreach with an electric light scheme began in early 1916 when the Longreach Shire Council made enquiries about the costs of a scheme for the town. The Council appointed a consulting engineer, Norman White, to investigate the possibilities and he estimated a cost of . After much debate, Council applied to the Queensland Treasury for a loan, but was refused as the Government of the day was undergoing a financial crisis. Undeterred, the Council and townspeople, through local member, John Payne, lobbied the Treasury and finally, in October 1919, money was made available - a sum of as the estimates had risen considerably. Ratepayers questioned the desirability of borrowing such a large sum of money for electricity generation, citing the facts that the town still didn't have an adequate drainage system and that a proper water reticulation or sanitary scheme would be more practical. One group even lobbied vigorously for a swimming pool to be built. Council, however, went ahead and applied for an Order in Council to permit it to generate electricity as the Longreach Electric Authority. This was granted on 15 July 1920 and the Council appointed Norman White as consulting engineer and supervisor of construction. A site was selected on the town's recreation reserve, opposite the school and behind the artesian bore. The choice was made for two reasons. Firstly, the engines would need a plentiful supply of water for cooling purposes and secondly, the electricity generated would be direct current (as opposed to today's alternating current) which does not transmit over great distances, thus, the generating station needed to be close to its potential customers. By 12 December 1920, tenders were called for the supply of machinery, poles, insulators and wire. There tenders were not met and fresh plans were drawn up and tendered in March 1921. By 30 April 1921, the foundations for the building had been poured and the engines - Ruston and Hornsby charcoal gas units - were expected to arrive imminently. A supply of 200 poles had been obtained from the Clermont district. Work by the contractor, Edward Morton Limited, proceeded steadily and on 17 September, Council passed for payment asked for the construction of the building and concreting work. The same Council meeting also noted that the installation work was over budget and now looked like costing . At the next meeting in November, Council heard that there were problems with the engine installation and that a start-up date was uncertain. This meeting resolved to ask Queensland Treasury for a further , but a later meeting amended this figure to undefined expenses to be paid directly by Treasury. On 12 December 1921, John Edward Lloyd Jones signed a tender to supply cord wood and charcoal to the powerhouse at the rate of per month at per ton. Nothing is recorded in minutes from Council meetings between 12 December 1921 and 9 January 1922. The minutes from the meeting of 9 January indicate that the powerhouse had begun operating. In the minutes the Council called for a powerhouse manager to be appointed at per week; the meeting requested Edward Martin to repair unsatisfactory concrete work at the powerhouse, indicating that engine vibration had damaged some of the concrete bedding; tenders were called to wire the Shire Office. A previous decision had been made not to have this work done until the electricity scheme was up and running and, finally, three people were to be prosecuted for illegally connecting their premises to the electricity supply. Initially, the local government reserve contained the powerhouse, swimming baths and town bore. Subsequently, the boundaries of this reserve were altered as the power station expanded. The 1938 extension to the main building necessitated the alteration of the boundaries between the recreation reserve and the local government reserve. The boundary was altered again in 1943 when the producer annex was extended. In 1958, all of the recreation reserve was regazetted to enable further expansion of the powerhouse buildings. The recreation reserve had contained four tennis courts which were relocated to the showgrounds. When the Central West Regional Electricity Board took responsibility for the power station in 1966, the boundaries of the reserve were altered again. Most of the local government reserve was regazetted a reserve for electricity purposes while a portion containing the bore was retained by the Council. The evolution of the powerhouse reflects the growth in demand for electricity. When the powerhouse opened it primarily supplied electricity for lighting. During the 1940s, demand increased significantly as a result of two major developments, the new hospital and the upgrading of the Longreach aerodrome. The United States Air Force is credited with upgrading the landing facilities at the aerodrome. The American base in Longreach was established in May 1942 during World War II, where it remained until 24 July 1942. The 93rd and a portion of the 28th Bombardment Squadron were stationed there and it was from their Longreach base that they flew to engage in the battle of the Coral Sea in early May. By the 1960s the powerhouse supplied other towns and rural areas under the Central West Regional Electricity Board. In 1977 the electricity supply in Queensland underwent reorganisation resulting in the powerhouse's operations being taken over by the Capricornia Regional Electricity Board. The power station continued to generate electricity until 1985 when the town and district were linked to the statewide electricity grid. Since the first building was erected in 1921, substantial changes have occurred on the site in response to the growth in the capacity and function of the power station. The original powerhouse was of timber frame construction and clad in corrugated galvanised iron. This latter material was to be the standard cladding and roofing, with one exception, for all subsequent buildings and extensions on the site. The first major extension to the powerhouse occurred in 1934 when a workshop was added adjacent to the producer annexe. Four years later a bathroom was built and the producer annexe extended when an additional gas producer was installed. Until 1947, there was sufficient space within the main building to accommodate the additional engines that were installed in 1938 and 1943. However, when the National FA7 was purchased, it was positioned on the western side of the main building and covered by a skillion roof. The installation of the coal fired gas producers necessitated the construction of a separate building in 1951. In 1954, the gas producer building was extended to accommodate the second unit. At the same time as this extension was undertaken, major alterations were made to the main building. The roof was realigned in order to accommodate an internal mobile crane. Also, the building was extended on the western side to provide full protection for the FA7 engine. During the 1960s and 70s, the additions and alterations to the buildings continued as more equipment was installed. The main building was extended twice on the western side to accommodate the Mirrlees engines when they were installed in 1966 and 1973. In 1962, the producer building was doubled in size to provide room for the fourth gas producer. This extension was almost identical to the existing building. Other buildings constructed on the site included a garage and heavy equipment store. A new office was built soon after the Central West Regional Electricity Board took control of the power station in 1966. The site of the Longreach Powerhouse is considerably reduced from that utilised at the peak of the power station's capacity. From 1958 the total area that had been formally gazetted as a recreation area was needed for the storage of fuel (both oil and coal) and for cooling ponds and tanks. The powerhouse was decommissioned in 1985 when the central west became part of the state grid. Since this time, the site has been subdivided and reduced in area. In 1989, the Longreach Shire Council purchased the powerhouse and a portion of the land with the intention of converting it into a museum. The Longreach Powerhouse Museum Association commenced operations in February 1994. The powerhouse was opened as the Longreach Powerhouse Museum in September 1994.  Description  The buildings which form the former powerhouse (the generating complex, engine annexe and the gas production shed) and the CAPELEC office and store today form the nucleus of the Longreach Powerhouse Museum. The powerhouse comprises a series of large, interconnected, corrugated galvanised iron sheds of a sawn timber frame construction. Included within this structure are the engine room (1921, with extensions in 1947, 1966, 1973), gas producer room (1921, with extensions in 1938, 1950, 1954, 1962), workshop (1934) and amenities area (1938). The office and store were built in the mid 1960s. Of the earlier buildings, the engine room and its annexe and the gas producer room are of two distinct types of construction. The engine room is constructed of a sawn timber frame with a trussed roof structure. Both walls and roof sheeting have been replaced at least in parts. The amenities wing east of the engine room is similarly of sawn timber frame construction. The amenity rooms are clad in corrugated galvanised iron externally and lined internally with composition board. The workshop, constructed in 1934 is a sawn timber framed with trussed roof clad in corrugated iron without internal lining. By contrast, the gas producer rooms are constructed of large timber posts set directly into the ground and to which a sawn timber frame is attached. The building is clad with corrugated iron sheeting. Roof trusses, supporting corrugated roof sheeting, are themselves supported at mid-span by hardwood poles. Ten engine sets and gas producers are located within the engine and gas producer rooms. The galvanised iron cladding is attached to a timber framework on massive timber uprights. The full width and half-width suspended roof trusses are large scale with king and queen post construction. The separate office and store was built in the mid 1960s. To the east of this building is evidence of the cooling pond which was formerly the swimming baths.  Heritage listing  The former Longreach Powerhouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 June 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Longreach Powerhouse is significant providing evidence in the remaining buildings and machinery of the earliest generation of electricity in Longreach and the development of the industry within the district. The former Longreach Powerhouse is significant for the evidence contained within the surviving fabric that the generation of electricity was formerly a local undertaking. The size and scale of the powerhouse operation on this site from 1921-1985 signifies the role played by the local shire council in electrical generation as one of a number of services to the community of the town and district. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The surviving engines and equipment are significant as evidence of the first application of coal-fired gas producers in the electricity industry within Australia. This equipment was built specifically for the Longreach Powerhouse by Major Furnace and Combustions Pty Ltd in Melbourne. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former Powerhouse demonstrates the importance of the site to the town and provides landmark value to the area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. With an area initially gazetted for recreation purposes, including tennis courts, and also containing the local swimming pool, the site of the former Longreach Powerhouse is significant for its association with the people of Longreach both as a recreational reserve and later as the source of the town's electricity supply, ushering in a new era in the town's history and changing forever the lives of the people.

Scopelli was forbidden to enter the third order branch of that order during her adolescence and waited until her parents died to embrace the religious life. Scopelli was beatified on 24 August 1771 under Pope Clement XIV when the latter approved her local 'cultus' ‚Äì otherwise known as popular devotion ‚Äì and thus ratified her beatification. She was titled before this as a Servant of God in 1500 when the canonization cause commenced under Pope Alexander VI. Life Giovanna Scopelli was born in 1428 in Reggio Emilia to Simone and Caterina Scopelli. From her childhood she felt a strong attraction to the religious life though her parents disapproved of this vocation and forbade her to pursue it. Scopelli submitted to this and so led her austere and pious life at home until the death of her parents around 1480, when she then decided to form the Carmelite convent of Santa Maria del Popolo while in the process becoming one. Before she founded this a widow offered to collaborate with her and the former's two daughters and the four lived together in a makeshift convent ‚Äì a small house ‚Äì from 1480 until 1484. She later bought the church of Saint Bernard in 1485 with the aid of the Bishop Filippo Zoboli. Scopelli became the new convent's first prioress. She also refused all gifts ‚Äì and urged her fellow religious to do the same thing ‚Äì unless such gifts were given as alms with no conditions attached. In 1487 a priest was assigned to them as their confessor. The nuns became known as \\"The White Nuns\\". Scopelli died in mid-1491 and her remains were interred in the gardens of the convent, and were found to be incorrupt following their exhumation in 1492. Her convent was later suppressed in 1797 and her remains moved as a result in 1803. Beatification The beatification process commenced under Pope Alexander VI in 1500, when she became titled as a Servant of God and a tribunal was commissioned in order to collect testimonies. The cause reactivated with a diocesan process that was inaugurated in 1767 and concluded its business later in 1770. The process culminated on 24 August 1771 when her beatification received the formal approval of Pope Clement XIV who deemed that there was an enduring local 'cultus' ‚Äì otherwise known as popular and longstanding veneration ‚Äì to the late Scopelli.

Staff. The story takes place in the future, when humanity has colonized the moon. It has various cyberpunk elements, such as robotic artificial limbs, sinister corporations, memory uploading, and advanced cloning.  Plot  In the future, mankind has colonized the bleak expanses of the moon. Cities now stand proudly where there was once only desolation and emptiness. But there are alien forces that do not want mankind to succeed and only one man can stop them: Yoshiyuki Otomo. He is a member of the Bounty Dog Investigation Unit, a high-tech cybernetic mercenary team. The first episode introduces the setting and characters. Departing from Earth, Yoshiyuki Otomo and two other members of the Bounty Dogs travel on a commercial flight to a lunar colony. The colony is a city under a pressurized clear dome. Their objective is to gather information about a militarized mining company called Constans Operations, which they suspect of developing a powerful weapon. He meets a woman who looks almost identical his lover, Yayoi, who died on Earth a year prior. The mysterious woman explains that her name is Ines and acts erratically. Two men arrive and shoot her with tranquilizer darts. He fends off the men and flees carrying her. Once she recovers, she vanishes. He remembers Yayoi's dying words, which implied she would somehow meet him on the moon. His cybernetic arm converses with him, as it contains Yayoi's memories and DNA. Meanwhile, his teammates have also seen Ines, standing outside the dome of the lunar base, where no human should be able to survive. The team infiltrates Constans Operations to study \\"Project Kaguya.\\" On the way, they see Ines yet again on the side of the road and surrounded by armed soldiers, who are working for Constans. Against orders, he rescues her in a mecha-like high-mobility vehicle called the Manslave. They fight the soldiers and team is captured. Ines explains that she is a clone of an alien being called the Sleeper, which Constans is studying. Again, she vanishes. The Sleeper emits a wave of energy and, in the resulting chaos, he is injured and captured. In the second episode, Yoshiyuki is awakened in prison by Yayoi's voice coming from his cybernetic arm. Two more clones of the Sleeper have arrived, steal the module from his arm that contains Yayoi's DNA, and prepare to kill him. The Sleeper emits a beam of energy that punctures the dome over the city, exposing it to the vacuum of space. While prison is evacuated, the Bounty Dogs kill the evil clones and escape with Ines. As the situation on the base deteriorates, Ines explains that the Sleeper wanted the DNA to reverse genetic experiments done on it by Constans. The Sleeper has been studying humanity from inside the moon for 180,00 years, but now intends to destroy it in retaliation for its treatment. The team travels deep into the moon to find the Sleeper, but more clones appear and fight them. Ines is mortally wounded saving Yoshiyuki. Before she dies, she tells him how to kill the Sleeper. He does so, saving humanity, but losing his final connection to Yayoi. Alive, but with many unanswered questions, the Bounty Dogs join the evacuation to Earth.

It was built from 1870s circa to 1900s circa. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 June 2003.  History  The runs comprising Darr River Downs station were taken up during the early 1870s by a number of people, and were progressively acquired from 1876 by Baird, Rowan and Co., a group of Melbourne businessmen carrying on business together as sheep and cattle farmers. Although the Darr River Downs runs were recorded as being stocked with cattle initially, during the 1880s many of the newer pastoralists commenced raising sheep rather than cattle. Darr River Downs was consolidated during the late 1880s, and the lease taken up by Baird, Rowan and Co. The lease was transferred to William Taylor and Andrew Rowan, in partnership as Taylor, Rowan and Co, in 1888. Taylor and Rowan appear to have also been in partnership with Archibald Fisken and John Bertram, as in 1893, records indicate that the lease was transferred from Taylor, Rowan, Fisken and Bertram to the Trust and Agency Co. of Australasia. Rowan retired from the firm in 1897, and in August 1898, the lease again appears to have been held by Taylor, Fisken and Bertram. The lease was transferred to the Corporation of the Bank of Australasia later in 1898. Darr River Downs, described in an advertisement in 1888 as a \\"First- class sheep station in Queensland...comprising about eleven hundred square miles, [704 000 acres]\\", was one of three large pastoral properties established in the district as a result of the consolidation of runs. The other two properties were Corona and Evesham. A stone storehouse is understood to have been erected and used as the homestead on the station for some years, before a new stone homestead was erected. Other stone outbuildings were probably erected around this time. The stone for these buildings was quarried from the bed of the nearby Darr River. Wool scouring developed as an alternative to sheep washing in Australia from the 1840s, and had almost replaced it by the 1890s. The Darr River Downs woolscour, reputedly the first to be erected in this part of Queensland, is thought to have been built during the early-mid 1880s. Construction of the scour has been attributed to the desire of the owners to overcome the difficulties involved in presenting buyers at the London wool sales with the cleanest possible wool. A document outlining the approximate cost of improvements on the Station suggests that the woolscour may have been erected in two stages, in 1883 and 1886, and it is recorded also that in 1886, Darr River Downs scoured its own wool for the first time. Darr River Downs was running approximately 135 550 sheep in 1890, and in 1893, the property recorded 1725 bales of wool. The document outlining improvements to the station records also that a woolshed was erected on the property . During the shearers' strike in 1891, a group of striking shearers unsuccessfully attempted to burn down the woolshed. A new woolshed appears to have been erected, possibly in the early 1900s, and is reputed to have formerly been a temporary pavilion/annexe for the Melbourne Exhibition, which was dismantled and shipped to Rockhampton, then transported to Darr River Downs where it was re-erected as the woolshed. An official record of the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880-1881 noted that the temporary annexes erected for the Exhibition were constructed of corrugated iron and timber, and the materials were subsequently sold at fair prices to the Victorian Railway Department to be utilised in building shed & c at railway stations. It is not clear whether all of the annexes were sold to the Railways Department, or whether some may have been disposed of elsewhere. It is also of interest to note that an A Fisken (presumably Archibald Fisken, a prominent Melbourne businessman who was involved with Darr River Downs during the late 1890s) was listed in the Exhibition record as one of the Commissioners of the Exhibition, and therefore may have been involved in acquiring one of the annexes for Darr River Downs. The woolshed was located just over one mile from the homestead, and included large holding pens for the sheep, and shearers' quarters. Records of the station buildings in 1904 refer to a complex of buildings including homestead, house kitchen, quarters, store, wheelwrights and carpenters shop, stables, and huts. In March 1910, the property was transferred to James Henry Coleman and Edward James Watt, of New Zealand, and was transferred into Watt's name in 1918. Watt was described as a generous employer, who, following the First World War, subdivided from Darr River Downs, and gave it to four of the men who had worked on Darr River Downs and returned from the War. Watt died in 1942, and Darr River Downs was acquired by TC Lowry, Watt's nephew, in 1950. Following Lowry's death in the mid 1970s, the property passed to Lowry's son and other members of the Lowry family. The property was acquired by the present owners in 1989. The portion of land on which the homestead and outbuildings, including the woolshed and woolscour ruins are located presently comprises . The woolshed, formerly crucifix-shaped in plan, has been partially dismantled and sections of the building re-erected on other properties in the area. The woolshed is still in use by Darr River Downs and other properties in the district. The homestead was extensively renovated .  Description  Darr River Downs, located to the west of Darr River northeast of Morella, consists of a homestead, office and saddle room, store, woolshed, woolscour ruins and cemetery. The homestead has been substantially altered, although parts of the original internal and external walls and paving stones around the exterior have been retained. All early internal joinery and linings have been removed. The homestead building is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The office and saddle room, a single-storeyed structure with a hipped corrugated iron roof and verandahs all round, is constructed of rough- squared field stone with clay mortar. Verandahs have tree trunk verandah posts and earth floors. The store, a single-storeyed structure with a hipped corrugated iron roof and verandahs all round, is constructed of field stone with clay mortar. Internally, the building has stone paved floors and the roof is unlined. The woolshed, located approximately two kilometres to the east of the homestead complex, is a corrugated iron clad structure with timber stumps and consists of arched metal trusses over a T-shaped plan. Internally, the building has timber floors, timber fencing and gates and evidence of early shearing equipment. The woolscour ruins are located to the north of the homestead complex. The cemetery, to the south of the homestead complex, is surrounded by a timber post and rail fence and contains two graves with headstones and metal surrounds.  Heritage listing  Darr River Downs was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 June 2003 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Established in the early 1870s, Darr River Downs is important in demonstrating the evolution of the pastoral industry in Queensland. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The construction and layout of the woolshed, with the use of prefabricated arched metal trusses is rare and uncommon. The woolscour ruins () are a rare example of an early use of new technology which even by the late nineteenth century was only common in regional centres. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The surviving 19th and early 20th century structures have the potential to contribute to an understanding of building technology and wool processing in western Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Darr River Downs demonstrates the principal characteristics of a late nineteenth century/early twentieth century pastoral station by the layout, materials, scale and design. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Darr River Downs demonstrates the principal characteristics of a late nineteenth century/early twentieth century pastoral station by the layout, materials, scale and design. Together with mature plantings, these elements contribute to the aesthetic significance of the place. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The woolshed and woolscour remains also demonstrate a high degree of technical achievement for the period, through the early use of mechanical wool washing techniques and metal truss construction.

He established the earliest ideas for the activated sludge process of sewage treatment by examining bacterial growth and noting their oxygen requirement. Life and career Fowler was born in Paris and was educated at Sidcot School and then Owen's College, Manchester where he later joined to work as a Demonstrator in Chemistry. His early work was in metallurgy and he received a Dalton Prize for his study on silver suboxide. Fowler then joined the chemistry department of the University of Manchester as a lecturer and then worked as a consultant to the Rivers Committee. He worked on effluent treatment and received a D.Sc. from Heidelberg University in 1904. His major advance was in noting the need of oxygen by bacteria and he found that the removal of sludge from sewage was counterproductive to decomposition. He devised a system for aeration that retained the sludge and introduced the idea of activated sludge. He was much sought out by cities across the world including New York, Shanghai, Cairo and Calcutta. He was a regular visitor to India from 1906 and became a permanent resident in 1916 after taking up position as a Professor of Applied Chemistry at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. His early research was in the fermentation of mahua flowers to produce alcohol and then to produce acetone for use in the manufacture of ammunitions. A factory was established at Nasik under his supervision. In 1921 he headed a newly created department of biochemistry at the Indian Institute of Science. Here he was especially interested in the conservation of nitrogen for agricultural applications and worked on processes to utilize waste from agriculture and industry. He established an activated sludge sewage treatment plant on the campus. He lived most of his life in Bangalore except for a brief stint as a Principal of the Harcourt Butler Technological Institute at Kanpur from 1927 to 1927. He died at Central Hotel in Bangalore on 21 March 1953. His wife Amy Hindmarsh and two sons survived him.  Writings  Fowler wrote several books including Sewage Works Analyses (1902), An Introduction to Bacteriological and Enzyme Chemistry (1911), An introduction to the biochemistry of nitrogen conservation (1934). In 1935 he patented a process to separate solids from liquids in sludge and sewage treatment. He was an ardent Christian scientist and after his retirement took an interest in economics and energetics and wanted to reform currency. He suggested a currency called the \\"ERN\\" which was the protein equivalent having 10 grams of nitrogen or the energy derived from it, 300 calories. The value of any commodity or service would then be the energy needed to produce it in terms of ERN units.  Honours  Fowler was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, the Chemical Society of England and the Royal Sanitary Institute. He also served as member of the Industrial Research Council of the Government of India from 1937 to 1939.

Life and work  Margetson was born at Camberwell in Surrey. He studied at Dulwich College, and later at the Royal College of Art and the Royal Academy of Arts. In 1885 he first exhibited at the Royal Academy, and later also at the Royal Society of British Artists, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters and the Grosvenor Gallery. Margetson painted in oils and watercolours. He made his name with portraits of beautiful women, often with modern hairstyles and hats. He also created religious and allegorical artworks. To begin with he worked in an academic, Victorian style. Later he would use a looser brushstyle inspired by the post-impressionists and the pre-raphaelites, and in particular Lawrence Alma-Tadema. His most successful work was the classically decorative The Sea Hath its Pearls which he exhibited in 1897 at the Royal Academy, now in the possession of the Art Gallery of New South Wales, in Australia. A portrait of Alfred Tennyson by Margetson is in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Margetson also worked as an illustrator of books. He was married to the artist Helen Hatton, who he met when they worked on an illustration project together. He lived and worked first in London and later in Blewbury and Wallingford.

It stars Devon Terrell, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Mitchell, Ashley Judd, Jenna Elfman, Ellar Coltrane, Avi Nash, and Linus Roache. It was screened in the Special Presentations section at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was released on Netflix on December 16, 2016. Plot In 1981, a 20-year-old Barack Obama, commonly known as Barry, arrives in New York City to attend Columbia University as a transfer student from Occidental College. Unable to contact his expected roommate, Will, Barry spends the night in the streets. The next day, Barry succeeds in contacting Saleem, a man he met at a party a few months back, who welcomes him in his apartment. Later, Barry meets his roommate Will and they both begin to live in their off-campus apartment on 109th street. As they are walking to class, Barry meets his neighbors when one of them asks for a cigarette. In class, Barry is engaged as a student and participates in classroom debates about philosophy and American society. While in New York, he behaves as a man apart from everyone, not sure of what he has to do to feel accepted. During his political science class, Barry meets Charlotte, a nice girl who seems to have an interest for debates. When he is not in class, Barry is playing basketball. While playing basketball, Barry soon gets nicknamed \\"The Invisible Man\\" by PJ, a graduate student at Columbia who grew up in the Grants Houses in Harlem. Later that night, Will and Barry both attend a frat party at Columbia where they see Charlotte again. Charlotte and Barry leave the party and go to a club downtown where they form a closer connection and begin to date. The next day, Charlotte and Barry watch a political debate on TV. While Barry is inattentive about politics and declares his love really lies in art, Charlotte tells him it's his \\"civic duty\\" to care about politics and their nation. As their love interest grows, Barry continues to wonder about his place in society, New York, and the condition of other black people in the city. The next day Charlotte and Barry go on a date in Central Park, and later that day after playing basketball within Columbia, Barry grabs lunch with PJ, who tells him he's majoring in finance and hopes to work at the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street. Around Thanksgiving, at a bar with Barry and Saleem, Charlotte asks Barry to meet her parents. Barry refuses and Charlotte then asks him to meet them later on at her sister's wedding. Finally, Barry accepts. In Harlem, he experiences the contrast of black life in New York City, from speaking with friends and buying the book The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois to witnessing a vulgar confrontation between a white woman and a group of black Israelites. Later in the park, he attempts to write a long, overdue letter to his father in Kenya but struggles to find the words. After going back to Saleem's apartment, Charlotte and Barry are surprised to find Barry's mother, Ann Dunham, there. Charlotte asks a lot of questions of Ann about Barry's father and childhood as she is frustrated that Barry kept so much of his private life to himself. That night, Barry and his mom see a movie and walk around Central Park where he discloses to her that he is unsure about his place in New York and where he feels he should belong. Ann tries her best to reassure him, but the answers leave him unsatisfied. The next day, Barry is invited to a private club and are welcomed by Charlotte's parents Kathy and Bill and enjoys a nice dinner with them. Barry explains his early life to Charlotte's parents ‚Äì his mixed race parents, their backgrounds, and his living situation in Hawaii, Indonesia and California, but Charlotte feels closed-off as Barry rarely discloses anything personal to her. While walking home Barry and Charlotte have an aggressive and potentially violent confrontation with a friend of his neighbor's, who resents his presence in the neighborhood and views Barry as an elitist. The following morning, Barry and Charlotte are walking in Harlem when Barry begins to feels uncomfortable as people are surprised to see him with a white woman. At lunch this anxious feeling continues as Barry explains to Charlotte that everybody is looking at him. They have an argument which ends with Charlotte saying to Barry that she loves him. Barry, surprised, only responds \\"thank you\\", then leaves to go play basketball. The following day, Barry is invited by PJ and the people in his basketball group to attend a party in Harlem. At the party, Barry learns about New York's housing projects and the treatment reserved to the lower classes. Barry also meets an attractive woman named Denise and is then punched in the face by Denise's boyfriend, who thought that Barry was attempting to seduce her. As Barry leaves the party drunk, he returns to campus only to be racially profiled by security guard Eddie and asked to show his ID to confirm he's a student. Barry begins to get into an angry argument with Eddie, but Thad, a white classmate from his political science class who is openly holding a beer can, intervenes. Frustrated by Thad's personality and his lack of acknowledgement of the double standards around him, Barry calls Thad an asshole and then goes to Charlotte's apartment where he attempts to hook-up with her. Charlotte refuses when she sees the wound on his face and tries to comfort him. While sitting on her bed looking at pictures she took of him, Barry gets in a fight with Charlotte and questions their relationship until Charlotte goes to sleep and leaves him alone. A few days later on the day of Charlotte's sister's wedding, Barry receives a phone call. He learns that his father has died in a car accident (1982). Shocked, Barry doesn't talk to Charlotte about it while they are on their way to her sister's wedding and becomes very closed off when Charlotte tries to understand what Barry is keeping to himself. At the wedding, Charlotte's mother introduces Barry to Grace Lee Boggs and James Boggs, a mixed race couple in their late 50s who were involved as civil rights activists in the '60s. Barry confides in them about his inner turmoil and the confusion he has about his identity. The couple reassures him that, above all else, he is American and he is not obligated to choose a social standing. They tell him that he should take inspiration from the ones who came before him and to carry the baton of hope as far as he can. Finally, Barry receives advice that begins to comfort him and he starts to find peace within himself. Later at the wedding, while they're dancing, it is assumed Barry breaks up with Charlotte as he simply leaves her on the dance floor; he then goes for a walk outside and reads the letter he was going to send to his father as he was finally trying to contact him. A few days later, Barry is playing basketball where he meets a young boy who looks like him, and together they play HORSE. The boy asks him where he is from, a question Barry has always struggled to answer. Much more at ease with himself, Barry answers the question by saying, \\"I'm here now.\\" Cast * Devon Terrell as Barack \\"Barry\\" Obama * Anya Taylor-Joy as Charlotte Baughman * Jason Mitchell as PJ * Ellar Coltrane as Will * Ashley Judd as Ann Dunham * Jenna Elfman as Kathy Baughman * Avi Nash as Saleem * John Benjamin Hickey as Professor Gray *Tommy Nelson as Buzz * Linus Roache as Bill Baughman * Danny Hoch as Eddie * Sawyer Pierce as Thad * Robert G.

History In 1986, Domenico Menniti founded a firm named PDM, along with his brothers and his business partners Enzo Menniti, and Paolo and Massimo Montefusco. The firm focused primarily on leather gloves, but in 1993 it expanded with its first collection of swimming trunks. Then, in 1995, the collection grew with the addition of shirts, trousers and sweaters. Their first boutique opened in 2000 in Frattamaggiore, Naples. Shortly afterwards, a new boutique was opened in Capri and another one in Miami, Florida. The product line Harmont & Blaine Junior was launched in 2005 by AGB Company, which owned the licence. In 2006, PDM was renamed to Harmont & Blaine. Many months after, a special meeting approved an assets increase on 1 October 2007. In 2008, the firm Giano signed a business deal for the production and distribution of a new product line of Harmont & Blaine, named Harmont & Blaine Shoes.

Career  = Singer = Greville was first taught by her mother, who studied with Marchesi. She studied with Field Hyde in London and went to Milan to study with Alfredo Morelli in the early 1920s. She studied diction with Plunkett Greene. Her first recital in London was in 1920. She performed in England, Germany, Austria, and Spain. She did multiple tours in the US. Greville performed a recital at the Town Hall in New York on October 16 and October 24, 1926. = Sackbut magazine = Greville became editor of The Sackbut in July 1921 and she remained editor until 1934. She was in a relationship with John Kenneth Curwen, the publisher of the magazine, and had no prior experience so the decision was seen as controversial. She also composed some songs which were published through her husband's company, Curwen Press. = Recording engineer = Greville was the recording engineer and part owner of Synchrophone Company, which was formed by Hans Knudsen in 1919 but purchased by Curwen in 1930. Synchrophone was formed to use a vacant record factory in Hertford, England. The factory's previous tenant was Metropole Record (who made Piccadilly and Melba records). In the 1934, Synchrophone started issuing under the label Octacros. Octacros recordings were single-sided 12\\" records to be played with short 16mm films. Cinemas would buy the records under a 12-month contract. The records were not sold to the public and are now considered rare. From 1934 to 1937, Greville was the recording director and the label had three other engineers. Octacros was bought out in 1937 by Decca. Greville engineered over one dozen records of Frank Newman playing the Christie Theatre organ at the Plaza Cinema (in Rugby, Great Britain) for Octacros. Collector Adrian Tuddenham noted the quality of these records was poor because the company was in financial trouble and had to use subpar materials and recording equipment as a result. The organ had been moved shortly before the recording which left Greville with a less than ideal location for placing a microphone. In addition, the audio had been sent by a 'high quality' telephone line to Hertford where it was captured. Personal life Greville was married in 1910 to publisher John Kenneth Curwen.Dyment, Christopher (2012) Toscanini in Britain, Boydell Press (p79) The two had a son, Knowles, born in 1925.

It was built from 1912 to 1913. It is also known as Aramac Tramway Station. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999.  History  The Aramac Tramway Museum is located within the Aramac Tramway Station. The Aramac Tramway was constructed in 1912‚Äì1913, funded by the Aramac Shire Council. It closed on 31 December 1975. When Queensland separated from New South Wales in 1859, the new Queensland Government was quick to throw open land for grazing, and a great wave of pastoral settlement swept across western and northern Queensland in the early 1860s. The establishment of towns in the west soon followed, for example Tambo, Blackall and Aramac which developed as commercial centres to service the pastoral industry. Aramac Town Reserve was gazetted on 26 June 1869 and the first businesses were established in the town that same year. On 6 April 1880, local government commenced when the Aramac Divisional Board, established under the Divisional Boards Act 1879, held its first meeting in the Court House. Nineteenth century Queensland development was further influenced by the pattern of building railway lines west into the hinterlands from the major ports, first Main Line railway from near Brisbane in 1865, then the Central Western railway line from Rockhampton in 1867 and the Great Northern Railway from Townsville in 1880. The Central Western Line reached Barcaldine in 1886 and was extended to Longreach in 1892. These towns were founded when the railway arrived, and had the immediate effect of taking business away from the nearby well-established towns of Aramac and Blackall. Throughout Australia, the early twentieth century heralded a time of rapid railway expansion, and competition between towns for services was fierce. Aramac had first asked for a railway extension in 1896, without success. Ten years later, in 1906, a deputation of Aramac Councillors visited the Premier, William Kidston, seeking his support for the railway. It also failed. Despite these disappointing responses, the Aramac Shire Council (the successor to the Aramac Divisional Board) persevered with their plans. In 1908 Council asked the Queensland Treasury for a special loan of to finance a survey of the route of the proposed line. With some reservation from the Railways Department, the Council was granted its survey loan, and employed George Phillips to peg out the route from Aramac to Barcaldine. When the survey was completed, Council moved in March 1906 to borrow to build the tramway. The Railways Department responded by commissioning two reports on the best commercial link between the Central Western and Great Northern lines. The second of these recommended the shortest and least expensive method of connecting the lines was by the Longreach to Winton route, and the Railways Commissioner decided in favour of this route. Although it was to be another eighteen years before the Longreach- Winton line opened, the Aramac Shire Council committed itself to the courageous decision to construct a tramway for which the Council would be financially responsible. In March 1911, Treasury approval was given for a loan to Aramac Shire Council to build the Barcaldine-Aramac tramway. George Phillips was appointed Engineer in charge of construction. Another question for Council was exactly where the tramway station was to be located. In June 1911 Council fixed the station site \\"at the Eastern End of Gordon Street about 100 yards before the bore drain\\". That point was to become the end of the track, where the locomotive shed was built; the station building was actually built about to the south, near the end of McWhannell Street. Construction from the Central Western Line commenced at Lagoon Creek, west of the Barcaldine railway station, on 14 February 1912. The construction standard that Phillips adopted was the minimum acceptable to the Queensland Railways Commissioner; although the tramway belonged to the Council, it needed to conform to Queensland Railways specifications because government rolling stock would be using it. The line was to be 3 ft 6 in gauge, with very light Moss Bay rails. For most of its length, the line had no ballast, with the sleepers simply laid on levelled earth. This was a technique Phillips had pioneered on the Croydon- Normanton railway (now the Gulflander), and while it was frowned on by most railway engineers, it was satisfactory under light loads on level going. As most of the route extended over open grassed plains, simply following the gentle rise and fall of the ground, there was very little earthwork to do. There were only about 12 bends on the line, one cutting and no embankments, and 24 wooden trestle bridges, most of them over small creeks. Because the route ran through grazing country, the whole line was stock-fenced. Despite this cheap and simple construction, there were to be long delays in building the line. Only of line had been laid by April 1912. Unusually heavy rain on the blacksoil plains held up progress, and the workers struck for higher pay. The late delivery of sleepers was a constant problem throughout the project. In August the line reached the halfway point, and on 12 September the of track to Mildura siding were officially opened to traffic. These delays meant that construction expenses had been heavier than Phillip's estimates, and in November the money ran out. Council was forced to go to the Queensland Treasury for another loan of to complete the work. The total cost of the completed tramway was , one third more than Phillips' estimate. By May 1913 the bridges over Aramac Creek were being built, and the tramway was approaching town. Final preparations were underway as the construction phase neared completion. The station buildings were being built by O'Brien and Company, and a contract was signed with Blair Athol Coal Company for the supply of coal. Phillips was to be kept on as Supervising Engineer after the line opened. The first locomotive to work the line was already in use during the construction work. It was an elderly Avonside Engine Company B12, built in 1877, which had spent many years in Queensland Railways service as Engine No 31 before being purchased by Aramac Shire Council to become Aramac Tramway Engine No 1. The official opening of the tramway took place on 2 July 1913. It was expected that the work would be completed by then, but unseasonal rain had again delayed construction, so the line was still a few hundred metres short of its objective. As the date had been chosen to coincide with the festivities of the annual race meeting, the opening went ahead regardless. The ceremony was held at the end of the completed line, which at that time was between the two channels of Aramac. The Honourable Walter Paget, Minister for Railways, performed the opening. First train to cross the bridge into Armac, 1913 Despite the official opening, there were still two more months of construction work ahead. Building the line took 19 months in all, and it was not until September 1913 that the bridge over Aramac Creek was completed, and the first train steamed into Aramac Tramway Station. The station at the Aramac terminus of the line was the place where passengers and goods from all over the district converged on departing trains, and dispersed from arriving ones. The activities at the tramway terminus were spread out over a distance of about running up the eastern side of the town, with the three east‚Äìwest streets of the town grid all terminating at the tramway yards. Trains arriving in Aramac crossed the bridges over the creek channels and steamed up the grade into the station. The main line led directly into the passenger station, and the train stopped under a large timber-framed corrugated iron canopy covering the line, an unusual and prominent building. The station master's office, ticket office and waiting rooms were in the weatherboard station building alongside the canopy, and when a train was due a row of taxicabs stood waiting in the street outside. Ahead of the train, built over the end of the main line, was the locomotive shed, and near it were the coal stage and the station master's residence. When passengers had alighted, the train was reversed onto a side line which led to the goods shed and the wool loading platform, back in the direction of Aramac Creek. Here goods and parcels were unloaded into the shed which still stands, and a row of trucks and wagons lined up on the other side of the concrete platform to collect merchandise for the town's businesses. The Aramac yard had four tracks for shunting, and a triangle running east from the main line for turning the locomotives. That line also led to the sheep and cattle loading ramps and yards, east of the station. Immediately it opened, the tramway had a beneficial impact on the economy of Aramac. Wool, the staple product of the district, was carried to market faster and more efficiently. From places all over the shire, goods, passengers and business which had once gone by road to the government railway stations at Longreach, Barcaldine or Jericho now all converged on the town of Aramac. The whole town took on an air of bustle and excitement with the arrival of every train, and all its businesses benefited. The tramway offered four regular passenger services each week, with additional trains for goods and livestock as required. In 1915, the second full year of operation, the tramway carried over of wool and of general goods, over 250,000 sheep and nearly 7000 passengers. The graziers and shopkeepers who made up the Aramac Shire Council found themselves in the unfamiliar business of running a railway, and it was to form a prominent part of their agenda for the next 62 years. The tramway was a financial success, but only marginally so; even in the busy year of 1915, total revenue was only 8% greater than expenditure. Running expenses had to be watched very closely, and many Council meetings became largely concerned with tramway management issues such as timetables, claims for delayed goods, locomotive maintenance, mail contracts and coal purchases. Experience showed that the old Engine No 1 was not sufficiently powerful to operate the line, and in November 1914 Council resolved to call tenders for a second larger B15 steam locomotive. Engine No 113 was leased from Queensland Railways for a time, but proved unsatisfactory and was returned to State service. Then in late 1915 Council bought B15 class engine No 308 second-hand from the Railways Department for . It had been built by Walkers Limited at Maryborough in 1897, and now became Aramac Engine No 2. The older engine remained in service for light work until it was scrapped in 1939. The engine shed was lengthened to take the second engine in 1915, and the bridges on the line were strengthened to take the extra weight. Somewhat surprisingly, a Council meeting in November 1915 passed the motion offering the tramway to the Queensland Government and that the Minister for Railways be now written asking the Government to take it over as a government line. This may be the first indication that Council had doubts about the future viability of the tramway, or it may simply have been part of the plan from the beginning. There is no record that any reply was ever received from the Queensland Government. The initial success of the tramway was not to last. Drought, industrial unrest, and the economic slowdown brought on by the departure of volunteers from throughout the district to the First World War all combined to reduce traffic on the tramway. Between 1914 and 1918 Council brought in severe cost-cutting measures. George Phillips was dismissed as engineer when it was believed the government would take over the line, and no other engineer was ever employed. Half the maintenance gang was laid off, and staff were withdrawn from the sidings along the line. In 1918 the station master's cottage at the Mildura siding was moved into Aramac and rented to the Aramac station master. Previously, employees had been paid the same rates as their Queensland Railways equivalents; now their wages were reduced by a third. Timetabled services were reduced to two a week, and freights and fares were raised. The Council managed to keep the operations of the tramway running profitably during this difficult time, but only at the twin costs of making the service less attractive to customers, and reducing maintenance on the line. After the first few years, the condition of the track began to suffer. Phillips' cheap construction methods had a serious downside, for the un- ballasted track was very difficult to maintain. It quickly deteriorated, giving passengers a rough ride, and leading to frequent derailments. The heavier B15 locomotive in use after 1915 exacerbated the problem. The decision to dispense with engineering advice and reduce track maintenance to only the minimum level of necessary repairs was a critical moment in the Aramac tramway's history. While successfully cutting operating costs in the short term, it meant that the tramway would have to carry smaller loads at slower speeds, giving customers a declining level of service over the years. The progressively deteriorating track would eventually doom its operations altogether. Business picked up in the post-war era, services were increased again, and the tramway held its own and continued to run at a small profit each year. The accumulated reserve was sufficient to encourage Council to seek a Treasury loan of to buy a new locomotive in 1924. The new engine was a PB15 built in the Ipswich railway workshops, and the first locomotive to be purpose-built for the Aramac line, unlike the two second-hand government ones already in service. Traffic steadily declined as the 1920s advanced, and although the tramway continued to provide an economic benefit to the Aramac district, Council struggled to break even financially in most years. The service was never again as popular or as successful as it had been at the outset, and drought and rural depression continued to keep business down. There was increasing competition from road transport as private motor cars and trucks became cheaper and more popular in the 1920s. Operating perilously close to the edge of viability, the tramway faced a catastrophe in 1928 when cyclonic rains flooded the district. The damage to the line stopped all traffic for weeks, and the lost revenue combined with the cost of repairs sent the accounts for the year heavily into the red. Council had to levy a special rate to pay the tramway's expenses, and was unable to meet its loan repayments that year; there was no option but to go to State Treasury and negotiate a three-year suspension of payments. The tramway's prosperous heyday was over, and it was to be many years before things improved. The deepening depression made the situation even worse, and saw staff retrenchments and the withdrawal of concession fares and freight rebates for primary producers. The onset of the Second World War brought further austerity; there were constant labour and material shortages, and it was difficult to buy coal. By 1944 the tramway was offering the bare minimum of service to customers, and Council had exhausted almost every trick it knew to keep it running. Scheduled services had again been cut back to twice weekly, and track maintenance was reduced to only the most urgent and necessary repairs. The two old engines had both been scrapped, and the only locomotive left in service was now 20 years old. Treasury had been waiving interest and loan repayment for years, and had written off a part of the debt; effectively the Queensland Government was subsidising the Aramac tramway because it was cheaper to do so than to provide an alternative service to the Aramac district at government expense. For three generations the tramway station was the main focus of Aramac's economic and social life. It was a very busy but also a very intimate enterprise in a small tight-knit community. The layout of the Aramac station changed over time, brought about by changes in the operation of the line. The locomotive shed, for example, was built in 1913 to house one locomotive, then doubled in length in 1915 to house two. It was apparently not lengthened again after 1912; Engine No 1 sat outside for the remainder of its life. The shed was shortened again after 1943, when there was once more only one locomotive in service. Then in 1958 when the tramway went over to diesel power, the old shed was demolished and a new and even smaller shed was built to house the much shorter engine. The other two major buildings - the station and goods shed - had no need for any such functional changes and remained virtually unaltered from 1913 onwards, the station until it was demolished in 1976, and the goods shed to the present day. In the post-war era the Aramac tramway faced its greatest challenge ever as its principal competitor, road transport, became stronger and more popular. Since 1945 the face of Australian transport has been completely transformed by ever bigger and more powerful trucks operating on much better roads. If the tramway had been faced with this challenge in its enfeebled condition of the 1930s, it would have been defeated very quickly. There were two important changes ahead for the tramway. The first was brought about by a dramatic boom in the post-war rural economy, which saw the price of some agricultural products increase by as much as ten to twenty times between 1939 and the early 1950s. Small outback towns such as Aramac experienced a sudden return to a level of prosperity not seen for decades. Traffic on the tramway picked up steadily from 1945 onwards, and while there was still a large burden of debt to overcome before the Council could think about declaring a profit, operations by the early 1950s were again running at a more comfortable level. The second change was a complete transformation of the tramway, by means of both long-overdue repairs to the track and the purchase of a new engine. Years of neglected maintenance had left the railway line in a deteriorated condition. In 1957 the Railways Department gave Council an ultimatum that unless the track was substantially upgraded, it would no longer permit government-owned rolling stock to be used on the Aramac run. The increased prosperity of the district enabled Council both to increase freight charges and levy ratepayers, raising which was spent on the first major repairs to the line in many years, including rebuilding of the bridges. There was also a major upgrading of the motive power driving the tramway. In 1957, Council ordered a 150-horsepower Comeng diesel-hydraulic locomotive to replace its 33 year old steam engine. It was cheaper to run and easier to maintain, and weighing only , it was much less subject to derailment and bogging. The old PB15 steam locomotive was sold to Queensland Government Railways, and the new diesel engine commenced service on 17 January 1958. After fifty years of service with four locomotives, the tramway in 1963 finally hit upon the ideal vehicle for the line. To supplement the little diesel engine, Council bought a second-hand railmotor, RM 28, from the State service for . The railmotor remained in service for as long as the tramway operated. It was much lighter than a conventional locomotive, and its weight was spread more evenly over its length, so it performed much better on the rough track. Derailments became almost unknown, and in wet weather the locomotive sat in its shed while the railmotor was pressed into service. Council bought still another new diesel locomotive in 1968. The 1958 locomotive was a little under-powered for heavy loads, and was supplemented by a slightly bigger diesel-hydraulic locomotive built by Walkers Limited. For a time the two engines could be coupled together and operated as a single unit, but in January 1970 the Queensland Government bought the old diesel locomotive. These developments and improvements of the 1950s and 1960s kept the tramway going into the post-war era, but they could not change the economic circumstances in which the service operated. Road transport was becoming faster and more efficient year by year, and the tramway simply could not compete. Passenger traffic dwindled to virtually nothing by the 1960s because nearly everyone travelled by car. Wool and livestock increasingly travelled by truck in dry weather. The tramway was only eking out an existence, and Council's aim was simply to keep the financial loss down as low as possible. The losses remained acceptable until 1970, then there was a sharp drop in income as competition from road transport really began to take hold. The condition of the track, reconditioned over ten years before, was again becoming a big problem, and there was industrial trouble with the workforce. The Queensland Government agreed to subsidise the tramway service until the road was sealed from Aramac to Barcaldine. A Tramways Undertaking Fund was established, and State Treasury began to pay the annual shortfall. While this arrangement was in force, the great floods of January 1974 caused major damage to the line, and the cost of repairs dramatically increased the debt. The progressively increasing debt to the Queensland Government added to the money owed to Treasury over the entire life of the tramway, since the original loan of 1911. By 1975, the accumulated size of the government loan was $225,000, and there was no longer any prospect of reducing it. The road was already sealed about halfway from Barcaldine, and the likelihood was that traffic on the tramway would soon shrink to nothing. No longer an asset to the Shire's economy, the tramway had become simply a burden on the ratepayers. In November 1975, the Permanent Way Inspector gave a gloomy description of the state of the track. In the face of this report, Council decided to close the Tramway. It was decided that the service would terminate on 31 December 1975, and tenders would be called for the sale of of steel rails and the diesel locomotive. The tramway ran its last service at some time in the days just before New Year 1976. In February 1976, four tenders were received for the purchase of of steel rails and the eight year old locomotive. Council accepted the tender of from the Australian Sugar Producers Association, and the tracks were torn up and trucked away over the next few months. The bitumen-sealed road arrived in Aramac a few months after the tramway closed. The closure of the tramway left the Council's financial situation unresolved, for there was uncertainty about the status of the Tramways Undertaking Fund, and whether it had been composed of outright grants, or loans which had to be repaid. State Treasury took the view that the Aramac Shire should use the tramway sale money to repay the Queensland Government's contribution to the Fund. The State Treasurer wrote to the Aramac Shire Council accordingly; however politics were to intervene in the Council's favour when the State Treasurer, Sir Gordon Chalk, Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, retired from Parliament after 29 years in politics on 13 August 1976. Aramac Shire kept the surplus tramway money. After the tramway closed, its few remaining assets were dispersed. The railway station building was in poor condition because of termite infestation, and was demolished in 1976. The goods shed remained standing, as did the cold store near the station, which remained in service as a Council facility. The railmotor and its carriages, two maintenance trolleys, and some other passenger carriages that the tramway had acquired over the years were placed in a steel mesh cage on a short length of the main line near the goods shed. In 1986 a group of railway history enthusiasts requested a railmotor carriage and with Council's approval removed it to a museum at Kunkala (near Rosewood). The next wave of interest in the conservation of the remaining relics of the tramway came from two schoolteachers who galvanised community members into organising a local historical museum based at the goods shed. This involved housing the railmotor inside the goods shed by means of the major operation of demolishing and later rebuilding the end wall. The Aramac Tramway Museum opened on 29 September 1994, and the Aramac Tramway Museum Association was incorporated in 1997. The Tramway Museum has also become a focus for local historical activity generally, and in recent years people have donated a number of items which have been stored in and around the goods shed. There has also been a proposal put forward to reinstate a section of track to run the railmotor as a tourist attraction, and Queensland Rail has donated sleepers and rails for a kilometre of track.  Description  The principal elements of the Tramway Museum are the goods shed, six other buildings, other structures and relics of the tramway, rolling stock, the local history collection housed in the goods shed, and machinery and vehicles in the open air. =Goods Shed= The most substantial relic of the tramway is the goods shed, built at the time the line opened in 1913, and used for the entire period it operated. The goods shed is rectangular in plan, about long and wide. It is timber-framed with a corrugated iron roof, and clad with chamferboards externally. The roof is unlined, and there is an air gap of about between the roof and the tops of the side walls. The interior walls have been lined with opened-out wool bales, displaying the station brands of the Aramac district that once travelled on the tramway. The interior of the building is quite dark, lit only by the doorway, some fluorescent lights on the overhead beams, and a small amount of light that comes in over the tops of the side walls. On the railway side of the goods shed, a concrete platform four metres wide runs the entire length of the building, and extends further at the southern end. The interior of the goods shed is dominated by the railmotor \\"Aunt Emma\\", which is positioned in a cage of steel pipe and wire mesh running down the central axis of the building. As the cage is about wide and long, it leaves little space inside the building. Around the railmotor cage is a corridor a little more than a metre wide, fenced on both sides. Historical material is displayed between the fenced corridor and the walls of the goods shed. At the northern end of the goods shed, an area three metres wide running the width of the building has been set up as the Tramway Office, with a safe, desks and cupboards, some from the goods shed and some removed from the demolished railway station. Most of the collection in this area is directly relevant to the tramway: there are original tickets, waybills, reports. rubber stamps, and some important memorabilia preserved from the tramway closure, including a handwritten feltpen notice advising: \\"Due to the closure of this tramway all goods and parcels will have to be collected from goods shed, office and railway wagons before 4.00 pm Wednesday 31-12-75\\". On the wall is a photocopy of the cheque from the Australian Sugar Producers Association for , dated 10 June 1976. There are some historic photographs of the tramway on display, and two interpretation signs, one about the closure and one about \\"Aunt Emma\\". There are also rate assessment books and other Council documents on display in this area. Housed along the walls on the other three sides of the goods shed is a general collection of historical material, very little of which is connected with the Aramac tramway. There are a wide range of household items, including clothing, chinaware, shaving gear, electrical appliances, musical instruments, typewriters, slide projectors, gramophones, sewing machines, trophies, and a large collection of glass bottles. There is a telephone exchange, workshop tools, stock bells, a wool press, a wheelchair, rocks pumps and watering cans. A number of books, photographs, medals and smaller items are housed in a glass case near the entrance. Several books are lying loose, some of general interest such as a home medical textbook, others of great relevance and value to the tramway such as an original manual for the railmotor's Gardner diesel engine. =Other buildings= There are six other buildings on the site, but not all are related to the tramway, and only two are buildings that existed on their present sites while the tramway was functioning. The locomotive shed at the very end of the line is the second or perhaps third shed in that position. This very small steel-framed corrugated iron clad building dates from the tramway's last years of operation, and was probably built in 1958 to house the first diesel locomotive. The doorway appears to have been rather crudely raised in height, suggesting that the second diesel engine may have been slightly higher. The cold store is the only other surviving building of the tramway station complex. A small building clad partly in asbestos cement sheeting and partly in corrugated iron, it was built in the 1950s and stands near the southern end of the station platform. It is still in use as a Council-owned public facility for storing refrigerated goods. Parallel to the goods shed on roughly the former alignment of the main line is an open shelter shed, consisting of a low-pitched gabled corrugated iron roof supported on tubular steel posts, enclosed with cyclone wire mesh. It houses a passenger carriage and two small motorised railcars. Near the southern end of the shelter is a small toolshed or workshop, timber-framed and clad with corrugated iron, which houses a maintenance trolley, a blacksmith's forge and other tools. The trolley sits on a short section of track which runs at right angles to the main line. Beside the shelter shed is a three-sided hut of corrugated iron on a bush timber frame, containing a wood stove and a bedframe. At the northern end of the goods shed, and the first building encountered by visitors entering the museum, is a police lockup, measuring about seven metres by three metres in plan. It is built of timber, weatherboard clad, and consists of two cells side by side with a narrow verandah in front. It was brought to the site from the Aramac police station. =Other Structures and Relics of the Tramway= On the site of the demolished railway station, about north of the goods shed, the concrete platform runs for about alongside the alignment of the main line. The cold store stands near its southern end. At the northern end of the platform are a row of four lengths of steel rail put upright in the ground as posts. These marked the site of the taxi rank, and were to stop cars encroaching onto the pedestrian area of the passenger platform. Further north along the main line, near the locomotive shed, are the concrete foundations of the diesel fuel tank. There is no sign of the coal bins or the station master's house. The remains of the cattle yards are on a side line about east of the station platform. There are modern yards on the site, but these are completely different in their layout from the tramway yards. A cattle dip was located to the south, of which a small section of the concrete floor and an intact drain remain. A few disturbed pieces of broken-up loading ramps are still on the site. Near the cattle yards there are some timber pieces of the railway station building lying loose, including the base of a diameter post set in concrete. Thirty metres south of the goods shed and parallel with the goods line is the wool loading platform, a raised concrete-faced earth platform long, nearly identical with the platform at the station building. Midway between the goods shed and the wool platform is a steel gantry straddling the goods line. Four hundred metres south of the goods shed, the main line crosses the two channels of Aramac Creek. There are two low bridges, each about in length, built to a standard Queensland Railways trestle design. The rails have been removed, but the timber structure appears more or less intact, although not capable of supporting a load. =Rolling Stock= The Tramway Museum still has six intact rail vehicles on site, and the partial remains of two more. Pride of place in the collection is the railmotor \\"Aunt Emma\\". One passenger carriage is still attached to the engine carriage. In the open shelter shed is a timber passenger carriage which was designed to be hauled by a steam locomotive. Most of the seats had been removed when fittings for a mobile fettler's camp were installed. Two refrigerators remain. The Tramway Museum also has two Fairmont light motorised trolleys. One Fairmont is in the open shelter shed, the other in the enclosed toolshed. Also in the open shelter shed is an even smaller motorised track inspection car, barely big enough for two people. It is enclosed with a glass windscreen, and is equipped with a stretcher to act as an ambulance in emergencies. Abandoned near the end of the main line outside the locomotive shed are the remains of Engine No 1 and its tender. The tender is reasonably intact, although missing its wheels and bogies, but the locomotive consists of simply the chassis and boiler mounts, with the boiler, cylinders and driving mechanism, wheels, bogies and cabin all missing.  Heritage listing  Aramac Tramway Museum was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Aramac Tramway Museum is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, forming part of a tramway built during the rapid expansion of railways in Queensland in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Aramac Tramway was funded by the local council as a branch line of the Winton - Longreach line, and remained under the control of the Aramac Shire Council for the entire period of its operation. It was the last of such locally controlled tramways operating when it closed in 1975. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Aramac Tramway Museum demonstrates a rare and unusual aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage as an example of a railway service operated by a local community. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a special association with the Aramac community through their efforts to have the tramway constructed and maintained over a 62-year period. For many years the tramway provided an important economic and social link to Barcaldine and the Central Line running to Rockhampton. In times of flood, the road between Aramac and Barcaldine would be closed and the tramway provided the sole transport link between the towns.

Nadanghat police station serves this village. It is about 15 km away from Kalna, India. It is situated on the western bank of the BhƒÅgirathi. Etymology The word Samudragarh derives from two Bengali term Samudra (means sea in English) and Garh (means fort in English). Though there are several explanations about the origin of this name but the main explanation is that the term Samudra came from a name of a local king and as the king built his fort in this place so the word Garh came that fort itself.(Though there is no fort has been found yet). Another explanation is that the area is surrounded by water bodies in all side, so related to water, the name might have come.  Geography  =Location= Samudragarh is located on the agriculturally rich alluvial plains between the Bhagirathi, Ajay and Damodar rivers.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, p. 15, Radical Impression.

Recently, it was depicted in the Sydney Morning Herald as 'One of the most chilling but underrated Australian novels of the early 1990s' by critic Peter Pierce.Pierce, Peter, \\"Friendly Fire\\", The Sydney Morning Herald (December 14, 2005). John Hanrahan, the Australian critic and author, wrote in Australian Book Review that its sequel, Play With Knives: Two: Complicity, 'explored power, manipulation, control, violence as sexual foreplay, and yet... [is] a novel that has the strength of insight, acceptance, optimism and gentleness. This is a novel about darkness, it walks in darkness, trembles in darkness. But the images of light and of sunshine are also appropriate because they come not from Dracula special effects but from a confident awareness of the aspirations, at once grubby and soaring, of that workhorse muscle, the human heart'.Hanrahan, John. \\"Where You Go, I'll Follow\\".

(ed) An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English, p.321 also spelt 'Cackagee' or 'Cockagee' and sometimes known as the 'Irish Crab' or 'Lord Cork's Crab', is or was a variety of cider apple, known in Ireland and the West of England. History Hogg described the 'Coccagee' as \\"one of the oldest and best of cider apples\\".Hogg, R. The Apple and Its Varieties, 1859, p.57 He noted that the variety originated in Ireland, but in c. 1710 it was taken to Somerset and promoted in the area around Minehead as suitable for cider, after which it was commonly planted in the west of England. It was also known in Wales under the name afal baw gwydd (\\"goose dung apple\\").Pughe, A dictionary of the Welsh language, 1866, p.44 In Ireland it was found in many estate orchards in Clare and Limerick, and was regarded as an important part of local cider production, with barrels of single-varietal Coccagee cider fetching a high premium. Wakefield's 1812 Account of Ireland stated that \\"the celebrated cackagee apple is found near a town called Six Mile Bridge, in the County of Clare\\".Wakefield, 'An Account of Ireland, v.1, p.538 Richard Graves referred to the variety, and its harshly acidic flavour, in his poem Hymen and Pomona: \\"Some, proud of sense and ill-bred wit / Are harsh as Coccagee\\".Graves, R. Euphrosyne, 1780, p.218 By the early 19th century it was often said to be the most favoured variety for cidermaking even in England, but by the end of the century it had been supplanted by newer cultivars and was little known. Irish domestic cider production contracted after the Great Famine and subsequent emigration, and the Coccagee also became rare in its country of origin. The variety is currently thought to be lost, both in England and Ireland,Preserving our Apples, Irish Independent, 21 Sep 2010 but the Gloucestershire Orchard Trust has recently explored the suggestion that the old local variety 'Hen's Turd' may in fact be the 'Coccagee'.Varietal Research , Gloucestershire Orchard Trust, accessed 01-09-2016 Characteristics As with several other very old varieties of cider apple, such as the Styre, the 'Coccagee' was a vigorous tree that could be propagated simply by striking a cutting in the earth, and this method of propagation was common in Ireland. The fruit of the 'Coccagee' is small to medium-sized, ovate or conical, with pale yellow, green-flecked skin, the colour of which probably gave the variety its name. The flesh is yellowish white and acidic, the juice fermenting to a pale, straw coloured cider compared to Canary wine.Ellis, The Compleat Cyderman, 1754, p.83 Hogg described the apple as \\"perhaps the most harsh and austere apple known, and generally considered only fit for cider\\", but added \\"it is one of the best for all culinary purposes [...] as it possesses a particularly rich flavour when cooked\\".

She was a poet who is notable for having married Muslim men who died as martyrs. Early life She was the daughter of Zayd ibn Amr, a member of the Adi clan of the Quraysh in Mecca, and of Umm Kurz Safiya bint al-Hadrami.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al- Tabaqat al-Kabir vol. 8.

Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Aatika was probably still a child when Muhammad declared himself to be a prophet in 610. Sa'id was among the early converts, and Aatika became a Muslim too. Personal life =First marriage= Her first husband was her cousin, Zayd ibn al-Khattab, who was much older than herself. He was also a Muslim, and it was presumably in his company that Aatika joined the general emigration to Medina in 622. This marriage apparently ended in divorce, for Aatika had already remarried by the time of Zayd's death at the Battle of Yamama in December 632. =Second marriage= Married life Her second husband was Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr.Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al-Rusul wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Smith, G. R. (1994). Volume 14: The Conquest of Iran. Albany: State University of New York Press. It was said that Abdullah respected Aatika's judgment more than his own and that he spent so much time with her that he was too busy to fight in the Islamic army. Divorce Abu Bakr punished his son by ordering him to divorce her. However, Al-Baladhuri says that the reason Abu Bakr ordered the divorce was because Aatika was barren.Shuraydi, H. (2014). The Raven and the Falcon: Youth versus Old Age in Medieval Arabic Literature. Leiden: Brill. Abdullah did as he was told but was grief-stricken. He wrote poetry for her: I have never known a man like me divorce a woman like her, nor any woman like her divorced for no fault of her own. In the end Abdullah was allowed to take Aatika back before her waiting period was completed.Abbott, N. (1942). Aishah - the Beloved of Mohammed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Death of Muhammad When Muhammad died in 632, Aatika composed an elegy for him. His camels have been lonely since evening; he used to ride them and he was their adornment. I have been weeping for the Chief since evening, and tears are flowing in succession. Thy wives are still lying in swoons because of grief that grows greater moment by moment; they turned pale like a javelin that becomes useless and changes its colour; they are remedying chronic sorrow, but the pain reacts on the heart; they beat their fine faces with their palms, for that is what happens at times like this. He was excellent and the chosen Chief. Their religion was united on truth. How can I live longer than the Messenger, who died at his appointed hour?Muhammad ibn Saad.

Calcutta: The Asiatic Society. Aatika composed an elegy for him. I vow that mine eye will not cease to weep for thee and my skin will be covered with dust. She refused several suitors in the following months. =Third marriage= Courtship Umar, the future second Caliph and Aatika's first cousin, told her that she had been wrong to renounce her right to remarry, \\"denying yourself what God has permitted.\\" Ibn Sa'd tells the story of their courtship this way. > Umar said to her guardian, \\"Mention me to her.\\" He was mentioned to her and > she also rejected Umar. Umar said, \\"Marry her to me.\\" He married him to her > and Umar went to her and went in where she was and contended with her until > he overcame her and she carried out the marriage to him. When he finished, > he said, \\"Bother! Bother! Bother! I say 'Bother!' to her!\\" Then he left her > and left her alone and did not go to her. She sent a client of hers, saying > to him, \\"Come, and I will prepare for you.\\" The broken vow After Umar became Caliph,Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari. Tarikh al Rusual wa'l-Muluk. Translated by Blankinship, K. Y. (1993). Volume 11: The Challenge to the Empires. Albany: State University of New York Press. when Aisha learned that Aatika had broken her vow of celibacy, she sent her a message: I vow that mine eye will not cease to be dry for thee, and my skin will be yellow with dye. Return our property to us!\\" When Ali also recited this poem to them, Umar told Aatika to return the land. He settled an equivalent sum of money on her, which she distributed in alms to expiate the breaking of her vow to Abdullah. Married life From her marriage to Umar, Aatika gave birth to a son named Iyad. Aatika used to ask Umar's permission to attend public prayers at the mosque. He remained silent, presumably because he could not forbid something that Muhammad had permitted, and so Aatika continued to attend.Malik ibn Anas. Muwatta 14:14.Holmes Katz, M. (2013). Prayer in Islamic Thought and Practice, p. 191. New York: Cambridge University Press. Death of Umar She was present at the Mosque when Umar was assassinated there in November 644. She composed elegies for him. Eye! let thy tears and weeping be abundant and weary not - over the noble chief. Death hath afflicted me in the fall of a horseman Distinguished in the day of battle ... Compassionate to those closest, tough against his enemies, someone to trust in times of bad fortune and answering, whenever he gave his word, his deeds did not belie his word, swift to good deeds, and not with a frown. =Fourth marriage= Courtship After Umar's death, Aatika married Zubayr ibn al-Awam. She made it a condition of their marriage contract that he would not beat her, that he would continue to permit her to visit the mosque at will and that he would not withhold \\"any of her rights\\". Married life Zubayr regretted permitting her to attend public prayers and tried to discourage her. She retorted: \\"Are you so jealous that you want me to forsake a place where I have prayed with the Prophet, Abu Bakr and Umar?\\" Since he did not dare forbid her outright to attend, he found an indirect way to deter her. He lay in wait for her and pull her clothes or clock when she was on her way to night prayers in the dark. (An alternative tradition says that Zubayr instructed another man to deliver such occurrence.) She exclaimed: \\"Why? May God cut off your hand!\\" Later, when Zubayr asked why she had not attended prayers that night, she complained, \\"People have become bad.\\" (In one version of this tradition, Zubayr confessed that he had been the man who does that .) She decided then forth to pray at home. Death of Zubayr Zubayr was killed at the Battle of the Camel in December 656. Aatika also composed an elegy for him. If he could have been awakened, he would have been found not shaking with a quivering heart or hand. You will be lucky to find anyone like him among those who remain, who come and go ... If you have killed a Muslim, then you must suffer the penalty for murder.Sallabi, A. H. (2010). Biography of Ali Ibn Abi-Talib: A Comprehensive Study of His Personality and Era, volume 2, p. 88. Riyadh: Darussalam. It was at this point that people began to say: \\"Let a man who wants to be a shahid marry Aatika bint Zayd!\\" Ali himself proposed to her, but she told him, \\"I would not want you to die, O cousin of the Prophet.\\" =Fifth marriage= Aatika's fifth husband was Ali's own son, Husayn, who must have been some twenty years younger than herself. He was also reckoned a shahid because he was killed at the Battle of Karbala in October 680; however, Aatika apparently predeceased him. Death Aatika died in 672.

Prior to becoming CEO, Xue was the UCCA Store retail director. In 2015, Xue was named one of the 7 Women in Contemporary Chinese Art You Need to Know by ArtNet News.  Biography  Xue was born in Xian, China. In 1985, at the age of 15, Xue moved to Shandong where she would finish her schooling all the way through university where she would earn a bachelor's degree in Hotel Management at Shandong University. In 1994, Xue was introduced to an opportunity in Beijing, China, to work as an assistant for Pittler Group China's chief representative. Xue quickly built a good reputation within the company and was sent to the Goethe Institut in Beijing to study German. After completing two semesters at the Goethe Institut, she continued to work for Pittler Group China. In 1998, Xue joined CapitalClub China where she was hired as a membership officer. It only took Xue six months to be promoted to membership manager for China. Two years after her first promotion, Xue was once again promoted; this time to Capital Club's director of China. In 2002, Xue was awarded a chance to travel to any city in the world through Capital Club and chose Los Angeles, California. The director of ClubCorp (Capital Club's parent company) in Los Angeles immediately offered Xue a position. Xue spent three years working as a private events manager for City Club on Bunker Hill in Los Angeles before moving back to China in 2005. Xue continued to work at Capital Club in Beijing, this time as a marketing director, until late 2005 where she took on a position in Chengdu, China, at the China Club (private business club) as a general manager. In 2006, Xue was hired by Cartier to become the area retail manager of North China. Xue spent one-year at Cartier before starting her own public relations company called Imperial Connect. The company last just under two years (2007-2009). During those two years, Imperial Connect partnered with Jet Set Sports to become a VIP host for the 2008 Beijing Olympics where Xue held the role of event manager. Imperial Connect also worked with Hainan Airlines to host the inaugural China to Seattle flight event. Most of Imperial Connect's clients were in the art industry. The Bruce Lee Gallery was one of Imperial Connect's clients. Xue, still running Imperial Connect, also worked with the Kent Logan Foundation, Lawrence Schiller, Chinese Contemporary Art Awards (CCAA) and Uli Sigg. This prompted Xue's entry into the art industry. In November 2008, shortly after Xue finished the CCAAs at UCCA, she was offered job by founder Guy Ullens who brought her on as UCCA Store retail director. In 2011, Xue was promoted to CEO of UCCA. In 2017, Xue announced her resignation.

Welch Jr., State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo (UB) Professor of Political Science and SUNY Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science, was born on 12 June 1939 in Boston, Massachusetts, to Dr. Claude E. Welch, Sr., and Phyllis Paton Welch. The younger Welch ‚Äúhad the values of hard work and respect for others instilled him from an early age.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 His father worked his way through Harvard Medical School and served as a front-line surgeon in World War II. In his medical career, he became ‚Äúa fixture at Massachusetts General Hospital for more than 40 years, was an innovative surgeon, a tireless worker, prolific researcher and an advocate of building strong ties with his patients, themes that would come to be synonymous with his‚Ä¶son.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 Welch had four children with his late wife Nancy, who died in 1979. His son is Chris Welch, and his three daughters are Sarah Welch, Martha Dyer, and the late Elisabeth Ann (Lisa) Welch, who died in an alpine accident in September 2017. The Welch family maintains a camp on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire, where Welch moved in 2020. In 1981, Welch married Jeannette Marie Ludwig (September 29, 1949-July 29, 2018), who was also a professor at UB. Welch and Ludwig divided their time between their homes in Amherst and the Chautauqua Institute. They donated their home to the Chautauqua Foundation and are members of the Eleanor B. Daugherty Society. Welch's scope of interest extends globally. He and Ludwig traveled to more than 25 countries on five continents. They became avid photographers, and their collection of more than 2000 images, complete with detailed descriptions, is preserved in the digital collection of the University at Buffalo Libraries. Based on these images, the library maintains an exhibition titled Wayfarers: Selected Images from the Welch-Ludwig Collection. Welch and Ludwig also created a scholarship for students studying abroad, the Welsh- Ludwig Fund for International Study. Education Welch attended private schools from fifth grade on. He went to Belmont Hill School, Belmont, Massachusetts, where he received academic awards for Biology, French, Latin, and general scholarly excellence. In his senior year, Welch received the Headmaster's Award for Outstanding Student and graduated summa cum laude. Welch was admitted to Harvard College, the undergraduate liberal arts college of Harvard University, graduating magna cum laude. Responding to the political upheaval in Africa where countries were fighting for independence, Welch focused his studies on Africa and human rights. His undergraduate honors thesis examined the impact of international law on South Africa‚Äôs administration of South-West Africa (now Namibia) from the end of World War I to 1961. Continuing with postgraduate studies at Oxford University, Welch earned his PhD in 1964. In an interview with UB Honors Today, UB‚Äôs honors alumnae magazine, he explained that he did his dissertation research in West Africa, wrote the final draft on location, and mailed it to his committee.SUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 His interest in African politics and human rights formed the basis for his career. Teaching career For more than 50 years, Welch taught political science at UB and lived in Amherst, New York, a suburb of Buffalo, New York. 1964, Welch accepted a position in the political science department at the University at Buffalo, the largest and most comprehensive campus within the SUNY system. He rose rapidly in the academic ranks, serving as assistant professor from 1964‚Äì68, associate professor from 1968‚Äì72, full professor from 1972‚Äì89, and as SUNY Distinguished Service Professor until his retirement in 2017. He was selected one of nine faculty members from the SUNY system to serve on the University-wide Advisory Council on Distinguished Service Professorships, 2009‚Äì12. His international teaching included a semester at the Singapore Institute of Management and part of a summer course at the International Institute of Human Rights, Strasbourg, France. Welch became a mentor and renowned professor and took an active role in graduate as well as undergraduate education. His warm and enthusiastic personality and his intellect created an environment in which students explored the issues of the day, and his involvement in university activities demonstrated his devotion and attention to his students and their regard for him. In 2016 Welch received the President‚Äôs Medal at the University at Buffalo, given ‚Äúin recognition of signal and extraordinary service to UB.‚Äù The citation praised his ‚Äúmajor contributions to the development of, or quality of life within, the University.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo. UB Now. September 7, 2017 Welch's teaching responsibilities included African politics, civil-military relations, human rights, international law, political change, and world civilizations since 1500. He directed independent study and thesis and dissertation guidance. Since 1969, he participated in about 60 dissertation committees, chairing more than 30 of them, and he served as an outside reader for other departments at UB as well as other universities, for example, in Canada and South Africa. In addition, Welch taught at the Global Perspectives Academy and presented special seminars for the University Honors Program: Africa through Novels and Films, International Human Rights, and Women's and Men's Language (with Jeannette Ludwig). Welch took special pride in teaching. In 2015, he told UB Honors Today that his teaching philosophy is ‚ÄúLet each become what they are capable of being. I try to build up a sense that, yes, individuals have made a difference, and you can do so, too. One of the objectives I see in my teaching is empowerment of students through knowledge, but also through a sense that they can be inspired by learning about others.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch's academic interests focus broadly on political transitions, particularly in developing countries, most notably in Africa. Welch published 14 books that demonstrate his expertise in African politics, civil-military relations, and human rights.

Administrative career Welch served in numerous administrative positions while maintaining his teaching and research. His first major appointment came in 1967 when, at the age of 28, he became dean of the Division of Undergraduate Education at UB. He served in this position from 1967‚Äì70. As associate vice president for Academic Affairs in 1976‚Äì80, Welch worked as the number two person for non-health sciences-related matters. He also served a three-year term as chair of the Political Science Department, 1980‚Äì83. He was Acting Dean of the Colleges from 1978‚Äì79; co director of the annual Faculty Development Workshop, l984‚Äì91; and co director of the Program for Tenured Faculty, 1987‚Äì89. The Faculty Senate elected Welch chair for 1985‚Äì87 and 1995‚Äì97. He also served UB by chairing Faculty Senate committees on Budget Priorities, Governance, Academic Planning, Public Service, Student Affairs, and Teaching Effectiveness. In addition, Welch chaired the Committee on Public Service, the Nominating Committee, the Committee on Student Affairs, and the Special Committee on Academic Integrity. At the Baldy Center for Law & Social Policy (SUNY Buffalo Law School), he was a member of Advisory Committee, the Gilbert Moore Fellowships Committee, and the Working Groups Committee. Welch chaired the Council on International Studies and World Affairs from 1998‚Äì2000, has been a member since 1966, and served on the Task Force on International Programs, 1981‚Äì83. He chaired the President's Review Board on Appointments, Promotions, and Tenure for three years and served three-year terms on two other occasions. From 2009 to 2011, Welch sat on UB's General Education Task Force and was appointed by the provost as a contributor to the new implementation and development of the restructuring of the university's general education requirements. In 2008, UB President John B. Simpson appointed Welch to the Campaign Advisory Group as one of three faculty members on a 15-person team to help improve fundraising efforts. He also served as the president of the Omicron Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa (1971‚Äì93) and subsequently served on the Elections Committee. Editorial and advisory activities Welch sat on several editorial committees and advised university presses. Since 1993 he has been on the editorial review board of Human Rights Quarterly. From 1980‚Äì88, he was associate editor for Armed Forces & Society, serving as editor from 1988‚Äì92 and on their board of editors from 1992 to the present. Welch was subject editor for ‚ÄúArmed Forces and Society‚Äù in the International Military and Defense Encyclopedia.Published in 1993 by Pergamon-Brassey‚Äôs Welch has served on the editorial board of advisors for several publications, including Buffalo Human Rights Law Review since 1997; advisory board, World History Since 1500 (Dushkin Publishers), 1997‚Äì2005; editorial advisory board, Encyclopedia Americana, 1992‚Äì03; and the board of editors, African Studies Review, 1974‚Äì81. He reviewed book manuscripts for Princeton University Press, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, Houghton Mifflin, SUNY Press, University of Pennsylvania Press, University of Rochester Press, University of Nebraska Press, Pennsylvania State University Press, and Kumarian Press. He evaluated article manuscripts for Armed Forces & Society, African Studies Review, Journal of Developing Areas, and Journal of Modern African Studies and grant proposals for the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science Foundation, the United States Institute of Peace, and the Fulbright program. He also was Fellowship evaluator for the Fulbright Commission Council on International Education Services. In addition, Welch was promotion evaluator for University of Virginia; Johns Hopkins University; University of California, Riverside; University of Southern California; University of Vermont; Dartmouth College; Southern Illinois University; Miami University of Ohio; University of South Carolina; and the University of Zambia, among others. He was on the academic advisory committee for graduate programs at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 1999‚Äì2004. Impact In his 50-plus years teaching at UB, Professor Welch impacted both campus life and individual students. About his early years teaching, Welch told UB Honors Today, ‚ÄúI started out really scared teaching. I remember being dressed formally‚Äîbecause that was the way in 1964‚Äîand I‚Äôd come back with chalk dust on my shoulders from rubbing up against the board. I was sort of backing away.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 However, he quickly adjusted to the environment of university life and ‚Äúas he began teaching honors seminars in the late 1980s, he realized he could utilize some of the principles of those smaller classes‚Äîsuch as debate and classroom discussion‚Äîand apply them to what had typically been larger, lecture-based classes.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch continues, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs contemporary learning. That‚Äôs how advances occur. It‚Äôs not now the image of the lone scholar locked in a garret somewhere. Yes, you can have brilliant thought experiments. You can be like Einstein in the patent office, totally bored and a failure in math in high school. But for the overwhelming bulk of us that are a couple of standard deviations below in terms of intelligence, you‚Äôve got to work collaboratively.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 10 Welch's interests took him far beyond the campus and classroom. He believes in living a life of integrity. He told UB Honors Today, ‚ÄúI try to be a role model for how to live. Have a relationship that is stable and loving. Be part of a community and help to make it a better community. Be generous with time and treasure. These are clich√©s, but you have to live them.‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 The article published in UB Honors Today describes the influence Welch had on his students, prompting many of them to pursue graduate degrees in political science. ‚ÄúHalfway around the world, you‚Äôll find former Welch-inspired scholars‚Ä¶ Jori Breslawski (Honors Scholar, Class of 2014) was already an international studies major‚Ä¶but her specialization changed after taking Welch‚Äôs Human Rights course. ‚ÄòThat was one of the pivotal moments in my life.‚Ä¶ It completely changed how I saw the world. He taught in such a way that you couldn‚Äôt ignore what he was talking about. I would leave class crying and wouldn‚Äôt be able to get it out of my mind the rest of the day.‚Äô‚ÄùSUNY at Buffalo, Honors Today, Fall 2015, p. 9 Welch's major academic impact came through his analyses of the effectiveness of human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), explored in his 2001 publication, NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance.Welch, Claude E. Jr., ed. (2000). NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press He argued, particularly in his 2001 book Protecting Human Rights in Africa, that NGOs have become central to the promotion and protection of human rights. His recent research involves the effectiveness of human rights NGOs; he demonstrates that in key parts of civil society, NGOs have become central to the promotion and protection of human rights. His last major volume on this topic, tentatively titled Protecting Human Rights Globally: Strategies and Roles of International NGOs, remains unfinished as of this writing. It examines the impact of lesser known international nongovernmental organizations (INGO) such as Anti-Slavery International, the World Council of Churches, a variety of entities concerned with discrimination on the basis of descent (in particular, caste) and the Coalition for the International Criminal Court. These INGOs focus on major on-going human rights issues, notably contemporary slavery, racism, discrimination based on descent, and impunity from prosecution for major human rights abuses. Initial drafts of three chapters had been published in Human Rights Quarterly as of summer 2017. Overseas travel, research, and appointments Given his specialization in comparative politics, Welch carried out much of his research outside the United States. He traveled as well to enhance his teaching, learn about cultures, and satisfy his curiosity. Countries he visited include Brazil, Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Gambia, Ghana, Germany, Great Britain, Kenya, Lesotho, Namibia, Nigeria, Norway, People's Republic of China, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Togo, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe. Welch's main geographic interest remained with Africa. One of his early appointments was chairman of the UNESCO Evaluation Commission, Alan Ikoku College of Education in Owerri, Nigeria, in January 1977. Later, Welch sat on the Advisory Committee for the African Centre for Democracy and Human Rights Studies, Banjul, Gambia, from 1993‚Äì2005 and the Advisory Committee for the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch from 1989‚Äì2009. He attended seminars organized by the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, held in Burundi, Benin, and Botswana. These seminars focused on improving democratization efforts in Africa, particularly relating to armed forces. Scholarly contributions Welch's 14 books and many published articles address three interdisciplinary areas: Africa, the political roles of armed forces (civil‚Äìmilitary relations), and human rights. Among his most important volumes, already mentioned, are Human Rights and Development in Africa, Protecting Human Rights in Africa, and Economic Rights in Canada and the United States. Although the three areas interrelate, Welch's titles can be listed among his three focus areas. In the interest of avoiding duplication, several volumes that overlap are mentioned only in the area most prevalent. =Books focused partly or wholly on Africa= Welch's first book, Dream of Unity: Pan-Africanism and Political Unification in West Africa,Welch, Claude E., Jr. 1966. Dream of Unity: Pan-Africanism and Political Unification in West Africa. Ithaca: Cornell University Press (1966) drew from his doctoral dissertation. It documented, through four case studies, the obstacles to greater unity among African countries with divergent colonial backgrounds. Henry L. Bretton from the University of Michigan reviewed the book in 1967, praising Welch for his focus on West Africa instead of the broader emphasis of Africa as a whole that many books of the time were concerned with. ‚ÄúProfessor Welch‚Äôs meticulous scholarship, applied to West Africa only, has produced the kind of book required for better understanding of the substance of international relations.‚ÄùMidwest Journal of Political Science 11(2), May 1967 Welch's Soldier and State in AfricaWelch, Claude E., Jr. 1970. Soldier and State in Africa: A Comparative Analysis of Military Intervention and Political Change. Evanston IL: Northwestern University Press (1970) was one of the first comparative analyses of causes of coup d‚Äô√©tat in Africa. It included Welch's framework, followed by original chapters from other specialists. Welch also drew upon his African expertise in Peasants in Africa,Welch, Claude E., Jr. and Smith, Alan K., eds. 1978. Waltham MA: Crossroads Press. The essays were also published as a special issue of African Studies Review 20(3). co-edited with Alan K. Smith.

Albany: State University of New York at Buffalo (1984) co-edited with Ronald Meltzer, examined the emergent ‚ÄúRight to Development.‚Äù As mentioned above, it was selected by Choice, as one of the Outstanding Academic Books of 1984. =Books focused on civil-military relations= Welch co-wrote Military Role and RuleWelch, Claude E. Jr. and Smith, Arthur K. 1974. Military Role and Rule. North Scituate, MA: Duxbury Press (1974) with Arthur K. Smith. The book developed a general framework of explanation for coups d‚Äô√©tat and their consequences. The authors prepared detailed studies of Thailand, Nigeria, Peru, Egypt, and France. In a review published in the Journal of Politics, Mary B. Welfing wrote, ‚ÄúWelch and Smith synthesize the extensive literature on the military in politics.‚ÄùWelding, Mary B.

Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin AmericaWelch, Claude E., Jr. 1987. No Farewell to Arms? Military Disengagement from Politics in Africa and Latin America. Boulder, CO: Westview Press (1987). This volume examines problems of ensuring effective returns to the barracks of armed forces following coups d‚Äô√©tat in three West African countries (Ghana, Nigeria, and C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire) and three Andean states (Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru).

In Developmental Change: An Annotated Bibliography,Spitz, Allan A. 1969. Developmental Change: An Annotated Bibliography. Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky Allan A. Spitz draws three conclusions from Welch's thesis: ‚Äú(1) modernization is complex and results in a fundamental transformation of society, economy, and polity; (2) modernization is not guaranteed‚Äîit is subject to disruption; and (3) it cannot be assumed that the wide-ranging changes will occur peacefully‚Äù (p. 141). =Books focused on human rights= Welch's best-known work, Protecting Human Rights in Africa, was pioneering and the first comparative analysis of the development and impact of grassroots human rights organizations south of the Sahara. It was selected by Choice as one of the outstanding academic books of 1995 and short listed that year by the African Studies Association for the Herskovits Prize for the best book in African studies. Protecting Human Rights in Africa received outstanding reviews due to its revolutionary nature. Foreign Affairs quoted it as ‚Äúa wise, nuanced, and copiously referenced study for practitioners and donors as well as academic analysts‚ÄùForeign Affairs. March/April 1997 and the Journal of Southern African Studies described it as ‚Äúone of the best books of its kind.‚ÄùDe Waal, A. 1996. Journal of Southern African Studies, 22(3), 500‚Äì01 In NGOs and Human Rights: Promise and Performance (2001), Welch commissioned five original chapters to use as case studies to form a framework that compares and contrasts ways in which non- governmental human rights organizations have developed their goals, determined their effectiveness, and adopted and adapted their strategies. The volume addresses how these factors influence NGOs‚Äô effectiveness. Among the organizations examined are Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists, the Ford Foundation, and development- oriented NGOs. Asian Perspectives on Human RightsBoulder CO: Westview Press, 19 (1990), co-edited with Virginia Leary, combined original case studies of individual Asian countries with a synthesizing introduction. The volume contains original papers presented at conferences that were organized by Welch and Leary. Economic Rights in Canada and the United States examined similarities and contrasts between the two countries in areas such as the right to health care, social welfare and racism, disability rights, and others. This volume was based on original papers commissioned by Professors Hassmann and Welch with funding from various sources. =Other publications= In addition to the volumes above, Welch contributed 39 chapters to scholarly books; 41 articles for refereed journals and 27 articles for non-refereed journals; nine encyclopedia entries; six monographs and consultant's reports; 20 unpublished conference presentations; and nine invited and professional addresses. He won 32 research, symposium, and internship grants and six university research grants. In addition, Welch reviewed grant applications for the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the Grawemeyer Foundation, and the United States Institute of Peace. Community activities Through his career, Welch has supported community life in Western New York, becoming a well-known civic figure and supporter of human rights causes. He served as president of the Buffalo Council on World Affairs from 1997 to 1999 and helped to establish Buffalo- Niagara World Connect. He served on the board of directors for the Harvard Club of Western New York (1998‚Äì2001) and the African American Cultural Center of Buffalo. Welch also belonged to the Pundit Club of Buffalo, a men's literary and social group. Welch's participation in the Buffalo religious community has given him recognition in more than just the academic circles in the city. At Westminster Presbyterian Church, Welch has served as a Ruling Elder, chairman of the Management Group, chair of the Adult Program Committee, and chair of the Investment Policy Committee. He also participated in the Amherst Community Church, serving on the Board of Directors, Board of Trustees, and the Music Committee. In 1972, he served as a reporter on religion and ethics for WBEN-TV (now WIVB-TV) as part of his volunteer work for the Buffalo Council of Churches. In 2000, he received the first Claude E.

In 2016 Breedon became the UK's largest independent construction materials firm following its acquisition of Hope Construction Materials and in 2018 extended its operations into Ireland with the acquisition of Lagan Group. Breedon has nearly 3000 employees and operates from around 300 sites. The business turned over ¬£862m in the year to December 2018, with a market capitalisation of more than ¬£1bn. Breedon Group produces cement, construction aggregates, asphalt, ready-mixed concrete, bitumen and other construction materials. It also has a sizeable contract surfacing and highway maintenance business. The company was founded in 2008 by Peter Tom, chairman of the Leicester Tigers rugby club, and Simon Vivian. The current chairman is Amit Bhatia, son-in-law of Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire steel magnate who became a Breedon shareholder following the Hope acquisition. History Breedon's HQ is located in the village and parish of Breedon on the Hill, where stone has been quarried since the late 1800s. In 2000, Breedon and its Breedon Hill and Cloud Hill quarries were acquired by Ennstone, a Midlands-based aggregates group. The Ennstone businesses were acquired by Breedon Aggregates Limited in 2010. These acquisitions took place under Breedon's former executive chairman, Peter Tom, and then CEO Simon Vivian, who stepped down in 2015. Their strategy was to grow the company via the acquisition of small, often family-owned operations, in an industry generally regarded as having high barriers to entry. In 2016 the company was renamed Breedon Group after completing its ¬£336m acquisition of Hope Construction Materials, its largest purchase to date. In January 2020, Breedon agreed a ¬£178m deal with Cemex to take over 49 ready-mix plants, 28 aggregate quarries, four depots, one cement terminal, 14 asphalt plants and four concrete products operations. However, the deal was suspended pending a regulatory investigation ordered by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority. Operations Breedon Group operates as five autonomous businesses: Breedon Southern, Breedon Northern, Whitemountain (NI), Lagan (RoI) and Breedon Cement. Breedon Southern, Breedon Northern, Whitemountain and Lagan are vertically integrated aggregates businesses, operating quarries, ready-mixed concrete and asphalt plants, contract surfacing & highway maintenance operations. Breedon Cement produces cement at two plants at Hope in Derbyshire and Kinnegad in the Republic of Ireland, and also imports/exports cementitious materials through three UK terminals. The firm has the reported capacity to produce around 2 million tonnes of cement each year. Breedon Cement operates four rail-linked depots, including a major facility in Dagenham, Essex, which produces bagged cement. The group is reported to hold a total of approximately 900 million tonnes of natural mineral reserves and resources. Breedon Group owns a 37.5% stake in BEAR Scotland, which maintains roads on behalf of Transport Scotland, and a majority stake in Alba Traffic Management, an Inverness-based firm that provides traffic management services for highway works, events and utilities. Through Mobile Concrete Solutions (MCS), Breedon also operates an on-site concrete batching service, run as a joint venture with construction services company TSL.https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/scotland- business/981022/breedon-aims-benefit-fro-economic-uncertainty/ Products Breedon produces a variety of grades of bulk and packed cement, in addition to crushed rock, sand, gravel, agricultural lime and a range of specialist ready- mixed concretes and asphalts. One of its best-known products is Golden Amber Gravel, used for pathways and driveways; it is reportedly the only gravel with a Royal Warrant. Golden Amber is used at Chatsworth House, The National War Memorial Arboretum and the Sandringham Estate. Other products include speedway shale, which is a mix of crushed limestone and clay laid down to form the competitive surface at motorcycle speedway tracks. Breedon shale is used in international speedway tracks such as Cardiff, Gothenburg and Copenhagen. Breedon developed its shale product alongside former speedway World Champion Ole Olsen and his son Torben. Recent acquisitions In February 2016 the UK Government's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it would investigate the proposed acquisition of Hope Construction Materials by Breedon, citing a possible lessening of competition in the building materials industry. The subsequent investigation held that the acquisition would not unduly reduce competition for the production and supply of aggregates, but that there should be further investigation into the supply of ready-mixed concrete. In response to the CMA, Breedon offered to sell 14 concrete plants from a list of 27 sites that the CMA believed would have reduced competition. The CMA accepted Breedon's list of divestments and permitted the acquisition. Plants divested included sites at Cloddach, Moray and Inverness. The ¬£336m cash-and-shares acquisition of Hope closed in August 2016. In November 2016 Breedon acquired the Sherburn Minerals Group for a total consideration of up to ¬£15.7 million. Sherburn is a leading independent heavyside building materials business headquartered in County Durham, employing approximately 110 people. It operates four quarries and five ready-mixed concrete plants in County Durham, Northumberland, North Yorkshire and Cumbria. It also distributes cementitious products from two import terminals at Blyth near Newcastle and Dundee in eastern Scotland. In May 2017 the group acquired Pro Mini Mix, a specialist concrete ‚Äòmini mix‚Äô supplier based at Oldbury and operating throughout the Midlands. This was followed in August 2017 by the acquisition of Humberside Aggregates, an independent sand & gravel quarry and aggregates merchanting business based at North Cave near Hull in East Yorkshire, for a total consideration of ¬£9.0 million. Humberside's clients include ready-mixed concrete and mortar producers, various Government agencies, local authorities, and local and national building and civil engineering contractors. In December 2017 Breedon announced its planned acquisition from Tarmac of four quarries and an asphalt plant for ¬£16.5 million, to be satisfied by the transfer to Tarmac of 27 of its readymix plants and payment of ¬£4.9m in cash. This transaction is expected to be completed at the end of June 2018. In February 2018, Breedon was reported to be in talks to acquire a majority stake in the Lagan Group, a construction business covering quarrying, cement, asphalt and contracting. In April 2018, it was announced that Lagan Group had been sold to Breedon for ¬£455m. In June 2018 the company acquired Blinkbonny Quarry in the Scottish Borders, adding nearly 3 millon tonnes of hard rock to its reserves. In October 2019 it was announced that the company had purchased Roadway Surfacing & Civil Engineering Limited for up to ¬£13.5 million, establishing it as a fully integrated business in North Wales Financial performance For the full financial year to December 2018, Breedon generated revenues of ¬£862.7m, underlying EBIT of ¬£103.5m and an underlying EBIT margin of 12%. Breedon's stated strategy is to continue growing organically and through the acquisition of businesses in the UK heavyside construction materials market.

Pearl Petroleum produces and develops natural gas assets in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. History In April 2007, Dana Gas entered into an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) for the appraisal and development of two major gas fields in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Khor Mor and Chemchemal. In October 2007, Dana Gas assigned 50% of its interest in the contract to Crescent Petroleum. Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum began developing the fields together as the operator and have remained as such ever since. The terms of the contract grant exclusive rights to appraise, develop, market, and sell petroleum products from the substantial Khor Mor and Chemchemal gas fields, and to provide natural gas supplies to fuel two major domestic electric generation plants being built in Erbil and Chemchemal as well as for local industries and export. In February 2009, Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum transferred their participating interests to Pearl Petroleum Company Limited, a joint venture company owned equally by Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum. Later that year, OMV of Austria and MOL of Hungary, two major European energy companies, each became 10% shareholders in Pearl Petroleum. In 2015, RWE of Germany became the third member with a 10% share of the company. The project was implemented 15 months after the signature of the agreement. It involved upstream development, the construction of two liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plants and of pipeline in mountainous terrain. Gas deliveries to the Erbil power station commenced in October 2008. Pearl Petroleum's investment in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq's gas project is one of the largest private sector investments in the KRI's oil and gas sector and provides electricity supply to over five million people in northern Iraq. Multinational professional services firm, PwC estimated that the project contributed between USD 10.7 billion and USD 18.3 billion to the KRI‚Äôs GDP in 2017 through the delivery of electricity, with the fuel cost savings substitution by gas to the KRG from the project‚Äôs inception to 2017 amounting to USD 19.2 billion. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions following the transition from diesel to gas at both Erbil and Chemchemal power plants was estimated to be 29 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent up to 31 December 2017. In August 2017, the KRG awarded Pearl Petroleum investment opportunities in blocks 19 and 20, which are adjacent to the Khor Mor field. Gas sales commenced in late 2018. In 2019, Pearl Petroleum signed a 20-year gas sales agreement with the KRG to enable production and sales of an additional at standard conditions by 2021 to further support local electricity generation. The USD 700 million expansion, currently underway at the Khor Mor plant, is to include two production trains in addition to the drilling of new wells to raise gas production to by the end of 2023. The consortium has appointed an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor to deliver the first of the two production trains at the Khor Mor plant. The first phase will increase production output by 60 percent to by Q1 2022 while the second phase of the expansion will eventually bring total production to . Operations Pearl Petroleum gas fields in Iraq Pearl Petroleum is one of the largest private investors in the oil and gas sector of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), having invested around USD 1.76 billion from inception to December 2019. It supplies the fuel to generate electricity to the major cities of the KRI. In the first stage of the commissioning of the Khor Mor field, Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas recommissioned existing gas wells, built gas separation and treatment facilities, and constructed of pipeline across mountainous terrain. Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas commenced gas deliveries to the Erbil power plant in October 2008. In the second stage of the project commissioning, completed in 2011, Pearl Petroleum installed a two- train liquid petroleum gas (LPG) plant with current gas production capacity of at standard conditions. In 2018, Pearl Petroleum completed a plant de- bottlenecking project to increase gas output by 30%. It currently produces 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day in the KRI. The daily production includes 430 million cubic feet of gas per day (12.15 MSm¬≥/d) and 15,500 barrels of condensate, with an LPG capacity of over 1,000 tonnes per day. Pearl Petroleum‚Äôs total cumulative production from 2008 to December 2019 was more than 294 million boe, including 1,198 billion cubic feet (30 billion cubic metres) of gas, 49.2 million barrels of condensate and 1.99 million tonnes of LPG. An impact assessment report authored by PwC estimated that the migration from diesel-powered electricity generation to cheaper, cleaner- burning natural gas has enabled the KRG to avoid more than 29 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent from 2008 to 2017. Moreover, as gas is more affordable than diesel, the migration to gas was estimated to have helped the KRG save USD 19.2 billion during this period. Social performance Crescent Petroleum and Dana Gas have implemented a social performance (SP) programme to support the local communities, including the provision of school supplies, drinking water treatment, mobile medical units, youth sports facilities, and generators and fuel enabling 24-hour electricity for local villages. These initiatives aim to assist the local communities to improve their standard of living, health, well-being, security and stability, and the development of human capital in the Kurdistan Region.

The park is to the south of the BR-319 highway. It is in the M√©dio Madeira microregion of Amazonas. The park is in the Purus - Madeira inter-fluvial region, in the basins of the Matupiri and Amap√° rivers. The Matupiri river runs through the centre of the park from southwest to northeast, and provides the main way to access the interior of the park. To the southeast it adjoins the Rio Madeira Sustainable Development Reserve. To the south it adjoins the PAE Jenipapo settlement. To the southwest it is bounded by the AM-464 highway, and borders the Rio Amap√° Sustainable Development Reserve.

No further deforestation was observed from then until 2010. Two possibly new species of fish have been identified and three possibly new species of herpetofauna. There are six species of birds endemic to the Purus-Madeira inter-fluvial. There are healthy populations of species that are extensively hunted such as South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), brocket deer (Mazama species) and gray woolly monkey (Lagothrix cana). History Matupiri State Park was created by Amazonas state decree 28424 of 27 March 2009. The park was created with participation of the Mura, who occupy the Cunh√£-Sapucaia Indigenous Territory adjacent to the east of the park, with an innovative model of sharing management of the park with the indigenous people. A zone of special indigenous use was defined in the management plan. The management plan was approved on 22 July 2014. As of 2016 the park was supported by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. Indigenous special use zone The Mura people occupy the Cunh√£-Sapucaia Indigenous Territory lower down along the Matupiri River, the primary route for accessing the park. The 2006 study of the creation of the Matupiri Igap√≥- A√ßu Mosaic of Conservation Areas did not account for these people, who were noted only for \\"invading\\" fishing lakes in the Igap√≥-Acu Sustainable Development Reserve. The Mura claimed they should be recognised as historical protectors of the Matupiri river basin and users of its natural resources. When monitoring of the park began in 2011 traces of Mura presence were indeed found, including house structures, wood work areas and capoeira vegetation in early succession stages. The Mura have traditionally used the park as a source of wood for their homes and boats, and of Brazil nuts, lianas, copaiba and andiroba oils, a√ßa√≠, buriti, bacaba, patau√° and honey. They have also used it for fishing, and have acted as guides for sports fishing tourists. Creation of the park has caused a drop by almost 50% of tourism revenue. There was no legal precedent in Brazil for allowing indigenous people to use the resources of a state park, but Colombia and Peru had defined relevant principles. To avoid ongoing conflicts and to recognise the conservation role of the Mura people, the management plan recognised the Indigenous Special Use Zone (ZUEI) in the park, basically consisting of land along the major rivers and streams upstream from the indigenous territory.

Description and history Monkton Town Hall is located in the center of the village of Monkton Ridge in northern Monkton, on the west side of Monkton Ridge Road near its junction with State Prison Hollow Road. It is a single story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and rubblestone foundation. Its corners have pilasters, which rise to entablatures extending along the building sides. The main facade is relatively simple, with a central entrance flanked by sash windows, and a triangular panel in the gable above. The entrance is flanked by pilasters, and has an entablature with slightly gabled pediment above. The flanking windows have simpler surrounds, similarly gabled pediments. The interior consists of a single large chamber with a raised platform at the rear, with beaded wainscoting and plaster walls. Heavy chamfered posts near the front were originally used to support the building's cupola, which was blown off in a 20th-century hurricane. with The hall was built by the town in 1859, after its previous town hall (located in the village of Monkton Boro) was judged too small to house town meetings. It is the town's main example of 19th-century civic architecture, and is presently used to house town offices.

The census was completed and published in the online journal PeerJ on 31 August 2016 at a cost of US$7 million. History Scientists believe that prior to European colonization there were as many as 20 million African elephants. By 1979, only 1.3 million elephants remained on the continent. A pan-African elephant census has not been conducted since the 1970s. The idea of a modern census was devised by Elephants Without Borders and supported, both financially and logistically, by Paul G. Allen. It was also supported by other organizations and individuals, including African Parks, Frankfurt Zoological Society, Wildlife Conservation Society, The Nature Conservancy, IUCN African Elephant Specialist Group, Howard Frederick, Mike Norton-Griffith, Kevin Dunham, Chris Touless, and Curtice Griffin with the report released in September 2016. Mike Chase, the founder of Elephants Without Borders, was the lead scientist of the census. Chase lead a group of 90 scientists and 286 crew in 18 African countries for over two years to collect the data. During this time the team flew a distance of over , equivalent to flying to the moon and a quarter of the way back, in over 10,000 hours of collecting data. The area covered represents 93% of the elephants known range. Forest Elephants which live in central and western Africa were excluded from the survey. Report Elephant skull with removed tusks, killed By poachers, Voi area, Kenya The final report was released on 31 August 2016 in Honolulu at the IUCN World Conservation Congress. Data collected showed a 30 percent decline in the population of African savanna elephant in 15 of the 18 countries surveyed. The reduction occurred between 2007 and 2014, representing a loss of approximately 144,000 elephants. The total population of Africa's savannah elephants is 352,271, far lower than previously estimated. Three countries with significant elephant population were not surveyed; Namibia which would not release figures and both South Sudan and the Central African Republic where the survey was postponed as a result of armed conflict. The rate of decline in the population is also accelerating and reached 8% in 2014. The loss of population is primarily a result of poaching with the elephants being killed for their tusks. The ivory is then illegally sold in China and the United States. It is estimated approximately 100 elephants are killed every day for ivory. Loss of habitat is another reason for the drastic reduction in population. 84% of the population was sighted in legally protected areas, and high numbers of carcasses also being found in the same protected areas.

Others preferred to live in York Township, on the outskirts of the city. By 1850, there were more than a dozen Black businesses along King Street; the modern-day equivalent is Little Jamaica along Eglinton Avenue, which contains one of the largest concentrations of Black businesses in Canada.\\"Little Jamaica Competition is stiff in the shopping area that has sprung up along Eglinton Ave. to cater to the tastes of a growing West Indian community.\\" Ashante Infantry. Toronto Star. 7 August 1995. pg. C.1 Several neighbourhoods in Toronto, including Jane and Finch, Rexdale, Malvern, Weston, St. James Town, and Lawrence Heights, are popularly associated with Black Canadians, although all are much more racially diverse than is commonly believed. The Toronto suburbs of Brampton and Ajax also have sizable Black populations, which have migrated outward from Toronto over the past decade. (Ajax has the highest percentage of Blacks of any municipality of 5,000 or more in Canada, with 16%.) The Greater Toronto Area is home to a highly educated middle to upper middle class Black population who continue to migrate out of the city limits, into surrounding suburbs. There are large variations in the income and poverty levels of different Black sub- groups in the Toronto area. In 2000, among Blacks in the Toronto area, Barbadians had the highest median income at $31,800, while Somalis had the lowest median income at $13,400. At this time, the incidence for low-income among Barbadian families was 10.4%, while it was 72.2% for Somali families. The median income for all Torontonians, regardless of ethnicity, was $29,800 with 13.9% of families considered low-income. Culture Media representation of Blacks in Canada has increased significantly in recent years, with television series such as Drop the Beat, Lord Have Mercy! and Da Kink in My Hair focusing principally on Black characters and communities. The films of Clement Virgo, Sudz Sutherland and Charles Officer have been among the most prominent depictions of Black Canadians on the big screen. Notable films have included Sutherland's Love, Sex and Eating the Bones, Officer's Nurse.Fighter.Boy and Virgo's Rude and Love Come Down. In literature, the most prominent and famous Toronto-based Black Canadian writers have been George Elliott Clarke, Lawrence Hill and Dionne Brand, although numerous emerging writers have gained attention in the 1990s and 2000s. Since the late 19th century, Black Canadians have made significant contributions to the culture of sports. In North America's four major professional sports leagues, several Black Canadians from the Toronto area have had successful careers, including Jamaal Magloire, Andrew Wiggins, P. K. Subban, and RJ Barrett. In athletics, Ben Johnson and Donovan Bailey were the Toronto area's most prominent Black sprinters in recent decades; the current generation is led by Andre De Grasse. The largest and most famous cultural event is the Peeks Toronto Caribbean Carnival (also known as Caribana), an annual festival of Caribbean Canadian culture which typically attracts at least a million participants each year.party that grew into Caribbean Carnival celebrates 50th anniversary\\". Toronto Star, 11 July 2017. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent. Black Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, Canadian Afrobeat, R&B;, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Some Black Canadian musicians have enjoyed mainstream worldwide appeal in various genres, such as Dan Hill, Glenn Lewis, Tamia, Deborah Cox, Melanie Fiona, Kardinal Offishall, Drake, The Weeknd and Tory Lanez. While African American culture is a significant influence on its Canadian counterpart, many African and Caribbean Canadians reject the suggestion that their own culture is not distinctive.Rinaldo Walcott, Black Like Who?: Writing Black Canada. 2003, Insomniac Press. . In his first major hit single \\"BaKardi Slang\\", rapper Kardinal Offishall performed a lyric about Toronto's distinctive Black Canadian slang: Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of creating a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture. For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution. Black activism also has a presence in Toronto; the Black Action Defence Committee was founded in the city in 1988, in response to the killings of several Black men by Toronto Police officers over the previous decade.Philip Mascoll, \\"Sherona Hall, 59: Fighter for justice\\", Toronto Star, 9 January 2007James: Dudley Laws stung and inspired a generation Toronto Star.

It resulted in an Allied victory that brought an end to Houchard's campaign, and led directly to his dismissal and subsequent execution. Background Following his victory at the Battle of Hondschoote and consequent relief of Dunkirk, Houchard turned from his pursuit of the Duke of York, intending to hold off the British to the north with 20,000 men, and march with the rest of his command to the relief of Le Quesnoy, under siege from a large part of the Imperial army under the Prince of Coburg. His first aim was to capture Tournai, but first had to neutralise the threat of Prince William of Orange‚Äôs Dutch contingent, which had pulled back from Ypres to Menin. The Dutch initially planned to withdraw as far as Courtrai, but when news came through that Le Quesnoy had fallen on 11 September and they would be supported by 15,000 men of Beaulieu‚Äôs column the Prince stood at Menin. On 12 September Houchard inflicted a serious defeat on the Prince of Orange at Menin, the Dutch abandoning Courtrai and retreating towards Ghent. The Republican army had now created a dangerous salient in the Allied line, which threatened to cut communications between York to the north and the main Imperial army, still around Le Quesnoy. Hearing of the Dutch defeat, York manoeuvred to cover them, while Beaulieu withdrew to Lendelede. Houchard however, was unaware that Le Quesnoy had fallen, and continued planning to advance East, ordering the Divisions of Joseph de H√©douville and Pierre Dumesny to advance south towards Lille. Battle On the evening of the 14th, Beaulieu with 6 battalions and 6 squadrons occupied Courtrai. On the same day, York‚Äôs command reached Thorout, where, in a council of war, he determined to attack Menin. On 15 September, as York marched against Menin, H√©douville left Menin with part of his division and sent Demars‚Äô brigade of 3,000 men down the Lys river to threaten Courtrai. Demars was less than enthusiastic for this dangerous task, but was threatened with denouncement to Houchard if he disobeyed: \\"He must take Courtrai or burn it with his shells\\".Phipps Vol 1 p.241 York was en route at Rousselare (Roulers) when he heard the news, and immediately detached General Erbach, commanding his advance guard of Hanovarian infantry and British Cavalry, to assist Beaulieu's Austrians, followed by 4 more battalions. As Demars approached Courtrai, Beaulieu advanced out of the town and drove them back. H√©douville brought up reinforcements from Menin, but these too were driven back, pursued closely by the Austrians. With the bulk of H√©douville's Division en route to Lille, Demars was left outside Menin to hold the Allies off until night, but the appearance of Erbach's command placed them in full flight.Duke of York's report, quoted in Burne p.84 Daendels, commanding in Menin was able to hold out for a while, but panic set in again and Menin was abandoned, many drowning in the river in their desperation to escape.Phipps 1 p.242 The Anglo-Austrian pursuit was only held off by Antoine B√©ru with some light guns (for which he was promoted to G√©n√©ral de Division the following day). French casualties were 500 killed and wounded, 200 prisoners and 2 guns.Phipps 1 p.242, quoting figures in Dupuis, Nord i note 2, pp 308-9 Aftermath Despite comparatively light casualties, Beaulieu's victory, combined with the loss of Le Quesnoy and catastrophic defeat of Declaye's relief column at Avesnes-le-Sec on 11 September, turned the tables and brought an end to Houchard's campaign. In a very short time the Republicans were back in the defensive positions they‚Äôd started in before Hondschoote. Nevertheless, the rapid withdrawal of the Republican army meant a lost opportunity for the Allies, narrowly preventing the greater potential disaster of being trapped between the forces of York to the north, Beaulieu to the East, and the main body of Coburg's command advancing from Cysoing in the south.Burne p.85 H√©douville and Dumesny were both arrested, but avoided execution. On 24 September Houchard was arrested at Lille on charges of failing to exploit his victory at Hondschoote and for the loss of Le Quesnoy, and was guillotined in Paris on 17 November.

He is mainly known for his publications recording the Imperial art collections kept in the Stallburg gallery.Anton Joseph von Prenner in B√©n√©zit Life and work Details about the life of the artist are very scarce. It is believed von Prenner was born in Wallerstein on 7 March 1683.It is not clear with whom he trained. He initially embarked on a career as a painter of religious scenes. He was active in Augsburg. Anton Joseph von Prenner at the Netherlands Institute for Art History In Budi≈°ov (formerly Budischau in the Iglauer Kreis) he painted altarpieces for the local parish church.Prenner, Anton Joseph von, in: Constant von Wurzbach, Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich, Colume 23, 1856 and 1891, p. 261 He was active in Mikulov (formerly (Nikolsburg in S√ºdm√§hren) in the 1720s where he painted frescoes for Walther Franz Xaver Anton, Prince of Dietrichstein in his renovated castle (destroyed in World War II). He moved to Vienna in 1728 where he is recorded until 1735. He became a court engraver to the emperor in Vienna. He worked together with the Flemish court painter and printmaker Frans van Stampart on various publication projects. He is recorded in Augsburg in 1740. He was an uncle of the painter and engraver Georg Kaspar von Prenner He died in Vienna in 1761. Work Rubens, from the 'Theatrum artis pictoriae' Von Prenner initially worked as a painter. He painted altarpieces for the local parish church in Budi≈°ov and the Dominican Church in Augsburg. One of the latter paintings depicting the Ascension of Christ is in the collection of the Bavarian State Painting Collections.Anton Joseph von Prenner, Himmelfahrt Christi in the collection of the Bavarian State Painting Collections He later changed to making prints. He started collaborating with Frans van Stampart on a publication project that was entitled Theatrum artis pictoriae. The publication was likely inspired by the new display of the Imperial art collection in the Stallburg gallery. The plan was to publish 30 volumes of prints representing the entire Imperial art collection in Stallburg. Only four volumes were printed between 1728 and 1733. Each of the four volumes contains 40 full page copper engravings depicting the paintings in the Stallburg gallery in a laterally inverted way. The first two plates of volume I offer plans of the galleries with views of six rooms. The rendering of the paintings is not always very detailed and sometimes parts of paintings are distorted in the prints. According to which criteria the selection of the paintings was made is not clear and the publication does not offer any art historical explanation. The important achievement of von Prenner and van Stampart was to be the first to include in a publication works from the old German school. Due to the difficult preparatory work and prolonged publication history of the Theatrum, von Prenner and van Stampart published the Prodromus (full title: Prodromus, seu Praeambulare lumen reserati portentosae magnificentiae theatri, quo omnia ad aulam caesaream in Augustissimae suae caesareae) in Vienna in 1735. It was intended to give a preview of the volumes of the Theatrum that had yet to appear ('prodromus' means a preliminary publication or introductory work). The Prodromus offers an overview of the works already published in the Theatrum and a preview of what the next volumes would offer.Alexandra Matzner, Barocke Gem√§ldegalerien und ihre Kataloge Galeriewerke, die Erfindung des Kunstbuchs und der Kunstwissenschaft, 24.

Each of the 24 plates reproduce 960 paintings by 230 painters with fast strokes. Four pages show 228 sculptures, reliefs, gems and medals in the collection. One of the important improvements in the Prodromus in comparison to the Theatrum is that the paintings are rendered not in mirror view starting from plate 8. This publication enjoyed support in high places as is shown by the fact that prominent aristocrats engraved some of the plates: Count Leopold Windischgraetz (plate 9), the counts Anton and Johann Nepomuk Cs√°ky (plates 11 and 13) and Maria Barbara Lemperg (plate 12).Die kaiserliche Stallburggalerie.

The Edkins family, along with 12,000 head of cattle were sent to manage Bowen Downs Station, from which Mount Cornish was later resumed.

This is the first book of a trilogy; its sequels are Good Little Girls (1858) and The Holidays (1859). Plot The story is set in a castle in the French countryside, during the Second French Empire. Sophie is a naughty little girl who lives with her parents, Monsieur and Madame de R√©an. She is very curious and adventurous and keeps making blunders, though she is often reined in by the critical affection of Paul, her cousin, a good-hearted boy, always trying to show her the right track. Sophie's friends are Camille and Madeleine de Fleurville, \\"really good\\" little girls, whom Sophie does her best to imitate. Legacy  The success of Sophie's Misfortunes has been constant through the years and still goes on today; the book has been republished many times. Overseas, as well, it has been very successful. Vladimir Nabokov alluded to it in his novel Ada (1969), making up a novel called Sophie's Sophisms [Les Sophismes de Sophie] by a so- called \\"Miss Stopchin\\", as well Les Malheurs de Swann, a title which combines Countess of S√©gur and Marcel Proust. In United Kingdom, the book was used as reference material to teach young girls French translation (boys would be trained using L'Histoire d'un conscrit de 1813, written by Erckmann-Chatrian).

In the , Cornish Creek had a population of 16 people. On 22 November 2019 the Queensland Government decided to amalgamate the localities in the Barcaldine Region, resulting in five expanded localities based on the larger towns: Alpha, Aramac, Barcaldine, Jericho and Muttaburra. Most of Cornish Creek was incorporated into Muttaburra, except for a small part of eastern Cornish Creek which was incorporated into Aramac.  Geography  The Thomson River forms the south-western boundary of the locality. Cornish Creek flows through the locality from east (Upper Cornish Creek) to west (Tablederry) where it becomes a tributary to the Thomson River. All watercourses in the locality flow into the Lake Eyre drainage basin. The Muttaburra Aramac Road enters the locality from the west (Muttaburra) and passes through the locality exiting to the south (Sardine). Crossmore Road enters the locality from the south-west (Muttaburra) and has its junction with the Muttaburra Aramac Road within the locality. The principal land use is grazing.  History  Cornish Creek is part of the traditional tribal lands of the Iningai. Iningai (also known as Yiningay, Muttaburra, Tateburra, Yinangay, Yinangi) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Iningai people. The Iningai language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Longreach Region and Barcaldine Region, particularly the towns of Longreach, Barcaldine, Muttaburra and Aramac as well as the properties of Bowen Downs and catchments of Cornish Creek and Alice River. The locality is named after the creek, which was in turn named in 1860 by explorer William Landsborough after his business partner Edward Cornish.

Current practice often depends on bearer tokens, which may be lost or stolen. Bearer tokens are also vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks. In contrast, bound tokens are established by a user agent that generates a private-public key pair per target server, providing the public key to the server, and thereafter proving possession of the corresponding private key on every TLS connection to the server. Token Binding is an evolution of the Transport Layer Security Channel ID (previously known as Transport Layer Security ‚Äì Origin Bound Certificates (TLS-OBC)) extension. Industry participation is widespread with standards contributors including Microsoft, Google, PayPal, Ping Identity, and Yubico. Browser support remains limited, however. Only versions of Microsoft Edge using the EdgeHTML engine have support for token binding.  IETF standards  The following group of IETF RFCs and Internet Drafts comprise a set of interrelated specifications for implementing different aspects of the Token Binding standard. * The Token Binding Protocol Version 1.0. Allows client/server applications to create long-lived, uniquely identifiable TLS bindings spanning multiple TLS sessions and connections. Applications are then enabled to cryptographically bind security tokens to the TLS layer, preventing token export and replay attacks. To protect privacy, the Token Binding identifiers are only conveyed over TLS and can be reset by the user at any time. * Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extension for Token Binding Protocol Negotiation. Extension for the negotiation of Token Binding protocol version and key parameters. * Token Binding over HTTP. A collection of mechanisms that allow HTTP servers to cryptographically bind security tokens (such as cookies and OAuth tokens) to TLS connections. * Token Binding for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Version 1.3 Connections. This companion document defines a backwards compatible way to negotiate Token Binding on TLS 1.3 connections. * HTTPS Token Binding with TLS Terminating Reverse Proxies. Defines HTTP header fields that enable a TLS terminating reverse proxy to convey information to a backend server about the validated Token Binding Message received from a client, which enables that backend server to bind, or verify the binding of, cookies and other security tokens to the client's Token Binding key. This facilitates the reverse proxy and backend server functioning together as though they are a single logical server side deployment of HTTPS Token Binding. Related IETF draft standard: * OAuth 2.0 Token Binding. Enables OAuth 2.0 implementations to apply Token Binding to Access Tokens, Authorization Codes, Refresh Tokens, JWT Authorization Grants, and JWT Client Authentication. This cryptographically binds these tokens to a client's Token Binding key pair, possession of which is proven on the TLS connections over which the tokens are intended to be used. This use of Token Binding protects these tokens from man-in-the-middle and token export and replay attacks.  Related standards  The use of TLS Token Binding allows for more robust web authentication. Several web authentication standards developed by standards bodies outside of IETF are adopting the draft standards. * Draft OpenID Connect Token Bound Authentication 1.0. OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. OIDC enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable, REST-like manner. The OIDC Token Bound Authentication specification enables OIDC implementations to apply Token Binding to the OIDC ID Token. This cryptographically binds the ID Token to the TLS connection over which the authentication occurred. This use of Token Binding protects the authentication flow from man-in-the-middle and token export and replay attacks. * W3C Proposed Recommendation for Web Authentication: An API for accessing Public Key Credentials. Web Authentication (WebAuthn), an interface for public-key authentication of users to web-based applications and services, supports Token Binding.

In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of C√¥te-des- Neiges‚ÄìNotre-Dame-de-Gr√¢ce, LaSalle, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, and Montr√©al-Nord have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population. History Mathieu de Costa, the first recorded free black person to arrive in Canada. The first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named Mathieu de Costa. Travelling with navigator Samuel de Champlain, de Costa arrived in Nova Scotia some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from Madagascar named Olivier Le Jeune, who may have been of partial Malay ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the French Army and Navy, though some were enslaved or indentured servants. Marie-Joseph Ang√©lique, a black slave from the Madeira islands who arrived in New France in 1725, was accused of setting the fire that burned down most of Montreal on 10 April 1734, for which she was executed.l Ang√©lique confessed under torture to setting fire to the home of her owner, a Mme Francois Poulin de Francheville, as a way of creating a diversion so she could escape as she did not wish to be separated from her lover, a white servant named Claude Thibault. Ang√©lique believed her owner was going to sell her to the owner of a sugar plantation in the West Indies. Whether this confession was genuine or not continues to divide historians. Joseph, a black slave who spoke French and English, escaped from his owner in Montreal in 1769. Several other black slaves escaped from the area over the following decades. Many of Canada's railway porters were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from the South, New York City, and Washington, D.C. They settled mainly in the major cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, which had major rail connections. In Montreal, they settled primarily in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel. To combat poverty and social exclusion, the nascent black community of Little Burgundy founded numerous social organizations: the Women's Coloured Club of Montreal in 1902, the Union United Congregational Church in 1907, and the Negro Community Center in 1927.\\"Little Burgundy.\\" McGill University Faculty of Architecture. Accessed July 4, 2011. The neighbourhood became famous for producing several talented jazz musicians. During Prohibition and the later pre-Jean Drapeau years as an 'open city,' Little Burgundy was home to many lively nightclubs featuring homegrown and international performers; one of them was Rockhead's Paradise, owned by Rufus Rockhead, after whom a street is named. Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones are the two best-known musicians who emerged from the bebop and post-bop era. In 1968 the Sir George Williams affair occurred as a result of racist policies at Sir George Williams University. West Indian women, from both the Francophone and Anglophone Caribbean, came to Montreal after the Domestic Immigration Program of 1955 was established.Dubinsky, Karen. \\"\\"We Adopted a Negro\\": Interractial Adoption and the Hybrid Baby in 1960s Canada\\" (Chapter 11).

This coincided with the dissolution of the British Empire in the Caribbean. Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans came from that region, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. Today's Black Canadians are largely of Caribbean origin, with some of recent African origin, and smaller numbers from the United States, Europe and Latin America. Montreal's Haitian community of 100,000 people is the largest in Canada. Large percentages of Haitians live in Montr√©al-Nord, Saint-Michel and R.D.P. Today, Haitian Creole is the sixth most spoken language in Montreal and the seventh most spoken language in the province of Quebec. Culture Carifiesta () is an annual Caribbean Carnival held in Montreal. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent. The Montreal Black Film Festival is held annually. Black Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, R&B;, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Some of the earliest musical influences include Oliver Jones, Oscar Peterson and Charlie Biddle. Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of creating a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture.Rinaldo Walcott, Black Like Who?: Writing Black Canada. 2003, Insomniac Press. . For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution.

Dating to the first half of the 19th century are a remarkable concentration of buildings constructed in a regionally distinctive snecked ashlar technique brought to the area by Scottish masons. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history In the early 1830s, skilled masons from Scotland came to central Vermont to work on building projects there. A number of these, mainly from the Aberdeen area, were experienced in snecked ashlar construction, in which plates of stone are affixed to a rubblestone wall. This type of construction is generally rare in the United States, and is found on about 50 surviving buildings in the state of Vermont. The highest concentration of them is on the north side of Chester Depot village, lining Vermont Route 103, and is known locally as the Stone Village. with Two Scottish masons, brothers Alison and Wiley Clark, came to the town of Chester in 1832 to work on large factory building (now no longer standing). In 1834, Doctor Ptolmey Edson hired the brothers to build his house, which was the first snecked ashlar structure in the village. It was followed by a series of other buildings, most of which are residences. The church and district school were also built of stone, possibly due to the influence of Dr. Edson, who sat on their respective building committees. Most of the houses are either Cape-style houses of 1-1/2 stories or two-story structures, in either case with some Greek Revival styling in the trim details. Thirteen of the seventeen buildings in the district are stone; the other four date to a similar time period (roughly 1830-50). One building, a large wood-frame tavern house at the northern end of the district, was destroyed by fire in 2012.

Part of the Xperia X series, the device was announced to the public along with the Xperia X Compact at a press conference held at the annual IFA event on September 1, 2016. The Xperia XZ was first released in Taiwan on September 30, 2016, with worldwide sales starting with the United Arab Emirates on October 1 and the United States the following day; its home country Japan only started sales on November 2, 2016. The device is described by Expert Reviews as the \\"true successor\\" of the Xperia Z5 and the whole Xperia Z series, and was succeeded Xperia Z5 Premium and Xperia X Performance as Sony's flagship. It is succeeded by the Xperia XZs and the flagship Sony Xperia XZ Premium. It is also one of the first smartphones manufactured by Sony to utilize USB-C connectivity for charging and data transfer. Compared to its predecessors, the rear camera of the Xperia XZ now has laser autofocus, a first for Sony, built- in alongside the hybrid contrast/phase detection autofocus also found on the previous flagship. It also the first Sony device to sport an RGBC-IR color sensor to assist the image sensor in capturing accurate colors, temperature and white balance and the first smartphone to feature a five-axis digital image stabilization system for capturing blur-free photos and videos. The phone also has an IP68 rating, with it being dust and water resistant. Specifications =Hardware= Xperia XZ in Platinum with Style Cover Touch SCTF10 The Xperia XZ's design consists of 3 different materials that seamlessly blend together in what Sony calls \\"Loop Surface\\": a nylon frame, scratch-resistant front glass and an aluminium alloy metal back. The rear cover of the device is made from an aluminium alloy marketed as ALKALEIDO, a trademark by Kobe Steel, specifically engineered to complement the smartphone's premium design with a material \\"that has an extra shine and a feeling of depth\\". The device's front side is covered in Gorilla Glass to protect it from scratches and high drops. Also up front are dual front-firing stereo speakers, one on top along with the front selfie camera, ambient light and proximity sensors and notification LED, and the other one at the bottom bezel. The Xperia XZ's dimensions are in height, with a width of and a depth of and weighs approximately . The device brings back the 1080p IPS LCD display with a pixel density of 424 ppi that started with the Xperia Z2 but with a brand new panel, featuring Sony's TRILUMINOS‚Ñ¢ display and X-Reality for mobile technology. It is powered by a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 (MSM8996) chipset with 4 custom Kryo processors (2x 2.15 GHz and 2x 1.6 GHz), 3 GB of RAM and relies on the Adreno 530 clocked at 624 MHz for graphics rendering. The device also has an internal storage of 32 GB for the single-SIM variant and 64 GB for the dual-SIM variant, both with microSD card expansions up to 256 GB (in a hybrid slot for the dual-SIM variant). The Xperia XZ antennas support up to a maximum of LTE Category 9https://www.sonymobile.com/global- en/products/phones/xperia-xz/specifications/ speeds with a maximum theoretical downlink speed of 450-500 Mbit/s using 3CA, excluding the SOV34 model whose maximum theoretical downlink 3CA speed is limited to maximum 370 Mbit/s. =Connectivity and Features= Unlike some recently released smartphones from competing brands, the Xperia XZ doesn't abandon the standard 3.5 mm audio jack in favor of wireless substitutes. It does, however, have LDAC, an audio coding technology developed by Sony, that enables the transmission of 24bit/96 kHz High-Resolution (Hi-Res) audio content over Bluetooth at up to 990 kbit/s, three times faster than conventional audio streaming codecs, to compatible audio devices. It also has the standard set of connectivity options like Bluetooth 4.2 LE with aptX, NFC, dual-band Wi-Fi with Wi-Fi Direct, DLNA and hotspot, GPS and A-GPS, GLONASS and BDS. Like its predecessors, it has an IP rating of IP68, making the Xperia XZ dust proof and water resistant for over 1.5 meters and 30 minutes under water. The device also feature a fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button that can be used to unlock the phone and secure it from unauthorized access. This feature is disabled by default in the US. =Battery= The Xperia XZ is powered by a non-removable 2900 mAh battery, with a USB-C connector for charging and data transfer, one of the first two Sony smartphones to have one, the other one being the Xperia X Compact. It has QuickCharge 3.0 support and Qnovo adaptive charging technology built-in. This allows the device to monitor the cell's electrochemical processes in real time and adjust charging parameters accordingly to minimize cell damage and extend the battery cell's lifespan. It also comes with Battery Care, a Sony proprietary feature, that controls the charging process of the phone by learning and recognizing the user's charging patterns, preventing the phone from damaging the battery's cells from excessive heat due to overcharging. For example, when charging overnight, Battery Care stops the initial charge to 90 percent and then continue charging until full where it left off the next day. =Camera= The rear camera of the Xperia XZ features a new multi-aspect 24.8MP Sony Exmor RS image sensor, officially named as Sony IMX300. Similar to the Xperia Z5 series, the Xperia X and Xperia X Performance, it has 23 megapixels with a sensor size of 1/2.3 inch and a f/2.0 aperture. Sony introduces the Triple Image Sensing technology with the Xperia XZ, comprised by the Image sensing (CMOS sensor with PDAF), Distance sensing (Laser AF sensor) and Color sensing (RGBC-IR sensor) systems. It features a hybrid autofocus that utilizes phase detection to lock focus on a subject within 0.03 seconds, also same with the Xperia Z5. It also includes phase and contrast detection along with predictive motion tracking, both working together to adjust the right amount of contrast accurately and significantly reduce blur and image shift caused by shaky hands. The Xperia XZ, for the first time, includes a laser autofocus sensor alongside the hybrid/PDAF in tracking and locking focus on an object faster than regular autofocus modes, and an RGBC-IR (RedGreenBlueClear-InfraRed) color sensor that assists the white balance function of the camera by providing additional data about the light conditions of the environment, thus improving the color accuracy of the image. It also has an upgraded SteadyShot with Intelligent Auto in addition to the 5-axis image stabilization. The front selfie camera has a 13 megapixel sensor with 22 mm and 90 degree wide angle lens, making it the highest- resolution front-facer on a flagship Sony device. The device also has 4K resolution video recording capabilities like the Xperia Z5. Similar to the Sony Œ±7 II camera, the Xperia XZ features five-axis digital image stabilization, a first for a smartphone, that helps in producing smooth video with less camera shake and improved image quality in low light environments. This technology improves the image and video produced by detecting camera shake, such as angular motion consisting of pitch and yaw, shift shakes which consists of X and Y axis shifts and (rotational shake) by correcting the effects detected, shifting the lens to reduce visible image blur and shift shake. Software The Sony Xperia XZ launches with Android 6.0 Marshmallow out of the box, with Sony's custom interface and software. On December 1, 2016, along with the Xperia X Performance and a few other Xperia devices, Sony announced that the Xperia XZ would receive an update to Android 7.0 Nougat. Just a day after, the Android 7.0 update has officially rolled out.

The study's first wave of data collection took place in 2006, and surveyed 2,610 people. In 2008, the researchers attempted re-contact with the 522 original respondents who attended religious services several times per year despite not being a member of a religious congregation. The original 2006 study was led by sociologists Michael Emerson of Rice University and David Sikkink of the University of Notre Dame. In 2012, the researchers surveyed exactly the same people they originally surveyed six years earlier. The 2012 survey showed that a significantly higher percent of Americans (58%) respected all religions equally than did in the original 2006 survey (one- third). In 2016, University of Oklahoma sociologist Samuel Perry analyzed data from the PALS and found that people who watch pornography at least once a week are more likely to be religious six years later. A 2013 Brandeis University analysis of the PALS found that people who consider religion important in their lives are more likely to make decisions based on their religion.

She has been called \\"one of the foremost bibliographers of her time,\\" despite working in a scholarly field in which \\"the overwhelming majority has been male.\\" Biography Henrietta Bartlett was born in 1873 in Old Lyme, Connecticut. Her mother, Anne Terry, was a member of the prominent New England Terry family, which included the major book collector Roderick Terry (1849-1933). Her father, Charles G. Bartlett, attended Yale University and received an MA in 1888; he later ran a school in Old Lyme, Black Hall School. She had three siblings: a brother, Charles G. Bartlett, who attended Yale; another brother, Commander Harold ‚ÄúHarry‚Äù Bartlett, a Navy airman; and a sister who moved west after her marriage. Bartlett lived in New Haven and New York City for most of her life. She attended boarding school in New England, where she first met Ruth S. Granniss, librarian to the Grolier Club; the two were close friends throughout their lives.Henrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 1, folder 90. Bartlett possibly spent some time as a schoolteacher in the late 1890s and early 1900s, when she is listed as living at the Robert Bartlett School in New London, Connecticut.‚ÄúHenrietta Bartlett.‚Äù Ancestry.com. Retrieved 11 March 2020 In 1900, she enrolled in library school at the Pratt Institute in New York City.The Pratt Institute Monthly, vol. 9. November 1900. 51. Her early work in the field was as a private librarian and cataloguer to Beverly Chew and William A. White, major collectors of their day. In this capacity, Bartlett could examine first-hand copies of most of the early editions of Shakespeare and contemporary writers, which prepared her to write the Census that is her greatest legacy. Like most bibliophile clubs, the Grolier did not allow women members, and so like Granniss, Bartlett became a member of the Hroswitha Club, the major women's bibliophile club. She remained actively involved in the New York City bibliophilic community throughout her life, where she was known not only as a bibliographer but also as a curator of public exhibits, including a major exhibit on Shakespeare at the New York Public Library in 1916.Bartlett, Henrietta. Catalogue of the exhibition of Shakespeareana held at the New York public library, April 2 to July 15, 1916, in commemoration of the tercentenary of Shakespeare's death. New York: 1917 In the 1920s and 1930s, Bartlett gave lectures in bibliography at Yale, at a time when university courses in bibliography were rare in the United States. Bartlett herself noted that there were ‚Äúno regular lectures on these subjects except in some of the large colleges and those very recent.‚ÄùHenrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 6, folder 306. Subjects included textual editing, cataloguing, collecting, provenance, and the history of printing, as well as lectures on a range of topics and authors in English literature: Shakespeare, seventeenth-century poetry, English prose fiction, and Alexander Pope. She also led private courses for women in her home. Bartlett spent her retirement living in Old LymeHenrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 5, folder 244., although she continued to maintain a lively correspondence on bibliographic matters with a wide range of colleagues at Yale and elsewhere. She died in 1963, at the age of ninety. Census of Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto In 1913, Bartlett was commissioned by the Elizabethan Club to co-edit the 1916 Census of Shakespeare's Plays in Quarto with the British bibliographer Alfred W. Pollard. Bartlett negotiated with the Club to be paid for her work, explaining that she was ‚Äúobliged to work for my bread and cheese[.]‚ÄùHenrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 1, folder 64. Bartlett and Pollard's Census was the first attempt to locate and catalogue systematically all extant copies of Shakespeare quartos before 1709. The project relied on the existing expertise of Bartlett and Pollard, but it also incorporated bibliographic data from many libraries, universities, booksellers, and private collectors; Bartlett later noted that she had sent out over 400 letters requesting information in the lead-up to publication in 1916.Henrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 3, folder 147. Bartlett continued to revise and expand the existing data, and (without Pollard) she compiled a new and more complete edition of the Census in 1939. The Census provides a wealth of information on the provenance, condition, binding, and size of each copy. The Census has been expanded and updated in an online version, the Shakespeare Census, which acknowledges that it is \\"modelled on and extends the groundbreaking bibliographic work of Henrietta C. Bartlett.\\" The Shakespeare Census includes numerous additional copies of the plays that Bartlett catalogued, which were unknown to her in 1939, and also catalogues copies of a number of Shakespearean and pseudo-Shakespearean works not in her Census, including Pericles, the Sonnets, Venus and Adonis, The Rape of Lucrece, and others. Scholarly reputation Especially following the publication of the Census in 1916, Bartlett was widely regarded as a \\"bibliographer of distinction.\\" The Census was favorably reviewed in a range of publications‚ÄúShakespeare Quartos,‚Äù The Nation, 18 October 1917. and Bartlett received letters of thanks from major scholars and collectors in the field.The Census was praised by, among others, the bookseller Frederick Ferguson (of Quaritch Ltd), the collector Henry Folger, and the Folger Reference Librarian Giles Dawson. See Henrietta C Bartlett Papers, Beinecke Library, Yale University. Gen MSS 336, Box 1. In the ensuing years, she published prolifically on the early texts of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays and was frequently asked to give public lectures. Still, she recognized that‚Äîwithout a traditional academic background‚Äîher legitimacy within the field of Shakespeare studies might still be questioned. As she wrote wryly to a colleague in 1916: ‚ÄúI speak at U[niversity] of P[ennsylvania] April 12th on ‚ÄúShakespeare Folios and Quartos‚Äù and Prof. Schelling is sadly asking if I have any academic degrees! Alas, I never heard of a degree and am merely a humble person who happens to know something about Shakespeare.‚ÄùElizabethan Club Papers, Manuscripts & Archives, Yale University. RU 36, b. 5, ff. 236-238. Bartlett gave invited lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of London School of Librarianship (see Henrietta Bartlett Papers, Gen MSS 336, Box 5, folder 252), and the New York Public Library, among others. All of the major Shakespeare collectors of the day corresponded with Bartlett, often seeking her advice on their copies. She sorted out the proper ordering of the preliminary material in the First Folio for Carl Pforzheimer, for instance, noting that she had typed her letter to him herself \\"as I am afraid of mistakes of importance if I have it copied, unfortunately I am not as good a typist as a bibliographer, hence the erasures.\\" Her papers, now at the Beinecke Library, include correspondence with important contemporary bibliographic scholars, collectors, and book dealers, including Henry Folger, Henry Huntington, Mary Hyde, R.B. McKerrow, Seymour de Ricci, Hyder Rollins, just to name a few. Often her work went less acknowledged than that of her male collaborators. The Book Collector's Guide (1921) was credited to de Ricci alone, even though de Ricci himself noted: ‚ÄúMiss Henrietta C. Bartlett, whose share in my labours has been so considerable that in all fair justice her name should have appeared on the title page. Not only did she continually assist me in the collection of data, the preparation of the copy, and the arduous reading of the proofs, but her accurate mind and well-balanced judgment have done more than I am able to express towards making this Guide acceptable to the public and useful to the general reader.‚Äù Works *A garland of poppies gathered by Ruth S.
