History  It opened on 20 April 1927 as a members-only club for the performance of unlicensed plays, thus avoiding theatre censorship by the Lord Chamberlain's office. It was one of a small number of committed, independent theatre companies, including the Hampstead Everyman, the Gate Theatre Studio and the Q Theatre, which took risks by producing a diverse range of new and experimental plays, or plays that were thought to be commercially non-viable on the West End. The theatrical producer Norman Marshall referred to these as 'The Other Theatre' in his 1947 book of the same name. Arts Theatre in 2011 The theatre opened with a revue by Herbert Farjeon entitled Picnic, produced by Harold Scott and with music by Beverley Nichols. Its first important production was Young Woodley by John Van Druten, staged in 1928, which later transferred to the Savoy Theatre when the Lord Chamberlain's ban was lifted. In 1938, a four-week revival of the Stokes brothers' Oscar Wilde, starring Francis L. Sullivan and produced by Ronald Adam, opened on 25 October. This coincided with a Broadway production of the play. In 1942, Alec Clunes and John Hanau took over the running of the theatre and for ten years produced a wide range of plays, winning a reputation as a 'pocket national theatre'. In 1946, Clunes teamed with author Peter Elstob to raise £20,000, which eventually put the theatre on a sound financial footing. Ronnie Barker made his West End début at the production of Mourning Becomes Electra at the Arts Theatre in 1955 which was directed by Sir Peter Hall, with whom Barker had worked at the Oxford Playhouse. Barker remained a West End actor for some years, appearing in numerous plays between 1955 and 1968. These included two performances each night as he played a gypsy in Listen to the Wind at the Arts Theatre in 1955. In August 1955, aged 24, Hall directed the English-language premiere of Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot at the theatre. This was an important turning point in modern theatre for Britain. Subsequently, from 1956 to 1959, Hall ran the Arts Theatre. According to Who's Who in the Theatre (14th and 15th editions), between April 1962 and January 1967 the Arts Theatre was known as the New Arts Theatre. From 1967 to 1999 the Arts also became a home for the Unicorn children's theatre, under the direction of its founder Caryl Jenner who took over the lease. Meanwhile, adult performances continued in the evening, including Tom Stoppard's satirical double-bill Dirty Linen and New-Found-Land which, opening in June 1976, ran for four years at the Arts. The theatre's lease was taken over by a consortium of UK and US producers in 2000 for a five-year period, and it was relaunched as a West End theatre with the anniversary production of Julian Mitchell's play Another Country, directed by Stephen Henry. Notable productions during this time included Closer to Heaven, the Jonathan Harvey/Pet Shop Boys musical, and The Vagina Monologues. In 2011, the theatre was taken over by JJ Goodman and led by Artistic Director Mig Kimpton under the business management of Louis Hartshorn. The Arts now operates as the West End's smallest commercial receiving house, seating a maximum of 350 in a two-tier basement auditorium.New Management for London's Arts Theatre In 2014, Louis Hartshorn took over from Mig Kimpton as Executive Director and alongside long standing business partner Brian Hook as Producer. Expanding over an additional floor the Arts Theatre now houses two rehearsal rooms and a 60-capacity studio theatre 'Above the Arts'.

Kidskin, used for gloves, shoes and other accessories, is traditionally goatskin, although other leathers such as sheep and kangaroo can be used to make kid. Tanned leather from goatskin is considered extremely durable and is commonly used to make rugs (for example in Indonesia) and carpet binding. It is often used for gloves, boots, and other products that require a soft hide. Kid gloves, popular in Victorian times, are still made today. It has been a major material for leather bookbindings for centuries, and the oldest European binding, that of the St Cuthbert Gospel in the British Library is in red goatskin. Goatskin is used for a traditional Spanish container for wine bota bag (or called goatskin). Traditional kefir was made in bags from goatskin. Non tanned goatskin is used for parchment or for drumheads or sounding boards of some musical instruments, e.g., mišnice in medieval Europe, bodhrán in Ireland, esraj in India and for instrumental drum skin named bedug in Indonesia. In Roman mythology priests of god Lupercalia wore goatskins. A breed of goat that provides high-quality skin is for example the Black Bengal breed, native to Bangladesh. In 1974, there was controversy in the United States surrounding goatskin products originating in Haiti. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control discovered that some of these products contained deadly anthrax spores. All Haitian goatskin products in the USA were recalled, although no fatalities were reported.

Smoketown has been a historically black neighborhood since the Civil War. It is the only neighborhood in the city that has had such a continuous presence. Smoketown is bounded by Broadway, CSX railroad tracks, Kentucky Street, and I-65. History The neighborhood's name apparently comes from the large number of (smoke-producing) kilns in the area during its early brick-making days. An 1823 newspaper advertises a brickyard in the area as part of the farm and residence of \\"the late Mark Lampton\\", after whom Lampton Street is probably named. 9 of 20 brickyards in the city had Smoketown addresses according to an 1871 Caron's directory,http://library.louisville.edu/archives/city-directory although none remained by 1880, as apparently the supply of clay from under the neighborhood had run out. The abandoned, water-filled clay pits may have given rise to the name \\"Frogtown\\" for the neighborhood, which appeared in print in 1880. Some residential development by whites of German ancestry began in the 1850s, but due to the arrival of thousands of freed slaves who moved there from various parts of rural Kentucky after the Civil War, it was solidly African American by 1870. A streetcar line was extended down Preston Street to Kentucky in 1865, spurring growth. With its shotgun houses and narrow streets, Smoketown was a densely populated area with a population of over 15,000 by 1880. African American property ownership was rare, with most living in properties rented from whites. By the 1960s the area had high crime and unemployment rates, causing massive population loss. Many of the old shotgun houses have been razed and housing projects built in their place. Since the 1950s, Smoketown has been massively depopulated. As of 2000, the population of Smoketown was 2,116, a decrease of over 38% from 1990. Revitalization In May 2011, Louisville received a $22 million federal Hope VI award that will allow the demolition of the deteriorating Sheppard Square housing project, replacing it with new, mixed-income housing. In Mayor Fischer's Budget Address of May 26, 2011, he said: > You all heard the exciting news this week about Sheppard Square. The project > will have a value of $157 million over the next decade. Our budget includes > $1.6 million to help integrate that new development into the surrounding > neighborhood. That will not only make the area a better place to live, but > will set the table for the private businesses that settle into any healthy > neighborhood. On July 12, 2012, Construction of nine new homes has recently begun near the site of the former Sheppard Square housing development. The nine homes consist of eight in the 500 block of East Breckinridge and one on South Shelby Street. On December 10, 2012, construction began between Hancock, Jacob, Finzer and Jackson Streets, on a $100 million redevelopment of a new, and revitalized mixed-income Sheppard Square housing neighborhood, with a completion date of December 2015. Demographics As of 2000, the population of Smoketown was 2,232, of which 13.1% is white, 81.2% is black, 1.8% is listed as other, and 3.8% is Hispanic. College graduates make up 6.0% of the population, and people without a high school degree make up 42.7%. Females outnumber males 53.4% to 46.6%. Notable locations * Albert E. Meyzeek Middle School is located in the neighborhood at 828 S Jackson St. * Bates Memorial Missionary Baptist Church is located in Smoketown at 620 E Lampton St. * The Presbyterian Community Center at 701 S Hancock St. was a feature of the Smoketown neighborhood for over 115 years when it closed in 2013.http://www.wdrb.com/story/24086873/presbyterian-community-center-to- close-for-good In 2015, Jefferson County Public Schools took over the building to offer Early Head Start programming and renamed the center the Ernest 'Camp' Edwards Education Complex.

Linked by a walking track from Walhalla Road, the cricket ground is perched at the top of a hill. Because there was a lack of flat ground in the township the mining community, in their spare time, carved the top off the mountain to construct a ground, this work being completed in 1882. It is claimed that the half-hour climb up the hill to reach the ground, in conjunction with the long trip to Walhalla itself, ensured a home advantage. In the heyday of Walhalla's goldmining era, the ground was used for organised sporting events, including those of the Walhalla Football Association. Since large-scale mining stopped in 1910, the ground has largely been a tourist destination and curiosity, though it remained the site of occasional social cricket matches. It is referenced in Weddings Parties Anything's song \\"The Ghosts of Walhalla\\". The Walhalla Cricket Club (inc.) has been established since 1882 and is currently restoring the ground as a sporting venue for visiting teams and also for social matches. In recent years the playing surface had been badly damaged by motorbikes and 4X4 vehicle. Enquiries about the ground can be made via the Walhalla Post Office and museum.

The South West Coast Path runs through Maenporth. Behind the cove, wetland supports varied birdlife including the grey heron and the little egret. The beach shelves gently and at low water leaves an area of shallow water that is safe for swimming. The beach has facilities for launching boats, scuba diving and sea kayaking. Other facilities include car parking, a cafe and public toilets. On the hill above the beach is modern holiday accommodation in the Maenporth Estate. Neighbouring beaches include Swanpool and Gyllyngvase. History The beach head has been built up by Easterly weather, and covers a previous natural harbour and human activity.

It tells the Parable of the Sower, with its explanation, and the parable of the Mustard Seed. Both of these parables are paralleled in Matthew and Luke, but this chapter also has a parable unique to Mark, the Seed Growing Secretly. The chapter ends with Jesus calming the storm. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 41 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (AD 325-350; complete) *Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330-360; complete) *Codex Bezae (ca. AD 400; complete) *Codex Washingtonianus (ca. AD 400; complete) *Codex Alexandrinus (AD 400-440; complete) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (ca. AD 450; complete) Parables Jesus goes to the lake (the Sea of Galilee), sits in a boat, and speaks to \\"a great multitude\\" (). The Pulpit Commentary notes that \\"the Greek adjective, according to the most approved reading, is πλεῖστος, pleistos, the superlative of πολὺς, polus, and should be rendered 'a very great' multitude. The room and the little courtyard no longer sufficed for the multitudes that came to him.\\"Pulpit Commentary on Mark 4, accessed 6 June 2017 =The Sower= The first parable Mark relates is the Parable of the Sower, with Jesus speaking of himself as a sower or farmer and his seed as his word. Much of the seed comes to no account but \\"still other seed fell on good soil. It came up, grew and produced a crop, multiplying thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times.\\" (4:8) His disciples (students) do not understand why he is teaching in parables or even what the meaning of the parables are. Later, after the crowds have left and Jesus tells them \\"The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that, 'they may be ever seeing but never perceiving, and ever hearing but never understanding; otherwise they might turn and be forgiven!'\\" ( 4:11-12), with Jesus quoting Isaiah 6:9-10. Early Christians used this passage from Isaiah \\"...to explain the lack of a positive response to Jesus and his followers from their fellow Jews.\\" (Miller 21) He rebukes them for not understanding him, and explains his meaning, and that those who accept his word, i.e. his teaching are the ones who will produce the large \\"crop\\". This is also found in Luke 8:4-15 and Matthew 13:1-23. It is also saying 9 of the Gospel of Thomas. =Lamp on a Stand= the parable of \\"a lamp on a stand\\", together with the parable of the Growing Seed, in Mark 4. Jesus then speaks of a lamp on a stand, that one does not put it under concealment but allows to shine (). He says, \\"For whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed, and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open. If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear,\\" (4:22-23) the last sentence being, judging from all available texts, a favorite saying of Jesus. This is also in Luke 11:33 and perhaps in Matthew 10:26-27. \\"'Consider carefully what you hear,' he continued. 'With the measure you use, it will be measured to you—and even more. Whoever has will be given more; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.'\\" (4:24-25) The Scholars Version translates these verses like such: \\"...The standard you apply will be the standard applied to you, and then some. In fact, to those who have, more will be given, and from those who don't have, even what they do have will be taken away!\\" Mark 4:25 also occurs in the Parable of the Talents (, ) and , , Thomas 41. Mark 4:24 also occurs in and . =The Growing Seed= The parable of the Growing Seed (verses 26-29) and the parable of the Mustard Seed (verses 30-32) follow, each showing analogies with nature and small beginnings yielding much more in the end. They are both illustrations of the growth of the kingdom of God. In the Seed Growing Secretly Jesus used the metaphor of a man planting a seed and then paying it no attention until \\"As soon as the grain is ripe, he puts the sickle to it, because the harvest has come.\\" (29) This is partially replicated in Thomas 21 The mustard seed, says Jesus, is like the kingdom of God because it starts out as the smallest seed and yet \\"...becomes the largest of all garden plants, with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade.\\" (32) This is in Matthew 13:31-32 and Luke 13:18-19. It is also saying 20 of Thomas. Great Miracles Rembrandt's The Storm on the Sea of Galilee, 1633 From to the end of chapter 5, \\"four striking works follow each other without a break\\".Chadwick, G. A. (1896), Four Miracles, in The Gospel according to Saint Mark These accounts of miracles raise the stakes over miracles which have been reported before. Mark probably intends to demonstrate the greatness of Jesus' authority (εξουσíα, exousia). Chapter 4 ends with an account of Jesus calming the storm at sea. He is sleeping while crossing the lake in a boat with his disciples. Mark notes that they left a large crowd, that they took Him \\"just as He was\\", and that other boats were with Him.Buls, H. H., Buls' Notes on Mark 4:35-41, accessed 15 November 2017 A storm comes up and they frantically wake him: :\\"He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \`Peace! Be still!\`. Then the wind ceased and there was a dead calm...And they were filled with great awe and said to one another \`Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?\\" (Mark 4:39-41, NRSV) The (siōpa) in verse 39 means \\"silence\\", and is so translated in the New Living Translation and the Holman Christian Standard Bible.BibleGateway.com: Mark 4:39 Dr. R. A. Cole, author of the commentary on Mark in the Tyndale New Testament Commentary series, writes: :\\"We must remember that miracles are not meaningless magic but designed to show us who Jesus was.\\" The Ninth Wave by Ivan Constantinovich Aivazovsky 1817-1900 The story of the calming of the sea Complete Gospels, Robert J. Miller editor, 1992, translation note to Mark 4:35-41: \\"...Mark calls this lake the sea, using a word (thalassa) that most Greek writers reserve for the much larger Mediterranean (Luke uses the more proper term for a lake, limne, in ; 8:22-23, 33. ...\\" and the miracles which follow demonstrate Jesus' authority over nature. Jesus has authority over not only men but even an untamable man, delivering the demoniac from not merely one demon but a whole army of demons (see Mark 5). At the climax of these miracle accounts, Jesus does not merely heal the sick, but he raises the dead girl, all of which sets the reader up for a greater contrast when Jesus is rejected in his home town of Nazareth (6:1-6) in Mark 6 (see France for an extended discussion).

It is to the south of Falmouth town centre, but was an essentially rural area as recently as the late 19th century. However, the growth of tourism in the town at around the turn of the 20th century saw the area become more built-up and the seafront on Cliff Road became home to several major hotels. The Bay Hotel opened in 1909 halfway along Cliff Road, but closed due to a fire in 1990 and was demolished three years later. Bay Court, a four-storey block of private apartments, was built on the site. Queen Mary Gardens were opened next to Gyllngvase Beach in 1910. Palm Beach Hotel, built in the 1930s, was demolished in 2007. It overlooked Queen Mary Gardens and had closed several years earlier, having been attacked by vandals and arsonists after its closure. On 30 April 2012 the Falmouth Beach Hotel was devastated by a fire which broke out on the third floor, which caused the roof to collapse and significant damage to the building. The blaze was tackled by some 100 fire fighters. A Russian bulk carrier, the MV Kuzma Minin, ran aground off Gyllyngvase on 18 December 2018, and was refloated the same day. The beach at Gyllngvase is wide crescent shaped, gently shelving sandy beach with rockpools to explore and is popular with bathers due to the generally calm conditions.

He was an English statesman and soldier. Family William Drury, born at Hawstead in Suffolk on 2 October 1527, was the third son of Sir Robert Drury (c. 1503–1577) of Hedgerley, Buckinghamshire, and Elizabeth Brudenell, the daughter of Edmund Brudenell of Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire. He was the grandson of another Sir Robert Drury (c. 1456–2 March 1535), Speaker of the House of Commons in 1495. He was a brother of Sir Robert Drury (1525–1593) and Sir Drue Drury (1531/2–1617).. Career Drury was educated at Gonville College, Cambridge. Fighting in France, Drury was taken prisoner in 1544; then after his release, he helped Lord Russell, afterwards Earl of Bedford, to quell a rising in Devonshire in 1549, but he did not come to the front until the reign of Elizabeth I. In 1554 he sat as Member of Parliament for Chipping Wycombe. In 1559, he was sent to Edinburgh to report on the condition of Scottish politics, and five years later he became Marshal and deputy-governor of Berwick-upon-Tweed. He was a close observer of the affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots and her house-arrest in Loch Leven Castle, was in constant communication with Lord Burghley and wrote to him on 3 April 1568 regarding her escape from that place on 25 March, about which he gave a full account. He went to Scotland with Sir Henry Gates and met Regent Moray in the Great Hall of Stirling Castle on 19 January 1570, and they had a discussion in his bedchamber after dinner.Edmund Lodge, Illustrations of British History, vol. 2 (London, 1791), pp. 28-30. Moray was proceeding to keep an appointment with Drury in Linlithgow when he was mortally wounded, and it was probably intended that Drury should be murdered also. After this event, Drury led two raids into Scotland; at least thrice he went to that country on more peaceable errands, during which, however, his life was continually in danger from assassins. As ambassador with Thomas Randolph in April 1572 he stayed at Restalrig Deanery. There he plotted with Archibald Douglas to kidnap George, Lord Seton from the shore at Leith, but the plan did not take effect.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 297 In May 1573 he commanded the force which compelled Edinburgh Castle to surrender. A year later, a letter of the defeated and executed commander of castle, William Kirkcaldy of Grange came to light, which mentioned the jewels Mary, Queen of Scots had left behind in Scotland, and that Drury had taken some for a loan of £600.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 36. In 1576, he was sent to Ireland as President of Munster, where his rule was severe but effective, and in 1578 he became Lord Justice of Ireland, taking the chief control of affairs after the departure of Sir Henry Sidney. The Second Desmond Rebellion had just broken out when Sir William died in October 1579. Drury's letters to Cecil, and others, are invaluable for the story of the relations between England and Scotland at this time. His house in London gave its name to the street Drury Lane.

High Bridge was renamed to Elk Horn in 1880 in anticipation of the building of a post office; however, it was not built until 1895 and lasted just two years. The name then reverted to High Bridge. High Bridge began to decline even as early as 1856 when many residents moved to the Midwest. However, the village lasted until the nearby lime mines gave out in the early 1900s. The hotel burned in 1913, and the union church was abandoned in 1925. By 1933, High Bridge had ceased to exist as such.

It contains mangrove trees, which occur in the intertidal zones of estuarine areas and are characterized by its \\"pencil roots\\", which are aerial roots. It is commonly known as api api, which in the Malay language means \\"fires\\", a reference to the fact that fireflies often congregate on these trees.Api-api Putih (Avicennia alba) The Tide Chaser. Retrieved 2012-02-08. Species of Avicennia occur worldwide south of the Tropic of Cancer. The taxonomic placement of Avicennia is contentious. In some classifications, it has been placed in the family Verbenaceae, but more recently has been placed by some botanists in the monogeneric family Avicenniaceae. Recent phylogenetic studies have suggested that Avicennia is derived from within Acanthaceae, and the genus is included in that family in the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group system. Designation of species is made difficult by the great variations in form of Avicennia marina. Between eight and 10 species are usually recognised, with A. marina further divided into a number of subspecies. The generic name honours Persian physician Avicenna (980-1037). Description Members of the genus are among the most salt- tolerant mangroves and are often the first to colonise new deposits of sediment. The sap is salty, and excess salt is secreted through the leaves. The spreading root system provides stability in shifting substrates. Vertical roots called pneumatophores project from the mud, thus the term \\"pencil roots\\". These are used in gas exchange as very little oxygen is available in the mud. The flowers are fragrant and rich in nectar, and are pollinated by insects. The embryos exhibit cryptovivipary, a process where they start to develop before the seed is shed, but do not break through the outside of the fruit capsule.Api Api Mangrove and wetland wildlife at Sungei Buloh Nature Park.

It was driven in by CPR railroad financier Donald Smith, marking the end of a saga of natural disasters, financial crises, and even rebellion that plagued Canada's first transcontinental railroad from its beginning. Donald Alexander Smith drives in the Last Spike Prime Minister John A. Macdonald announcing the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, November 7, 1885. The Last Spike signalled the completion of the CPR, driven through under engineer James Ross, and it remains a symbol of national unity in Canada, though due to the need to build protective snowsheds in Rogers Pass and Kicking Horse Pass in addition to the actual rails and roadbed, through trains did not run until June 1886. At the time, the railway's completion fulfilled an 1871 commitment made by the Canadian federal government to British Columbia that a railroad be built joining the Pacific province to Central Canada. The promise of a transcontinental railway had been a major factor in British Columbia's decision to join the Canadian Confederation. However, successive governments mismanaged the project and by the original deadline of 1881 little of the railway had been completed, resulting in threats of secession by some BC politicians. The work was then assigned to a newly incorporated CPR company, which was allowed an additional ten years to complete the line, and they did it in five. A plaque commemorating the driving of the Last Spike The circumstance of the CPR's last spike ceremony led several spikes to assume the honour of being the \\"last spike\\". Sandra Martin, \\"Legendary railway spike thought lost to history – until now\\", The Globe and Mail, June 22, 2012 In contrast to the ceremonial gold or silver final spikes often used to mark the completion of other major railroads, the CPR's \\"Last Spike\\" was a conventional iron spike identical to the many others used in the construction of the line. A silver spike had been created for the Governor General, Henry Petty- Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne, who was to be present at the ceremony, but he was forced by poor weather to return with the spike to Ottawa, Ontario. The silver spike remained with the Van Horne family until 2012 when they donated it, along with other artifacts, to the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec. The symbolic iron spike driven by Donald Smith was badly bent as he pounded it into the railway tie. Roadmaster Frank Brothers extracted the spike, and it was given to Smith as the \\"last spike\\". Smith had the bent spike straightened and cut several strips of iron from it, which were mounted with diamonds and presented to the wives of some of the party assembled at Craigellachie. This spike was later donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa. It is on long term loan to the Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia where it is displayed as a tribute to the immigrant railway workers who were critical to the railway's construction.Charlotte Gray, The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder, Random House Canada (2004), p. 263 Smith later used another iron spike, usually called \\"the ordinary\\" or \\"fourth spike\\" to provide iron to make symbolic jewelry for the wives of other officials, but he made the strips larger to distinguish these souvenirs from the original brooches. The second last spike, which Smith successfully drove into the tie, was removed from the track shortly after the ceremony to prevent theft by souvenir hunters. A regular spike was inserted in its place. This spike was given to the son of the patent office president at the time, and is still in the family's possession, fashioned into the shape of a carving knife. The now-famous photograph of Donald Alexander Smith driving in \\"The Last Spike\\" was taken by Winnipeg photographer Alexander J. Ross. In popular culture The most notable accounts of the construction and completion of the CPR are Pierre Berton's twin volumes The National Dream and The Last Spike, which together were depicted in the Canadian television docudrama miniseries The National Dream, an eight-part series whose rated audience of three million within Canada set a record for CBC in terms of dramatic programming. Another recollection of this event is the narrative poem entitled Towards the Last Spike by Canadian poet, E. J. Pratt.

His manifesto Letzte Lockerung was an important text of Dadaism. Life Walter Serner was born Walter Eduard Seligmann in Carlsbad (Karlovy Vary), Bohemia (then Austria-Hungary, now Czech Republic). In 1913 he studied law in the Austro-Hungarian capital of Vienna and completed his doctorate in the University of Greifswald. With the outbreak of World War I, he escaped to Switzerland in 1914 and participated in Dada activities in Zürich, Geneva, and Paris until 1920. During World War I he was the editor of the magazines Sirius and Zeltweg and a writer for Die Aktion. In 1921 Serner stayed in Italy with the artist Christian Schad. Beginning in 1923 he began living in various European cities, including Barcelona, Bern, Vienna, Carlsbad, and Prague. From 1925, Serner became the target of anti-Semitism. Serner had been born Jewish and had converted to Catholicism in 1913. His play Posada premiered in Berlin in 1927, but his other planned shows were forbidden. In 1933 Serner's books were banned by the government of Nazi Germany. In 1938 Serner married his partner Dorothea Herz in Prague, where he was working as a private teacher. When war broke out, they had no chance to escape from the occupied country. In 1942 he and his wife were interned in the Theresienstadt concentration camp and three weeks later were moved in the direction of \\"the East\\", where they perished in Riga. Walter Serner's most successful novel Die Tigerin (The Tigress) was made into an English-language feature film by writer/director Karin Howard and released in 1992. At that time the novel was re-published in Germany where Serner's books enjoy a cult following. The film was shot in Berlin and Carlsbad.

Based out of Vancouver, British Columbia, it produces service animation for a wide variety of clients, as well as creating its own properties. Since 2015, the company has been owned by Thunderbird Entertainment. History The studio was founded in March 1999 by Trevor Bentley, Mauro Casalese, Olaf Miller and Rob Davies. Sent back to Vancouver after losing his job at Warner Bros. Animation following the cancellation of Pinky, Elmyra & the Brain, Davies received a phone call from Sunwoo Entertainment's Jae Moh to help produce . Together with former Studio B Productions colleagues Miller and Bentley, as well as animator/character designer Casalese, the four launched Atomic Cartoons to assist in creating the series. Between 2004 and 2008, the company produced Atomic Betty for Teletoon in association with Breakthrough Entertainment and Tele Images Kids. Atomic's first fully original creation, the show's titular heroine served as the studio's mascot for a number of years. In 2010, Miller left to launch his own studio. The following year, Jennifer McCarron was appointed head of production. On July 8, 2015, Atomic Cartoons was acquired by Canadian production company Thunderbird Films. The three founders remain on board. McCarron was named president and chief executive officer in 2016. In December 2018, the company opened a second animation studio in Ottawa, Ontario. Its first project is the Netflix-original The Last Kids on Earth. By June 2020, the Ottawa location is expected to have 130-150 employees. In February 2020, Atomic Cartoons opened its third studio in Los Angeles, California.

Background The first act that Polar Music signed was the Hootenanny Singers featuring Björn Ulvaeus. Polar eventually gained prosperity producing Ulvaeus' next group, international superstars ABBA. As a small Scandinavian company based in Sweden, Polar could not afford to set up operations worldwide and was ABBA's record company only in the Scandinavian countries. Therefore, ABBA's recordings were licensed to different record companies in each country, but usually to companies that had international operations, meaning they could effectively compete with each other to acquire the licenses in more countries if they proved successful in their own. The licenses gave the companies a few allowances to issue certain tracks as singles that Polar had not, or to modify single (and occasionally album) artwork. The licenses were for three years at a time, meaning that between 1989 and 1992, they had all expired. This enabled PolyGram to release Gold: Greatest Hits to major success around the world. Polar Music is currently owned by Universal Music Group whose predecessor company, PolyGram, purchased it in 1989. However, Polar Music International AB legally still exists and ABBA's recordings remain copyrighted to the company. Polar is now ABBA's record label internationally, and the historic Polar vinyl label designs have been used on the group's CD releases since 2004 (usually on deluxe releases of studio albums). The Polar Music Prize, an award for outstanding musical achievement, was created by Stig Anderson, the same year after he sold the label to PolyGram. Polar Music artists Artists signed by Polar Music included ABBA, Alive Feat, Jessie Martins, Lena Andersson, Chana, Crosstalk, Dilba, Emilia, Agnetha Fältskog, Anni-Frid Lyngstad & Linda Ulvaeus, Ted Gärdestad, Gemini, The Hellacopters, The Infinite Mass, Fredrik Kempe, Lambretta, Maarja, Paulo Mendonça, Mr. Vegas Fea Intense, Emma Nilsdotter, Mats Paulson, Pineforest Crunch, Sam (musician), Skintrade, Starr Chukki/infinit, Svenne and Lotta, Joey Tempest, Top-Notch, Harpo, Topaz Sound and Anders Widmark.

The Skirmish of the Berlin Schloss (German: Weihnachtskämpfe or Weihnachtsaufstand i.e. Christmas eve struggle or rebellion ) was a small skirmish between the socialist revolutionary Volksmarinedivision and regular German army units on 24 December 1918 during the German Revolution of 1918–19. It took place around the Berlin Schloss also known as \\"Stadtschloss\\" in the centre of Berlin, Germany. Around 34 people were killed and the event marked the point at which the hitherto largely bloodless revolution turned more violent. The fighting was the immediate cause for the more radical members to leave the revolutionary government and caused resentment among the workers against the Social Democratic government of Friedrich Ebert. This set the scene for the much larger-scale violence of January 1919, known as the Spartacist Uprising. Since the revolutionary sailors defeated the regular army force sent against them, the engagement was also an important episode in the rise of the right-wing Freikorps on which the government increasingly relied. Background On 11 November 1918, the Volksmarinedivision was created, initially numbering several hundred revolutionary naval troops from Kiel who had been arrested on arrival in Berlin but released on 9 November. They were joined by several hundred sailors from Berlin and another 2,000 requested from Kiel on 12 November by Stadtkommandant Otto Wels, the military commander of Berlin. Numbering more than 3,000 at its peak, the division was considered the elite force of the revolution. After the Berliner Stadtschloss, the former city residence of the Hohenzollern family and Emperor Wilhelm II had been plundered, the division was based there on 15 November. The division staff moved into the Schloss, the troops were billeted in the Marstall. Their task was to guard the government quarter. Politically, the division was close to the radical left, the Independent Social Democrats of the USPD and the \\"Spartacists\\". However, having been the backbone of the revolution, over the next four weeks the unit found itself in a significantly different position. It is unclear whether this was due to the fact that it failed to cooperate with the military putsch planned for 6 December and had deposed its commander who was a part of it. Or whether the division was an obstacle to Quartermaster General Wilhelm Groener's plan to restore law and order to Berlin. From the middle of December, Wels seemed to be working towards the dissolution of the unit. There were complaints about art treasures having been stolen from the palace. The temporary government of the Rat der Volksbeauftragten (Council of People's Deputies) now ordered the division to move to new quarters outside of Berlin and to reduce the number of soldiers to 600 from the current level of around 1,000. To force them to comply, Wels held back their pay. During the week before Christmas the division and Wels negotiated in the Kommandantur, but failed to resolve the situation. 23 December 1918 Council of the People's Deputies after 30 December 1918, when the USPD members were replaced. From left: Otto Landsberg, Philipp Scheidemann, Gustav Noske, Friedrich Ebert, Rudolf Wissell. On 23 December, losing patience, the leaders of the division went to the Reichskanzlei (Chancellery). By that point, the government, the six-man \\"Council of People's Deputies\\" that had been in office since 10 November, was on the verge of breaking apart with increasing differences emerging between its USPD and MSPD members. The Volksmarinedivision encountered support from the former but mostly hostility from the latter. The soldiers were ordered to hand over the keys to the Schloss and left. In the afternoon the soldiers' leaders returned, with the keys but also with a group of armed troops that took position in front of the building. According to author Sebastian Haffner what happened then was as follows: The soldiers' leaders under one Lieutenant Heinrich Dorrenbach gave the keys to Emil Barth, a People's Deputy of the USPD. Barth called Wels and told him that he had received the keys and asked him to hand over the outstanding pay. Wels refused, arguing that he only took orders from Friedrich Ebert who was joint chairman of the \\"Council of People's Deputies\\" and had also been handed the authority of government by the last Imperial Chancellor, Maximilian of Baden. When Barth sent the soldiers to Ebert, Ebert refused to see them. On Dorrenbach's orders the troops now closed all access to the Reichskanzlei, occupied the room with the telephone switchboard and cut the lines. The Volksbeauftragten were thus under house arrest. Otto Wels, at the time military commander of Berlin. Some of the soldiers then marched to the Kommandantur where the guards resisted. Three members of the Volksmarinedivision were killed. Otto Wels and two of his officers were abducted, brought to the nearby Marstall and physically abused. The soldiers also took their outstanding pay. In response to the occupation of the Chancellery, Friedrich Ebert used a secret telephone line that did not go through the switchboard to call for help from the Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL), the High Command of the German Army, situated at that time in Kassel. This marked the first time that the Ebert–Groener pact of 10 November between Ebert and General Groener of the OHL was put into action. Ebert talked to Major Kurt von Schleicher, who promised to have loyal troops from the environs of Berlin come to Ebert's help. He also expressed his hope that this would be a chance to \\"finally strike a blow against the radicals\\". Regular troops from Potsdam and Babelsberg were mobilised and marched towards Berlin. They were the last remains of the ten divisions the government and OHL had originally brought to the capital to \\"restore law and order\\" between 10 and 15 December. Numbering just 800 men they nevertheless had some batteries of field artillery whilst the Volksmarinedivision had just side arms and machine guns. There is some uncertainty about what happened during the remaining hours of 23 December; for example, whether the house arrest for the People's Deputies was cancelled. Between 5 and 7 pm there was a cabinet meeting in which Ebert failed to inform the USPD members of the approaching army units. The three USPD members of the Council then left the Chancellery. At some point, the Volksmarinedivision found out about the advancing troops for they also marched towards the Chancellery and got there first. Dorrenbach met Ebert and asked him to remove the army troops. At the same time, the officers of these units arrived in Ebert's office and asked him for his orders and whether they should open fire. Nothing is known about the ensuing conversation, except that Ebert promised to resolve the situation on the next day by a Kabinettsbeschluss (cabinet decision). The result was that both sides pulled back. The Volksmarinedivision returned to the Marstall, the army to the Tiergarten. However, at 2 am Ebert did order the troops to attack the Marstall in the morning. Later, Ebert argued that he had done so to save the life of Wels. However, according to Philipp Scheidemann, another People's Deputy, Wels appeared in the Chancellery at around 3 am, an hour after the order was given but several hours before the attack started. According to a different version, there had been another telephone conversation between Ebert and Groener in which the latter had threatened to end their cooperation unless stern steps were taken against the revolting unit. 24 December 1918 Soldiers of the Volksmarinedivision during the fighting on 24 December in the Pfeilersaal of the Stadtschloss. Shortly before 8 am the army units on the Schlossplatz opened fire with their artillery. Although accounts of the actual fighting are confused and contradictory, it was a victory for the Volksmarinedivision. The initial barrage of machine gun and artillery fire from several sides was without serious effects, except for significant damage to the buildings. In the first hour of fighting, around 60 shells hit the Stadtschloss and the Marstall. Between 9 and 10 am masses of unarmed civilians, including women and children, gathered and urged the army troops to stop fighting. At around 10 am, there was a pause in the fighting to allow the women and children to be removed from the vicinity of the fighting. At 10:30, the fight resumed with increased ferocity and the Volksmarinedivision now was on the offensive. According to reports, some government troops switched sides. In addition, the Sicherheitswehr, part of the Berlin police force commanded by Emil Eichhorn of the USPD, as well as armed and unarmed civilians joined the division and opposed the regular troops. Around noon, the skirmish ended. The army troops promised to leave and were offered a chance to withdraw. The Volksmarinedivision held the field but agreed to return to their quarters. Since both sides took their dead and wounded with them there were no independent estimates of casualties. But according to reports, the regular troops suffered 23 dead and 35 wounded against just 11 dead and 23 wounded from the Volksmarinedivision. Consequences Friedrich Ebert in 1925. Freikorps supporting the Kapp Putsch in March 1920, at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. As a direct result of the confrontation, which was seen as a political defeat for Ebert, Wels had to resign his post as commander of the city's forces (Stadtkommandant). The division had to leave the Schloss and the Marstall but was not dissolved. Their demands for pay had to be satisfied and the reduction in size was postponed. A more important consequence of this event, which the Spartacist leader Karl Liebknecht called \\"Eberts Blutweihnacht\\" (\\"Ebert's Bloody Christmas\\"), was that the USPD members left the Rat der Volksbeauftragten on 29 December. The next day, SPD members Gustav Noske and Rudolf Wissell took their place. That same day, the Spartacists severed their remaining links with the USPD and set themselves up as the new Kommunistische Partei (KPD). They were joined by some USPD members from Hamburg and Bremen. Thus the more radical elements had been pushed out of the revolutionary government. Rather than working inside it alongside the \\"Majority\\" SPD members, the USPD now joined the Spartacists in opposition to the SPD. None of those who had really wanted the revolution were still in power. Moreover, the radical left was deeply divided and there was no sign of a Lenin-type leader emerging. However, when the fallen members of the Volksmarinedivision were buried in Friedrichshain thousands of embittered people attended the funeral. They carried placards saying: \\"Als Matrosenmörder klagen wir an: Ebert, Landsberg und Scheidemann\\" (Charged as murderers of sailors: Ebert, Landsberg and Scheidemann) and shouted \\"Down with the traitors!\\". This foreshadowed the events of January 1919. When Emil Eichhorn refused to accept his dismissal as president of the Berlin police—resulting not least from his support for the revolting sailors—the people took to the streets en masse in his support. This would lead to what has become known as the Spartakusaufstand or Spartakuswoche, but is more accurately referred to as the Januaraufstand (\\"January Uprising\\"), since it was mostly an attempt by the revolutionary workers of Berlin to repeat their feat of 9 November and to regain what they had won then and subsequently half lost. The renewed failure of regular troops—after the disintegration of the forces assembled in Berlin for the planned restoration of order on 10 to 15 December—also gave support to those within the military who argued in favour of increased reliance on hard- core volunteer troops. Since the middle of November, the OHL had supported the creation by some officers of so-called Freikorps, voluntary units of soldiers who were mostly nationalistic, monarchistic and anti-revolution, even while the demobilisation of the regular (conscripted) army was ongoing. As a result of the Weihnachtskämpfe, the government—in particular Noske—now joined the OHL in these efforts. These new military forces were intended both to secure the eastern border (e.g. in Posen) and protect the newly formed Baltic states against the Red Army, but also to restore law and order within the Reich.

Targeting consumers aged 7–14, the concept is designed as the children's version of its parent company A&F.; There are 122 full-price abercrombie kids stores in the US, Canada, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom; including standalone retail stores and \\"carve-outs\\" in larger Abercrombie & Fitch locations. History Abercrombie & Fitch introduced \\"abercrombie\\" in 1998 with 9 stores. The purpose was to attract a younger audience to the adult Abercrombie brand. The name of the concept took the same font of its parent, but with a navy color. The abbreviation from \\"Abercrombie & Fitch\\" to \\"abercrombie\\" with lowercase letters was intended to provide a children's image. The store prototype was as the A&F; one, but with variations also intended to appeal to the younger audience. Early abercrombie models include Ronnie Smith, Cassie Ventura, Christina Akatsuka, Christian Valentin, Lindsay Lohan, and model Karlie Kloss. Stores and expansion King of Prussia mall in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania Abercrombie kids stores are designed to give off a \\"classic cool\\" effect. They are designed as \\"canoe stores,\\" displaying a similar floor layout as Abercrombie & Fitch's (the retail space is divided into multiple rooms). However, the kids prototype does bear differences. It has no louvers to cover the windows, has brighter lighting, is smaller in retail space, blasts electronic dance music and pop music from young artists, and displays marketing pictures with young models resembling those at A&F.; The signature fragrance, \\"Clutch\\", is sprayed store-wide. On girls' clothing the \\"Hadley\\" perfume is sprayed. As of August 2012, abercrombie operates a total of 154 stores in the United States. The Abercrombie Kids brand began its international expansion when it opened its first Canadian store on August 21, 2008, at Sherway Gardens in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Another abercrombie kids store opened at Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto on November 26, 2008.Toronto Eaton Centre - Coming soon It opened its first flagship store in Milan on October 29, 2009. It is located within the Abercrombie & Fitch Milanese flagship at 12 Corso Matteotti. The practice of placing abercrombie kids stores inside Abercrombie & Fitch flagships store continued in Düsseldorf and Munich stores. There was one in the West Edmonton Mall, but it relocated inside the mall's Abercrombie & Fitch while the old location was replaced with a Microsoft Store. As of May 2015, there are 101 standalone Abercrombie Kids stores in the United States, two in Canada, and one in the United Kingdom. Abercrombie Kids \\"carve-outs\\" occupy space in Abercrombie & Fitch's flagship stores in Italy and Germany, as well as in fourteen full-line Abercrombie & Fitch stores in the United States and Canada. The abercrombie kids \\"carve out\\" locations are an initial attempt for Abercrombie & Fitch to phase out the brand, similar to how Gilly Hicks items were placed in Hollister Co. stores shortly before Gilly Hicks folded in 2013. Abercrombie kids goods Abercrombie kids' apparel is designed to mimic Abercrombie & Fitch clothing, and the brand carries most the styles that A&F; does. Most abercrombie kids clothes that have the labeled moose on them are to resemble their parent company \\"Abercrombie & Fitch\\" but the kids signature moose is smaller to symbolize that they are children. The trademarked term, \\"classic cool\\", was used to promote the clothing on an in-store and website level from abercrombie and it acted as a more juvenile version of A&F;'s slogan \\"Casual Luxury\\". The \\"classic cool\\" trade mark was retired in 2007 along with Abercrombie and Fitch's \\"Casual Luxury\\". Jeans bear the same back-pocket-stitching pattern as A&F; as well as the same fits respective to sex. The logo moose is prominently displayed on clothing as is the name \\"abercrombie\\" as well as the year of establishment, \\"1892\\" (Abercrombie & Fitch was itself established in 1892, but in reality, the children's line \\"abercrombie\\" was not started until 1998). Clothing is categorized within the \\"guys\\" and \\"girls\\" divisions. Price points are on par with those at sister brand Hollister Co. The brand currently carries the following fragrance collections: \\"Clutch\\" cologne and \\"Abercrombie Cool\\" cologne well as \\"a&f;\\" and \\"Hadley\\" perfumes. The brand released the \\"abercrombie\\" cologne and perfume set previous to 2006; however, it was retired Christmas 2007. Chase and Spirit were released Christmas 2006 and were followed by Cologne 15 and Perfume 15 being released Christmas 2007. Chase and Spirit have begun the phasing-out process and have had their price reduced permanently, as of Fall 2010. New fragrance Phelps and Emerson were released for Christmas 2008. On July 9, 2010, the newest girl's fragrance was launched called \\"Hadley\\", while the newest guy's fragrance, \\"Clutch,\\" was released as part of the Christmas floor-set 2010, and has a scent similar to that of \\"Fierce,\\" although more age appropriate and subdued. Controversy =Sexually suggestive designs= Humor T-shirts from the brand have resulted in criticism and controversy. Many slogans are taken as degrading to girls (e.g. \\"I'm not allowed to date unless you're hot\\"). Some show arrogant messages or disrespectful slogans (\\"'I will make you an all-star on the walk of shame'\\"). They are anti-education slogans as well: 'I'd do your homework, but I don't even do mine'; 'School is for catching up on sleep'. Girls' shirts are sold with slogans that typically show off their looks (\\"It's better being brunette\\", etc.).

Bloch was raised in Berkeley, California, as well as Layton, Utah, and is related to Christopher Layton, a prominent 19th Century Mormon pioneer. Career Bloch has issued several notable collections, with his 2010 release Dictaphones Vol. 1 garnering 5/5 stars in UNCUT, the magazine calling Bloch an \\"exceptional songwriter\\" and the release \\"utterly remarkable\\", as well as frequent radio play on BBC stations when it was issued on One Little Indian records. London's The Sun called the record \\"...fresh, vital, uncluttered and brilliant\\" and awarded it 4.5/5 stars. The subsequent digital EP, \\"Dorothy,\\" included some studio versions of songs on Dictaphones Vol. 1 and received UK-wide acclaim when it was selected by The London Times as \\"Hot Download of the Week\\" and its eponymous single was championed by Dermot O'Leary, Gideon Coe and several other mainstream BBC DJs. In 2000, Bloch wrote and recorded the occult Milla Jovovich, The People Tree Sessions, for his internet imprint Peopletree, an early example of internet marketing. The largely field recorded release was chosen as the \\"Pop CD of the Week\\" and given 4/5 stars by the newspaper The Guardian, which stated that the record was \\"so barking, it's great\\". In the late 1990s, Bloch co-founded the experimental jamming band Banyan with Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins, Minutemen bassist Mike Watt, Beastie Boys' keyboardist Money Mark and Wilco guitarist Nels Cline and co-produced Banyan, the band's first release for Higher Octave with Perkins and The Dust Brothers.

It is located on the Uhlandshöhe in Stuttgart, Germany. Public tours have been held since 1920 and the observatory claims to be one of the oldest in Germany.  History  On the Initiative of the astronomer and author Robert Henseling, the astronomic association Schwäbische Sternwarte e.V. was founded in 1919. The purposes for the newfound association were, and still are, to spread and explain astronomical knowledge to a broad public and to provide support for the Planetarium Stuttgart. To gather enough monetary funds for the construction of the Observatory at the site it still is today, even such famous guest speakers as Albert Einstein followed the invitation to give a speech about astronomy and donate the revenue to the Schwäbische Sternwarte e.V.. The construction of the observatory, designed by Wilhelm Jost, took place in 1921. Already in early January 1922 the association started operations at the new observatory. During World War II, all activities at the observatory were suspended, only to be resumed in September 1947.  Instruments  The observatory is equipped with six telescopes, four of which are permanently mounted. The two others may be assembled if necessary. Inside the bigger of the observatory's two astrodomes, the oldest of the six telescopes is attached to a mount reaching down to the bottom of the tower. This device is a 7-inch Zeiss telescope with 2.59-metre focal-length from 1911, one of the last still existent. Another 7-inch refractor of newer design, a special H-alpha telescope and a 16-inch Newtonian telescope are located in separate sheds on the terrace between the two astrodomes. The latter telescope is frequently used by the members of the association for their scientific research – predominantly the observation of star occultations by minor planets. The results are sent to a Japanese institute. For observations made by the Stuttgart Observatory concerning occultations, the observatory code given by the Minor Planet Center is 025.

It was also known as The Great Swamp or The Marsh. Geographical description The Batihah was an area in which, at the time, both the Tigris and the Euphrates discharged their waters. In its broadest sense, it covered an area approximately fifty miles across and almost two hundred miles in length, lying between Wasit and Basra. The Batihah was a marshland. It was composed of many reeds, which in certain areas gave way to open lagoons. The reeds made the marsh very difficult for enemies to travel through; only small boats that were driven by poles could navigate the area. Because of this, the Batihah was almost invulnerable to attack and its inhabitants were able to maintain their independence for the better part of a century. History of the Great Swamp ='Imran= The Batihah state was founded by a criminal named 'Imran ibn Shahin. He took advantage of the declining authority of the Abbasid Caliphate to establish a state in the marshlands. He steadily expanded his power by drawing other criminals and local fishermen to his side. From 945 onwards the Buyids were established in Baghdad, and thereafter attempted to take over the Batihah. 'Imran successfully resisted the Buyids for several decades, and proved to be a thorn in the side of the Buyid state. He and his successors were titled amirs, and were recognized by the Buyids as the legitimate rulers of the Batihah. ='Imran's successors= 'Imran died in the summer of 979, and was succeeded by his son Hasan. The Buyid amir 'Adud al-Dawla decided to use this as an opportunity to subjugate the Batihah. The army was commanded by the amir's vizier, Mutahhar. He attempted to dam the waterways, and create a raised road to allow his troops to approach Hasan's fortress on foot. The campaign cost a large amount of money, and it effectively stopped any trade boats from travelling the Tigris. Hasan, like his father, managed to stop Mutahhar by breaching the dams. The vizier tried to draw him out into open battle, but was unsuccessful. His failure in the campaign, as well as his fear of 'Adud al- Dawla's wrath, eventually caused Mutahhar to commit suicide. 'Adud therefore called for an end to fighting, and all he gained was a money payment from Hasan. Shortly after this, Hasan's brother Muhammad succeeded him. In 983 or 984, Muhammad was killed, bringing an end to the power of 'Imran's family. The man responsible for his murder, the chamberlain Muzaffar ibn 'Ali, then assumed power. He died in 986 and was succeeded by his sister's son Abu 'l-Hasan 'Ali ibn Nasr. During this time, the Batihah rulers maintained good relations with the Buyids; neither 'Adud al-Dawla or his successor Samsam al- Dawla (983) launched any further expeditions against the swamp. =Muhadhdhib al-Dawla= Abu'l-Hasan kept the relations with the Buyids on good terms. During his reign, the Batihah again became a refuge for criminals and political refugees, including the caliph al-Qadir (r. 991–1031). Sharaf al- Dawla, who had seized Iraq from Samsam al-Dawla in 987, conferred on Abu 'l-Hasan the honorific title (laqab) of Muhadhdhib al-Dawla. Sharaf's death in 988 or 989 threw the Buyid state into chaos. The new Buyid amir, Baha' al- Dawla, in his struggles with Samsam al-Dawla, asked Muhadhdhib al-Dawla for loans several times, and also created arranged for an alliance through marriage between the two sides. At one point, he even gave the Batihah ruler control of Lower Wasit, in exchange for an annual tribute of 1.3 million dirhams. As a result of the fighting, one of 'Izz al-Dawla's sons, Abu Nasr, ended up taking refuge in the Batihah. In 1003 or 1004, Muhadhdhib al-Dawla sent a soldier of fortune named Abu 'l-'Abbas ibn Wasil to wrest Basra from Lashkaristan, who after taking the city had refused to recognize Baha' al- Dawla as his sole overlord. Abu 'l-'Abbas completed his task successfully, but then marched back and conquered the Batihah. Muhadhdhib al-Dawla was forced to flee to Baghdad, and only after Baha' al-Dawla sent several expeditions in support of him was he able to return to the swamp (in 1006 or 1007). Baha' al- Dawla died in 1012 and was succeeded by Sultan al-Dawla. In around 1017, the Buyid ruler of Kerman, Abu'l-Fawaris, entered into a struggle with Sultan and asked Muhadhdhib al-Dawla for assistance. Around the same time (1017 or 1018), Muhadhdhib al-Dawla died. =End of the Batihah state= Muhadhdhib al-Dawla was succeeded by al-Sharabi. Soon afterwards, the military junta that effectively controlled Sultan al-Dawla's government demanded that al-Sharabi turn over Ibn Sahlan, a former Buyid governor of Iraq who had fled to the Batihah. Al-Sharabi, keeping in mind the Batihah's tradition of not turning over fugitives, refused, whereupon the junta convinced Sultan al-Dawla to send an expedition to the swamp. Al-Sharabi was captured and the Batihah was finally conquered by the Buyids, bringing an end to the state. References * *Kabir, Mafizullah. The Buwayhid Dynasty of Baghdad (946-1055).

Bento was best known for his 20-year spell at Benfica, having retired well into his 40s after appearing in nearly 650 official games. He represented Portugal at Euro 1984 and the 1986 World Cup, helping the national team reach the semi-finals in the former tournament. Chosen by Portuguese sports newspaper Record as one of the best 100 Portuguese footballers, Bento won the Goalkeeper of the Year award a best- ever eight times. In January 2015, he was chosen by the UEFA website as one of Europe's favourite goalkeepers. Club career Bento was born in Golegã, Santarém District. After various youth spells, including one with Sporting CP, he started professionally at F.C. Barreirense, being transferred to S.L. Benfica for the 1972–73 season. Bento started with Benfica as a backup to another Portuguese keeper, José Henrique. After three years in an interesting battle for first-choice status, the former gained the starting position in 1976 at age 28, and proceeded to amass 636 overall appearances for the Lisbon side. Bento suffered a severe injury in the 1986 summer on international duty, from which he never recovered fully. He spent the next six years mainly as third-string, behind Silvino and Neno, being on the bench at both the 1988 and 1990 European Cup finals, lost to PSV Eindhoven and A.C. Milan respectively; the last game of his career came at the end of the 1989–90 campaign against C.F. Os Belenenses, in which he was chosen Man of the match. In the summer of 1989 he played in the National Soccer League with Toronto First Portuguese. In June 1992, aged 44, Bento retired from football after exactly 20 years at Benfica – he was the oldest footballer ever to appear in the Portuguese first division. Subsequently, he began working as a goalkeeper coach, always with his main club. Bento died in the hospital of Barreiro on 1 March 2007, after suffering a heart attack. He was 58 years old. International career Bento earned 63 caps for Portugal, over the course of one decade. He made his debut on 16 October 1976 in the 1978 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign's opener, a 0–2 defeat against Poland in Porto. Bento remained first-choice for the following nine years, being between the posts as the national team reached the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 1984, excelling in the 2–3 loss against the hosts France. He also started in the epic 1–0 win in West Germany for the 1986 World Cup qualifiers, being subsequently picked for the final stages in Mexico at age 38: he appeared in the first game against England (another single-goal success), then broke his fibula in training, being replaced for the remainder of the tournament by Sporting's Vítor Damas; Portugal lost the next two matches and were eliminated from the knockout stages.

Learner is a famous publisher, mostly of pornography, but also of the books of the fictional horror writer Garth Marenghi (played by Matthew Holness). Ayoade first played Learner in the Edinburgh Fringe stage shows Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight and Garth Marenghi's Netherhead in 2000 and 2001 respectively. In 2004 he appeared in Channel 4's spoof horror comedy Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, and in 2006 in his own TV show, Man to Man with Dean Learner, which aired on Channel 4 from October 2006. It was recorded in Teddington Studios in April–May 2006 in front of a live audience and featured Learner interviewing celebrity guests – all of whom happen to be his clients (and played by Ayoade's writing partner Matthew Holness) – including Marenghi. Character The character is Garth Marenghi's publisher, and regards Marenghi and his (highly dubious) talents with a respect that sometimes borders on worship (he has been known to assault small children for criticising Marenghi's writing). No matter how tatty or ridiculous Marenghi's output is, Learner is forever in awe of Marenghi's gifts. Marenghi, of course, accepts Learner's praise without question, although he doesn't seem to have any great fondness for Learner in return. A more famous quote from one of the episodes sees Learner praise Marenghi's talents: \\"Garth is the most significant artist I've ever worked with and I've worked with Lulu and four other people. So, er, we're talking creme de la creme.\\" Learner's attempts to first sell Darkplace were fruitless; he took the reels of 60 episodes of the show to Channel 4, whom he expected to take the footage and air it, no questions asked. However the Channel told him they did not ask him to make the show, which Learner had no idea they needed to do. Eventually the show enjoyed a brief stint in Peru, with Learner declaring: \\"Thank God for the Peruvian market!\\" In the Garth Marenghi's Darkplace show within the show, Learner plays Thornton Reed, a camp hospital administrator who bears a trademark shotgun and cigar and answers to Hospital boss \\"Won Ton.\\" He is known in this respect for his brilliant but sometimes pathetic attempts at comedy, one of them being \\"If Won Ton hears about this my arse is grass, and he's got a lawnmower!\\" (from Darkplace episode 4). This was not Learner and Marenghi's first major creative collaboration. Learner directed the seventies film adaptation of Marenghi's novel Bitch Killer, and also appears as Reed in Marenghi's 2006 movie, War of the Wasps. Clips of both projects were shown on Learner's chat show. Apart from publishing Marenghi's books, appearing in Marenghi's TV shows and films and publishing various gentlemen's titles, Learner also has many other side projects, including the running of the Formula Five motor racing team \\"The Dean Team\\", with whom Steve Pising won four world titles. After leaving The Dean Team, Pising suffered a major crash in his first race with his new team, a crash which may or may not have been caused by Learner. After several years, Pising worked with Learner again on a new TV show, \\"The Learner\\", where they held auditions for a new job at Pising Parts, now owned by Learner. Dean has also released his own autobiography, \\"I Have A Dean\\", which has now been reduced to the special low price of £90. Ayoade plays Learner as a very sleazy and underhand person. He is seemingly without emotion or ability to empathize with other people, perhaps a reason for his poor acting skills. For example, in the Darkplace special features, when asked what happened to \\"Ahmed\\", the original financial backer of Darkplace, Learner says: \\"Ahmed very sadly died. He was shot dead in his flat.\\" and looks very conspicuously away from the camera. In another interview he also says that when Marenghi joined another Manager in the '80s, the manager very quickly died and Garth returned to Learner. It is also implied he knows something about the disappearance of Darkplace co-star Madeleine Wool who played Liz Asher. He also makes reference to an incident in which he punches one of the child actors in the head. Although Dean seems to be genuinely friendly with Garth and, to a lesser extent, character actor Todd Rivers (played by Matt Berry), his relationship with other clients, colleagues and business associates of his (such as Steve Pising and folk singer Merriman Weir) are shown in Man to Man as being somewhat colder and more manipulative, culminating in the final episode of the series in which Dean and his cadre are shown as being primarily responsible for the woes of widely hated actor Randolph Caer. Sexuality Despite Learner's camp dress sense, he denies being homosexual. He has also been involved in pornography, including Channel Ladykiss.

His reign was marked by decades of struggle against the Buyids of Iraq.  Life  'Imran created the marsh state during the period of the declining authority of the Caliphate. Having committed a crime in Jamidah, 'Imran fled to the neighboring swamps to avoid punishment by the local government. From there he managed to gain the cooperation of fellow criminals and local fisherman, and was able to set up a robber state, defying government authority. He managed to expand his power when the Biridis of Basra charged him with the protection of Jamidah and the parts of Ahvaz lying within the Batihah. With more followers flocking to him, 'Imran was eventually able to take control of the whole swamp. The Buyids' entrance into Baghdad in 945 meant that conflict between the two sides was inevitable. The Buyid amir Mu'izz al-Daula sent his deputy Abu Ja'far al- Saymari to subdue the Batihah. He managed to inflict a series of defeats upon 'Imran, who fled and whose family was imprisoned. The death of Mu'izz's overlord 'Imad al-Daula in late 949, however, forced Mu'izz to send al-Saymari to Fars in order to secure the succession of 'Imad's son 'Adud al-Daula, giving 'Imran the opportunity to recover his authority. Shortly afterwards, Mu'izz al-Daula sent another expedition against the Batihah. This campaign, led by a Daylamite officer named Ruzbahan, ended badly. Ruzbahan discovered 'Imran's location and attacked him, but was heavily defeated and forced to withdraw. 'Imran then became even more bold, with his subjects demanding protection money from anyone, including government officials, that crossed their path, and the path to Basra by water was effectively closed off. Mu'izz al-Daula, after receiving numerous complaints from his officers, sent another army in 950 or 951, under the joint command of Ruzbahan and the amir's vizier al-Muhallabi. Ruzbahan, who disliked the vizier, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the vizier's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Daula then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah. Peace lasted for approximately five years between the two sides. A false rumor of Mu'izz al-Daula's death in 955, however, prompted 'Imran to seize a Buyid convoy traveling from Ahvaz to Baghdad. Mu'izz demanded that the items confiscated be returned, at which point 'Imran returned the money gained, but kept the goods taken. The Buyid sent Ruzbahan a third time to the swamp, but the latter revolted and 'Imran was spared from a new attack. He remained secure for twelve years; only in 967 was another campaign launched against him. Mu'izz al-Daula oversaw the expedition himself, but he became sick and ultimately died, preventing any progress from being made. His son and successor, 'Izz al-Daula, quickly sent the Turkish general Sebük-Tegin to make peace with him. War between the two sides resumed in the summer 971, when 'Izz al-Daula's vizier Abu'l-Fadl suggested carrying out an attack against the Batihah in an effort to plunder the robber-state and relieve the Buyids' financial troubles. He dammed all the waterways leading into the marshes in order to destroy 'Imran's advantage, and built a dyke that allowed his troops to march up to 'Imram's capital fortress. 'Imran, however, sent his men out when the waters rose to destroy the dams, and if they could not do that he would simply move himself to another location in the marshes. As a result of the slow progress of the campaign, the Buyid troops lost morale and became mutinous. This, coupled with an invasion by the Byzantine Empire, forced 'Izz al-Daula to make peace with 'Imran. The latter greatly benefited from the terms, without any obligation for tribute. Internal struggles within the Buyid state enabled 'Imran to enhance his position. Having lost control of northern Iraq to the Turks, 'Izz al-Daula in 974 requested 'Imran's help. He sent him robes of honor, with a title Mu'in al- Daula and asked for military support, as well as his daughter's hand in marriage. 'Imran refused both proposals. In 975 'Adud al-Daula, who had come from Fars to help 'Izz al-Daula, ended up taking power for himself. 'Imran requested and received from him a formal grant for the rule of the Batihah. When 'Izz al-Daula's vizier, Ibn Baqiyya, revolted against 'Adud, 'Imran gave support to him. 'Izz temporarily regained control of Iraq, and continued to seek 'Imran's help, but to no avail. 'Adud al-Daula defeated his cousin and took over the region for good in 977, and 'Imran maintained peace with him. 'Imran died in the summer of 979 and was succeeded by his son Hasan.

In England this dates from the latter part of the 17th century, when in most cases the names of the auctioneers were suppressed. In June 1693, John Evelyn mentions a \\"great auction of pictures (Lord Melfort's) in the Banqueting House, Whitehall\\", and the practice is frequently referred to by other contemporary and later writers. Normally, an auction catalog, that lists the art works to be sold, is written and made available well before the auction date. Some of the best known auction houses are Christie's and Sotheby's. The oldest auction house is Stockholm Auction House (Stockholms Auktionsverk). It was established in Sweden in 1674.  History  = Early days = Before the introduction of regular auctions the practice was, as in the case of the famous collection formed by Charles I, to price each object and invite purchasers, just as in other departments of commerce. But this was a slow process, especially in the case of pictures, and lacked the incentive of excitement. The first really important art collection to come under the hammer was that of Edward, Earl of Oxford, dispersed by Cock, under the Piazza, Covent Garden, on 8 March 1742 and the five following days, six more days being required by the coins. Nearly all the leading men of the day, including Horace Walpole, attended or were represented at this sale, and the prices varied from five shillings for an anonymous bishop's \\"head\\" to 165 guineas (gns.) for van Dyck's group of Sir Kenelm Digby, lady, and son. Auction Room, Christie's, circa 1808. The next great dispersal was Dr Richard Mead's extensive collection, of which the pictures, coins and engraved gems, &c.;, were sold by Abraham Langford in February and March 1754, the sale realizing the total, unprecedented up to that time, of The thirty-eight days' sale (1786) of the Duchess of Portland's collection is noteworthy, from the fact that it included the celebrated Portland vase, now in the British Museum. Many other interesting and important 18th centurysales might be mentioned. High prices did not become general until the Calonne, John Trumbull (both 1795) and Bryan (1798) sales. As to the quality of the pictures which had been sold by auction up to the latter part of the 18th century, it may be assumed that this was not high. The importation of pictures and other objects of art had assumed extensive proportions by the end of the 18th century, but the genuine examples of the Old Masters probably fell far short of 1%. England was felt to be the only safe asylum for valuable articles, but the home which was intended to be temporary often became permanent. Had it not been for the political convulsions on the continent, England, instead of being one of the richest countries in the world in art treasures, would have been one of the poorest. This fortuitous circumstance had, moreover, another effect, in that it greatly raised the critical knowledge of pictures. Genuine works realized high prices, as, for example, at Sir William Hamilton's sale (1801), when Beckford paid 1,300 gns. for the little picture of A Laughing Boy by Leonardo da Vinci; and when at the Lafontaine sales (1807 and 1811) two Rembrandts each realized 5,000 gns., The Woman taken in Adultery, now in the National Gallery, and The Master Shipbuilder, now at Buckingham Palace. The Beckford sale of 1823 (41 days, ) was the forerunner of the great art dispersal of the 19th century; Horace Walpole's accumulation at Strawberry Hill, 1842 (24 days, ), and the Stowe collection, 1848 (41 days, ), were also celebrated. They comprised every phase of art work, and in all the quality was of a very high order. They acted as a most healthy stimulus to art collecting, a stimulus which was further nourished by the sales of the superb collection of Ralph Bernal in 1855 (32 days, ), and of the almost equally fine but not so comprehensive collection of Samuel Rogers, 1856 (18 days, ). Three years later came the dispersal of the 1,500 pictures which formed Lord Northwick's gallery at Cheltenham (pictures and works of art, 18 days, ). = Mid-19th century = Towards the latter part of the first half of the 19th century an entirely new type of collectors gradually came into existence; they were for the most part men who had made, or were making, large fortunes in the various industries of the midlands and north of England and other centres. They were not hampered by \\"collecting\\" traditions, and their patronage was almost exclusively extended to the artists of the day. The dispersal of these collections began in 1863 with the Bicknell Gallery, and continued at irregular intervals for many years, e.g. Joseph Gillott (1872), Sam Mendel (1875), Wynne Ellis and Albert Levy (1876), Albert Grant (1877) and Munro of Novar (1878). These patrons purchased at munificent prices either direct from the easel or from the exhibitions not only pictures in oils but also water-colour drawings. As a matter of investment their purchases frequently realized far more than the original outlay; sometimes, however, the reverse happened, as, for instance, in the case of Landseer's Otter Hunt, for which Baron Grant is said to have paid and which realized shortly afterwards only 5,650 gns. One of the features of the sales of the 1870s was the high appreciation of water-colour drawings. At the Gillott sale (1872) 160 examples realized J. M. W. Turner's Bamburgh Castle fetching 3150 gns.; at the Quilter sale (1875) David Cox's The Hayfield, for which a dealer paid him 50 gns. in 1850, brought 259 gns. The following are the most remarkable prices of later years. In 1895 Cox's Welsh Funeral (which cost about ) sold for 2,400 gns., and Burne-Jones's Hesperides for 2460 gns. In 1908, 14 Turner drawings fetched (Acland-Hood sale) and 7 brought (Holland sale), the \\"Heidelberg\\" reaching 4,200 gns. For Frederick Walker's Harbour of Refuge 2,580 gns. were paid (Tatham sale) and 2,700 gns. for his Marlow Ferry (Holland). The demand for pictures by modern artists, whose works sold at almost fabulous prices in the 1870s, had somewhat declined by the early 20th century; but during all its furore there was still a small band of collectors to whom the works of the Old Masters more especially appealed. The dispersal of such collections as the Bredel (1875), Watts Russell (1875), Foster of Clewer Manor (1876), the Hamilton Palace (17 days, )—one of the greatest art sales in the annals of Great Britain—Bale (1881), Leigh Court (1884), and Dudley (1892) resulted, as did the sale of many minor collections each season, in many very fine works of the Old Masters finding eager purchasers at high prices. A striking example of the high prices given was the realized by the pair of Vandyck portraits of a Genoese senator and his wife in the Peel sale, 1900. = Late 19th to early 20th centuries = In the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th, the chief feature in art sales was the demand for works, particularly female portraits, by Reynolds, his contemporaries and successors. This may be traced to the South Kensington Exhibitions of 1867 and 1868 and the annual winter exhibitions at Burlington House, which revealed an unsuspected wealth and charm in the works of many English artists who had almost fallen into oblivion. A few of the most remarkable prices for such pictures may be quoted: *Reynolds's Lady Betty Delmé (1894), 11,000 gns.; *Romney's The Ladies Spencer (1896), 10,500 gns.; *Gainsborough's Duchess of Devonshire (1876), 10,100 gns. (for the history of its disappearance see Georgiana Cavendish), Maria Walpole, 12,100 gns. (Duke of Cambridge's sale, 1904); *Constable's Stratford Mill (1895), 8,500 gns.; *Hoppner's Lady Waldegrave (1906), 6,000 gns.; *Thomas Lawrence's Childhood's Innocence (1907), 8,000 gns.; *Henry Raeburn's Lady Raeburn (1905), 85,00 gns. *Turner's Mortlake Terrace (1908 Holland sale). 12,600 gns. Between 1880 and the end of first decade of the 20th century the \\"appreciation\\" of the then modern continental schools, particularly the French, was considerbal; of high prices paid may be mentioned: *Corot's Danse des Amours (1898), ; *Rosa Bonheur's Denizens of the Highlands (1888), 5,550 gns.; *Jules Breton's First Communion, in New York City (1886); *Meissonier's Napoleon I. in the Campaign of Paris, 12¼in. by 9¼in. (1882), 5,800 gns., *The Sign Painter (1891), 6,450 gns. High prices were also fetched by pictures of Daubigny, Marià Fortuny, Louis Gallait, Gérôme, Constant Troyon and Jozef Israëls. The most marked feature of the Edwardian art market was the demand for the 18th century painters Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard, Pater and Lancret; thus La Ronde Champêtre of the last named brought at the Say Sale in 1908, and Natoire's Le Reveil de Vénus at the Sedelmeyer sale, 1907. \\"Specialism\\" is the one important development in art collecting which has manifested itself between the middle of the 19th century and the Edwardian period. This explained the high average quality of the Wellesley (1866), the Buccleuch (1888) and the Holford (1893) collections of drawings by the Old Masters; for the Sibson Wedgwood (1877), the Duc de Forli Dresden Porcelain (1877), the Shuldham blue and white porcelain (1880), the Benson collection of antique coins (1909), and for the objects of art at the Massey-Mainwaring sale of 1904,Catalog of items sold at the 1904 Massey-Mainwaring sale and the Lewis-Hill sale of 1907. Very many other illustrations in nearly every department of art collecting might be quoted—the superb series of Marlborough gems (1875 and 1899) might be included in this category but for the fact that it was formed chiefly in the 18th century. The appreciation—commercially at all events—of mezzotint portraits and of portraits printed in colours, after masters of the early English school, was one of the most remarkable features in art sales during the last years of the 19th century. The shillings of fifty years before were then represented by pounds. The Fraser collection (December 4 to 6, 1900) realized about ten times the original outlay, the mezzotint of the Sisters Frankland, after Hoppner, by W. Ward, selling for 290 gns. as against 10 gns. paid for it about thirty years previously. The H. A. Blyth sale (March 11 to 13, 1901, 346 lots, : 10s.) of mezzotint portraits was even more remarkable, and as a collection it was the choicest sold in the first decade of the 20th century, the engravings being mostly in the first state. The record prices were numerous, and, in many cases, far surpassed the prices which Sir Joshua Reynolds received for the original pictures; e.g. the exceptionally fine example of the first state of the Duchess of Rutland, after Reynolds, by V. Green, realized 1,000 gns., whereas the artist received only for the painting itself. Even this unprecedented price for a mezzotint portrait was exceeded on the 30 April 1901, when an example of the first published state of Mrs Carnac, after Reynolds, by J. R. Smith, sold for 1,160 gns. At the Louis Huth sale (1905) 83 lots brought nearly Reynolds's Lady Bampfylde by T. Watson, first state before letters, unpublished, fetching 1,200 gns. Such prices as these and many others which might be quoted are exceptional, but they were paid for objects of exceptional rarity or quality. The Holland sale, in June 1908, realized (432 lots), a \\"record\\" sum for a collection of pictures mainly by modern artists; and that for the Rodolphe Kann collection (Paris) of pictures and objects of art, including 11 magnificent Rembrandts, Messrs Duveen paid in 1907. In every direction there has been a tendency to increase prices for really great artistic pieces, even to a sensational extent. The competition has become acute, largely owing to American and German acquisitiveness. By 1911 the demand for the finest works of art of all descriptions was much greater than the supply. By the early 20th century the turnover of one London firm alone had occasionally exceeded annually, which give an indication of the size of the art market at that time. = Late 20th century = In November 1970, Diego Velázquez’s Portrait of Juan de Pareja sold for $5.5 million. The sale tripled the previous world record of a decade earlier. In May 1990, Vincent van Gogh’s Portrait of Doctor Gachet sold for $82.5 million.A History Of Insane Art Prices Digg.com Retrieved 16 November 2015. = 21st century = In November 2013, $142.4 million was paid for the 1969 triptych, Three Studies of Lucian Freud, by Francis Bacon. The highest price ever paid for an artwork at auction was Pablo Picasso's Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O) (Women of Algiers) that was sold by Christie's in May 2015 for $179.4 million. Sotheby's and Christie's has become major dealers of Chinese porcelain antiques. As of 2016, some of the best collections had been auctioned for tens of millions US Dollars, through Sotheby's and Christie's. In the 21st Century, and especially since 2010, it has become more common for artworks to sell for prices in excess of $100m. Of the most expensive paintings of all time, most of those that sold for more than $100m were auctioned during or after 2010. The factors that can drive the price of a piece this high include the reputation of the artist, the age of the piece, the state of the art market, the piece's provenance, and the length of time since the piece was last up for sale. One of the largest changes to art auctions in 21st century is introduction and expansion of online bidding in addition and sometimes replacement of physical auctions. This allowed larger auction houses like Christie's, Sotheby's, Phillips and Heritage to expand both their reach to potential bidders and the inventory of artifacts auctioned, and the process is still going. On the other hand this concept made it possible for auctions mainly based online to appear and prosper, such as Invaluable, Live Auctioneers, Phi, etc. As a result of this shift, the art auction model is changing to become more inclusive of contemporary artists, and offering a broader range of the artworks to wider audiences. One of the most notable shifts associated with this change is constantly growing influence of the collectors from Asian markets. Controversy In 2000, Christie's and Sotheby's admitted to a criminal price fixing conspiracy in violation of antitrust law, and each agreed to pay clients million in compensation for illegally coordinating the commissions they charged on sales between 1993 and early 2000.Just the two of us - The duopoly in fine-art auctions is weakened but very much alive The Economist, economist.com, February 27, 2003.Commission rules against collusive behaviour of Christie's and Sotheby's, IP/02/1585, European Commission, europa.eu, October 30, 2002. Alfred Taubman, former chairman of Sotheby's, went to prison upon being convicted for his part in the scheme. Sotheby's CEO Diana Brooks and her counterpart at Christie's, Christopher Davidge, confessed to the crime; Brooks implicated Taubman, who was fined million in addition to going to prison. After Christie's announced it was cooperating with the government in the antitrust investigation in January 2000, clients of both auction houses filed hundreds of lawsuits against them; the suits were later consolidated into one class-action suit. That autumn, the houses agreed to a million settlement in the class-action suit, with Taubman saying he would pay million of Sotheby's million share.

They were also known as The Elders, The Consortium, and The Group. Because of their cover-up of extraterrestrial life, they were the primary antagonistic force opposing Dana Scully, Fox Mulder, John Doggett, and Monica Reyes during the series. Goals and methods An embodiment of the concept of the \\"shadow government\\" in conspiracy theory lore, the Syndicate is composed of covertly allied influential government officials and businessmen. The Syndicate, operating at the highest levels of power, concealed from the world a program by an unidentified extraterrestrial species to colonize and repopulate the planet, as well as their own plans and stake in that future, which they held to be inevitable. To carry out murder, cover-ups, sabotage and other wetworks projects, the Syndicate used an unknown number of henchmen commonly referred to as the Men in Black. The Men in Black were merciless protectors of the conspiracy whose true names, like the members of the Syndicate, were rarely, if ever, known. Many worked ostensibly for the U.S. Defense Department, Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, along with various other government agencies. Prominent Men in Black agents included X, Alex Krycek, the Crew Cut Man, and Quiet Willy. The leader of the Syndicate was a former German industrialist named Conrad Strughold, who had fled his home country and relocated to Tunisia.The X-Files soundtrack hidden commentary track However, most of the Syndicate's meetings were held at a clandestine club located on West 46th Street (with parallels to the Century Association and Ivy League alumni clubs) in New York City, and did not involve Strughold, due to the fact that his entry into the United States would potentially draw too much attention because of his ties to Nazi Germany. Meetings with Strughold were instead held in London. A possible front for the group, evidenced in the episode \\"Redux II\\", was a biotechnology firm called Roush. Reportedly, Carter named the company after USA Today TV critic Matt Roush, who was an influential early champion of The X-Files. Roush's facilities were used in some experiments involving the virus, as shown in the sixth season premiere \\"The Beginning\\". Also, according to Alvin Kurtzweil, when the alien takeover was set to commence in December 2012, the Syndicate would have seized control of the United States via the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which had the power to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency.  History  = Early years = The Syndicate was formed at the end of World War II, after the Roswell incident, when German scientists were brought to the United States to work on developing an alien-human hybrid. Alvin Kurtzweil recounted that when he and Bill Mulder were young men in the military, they were recruited for a project that they were told was concerned with biological warfare. Deep Throat claimed that it began after Roswell, when an ultrasecret conference of power brokers in the United States, the Soviet Union, United Kingdom, China, France, West Germany, and East Germany, signed a treaty that if an alien spacecraft crashed on Earth and the extraterrestrials survived, the country that held them would be responsible for their immediate extermination. The group that would become the Syndicate existed as early as 1952 as a secret group within the Department of State. Their activities included experimenting with xenotransplantation, relocating ex-Nazi scientists to the United States after WWII, and covering up the black oil discovered in the Piper Maru in 1953. colonists in 1973 when they forged their alliance with the Syndicate The members of the Syndicate within the State Department officially broke off ties with the United States government in 1973. However, some of the members continued to work within the State Department. On October 13, the Syndicate formally forged their alliance with the alien colonists at El Rico Air Force Base. The Cigarette Smoking Man personally presented a folded American flag to the aliens, symbolizing their surrender to a superior intergalactic force. The Syndicate was also commencing their work on the Project, which would see an immense effort in creating an alien/human hybrid to serve the aliens as a slave race after colonization. To allow the Syndicate to develop the hybrid, they were provided an alien fetus from which to extract DNA and begin research. However, the aliens demanded in exchange samples of human DNA. Members of the Syndicate turned over their loved ones to the aliens as part of the exchange. The Cigarette Smoking Man handed over his wife, Cassandra Spender, and William Mulder reluctantly surrendered his daughter, Samantha. By March 22, 1992, the Syndicate had use of a vast warehouse in The Pentagon where artifacts constituting evidence of alien existence were stored. The Cigarette Smoking Man added an implant, recovered by Mulder and Scully on their first case together, to the items kept in this storage facility. As Mulder and Scully learned, other efforts to erase their findings were apparently made, including the disappearance of paperwork, such as a case file on Billy Miles, that the agents had filed with the District Attorney's office in Raymon County, Oregon. = Destruction = In 1998, the Syndicate learned of a rebel faction among the aliens that was fighting against their brethren and the colonization of Earth. The first incident of rebel violence on Earth occurred in Kazakhstan, where dozens of impending abductees were found incinerated. Marita Covarrubias investigated the incident and quickly had it covered up. Shortly thereafter, many more abductees were summoned to Skyland Mountain via their metallic tags. Again, the group was attacked and incinerated by the alien rebels. It was at this time that the rebels were more clearly identified as being faceless—with their facial orifices sewn shut to prevent black oil infection—a telltale characteristic that set them apart as the rebel force. The following year, the rebels made their most daring—and most destructive—move. Outside of Washington, D.C., they attacked a train car, wherein a group of Syndicate doctors led by Eugene Openshaw were experimenting on Cassandra Spender—the first successful alien-human hybrid. The rebels incinerated the doctors, but left Cassandra alive so that the Project would be revealed and subsequently destroyed. Indeed, one of the rebels killed the Second Elder and assumed his position at meetings of the Syndicate; however, The Smoking Man realized this and had the group cease meeting together. The Smoking Man contacted his son, Jeffrey Spender, and charged him with killing the rebel posing as the Second Elder. However, Spender fails, and Alex Krycek successfully completes the assassination. Spender then realizes the scope of the conspiracy being carried out by his father, and he pledges his support to Fox Mulder. Having their hand forced by the rebels, the Syndicate retrieved Cassandra Spender and prepared to present her to the aliens so that colonization could begin. However, the rebels instead appear and incinerate the entire group of high-ranking Syndicate members, meaning the destruction of the Syndicate. =Legacy= Later in 1999, Scully asked Mulder what more he could possibly hope to do or to find, after having done and uncovered so much, such as exposing the secrets of a conspiracy of men who had been doing human experiments but were all now dead. Mulder's reply was that he still hoped to find his sister. Later on, Mulder dreamt of the Syndicate, in which an illusory version of the Cigarette Smoking Man claimed that his group had \\"made entire cultures disappear\\". In reality, the Cigarette Smoking Man continued working on the Project with a group of men who held a conference to discuss colonization in 1999. The Cigarette Smoking Man also continued working with his doctors, who were aware of the Syndicate's work to create a human-alien hybrid and attempted to continue this work. The Cigarette Smoking Man is also seen, in \\"Biogenesis\\", meeting with a group of men, some in military uniforms, who are speaking about some sort of disaster and \\"containment\\" of it. Presumably they are speaking about colonization, and this assembly of men may be part of the Cigarette Smoking Man's intentions, revealed in \\"Requiem\\", to try to rebuild the conspiracy. In season eight, Doctor Lizzy Gill admitted to Mulder, Assistant Director Walter Skinner and Special agent John Doggett that, for the past ten years, she and her colleagues had been working to create a human-alien hybrid. According to her, the work had originally been financed by a group of government men but had continued after their deaths. Gill's colleagues, by this time, included Doctors Parenti, Lev and Duffy Haskell, but they all had been killed recently by super soldier Billy Miles. With the Syndicate eliminated, the power vacuum was eventually filled in season nine by a new government-like organization. This organization included members such as the Toothpick Man, Gene Crane, and Knowle Rohrer, among others. All known members revealed to viewers in the series were super soldiers, men with superhuman abilities - with the exception of Alex Krycek, who was killed in \\"Existence\\". During the season finale, \\"The Truth\\" this unnamed organization shuts down the X-Files office at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mulder was left on the run until all his criminal charges were lifted in 2008 (The X-Files: I Want to Believe). In the eleventh season premiere \\"My Struggle III\\", Mulder encountered Mr. Y and his accomplice Erika Price, who claimed to be former members of the Syndicate with their own agenda involving the colonization of space and simulated reality.  Men in Black  The Men in Black is the unofficial name of a group of enforcers employed by the Syndicate to take care of the dirty work of the conspiracy. Most of them were ex- military, highly trained and loyal hitmen, who worked as a front in government agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Defense, and the National Security Agency. The Men in Black are analogous to the Alien Bounty Hunters employed by the Colonists. The Men in Black were, however, not as reliable as the bounty hunters and though sometimes they were used initially it took the more capable Alien Bounty Hunters to complete difficult tasks. The Syndicate would use the bounty hunters only when absolutely necessary because of an increased risk of exposure.

Its music was composed by John Barry and the lyrics by Hal David. It is a secondary musical theme in the 1969 Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, the title theme being the instrumental \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\", also composed by Barry. The song title is taken from Bond's final words in both the novel and the film, spoken after the death of Tracy Bond, his wife. Armstrong was too ill to play his trumpet therefore it was played by another musician.On Her Majesty's Secret Service liner notes, On Her Majesty's Secret Service - Ultimate Edition (©2006 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc.). Barry chose Armstrong because he felt he could \\"deliver the title line with irony\\". The song was released as a single in both the US and the UK (under the abridged title \\"All The Time in the World\\" in the UK45cat.com) to coincide with the release of the film in December 1969, but did not chart in either market. The recording became a hit in the UK twenty- five years later, in 1994, as a result of a Guinness beer commercial, after My Bloody Valentine chose to cover it for charity. Armstrong's version was then re-released on vinyl and CD and reached #3 in the UK Singles Chart and #4 in Ireland. In 2005, a BBC survey found that it was the third most popular love song played at weddings. In addition to My Bloody Valentine, \\"We Have All the Time in the World\\" has been covered by The Specials, Iggy Pop (whose version plays during the end credits of the film The Jacket), Fun Lovin' Criminals, Vic Damone, Michael Ball, Giorgia Todrani, The Puppini Sisters, Tindersticks, The Pale Fountains, Propellerheads, Shirley Bassey (for a later withdrawn album of Bond themes), Thomas White and Alfie Boe.

Most recently, the term has been applied to proceedings against President George W. Bush's advisers and the Republican Party leadership in Congress, including Tom DeLay, Bill Frist, and Karl Rove (see Plame affair). The position of their defenders, who include Robert Novak, William Kristol and Rush Limbaugh, is that the accusations against these officials lack substance and Democratic partisans seek to weaken them for political reasons, perhaps to the point of retaking Congress in 2006. The position of many Democrats is that the cause of the plethora of investigations is the \\"culture of corruption\\" established by the Republicans in power, and that anyone who has broken laws or rules must face the consequences. The opponents also point out that some of the politicians denouncing the current pursuit of alleged Republican misconduct have in the past called for vigorous pursuit of alleged Democratic misconduct. The phrase was previously used by supporters of President Bill Clinton in reference to legal action against members of his administration, including Henry Cisneros.

Astronomer Margherita Hack worked at the Observatory from 1954 to 1964, until she became Professor of the Institute of Physics at the Trieste University. Today the Observatory's staff consists of approximatively one hundred people. The research area covers a large range of fields from planets to stars, black holes, galaxies, gamma-ray bursts and cosmlogy. The Observatory is also active in the tecnological research applied to the astronomical instrumentation and it is one of the world leaders in the developement of X-ray astronomy optics and light instrumentation for space missions.http://www.brera.inaf.it/?page=chisiamo;lingua=inglese  The Museum  The Observatory Museum’s collection features astronomical instruments used by the Brera astronomers over the years, from the early days of the Observatory to the 1970s. The collection, started by Giovanni Schiaparelli and enriched by subsequent directors, is displayed in the entrance hall of the Observatory. The present layout of the gallery is the result of an effort aimed at the preservation and promotion of the items on display, which have been restored and catalogued as part of a project started by the Institute for General and Applied Physics of the University of Milan. The Observatory's nucleus of astronomical instruments has been enriched with miscellaneous scientific instruments that are part of the historical collection of the University of Milan. These include telescopes, microscopes, pneumatic and electrostatic devices, instruments for cartographic surveys of the 18th-19th century. The dome with the 8-inch refracting telescope which Schiaparelli had installed in 1875 is also part of the Museum. Schiaparelli used this telescope for his astronomical researches of binary stellar systems, comets, asteroids and planets of the Solar System, and particularly Mars.

As an uncredited “ghost” author, MacIntyre is known to have written or co-written several other books, including at least one novel in the Tom Swift IV series, The DNA Disaster, published as by \\"Victor Appleton\\" (a house pseudonym) but with MacIntyre's name on the acknowledgments page. On 25 June 2010, MacIntyre set his Brooklyn apartment on fire and his body was later found there.Ryan Lavis, \\"Depressed Brooklyn man kills himself by setting fire to his apartment,\\" New York Daily News 26 June 2010, giving his age as 59. link dead 12 September 2020 Background Little is known about MacIntyte's background, early life or family. Throughout his life, he told various stories about his family, birthplace and childhood that remain unsubstantiated, and which, after his death, his brother confirmed to be fictional. MacIntyre often told people he was orphaned by a Scottish family and raised in an Australian orphanage and a child labor camp.Kilgannon, Corey (10 September 2010). Froggy's last story. The New York Times He used the aliases Paul Grant Jeffery, Timothy/Tim C. Allen, Oleg V. Bredikhine, and the nickname Froggy.Kilgannon, Corey (10 September 2010). Fiery End for an Eccentric Recluse. The New York Times But a teenage acquaintance alleged that the young MacIntyre spoke then with a plain New York accent from Long Island or Queens, raising questions about his claims of foreign origin. Another acquaintance who knew MacIntyre in his twenties remembered that he still spoke with an American accent, and used the name Jeremy MacIntyre. An acquaintance remembers MacIntyre sharing the reason for the \\"Gwynplaine\\" in his name; it was, he said, from the film The Man Who Laughs, based on the Victor Hugo novel, in which the title character, Gwynplaine, has had a permanent smile surgically carved on his face. MacIntyre stated that he identified with Gwynplaine and thus chose the name as part of his own. Works In the 1970s, MacIntyre worked for a Manhattan publisher of pornographic novels. Employees were paid $175 per week and expected to produce an entire pornographic novel in that time, as well as a chapter for a compilation-format pornographic book supposedly assembled from the cases of a Dr. Lamb. Although MacIntyre professionally published many works of non-fiction and literature, he is best known as an author of genre fiction: specifically, science fiction, fantasy, horror and mystery stories. His short stories were published in Weird Tales, Analog, Asimov's Science Fiction, Amazing Stories, Absolute Magnitude, Interzone, the Strand Magazine and numerous anthologies, including Terry Carr's Best Science Fiction of the Year #10,Contents Lists Michael Reaves and John Pelan's mystery/horror anthology Shadows Over Baker Street, James Robert Smith and Stephen Mark Rainey's horror anthology Evermore, and Stephen Jones's The Mammoth Book of Best New Horror. For Mike Ashley's The Mammoth Book of Historical Detectives (1995), MacIntyre wrote \\"Death in the Dawntime,\\" a locked room mystery (or rather, sealed cave mystery) set in Australia around 35,000 BC, which editor Mike Ashley suggests is the furthest in the past a historical whodunnit has been set. A characteristic of MacIntyre's writing (both fiction and non-fiction) is his penchant for coining new words and resurrecting obscure words. Language authority William Safire acknowledged MacIntyre's neologism of \\"Clintonym\\" quote: \\"The most memorable Clintonism or Clintonym (a coinage of F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre)...\\" and quoted his historical etymology research. MacIntyre illustrated Ron Goulart's story \\"The Robot Who Came to Dinner\\" in Analog (July–August 2002). In addition to publishing science fiction in Analog, MacIntyre also contributed to that magazine as an artist, illustrating his own stories and one by Ron Goulart.F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre - Summary Bibliography MacIntyre wrote a considerable number of book reviews for The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. In the July 2003 issue of that magazine, MacIntyre mentioned that he was related to the wife of Scottish author Eric Linklater. It is unclear whether this was one of the many fabrications about his life that MacIntyre's brother later confirmed to be untrue. MacIntyre had previously stated (in interviews and at science-fiction conventions) that he was estranged from his abusive family and did not acknowledge them. He had legally changed his name, officially filing a deed poll: \\"Fergus MacIntyre\\" was therefore his legal name but not his birth name. He had acknowledged that he took the name \\"Gwynplaine\\" from the protagonist of The Man Who Laughs, a novel by Victor Hugo. MacIntyre claimed to have contributed substantial script material to a 2006 documentary about actress Theda Bara, The Woman with the Hungry Eyes: he claimed his contributions included the film's title and an interview he had conducted with author Fritz Leiber. He is only listed under the \\"Special Thanks\\" section of the credits; MacIntyre claimed to be contractually prevented from receiving a screenplay credit. Legal issues In 2000, MacIntyre was arrested after a neighbor said he duct-taped her to a chair, shaved her head, and spray-painted her black. He later plead guilty to third-degree misdemeanor assault. Death In the months leading up to his death, MacIntyre became increasingly depressed and despondent. He sent mass emails to friends where he spoke of being troubled by his childhood (he would describe his family as “deeply evil people”) and referenced suicide. He had also lost his night job as a printer and claimed to have health problems including synesthesia. One day before his death, MacIntyre posted a review of the silent German science fiction film Metropolis (1927), titled \\"My favourite film, my last review.\\" on IMDb. On 24 June 2010, police were called to MacIntyre's Bensonhurst apartment after a friend received a mass email from MacIntyre that alluded to suicide. Six police officers forcibly removed MacIntyre from the apartment as he yelled that he wanted to die and take “everyone in the building down with me.” He was taken to Coney Island Hospital for psychiatric evaluation and released hours later. MacIntyre returned to his apartment and sent off an angry mass email admonishing the person who called the police. At around 9:30 a.m. on June 25, MacIntyre, who was a long time hoarder, lit the contents of his apartment on fire. The fire quickly engulfed the building and took sixty firefighters more than an hour to extinguish. MacIntyre's body was later found among the burned debris. He was the only fatality in the fire as the other residents were quickly evacuated. After his death, MacIntyre's brother came forward and stated that MacIntyre's life story was in fact fabricated, but did not provide any details about his real-life story- save that they did have Scottish ancestry- or the reasons for his fabrications and affectations.

It premiered December 1, 2000 on Disney Channel as part of their Christmas season. Plot Two teen girls, Samantha Elizabeth \\"Sam\\" Kwan (age 13) (Brenda Song) and Allison Rachel \\"Allie\\" Thompson (age 13) (Hallee Hirsh) find a weather machine at a shack in the woods. After learning of its controls, they use it to make it snow in Los Angeles. It turns out that the weather machine belongs to Santa Claus (John B. Lowe) and he informs Mrs. Claus about this. To help Santa Claus, she sends two elves, Crumpet (John Salley) and Sparky (Bill Fagerbakke). A weather man named Edwin Hadley (Peter Scolari) tries to figure out what's causing the strange weather and track it down to keep himself from getting fired by his boss Mr. Martino (Jason Schombing). Edwin's boss expects Edwin to get down to the bottom of the sudden snow appearances. When Sparky and Crumpet catch up to Santa Claus, they find a footprint of a type of girl shoes that are only made in California. Santa and the elves set off to interrogate each girl on the naughty list that wears those type of shoes. Soon, the snowstorm gets so large that it spreads to San Francisco and Allie's dad gets snowed in at the airport and may not make it home in time for Christmas. Allie tries to turn it off, but over night it turns itself back on and it creates a blizzard. They are unable to make it do anything now. Samantha shares sad stories with Allie about how her dad would spend Christmas, while Allie is sad about her dad missing Christmas. During the blizzard, Edwin manages to trace the weather phenomenon to Allie's house. Due to traffic, he manages to borrow a guy's snowmobile. When Allie and Sam head to the shed to get the flashlights, they encounter Santa, Crumpet, and Sparky who identify Allie as the next person on their naughty list while her best friend Sam is a positive overachiever and good role model in school. They managed to get proof that he's Santa Claus when he tells the girls all about them and the weather machine. Edwin arrives at Allie's house and manages to gain entry. Edwin does manage to find the weather machine after Allie's brother found it and berated him for messing with it. Upon being cornered in Allie's room by the girls, Santa, and the elves, he announces his plans to be the best weather man in history and fain more publicity on television attempts. During his escape, he sees the guy he borrowed the snowmobile from and crashes into a chocolate making factory where he falls into a chocolate vat. The group follow his trail into the chocolate factory and follows Edwin's chocolatey trail. Sparky follows him up into the raftings where he falls into a box of cotton candy. The group then reclaims the weather machine. At Santa's shack, he then works to find the problem in the weather machine. With Sam and Allie's help, they manage to fix the weather machine (Santa forgot to put in the right batteries) and stop the weather. Santa then tells Edwin that there is another type of job that deals with weather. Crumpet and Sparky pick up Allie's dad just in time for Christmas morning. Meanwhile, Hadley gets a job in the Antarctic teaching scientists about the weather.

The Carey Act was enacted into law by Congress by the Act of August 18, 1894 (28 Stat. 422), as amended (43 U.S.C. 641 et seq.). It was a new approach for the disposal of public desert land, as the federal government decided this task was too large for individual settlers.Encyclopedia of the American West. 4 vols. Macmillan Reference USA, 1996 http://galenet.galegroup.com/servlet/HistRC/hits?docNum=BT2330500244&tab;=1&locID;=pool11244&origSearch;=true&hdb;=US&t;=RK&s;=1&r;=d&items;=0&secondary;=true&o;=&sortOrder;=&n;=10&l;=dR&sgPhrase;=false&c;=1&tabMap;=1&bucket;=gal&SU;=Carey+Act. Through advertising, these companies attracted farmers to the many states which successfully utilized the act, notably Idaho and Wyoming. Senator Joseph Maull Carey of Wyoming introduced the bill in 1892 but it was not passed by Congress until 1894 when it was attached as a compromise measure to the 1894 Civil Appropriations Bill. The Act established the General Land Office, which was controlled by the federal government. This land office assigned as many as one million acres (4,000 km²) of land for each western state. Each state then had to regulate the new land, selecting private contractors, selecting settlers, and the maximum price they could charge for water. Potential settlers who met specific requirements were granted each. Projects were financed by the development companies, who eventually handed over control to an operating company. In most states, settlers had to pay an entry fee, plus a small amount for the land, and meet several guidelines. In Iowa, for example, settlers had to cultivate and irrigate at least one sixteenth of their parcel within one year from the date which water became available. After another year, one eighth had to be cultivated, and by the third year — had the settler lived in the land, and paid all necessary fees — they would receive the deed to that parcel. In general, the act was not as successful as intended, because few western states had the financial resources to make it effective. However, both Idaho and Wyoming achieved some successes. In 1908 Idaho received an additional two million acres (8,000 km²) and Wyoming received an additional one million acres (4,000 km²) of land to develop under the Carey Act. Today, approximately 60% of the Carey Act lands irrigated in the United States are in Idaho. Examples of successful Carey Act projects include Boise, Minidoka and Twin Falls. Wyoming was home to some of the first projects under the Carey Act, including the Cody Canal financed by a group of investors led by William F. Cody and supported by then state engineer Elwood Mead. Many of Wyoming's irrigation projects also began following World War II.Carey Act in Wyoming http://wyoarchives.state.wy.us/Research/Topics/SubTopic.asp?SubID=4&nav;=1&homeID;=1 .

H. Haverly merged four of the companies he owned and managed.  Promotion  Borrowing techniques from showmen like P. T. Barnum, Haverly advertised the Mastodons in broadsides, newspapers, and playbills: \\"FORTY—COUNT 'EM—40—FORTY—HAVERLY'S UNITED MASTODON MINSTRELS\\".Advertisement quoted in Toll 146. Another ad read, \\"Forty is a magical and historical number. In the time of Noah it rained forty days and forty nights. The Children of Israel wandered forty years in the wilderness. Haverly's famous forty are just as important.\\"  Showmanship  The Mastodons entered every new town in two columns, spread out as far as possible and led by a brass band. Beginning in 1878, a drum corps joined their ranks so that they could tour one part of a city while the band played in another. After sufficient marching, the two units joined up and led intrigued spectators into the theater. The company's manager, Charles Frohman, showed off a three-foot-tall iron safe when the troupe arranged for accommodations, with a golden \\"Haverly's Mastodon Minstrels\\" blazoned on its side; only the troupe knew that the safe rarely held anything of value. The United Mastodon Minstrels and the aura that surrounded them were all about size. In one 1879 production in Chicago, the curtain raised to reveal 19 minstrels. Behind them was another curtain, this one featuring a female figure representing \\"Dance\\". This went up and added another group of men, these standing in front of the figure of \\"Music\\". As this curtain lifted, the audience saw yet more men backed by the figure of \\"Art\\". This in turn rose, to complete the ensemble. The final backdrop was an image of two of Haverly's theaters.Toll 147. In addition to size, the Mastodons' shows emphasized lavish scenery and extravagant expense. The program for an 1880 show addressed the audience: \\"The attention of the public is respectfully called to the magnificent scene representing a Turkish Barbaric Palace in Silver and Gold.\\" The sketch began with minstrels portraying Turkish soldiers on a mountain. The scenery then changed to a royal palace, the scene of a dancing contest. For the finale, a number of unrelated scenes appeared, representing \\"Base-Ball\\", \\"The Dying Athlete\\", \\"The Strong Defending the Weak\\", and \\"United We Stand\\". The third act consisted of a circus burlesque, called \\"PEA-TEA-BAR-NONE'S KOLLOSAL CIRKUSS, MUSEUM, MENAGERIE AND KAYNE'S KICKADROME KAVALKADE\\".3 January 1880 program, Jersey City, New Jersey. Quoted in Toll 147. The segment featured acrobats, bareback riders, clowns, tightrope walkers, and minstrels in elephant costumes.  Success  Haverly's United Mastodon Minstrels saw great success, and the impact on minstrelsy was profound. Other troupe owners rushed to compete, mimicking the Mastodons' elaborate sets and large number of players. Ultimately, many smaller companies folded or were forced to travel further from the established minstrel circuits in order to survive. Notes References *Toll, Robert C. (1974).

History The college was officially founded in 1936 and is fully accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. This is the date that the school uses as the official establishment, even though it had been operating under various names and places before this. It was established as \\"Placer Junior College\\". In 1954 the college was named \\"College of the Sierras\\" with a wolverine as the mascot. There were other junior colleges named after regions. These included: College of the Redwoods, College of the Sequoias & College of the Siskiyous The main campus in Rocklin was chosen by 1960, out of 35 possible sites. The planned construction of Interstate 80 was a consideration in the decision making. In 1961, the new campus opened. In 1996, another campus in Nevada County opened, in between Grass Valley and Nevada City. During 2000–2005, outreach campuses in Roseville and near Truckee were opened. It is governed by a board of seven trustees who are elected district-wide and a student trustee. The constituent groups within the district—trustees, faculty, students, management and classified staff—are committed to the principle of shared governance for assuring broad and deep participation in all decisions critical to the college and district. Only five individuals have held the post of president in the last 50 years. Academics Approximately 125 degree and certificate programs are offered in a wide variety of configurations taught by 216 full and 650 part-time faculty members.

This gives the option to purchase an expensive car and hit the circuit, or purchase an inexpensive car and put extra money towards upgrades right away. The \\"paddock\\" is the garage area where the player will maintain and upgrade their cars. In the car shop, cars can be bought and sold. All cars can be upgraded. The player can modify the car to increase its performance and value. Once a component has been upgraded, it can be installed or removed at any time. Components that can be upgraded are: brakes, suspension, exhaust, engine, gearbox, aero kit and the tires of the car. The player can tune their car. Not tuning in making a design to the car or spray with colour, but change the optimum performance of the car. Components that can be adjusted are: brakes, suspension, ride height, transmission, gearbox, downforce and the tires. When a whole class is finished (all five races), the final results are shown. If the player has done well enough, there will be a special race held. The player can accept or not. If the player accepts, they will race against a car that has not been available. The player needs to beat the CPU player to win their car and $150,000. The first race in the first class (GTQ) is Sebring International Short, with three laps. The final race of the first class (GT1) is Sebring International Raceway, with 20 laps. The player's car does not get damaged but it can get slower from hitting other cars, people, or walls. Paris GT1, a bonus class, is made available when a player has completely finished the GT1 class. The bonus class has the same cars as GT1 but different tracks, based in Paris, France.

The appearance of the dragon reflects its relation to its East Asian counterparts, including the Chinese dragons. Korean dragons Whereas most dragons in European mythology are linked to the elements of fire and destruction, dragons in Korean mythology are primarily benevolent beings related to water and agriculture, often considered bringers of rain and clouds. Hence, many Korean dragons are said to have resided in rivers, lakes, oceans, or even deep mountain ponds. The symbol of the dragon has been used extensively in Korean culture, both in Korean mythology and ancient Korean art. Ancient texts sometimes mention sentient speaking dragons, capable of understanding complex emotions such as devotion, kindness, and gratitude. One particular Korean legend speaks of the great King Munmu, who on his deathbed wished to become a \\"Dragon of the East Sea in order to protect Korea\\". The Korean dragon is in many ways very similar in appearance to other East Asian dragons such as the Chinese and Japanese dragons. It differs from the Chinese dragon in that it developed a longer beard. Very occasionally a dragon may be depicted as carrying an orb known as the yeouiju (여의주), the Korean name for the mythical Cintamani, in its claws or its mouth. It was said that whoever could wield the yeouiju was blessed with the abilities of omnipotence and creation at will, and that only four-toed dragons (who had thumbs with which to hold the orbs) were both wise and powerful enough to wield these orbs, as opposed to the lesser, three-toed dragons. As with China, the number nine is significant and auspicious in Korea, and dragons were said to have 81 (9×9) scales on their backs, representing yang essence. Imugi Korean folk mythology states that most dragons were originally Imugis () (Imoogi), or lesser dragons, which were said to resemble gigantic serpents. There are a few different versions of Korean folklore that describe both what imugis are and how they aspire to become full-fledged dragons. Koreans thought that an Imugi could become a true dragon, or yong or mireu, if it caught a Yeouiju which had fallen from heaven. Another explanation states they are hornless creatures resembling dragons who have been cursed and thus were unable to become dragons. By other accounts, an Imugi is a proto-dragon which must survive one thousand years in order to become a fully fledged dragon. In either case they are said to be large, benevolent, python-like creatures that live in water or caves, and their sighting is associated with good luck. It is called Ishimi () (Isimi), Miri (), Young-no () (Youngno, Yeongno, Yeong-no), Gangcheori () (Kangcheori) or Kkwangcheori () or Kkangcheori (), Bari (), or Hweryong () or Iryong (). In the 2007 South Korean film D-War, two Imugi, of which one was benevolent and the other evil, were seen competing for possession of a source of power (the Yeouiju) by which one of them could become a dragon. Ultimately, the evil Imugi is destroyed by his rival moments after the latter had captured the source. Here, the two are shown to be physically different, in that the evil Imugi is darker-colored, more slender and distinguished by an inflexible hood similar to that of a cobra, whereas the good Imugi is paler, stockier, hoodless, and more closely resembles a python. Narration in the film implies that many Imugi exist at a time, whereof few are designated to become a dragon. Korean cockatrice The Korean cockatrice is known as a gye-lyong (), which literally means chicken-dragon; they do not appear as often as dragons. They are sometimes seen as chariot-pulling beasts for important legendary figures or for the parents of legendary heroes. One such legend involves the founding of the Kingdom of Silla, whose princess was said to have been born from a cockatrice egg. It is also the origin of the name for the city of Gyeryong in South Chungcheong province.

As with other mangroves, it occurs in the intertidal zones of estuarine areas. Distribution It is distributed along Africa's east coast, south-west, south and south-east Asia, and Australia. It occurs in New Zealand between 34 and 38 degrees south; its Māori name is mānawa. It is one of the few mangroves found in the arid regions of the coastal Arabian Peninsula, mainly in sabkha environments in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, as well as in similar environments on both side of the Red Sea (in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Eritrea, and Sudan), and Qatar and southern Iran along the Persian Gulf coast. It is a characteristic species of the Southern Africa mangroves ecoregion, and is one of three species present in Africa's southernmost mangroves, in the estuary of South Africa's Nahoon River at 32°56′S.Naidoo, Gonasageran (2016). \\"The mangroves of South Africa: An ecophysiological review\\". South African Journal of Botany, Volume 107, November 2016, Pages 101-113 The species is also found in Somalia. =Australia= In Australia, it extends much farther south than other mangroves, occurring in every mainland state. Its distribution is disjunct in Western Australia; the population of the Abrolhos Islands is further south than the nearest population of Shark Bay. Another mangrove system is found even further south (500 km) at Bunbury. This colonisation of southerly climes may have occurred relatively recently, perhaps several thousand years ago, when they were transferred by the Leeuwin Current. The most inland occurrence of mangroves in Australia is a stand of grey mangroves in the Mandora Marsh, some 60 km from the coast. In South Australia along the Barker Inlet and Port River in Gulf St Vincent, as well as in sheltered bays in Spencer Gulf and the west coast of Eyre Peninsula, A. marina forests form hatcheries for much of the state's fish and shellfish commercial and recreational fisheries. Description Excreted salt on the underside of a Avicennia marina var. resinifera leaf Flower Grey mangroves grow as a shrub or tree to a height of , or up to 14 m in tropical regions. The habit is a gnarled arrangement of multiple branches. It has smooth light-grey bark made up of thin, stiff, brittle flakes. This may be whitish, a characteristic described in the common name. The leaves are thick, long, a bright, glossy green on the upper surface, and silvery-white, or grey, with very small matted hairs on the surface below. As with other Avicennia species, it has aerial roots (pneumatophores); these grow to a height of about 20 cm (5 in), and a diameter of 1 cm. These allow the plant to absorb oxygen, which is deficient in its habitat. These roots also anchor the plant during the frequent inundation of seawater in the soft substrate of tidal systems. The flowers range from white to a golden yellow colour, are less than 1 cm across, and occur in clusters of three to five. The fruit contains large cotyledons that surround the new stem of a seedling. This produces a large, fleshy seed, often germinating on the tree and falling as a seedling. The grey mangrove can experience stunted growth in water conditions that are too saline, but thrive to their full height in waters where both salt and fresh water are present. The species can tolerate high salinity by excreting salts through its leaves. Avicennia marina var. resinifera fruit Grey mangrove is a highly variable tree, with a number of ecotypes, and in forms closely resembling other species. It has been reported to tolerate extreme weather conditions, high winds, and various pests and diseases. It is a pioneer in muddy soil conditions with a pH value of 6.5 to 8.0, but is intolerant of shade. A number of botanists have proposed division of the species, but currently three subspecies are recognised: *A. m. subsp. australasica *A. m. subsp. eucalyptifolia *A. m. subsp. marina References Further reading . * External links * marina Mangroves Afrotropical realm flora Australasian realm flora Indomalayan realm flora Central Indo-Pacific flora Western Indo-Pacific flora Flora of East Tropical Africa Flora of Northeast Tropical Africa Flora of the Arabian Peninsula Flora of the Western Indian Ocean Flora of Egypt Flora of Mozambique Flora of tropical Asia Trees of Australia Trees of New Zealand Trees of South Africa Trees of the Pacific Eudicots of Western Australia Lamiales of Australia Natural history of Balochistan, Pakistan Taxa named by Peter Forsskål Plants described in 1775 ","title":"Avicennia marina"},{"id":"2983307","text":"Grey mangrove may refer to either of two species of mangrove: * Avicennia marina - occurring around the Indian Ocean and into the western Pacific Ocean as far as New Zealand * Conocarpus erectus (Buttonwood) - occurring on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, along the eastern edge of the Pacific Ocean and in Melanesia and Polynesia ","title":"Grey mangrove"},{"id":"2983308","text":"Mega Man Zero is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the first installment in the Mega Man Zero series, the fifth series in Capcom's Mega Man video game franchise. It was released in Japan on April 26, 2002, and in North America and Europe later that year. Mega Man Zero is set 100 years following the Mega Man X saga of games. The plot follows the Reploid protagonist Zero, who is awakened from a century of sleep to aid a human scientist named Ciel and her resistance force in a fight against the utopia of Neo Arcadia, which is attempting to unjustly wipe out all androids it views as threats. Like its predecessors in the original Mega Man series and Mega Man X series, Mega Man Zero is an action-platformer. However, the game forgoes the franchise's traditional format of letting the player select stages and acquire each boss's weapon. It instead features a smaller number of upgradable weapons and mission-based progression within a large, interconnected world. The player may also acquire special power-ups called \\"Cyber Elves\\" which supplement the player's abilities or add various effects to a mission's stage. Mega Man Zero was produced as a commission product by Inti Creates for Capcom. The developer was responsible for all aspects of the game except the inclusion of the protagonist Zero, which was requested by series producer Keiji Inafune. Mega Man Zero has enjoyed a mostly positive press reception. Critics lauded the game's storyline, graphics, and tweaks on the franchise's classic action formula, though many were put off by aspects of its extreme difficulty level. Mega Man Zero garnered strong sales upon its debut and went on to produce three direct sequels on the GBA, as well as two titles in a sequel series on the Nintendo DS. It was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in Japan on October 22, 2014. In February 2020, the game was re-released on PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One as part of the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. Plot Roughly 100 years following the events of the Mega Man X series and the end of the Maverick Wars, the heroic Maverick Hunters X and Zero have long since vanished.. A human scientist named Ciel, her Cyber- elf Passy, and other Reploid companions are being chased through an abandoned underground laboratory. Their relentless pursuers are mass-produced androids called Pantheons, among other terrible machines. After taking heavy losses, Ciel, Passy and the remaining troops arrive at a sealed chamber containing Zero, who has been in stasis for a century. Passy sacrifices itself to awaken Zero, who is amnesic. Ciel, desperately seeking his help, explains they live in a world where Reploids are incorrectly accused of being Mavericks and systematically \\"retired\\", apparently under the direction of the once-famed Mega Man X. Shocked at this revelation and filled with doubt about his own identity as the Maverick Hunter of legend, Zero helps Ciel escape and joins her Resistance to fight against X and the utopia known as Neo Arcadia. Zero conducts missions on behalf of the Resistance in order to buy Ciel time to create a new energy source that will provide everyone with a safe place to live. One day, the base is attacked by Neo Arcadia, forcing everyone to flee. In the midst of the chaos, Ciel confesses to Zero that she helped create Neo Arcadia as a utopia where humans and Reploids were finally able to live in peace with X as their leader, but her plans fell apart when an energy shortage crisis began and X mysteriously disappeared. To counter this, while at age six, she created a \\"copy\\" of X to be its new leader. Copy X strived for X's ultimate desire for a peaceful world, but lacked the original's moral judgement. Believing that the Reploid race posed a danger to humans, Copy X began an operation to brand any Reploid whom he believed to be a menace to humanity as a Maverick and annihilate them without a fair trial, in order to reduce energy consumption. Zero invades Neo Arcadia and battles his way through the Four Guardians: Sage Harpuia, Hidden Phantom, Fighting Fefnir and Fairy Leviathan. Phantom self-destructs in a last ditch effort to destroy Zero, but fails, while the other three manage to escape. Copy X is eventually defeated, who also self-destructs in an attempt to take Zero with him. Zero escapes just in time from Neo Arcadia as Copy X, and everything around him, is destroyed. Running low on energy, Zero collapses in a nearby desert. A faint figure appears and reveals itself as the real X, now a Cyber-elf, who has been Zero's guide the entire time. X explains that he grew tired of fighting and, without a physical body, has left Zero the responsibility of bringing peace to the world. As X vanishes, Zero finds himself surrounded by an army of Pantheons. Zero accepts X's words and promises to continue the fight against Neo Arcadia. The final scene shows Zero as he dashes into battle against the Pantheons and slices one in half. Gameplay The player character Zero dashes left and slashes at an enemy. The left-sided HUD displays the player's remaining health. The narrative of Mega Man Zero is presented through text dialogue cutscenes with 2D sprites and hand-drawn, anime images. Mega Man Zero adopts the action-platforming gameplay prescribed by its predecessors in the original Mega Man and Mega Man X series. The player, as the protagonist Zero, is tasked with completing several side-scrolling stages, destroying enemies, completing objectives and battling bosses. The player can run, jump, fire the player character's primary weapon, or use a secondary weapon if it is available. As in the Mega Man X games, the player can dash along the ground, cling to and scale walls, or perform a combination of these abilities. Unlike previous titles in the franchise where separate stages are selectable from a menu, Mega Man Zero is presented as a single, interconnected overworld. The Resistance base acts as a hub with almost every area in the game freely explorable from it. The player is given a choice of missions to undertake for each section of the map. Completing one mission may unlock others. The player has only three lives to successfully complete a mission before receiving a game over. However, it is possible to fail non-critical missions by escaping the stage, using up both continues, or giving up the mission after dying. Doing so marks the mission as a failure, making it unavailable for the game's remainder. When available, each of the player's four weapons can be charged up for a more powerful attack. Moreover, the player can level-up weapons with prolonged use of them. Depending on the weapon, leveling one up will allow for more attacks, increased attack range, or shortened charge time. In previous Mega Man games, the player would obtain new weapons from defeated bosses and could in turn use those weapons against other bosses and minor enemies. In Mega Man Zero, defeating some bosses earns the player elemental chips (thunder, fire, or ice) that can be used during a charged attack to further damage foes weak to a specific element. Mega Man Zero also introduces \\"Cyber Elves\\", which can be found hidden in certain missions or dropped by enemies. Cyber Elves are collectible, single-use aids with either temporary or permanent effects on Zero or the game's levels. Cyber Elf effects range widely, from reducing the life gauge of a boss to slowing down all enemies in a stage. Up to three Cyber Elves can be equipped for a given level and some can only be activated once they are fed sufficient energy crystals picked up or collected from defeated enemies. The player's performance is scored on a percentage scale and graded at the end of each mission. The results are based on parameters including the completion time, the number of enemies destroyed, and the player's total damage. Development and release Mega Man Zero was developed by Inti Creates, a company established in 1996 by several former members of the game's publisher Capcom. Prior to the game's conception, Capcom had developed numerous games in its Mega Man franchise beginning with its classic series in 1987, then expanding to its Mega Man X spin-off series and two non-platformer series, Mega Man Legends and Mega Man Battle Network. Up until the development of Mega Man Zero, Inti Creates was not a successful venture. The company's vice president Yoshihisa Tsuda had wanted to create a Mega Man game and would often attend game conventions to express this interest to Keiji Inafune, an artist and producer for the franchise. Inafune eventually called Inti Creates requesting a game proposal, on which the company promptly began working. Mega Man Zero was developed as a commission product by Inti Creates, who were given a free rein on its design and premise. The game was produced by Inti Creates president Takuya Aiza and was co-directed by Ryota Ito and Capcom's Yoshinori Kawano. Inafune signed on as the game's co- producer. One goal for the developer was to make Mega Man Zero the most challenging out of all the games in the franchise up to that point. The gameplay model and characters act as extensions of the Mega Man X series, which itself expands upon the original Mega Man series. Zero was a secondary protagonist in the Mega Man X storyline. However, Inti Creates started developing Mega Man Zero without the character as the game's focus. Inafune had originally intended for 2000's Mega Man X5 to be the final game in its own series, ending with Zero's death. When Inafune requested that they make Zero its central character, the company complied and inserted Zero into their draft. Though Zero was mostly depicted as a benevolent hero in the X series, the designers wanted to blur the line between good and evil when drawing up the new game's narrative. This meant having Zero and Ciel's resistance feared by humanity as terrorists and making the Four Guardians and Pantheons protectors of the human race. The game's main antagonist was a popular topic of discussion during production, and the developer often sought input from Capcom in this regard. Tsuda jokingly suggested that they make the original Mega Man X the final boss, an idea that was at first accepted. According to Ito, Inti Creates realized that it \\"wouldn't sit so well with the young boys and girls that really do see [X] as a hero\\", so they replaced him with Copy X just one month before release. It was around this time that the writers designated Ciel as Copy X's creator. Complex explanations were added to the timeline to make this consistent with Ciel's young age. Other parts of the storyline were adjusted towards the end of production to allow for a sequel, as the team felt the characters were \\"quite memorable in their own right\\". The game's characters were designed by Toru Nakayama, while the graphics, concept art, and backgrounds were designed and illustrated by Azuma Honda. Based on Tsuda's ideas, the artists wanted to bridge the franchise's timeline gap between the \\"mechanical feel\\" of the X series and the \\"more human direction\\" of the Legends series. Inti Creates presented their concept art to Inafune and other members of Capcom at the Tokyo Game Show. Many of the designs were refined at this meeting and, as Nakayama explained, \\"a lot of trial-and-error ensued\\". First, Inafune wanted the artists to retain as much of the original Zero as possible, though the character's design was altered so consumers would not confuse the two series. Next, as Nakayama found it difficult to design the Cyber Elves, they were represented as simple balls of light or incomplete portraits within the game. Finally, because the game's Four Guardians had similar body structures and were each initially colored blue like X, Nakayama was forced to color them all differently, so as to make it easier to tell them apart as GBA sprites. Ippo Yamada composed all but one track of the musical score for Mega Man Zero; this remaining track, \\"Theme of Zero\\" from Mega Man X, was composed by Setsuo Yamamoto. Yamada wanted to differentiate the style of music of the Mega Man Zero series from this predecessor by treating it \\"more like a television or film-like presentation than the stage system like before\\". Mega Man Zero was first announced by Capcom on January 22, 2002 at a press event in Las Vegas. A copy of the game appeared at the 15th Next Generation World Hobby Fair in Japan on the following week on January 28. Mega Man Zero was officially released in Japan on April 26, 2002. The game appeared at the Electronic Entertainment Expo show that May in preparation for its North American release. Mega Man Zero arrived in stores stateside as early as September 10, 2002. Nintendo announced the game for a December 2002 release in Europe, but it was moved up to October 31 of that year. The game's depictions of violence, specifically the amount of blood, were toned down for its Western localizations. Reception and legacy Mega Man Zero has met with a mostly positive critical reception, holding scores of 81% and 82 out of 100 respectively on the aggregate review sites GameRankings and Metacritic. Reviewers across the board agreed that the game was the most difficult in the series, with one reviewer suggesting that it is not for younger or casual players. Avi Fryman of GameSpy.com states that the ability to give up on missions and still continue the game is a sensible feature of Mega Man Zero, whereas IGN states that given the difficulty of the game, no one would call a player \\"cheap\\" if they were to use the newly introduced Cyber Elf system to make boss fights easier. Overall, the Cyber Elf System earned a lukewarm response, though many did acknowledge that it made an otherwise difficult game easier. Common complaints with the game were slow down, \\"unseen deathtraps\\" and being required to make blind jumps. These, however, did not seem to detract much from the gaming experience as reviewers tended to recommend the game in their conclusions. Capcom reported healthy sales of Mega Man Zero during its release period. It was the third best-selling video game in Japan during its week of release at 66,990 units. Famitsu sales data supports that Mega Man Zero sold 135,850 units by June 2002 and 231,166 units by the end of that year in Japan alone. The popularity of Mega Man Zero spawned three direct sequels on the GBA. These games were developed by the same, core team members as the first Mega Man Zero title. Beginning in 2006, Inti Creates began releasing follow-up series on the Nintendo DS comprising two games: Mega Man ZX and Mega Man ZX Advent. In 2010, all four Mega Man Zero games were included in the Mega Man Zero Collection, released worldwide on the DS. This compilation removes all references to death and dying, features an easy difficulty mode, and makes other, minor alterations to all four games. A new collection was officially announced on August 27, 2019 and released as Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, which combines the four Zero series games with both of the ZX series games that was released on the PC (Steam), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One and rated T for Teen. It was released on February 25, 2020 for North America and February 27, 2020 in Japan. In addition to games, other media related to Mega Man Zero exists. A manga based on the series was written and illustrated by Hideto Kajima and serialized in the monthly Shogakukan magazine CoroCoro Comic from June 2003 to February 2006. Capcom did not immediately publish a soundtrack containing the score for Mega Man Zero. Instead, composer Ippo Yamada directed the release of an arrange album containing remixed versions of the game's songs. The album, Remastered Tracks Rockman Zero, was released in Japan on January 23, 2004. In addition to the 21 songs, this CD features five drama tracks; commentary tracks by Yamada; an interview with the Inti Creates sound team; character descriptions and an interview with character designer Toru Nakayama; and guest liner notes from artist and manga creator Hitoshi Ariga. The in-game instrumental music was compiled on the Rockman Zero Game Music Complete Works -Rockman Zero 1~3- soundtrack, released in Japan by Suleputer on July 1, 2004. An art book titled Mega Man Zero Official Complete Works was published in Japan by Capcom in 2006 and in North America by Udon Entertainment in 2008. The book contains detailed information on the series, promotional artwork, concept designs and sketches, and interviews with the Inti Creates staff.

Biography Hideo Sasaki was born in Reedley, California, on 25 November 1919. He grew up working on his family's California truck farm, and harvesting crops on Arizona farms. He began his college studies at the University of California, Berkeley during the time of World War II. Owing to his Japanese descent, he was forced into the Poston internment camp in Arizona. He was able to leave the camp upon volunteering to work as a farm hand in Sterling, Colorado. Soon after the war, he moved to Denver, Colorado where he met his wife, Kisa, a graduate of the University of Colorado. Sasaki then moved to the University of Illinois where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Landscape Architecture in 1946. In 1948 he graduated with a Master of Landscape Architecture from Harvard Design School. After graduation he returned to Illinois where he instructed for two years. For the next eighteen years (1953-1970) he became a professor and the chairman of the department of Landscape Architecture of the Harvard Graduate School of Design. In 1953, he founded Sasaki Associates, incorporated in nearby Watertown, Massachusetts, where he was the president and chairman until 1980. He led the company's architects and planners in developing many noted commercial areas and corporate parks.\\"In the boom years after World War II, Mr. Sasaki's team built some of America's first corporate parks, as companies like Upjohn and John Deere moved their headquarters from city to country.\\" NYTimes obituary In 1956 he worked on the design of the Havana Plan Piloto with Mario Romañach and the Catalan architect Josep Lluís Sert. During his later years he lived with his family (wife and two daughters, Rin and Ann) in Lafayette, California. He died on 30 August 2000 in a hospital in Walnut Creek, California. Style of design Sasaki helped to modernize the concepts of Landscape Architecture. He created a practical approach to designing a landscape. In his works, several characteristics are taken into account, such as the historical, cultural, environmental, and social use of the land. Sasaki became famous for developing this concept of interdisciplinary planning. In all of the sites that he developed, a balance is implemented into the design. One aspect that Sasaki Associates pays particular attention to is the environmental aspect of the land. They have taken part in creating several \\"green designs.\\" These designs are created to enhance or maintain the health of the environment. Some prominent examples can be viewed at the Utah State University Innovation Campus, The Virginia Biosphere, Walden Woods, and the Manulife Financial U.S. Operations Headquarters. Another facet of Sasaki's approach was the modernism that he worked into his college campus projects.

People who engage in bookselling are called booksellers, bookpeople, bookmen, or bookwomen. The founding of libraries in 300 BC stimulated the energies of the Athenian booksellers. History In Rome, toward the end of the republic, it became the fashion to have a library, and Roman booksellers carried on a flourishing trade. The spread of Christianity naturally created a great demand for copies of the Gospels, other sacred books, and later on for missals and other devotional volumes for both church and private use. The modern system of bookselling dates from soon after the introduction of printing. In the course of the 16th and 17th centuries the Low Countries for a time became the chief centre of the bookselling world. Modern book selling has changed dramatically with the advent of the Internet. With major websites such as Amazon, eBay, and other big book distributors offering affiliate programs, book sales have now, more than ever, been put in the hands of the small business owner. =Modern era= Atuagkat Bookstore in the city of Nuuk (Sermersooq, Greenland) Bookstores (called bookshops in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and most of the Commonwealth, apart from Canada) may be either part of a chain, or local independent bookstores. Stores can range in size offering from several hundred to several hundred thousand titles. They may be brick and mortar stores or internet only stores or a combination of both. Sizes for the larger bookstores exceed half a million titles. Bookstores often sell other printed matter besides books, such as newspapers, magazines and maps; additional product lines may vary enormously, particularly among independent bookstores. Colleges and universities often have bookstores on campus that focus on providing course textbooks and scholarly books, and often also sell other supplies and logo merchandise. Many on-campus bookstores are owned or operated by large commercial chains such as WHSmith or Waterstone's in the United Kingdom, or Barnes & Noble College Booksellers in the United States. Another common type of bookstore is the used bookstore or second-hand bookshop which buys and sells used and out-of-print books in a variety of conditions.Brown, Richard & Brett, Stanley.

Book collectors tend to frequent used book stores. Large online bookstores offer used books for sale, too. Individuals wishing to sell their used books using online bookstores agree to terms outlined by the bookstore(s): for example, paying the online bookstore(s) a predetermined commission once the books have sold. In Paris, the Bouquinistes are antiquarian and used booksellers who have had outdoor stalls and boxes along both sides of the Seine for hundreds of years, regulated by law since the 1850s and contributing to the scenic ambience of the city.

Red indicates the fastest-growing bred vectors while blue the slowest. In applied mathematics, bred vectors are perturbations, related to Lyapunov vectors, that capture fast-growing dynamical instabilities of the solution of a numerical model. They are used, for example, as initial perturbations for ensemble forecasting in numerical weather prediction. They were introduced by Zoltan Toth and Eugenia Kalnay. Method Bred vectors are created by adding initially random perturbations to a nonlinear model. The control (unperturbed) and the perturbed models are integrated in time, and periodically the control solution is subtracted from the perturbed solution. This difference is the bred vector. The vector is scaled to be the same size as the initial perturbation, and is then added back to the control to create the new perturbed initial condition. After a short transient period, this \\"breeding\\" process creates bred vectors dominated by the naturally fastest-growing instabilities of the evolving control solution.

It was published in the 1947 collection Nineteen Stories. The work was filmed in 1957, starring Rod Steiger, and as Double Take in 2001. Plot The story is told first- person by an unnamed narrator who reveals little about himself, other than that he is a wandering stranger stranded in a small Mexican border village. The narrator is fascinated by Joseph Calloway, a famous con-man believed to be extremely wealthy, who is in the Mexican village on the run from the law. The narrator claims to feel sympathy not for Calloway but for Calloway's dog, an ugly creature that he repeatedly kicks. Two detectives enter the village looking for Calloway, but though they have several conversations with the con- man, they never realize he is their quarry. Meanwhile, Calloway, overcome by homesickness for America, manages to get himself secreted across the border. In the end, Calloway is killed by the detectives' car, apparently while trying to save the dog's life and the truth about the human experience isn't revealed. The narrator claims to find something comic in the end of Calloway's life. He writes \\"Death doesn't change comedy to tragedy.\\" The reader is left to evaluate the meaning of this statement and to weigh both the tragic and the comic elements of the story. The story builds its tension on dramatic irony, with the narrator knowing more about the story than both Calloway and the detectives, and the Mexican natives knowing more than the narrator, who says, \\"Any man doing dusty business in any of the wooden booths in the town is better fitted by long observation to tell Mr Calloway's tale than I am.\\"  References 1938 short stories Short stories by Graham Greene Short stories adapted into films Films shot at Pinewood Studios ","title":"Across the Bridge (short story)"},{"id":"2983369","text":"Grendel Grendel Grendel is a 1981 Australian animated film written, directed and designed by Alexander Stitt and starring Peter Ustinov. It was based on John Gardner's novel Grendel. The music was composed and conducted by Bruce Smeaton and has been released on the 1M1 Records label. Like Gardner's novel, the film is a retelling of part of the epic poem Beowulf from the monster Grendel's point of view. Grendel (voiced by Ustinov) is by turns a thoughtful and contemplative character and a rampaging monster who attacks the mead hall of an early Danish kingdom, biting the head off of one would-be defender. This was the second full-length fully animated film ever made in Australia (coming after 1972's Marco Polo Junior Versus the Red Dragon). Plot Initially narrated by the titular character through a flashback, Grendel (Peter Ustinov), the \\"Great Boogey\\", recounts how he first left his cave as a child and encountered the Danish King Hrothgar (Ed Rosser) and his thegns. After being rescued by his mother, Grendel pondered over the similarities he shared with the Danes, yet lamented on their not being able to understand his language. He watched as Hrothgar's power and wealth grew, disgusted at his excesses and the royal Shaper's (Keith Michell) revision of history, presenting the king's underhanded and brutal achievements as glorious victories. Desperate to find meaning in life, Grendel encountered the dragon (Arthur Dignam), who informed Grendel that his sole purpose in life is to terrify humanity, thus stimulating human imagination and encouraging social cohesion. Grendel accepts his new role and regularly visits the king's mead hall to frighten Hrothgar's people and devour them. He stops short of killing the king himself and the warrior Unferth (Ric Stone), whose delusions of grandeur and passive opposition to the king amuse Grendel. Feeling sympathy for Hrothgar's miserable wife Wealhtheow, who is also the object of Unferth's secret affection, Grendel decides to finally kill Hrothgar and take her to his lair. Before Grendel can arrive, the meadhall is visited by the hero Beowulf (also voiced by Dignam), who kills Unferth on the increasingly paranoid Hrothgar's orders. Beowulf then ambushes Grendel and tears off his arm, leaving the monster to die outside as he ponders over the accidental nature of his death. Production and release Stitt acquired the film rights to Grendel in 1978, and work was commenced at Melbourne Al et al. Studios the following year. The film was conceived as a coproduction with producer Phillip Adams, under the banner of Animation Australia. Although completed in 1981, it was not released in US theatres until the spring of 1982. Because of its limited appeal, broadcasting of the film was largely restricted to art theatres in urban centres.Beck, Jerry (2005), The Animated Movie Guide, Chicago Review Press, p. 99, References External links  Grendel Grendel Grendel at the National Film and Sound Archive *Grendel Grendel Grendel at Oz Movies *Grendel Grendel Grendel at Just Watch 1981 animated films 1981 films Australian animated films Films based on Beowulf Animated films based on novels Films based on American novels Films based on Norse mythology Films set in Denmark Films set in the 6th century Australian films Films scored by Bruce Smeaton ","title":"Grendel Grendel Grendel"},{"id":"2983370","title":"Girlfriend (album)"},{"id":"2983381","text":"Frank G.

The brain can shift across such structures as the falx cerebri, the tentorium cerebelli, and even through the foramen magnum (the hole in the base of the skull through which the spinal cord connects with the brain). Herniation can be caused by a number of factors that cause a mass effect and increase intracranial pressure (ICP): these include traumatic brain injury, intracranial hemorrhage, or brain tumor. Herniation can also occur in the absence of high ICP when mass lesions such as hematomas occur at the borders of brain compartments. In such cases local pressure is increased at the place where the herniation occurs, but this pressure is not transmitted to the rest of the brain, and therefore does not register as an increase in ICP. Because herniation puts extreme pressure on parts of the brain and thereby cuts off the blood supply to various parts of the brain, it is often fatal. Therefore, extreme measures are taken in hospital settings to prevent the condition by reducing intracranial pressure, or decompressing (draining) a hematoma which is putting local pressure on a part of the brain. Signs and symptoms Decorticate posturing, with elbows, wrists and fingers flexed, and legs extended and rotated inward Brain herniation frequently presents with abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs indicative of severe brain damage. These patients have a lowered level of consciousness, with Glasgow Coma Scores of three to five. One or both pupils may be dilated and fail to constrict in response to light. Vomiting can also occur due to compression of the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata. Severe headaches and seizures as a result of increased intracranial pressure are not uncommon. Cardiovascular and pulmonary symptoms may also be present as the brain loses function, but might also be associated with bleeding. They can include: hypertension, respiratory depression, arrhythmia and in severe cases cardiac arrest.  Causes  Causes of brain herniation include: * Brain edema * Hematoma * Stroke * Tumour * Infection Diagnosis =Classification= Types of brain herniation 1) Uncal 2) Central 3) Cingulate or sub/trans- falcine 4) Transcalvarial 5) Upward 6) Tonsillar The tentorium is an extension of the dura mater that separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum. There are two major classes of herniation: supratentorial and infratentorial. Supratentorial refers to herniation of structures normally found above the tentorial notch, and infratentorial refers to structures normally found below it.Orlando Regional Healthcare, Education and Development. 2004. \\"Overview of Adult Traumatic Brain Injuries.\\" Retrieved on January 16, 2008. * Supratentorial herniation # Uncal (transtentorial) # Central # Cingulate (subfalcine/transfalcine) # Transcalvarial # Tectal (posterior) * Infratentorial herniation 5. Upward (upward cerebellar or _upward_ transtentorial) 6. Tonsillar (downward cerebellar) Uncal herniation In uncal herniation, a common subtype of transtentorial herniation, the innermost part of the temporal lobe, the uncus, can be squeezed so much that it moves towards the tentorium and puts pressure on the brainstem, most notably the midbrain. The tentorium is a structure within the skull formed by the dura mater of the meninges. Tissue may be stripped from the cerebral cortex in a process called decortication. The uncus can squeeze the oculomotor nerve (a.k.a. CN III), which may affect the parasympathetic input to the eye on the side of the affected nerve, causing the pupil of the affected eye to dilate and fail to constrict in response to light as it should. Pupillary dilation often precedes the somatic motor effects of CN III compression called oculomotor nerve palsy or third nerve palsy. This palsy presents as deviation of the eye to a \\"down and out\\" position due to loss of innervation to all ocular motility muscles except for the lateral rectus (innervated by abducens nerve (a.k.a. CN VI) and the superior oblique (innervated by trochlear nerve a.k.a. CN IV). The symptoms occur in this order because the parasympathetic fibers surround the motor fibers of CN III and are hence compressed first. Compression of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery will result in ischemia of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex and contralateral visual field deficits in both eyes (contralateral homonymous hemianopsia). Another important finding is a false localizing sign, the so-called Kernohan's notch, which results from compression of the contralateralRobins Basic Pathology cerebral crus containing descending corticospinal and some corticobulbar tract fibers. This leads to Ipsilateral hemiparesis in reference to the herniation and contralateral hemiparesis with reference to the cerebral crus. With increasing pressure and progression of the hernia there will be distortion of the brainstem leading to Duret hemorrhages (tearing of small vessels in the parenchyma) in the median and paramedian zones of the mesencephalon and pons. The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to decorticate posture, respiratory center depression and death. Other possibilities resulting from brain stem distortion include lethargy, slow heart rate, and pupil dilation. Uncal herniation may advance to central herniation. The sliding uncus syndrome represents uncal herniation without alteration in the level of consciousness and other sequelae mentioned above. Central herniation In central herniation, the diencephalon and parts of the temporal lobes of both of the cerebral hemispheres are squeezed through a notch in the tentorium cerebelli. Transtentorial herniation can occur when the brain moves either up or down across the tentorium, called ascending and descending transtentorial herniation respectively; however descending herniation is much more common. Downward herniation can stretch branches of the basilar artery (pontine arteries), causing them to tear and bleed, known as a Duret hemorrhage. The result is usually fatal. Other symptoms of this type of herniation include small, fixed pupils withToronto Notes paralysis of upward eye movement giving the characteristic appearance of \\"sunset eyes\\". Also found in these patients, often as a terminal complication is the development of diabetes insipidus due to the compression of the pituitary stalk. Radiographically, downward herniation is characterized by obliteration of the suprasellar cistern from temporal lobe herniation into the tentorial hiatus with associated compression on the cerebral peduncles. Upwards herniation, on the other hand, can be radiographically characterized by obliteration of the quadrigeminal cistern. Intracranial hypotension syndrome has been known to mimic downwards transtentorial herniation. Cingulate herniation Subfalcine herniation on CT In cingulate or subfalcine herniation, the most common type, the innermost part of the frontal lobe is scraped under part of the falx cerebri, the dura mater at the top of the head between the two hemispheres of the brain.Dawodu ST. 2007. Traumatic brain injury: Definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology. Emedicine.com. Retrieved on January 28, 2007. Cingulate herniation can be caused when one hemisphere swells and pushes the cingulate gyrus by the falx cerebri. This does not put as much pressure on the brainstem as the other types of herniation, but it may interfere with blood vessels in the frontal lobes that are close to the site of injury (anterior cerebral artery), or it may progress to central herniation. Interference with the blood supply can cause dangerous increases in ICP that can lead to more dangerous forms of herniation. Symptoms for cingulate herniation are not well defined. Usually occurring in addition to uncal herniation, cingulate herniation may present with abnormal posturing and coma. Cingulate herniation is frequently believed to be a precursor to other types of herniation. Transcalvarial herniation In transcalvarial herniation, the brain squeezes through a fracture or a surgical site in the skull. Also called \\"external herniation\\", this type of herniation may occur during craniectomy, surgery in which a flap of skull is removed, the protruding brain region preventing the piece of skull from being replaced during the operation. Upward herniation Increased pressure in the posterior fossa can cause the cerebellum to move up through the tentorial opening in upward, or cerebellar herniation. The midbrain is pushed through the tentorial notch upward. This is also known as ascending transtentorial herniation since it occurs across the tentorium cerebelli. Tonsillar herniation In tonsillar herniation, also called downward cerebellar herniation, transforaminal herniation, or \\"coning\\", the cerebellar tonsils move downward through the foramen magnum possibly causing compression of the lower brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord as they pass through the foramen magnum. Increased pressure on the brainstem can result in dysfunction of the centers in the brain responsible for controlling respiratory and cardiac function. The most common signs are intractable headache, head tilt, and neck stiffness due to tonsillar impaction. The level of consciousness may decrease and also give rise to flaccid paralysis. Blood pressure instability is also evident in these patients. Tonsillar herniation of the cerebellum is also known as a Chiari malformation (CM), or previously an Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM). There are four types of Chiari malformation, and they represent very different disease processes with different symptoms and prognosis. These conditions can be found in asymptomatic patients as an incidental finding, or can be so severe as to be life-threatening. This condition is now being diagnosed more frequently by radiologists, as more patients undergo MRI scans of their heads, especially upright MRI, which is more than twice as sensitive for detecting this condition. Cerebellar tonsillar ectopia (CTE) is a term used by radiologists to describe cerebellar tonsils that are \\"low lying\\" but that do not meet the radiographic criteria for definition as a Chiari malformation. The currently accepted radiographic definition for a Chiari malformation is that cerebellar tonsils lie at least 5mm below the level of the foramen magnum. Some clinicians have reported that some patients appear to experience symptoms consistent with a Chiari malformation without radiographic evidence of tonsillar herniation. Sometimes these patients are described as having a 'Chiari [type] 0'. There are many suspected causes of tonsillar herniation including: decreased or malformed posterior fossa (the lower, back part of the skull) not providing enough room for the cerebellum; hydrocephalus or abnormal CSF volume pushing the tonsils out; or dural tension pulling the brain caudally. Connective tissue disorders, such as Ehlers Danlos syndrome, can be associated. For further evaluation of tonsillar herniation, CINE flow studies are used. This type of MRI examines flow of CSF at the cranio-cervical joint. For persons experiencing symptoms but without clear MRI evidence, especially if the symptoms are better in the supine position and worse upon standing/upright, an upright MRI may be useful. File:Brain herniation.jpg File:Brain herniation2.jpg Treatment MRI showing damage due to herniation. This patient was left with residual disabilities including those involving movement and speech. Treatment involves removal of the etiologic mass and decompressive craniectomy. Brain herniation can cause severe disability or death. In fact, when herniation is visible on a CT scan, the prognosis for a meaningful recovery of neurological function is poor. The patient may become paralyzed on the same side as the lesion causing the pressure, or damage to parts of the brain caused by herniation may cause paralysis on the side opposite the lesion. Damage to the midbrain, which contains the reticular activating network which regulates consciousness, will result in coma. Damage to the cardio-respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata will cause respiratory arrest and (secondarily) cardiac arrest. Investigation is underway regarding the use of neuroprotective agents during the prolonged post-traumatic period of brain hypersensitivity associated with the syndrome.

He died when she was 80 years old. She supported herself by selling fish in and around Brighton, and her evidence was instrumental in securing the conviction and execution of highwayman James Rooke. In old age, she sold small items, such as oranges and gingerbread, on a street corner near the Brighton Pavilion. She became well known in Brighton, due to her great age and unusual experiences. She was forced into the workhouse, but was granted a pension of half a guinea a week by the Prince Regent in 1808. She attended his coronation parade in Brighton in 1820. She was 108 when she died.

It may be managed by the state or by private enterprise. In the latter case a customs bond must be posted with the government. This system exists in all developed countries of the world. Upon entry of goods into the warehouse, the importer and warehouse proprietor incur liability under a bond. This liability is generally cancelled when the goods are: *exported; or deemed exported; *withdrawn for supplies to a vessel or aircraft in international traffic; *destroyed under Customs supervision; or *withdrawn for consumption domestically after payment of duty. While the goods are in the bonded warehouse, they may, under supervision by the customs authority, be manipulated by cleaning, sorting, repacking, or otherwise changing their condition by processes that do not amount to manufacturing. After manipulation, and within the warehousing period, the goods may be exported without the payment of duty, or they may be withdrawn for consumption upon payment of duty at the rate applicable to the goods in their manipulated condition at the time of withdrawal. In the United States, goods may remain in the bonded warehouse up to five years from the date of importation.Section 311 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. 1311 Bonded warehouses provide specialized storage services such as deep freeze or bulk liquid storage, commodity processing, and coordination with transportation, and are an integral part of the global supply chain. Types of bonded warehouses Depending on the country or region, there are various options for the storage of goods in a bonded warehouse. =Temporary storage premises (RTO)= Temporary storage premises offer the possibility of storing goods that enter the customs territory of the EU awaiting further customs-approved use or treatment. =Type B customs warehouse= The type B customs warehouse is a public customs warehouse. This means that the administrator (warehouse keeper) can make the premises available to anyone that wants to store goods under customs control. It is also known as Public Customs Bonded Warehouses. Certain examples of TypeB customs warehouse in Asian countries are Central Warehousing Corporation, Concor, State Warehousing Corporation, DHL Public Bonded Warehouses, Contegrate Entrepot Public Bonded Warehouses, Allcargo Custom Bonded Warehouses and many more. Type B Warehouses are licensed by the concerned Customs authorities to act as custodian and escrow to store goods till Duty is paid by the importers. =Type C customs warehouse= A type C customs warehouse is a private customs warehouse. This means that only the administrator of the customs warehouse (warehouse keeper) can store goods in it. These goods do not have to be his property, for that matter: he can also store goods on behalf of others. In that case as well, the warehouse keeper will remain responsible to Customs for the goods kept in storage. The warehouse keeper is also the person that has to provide security to Customs. Type C Warehouses are importer specific Warehouses wherein goods of only the specific licensed importers may be stored in the warehouse. Such Warehouses are also called as Private Bonded Warehouses. =Type D and E customs warehouses= Type D and E customs warehouses are private customs warehouses, which means that only the administrator (warehouse keeper) is allowed to store goods in them. =Free warehouse= A Public Bonded Warehouse is a building or premises guarded and locked by Customs. Within this building or these premises, anyone can store goods. =Special economic zone or Free zone= Unlike a free warehouse, a special economic zone is not a building or premises, but a location. This location is a geographical area which has been carefully charted and recorded. Sometimes these areas are known as bonded logistics parks. =Implementation= Depending on different countries, it is difficult to choose what kind of warehouse should be chosen for different situations, for example, goods may be entered for temporary warehouse and afterwards for consuming locally or they may be transported out-bound to another country and are placed in warehouse for a while, or they are entered for warehouse waiting for retailers to transfer them. Under such a complex circumstances, many importers and exporters try to use automation to help manage issues in bonded warehouse which, to some extent, can respond rapidly to customer orders and dispatch products =Aircraft and Ship stores= Bonded store is place where they place those items which are not declared either serviceable or un-serviceable. History Mason Transfer and Grain Co., bonded warehouse on the South Texas Border. Taken by Robert Runyon sometime between 1900 and 1920. Previous to the establishment of bonded warehouses in England the payment of duties on imported goods had to be made at the time of importation, or a bond with security for future payment given to the revenue authorities. The inconveniences of this system were many: * It was not always possible for the importer to find sureties, and he had often to make an immediate sale of the goods, in order to raise the duty, frequently selling when the market was depressed and prices low. * The duty, having to be paid in a lump sum, raised the price of the goods by the amount of the interest on the capital required to pay the duty. * Competition was stifled from the fact that large capital was required for the importation of the more heavily taxed articles. To obviate these difficulties and to put a check upon frauds on the revenue, Robert Walpole proposed in his \\"excise scheme\\" of 1733, the system of warehousing for tobacco and wine. The proposal was unpopular, and it was not until 1803 that the system was actually adopted. That year, imported goods were to be placed in warehouses approved by the customs authorities, and importers were to give bonds for payment of duties when the goods were removed. The Customs Consolidation Act 1853 dispensed with the giving of bonds, and laid down various provisions for securing the payment of customs duties on goods warehoused. These provisions are contained in the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, and the amending statutes, the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1880, and the Revenue Act of 1883. The warehouses are known as \\"king's warehouses\\", and section 284 of the Customs Consolidation Act defined them as \\"any place provided by the crown or approved by the commissioners of customs, for the deposit of goods for security thereof, and the duties due thereon\\". By section 12 of the act, the treasury may appoint warehousing ports or places, and the commissioners of customs may from time to time approve and appoint warehouses in such ports or places where goods may be warehoused or kept and fix the amount of rent payable in respect of the goods. The proprietor or occupier of every warehouse so approved (except existing warehouses of special security in respect of which security by bond has hitherto been dispensed with), or some one on his behalf, must, before any goods be warehoused therein, give security by bond, or such other security as the commissioners may approve of, for the payment of the full duties chargeable on any goods warehoused therein, or for the due exportation thereof (s. 13). All goods deposited in a warehouse, without payment of duty on the first importation, upon being entered for home consumption, are chargeable with existing duties on like goods under any customs acts in force at the time of passing such entry (section 19). The act also prescribes various rules for the unshipping, landing, examination, warehousing and custody of goods, and the penalties on breach. The system of warehousing has proved of great advantage both to importers and purchasers, as the payment of duty is deferred until the goods are required, while the title deeds, or warrants, are transferable by endorsement. While the goods are in the warehouse (\\"in bond\\") the owner may subject them to various processes necessary to fit them for the market, such as the repacking and mixing of tea, the racking, vatting, mixing and bottling of wines and spirits, the roasting of coffee, the manufacture of certain kinds of tobacco, etc., and certain specific allowances are made in respect of waste arising from such processes or from leakage, evaporation and the like. Bonded warehousing exists in much of the developed world. They are of note in the United States for their role in the production of bottled in bond spirits.

Paul Burlison (February 4, 1929 - September 27, 2003) was an American pioneer rockabilly guitarist and a founding member of The Rock and Roll Trio. Burlison was born in Brownsville, Tennessee, where he was exposed to music at an early age. After a stint in the United States Military, Burlison teamed up with Johnny and Dorsey Burnette to form The Rock and Roll Trio. The band released several singles, but failed to attain chart success. Paul is sometimes credited with being the first guitarist to intentionally record with a distorted electric guitar on the 1956 recordings, \\"Lonesome Train on a Lonesome Track\\" and \\"Honey Hush.\\" The Trio disbanded in the fall of 1957 and Burlison moved back to Tennessee to start a family. There he started his own electrical subcontracting business which he ran faithfully for twenty years, taking a break when the Trio reunited in the early 1980s. He released his only solo album in 1997, which received positive reviews. Burlison remained active in the music scene until his death in 2003. Burlison and his family lived in Brownsville until 1937. During the floods of that year, miserable economic conditions prompted the Burlison family to move to Memphis, Tennessee. In 1938, his brother-in-law, Earl Brooks began to teach him to play the guitar. As well as learning Brooks' Country influenced techniques, he also drew inspiration from watching Jesse Lee and Juanita Denson perform. Later, he would frequent the Blues joints along Beale Street. While he was still in high school, he would travel to the outskirts of West Memphis, Arkansas, to watch Chester Burnett (\\"Howlin' Wolf\\") play. Burlison also developed an interest in boxing and began training at the Dave Wells Community Center under the instruction of trainer, Jim Denson. He was to win the local welterweight championship, and was runner-up in the All-Navy Tournament 1947-48. Whilst competing in the 1949 Golden Gloves tournament, Denson introduced him to another young boxer, Dorsey Burnette. Dorsey Burnette would become a Golden Gloves welterweight champion. He had a younger brother, Johnny Burnette, who was a Golden Gloves lightweight champion fighter. Both brothers had a deep interest in music and it was through their mutual interest in both music and boxing that the three were to become close friends. Toward the end of the World War II Paul Burlison enlisted in the United States Navy (1946) He was only 17 years of age at the time and received an honorable discharge in 1949. Formation of the Trio After his discharge, Burlison returned to Memphis, where he would subsequently begin a daytime job at Crown Electric Company as an electrician. Crown Electric would also employ Dorsey Burnette as a journeyman/electrician and a young man named Elvis Presley as a truck driver. Burlison did not lose his interest in music and he began picking up blues session work at a pre-Elvis Sun Records, where he recorded with various black artists, most notably Howlin' Wolf. He also found work playing with Clyde Leoppard and the Snearly Ranch Boys and he was also heard on the radio with Don Paul. Later, he would join the Shelby Follin Band, with whom he would play until 1954. For a few months he and band-mate Smokey Joe Baugh also performed with Howlin' Wolf on radio KWEM in West Memphis, Arkansas. The Rock and Roll Trio, from left to right, Paul Burlison, Johnny Burnette, and Dorsey Burnette. Burlison began or renewed his friendship with the Burnette Brothers, depending upon which discharge date is correct. All three had an interest in music and in 1952 or 1953 they formed a group, which may have been called \\"The Rhythm Rangers\\" at that time. Johnny Burnette sang the vocals and played acoustic guitar, Dorsey Burnette played bass and Burlison played lead guitar. It was during the early fifties that the group would play in and around Memphis at the local honkytonks. These were the days of the jitterbug and bop, and to keep the honkytonk managers happy without the big band, and to keep the patrons on the dance floor, the group would play an upbeat version of blues and country called rockabilly. In 1956, the three young men moved to New York City, where they managed to get a contract with Coral Records and record their rockabilly music under the name The Rock and Roll Trio. The Trio had five recording sessions between May and July 1956; two single records were released, one in June and the other in July 1956. Despite promotional appearances on Dick Clark's American Bandstand, Steve Allen's Tonight Show and Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall, these singles failed to make the charts. The Trio then went on a summer tour with Carl Perkins and Gene Vincent, picking up a drummer, Tony Austin, who was a cousin of Carl Perkins on the way. On September 9, 1956 they appeared in the final of the Ted Mack Original Amateur Hour at Madison Square Garden. A third single was released in October 1956, but it failed to chart. In the Fall of 1956, at a gig at Niagara Falls a fight broke out and Dorsey Burnette quit the group. He was rapidly replaced by Johnny Black, the brother of Elvis's bassist Bill Black. The revised line-up appeared in Alan Freed's movie Rock, Rock, Rock, where they mimed to \\"Lonesome Train (On A Lonesome Track)\\". This was released as a single in January 1957, but it failed to produce any chart success. Brief hiatus After a brief trip to California to join the Burnette Brothers, Burlison returned to Memphis and retired from the music business to start a family. In 1960, he also started his own electrical subcontracting company, \\"Safety Electrical\\" devoting his time and energy to his business and to his family for the next twenty years. His company was successful and in subsequent years, he also operated a mail-order business specializing in rare recordings. The Burnette brothers moved to California and continued to have sporadic success in the music industry until the end of the decade. In 1960, Johnny Burnette had two major hits as a solo artist with \\"Dreamin'\\" and \\"You're Sixteen,\\" and Dorsey Burnette had Top 30 and Top 50 hits, again as a solo artist, with \\"Tall Oak Tree\\" and \\"Hey Little One\\". After \\"Dreamin'\\" had become a hit, Johnny Burnette offered Burlison a spot in his road band, but Burlison refused. By 1963, Johnny's career was in decline and in an effort to revive it he wanted to reprise some of the old material. Burlison joined Johnny on a short swing through the Mid South after his regular guitarist broke two of his fingers. They even planned to go to England together, but Burlison fell ill and he went back to Memphis and his contracting business. Rock and roll revival Paul Burlison returned to the music scene in the 1980s, first with Johnny Black and Tony Austin in a recreation of the \\"Trio\\". He also launched his own Rock-A- Billy record label to release Johnny Burnette's Rock and Roll Trio and Their Rockin' Friends from Memphis, an all-star tribute to the memories of Johnny and Dorsey Burnette featuring local legends like Eddie Bond, Jim Dickinson and Charlie Feathers. In 1986, Burlison joined the Sun Rhythm Section, an oldies group, which included amongst others D J Fontana, Elvis's former drummer. In 1990, he signed on with Rocky Burnette's rockabilly revival band. Solo album In 1997, Burlison cut his first ever solo LP Train Kept A-Rollin' on Sweetfish Records as a tribute to The Rock and Roll Trio. The LP contained eleven tracks, three of which, \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\", \\"Lonesome Tears in My Eyes\\" and \\"Lonesome Train (on a Lonesome Track)\\", had been featured on The Rock and Roll Trio's original 1956 album. The album featured such guest artists as Rocky Burnette (Johnny's son), Billy Burnette (Dorsey's son) of Fleetwood Mac, Rick Danko and Levon Helm of The Band, David Hidalgo, Cesar Rosas, and Conrad Lozano of Los Lobos, Mavis Staples and Kim Wilson of The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Death and legacy Paul Burlison died on September 27, 2003 in Horn Lake, Mississippi after a long battle with colon cancer. He was interred in Hinds Chapel Cemetery, Lake Cormorant, Mississippi. Rocky and Billy Burnette helped eulogize their fathers' bandmate at the funeral. Many guitarists have claimed to have been influenced by Paul Burlison. These include Jimmy Page, Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton. Additionally, The Beatles, The Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith have played cover versions of The Rock and Roll Trio's hits, often with special emphasis on Burlison's guitar riffs. Paul Burlison was also a mentor to the Rockabilly band The Dempseys (Brad Birkedahl, \\"Slick\\" Joe Fick and Ron Perrone Jr). The Dempseys have had modest success around the world for their rockabilly style, honed around Memphis and alongside a willing mentor in Burlison. They also played Elvis Presley's band in the Oscar-winning film Walk the Line. Burlison played on their first album, a cassette album recorded at Sam Phillips' Studios in Memphis, TN. He also was pictured on their first CD album, Drinking Songs for Your Grandparents and provided an introductory track, playing on a few more. That cover also pictured Cordell Jackson.

These arms were adopted provisionally and then definitively by the same laws that adopted the Panamanian flag. Description The center section contains the Isthmus of Panama. The chief or top part of the coat of arms comprises two quarters. The top left over a field of silver a sword and a rifle. In 1904, the arms were made official by Law 64 of 4 June 1904 signed by the President of Assembly Genaro Ortega, and sanctioned by the President the Republic, Manuel Amador Guerrero. The official description of the heraldic design is as follows: *\\"It rests on a green field, symbol of the vegetation; it is of pointed form and it is intervened as far as the division. The center shows the Isthmus with its seas and sky, in which the moon begins to rise above the waves and the sun begins to hide behind the mountain, marking thereby the solemn hour of the declaration of our independence. The head is divided in two quarters: in the one of the right hand, in the silver field, a sword and a gun are hung meant as abandonment for always to the civil wars, causes of our ruin; in the one of the left-hand side, and on field of gules, a crossed shovel and a grub hoe are shown shining, to symbolize the work \\" *\\"The end of the coat of arms also is divided in two quarters: the one of the right-hand side, in blue field, shows a cornucopia, emblem of the wealth; and the one of the left-hand side, in field of silver, the winged wheel, symbol of the progress. Behind the shield and covering it with his opened wings, is the eagle, emblem of the sovereignty, the head turned towards the left, and takes in the tip a silver tape, which hangs from right to left. On the tape the following motto is printed \\"Pro Mundi Beneficio \\" \\"On the eagle, in arc form, ten gold stars go in representation of the provinces in which the Republic is divided. Like decorative accessories, to each side of the coat of arms two gathered national flags go on the other hand below\\" *For thirty-seven years the Coat of Arms of the Republic of Panama was not changed until the Constitution of 1941 was promulgated. The National Assembly dictated in March of this year Law 28 on the Coat of Arms, in which the following reforms were introduced: the saber and the gun are meant as attitude of alert in defense of our sovereignty, in the place of \\"abandonment to mean good bye to the civil wars \\". 311 projects appeared to change the motto and the Jury named to make the selection decided for: \\"Solo Dios sobre Nosotros\\" (Only God Above Us). Nevertheless, the National Assembly when approving the Law 28 already referred to, rejected it and preferred the one of \\"Justice, Honor and Freedom \\". Five years later, in 1946, Panama returned to the old symbol with the well-known motto of \\"Pro Mundi Beneficio \\". The formal adoption and regulation of the use of the national flag, anthem and coat of arms were decreed by law 34 of 1949. Harpy Eagle Law Green background Law 34 of 1949 stated, as noted above, that an eagle was to be on the top of the coat of arms. However, it did not specify what species of eagle, even though in most schools the harpy eagle was the eagle species on top of the coat of arms. Law 18 of 2002 made the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) the national bird; and to specify what species of eagle was to be on the coat of arms, on May 17, 2006, law 50 was approved by the national Assembly to modify law 18 of 2002, and add that the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) was the species of eagle that appears on the coat of arms of the Republic of Panama.Text of Modification of law 18, 2002, Panama's National Assembly References See also *Flag of Panama External links Panama National symbols of Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama Panama ","title":"Coat of arms of Panama"},{"id":"2983471","text":"Mark of Nun's grave, Timnat Serah Nun , in the Hebrew Bible, was a man from the Tribe of Ephraim, grandson of Ammihud, son of Elishama, and father of Joshua ().

Letters were by cartoonist and letterer Ed King of the Star Wars comic strip. The art for the first few issues of Evangeline was unusual for the time period, in that it was not printed using process color, but instead each page was hand-painted by Hunt and then color separated. This method was introduced by the newly formed independent comic companies and was encouraged by the cheaper printing methods of the 1980s. Cover paintings were also illustrated by Hunt and Villagran. The title character has been described as \\"a sexy killer vigilante nun\\" taking her instructions directly from her mentor, Cardinal Szn, a politically powerful figure in the hierarchy of the Roman Curia/Vatican during the 23rd-century. However, co-creator Hunt would describe her skilled but naive feminist character as created \\"to explore the infinite conflict between good and evil and the powerful religions which would be involved in manipulating the politics and economics of the future\\".

The film stars Milla Jovovich as Violet Song, Cameron Bright as Six, and Nick Chinlund as Ferdinand Daxus. It was released in North America on March 3, 2006. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 27, 2006. The film follows Violet Song Jat Shariff (Jovovich), a woman infected with hemoglophagia, a fictional vampire-like disease, in a future dystopia where anyone infected with the contagious disease is immediately sentenced to death. With her advanced martial arts skills, a group of rebel hemophages, and a boy named Six (Bright), whose blood may contain a cure for the disease, Violet goes on a mission to overthrow the futuristic government and defeat Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund). A novelization of the film was written by Yvonne Navarro, with more back-story and character development. The book differs from the film in a number of ways, including a more ambiguous ending and the removal of some of the plot twists. An anime series titled Ultraviolet: Code 044 was released by the Japanese anime satellite television network Animax, and created by Madhouse. Plot In the year 2078, following a global pandemic that causes vampire-like symptoms, including super-human physical abilities, a healing factor and elongated canines. The infected \\"hemophages\\" die within twelve years after being infected. The \\"Archministry\\", a militant medical group headed by Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus, has taken control of the government and begun rounding up infected citizens and exterminating them in order to contain the virus. Having been infected a decade earlier, Violet Song Jat Shariff has become a member of an underground resistance movement fighting to protect the hemophages from the government. Working with the resistance, Violet steals a weapon that was supposedly designed to exterminate all hemophages, only to discover that it is a young boy named \\"Six\\". Rather than kill the child, Violet flees with him, believing that a cure for the disease can be reverse-engineered from the antigens before he dies from them. Violet eventually converses with Daxus, who tells her that the boy is his son, but she does not believe him. Instead she takes him to her friend Garth, who tells her the boy has no antigens and he has no value to anyone. Garth also tells her that the boy has a tracking device embedded in him (\\"so hot he's nearly radioactive\\"), that they can track him easily and he has only 8 hours to live. In the meantime, Violet's resistance handler Nerva reveals to her that the antigens in Six's blood are actually deadly to humans. Furthermore, Daxus clarifies that the boy is his clone, his previous claim to her being a ruse to earn her sympathy. Since the hemophages are nearly exterminated, the Archministry intends to engineer a new plague to maintain its power. When Daxus refuses to give her the cure, Violet escapes with Six and lets him spend his last moments at a playground. Daxus arrives, shoots Violet, and takes Six's body for dissection. Violet is revived in the facility run by Garth, and she realizes that Six might not actually be dead. Violet storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus is about to begin the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although it may be too late for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).

Production began in early February 2004 and was shot in various cities across China, most notably Hong Kong and Shanghai. Production was finished in late June 2004. The film was shot digitally on high-definition video using a Sony HDW-F900. In 2005, the film's trailer was leaked on the internet. Director Kurt Wimmer then visited several message boards and demanded all clips be removed in order to keep the film's plot a secret. The online fan community responded well to this, and all the clips were removed from distribution until the theatrical trailer was publicly released in January 2006. It uses \\"Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Edition)\\" by Rob Dougan as the soundtrackWhich also features on The Matrix soundtrack (though not in the trailer) as well as \\"24\\" by Jem. According to Rotten Tomatoes, Jovovich was not pleased with the PG-13 rated release print. She stated that she and Wimmer had been locked out of discussions of the film in the editing stages, and had not been allowed to see her own performance, which she felt might have been improved if she had had some input. Following his problems with the film, Wimmer has not directed another film since. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 8% approval rating, based on 83 reviews, with an average rating of 2.8 out of 10. The site's critical consensus states: \\"An incomprehensible and forgettable sci-fi thriller, Ultraviolet is inept in every regard.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 18 out of 100 based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating \\"Overwhelming dislike\\".Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade D+ on scale of A to F. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"The latest entry in the \\"This film is so bad we're not screening it for critics\\" genre.\\" He also criticizes the action scenes \\"Although extravagantly staged, they're more than a little derivative\\" and \\"Other sequences are rather more ridiculous\\". Robert Koehler of Variety magazine wrote: \\"Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film.\\" =Box office= Ultraviolet was released in North America on March 3, 2006. The film grossed $9,064,880 in its opening weekend; it grossed $18,535,812 domestically and $12,534,399 internationally, making for a worldwide gross of $31,070,211. The budget for Ultraviolet was estimated at $30 million. Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on June 27, 2006 in North America.Movies.go.com profile page detailing North American release date There are two versions of the film, an unrated version (94 minutes long) and a PG-13 version (88 minutes long). Additionally, the rough cut of the movie was originally close to two hours long; only 6 minutes of this lost half-hour was restored for the unrated cut. The North American, European, South American, Hong Kong, Korean Blu-ray is the PG-13 version of the film. This is because Sony previously would not allow Unrated or NC-17 content to be released on the then-newly released Blu-ray format, a clause which has since been lifted. However the Japanese Blu-ray does contain the 94 minute Unrated version of the film. The film performed quite well in the DVD market, grossing over $35.1 million in rental sales. In the end the film turned in a healthy profit of over $36 million.Rotten Tomatoes list of top grossing DVD rentals where Ultraviolet is featured at 37 as of September 17, 2006 (grossing $35.1 million) Despite this, there are no plans for a true restored Director's Cut. The DVD includes a four-part documentary: \\"UV Protection: The Making of Ultraviolet\\" and an audio commentary with Jovovich. Some editions additionally feature some deleted scenes which were cut from the final release. But not all footage from the unrated extended edition was in the deleted scenes feature. =Extended version= The extended DVD version includes additional footage, increasing the running time and adding more to the storyline / plot. In this release there are additional scenes which include: * A scene giving more in depth information on hemophagia. Including how it elongates canines, improves strength, speed, vision, hearing, bone strength and regenerative abilities, but reduces lifespan to approximately 12 years. * A flashback that gives more background information about Violet and depicts all the hardships she went through because of all the hemoglophagia testing and how it resulted in the termination of her pregnancy. * A scene (near the opening of the film) which explains that Violet has reached the end of her lifespan, and has only 36 hours left to live. * A later scene shows Violet's reaction to her estranged husband's creation of a new life. * A scene which depicts a conversation between Violet and Six which develops their characters. * The chase scene between Violet and the soldiers of Daxus is lengthened. * The level of blood and gore is also increased by a small amount. * The amount of action is also increased by a small amount.

The common thread of the interviews is Habermas's disagreement with resurgent German nationalism after the reunification with the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Habermas's theoretical works are in the background of the interviews. At the time of the interviews, in the early 1990s, Habermas was publishing Between Facts and Norms, his philosophy of law and politics, and writing the political- philosophical essays which would later be collected in the volumes published in English as Justification and Application and The Inclusion of the Other. In A Berlin Republic, Habermas wages an intellectual campaign in Germany's political public sphere against what he sees as the backward-looking influence of German political theorist and proponent of Nazism, Carl Schmitt, and the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Schmitt advocated a \\"normalizing\\" view of German history, whereby Communism and Nazism would be equated, and the continuity of a reunified Germany with her pre-1945 past would be affirmed. Habermas encourages Germans to think differently about 1945 and 1989. In Habermas's view, Germany must reject any thought of basing her reunified future on a continuation of notions such as German ethnic identity as a foundation for the German state, Germany as a potential political and military power in central Europe, an \\"eastern-oriented\\" foreign policy, and the notion of a \\"special path\\" (Sonderweg) for Germany separate from that of other Western democracies. The rationale Habermas gives is initially historical—if Germans face squarely their past, they cannot wish for any continuity with it that does not own it as tragic and catastrophic. This harks back to his earliest writings of the 1950s, collected in Philosophical-Political Profiles, in which he sees the only way forward for a German philosophy is to remember the German-Jewish philosophy that was obliterated in the Holocaust. Beyond this, however, are two considerations that for Habermas loom larger. The first concerns the process of globalization, in all its forms: worldwide communications, transnational corporations, systemic impacts of human activity on the natural environment, unprecedented immigration, dramatic improvements in transportation and communication technologies, and international organizations. Habermas agrees with British theoretical sociologist Anthony Giddens that globalization transforms the nature of politics and community. Although the nation-state was, in the 18th and 19th centuries an appropriate location and scale for the development of an emancipated political public sphere, by the aftermath of World War II this was no longer the case. As problems are global their solutions be as well. Therefore, only a global scale of decision-making is appropriate, and the foreign affairs of nations must all be seen as the domestic affairs of the global community. Based on his theoretical notion of societal legitimacy coming only from the active, ongoing consent of the people, Habermas shows how his notion of a political public sphere provides, by means of the deliberative agreements developed in radical liberal democracy, a way for people who formerly considered themselves strangers can come to see themselves as having a common self-interest at a larger social scale than they had previously imagined. The second larger consideration for Habermas is the supplanting of what he calls \\"constitutional patriotism\\" for ethnic nationalism as the substantial glue holding a diverse, pluralistic society together. In a \\"postmetaphysical\\" age, worldview pluralism means that people cannot base agreements at a political level on particular religious values. Similarly, in an age of immigration and retreating racism, it is no longer appropriate to build political consensus in the state primarily upon one culture's values over another's. Consequently, the only way forward is to expand the emancipatory potential already present even in culturally- or religiously-grounded democratic institutions—namely, that people come by practice to see that their own interests are best safeguarded in procedural systems of law and politics that systematically protect the interests of all equally. A dedication to such a political-legal system is what Habermas means by \\"constitutional patriotism,\\" as elaborated particularly in the essays later published as The Postnational Constellation.

One such custom is that of placing a few coins, newspapers, etc. within a cavity beneath the stone. Should the stone later be removed, the relics may be found. Though this tradition is still practiced, such memorials are deposited in the hope that they will never be disturbed. According to the above, the best succinct account of these rites was to be obtained in G. W. Speth's Builders' Rites and Ceremonies (1893). History Living victims were once entombed as a sacrifice to the gods and to ensure the stability of the building. Grimm remarked \\"It was often thought necessary to immure live animals and even men in the foundation, on which the structure was to be raised, to secure immovable stability.\\"Teutonic Mythology (1883–1884), (trans.

According to the poem, the wife of the chief builder was sacrificed to establish a good foundation for a bridge that was of grave importance to the secluded city of Arta. The actual bridge was constructed in 1602. A similar legend appears in the Romanian folk poem Meșterul Manole, about the building of the church in the earliest Wallachian capital city.

The focus is on user-centered change and participation in the creation of content and community. The concept of Library 2.0 borrows from that of Business 2.0 and Web 2.0 and follows some of the same underlying philosophies. This includes online services like the use of OPAC systems and an increased flow of information from the user back to the library. In Library 2.0, library services are constantly updated and reevaluated to best serve library users. Library 2.0 also attempts to harness the library user in the design and implementation of library services by encouraging feedback and participation. Proponents of this concept, sometimes referred to as Radical Trust, expect that the Library 2.0 model for service will ultimately replace traditional, one-directional service offerings that have characterized libraries for centuries.  Overview  The term \\"Library 2.0\\" was coined by Michael Casey on his blog Library Crunch as a direct start off of the terms Business 2.0 and Web 2.0. Casey suggested that libraries, especially public libraries, are at a crossroads where many of the elements of Web 2.0 have applicable value within the library community, both in technology-driven services and in non- technology based services. In particular, he described the need for libraries to adopt a strategy for constant change while promoting a participatory role for library users. Library 2.0 made its conference debut at Internet Librarian 2005 in October, 2005, when Michael Stephens of Saint Joseph County Public Library addressed the idea in relation to the typical library website. A September 2006 article in Library Journal titled, \\"Library 2.0: Service for the next-generation library,\\" begins by expressing the benefit of Library 2.0 to library administrators and taxpayers as providing \\"more efficient ways of delivering services to achieve greater returns on financial investments.\\" The article continued by asserting that the much discussed Library 2.0 is important for librarians as it may radically change our customer service and interaction. With Library 2.0, library services are frequently evaluated and updated to meet the changing needs of library users. Library 2.0 also calls for libraries to encourage user participation and feedback in the development and maintenance of library services. The active and empowered library user is a significant component of Library 2.0. With information and ideas flowing in both directions – from the library to the user and from the user to the library – library services have the ability to evolve and improve on a constant and rapid basis. The user is participant, co-creator, builder and consultant – whether the product is virtual or physical. An advantage in pursuing digital services is that the library can target more people - including those who may not have previously used the library service. A concern that Library 2.0 is trying to address is that potential users turn to Google and Wikipedia because they are \\"good enough\\", and perceive libraries to be slow and irrelevant.Miller, P., (2005). Web 2.0: Building the New Library. Ariadne, No.45 October 2005.  Key principles  * Browser + Web 2.0 Applications + Connectivity = Full-featured OPAC * Harness the library user in both design and implementation of services * Library users should be able to craft and modify library provided services * Harvest and integrate ideas and products from peripheral fields into library service models * Continue to examine and improve services and be willing to replace them at any time with newer and better services. In 2009, Holmberg et al. identified 7 key principles for Library 2.0: \\"interactivity, users, participation, libraries and library services, web and web 2.0, social aspects, and technology and tools\\", and offer the following definition for Library 2.0: \\"Library 2.0 is a change in interaction between users and libraries in a new culture of participation catalysed by social web technologies.\\"Holmberg, K., Huvila, I., Kronqvist-Berg, M. & Widén-Wulff, G. (2009). What is Library 2.0?. Journal of Documentation, 65(4): 668-681. Alex Byrne argues that the use of Web 2.0 strategies in the library context changes the role of librarian into someone who can assist in supporting clients information literacy across the \\"largely unknown informational universe\\" rather than helping them navigate the library's own collection.  Concerns and considerations  Some concerns about Library 2.0 relate to access to technology, privacy and security. For example, Casey and Savastinuk suggest allowing patrons to tag or blog anonymously. In 2006, Steve Lawson, humanities liaison librarian, wrote a blog post entitled, \\"A Library 2.0 skeptic's reading list\\" that collected links to blogs which discuss these concerns. Lawson says \\"I'm not anti-Library 2.0 ... I like to think of Library 2.0 as a continuing conversation about the future of libraries, and it makes sense to me to try to round up some voices that challenge Library 2.0 conventional wisdom.\\" Another concern is that the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies can allow users to spread hate speech and cyberbullying in the library system. It is suggested that librarians define hate speech in their user content policies and identify it when it occurs.Library 2.0 and the Problem of Hate Speech When using social networking through Facebook in a Swedish public library, librarians were described as 'always at the beck and call of Facebook', and capable of losing the relationships they'd built with their clients over the site due to glitches in Facebook.  Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC)  Library 2.0 is a new way of providing library service through new Internet technologies, with emphasis on “user-centered” change and interaction. Like Web 2.0, a full-featured Library 2.0 OPAC gets better the more that users are involved in the process of interacting with the catalog and sharing content. Librarians have been working to retool library catalogs in order to make them more useful for patrons to find, organize, and interact with information in a way that has infinite potential for user customization. These new types of catalogs are a shift from \\"isolated information silos\\" to \\"interlinked computing platforms.\\" In the past the information flow was mostly one way, from library to user. With new web tools information can be released to flow in every direction (library to user, user to library, library to library, and user to user). Jessamyn West, on her librarian.net website, authored \\"What We Want: An OPAC Manifesto,\\" which broke down the needs of library staff, geeks, and users in their OPAC. These valuable suggestions inform librarians of the flexibility, customizability and plain language approach that is desired by users in their OPAC. Librarians should be aware of these issues so that planning for improvement can begin. Nishat Kazi recommends that the clients interest area should be recorded when they join the library, and when they login to their account on the OPAC, new items which match their interests should be displayed to them. Kazi also recommends allowing clients to rank and review items in the OPAC, as well as giving other clients the opportunity to respond to these reviews. Key words can also be added by clients in addition to key words added by the librarian to facilitate searching.  Artificial intelligence and participatory library  In China a participatory library named Xiaotu was developed by Tsinghua University. Xiaotu is an artificial intelligence library that allows users to interact with it by talking or chatting through a mobile app or social network. It provides real-time virtual reference service combining Tsinghua University Library capabilities with social network and third-party resources. The system is composed by a self-learning function that receives updates from users as they find some missing or wrong information. Connected to the largest social network in China, it provides easy access and owns a book reading group accessed by Tsinghua University Students in China. Its knowledge base includes Wikipedia and its Chinese counterpart, content revised by professors of the university, frequently asked questions (FAQ) accumulated from the university library, and other third-party resources presented in the Chinese internet.  Debate  Library 2.0 has been a source of debate in the blogosphere. Some librarian bloggers have argued that these key principles are not new and have been part of the service philosophies of many library reformers since the 19th century. Others are calling for more concrete examples of how libraries can get to Library 2.0. Walt Crawford, for example, argues that Library 2.0 comprises a combination of tools and attitudes which are excellent ideas and not new to librarianship, a few business- and tool-focused attitudes which will not serve all users and user communities, and incorrectly places libraries as the appropriate source for all users to gather all information. Proponents of Library 2.0, such as Stephen Abram, Michael Stephens, Paul Miller and others, have spoken to these criticisms, arguing that while individual pieces of Library 2.0 may not be entirely new, the convergence of these service goals and ideas with many new Web 2.0 technologies has led to a new generation of library service. This includes the use of online social networks by libraries. Library 4.0 has been proposed as including makerspaces, context-aware technology, open source, big data, cloud services, augmented reality, and state-of-the-art displays.

In the heart of Igboland, the region includes several towns and cities. It is a group of indigenous clans, connected by intermarriage. With a population density of over 1,000 people per square kilometer, Mbaise is West Africa's most densely- populated area; its 2006 population was 611,204. The name \\"Mbaise\\" was derived from five clans: Agbaja, Ahiara, Ekwereazu, Ezi na Ihite and Oke Uvuru. The three local government areas of Mbaise cover about ; Aboh Mbaise covers , Ahiazu Mbaise covers , and Ezinihitte Mbaise covers . History Mbaise came under British rule in 1902 during the Anglo-Aro War, when the British Aro Expeditionary Force subdued the Aro Confederacy in Owerri and Mbaise. By 1906, at the conclusion of the operation, present-day Mbaise was united under British control with some local autonomy. To supervise the clans, a native court was established in Obohia in 1907 and transferred to Nguru in 1909. In 1929, the Nguru court was destroyed as a result of the Igbo Women's War. Regional courts were then opened in Obohia, Itu, Ife and Enyiogogu in response to the home rule movement of the 1930s. The region was united as a political and administrative unit in 1941. Councils were formed by 1945, loosely based on autonomous communities. It was from councils that The three local Governments were created from the councils. Ahiazu Mbaise was a merger of the Ahiara and Ekwerazu councils, and Aboh Mbaise was a merger of the Oke-Ovoro and Agbaja councils. Ezinihitte Mbaise remained by itself except for Isu Obiangwu and Umuohiagu,two small villages which joined the Ngor-Okpala from the Agbaja region. Until Europeans arrived in Nigeria, Mbaise's main source of income was subsistence agriculture. In Igboland, government was based on kinship and customs. The village group (a weekly gathering of men) was the highest level of organization, with the amala in power. The aladinma currently exercises power. Chinua Achebe described pre-colonial life in his novel, Things Fall Apart. When the British colonial administration was introduced in the Southern Protectorate of Nigeria, the government established a native court at Nkwogwu Nguru in 1905 and built a residence for the British there. Dr. Rogers Stewart, who took a wrong turn on his bicycle, was captured and killed in a case of mistaken identity. The 1906 Ahiara Punitive Expedition, led by Captains Brian Douglas and Harold Hastings, began reprisals in the region. In 1927, the colonial government introduced taxation. Taxes were increased in 1929, and the Women's War began to protest social and economic oppression. The native court at Nkwogwu was destroyed and the governor's residence was sacked. Courts were established in Itu (for Ezinihitte); Afor Enyiogugu (for Agbaja); Obohia (for Ekwerazu); Orie-Ahiara (for Ahiara); and Uvuru (for Oke-Uvuru). On June 12, 1941, Mbaise became a federation of five clans: the Agbaja (Nguru, Okwuato, Enyiogugu, Obiangwu, and Umuohiagu), Ekwerazu, Ahiara, Ezinihitte, and Oke-Uvuru. A treasury was opened in Enyiogugu in 1942, and was transferred to Aboh in 1948. Obiangwu and Umuohiagu, which had been parts of Agbaja, joined Ngor Okpala in 1957. Mbaise now had three local governments: Ahiazu, Aboh-Mbaise, and Ezinihitte. Between 1955 and 1958, the Mbaise County Council began two landmark development projects: Mbaise Secondary School and Mbaise Joint Hospital (now General Hospital), both in Aboh. Culture and demographics The people are predominantly Igbo. About 55 percent are Catholics, 35 percent are Protestants and other religions make up the remainder. Some cultural and traditional ceremonies have survived Western influence. The eight-day Ahianjoku festival honored the yam deity; since 1946, the annual August 15 new-yam festival has been a Christian version of the Ahianjoku festival. Oji Ezinihitte celebrates the Ezinihitte on January 1 each year. Itu Aka, before the farming season, encourages the people to weather the environment, modernity and new challenges. A local salad, ugba, is served with raffia wine. Mbaise women are noted for their fertility. To be an eghu ukwu, a woman must bear at least 10 children; some women have given birth to as many as 15. Mbaise culture is rich in music and Igbo dance. Music is played on the wood xylophone, hand piano, long short and slit drums, pots, gongs, bamboo horn and calabash. There are dances for childbirth, marriage, funerals, communal labor, and other social occasions. The agbacha ekurunwa dance is performed for childbirth, and alija and ogbongelenge are performed for marriage. Eseike, esse, ekwerikwe mgba and nkwa Ike are performed at funerals of men, and uko and Ekereavu for funerals of women. D. I. Nwoga, who brought an abigbo group to the United States during the 1980s, wrote that the musicians and dancers philosophize, criticize, admonish and praise with their performances.

It broadcast on 1600 kHz AM in Philadelphia before becoming Internet radio- only.WEXP RADIO IS BACK  History  :SourceGrabenstein, Brother Joseph. La Salle University Archives. WEXP File: La Salle University, October 2005 WEXP opened its studio at La Salle University in 1972. Initially, the radio station could only be heard inside the Student Union building, and the start-up price for the station was around US$7,500 ($1,000 of which came through a donation from U.S. Ambassador to Britain Walter H. Annenberg). Airing on 640 AM, “EXPlorer 64” was founded as a co-curricular activity, and was tied directly to the Marketing Department and the English Department’s Speech and Drama course. Much of WEXP’s early programming featured commentary opposing the Vietnam War, and oldies music. Coverage of La Salle basketball was also aired live from as far away as Arlington, Virginia. The station only aired from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. After operating (despite a weak signal) throughout the 1970s, WEXP suffered what would arguably be its biggest setback in 1980. On September 15, a student installed a transmitter to WEXP’s existing antenna on top of the Union building. The student did so “without consultation” and “exceeded FCC Federal Communications Commission capabilities”, according to federal documents dated in October. As a result of this setup, WEXP could be heard throughout the east coast. Listeners requested songs from as far away as Albany, New York, and the station could be heard as far south as Miami, Florida. FCC officials in Washington did not press any charges, which could have included a $10,000 fine and imprisonment for a year. The incident forced the university to shut down the radio station entirely, and led to an apparent distrust of the student organization for many years. WEXP was revived during the 1980s. The station featured mostly heavy metal music. This was in sharp contrast to previous formats, which included easy listening, adult contemporary, album-oriented rock, and freeform. After collapsing again in 1988, the station returned on 530 AM in 1989. “EXPress 530”, as the station was referred to, was again just a carrier current AM signal. In February 1988, the university had the opportunity to purchase WPWT 91.7 FM, and operate at an initial expense of $100,000. Many students, and most notably professors from the communication department, pushed for support of the project. The University Budget Committee, however, rejected the plan that would have given WEXP an FCC-regulated FM station with an annual operating budget of $50,000. In 1997, WEXP began simulcasting over La Salle 56 cable television, but the relationship between the two campus stations was short-lived. In 2000, a proposal to turn WEXP into a low-power FM station also failed. However, with the advent of computers in every dorm, where AM radios became scarcer to find, the station chose to embark on a primarily internet focus, setting up a partnership with Live365 beginning in 2002, later migrating its web streaming service to Shoutcast. The investment re-energized the station by recruiting more members and broadening listenership on campus and around the world. The station launched its online presence with a contest to win a free trip to the then Nokia Sugar Bowl in New Orleans for the first caller who could identify the tune \\"Slim Shady\\" by the artist Eminem from a Nokia ringtone. WEXP's format is not confined to any specific genre, but partners with local labels to introduce new artists to the airwaves. WEXP has featured live performances on its airwaves by many local bands, including James Dalton, Chris Meservey, Noringo, Rich Varevice, Matt Gauss Band, Cipher, How It Ends, Nook the Crook, Forever I Burn, Fall River, Falling Down, Jason Ager and the Three Formed Fates, The Divining, and Dead Again. Among several national notables, staff at WEXP live have also interviewed the members of Leftover Salmon, Rockapella, and Killswitch Engage, and also comedian Dane Cook, to promote each of their Philadelphia tour stops in 2003-2005. There are also a series of call-in and campus news/discussion shows that promote campus interactivity through the telephone, particularly during the late evening hours. From 2000-2009, WEXP students have broadcast live NCAA sporting events featuring La Salle University in football (discontinued), men's and women's soccer, men's and women's basketball, and baseball, promoting an interest in play-by-play announcing, and producing remote radio broadcasts. The longest running shows on WEXP were Steel Cage Radio (1999-2005) and Needle to the Groove with DJ Somavilla and DJ Helix (2000-2006). Another tradition of college radio that has continued to grow over the years was the annual free picnic, which was rebranded as WEXPfest in 2005.

Early life  Amadeo was born in Mancelos, a parish of Amarante. At the age of 18, he entered the Superior School of Fine Arts of Lisbon and one year later (on his 19th birthday) he went to Paris, where he intended to continue his studies but soon quit the architecture course and started studying painting. By then, he was especially experienced in caricatures. In 1908, he lived in number fourteen of the Cité de Falguière. There, he went to ateliers in the Académie des Beaux-Arts and the Viti Academy of the Catalan painter Anglada Camarasa. In 1910 he stayed for some months in Brussels and, in 1911, his works were displayed in the Salon des Indépendants. He became close friends with artists and writers such as Gertrude Stein, Juan Gris, Amedeo Modigliani, Alexander Archipenko, Max Jacob, the couple Robert Delaunay and Sonia Delaunay, and Constantin Brâncuși, as well as the German artist Otto Freundlich. He was also friends with the Italian Futurists Gino Severini and Umberto Boccioni. In 1913, Amadeo de Souza Cardoso participated in two seminal exhibitions: the Armory Show in the USA, that travelled to New York City, Boston, and Chicago, and the Erste Deutsche Herbstsalon at the Galerie Der Sturm in Berlin, Germany, directed by Herwarth Walden. Both exhibitions presented modern art to a public that was still not used to it. Amadeo was among the most commercially successful of the exhibitors at the Armory Show, as he sold seven of the eight works he had on display there. Amadeo met with Antoni Gaudí in Barcelona in 1914, and then left for Madrid, where the shock of World War I was already underway. His friend Amedeo Modigliani showed sculptures in his Paris studio. Amadeo returned then to Portugal where he married Lucie Meynardi Peccetto. He maintained contact with other Portuguese artists and poets such as Almada Negreiros, Santa-Rita Pintor and Teixeira de Pascoaes. On 25 October 1918, at the age of 30, he died in Espinho, of the Spanish flu. Career = Work = His early works, under the tutelage of the Spanish painter Anglada Camarasa, were stylistically close to impressionism. Around 1910, influenced both by cubism and by futurism, he became one of the first modern Portuguese painters. His style is aggressive and vivid both in form and colour and his works may seem random or chaotic in their compositional structure at first sight but are clearly defined and balanced. His more innovative paintings, such as \\"Trou de la Serrure\\", resemble collages and seem to pave the way to abstractionism or even dadaism. In 1912 he published an album with twenty drawings, and copied the story of Gustave Flaubert, \\"La Légende de Saint Julien to l'Hospitalier\\", in a calligraphic manuscript with illustrations, but these early works attracted little notice. In 1913 he exhibited eight works in the Armory Show in the USA, some of which are now in American museums. The following year, he returned to Portugal and initiated a great and meteoric career in the experimentation of new forms of expression. In 1917 Amadeo and other artists such as Santa-Rita and Fernando Pessoa participated in the magazine Portugal Futurista, which had only one edition published. In 1916, he displayed in Oporto 114 artworks with the heading \\"Abstraccionism\\", that also was displayed in Lisbon, one and another with newness and some scandal. Cubism was in expansion throughout Europe and was an important influence in his analytical cubism. Amadeo de Souza Cardoso explored expressionism and in his last works he tried new techniques and other forms of plastic expression. In 1925, a retrospective exhibition in France of the painter’s artwork was well received by the public and critics. Ten years later in Portugal, an award was created to distinguish modern painters: the Souza-Cardoso prize. Some of Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso's ink drawings, decorative but always figurative, slightly resemble those of Aubrey Beardsley.  Legacy  After his death, his work remained almost unknown until 1952, when a room dedicated to his paintings in Municipal Museum Amadeo Souza-Cardoso gained the public's attention. His work has been the subject of only two major retrospectives , the first in 1958 and more recently in 2016, at the Grand Palais in Paris. On 14 November 2012, Google celebrated his 125th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The duo Prussian Blue was formed in early 2003 by their mother April Gaede, who now goes by April Harrington. The twins referred to the Holocaust as a myth and promoted Holocaust denial and their group was described as racist and white supremacist. Lynx and Lamb were about 14 when they decided to cease touring. In a 2011 interview with The Daily, a U.S. and Australian news app, the twins renounced their previous politics. History Prussian blue residue on the gas chamber at Majdanek concentration camp In an interview with Vice Magazine, the twins stated, \\"Part of our heritage is German American. Also our eyes are blue, and Prussian Blue is just a really pretty color.\\" They also remarked, \\"there is also the discussion of the lack of 'Prussian Blue' coloring (Zyklon B residue) in the so-called gas chambers in the concentration camps. We think it might make people question some of the inaccuracies of the 'Holocaust' myth.\\" This is a reference to claims made by many Holocaust deniers that the Holocaust either did not happen or had far fewer victims than generally believed. Lynx and Lamb Gaede first performed together by singing at a white nationalist festival called \\"Eurofest\\" in 2001. They began learning how to play instruments in 2002 (Lamb plays the guitar and Lynx plays the violin). In the same year they appeared on a VH1 special called Inside Hate Rock. In 2003, they were featured in a Louis Theroux BBC documentary, entitled Louis and the Nazis, on racism and white supremacy in the United States. Lamb, Lynx, and their mother, April Gaede, also appeared in the low-budget 2003 horror film Dark Walker. The twins recorded and released a debut CD at the end of 2004 called Fragment of the Future (Resistance Records) which had both acoustic folk-rock and bubblegum- pop sounds. A year later, they recorded their second album, The Path We Chose, which has a more traditional rock sound including both acoustic and electric guitar. Most of the songs on the second album lack the racial and white supremacist overtones of Fragment of the Future and are about more mainstream subject matter, like boys, crushes, and dating. On October 20, 2005, Prussian Blue was featured in a critical segment on ABC's Primetime.Young Singers Spread Racist Hate, abcnews.go.com, October 20, 2005 A DVD, Blonde Hair Blue Eyes, featuring three music videos and some live performances, was released in 2005. The pair toured the United States in 2005. On August 22, 2006, they were again featured in a critical segment on ABC's Primetime. The twins moved with their mother and stepfather, Mark Harrington, and their younger half-sister, Dresden, from Bakersfield to Kalispell in Montana, in 2006; in their mother's words, Bakersfield was \\"not white enough.\\" Some of their new neighbors did not welcome them; many city residents passed out flyers warning people of the family's views, and signs proclaiming \\"No Hate Here\\" appeared on some windows around the town. Some of the people who passed out flyers received threatening letters from members of out-of-state white supremacist organizations. The Montana Human Rights Network planned a rally in Kalispell to protest against the family's racist views. The twins toured Europe in the summer of 2007, performing at events for white nationalist organizations. They also appeared as guests on The Political Cesspool. But as of early 2009, the band's website and MySpace page were no longer operational. Ideology The duo had strong ties to the National Vanguard organization, a \\"white nationalist\\" group formed by disaffected former members of the National Alliance. Their ideology has been described as racist and white supremacist by mainstream media outlets. The Daily Telegraph reported that, on stage, the twins executed Nazi salutes. According to ABC News, the girls were homeschooled by their mother, April Gaede, an activist and writer for the white nationalist organization National Vanguard. The twins' maternal grandfather, who lives in Squaw Valley, Fresno County, California, wears a Nazi swastika belt buckle; he also features the swastika on his truck and has registered it as a cattle brand. During their ABC interview, the twins said they believed that Adolf Hitler was a great man with good ideas, and they described the Holocaust as being exaggerated. They have also been criticized for stipulating that the goods they donated to Hurricane Katrina victims should only go to white people: \\"After a day of trying, the supplies ended up with few takers, dumped at a local shop that sells Confederate memorabilia.\\" A 2011 profile in The Daily describes the twins' rejection of some of their previous politics: > But after enrolling in public school and moving to Montana — a predominantly > white state, albeit one with a decidedly hippie-ish vibe — Lamb and Lynx > decided they simply no longer believed what they'd been taught. ...\\"I'm glad > we were in the band,\\" Lynx said, \\"but I think we should have been pushed > toward something a little more mainstream and easier for us to handle than > being front-men for a belief system that we didn't even completely > understand at that time. We were little kids. Despite this, they still made statements that were skeptical about elements of the Holocaust. Lyrics and influences About half of the songs on Prussian Blue's first album are covers of other songs put out by other white pride bands with one (Lamb Near the Lane) co-written by David Lane and a few of the others by Ian Stuart Donaldson and Ken McLellan. One of their infamous cover songs, \\"Victory Day\\", was a cover song from the racist band RaHoWa. Two of Prussian Blue's songs on their first album are dedicated to famous German Nazi and white nationalist activists, including Rudolf Hess and Robert Jay Mathews. One of those songs, dedicated to Donaldson, Mathews, Hess, and William L. Pierce, which was written by Lamb, is \\"Sacrifice\\". Another song, \\"Gone With the Breeze,\\" is dedicated to Mathews. The cover songs on their album invoke ideas like Valhalla and Vinland, taken from Norse mythology and sagas. Several songs, including \\"Victory Day,\\" refer to a holy war waged under the banner of Creativity. The lyrics to their song \\"The Stranger\\" are taken from a Rudyard Kipling poem of the same name. Prussian Blue also released a cover of a song called \\"Ocean of Warriors\\" in mp3 format, dedicated to white participants in the 2005 Sydney, Australia race rioting. In 2006, a compilation album was released through the far right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) titled For The Fatherland.http://www.20min.ch/news/kreuz_und_quer/story/12368879 From the free daily newspaper 20 Minuten: Nazi-Twins-Album: NPD vertreibt «For the Fatherland» = Nazi-Twins-Album: NPD distributes «For the Fatherland» Media Prussian Blue appeared in two British television documentaries. The first, 2003's Louis and the Nazis by documentary maker Louis Theroux, was an account of white nationalists, including Prussian Blue. The second, Nazi Pop Twins, by James Quinn, was first aired in 2007. This documentary stressed the tension that existed between the twins and their mother, April. In this documentary, Lynx and Lamb disavowed their mother's race-related views and said that they want to perform music that was not focused on race. Lynx told Quinn that they wore the infamous T-shirts bearing a smiley face that resembled Adolf Hitler because she believed they \\"were a joke\\" and said that \\"being proud of being white\\" did not mean she was a racist. Louis Theroux revisited the twins and their mother to collect material for his book Call of the Weird. In early September 2020, the twins were featured in another documentary by Louis Theroux called Louis Theroux Beyond Belief: Life on the Edge which originally aired on BBC2 which explored the twin's journey of leaving what they described as their racist ideology.

This episode is a comedy about a man who finds a genie and struggles to decide what to wish for, pondering the question through a series of hypothetical dream sequences. Plot George P. Hanley, a shy office worker, shops for a birthday gift for the beautiful Miss Ann Lawson, the secretary in the office where he works. The gift store has just received a heavily soiled oil lamp as part of a random assortment from a distributor; believing it to be worthless, the owner smooth-talks George into buying it for $20. He takes it back to work but is beaten to the punch when his brash co- worker Roger gives Ann a skimpy nightgown. Ann thanks Roger with a kiss. Despondent, George takes the gift-boxed lamp and heads home, where he is greeted by his dog Attila. When George rubs the lamp while cleaning it, a genie emerges. The genie is something of a disappointment; not only is he dressed in modern garb - except for his shoes - but also he offers George only one wish, rather than the traditional three. The genie suggests that George consider very carefully what he should wish for. Throughout the evening and the whole next day, as he considers his various choices, he daydreams various wish scenarios. Attila accompanies him through these dream sequences, but with his breed modified to match George's own changed profession. He first thinks about wishing for love, and dreams of being married to Ann, who is a successful movie star who will not be torn away from her career. George discovers she is having an affair with Roger, who is also a movie star. He concludes that in any circumstance, he would ultimately lose a woman like Ann. The next day at work, as Roger is in the boss's office discussing a promotion to head bookkeeper - a position George is supposedly up for as well - George contemplates having money. He is a wealthy tycoon with Roger as his chauffeur and Ann as his financial assistant. He is made to realize that being able to immediately buy anything he wants, without having to wait or struggle for it, and having the capacity to give away vast amounts, is not satisfying. Indeed, it takes the flavor out of life. He awakes from this fantasy to the news that Roger has won the promotion. As George and Attila later take a walk, George settles on power as his third prospective wish. He imagines being President of the United States. Though initially successful, he is paralyzed by indecision when faced with a global UFO crisis. George realizes the problem with all three wishes is that while his circumstances change, he himself remains a loser, and that he can only improve his life by changing himself. This inspires him to finally decide on a wish. In the final scene, a homeless man finds the lamp in a garbage can and polishes it. The genie who emerges is George, still accompanied by Attila. Unlike the genie who served him, George and Attila both wear the stereotypical turbaned genie garb, and grant three wishes to the finder on the condition that the lamp be returned to the alley afterwards for another needy person to find.

Duffy served as chaplain for the 69th Infantry Regiment (known as the \\"Fighting 69th\\"), a unit of the New York Army National Guard largely drawn from the city's Irish-American and immigrant population.For part of World War I (from 1917 forward to 1992), this New York Army National Guard regiment was redesignated as the \\"165th Infantry Regiment.\\" He served in the Spanish–American War (1898), but it is his service on the Western Front in France during World War I (1917–1918) for which he is best known. Duffy, who typically was involved in combat and accompanied litter bearers into the thick of battle to recover wounded soldiers, became the most highly decorated cleric in the history of the United States Army. Duffy Square – the northern half of New York City's Times Square between 45th and 47th Streets – is named in his honour. Biography =Early life and career= Francis Duffy was born May 2, 1871, in Cobourg, Ontario, Canada, the son of Patrick and Mary Ready Duffy, and attended St. Michael's College in Toronto and St. Joseph's Seminary, Troy, New York. He taught for a time at the College of St. Francis Xavier, and was awarded a master's degree. He became a priest of the Archdiocese of New York, being ordained on September 6, 1896.United States Catholic Historical Society: St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie, New York (1896-1921) With An Account of Other Seminaries of New York, With A Foreword by the Most Rev. Patrick J. Hayes, D.D., And A Chapter on the Seminarian's Life At Dunwoodie By the Rev. Francis P. Duffy, D.D. (The United States Catholic Historical Society: New York, 1922). \\"Students of Dunwoodie\\". p 225. He attended The Catholic University of America where he earned a doctorate in 1905. After ordination, Duffy served on the faculty of St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie, Yonkers, which trains priests for the Archdiocese of New York. He was professor of Philosophical Psychology – a course more related to the Philosophy of the Human Person than to Clinical Psychology, in today's terms – and functioned as a mentor to numerous students. He was also editor of the New York Review, at the time the most scholarly and progressive Catholic theological publication in the United States, and contributed the article on \\"Abstraction\\" to the Catholic Encyclopedia.\\"Duffy, Reverend Francis Patrick\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 49 Extremely popular with students, Duffy was part of a group of faculty members who introduced ground-breaking innovations into the seminary curriculum, putting the institution in the forefront of clerical education. When authors in the New York Review fell under suspicion of the heresy of modernism, the archbishop of New York, Michael Augustine Corrigan, broke up the faculty and reassigned them to other work. The New York Review itself never published an article that was suspect, but it did print papers by leading Catholic Biblical experts who were part of the newly emerging schools of Biblical criticism, and several of these authors' other works raised eyebrows in Rome. Duffy himself wrote few signed items in the journal, although he did author parts of it, and he was responsible as editor for the entire publication. Duffy's new assignment was creating the parish of Our Savior Church in the Bronx. There, in 1912, he organized the parish and built a physical structure that combined parish school and church, one of several innovations he introduced. During this period, Duffy was active in both the Catholic Summer School, a sort of adult summer camp and continuing education system that foreshadowed the explosion in Catholic higher education for the laity today, and in the military – he was regimental chaplain to the 69th New York, which was federalized for a time during the Spanish–American War. =Service as an Army chaplain= Colonel Donovan upon their return from France Already well known in theological circles, Duffy gained wider fame for his involvement as a military chaplain during World War I, when the 69th New York (\\"The Fighting 69th\\") was federalized again and redesignated the 165th U.S. Infantry Regiment. When the unit moved up to the front in France, Duffy accompanied the litter bearers in recovering the wounded and was frequently seen in the thick of battle. Recognized by the regimental commander, Lieutenant Colonel William \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan – who would go on to found the OSS in World War II – as a key element in the unit's morale, Duffy's role in the unit went beyond that of a normal cleric: the regiment was composed primarily of first- and second-generation Irish immigrants from New York City, many of whom wrote later about Duffy's leadership. Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur stated later that Duffy was briefly considered for the post of regimental commander. For his actions in the war, Duffy was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal, the Conspicuous Service Cross (New York State), the Légion d'Honneur (France), and the Croix de Guerre. Father Duffy is the most highly decorated cleric in the history of the U.S. Army. Following the war he wrote Father Duffy's Story,George H. Doran Company, New York 1919 which grew out of a manuscript originally started by Joyce Kilmer, the poet and convert to Catholicism who had joined the regiment and had become a close friend to Duffy. When Kilmer was killed in France, he was working on a history of the regiment's involvement in the war, which Duffy intended to continue, but Duffy was prevailed upon to include his own reminiscences. =Holy Cross Church= Holy Cross Church on 42nd Street in Manhattan, New York City Duffy then served as a pastor of Holy Cross Church in Hell's Kitchen, a block from Times Square, until his death. While there, he had one last opportunity to make a contribution to Catholic thought: in 1927, during Al Smith's campaign for president, the Atlantic Monthly published a letter by Charles C. Marshall, a Protestant lawyer, which questioned whether a Catholic could serve as a loyal president who would put the nation and the Constitution before his allegiance to the Pope, a common thread in American anti-Catholicism.\\"An Open Letter to the Honorable Alfred E. Smith\\", The Atlantic, April 1927 Smith was given a chance to reply: his article, which was ghost-written by Duffy, was a classic statement of the intellectual ideas behind American Catholic patriotism.\\"Catholic and Patriot\\", The Atlantic', May 1927 It hinted at notions of religious freedom and freedom of conscience which would not be spelled out by the Church itself until the Second Vatican Council's Declaration on Religious Freedom in the 1960s. =Death= Duffy died on June 27, 1932, in New York City. > Beloved Chaplain of Fighting 69th Dies.

He is further commemorated as the namesake to the Chaplain Duffy Spiritual Fitness Center at Camp Smith, a New York Army National Guard installation in Cortlandt Manor, New York.

Typology in Christian theology and Biblical exegesis is a doctrine or theory concerning the relationship of the Old Testament to the New Testament. Events, persons, or statements in the Old Testament are seen as types pre-figuring or superseded by antitypes, events or aspects of Christ or his revelation described in the New Testament. For example, Jonah may be seen as the type of Christ in that he emerged from the fish's belly and thus appeared to rise from death. In the fullest version of the theory of typology, the whole purpose of the Old Testament is viewed as merely the provision of types for Christ, the antitype or fulfillment. The theory began in the Early Church, was at its most influential in the High Middle Ages, and continued to be popular, especially in Calvinism, after the Protestant Reformation, but in subsequent periods has been given less emphasis.A Study of Biblical Typology (Wayne Jackson, Christian Courier) In 19th century German protestantism, typological interpretation was distinguished from rectilinear interpretation of prophecy. The former was associated with Hegelian theologians and the latter with Kantian analyticity. Several groups favoring typology today include the Christian Brethren beginning in the 19th century, where typology was much favoured and the subject of numerous books and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Notably, in the Eastern Orthodox Church, typology is still a common and frequent exegetical tool, mainly due to that church's great emphasis on continuity in doctrinal presentation through all historical periods. Typology was frequently used in early Christian art, where type and antitype would be depicted in contrasting positions. The usage of the terminology has expanded into the secular sphere; for example, \\"Geoffrey de Montbray (d.1093), Bishop of Coutances, a right-hand man of William the Conqueror, was a type of the great feudal prelate, warrior and administrator\\".Encyclopædia Britannica Etymology The term is derived from the Greek noun τύπος (typos), \\"a blow, hitting, stamp\\", and thus the figure or impression made on a coin by such action; that is, an image, figure, or statue of a man; also an original pattern, model, or mould. To this is prefixed the Greek preposition ἀντί anti, meaning opposite, corresponding.Liddell and Scott's Greek-English Lexicon, Oxford 1871.The Latin figura, meaning form, shape, or figure, may be comparable, but is from the less violent verb fingo, finxi, fictum, to fashion, form, or mould (Cassell's Latin Dictionary) Origin of the theory Christian typology begins in the New Testament itself. For example, Paul in Romans 5.14 calls Adam \\"a type [τύπος] of the one who was to come\\" — i.e., a type of Christ. He contrasts Adam and Christ both in Romans 5 and in 1 Corinthians 15. The author of the First Epistle of Peter uses the term ἀντίτυπον (antitypon) to refer to baptism. There are also typological concepts in pre-Pauline strata of the New Testament.E. Earle Ellis, 1957, Paul’s Use of the Old Testament. Edinburgh; London: Oliver and Boyd. The early Christians, in considering the Old Testament, needed to decide what its role and purpose was for them, given that Christian revelation and the New Covenant might be considered to have superseded it, and many specific Old Testament rules and requirements were no longer being followed from books such as Leviticus dealing with Expounding of the Law.See also Leviticus 18 One purpose of the Old Testament for Christians was to demonstrate that the Ministry of Jesus and Christ's first coming had been prophesied and foreseen, and the Gospels indeed contain many Old Testament prophecies fulfilled by Christ and quotations from the Old Testament which explicitly and implicitly link Jesus to Old Testament prophecies. Typology greatly extended the number of these links by adding others based on the similarity of Old Testament actions or situations to an aspect of Christ. Typology is also a theory of history, seeing the whole story of the Jewish and Christian peoples as shaped by God, with events within the story acting as symbols for later events. In this role, God is often compared to a writer, using actual events instead of fiction to shape his narrative.Typology Washington State University The most famous form of this is the three-fold Hegelian dialectic pattern, although it is also used in other applications besides history. Development of typology The system of Medieval allegory began in the Early Church as a method for synthesizing the seeming discontinuities between the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) and the New Testament. The Church studied both testaments and saw each as equally inspired by God, yet the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians such as the Jewish kosher laws and the requirement for male circumcision. This therefore encouraged seeing at least parts of the Old Testament not as a literal account but as an allegory or foreshadowing of the events of the New Testament, and in particular examining how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life. Most theorists believed in the literal truth of the Old Testament accounts, but regarded the events described as shaped by God to provide types foreshadowing Christ. Others regarded some parts of the Bible as essentially allegorical; however, the typological relationships remained the same whichever view was taken. Paul states the doctrine in Colossians 2:16–17 – \\"Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.\\" The idea also finds expression in the Letter to the Hebrews. The development of this systematic view of the Hebrew Bible was influenced by the thought of the Hellenistic Jewish world centered in Alexandria, where Jewish philosopher Philo (c. 20 BC – c. 50 AD) and others viewed Scripture in philosophical terms (contemporary Greek literary theory highlighted foreshadowing as a literary device) as essentially an allegory, using Hellenistic Platonic concepts. Origen (184/185253/254) Christianised the system, and figures including Hilary of Poitiers (c. 300c. 368) and Ambrose (c. 340397) spread it. Saint Augustine (345–430) recalled often hearing Ambrose say that \\"the letter kills but the spirit gives life\\", and Augustine in turn became a hugely influential proponent of the system, though also insisting on the literal historical truth of the Bible. Isidore of Seville (c. 560–636) and Rabanus Maurus (c. 780–856) became influential as summarizers and compilers of works setting out standardized interpretations of correspondences and their meanings.Emile Male, The Gothic Image, Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century, p 131-9, English translation of 3rd edition, 1913, Collins, London, (and many other editions) Jewish typological thought continued to develop in Rabbinic literature, including the Kabbalah, with concepts such as the Pardes, the four approaches to a Biblical text. Jacob's Ladder from a Speculum Humanae Salvationis c. 1430, pre-figuring the Ascension above Typology frequently emerged in art; many typological pairings appear in sculpture on cathedrals and churches and in other media. Popular illustrated works expounding typological couplings were among the commonest books of the late Middle Ages, as illuminated manuscripts, blockbooks, and incunabula (early printed books). The Speculum Humanae Salvationis and the Biblia pauperum became the two most successful compilations. =Example of Jonah= The story of Jonah and the fish in the Old Testament offers an example of typology. In the Old Testament Book of Jonah, Jonah told his shipmates to throw him overboard, explaining that God's wrath would pass if Jonah were sacrificed, and that the sea would become calm. Jonah then spent three days and three nights in the belly of a great fish before it spat him up onto dry land. Typological interpretation of this story holds that it prefigures Christ's burial and resurrection. The stomach of the fish represented Christ's tomb; as Jonah exited from the fish after three days and three nights, so did Christ rise from His tomb on the third day. In the New Testament, Jesus invokes Jonah in the manner of a type: \\"As the crowds increased, Jesus said, 'This is a wicked generation. It asks for a miraculous sign, but none will be given it except the sign of Jonah.'\\" (see also , ). In , Jonah called the belly of the fish \\"She'ol\\", the land of the dead (translated as \\"the grave\\" in the NIV Bible). Thus, when one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or in Medieval literature, it usually represents an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ. Other common typological allegories entail the four major Old Testament prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel prefiguring the four Evangelists Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, or the twelve tribes of Israel foreshadowing the twelve apostles. Commentators could find countless numbers of analogies between stories of the Old Testament and the New; modern typologists prefer to limit themselves to considering typological relationships that they find sanctioned in the New Testament itself, as in the example of Jonah above.Jackson, see above Other Old Testament examples Christians believe that Jesus is the mediator of the New Covenant.for example In the Sermon on the Mount he commented on the Law. Some scholars consider this to be an antitype of the proclamation of the Ten Commandments or Mosaic Covenant by Moses from mount Sinai. =Offering of Isaac= Genesis Chapter 22 brings us the story of the preempted offering of Isaac. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac to Him, cited as foreshadowing the crucifixion of Jesus. Isaac asks his father, “Where is the lamb for the burnt offering”, and Abraham prophesies, \\"God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\\" And indeed, a ram caught by its horns awaits them, which is also seen as a type for Christ, the lamb that God provides for sacrifice, crowned by thorns. =Joseph= Genesis Chapters 37–50 has the story of Joseph in Egypt, and Joseph is commonly cited as a Christ type.Learn the bible site Joseph is a very special son to his father. From his father’s perspective, Joseph dies and then comes back to life as the ruler of Egypt. Joseph’s brothers deceive their father by dipping his coat in the blood of a sacrificed goat (Genesis 37:31). Later, Joseph’s father finds that Joseph is alive and is the ruler of Egypt who saves the world from a great famine. Other parallels between Joseph and Jesus include: * both are rejected by their own people * both became servants * both are betrayed for silver * both are falsely accused and face false witnesses * both attain stations at the \\"right hand\\" of the respective thrones (Joseph at Pharaoh's throne and Christ at the throne of God) *Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh, and Jesus was about the same age according to the bible when he began his ministry *Money and goods were not able to save the people in time of famine, they had to sell themselves, the same notions are discussed throughout the New Testament. * both provided for the salvation of gentiles, (Joseph provided a physical salvation in preparing for the famine, while Christ provided the deeper spiritual salvation) * Joseph married an Egyptian wife, bringing her into the Abrahamic lineage; Christ's relationship with the church is also described in marriage terms in the New Testament *A direct parallel with Joseph ruling over all of Egypt, and that only Pharaoh would be greater in the throne (Genesis 41:40) is repeated in 1 Corinthians 15:27 with regards to Jesus *Both suffered greatly, and through patience and humbleness were exalted greatly by God, who gave in abundance all things over time. =Moses= Moses, like Joseph and Jonah, undergoes a symbolic death and resurrection. Moses is placed in a basket and floated down the Nile river, and then is drawn out of the Nile to be adopted as a prince (floating the body down the Nile river was also part of an Egyptian funerary ritual for royalty).Burial customs . While in the wilderness, Moses put a brazen serpent on a pole which would heal anyone bitten by a snake, provided that the person looked at it (Numbers 21:8). Jesus proclaimed that the serpent was a type of Himself: \\"as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up\\" (John 3:14). In a battle with the Amalekites, Exodus 17:11 states that \\"as long as Moses held up his hands, the Israelites were winning, but whenever he lowered his hands, the Amalekites were winning.\\" Commentators interpret Moses' raised hands as a type of Jesus' raised hands upon the Cross for, when Jesus' hands were raised as He died, a figurative battle was waged with sin, the end result being victory – that \\"all will be made alive\\" (1 Cor. 15:22). =Inanimate types= Other types were found in aspects of the Old Testament less tied to specific events. The Jewish holidays also have typological fulfillment in the life of Christ. The Last Supper was a Passover meal. Furthermore, many people see the Spring Feasts as types of what Christ accomplished in his first advent and the Fall Feasts as types of what Christ will accomplish in his second advent. The Jewish Tabernacle is commonly seen as a series of complex types of Jesus Christ. For example, Jesus describes himself as \\"the door\\"John 10:9 and the only \\"way\\" to God,John14:6 represented in the single, wide gate to the tabernacle court; the various layers of coverings over the tabernacle represent Christ's godliness (in the intricately woven inner covering) and his humanity (in the dull colouring of the outside covering).CH Raven, God's Sanctuary, John Ritchie Ltd., 1991, The Showbread prepared in the Temple of Jerusalem is also seen as a type for Christ. Post-biblical usage As Erich Auerbach points out in his essay \\"Figura\\", typological (figural) interpretation co-existed alongside allegorical and symbolic-mythical forms of interpretation.Auerbach, Erich. \\"Figura\\". pp.54–57. But it was typology that was most influential as Christianity spread in late Mediterranean cultures, as well as in the North and Western European cultures.Auerbach p.58 Auerbach notes that it was the predominant method of understanding the Hebrew scriptures until after the Reformation—that is, that the Hebrew texts were not understood as Jewish history and law but were instead interpreted \\"as figura rerum or phenomenal prophecy, as a prefiguration of Christ\\".Auerbach p.53 Typological interpretation was a key element of Medieval realism, but remained important in Europe \\"up to the eighteenth century\\".Auerbach p.61 Further, typology was extended beyond interpretations of the Hebrew scriptures and applied to post- Biblical events, seeing them as \\"not the ultimate fulfillment, but [...] a promise of the end of time and the true kingdom of God.\\"Auerbach p.58. Thus, the Puritans interpreted their own history typologically:See for instance, Sacvan Bercovitch, Typology and Early American Literature, U Mass Press, 1972. In this way, the Puritans applied typology both to themselves as a group and to the progress of the individual souls: Typology also became important as a literary device, in which both historical and literary characters become prefigurations of later historical or literary characters.Auerbach's essay treats of figuration in Dante. For a collection of essays on this topic, see Earl Miner, Literary Uses of Typology from the Late Middle Ages to the Present, Princeton U Press, 1977. Of especial interest in this volume are Robert Hollander's essay \\"Typology and Secular Literature: Some Medieval Problems and Examples\\" (pp.3–19) and Barbara Kiefer Lewalski's \\"Typological Symbolism and the 'Progress of the Soul' in Seventeenth-Century Literature\\" (pp.79–114). Intrinsic vs. extrinsic typology Exegetical professor Georg StöckhardtStöckhardt in the Christian Cyclopedia separated Biblical typology into two categories. Extrinsic or external typology was separate from the meaning of the text and its original meaning. Rather, it is applied to the topic by the reader. Intrinsic or internal typology referred to typology embedded within the meaning of the text itself. Although he rejected the possibility of the latter because it would violate the doctrine of the clarity of scripture, most typologists either do not make this distinction or do not reject typology internal to the text. Stöckhardt's position against intrinsic typology is related to the position that all Messianic prophecies are rectilinear as opposed to typological.For more on rectilinear as opposed to typological prophecy, see Typology and narrative criticism Typology is also used by narrative critics to describe the type of time in which an event or happening takes place. Mark Allan Powell separates chronological time from typological time.Mark Allan Powell, What is Narrative Criticism? (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 1990), 72-4. Whereas chronological time refers to the time of action, typological time refers to the “kind of time” of an action. Typological settings may be symbolic. For example, when Judas leaves the Last Supper to hand Jesus over to the authorities, “it was night” (John 13:30).

Probably built in the third or fourth centuries AD, it formed part of the coastal defences of the eastern shore of Britain, and overlooked the mouth of the River Deben. The walls and foundations subsided in cliff erosion during the 18th century, but large portions of the walls still lie under the sea. There is evidence of a Roman port around Walton castle and 'The Dip', as well as a Roman villa and precinct.http://suffolkinstitute.pdfsrv.co.uk/customers/Suffolk%20Institute/2014/01/10/Volume%20XLII%20Part%203%20%282011%29_Felixstowe%20Roman%20fort%20J%20Fairclough_253%20to%20276.pdf The name Walton denotes a settlement and farmstead of Wealas, (\\"strangers\\") the Anglo-Saxon term for native Britons, or Celts who, over time, adopted the language and culture of the newcomers. During the early seventh century, when the Anglo-Saxon royal cemetery at Sutton Hoo was in use, Walton Castle was an important part of the royal environs which, by c. 660, had become settled at Rendlesham, on the north side of the River Deben. With Dunwich, Walton Castle is one of the two principal sites claimed in the Middle Ages for the location of Dommoc, the original bishop's seat of St Felix (Felix of Burgundy), first bishop of the East Angles, who arrived c. 630 AD in the reign of King Sigeberht of East Anglia. The see of Dommoc survived until the late ninth century. At the time of the Norman Conquest, the manor of Walton was linked with that of Falkenham, a village overlooking the River Deben a little further inland. The fort area was then known as Burch, a form of Burgh. In about 1170–80 Roger Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk, invited the monks of Rochester to found Walton Priory,http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/suff/vol2/pp80-81 dedicated to St Felix, in the precinct of the Roman fort. During the twelfth century, the powerful Bigod family established an important manorial hall at Walton, which was successively rebuilt and enlarged over the next two centuries using material from the old castle and Caen stone from Normandy for ornamental windows and doors. Hugh Bigod also held a castle at Walton, but was obliged to surrender it to King Henry II in 1157. Henry then stationed a royal garrison there until 1173, when the rebel Earl of Leicester landed there to join the Bigods. The Bigod castle, according to the chronicler Diceto, had a high tower set up with very strong walls. Henry ordered its demolition in 1178. King John was staying at Walton Hall in 1200 when he ratified the original Town Charter of Ipswich. Large ruins of the old hall remained in the eighteenth century, and the last major portion of wall fell during a high storm in the 1880s. It stood near the Felixstowe cricket ground on Dellwood Avenue. During the thirteenth century, the place name Felixstowe first appears, which replaced that of Burch and became the name of the large settlement which has now largely engulfed the older Walton. In around 1317, probably because the Roman precinct was threatened by sea erosion, it became necessary to relocate Walton Priory to Abbey Meadow, behind the Walton parish church of St Mary. The parish church was then used as the conventual or priory church. The ruins of the second priory were still standing in the late 18th century, and the site was excavated by Dr Stanley West in around 1970. The parish church was largely rebuilt in the 19th century on the medieval ground- plan, including the tower unusually sited at the south-west end of the south aisle. It is a grade II* listed building. The various Roman and medieval ruins of Walton were variously sketched and painted during the 18th century by Francis Grose, Isaac Johnson and others. The reference to a cross at Walton carved with the date 631, observed in the 18th century, is to the old wooden market cross of Walton, a covered structure which was inscribed with the date 1631. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales said of Walton: \\"WALTON, a parish, with a village, in Woodbridge district, Suffolk; 3½ miles NW of Harwich r. station. It has a post-office‡. under Ipswich, and a ferry across the Orwell to Harwich. Acres, 1,988. Real property, £5,663. Pop., 988. Houses, 225. The manor belongs to the Duke of Hamilton.

The products of the classification, i.e. the classes, are also called types. Most archaeological typologies organize portable artifacts into types, but typologies of larger structures, including buildings, field monuments, fortifications or roads, are equally possible. A typology helps to manage a large mass of archaeological data. According to Doran and Hodson, \\"this superficially straightforward task has proved one of the most time consuming and contentious aspects of archaeological research\\". Philosophical background Typology is based on a view of the world familiar from Plato's metaphysics called essentialism. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable \\"kinds\\". This idea is the basis for most typological constructions particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as \\"mental templates\\" or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen as a consequence of the imperfect realization of the template and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences. History Although the principles were not clearly articulated, the application of basic typological techniques can occasionally be found in the work of early modern antiquaries. As early as the 1530s, John Leland successfully identified Roman bricks (under the misleading designation \\"Briton brykes\\") at several different sites, distinguishing them from more modern bricks by size and shape. Antiquaries began to recognise in the late 16th century that medieval monumental effigies represented with their legs crossed were likely to be older than those with straight legs. In the late 17th century, John Aubrey worked out crude evolutionary sequences based on typological distinctions for medieval architecture, handwriting, shield-shapes and costume, describing his technique as \\"comparative antiquitie\\". The outline of the development of medieval Gothic architecture was further refined in the 18th century, notably by James Bentham in his 1771 History and Antiquities of Ely Cathedral, and culminated in the clear sequence of styles published by Thomas Rickman in 1817. Richard Gough, in his Sepulchral Monuments in Great Britain (1786–99), used comparative and typological methodology to analyse the development of English church monuments. In the 19th and early 20th centuries archaeological typologies continued to be constructed using a combination of empirical observation and intuition. According to Eggers, most archaeologists give Oscar Montelius the credit for the first serious application of the typological method, but in Eggers' view, his contemporary colleague from Stockholm, Hans Hildebrand made important contributions to the development of the methodology as well. Hildebrand published a fundamental paper on the development of fibulae in the 1870s using the typological method, whereas Montelius at the same time went to international congresses and published smaller papers on this method. Another early example is the typology published in 1899 by Flinders Petrie for the objects (mainly pottery) found in 900 prehistoric Egyptian graves. This typology formed the basis for his manual seriation of the graves. Quantitative methodologies With the development of statistical techniques and numerical taxonomy in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including cluster analysis, principal components analysis, correspondence analysis and factor analysis) have been used to build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts. During the 1990s archaeologists began to use phylogenetic methods borrowed from cladistics.  Qualitative methodologies  = Morphological/descriptive typology = One class of typology consists of a descriptive or morphological approach.Archaeology Wwordsmith morphological It is based on the physical characteristics and the external features of an artifact. Some examples of morphological and descriptive typologies would be categorizing artifacts distinctively on their weight, height, color, material, or whichever class the individual decides upon.  Projectile point typology  An example of morphological/descriptive typology consists of when an archaeologist excavates a site and finds dozens upon dozens of Native American arrowheads. The archaeologist narrows down their classification by organizing the pieces into morphological/descriptive groups. So, the projectile points could be sorted by weight, height, color, material, or however the archaeologists prefers. One of the first national typology bases available on the web exhibits how the arrowhead artifacts found are classified among the fifty states by region, state, or nationwide.The Projectile Points Typology Database In this particular example, the arrowheads are classified by their shape. The categories consist of: notched, stemmed, lanceolate, and other projectile points. Each category may also be narrowed down into subsequent ones. An example of morphological/descriptive typology. Archaeologist classified these arrowheads based on the projectile point shape. = Chronological typology = This type consists of sequential ordering of archaeological artifacts merely based on form. It involves collecting dates or relative dates that establishes the position in time the artifact lies in to reflect the civilization/events of a current region. A chronological typology is made up of diagnostic artifacts, or relics that suggests a particular event/people occurred during a period of time [https://www.jefpat.org/diagnostic/Post- Colonial%20Ceramics/PaintedWares/index-paintedwares.htm Section underglaze painted earthenwares, for an example of chronological typology. = Functional typology = Artifacts organized into this kind of typology are sorted by the use they serve rather than the looks they have or the chronological sequence they possess. In some cases, the artifacts may not be removed because of the functional purpose they exhibit, and the restoration of the pieces can be more difficult than other types of objects. = Stylistic typology = This type of classification displays information about the artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology is not to be confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. Pottery is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution. Ceramics For cultures that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably spend a great deal of time defining ceramic \\"types.\\" Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on. The names assigned to the ceramic types are arbitrary. In United States, the common practice is a two-part name, the first part being an arbitrary geographic reference and the second part providing a brief description of the pottery's most obvious design attributes. Thus, for example, the type \\"Flagstaff Black-on-white\\" was first defined using a collection from the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, and its primary design attribute is the use of black paint on a white background. Non-archaeologists should be aware of the limitations of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate. Art In the middle of the twentieth century, German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher raised typology to an art form by photographing countless similar architectural features including water towers, workers' houses and industrial landscapes.Bernd and Hilla Becher, Water Towers, The MIT Press, 1988, See also *Taxonomy (general) *Taxonomy (biology) *Seriation (archaeology) *Lithic analysis References  Dating methodologies in archaeology Methods in archaeology Archaeological theory Museology ","title":"Typology (archaeology)"},{"id":"2983699","text":"Edgar Josef André, or Etkar Josef André (17 January 1894 - 4 November 1936) was a politician in the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and an antifascist. Early years Born in Aachen, André was a manual labourer's son. By the time he was five, he had already lost his father, and his mother, who was ill, found it quite hard to look after her three children. Belgian relatives brought them to Liège where for a while, Edgar found himself living at an orphanage. After leaving school, he took up an apprenticeship at a bookshop, where he came into contact with political literature. SPD membership In 1911, he became a member of the Belgian Labour Party, and in only two years' time, he had become the Secretary of the Socialist Worker Youth in Brussels. In 1914, he took part in the Party Congress of the Belgian Labour Party. In the First World War, he volunteered for service in the Rhineland and in late 1918 wound up a prisoner of the French. After coming back to Germany, he went first to Koblenz, where he joined the Socialist Worker Youth and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). In 1922, he moved to Hamburg. There he worked in building and at the harbour, and he became a member of the Building Workers' Alliance, and later also the Transport Workers' Alliance. KPD membership During the post-war early 1920s depression, which struck Germany especially hard owing to the war reparations exacted from it by the Treaty of Versailles, André came into sharp conflict with the SPD's policies, resulting in his resignation from the party, and his joining the KPD on 1 January 1923. He soon belonged to Ernst Thälmann's circle of friends. As a member of the KPD's Wasserkante District Leadership (1926 - 1930), he was one of the best liked labour leaders in Hamburg. As the Hamburg jobless workers' spokesman, he likewise stepped forward as co-founder and leader of the Wasserkante branch of the Rotfrontkämpferbund, the KPD's protection and defence organization (1924 - 1929). After attending the KPD's party school, André was, in 1931-32, active in the International Union of Seamen and Harbour Workers as an instructor and propagandist, spending much of his time in Belgium and France. His knowledge of French was a great advantage to him in this endeavour. Arrest, imprisonment, torture and death After Hitler seized power following the Reichstag fire, Edgar André was arrested on 5 March 1933. He was held in custody for three and a half years, during which time he was tortured. When it was over, he could walk only on crutches, and he had lost his hearing. When his trial began in Hamburg on 4 May 1936, on charges of murder, nine cases of attempted murder and public order offences, the prosecution could only present insufficient evidence of André's guilt. Nevertheless, the prosecutor requested - one assumes on Hitler's personal orders - that the death penalty be imposed. On 10 July 1936, the judge imposed just such a sentence. The authorities ignored the international protest movement over the case, and André was beheaded on 4 November 1936. A few hours later, Fuhlsbüttel Prison's 5,000 inmates went \\"on strike\\" in protest over André's death. In the Spanish Civil War, shortly before his death, the first battalion of the International Brigades was formed under the name \\"Edgar André\\".

It follows a young girl as she attempts to win the national spelling bee, and the repercussions of her success on the other members of her family. Plot summary Eleven-year-old Eliza Naumann is the only \\"ordinary\\" member in a family of gifted people living in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Her father Saul is a cantor at the local synagogue and a keen student of Jewish texts; her mother Miriam is apparently a successful lawyer and her brother Aaron is a gifted student who is able to read and recite in Hebrew and is allowed into his father's study, where he plays the guitar with his father. One day Eliza surprises herself by winning the class spelling bee, then the school bee at McKinley Elementary School. At first Saul is unaware of her success, but then he becomes increasingly involved with her. Eliza is invited into his study to practice, and Aaron for the first time finds the door closed to him. But as Eliza progresses through the district bee and prepares for the national bee, the troubled lives of her family come into sharp focus. Saul, who has tried to reach God, first through drugs and then through study, becomes convinced that Eliza's talent shows a propensity for mysticism greater than his, which has the potential to lead her to shefa, the influx of the Divine. He gradually introduces her to the writings of Abraham Abulafia, a Medieval kabbalist writer, and it becomes clear that his ambitions for her go far beyond the winning of the spelling bee. Aaron, who had a \\"religious experience\\" at the age of eight (it was actually the wing-light of a plane), finds himself disillusioned with Judaism and begins to look elsewhere, first to Christianity and then to Buddhism. Through a chance encounter in a park he discovers the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and becomes a devotee, unknown to his family. Miriam, who has always had an obsessive personality, has kept from her family that she has not worked for years, instead being a kleptomaniac who spends her time stealing small items from department stores, believing that they are small parts of herself from which she has become separated, a concept she formed when Saul told her about Tikkun olam, the \\"fixing of the world\\". With the other members of her family preoccupied, Miriam's obsession takes a new turn when she finds herself entering people's houses and stealing small objects from them. Several times she is almost discovered, but, though she tries to anchor herself to the real world through emotionally detached sex with Saul, she cannot resist the pull of the empty houses. At the National Spelling Bee, Eliza performs well but does not win, so she begins to prepare for the following year, with Saul's enthusiastic help. But the family is about to be torn apart. Miriam is arrested and Saul learns she quit her job years ago. She has been putting her stolen items into a storage space, where she has arranged them all in a beautiful, complex pattern. She pleads not guilty by reason of insanity, and is admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Aaron announces his intention to leave home, and his faith, to join ISKCON. Eliza, who has begun reading Abulafia on her own, without her father's knowledge, has a terrifying experience on the night that she attempts to achieve shefa. The following day, at the class spelling bee, she deliberately misspells a word.

In January 1998, the districts of Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows jointly took custody from the federal government under the auspices of the Pitt Meadows Airport Society. Nine flight training schools are located at the airport. The airport features three asphalt runways, three helipads, IFR approaches, and a separate float plane dock along the Fraser River. The Nav Canada air traffic control tower operates from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. 365 days per year. In 2019, the airport terminal was moved to make room for a new two-level terminal building, construction is expected to start in 2020.

WEBA does this by focusing on mild to severe emotional, mental, and physical distress and regret women face after having undergone an abortion. Women of WEBA claim that their distress is as a result of the procedure and the lack of information presented to them regarding “post abortion syndrome” by abortion clinics and practitioners who perform these abortions. WEBA supports these women by giving them a platform of which to speak their “silenced” truths on and in many cases, helps these women attack abortion clinics and practitioners through litigation. Founder Nancy Jo Mann received an abortion in 1973. In her testimony published in the book Aborted Women, Silent No More in 1987, she tells the story of her decision to have an abortion as one she regrets deeply. In her testimony, Mann goes into detail about the false information that was provided to her by the abortionist and the that the procedure brought to her life. The pain that she experienced before, during and after her abortion inspired her to create an outreach to women that have been in her same position, and are grieving with their decision to have an abortion.

It was first published in 1940.  Plot summary  The story is told in first person by an unnamed narrator who has a friend named Maling. Maling is afflicted with an unusual medical affliction which his doctors label \\"borborygmi\\" and his friends label \\"tummy rumbles\\". Maling's case of this disease is unusual in that his stomach rumblings echo sounds they have recently \\"heard\\". An example is given where Maling's stomach repeats the opening of a Brahms Concerto. The narrator then tells the story of how Maling's unusual stomach condition caused the bankruptcy of the company he worked for. During an important meeting in which Maling's company negotiated a merger, Maling's stomach imitates the air raid siren that was sounded in London during the Blitz. The officers of the company retreat to a bomb shelter because Maling is ashamed to admit that his stomach is responsible. As no all-clear is sounded, the officers remain in the shelter for twelve hours, ruining the attempted merger and leading the company to bankruptcy. Written in the midst of the Blitz, \\"Alas, Poor Maling\\" is intended to raise the morale of a demoralized London. The story also calls into question the practicality of social etiquette, for if Maling had admitted to his stomach condition, the problem could have been avoided.  Television adaptation  \\"Alas, Poor Maling\\" was one of several Greene stories to be adapted for the 1970s British television drama series Shades of Greene, it starred John Bird as Maling.

She is best known for her cozy mystery series surrounding a small-town baker, Hannah Swensen. Five movies for the Hallmark Channel have been created based on her Hannah Swensen series. Fluke is also known for making chocolate chip cookies for her readers. Fluke has written under the pseudonyms John Fischer, R.J. Fischer, Jo Gibson, Chris Hunter, Gina Jackson and Kathryn Kirkwood.  Personal life  Fluke was born to Cliff and Esther Gibson in in Swanville, Minnesota. She graduated from Swanville High School in 1960, attended St. Cloud State University and earned a B.A. in psychology, in 1973, from California State University, San Bernardino. Fluke has been baking since she was a child and comes from a long line of bakers. According to the author's website, \\"While pursuing her writing career, Joanne has worked as a public school teacher, a psychologist, a musician, a private detective’s assistant, a corporate, legal, and pharmaceutical secretary, a short-order cook, a florist’s assistant, a caterer and party planner, a computer consultant on a now-defunct operating system, a production assistant on a TV quiz show, half of a screenwriting team with her husband, and a mother, wife, and homemaker.\\" Fluke is married to television writer Ruel E. Fischmann and lives with her husband, children and stepchildren in Southern California.  Work  In the 1980s, Fluke began writing young adult horror stories under the name Jo Gibson. Fluke began writing her cozy mystery series starring Hannah Swensen, an \\"amateur sleuth and baker\\" in 2000. The idea for the series came out of Fluke's desire to create a cookbook, and her editor's suggestion that she write a cozy mystery series. Fluke combined the two ideas by including recipes in the series. Hannah Swensen lives in a small Minnesota town and Fluke feels that the stories are a welcome escape from reality. Library Journal writes that the depiction of the story in Cinnamon Roll Murder is so natural, it is difficult to remember that the characters are fictional. Booklist praised her plot-twists in Devil's Food Cake Murder. Her book, Wedding Cake Murder, sees Swensen getting married and solving a crime in the same story.

Elving (April 19, 1935 – July 24, 2011) was a publisher, FM-radio enthusiast, DXer, and college professor from Duluth, Minnesota. He held a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota-Duluth, a master's degree from Iowa State University, and a Ph.D. from Syracuse University. His interest in FM radio began while the technology was still in its infancy and AM was more popular. He was the author of the FM Atlas, a directory of FM radio stations and translators throughout the United States, Canada, and Mexico. FM Atlas has been published approximately every 18 months since 1971 and is currently in its 21st edition. Elving also published FMedia, a monthly newsletter updating the FM Atlas, compiled from Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) data, along with information contributed by subscribers. Publication of FMedia began in 1987, continuing until mid-2007, when Elving announced that he was looking for a hobbyist who would take over the newsletter under new ownership. The publication remained out of print for several months, until Elving eventually created a multi-month issue to catch readers up with the changes in station data. Elving's eldest daughter, Kristine Stuart, took over FMedia in January 2008, with Elving taking on a new role of mentor and contributing editor. In March 2010 Kristine published the last issue of the newsletter, when it again went out of print. Elving was twice given the DXer of the Year award by the Association of North American Radio Clubs, first in 1973 and later in 1986.http://pl703.pairlitesite.com/ANARC.html He had a desire to introduce others to the world of FM DXing, and the Worldwide TV-FM DX Association website includes an article by him, explaining the process. A commentary in the DX Listening Digest, June 19, 2005, listed Elving among those who had helped create today's DX hobby. The column referred to FM Atlas as \\"the FM equivalent of the NRC Log\\" and noted that Elving was a columnist for DXing Horizons magazine.http://www.worldofradio.com/dxld5100.txt As an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota-Duluth during the 1950s, Elving helped found the KUMD radio station (now 103.3 FM), which actually started as a pirate station on AM: \\"The FCC sent their 'cease and desist' letter to KUOM *770 AM, because they had not heard of a University of Minnesota campus in Duluth. That was after the disgruntled engineer quit and 'spilled the beans.' I wrote an article about that experience, which was published in 'Radio World' newspaper.\\"http://www.worldofradio.com/dxld6133.txt KUMD celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2007, and a photo of Elving is featured on its website as one of its founders. Elving was also noted for his mail order sales of radios modified to receive subcarrier signals emanating from FM radio stations. These little-known signals, which require special receiving equipment to hear, often consist of background music for retail establishments, newsfeeds, and reading services for the blind. Elving advocated these services as superior to newer technology such as HD Radio. In March 1989, Monitoring Times published an article by Elving entitled \\"SCA: FM Radio's Alter-Ego - The Radio the FCC Doesn't Want You to Own.\\"http://www.textfiles.com/hamradio/sca.txt In 1997, Elving was quoted in an article in The New York Times discussing Radio Data System (RDS) signals, which ride on FM subcarriers and were thought for a time to be the future of radio. Elving advocated expanding the FM broadcast band below its current 88 MHz limit following the transition from analog to digital television, freeing up the frequencies used for television channels 2-6, and even reinstating the original 42-50 MHz FM band for hobbyist and community broadcasting. This band is currently assigned to a seldom-used two-way communications service. The FCC has issued a long-term experimental license to one broadcaster, WA2XMN, 42.8 MHz, to use this band.http://www.wa2xmn.ar88.net/ Elving, 76, suffered a heart attack and died on July 24, 2011, in California. He is survived by his three daughters: Kristine Stuart, Karin Clements, and Kimberly Misson. Bruce's wife of 41 years, Carol, followed in death on August 10, 2015. Online tributes to him in the radio community reflect his impact on the DXing hobby and on the FM industry, describing him as a \\"professor of FM radio\\" and a champion of the underdog.

The coeducational Magyar Cserkészszövetség had 8,145 members in 2011. History The first Scouting activity in Hungary was the raft trip on the river Vág in 1908. In 1909 Hungarian newspapers reported about Scouting in England, and some chapters of Scouting for Boys were published as well. István Kanitz bought Baden-Powell's book Scouting for Boys and started the first unofficial Scout troop with friends. The first official troops were founded in 1910 in schools and Christian youth associations. The first Scout troops in the dual monarchy, the troops at the Piarist High School, Calvinist Youth Club and Regnum Marianum, were founded in Budapest in 1910. In 1912 the Hungarian Scout Association (Magyar Cserkész Örszem Szöveség) was founded. Important Scouting pioneers in Hungary were Sándor Sík, László Králik, Fritz de Molnar and Aladar de Szillassy. Fritz de Molnar brought a copy of Scouting for Boys from Sweden to Hungary and started Scouting in the Piarist College. Fritz de Molnar later became the Hungarian International Commissioner and Deputy Camp Chief. He was the man who won the heart of Count Pál Teleki for Scouting. Aladar de Szillassy, a teacher and member of the YMCA in Budapest, started a translation of Scouting for Boys and with the support of the National Secretary of the Hungarian YMCA, he started Scouting as part of the YMCA in Budapest. The Piarist Priest Sík Sándor finished the translation of Scouting for Boys. Another influence supporting the beginning of Scouting in Hungary was the youth magazine Zaszlónk (\\"Our Flag\\"). Hungarian Scouts worked closely with Austrian Scouts. In 1917 a Scout exhibition in Vienna was organized by the Hungarian and Austrian Scouts. The Hungarian Scout Association was the Scout association for the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania), while the Österreichischer Pfadfinderbund was the association for Cisleithania. =Growth during early 20th century= During World War I Hungarian Scouts cared for the wounded. After World War I Scout groups were founded in many schools and the first student Scouting groups appeared. Troops were also founded in factories. In 1920, the first Hungarian Scouting magazine Cserkész (\\"Hungarian Scout\\") was published. In 1922 Teleki Pál, a prominent man was elected as Chief Scout and later served as Honorary Chief Scout. Air Scouts were introduced in Hungary and a National Scout Brass Band was founded. The first Woodbadge Course in Hungary was held in 1924. In 1926 a Sea Scout Training Center on the Danube and the Hárshegy Scout Training Center for Woodbadge trainings were opened. In 1919 the first Girl Guide troop was founded within Magyar Cserkészszövetség and in 1926 Magyar Cserkészlány Szövetség was founded as a separate organization but there was still good cooperation between Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. Hungarian Scouts continued their involvement internationally. When the World Scout Bureau was formed in 1922, Hungary was among its founders. Hungary not only helped found the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGGS) in 1928, but also served as its original base, in Parád. Hungarian Scouts were active at the 1924 World Scout Jamboree. Hungarian Scouts placed third in the national competition, behind the Scouts of Britain and America.About Hungarian Scouts in Exile kmcssz.org. Retrieved 2008-09-25. =Fourth World Jamboree= Hungary held its first National Jamboree in 1926 in Káposztásmegyer with 10.000 participants. The camp took place from July 9 to 23, 1926, and it was the only one between the two wars. In 1928 Baden-Powell visited Hungary. A few years later, Boy Scouts from all over the world gathered at the Fourth World Jamboree, held at Gödöllő, Hungary from August 2–13, 1933. Forty-six nations and territories were represented by 25,792 Scouts. They encamped around the Royal Palace in the Royal Forest of Gödöllő, about 11 miles from the capital of Budapest. The badge of the 4th World Scout Jamboree depicted the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the national symbol of Hungary and the official badge of the Jamboree. Former Prime Minister Teleki Pál served as camp chief and Vitez Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army, served as the General Camp Manager. The 4th World Jamboree was the first time there was a subcamp for Scouts taking part in aviation. Scouting in Hungary included both a youth movement and an organization for young men 19–21 years old. =World War II= During World War II, Hungarian Scouts carried out many important roles, acting as messengers and other essential duties. Pál Teleki was called on once again to lead the nation as Prime Minister and Chief Scout of Hungary. Betrayed in his efforts to keep Hungary out of World War II, he committed suicide on April 3, 1941. He was succeeded as Chief Scout by General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, Commander of Royal Ludvokia Akademia. General Farkas remained Chief Scout of the Hungarian Scouts in Exile. Under political pressure from the extreme right, the Hungarian Scouting movement became more militaristic and nationalistic between 1941 and 1945. Despite the war, the Hungarian national Scout leadership was able until the end of 1943 to maintain contact with the Boy Scouts International Bureau, the Polish Scout Headquarters in exile, and with Prince Gustav Adolf of Sweden, Chief Scout of Sweden and member of the World Scout Committee. Before the end of World War II, the national Hungarian Scouts were ordered to merge with the extremist right-leaning youth organization Hungarista Örszem, but it was never really executed. =Post World War II= In 1947 the Hungarian Scouts took part in the 6th World Scout Jamboree in France. In 1945, after World War II, the Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség (Hungarian Scout Association in Exteris), was first named the Teleki Pál Scout Association. It was soon renamed as the Hungarian Scout Association, and it became active in the displaced persons camps in Germany and Austria. Béla H. Bánáthy was during World War II the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association. He was instrumental in contacting the World Scouting Movement and organized Scouting in his camp southeast of Innsbruck, Austria, inside the French occupation zone. Zoltai Gogins organized Hungarian Scouting in the Feffernitz displaced persons camps near Graz in the British occupation zone. The Hungarian Scout Association in Exteris soon became active around the world. The Magyar Cserkészszövetség in Exile preserved the traditions of Hungarian Scouting in exile and held contact with other Scout associations. In 1948, Scouting was officially abolished in Hungary by the Communist regime, but it remained nascent underground in a situation similar to that in neighboring Czechoslovakia. Former Scouts worked in secret to keep \\"the spirit of Scouting\\" alive during this time even at risk of imprisonment. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 there was a short time were Hungarian Scouts were active in public again. After the end of the Hungarian Revolution, Scout groups were founded in refugee camps and Austrian cities. In 1957 there were 11 groups with 450 Scouts registered within Pfadfinder Österreichs. Hungarian Scouts took part in the JIM 1957 as members of the Austrian contingent and in the sub camp of the Council of Scout associations in Exile. =Rebirth of Scouting= In 1989, Scouting was again legalized, and during that year Scouting groups appeared as though spontaneously, surprising many by how quickly it returned. In January 1989 Magyar Cserkészszövetség was the first official registered and recognized association under the Law on Associations, which became effective on January 24. Also in January 1989 a second Scout association Magyar Cserkészcsapatok Svövestege (Hungarian Scout Groups Association) was founded. Both formed the Magyar Cserészet Tanácsa (Council of Hungarian Scouting) with 10,300 members in 1990. Because of internal problems the Council of Hungarian Scouting disbanded and Magyar Cserkészszövetség was registered as National Scout Organisation of Hungary in 1992 by the World Scout Bureau. In June 1992 the Hungarian Scout Association had 462 groups with 25.000 members in Hungary. That same year the original seal was restored to the Hungarian Scout Association by the Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség. In 1990, Hungary and Czechoslovakia were the first of the Eastern European nations to return to membership in the World Organization of Scout Movement. In 1992, Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, a long-standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad (Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség), traveled from the Monterey, California in the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom. Bánáthy had attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree held at Gödöllő in 1933. He later became personal friends with General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, Chief Scout of Hungary, and was also Director of Leadership Development at the Royal Ludovika Akademia for the Hungarian Boy Scout Association (Magyar Cserkészszövetség) during World War II. Bánáthy helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association. In 1993 an international Camp at Gödöllő took place commemorating the 4th World Scout Jamboree. There was a sub camp for members of International Fellowship of Former Scouts and Guides. Betty Clay, Baden-Powell's daughter, took part in this international Camp. =Commemorative statue replaced= 1933 World Jamboree In 1994, after democracy and Scouting was reestablished in Hungary, the community around Gödöllő moved to locate and re-erect a statue by Lőrinc Siklódi commemorating the 1933 World Jamboree. In 1943, on the tenth anniversary of the Jamboree, a statue of a Boy Scout was erected across from the Guard Barracks in Royal Forest of Gödöllő, Hungary. When Communist forces liberated the country from Nazi Germany, the original statue by sculptor Lőrinc Siklódi was removed as the government moved to suppress Scouting. After a long search, the original statue could not be found, and a committee was established with the purpose of erecting a new statue. They decided to enlarge Zsigmond Kisfaludi Strobl's statuette entitled The Boy Scout. A student of Kisfaludi Strobl, István Pál, was chosen to complete the work. The new statue of a Boy Scout standing on the original pedestal is unveiled on April 23, 1994, commemorating yet again the 1933 World Jamboree. Modern program In 1991, 20 Scouts of the Magyar Cserkészszövetség participated in the World Jamboree in Korea; and in 1995, 70 Scouts represented Hungarian Scouting in the World Jamboree in the Netherlands. 90 Scouts represented Hungarian Scouting in the 19th World Jamboree and 565 Scouts, including 50 Hungarian Scouts from Transylvania, Slovakia, Ukraine, Serbia, Canada and the United States of America, represented Hungarian Scouting in the 21st World Scout Jamboree in England. At the end of 2004, there were 7,198 registered members in all sections. At the end of 2008, there were 6,758 registered members in all sections. With the growth of Scouting in Hungary, changes to the organization include girl membership, who have their own patrols, and the expansion from towns into villages, allowing otherwise isolated children to participate. Prior to World War II, Magyar Cserkészszövetség groups were primarily hosted by schools, and today are more likely to be connected to a church parish. During the Communist period, Magyar Cserkészszövetség lost considerable property, but today owns two campsites near Budapest. These are the Pál Sztrilich Scout Park and the Csobánka Central European Scout Park(). The program is currently organized into three age groups: *Cub Scouts-ages 6–11 years *Scouts-ages 11–16 years *Rovers-ages 16–21 years The Scout Motto is translating as Be Prepared. The noun for a single Scout in Hungarian is Cserkész. The membership badge of Magyar Cserkészszövetség features the Crown of Saint Stephen. There is also a Sea Scout programme. (Hungarian) The Hungarian Scout Association is among other organizations member of the Ecumenical Council of Churches in Hungary. The Catholic Committee of the Hungarian Scout Association is a full member of the International Catholic Conference of Scouting (ICCS). Hungarian Scouting abroad A number of associations offers Scouting to people of Hungarian descent living outside of Hungary. They form several groups: * For Hungarian Scouts internationally, the Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség, or Hungarian Scout Association in Exteris serves them. * For Hungarian Scouts in neighboring countries, these local associations serve the Hungarian minority Scouts: ** Croatia: Horvátországi Magyarok Zrínyi Miklós Cserkészcsapata (HoMZMCSCS), affiliated with Savez izviđača Hrvatske ** Romania: Romániai Magyar Cserkészszövetség (RMCSSZ) ** Serbia/Vojvodina: Vajdasági Magyar Cserkészszövetség (VMCSSZ) ** Slovakia: Szlovákiai Magyar Cserkészszövetség (SZMCS) ** Ukraine: Kárpátaljai Magyar Cserkészszövetség (KáMCSSZ) The internationally recognised Hungarian associations, the Scouts in Exteris and the minority associations are members of the International Forum of Hungarian Scouting.

The issue came to public attention for its racial implications, and most of the performers who had left eventually returned to Callender. The company stayed at the top of black minstrelsy through the mid-1870s. In 1874 or 1875, Callender organized a second troupe of black minstrels that would tour secondary circuits, such as the Midwest. After a bad year in 1877, he sold his main troupe to J. H. Haverly. He continued to operate his secondary troupe until 1881, when he sold it to Charles and Gustave Frohman. Callender eventually got back into minstrelsy with new black troupes and stakes in others. He funded non-minstrel fare, such as a staging of Uncle Tom's Cabin starring Emma Hyer and Anna Hyer. Minstrelsy remained his main draw, and he owned troupes into the 1890s.

She became well known for her efforts to have black people officially represented on the Board of Control of the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893. She was also a musician, a portraitist and studied foreign languages. Early life Frances (Fannie) Barrier was born on February 12, 1855, the youngest of three children born to Anthony and Harriet Barrier. Her father, born in Pennsylvania, came to Brockport, New York, as a child. He claimed to be partially of French descent. He worked as a barber and later became a coal dealer. Her mother was born in Sherburne, a small community in southeastern Chenango, New York, and was a housewife who dedicated her life to raising her children, and participating in church activities. The couple married in Brockport, where they were one of just a few black families in town. Her family was part of a privileged class since her father had built a solid real estate portfolio, and owned a profitable business. Barrier had intimate contact with the white elite, without suffering any kind of direct discrimination that was prominent elsewhere in the country. The Barrier family attended the First Baptist Church in Brockport, where Barrier's father was a well-respected lay leader, her mother taught the Bible, and she played piano. They were the only black family in the congregation. In a 1904 autobiographical article in the Independent, Barrier recalled of her Brockport youth that \\"...there could not have been a relationship more cordial, respectful and intimate than that of our family and the white people of this community.\\" Barrier and her siblings, Ella and George, attended the \\"primary department\\" or campus school of the old Brockport Collegiate Institute. After that, Fannie Barrier continued on in the school's new incarnation as the Brockport State Normal School (now SUNY- College at Brockport), and was the first African American to graduate in 1870.  Education and early career  After graduation, Barrier went south to teach at a school for blacks in Hannibal, Missouri, where she encountered a level of racism she never experienced in Brockport. For the first time, she witnessed segregation, intimidation, physical assault, and other degradations suffered by many blacks. She reported that she was \\"shattered\\" by the discrimination she encountered and this new awareness of racism targeted toward women of color ultimately led her to pursue a lifetime of activism. Disheartened by the racism she was experiencing, Barrier left the south to study piano at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. However, the conservatory had a widespread reach and influence, drawing students from both the North and the South. Southern white students objected to Barrier's presence, and she was pressured to leave. After leaving the conservatory in Boston, Barrier went to the Washington, D.C., area to teach, joining the emerging education movement, which focused on freedmen and freedwomen. The education movement and community allowed her to socialize and make connections with other educated blacks. However, she also experienced significant difficulties due to her race when she enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Washington to study portrait painting. While teaching in Washington, D.C., she met her future husband Samuel Laing Williams of Georgia and Chicago. He worked in the United States Pension Office while studying law at Columbian University (later George Washington University Law School). They were married in Brockport in August 1887, returned to Washington, and eventually settled in Chicago, Illinois, where Williams was admitted to the Illinois Bar, and began a successful law practice. The couple joined All Souls (Unitarian) Church in Chicago.  Social activism and charity work  Barrier Williams and her husband Samuel Laing Williams were part of the Black midwestern aristocracy, and became active among local community activists and reformers. Chicago's black elite included two distinct groups, the old guard, many of whom migrated to Chicago to escape the oppressive climate of the South, and the new generation. Combined, they were known as the “Black 400.” The new generation were usually born free and educated, and the women were more visible in the public sphere than ever before. Interracial cooperation was also crucial to building networks and gaining influence. Barrier Williams distinguished herself as an artist and a scholar. She was a well-known portraitist and studied German. Barrier Williams and her husband were among the founding members of the Prudence Crandall Study Club, an organization formed by Chicago's elite black American community. Barrier Williams was director of the art and music department, and she led the women's group alongside Mary Jones. They were known as the “Cultured Negro Ladies.” Although many white women's organizations did not embrace their black counterparts as equals, Barrier Williams made a place for herself in the Illinois Woman's Alliance (IWA), which provided a bridge between the women of the Prudence Crandall Study Club and the greater world of public activism, particularly within the labor movement. The IWA made women's issues public concerns, particularly regarding health and hygiene. Barrier Williams became Vice President of the IWA in 1889, and served on the committee focusing on the health and hygiene of the poor. Associating with both Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, she represented the viewpoint of black Americans in the Illinois Women's Alliance and lectured frequently on the need for all women, but especially black women, to have the vote. Her women's rights was recognized when she was the only black American selected to eulogize Susan B. Anthony at the 1907 National American Woman Suffrage Association convention. Barrier Williams helped found the National League of Colored Women in 1893 and its successor, the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) in 1896. She was also among the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and worked with Mary Church Terrell to create the National Federation of Afro- American Women in 1895. Barrier Williams played a crucial role in advocating for the development of Provident Hospital, which opened in 1891. She adamantly lobbied for a hospital for blacks and run by blacks, particularly staffed with all-black nurses, which would provided a much-needed employment opportunity for black women. Barrier Williams utilized her alliance with the IWA to facilitate her entry into the white women's club movement. Barrier Williams was nominated as the first black woman to the prestigious Chicago Woman's Club in 1894 and when she was nominated, she and her supporters received threats, both public and private. It was a struggle to finalize her nomination, but she was finally inducted as a member in 1896. Barrier Williams and her husband worked for the Hyde Park Colored Voters Republican Club and the Colored Taft League. Williams played a central and continuous role in the development of the Frederick Douglass Center in 1905, a settlement house, which she called \\"the black Hull House.\\" She was also instrumental in the creation of the Phyllis Wheatley Home for Girls. =Columbian Exposition of 1893= Fannie Barrier Williams Barrier Williams achieved broader public recognition due to her efforts to gain representation of blacks at the Chicago Columbian Exposition of 1893. She succeeded in having two staff appointments designated for black-Americans, and ensured that black-American interests were included in the program. She was appointed as Clerk in Charge of Colored Interests in the Department of Publicity and Promotions. Barrier Williams was invited to present two major addresses at the Exposition. In the first, \\"The Intellectual Progress of the Colored Women of the United States Since the Emancipation Proclamation,\\" Barrier Williams addressed the World's Congress of Representative Women, and disputed the notion that slavery had rendered black American women incapable of the same moral and intellectual levels as other women. She called on all women to unite to claim their inalienable rights. Her address was followed by a discussion by Anna Julia Cooper and Fanny Jackson Coppin, as well as words of praise for all three women's speeches from Frederick Douglass. The second speech was presented to the World's Parliament of Religions. The address (entitled \\"What Can Religion Further Do to Advance the Condition of the American Negro?\\") called upon churches, particularly those in the South, to open their doors to all people, regardless of race. Barrier Williams proclaimed a continuing belief in the ability of religion and faith to correct society's problems.  Later life  From 1900 she became an outspoken supporter of Booker T. Washington's program of accommodation and self-improvement. After the death of her husband in 1921, Barrier Williams remained in Chicago until 1926. In 1924, the widowed Williams became the first woman and the first black American to be named to the Chicago Library Board. She returned to Brockport in 1926 to live with her sister Ella D. Barrier, where she enjoyed a much simpler and quiet life. The Brockport Republic wrote in 1932 that she was \\"very ill with the grip.\\" She seemingly recovered but due to her declining health, she wrote her will and last testament five years later. She named people she generally cared for and the organizations where people had embraced her activism as the beneficiaries of her estate and possessions. Death and legacy On March 4, 1944, she died after a long illness. She was buried at the Brockport Cemetery on March 14, 1944, at 2pm. She was survived by her sister, Ella D. Barrier, who died a year later. In 2014, SUNY-College at Brockport named the Fannie Barrier Williams Women of Courage Scholarship after her. It is awarded to students with a 3.0 or higher GPA, and the requirements include an essay of their commitment to social justice. References Further reading * Brittney C.

Designed by Hennessy, Hennessy & Co, initially in an English Baroque style inspired by St Paul's in London, it was intended to have been the largest church building of any Christian denomination in the Southern Hemisphere. James Duhig, the Archbishop of Brisbane, was the chief proponent of the project. First designed in 1925, building began in 1927 and in the 1930s services were held in the crypt chapel on the site, the only part to be built. No further construction took place, and with Duhig's death in 1965 the project lost its impetus, but was not formally abandoned until the 1970s. The archdiocese sold the site to property developers in 1985, the crypt was demolished and an apartment complex was built on the site. Today the perimeter wall along Ann Street and part of Gotha Street are all that remain, and were heritage-listed in 1992. Duhig the Builder In the early years of Duhig's ecclesiastical provinciate, his archdiocese took on an extensive building program, including churches, hospitals and schools, creating his nickname \\"Duhig the Builder\\". Projects included the Convent of the Sacred Heart, St Vincent's Hospital, Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola in Toowong 1920s, and the Corpus Christi Church in Nundah in 1926. Within Brisbane, he commissioned the Villa Maria Convent in Fortitude Valley, built in 1927-28. With plans to build a new, larger Cathedral, he completed the existing 19th century Cathedral of St Stephen, Brisbane, with an apse and sanctuary in a simpler design than originally intended in 1922. Site The site chosen for the cathedral was in part that of the Bishop's residence, located on a rise just outside the central city, at the southwestern end of the inner suburb of Fortitude Valley, bounded by Gotha and Gipps, Ann and Wickham Streets (). A house called \\"Dara\\" had been built on that site in 1850, and in 1859 it became the residence of the first Catholic Bishop of Brisbane, James Quinn (1859–1881). In 1890 the house was replaced by a more substantial dwelling of the same name for the second bishop, Robert Dunne (1830–1917). It was then occupied by his successor Archbishop Duhig from 1917 until he demolished it to make way for his Holy Name Cathedral project. The rear part of the site on Gipps Street, where the crypt of the Cathedral was eventually built, was owned by Simon Kreutzer (1865-1926), who sold it for a nominal rate to the Brisbane Town Council as a possible site for a new town hall.Simon Kreuezer \\"was famous as a blacksmith\\". A photo of Simon outside his shop in about 1906 is available. Simon was of 8 children born to Christian Kreutzer,(1824-1896) a vinedresser, and Marianne (née Moledar)(born 1827) from Kaferthal, Baden, Germany who had sailed in 1852-3 on the 'Johan Cosar' to Sydney and later farmed land on the banks of Kedron Brook and had a house where the 'Toombultown' shopping centre is now . They were literate Roman Catholics and had 30 grandchildren in Australia. Source : \\"They came from Pommern (Prussia)\\", 1982 and First Addendum, 1984. However, Charles Moffatt Jenkinson, the mayor of Brisbane in 1914, decided to construct the Brisbane City Hall at Albert Square (now known as King George Square), and he committed the council to that decision by selling the Fortitude Valley site to the Catholic Archdiocese for the construction of the cathedral. Design Holy Name Cathedral was designed by the Sydney-based firm of architects Hennessy, Hennessy & Co. It was intended to be \\"the largest sacred building in the Commonwealth\\", being long, wide and high. It was to be capable of seating 4,000 people. This would have in fact been slightly smaller than Saint Joseph's Oratory in Montreal, Canada, which is , which had just begun construction in 1924. St Joseph's was a modified version of the original design of 1914, which bears strong similarities with the Holy Name Cathedral. A report, with published plans, in Building magazine of 12 September 1927, shows the perspective sketch at the top of this article, which is stated as the first design from 1925, and was 'somewhat fussier' than the final design shown in the plans of 1927.

It was manufactured by Benedict Stone (Qld) Pty Ltd which was established by Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane James Duhig, to manufacture the stone required for the Holy Name Cathedral, Fortitude Valley. The product was developed at the turn of the twentieth century by American manufacturer, Benedict. Duhig obtained a licence from America and opened the Benedict Stone works at Bowen Hills on 9 August 1929. In February 1930 Colonial Mutual Life (CML) advanced Duhig a mortgage on his properties which included the stone works. A mutually-dependent relationship developed between CML, Duhig and Jack Hennessey, architect. CML used Benedict stone to build a number of their Australian offices, ensuring some of their mortgage was repaid and employed Hennessey and Concrete Constructions (Qld) Ltd, Brisbane (Duhig's architect and contractor for the Holy Name Cathedral).  Construction commences  This retaining wall and balustrade along Ann Street is the only remaining part of the projected cathedral. Concrete foundations for the building were laid in 1927, and the foundation stone was laid on 14 Sept 1928 by the papal legate, Cardinal Cerretti, with a crowd of 35,000 people in attendance. Due to the Great Depression which began in late 1929, fund-raising efforts in the 1930s stalled. Because of lack of funds caused by unwise investment in oil shares of the Roma oil wells the dream did not come to fruition.\\"They came from Pommern (Prussia).\\" 1982 p 176. Nevertheless, Duhig managed to raise enough funds to build a crypt on the site which was completed in 1934. In August 1935, the principal altar in the crypt was consecrated by Duhig. However, fundraising efforts stalled shortly thereafter. Construction ceases The Holy Name Cathedral project was subject to further ongoing setbacks. In 1949 the Holy Name architect Jack Hennessy sued for unpaid fees and in 1950 the court awarded him over . The cathedral was never completed. In 1985 the archdiocese sold the site to property developers and an apartment complex called \\"Cathedral Place\\" was subsequently built. The perimeter walls of the cathedral which were topped by balustrades on the boundaries along Ann Street and part of Gotha Street have been preserved. The surviving remnants of the cathedral were heritage-listed in 1992. St Stephen's Cathedral in the central business district continues to be the seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane.

Furtsch won the gold medal in the 4×100 m relay with teammates Mary Carew, Annette Rogers and Wilhelmina von Bremen at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Biography Furtsch was born in San Diego, California in 1914.Many sources report her date of birth: August 16, 1911, but the Hodak interview reports April 17, 1914, which is right according to the California Birth Index. She and her family moved to Orange County when she was 8 years old. During her Junior year at Tustin High School, a gym teacher noticed that she ran very fast. It was brought to the attention of Tustin High School track coach, Vincent Humeston where she was soon training and running with the boys track team. At the time, only big cities and big city schools had organized women's track & field. Humeston got in touch with the Los Angeles Athletic Club, who were at the time, training girls for the 1932 Olympics. In 1931, Furtsch placed in an AAU championship for the only time, when she finished second in the 100 yards.Olympic Bio of the Day: Evelyn Furtsch. Olympstats.com (April 17, 2014). Retrieved on 2017-07-24. At the 1932 Olympics, the American women's 4×100 m relay team broke both the Olympic and world record. Although they ran it in 46.9 seconds, the Olympics at that time did not count tenths of a second. The Olympic record, therefore, was recorded at 47.0 seconds, while the world record at 46.9 seconds. After the Olympics Furtsch studied for two years at Santa Ana College. There was no track team at the college at the time, so she ended her sports career. She married Joe Ojeda, and together with him ran a real estate brokerage company in Santa Ana, California. Furtsch was the first woman from Orange County to win an Olympic gold medal. She received the Ralph Clark Distinguished Citizen Award in Santa Ana in 1984, and was elected into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. She also received the Ralph Clark Distinguished Citizen Award in Santa Ana. Furtsch was the last surviving member of the 1932 American 4×100 meter relay team.

It was an independently incorporated city from 1895 until 1925, when it was annexed by Tampa. One of two oldest known photos of West Tampa, circa. 1895 West Tampa is located west of the Hillsborough River approximately 1 mile from downtown. As of the 2000 census, the district had a population of 22,008. It has consistently been home to one of the highest concentration of Latinos in the city since its founding in 1892. History =Establishment and early history= West Tampa was founded in 1892 by Scottish immigrant and local attorney Hugh Macfarlane, who bought 200 acres of forested land with the intention of starting a new development by luring some of the cigar factories and cigar workers from Ybor City, a very successful new immigrant community on the northeast side of Tampa. West Tampa's initial growth was stunted by transportation issues. The first cigar factory built in the area was forced to close temporarily because workers refused to ride a ferry across the Hillsborough River to the \\"wilds\\" of West Tampa.http://www.westtampachamber.com/history.html Macfarlane had built a bridge and connected West Tampa to Tampa's extensive streetcar line by 1894, spurring a period of tremendous growth. Many of these new residents had not come over from Ybor City; most were Cuban immigrants who settled in West Tampa soon after arriving in the United States. Accordingly, the community was almost exclusivity Cuban during the first several years of its existence. A gradual influx of Italians and Spaniards, mainly from Ybor City, gradually made the cultural mix of the two communities more similar over time. West Tampa branch of the Centro Español club, now houses the Hillsborough Education Foundation West Tampa was incorporated as a city in 1895 with a population of 2,335, making it the 2nd largest Hispanic community in the state. By 1900, it had more inhabitants than Florida's capital city of Tallahassee and was the second largest city in Hillsborough County, behind only Tampa. The neighboring communities combined to produce more hand-rolled cigars than any other locale in the world during the early 20th century, earning Tampa the nickname \\"Cigar City\\". The first public library in Hillsborough County, the West Tampa Free Public Library, opened on Howard Avenue in 1914. Construction of the Neo- classical revivalist style brick building was funded with a $17,500 grant from Andrew Carnegie. The West Tampa Library was restored and expanded in 2004 and is still in use. =West Tampa Police Department= During its incorporated life, West Tampa operated the West Tampa Police Department. It was absorbed by the Tampa Police Department in 1925.http://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/crime/tampa-police-to-honor- two-fallen-officers/987069 One officer was killed in its short history. On July 18, 1920, Patrolman Juan Nales and another officer were walking a man they arrested to jail when the suspect attacked. The suspect gained control of Nales's gun and fatally shot him. The suspect was captured after fleeing and subsequently convicted of murder.http://www.fop86.com/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID;=109346&page;=Chaplain27s20Corner =Annexation= As the years progressed, the connections between West Tampa and Ybor City grew stronger. Most \\"Latins\\" (as Tampa's mix of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian cultures is locally known) had family and friends in both of the neighboring towns. Many people lived in one community and worked in the other. Ybor City's social clubs regularly held large picnics, baseball games, and other events at West Tampa's spacious MacFarlane Park. Some of the clubs built elaborate branch locations for their West Tampa members, further uniting the two increasingly homogeneous districts. The boundaries between West Tampa and \\"Anglo Tampa\\" also blurred as the larger city grew west and south until its suburbs bumped against the edges of West Tampa. The process concluded in 1925, when West Tampa was formally annexed by the city of Tampa. =Neighborhood= As Ybor City faded and emptied out after World War II, many of its residents moved to West Tampa, making it the largest predominantly Latin neighborhood in town. While the same factors that destroyed Ybor City's cigar industry also affected West Tampa, the latter community had enough economic variety to survive when the cigar factories either became totally mechanized or shut down altogether. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, West Tampa received another large influx of Cuban immigrants as they fled Castro's revolution. With very few jobs remaining in the cigar industry by that era, new arrivals found work in various other sectors. As of 2017, the neighborhood has many Colombian cuisine and small Cuban and Puerto Rican eateries and ethnic markets, mostly along main roads such as Columbus Drive, Armenia Avenue, Howard Avenue, Main Street, and Tampa Bay Boulevard. Most of the large brick cigar factory buildings still stand, but none are still used for their original purpose. Some have been renovated and remodeled for office space and other uses, while others have been vacant for years. A few cigars are still rolled in smaller shops and storefronts. While poverty and urban decay have been problematic issues in West Tampa since the 1970s, the district has garnered renewed interest and appreciation for its history and culture. The area saw increasing levels of investment, restoration, and new construction beginning in the 2000s. Redevelopment stalled during the 2008 recession, but resumed several years later with several projects including new apartments, renovation and overhaul of Julian Lane Waterfront Park, and demolition of several city blocks of older public housing to be replaced with new townhome construction.  Description  The historical boundaries of West Tampa are the Hillsborough River and Rome Avenue to the east, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd (formerly Buffalo Ave.) to the north, Kennedy Blvd. (formerly Grand Central Ave.) to the south, and Dale Mabry Highway to the west. The West Tampa Historic District encompasses much of this area, and Interstate 275, built in the 1960s, runs through the approximate center of the neighborhood. The land area of the district is about 10 square miles (about 26 km2).  Demographics  As of the census of 2000, there were 22,008 people, 9,277 households, and 9,908 housing units residing in West Tampa. The racial makeup of the district was 73.7% White, 11.3% African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.5% Asian and Pacific Islander, 8.4% from other races, and 3.8% from two or more races. 51.6% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. In West Tampa, the population was spread out, with 6% Under 5 Years; 5.5% 5 to 9 Years; 10.8% 10 to 19 Years; 32.0% 20 to 39 Years; 22.7% 40 to 59 Years; 17.2% 60 to 79 Years; 3.3% 80 Years and Over. Out of every 100 females residing in the district, there were 93 males. Areas within West Tampa Distinct areas within the West Tampa district are Bowman Heights, Marina Club, Northeast Macfarlane, and Old West Tampa.

Education Boit graduated from St. Patrick's High School in Iten in 1969, a school well known for having produced such world class distance runners as Matthew Birir, David Rudisha, Wilson Kipketer, Japheth Kimutai and many others. Boit received a Diploma from Kenyatta College (now Kenyatta University) in 1972, a bachelor's degree from Eastern New Mexico University in 1976, two master's degrees from Stanford University in 1977 and 1978, and a Doctoral of Education Degree from the University of Oregon in 1986. In 2014, Boit received an honorary Doctorate of Science (DSc) from the University of Glasgow in recognition of his contributions to the academic research of sports and its development in Kenya.  Teaching and Administration  Boit joined the Kenyatta University as a full-time faculty member in 1987. From 1990 to 1997, Boit took leave of his position at the University to work as the Kenya Commissioner of Sports; Boit returned to Kenyatta University in 1998. During the 1990s, Boit also stayed active in the athletic community as member of the IAAF Athletes Commission from 1989 to 1999 and the Special Olympics from 1992–1995. In 2004, Boit and his friend John Manners, whom he met while in high school when Manners was in the Peace Corps, founded KENSAP, The Kenya Scholar-Athlete Project. The Project helps bright students from under-served regions of Kenya gain admission to elite colleges in the United States. Boit and Manners have currently successfully placed more than 100 students in top American universities, including Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Duke, Wesleyan, Brown, Cornell, Amherst, Yale, Barnard, Carleton, Oberlin, Dartmouth, UPenn, Wellesley, Bates, Colby, Tufts, Middlebury, Brandeis, Williams, and Hamilton.

He was author of the influential book: Autobiography of a Fugitive Negro: his anti-slavery labours in the United States, Canada and England, written after his speeches throughout Britain in 1853. It enabled him to raise funds for the Anti-slavery Society of Canada, where many escaped slaves from the USA were arriving in the 1850s. Early life Samuel Ringgold Ward was born into slavery in 1817 on Maryland's eastern shore but fled as a child with his parents in 1820 to New Jersey and soon relocated to New York in 1826. Once settled, Ward's parents enrolled him in at the African Free School. Pastoral and abolition work His beliefs in the end of slavery and his oratory skills led him to politics where he joined first the Liberty Party in 1840, where he remained until 1848, and later the Free Soil Party in 1848, becoming one of the few from the latter party that was interested in the abolitionist aspect of preventing further inclusion of slave states into the union. Indeed, at the Liberty Party National Convention in June 1848, Samuel R. Ward received 12 of a possible 84 votes to place second in balloting for that party's nomination as their candidate for the Office of U.S. Vice President. Other abolitionists both white and black were well aware of Ward's oratory abilities and commended his brilliant efforts in the abolitionist movement. His activities brought him in close contact with fellow orator and abolitionist Frederick Douglass who said of him, \\"As an orator and thinker [Ward] was vastly superior to any of us\\" and that \\"the splendors of his intellect went directly to the glory of race.\\" Little progress had been made in America whilst he had been away and he was to record that here I saw more of the foolishness, wickedness, and at the same time the invincibility, of American Negro-hate, than I ever saw elsewhere. Whilst there, his youngest son, William Reynolds Ward, died and was buried; and two of his daughters, Emily and Alice, were born. From Cortland the family moved to Syracuse, New York, in 1851. However the stay was brief, on account of Samuel Ward participating in the \\"Jerry Rescue\\" on the first day of October in that year, leading him to emigrate in some haste to Canada, that November. During the last few years of Samuel Ward's residence in the United States he had become editor and part owner of two newspapers; the Farmer and Northern Star, and Boston's Impartial Citizen. He was a firm believer in the need for anti-slavery labors, organizations, agitation, and newspapers and conscious of the need to keep the papers from being censured, or worse as in the death of Elijah P. Lovejoy, he commenced the study of law. The first African-American labor leader Freed blacks during the Antebellum also faced discrimination in employment, as black laborers were not welcome in most unions. In response, Frederick Douglass and Ward helped organize the American League of Colored Laborers, the first black American labor union. https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/american-league-colored- laborers-1850/. Assembled on June 13, 1850 in the lecture room of Zion’s church in New York City, the League appointed Samuel Ringgold Ward as its first president, Frederick Douglass as its vice-president, and Henry Bibb as its secretary. Although short-lived and stymied by the small number of black workers in cities at the time, the union’s goals included the creation of a fund to give loans to black entrepreneurs, the creation of a bank that would provide credit and encourage saving, and an industrial fair.https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/american-league- colored-laborers-1850/ Anti-slavery work in Britain In Canada, he worked with Mary Ann Shadd Cary to found a newspaper, The Provincial Freeman, in 1853. While she was the editor-in-chief, as the first woman publisher in North America, she was afraid of not being taken seriously and originally hid her involvement with the paper by putting Ward's and the Rev. Alexander McArthur's names on the masthead. > \\"Proclaimed editor of this bold venture, Ward only lent his name to the > newspaper to generate interest and subscriptions.\\" He was then offered work by the Anti-slavery Society of Canada, who decided he should visit Britain to further their anti-slavery work. He was given the names of contacts in London who would be keen to accommodate his visit, to strengthen their own long-standing anti-slavery work, and might be willing to help organise fund-raising for anti-slavery work in Canada. Ward's preparation paid off and he was well received in Britain early in 1853; as Samuel Ward records, : At the annual meeting of the Congregational Union, Samuel Ward was formally introduced to the body by the Secretary, Rev. George Smith of Trinity Independent Chapel, in company with Rev. Charles Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe, whom he had not met before. A dinner for the Congregational ministers and delegates was organised at Radley's Hotel, at which Samuel Ward gave his first London anti-slavery speech about the need for financial support in Canada: Samuel Ward's visit to London was, he considered, at a most fortunate time for his fund-raising endeavour, because: \\"of the twofold fact that Uncle Tom's Cabin was in every body's hands and heart, and its gifted authoress was the English people's guest. For anti-slavery purposes, a more favourable time could not have been chosen for visiting England.\\" As he further explained, \\"When Mrs. Stowe arrived in England... the book from the one side of the Atlantic, the address (by James Sherman) from the other side... awakened more attention to the anti-slavery cause in England, in 1853, than had existed since the agitation of the emancipation question in 1832.\\" Ward, having met Mrs. Stowe at the house of Rev. James Sherman, next door to his Surrey Chapel on Blackfriars Road, in May 1853, was invited to stay at the Surrey Chapel Parsonage along with Mrs Stowe's husband, the Rev. Dr. Calvin Stowe, and her brother Rev. Charles Beecher, for three weeks. On 7 June 1853 Samuel Ward was able to deliver his major London anti- slavery speech, and had secured 'Lord' Shaftesbury to take the chair. Ward's address had a successful impact, for almost immediately—21 June—it led to the formation of a London Committee to seek financial support for the Anti-Slavery Society of Canada. The Committee comprised 'Lord' Shaftesbury, Rev. J. Sherman, and S. H. Horman-Fisher, with G. W. Alexander its treasurer. This led to several months of hectic speaking engagements for Samuel Ward. He received invitations to speak at the London Missionary Society, kindred charities, and the pulpits of the most distinguished Dissenting divines in the land. Travelling in these causes took him to almost every county in England, and then on to Scotland. After just ten months, some £1,200 had been donated and it was possible to bring the organising committee to a close. A final, large meeting was held at Crosby Hall on the 20th of March, 1854, chaired by Samuel Gurney, where Samuel Ward was accompanied by many of those who had helped him—Rev. James Sherman, Samuel Horman Horman-Fisher, L. A. Chamerovzow, Esq., Rev. James Hamilton D.D., Rev. John Macfarlane, and Josiah Conder. Samuel Ward's success enabled the Anti-slavery society of Canada to finance its work in support of escaped slaves from the USA, and in the following year, 1855 Ward published his influential book recounting all that he had achieved. The proceeds enabled him to retire to Jamaica. Death and memory Samuel Ringgold Ward died in 1866 after spending his last 11 years of life as a minister and farmer in Jamaica.

Those 170 sections were then sliced in microscopic slivers and mounted onto slides and stained. There were 12 sets of slides created with hundreds of slides in each set. Harvey retained two complete sets for his own research and distributed the rest to handpicked leading pathologists of the time. No permission for the removal and preservation had been given by Einstein or his family, but when the family learned about the study, permission to proceed with the study was granted as long as the results were only published in scientific journals and not sensationalised., Chapter 4, p. 144 Theft of Einstein's brain In August, 1978, New Jersey Monthly reporter Steven Levy published an article, \\"I Found Einstein's Brain\\", based on his interview with Dr. Harvey when Harvey was working in Wichita, Kansas. In 1988, Dr. Harvey retired and moved to Lawrence, Kansas. In 1996, Harvey moved from Weston, Missouri to Titusville in Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey.Staff. \\"Doctor Kept Genius's Brain in a Jar 43 Years\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 17, 2005.

Footage shows Harvey segmenting and handing over to Sugimoto a portion. In 1998, Harvey delivered the remaining uncut portion of Einstein's brain to Dr. Elliot Krauss, a pathologist at University Medical Center at Princeton. As Marian Diamond and associates discovered, certain parts of Einstein's brain were found to have a higher proportion of glial cells than the average male brain.Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jr, Harvey T,\\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\",\\"Experimental Neurology 1985;198-204\\", Retrieved February 18, 2017 In 2005, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Einstein's death, the 92-year-old Harvey gave interviews regarding the history of the brain from his home in New Jersey.The Long, Strange Journey of Einstein's Brain.

The original 1924 span was dismantled in 1975. The second bridge, constructed in 1956 was used for vehicular traffic until 1997, when it was converted to recreational use by non-motorized traffic. It became known as the Friendship Trail Bridge and was demolished in 2016, after closing in 2008 due to hazardous conditions and several failed efforts to preserve the span. The third (1975) and fourth (1997) spans of the Gandy Bridge are currently being used for vehicle traffic. Almost three miles long, the Gandy Bridge is one of three bridges connecting the mainland of Hillsborough County and Pinellas County; the others being the Howard Frankland Bridge and the Courtney Campbell Causeway. Original Gandy Bridge The original span of Gandy Bridge In 1910, H. Walter Fuller was a director of three companies owned by F. A. Davis. George S. Gandy Sr was the president of all three companies. Fuller prepared a map including a proposed bridge that would cross upper Tampa Bay following the route of Ninth Street North in St. Petersburg. Gandy partnered with Fuller, incorporating three companies towards design and construction of the bridge. Survey crews decided to change the route from Ninth Street to Fourth Street. In 1918, World War I required that all projects exceeding $250,000 required a certificate of necessity from the War Industries Board headed by Bernard Baruch. The project was not approved and financing was canceled. Gandy bought out Fuller's interests and continued alone. In 1922, Gandy hired promoter Eugene M. Elliott to attract new investment. Gandy sold enough stock to finance the bridge, which cost $1.932 million.George Gandy Sr. Made $1,932,000 Span Possible St. Petersburg Times, April 18, 1956 Construction began in September 1922 and the bridge was completed for a formal opening on November 20, 1924. The steel and concrete bridge spanned a distance of two and a half miles, making it the longest automobile toll bridge in the world at that time. Its double steel bascule drawbridge had a clearance span of and operated electrically. The original toll to cross the bridge was $.75 for an automobile and driver and $.10 for additional passengers. The bridge stopped collecting tolls on April 27, 1944 after it was seized by the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt. On December 23, 1945, a federal jury awarded The Gandy Company $2,383,642 in compensation for the property, plus $100,000 in interest.Gandy Bridge, Toll Span 20 Years, Freed As \\"War Necessity\\" In 1944 St. Petersburg Times, April 18, 1956 The bridge reduced the distance between Tampa and St. Petersburg from 43 to . Its location enabled travel by auto along the route of the world's first scheduled airline flight, which operated between Tampa and Saint Petersburg for six months in 1914. The Gandy Bridge opened on November 20, 1924Florida Department of Transportation Sixteen visiting state governors and several foreign dignitaries attended the opening ceremony. During George Gandy's speech, he stated; \\"The bridge is built!\\" The bridge was dismantled in 1975 immediately after completion of a third span. Efforts to preserve the bridge for recreational purposes were not supported by the Pinellas County Commission, which felt the idea was too expensive, too dangerous, and unnecessary.Pinellas won't support Gandy 'fishing bridge' St. Petersburg Times, February 1, 1975 Second Gandy Bridge A second span was added in 1956By 1947, state Sen. Raymond Sheldon described the bridge as \\"outmoded, too narrow and a traffic bottleneck.\\"Sheldon to Propose Two Routes for New Bay Bridge St. Petersburg Times, April 9, 1947 In 1956 a second slightly higher, fixed span was added to the Gandy Bridge to serve westbound traffic. The first span would then serve eastbound traffic until 1975. The second bridge remained in use until February 1997. =Friendship Trail Bridge= Years before, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) deemed the bridge structurally deficient to vehicular traffic unless costly repairs were made. FDOT initially planned to demolish the middle section of the bridge (including the hump) and leave the remaining fishing pier segments intact. The demolished segments would have then been used for an artificial reef. When residents and community groups in both Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties lobbied together against FDOT and the governments of the two counties to save the 1956 bridge, FDOT dropped its demolition plan. After two years of hearings and funding issues, the 1956 bridge reopened to pedestrian and bicycle traffic on December 11, 1999 as the Friendship Trail Bridge. The 1956 span was opened to pedestrian and recreational use from 1999 until 2008 On November 6, 2008, the Friendship Trail was shut down \\"indefinitely\\" (though the ends remained open) after a state inspection determined that there were significant structural problems with the bridge's superstructure. The bridge had been decaying for years, eventually forcing the closure of the span to vehicular traffic. However, the inspection yielded that the corrosion of the superstructure had worsened and that the overall condition of the bridge was no longer suitable to keep it open due to safety issues. Only a couple months before, the Sunshine Skyway Bridge's fishing piers were deemed to the same fate (A recent inspection there had forced the closure of the eastern span on both the northern and southern piers). There was also a repair plan in place for the bridge that would have repaired the pylons at a cost of $4.2 million. That project was cancelled due to the new developments.Decay closes treasured Friendship Trail Bridge to cyclists, walkers Tampa Tribune - Retrieved November 7, 2008 December 17 brought further gloom for the trail when preliminary estimates to retrofit the bridge added up to about $30 million. Furthermore, the projected costs would only provide a temporary solution to the structure that would only last about ten years. With the state and the nation in recession, county governments saw no way to meet the staggering costs, leaving the trail likely closed for good.$30-million cost likely dooms saving Friendship Trail Bridge St. Pete Times - Retrieved December 18, 2008 December 20, 2008 a report done by Kisinger Campo & Associates and SDR Engineering Consultants showed that the bridge could potentially collapse due to the amount of decay on the structure.Structural Engineering Report for the Friendship Trail Bridge Immediately after the report was released, Hillsborough and Pinellas County officials decided to close the entire bridge permanently. The report suggested the following: * $4.1 million to retrofit both ends of the bridge only * $13 million to demolish the bridge only * $30 million to retrofit the entire structure * $81.1 million to demolish and rebuild the bridge In May 2009, the initial estimates were revised: * $10 million to retrofit both ends of the bridge only * $13 million to demolish the bridge only * $15 million to retrofit the entire structure * $19 million to demolish and rebuild fishing piers After a series of meetings in May, June, and July 2009, the Friendship Trail bridge oversight committee voted to explore the $15 million option to retrofit the entire bridge, which would add about 10 years to its lifespan, with supporters hoping that it would be funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. A peer review done by E.C. Driver and Associates disagreed on the repair estimate claiming it would take $48 million to repair the bridge. Also in July 2009, the animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) offered to contribute funds to help save the Friendship Trail. However, the group asked for fishing to be banned throughout the entire span. In April 2010, both Hillsborough and Pinellas County Commissions voted to demolish the entire structure. The commissions are still proposing ways to commence demolition and a timetable has not yet been set. In March 2011, citizens came together to save the bridge again, proposing a public/private partnership to fund repairs. In April 2011, Hillsborough County Commission voted to delay the demolition in order to give a group of citizens 30 days to come up with a viable plan to repair and re-open the bridge On June 27, 2012, the Hillsborough County Commission voted to allow the group more time to evaluate their options for the bridge. It would also allow the commission to decide on a plan to possibly present a referendum to voters in November to hike the property tax to fund park improvements. Despite the various community efforts to save the bridge, none were able to fully materialize. As of September 2015, the span was gradually being demolished, with guardrails and lighting being removed. Afterwards, the span cut away in sections and hauled off site for recycling. Demolition work was completed as of July 2016. Third and fourth Gandy Bridges Traveling across the 1975 (eastbound) bridge with the 1997 (westbound) bridge to the left A third span was opened to traffic on October 20, 1975 and was originally without street lighting. This replaced the original span which was immediately dismantled. On December 21, 1996, another parallel span was built in between the two existing spans to replace the aging 1956 bridge. The new bridge was initially opened to eastbound traffic while the 1975 bridge was closed to allow FDOT to install street lighting and conduct other bridge work. Westbound traffic at that time continued to utilize the 1956 bridge. The 1996 bridge was converted to westbound traffic in February 1997. =Differences between the spans= The differences between the three bridges are obvious to observers. The westbound span is nine feet higher than the older eastbound span, and has a more gradual hump than its counterpart. The design and architecture of the westbound bridge is similar to the Clearwater Pass Bridge replacement, which was completed in 1994.

Since posturing is an important indicator of the amount of damage that has occurred to the brain, it is used by medical professionals to measure the severity of a coma with the Glasgow Coma Scale (for adults) and the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (for infants). The presence of abnormal posturing indicates a severe medical emergency requiring immediate medical attention. Decerebrate and decorticate posturing are strongly associated with poor outcome in a variety of conditions. For example, near-drowning victims that display decerebrate or decorticate posturing have worse outcomes than those that do not. Changes in the condition of the patient may cause him or her to alternate between different types of posturing. ADAM. Medical Encyclopedia: Abnormal posturing. Retrieved on September 3, 2007. Causes Posturing can be caused by conditions that lead to large increases in intracranial pressure. Such conditions include traumatic brain injury, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, brain tumors, brain abscesses and encephalopathy.ADAM. 2005. \\"Decorticate Posture\\". Retrieved January 15, 2007. Posturing due to stroke usually only occurs on one side of the body and may also be referred to as spastic hemiplegia. Diseases such as malaria are also known to cause the brain to swell and cause this posturing effect. Decerebrate and decorticate posturing can indicate that brain herniation is occurring or is about to occur. Brain herniation is an extremely dangerous condition in which parts of the brain are pushed past hard structures within the skull. In herniation syndrome, which is indicative of brain herniation, decorticate posturing occurs, and, if the condition is left untreated, develops into decerebrate posturing. Posturing has also been displayed by patients with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, diffuse cerebral hypoxia, and brain abscesses. It has also been observed in cases of judicial hanging, although strapping of the arms and legs may hide the effect. =Children= In children younger than age two, posturing is not a reliable finding because their nervous systems are not yet developed. However, Reye's syndrome and traumatic brain injury can both cause decorticate posturing in children. For reasons that are poorly understood, but which may be related to high intracranial pressure, children with malaria frequently exhibit decorticate, decerebrate, and opisthotonic posturing. Types Three types of abnormal posturing are decorticate posturing, with the arms flexed over the chest; decerebrate posturing, with the arms extended at the sides; and opisthotonus, in which the head and back are arched backward. =Decorticate= Decorticate posturing, with elbows, wrists and fingers flexed, and legs extended and rotated inward Decorticate posturing is also called decorticate response, decorticate rigidity, flexor posturing, or, colloquially, \\"mummy baby\\".google books reference for \\"mummy baby\\" Patients with decorticate posturing present with the arms flexed, or bent inward on the chest, the hands are clenched into fists, and the legs extended and feet turned inward. A person displaying decorticate posturing in response to pain gets a score of three in the motor section of the Glasgow Coma Scale, due to the flexion of muscles due to the neuro-muscular response to the trauma. There are two parts to decorticate posturing. * The first is the disinhibition of the red nucleus with facilitation of the rubrospinal tract. The rubrospinal tract facilitates motor neurons in the cervical spinal cord supplying the flexor muscles of the upper extremities. The rubrospinal tract and medullary reticulospinal tract biased flexion outweighs the medial and lateral vestibulospinal and pontine reticulospinal tract biased extension in the upper extremities. * The second component of decorticate posturing is the disruption of the lateral corticospinal tract which facilitates motor neurons in the lower spinal cord supplying flexor muscles of the lower extremities. Since the corticospinal tract is interrupted, the pontine reticulospinal and the medial and lateral vestibulospinal biased extension tracts greatly overwhelm the medullary reticulospinal biased flexion tract. The effects on these two tracts (corticospinal and rubrospinal) by lesions above the red nucleus is what leads to the characteristic flexion posturing of the upper extremities and extensor posturing of the lower extremities. Decorticate posturing indicates that there may be damage to areas including the cerebral hemispheres, the internal capsule, and the thalamus. It may also indicate damage to the midbrain. While decorticate posturing is still an ominous sign of severe brain damage, decerebrate posturing is usually indicative of more severe damage at the rubrospinal tract, and hence, the red nucleus is also involved, indicating a lesion lower in the brainstem. =Decerebrate= Decerebrate rigidity or abnormal extensor posturing. Decerebrate posturing is also called decerebrate response, decerebrate rigidity, or extensor posturing. It describes the involuntary extension of the upper extremities in response to external stimuli. In decerebrate posturing, the head is arched back, the arms are extended by the sides, and the legs are extended. A hallmark of decerebrate posturing is extended elbows. The arms and legs are extended and rotated internally. The patient is rigid, with the teeth clenched. The signs can be on just one side of the body or on both sides, and it may be just in the arms and may be intermittent. A person displaying decerebrate posturing in response to pain gets a score of two in the motor section of the Glasgow Coma Scale (for adults) and the Pediatric Glasgow Coma Scale (for infants), due to his or her muscles extending because of the neuro-muscular response to the trauma. Decerebrate posturing indicates brain stem damage, specifically damage below the level of the red nucleus (e.g. mid-collicular lesion). It is exhibited by people with lesions or compression in the midbrain and lesions in the cerebellum. Decerebrate posturing is commonly seen in pontine strokes. A patient with decorticate posturing may begin to show decerebrate posturing, or may go from one form of posturing to the other. Progression from decorticate posturing to decerebrate posturing is often indicative of uncal (transtentorial) or tonsilar brain herniation. Activation of gamma motor neurons is thought to be important in decerebrate rigidity due to studies in animals showing that dorsal root transection eliminates decerebrate rigidity symptoms.Berne and Levy principles of physiology/[editors] Matthew N. Levy, Bruce M. Koeppen, Bruce A. Stanton.-4th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Mosby, 2006. Transection releases the centres below the site from higher inhibitory controls. In competitive contact sports, posturing (typically of the forearms) can occur with an impact to the head and is termed the fencing response. In this case, the temporary posturing display indicates transient disruption of brain neurochemicals, which wanes within seconds. Prognosis Normally people displaying decerebrate or decorticate posturing are in a coma and have poor prognoses, with risks for cardiac arrhythmia or arrest and respiratory failure. History Sir Charles Sherrington was first to describe decerebrate posturing after transecting the brain stems of cats and monkeys, causing them to exhibit the posturing.

It won the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category. \\"The film is an artistic point of view of that political issue,\\" Abu-Assad said. \\"The politicians want to see it as black and white, good and evil, and art wants to see it as a human thing\\".Glaister, Dan. \\"It was a joke I was even nominated\\", The Guardian, January 20, 2006. Plot Paradise Now follows Palestinian childhood friends Said and Khaled who live in Nablus and have been recruited for suicide attacks in Tel Aviv. It focuses on what would be their last days together. Their handlers from an unidentified resistance group tell them the attack will take place the next day. The pair record videos glorifying God and their cause, and bid their unknowing families and loved ones goodbye, while trying to behave normally to avoid arousing suspicion. The next day, they shave off their hair and beards and don suits in order to look like Israelis. Their cover story is that they are going to a wedding. An explosive belt is attached to each man; the handlers are the only ones with the keys needed to remove the belts without detonating them. The men are instructed to detonate the bombs at the same place, a military check point in Israel, with a time interval of 15 minutes so that the second bomb will kill police arriving after the first blast. They cross the Israeli border, but have to flee from guards. Khaled returns to their handlers, who have fled by the time Said arrives. The handlers remove Khaled's explosive belt and issue a search for Said. Khaled believes he is the best person to find Said since he knows him well, and he is given until the end of that day to find him. After Said escapes from the guards, he approaches an Israeli settlement. At one point, he considers detonating the bomb on a commercial bus, but he decides not to when he sees a child on board. Eventually, Said reveals his reason for taking part in the suicide bombing. While in a car with Suha, a woman he has fallen in love with, he explains that his father was an ameel (a \\"collaborator\\", or Palestinian working for the Israelis), who was executed for his actions. He blames the Israelis for taking advantage of his father's weakness. Khaled eventually finds Said, who is still wearing the belt and about to detonate it while lying on his father's grave. They return to the handlers, and Said convinces them that the attack need not be canceled, because he is ready for it. They both travel to Tel Aviv. Influenced by Suha, who discovered their plan, Khaled cancels his suicide attack. Khaled tries to convince Said to back off as well. However, Said manages to shake Khaled by pretending to agree. The film ends with a long shot of Said sitting on a bus carrying Israeli soldiers, slowly zooming in on his eyes, and then suddenly cuts to white. Production Hany Abu-Assad and co-writer Bero Beyer started working on the script in 1999, but it took them five years to get the story before cameras. The original script was about one man searching for his friend, who is a suicide bomber, but it evolved into a story of two friends, Said and Khaled. The filmmakers faced great difficulties making the film on location. A land mine exploded 300 meters away from the set. While filming in Nablus, Israeli helicopter gunships launched a missile attack on a car near the film's set one day, prompting six crew members to abandon the production indefinitely. ae.philly.com Paradise Now's location manager was kidnapped by a Palestinian faction during the shoot and was not released until Palestinian President Yasser Arafat's office intervened. In an interview with the Telegraph, Hany Abu-Assad said, \\"If I could go back in time, I wouldn't do it again. It's not worth endangering your life for a movie.\\" The Israel Film Fund is underwriting the film’s distribution in Israel. Statements by the filmmakers In Hany Abu-Assad's Golden Globe acceptance speech he made a plea for a Palestinian state, saying he hoped the Golden Globe was “a recognition that the Palestinians deserve their liberty and equality unconditionally.\\" In an interview with Jewish American Tikkun magazine, Hany Abu-Assad was asked \\"When you look ahead now, what gives you hope?\\", \\"The conscience of the Jewish people\\" he answered. \\"The Jews have been the conscience of humanity, always, wherever they go. Not all Jews, but part of them. Ethics. Morality. They invented it! I think Hitler wanted to kill the conscience of the Jews, the conscience of humanity. But this conscience is still alive...Maybe a bit weak...But still alive. Thank God.\\" He has also stated in an interview to Tel Aviv-based newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that had he been raised in the Palestinian territories instead of in his Arab-Israeli home city of Nazareth, he would have become a suicide bomber himself. Israeli-Jewish producer Amir HarelGutman, Matthew Suicide bomber story contender for foreign Oscar USA Today. 2 March 2006 told reporters that \\"First and foremost the movie is a good work of art\\", adding that \\"If the movie raises awareness or presents a different side of reality, this is an important thing.\\" Controversies =Oscars= Paradise Now was the first Palestinian film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. An earlier Palestinian film, Divine Intervention (2002), had controversially failed to gain admission to the competition, allegedly because films nominated for this award must be put forward by the government of their country, and Palestine's status as a sovereign state is disputed. However, since entities such as Puerto Rico, Hong Kong and Taiwan have been submitting entries for years although they are not sovereign states with full United Nations representation, accusations of a double standard were made. Paradise Now was submitted to the Academy and to the Golden Globes as a film from 'Palestine'. It was referred to as such at the Golden Globes. However, Israeli officials, including Consul General Ehud Danoch and Consul for Media and Public Affairs Gilad Millo, tried to extract a guarantee from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that Paradise Now would not be presented in the ceremony as representing the state of Palestine, despite the fact it was introduced as such in the Academy Awards' official website. The Academy Awards began to refer to the film's country instead as \\"the Palestinian Authority\\". This decision angered director-writer Hany Abu-Assad, who said it represented a slap in the face for the Palestinian people and their national identity. The Academy subsequently referred to it as a submission from the \\"Palestinian Territories\\". In a further complication, Israeli writer Irit Linor points out that \\"according to internationally accepted conventions, the nationality of a film is usually determined by the country that invested in it - and that while the film was categorized by the Academy as representing Palestine, it was produced with European funds, by an Israeli-Arab director.\\" On March 1, 2006, a group representing Israeli victims of suicide bombings asked the Oscar organizers to disqualify the film. These protesters claimed that showing the film was immoral and encouraged killing civilians in terror acts. Reception =Critical response= Paradise Now has an 89% rating on the review compendium website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 100 reviews, The site's consensus: \\"This film delves deeply into the minds on suicide bombers, and the result is unsettling .\\" Stephen Holden, in his October 28, 2005 article in the New York Times, applauded the suspense and plot twists in the movie, and the risks involved in humanizing suicide bombers, saying \\"it is easier to see a suicide bomber as a 21st-century Manchurian Candidate - a soulless, robotic shell of a person programmed to wreak destruction - than it is to picture a flesh-and-blood human being doing the damage.\\" In contrast, in a February 7, 2006 article for Ynetnews entitled \\"Anti-Semitism Now\\", Irit Linor criticized the movie as a \\"quality Nazi film\\".

Originally an arcade game, the game was later released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as Super Earth Defense Force, dropping the two-player cooperative gaming mode while adding graphics and selectable weapons. The SNES version was released in Japan on October 25, 1991, and in North America in January 1992. The SNES version was eventually released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on October 29, 2010, in Japan on January 11, 2011, and in North America on July 14, 2011. It is included in Nintendo Switch SNES Online as of September 5, 2019.  Gameplay  Released as a horizontal shooter game in the US in 1991, the object of Earth Defense Force is based on survival of the game's levels, punctuated by the defeat of bosses at the end of each one. It is a fixed-length game, with a proper ending at the completion of the last level. The player normally begins each level with three \\"shield\\" points, each able to absorb one enemy attack. The shield points are represented in the upper right corner by green squares under the heading \\"Shield\\". Additional shield points can be earned once a predetermined game score is reached. Up to five shield points are represented on screen. However, a player can acquire more than five shield points, but they cannot be seen. This is extremely rare though, due to the difficulty of the game and the score intervals at which additional shield points are acquired. Loss of all shields results in the loss of one of three credits, or continues, and loss of all continues results in the player seeing the game over screen. The game uses a unique leveling system, in which the player gains experience from defeated enemies to gain newer, more powerful versions of the weapons the player has access to.  Plot  The story varies slightly between the two different versions of the game. The arcade version takes place in the equivocate future date of Earth, 20XX. The Earth is unexpectedly attacked by the mysterious Azyma Empire: a space-bound monarchy currently dedicated to eradicating all life on the planet from its flagship the Orbital Satellite Buster. The Earth's only hope lies in the recently developed XA-1 and 2 space fighter ships used by the organization known as E.D.F: Earth Defense Force. In the Super NES version, the Azyma Empire has established headquarters on the dark side of the Moon. After attacking the Earth, it is revealed they have a secret weapon being developed on the Moon, one capable of destroying all life on Earth. The E.D.F. is ordered to send their XA-1 fighters in to drive out the invaders and destroy their ultimate weapon.  Development   Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Earth Defense Force on their April 15, 1991 issue as being the eleventh most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Since its release, Earth Defense Force has met with moderate critical reviews, as evidenced by a three out of five star rating by Allgame. Subsequent to its release an enhanced version was broadcast via the Super Famicom's Satellaview subsystem to Japanese gamers under the title BS Super Earth Defense Force.

On the Wharfedale Line between Ilkley and Leeds/Bradford Forster Square, it is served by Class 333 electric trains run by Northern Trains, who also manage the station. Services During Monday to Saturday daytimes services run to/from Leeds and Bradford twice per hour, and there are four services every hour to Ilkley. During Monday to Saturday evenings and all day on Sundays, services are hourly to/from both Leeds and Bradford Forster Square (service to/from the latter was doubled on Sundays from two-hourly at the December 2017 timetable change), with two departures per hour to Ilkley. The station has a small car park, but no other amenities. History Ben Rhydding station, built as part of the Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway, was opened to passenger traffic on 1 July 1866, eleven months after the opening of the railway. In April 1865 the North Eastern Railway Board had \\"ordered that a small wooden station consisting of booking office, waiting room and retiring room for ladies be provided as a temporary accommodation at Ben Rhydding.\\" Six years later, in May 1871, the Joint Committee reached an agreement with the proprietor of the Ben Rhydding Hydro, that a more permanent station structure should be built at the expense of the Hydro, with a ground rent of a penny per annum, so long as the structures met the approval of the railway engineer, a Mr. Crossley. The Hydro's arrangements with the company lasted until 1885, when the structures - a stone built station house on the south (down) platform and a wooden structure on the north (up) platform - were sold to the railway company for £240. Clients of the hydro were met by the hydro's horse-bus, and later by motor-bus, up until some time after the first world war. The station was opened to goods traffic in 1888, and trailing access sidings were provided on the down side for this purpose. A new signal box was opened in 1901, situated at the Ilkley end of the northern platform. The signal box closed in December 1965. Goods traffic ceased on 5 July 1965, and the sidings later removed. Station staff were withdrawn on 7 October 1968, when 'pay-trains' were introduced.The Railways of Wharfedale, Peter E.

Scott, Elizabeth Wilson, Cicely Tyson, and later on, Linden Chiles. The series aired for one season (1963–64) and was shown Monday nights on CBS. Set in New York City, the show explored issues of urban life, some of them grim. Though it won critical praise, it also generated some controversy. TV Guide ranked it #6 on their 2013 list of 60 shows that were \\"Cancelled Too Soon\\".Roush, Matt (June 3, 2013). \\"Cancelled Too Soon\\". TV Guide. pp. 20 and 21 Synopsis The series centers on Scott in the role of Neil Brock, a New York City social worker who worked for the private agency Community Welfare Service, with his secretary, Jane Foster, played by actress Cicely Tyson (this was the first time an African American starred in a television drama). Episodes of East Side/West Side covered topics relevant to the inner city, with many controversial issues explored. A typical example came in the first two episodes, when Brock investigated a prostitute and her child (\\"The Sinner\\"), followed by a story involving statutory rape (“Age of Consent”). In an effort to open up the number of possible stories, Brock resigned from his job in the latter portion of the 1963–64 season to work for a New York congressman, Charles W. Hanson (Chiles). The characters played by Elizabeth Wilson and Cicely Tyson soon disappeared and Barbara Feldon is introduced as Brock's girlfriend for one episode. Despite the high quality of both the writing and acting, the show's penchant for taking on touchy topics forced many potential advertisers to avoid sponsorship of the show, while a number of local stations across the country also chose not to present the program to their viewers. It is said that CBS programming head James Aubrey clashed with Scott regarding the direction of the show, which also was a factor in the cancellation. The December 23, 1963 episode, \\"Creeps Live Here,\\" was originally scheduled to be broadcast on November 25, but was postponed as CBS wrapped up their four-day coverage of the John F. Kennedy assassination. East Side/West Side ran in the 10 p.m. Monday time slot opposite ABC's medical drama about psychiatry, Breaking Point and NBC's Sing Along with Mitch starring Mitch Miller. The show's executive producer, David Susskind, began a letter-writing campaign to government officials, newspaper editors and other prominent individuals. Susskind's request was an attempt to elicit positive feedback to encourage renewal of the series. However, the effort failed when the show was cancelled on January 28. Cast * George C.

Scott, who had recently came to prominence after acclaimed theatrical performances and a series of important films. On January 3, 1962, CBS and United Artists announced that they were beginning preparations for an hour-long drama starring Scott, to be launched during the 1963-1964 season. Scott did not like the idea of the show being prepared for him, and threatened to abrogate his agreement with CBS. James Aubrey, the president of CBS at that time, introduced Scott to an independent producer David Susskind. Susskind turned to his friend Robert Alan Aurthur, a talented television playwright, who offered an unproduced script of his, My Three Angels, centered around a trio of inner-city social workers. Aurthur rewrote the script to fit Scott and renamed the project East Side/West Side, a reference to the two halves of upper Manhattan as bisected by Central Park. The main protagonist was Neil Brock, played by Scott — a tough, impatient, temperamental case worker. With the approval of Aubrey and his newest television star, David Susskind began production on Aurthur’s pilot script, a story about a teen gang killer and his path through the legal system, now called It’s War, Man. The central location of the series was the Community Welfare Service (CWS), a private agency that served as home base for three social workers dedicated to solving the everyday problems, major and minor, of the denizens of an impoverished Manhattan neighborhood. According to George C. Scott, the setting was chosen deliberately to get his character out of the office and maximize the audience’s exposure to the real streets of New York. In November 1962, Susskind attended the New York City Social Work Recruiting Committee and announced his plans to create a television series built around the social work profession. He and his staff were provided with appropriate literature and were engaged in discussion of story ideas and scripts. In January 1963, Bertram Beck, Associate Executive Director of National Association of Social Workers (NASW), informed chairs of his organization of Susskind's interest in producing a show about social workers and requested that they send story ideas to the producer. Beck carried the responsibility of consultant and technical adviser for the series, he read scripts, made editorial comments and changes, and handled much of the mail from social workers who wrote to NASW about the series. \\"It's War, Man\\" resembled an episode of a courtroom procedural The Defenders and gave little indication of the shocking, socially-conscious show that East Side / West Side would become. Social context During the 1950s, the Eisenhower Administration accepted the doctrine that \\"economic growth would itself, by diffusing prosperity, reduce inequalities and resolve social problems. The progressive tax structure, expanded welfare services, mass public education, and the G.I. Bill all served the twin aims of economic growth and income redistribution\\". However, by the mid-fifties it became clear that economic growth alone \\"was not distributing its benefits as expected\\". In 1962, Michael Harrington, in The Other America, exposed the misery and deprivation of a \\"new\\" poor. This group, left out of the nation's economic growth and represented by the sick, disabled, old, minorities of color, and members of female-headed families, had not benefited from post-World War prosperity. In January 1963, Dwight Macdonald provided an exhaustive summary of previous studies on poverty in an important article titled \\"Our Invisible Poor\\" in The New Yorker magazine. He stated that mass poverty persisted and that it was one of two grave social problems, the other being the relationship of poverty to race. He concluded that the federal government was the only force that could reduce poverty and make the lives of the poor more bearable. Between 1961 and 1964, grants were provided to combat the problems of the \\"new poor\\" through improving educational facilities, youth programs and, in general, improving their physical and social well-being. John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign heightened the public's consciousness of poverty. Once elected, he established the President's Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime which sponsored employment programs, manpower training, remedial education, anti-discrimination activities and neighborhood service centers in several cities. The Area Redevelopment Act, passed in 1961, provided federal dollars to improve public facilities and to provide technical assistance and retraining. In 1962, Congress enacted the Manpower Development and Training Act. The reform efforts of the late 1950s and early 1960s culminated in the War on Poverty, initiated by the Administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. Episodes Awards and nominations In 1964, the series received eight Emmy Award nominations, including one win for Outstanding Directorial Achievement awarded to Tom Gries for the controversial November 4, 1963 episode entitled, \\"Who Do You Kill?\\". The episode, which also garnered a writing nomination, as well as acting nominations for supporting actors James Earl Jones and Diana Sands, explored the aftermath of a child's death from a rat bite in a Harlem slum.

On the Wharfedale Line, it is served by Class 333 electric trains run by Northern Trains, which also manages the station. Services During Monday to Saturday, daytime services run to/from Leeds and Bradford twice per hour. In the evenings and all day on Sundays, services are hourly to/from both Leeds and Bradford Forster Square.GB National Rail Timetable December 2019 Edition, Table 38 Sunday services to Bradford were increased to hourly in December 2017 after new Northern Rail franchise operator Arriva Rail North took over in April 2016; there will also be improvements to weekday evening services and longer trains introduced to help combat overcrowding on the route in the future as part of the new franchise specification.Northern Franchise Improvements - DfT History Ilkley station was opened in August 1865 as the western terminus of the Otley and Ilkley Joint Railway (Midland and North Eastern railways). The station buildings were designed by the Chief Architect to the Midland Railway John Holloway Sanders. This railway offered two alternative routes to - either via and the Leeds Northern/NER line through or via and the former Leeds and Bradford Railway along the Aire Valley. The Midland subsequently built a branch from the latter route to in 1876 to provide a direct line from the town to . A milepost on the former Platform 4 indicated that the station was 211.25 miles from London St. Pancras. A further extension of the line opened in 1888 to Skipton via Addingham, Bolton Abbey and Embsay saw the station assume the status of a junction. Terminating trains only used the bay Platform 1, as the lack of a facing crossover on the approach lines meant that Platform 2 was not available as a terminating road. Platform 2 was only available as a departure road for trains that were first drawn back towards Ben Rhydding, and then shunted back into the bay. A carriage storage siding was originally provided between Platforms 1 and 2, explaining the wide gap between the current lines in this location. The facing crossover was finally installed during the remodelling of the station approaches in 1983, thus allowing terminating trains to directly access Platform 2. The through lines were served by Platforms 3 (in the down direction) and 4 (up). The lines continued through the back wall of the station and immediately crossed over Brook Street by way of a bowstring girder bridge with an span. This extension eventually fell victim to Dr Beeching's Reshaping of Britain's Railways report. It was closed to passengers in March 1965 (at the same time as the route via Otley to Leeds) and to all traffic at the beginning of 1966, reducing Ilkley to a terminus once more. The track alongside both Platforms 3 and 4 remained in place for a time following closure as a through route, with Platform 3 seeing occasional peak-time passenger use, and Platform 4 very occasional engineering use as a stabling siding. The pedestrian subway leading from the main station concourse to Platform 4 and the back entrance of the station on Railway Road was closed in 1983 owing to the deterioration of the glass roof above it. Much of the glass in the main roof at this side of the station was removed at this stage, and Platforms 3 and 4 were permanently closed and the track lifted. Goods traffic was catered for by a yard comprising nine sidings and three through roads situated on the south eastern side of the station, in the area now occupied by Tesco's supermarket and car park. A large stone built shed and attached offices was situated on one of the through lines. A five-ton hand-cranked crane stood to the east of the shed. The yard closed for all freight except coal on 1 February 1965, and to all traffic on 7 August 1967. The last two wagons were removed on 9 August 1967 after which the yard sidings stood derelict until removed in the mid 1970s. The original engine shed, dating from the opening of the line was on the site now occupied by the station car park. In a subsequent development, a two road engine shed and two coaling sidings, together with a 50-foot (15.24 m) turntable were provided on the northern side of the approach lines, and the original facility demolished. The new shed was some distance below the main running lines and two reversals were required to access it. The Ilkley brewery building was also provided with a single siding that also served as the headshunt for access to the engine shed area. The shed itself closed in January 1959 with the introduction of DMU passenger services. In the late 1980s, the roofed area covering the western end of the station platforms was closed in and converted into a small supermarket, the lines being shortened by around 40 metres to make room for this alteration. The main station building was taken out of railway use and turned over to retail in May 1988. The area between former Platforms 3 and 4 (the Skipton through lines) was infilled during electrification work and is now a carpark. The vehicle ramp leading up from Station Road passes through the area once occupied by the coal drops at the eastern end of Platform 4. The line was electrified at 25 kV AC in 1995, and was initially worked by three car Class 308 EMUs. The previous latticework footbridge - constructed by Andrew Handyside and Co. in 1909 - was demolished during electrification works and replaced with the present structure which has solid sides to protect pedestrians from the overhead wires. Ilkley is notable in that it was the last British Rail station to be lit by gas. The gas lights were extinguished for the last time on 8 May 1988. In November 2011, a major refurbishment of the station, which cost £625,000, was completed. This new upgrade included the construction of a brand new station building with a ticket office, a heated waiting room and new shelters, also providing space for passengers to await trains. Also added were new customer information screens, a comprehensive CCTV system and improved PA system, and new gates at the entrance of the station. =Station masters= *James Nicholson 1865 - 1906 *Thomas Wakefield 1906 - 1924 *W.J.

A view of some of the variety of trees that can be found at Bailey Arboretum. Bailey Arboretum is a arboretum located in Lattingtown, New York, a small village on the North Shore of Long Island. It opened to the public on Aug. 5, 1969 after being donated to Nassau County in 1968 by the heirs of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Bailey. Through an agreement with the Village of Lattingtown, admission to the arboretum was limited to 200 people at any one time.  History  The arboretum was created by financier Frank Bailey, who used many rare trees and plantings. He purchased the property between 1911/1912 from Joseph R. Clark, a former president of the Board of Aldermen of Brooklyn. Some of the first staff he hired after the purchase of the property was a gardener and gardening assistants. Bailey selected the trees and shrubs for the property, directed where to plant them, trimmed and pruned the tree and helped with transplanting. During the time period of 1916-1920, Bailey imported trees, shrubs and ornamentals from France. The original farmhouse on his estate was once owned by an uncle of Winston Churchill's mother. This estate had been the summer home of the Baileys and was called \\"Munnyskunk.\\" Besides the farmhouse, other buildings on the property include an educational center, visitors' cottage, workshops, garages and storage sheds. Bailey, nicknamed \\"Mr. Brooklyn\\" because of his large real estate business in Brooklyn, was president of Title Guarantee & Trust Company and treasurer of Union College in Schenectady, NY from 1901-1953. His real estate holdings included areas in Brownsville, Bensonhurst, Borough Park and Long Beach. He successfully led the Brooklyn Botanical Garden through the Great Depression. This put him in contact with the great plant collectors of the world and enabled him to amass this collection. Other gifts followed including a rare dwarf evergreen collection. Frank Bailey died on Aug. 26, 1953 at home. He was 88 years old. His wife, Marie Louise Lambert Bailey died on Feb. 19, 1964, also at home. She was 87 years old. Stewarded by the Friends of Bailey Arboretum, the arboretum of exotic trees covers 98% of the property. The property also includes a carriage barn with meeting rooms, a greenhouse, two man made ponds, of woodland trails, and \\"Munnysunk\\", a 200-year-old manor house used for education, fundraising and rentals. The collection of exotic trees makes Bailey Arboretum unique. Two hundred different species of trees are registered on Arbnet's international database, and another 300 trees are pending identification. Fifteen champion trees remain in the Bailey Collection including the dawn redwood planted by seed from China in 1947. In 2007 the Metasequoia Society found the Bailey tree to have the largest girth of any dawn redwood in the world. are landscaped grounds with a rose, perennial, vegetable and annual gardens. A number of trees were destroyed in March 2018 due to the high winds generated by Winter storms Riley and Quinn. Some of the trees were planted by Frank Bailey including a Linden tree and a Larch. After the property was donated in 1968, the county restored the farmhouse and created a visitors parking lot. In addition, The North Shore Garden Club donated the materials to create a new rose garden in 1969. The Matinecock Garden Club sponsored the Iris and Perennial Garden. In 1973, students from the Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), created an interpretive nature trail as part of their coursework. As well as the trail, students transplanted plants and created bridges and dams. The main building was beginning to fall into disrepair in the early 1990s so in November 1993, 13 decorators from the Locust Valley area donated their time and funds to make the repairs themselves. They refurbished 15 rooms on the first and second floors of the building as well as one of the hallways. Walls were restored, plaster was repaired and a ceiling replaced in one of the bathrooms. Wall-to- wall carpeting for staircases and hallways was donated by the Locust Valley Chamber of Commerce. In 2010, the North Shore Garden Club of Long Island, Inc. restored one of the greenhouses on the property. The greenhouse was dedicated on June 13, 2010 in honor of a former member of the Garden Club, Saidie E. Scudder. Another greenhouse on the property was torn down in 2008 because of its state of disrepair. The restored greenhouse was repaired following its original design including an exact copy of its main door. Other partners for this project included: Nassau County, Harry Whaley & Son, LLC, and Oakwood Construction. There are several specialized areas at the Arboretum. Bailey Arboretum has one of the first sensory gardens on Long Island. It opened on Sept. 11, 1990. Handicap-accessible, it appeals to all senses enabling the sight- and mobility-impaired to enjoy a garden. This garden, called the Secret Walled Garden, is maintained by the Locust Valley Garden Club. The Arboretum's Children's Habitat outdoor classroom is accredited by Nature Explore of the Arborday Foundation. It is the first accredited outdoor classroom located at an arboretum in New York State and has been certified since 2007. The Habitat has a picnic grove with tables, a music/movement area with a stage, a nature art area and a climbing/crawling area. Natural materials used include logs, stumps and wood chips. Recent improvements to the Children's Habitat include: new arts and crafts tables and chairs, outdoor chalkboards, log seating, storage lockers and a two level wooden house with a climbing wall and slide. There is also a Bog Garden for flowers and plants that prefer to grow in moist conditions and another garden with plants to attract butterflies and hummingbirds. Three hiking trails cover a large part of the property. There a trail that circles around the Great Lawn and the Wide Loop and the Evergreen Arbor Trails cover 30 acres.Bailey Arboretum brochure and trail map, June 2018 In October 2014, the arboretum was awarded accreditation as a level II arboretum by the ArbNet Arboretum Accreditation Program. It is the only arboretum in the New York metropolitan area to achieve this accreditation. Over 125 species of trees were listed on the certification application. However, there are still many tree species at the arboretum that have not been identified. A ceremony was held to celebrate this achievement on April 24, 2015 at which time a lace bark pine tree was planted - the first of its kind for the arboretum. Level II accreditation criteria includes: having a minimum of 100 species of trees or woody plants, providing educational and public programming, and having a collections policy detailing the development and management of the plants in the arboretum. Other locations that have received Level II accreditation by ArbNet in the New York metropolitan area include: Brooklyn Botanic Gardens, Green-wood Cemetery and Woodlawn Cemetery. Bailey Arboretum is home to the Volunteers for Wildlife Hospital and Education Center. The wildlife hospital moved from the Caumsett State Park in Lloyd Harbor to the Bailey Arboretum in November 2011. The species at the center are all native to Long Island. The not-for-profit organization was created in 1982 and cares for about 2,000 injured or orphaned wild animals each year. A volunteer group, Friends of Bailey Arboretum, was established in the late 1960s and operates the site for Nassau County. In 2010, it was noted that the group raised approximately $200,000 a year. As part of an Eagle Scout project, renovations were recently made to Turtle Island, a small island off one of the ponds on the property. A birdhouse was installed, tree saplings were removed and signage was added describing the flora and fauna of the area. The Arboretum is open 7 days a week and there is no admission fee or charge for parking. Spring/Summer hours are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Fall/Winter hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.  See also  * List of botanical gardens in the United States  References  * Frank Bailey, Hannah Geffen, It Can't Happen Again, Alfred A.

Talbot; and commissioned on 22 April 1967, Comdr. Edwin E. Woods, Jr., in command. The ship was named for U.S. Navy Captain Silas Talbot.  Operational history  On 8 July, the new guided-missile escort ship departed Hampton Roads, Virginia, for Puerto Rico for shakedown and missile system trials. Talbot next headed north and arrived at her home port, Newport, Rhode Island, on 16 September. The ship conducted special operations off the Virginia Capes from 16 October to 18 November and then spent most of her time until the spring of 1968 undergoing post-shakedown availability. Following firing exercises at the Atlantic Fleet weapons range and antisubmarine operations late in April, the destroyer escort participated in the search for missing nuclear submarine in May. She devoted the rest of the year to operations along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean. = Mediterranean Sea = On 31 January 1969, Talbot departed Newport for the Mediterranean and was deployed with the 6th Fleet until she returned on 11 July. After overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard was completed on 1 April 1970, Talbot conducted local operations before returning to the missile range off Puerto Rico in May for weapons tests, followed by refresher training and four months at Newport. On 28 October 1970, she headed for the Mediterranean and her second tour with the 6th Fleet. The deployment ended at Newport on 2 May 1971, and she devoted the remainder of the year to east coast operations. = South American tour = Talbot spent the first part of 1972 conducting tests of the MK-48 torpedo in the Bahamas and off the New England coast. She stood out of Newport on 21 July and proceeded to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, accompanied by and . There, joined the group on the 26th, and they began combined operations with ships from seven South American navies while circumnavigating South America. Talbot made calls in Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Peru, the Panama Canal Zone, and Colombia before returning to Newport on 3 December 1972. She entered the Boston Naval Shipyard on 15 February 1973 for an overhaul that lasted until 14 December. = Western Atlantic = On 5 January 1974, Talbot departed Newport and proceeded to her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia. From 13 February to 29 April, the ship was deployed on training exercises off Jacksonville, Florida; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Vieques, Puerto Rico. After a cruise to Newport in May, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 17 June for the installation of prototypes of the Oto Melara Mk 75 rapid-fire 76 mm gun mount and the Mk 92 fire-control system, intended for use in the new and classes. She stood out of Hampton Roads on 21 October and, from 12 November through 19 December 1974, tested the new systems at the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Range, Culebra, Puerto Rico. Talbot continued her evaluation work into 1975, alternating three periods of test operations at Culebra with a tender availability alongside at Norfolk, local operations in the Virginia capes area, and fleet tactical exercises in the western Atlantic. Her test mission completed, Talbot returned to Norfolk on 22 June. After local operations and inspections, she entered the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on 15 September for a three-month overhaul in which her experimental fire-control system and 76 mm gun were removed and replaced by her normal 5 inch, 38-caliber gun and fire-control system. = Mediterranean and Persian Gulf = Upon completing overhaul and refresher training in the spring of 1976, Talbot departed Norfolk on 22 June for a Mediterranean deployment. En route to the Azores, the Talbot experienced a ruptured fuel tank while refueling under-way and was forced to repair, in the Azores port, before continuing on to Rota, Spain.The six-month operation included participation in NATO exercises interspersed with port visits and concluded with the ship's return to Norfolk on 10 January 1977. Following post-deployment leave and upkeep, Talbot conducted exercises off the east coast until she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for overhaul on 9 June. Completing overhaul on 7 April 1978, Talbot spent the balance of the year in refresher training and participating in Fleet exercises off the east coast and in the Caribbean. On 6 December, she departed the United States for deployment with the Middle East Force in response to the crisis surrounding the deposition of the Shah of Iran. The close of 1978 found Talbot en route to the Persian Gulf. During the 76 Med cruise Talbot was assigned a LAMPS (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) Helicopter Detachment (Det-6) from US Navy squadron HSL-34 (Helicopter Squadron Light-34), Naval Air Station Norfolk, VA. Det-6 Commanding Officer was LCDR Jon Cook. The helicopter utilized was the KAMAN SH-2F. This was the first LAMPS Det that Talbot had on board. It was also the first time the US Navy assigned a LAMPS DET to an FFG to test operational readiness on a small flight deck. The entire operation was deemed a success, with over sixty day/ night time landings safely accomplished. Later, Talbot was assigned another LAMPS DET from HSL-32.  Fate  Talbot was leased to Pakistan in April 1989 and renamed Hunain (D-164). The ship was returned to the United States at Singapore and stricken 29 November 1993. Talbot was soon sold for scrap on 29 March 1994 to Trusha Investments Ltd. for $601,650.

It has also been used by bodybuilders, athletes, and other men for muscle-building and performance- and physique-enhancing purposes. AG is taken by mouth three or four times per day. Side effects of AG include lethargy, somnolence, dizziness, headache, appetite loss, skin rash, hypertension, liver damage, and adrenal insufficiency, among others. AG is both an anticonvulsant and a steroidogenesis inhibitor. In terms of the latter property, it inhibits enzymes such as cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (CYP11A1, P450scc) and aromatase (CYP19A1), thereby inhibiting the conversion of cholesterol into steroid hormones and blocking the production of androgens, estrogens, and glucocorticoids, among other endogenous steroids. As such, AG is an aromatase inhibitor and adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, including both an androgen synthesis inhibitor and a corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor. AG was introduced for medical use, as an anticonvulsant, in 1960. It was withdrawn in 1966 due to toxicity. Its steroidogenesis-inhibiting properties were discovered serendipitously and it was subsequently repurposed for use in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, breast cancer, and prostate cancer from 1969 and thereafter. However, although used in the past, it has mostly been superseded by newer agents with better efficacy and lower toxicity such as ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and other aromatase inhibitors. It remains marketed only in a few countries.https://www.drugs.com/international/aminoglutethimide.html Medical uses AG is used as an anticonvulsant in the treatment of petit mal epilepsy and as a steroidogenesis inhibitor in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome, postmenopausal breast cancer, and prostate cancer. It is also used to treat secondary hyperaldosteronism, edema, adrenocortical carcinoma, and ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) producing tumors. When used as a steroidogenesis inhibitor to treat breast cancer and prostate cancer, AG is given in combination with hydrocortisone, prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid to prevent adrenal insufficiency. AG is a second- or third-line choice in the treatment of hormone-sensitive metastatic breast cancer. While effective in the treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it is not effective in premenopausal women and is not an effective ovarian steroidogenesis inhibitor, probably because it is not a potent enough aromatase inhibitor. The medication is effective in the treatment of prostate cancer, but its effectiveness is low and inconsistent, likely due to its relatively weak steroidogenesis inhibition and poor pharmacokinetics. Nonetheless, AG was found to be non-significantly different in effectiveness from surgical adrenalectomy in terms of prostate cancer tumor regression. In any case, AG is not recommended as a first-line therapy in prostate cancer, but instead only as a second-line therapy. It has only rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. AG is used for adrenal steroidogenesis inhibition by mouth at a dosage of 250 mg three times per day (750 mg/day total) for the first 3 weeks of therapy and then increased to 250 mg four times per day (1,000 mg/day total) thereafter. It can be used at a dosage of up to 500 mg four times per day (2,000 mg/day). It is used as an aromatase inhibitor to inhibit peripheral estrogen production by mouth at a dosage of 125 mg twice per day (250 mg/day total), without significant suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis at this dosage. Maximal aromatase inhibition is said to occur between dosages of 250 to 500 mg per day. The side effects of AG are less frequent and severe at this dosage. However, they are still less when AG is combined with hydrocortisone, and so AG is generally combined with a corticosteroid even at this lower dosage. AG should only be used under close medical supervision and with laboratory tests including thyroid function, baseline hematological, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin. Ketoconazole can achieve similar decreases in steroid hormone levels as AG but is more effective in promoting tumor regression and is moderately less toxic in comparison. AG can still be a useful alternative in those who have failed or are unable to tolerate ketoconazole and other therapies however. =Available forms= AG is provided most commonly in the form of 250 mg tablets. Non-medical uses AG is used by bodybuilders, athletes, and other men to lower circulating levels of cortisol in the body and thereby prevent muscle loss. Cortisol is catabolic to protein in muscle and effective suppression of cortisol by AG at high doses can prevent muscle loss. It is usually used in combination with an anabolic steroid to avoid androgen deficiency. However, the usefulness of AG for such purposes has been questioned, with few users reportedly having positive comments about it, and the risks of AG are said to be high. In any case, AG is also used by bodybuilders and other men for its actions as an aromatase inhibitor in order to decrease estrogen levels. It is said to be useful for inhibiting the estrogenic side effects of certain anabolic steroids such as gynecomastia, increased water retention, and fat gain. Contraindications AG should not be used in people with known hypersensitivity to AG. It should not be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Other potential contraindications include chicken pox, shingles (herpes zoster), infection, kidney disease, liver disease, and hypothyroidism. Side effects AG has many side effects and is a relatively toxic medication, although its side effects are described as usually relatively mild. The side effects of AG include lethargy, fatigue, weakness, malaise, drowsiness, somnolence, depression, apathy, sleep disturbances, stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting ataxia, joint aches and pains, fever, skin rash, hypotension or hypertension, high cholesterol levels, virilization, hypothyroidism, thyroid abnormalities, elevated liver enzymes, jaundice, hepatotoxicity, weight gain, leg cramps, personality changes, blood dyscrasias, and adrenal insufficiency (e.g., hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, others). Lethargy is the most common side effect and has been found to occur in 31 to 70% of people treated with AG. It is the most common reason for discontinuation of AG. Skin rash and hypotension have both been observed in about 15% of people. At least one side effect will occur in 45 to 85% of people. Severe toxicity is seen in 10% of people, including circulatory collapse thought to be due to adrenal insufficiency. Hematological and bone marrow toxicity, including marked depression of white blood cell count, platelets, or both, occurs rarely, with an incidence of about 0.9%. It is usually seen within the first 7 weeks of treatment and resolves within 3 weeks following discontinuation. AG is discontinued in 5 to 10% of people due to intolerable side effects. The central nervous system side effects of AG are due to its nature as an anticonvulsant and relation to glutethimide. Overdose In the event of overdose of AG, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, and respiratory depression may occur. Medical attention should be sought urgently. Treatment of AG overdose can include gastric lavage to decrease absorption and dialysis to enhance elimination. Interactions AG has an interaction with all corticosteroids. It enhances the metabolism of dexamethasone, so hydrocortisone should be used instead. If the person is taking warfarin, the dosage of warfarin may need to be increased. Alcohol potentiates the central nervous system side effects of AG. Dosages of theophylline, digitoxin, and medroxyprogesterone acetate may need to be increased. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= AG is a potent and non- selective steroidogenesis inhibitor, acting as a reversible and competitive inhibitor of multiple steroidogenic enzymes, including: * Aromatase (CYP19A1) (600 nM). Inhibits the formation of the estrogens estradiol and estrone from testosterone and androstenedione, respectively. * Cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc; CYP11A1) (~20,000 nM). Inhibits the conversion of cholesterol into pregnenolone and consequently decreases the synthesis of all steroid hormones including the progestogens, androgens, estrogens, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids, as well as neurosteroids. * 21-Hydroxylase (CYP21A2). Prevents the conversion of progesterone and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone into 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively. * 11β-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1). Prevents the conversion of 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol into corticosterone and cortisol, respectively. * Aldosterone synthase (18-hydroxylase; CYP11B2). Prevents the conversion of corticosterone into aldosterone. As such, AG is an estrogen synthesis inhibitor and adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, including both an androgen synthesis inhibitor and a corticosteroid synthesis inhibitor. For these reasons, AG has functional antiestrogenic, antiandrogenic, antiglucocorticoid, and antimineralocorticoid actions. In terms of its actions as an adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor, it is described as a form of reversible \\"medical adrenalectomy\\" or \\"chemical adrenalectomy\\". While AG inhibits all of the enzymes listed above, inhibition of P450scc is primarily responsible for its inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis. In terms of adrenal androgens, AG has been shown to significantly suppress dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, and dihydrotestosterone levels in men. Although it is most potent in inhibiting aromatase among the enzymes it targets, AG is described nonetheless as a relatively weak aromatase inhibitor. In addition, it is described as a much more potent aromatase inhibitor than adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitor. AG can inhibit aromatase by 74 to 92% and decrease circulating estradiol levels by 58 to 76% in men and postmenopausal women. AG is not an effective ovarian steroidogenesis inhibitor in premenopausal women. However, interference with ovarian steroidogenesis by AG may in any case result in hyperandrogenism and virilization in premenopausal women. =Pharmacokinetics= With oral administration, the absorption of AG is rapid and complete. It is well-distributed throughout the body. In terms of metabolism, a portion of AG is acetylated in the liver. The biological half- life of AG is 12.5 hours. It is excreted in urine 34 to 54% unchanged. Chemistry AG is a nonsteroidal compound, specifically a glutarimide, and is a derivative of glutethimide. It is also known by its chemical names 2-(4-aminophenyl)-2-ethylglutarimide and 2-(aminophenyl)-3-ethylpiperidine-2,6-dione. Aside from glutethimide, AG is structurally related to rogletimide (pyridoglutethimide) and thalidomide, as well as amphenone B, metyrapone, and mitotane. History AG was introduced for medical use, as an anticonvulsant, in 1960. In 1963, it was reported that AG had induced symptoms of Addison's disease (adrenal insufficiency) in a young girl. Following additional reports, it was determined that AG acts as a steroidogenesis inhibitor. As such, the discovery of AG as a steroidogenesis inhibitor was serendipitous. The medication was withdrawn from the market in 1966 due to its adverse effects. The first report of AG in the treatment of breast cancer was published in 1969, and the first report of AG in the treatment of prostate cancer was published in 1974. The medication was one of the first adrenal steroidogenesis inhibitors as well as the first aromatase inhibitor to be discovered and used clinically, and led to the development of other aromatase inhibitors. Along with testolactone, it is described as a \\"first-generation\\" aromatase inhibitor. AG has largely been superseded by medications with better effectiveness and tolerability and reduced toxicity, such as ketoconazole, abiraterone acetate, and other aromatase inhibitors.

It has since undergone many changes of purpose and management and currently caters primarily for rehabilitation and geriatric medicine. The Brighton Cemetery is also located in Caulfield South, and pre-dates the Caulfield Roads Board - the first official recognition of the suburb of Caulfield. Opened in 1855 it became, together with St Kilda Cemetery, an alternative resting place for those who had lived south of the Yarra River. There are up 70,000 people interred, including famous Australian artists, politicians and military heroes. Caulfield South has many parks and gardens, the most notable of which is Princes Park. The area was a council landfill up until the middle of the twentieth century, when it was transformed into public park lands. It has been improved further and now includes several ovals and playing fields, sports clubs, pavillons, open spaces, children's playgrounds and many paved walking tracks with dog walking welcome. Caulfield South Primary School is located in Bundeera Road. The Rosstown Railway once ran through Caulfield South, and its traversal through several suburban blocks remains public land to this day, an easy identifier of where the track once ran. The architecture of Caulfield South is predominately period-style detached 2 and 3 bedroom family homes with both front and rear gardens. Not all properties have off-street parking and rely on space available on the street. The architectural styles range from the early 1900s and onwards with common styles being Edwardian weather board to Californian Bungalow to Red Brick Clinker pairs which share a common wall. An increasing trend is the demolition of the original house to construct a large, two storey modern house. There are also a growing number of higher density apartments and flats appearing, especially close to the tram lines. Native wildlife that inhabit the suburb include both ring tail and brush tail possums, magpies, crested pigeons, rainbow lorikeets and wattle birds. Based on findings from the 2011 census and their own research, The Australian Centre for Jewish Civilisation at Monash University estimates that the suburb has 5,005 Jewish residents, comprising 44.4% of the suburb's population.The Jewish population of Australia: Key findings from the 2011 census Jewish Care. Retrieved on 14 September 2016 Results from the 2016 census indicated a Jewish population of 4,008, a percentage of 33.9.

Testing at the Royal Melbourne Hospital and the CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology Leather Research Centre confirmed the advantages of medical sheepskin in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.Pressure Ulcer Treatment Sheepskin coats, vests, and boots are common in the traditional dress of peoples throughout the Old World (wherever sheep are raised). They seem to be especially popular in the steppes of Eastern European and Northern Asia, and according to the French knight Robert de Clari, they were part of the national costume of the Cuman people who lived there circa 1200CE. In Ukraine a sheepskin coat is called a kozhukh and a vest a kozhushanka are an iconic part of the national costume, while in Russia the same coat was usually called tulup. In Spain such a coat is called a zamarra, in Tibet a chuba, in Kazakh a ton, in Romania a cojoc,. In the English- speaking world, one may speak of a shearling coat. During the 1970s in Britain the suedehead subculture adopted this item as an identifying fashion, and it also had some popularity with hippies in North America. Sheepskin-lined Ugg boots became popular worldwide in the late 1990s. The use of sheepskin seat covers in moving vehicles dates back centuries,Sheepskin Seat Covers History Retrieved on 15 September 2015 perhaps as long ago as the Bronze Age, when wagons and carriages were first used. The more sophisticated, tailor-made sheepskin car seat covers of the modern era have been popular in Europe for decades, and grew in great popularity in the United States in the mid 1970s. Quality The quality of the skin used in each application depends on several factors, mostly whether the pelt, which is the back of the hide, will be visible or not. Where the pelt is visible, better quality hide with minimal seed will be used. Seed contamination is where patches of scar tissue remain, resulting from a healed seed burrow wound during the animal's life. This scar tissue can fall out leaving small holes after the pelt is processed or it can remain in place leaving imperfections in the pelt which cannot be corrected. Seed contamination is graded as follows:Sheepskin Seed Contamination Gradings Retrieved on 12 January 2009 #\\"No Visible Seed\\" - Visually free of seed contamination. This does not however mean the skin is completely free of seed, only visually free. #\\"Light Seed\\" - Slight seed contamination visible in the wool but minimal mainly concentrated in the belly regions. #\\"Medium Seed\\" - Light seed contamination is present over most of the wool surface but is concentrated around the belly area and the legs. #\\"Heavy Seed\\" - Heavy contamination extending through the majority of the wool but especially prevalent around the belly area and the legs. #\\"Burry\\" - Wool contaminated with hard seed. Can vary from light to heavy concentration. This level of seed can cause problems if it is not removed before fleshing starts as the rollers can sometimes punch them through the skin. In general, wool affected by skin diseases is not usable. Other problems include louse infestation, dead wool and regrowth.

Historic aircraft wrecks as archaeological sites. Bulletin of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology, 28: 81–90. It is an activity practiced by both enthusiasts and academics in pursuit of finding, documenting, recovering, and preserving sites important in aviation history. For the most part, these sites are aircraft wrecks and crash sites, but also include structures and facilities related to aviation. It is also known in some circles and depending on the perspective of those involved as aircraft archaeology or aerospace archaeology and has also been described variously as crash hunting, underwater aircraft recovery, wreck chasing, or wreckology .  History of aviation archaeology and current issues  The remains of a Royal Canadian Air Force DC-3 Dakota crashed on 19 January 1946. The activity dates to post-World War II Europe when, after the conflict, numerous aircraft wrecks studded the countryside. Many times, memorials to those involved in the crashes were put together by individuals, families, landholders, or communities. B-17 turbocharger, crash debris Crash sites vary in size and content; some may have fuselages, engines, and thousands of parts and debris. Other sites, like in civilian/commercial crashes, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) will have almost all of the aircraft and debris removed; which makes aviation archaeology more challenging. Remains of military aircraft crash sites may also be removed by various aircraft restoration groups, particularly if the aircraft was found largely intact. In general, most recent-day (since the 1980s) aircraft crashes are removed entirely, due to environmental regulations, leaving very little to indicate the existence of a wreck. For example, military crashes in Arizona originate from numerous air bases, past and present. Because of the warm and sunny weather, much of the U.S. Army Air Forces flight training was located in the state, both during and after WWII. Numerous air bases dotted the states – creating conditions for numerous training accidents.Arizona Crash History Old abandoned US Army Air Corp auxiliary fields and those converted to city municipal airports provide archaeological sites to be researched and investigated. Measure, photograph and log aircraft debris. Keeping a record of a crash site, such as photographs, maps, journals, logs, and all terrain and weather recordings are essential, i.e. the Glenwood Springs, Colorado, B-17 crash site or the Tells Peak, CA, B-17 crash site. B-17 crash debris. The internet is an ideal media for sharing, recording, educating, and promoting aviation archaeology as a hobby, as well as research projects for local and state aviation historical groups. For identifying aircraft type and manufacturer by part numbers and manufacturing inspection stamps can be analysed. From detailed GPS data & maps, to researching accident reports information, numerous resources help create a complete picture of the historic event. Accident reports, such as the official US Air Force Accident ReportSterling City, TX, B-36 Accident Report Form 14 becomes the foundation of archaeology research. From there, newspaper articles, county clerk records, sheriff & coroner reports, and library records all aid an aviation archaeologist in their research.  Protection laws and regulations  = United States = Legal protection of aircraft wreck sites is highly variable. In terms of protection by aircraft ownership, the U.S. Navy retains indefinite ownership of all Naval aircraft, including terrestrial or submerged wreck sites. The U.S. Air Force has no policies regarding disturbance of vintage aircraft wreck sites, unless human remains or weaponry remain unrecovered at the site. For vintage aircraft, including vintage military aircraft, that are usually considered abandoned when wrecked, the wreck site and all associated contents are subject to the protection laws of the land upon which it rests. The language of cultural heritage protection laws are not aviation specific, so all protection laws pertaining to aviation sites are based on interpretation. Most federal and state laws are, however, explicit in describing cultural resources as either ‘objects, sites, or otherwise, of historic value’National Historic Preservation Act 1966 Public Law 102-575 16 U.S.C. 470wNational Historic Landmarks Program 36CFR65 et seq. or ‘military or social history’California public resources code Section 5020-5029.5 and deem the time limit as over fifty years old. If an aircraft wreck is over fifty years old, which includes all aviation wreck sites from WWII, and crashed on what is currently federal lands, the sites are automatically protected under National Park Service Law 36CFR2.1 against disturbance of any kind without a permit. Aviation sites, for example, a vintage hangar on an airport or a wreck site on the path of a proposed highway, are also immediately subject to Section 106 review if they are to be disturbed by a project that either requires a federal permit or uses federal funds. In most cases, the State Historic Preservation Officer will determine whether or not an aviation site is eligible for the register. The National Register deems aviation wreck sites as “any aircraft that has been crashed, ditched, damaged, stranded, or abandoned”. It designates the protection terms for aviation history sites as well, including abandoned airfields or facilities sites, testing or experimental sites, land or water air terminals, or airway beacons and navigational aids. State lands protection laws vary widely across the nation but the language describing a historical resource is the same as federal laws. Therefore, aviation properties and aircraft wrecks on State lands can be protected under various environmental, public resource, and historical property laws as outlined per state for the protection of archaeological and historic resources. Any archaeological survey, excavation, or activity that disturbs wither wreck or aviation property remains can, in some cases, be permitted on federal and state lands under a permitting process through the regulating entity. If an aircraft wreck, or the remains of any aviation property, is located on private land it is not automatically protected by any federal, state, or local law and any survey or excavation work must be permitted by the land owner. Under the 'Sunken Military Craft Act’ (SMCA) of 2004, it is illegal to disturb, remove, or injure the wreck sites or associated contents of U.S. Naval or any submerged military aircraft.History.Navy.mil: The Sunken Military Craft Act (US) The act identifies military craft as including any sunken military aircraft or military spacecraft that was owned or operated by a government when it sank, and includes the associated contents. Because of the U.S. Navy's retaining of ownership of all military craft, the act applies to any U.S. Navy aircraft, even if in international or other country's territorial waters. The act also applies to any foreign military craft in U.S. territorial waters. Persons wishing to conduct archaeological or research exploration of any submerged military aircraft can apply to the Naval History and Heritage Command’s Underwater Archaeology Branch for a permit. The U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard has similar policies and permitting requirements to the Navy. The SMCA includes penalties associated with any unauthorized disturbances of sunken military craft as a fine and a liability for the reasonable costs incurred in recovery of archaeological or cultural information, storage, restoration, care, maintenance, and conservation. As a part of federal air regulations, NTSB Part 830, protects any aircraft whose accident cause is under investigation.NTSB Part 830: U.S. Accident Preservation and Reporting Regulations (US) US Federal Registry: 49 CFR Part 830 NTSB officials will routinely seize portions of wrecked aircraft for further analysis. Most of the time, after their study is complete, the sequestered debris is returned to the owners' representation – most often the aircraft's insurance company. However, examples like the reconstructed wreckage of TWA Flight 800 are held in perpetuity by the NTSB to education the public and future investigators on the NTSB's role in transportation safety. = United Kingdom = The laws in the UK cover the remains of all aircraft which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, authorising specific procedures to be performed. For the wreck-chasing hobbyist there is a self-regulating body, the British Aviation Archaeological Council (BAAC), which defines ethical standards of behaviour, coordinates activities and provides a forum for discussion for its member groups. Not all active groups in the UK are members of this organisation.  Types of aviation archaeology sites  = Terrestrial sites = Aviation history sites on land that can be subject to archaeological survey or excavation can include airports (which can contain hangars, terminal, other facilities, etc.), crash sites, monuments, or even properties associated with important persons or events in aviation history. Some examples of potential and current archaeological sites:  Aircraft crash sites  The Loon Lake B-23 Dragon crash site in Payette National Forest, Idaho is a remarkably intact example of an aircraft wreck. The crew survived and was rescued, and some avionics removed from the site, and it currently is the subject of a teaching aviation archaeology field school in various years.  Abandoned airfields  Arlington, CO, 2006 Arlington Airfield: E/W runway looking west. Notice the large sections of asphalt and the vegetation changes along and on the runway, 2006 Abandoned airfields can yield much information of historic information about aviation and related industries. http://airfields-freeman.com From civilian airfields to military airfields, aviation archaeologists can find, uncover, and recover a variety of artifacts, just to name a few: aircraft parts with serial numbers, equipment parts, asphalt or runway material, variety of contamination, structures and foundations, businesses and economics, to community and cultural changes. With the closure of a military airbase, the street system and runways become local expansion of city streets and business; one example is the community conversion of Lowry Air Force Base to a local residential, commercial, and educational environment. Other bases, like the Arlington Auxiliary Army Airfield reverted to farming and ranching. In 1990, 1994, and 1998, archaeologists investigated, using airborne remote sensing studies and limited excavation, a vintage hangar of the Huffman Prairie Flying Field Site at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The investigations were “designed to provide information needed for site management by Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park of the National Park Service. The geophysical and remote sensing investigations revealed magnetic, electromagnetic, and ground penetrating radar anomalies and infrared thermal images associated with the hangar structure. The archaeological excavations located an in situ wood post, posthole features, and artifacts which represent archaeological remains of the actual hangar”.\\"Archaeological, Geophysical, and Remote Sensing Investigations of the 1910 Wright Brothers' Hangar, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio\\" Huffman Prairie Flying Field is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Another example is Hamilton Army Airfield in Novato, California. It was in use from 1929 until 1976. It was eventually turned over to the city of Novato for development of housing. The runway is also part of tidal wetland restoration effort currently underway by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, California Coastal Conservancy, and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.  Abandoned missile silos and sites  California has missile launch sites abandoned by the US Army. Archaeological research includes these sites throughout the United States. Exploring and hiking around abandoned silos and sites may constitute trespassing as well as being dangerous. Permission from current land owners or caretakers is imperative. Research and formal site investigations adds to the historical record of the Cold War. One such site is the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site. In the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is a decommissioned Cold War era Nike Missile base, Nike Missile Site SF-88. In 1954, it was armed with Nike Ajax missiles. In 1958, it was converted to Nike Hercules nuclear missiles. After it was shut down in 1974, it was turned over to the National Park Service, and it open for to the public regularly. = Underwater crash sites = A B-29 \\"Superfortress\\" Serial No. 45-21847 ditched in Lake Mead in 1949. This particular aircraft is listed in the National Register under Criterion C as an example of a significant type of aircraft construction and under Criterion D for it potential to yield important information. The remains of the USS Macon Airship and its associated F9C Sparrowhawks are located at around 1500 feet in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has run survey expeditions to the site, creating photomosaics to track deterioration. The wreck site is listed on the National Register.  Underwater surveying and recovery  Underwater search and recovery is a complex aspect of aviation archaeology. Dive and recovery team have to do extensive research and planning before any recovery is performed. The aircraft site may be left as a memorial and not recovered. Once an aircraft has been located, an underwater survey is conducted before recovery operations begin. Many tasks are established and the research is a long process that requires the detailed review numerous and various sources of information. The complexities include a great deal of preparation, extensive training, precise planning, and very technical equipment and coordination. Conservation has often proved very difficultCanadian Harvard Aircraft Association Dive Recovery Team =Australia= The Australian focus has been on underwater aviation archaeology,Western Australian Museum Broken Wings partly as a result of the interest of the relatively large number of maritime archaeologists and shipwreck conservators in the field. This has resulted in numerous studies and reports, including some cross-fertilization or ideas, theory and techniques with practitioners in other parts of the world, with a strong emphasis on the involvement of conservators.http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/fallenangels/fallenangels.html Underwater aviation archaeology commenced in Australia at the wrecks of the Dornier, Catalina, and Sunderland Flying Boats destroyed by Japanese fighters at Broome in WWII. These lie, both in the intertidal zone, and in deeper water.http://202.14.152.30/collections/maritime/march/treasures/broome/broome.html The study continued in Darwin in the Northern Territory with research and fieldwork at its series of submerged PBY Catalina wrecks,Jung, Silvano (2001). Wings Beneath the Sea: the aviation archaeology of Catalina Flying Boats in Darwin Harbour, Northern Territory. Unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Northern Territory University (now Charles Darwin University), Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. Subsequently, the study has spread to other regions in Australia, partly as a result of the Interest of Flinders University and its postgraduate student body.e.g. Ford, J., 2006. WW Aviation Archaeology in Victoria Australia. Department of Maritime Archaeology. Flinders University. Adelaide. While military aircraft remain the property of their respective governments unless delegated to a third party, submerged aircraft wrecks (such as the wrecks at Broome in Western Australia), have proven to be quite difficult to protect from unauthorized recoveries and looting. Those in Broome are now protected under the provisions of the 1990 Heritage of Western Australia Act.McCarthy, M., Green, J., Jung, S. and Souter, C., 2002. The Broome Flying Boats: Papers relating to the nomination of a suite of flying boat wrecks at Broome to the Register of Heritage Places under the Heritage Of Western Australia Act 1990. Report – Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australian Maritime Museum, No. 170.  As a profession  In America, aviation archaeologists, crosstrained in other areas of study, are found in the employ of Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC), traveling to former war zones throughout the world, to search for the remains of American servicemen and women that have been lost. Many of these losses involve aircraft mishaps in remote and difficult to reach areas. A group of volunteers, under the banner of \\"The BentProp Project\\", have pursued American military wreck sites and remains without disturbing them; their findings are forwarded to JPAC. In Australia and in some other parts of the world, where there are human remains involved, a tendency has been for the armed forces to secure the services of forensic anthropologists and crash investigators. Professional aviation archaeologists may also be involved in the recovery of near-complete examples of wrecked or abandoned aircraft for profit. The clients of these professionals range from private individuals and aviation museums, to government agencies. Often these aircraft are in remote areas, which aids wreckage preservation. Examples include Glacier Girl, a Lockheed P-38 Lightning that was successfully recovered from below the Greenland ice cap, and restored to airworthy condition, and Kee Bird, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress also abandoned on the Greenland ice cap, but severely damaged by recovery efforts.

It was recorded on 15 March 2000, prior to the actual release of Lightbulb Sun, but after it had actually been completed in January 2000. \\"Access Denied\\" was also previously unreleased; it was demoed during Lightbulb Sun writing sessions, but the final album version was not recorded until November 2000. The track \\"Cure for Optimism\\" and the instrumental \\"Untitled\\" were originally released on the \\"Shesmovedon\\" CD single. The former was originally recorded in July 1999, in between the two album sessions, where the latter was an improvised live take version in the studio in March 2000. \\"Disappear\\" recorded during the Lightbulb Sun sessions and was originally released on the \\"Four Chords That Made a Million\\" CD single. \\"Ambulance Chasing\\" was recorded during the Stupid Dream sessions and originally released on the \\"Piano Lessons\\" CD single. \\"In Formaldehyde\\" was recorded during the Lightbulb Sun sessions and was originally released on the \\"Four Chords That Made a Million\\" CD single, although this version does not have a fade out ending. \\"Even Less (Full Version)\\" is a version recorded during the Stupid Dream sessions prior to being edited down to the seven- minute Stupid Dream cut. Part one was the Stupid Dream album version; part two was released on the \\"Stranger by the Minute\\" CD single. The album closer, \\"Oceans Have No Memory\\", is a previously unreleased full band version. The Steven Wilson solo demo version had been recorded during the Stupid Dream sessions and released on the \\"Piano Lessons\\" 7\\" single, where as the full band version was recorded in November 2000. =Unused tracks= Two additional songs from these eras, titled: \\"I Fail\\" and \\"Novak\\", were excluded from this release. The former was an unreleased song from the Stupid Dream sessions which was present on a rare 1997 promo demo (which is composed of demos from Stupid Dream). The latter was an instrumental b-side from Lightbulb Sun sessions, which was released on the vinyl edition of the Shesmovedon single.

He was the first great doge, who reigned for 22 years and set Venice on its path to independence and success. History Maurizio was raised to the dogeship at a time when two tribunes were being elected annually to check the power of the doge. His predecessor had been from a pro-Lombard faction, but Maurizio was a wealthy man from pro-Byzantine Heraclea. He opposed both the strong republican faction, which supported moving towards de facto independence, and the pro-Frankish and pro-Lombard factions. He received the titles of magister militum and hypatos from the Emperor Leo IV.Raixe Venete, el jornale dei Veneti - RaixeVenete.net, el sito Veneto - in lingua veneta (dialetto veneto) The Lombard king Desiderius, in light of the alliance between the papacy and the Frankish king Charlemagne and the strong clerical support for Frankish hegemony in Venice, ravaged the states of the church and Istria, even capturing the doge's son Giovanni. Through the pope, Maurizio sent ambassadors to Charlemagne and his son was released. Maurizio then made the first of many subsequent attempts to create a hereditary dogeship when, in 778, he had his son made a second doge. Maurizio obtained the consent of the emperor of the East for this last act. During Maurizio's final eleven years, the Venetians expanded permanently to the Rialto islands. On the little island of Olivolo (now Castello), he reconsecrated the church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus as that of St Peter. It was raised to episcopal status and was the cathedral of Venice throughout the republican era. The low point of Maurizio's reign was the expulsion from the Pentapolis of Venetian traders for trading in slaves and eunuchs. Maurizio was succeeded by his son on his death. His name, Galbaio, came from his reputed descent from the ancient Roman emperor Galba. Sources *Norwich, John Julius. A History of Venice. Alfred A. Knopf: New York, 1982.

It designs, develops, manufactures, and sells industrial motherboard, industrial PCs, System-on-Module, industrial displays, and ODM/OEM services. DFI was founded by Y.C Lu on July 14, 1981, developing and selling electronics components and add-on cards in the beginning. However, DFI switched to the production of motherboards after searching for potential markets and deciding to focus on the strengths of DFI. Targeting the new growing market in motherboard products, DFI announced the Patent License Agreement with Intel Corporation to build partnership with Intel in 1990 and has been developing and manufacturing motherboard products since 1992. With continuous dedication, DFI quickly gained a reputation in Asia-Pacific region after five years and was awarded Top 10 Motherboard Manufacturer in CRN Magazine from the year 1997 to 1999. Starting from 1998, DFI began to follow the strategies of Intel by releasing Intel 440BX series motherboards, 810 motherboards, and 810e motherboards to worldwide markets. Since its growing advances in manufacturing motherboards, DFI was awarded the Intel Global Demo Board manufacturer award in 1998 and 1999 respectively. Catering to the growing market of high-end motherboards, DFI developed advanced overclocking motherboards, the LanParty series, which has proven to be a valuable segment for small powerful computers that meet the requirements of end users in the 2000s. DFI introduced the junior lineup (“JR”) with two products, p45 and 790gx, in the beginning, which has since been extended with Nvidia and X58 chipsets. There are other LanParty series like LT, DK(Dark), and Lanparty UT. With blossoming business in the market, DFI went public and launched its initial public offering (IPO) on January 15, 2000. DFI has already gained a reputation from its motherboard products and hot-selling lineup, LanParty, at that time. And aside from developing LanParty consumer products, DFI started to develop ACP (Application Control Platform) businesses, mainly targeted at vertical applications in slot machine, POS, security system, and so on since 2002. In 2005, DFI gained over 50% revenues from this new business. With this successful transformation, industrial computer became the primary business of DFI.

In 2011, it had 1,223 members. History As far as is known, Scouting was not introduced to the region during the khanate period of the pre-Soviet era. In 1990 a conference (or Congress) of people interested in Scouting was held in Moscow. Viktor Deimund (now the President of the Scout Movement of Kazakhstan) represented Kazakhstan at the Congress. The Congress established the Association of Russian Scouting Renaissance. The homegrown Scout troops within Kazakhstan joined the membership of the Ural Scout Region. Viktor Deimund and Oleg Mozheyko organized the first Scout Troops in Kazakhstan in 1991. Republic-wide newspapers published the first articles on the work of Pavlodar Scout troops. Shortly thereafter, hundreds of letters came to Pavlodar from people asking for help to create Scout units. Pavlodar Scout leaders published and sent out Scouting literature, and Scout troops were created in different cities and parts of Kazakhstan. On December 28, 1992, the Organization of the Scout Movement of Kazakhstan was registered in the Ministry of Justice, and in 1993 Scout leader training courses were made available. An All-Republic Camp (National Jamboree) \\"Jasybay's Arrow\\" was held in the summer at Jasybay, a national camp near Bayanaul National Park, Pavlodar Province, named for a Kazakh mythic hero. 1994 saw both the publication of handbook \\"Scouting for Everybody\\" and the participation of Kazakhstan Scouts in a World Scout Committee Informative Council on Scouting in Crimea. During the Council, President Deimund discussed the development of Scouting in Kazakhstan with Doctor Jacques Moreillon, the Secretary General of WOSM. Leaders of Kazakh Scouts took part in the international seminar \\"Scouting: Youth without Borders\\" in Morocco. In 1995, Kazakhstan's Scouts were represented at the 18th World Scout Jamboree in the Netherlands by a small group. Since 1994 the Organization of the Scout Movement of Kazakhstan has received financial and organizational support from the German Scout Association Bund der Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder (BdP), with which they share an exchange program. 20 Guides and Scouts from the BdP travelled to Kazakhstan for the National Camp in 2002. Every year Guides and Scouts from the OSMK and BdP meet each other in camps or training courses either in Germany or Kazakhstan, helping and learning from each other. In 2006 8 Guides and Scouts from the BdP travelled to Kazakhstan for the National Camp. In 1999, Kazakhstan held the First International Scout Camp \\"Kakharman-99\\", and in 2003 held WINGS2003, a subcamp for 10 to 14-year-olds. On October 5, 2004, the Internet Access and Training Program (IATP) brought together 20 Scouts from Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for a two-hour online discussion of their activities from the IATP access sites in five cities in Kazakhstan and three in Uzbekistan, aimed to bring together representatives of the Scouting movements from these countries to promote friendship and cooperation. Scouts from Kazakhstan named as their main challenge a lack of funds, and the difficulty of building a successful fundraising operation. With the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, it was suggested that the Türkiye İzcilik Federasyonu assist in the creation of Scouting movements in the Turkic Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but it is uncertain if this plan ever materialized. WOSM recognition In October 2007, the World Scout Bureau received an application for membership in WOSM from the OSMK. In accordance with the requirements of the WOSM Constitution, the World Scout Committee considered this application at its meeting from September 28 to 30, 2007, and recommended that it be accepted. The OSMK was declared a WOSM member on January 16, 2008. In becoming a member of WOSM, OSMK will become a member of the Eurasia Scout Region, if it so desires. If Kazakhstan had chosen not to become a member of the Eurasia Region, they would have been eligible to join the European Region, as Germany was responsible for the support of OSMK. The WOSM constitution contains no obligation for National Scout Organizations to join the regions, but it is strongly expected. Program and ideals Kazakhstan Scouts are expected to hold spiritual values and national loyalty, but the organization does not discriminate by faith or ethnic origin. Scouts are also expected to live up to the Scout Oath and Law and to serve their communities, which they accomplish through such activities as working with handicapped children and cleaning natural areas. The program's goal is to strengthen character and promote healthy minds, bodies and spirits in participants. The OSMK presently has no property except a headquarters. OSMK favors youth membership and youth involvement through an active strategy to recruit youth members. The adult policy aims at supporting leadership and recruitment of volunteers. OSMK is open to girls and boys, women and men, in four age sections: *Junior Scouts-ages 7 to 10 *Scouts-ages 11 to 14 *Senior Scouts-ages 15 to 17 *Scout leaders are over 18 The Scout Motto is Dayyin Bol, translating as Be Prepared in Kazakh, and Bud' Gotov, translating likewise in Russian. The noun for a single Scout is Скаут in both languages. Kazakh Scouts wear a dark green uniform. The membership badge of the Organization of the Scout Movement of Kazakhstan incorporates elements of the flag of Kazakhstan set inside the Rub El Hizb (۞). The National Council, composed of eleven members, includes seven women and four men. OSMK has three regularly employed professional staff. The Council Chairman is Victor Georgievich Deimund, and the International Commissioner is Mrs. Ainur Shaikhimova Abylayevna. Scout Oath On my honor, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and the Motherland, to help other people and to obey the Scout Law.

Cook, George Stults and Ashley Peldon. It is set during the time of the so-called \\"Phoenix Lights\\", one of the largest UFO sightings ever. Plot A group of friends, including Matt, his fiancée Lily, his sister Molly, along with Joe and June, embark on a trip to Las Vegas, NV in an RV. After getting lost on a shortcut, they notice lights in the sky that appear to be following the RV. While entranced by them, they crash while swerving to miss a stranded motorist called Richard. Joe is injured by a knife in the crash. Unfortunately, the knife is dangerously close to an artery, forcing them to leave it in. While searching for assistance, Molly becomes acquainted with Richard, who was a POW who was tortured by the Iraqis in the Gulf War. When they return, Matt witnesses strange shapes and noises in the brush. Joe's condition deteriorates, due to damage to his artery, forcing the group to search for additional assistance. They find a house with a working phone. The group realize Matt has disappeared, when aliens surround them. Richard shoots at them, killing Matt in the process. Richard returns to the RV and tells the others of the aliens, while not mentioning Matt's fate. Molly forces her way out of the RV to find Matt, but is sucked up by a green light. As Joe's breathing stops, June is pulled out of the RV. The RV shakes violently and the windows burst inward, prompting the survivors to flee, eventually ending up in an abandoned shack, where Richard props a heavy table against the door. The aliens break in and overrun the building. Lily and Richard are subsequently captured Richard regains consciousness inside an organic chamber. He finds Lily having her three-month-old fetus removed by the aliens. In an act of mercy, he kills her. The aliens restrain Richard and begin operating on him. Some time later, a police officer patrols a deserted area, where he finds Richard. The end credits state that Richard was found about one hundred miles away from his broken down car and that no trace of anything else was ever found.  Cast  * Jason Connery as Richard * A. J.

War Savings Stamps in New York City in 1918 War savings stamps were issued by the United States Treasury Department to help fund participation in World War I and World War II. Although these stamps were distinct from the postal savings stamps issued by the United States Post Office Department, the Post Office nevertheless played a major role in promoting and distributing war savings stamps. In contrast to Liberty Bonds, which were purchased primarily by financial institutions, war savings stamps were principally aimed at common citizens. During World War I, 25-cent Thrift stamps were offered to allow individuals to accumulate enough over time to purchase the standard 5-dollar War Savings Certificate stamp. When the Treasury began issuing war savings stamps during World War II, the lowest denomination was a 10-cent stamp, enabling ordinary citizens to purchase them. In many cases, collections of war savings stamps could be redeemed for Treasury Certificates or War Bonds. World War I era The United States Treasury Department issued its first war savings stamps in late 1917 in order to help pay for the costs incurred through involvement in World War I. The estimated cost of World War I for the United States was approximately $32 billion, and by the end of the war, the United States government had issued a total of $26.4 billion in debt. Although national campaigns had aimed to sell $2 billion in war savings stamps, they ultimately accounted for about $0.93 billion, or 3.5 percent, of the total debt issued.United States Department of the Treasury. United States Government War-savings Stamps Despite the low proportion of total debt purchased as war savings stamps, they represented real additional savings whereas other issues were at least partly monetized already. In addition, government and society leaders utilized the war savings stamps program as a vehicle to teach the importance of saving and thrift. =War Savings Certificate stamps= The primary, interest-earning stamp issued was the War Savings Certificate stamp, which was worth 5 dollars at maturity on January 1, 1923. These stamps needed to be affixed to an engraved folder called the War Savings Certificate, which carried the name of the purchaser, and could only be redeemed by that individual. Between December 3, 1917 and January 31, 1918, each stamp could be purchased at the price of $4.12. If purchased on January 2, 1918, the return on the investment would be 4 percent, compounded quarterly. The price of the stamp increased by one cent for each month after January 1918 until sales ended in December 1918. Owners of these stamps could also redeem them for cash prior to the maturity date and receive the amount paid plus one cent for every month after the original purchase. The Treasury issued a new series of War Savings Certificate stamps in subsequent years, with the same interest rate and time to maturity. The final series of War Savings Certificate stamps were issued on December 21, 1920, maturing on January 1, 1926.Charles, Harry K. (2008). Postal and Treasury Savings Stamp Systems: The War Years \\"Joan of Arc saved France--Women of America, save your country--Buy War Savings Stamps\\", poster for World War I war savings stamps, 1918. =Thrift stamps= Along with the War Savings Certificate stamps, the Treasury also issued a set of 25-cent Thrift stamps, which bore no interest. The purpose of the Thrift stamps was to allow individuals without the means to purchase a War Savings Certificate stamp outright to gradually accumulate enough Thrift stamps to exchange for one later. The Treasury supplied Thrift cards, to which a total of sixteen Thrift stamps could be affixed. A full Thrift card was worth four dollars and could be combined with the appropriate number of cents to purchase a War Savings Certificate stamp. =Promotional efforts= Promotion of war savings stamps pervaded American culture during World War I. The Treasury Department established the War Savings Organization in order to coordinate marketing efforts throughout the nation. A wide variety of posters were produced to promote war savings stamps, often invoking a sense of patriotic duty to purchase them to support war efforts. President Woodrow Wilson called upon “every man, woman and child” to save for the war and designated June 28, 1918 as National War Savings Day.The Telegraph. June 22, 1918. IMPORTANT NOTICE! Governors, mayors, and other political leaders led by example by purchasing war savings stamps and encouraged their constituents to do the same.The New York Times. December 4, 1917. War Thrift Stamps Stir City Patriotism The Four Minute Men organization, authorized by President Wilson, also developed a series of speech outlines related to war savings stamps for its volunteers to deliver.Four Minute Men. January 2, 1918. Bulletin No. 21 Support for war savings stamps also came from a variety of non-government sources. Advertisements were often donated by local newspapers in order to inform people of how war savings stamps worked and to encourage their purchase.The Salem Press. January 24, 1918. Little Brothers of Liberty Bonds War savings societies formed within communities across the country to promote the value of thrift and to collect funds for war savings stamps. Children were also recruited to the war saving efforts primarily through their schools. Children received school kits, which included penny and nickel savings booklets so that children could save up for a 25-cent Thrift stamp a few cents at a time. World War II era The United States Treasury Department began to issue a series of war savings stamps in late 1942. Unlike the War Savings Certificate stamps from World War I, these war savings stamps earned no interest. Instead, their sole purpose was to facilitate saving toward the purchase of Series E war bonds. 10¢ (lowest denomination) \\"Minuteman\\" US War Savings Stamp (rose red) 1942 $5 (highest denomination) \\"Minuteman\\" War Savings Stamp (sepia) 1942 =Minuteman stamps= The war savings stamps introduced during World War II were released in five different denominations – 10 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, one dollar, and five dollars, all featuring a Minuteman statue. These stamps were purchased at face value and earned no interest. Individuals accumulated their war savings stamps in various collection booklets provided with the purchase of a stamp. Filled collection booklets could later be used to purchase Series E war bonds. For example, a full 25-cent booklet contained 75 stamps and was worth $18.75, which was the initial price of a $25 war bond. Thus, a full 25-cent booklet would be exchanged for a $25 war bond with a time to maturity of ten years.Tuttle, William M. (1993). \\"Daddy's Gone to War\\" =Promotional efforts= The promotion of war savings stamps during World War II was closely tied with the promotion of the Series E war bonds. In order to mobilize the home front to support the war efforts ideologically and financially, the Treasury Department's primary message revolved around patriotism. With support from the advertising industry, which donated $250 million worth of advertising during the first three years of the campaign,Samuel, Lawrence R. (1997). Pledging Allegiance war bonds and stamps permeated everyday life. Advertisements appeared as posters on trolley cars, songs on the radio, and movies featuring Hollywood stars like Frank Sinatra and Bob Hope. Utilizing the concept of market segmentation, numerous campaigns were developed to target different populations such as women, immigrants, and children. The Treasury developed classroom material that highlighted the positive impact of war savings stamps while enforcing math skills.United States Department of the Treasury.

His magnum opus, the Qasida Burda, in praise of the Prophet Muhammad, is one of the most popular poems in the world. Biography Al-Busiri was born Muhammad b. Saʿīd b. Ḥammād b. Muḥsin b. Abū Surūr b. Ḥibbān b. ʿAbdullah b. Mallak al-Sanhajī. Al-Maqrizi mentions that his family hailed from the Hammad citadel in Morocco and that they were of the Banu Habnun tribe. He lived in Egypt, where he wrote under the patronage of Ibn Hinna, the vizier. The most famous of these is the Qaṣīda al-Burda (Poem of the Mantle). It is entirely in praise of the last and true prophet of Allah, Muhammad, who cured the poet of paralysis by appearing to him in a dream and wrapping him in a mantle. The poem has had a unique history (cf. I. Goldziher in Revue de l'histoire des religions, vol. xxxi. pp. 304 ff.). Even in the poet's lifetime it was regarded as sacred. Up to the present time its verses are used as amulets; it is employed in the lamentations for the dead; it has been frequently edited and made the basis for other poems, and new poems have been made by interpolating four or six lines after each line of the original. It has been published with English translation by Faizullabhai (Bombay, 1893), with French translation by René Basset (Paris, 1894), with German translation by C. A.

He was reportedly brought to the United States by P.T. Barnum in 1889, age 18 and was a popular Coney Island carnival and circus attraction for 45 years. Prince Randian (credited \\"Rardion\\") was featured in the 1932 film Freaks, his only film appearance, in which he is seen lighting up a cigarette with a match.  Personal life  Randian (whose birth name is unknown) was born with no arms or legs in Demerara, British Guyana. He was Hindu and spoke Hindi, English, French, and German. According to a passenger manifest of SS Parima from April 14, 1917, he had lived previously at Charlotte Amalie, Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. With his wife, known as Princess Sarah (apparently a Hindu woman, born circa 1872), he fathered three daughters and a son. Their children were Mary Randian (born circa 1893), Richard Randian (born circa 1901), Elizabeth Randian (born circa 1904), and Wilhelmina Randian (born circa 1904).List of Alien Passengers for the United States, S.S.

Routine  For his act, Randian wore a one-piece wool garment that fit tightly over his body, giving him the appearance of a caterpillar, snake or potato, and would move himself around the stage by wiggling his hips and shoulders. His best-known ability was rolling and lighting cigarettes using only his lips, but he was also capable of painting and writing by holding a brush or stylus with his lips and of shaving himself by securing a razor in a wooden block. He kept all of the props and materials used in his act in a wooden box that he reportedly constructed, painted and affixed a lock to by himself.

The ship was named in honor of US Navy lieutenant John Gunnell Talbot. Talbot was laid down on 8 April 1897 at Bristol, Rhode Island, by the Herreshoff Manufacturing Co.; launched on 14 November 1897; and commissioned on 4 April 1898, Lt. (jg.) William R. Shoemaker in command. Talbot cruised down the coast, making calls in Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina before arriving at Havana, Cuba, on 2 August. She reported to the flagship and received mail for the blockading squadron. At 2100 hours that evening, while en route to Key West for coal, she sighted the dark hull of a ship off the port bow. Talbot signalled and stopped her engines, but was still rammed by the tug . The bow of the tug penetrated one foot into the torpedo boat's coal bunker, bending in two frames and crushing the side plating to below the water line. The tug towed Talbot to Piedras Cay where temporary repairs were made the next day to enable the damaged ship to proceed to Key West. Talbot reached Key West on the 5th and got underway 10 days later for New York. She arrived at the New York Navy Yard on 6 September and was ready for sea again in early October. The torpedo boat was then assigned to the US Naval Academy for duty supporting midshipmen training, mooring at Annapolis on 10 October. On 11 June 1899, Talbot moved to Norfolk to participate in a one-year evaluation of experimental fuel oils. At the completion of this test program, she resumed her duties at the Naval Academy. Talbot was decommissioned on 20 February 1904 and attached to the Reserve Torpedo Flotilla at Norfolk. She was recommissioned on 31 August 1906 and assigned to special duty between Norfolk and Annapolis. From early 1908 to September 1911, she served at the Torpedo Station, Newport, R.I.. On 22 September 1911, Talbot was reassigned to Indian Head, Maryland, for service as a tender. Before assuming the new duty, she proceeded to Norfolk for her annual inspection and was found to be unfit for further naval use. Talbot was inactivated on 1 May 1912 but retained, \\"in service,\\" as a ferryboat to be operated between the Washington Navy Yard and the naval facilities at Indian Head. When she arrived at Washington, she was manned by a civilian crew and made an average of three trips a week between the two points. Talbot was renamed Berceau on 11 April 1918 and reclassified a ferry boat. On 17 July 1920, she was designated YFB-3. She remained on ferry duty until 18 June 1940 when she was placed out of service and towed to Philadelphia. Berceau was struck from the Navy list on 18 July 1944 and sold for scrap.

Kyrgyzstan has multiple Scout associations, several of which are members of Kyrgyz Respublikasynyn Skaut Kengesh (Кыргыз Республикасынын Скаут Кеңеш), the Kyrgyz Republic Scouting Union. Program and ideals The goals of the Kyrgyz Republic Scouting Union federation are the creation of a Scout movement with a uniquely Kyrgyz character, guidelines for Scout membership and for training of leaders and application to the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM). Among the multiple organizations, some are separated by gender--some for boys, others for girls--while others are coeducational. Various Scout factions in Bishkek agreed in 1995 that they wanted light blue uniforms, as light blue is the Kyrgyz color of courage and generosity (see also Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo), and several world Scouting alumni organizations offered to make uniform insignia for the fledgling Kyrgyz Scouts, free of charge.

Website of Scouts of Kyrgyzstan On October 29, 2004, six Scouts of Kyrgyzstan posted an official website for their organization after a weeklong Web design course at the Internet Access and Training Program (IATP) access site in Bishkek. The website contains pages about Scouting's mission, the history of Scouting in Kyrgyzstan and some of its activities, a copy of the organization's charter, a photo gallery, list of donors, a forum, and contact information. Организация Скауты Кыргызстана (ОСКыр) leader Evgeniî Shmelëv (originally leader of the Speleoklub \\"Надежда\\", the \\"Hope\\" Sporting Association, an early precursor to Scouting locally) remarked, \\"The Scouting movement in Kyrgyzstan is in its initial stage, and we hope to unite people who have common interests and enthusiasm under one identity called 'Scouts'. Moreover, we hope to get support from Scouting movements of foreign countries through the website.\\" The Scouts have pledged to keep their website updated and maintain it as a dynamic, living online resource. It is reported that total registered membership is 300. In 1998-1999, a contingent from Kyrgyzstan planned to attend the 19th World Scout Jamboree in Picarquín, Chile. The Scout Motto is \\"Dayar Bol\\", translating as \\"Be Prepared\\" in Kyrgyz, and \\"Bud' Gotov\\", translating likewise in Russian. The noun for a single Scout is Скаут in both languages. With the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, it was suggested that the Türkiye İzcilik Federasyonu assist in the creation of Scouting movements in the Turkic Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, but it is uncertain if this plan ever materialized.

Profile =Early years= The daughter of Evan Ebenezer Biss, Inspector of Schools in the Colonial and Indian Service, and Amelia Bagshaw Johnstone, she attended Bournemouth High School. =Education= Irene Biss, as she then was, first began her undergraduate training at the London School of Economics (1924–25) and later obtained a graduate degree in economics at Girton College (1925–28) of the University of Cambridge, England, where she had been a student of J.M. Keynes, A.C. Pigou, D.H. Robertson and M. Dobb. This was followed by further studies for a master's degree (1928–29) in Social Research and Social Work at Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, U.S.A. =Career= Spry's formal career as an economic historian began when she joined the Department of Political Economy at the University of Toronto in 1929 where she collaborated with the late H.A. Innis and taught Canadian economic history. Her marriage in 1938 to the late Graham Spry, and subsequent births of their three children, Robin, Richard and Lib, interrupted her academic career. However, during World War II she did serve actively on the Wartime Prices and Trade Board and its later affiliate, the Commodity Prices Stabilization Corporation, in Ottawa and, during the early postwar years, went to England and co-founded Saskatchewan House with her husband, broadcast reformer Graham Spry, who was Agent-General for Saskatchewan in London from 1946 to 1967. Spry's work in the women's movement blossomed during her time in London. She represented the Federated Women's Institutes of Canada at the Associated Country Women of the World from 1954 to 1967, including service as the group's executive chair from 1959 to 1965. Her formal academic career eventually resumed in 1967, first at the University of Saskatchewan and finally at the University of Ottawa in 1968, where she would remain for the rest of her life. Though officially retiring in 1973, Spry continued to teach courses at Ottawa's Department of Economics until the early 1980s and, indeed, gave lectures in Canadian economic history as recently as 1995. Throughout her retirement years, she maintained a strong intellectual presence at the University of Ottawa, and could be seen regularly at the National Archives of Canada with a magnifying glass to compensate for her worsening eyesight. Spry met regularly with colleagues and friends who shared her interests in Canadian economic history and public policy and who espoused the social democratic principles that she had relentlessly defended throughout her adult life, beginning with her membership in the League for Social Reconstruction in the 1930s. Moreover, she had an exceptional knowledge of the economic and social problems of countries other than Canada, notably of Europe. =Research= Professor Emeritus Spry died in her Ottawa home peacefully on December 16, 1998, at the age of 91. Her most recent book on the early economic history of Western Canada, entitled From the Hunt to the Homestead, was at the time due to be co-published by the University of Alberta and University of Calgary Presses. This latter work would largely have completed a line of research on Western Canadian economic history that began with her first two major books on the Palliser Expedition, published respectively in 1963 and 1968, which were then followed by her research on the records of the Department of the Interior regarding Canada’s western frontier of settlement, published in 1993. In addition to Spry's authoritative work on the Palliser Expedition, her research on how the Canadian prairies transitioned from a commons to open access resources and, finally, to private property helped extend a branch of work often well-known even beyond the disciplines of economics and history, for instance in the prominence given Innis and the staples thesis in Canadian communications thought. Spry's comparison of the loss of the commons in England to the end of First Nations' communal rights, in particular, would echo much subsequent research on private intellectual property in contradistinction to communal resources. * Spry, Irene M.

He also hosted a daily radio show on afternoon drive for WBLS. Earthquake performed a half-hour HBO special as part of the series One Night Stand, which first aired on August 26, 2005. He also had a small role in Kevin Smith's film Clerks II, and a supporting role in the film The Longshots. He had a recurring role as Chris' Uncle Mike, on Everybody Hates Chris.

Early life  Nathaniel “Earthquake” Stroman was born on May 29, 1963, in Washington, D.C.. His mother gave him the nickname “Earthquake”. She said: “Any time you take all the precautions not to have a kid, from the diaphragm to .... a condom, and you still have a child, there's nothing else you can name that child but a natural disaster.\\" Earthquake grew up poor with his mother in a tough southeast neighborhood, and they often didn’t have anything to eat. \\"You can't have dreams when you're hungry,\\" he pointed out. \\"That's why when I was in school I used to get F's in my first four classes before lunch.\\" Earthquake was a class clown, but had no real idea that he could make comedy a career. He later bemoaned the fact that no teacher or advisor had ever pointed him in the direction of performing. He enlisted in the United States Air Force the day after he graduated from high school. Later he explained that he joined the military to get out of his mother’s house. He said, '... Everybody was all saying, Hey, man, you don't want to go in there, people are gonna be hollering at you about everything,' but I'm, like, 'Shoot, I got a woman hollering at me right now, putting her hands on me, and she ain't givin' me no check for it.

Dodging the many traps of crime and drugs Nathaniel Stroman enlisted in the Air Force the day directly after his graduation. As stated by Nathaniel Stroman to Matt Ehlers of the Raleigh News and Observer “My mother argued with me, hollered at me, and I wasn't getting a check, so how hard could basic training be?”. Stroman would go on to have an eleven year career with the Air Force spending time on bases located in places like Florida, California, and the Japanese Island of Okinawa. Through his hard work and dedication to his cause Stroman was able rise through the ranks all the way to a Sergeant in the Air Force. Despite his dedication to the military Earthquake’s military career ended during the Gulf War of 1991. Stroman refused to participate in a war that he deemed unnecessary. “I didn’t want to go over there and fight for oil” he told Richmond Times-Dispatch. Nathaniel joined the military in an attempt to further his education while serving his country and bettering himself, but once the Persian Gulf War broke out Stroman was not in support of the violence that would soon follow in consequence. Due to Stroman's disapproval of the War he became a conscientious objector and was dishonorably discharged from the Air Force of which he had served 11 years of his life to. The briefly explained his position in his military standing slipping away and feeling isolation and almost pressure to agree with the actions of the United States Military. He stated that he felt that those that were less enthusiastic about the war were isolated and eventually guided towards leaving the military. Early comedic career In the early 1990s, Earthquake started off doing gigs in small clubs. By 1993 he co-owned Uptown Comedy Corner in Atlanta's vibrant Buckhead entertainment district. While there he continued to hone his skills as the much sought after house host and featured some of the greatest minds in stand-up. Later he opened a club of his own, Earthquake's Comedy Corner II in Dallas, Tx. and Atlanta, Ga., resepectively. In 1997, Earthquake got his national break when he was asked to join the Russell Simmons Def Comedy Jam Tour. Earthquake started his career in the Airforce in the talent show “Tops and Blues”.

The line was built in the late 19th century by William Murray Ross, with the intention of transporting sugar beet to his sugar beet mill, and the refined product to the Port of Melbourne. When the mill failed to begin production, the line fell into disrepair without being used, and it was eventually dismantled, with the land being sold.  History  Artist's impression of the Rosstown sugar beet mill and railway, in 1876, before construction had begun = Beginnings = William Murray Ross was a local entrepreneur and land owner, who was active on the Caulfield Council during the 1860s. He is most often remembered as the man who conceived of the ambitious, and ultimately unsuccessful, Rosstown Project. This consisted of a large-scale sugar beet processing mill, a railway line to serve it, and a residential estate, named after Ross. In 1875, Ross circulated a broadsheet proposal which detailed the project, and began building the mill that same year. = Approval for the line = Also in 1875, Ross began to seek government approval for a railway to run to the site of his sugar mill from Elsternwick railway station, which was part of the Melbourne and Hobson's Bay United Railway Company (M&HBUR;) system. That proposal was rejected and Ross submitted a new one in 1876, this time with the railway to extend past the mill to Oakleigh, which had no rail connection to Melbourne. At the time, a railway to Gippsland was being planned, and with many interested and influential parties involved, the proposal had been a lengthy political saga. The new Gippsland line was originally planned to run from Elsternwick to Gippsland, using the existing M&HBUR; line from Elsternwick to Melbourne. However, the M&HBUR; wanted to charge an exorbitant fee for running rights over its tracks, and so eventually it was decided that the railway to Gippsland would link with a station to be built at Oakleigh. While it might have been beneficial to join the Elsternwick and new Gippsland railways with Ross's cross-suburban line, its difficult negotiations with the M&HBUR; made the Victorian government hesitant to allow another private railway, and Ross's scheme did not gain approval. When Graham Berry became Premier of Victoria in 1877, he appointed John Woods, one of Ross' parliamentary supporters, as Minister of Railways. In July of the same year, a group of members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly visited the sugar works and were impressed with the progress of construction. As a result, a select committee was set up to properly investigate the Rosstown Railway proposal. It produced a very favourable report on 8 August 1877. Due to the dispute over the purchase of the M&HBUR; by the State of Victoria, many more members of government, included Woods, had become wary of privately owned railways. The result was over twelve months of inaction. However, on 16 October 1878, the bill allowing construction of the Rosstown Railway was passed by the Legislative Assembly. On 14 November it passed all stages in the Legislative Council, and received Royal Assent. One of the stipulations of the bill was that the line was to be completed within five years. On 2 April 1879, the Oakleigh to Gippsland railway was opened. = Construction = By the time the \\"Rosstown Junction Railway Act\\" had been passed, Ross was already in debt and was struggling to raise the capital required to begin construction of the railway. He raised six thousand pounds through the Bank of New Zealand and work finally began in 1883, with the first rails being laid in November. Ross used iron rails from the Victorian Railways which, although lighter than steel rails, were cheaper. The Railways co-operated further by building the Elsternwick and Oakleigh junctions at each end of the new line. However Ross clashed with Railways over the Mordialloc line crossing. Ross planned for a simple flat crossing, but the Victorian Railways refused to allow it. Ross had originally owned the land where the crossing was to be, but had sold it to the Victorian Railways, most likely in an attempt to garner favour. With the five- year deadline of the act only a matter of weeks away, Ross had no time to continue the argument. Construction became frantic and many corners were cut to save time. Sleepers were laid on raw earth, and were set apart, instead of the standard of the time. In some places the sleepers had settled into the earth so far that they did not even touch the rails, and when the supply of the sleepers ran out, posts from nearby fences were used. The last section of track was laid after sunset on the last day of the five-year period in 1883. Ross had received permission to exclude the contentious Mordialloc line crossing, which was still missing, and so construction was technically completed within the set time. The Mordialloc line had opened two years previously, with a temporary crossing over the Rosstown railway. An article in The Argus described the scene in 1884: = Reconstruction = In early 1884, Ross flirted with the idea of extending his railway from Elsternwick to the shore of Port Phillip Bay at Elwood (\\"Sea Beach\\"), and then north to St Kilda, over the Elwood Swamp (Map of Proposed Extension). Though it received support from Elwood and St Kilda locals, the idea did not get far. Ross then sought another five-year extension to his rights under the 1878 Act. This was granted, the new act being given Royal Assent on 12 December 1884. However, with his already substantial debt, Ross offered the railway for sale to the Victorian Railways for an unknown sum. When that was rejected, Ross reduced the price two months later to £25,000, and then dropped it to £20,000 a week after that. The Victorian Railways Commissioners were pushing for the State to own all railways, and a purchase bill was submitted to Parliament. However the bill was withdrawn when it was successfully argued that it was too great a risk to buy a poorly constructed railway that was not even operating. By the end of 1885, already two years into his five-year extension, Ross became resigned to the fact that he was going to have to construct the line properly. With credit running out, Ross carried out the reconstruction when he could, but it was soon obvious that he was not going to meet the new deadline. There another setback in 1886 when an agreement was reached with the Victorian Railways about raising the Mordialloc line to cross the Rosstown Line on a bridge. Ross was to arrange and pay for the necessary work, with the Victorian Railways reimbursing him two-thirds of the cost upon completion. Initially, to keep expenditure down, Ross planned to provide a simple wooden bridge, but that was unacceptable to the Railways, and a tender was advertised to have an engineering firm design and construct an iron bridge. The total project cost came to £5,850. The single-track bridge was opened on 17 June 1887, and widened to a double-track one in 1888. On 17 November 1888, the last day of the five-year extension, the Rosstown Railway line reconstruction was still not finished. Ross wrote to the Victorian Railways telling them that the line would be completed in approximately three months, after which he would settle the many and various outstanding debts he had with them. = Rolling stock = Although the Rosstown Railway has become infamous as an abject failure, the tracks were used from time to time. Construction and ballast trains were often on the line in the late 1880s and early 1890s, hauled by Victorian Railways locomotives that had been hired by Ross. The largest of these was a Y-class locomotive that was used on ballasting runs. Tenders had been let for the construction of rolling stock to be used by Ross, but nothing ever came of those. As for passenger trains, authors of the Rosstown Historical Research Group's book, Return to Rosstown, note: : :Ross was well aware of [the] \\"problems\\" associated with his \\"Statutory Date\\". In autobiographical notes penned some years later, he claimed that on 14 November 1888 he hired two carriages from the Victorian Railways, and using one of the company locomotives ran what is known as the best-known feature of the Rosstown railway stories—the \\"only\\" train—that is, of course, besides the numerous other trains for construction purposes between September 1888 and March 1891. : :According to Ross, passengers on his train included Thomas Bent, and the well-known legal men, Malleson and Riggall. He said that the train ran from the platform at Elsternwick and \\". . . ran to Oakleigh platform, stayed a while for refreshments, and went back to Grange Road where the company got out and adjourned to Mr. Ross's house, where they dined. This is mentioned as proof that the line was constructed and in such a substantial manner as to permit of a heavy engine drawing two loaded carriages to pass over it . . .\\" : :It is rather odd that not one of the Melbourne daily papers, nor any of the local weekly papers, mentions this run. The Brighton Southern Cross, at least, always reported Rosstown Railway work quite fully. One reason for the lack of publicity might well have been Ross's wish to avoid the attention of the Board of Land and Works to what was probably an illegal train running. In any case, there had been much movement of men and materials on the line since September, so the significance of the run may have been overlooked by the Board. : :Ross's own account of the \\"first train\\"—that is, for the carriage of passengers—stands up to careful checking much better than all the other versions, printed and otherwise. One of the more detailed of these is Isaac Selby's potted history of Ross and Rosstown. It forms one small part of his 1924 work, \\"The Old Pioneers' Memorial History of Melbourne\\". Selby postulated a link between the occasion of Ross's second wedding and the running of the first \\"train\\"; however, he notes that the idea was handed down. In fact, this is substance of almost every account passed down by word of mouth to certain of the older residents of Caulfield and Carnegie. The tradition is in error. That wedding was in February 1889. In any case, the newspapers in reporting the movements of the wedding party from Holy Trinity Church, East Melbourne, to \\"The Grange\\", Rosstown, made no mention of the required two stages of rail travel.Return To Rosstown (1978) page 80-82 As far as is known, the last locomotive-hauled train was a ballast train run on 21 March 1891. = Decline = Although there were severe financial penalties for missing the deadline, these were never enforced, even with Ross' history of financial troubles with the Victorian Railways. Some historians say that this was because the 1880s saw a land boom in Melbourne and its rapidly expanding suburban areas, and the consequent increase in the value of any land served by rail was eagerly anticipated. Ross still hoped to complete his Rosstown Project, even though the mill had been sitting dormant for many years, full of equipment that had never been used, minus a few losses to burglary in 1889. During the 1890s, Ross continued to try and recover financially, setting up companies from which to hide debt and obtain more credit, none of which were successful. He tried several times to sell the Rosstown Railway to the Victorian Railways, but with the 1890s depression that followed the boom of the previous decade, no-one saw any future for a line that crossed empty paddocks and would see no real traffic. Ross held onto the line until his death in 1904. His failed sugar beet mill, which had been known for many years as \\"Ross' Folly\\", was demolished in 1908. = End of the line = Commemorative plaque in South Reserve at Marara Road, where the line once ran, marking the centenary of the start of construction The National Bank of Australasia offered the line at auction in 1906, with a reserve set at £20,000, but there were no takers. Thomas Bent made an offer of £17,000, which the Bank was ready to agree to when Bent withdrew. In 1911 the Gardenvale and East Elsternwick Progress Association approached the National Bank and negotiated a price in the hope of re-opening the line, with the support of the City of Caulfield. A survey of the line estimated that the cost of repairing and reopening it would be more than £60,000. With no hope of raising that much capital, the idea was abandoned. Five years later, the Caulfield Council asked the government to repeal the two Rosstown Junction Railway Acts and that was done in December 1916. Legally, the Rosstown Railway no longer existed. The rails were pulled up and sold to the Emu Bay Railway in Tasmania. The National Bank began to dispose of the land in 1910, but is wasn't until 1946 that the last portion was disposed of. The Caulfield Council was among the purchasers, turning some of the railway reserve into roads, and what is now Ormond Park, as well as the site of a rubbish tip and incinerator.  Today  Much of the former railway line can be traced through Council reserves and roads that were built where the track once ran. The centenary of the start of construction of the line was celebrated in 1983 with the unveiling of a plaque in South Reserve at Marara Road, one of the more obvious locations where the line once ran.

In December 1875, the station was renamed Howdon-on-Tyne, to prevent it being confused with Howden station in East Yorkshire. Following closure for conversion in the early 1980s, the station was demolished and almost entirely re-built. Only the eastbound platform (trains towards Whitley Bay), clearly identifiable by its stone construction, remained from the original station. The westbound platform was re-built and sited on the opposite side of the level crossing on Howdon Lane, creating a staggered platform arrangement.

Houses in Cunda Island Interior of large former Greek Orthodox cathedral Cunda Island, also called Alibey Island, (), Greek Moschonisi ( or Μοσχόνησος), is the largest of the Ayvalık Islands archipelago in Turkey, which was historically called the Εκατόνησα (Hekatonisa) or Μοσχονήσια (Moschonisia) archipelago in Greek. It lies in the Edremit Gulf on the Turkey's northwestern coast, off the coast of Ayvalık in Balıkesir Province, Turkey, with an area of . It is located east of Lesbos, Greece.  History  = Antiquity = According to written sources, there have been settlements since the antiquity; the sources mention the settlements of Nasos (), Pordoselini or Pordoselene () and Chalkis ().Ayvalık Industrial Landscape = 20th Century = According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Cunda (Yunda) had a total population of 4.671, consisting of 4.417 Greeks, 89 Muslims and 165 foreign citizens.Kemal Karpat (1985), Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics, The University of Wisconsin Press, p. 130-131 Until the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the entire population of the island was Greek. In 1913, Mehmed Reshid visited the island and he suggested the settlement of wealthy Muslim muhacirs on the island in order to control the Greek population. In 1914, persecution against the population started, resulting in the departure of many inhabitants from the island. The bishop Photios, various priests and prominent men were seized, beaten and imprisoned in a mill, to be released only after some days had passed. Men and women were beaten and tortured. Later, the inhabitants were deported to Aivali (the Greek name for Ayvalık) on the mainland without being allowed to take anything with them. In Aivali they shared the same fate of oppression with its Christian inhabitants until they were all deported, and scattered among the Turkish villages of the vilayets of Izmir and Bursa. There they were daily subjected to all kinds of persecutions and dying in great numbers. The churches on the island were looted and turned into warehouses and stables, the lamps and holy images in them were broken, paintings of art destroyed and houses rendered uninhabitable. In 1915, inhabitants of the island were compelled to pay 2,500 Turkish pounds for the uniforms of the Turkish army and 2,000 Turkish pounds for the construction of barracks; to pay a wheat-tax for the upkeep of the navy, and to buy, at no cheap price, post- cards. Also, some inhabitants were killed and tortured. For a short period (1921–1922), the island was the see of a Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishop, while the neoclassical mansion of the last metropolitan, Ambrosios, who was executed by the Turkish army, still survives on the seafront of the island's town center. On September 19, 1922 several hundred of the Greek islanders were killed on Cunda; only some children were spared and sent to orphanages. The next year, following the Treaty of Lausanne and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the few remaining islanders were forced to leave for Greece and were replaced by Cretan Turks and Turks from Lesbos.  Present day  Cunda Island has the character of a typical Aegean resort town. There are frequent bus and ferry services to Cunda Island from the town center of Ayvalık. Cunda Island is connected to Lale Island, and thence to the mainland, by a bridge and causeway built in the late 1960s. This is the first and currently the oldest surviving bridge in Turkey that connects lands separated by a strait. The main landmark of Cunda Island remains the Taxiarchis Church (). The large, former Greek Orthodox cathedral was abandoned and dilapidated, but has now been restored and houses one of the Rahmi M. Koç Museums. Poroselene () bay in the north of the island is among Cunda's main sights. In antiquity, it was the home of a dolphin which saved a drowning boy, according to a story mentioned by Pausanias. In 2007, after a two-year work, all 551 buildings in Cunda Island were inspected and registered by the Turkish Science Academy and Yıldız Technical University Faculty of Architecture, as part of the \\"Culture of Turkey inventory project\\".

The operation was designed to bring stability to the region by bringing in a military presence during the negotiations between Iraq and the UN over weapons of mass destruction. The name Operation Desert Thunder has been applied to the build-up of forces in the Persian Gulf region during 1998. If an actual attack had been ordered and executed, the name would have changed to Operation Desert Viper. In the autumn of 1997 CENTCOM established a force of 35,000 air, land, and sea forces in response to Iraq's non-compliance of UN resolutions. CENTCOM Commander-in-Chief General Anthony Zinni established a permanent Coalition/Joint Task Force (C/JTF) at Camp Doha in Kuwait under command of Lieutenant General Tommy Franks to lead this force. The coalition would consist of forces from Argentina,globalsecurity.org Desert Thunder Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, United Kingdom, United States, and Kuwait. On 18 January 1998 additional forces were brought in to support the U.S.-led coalition forces in the region. The U.S. 3d Infantry Division of Fort Stewart, Georgia, deployed 4,000 personnel and 2,900 short tons of equipment on 120 aircraft. Elements of 32nd Air and Missile Defense Command and 2nd Battalion 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (82nd Airborne Division, Fort Bragg, NC) deployed to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain. The 366th Air Expeditionary Wing from Mountain Home Air Force Base, ID replaced the 347th Air Expeditionary Wing of Moody AFB, Georgia on 1 April 1998 after 120 days of deployment. USS George Washington (CVN-73) joined USS Nimitz (CVN-68) (relieved on-station by USS Independence (CV-62) a few months later) in the Gulf. Combined with the British HMS Invincible (R05) and HMS Illustrious (R06), there were now 50 ships and submarines with 200 naval aircraft, a floating brigade (Army) and the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit in the Persian Gulf. This combined muscle forced Saddam to back down, and the Independence returned to Yokosuka, Japan in early June 1998. In July 1998 the 3-101st Attk Avn Bn deployed two AH-64A Companies to Ali Al Salem AB to maintain a strong presence in the region. Then in November 1998, the U.S. 3d Infantry Division returned to Kuwait. Using the C/JTF already in place advanced elements of the U.S. 3d Infantry Division and 32nd Air & Missile Defense Command, Theatre Support Command, and Air Support Operations Center deployed. In addition the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force joined the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force already in place. During this build-up, UN Secretary- General Kofi Annan flew to Baghdad to meet with Saddam Hussein and negotiated to allow uninterrupted inspections. On 11 November 1998, further non- compliance by Iraq resulted in the initiation of Operation Desert Thunder. CENTCOM moved its forces into position to initiate strikes into Iraq; 2,300 additional personnel were deployed during this operation. On the evening of 15 November, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69) was just minutes away from launching air strikes on targets in Iraq when Saddam Hussein again backed down. In December 1998, Iraq again refused to allow inspections and Operation Desert Fox began. Several key Iraqi facilities and specialized equipment were destroyed during several days of air strikes including from the flight deck of USS Enterprise (CVN-65) . This set back the Iraqi ballistic missile program by several years.

Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively. Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-α-hydroxylase (rate- limiting step in bile acid synthesis), and cholesterol does the opposite. This is why chenodeoxycholic acid, and not cholic acid, can be used to treat gallstones (because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids. Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids. Medical uses Cholic acid, sold under the brand name Cholbam, is approved for use in the United States and is indicated as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for peroxisomal disorders (such as Zellweger syndrome). It was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and is sold under the brand name Orphacol. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile-acid synthesis due to 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged one month to 18 years and adults. Cholic acid FGK was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2015. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects: * sterol 27-hydroxylase (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX) deficiency; * 2- (or alpha-) methylacyl- CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency; * cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency. The most common side effects include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), acid reflux (stomach acid flowing up into the mouth), esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), skin problems (lesions) and malaise (feeling unwell). Structure of cholic acid showing relationship to other bile acids =Overdose= When given in high doses, cholic acid replacement therapy has been linked to minor elevations in serum aminotransferase levels, but it has not been linked to instances of clinically apparent acute liver injury with jaundice.

The station joined the network in March 2002, following the opening of the extension from Pelaw to South Hylton. The station originally opened in June 1839, under the Brandling Junction Railway, and was named Boldon Colliery between March 1925 and July 1991. Along with other stations on the line between Fellgate and South Hylton, the station is fitted with vitreous enamel panels designed by artist, Morag Morrison. Each station uses a different arrangement of colours, with strong colours used in platform shelters and ticketing areas, and a more neutral palate for external elements. The station was used by 216,060 passengers in 2017–18, making it the fourth- least-used station on the Wearside extension. History The original station opened in June 1839, as part of the Brandling Junction Railway, and consisted of only one platform, located on the line towards Newcastle. This meant that trains towards Sunderland were required to cross over onto the opposite track, in order to allow passengers to board and alight – an arrangement quite common on other railways in the area, such as . This arrangement resulted in an accident on 6 December 1870, causing five deaths. The subsequent investigation led to changes in the law, as well as the construction of a second platform, to the east of the existing one, to serve Sunderland-bound trains. When the station was converted for use by the Tyne and Wear Metro, the westbound platform was relocated opposite the newer eastbound platform. The station was originally a busy junction, as the former Stanhope and Tyne Railway route from Tyne Dock to Consett and Waskerley via Washington crossed the Brandling Junction Railway on the level, just to the east of the station at Pontop Crossing, with various curves being laid in to connect the two routes. Since the 1850s, passenger traffic has only taken place on the present east–west route, however the former north–south line was used by freight traffic as late as 1966. The station was renamed Boldon Colliery by the London and North Eastern Railway in March 1925, but reverted to its original name in July 1991. As well as Seaburn, East Boldon and Heworth, Brockley Whins was formerly served by rail services operating along the Durham Coast Line between Sunderland and Newcastle. Following the introduction of Tyne and Wear Metro services to Wearside in March 2002, Heworth is now the only remaining intermediate station served by rail services operating between Sunderland and Newcastle. Facilities Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramped access to platforms at Brockley Whins. The station is also equipped with ticket machines, waiting shelter, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins.

He played in Major League Baseball as an catcher from 1987 to 2003. Although Prince didn't produce impressive offensive statistics, he excelled defensively as a catcher which enabled him to sustain a seventeen-year playing career with several major league teams. Baseball career Primarily a catcher during his playing career, Prince batted and threw with his right hand. He was listed as tall and 185 lbs. After a successful career at Bradley-Bourbonnais Community High School, Prince was drafted twice by the Atlanta Braves; with the 195th pick of the 1983 January draft, as part of that draft's 8th round, and with the 76th overall pick of that same year's June draft, as part of that draft's 4th round. He elected not to sign both times, instead attending Kankakee Community College. There, he attracted the attention of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who selected him with the 64th overall pick of the 1984 January draft. This time, he signed the deal, and that summer began play with the Pirates' farm club in the Gulf Coast League. Prince enjoyed a strong defensive reputation as a prospect, but his offensive production fluctuated wildly as he advanced through the system. With the Macon Pirates of the South Atlantic League, he put up an unusually low .208 batting average, but hit for moderate power and drew 96 base on balls in only 360 at bats. Two years later at AA, he put up a .307 batting average with the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League. After a promotion to the AAA Buffalo Bisons of the American Association the next year, his batting average dropped back down to .260 and his walk rate collapsed, but he started hitting for substantially more power, putting up a .451 slugging percentage. He was generally well regarded as a prospect, but talent evaluators weren't sure exactly which skills he would display after promotion to the majors. Prince ultimately settled in as a backup catcher, relying on solid defense to compensate for a weak bat. He would never total even 200 at-bats in a single major league season, but he spent parts of seventeen years in the big leagues with the Pirates, Los Angeles Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies, Minnesota Twins, and Kansas City Royals. During that time, he caught for some of the best pitchers in baseball, including Cy Young winners Doug Drabek and Johan Santana, and six-time All- Star Curt Schilling. Career statistics In a seventeen-year major league career, Prince played in 519 games, accumulating 248 hits in 1,190 at bats for a .208 career batting average along with 24 home runs, 140 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .286. He ended his career with a .992 fielding percentage. Post-playing career After retiring as a player, Prince retained his connection with professional baseball. In , he became the manager of the Williamsport Crosscutters in the New York–Penn League and in his first year, led them to the playoffs. After one more year in Williamsport, Prince became the manager of the Pirates' Gulf Coast League team in Bradenton, Florida in 2007. In 2014, he took the helm as the fourth manager of the Pirates' Advanced-A Bradenton Marauders in Bradenton, Florida. In January 2015, Prince was named as the manager for the Pirates' Double-A affiliate, the Altoona Curve. He spent 2016 as the Pirates' minor league field coordinator and on October 29, 2016, he was named bench coach for the major league team for the 2017 season. On December 3, 2019, Prince was named the manager of the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A affiliate.

Salts of this carboxylic acid are called chenodeoxycholates. Chenodeoxycholic acid is one of the main bile acids. It was first isolated from the bile of the domestic goose, which gives it the \\"cheno\\" portion of its name (Greek: χήν = goose). Structure Chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid are the two primary bile acids in humans. Chenodeoxycholic acid has two hydroxyl groups and is modified with the addition of another hydroxyl group to produce cholic acid. Some other mammals have muricholic acid or deoxycholic acid rather than chenodeoxycholic acid. It occurs as a white crystalline substance insoluble in water but soluble in alcohol and acetic acid, with melting point at 165–167 °C. Biosynthesis and function Chenodeoxycholic acid is synthesized in the liver from cholesterol via several enzymatic steps. Like other bile acids, it can be conjugated with taurine or glycine, forming taurochenodeoxycholate or glycochenodeoxycholate. Conjugation results in a lower pKa. This results in the conjugated bile acids being ionized at the usual pH in the intestine, and staying in the gastrointestinal tract until reaching the ileum to be reabsorbed. CDCA and other bile acids form micelles, which facilitate lipid digestion. After absorption, they are taken up by the liver and resecreted, so undergoing an enterohepatic circulation. Unabsorbed CDCA can be metabolised by bacteria in the colon to form the secondary bile acid, lithocholic acid or the epimer, ursodeoxycholic acid. CDCA is the most potent natural bile acid at stimulating the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR). The transcription of many genes is activated by FXR, including FGF19 and SHP. Therapeutic applications =Gallstones= CDCA has been used as medical therapy to dissolve gallstones. Medical therapy with oral bile acids has been used in patients who have small cholesterol stones, and for patients with larger cholesterol gallstones who are unable or reluctant to have surgery. CDCA treatment can cause diarrhea, mild reversible hepatic injury, and a small increase in the plasma cholesterol level. =Cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis= CDCA can be used in the treatment of cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis. =Other= CDCA has been used in several other conditions. As diarrhea is frequent when CDCA is used in gallstone dissolution, it has been studied as a possible treatment for constipation and has been shown to accelerate colonic transit and improve bowel function. The Australian biotechnology company Giaconda has tested a treatment for Hepatitis C infection that combines chenodeoxycholic acid with bezafibrate.

He played college football at Simon Fraser University. Brown won the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian Award in 2001. He played for the Winnipeg Blue Bombers from 2001 until his retirement in 2011, competing in three Grey Cups: 2001, 2007, and 2011. He was a CFL All-Star eight times. Career Brown was drafted by the Calgary Stampeders 5th overall in the 1997 CFL draft. However, he did not play a game with them and signed with the Buffalo Bills of the NFL, spending his entire time there on the practice squad. Following that he went to play for the Washington Redskins where he played ten games with the NFL team. The 2000 season was a wash, but the end of the season saw his rights traded to Winnipeg from Calgary. He started playing with the Bombers for the 2001 CFL season which saw him named as the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian and a visit to the 2001 Grey Cup game which the Bombers ended up losing. He soon acquired the nickname \\"Big Bird\\" and again won as Winnipeg's MOC award again the following season. Next season, in 2004, Brown won his third recognition as the Bombers' MOC and also won the award for the Most Outstanding Defensive Player. 2006 was another strong season, and arguably his strongest with the Blue Bombers. However, he finished as runner up for the Most Outstanding Canadian award that year. Brown went to the 2007 Grey Cup, his second appearance in the penultimate CFL, but again came up short losing by four points to the Saskatchewan Roughriders. Brown won his fifth CFL All-Star recognition in 2008 and again finished as runner-up for the MODP award. 2009 saw a return to recognition for Brown where he again won Winnipeg's MOC and MODP awards. Despite being one of the oldest players in the CFL, Brown continued to excel during the 2010 Winnipeg Blue Bombers season. He finished with his seventh CFL All-Star naming that year. The 2011 CFL season saw Brown as a member of the self-titled \\"Swaggerville\\" defence for Winnipeg, which was one of the top defences in the league at that time. The 2011 season also saw Brown win his eighth East Division all-star nod. In 2016, he was finally inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. =Statistics= { BORDER=\\"0\\" CELLPADDING=\\"1\\" CELLSPACING=\\"0\\" width=\\"65%\\" style=\\"text- align:center\\" - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\"  Regular season ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"3\\"  Tackles ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Interceptions ! rowspan=\\"99\\" bgcolor=\\"#ffffff\\"  ! colspan=\\"4\\"  Fumbles - bgcolor=\\"#e0e0e0\\" !

During British Raj, in 1930s came a change in the development of middle class localities in Lahore and areas like Krishan Nagar and Sant Nagar were established. They were planned, geometrical in layout and had parks, sewage and drinking water facilities. In the houses in these areas, roofs of the rooms were high like British bungalows. These housing areas were an improved version of the old architecture of Lahore. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu residents migrated to India.

Products in the Prismacolor line are colored and graphite pencils, and soft pastels. Other products include erasers, pencil sharpeners, and cases. In past years, Prismacolor produced watercolor paintings and charcoals. History The Eagle Pencil Company founded in the 1800s in Yonkers, New York on John Street. After 5 years, Daniel Berozlzheimer's son Henry purchased the city's first iron- framed building for the new factory. The company produced pens, pencils, pen holders and erasers. In 1897, the London branch confirmed the policy of selling manufactured goods with high quality. Over the years, the company changed focus and goods. In 1952, Margros Ltd was founded by Mr. P.G.Hooley, who invented Powdered Colour and sold it directly to schools. The business grew and the company was sold to Eagle Pencil Company in 1967. The company which later became Osmiroid International was started in 1824 by James Perry who joined his brother in the penmaking business. In 1989, the company was bought by Berol Ltd. The Newell Company joined forces with Berol on November 2, 1995. The merging of the two companies made Berol a branch of the Sanford Corporation.  Products  = Colored pencils = One of Prismacolor's main products is their colored pencils. They have two lines of colored pencils called Scholar and Premier. Scholar pencils are made with a hard type of wax and tend to have less pigmentation than the premier line. They are cheaper than the premier line, as they are made with beginning or developing artists in mind. There are 60 different colors total, which are available in packs of 12, 24, 48 and 60. The Premier lines are available in several different sub- classes—Softcore, Verithin, Watercolor, Col-erase, and Art Stix. line. With 150 different colors, Prismacolors's Softcore line has the most color variation of all their colored pencil lines. They have an 8mm round barrel, which matches the 5mm diameter wax core. Softcore pencils can be bought individually or in tins that separated the layers of pencils inside with plastic. The tins come in pack variants of 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 132, and 150. The wax they are made with allows them to be smoother and easier to blend. However, it also causes frequent breaks when pushing down or sharpening the pencil. Some artists microwave them to try and fix this common problem. Another common problem is called \\"wax bloom.\\" This occurs when there is more wax in colored pencils then there is pigment, or in users who are heavy handed. It causes a wax film to appear over the places the pencil is used, which makes the work look more white or \\"washed out.\\" Wax bloom can be removed by gently rubbing the affected area with a soft cloth or tissue. Afterwards, some people choose to spray a fixative onto the end product to prevent re- occurrence. This line has a pencil known as colorless blender. The blender pencil is a clear, colorless, wax pencil used overtop of the colored layer to aid in the color cohesion.  Verithin  Verithin pencils come in 36 assorted colors. They feature 0.7 mm lead, which matches their hexagonal barrel. They can be bought in cardboard packs of 12, 24, and 36. They are meant to be utilized for finer details and outlining.  Watercolor  Premier Watercolor Colored Pencils provide smooth rich lay down and are water- soluble. They are available in sets of 12, 24, and 36. = Markers = The line of markers Prismacolor produce are illustrating markers. The common method for using Prismacolor markers is to apply the colors in layers. The different tips allow for the color to be applied in various ways on the application being worked on. Artists use varying colors from the same color line to create shadows and textures on the artwork. = Pastel = Prismacolor offers several varieties of pastels. There are two qualities to pastels: Artist and Student. Artist quality pastels have a higher ratio of pigment giving more intense color. Student pastels contain more fillers and byproduct to help the stick keep shape and allow the pastel to withstand pressure and crumbling. With artist pastels, the richer pigments and lack of binder cause the product to be more fragile yet costly. Hard pastels are made the same way as a soft pastel but contain more binder and less pigment. Hard pastels are more stable in different drawing techniques and come in both artist and student quality. Pastel pencils are for fine details and control. The shape and size of a pastel pencils resemble colored pencils and are suitable for outdoors work. The makeup of oil pastels is pigment coated in wax or oil giving lines and shading a crayon like texture. Oil pastels are more stable than a soft pastel and do not require a fixative to work. Unlike the other types of pastels, oil based pastels will not smudge, crumble or give off dust when working on paper. Although oil pastels lack the ability to blend into other colors, the pigments can be spread on a canvas like oil paints and are available in both student and artist quality.

The period at which he flourished is unknown, but has been put at about 600 BC. The story is that his daughter, Kora of Sicyon, smitten with love for a youth at Corinth where they lived, drew upon the wall the outline of his shadow, and that upon this outline her father modelled a face of the youth in clay, which he baked along with the clay tiles which it was his trade to make. This model was preserved in Corinth until Lucius Mummius sacked that town. This incident led Butades to ornament the ends of roof-tiles with human faces, a practice which is attested by numerous existing examples. He is also said to have invented a mixture of clay and ruddle (red ochre), or to have introduced the use of a special kind of red clay.Pliny the Elder, Natural History, xxxv.151.

History  A permanent settlement has existed at the site of modern Moyers since at least the 1880s. During the 1880s the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway, more popularly known as the “Frisco”, built a line from north to south through the Choctaw Nation, connecting Fort Smith, Arkansas with Paris, Texas. The railroad paralleled the Kiamichi River throughout much of its route in present-day Pushmataha County, Oklahoma. Train stations were established every few miles to aid in opening up the land and, more particularly, to serve as the locations of section houses. Supervisors for their respective miles of track lived in the section houses to administer the track and its right-of-way. These stations also served as points at which the trains could draw water. The site of the future Moyers was selected because of its proximity to the Kiamichi River, with its abundant water supply. Adjacent station stops were established at Kosoma, Oklahoma, to the north, and Davenport—now Kellond, Oklahoma—to the south. The sparsely- populated area, at that time known as Jack’s Fork County, a part of the Pushmataha District of the Choctaw Nation,Morris, John W. Historical Atlas of Oklahoma (Norman: University of Oklahoma, 1986), plate 38. in the Indian Territory, was home to Choctaw Indians who farmed or subsisted on the land. Few roads or trails existed. But with the railroad came white settlers, seeking commercial opportunities. Kosoma became an immediate boomtown, home to a thriving timber industry. Sawmills were established in the mountains surrounding the town and the mills used Kosoma’s railroad depot as a transshipment point. Moyers remained tiny and insubstantial until Kosoma’s decline in the early 1900s (decade), when its local forests had all been logged. In addition to timber, other natural resources, including mining, were important in the regional economy. An asphalt mine was established at Jumbo, northwest of Moyers, and a tram, or railroad, was built from Moyers northwest through the Kiamichi Mountains to Jumbo. Railroad cars were loaded with asphalt at the mine and was brought via the tram to Moyers’ depot. Although the rails have long since been taken up, the tram’s elevated track bed—a significant man-made structure—is still clearly evident from a quarter-mile west of the Moyers school along its route around Parker Mountain. The first known mention of Moyers occurred in 1904, when an Antlers newspaper referred to the settlement as “Moyer’s Spur”. The term may have referred to the tram, which was a rail spur off the Frisco Railroad, and “Moyer” was a reference to Roy Abraham Moyer, a local settler.(Antlers News, November 11, 1904.) It was not until 1910 that Moyer’s Spur became known as “Moyers”, the name it continues by today.(Antlers News, April 8, 1910) It received its United States Post Office on June 7, 1895.(John Shirk, Place Names of Oklahoma) In addition to logging and the railroad, Moyers became home to additional industry in 1907 when the Gulf Pipe Line Company—which was constructing a natural gas pipeline northward from the Texas gulf coast—built a pumping station southwest of the settlement, near Ten Mile Creek in the Rocky Point area. The pumping station was an important facility for the pipe line, and kept it operational for many miles north and south in either direction. A sizeable crew was stationed there, and was popular among local townspeople in Moyers and Antlers.(Antlers News, June 2, 1907.) Lumber would prove as beneficial to Moyers as it did earlier to Kosoma. The Walker-Hopkins Lumber Company established a presence there which proved so profitable that, by 1911, it built a sizable new store and office. From those humble origins it grew so that in succeeding decades Moyers came to resemble a “company town” – Walker-Hopkins owned many of the stores, homes, and much of the property in the town. It operated large lumber yards and a sawmill which came to employ many local men and lend Moyers what it has not had since: an industrial skyline complete with chimneys, towering machinery and conveyors. It remained in operation through the 1950s, after which its closure sent Moyers into a steep decline.(Antlers News-Record, January 5, 1912) Transportation was provided by the Frisco Railroad, which offered six trains per day—three in each direction—until it closed to passenger traffic during the late 1950s. It continued freight operations until 1981, when it closed altogether and its rails were removed. The loss of passenger rail coincided with the construction of Oklahoma State Highway 2. It offered a paved, graded route all the way from Antlers to north of Moyers, at the turn-off to Baugh’s Prairie and Big Mountain. It was completed in the 1980s. Until this time overland transportation was problematic at best—particularly the portion of road at Rodney Mountain (itself named after Rodney Moyer), between Moyers and Kellond. The road, where it passed the foot of Rodney Mountain near Ten Mile Creek, “…is so rough that a farmer going to town with a can of cream, found that the cream had been churned, and he had butter,” according to one observer in 1926. Local conditions stayed pretty much the same until the opening of the state highway thirty years later.(Kiamichi Valley Reporter, February 5, 1926) During World War II the Moyers area was the site of two lethal air crashes. British pilots operating from a Royal Air Force base in Texas crashed into White Rock Mountain and Big Mountain, killing four crew men. Two planes were destroyed. A third plane crash-landed successfully at Jumbo. On February 20, 2000 the AT6 Monument was dedicated in the fliers' honor at the crash site on Big Mountain. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony, and the story was carried by the British Broadcasting Corporation and many newspapers around the world. Moyers, at this writing, has a post office, one general store and one church, and a number of homes, both in the immediate vicinity and adjacent areas. It has regained its public junior high and high school –lost during the 1960s—and now educates local children from kindergarten through 12th grade. The schools athletic teams are known as the Moyers Tigers, and Lady Tigers, kyle McBride, Nick McKnight, Kolbe Childress. Over 100 years after lending the settlement its name, the Moyer family continues to live nearby. Ms. Jimi Moyer Cocke lives on a ranch just south of Rodney Mountain.  Geology  Moyers is located in a very picturesque area with varied topography. To its south is Rodney Mountain. To its immediate north is Parker Mountain, with the taller Whiterock Mountain rising behind it. East of Moyers is the Kiamichi River, and west is a relatively flat expanse connecting it to the Impson Valley. Buck Creek, a well-watered and dependable spring-fed stream rising in the mountains north of Whiterock Mountain, flows through a sharply-defined valley north of Moyers to its confluence with the Kiamichi. Ten Mile Creek—also spring-fed but more seasonally-dependent—flows east and south of Moyers. Two significant manmade structures are nearby, and due to their size and permanence have become a part of local topography: the elevated beds of the rail spur winding around the base of Parker Mountain, and the Frisco Railroad.

They appear to have had two capitals, a northern one at the ruin known as Olon Süme and another a bit to the south at a place called Koshang or Dongsheng. They acted as wardens of the marches for the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) to the north of Shanxi. History and Origin The ancestors of the Ongud were the Shatuo Turks,Song Lian et al., History of Yuan, [12 \\"Vol. 118\\"] \\"阿剌兀思剔吉忽里，汪古部人，係出沙陀雁門之後。\\" Alawusi Tijihuli, a man of the Ongud tribe, was the descendant of the Wild Goose Pass's ShatuoPaulillo, Mauricio. \\"White Tatars: The Problem of the Öngũt conversion to Jingjiao and the Uighur Connection\\" in From the Oxus River to the Chinese Shores: Studies on East Syriac Christianity in China and Central Asia (orientalia - patristica - oecumenica) Ed.

In the seventh century they moved to east of modern Dzungaria, then under the protection of the Tang China. By the ninth century, the Shatuo were scattered over North China and modern Inner Mongolia. A Shatuo warlord, Li Keyong, mobilized 10,000 Shatuo cavalrymen and served Tang China as an ally. In 923, his son Li Cunxu defeated the Later Liang dynasty and became emperor of the Later Tang.C. P.

In the 13th century, a part of Shatuo probably included in the Mongol Empire as an Ongud tribe, another part as White Tatars.Wang Kuo-wei, \\"Wang Kuo-wei researches\\", Taipei, 1968: 4985Ozkan Izgi, \\"The ancient cultures of Central Asia and the relations with the Chinese civilization\\"//The Turks, Ankara, 2002, p. 99 The Ongud chief Ala Kush Tegin revealed the Naimans plan to attack Genghis Khan in 1205 and allied with the Mongols. When Genghis Khan invaded the Jin Dynasty in 1211, Ala Kush Tegin supported him. Genghis married his daughter Alakhai Bekhi to one of Ala Kush's sons. However, political opponents killed Ala Kush Tegin. Genghis put down the rebellion and took the family under his protection, with his daughter the de facto ruler. Alakhai Bekhi ruled the Ongud as regent for several underage princes until the reign of Güyük Khan (1246–48). Many famous post-Genghis Mongols are of Ongud descent, including the well-known traveler, diplomat, and monk of the Church of the East, Rabban Bar Sauma (1220–1294). The Ongud proved good allies to Kublai.John Man Kublai khan, p.319 For example, the Ongud ruler Korgiz (George) married Kublai's two granddaughters and fought against Kaidu, whose protégé Duwa captured and killed him later in 1298. A number of Öngüd were said to have been converted to Catholicism by John of Montecorvino (1246–1328). After 1221 many Onguds were resettled in Khwarezm, where they served as governors for the Golden Horde. They formed part of the Argyns and the Mughal tribe. The Onguds in Mongolia became an otog of the Tumed in the 15th century. The Onguds gradually vanish from records and likely assimilated into other Turkic and Mongol tribes beginning in the post-Yuan period. The Mongols of Inner Mongolia, Mongolia and western China eventually converted to Tibetan Buddhism from the 16th century onwards. Art and architecture The University of Hong Kong possesses a collection of around a thousand 13th- and 14th-century bronze Nestorian crosses from the Ongud region collected during the 1920s by F. A. Nixon, a British postal official working in northern China.

CPO guns have also become more popular in recent years. The term Certified Pre-Owned was conceived by corporations in order to find a more favorable alternative to marketing products as 'Used' which causes consumers to impose their cognitive biases associated with 'Used' items onto prospective purchases. There is no distinction or standard as to what is the difference between a Used item and a CPO one, except that it is implied the CPO has been inspected and confirmed as working. Inspection, refurbishing, certification of functioning and other methods are sometimes employed by companies, but there is no standard for what distinguishes that which is CPO from something that is used. CPOs may be late- models, differing from other used cars by having been inspected, refurbished, and certified by a manufacturer or other certifying authority. They also typically include an extended warranty, special financing, and additional benefits. Luxury marques Lexus and Mercedes-Benz were among the first to create CPO programs in the 1990s. There are variations as to what is termed certified pre-owned, so the distinctions are important. Manufacturer (or \\"factory\\") CPO vehicles are only sold at authorized dealers specializing in that particular franchise. Factory CPO cars are generally five years old or newer and have less than 80,000 miles. They often cost more than vehicles certified by independent authorities, and are higher priced than a non- certified used vehicle. Independent programs can represent good value and an alternative to an OEM program. Independents may hold a vehicle to a higher standard than an OEM, or may be less stringent in their inspections. Independents include brands such as the National Vehicle Certification Program (or \\"NVCP\\"), Carmark, and others. Dealer-certified programs represent a third category, as they are often promoted as Certified Pre-Owned. These vehicles generally have not been inspected by anyone outside the dealership, but do typically carry a warranty or extended service contract to provide some protection to the consumer. With any certified pre-owned program, who does the actual inspection and reconditioning repairs may be significant. Both OEM and dealer-certified program vehicles are typically inspected by employees of the selling dealer—not by the manufacturer as may be assumed. Independents may employ a disinterested third-party inspector to ensure objectivity, or may allow the dealer to inspect their own vehicles. Because warranties, vehicle inspection points, and other program components will vary, prospective buyers would be wise to decide what defines CPO for themselves, by comparing the programs to determine what best represents their needs and expectations. Thursday, October 1, 2020 Used vehicle certification is the process of certifying to a warranty company that the vehicle has no issues. This has been a process car dealerships have done for almost 50 years. In the 1990s manufactures began using the term \\"certified vehicle\\" in advertising. The warranties attached to a certified car are the same extended warranties dealers have offered customers in the finance office at time of sale. Penetration percentages were low so the end buyer was taken out of the decision making process and the warranty was sold from the service department to the used car department via the \\"used car check out or certification\\".

He was an opening batsmen who played in 21 Test matches and 23 One Day Internationals. He also played 13 \\"Supertests\\" in World Series Cricket. Early career =1972–73 Season= Bruce Laird represented his home state of Western Australia in Sheffield Shield cricket, making his debut in February 1973 aged 22. He opened the batting against a strong Victorian bowling line-up including Alan Thomson and Alan Hurst. Laird was dismissed early in both innings scoring 3 and 16. Western Australia won by 3 wickets and went on to win the 1972/73 Shield. =1973–74 and 1974–75 Seasons= Laird would not force his way into the first XI in the 1973/74 season but would become the regular opener in the 1974/75 season. His first century came against New South Wales in just his fourth first-class match. He started to be talked of as a future test player. He scored 117 in a first wicket partnership of 203 with Wally Edwards. His second hundred was scored against Queensland, he scored 127 before being run out. In eight matches he scored 703 runs, joint top of the charts with the great Greg Chappell, at an average of 46.86 scoring two hundreds and four fifties. International recognition =1975 Ashes Tour= Laird's excellent season was rewarded with a place on the 1975 Ashes Tour to England and Canada. Laird scored 80 in a game in Canada. He did not play in any of the Test matches but did play in nine first-class matches against the County sides. He scored 488 runs in 9 matches at an average of 32.53, with a top score of 127. He was unlucky not to be picked for the first Test match having made 207 runs in three County matches. However the selectors backed Alan Turner who had made 156 against Kent in the first County match and Rick McCosker. The decision proved correct as the Australians thrashed England at Edgbaston by an innings and 85 runs. Despite only scoring 359 runs in the first innings, Australia bowled England out twice for 101 and 173. McCosker then cemented his place in the side with back-to-back hundreds against Sussex at Hove. The remaining tests were all drawn and Australia retained the Ashes with a 1–0 series win. =1975–76 Season= The following season with Western Australia was a disappointment for Laird. He played all eight Shield matches but scored just one hundred and averaged only 28.07. His side struggled with the bat with no player scoring more than one hundred, but with top fast bowlers Mick Malone and Dennis Lillee they managed to win four matches. =1976–77 Season= Laird was in the running for a spot in the Australian team that summer but lost out to Ian Davis. However he helped WA win the Shield. World Series Cricket Laird was signed up to Kerry Packer's World Series Cricket in 1977. He was a regular in the Australian team, playing in 13 Supertests. =1977–78 Season= In four 1977/78 Supertests Laird scored two hundreds, the first in the 3rd Supertest against the West Indies at Football Park, Adelaide. His score of 106 helped the Aussies to a 220 run win. He scored 106 again in the first innings of the first Supertest against the World XI at RAS Showground, Sydney, although he made just six in the second innings as the Australians lost by 4 wickets. =1978–79 Season= The second season of World Series Cricket was not as successful for Laird. He did not score a century, although he did play in all four of Australia's Supertests. He did enough to be selected for the lucrative WSC Tour of the West Indies. There he played in all five Supertests, scoring one century, 122, in Australia's win at Queen's Park Oval, Trinidad and Tobago. The series was drawn 1–1. Return to Official Cricket =1979–80 Season= After Packer reached a deal with the cricket authorities the Australian WSC players returned to their State sides and were once again available for international selection. Having played well during WSC Laird was selected immediately for the Australian XI to face the West Indies in 1979 at Brisbane, for his Test debut. He scored 92 and 72 in the drawn match. Laird scored 69 in the second innings of the second test however the Australians were thrashed by ten wickets. Another fifty followed in the third and final test however the West Indians won convincingly again by 408 runs. This test season was run in the same format as Packer's Supertests with matches played between three sides, England also featuring. In the two tests Laird played against England his top score was 74 in the third test. Australia beat England in all three matches. Alongside the test series against the West Indies, the first World Series Cup was played. The tournament was the spin-off from WSC and followed the same triangular format, England again being the third team. Laird played his first ODI against the West Indies on 27 November 1979 scoring 20 from 38 balls as Australia won by 5 wickets. That would be his top score in the tournament as Australia did not qualify for the final. =1980 Tour of Pakistan= This was a busy time for the Australian international cricketers as a tour to Pakistan followed in February 1980 just days after the conclusion of the third test against England. Greg Chappell led the side and Laird partnered Graham Yallop at the top of the order in the first test in Karachi. The Pakistan side featured seven former WSC players and defeated the Australians by 7 wickets. It was in Karachi that Laird passed 500 test runs. Having gone 1–0 up the second test was played on a typically dead Pakistani wicket designed for a draw. Australia scored 617 from 211 overs, but Laird missed out bagging a duck fourth ball. The third test at Lahore also ended in a bat dominated draw with Julien Wiener opening with Laird for the second match scoring 93. =1980 Tour of England= After the tour to Pakistan, the Australians went to England to play the second Centenary Test match at Lord's. Laird scored 24 and 6 in a drawn match. =1980–81 Season= The long period of international cricket was broken and Laird was afforded the opportunity to return to regular Shield cricket. He played 6 matches in the 1980/81 season opening with the young star Graeme Wood, his opening partner in the Centenary Test. Wood had the better season scoring 542 runs to Laird's 209. Despite Western Australia winning the Shield that year, this poor form saw Laird dropped from the Test side and replaced by his teammate. Wood was then selected for 25 consecutive Test matches and would continue to feature in the side until 1992, scoring nine hundreds in his test career. Laird missed three test series against New Zealand, India and the famous Ashes series in England in 1981. Ian Chappell had picked him in Chappell's hypothetical squad saying Laird was \\"a must for the team. He is a proven run getter in international cricket and a great fighter.\\" =1981–82 Season= Laird earned a recall to the test side for the home series against Pakistan, thanks to a bright start to the 1981/82 Shield season. A score of 110 not out and the continuing success of his partnership with Wood, convincing returning captain Greg Chappell to call on him again. Laird was picked for the next twelve tests to partner Wood at the top of the batting order. They started well against Pakistan averaging 65 runs for the first wicket in the three test series, with a best of 109. In the opening test of the summer held at the WACA Ground, Laird was one of seven Western Australians selected in the Australian Test team, alongside Wood, Kim Hughes, Rod Marsh, Bruce Yardley, Dennis Lillee and Terry Alderman.Australia vs Pakistan, November 1981, WACA Ground It was in the 1981/82 World Series (ODI) Cup that Laird would score his only international century, 117 not out against the West Indies. Back in the Test arena, Laird and Wood averaged 43.1 as a partnership, with two century partnerships and six of fifty or more. However Australia were not performing well and the selectors wanted changes. =1982 Tour of Pakistan= Laird was the third selector on the tour of Pakistan. It happened that Laird was dropped after a 3–0 whitewash defeat against Pakistan in 1982 and never regained his place. He ended his 21 Test career having never scored an official Test century, with the three he scored in the Supertests never being officially recognised.

In 1982/83 he scored 610 runs (ave. 40.66) and Western Australia won the Shield in the final against New South Wales. Western Australia completed the double winning the MacDonalds Cup against New South Wales by four wickets. =1983–84 Season= In 1983/84, he spent most of the season batting at five. Laird smashed 684 runs at 48.85 and captained Western Australia for the first time in Shield cricket against South Australia at Perth. Bruce Laird bowed out of professional cricket by winning another Shield title defeating Queensland in the 1983/84 final, finishing with scores 63 and 54 as Western Australia won by four wickets.

In humans, taurocholic acid and glycocholic acid (derivatives of cholic acid) and taurochenodeoxycholic acid and glycochenodeoxycholic acid (derivatives of chenodeoxycholic acid) are the major bile salts.

The salts of their 7-alpha-dehydroxylated derivatives, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, are also found, with derivatives of cholic, chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic acids accounting for over 90% of human biliary bile acids. Bile acids comprise about 80% of the organic compounds in bile (others are phospholipids and cholesterol). An increased secretion of bile acids produces an increase in bile flow. Bile acids facilitate digestion of dietary fats and oils. They serve as micelle-forming surfactants, which encapsulate nutrients, facilitating their absorption. These micelles are suspended in the chyme before further processing. Bile acids also have hormonal actions throughout the body, particularly through the farnesoid X receptor and GPBAR1 (also known as TGR5). Structure of cholic acid showing relationship to other bile acids Production Bile acid synthesis occurs in liver cells, which synthesize primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid in humans) via cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of cholesterol in a multi-step process. Approximately 600 mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the feces, although, as described below, much larger amounts are secreted, reabsorbed in the gut and recycled. The rate-limiting step in synthesis is the addition of a hydroxyl group of the 7th position of the steroid nucleus by the enzyme cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. This enzyme is down-regulated by cholic acid, up-regulated by cholesterol and is inhibited by the actions of the ileal hormone FGF15/19. Prior to secreting any of the bile acids (primary or secondary, see below), liver cells conjugate them with either glycine or taurine, to form a total of 8 possible conjugated bile acids. These conjugated bile acids are often referred to as bile salts. The pKa of the unconjugated bile acids are between 5 and 6.5, and the pH of the duodenum ranges between 3 and 5, so when unconjugated bile acids are in the duodenum, they are almost always protonated (HA form), which makes them relatively insoluble in water. Conjugating bile acids with amino acids lowers the pKa of the bile-acid/amino-acid conjugate to between 1 and 4. Thus conjugated bile acids are almost always in their deprotonated (A-) form in the duodenum, which makes them much more water-soluble and much more able to fulfil their physiologic function of emulsifying fats.'Essentials of Medical Biochemistry, Lieberman, Marks and Smith, eds, p432, 2007' Once secreted into the lumen of the intestine, bile salts are modified by gut bacteria. They are partial dehydroxylated. Their glycine and taurine groups are removed to give the secondary bile acids, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. Cholic acid is converted into deoxycholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid into lithocholic acid. All four of these bile acids recycled, in a process known as enterohepatic circulation. Functions As amphipathic molecules with hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions, conjugated bile salts sit at the lipid/water interface and, at the right concentration, form micelles. The added solubility of conjugated bile salts aids in their function by preventing passive re-absorption in the small intestine. As a result, the concentration of bile acids/salts in the small intestine is high enough to form micelles and solubilize lipids. \\"Critical micellar concentration\\" refers to both an intrinsic property of the bile acid itself and amount of bile acid necessary to function in the spontaneous and dynamic formation of micelles. Bile acid- containing micelles aid lipases to digest lipids and bring them near the intestinal brush border membrane, which results in fat absorption. Synthesis of bile acids is a major route of cholesterol metabolism in most species other than humans. The body produces about 800 mg of cholesterol per day and about half of that is used for bile acid synthesis producing 400–600 mg daily. Human adults secrete between 12-18 g of bile acids into the intestine each day, mostly after meals. The bile acid pool size is between 4–6 g, which means that bile acids are recycled several times each day. About 95% of bile acids are reabsorbed by active transport in the ileum and recycled back to the liver for further secretion into the biliary system and gallbladder. This enterohepatic circulation of bile acids allows a low rate of synthesis, only about 0.3g/day, but with large amounts being secreted into the intestine. Bile acids have other functions, including eliminating cholesterol from the body, driving the flow of bile to eliminate certain catabolites (including bilirubin), emulsifying fat-soluble vitamins to enable their absorption, and aiding in motility and the reduction of the bacteria flora found in the small intestine and biliary tract. Bile acids have metabolic actions in the body resembling those of hormones, acting through two specific receptors, the farnesoid X receptor and G protein-coupled bile acid receptor/TGR5. They bind less specifically to some other receptors and have been reported to regulate the activity of certain enzymes and ion channels and the synthesis of diverse substances including endogenous fatty acid ethanolamides.

The four rings are labeled A, B, C, and D, from the farthest to the closest to the side chain with the carboxyl group. The D-ring is smaller by one carbon than the other three. The structure is commonly drawn with A at the left and D at the right. The hydroxyl groups can be in either of two configurations: either up (or out), termed beta (β; often drawn by convention as a solid line), or down, termed alpha (α; displayed as a dashed line). All bile acids have a 3-hydroxyl group, derived from the parent molecule, cholesterol, in which the 3-hydroxyl is beta. IUPAC recommended ring lettering (left) and atom numbering (right) of the steroid skeleton. The four rings A-D form a sterane core. The initial step in the classical pathway of hepatic synthesis of bile acids is the enzymatic addition of a 7α hydroxyl group by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) forming 7α-hydroxycholesterol. This is then metabolised to 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one. There are multiple steps in bile acid synthesis requiring 14 enzymes in all. These result in the junction between the first two steroid rings (A and B) being altered, making the molecule bent; in this process, the 3-hydroxyl is converted to the α orientation. The simplest 24-carbon bile acid has two hydroxyl groups at positions 3α and 7α. This is 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, or, as more usually known, chenodeoxycholic acid. This bile acid was first isolated from the domestic goose, from which the \\"cheno\\" portion of the name was derived. The 5β in the name denotes the orientation of the junction between rings A and B of the steroid nucleus (in this case, they are bent). The term \\"cholan\\" denotes a particular steroid structure of 24 carbons, and the \\"24-oic acid\\" indicates that the carboxylic acid is found at position 24, at the end of the side- chain. Chenodeoxycholic acid is made by many species, and is the prototypic functional bile acid. An alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis is initiated by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), expressed in liver, and also in macrophages and other tissues. CYP27A1 contributes significantly to total bile acid synthesis by catalyzing sterol side chain oxidation, after which cleavage of a three-carbon unit in the peroxisomes leads to formation of a C24 bile acid. Minor pathways initiated by 25-hydroxylase in the liver and 24-hydroxylase in the brain also may contribute to bile acid synthesis. 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) generates oxysterols, which may be further converted in the liver to CDCA. Cholic acid, 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, the most abundant bile acid in humans and many other species, was discovered before chenodeoxycholic acid. It is a tri-hydroxy-bile acid with 3 hydroxyl groups (3α, 7α and 12α). In its synthesis in the liver, 12α hydroxylation is performed by the additional action of CYP8B1. As this had already been described, the discovery of chenodeoxcholic acid (with 2 hydroxyl groups) made this new bile acid a \\"deoxycholic acid\\" in that it had one fewer hydroxyl group than cholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is formed from cholic acid by 7-dehydroxylation, resulting in 2 hydroxyl groups (3α and 12α). This process with chenodeoxycholic acid results in a bile acid with only a 3α hydroxyl group, termed lithocholic acid (litho = stone) having been identified first in a gallstone from a calf. It is poorly water-soluble and rather toxic to cells. Different vertebrate families have evolved to use modifications of most positions on the steroid nucleus and side-chain of the bile acid structure. To avoid the problems associated with the production of lithocholic acid, most species add a third hydroxyl group to chenodeoxycholic acid. The subsequent removal of the 7α hydroxyl group by intestinal bacteria will then result in a less toxic but still-functional dihydroxy bile acid. Over the course of vertebrate evolution, a number of positions have been chosen for placement of the third hydroxyl group. Initially, the 16α position was favored, in particular in birds. Later, this position was superseded in a large number of species selecting the 12α position. Primates (including humans) utilize 12α for their third hydroxyl group position, producing cholic acid. In mice and other rodents, 6β hydroxylation forms muricholic acids (α or β depending on the 7 hydroxyl position). Pigs have 6α hydroxylation in hyocholic acid (3α,6α,7α-trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid), and other species have a hydroxyl group on position 23 of the side-chain. Ursodeoxycholic acid was first isolated from bear bile, which has been used medicinally for centuries. Its structure resembles chenodeoxycholic acid but with the 7-hydroxyl group in the β position. Obeticholic acid, 6α-ethyl-chenodeoxycholic acid, is a semi- synthetic bile acid with greater activity as FXR agonist which is undergoing investigation as a pharmaceutical agent. Hormonal actions Bile acids also act as steroid hormones, secreted from the liver, absorbed from the intestine and having various direct metabolic actions in the body through the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X receptor (FXR), also known by its gene name . Another bile acid receptor is the cell membrane receptor known as G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 or TGR5. Many of their functions as signaling molecules in the liver and the intestines are by activating FXR, whereas TGR5 may be involved in metabolic, endocrine and neurological functions. =Regulation of synthesis= As surfactants or detergents, bile acids are potentially toxic to cells, and so their concentrations are tightly regulated. Activation of FXR in the liver inhibits synthesis of bile acids, and is one mechanism of feedback control when bile acid levels are too high. Secondly, FXR activation by bile acids during absorption in the intestine increases transcription and synthesis of FGF19, which then inhibits bile acid synthesis in the liver. =Metabolic functions= Emerging evidence associates FXR activation with alterations in triglyceride metabolism, glucose metabolism, and liver growth. =Other interactions= Bile acids bind to some other proteins in addition to their hormone receptors (FXR and TGR5) and their transporters. Among these protein targets, the enzyme N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) generates bioactive lipid amides (e.g. the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide) that play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain responses, appetite, and lifespan. NAPE-PLD orchestrates a direct cross-talk between lipid amide signals and bile acid physiology. Clinical significance =Hyperlipidemia= As bile acids are made from endogenous cholesterol, disruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids will lower cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants bind bile acids in the gut, preventing reabsorption. In so doing, more endogenous cholesterol is shunted into the production of bile acids, thereby lowering cholesterol levels. The sequestered bile acids are then excreted in the feces. =Cholestasis= Tests for bile acids are useful in both human and veterinary medicine, as they aid in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including types of cholestasis such as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, portosystemic shunt, and hepatic microvascular dysplasia in dogs. Structural or functional abnormalities of the biliary system result in an increase in bilirubin (jaundice) and in bile acids in the blood. Bile acids are related to the itching (pruritus) which is common in cholestatic conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis or intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid has been used for many years in these cholestatic disorders. =Gallstones= The relationship of bile acids to cholesterol saturation in bile and cholesterol precipitation to produce gallstones has been studied extensively. Gallstones may result from increased saturation of cholesterol or bilirubin, or from bile stasis. Lower concentrations of bile acids or phospholipids in bile reduce cholesterol solubility and lead to microcrystal formation. Oral therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid and/or ursodeoxycholic acid has been used to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. Stones may recur when treatment is stopped. Bile acid therapy may be of value to prevent stones in certain circumstances such as following bariatric surgery. =Bile acid diarrhea= Excess concentrations of bile acids in the colon are a cause of chronic diarrhea. It is commonly found when the ileum is abnormal or has been surgically removed, as in Crohn's disease, or cause a condition that resembles diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D). This condition of bile acid diarrhea/bile acid malabsorption can be diagnosed by the SeHCAT test and treated with bile acid sequestrants. =Bile acids and colon cancer= Bile acids may have some importance in the development of colorectal cancer. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) is increased in the colonic contents of humans in response to a high fat diet. In populations with a high incidence of colorectal cancer, fecal concentrations of bile acids are higher, and this association suggests that increased colonic exposure to bile acids could play a role in the development of cancer. In one particular comparison, the fecal DCA concentrations in Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet) compared to African Americans (who eat a higher fat diet) was 7.30 vs. 37.51 nmol/g wet weight stool. Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1:100,000, compared to the high incidence rate for male African Americans of 72:100,000.American Cancer Society. Cancer Facts and Figures 2009. http://www.cancer.org/Research/CancerFactsFigures/cancer-facts-figures-2009 Experimental studies also suggest mechanisms for bile acids in colon cancer. Exposure of colonic cells to high DCA concentrations increase formation of reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative stress, and also increase DNA damage. Mice fed a diet with added DCA mimicking colonic DCA levels in humans on a high fat diet developed colonic neoplasia, including adenomas and adenocarcinomas (cancers), unlike mice fed a control diet producing one-tenth the level of colonic DCA who had no colonic neoplasia. The effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in modifying the risk of colorectal cancer has been looked at in several studies, particularly in primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease, with varying results partly related to dosage. Genetic variation in the key bile acid synthesis enzyme, CYP7A1, influenced the effectiveness of UDCA in colorectal adenoma prevention in a large trial. = Dermatology = Bile acids may be used in subcutaneous injections to remove unwanted fat (see Mesotherapy). Deoxycholic acid as an injectable has received FDA approval to dissolve submental fat. Phase III trials showed significant responses although many subjects had mild adverse reactions of bruising, swelling, pain, numbness, erythema, and firmness around the treated area.

Over his 35-year career, Green has been honored as a four-time Grammy Award nominee, seven-time Dove Award winner and was inducted in to the Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2017. He has had 13 No. 1 songs, and has sold over three million albums. Early life Green was born in Portland, Oregon to parents Charles and Jo Green. His parents were Baptist missionaries. He is one of six siblings who spent much of his early life in Argentina, though like two of his siblings, he attended Phoenix Christian High School in the early 1970s when his family was in the U.S. and graduated from there in 1974. At age 18, he enrolled at Grand Canyon University. He intended to major in pre-law, but a professor recognized his musical talent and encouraged him to develop it. Career After two years at the university, Green left to travel the world with the group Truth. After his two-year stint with Truth (1976–78). Green married Marijean McCarty, a former member of Truth, and they moved to Alexandria, Indiana to sing backup for the Bill Gaither Trio. In 1980, Green joined Gary McSpadden, Lee Young and Bill Gaither to form the Gaither Vocal Band. Green sang tenor for their first two albums, The New Gaither Vocal Band and Passin' the Faith Along. In 1982, Steve and Gaither's musicians formed the Christian rock band White Heart. Green sang lead for White Heart as they recorded their debut self-titled album (which sold nearly 70,000 copies). In 1983, Steve left White Heart due to not feeling that his place was in a rock band. That same year, a confrontation with his brother, Randy, led to a spiritual renewal in Green's life. He signed a solo contract with Sparrow Records, and his self-titled debut album appeared in 1984. In the same year, he established Steve Green Ministries. In the early part of his solo career, he was known for crescendo-building, high-note endings. His break out year came in 1985 with the release of He Holds the Keys, which earned Green the Dove Award for Male Vocalist of the Year in the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) category. The following year, 1986, saw the release of two recordings, For God And God Alone and a worship/hymns album entitled A Mighty Fortress. In early 1988, he released an album dedicated to his parents called Find Us Faithful. As the 1980s came to an end, many of Green's songs became recognized standards including \\"People Need the Lord\\" and \\"Broken and Spilled Out\\". He was often considered the male version of Sandi Patty, using many of the same songwriters and styles as well as the traditional ending the song on a (literal) high note. Green also contributed background vocals to Patty's 1986 hit, \\"Let There Be Praise.\\" Green was involved with the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association from the mid-1980s onward. Green was one of the first artists to be involved with Promise Keepers, performing at their inaugural event at Folsom Field in Boulder, Colorado in July 1993 before 50,000 men. His song \\"Answer the Call\\" was inspired by the event and another song, \\"O Men of God Arise,\\" embodies the Promise Keepers' message. Green recorded The Mission in 1989 and continued his success with We Believe in 1991. As the early 1990s direction of Christian music changed to a more rock oriented format, Green returned to traditional roots by releasing an album of hymns in 1992. Yet Green switched styles toward a more \\"pop\\" flavor on his 1994 \\"Where Mercy Begins\\" album. He also received the first of two career boosts due to outside events. On September 8, 1994, USAir Flight 427 crashed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing all 132 persons on board. One passenger was an up-and-coming Christian singer named Kirk Lynn, who had just re-recorded Green's \\"As We Sail To Heaven's Shore\\" from the 1988 Find Us Faithful album. Only a rough cut played at the memorial service for the passengers. Grieving family members were told of Green's original, which boosted album sales for the older recording. Green's style change continued on his 1996 recording, The Letter. He was also instrumental in attempting to set up an accountability group for fellow Christian artists and friends. Green changed focus again in 1998 by declaring he would only record songs that honor the Lord - songs that he could be satisfied with should it be his last recording. That coincided with a controversial ruling by the Gospel Music Association known as the \\"Definition of Gospel Music\\" that erupted with major disqualifications at the ensuing year's Dove Awards over songs that did not honor the Lord. That year saw the release of The Faithful and 2000 saw the release of a devotional song album entitled Morning Light. Two years later Green released Woven in Time and again found himself receiving a career boost. Green was a personal friend of Space Shuttle Columbia commander Rick Husband, who was killed along with six others in the February 2003 disintegration during reentry. Green was interviewed by CNN and his song \\"God of Wonders\\" got a boost from the unexpected publicity. In 2005 Green released a new album, Somewhere Between. This album saw Steve move in a different direction, leaning more toward an art song style. This album featured less declarative answers of Green's past work, and instead explores the questions of pain, doubt and loss that life inevitably rains down on both the just and the unjust. Green co- wrote half of the songs on this album. In 2007 Green released his last non- compilation album under the Sparrow label, Always: Songs of Worship. In 2010, Green released Love Will Find a Way, his first release through Steve Green Ministries. This album featured David Phelps on the track \\"God is Love.\\" In 2012, Green released two albums, Rest in the Wonder and Christmas. Green stated \\"Rest in the Wonder is a declaration of absolute trust in God, fiercely holding to what we know for certain and reverently worshiping the One whose ways are higher than our ways and whose thoughts are higher than our thoughts.\\" 2014 saw the release of two more albums from Green: Hide the Word: Bible Songs for Kids and Hymns. \\"There is nothing more powerful or lasting than God's Word!\\" says Green. \\"In the Scriptures, God has told us all we need to know for life and Godliness. These Bible Promises set to music remind us who God is and what He has done for us. What's more, the songs are just plain fun!\\" Regarding his Hymns project, Green says \\"In every age, the church has lifted her voice to express praise and adoration, but the church has also used singing to refute dangerous heresy and remind one another of the foundational Biblical truths. In the 12th century, Bernard of Clairvaux penned 'O Sacred Head Now Wounded' and today we still sing his haunting hymn about Jesus' sacrificial death. Five hundred years later, 'Fairest Lord Jesus' appeared anonymously in a hymnbook, published in what is today the country of Poland. How many of us have sung that hymn, marveling at the uniqueness and glory of Christ? I hope this collection of hymns draws you into the historic stream of worship as you join your voice to songs the church has been singing through the ages.\\" Green's sister is married to Dr. Mark Bailey, president of the evangelical Dallas Theological Seminary, and he helped the seminary celebrate its eightieth anniversary in April 2004. He has also written a thirty-day devotional titled, \\"The Power of the Cross\\" and has recorded numerous children's videos and songs. His bilingual abilities have seen the release of seven Spanish CDs in the United States. He is married to Marijean Green, whose own vocal qualities complemented her husband's on the song \\"Household of Faith\\" on the For God And God Alone album and subsequent appearances.One such appearance of Green and wife Marijean's duet can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZTWCpZX6Gk The song has become a staple among Christian wedding duets. They have two children, Summer (born 1981) and Josiah (born 1985). Green has expanded his musical ministry to include videos and James Dobson's Focus on the Family.

Malone played one Test prior to joining World Series Cricket. In English county cricket he had a period with Lancashire. He was also an Australian rules football full-forward and played in 104 WANFL games for Subiaco. First-class career =1974–75: Debut for Western Australia= Malone made his first-class debut for Western Australia on 21 February 1975, against Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. He took five wickets in the match, getting Bob Baldry twice. In his second appearance, against New South Wales he took seven wickets in the match, including that of Test star batsman and Blues captain Doug Walters. Western Australia won the Sheffield Shield that year, Malone playing in the vital final two matches of the season. =1975–76= In his second season of Shield cricket (1975–76) Malone took 28 wickets at an average of just 18.75, including two five-wicket hauls. Only Australian test players Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Ashley Mallett and Alan Hurst took more wickets, although Malone's average was superior to them all. He won man of the match in a Gillette Cup game where he took 2-37 and scored 33 in an 88-run partnership with John Inverarity that helped WA in the game. =1976–77= The 1976–77 Sheffield Shield season was Malone's most productive. He finished as the competition's leading wicket taker with an amazing 40 wickets in just eight matches at an average of just 16.12, with four five-wicket innings. West Australia won the Shield and the Gillette Cup that season. Malone was voted the second-best Shield player of the season. In a Shield game against Victoria, Malone took part in a 41-run partnership with Dennis Lillee that helped WA to a narrow in. He won another man of a match game for the Gilette Cup final, when his innings of 47 not out (batting at nine), including a 51-run partnership with Craig Serjeant, took WA to a victory with five balls to go. \\"It was a superb performance\\", said captain Rod Marsh. \\"Above and beyond the call of duty.He's done that for us to win three games against Victoria, once in the Gillette Cup last year, in a recent Shield match and now\\". He later took 6-33 against Victoria in a Shield game. =1977 Ashes= After such a strong season, Malone had to be included in the Australia touring party to England in 1977. It was felt Malone would battle for the third paceman spot with Len Pascoe and Geoff Dymock, to support Jeff Thomson and Max Walker. Malone took a wicket with his first ball in England, a one day game. News broke early in the tour that most of the Australian squad had signed to play World Series Cricket including Malone. At the beginning of the tour, Malone was picked for two One-Day Internationals. England won both games easily, Malone taking two wickets in the first match and going wicketless in the second. In the Tests, the selectors preferred Pascoe as the third paceman. Pascoe bowled well but fell injured for the fifth Test, and Malone took his place. Malone's Test would be his only one. At the Kennington Oval, he had what he called his \\"golden moment\\", taking five for 63 in England's first innings with his medium-fast high action and then scoring 46 as a tailender. The match was drawn, but Australia had lost the series 3–0. The press in Australia and England blamed the hype surrounding Kerry Packer and his proposed World Series Cricket for tension within the Australian side (Malone had already signed a contract), leading to the poor performances. Malone disagrees, \\"The press said we were a divided side\\", says Malone, \\"but that was not the case. There were 13 of the 17 players who had signed for Packer and we all knew each other and got on, Packer and non-Packer players. The reason we lost was because we were outplayed by a better side and because Geoff Boycott was sensational.\\" =1977–78 and 1978–79: World Series Cricket= Malone was a peripheral figure in World Series Cricket, appearing in just one Supertest in 1979 against the West Indies at VFL Park, Melbourne. He took three wickets in the match (Clive Lloyd, Richard Austin and Viv Richards) and scored seven runs. The match was drawn. He featured more in the limited-overs matches. In the 1977–78 International Cup he took four wickets in four matches. The Country Cup tours provided Malone with more match time. In the 1977–78 Country Cup he played eight times, taking 25 wickets at an average of just 20.76. His economy rate for that tour was a very impressive 2.78 runs per over. Malone took 3 for 62 in the 75-over Country Cup Final that the Australians lost to the World XI at Manuka Oval, Canberra. He also took 5-35 in a game against the World XI in Hamilton. In the 1978–79 season, Malone played eight matches of the tour to New Zealand (against the World XI) taking 14 wickets (average 13.14), with best figures of 4 for 9 in 10 overs at Cooks Gardens, Wanganui (50-over match). Malone hoped this form would see him selected more often for the Australian XI in the lucrative Supertests and International Cup. He did play 11 matches in the International Cup taking 10 wickets. Three of those matches were in the best of four final against the West Indies. Australia lost the winner-takes-all series 3–1. Malone ended World Series Cricket on the tour to the West Indies, playing in six limited-overs matches. He took 6 wickets at an average of 27.50. The West Indies won the series 8–2. Australia lost every game that Malone played in. Malone later said some players from his club Scarborough \\"didn't support me\\" about World Series Cricket. \\"I couldn't understand that\\". But Malone said \\"I've got no regrets whatsoever in any way regarding joining World Series Cricket. Not one single regret... the security in World Series Cricket was magnificent\\". =1979: Lancashire= In 1979, Malone moved to England to play as professional with Haslingden Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. Dennis Lillee had played for Haslingden in 1971. Other pros in the league at the time included Pakistan's Mudassar Nazar (Burnley), Nasim-ul-Ghani (Lowerhouse), Anwar Khan (Rishton), Mohsin Khan (Accrington) and Aftab Baloch (Todmorden), fellow Aussie Peter Sleep (East Lancashire), Indians Madan Lal (Enfield) and Rakesh Shukla (Colne). The league had a reputation of being hard, with many famous overseas professionals having played there (including Ian Chappell). Malone took 45 wickets in the league at an average of a little over 10. Malone was signed as the second overseas player for Lancashire alongside the great Clive Lloyd, replacing South African Paul Robinson. In two matches he took a remarkable 18 wickets, including a career best 7-for-88 against Nottinghamshire at Blackpool. He dismissed star batsmen Derek Randall and Clive Rice. In his second match for Lancashire, Malone took 6 for 60 against Leicestershire, David Gower among his wickets. =1979–80: Return to establishment cricket and touring Pakistan= Benefiting from his spell in England, Malone returned to Shield cricket for Western Australia for the 1979–80 season. World Series cricket players were playing with non-World Series Cricket players. \\"I can see it being completely forgotten in a couple of months\\", said Malone. \\"I think there are some initial problems, particularly with selection, but once everyone plays against each other again in Shield competition, it'll be pretty clear who the better cricketers are.... When we are all playing together it'll be clear who should be in the side and who shouldn't be\\". He took 32 wickets in the expanded competition at a more modest average of 28.75, in what was a poor season for the side; they won just once, at home against whipping-boys Tasmania. However his form was good enough to earn a recall to the Australia party for the tour to Pakistan. He did not play in any of the three tests. Malone was picked against the BCCP President's XI and Punjab Governor's XI he struggled on the slow pitches taking just one wicket and bowling few overs, as Australia relied heavily on the spin of Ray Bright. =1980: Return to Lancashire= Malone returned to Lancashire for the entire 1980 season playing 15 county championship matches. He was sponsored $50 a wicket. He was the county's second-highest wicket-taker with 45 wickets (average 25.88), behind Willie Hogg who had 50 (average 21.16). Lancashire finished a disappointing third- bottom in the table, winning only four games. Malone did face the touring Australians in a three-day match, but did not take a wicket. =1980–81= Malone would play just two more seasons of Shield cricket for Western Australia before retiring at the end of the 1981–82, playing just twelve more matches. The 1980–81 season yielded just 14 wickets, while he took 13 in his final season—although Western Australia did win the Shield again in 1980–81. He took 2-18 off 10 overs in the McDonald's Cup semi-final. An injury meant he was unable to play for Lancashire in 1981. =1981–82: Return to Australian side= Some solid domestic form saw Malone return to the Australian side for the Benson and Hedges World Series Cup, the official spin-off from WSC, against Pakistan and the West Indies in 1981–82. He replaced an injured Terry Alderman. He had a superb comeback game taking 2-9 off ten overs. He kept his spot in subsequent games. He would play eight times taking 9 wickets at an average of 27.88, he was also Australia's most economical bowler conceding just 3.13 runs per over. Malone was picked in that season's Australian squad to play the West Indies for the third Test at Adelaide, replacing Terry Alderman, but was 12th man. He was discussed as a possibility for the 1982 tour of New Zealand. He did not tour, and announced his retirement from first- class cricket. His final game was a one-day match against Victoria, in which he took 3-19 off seven overs. Malone said \\"I felt I was struggling to get into the Shield team and I just thought it was time to retire. I have no qualms about my decision and I could not have finished off on a better note by getting a wicket on the last ball I bowled.\\" Outside cricket Malone retired at the end of the 1981–82 season, finishing with first-class career figures of 73 matches 260 wickets at an average of 24.77. In the Australian winter he was an Australian rules football full-forward and played in 104 WANFL games for Subiaco, including their 1973 Premiership. In 1978 Malone played his 100th game for Subiaco and also topped their goalkicking with 54.47. It was his last season of pro-footy. Malone now runs Mick Malone Real Estate based in Doubleview, Western Australia.

It remains part of the Christian liturgies of Eastern Christianity, but in the Latin Rite it was suppressed by the Second Vatican Council.Sacrosanctum Concilium, Article 89(d) However, clergy under obligation to celebrate the Liturgy of the Hours may still fulfil their obligation by using the edition of the Roman Breviary promulgated by Pope John XXIII in 1962,Summorum Pontificum, article 9 §3 which contains Prime. Like all the liturgical hours, except the Office of Readings, it consists mainly of Psalms. It is one of the Little Hours. Name The word \\"Prime\\" comes from Latin and refers to the first hour of daylight (that which begins at sunrise). John Cassian (c. 360 – c. 435) describes it as matutina (hora),De Coenobiorum Institutis (Institutes) in Patrologia Latina (Migne) vol. 49, col. 126A (\\"a\\" or \\"the\\") \\"morning hour\\" (translated also as \\"Mattins\\")John Cassian, The Twelve Books on the Institutes of the Coenobia and the Remedies for the Eight Principal Faults book 3, chapter 4, a description applied also, according to Alardus Gazaeus even by Cassian,Patrologia Latina (Migne) vol. 49, coll. 127C−128B] to the dawn hour of Lauds. Benedict of Nursia (c. 480 − c. 547) refers to Prime by using the term \\"primae tempore\\" (\\"the time of First Hour\\") for Prime and uses matutino tempore (\\"morning time\\") to speak of Lauds, reckoning Lauds as the first of the seven daytime offices, which he associates with Psalm 118/119:164, \\"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules\\",Psalm 119:164 and which he distinguishes from the one nocturnal office of Night Watch, which he links with Psalm 118/119:62, \\"At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules\\",Psalm 119:62Regula S.P.N. Benedicti, caput 6Rule of Saint Benedict, chapter 16 In the Antiphonary of Bangor (perhaps c. 700) what is generally called prima (hora) is called secunda.F.E. Warren (editor), The Antiphonary of Bangor (Harrison and Sons, London 1895), part II, pp. 19, 20, 29, 32 F.E. Warren states: \\"'Secunda' as the equivalent of 'Prima', the usual title of the first of the Day-Hours is a very ancient title, but has now gone out of use. It is found in the Missale Gallicanum (p. 179), also in C.C.C.C. MS.272, a ninth century Rheims Psalter\\". Warren (1895), p. 58 In the Eastern liturgies, the names for this office in the various languages mean \\"first (hour)\\".  Origin  John Cassian states that this canonical hour originated in his own time and in his own monastery in Bethlehem, where he lived as a novice: \\"hanc matitutinam canonicam functionem nostro tempore in nostro quoque monasterio primitus institutam.\\" (\\"was appointed as a canonical office in our own day, and also in our own monastery, where our Lord Jesus Christ was born of a Virgin and deigned to submit to growth in infancy as man, and where by His Grace He supported our own infancy, still tender in religion, and, as it were, fed with milk\\"). Jules Pargoire concluded that the institution of Prime must be placed towards 382.Jules Pargoire, \\"Prime et Complines\\" in La Revue d'histoire et de Littérature, III (1898), 282-88; Dict. d'Archéologie et de Liturgie, I, 198; II, 1245, 1302, 1306. Fernand Cabrol identified the monastery in question as \\"not St. Jerome's monastery at Bethlehem, but another, perhaps one established beyond the Tower of Ader (or of the Flock) beyond the village of the Shepherds, and consequently beyond the modern Beth-saour; it has been identified either with Deïr-er-Raouat (convent of the shepherds) or with Seiar-er-Ganhem (enclosure of the sheep)\\".Fernand Cabrol, \\"Prime\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York 1911) Cassian says this office was instituted because a period of rest was allowed after the nocturnal office and the office said shortly after it, but some monks abused this time of rest by staying in their cells and their beds right up to the time for Terce, and it was therefore decided to have a sunrise office that, moreover, brought the daylight offices to seven in line with Psalm 118/119:164, quoted above in connection with the Rule of Saint Benedict.  Western Church  Fernand Cabrol says that Prime originally used only a repetition of the Lauds Psalms 1, 57 (58), and 89 (90), but the monasteries that gradually adopted the new office in changed its constitution as they liked. In spite of the many variations, one characteristic feature is the recitation of the Athanasian Creed. Saint Benedict assigns to Prime on Sundays four groups of eight verses of Ps. 118 (119), and on week-days three psalms, beginning with the first and continuing to Ps. 19 (20), taking three psalms each day (Pss. 9 (10) and 17 (18) being divided into two). This makes Prime like the other Little Hours of the day, which it resembles these in accompanying the psalms with a hymn, an antiphon, capitulum, versicle, and prayer. The Roman Breviary as decreed by Pope Pius V in 1568 in line with the decrees of the Council of Trent, assigns to Prime on Sunday of Pss. 53 (54), 107 (108) and the first four groups of eight verses of Ps. 118 (119); on each of the weekdays it assigns the same psalms as on Sunday except that it replaces Psalm 107 (108) with Psalm 23 (24). Each day therefore had in Prime two full psalms and the same two portions of Psalm 118 (119). The late 1911 reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X changed the psalmody radically, dividing several psalms into shorter portions. To Prime it assigned each day three psalms or portions of psalms, each day different.Table comparing the 1568 and the 1911 psalters To these elements, which make Prime similar to the other Little Hours, Prime adds some prayers that are called the office of the chapter: the reading of the martyrology, the prayer \\"Sancta Maria et omnes sancti\\" (\\"May holy Mary and all the Saints...\\"), a prayer concerning work, \\"Respice in servos tuos . . . Dirigere et sanctificare\\" (\\"Look upon thy servants... Direct and sanctify\\"), and a blessing. The fact that monks originally after Prime betook themselves to manual work or study is reflected in the prayer for the work \\"... et opera manuum nostrarum dirige super nos et opus manuum nostrarum dirige\\" (\\"...and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct.\\"), and the prayer \\"Dirigere\\". Later the reading of the martyrology, the necrology, the rule, and a prayer for the dead were added. The Church of England's Book of Common Prayer dropped Prime. A proposed 1928 version that Parliament rejected would have restored Prime, with the instruction that it be used in addition to (not instead of) Matins, and with optional reciting of the Athanasian Creed.  Eastern Christianity  =Byzantine Rite= In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Churches the office of the First Hour is normally read by a single Reader and has very little variation in it. Three fixed psalms are read at the First Hour: Psalms 5, 89, and 100 (LXX). The only variable portions for most of the year are the Troparia (either one or two) and Kontakion of the Day. Whereas the other Little Hours are normally followed by other services, the First Hour is normally read immediately after Matins and so it is concluded with a dismissal by the priest. In the Russian usage, the dismissal is followed by a hymn to the Theotokos (the Kontakion of the Annunciation, Tone 8): > \\"To thee, the champion leader, we thy servants dedicate a feast of victory > and of thanksgiving, as ones rescued out of sufferings, O Theotokos; but as > thou art one with might which is invincible, from all dangers that can be do > thou deliver us, that we may cry to thee: Rejoice, thou Bride Unwedded!\\" Variations During Great Lent a number of changes in the office take place. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, after the three fixed psalms, the Reader says a kathisma from the Psalter. The Troparion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten hymns that are chanted with prostrations. Then the psalm verses that follow the Theotokion, which are normally read, are instead sung by the choir. The Kontakion is also replaced by special Lenten hymns which are sung. Near the end of the Hour, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said, with prostrations. On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of the Fourth Week of Great Lent, the Veneration of the Cross takes place at the First Hour. During the Fifth Week of Great Lent, there is a kathisma only on Tuesday and Wednesday, due to the reading of the Great Canon of Saint Andrew of Crete on Thursday morning. If, however, the Great Feast of the Annunciation falls on that particular Thursday, the reading of the Great Canon will be moved to Tuesday and, as a result, a kathisma will be read on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. During Holy Week, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the services are similar to those during Great Lent except there is no reading of Kathismata, and instead of the normal Lenten hymns which replace the Kontakion, the Kontakion of the day (i.e., that day of Holy Week) is chanted. On Great Thursday and Saturday, the Little Hours are more like normal, except that a Troparion of the Prophecy, prokeimena, and a reading from Jeremiah are chanted at the First Hour on Great Thursday. On Great Friday, the Royal Hours are chanted. During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes similar to those during Great Lent, except the hymns are usually read instead of chanted, and there are no kathismata on weekdays. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, the Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read immediately after the First Hour (at least on the first day of the Fast).The Inter-Hours may also be read during Great Lent if there is to be no reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent at the Little Hours. The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, except they are shorter. When the Inter-Hour follows the First Hour, the dismissal is said at the end of the Inter-Hour rather than at the end of the First Hour. When the Royal Hours are chanted (the Eve of Nativity, the Eve of Theophany and Great Friday), the First Hour is not joined to Matins as normal, but it becomes the first office in an aggregated office composed of the First, Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours and the Typica. This is the most elaborate form of the First Hour. Both the priest and deacon are vested and serve, and the Gospel Book is set on an analogion (lectern) in the center of the temple (church building). At the beginning of the First Hour, the deacon performs a full censing of the church, clergy and faithful. Two of the three fixed psalms (89 and 100) are replaced by others that are appropriate to the particular feast day being celebrated. A number of hymns (stichera) are sung in place of the Troparion of the Day. Then a prokeimenon, the reading of a relevant Old Testament prophecy, an Epistle and a Gospel are chanted. The Kontakion of the Day is chanted by the choir, instead of being read. Since at the Royal Hours other services immediately follow the First Hour, there is no dismissal. =Oriental Orthodox= The various Oriental Orthodox and Oriental Catholic Rites vary in the particulars of the First Hour, but in general tend to have a larger number of psalms in them. In some Rites it is the practice to recite the entire Psalter once a day (as opposed to once a week, as in the Western and Constantinopolitan Rites). Armenian Liturgy In the Armenian Liturgy, the office following the Morning Hour is called the Sunrise Hour (Armenian: Երեւագալ Ժամ yerevagal zham). The Armenian Book of Hours (Zhamagirk\`) states that this service is dedicated “to the Holy Spirit and to the resurrection of Christ and to [his] appearance to the disciples.” Outline of the service Introduction: “Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...” First station: Psalm 72:17-19 “Glory...Now and Ever...Amen.” “Again and again in peace...Accept, save, and have mercy.” “Blessing and glory to the Father...Amen.” Sunrise Hymn attributed to St Nerses: “From the East...(Arewelits\`...)” Exhortation: “From the East unto the West, children of Sion...” Proclamation of Sunrise, to follow the hymn and the canon, composed by Giwt: “From the East unto the West in all parts of Christendom...” Prayer: “From the East unto the West you are praised...” Second station: Psalm 100: “Rejoice in the Lord all the earth...” Hymn: “Ascetics of God...(Chgnawork\` Astoutsoy...)” Exhortation: “True ascetics, witnesses of Christ...(Chgnawork\` chshmaritk\` vkayk\` K\`ristosi...)” Supplication: “We entreat [you]...(Aghach\`emk\`...)” Proclamation: “Through the holy ascetics...(Sourb chgnaworawk\`n...)” Prayer: “Holy are you, Lord...(Sourb es Tēr...)” “Remember your ministers...” “Beneficent and plenteous in mercy...” Third station: Psalms 63, 64 “Glory...Now and always...Amen.” Hymn: “Light, creator of light...(Loys ararich\` lousoy...)” Exhortation: “Uncreated God...(Aneghanelid Astouats...)” Supplication: “By your light...(Lousovd...)” Proclamation: “And again in peace...Let us glorify...” Prayer: “Accept out morning prayer...(Zarawawtou...)” Fourth station: Psalms 23, 143:8-12, 46:1-7, 70, 86:16-17 “Glory...Now and always...Amen.” Hymn: “Way and truth...(Chanaparh ew chshmartout\`iwn...)” Exhortation: “Christ the good way...(Chanaparh bari K\`ristos...)” Supplication: “Lord, make straight our steps...(Tēr, oughghya zgnats\`s mer...)” Proclamation: “Let us beseech almighty God...(“Aghach\`ests\`ouk\` zamenakaln Astouats...)” Prayer: “Guide of life...(Arajnord kenats\`...)” but during fasts on days when there is no commemoration: Prayer: “Blessed are you, Lord God...(Awrhneal es Tēr Astouats...)” Conclusion: “Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...” This service remains unchanged throughout the liturgical year, with the exception of the last prayer. = East Syriac = The East Syriac Rite does not have a separate service of First Hour, having only three daily services in their office: Evening, Morning and Noonday.

All required statistics and rules are printed on the cards. There are two types of cards: Gamemaster cards for adventure generation and Player cards for character generation. An expansion set, titled Kanchaka Valley, is available in booster form, and additional deluxe cards were created and sold on an individual basis. This is collectively known as Classic Dragon Storm. Over past several years, Dragon Storm 2.0 (DS 2.0) has been created and developed. DS 2.0 is an updated version of the game having taken into account the first 15 years of play and correcting some errors that crept into the game over time. It also utilizes a new modular character creation system which allows players to fully customize their characters. The Classic system, while totally viable, is more restrictive. There is also a dwindling supply of Classic product available. DS 2.0 is currently under the purview and production of The Guild for Dragon Storm. Setting Dragon Storm is a role- playing game about shape shifters: human werewolves, dwarven gargoyles, human dragons and elven unicorns. These characters live in an area known as the Stormlands. They use supernatural powers to battle powerful enemies, and to save the world from Dragon Storms. Most Stormlanders live like peasants of the European Middle Ages. They are ruled by nobles, who spend their time fighting for control of Stormland city-states. These struggles mean little to most people, who live in isolated villages scattered throughout the land. Magic is more important to stormlanders. They respect Od, the force of pure magic, used by wizards, witches and shamans to heal and protect. They fear Warp, corrupt magic used by necromancers to debase and destroy. Warp can blight a land, poisoning water and tainting the soil. It twists living things into warpspawn and plague beasts, insane monsters who kill for pleasure. Stormlanders are superstitious, tough and resigned to their fate. They take consolation in the worship of Elethay, goddess of the earth. Few peasants dare hope for better times ahead. Only the elders talk about Valarian Champions, legendary heroes who will save the people from the storms. The stormlands got its name from dragon storms, tempests of wild magic that ruin crops, level homes, and cause the tox, a horrible disease which twists body and soul. It is little wonder that Stormlanders who suffer misfortune are called storm-struck. When caught in the open by a dragon storm, young adults sometimes transform into shape shifters. Elves become unicorns, dwarves become gargoyles and a human might turn into a werewolf or a dragon. After the storm passes, these shape shifters return to their mortal form, and are able to control their ability to change shape. No one understands why some people change, but it is a fearful thing. Shape shifters are magical beings with strange and disturbing powers: Gargoyles can reach through solid stone, unicorns can heal with a touch of their horns, werewolves fight with terrifying fury and dragons can breathe fire. These abilities unsettle most Stormlanders, but they are even more frightened of necromancers, evil wizards who hunt shape shifters. Necromancers can drain shape shifters of their natural magics, using the power to fuel toxic spells. Feared by their families and hunted by necromancers, these young shape shifters usually flee their homes before anyone discovers what they have become. In Dragon Storm players role-play a shape shifter or an orc. Their opponents are necromancers, warpspawn and adventurers; their allies are Elethay worshippers and Prismatic Wizards, who oppose necromancers and all their works. Long-lasting characters may acquire a mentor. These veteran spell casters and warriors are dedicated to the destruction of necromancers and Warp. Characters befriended by mentors can become Valarians Champions, and join the fight against the evil poisoning the world. Reception Andy Butcher reviewed Dragon Storm for Arcane magazine, rating it a 6 out of 10 overall. Butcher comments that \\"As an introduction to roleplaying, Dragon Storm has a great deal of potential for both players and referees, especially those with prior experience of one or more CCGs.

He died on 31 October 2013.Dr Charles Walter Suckling CBE FRS Halothane research At the time of Suckling's original research, the main anaesthetic gases in use were chloroform and diethyl ether, both of which had several serious drawbacks. Ether was highly flammable, which was particularly dangerous in operating theatres as electrical equipment such as diathermy became more common. Chloroform was toxic to the liver. The halogenated alkanes (alkyl halides, also known as haloalkanes) in general, and in particular the fluorinated compounds were promising because they were volatile but not flammable. Suckling had worked on such compounds extensively during World War II, when they were used in the production of high-octane aviation fuel, and in the purification of uranium-235. He proceeded to synthesise a variety of fluorinated hydrocarbons before evaluating them for anaesthetic properties. He liaised closely with clinicians, initially in setting target physicochemical properties for ideal agents and then later in evaluating the developed compounds. Suckling first investigated halothane's anaesthetic action by experimenting on mealworms and houseflies, and then forwarded it to Jaume Raventos, a pharmacologist, for evaluation of anaesthesia in other animals. After Raventos established its pharmacological properties, it was given to Michael Johnstone, an anaesthetist in Manchester, England, who recognised its great advantages over the other anaesthetics available and established its first clinical trial in 1956. This process of systematic study of chemical compounds with a set of pre-defined characteristics has been identified as one of the first examples of modern drug design. References Suckling, C. W.

It consists mainly of psalms and is said around 3 pm, about the ninth hour after dawn.Jean Villanove, Histoire populaire des Catalans : des origines au XVe siècle, t. 1, J. Villanove, 1978, XII-339 p. Following Vatican II, the hour is optional in the Catholic Church: it may be said whenever convenient during the day or omitted entirely. However, bishops and priests are still expected to recite the full sequence of hours, as closely as possible to the traditional time of day.General Instruction No. 29. In the Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church, Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church, it is one of the seven fixed prayer times to be recited by all Christians. History = Origin = According to an Ancient Greek and Roman custom, the day was, like the night, divided into four parts, each consisting of three hours. Among the ancients the hour of Nones was regarded as the close of the day's business and the time for the baths and supper. This division of the day was in vogue also among the Jews, from whom the Church borrowed it. In addition to Morning and Evening Prayer to accompany the sacrifices, there was prayer at the Third, Sixth and Ninth Hours of the day. =Early Church= The Apostles continued to frequent the Temple at the customary hours of prayer (Acts 3:1): \\"Now Peter and John went up into the temple at the ninth hour of prayer.\\"Donovan, Colin B., \\"Liturgy of the Hours\\", EWTN At an early date mystical reasons for the division of the day were sought. St. Cyprian sees in the hours of Terce, Sext and Nones, which come after a lapse of three hours, an allusion to the Trinity. He adds that these hours already consecrated to prayer under the Old Dispensation have been sanctified in the New Testament by great mysteries--Terce by the descent of the Holy Spirit on the Apostles; Sext by the prayers of St. Peter, the reception of the Gentiles into the Church, or yet again by the crucifixion of Christ; Nones by the death of Christ. St. Basil merely recalls that it was at the ninth hour that the Apostles Peter and John were wont to go to the Temple to pray. St. John Cassian, who adopts the Cyprian interpretation for Terce and Sext, sees in the Hour of Nones the descent of Christ into hell. But, as a rule, it is the death of Christ that is commemorated at the Hour of Nones. The most ancient testimony refers to this custom of Terce, Sext, and Nones, for instance Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria, the Canons of Hippolytus, and even the Didache (\\"Teaching of the Apostles\\"). The Didache prescribed prayer thrice each day, without, however, fixing the hours. Clement of Alexandria and likewise Tertullian, as early as the end of the 2nd century, expressly mention the Canonical Hours of Terce, Sext, and Nones, as specially set apart for prayer. Tertullian says explicitly that we must always pray, and that there is no time prescribed for prayer; he adds, nevertheless: \\"As regards the time, there should be no lax observation of certain hours--I mean of those common hours which have long marked the divisions of the day, the third, the sixth, and the ninth, and which we may observe in Scripture to be more solemn than the rest.\\"Tertullian, De Oratione, xxiii, xxv, in Patrologia Latina(P.L.), I, 1191-3. Quoted in . Clement and Tertullian in these passages refer only to private prayer at these hours. The Canons of Hippolytus also speak of Terce, Sext, and Nones, as suitable hours for private prayer; however, on the two station days, Wednesday and Friday, when the faithful assembled in the church, and perhaps on Sundays, these hours were recited successively in public. In the 4th century there is evidence to show that the practice had become obligatory, at least for the monks. The eighteenth canon of the Council of Laodicea (between 343 and 381) orders that the same prayers be always said at Nones and Vespers. It is likely that reference is made to famous litanies, in which prayer was offered for the catechumens, sinners, the faithful, and generally for all the wants of the Church. John Cassian states that the most common practice was to recite three psalms at each of the Hours of Terce, Sext, and None. = Since the 7th century = Practices varied from monastery to monastery. At first some tried to do the entire Psalter (150 Psalms) each day, but eventually that was abandoned for a weekly cycle built around certain hours of the day. In the Rule of St. Benedict the four Little Hours of the day (Prime, Terce, Sext and Nones) were conceived on the same plan, the formulae alone varying. The Divine Office began with the Invitatory, like all the Canonical Hours; then follows a hymn, special to Nones; three psalms, which do not change (Psalm 125, 126, 127), except on Sundays and Mondays when they are replaced by three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118; then the capitulum, a versicle, the Kyrie, the Lord's Prayer, the oratio, and the concluding prayers. The writers of the Middle Ages have sought for other mystical explanations of the Hour of Nones. Amalarius of Metz (III, vi) explains at length how, like the sun which sinks on the horizon at the hour of Nones, man's spirit tends to lower itself also, he is more open to temptation, and it is the time the demon selects to try him. For the texts of the Fathers on this subject it will suffice to refer the reader to the above-mentioned work of Cardinal Bona (c. ix). The same writers do not fail to remark that the number nine was considered by the ancients an imperfect number, an incomplete number, ten being considered perfection and the complete number. Nine was also the number of mourning. Among the ancients the ninth day was a day of expiation and funeral service--novemdiale sacrum, the origin doubtless of the novena for the dead. As for the ninth hour, some persons believe that it is the hour at which our first parents were driven from the Garden of Paradise. In conclusion, it is necessary to call attention to a practice which emphasized the Hour of Nones--it was the hour of fasting. At first, the hour of fasting was prolonged to Vespers, that is to say, food was taken only in the evening or at the end of the day. Mitigation of this rigorous practice was soon introduced. Tertullian's famous pamphlet De jejunio rails at length against the Psychics (i.e. the orthodox Christians) who end their fast on station days at the Hour of Nones, while he, Tertullian, claims that he is faithful to the ancient custom. The practice of breaking the fast at Nones caused that hour to be selected for Mass and Communion, which were the signs of the close of the day. The distinction between the rigorous fast, which was prolonged to Vespers, and the mitigated fast, ending at Nones, is met with in a large number of ancient documents (see Fasting). In the Roman Liturgy the office of Nones is likewise constructed after the model of the Little Hours of the day; it is composed of the same elements as in the Rule of St. Benedict, with this difference: that instead of the three psalms (125-127), the three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118 are always recited. There is nothing else characteristic of this office in this liturgy. The hymn, which was added later, is the one already in use in the Benedictine Office—Rerum Deus tenax vigor. In the monastic rules prior to the 10th century certain variations are found. Thus in the Rule of Lerins, as in that of St. Caesarius, six psalms are recited at Nones, as at Terce and Sext, with antiphon, hymn and capitulum. St. Aurelian follows the same tradition in his Rule Ad virgines, but he imposes twelve psalms at each hour on the monks. St. Columbanus, St. Fructuosus, and St. Isidore adopt the system of three psalms. Like St. Benedict, most of these authors include hymns, the capitulum or short lesson, a versicle, and an oratio. In the 9th and 10th centuries we find some additions made to the Office of Nones, in particular litanies, collects, etc. Current practice =Catholic office= With the reforms of the Second Vatican Council the traditional one-week Psalter cycle became a four-week cycle. = Eastern Orthodox office = In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Churches the office of the Ninth Hour is normally read by a single Reader and has very little variation in it. Three fixed psalms are read at the Third Hour: Psalms 83, 84, and 85 (LXX). The only variable portions for most of the year are the Troparia (either one or two) and Kontakion of the Day. The service ends with the Prayer of the Ninth Hour by Saint Basil the Great. During Great Lent a number of changes in the office take place. On Monday through Thursday, after the three fixed psalms, the Reader says a kathisma from the Psalter. The Troparion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten hymns that are chanted with prostrations. Then a portion of the Ladder of Divine Ascent may be read. The Kontakion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten troparia. Near the end of the Hour, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said, with prostrations. During Holy Week, on Great Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, the services are similar to those during Great Lent, except that there is no kathisma, and instead of the normal Lenten hymns which replace the Kontakion, the Kontakion of the day (i.e., that day of Holy Week) is chanted. On Great Thursday and Saturday, the Little Hours are more like normal. On Great Friday, the Royal Hours are chanted. During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes similar to those during Great Lent, except the Lenten hymns are usually read instead of chanted, and there are no kathismata. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, an Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read immediately after each Hour (at least on the first day of the Fast). The Inter-Hours may also be read during Great Lent if there is to be no reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent at the Little Hours. The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, except they are shorter. =Oriental offices= Syriac Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church and Mar Thoma Syrian Church In the Syriac Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church (both of which are Oriental Orthodox Churches), as well as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), the office of None is also known as Tsha' sho\`in and is prayed at 3 pm using the Shehimo breviary. Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria In the Coptic Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox denomination, the Compline is prayed at 3 pm using the Agpeya breviary before retiring. Armenian Apostolic Church In the Armenian Liturgy, the Ninth Hour (Armenian: Իններորդ Ժամ innerord zham) commemorates both the Son of God and the death and surrender of [his] rational spirit. In the Armenian Book of Hours and in many liturgical manuscripts, the Ninth Hour concludes with a service of hymns, psalms, readings, and prayers which would normally be recited during the Patarag (Divine Liturgy or Mass). In the Armenian Book of Hours and in many liturgical manuscripts, the ninth hour includes the service of prayers, hymns, and Bible readings which would normally take place at the Patarag (Divine Liturgy or Mass), without the prayers of the eucharistic canon (preparation, consecration, post-communion prayers) and many of the litanies. There is no separate heading for this service as there is for the other services in the Book of Hours. Still, this is a distinct service because the concluding “Our Father” which ends every Armenian liturgy, including all of the liturgies of the hours, also occurs at the end of the Ninth Hour proper in analogy to the First, Third, and Sixth hours, and before this additional service. This service may be called the Chash Service (Armenian: Ճաշու Պաշտաւն chashou pashtawn), the service of mealtime, which was taken at the end of the day at the conclusion of work, which would have been after the ninth hour. Since fasting before communion was the rule in the ancient church, the ninth hour suggested itself as the appropriate time to offer the Patarag. Thus, a service which contained the readings and much of the prayers from the Patarag was added after the Ninth Hour for those days when no Patarag would be celebrated. One can compare this Chash service to the Typica service celebrated in churches belonging to the Slavic tradition within the Byzantine liturgical rite. Not all ancient manuscripts of the Armenian hours have this service, therefore it is unclear whether this service is a later importation from the Byzantine liturgy, with the words and sequence of the Armenian Patarag substituted for those of the Byzantine Divine Liturgy. =Outline of the Service= Introduction: “Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ.

Its original name was the National Society for Autistic Children; the name was changed to emphasize that children with autism grow up. The ASA's stated goal is to increase public awareness about autism and the day-to-day issues faced by people with autism as well as their families and the professionals with whom they interact. The organization has promoted pseudoscience about autism, such as vaccine denialism. One of its founders, Ivar Løvaas, promoted inhumane treatments for autism that involved beating autistic children and shocking them with cattle prods. Founders =Ivar Løvaas= Ole Ivar Løvaas (8 May 1927 – 2 August 2010) was a Norwegian-American clinical psychologist and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is most well-known for his research on early behavior modification to teach autistic children through prompts, modeling, and positive reinforcement. The technique also had a history of using aversives to reduce undesired behaviors. Lovaas founded the Lovaas Institute and co-founded the Autism Society of America. He is also considered a pioneer of what is now called applied behavior analysis due to his development of discrete trial training and early intensive behavioral intervention for autistic children. His work influenced how autism is treated, and Lovaas received widespread acclaim and several awards for his work during his lifetime.SCCAP Award Winners: Division 53, (Retrieved 29 May 2018) =Bernard Rimland= Bernard Rimland (November 15, 1928 – November 21, 2006) was an American research psychologist, writer, lecturer, and influential person in the field of developmental disorders who is known for promoting autism-related pseudoscience.

It is older than the Bengaluru (Bangalore) city which has now overgrown engulfing many of its neighboring villages and towns. History of Yelahanka The city of Yelahanka had been in existence prior to the 12th century. The region was called 'Ilaipakka Naadu' during the rule of Cholas. A stone tablet of 1267 A.D found in Doddaballapur mentions Dechi Devarasa, ruling the region with Yelahanka as his capital under the aegis of Hoysala monarch 'Narasimha (Third)'. Later, during Hoysala rein, the city came to be known as 'Elavanka' and gradually shifted to 'Yelahanka'.Shaasana Parishodhane by Dr M.G. Manjunaatha, Dept. of Kannada, Mysuru Univ. It was also known as Elavank. Dr. Mike Ghouse, Center for Pluralism, Washington, DC. Of the numerous Rulers of different dynasties who ruled with Yelahanka as their Capital, the Kempe Gowdas are the most acclaimed. Hiriya Kempe Gowda (Kempe Gowda the First) built a fort in the adjoining village of Bengaluru and developed it as his new capital, probably due to its strategic location and slightly cooler climate being at a higher altitude. It was his son, Immadi Kempe Gowda, who had the famous watchtowers built in the four directions of the new city. Some Temples in Yelahanka—like the Venugopala Swamy Temple—have remained as a testimony to its rich past. Although a Fort's remnant could not be traced, a street nearby the Venugopala Swamy Temple is still known as 'Kote Beedi' or 'Fort Street'. Modern Yelahanka Yelahanka lies to the north of Bengaluru. It was a Municipal council and Taluk (lies below the District level in administrative setup) headquarters prior to the formation of BBMP (a metro corporation annexing the original Bangalore area and its suburbs) and now forms a part of Greater Bengaluru. A well-planned township was developed during the early 1980s to the north of the city by the Karnataka Housing Board and is identified by several names like 'Yelahanka Upanagara', 'Yelahanka Satellite Town', 'Yelahanka New Town' or simply 'Housing Board'. National Highway NH 44 passes through Yelahanka. The newly constructed Navayuga Devanahalli KIAL Expressway (Part of NH 44) also passes through the suburb and the northeastern fringes of Yelahanka, acting as a bypass road to avoid the Yelahanka suburb. State Highway 9 (Bangalore - Hindupur) passing in the south of Yelahanka bisects the suburb into Old Town and New Town. Yelahanka's business areas are Hospital Main Road and BB road in Yelahanka and in New Town are 16th 'B' Cross and Mother Dairy Cross and Yelahanka New Town, 4th phase. Yelahanka has several lakes surrounding it, adjoining: Old Yelahanka, Puttenhalli, Attur, Ananthapura and Allalasandra. The lake at Puttenahalli (3 km up the SH 9) has been declared a bird sanctuary. Most of these are either dry or are in bad condition due to emptying of untreated sewerage effluents into them. Yelahanka is on the verge of being the prime real estate hub in North Bengaluru owing to its vast undeveloped areas and easy access to the Kempegowda International Airport. Yelahanka has seen remarkable developments since its inception. Most major retail brands have a presence in Yelahanka. Major ones include Yelahanka Central, RMZ Galleria Mall and Dmart in Yelahanka New Town. Yelahanka Satellite Town, Yelahanka, Bangalore.

The road network to Yelahanka is one of the best in entire Bangalore. Yelahanka railway station is one of the oldest stations setup in Bangalore area and has railway lines connecting KR Puram and Bayappanahalli in the east and Yeshwanthpur in the northwest. If these tracks are improved and daily city passenger trains introduce, a big part of traffic congestion will be eased as more people will use trains. Since the tracks are already existing, it is better to use the existing infrastructure rather than investing in new activities like Metro. Kempegowda International Airport is located off Yelahanka. =Roadways= Yelahanka is connected with downtown Bangalore through a network of roads and a six lane dual carriageway highway. The same highway connects Yelahanka with Kempegowda International Airport. BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation), KSRTC serve Yelahanka with its network of buses.

It consists mainly of psalms and is said at 9 a.m. Its name comes from Latin and refers to the third hour of the day after dawn.  Origin  From the time of the early Church, the practice of seven fixed prayer times have been taught; in Apostolic Tradition, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray seven times a day \\"on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight\\" and \\"the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ's Passion.\\" This practice of seven fixed prayer times continues today in many Christian denominations. The origin of Terce, like that of Sext and None, to which it bears a close relationship, dates back to Apostolic times. According to an ancient custom of the Romans and Greeks, the day and night respectively were divided into four parts of about three hours each. The second division of the day contained the hours from about the modern nine o'clock until about midday; using the Roman numbering the hour just preceding this division was called hora tertia (the third hour) from which the word terce is derived. Since the Roman day was divided into twelve hours from sunrise to sunset regardless of day length, the timing for hora tertia depended on the latitude and day of year. At Rome's latitude hora tertia was in modern terms 09:02 to 09:46 solar time at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it was 06:58 to 08:13. These divisions of the day were also in vogue among the Jews at the time of Christ. In the New Testament we find mention of the sixth hour in ; and of the ninth hour, in . The Holy Ghost descends upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost at the third hour, . Some of these texts prove that these three hours were, in preference to others, chosen for prayer by the Christians, and probably also by the Jews, from whom the Christians appear to have borrowed the custom.  Development  The Fathers of the Church and the ecclesiastical writers of the third century frequently mention Terce, Sext, and None as hours for daily prayers. Tertullian, around the year 200, recommended, in addition to the obligatory morning and evening prayers, the use of the third, sixth and ninth hours of daylight to remind oneself to pray.Powell, M. G. \\"Introduction to Medieval Christian Liturgy\\", Introduction to the History of Christianity School of Divinity, Yale University. 1996 Clement of Alexandria and Tertullian refer only to private prayer at these three hours. The Canons of Hippolytus also speak of these three hours as suitable for private prayer. However, on the days called \\"days of station\\", that is to say Wednesday and Friday, which were set apart as especially consecrated to prayer, and Sunday, these hours were recited in public. St. Cyprian remarked that these three hours had been observed in the Old Testament, and that Christians should also observe them. In the fourth century the custom of praying at these hours became more frequent, and even obligatory, at least for monks. The elements of the prayer of Terce, Sext, or None before the fourth century probably consisted of psalms, canticles, hymns, and litanies. St. Jerome said, \\"...we must set aside stated hours for the duty of praying. Then, should any occupation keep us away from it, the hour itself will remind us of that duty. As such prayer times everyone knows of the third, sixth and ninth hours, the morning and the evening hours.\\"\\"The Eight Daily Prayer Periods\\", Benedictine Abbey of Christ in the Desert It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise Idea as to the composition of the hour of Terce. Most of John Cassian's Institutes III.3 is an exegetical justification for the offices of Terce, Sext, and None, in which he relates each hour to a scriptural passage in which an important event occurs at that hour. In this way, by directing the monks to scripture, the hours acquired an educational benefit.Chin, C. M., \\"Prayers and Otium in Cassian's Institutes\\", Ascetica, Gnostica, Liturgica, Orientalia, (M. F. Wiles, Edward Yarnold, ed.), Peeters Publishers, 2001 This was also the view held in Ireland, where the psalms selected for Terce focused on the glorification of the risen Christ.McNamara, Martin J., The Psalms in the Early Irish Church, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2000 It seems there was no universal practice of the communal recitation of these hours until the Middle Ages. On Sundays, Terce was sung in organum before the principal Mass, and included the hymn Nunc sancte nobis spiritus, which recalls the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles.D'Accone, Frank A., The Civic Muse: Music and Musicians in Siena during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, University of Chicago Press, 2007 In the monastery of Lerins, work commenced after Terse and continued until Nones.Fassler, Margot E. and Baltzer, Rebecca A., The Divine Office in the Latin Middle Ages, Oxford University Press, 2000 The custom of Little Hours grew up in the monastic and larger Church in the course of the centuries and still is followed in stricter monasteries and hermitages. These hours also continue to be prayed by many religious communities. Terce, Sext and None have an identical structure, each with three psalms or portions of psalms. These are followed by a short reading from Scripture, once referred to as a “little chapter” (capitulum), and by a versicle and response. The Lesser Litany (Kyrie and the Lord’s Prayer) of Pius X’s arrangement have now been omitted. Current Roman Catholic practice refers to Terce as \\"Mid-morning Prayer\\". The 1979 Anglican Order of Service for Noonday is based upon the traditional structure of the Little Offices.Armentrout, Don S., \\"Terse, Sext, None\\", An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, Church Publishing, Inc., 2000  Symbolism  The purpose of the \\"Little Hours\\" (Terce, Sext, and None) is to provide a brief respite from the day's activities and an opportunity for prayer. This time of day is associated with the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles on the day of Pentecost (\\"seeing it is but the third hour of the day\\" (). The Hour's general theme is therefore, the invocation of the Holy Spirit, and invokes the Holy Spirit for strength in dealing with the conflicts of the day. \\" It is a 'Come, Holy Ghost' upon the day's work.\\"Parsch, Pius. \\"Introduction to the Canonical Hours\\", Commentaries on the Breviary Oriental Christian usages =Syriac Orthodox Church, Indian Orthodox Church and Mar Thoma Syrian Church= In the Syriac Orthodox Church and Indian Orthodox Church, as well as the Mar Thoma Syrian Church (an Oriental Protestant denomination), the office of Terce is also known as Tloth sho\`in and is prayed at 9 am using the Shehimo breviary. =Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria= In the Coptic Orthodox Church, an Oriental Orthodox denomination, the office of Terce is prayed at 9 am using the Agpeya breviary. =Armenian Liturgy= In the Armenian Book of Hours (Armenian: Ժամագիրք zhamagirk\`) the Third Hour (Armenian Երրորդ Ժամ errord zham) is a short service with minimal changes depending on the liturgical season. It is celebrated \\"in commemoration of the descent of the Holy Spirit, and in commemoration of the First Mother's (i.e., Eve's) tasting [of the fruit of the tree at the center of the Garden], and of the liberation [of humanity] through Christ.\\" Outline of the Third Hour Introduction: “Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our Father...”; “Blessed is the Holy Spirit, true God. Amen.” Psalm 51: “Have mercy on me...”; “Glory...Now and always...Amen.”; Hymn of the Third Hour: “We bless you, unoriginate Father...

Amen. Our Father...”  Eastern Christian Office  In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Churches, the office of the Third Hour is normally read by a single Reader and has very little variation in it. Three fixed psalms are read at the Third Hour: Psalms 16, 24, and 50 (LXX). The only variable portions for most of the year are the Troparia (either one or two) and Kontakion of the Day. During Great Lent a number of changes in the office take place. On Monday through Friday, after the three fixed psalms, the Reader says a kathisma from the Psalter. The Troparion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten hymns that are chanted with prostrations. Then a portion of the Ladder of Divine Ascent may be read. The Kontakion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten troparia. Near the end of the Hour, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said, with prostrations. During Holy Week, on Great Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the services are similar to those during Great Lent (including the reading of a kathisma), but instead of the normal Lenten hymns which replace the Kontakion, the Kontakion of the day (i.e., that day of Holy Week) is chanted. On Great Thursday and Saturday, the Little Hours are more like normal. On Great Friday, the Royal Hours are chanted.

It consists mainly of psalms and is said at noon. Its name comes from Latin and refers to the sixth hour of the day after dawn. Meaning, symbolism and origin  The hora sexta of the Romans corresponded closely with our noon. Among the Jews it was already regarded, together with Terce and None, as an hour most favourable to prayer. In the Acts of the Apostles we read that St. Peter went up to the higher parts of the house to pray (). It was the middle of the day, also the usual hour of rest, and in consequence for devout men, an occasion to pray to God, as were the morning and evening hours. The Fathers of the Church dwell constantly on the symbolism of this hour. Noon is the hour when the sun is at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of God, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three angels. We should pray at noon, says St. Ambrose, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness. Origen, St. Augustine, and several others regard this hour as favourable to prayer. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of this hour. This scene from Good Friday is the background for Sext. \\"Lead us not into temptation\\" is the message of this hour.Parsch, Pius. \\"Introduction to the Canonical Hours\\", Commentaries on the Breviary It is also a time to ask God to grant one health and peace of heart, as in the traditional hymn Rector Potens. All these reasons and traditions, which indicate the sixth hour as a culminating point in the day, a sort of pause in the life of affairs, the hour of repast, could not but exercise an influence on Christians, inducing them to choose it as an hour of prayer. As early as the third century the hour of Sext was considered as important as Terce and None as an hour of prayer. The Didache, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian all speak of these three hours of prayer. Origen, the \\"Canons of Hippolytus\\", and St. Cyprian express the same tradition. It is therefore evident that the custom of prayer at the sixth hour was well established by the 3rd century. But probably most of these texts refer to private prayer. In the 4th century the hour of Sext was widely established as a Canonical Hour. In his rule St. Basil made the sixth hour an hour of prayer for the monks. St. John Cassian treats it as an hour of prayer generally recognized in his monasteries. But this does not mean that the observance of Sext, any more than Prime, Terce, None, or even the other Canonical Hours, was universal. Discipline on this point varied widely according to regions and Churches. Western Office Despite its antiquity the hour of Sext never had the importance of those of Matins, Lauds, and Vespers. It must have been of short duration. In the fourth and the following centuries the texts which speak of the compositions of this Office are far from uniform. John Cassian tells us that in Palestine three psalms were recited for Sext, as also for Terce and None. This number was adopted by the Rules of St. Benedict, St. Columbanus, St. Isidore, St. Fructuosus, and to a certain extent by the Roman Church. However, Cassian says that in some provinces three psalms were said at Terce, six at Sext, and nine at None. Others recited six psalms at each hour and this custom became general among the Gauls. In the sixth century the Rule of St. Benedict gives the detailed composition of this Office. Sext, like Terce and None, was composed at most of three psalms, of which the choice was fixed, the Deus in adjutorium, a hymn, a lesson (capitulum), a versicle, the Kyrie Eleison, and the customary concluding prayer and dismissal.St. Benedict of Nursia, Regula Chap. 17; cf. Chap. 18. One of the most common hymns used at Sext is Rector Potens, Verax Deus The term siesta derives from the canonical hour Sext. The practice developed from a Benedictine institution which provided that between the hours of Sext and None, the monks were allowed a nap to catch up on the sleep lost while chanting the night hours.Rosenstock-Huessy, Eugen. Rosenstock-Huessy Papers, Vol. 1, Argo Books, 1981, Terce, Sext and None have an identical structure, each with three psalms or portions of psalms. These are followed by a short reading from Scripture, once referred to as a “little chapter” (capitulum), and by a versicle and response. The Lesser Litany (Kyrie and the Lord’s Prayer) of Pius X’s arrangement have now been omitted. With the reforms of Vatican II, \\"Sext\\" is now called \\"Midday Prayer\\" in Roman Catholic practice. In monastic life it is seen as a time for refreshment, reflection, and renewal.Kennedy, Sr. Stanislaus. Seasons of the Day, Random House, 2009 The 1979 Anglican Order of Service for Noonday is based upon the traditional structure of the Little Offices.Armentrout, Don S., \\"Terse, Sext, None\\", An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, Church Publishing, Inc., 2000 Armenian Liturgy The six hour in the Armenian Liturgy commemorates God the Father, and the sufferings and crucifixion of the Son of God.

Amen. Our Father...” Eastern Christian Office In the Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Churches the office of the Sixth Hour is normally read by a single Reader and has very little variation in it. Three fixed psalms are read at the Third Hour: Psalms 53, 54 and 90 (LXX). The only variable portions for most of the year are the Troparia (either one or two) and Kontakion of the Day. During Great Lent a number of changes in the office take place. On Monday through Friday, after the three fixed psalms, the Reader says a kathisma from the Psalter. The Troparion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten hymns that are chanted with prostrations. Then, a special Troparion of the Prophecy is chanted, which is particular to that specific day of Great Lent. This is followed by a Prokeimenon, a reading from Isaiah and another Prokeimenon. Then there may follow a reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent. The Kontakion of the Day is replaced by special Lenten troparia. Near the end of the Hour, the Prayer of St. Ephraim is said, with prostrations. During Holy Week, on Great Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the services are similar to those during Great Lent (including the reading of a kathisma), but instead of the normal Lenten hymns which replace the Kontakion, the Kontakion of the day (i.e., that day of Holy Week) is chanted. On Great Thursday and Saturday, the Little Hours are more like normal. On Great Friday, the Royal Hours are chanted. During the Lesser Lenten seasons (Nativity Fast, Apostles' Fast and Dormition Fast) the Little Hours undergo changes similar to those during Great Lent, except the Lenten hymns are usually read instead of chanted, and there are no kathismata. In addition, on weekdays of the Lesser Fasts, an Inter-Hour (Greek: Mesorion) may be read immediately after each Hour (at least on the first day of the Fast). The Inter-Hours may also be read during Great Lent if there is to be no reading from the Ladder of Divine Ascent at the Little Hours. The Inter-Hours follow the same general outline as the Little Hours, except they are shorter.

He became a pupil of Alexandre Cabanel, Eugène Fromentin, and Jean- François Portaels, and one of the leading historical painters of modern France. Biography His father was the playwright Eugène Cormon. His mother was Charlotte Furais, the actress.Eugène CORMON At an early age he attracted attention for the perceived sensationalism in his art, although for a time his powerful brush dwelled with particular delight on scenes of bloodshed, such as the Murder in the Seraglio (1868) and the Death of Ravara, King of Lanka at the Toulouse Museum. The Musée d'Orsay has his Cain fleeing before Jehovah's Curse; and for the Mairie of the fourth arrondissement of Paris he executed in grisaille a series of panels: Birth, Death, Marriage, War, etc. A Chiefs Funeral, and a series of large paintings for the Museum of natural history in Paris with themes from the Stone Age, occupied him for several years. He was appointed to the Legion of Honor in 1880. Subsequently he also devoted himself to portraiture. Being well-accepted at the annual Salon, he also ran an art school, the Atelier Cormon in the 1880s where he tried to guide his students to create paintings which would be accepted by the Salon's jury. Among his students with whom he was unsuccessful on this point were, for instance: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Louis Anquetin, Eugène Boch, Paul Tampier, Émile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Other students included Alphonse Osbert, Marius Borgeaud, Theodor Pallady, Chaim Soutine and the Australian painter John Russell. Despite his moment of glory as a Beaux-Arts professor he was almost forgotten by 1924 when he was run over by a taxi outside his studio, and is barely remembered today save as the teacher of pupils more illustrious than himself.David Sweetman (1999), Explosive Acts, (published in the UK as Toulouse-Lautrec and the fin-de-siècle), New York: Simon and Schuster, p. 94  Selected paintings  File:Murder in the Seraglio by Fernand Cormon (1874).jpgMurder in the Seraglio, (1874) Image:Fernand Cormon 002.jpgThe Death of Ravana, King of Lanka (1875) File:Cormon, Fernand - Cain flying before Jehovah's Curse.jpgCain fleeing before Jehovah's Curse (1880) File:A Forge 1894 Fernand Cormon.jpgA Forge (1894) File:Fernand Cormon In Erwartung.jpgAnticipation (date unknown) File:Cormon Fernand Le harem Oil On Canvas.jpgA Harem (c.1877) File:The Deposed Favourite.jpgThe Deposed Favorite (date unknown) File:Fernand Cormon 006.jpgGoing Fishing (1888) References * External links *Atelier Cormon ~1885 (note e.g. [from left; mind inscriptions] Toulouse-Lautrec, Tampier, Anquetin; last row, second after sculpture, É.

It is found from the plains up to 8,000 feet. Habits A red Pierrot Feeding at Garware College, Pune, India The red Pierrot is a weak flier, and flutters about close to the ground. It flies in short bursts and settles often but not for very long. It basks with its wings half open, but prefers shade to sun, and jungle or undergrowth to open areas. It keeps on the wing almost till dark when it settles on the undersides of leaves and twigs often in company. It is sluggish early in the morning and late in the evening. It visits flowers of herbs, especially of the families Amaranthaceae and Acanthaceae, for nectar. It visits both ornamental and wild flowers and varieties of Alternanthera are among its favourites. It always sits with its wings closed to display the bright markings of its undersides. It fearlessness, weak flight and distinctive markings all indicate that it is a protected butterfly, which is peculiar considering that its host plants are not known to contain any sequestrable toxins. There is a mention in literature of the species being found at lights at night, however such phenomena are usually restricted to species that are crepuscular and this occurrence may be incidental.Usman, S., 1956.

The entire body is covered with tiny white setae or bristle-like hair. This caterpillar is a leaf miner by habit and this serves as its defense. As soon as it hatches it bores into the leaf and will spend the rest of its life between the epidermal layers of the leaf. Occasionally it will change leaves.

The pupa can be either on the under or upper surface of the leaf. It is yellow and covered with long light hairs. The pupa is also marked with numerous black spots all over the body. =Food plants= The larval host plants are Kalanchoe laciniata and K. pinnata of the family Crassulaceae (stonecrop family); the latter host being a common garden plant.

The war ended with the defeat of the Spanish forces at the Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, which brought about the independence of the entire '. The Ecuadorian War of Independence is part of the Spanish American wars of independence fought during the first two decades of the 19th century. The War =Beginning of the war= The military campaign for the independence of the territory now known as Ecuador from Spanish rule could be said to have begun after nearly three hundred years of Spanish colonization. Ecuador's capital Quito was a city of around ten thousand inhabitants. It was there, on August 10, 1809, that one of the first calls for independence from Spain was made in Latin America (\\"'\\"), under the leadership of the city's criollos, including Carlos Montúfar, Eugenio Espejo and Bishop Cuero y Caicedo. Luz de America was the nickname given to Quito; the city's call for independence was heard around the continent. On October 9, 1820, the port city of Guayaquil proclaimed its independence after a brief and almost bloodless revolt against the local garrison. The leaders of the movement, a combination of Venezuelan, Ecuadorian, and Peruvian pro-independence officers from the colonial army, along with Ecuadorian intellectuals and patriots, set up a Junta de Gobierno and raised a military force with the purpose of defending the city and carrying the independence movement to the other provinces in the country. By that time, the tide of the wars of independence in South America had turned decisively against Spain: Simón Bolívar's victory at the Battle of Boyacá (August 7, 1819) had sealed the independence of the former Viceroyalty of Nueva Granada, while to the south, José de San Martín, after landing his Army on the Peruvian coast on September 8, 1820, was preparing the campaign for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Perú. The news of Guayaquil's proclamation of independence spread rapidly to other cities in the Presidencia, and several towns followed the example in quick succession. Portoviejo declared its independence on October 18, 1820, and Cuenca—the economic center of the southern highlands—did the same on November 3, 1820. The stage was set for the campaign of the liberation of Quito. =The ' moves to the offensive= The military unit raised and financed in Guayaquil was given the name of ' (\\"Division for the Protection of Quito\\"). Its immediate purpose was to advance on the cities of Guaranda and Ambato, in the central highlands, hoping to bring them to the independence movement, and cutting all road communication between Quito and the cities of Guayaquil and Cuenca, so as to forestall any Royalist countermove from the north. The Division, under the command of Colonels Luis Urdaneta and León Febres-Cordero, both of them ringleaders of the revolt in Guayaquil, began its advance out of the coastal plain towards the highlands, and by November 7, was ready to begin its march up the Andes mountains. The first clash with a Royalist covering force was a success, occurring on November 9, 1820, at Camino Real, a strategic mountain pass along the road from Guayaquil to Guaranda. This victory opened the way into the inter-Andean highlands, and the capture of Guaranda soon followed. News of the presence of the patriot army in Guaranda had the intended effect: most of the towns in the highlands proclaimed their independence in quick succession, Latacunga and Riobamba doing so on November 11, and Ambato on November 12, 1820. By the middle of November, Spanish rule over the Presidencia had been reduced to Quito and its surrounding areas in the northern highlands. It looked as if the liberation of the entire territory would be easier than expected. =Spain strikes back= Hopes for a quick victory turned out to be premature and short-lived. Field-Marshal Melchor Aymerich, acting President and supreme commander of Royalist forces in the Presidencia de Quito, took swift action. An army of around 5,000 troops, under the command of veteran Spanish Colonel Francisco González, was dispatched south to deal with the 2,000-strong patriot army, stationed in Ambato. In the Battle of Huachi, on November 22, 1820, the Royalist army inflicted a severe defeat on Urdaneta's force, which had to fall back, badly mauled, to Babahoyo, on the coastal plains. Disaster struck the Patriots. The Spanish army continued its advance south, towards Cuenca, retaking all major towns along the way. On December 20, 1820, after the defenders of the city were defeated at the Battle of Verdeloma, Cuenca was retaken by the Royalist army. The authorities in Guayaquil, who on November 11, 1820, had issued a decree creating the ' (Free Province of Guayaquil), desperately organized a ragtag detachment from the survivors of Huachi plus some reinforcements (300 men altogether, including some 50 cavalry), ordering it to make a final stand at Babahoyo. As the Royalist army did not seem to be particularly inclined to come down to the plains to meet them, the Patriots sent some guerrilla bands back into the highlands, which were finally ambushed and massacred on January 4, 1821, at the Battle of Tanizagua. The guerrillas' commanding officer, Spanish-born Colonel Gabriel García Gomez, taken prisoner after the battle, was executed by a firing squad and decapitated, his head sent to Quito to be displayed before the population. Thus, amid total military failure and a number of Royalist reprisals on the civilian population of the cities of the highlands, the attempt of the ' to carry out the independence of the ' came to an end. = Sucre Enters the Scene = Antonio José de Sucre And yet, not all was lost: help was on the way. By February 1821, the foreign aid requested by the ' back in October finally materialized in the form of General Antonio José de Sucre, sent by General Simón Bolívar, President of Gran Colombia. Even more welcomed perhaps was what De Sucre had brought along with him: 1,000 muskets; 50,000 musket rounds; 8,000 bits of flint; 500 sabers, and 100 pairs of pistols. De Sucre's instructions were clear: \\"To liberate the capital city of Quito, whose taking will bring about the liberation of the whole Department\\", as the first step towards later operations aimed at securing the complete independence of Perú. Bolívar also informed Guayaquil that he would begin a simultaneous campaign from the north. =Second Battle of Huachi= By July 1821, Sucre had almost finished deploying the Army around Babahoyo, ready to advance on the highlands as soon as the weather allowed. Aymerich acted to preempt the patriot plans with a pincer movement: he would lead his Army from Guaranda down to Babahoyo, while Colonel González, coming from the southern highlands down to Yaguachi, would attack Sucre's flank. Thanks to a well-developed espionage network, Sucre was apprised of Aymerich's intentions, and sent General John Mires to deal with González. The encounter, which ended with the destruction of Gonzalez's force, took place near the town of Cone, on August 19, 1821. Upon receiving word of the defeat, Aymerich retraced his steps and headed back to the highlands. Sucre followed, his main force occupying Guaranda on September 2, 1821. Aymerich moved to block any further progress, and in the Second Battle of Huachi, which took place on September 12, 1821, annihilated Sucre's infantry. The Patriot forces lost 800 men, mostly killed, plus 50 prisoners, among them General Mires. As the battle had also taken a heavy toll on the Royalists, Aymerich decided against exploiting his victory with an advance on the coastal plains. On November 19, 1821, a 90-day armistice was signed at Babahoyo, putting an end to Sucre's ill-fated first attempt to liberate Quito.

Part of the Petit family and the first baronet of Petit, he was the grandfather of Rattanbai Petit, who was the wife of the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Family and death Dinshaw Maneckji Petit was born in Bombay, British India. Sir Dinshaw was married to Sanaya and was survived by Sir Dinshaw Petit (2nd Baronet). His grandson, Sir Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, 3rd Baronet, was married to, Sylla Tata, the daughter of Ratanji Dadabhoy Tata and the sister of Jehangir Tata, both of whom were the shareholders of the Tata Sons. His granddaughter Ratanbai Petit was the wife of the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Petit's great-granddaughter, Dina Jinnah, was married to Wadia Group chairperson, Neville Wadia, until their divorce. Dinshaw Maneckji Petit died on 1901 at Bombay. A posthumous portrait of the 1st Baronet was painted by Sir James Linton. Career As broker to European firms he amassed a large fortune during the period of speculation in Bombay at the time of the American Civil War. He founded the Manackji Petit Spinning & Weaving Mills. In 1854 Dinshaw Maneckji Petit founded the \\"Persian Zoroastrian Amelioration Fund\\" with the aim of improving the conditions for the less fortunate Zoroastrian co-coreligionists in Iran. The fund succeeded in convincing a number of Iranian Zoroastrians to emigrate to India (where they are today known as Iranis), and may have been instrumental in obtaining a remission of the jizya poll tax for their co- religionists in 1882. In 1886, he became a member of the governor-general's legislative council where he was criticized for playing a pro-colonial role despite being a non-official nominee to the council. He was referred to as a \\"gilded sham\\" and a \\"magnificent non-entity \\" by the nationalists. He devoted his wealth to philanthropic objects, among the public and private charities which he endowed being the Towers of Silence and fire temples of the Parsi, a hospital for animals, a college for women, and the Petit hospital. For the advancement of technical education, Sir D. M. Petit also donated premises worth Rs. 3,00,000 at Byculla, Bombay to the famous Victoria Jubilee Technical Institute (VJTI) (recognized by the Government of Bombay as the Central Technological Institute, Bombay Province). In winter 1923, that institute relocated to its present location in Matunga, Bombay. He was knighted in 1887, created the Petit baronet in 1890. The Petit surname is not traditionally Parsi and had come about in Sir Dinshaw's great grandfather's time in the 18th century. He had worked as a shipping clerk and interpreter for the British East India Company. French merchants who dealt with the lively, short Parsi clerk called him 'le petit Parsi'.

It takes the form of an angled metal bracket surrounding a metal contact point which completes an electrical connection between camera and accessory for standard, brand-independent flash synchronization. The hot shoe is a development of the standardised \\"accessory shoe\\", with no flash contacts, formerly fitted to cameras to hold accessories such as a rangefinder, or flash connected by a cable. The dimensions of the hot shoe are defined by the International Organization for Standardization in ISO 518:2006. Details such as trigger voltage are not standardised; electrical incompatibilities are still possible between brands.  Design  The hot shoe is shaped somewhat like an inverted, squared-off \\"U\\" of metal. The matching adapter on the bottom of the flash unit slides in from the back of the camera and is sometimes secured by a clamping screw on the flash. In the center of the \\"U\\" is a metal contact point. This is used for standard, brand-independent flash synchronization. Normally the metal of the shoe and the metal of the contact are electrically isolated from each other. To fire the flash, these two pieces are connected together. The flash unit sets up a circuit between shoe and contact—when it is completed by the camera, the flash fires. In addition to the central contact point, many cameras have additional metal contacts within the \\"U\\" of the hot shoe. These are proprietary connectors that allow for more communication between the camera and a \\"dedicated flash\\". A dedicated flash can communicate information about its power rating to the camera, set camera settings automatically, transmit color temperature data about the emitted light, and can be commanded to light a focus-assist light or fire a lower-powered pre-flash for focus- assist, metering assist or red-eye effect reduction. The physical dimensions of the \\"standard hot shoe\\" are defined by the International Organization for Standardization ISO 518:2006. Measured on a Nikon D3400, the internal dimensions are 18.7 mm x 18.0 mm x 2.05 mm whereas the external dimensions are 20.7 mm x 18 mm x 5.1 mm. The spacing between the \\"teeths\\" of the shoe is 12.6 mm.  History and use  Before the 1970s, many cameras had an \\"accessory shoe\\" intended to hold accessories including flashes that connected electrically via a cable, external light meters, special viewfinders, or rangefinders. These earlier accessory shoes were of standard shape and had no electrical contacts; contacts were added to produce the hot shoe. Canon, Nikon, Olympus, and Pentax use the standard ISO hot shoe with various proprietary electronic extensions. In 2014, camera accessory manufacturer Cactus combined these electronic extensions into a multi-brand hot shoe on their wireless flash transceiver V6. With multi-brand ISO hot shoe, cameras and flashes from different manufacturers work together. In 1988 Minolta switched to use a 4-pin proprietary slide-on auto-lock \\"iISO\\" connector. A compatible 7-pin variant, which allows battery-less accessories to be powered by the camera's battery were also made, but not widely used. Konica Minolta and Sony Alpha digital SLR cameras are based on Minolta designs and used the same connector, officially named Auto-lock Accessory Shoe, as well up to 2012. Since the electrical protocol remained mostly compatible, TTL and non-TTL adapters exist to adapt ISO-based flashes to iISO hotshoes and vice versa. Sony also used a variety of other proprietary hotshoes for other digital cameras, including the ISO-based 6-pin Cyber-shot hotshoe, the 16-pin Active Interface Shoe (AIS) and the ISO-based 16-pin Intelligent Accessory Shoe (IAS). Some of their NEX cameras used a proprietary Smart Accessory Terminal (versions 1 and 2). In September 2012, Sony announced a new ISO-based 21+3 pin Multi Interface Shoe for use with their future digital cameras of the Alpha, NEX, Handycam, NXCAM and Cyber-shot series. This quick-lock hotshoe is mechanically and electrically compatible with a standard 2-pin ISO-518 hotshoe, but electrically compatible with the previous Auto-lock Accessory Shoe with extensions, so that passive adapters ADP-AMA and ADP-MAA allow to use digital-ready iISO flashes on new cameras and some new Multi Interface Shoe equipment on older cameras, while providing compatibility with standard ISO-based equipment as well. Canon uses a non-ISO-based 13+1 pin hot shoe, named Mini Advanced Shoe on some of its camcorders.  Voltages  An internal camera circuit connects the center contact and shoe mount to trigger the flash. The magnitude and polarity of the voltage between the contacts on the flash in the open-circuit condition has varied between different flash units; this is of no consequence for a simple electromechanical contact on the camera so long as the energy is not so high as to damage the contacts. However, with more recent cameras with electronic triggering, excessive or insufficient voltage, or incorrect polarity can cause failure to fire, or damage the camera. The ISO 10330 specification allows for a trigger voltage of 24 volts. Some manufacturers, particularly Canon, ask for no more than 6 volts. Flash units designed for modern cameras use voltages which are safe and effective, but some older flashes have much higher voltages, up to hundreds of volts, which damage electronic triggering circuits. Some use negative DC polarity, or AC. iISO hotshoe contacts are only protected up to ca. 5 volts in some cameras. Minolta documented all their cameras' electronically controlled PC terminals and ISO hot shoes to be protected up to 400 volts. It is possible to connect an older high-voltage triggering flash to a camera which can only tolerate 5 or 6 volts through an adaptor containing the necessary voltage protection circuitry, typically using a high power TRIAC. Such adapters drain power from the flash's trigger voltage and therefore often do not need a power supply of their own. In order to avoid dangerous loops when connecting equipment in complex studio setups, better adapters offer voltage protection and galvanic isolation of the units. Such adapters will ensure that there is no electrical connection of any kind between both sides of the adapter, including ground. They use either transformers or opto-couplers to transfer a safe trigger impulse from the camera to the flash. They are powered by batteries, as their electronics cannot be powered from the flash. As an example, Minolta offered the PC terminal adapter PCT-100 (8825-691) for this purpose, which worked as a galvanic isolator and could withstand 400 volts DC or AC. The similar Sony flash sync terminal and ISO hotshoe adapters FA-ST1AM and FA-HS1AM also offer galvanic isolation as well, but only up to 60 volts DC or AC. Flash servos and radio triggers, e.g. PocketWizard, can also provide electrical isolation, as trigger and receiver unit are physically separate. The camera is only presented with the low voltage used by the local trigger unit, and the remote receiver unit is designed to tolerate up to 200 volts from its flash port. Slave flash, where the flash from a safe flash unit connected to the camera triggers an unconnected flashgun which, if connected, would present a dangerous voltage, is another way to use a flashgun which cannot be connected to a hot shoe; indeed, it can be used for a camera with built-in flash and no hot shoe. The trigger voltages provided by some modern flashes or radio triggers can also be too low to reliably trigger electronic circuits in the camera or receiver. Trigger circuit voltages below ca. 2 to 2.5 volts may exhibit this problem, unless the triggering circuit is specifically designed to work with such low voltages. Older cameras equipped with an electro-mechanical trigger contact may exhibit yet another problem. If they provide both an ISO hotshoe and a PC terminal, both are typically wired to the same trigger contact in the camera rather than triggered independently as in cameras with electronic triggering circuits. When only the PC terminal is used and nothing is connected to the hotshoe, a flash with high trigger circuit voltages connected to the PC terminal delivers this voltage on the normally unprotected middle contact of the camera's ISO hotshoe. If the photographer's eyebrows accidentally make contact with the middle contact, the electrical shock can cause pain or even injuries. One way camera manufacturers have used to avoid this problem was to use two independent trigger contacts, which, however, could cause flash synchronization problems. Another, as utilized by Minolta in all such cameras supporting a PC terminal, was to add a small switch on the side of the ISO hotshoe which disabled the middle contact until something was inserted into the hotshoe.  Modern cold shoes and other devices  There is still a need for accessory shoes without electrical function (cold shoes). They are used with off-camera flash units, mounted on stands and connected to the camera by cable or triggered by wirelessly. Accessories which do not connect electrically to the camera can be inserted into hot shoes, without using the contacts. For instance a stereo microphone or electronic viewfinder can be used in the Olympus XZ-1 camera's hot shoe. FotoSpot geotagging satellite positioning units utilize the accessory shoe for mounting to the camera.

Individual frogs of this species are often found elsewhere, having been accidentally relocated by transported fruit boxes. Confirmed sightings of breeding pairs have confirmed their survival in Victoria's cooler climate. Description Fawn/green colouration of the Eastern dwarf tree frog This is a small species of frog; females can reach a maximum size of 25–30 mm, while males may only reach 20 mm when fully grown. It is of variable colour (depending upon temperature and colour of surrounding environment), ranging from fawn to light green on top, and occasionally has black flecks on its back. A white line begins under the eye, and joins the white stomach. A brown line begins from the nostril, and continues across the eye, and between the green (or fawn) and white sections on the top and bottom of the body. This species' toe discs are only slightly larger than the toes, and toes are 75% webbed. Some individuals will have an orange posterior thigh. The tadpoles are bigger than the adult frogs, with a size of 30 mm. Ecology and behaviour This frog is associated with a wide variety of habitats, including coastal swamps, lagoons, dams, ditches, and garden ponds in forest, heathland, wallum country, and cleared farmland. It lives in reeds and similar plants both near and away from the water, and often inhabits banana trees in the northern areas of Australia, and are sometimes shipped with the bananas throughout Australia. They are known in Australia for becoming lost frogs by turning up in fruit shops outside of their normal range. Breeding Litoria fallax tadpole Breeding occurs at small ponds or dams, which have ample reeds or other emergent vegetation. This species will often breed in temporary water. Its call is a short, high pitched, wr-e-e-ek ip-ip, repeated three or four times. They emit their calls from a single submandibular vocal sac. The males call during the spring and summer seasons, often before and after heavy rain. About 200-300 eggs are laid at each amplexus, and clumps of spawn contain up to 35 eggs. The minimum tadpole lifespan is 118 days, at a consist temperature of 20 °C. Metamorphosis occurs from January to March, the metamorphs resemble the adults and are very small, only 9–13 mm in length. Similar species Litoria fallax spawn This species is a member of the dwarf tree frog complex. This species complex is composed of the northern dwarf tree frog (L. bicolor), the Cooloola sedge frog (L. cooloolensis), and the Wallum sedge frog (L. olongburensis), as well as this species. All of these species are similar in size and have a similar ratchet-like call. The species along the east coast often inhabits coastal wallum and acid swamps. Most of these species have more than one common name, with a least one name containing \\"dwarf tree frog\\". As a pet In Australia, the frog may be kept in captivity with the appropriate permit.

After attending Swarthmore College, he played second base for the Chicago White Sox and Cincinnati Reds in the 1910s. Rath was the batter hit by Eddie Cicotte in the 1919 World Series as Cicotte's signal to gamblers that the \\"fix was on\\" in that series. In an era before on-base percentage was a valued statistic, Rath was known for an ability to get on base by drawing bases on balls. His name was often reported as Maurice Rath. Biography Born in Mobeetie, Texas, Rath moved with his family to Philadelphia where he grew up. Rath attended Swarthmore College, but did not play for the Garnet Tide, for the school had not yet established a baseball program, but did pledge Delta Upsilon fraternity during his tenure. He played on teams in the Philadelphia area and moved to professional baseball in 1908, playing in Wilmington, North Carolina, and Lynchburg, Virginia. After playing for the Reading Pretzels, Rath began his major league career as a bench player for the Philadelphia Athletics in 1909, appearing in seven games. He was traded in the middle of the 1910 season to the Cleveland Naps because the Athletics already had star second baseman Eddie Collins. He was sent to the Baltimore Orioles of the Eastern League before the end of the season. In 1911, Rath was drafted by the Chicago White Sox. In 1912, he was the team's starting second baseman and had a breakthrough year, hitting .272 with 95 bases on balls and 30 stolen bases, in addition to outstanding defensive numbers. After a slow start in 1913, he was sent down to the Kansas City Blues of the American Association, remaining in the minor leagues until 1917. In 1915, he led the International League with a .332 batting average while playing for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Rath played for the Salt Lake City Bees in the Pacific Coast League in 1916 and 1917. In 1918, Rath joined the U.S. Navy and missed the 1918 baseball season. In 1919, he was back in the major leagues, given a chance to start by the Cincinnati Reds. In his comeback season he hit for a .264 batting average, drew 64 walks, and was the leadoff hitter for the pennant-winning Reds. He led all National League second basemen that year in assists, putouts and double plays. In the 1919 World Series, Rath was hit by a pitch to start the series, which was later found out to be a signal used by White Sox pitcher Eddie Cicotte that the fix of the World Series was on. After a mediocre 1920 season, Rath was sent to the Seattle Rainiers in the Pacific Coast League and then to the San Francisco Seals, where he ended his playing career. After his retirement, Rath ran a sporting goods store in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania. It was in that town that he took his own life at age 58. He had reportedly been in poor health for a couple of years. He is buried at Arlington Cemetery in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania. According to statistician Bill James, Rath's skills were generally unrecognized during his career. Before on-base percentage was considered an important statistic, there was little to distinguish him offensively.

Ophthalmology was one of the foremost branches in medieval Islamic medicine. The oculist or kahhal (کحال), a somewhat despised professional in Galen’s time, was an honored member of the medical profession by the Abbasid period, occupying a unique place in royal households. Medieval Islamic scientists (unlike their classical predecessors) considered it normal to combine theory and practice, including the crafting of precise instruments, and therefore found it natural to combine the study of the eye with the practical application of that knowledge. The specialized instruments used in their operations ran into scores. Innovations such as the “injection syringe”, a hollow needle, invented by Ammar ibn Ali of Mosul, which was used for the extraction by suction of soft cataracts, were quite common. Muslim physicians described such conditions as pannus, glaucoma (described as ‘headache of the pupil’), phlyctenulae, and operations on the conjunctiva. They were the first to use the words 'retina' and 'cataract'. Education and history To become a practitioner, there was no one fixed method or path of training. There was even no formal specialization in the different branches of medicine, as might be expected. But some students did eventually approximate to a specialist by acquiring proficiency in the treatment of certain diseases or in the use of certain drugs. Nevertheless, it was standard and necessary to learn and understand the works and legacy of predecessors. Among those one can mention, The alteration of the eye by Yuhanna ibn Masawayh, whose work can be considered the earliest work on Ophthalmology, followed by Hunain ibn Ishaq, known in the west as Johannitius, for his work The ten treatises of the eye. One of Hunain ibn Ishaq's innovations was to describe the crystalline lens as being located in the exact center of the eye. =Cataract extraction= The next major landmark text on ophthalmology was the Choice of Eye Diseases written in Egypt by the Iraqi Ammar ibn Ali al-Mawsili who attempted the earliest extraction of cataracts using suction. He invented a hollow metallic syringe, which he applied through the sclerotic and successfully extracted the cataracts through suction. He wrote the following on his invention: =Other contributions= Avicenna, in The Canon of Medicine (c. 1025), described sight as one of the five external senses. The Latin word \\"retina\\" is derived from Avicenna's Arabic term for the organ. In his Colliget, Averroes (1126–1198) was the first to attribute photoreceptor properties to the retina,Martin- Araguz, A.; Bustamante-Martinez, C.; Fernandez-Armayor, Ajo V.; Moreno- Martinez, J. M. (2002). \\"Neuroscience in al-Andalus and its influence on medieval scholastic medicine\\", Revista de neurología 34 (9), p. 877-892. and he was also the first to suggest that the principal organ of sight might be the arachnoid membrane (aranea). His work led to much discussion in 16th century Europe over whether the principal organ of sight is the traditional Galenic crystalline humour or the Averroist aranea, which in turn led to the discovery that the retina is the principal organ of sight. Ibn al-Nafis wrote a large textbook on ophthalmology called The Polished Book on Experimental Ophthalmology. The book is divided into two sections: \\"On the Theory of Ophthalmology\\" and \\"Simple and Compunded Ophthalmic Drugs\\".Albert Z. Iskandar, \\"Ibn al-Nafis\\", in Helaine Selin (1997), Encyclopaedia of the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine in Non-Western Cultures, Kluwer Academic Publishers, . Other significant works in medieval Islamic ophthalmology include Rhazes’ Continens, Ali ibn Isa al-Kahhal’s Notebook of the Oculists, and the ethnic Assyrian Christian Jibrail Bukhtishu’s Medicine of the Eye, among numerous others. Ottoman Empire In the Ottoman Empire, and well into the Republic of Turkey of the 20th century, a class of ambulatory eye surgeons, popularly known as the ‘kırlangıç oğlanları’ (‘sons of the swallow’) operated on cataract using special knives. From contemporary sources can be glimpsed that the reputation of these “blinding frauds” was far from spotless.Laban Kaptein (ed.), Ahmed Bican, Dürr-i meknûn, p. 31f. Asch 2007.

She continues to write, and also creates pottery and cooks. Life Jack Kerouac called Moraff \\"the baby of the Beat generation\\" because she was just 18 when they met but was already being published by Leroi Jones and in Evergreen Review. She was reading in various New York City coffeehouses when she was able to get out of a very restrictive home environment—complicated by plastic surgery needed to repair her face after a mutilation. In a 1964 interview with Paideuma (University of Maine), Kerouac called Moraff \\"the best girl poet writing in America\\". \\" Moraff and her lover moved to Vermont in late 1961, where they built a small one-room cabin on land belonging to a former Black Mountain College student with whom they exchanged work for rent. At that time Moraff was experimenting writing SOUND poetry.Denise Levertov article, Virginia Quarterly Review, aligning Moraff, Duncan, Creeley, Olson Robert Duncan sent a poem by her to Denise Levertov. Moraff's first child, Alesia, was born in 1966, and shortly afterward Moraff bought a remote hilltop farm in Strafford, Vermont. She taught herself organic farming practices and for many years raised the family's food and kept a cow and two goats. She made cheese and studied medicinal herbs. Her son Marco was born in 1971. In 1972 he was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis. In 1973, Moraff founded Vermont Artisans, Vermont's first craft sales and educational cooperative. She studied human nutrition and after 3 years of research devised a nutritional plan for Marco, which resulted in the writing of The Cookbook/Handbook to Nutrition for Kids Who Have Cystic Fibrosis. It was considered crazy to even discuss nutritional problems, let alone write a cookbook for children who required enzymes at every meal in order to metabolize food nutrients. Moraff self-published the book; it can be found in the CF Foundation's library, and is used by physicians who agree with her commonsense approach of telling one's child that it is his/her body that is ill, not the child-as-person. Marco grew healthy and ran long-distance track in high school. He became an artist, and many of his works are now in private collections. He also designed and built furniture using driftwood, branchwood, marble, and slate. He died in April 2007 as a result of his cystic fibrosis. Moraff met Chogyam Trungpa in 1974 through Allen Ginsberg. She thought she could learn Tibetan Buddhist breathing methods to help Marco develop lungs strong enough to resist the early ravages of CF. Moraff continued her Buddhist practice and study, attending the last seminary at which Trungpa was present, and later, ngedon school. Moraff began writing poetry again in 1976 when asked by a feminist lesbian press to sit on its editorial board. There she edited the magazine CONCH and co-edited an anthology of local women's writings and art. This included the first published work of Louise Erdrich. In 2007, Moraff was editing and collating a collection of previously published and unpublished work and was also working on a new collection (tentative title Machig Labdron Songs). Forthcoming in late spring 2007 is a booklet from Longhouse Publishers, FOOTPRINT. Although partially disabled, Moraff is still able to produce some pottery, mostly commissioned dinner sets. In the summer, she bakes wholegrain sourdough bread and sells it at local farmers' markets.

A modern hospital replaced the cottage campus in 1996. The hospital later renamed to Ontario Shores Centre for Mental Health Sciences, which operates on the same site.  History  In 1911, the Government of Ontario announced that a new 'asylum' would be built to replace a similar facility in Toronto, and a site on Lake Ontario in Whitby was selected the following year. Whitby was chosen due its relative proximity to Toronto and for cheap power and water provided by local utilities. Most of the buildings of the new Ontario Hospital for the Insane were constructed from 1913 to 1916. Upon completion, the site was taken over by the Government of Canada to serve as a military convalescent hospital for soldiers wounded in the First World War. The facility was returned to the Ontario government in 1919. The hospital was considered a model of mental health care for its era. Patients were housed in a cottage setting in an attempt to provide a home-like atmosphere to those undergoing treatment. The lakeside fresh-air environment was also seen as beneficial, as was the attached hospital farm. The farm was intended to make the facility self-sufficient in meat, milk and vegetables. It was operated until 1969. A nursing school was operated on the site from 1920 to 1972, when the responsibility for nursing training was transferred to Ontario's colleges. At its peak, the hospital was home to 1,650 patients. However, starting in the 1950s, new advancements in medication, therapy and care enabled a greater degree of community care. In 1968, the name of the facility was changed to the Whitby Psychiatric Hospital. As more patients were discharged into community settings, the number of in-patients dropped from 1,000 to 504 between 1970 and 1977. Over the years, the presence of the facility also had considerable effect on the Town of Whitby. Its original construction brought many tradespeople to the town, and until the 1960s, it was the largest employer in the municipality. In 1979, provincial studies indicated that the facility should be rebuilt. Construction on the new hospital began several years later in 1993, and was officially opened as the Whitby Mental Health Centre in 1996. Many of the old buildings remained on the site until 2005 and 2006 when most were finally torn down. Their condition had deteriorated over the years and they were a popular destination for urban explorers. Over the years, the area immediately adjacent to the hospital site has been developed and local residents complained about unsightly and unsafe buildings. Canadian alternative rock band Billy Talent shot their music video for Try Honesty in one of the old buildings in 2003, before they were torn down in 2005-6.

The production was directed and choreographed by Redha, with costumes by Dominique Borg and settings by Petrika Ionesco. The producers were Gérard Louvin, GLEM, and Universal Music. ! Since then, the musical has been performed in Verona, Rome, Canada, Antwerp, London, Amsterdam, Budapest, Szeged, Moscow, Vienna, Bucharest, Seoul, Pusan (South Korea), Taipei, Monterrey, Japan, Hong Kong, and Shanghai and has been translated into several languages, including Dutch, Italian, Hungarian, Russian, English, German, Spanish, Romanian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, and Slovak. Plot Differences from Shakespeare's plot include that the nature of the lovers' deaths is different, depending on the production. New characters such as Death (French, Belgian, Japanese, Netherlands, and Moscow productions only) and the Poet (French production only) appear for dramatic effect. Lady Capulet has a greatly increased role and in the case of the Hungarian version, has an affair with her servant. The role of Tybalt has changed slightly from being purely dark to a more pitiful character because of his growing up with the hate and a dark childhood, as well as an unrequited attraction to Juliet. =Synopsis= ;Act 1 A long- standing feud between the two leading families of the city of Verona, the Montagues and the Capulets, regularly erupts into violence on the city's streets. Irritated, the Prince of Verona decrees, on pain of death, the absolute prohibition on fighting in the city (Vérone). While Lady Capulet and Lady Montague denounce the violence of the two clans (La haine), Romeo (the sole heir of the Montagues) and Juliet (the daughter of the Capulets) are hopelessly in search for love (Un jour). At the Capulets, a ball is being held so that Juliet can meet Count Paris, who asked Lord Capulet for her hand (). In Verona, Romeo and his friends, Benvolio and Mercutio, hang about the streets (Les rois du monde, La folie). Romeo is afraid of... he doesn't really know, but he's afraid (J'ai peur). In the hope of distracting him, Benvolio and Mercutio, persuade him to accompany them, in disguise, to a ball being held at the house of the Capulets (Le bal). At his first sight of Juliet, the daughter of the Capulets, Romeo instantly falls in love with her, without knowing who she is (L'amour heureux). Tybalt recognize Romeo and informs Juliet's parents. Romeo and Juliet learn from the Nurse who they are (Le bal 2). Tybalt, broken (he loves Juliet in secret), acknowledges that he is the son of hate and contempt (C'est pas ma faute). After the ball, Juliet takes refuge in her room and dreams of Romeo (Le poète), who woos her at great personal risk in the Capulets' garden. They exchange lovers' vows and plan to marry in secret as soon as possible (Le balcon). Knowing that their families will never agree to their marriage, Romeo meets Friar Lawrence and asks him to marry them. He accepts hoping that this union will reconcile the two families (Par amour). In the morning, Romeo meets his friends and tells the Nurse, whom everyone makes fun of (Les beaux, les laids), that Friar Lawrence will marry them the following afternoon. The Nurse, who deeply loves Juliet as her own daughter, announces the good news to Juliet (Et voilà qu'elle aime). Finally, Romeo and Juliet are married (Aimer). ;Act 2 The next day, Benvolio and Mercutio meet Romeo: they accuse him of betrayal (On dit dans la rue). Out on the streets of Verona, Tybalt - unaware of his new blood tie to Romeo - searches for Romeo (C'est le jour) and when he finds him, challenges him to a fight, which Romeo refuses (Le duel). Mercutio takes up the challenge and is mortally wounded. Driven by guilt, grief, and youthful-hotheadedness, Romeo kills Tybalt (Mort de Mercutio). The two families, plunged into mourning, ask the Prince for revenge (La vengeance). Finally, he banishes Romeo from Verona and thinks about the political power (Le pouvoir). In her bedroom, Juliet learns the bad news from the Nurse. She is torn between the love for her cousin and for her husband. Romeo goes to Friar Lawrence's. He thinks banishment is worse than death (Duo du désespoir). Romeo and Juliet spend their wedding night together and Romeo makes his escape to Mantua (Le chant de l'alouette). Shortly after her husband has left, Juliet is informed by her parents that she is to be married to Paris. She refuses and they threaten to disown her (Demain). Upset, Lord Capulet sings about the love he has for his daughter (Avoir une fille). In her room, Juliet asks why she has to obey (Pourquoi). In Mantua, Romeo thinks of Juliet. In desperation, she turns to Friar Lawrence, who devises an ingenious plan, which he hopes will ultimately bring a happy ending for both the lovers and their two families (Sans elle). Juliet appears to go along with the marriage plans but, in the night before the wedding, she takes the drug prepared by Friar Lawrence which makes her appear dead (Le poison). Juliet is duly laid in the family vault, hoping to wake up to find Romeo waiting for her. Unfortunately, The Friar's message telling Romeo of the plan somehow goes astray, and instead he hears only from Benvolio that his wife Juliet is dead (Comment lui dire). Grief-stricken, he breaks into the Capulet vault, finds what he believes to be the mortal remains of his beloved, and takes poison to be reunited with her in death (Mort de Roméo). Soon afterwards, Juliet awakes to find her husband dead and she stabs herself with Romeo's dagger (La mort de Juliette). Friar Lawrence enters the vault and finds the two lovers dead. He complains to God (J'sais plus). When the whole story is told, the two devastated families agree henceforward to live in peace (Coupables).

However, there is a \\"Verona Reprise\\" which the Prince sings, after a shortened \\"Het Lied Van De Leeuwerik\\" (Le Chant de L'Alouette). Julia has a short reprise of \\"Ooit Komt\\" (Un Jour) just before \\"De Koningen\\" (Les Rois du Monde). *French Canadian: \\"C'est Pas Ma Faute\\" and \\"Le Balcon\\" are switched. There is no \\"Le Poete\\", \\"Le Pouvoir\\", \\"La Folie\\", or \\"Pourquoi?\\". *British Version: The orchestrations are very different from the other productions. There are no English versions of \\"J'ai Peur\\", \\"Le Poison\\", \\"La Folie\\", or \\"Pourquoi?\\". \\"Le Pouvoir\\" was replaced by a \\"Verona\\" reprise. \\"Sans Elle\\" was replaced with a \\"All Days Are the Same Without You\\" reprise, and there is a reprise of \\"Ugly or Beautiful\\" (Les Beaux, les Laids) and \\"Born to Hate\\" (La Haine) after it. \\"C'est Pas Ma Faute\\" has been replaced with \\"She Can't See Me\\" along with different music. \\"Guilty\\" (Coupables) was turned into a \\"Fools\\" (Duo Du Desespoir) reprise. *Hungarian Version: The order of the songs has been changed and there are some new songs which are reworkings of existing tunes. There are 3 reprises, Paris has his own song, (to the tune of \\"La Folie\\") and he shares a duet with Romeo (a \\"Le Duel\\" reprise). \\"La Haine\\" is about Lady Capulet and Montague insulting each other instead of resenting the feud. There is no \\"Pourquoi\\", \\"Avoir une Fille\\" or \\"Le Poete\\", the music remix in the curtain call is incredible. *Russian Version: Orchestrations are the same (with a slight variation of \\"Le Bal 1\\"). There are no Russian versions of \\"La Folie\\", \\"Pourquoi?\\", \\"Le Poete\\", and \\"Par Amour\\". However, there are versions of \\"Par Amour\\" and \\"Pourquoi?\\" on the cast recording. Like the Belgian/Netherlands production, \\"Utro\\" (Le Chant de L'Alouette) was also shortened, and the Prince sings \\"Vlast\\" (Le Pouvoir) after it. *Austrian Version: Some of the music is reminiscent to the British, but most stays true to the original score. Julia has a short reprise of \\"Einmal\\" (Un Jour), just before \\"Herrscher der Welt\\" (Les Rois du Monde). There is no Austrian version of \\"Le Poete\\", \\"Par Amour\\", \\"La Folie\\", or \\"Pourquoi?\\". \\"Der Gesang der Lerche\\" has been shortened, and there is a \\"Verona\\" reprise sung by The Prince after \\"Das Gift\\" (Le Poison). *Asia Tour Version: The arrangements are a mix between the Austrian and the original French. \\"Tu Dois Te Marier\\", \\"On Dit Dans la Rue\\", and \\"Le Pouvoir\\" were cut from the show. New songs include \\"Grosse\\", \\"A La Vie, A La Mort\\", \\"Je Veux L'Aimer\\", \\"La Folie\\", (originally cut from the French production, then brought back) and \\"Verone 2\\". \\"La Demande En Mariage\\" has been turned into a solo song sung by Lord Capulet. *Romanian Version: The order of the songs is changed and there are three new songs, reworkings of existing tunes. Paris has his own song on the tunes of \\"La Folie\\" and shares a duet with Romeo on \\"Le Duel\\". There is no \\"Pourquoi\\", \\"Avoir une Fille\\", \\"Le pouvoir\\" or \\"Le Poete\\" *Japanese Version: In the 2010 production Tybalt is a second lead role, so he gets another theme song by the name \\"Tybalt\\" =Costume Designs= Costume designs in the various productions are influenced by local renaissance costume traditions. *French Version: The costumes are 14th century with a touch of 20th century and are largely made of leather. The costumes of the Montagues are in shades of blue while the Capulets' are in shades of red. Costumes dignitaries of Verona are brown (Friar Laurence), gray and black (The Prince), and golden (Paris). *French Canadian Version: The costumes are exactly the same as the French version, except that of Juliet's. *Belgian/Netherlands Tour Version: Most of the costumes are the same as the French version, excepting those of Lady Montague, Friar Laurence, the Nurse, Mercutio, the ball gowns, and the wedding of Juliet. *British Version: The costumes from this production are very different from the French and Dutch. Generally they are a mixture of Renaissance, Victorian, Elizabethan, and 20th century. The colors for the Montagues are dark blue and white while the Capulets' are dark red and black. *Hungarian Version: The Hungarian costumes are perhaps the most different from all the productions. Some are reminiscent to the film Moulin Rouge, some have medieval connotations, and some are futuristic (like Benvolio's). *Russian Version: Costumes are a mix of French, Belgian, and new design (like that of Death's). *Austrian Version: The original designer of the French version, Dominique Borg, seemed to have gone with a more futuristic feel to the costumes in this production. Skin-tight and vibrant, they still perceptibly retain that 14th century touch. *Asia Tour Version: The Asian Tour costumes are different from the original French. Most are inspired by the film Moulin Rouge. The Montague boys wear colorful trench coats while the costumes of the ball are distinctly Roman. Others are similar to the costumes of the Hungarian version. *Romanian Version: The costumes are similar to those in the Hungarian version. *Japanese Version: The costumes are close to the fashion of the Austrian and Asia tour productions. Romeo and Juliette have the most costume changes. Montagues are seen in shades of blue (and sometimes green-blue) and the Capulets in red. The Prince wears silver and gold and Paris light silver with brown details. The ball outfits are white, with only blue or red touches on their masks to define them as Montagues or Capulets, Paris' mask has orange and yellow on it. Romeo is seen with his trademark Montague blue costume, the white for the ball, a baby-blue one with light brown shirt and another outfit of brown pants and boots and a light blue shirt. Juliette is seen with white and pink gowns, a white dress for the ball and her trademark Capulet red dress. Death wears a black tail tuxedo, with asymmetric tails, his costume is combined with a silver-white long haired wig and a tribal tattoo on his right cheek. Love wears a silk,light pink gown.http://www.asahi.com/showbiz/stage/gallery/100712/ =The Deaths of Romeo and Juliet= Below are descriptions of differences among productions in the treatment of the deaths of Romeo and Juliet. *In the original French production, after Romeo sings \\"Mort de Romeo\\", the character known as \\"Death\\" kills Romeo with a kiss. When Juliet wakes up to find him dead, she sings \\"La Mort de Juliette\\". Death then hands her Romeo's dagger, which she uses to kill herself. The Belgian/Dutch version follows this treatment as do the Russian/Asia Tour versions with some slight variation. *French Canadian Version: After singing \\"Mort de Romeo\\", Romeo drinks a poison and falls lifeless in front of Juliet's \\"death bed\\"; Juliet then finds him dead, and with his head on her lap she sings \\"La Mort de Juliette\\" and then kills herself with Romeo's dagger. *British Version: Romeo and Juliet both kill themselves with Romeo's dagger. *Hungarian Version: Taking Juliet into a harness, Romeo hangs himself as he is strapped to Juliet. Juliet kills herself with Romeo's dagger, however she slits her wrists instead of plunging the dagger into her heart. *Russian Version: Same as the French production. *Austrian Version: Romeo drinks a vial of poison, and similar to Romeo + Juliet, Juliet wakes up just in time to watch him die. She kills herself with Romeo's dagger. *Asia Tour Version: Same as the Austrian version. Romeo drinks a vial of poison after singing \\"Mort de Romeo\\", with Juliet waking up just in time to see him die. After singing \\"La Mort de Juliette\\", Death hands her Romeo's dagger, which she uses to kill herself. *Romanian Version: Same as the Hungarian version. *Japanese Version: After singing \\"Mort de Romeo\\", Romeo drinks a vial of poison and falls dead next to Juliet. Juliet wakes up after he is dead and she sings \\"La Mort de Juliette\\", believing at first that Romeo is just sleeping next to her and is still alive. Juliet later discovers that Romeo is actually dead and kills herself with Romeo's dagger.It is also the version which has no English sub and with the longest encore and largest amount of customs. *Italian version: Similar to the Austrian production and therefore that of Romeo + Juliet. She wakes up as Romeo is dying, having just drunk a vial of poison. Romeo dies in her arms. Juliet then sings \\"La Mort de Juliette\\", kisses Romeo and kills herself with his dagger.

It was also popular in America. The game is regarded as one of the games that influenced the open-card stud variation in poker.Shamshad Ahmed, Dictionary Of Games, p. 33, Isha Books (2006) It also gave rise to the Bouillotte lamp, consisting of one or several candlesticks with a central standard equipped with a non-flammable adjustable shade. often made of tôle, a painted or lacquered metal, reflective white on the inside, dark on the outside, that could be lowered as the candles burned down. Game A piquet pack is used, reduced to twenty cards by removing the sevens, tens and Jacks. When five people play, the Jacks are not removed, and when three play, the queens are taken out as well. The ace is the highest card in play and in cutting. Two packs are usually used, so that while one deck is being used, the other can be shuffled. Counters or chips, as in poker, are used. To determine where a person sits, a sequence of cards is taken out of the deck, equal to the number of players (e.g., with 4 players, an ace, king, queen, and nine are taken, etc.) They are shuffled, and each player draws one. The player with the ace chooses where to sit first, etc. First dealer is the player with the king. Before the deal each player \\"antes\\" one counter to the pot, after which each, the \\"age\\" passing, may \\"raise\\" the pot; those not \\"seeing the raise\\" being obliged to drop out. Three cards are dealt to each player, and a thirteenth, called the retourné, when four play, turned up. Each player must then bet, call, raise or drop out. When a call is made the hands are shown and the best hand wins. The hands rank as follows: *Brélan Carré, four of a kind, one being the retourné. *Simple Brélan, three of a kind, ace being high. *Brélan Favori, three of a kind, one being the retourné. Payments If more than one player has a brélan, the best is one that matches the rank of the turn up (a brelan carré, or \\"squared-up brelan\\"). If none matches, that of highest rank wins. Any player with a brelan receives a side-payment of one chip, two if it is a carré, from each opponent. If no player holds a brélan, the hand holding the greatest number of pips wins. All hands are turned face up, including those of players who dropped. The face values of all these cards are totalled for each suit, ace counting 11, court cards 10 and numerals their face value. The \\"best suit\\" is the one with the highest visible total, and the player holding the highest card of it wins the pot, provided that he has not previously dropped. If he has, the winner is the player counting the greatest face value of cards in any other suit.

History Scouting activities in today's North Macedonia began in 1921 under the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with the formation of groups known as stegs in the cities of Skopje, Kumanovo, Štip, Strumica, Bitola, and Struga. As part of Yugoslavia, then Socialist Republic Macedonia was a founding member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement from 1922 to 1948. In this period, summer camps, courses and other Scouting events were held. Until 1941, Macedonian youth was organized in Scouts and Falcons (Sokól, a Slavic youth movement founded in Prague in 1862). Scouting in Yugoslavia was coopted by the Tito government in 1950, at which time WOSM membership was forfeited. In November, 1953 Sojuz na Izvidnici na Makedonija was officially founded, on the initiative of former Scout organization members, as a branch of the Yugoslav Scout association Savez Izviđača Jugoslavije, which it remained until the breakup of Yugoslavia.

Ostensibly, Tomica diecast were an outgrowth of Tomica World, an autonomous toy line of motorized train accessories that Tomy had created based on Plarail and produced since 1959 (About Tomica 2013). Similar in concept, Tomica can be thought of as the Matchbox of Japan - but focuses mainly on Japanese brands.  History  Tomy Co. of Japan was founded in 1924 by Eijira Tomiyama in Tokyo (Robinson 2010). The company has produced a variety of toys, but in 1970 started production of the Tomica line of diecast vehicles as a result of the surge of interest in the global market in toy cars which was led mainly by Matchbox and Mattel's Hot Wheels (About Tomica 2013). Although models of various scales have been made, the name \\"Tomica\\" normally refers to the 3-inch sized mainstream vehicles most commonly produced by the company. Originally, the name \\"Pocket Cars\\" was given to Tomicas sold in the 1970s in the United States. After four decades, Tomy Corporation again entered the North American and European markets with the Tomica name in 2010.  Typical Tomicas  = Tomica Domestic Series (\\"Black Box\\" / \\"Red & White Box\\") = Initially, Tomica only produced Japanese brand cars and trucks. This started with the release of six models in 1970. The seventh was issued later in the year. From that time, the Tomica line grew until there was a total of 109 concurrent models by 1978 — number 1 through 108 and also number 110 (109 was proposed, but never released). The variety of models also expanded from the initial coupés and sedans to taxis, buses, trucks, construction and other commercial vehicles. Even a steam engine and an ocean liner were offered. As new models were issued, each was assigned a number up to 110, replacing an existing model. \\"Pocket Cars\\" packaging was for the North American market. In the early 1980s, Tomy experienced financial difficulties, and in 1983 the domestic model line was reduced to only 80 models (nos. 1 – 80). These models were mainly packaged in picture boxes that had black background with yellow flaps. Later, new models came in a box with a red and white background (Rixon 2005, 99). Existing models issued before 1984 kept using the older style box with black background until 1988, when all boxes were updated to the new style. Hence, domestic models are commonly referred to as the \\"black box\\" or \\"red and white Box\\" models. = Tomica Foreign Series (\\"Blue & White Box\\" / \\"Pocket Cars\\") = To compete in the global toy car market, Tomy early on, had plans of exporting its models. This was done starting in 1974 with the appearance of \\"Tomy Pocket Cars\\" in Canada and the United States. The marketing ploy was a blister package designed like a denim jeans 'pocket' with yellow 'stitching' around the outside of the card and the vehicle. Since Japanese cars were not yet booming sellers overseas, in 1976 Tomy started producing 'foreign' (non-Japanese) models. Present were American, German, Italian, British, and French cars, among others, making the Tomica product line more global. Partly because Pocket Cars were more expensive than Hot Wheels or Matchboxes in the American market, this blister pack series was not seen much after 1979 (Johnson 1998, 233). Tomica continued successfully, however, in the home market, where each foreign car was packaged in a picture box that showed a flag of the country of origin of that particular car. The boxes often did not show the number of the car, but it could be seen on the base. Since these boxes have the base colors of blue and white, they are also called the \\"blue-and-white box\\" models. At any one time, a total of 70 models were produced under the foreign line, numbered F1 to F70. A Bajaj / Diahatsu Midget 3 wheeled delivery truck of the ubiquitous type. A very authentic Asian Tomica rendering. These cars from the 1970s and 1980s hold their value well. they sell for between $15 and $20 US on eBay and other on-line sales sites. Perhaps because of their greater scarcity as well as realism, these values hold up much better than most Matchbox vehicles from the same time period. = Tomica Common Series (\\"Red-and-White Box\\") = Common series sales shelf in Japan. In 1988, Tomy combined its foreign models into the domestic series. Most of the first 40 models from the foreign series were added to the 80 domestic models. Those foreign models that got transferred were assigned a number that was its F series number plus 80. A handful of these foreign models were discontinued after a few months’ appearance under the new line. Overall about half of them had been discontinued after two years. = Tomica Limited Series = From 2001 to 2013, Tomy produced the TL series targeted for the collector. These models are made with higher details, and one of their biggest features is realistic-looking wheels with rubberized plastic tires. Although many of them are based on existing or discontinued regular Tomica models, some are new castings made exclusively for the TL line, namely, Nissan Skyline GTB, Toyoda AA, and new MINI Cooper. In the case of the new MINI Cooper, the model was first released for the TL series in 2004 but in 2006 included in the regular line as no. 43. Model numbers started at 0001. Each model is produced for a limited period of time, so models with smaller numbers are discontinued while new models with higher numbers continue to appear. These models are packaged in open cardboard boxes surrounded on four sides with a transparent plastic sleeve. = Tomica Premium Series = Tomica started to offer the Tomica Premium Series from April 2015. The Premium line replaced Tomica Limited Series. the main differences are that it uses new molds for the vehicles and are not a limited release but in regular production that numbered with the same scheme as the classic line (re-using numbers for unrelated models). They were also aimed at a younger audience. = Special, Promotional and Event models = Tomica has produced a number of special models over the years. These are unique models that are not found in the regular line or the Limited Series. There are four types of special model: *An existing regular model with small modifications or additions of accessories. These can be in the form of TEM (Tomica Event Models, Tomica shop exclusives, as well as gift/box sets. *A truck model that shares the cab and the chassis of an existing model. These are also common for gift sets although also found as stand-alone models. *A model that is based on an existing model but has the major car body modified. Examples are: ** Honda S800M Convertible modified from no. 23 Honda S800M ** Mitsubishi Pajero Rally Type was modified from no. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero Metal Top. This model was produced for the Ralliart Team Set. ** Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE-86 Hatchback, modified from no. 78 Toyota Sprinter Trueno Coupe. This was produced for the Initial D Set. *A totally new casting. All of these had been produced under the contract of another model company or another business. Their common fate is that Tomy eventually issues them as regular models. Examples include: ** Nissan Skyline GT-R R33 Racing Type (issued as no. 40 in 1997) ** Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IV (issued as no. 104 in 2000) ** Mitsubishi New Canter Panel Truck (issued as no. 29 in 2003) ** Subaru Legacy Touring Wagon (issued as no. 11 in 2003) ** Hummer H2 (issued as no. 15 in 2007) ** Nissan Laurel (issued as no. LV-52 in 2007) ** Isuzu Giga (issued as no. 76 in 2007) * Also, in 2004, no. 121 was available for a limited period from Mitsuoka Motors. This was a 1/1 scale electric single seater vehicle which featured a retro Citroen H Van front end and side panels. = Japan, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Vietnam Castings = Until 1993, Tomica models were almost exclusively produced by Tomy in their local factory in Tokyo, Japan. However, since the early years, Tomy had outsourced some production to another country with cheaper labor cost. By mid-2003, all production were outsourced and Tomy no longer produced any Tomica in their own factory. Hong Kong was the first place outside of Japan where Tomica cars were produced. The production in Hong Kong only lasted a few years. Six models issued in 1971 and 1972 were made in Hong Kong: *1971 - No.10 Honda N360 *1971 - No.11 Toyota Sprinter *1971 - No.12 Mazda Capella Rotary Coupe *1972 - No.30 Mitsubishi Galant *1972 - No.33 Nissan Cedric *1972 - No.42 Datsun 1300 Pick- Up Limited production in China started in 1990 with a few existing models in the regular line, like the no. 35 DOME Toyota Celica and no. 73 Isuzu Dump. Large scale production in China started in 1993 with the \\"British Line\\" of 36 models that Tomy Company of UK contracted Tomy of Japan to produce by using existing tooling. As a result, regular models of the same castings were also made in China beginning in 1993. Starting in 1994, all the new models in the regular line were made in China, and in May 1995, the production of existing models started to move to China as well. This was done in phases. By July 1997, all regular line Tomica cars were made in China. There were a few exceptions to this rule: *No. 9 Komatsu Power Shovel PC200, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was already planned in 1994 and also because it shared components with the older no. 9. Production was moved to China when the model was produced for a gift set later in 1995. *No. 20 Nissan Skyline GT-R R33, issued in 1995, was made in Japan because the model was also used for special releases under the contract of II ADO, a popular chain of minicar shops in Japan. Production was moved to China in 1997 along with others during the last phase of moving. *No. 30 Mitsubishi Pajero, issued in 1999, was made in Japan because the model was concurrently issued as a special promotional model for Mitsubishi Motors in Japan. Production moved to China after two months, when the promotion stopped. *No. 105 Coca-Cola Route Truck, issued in 1996, was made in Japan as well. However, this model was simply a different colour and livery on an existing casting, so it was not truly a new model. While production in Japan ceased in 1997 for the regular models, Tomy kept producing special models in Japan until 2003, using old castings not used for mass production of the British line, regular models, or gift sets. Because these older castings had remained in Japan, special releases and promotional issues using these older castings were still made in Japan. New castings for special models were also made in Japan. The Subaru Legacy from 2003 was the last Tomica ever produced in Japan. Production of Tomicas started to move to Vietnam in early 2009. This was also done in phases and took several years. Unlike the move from Japan to China during which no new regular models were made in Japan (besides the few exceptions), during this time new releases came from both Vietnam and China until 2013. In 2010, when Technology Tomica was introduced, they were initially made in Thailand. In 2012, production moved to Vietnam. = Wheel styles = A Toyota Hiace from the 1970s with older 2-piece wheels. A Morgan Plus Eight. Note the typical five studded wheel style. The earliest Tomica cars had one-piece chrome-plated wheels. Starting in 1971, models were produced with two-piece wheels of various styles, with the one- piece chrome-plated wheels being phased out in 1972 (except that all the models made in Hong Kong had the one-piece wheel design). The two-piece wheels were used until 1977, while newer one-piece wheels of various styles have been adopted since 1976, and are still used today. The most common design is a five-spoke chrome on black plastic form that appears to have five (four before 2007) 'studs' around the edge of the wheel (It is commonly referred to as the 4/5 studded wheel). This design has even been continued with the newer vehicles made in Vietnam. Another common style is a black plastic wheel with a single chrome ring and no other outstanding detail (This is also refers to the racing wheels) . Later Tomicas have a slightly redesigned wheel design, with the 'studs' slightly smaller. Some SUVs (e.g. Nissan X-Trail, Mitsubishi Pajero) have a 4-spoke chrome with grooves on the outside.  Other Series  = Long Tomica = New long vehicles from the Tomica regular line are a bit smaller than the original Long Tomicas. Longer buses and semi-trailer trucks were models not suitable for the regular small boxes, so Tomy also started the \\"Long Tomica\\" series in 1977. Castings such as trucks, articulated buses or Shinkansen trains were produced as single models until 1993. However, some of these long models still appeared in gift sets after 1993, such as the JAL Airport Vehicles Set. Many of these were specifically for foreign markets, like the Trathen's Skyliner bus which made the Plymouth to London trek in the U.K. (Rixon 2005, 102). Beginning in 2009, Tomy produces newer versions of \\"Long Tomica\\", such as the newest Shinkansen trains or large semi trailer trucks, as part of the regular series under model numbers 121 to 140.

The line started with the model M-60 U.S. Army Medium Tank, and later on, models such as the U.S. M-60A-1E-1, the German TIGER-I, the Japanese Type 61 and the Russian SU-85 were produced. There were two types of Combat Tomica but they both contained exactly the same models. The first one was like regular Tomica models; the models came in a paper box, there were some soldier figures for decoration and a set of wheels because the tracks were fixed and did not actually function. The second type was the metal model kits that required manual assembly. These came in larger boxes inside containing the parts for assembly. Production of the Combat Tomicas lasted only a few years, due to high costs. However, Tomy continued producing military vehicles such as rocket launcher trucks, troop trucks, and jeeps, for its regular \\"3-inch\\" line-up. = Tomica Dandy = Tomica Dandy Nissan Bluebird in 1/35, one of the larger scale. Most cars were 1/43. Tomica Dandy cars are larger - about 1:43 scale and were produced from 1972 until 1993. At first they were all Japanese domestic models, but similar to the common Tomicas, the Dandy line also began to offer foreign brand vehicles in 1977 (for example, a Lotus Europa). The numbering system was changed in 1984 based on the nature of the vehicles (e.g. emergency, police, or foreign models). In 2001, Tomy reissued six Tomica Dandy models in limited quantities. Dandys were diecast metal and most also had metal bases. Wheels looked authentic, but were hard black plastic and not rubber, which was normal for 1:43 diecast cars in the 1980s. Some Dandy cars had special features like the Mazda Savanna with \\"pop-up\\" headlights operated from a lever inside the car (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, 77). Packaging colors varied and some were promotional models, but commonly, boxes were blue or red showing a perforated license plate shape with 'Dandy' written on the plate. Tomica Dandy castings have also been used in gift sets and the Limited S Series, but these models have the \\"Dandy\\" name on their base plates removed. = Motorized Tomica = B/O Tomica came in a picture box while the later Motor Tomica came in a window box. Tomy started producing motorized cars in the late 1970s beginning with the Power Tomica series. This series did not last long. In 1992, it released a new series called B/O Tomica (stands for battery-operated Tomica). This series was renamed Motor Tomica in 1997. They were produced and sold as single models until 2003. All the B/O Tomica are made in Japan, while all the Motor Tomica (including the Animated Motor Tomica) are made in China. To fit on the motorized base, these castings often have altered scales. In general, sport utility vehicles appear in their proper scales, saloons appear a bit bulky, and buses and lorries are disproportionately short. In 2005, a new series for motorized Tomica was released containing generic vehicles such as a police patrol car. This late series targets toddlers and is made of ABS plastic.

In the year 2002, Tomy again produced pullback models. = Sound and Light Tomica = Left: Sound Tomica from 1992. Right: Technology Tomica from 2011. From time to time, Tomy produces shorter runs of cars with sound or light or both, based on castings from the regular series. The first of such series was the Sound Tomica, introduced in 1992. These cars have both sound and light. Upon pressing one set of wheels, the sound and light are activated for a short time. The Siren Tomica series from 1996 replaced Sound Tomica. These are basically the same design except the batteries can be taken out and replaced. In 2000, Tomy came out with the Chat Tomica line. These cars do not have light, but depending on the model, upon activation, \\"[t]hree types of recorded clips will be played (including the sound of sirens, voices and cries of animals).\\" (T3: Sound of Tomicas 2008). Conversely, the Technology Tomica cars introduced in 2010 only have lights. What is special is that they do not require batteries. Rolling the cars produces the electricity to power the lights. This line also represents the only made-in-Thailand Tomica in existence to date. Most recently, Tomy has released the Tomica 4D line. These cars have engine sounds and vibrations.

They are marketed as the Tomica Limited Vintage Tomytec series and are mostly 1950s and 1960s classic Japanese vehicles such as the Honda S800, Nissan Cedric, Prince Gloria and Toyopet Crown. More details are evident on these compared to the regular Tomica models or even the Tomica Limited models. In 2006 the Tomica Limited Vintage - Neo [TLV-N] line was created and currently includes vehicles from the 1970s and 1980s. As with the Limited Vintage series, the focus of the Limited Vintage - Neo series is on adult collectors. These models have a high level of realism, with more attention to details such as wheels, tires, paint, trim and emblems versus functions like opening parts or moving features but still has the suspension of the basic Tomica models. All the models are a consistent scale of 1/64 (Tomica Fan Club). The Tomica Limited Vintage Neo line focuses mostly on Japanese street cars manufactured in the late 1970s and onwards, but movie and TV drama vehicles and special race cars have also been introduced. Examples are cars from 80s police dramas such as Seibu Keisatsu and Abunai Deka or the JGTC Super Silhouette Skyline. Export versions of cars are also included, such as an American Datsun 510 instead of a Japanese Nissan Bluebird. = Special Character Cars = A Snoopy family car and a Mickey Mouse car based on regular Tomica Datsun No.1 In the early years, Tomy produced cars with famous characters sitting on them, using the same castings from the regular Tomica line. The first of such was the Snoopy character cars from the 1970s. Tomy did not market and distribute these cars. Rather, they produced these for Aviva, who sold the toy under the Aviva brand name. In the early 1980s Tomy produced models with Muppet characters. Also in the 1980s, Tomy started producing vehicles with Disney characters under the Putica Disney series name. This popular series was made until the late 1990s and was also re-issued in the original style boxes sometime during the 2000s. Circa 1990s, when Tomy created a cartoon called \\"Tomica Rescue\\", it started another series using regular Tomica models and some Matchbox models with some add-ons such as cannons, armors and water hoses. In 1996, a series specially designed for the Japanese comic or cartoon \\"Bakuso Kyodai Let's & Go !!\\" (爆走兄弟レッツ&ゴー) was initiated. Then came the \\"Mach Go Go Go\\" (\\"マッハＧｏＧｏＧｏ\\", localized as \\"Speed Racer\\" in the West) series in 1998. In 2002 a series called Magnum Rescue was launched, and designed very much like today's Tomica Hyper Series. Unfortunately, due to safety issues, the Magnum Rescue Police Cruiser was recalled soon after its release. In 2005, to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the renowned Thomas and Friends, Tomy started a Thomas the Tank Engine series. In recent years, Tomy has greatly expanded their specialized character Tomica series. Offerings include \\"Tomica Hyper Series\\", the Cars (Disney/Pixar animation) series, Pokémon, Ridge Racer, the Disney Motors series, and racing anime and manga, such as Initial D and Circuit no Ōkami.

For example, this occurs with the rubber track on excavator and bulldozer models bulldozer where the tracks break from aging (mostly on the 'made in Japan' ones).

He is introduced in the second season episode \\"Adrift\\" as one of the plane-crash survivors from the plane's tail section. Flashbacks reveal that he became the leader of a gang of guerrillas to save his brother when he still lived in Nigeria. He assumed his brother's identity and became a priest after his brother was killed in a botched drug smuggle; Eko killed two guerrillas in defense, was ostracized, and left Nigeria to become a priest in Australia. After investigating the alleged miracle of a girl who came back to life after drowning in Australia in 2004, Eko boarded Oceanic Airlines Flight 815. This plane crashed and left Eko, along with a few other survivors, on a deserted island. Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse were fans of Akinnuoye-Agbaje's work on HBO's Oz, and asked him to portray the character. Although Akinnuoye-Agbaje was not initially interested in joining the cast, he was persuaded by Cuse and Lindelof, but for a shorter period than they had in mind. Akinnuoye-Agbaje had a lot of influence on his character, changing the character's name and making adjustments to Eko's personality. After appearing on the show for one season, Akinnuoye-Agbaje asked Cuse and Lindelof to write his character out of the show because he did not feel at home in Hawaii. They decided a \\"shocking and emotional death\\" would be the best way for the character to depart: after seeing his brother on the island, Eko chases him until he stumbles upon the smoke monster, which brutally murders him. Mr. Eko received many positive responses from critics and fans, who were disappointed that the character was killed after one season. A toy figure of Mr. Eko was included in a second series of Lost toy figures distributed by McFarlane Toys. Appearances =Prior to the crash= Originally from Nigeria, Mr. Eko was born on January 31, 1968. He grew up always looking after his younger brother, Yemi (Adetokumboh M'Cormack), with whom he lived in a small village. As revealed in \\"The 23rd Psalm\\", one day, when Eko is playing with the local children, a gang of guerrillas raids the village in search of young recruits. When Yemi refuses to shoot an elderly man, Eko steps in and shoots him himself, sparing Yemi from the same fate. Impressed by his actions, the guerrillas take Eko away with them and draw him away from his religious lifestyle and into the criminal life, where Eko adopted the title \\"Mr.\\" He grows up to be a fearless drug lord and a vicious leader of a guerrilla group, while his brother becomes an honoured priest. Years after his abduction, Eko returns to his home village to ask Yemi to help him smuggle heroin, which Eko has hidden in a large number of Virgin Mary statues and intends to fly out of the country. Yemi refuses until Eko threatens his associates will burn the church down if he does not sign documents that allow him and his henchmen to appear as priests. As Eko and his men assemble at the airfield on the day the shipment is ready to be smuggled, it is revealed Yemi has tipped off the military and now tries to convince Eko not to go through with his plans. When the military arrives, Yemi is killed in the ensuing gun battle and Eko is kicked off the plane. After the plane leaves, Eko is mistaken for Yemi and released back to his village. Feeling guilty over Yemi's death, Eko assumes his role as the village priest. One day, Eko encounters a gang of guerrillas who made a deal with Yemi: they'll take 80% of the vaccines delivered to the village in exchange for the village's safety. Soon afterward, the guerrillas arrive at the church and attempt to cut off Eko's hands. However, Eko fights back and kills them, much to the shock of the village. The church is thus boarded up and Eko is ostracized until he leaves for London. After leaving England, Eko assumes his brother's identity, serving as a priest in Australia under the name Father Tunde. A monsignor asks him to investigate a reported miracle of a young lady who has come back to life after drowning. The girl's father, Richard Malkin, dismisses the miracle as an act of incompetence by the undertaker, claiming the girl was suffering from severe hypothermia and the doctor misdiagnosed her as a result. Eko soon prepares to board Oceanic Airlines Flight 815; shortly after buying a ticket, he encounters the girl whom the investigation is about. She tells Eko she saw Yemi as she was \\"between places\\", and his brother had a message for him to have faith. =After the crash= After the crash, Eko lands with the tail- section survivors in the ocean, a short distance from the beach. On the group's first night on the island, the Others kidnap a few of the survivors. Eko kills two of them while resisting a kidnap attempt; feeling guilty, Eko remains mute for the following forty days. In \\"Adrift\\", Eko beats Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau) unconscious when they arrive on their beach and hauls them into a pit. When their innocence is proven, Eko and the tail-section survivors head to the camp of the other fuselage survivors. After their arrival in \\"What Kate Did\\", John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) shows Eko an orientation video from the DHARMA Initiative. Eko watches it and fits in with the remaining fuselage survivors. In \\"The 23rd Psalm\\", Eko discovers a Virgin Mary statue in Charlie Pace's (Dominic Monaghan) possession and he demands to be taken to the Beechcraft where it came from, knowing his brother's body is there. Eko and Charlie decide to burn the plane along with all the heroin-filled statues. On his fiftieth day on the island, Eko baptizes baby Aaron and his mother Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin). As he discovers the survivors hold one of the others named \\"Henry Gale\\" (Michael Emerson) captured in the Swan hatch, he requests to speak to him. Eko confesses to him about killing two people on the first night of the crash and expresses his condolences before leaving. Following his confession, Eko starts building a church down the beach with Charlie's help. However, after Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez) and Yemi tell him to help Locke in a dream in \\"?\\", Eko abandons the church and ventures into the jungle with Locke, claiming to hunt down the escaped \\"Henry Gale\\". Eko manages to coax Locke into taking him to the \\"?\\" he drew on a map, resulting in the discovery of the Pearl station. After watching the station's orientation video, Eko vows to continue pushing the button in the hatch, despite Locke's protests. In the season 2 finale \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\", Locke and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) initiate a lockdown and lock Eko out of the computer room. Desperate not to let the timer run out, Eko goes to the stash of dynamite from the Black Rock, a ship which wrecked on the island before the plane. Eko's attempt to blow open the blast door has no effect except to knock him unconscious, and he is thus unable to prevent the timer's reaching zero. As a result, the station implodes. Although Eko survives the implosion, he is dragged away by a polar bear. Locke and Charlie later rescue him and pull him to safety. In \\"The Cost of Living\\", Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent, telling him he needs to confess before finding his tent is on fire. Searching for Yemi, he soon decides to follow Locke, Desmond, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro) to the Pearl station. While waiting outside, he sees Yemi again, and follows the apparition to give his confession. Upon learning it is merely a deception, Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle, where he confronts the \\"Monster\\". After being thrown about by the Monster, Eko is finally thrown to the ground. Fatally wounded, he whispers \\"I saw the Devil\\" to Locke before dying, although Locke, for whatever reason, decides to tell Sayid he said, \\"We're next.\\" As he dies, we see an image of Eko and Yemi as happy children, walking into the distance. In one of the flashforwards in the final episode of the fourth season, Hurley is seen sitting at a table with a chessboard on it across from a seemingly empty seat. Before he leaves, Hurley says: \\"Checkmate, Mr. Eko.\\" Personality When creating the character, the producers envisioned Mr. Eko as \\"the one character who comes to terms with living on the island, and not being consumed with trying to get off\\". Being introduced as a \\"tailie\\", a person on the tail section of the plane, Eko is a mysterious and complex character. MSNBC said the character is \\"always fighting a battle, an internal struggle as to whether the life he led was worthy of pride or shame\\". Portrayer Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained Mr. Eko's dedication to pushing the button in the hatch with seeing the hatch as the answer to the mystery of life. Described as a \\"natural leader\\", Mr. Eko is a \\"strong, silent type, a man of few words\\". Jon Bonné of MSNBC said, he is \\"a dude you don't mess with\\". When Akinnuoye-Agbaje was at a bank in Hawaii, a fan said his character was a criminal pretending to be a priest, to which Akinnuoye-Agbaje replied: \\"No, actually, I'm a priest pretending to be a criminal\\". Development Lance Reddick was the producers' initial choice to play the character but was unavailable as he was filming The Wire. The character of Mr. Eko was created to explore the spiritual element of the show, and to add an African character, which the producers thought would provide \\"cultural variety\\" to the cast. Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse's first choice for the actor to portray Eko was Lance Reddick, after they had seen him as Cedric Daniels on HBO's The Wire. However, after it was made clear Reddick was unavailable due to the filming schedule of The Wire,Jensen, Jeff, (August 29, 2007) \\"Lost: Five Fresh Faces\\", Entertainment Weekly. Retrieved on April 9, 2009. Cuse and Lindelof decided to contact Akinnuoye-Agbaje, because they were big fans of his work on the HBO prison drama Oz. At the time, Akinnuoye-Agbaje was filming Get Rich or Die Tryin' and, being unfamiliar with Lost, had no intention of joining the cast. While the producers succeeded in persuading Akinnuoye-Agbaje to take the role, he did not want to make a long-term commitment to the show and was therefore only hired for a short period of time. Akinnuoye-Agbaje accepted the part mostly because it was an opportunity to play a character with a different faith than his Buddhism, and because he enjoyed the idea of being on a deserted island (he had lived on a deserted island four years prior to being cast on the show). Two weeks after he was hired, Akinnuoye-Agbaje moved to Oahu, Hawaii, where filming took place. While Mr. Eko was created as a more passive character, the idea changed when the producers first saw Akinnuoye-Agbaje play the character. Akinnuoye-Agbaje explained: \\"once they saw me on the screen without a shirt, all 6 foot 2 and using a stick beating three guys up, they knew this guy wasn't going to be just a passive priest\\". Eventually, Cuse and Lindelof decided to combine their original idea for the character with Akinnuoye-Agbaje's character on Oz. Originally, the character was named \\"Emeka\\", and later \\"Omecca\\", but after Akinnuoye-Agbaje was cast, the name was changed to \\"Eko\\", in order to be consistent with Akinnuoye- Agbaje's own Nigerian tribal lineage. Eko refers to the City of Legos (Lagos) in Nigeria, coming from Eleko, Lord of Lagos. Adding \\"Mr.\\" in front of the character's name was also a suggestion made by Akinnuoye-Agbaje. While at first Cuse and Lindelof thought this was \\"the silliest thing in the world\\", they changed their minds after repeating the name a few times, realizing there \\"was something really cool about it\\". The character first appeared in \\"Adrift\\", where he was only shown briefly, knocking down three of the show's main characters with a stick. Akinnuoye-Agbaje was given the stick and told to \\"knock those three guys out\\". Akinnuoye-Agbaje felt \\"there's no better way to make an entrance\\". The religious scripture on the stick was a suggestion of Akinnuoye-Agbaje. After he had been on the show for one season, Akinnuoye- Agbaje felt uncomfortable living in Hawaii and wanted to return to his residence in London, England. He discussed Mr. Eko's departure with Lindelof and Cuse, and the three decided the character would die somewhere in the first six episodes of the third season. They also found a \\"shocking and emotional death\\" would be the best way to write the character off the show. Akinnuoye- Agbaje felt Eko's death in \\"The Cost of Living\\" made the character \\"complete\\", commenting: \\"The Cost of Living\\" was \\"such a well-written episode that I knew I would be able to sew him up in a season\\", although Cuse later said he would have preferred the character to remain on the show a little longer. In 2008, Cuse and Lindelof made hints there were possibilities of the character's returning. However, despite Akinnuoye-Agbaje's wishes to return for the sixth season, the producers stated he would not be returning. The actor was eventually offered a guest role in the series finale, but turned it down due to salary disagreements. Reception Overall, the character was positively received. The first week he was on the show, Akinnuoye-Agbaje received a lot of fanmail, much to his surprise. Craig Berman of MSNBC called Mr. Eko \\"one of the most creatively complex characters on the island\\". The Los Angeles Times depicted him as \\"the island's favorite 'tailie'\\". IGN named him the third best character from the first three seasons of Lost, behind Hurley and Locke.Carabott, Chris & Goldman, Eric & Iverson, Dan & Moriarty, Colin & Zoromski, Brian, (February 9, 2007) \\"Top 10 Lost Characters,\\" IGN. Retrieved on 2009-04-19. Akinnuoye-Agbaje's performance was praised by critics; Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle said he was \\"probably the best actor in the cast\\". In 2006, Akinnuoye-Agbaje shared the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series with the cast of Lost; they were also named \\"Entertainers of the Year\\" by Entertainment Weekly. He was also nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor on Television in 2005, but lost the award to Masi Oka of Heroes. Generally, critics and fans were disappointed Mr. Eko was killed after being on the show for only one season. Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko \\"the best character of the show\\", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated \\"I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting was up there with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. I guess he was the sacrifice the island demanded\\". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death \\"sucked hard, and loud, and long\\". IGN listed Eko's death as number one on its list of \\"Top 10 Lost Deaths\\".

Originally on the Via Appia in Bovillae, now in the British Museum. Bovillae was an ancient town in Lazio, central Italy, currently part of Frattocchie frazione in the municipality of Marino. Overview Bovillae was a station on the Via Appia (which in 293 BC was already paved up to this point), located c. south-east of Rome. It was a colony of Alba Longa, and appears as one of the thirty cities of the Latin league. After the destruction of Alba Longa in 658 BC the sacra were, it was held, transferred to Bovillae, including the cult of Vesta (in inscriptions virgines Vestales Albanae are mentioned, and the inhabitants of Bovillae are always spoken of as Albani Longani Bovillenses) and that of the gens Iulia. The existence of this hereditary worship led to an increase in its importance when the Julian house rose to the highest power in the state. The horsemen met Augustus's dead body at Bovillae on its way to Rome, and in 16 AD the shrine of the family worship was dedicated anewIt is not likely that any remains of it now exist . and yearly games in the circus instituted, probably under the charge of the sodales Augustales, whose official calendar has been found here. Bovillae appears as the scene of the quarrel between Milo and Clodius, in which the latter, whose villa lay above the town on the left of the Via Appia, was killed. The site is not naturally strong, and remains of early fortifications cannot be traced. It may be that Bovillae took the place of Alba Longa as a local centre after the destruction of the latter by Rome, which would explain the deliberate choice of a strategically weak position. Remains of the circus built there by Tiberius in 14 AD in honor of Augustus can still be seen at (use satellite image sites e.g. Wikimapia), and of an octagonal mausoleum, on the edge of the Via Appia. There were once also a theatre and a schola actorum (\\"actor's school\\"), identified by an inscription found in the neighbourhood, and, probably, a temples dedicated to Veiovis, a divinity associated to the gens Iulia. Remains of a side-road leading off from the nearby Appian Way were unearthed during excavation work to build a McDonalds restaurant in 2014. During the excavation a total of four male skeletons were also discovered. The restaurant itself now houses a view of a 150-foot stretch of 2,000-year-old cobbled street beneath a glass walkway. It's also possible to go into the excavated area from a separate entrance.

Fictional character biography =Frank Payne= Frank Payne was an agent of the international espionage organization S.H.I.E.L.D., and the father of an adult daughter, Mia. When S.H.I.E.L.D. needed a costumed \\"supervillain\\" to go undercover in the criminal organization called the Corporation, Frank was given a snake-themed costume and a pair of wrist-mounted electrified metal coils. Using the false identity of \\"Frank Schlicting\\" from Racine, Wisconsin, and the codename of \\"Constrictor\\", he infiltrated the group, only to suffer a nervous breakdown and become a career criminal in earnest. As a result of his defection, S.H.I.E.L.D. allowed his daughter to believe that he had died. As the Constrictor, \\"Schlicting\\" debuted in combat against the Hulk, while attempting to assassinate the Hulk's friend Jim Wilson on behalf of the Corporation.Incredible Hulk #212. Marvel Comics. The Corporation next sent him to assassinate Captain America; the Constrictor was trapped in a cave-in of S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, and was freed by Captain America.Captain America #228. Marvel Comics. The Constrictor would remain an independent mercenary, criminal, and assassin after the dissolution of the Corporation. He next battled Iron Man as a member of Justin Hammer's criminal army.Iron Man #127. Marvel Comics. He next teamed with Sabretooth to safeguard a stolen jade tiger statuette, and battled Power Man and the Daughters of the Dragon.Power Man and Iron Fist #66. Marvel Comics. He teamed with Sabretooth again to help Sabretooth get revenge on Misty Knight.Power Man and Iron Fist #78. Marvel Comics. They fought Iron Fist, Power Man, El Aguila, and Misty Knight.Power Man and Iron Fist #84. Marvel Comics. Working for the Viper, he battled Captain America and Nomad. He wound up turning against the Viper.Captain America #281-283. Marvel Comics. He next joined with other criminals in an attempt to assassinate the hospitalized Thing.Marvel-Two-in-One #96. Marvel Comics. Constrictor was also invited to join the Serpent Society, which he turned down and walked out after the first meeting. He subsequently tried to turn them over to the Avengers, and Anaconda later exacted revenge on him. While in the hospital recuperating from the beating, he was nearly killed by the Scourge of the Underworld disguised as a nurse, but was saved by Captain America.Captain America #310-311. Marvel Comics. Constrictor eventually took an assignment to kill the Beast in Belgium by Commander Courage who was impersonating the Red Ghost. Finding out that he had been set up, Constrictor teamed up with Beast to defeat Commander Courage.Marvel Comics Presents vol. 1 #85-92. Marvel Comics. He later had a showdown with his common-law stepfather McAvey, who had murdered his mother.Marvel Comics Presents #74. Marvel Comics. Constrictor has battled numerous heroes over the years, including repeated encounters with Captain America, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Spider-Man, the Thing and even the short-lived character NFL SuperPro. Although Luke Cage and Nick Fury eventually uncovered Payne's former identity, he chose to retain the Schlicting alias and to allow his daughter to believe that her father was dead. During the Acts of Vengeance, Constrictor was one of the many villains that attacked the Fantastic Four. Constrictor appeared as a supporting character in Deadpool wherein he and Titania moved in with him as his roommates. During their uncomfortable living situation, Constrictor was convinced that Titania was actually a man. It would turn out that he was right that she was not what she seemed; but not about her gender as Titania was revealed to actually be the mutant shapeshifter and Deadpool's former lover, Copycat. He was later found to be under the employment of Justin Hammer. When cutbacks forced his supervisor to lay him off, he responded by brutally attacking him. He did join the seventh incarnation of the Masters of Evil led by Crimson Cowl. During the Deadpool story arc, it was also revealed that Constrictor had been part of a very short-lived rendition of the Wizard's Frightful Four. At one point he was one of the many mercenaries hired to kill Alex Hayden, who was at this time thought to be Wade Wilson. He works with many unnamed mercs and some notable ones, including Crossfire. In the story it was stated that Wilson was a hard-ass, so Hayden could not be Deadpool. Hayden then broke Constrictor's nose. The Constrictor was later seen in the same issue being used, or rather his vibranium coils were used, to drag the Rhino into a river. Somehow both escaped.Agent X #6 (Feb. 2003). Marvel Comics. After a severe beating from Hercules, the Constrictor was awarded several million dollars in a lawsuit. Nighthawk, rich himself, convinces the Constrictor that with all his money there was no need to be a criminal anymore, and he has apparently turned over a new leaf and decided to be a hero. He is currently under the employment of S.H.I.E.L.D. as a member of the new Six-Pack. He was most recently seen at an all-superhuman charity poker tournament hosted by the Thing (who also had a hand in the Constrictor's apparent reformation), where Hercules regains at least a large portion of the money he lost to the Constrictor in a non-tournament side game. Constrictor plays a small role in the \\"Secret War\\" crossover event. The Constrictor was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who have registered as part of the 50-State Initiative and joined Camp Hammond's staff.Avengers: The Initiative #1 The Constrictor was later revealed to be part of the Shadow Initiative, a black ops version of the Initiative under the command of Henry Gyrich.Avengers: The Initiative #4 (2007). Marvel Comics. He travels with Trauma and Mutant Zero, two other members of the group, into Madison Square Garden; they rescue Initiative recruits from the invading alien forces called the Warbound.Avengers: The Initiative #5 (2007). Marvel Comics. Constrictor saved Gyrich from the clone of MVP known as \\"KIA\\", however KIA severed Constrictor's forearms in retaliation. Constrictor was quickly ferried away to safety by fellow team member Bengal.Avengers: The Initiative #10. Marvel Comics. He was given bionic hands which function like his coils, and was also presented with a Purple Heart for his valiant efforts.Avengers: The Initiative #12. Marvel Comics. Following a supervillain ambush outside of Camp Hammond, student hero Butterball washed out the camp, he and fellow instructor Taskmaster give Schaub a photo of himself standing triumphant over the defeated 'villains' as a reward for his efforts.Avengers: The Initiative #13.

They decide to assassinate Queen Veranke, but the attempt fails and they are taken captive.Avengers: the Initiative #17. Marvel Comics. During a conflict with the initiative and some terrorists as seen in the \\"Dark Reign,\\" Constrictor helps the Women Warriors, one of the official government hero teams. He stops an out-of-control passenger plane, saving many lives, including that of the hero Diamondback. Constrictor is visibly distressed as civilians thank him for his heroic actions. Soon after, he and Diamondback begin a romantic relationship.Avengers: The Initiative #29. Marvel Comics. Frank later discovers that Diamondback is secretly working for Gauntlet's \\"Avengers Resistance\\".Avengers: The Initiative #30. Marvel Comics. He keeps her secret despite knowing the danger this involves for them both; mainly the Initiative head, Taskmaster, would kill them both.Avengers: The Initiative #31. Marvel Comics. During the Siege of Asgard, Constrictor becomes buried under a pile of falling rubble. Taskmaster digs him out and Constrictor sees Diamondback running towards Captain America. Wrongfully assuming that she has reconciled with and returned to her former lover, Constrictor sorrowfully joins Taskmaster in fleeing the battlefield. The two also begin working as mercenaries and partners in crime.Avengers: The Initiative #35. Marvel Comics. Constrictor was later recruited by Max Fury to join the Shadow Council's incarnation of the Masters of Evil.Secret Avengers #29. Marvel Comics. As part of the \\"Marvel NOW!\\" in the pages of Avengers Arena, a flashback experienced by Arcade showed that he had previously acquired the ownership of a bar in Bagalia called the Hole where he catches Constrictor (who previously attended Arcade's birthday party and made fun of him) robbing it. Arcade defeated Constrictor by crushing him with a large hammer-like trap.Avengers Arena #7. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Infinity\\"storyline, Constrictor is among the villains recruited by Spymaster to help him attack the almost-defenseless Stark Tower.Infinity: Heist #1. Marvel Comics. In the pages of Avengers Undercover, Constrictor was with the Masters of Evil when Baron Helmut Zemo became the new leader following the death of Max Fury. Constrictor becomes the bodyguard of Baron Helmut Zemo.Avengers Undercover #1. Marvel Comics. Constrictor is shown to live in a building called the Snakepit in Bagalia which is also the headquarters of the Young Masters.Avengers Undercover #5. Marvel Comics. Frank Payne later retired from crime and moved in with Rachael Leighton. When it was discovered that Frank has a terminal illness, Rachael became Diamondback again and joined Serpent Solutions in order to get the money to help with his medical treatment.Captain America: Sam Wilson #5. Marvel Comics. It was later revealed that Frank Payne had died.Iron Fist #75. Marvel Comics. =Frank Payne's son= When Frank Payne had a brief relationship with Sandy and later left him, Sandy gave birth to a son who hated his father for his abandonment. After Frank Payne died, he left his battlesuit for his son in his will and he became the new Constrictor. The son considered this as a way to get back at his late father. Constrictor later went to the restaurant Herbie's and attended a supervillain meeting held by Wizard who informed them that Victor von Doom has gone straight. The meeting was crashed by Doctor Doom in his version of the Iron Man armor.Infamous Iron Man #7. Marvel Comics. Liwei later hired Constrictor to break into Danny Rand's apartment so that he can obtain for Chosin the Book of the Iron Fist.Iron Fist #73. Marvel Comics. When Chosin refused to pay Constrictor double and planned to have him tortured, Constrictor summoned the Serpent Society. The fight was crashed by Iron Fist and Sabretooth.Iron Fist #74. Marvel Comics. Constrictor was poisoned by Rat of 12 Plagues as Chosin starts to get his hands on the Book of the Iron Fist. To honor Frank Payne, Sabretooth took Constrictor to the hospital. During the \\"Search for Tony Stark\\" arc, Constrictor later joined up with Hood's crime syndicate where they attacked Victor von Doom at Castle Doom.Invincible Iron Man #597. Marvel Comics. In a prelude to the \\"Hunted\\" storyline, Constrictor is among the animal-themed characters that are captured by Kraven the Hunter, Taskmaster, and Black Ant for the upcoming Great Hunt that is sponsored by Arcade's company Arcade Industries. He was watching the fight between Spider-Man and Scorpion until the Hunter-Bots created by Arcade Industries arrive.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #17. Marvel Comics. When the Great Hunt begins, Constrictor is attacked by one of the Hunter-Bots.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #18. Marvel Comics. Surviving the attack, Constrictor and the surviving animal-themed characters met up with Vulture.Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 5 #19. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Constrictor's primary weapon is a pair of cybernetically-controlled, electrified, prehensile, wrist-mounted metal coils provided by Justin Hammer. The coils eject and retract from special appliances running from shoulder to wrist. These cables are able to extend to a maximum length of and can be used as whips, capable of rending steel or lesser metals; or as bonds, capable of entwining an object or human being and constricting. The previous sets of coils were made from an adamantium alloy, then from vibranium. The adamantium coils were traded to Gambit in exchange for a favor and are then subsequently used by Mister Sinister to reinforce an ailing Sabretooth's skeleton.Gambit Vol. 3 #11. Marvel Comics. The strength of the coils varies based on their construction, but the adamantium coils were powerful enough to lift and even temporarily restrain the Hulk.The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #212 (Jun, 1968). Marvel Comics. The vibranium coils have a contact-based aura that suppresses sound: while the coils are wrapped around a target's throat, the victim's voice cannot be heard.Gambit Vol. 3 #16-17. Marvel Comics. The Constrictor's costume is lightly armored with partial bulletproofing around the chest and head area and the entire costume is electrically-insulated, covering his entire body except for his lower face and chin. Although the Constrictor is a skilled unarmed combatant and street fighter, he usually relies exclusively on his coils in a fight. After his encounter with KIA, Constrictor is implanted with cybernetic arms, the fingers of which duplicate the abilities of his old coils.Avengers: The Initiative #12. Marvel Comics. His forearms still had the capacity to discharge coils out the wrist like previous.Avengers: The Initiative #24-29. Marvel Comics. Other versions An alternative version of Constrictor appeared in JLA/Avengers #4 (2003), part of the Marvel/DC crossover storyline, as part of Krona's supervillain army.

(three box) and station wagon (two box) from the same model range. (two-box) superimposed over the station wagon (two-box) from the same model range—in this case, both with a D-pillar. Pillars are the vertical or near vertical supports of a car's window area or greenhouse—designated respectively as the A, B, C or (in larger cars) D-pillar, moving from front to rear, in profile view. The consistent alphabetical designation of a car's pillars provides a common reference for design discussion and critical communication. As an example, rescue teams employ pillar nomenclature to facilitate communication when cutting wrecked vehicles, as when using the jaws of life. The B pillars are sometimes referred to as \\"posts\\" (two-door or four- door post sedan). Design In the case of the B (or center) pillar on four- door sedans, the pillar is typically a closed steel structure welded at the bottom to the car's rocker panel and floorpan, as well as on the top to the roof rail or panel. This pillar provides structural support for the vehicle's roof panel and is designed for latching the front door and mounting the hinges for the rear doors. As the most costly body components to develop or re-tool, a vehicle's roof and door design are a major factor in meeting safety and crash standards. Some designs employ slimmer, chamfered windscreen pillars, A pillars, to help improve driver vision (thus reducing blind spots) through the use of stronger alloy steel in these components. As \\"perhaps the most complex of all the structures on the vehicle\\", the center or B-pillar may be a multi- layered assembly of various lengths and strengths. Closed vehicles without a B-pillar are widely called hardtops and have been available in two or four- door body styles, in sedans, coupes and wagons. Designs without a center or \\"B\\" pillar for roof support behind the front doors offer increased occupant visibility, while in turn requiring underbody strengthening to maintain structural rigidity. In the early 1970s, General Motors broadened their definition of \\"hardtop\\" to include models with a B-pillar although: \\"up to then, everybody thought a hardtop was a car without a center pillar.\\" Pillars are implied, whether they exist or not; where a design's greenhouse features a break between windows or doors without vertical support at that position, the non-existent pillar is \\"skipped\\" when naming the other pillars. Thus a two- door hardtop or a three box designed coupé could have its rearmost pillar called the C-pillar even in the absence of a B-pillar. Conversely additional doors, such as on limousines, will create additional B-pillars; the B-pillars are then numbered, B1, B2, and so forth. In addition to the pillar nomenclature derived from viewing an automobile in profile, some older cars have a two-part windshield or a split rear window, with the two halves separated by a pillar. Posts for quarter windows (a smaller window typically between the front window and the windshield) are not considered a named pillar.

This degree in education often includes the following majors: curriculum and instruction, counseling, school psychology, and administration. It is often conferred for educators advancing in their field. Similar degrees (providing qualifications for similar careers) include the Master of Arts in Education (M.A.Ed. or M.A.E.) and the Master of Science in Education (M.S.Ed. or M.S.E.). Categories of study Typical programs branch into one of several categories: =Curriculum and instruction/curriculum and teaching= This is typically the area to advance knowledge of, and professional practice in, teaching and learning. Coursework in this field generally focuses on teaching, public service, and scholarship. Often at the master's level, curriculum and instruction majors (or curriculum and teaching at some schools) participate in educational research. This major is designed often for preparation to enter educational careers in schools, including classroom teaching. =Counselor education= This is typically the area where students study to become mental health professionals and work toward state licensure in mental health counseling. Typically state licensure requires 60 credit hours on a semester system. =School counseling= Candidates in school counseling typically study psychology, sociology, or social work as undergraduates. The master's degree, in addition to advanced courses of study, certifies an individual for employment as a school counselor. The Master of Counselling degree is also a common degree awarded in the field os school counseling. =Neuroscience interdisciplinary degree in education= Harvard University is notable for having an interdisciplinary neuroscience master's degree given as an M.Ed.Mind, Brain and Education The degree may have little instruction in teaching, with education referring to the learning process in humans versus the profession or institution of education. =Academic enrichment= This is typically the area where teachers are increasing their knowledge in their specific field or branching to another area within teaching. Examples are subject related, such as mathematics, social studies, or science, or tiers of school, such as elementary or high school. These teachers may be maintaining their certification or moving into a more marketable bracket. =Higher education and student affairs= Coursework in this area is aimed at the study of colleges and universities (higher education) or the administrative operations of higher education (student affairs) in specific programmatic elements. =Adult education= This focuses on the teaching of individuals 18 years or older. Some classes, such as adult literacy, high school diploma programs, English as a second language, parent education, and some job training classes, are sponsored by the government. Others, such as art and dance classes are fee-based. A B.Ed. degree or teacher's certificate is not usually a requirement for admission to an adult education program. =Special education= This degree designed to develop the capabilities and resources of educators of children who require special education (for example, students with autism spectrum disorders, students with intellectual disabilities). =Religious education= A terminal degree in preparation for teaching religious studies. =Media & technology= The purpose of the Master of Education (M.Ed.) in media & technology is to address the learner in the classroom and requires integration of instructional design principles into multimedia presentations with an emphasis in assessment. As classroom instructors across a range of academic disciplines integrate technology into their classrooms, there is an expanding need to have pedagogy and skills that drive this integration. Some will use this degree to design instructional technologies, and others will serve as technology facilitators in schools. =Prep for Ed.D. or Ph.D.= This is typically the area where teachers study for continuing work into the doctoral programs. Candidates in this area would study specific educational issues and often begin educational research in preparation for doctoral work. This is the broadest area of master's work for education. Use in North America Most states and provinces require a master's-level degree and the certificate that goes with that work to be hired for educational administration (principal, assistant or vice-principal, dean, consultant, etc.) or for licensure as a professional counselor (i.e., caseworker, therapist, community counselor, rehabilitation counselor). For licensure as a professional counselor, one needs a M.Ed., in counseling and an approved internship in which half the time of the internship must be in direct service to the client. The superintendent level in educational administration typically requires doctoral-level work to be completed. Another issue is that most states require continuing course work in order for counselors (especially since new CACREP requirements were implemented) to maintain their licensure. Admission into a master's-level program typically requires a bachelor's degree (BS, BA, or B.Ed.) in education or in the specific field in which the teacher would be teaching, and several years' experience in an educational or mental health setting.

Some writers have assigned to the reign of the emperor Justinian I, and others have treated as an apocryphal work of the 16th century. Endnotes: *Edition by E. Bocking, published at Berlin in 1829, under the title of Corpus Legum sive Brachylogus Juris Civilis *Heinrich Hermann Fitting, Über die Heimath und das Alter des sogenannten Brachylogus (Berlin, 1880) The earliest extant edition of this work was published at Lyon in 1549, under the title of Corpus Legum per modum Institutionum; and the title Brachylogus totius Juris Civilis appears for the first time in an edition published at Lyon in 1553\\\\. The origin of the work may be referred with great probability to the 12th century. There is internal evidence that it was composed subsequently to the reign of Louis le Débonnaire (778–840), as it contains a Lombard law of that king's, which forbids the testimony of a clerk to be received against a layman. On the other hand, its style and reasoning is far superior to that of the law writers of the 10th and 11th centuries; while the circumstance that the method of its author has not been in the slightest degree influenced by the school of the Gloss-writers (Glossatores) leads fairly to the conclusion that he wrote before that school became dominant at Bologna. Savigny, who traced the history of the Brachylogus with great care, is disposed to think that it is the work of Irnerius himself (Geschichte des röm. Rechts im Mittelalter). Its value is chiefly historical, as it furnishes evidence that a knowledge of Justinian's legislation was always maintained in northern Italy. The author of the work has adopted the Institutes of Justinian as the basis of it, and draws largely on the Digest, the Code and the Novels; while certain passages, evidently taken from the Sententiae Receptae of Julius Paulus, imply that the author was also acquainted with the Visigothic code of Roman law compiled by order of Alaric II.

It is the largest airport in the country and serves as the base of Air Zimbabwe. The airport is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe. It was originally built as Salisbury Airport. History Commissioned in 1956, and officially opened on 5 February 1957; Salisbury Airport cost £924,000 to build. According to the 1950 report of the Director of Civil Aviation, the city's original aerodrome, Belvedere Airport, had proved to be inadequate and had to be abandoned for the following reasons: * the runway was some 45° out of alignment, given that approaching aircraft had to enter through a gap in Warren Hills; * because of the skewed align, aircraft were forced to take-off over the city centre, which posed a real danger of accidents; * the growing number of high-rise buildings in the city, particularly Milton Building, posed a risk to aircraft; * Belvedere Airport had been built to accommodate the RAF Elementary Flying Training School, so the layout and design of the buildings were not particularly suitable for commercial aviation. A site therefore had to be found for the construction of an airport that would be safer and more suitable for commercial activities. The Southern Rhodesian government had appointed a Southern Rhodesia Aerodrome Board as early as January 1947, whose task was to advise the government on the selection, acquisition, construction and maintenance of government aerodromes and landing grounds in Southern Rhodesia. Later the same year, an Airfield Construction Unit was formed to undertake an extensive search for a suitable site for a national airport. In 1949, the government purchased Kentucky and Adair farms east of Salisbury (2,700 acres at a cost of £54,000) for the construction of the new airport. Also in 1949 the Minister of Mines and Transport set up an Airport Panel to co-ordinate the construction of the airport. The Panel comprised representatives of the interested government departments, the Municipality of Salisbury and Rhodesia Railways. In 1951 the government announced that the airport would be developed as a joint user aerodrome for both civil aviation and the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF). Construction of the airport began soon afterwards, and by September 1951, an 8,400 ft runway had been completed,enabling the first aircraft; an SRAF Anson- to land at the new airport. Originally, it was anticipated that the airport would be completed by 1954. It was, however, not completed until two years later, because the government ran out of funds in October 1952 and had to suspend the project temporarily. The new Salisbury Airport was finally commissioned on 1 July 1956 by the Government of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. The cost of building the airport was £924,000. Due to a decline in tourists to Zimbabwe, as a result of internal political conflicts since 2000; few major airlines use the airport as a result, with Emirates being the only non-African carrier. On 9 November 2017, Harare International Airport was officially renamed after the second President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, to Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, a decision that was announced earlier in September 2017 and sparked a controversy, as many Zimbabweans felt that too many places in the country had already been renamed after Mugabe.

Initially designated as train No. 51 (westbound) and train No. 52 (eastbound), it was the first diesel powered streamliner to operate out of Memphis, Tennessee, as well as the first streamliner service in the state of Arkansas. History The Choctaw Rocket followed a railway built by the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad between 1900 and 1902, informally known as the Choctaw Route. The CO&G; and its railways were purchased by the Rock Island railroad in 1902. A predecessor train, along the same route, and having the numbers #51/52, had the name, Chocktaw Limited in the 1930s.Rock Island timetables, February 1938 http://streamlinermemories.info/RI/RI38TT.pdf After an inaugural tour at cities along the route, the Choctaw Rocket entered regular service on November 17, 1940. Ad for the new Choctaw Rocket by the train's builder, Pullman-Standard. The original locomotive and car assignments for the two Choctaw Rocket sets of equipment included E6 locomotives 628 and 629, modernized heavyweight railway post office-baggage cars 702 and 703, coaches 350-Amarillo, and 351-Oklahoma City, sleepers 622-Seminole, and 623-Wewoka, and dining-parlor-observation cars 430-Memphis, and 431-Little Rock. The coaches, sleepers and observation cars were all streamlined cars ordered from Pullman Standard Manufacturing Company, specifically for use on the Choctaw Rocket.Randall, W. David. (1990). Official Pullman Standard Library, Vol. 8 - Rock Island. The Choctaw Rocket when inaugurated operated between Memphis, Tennessee and Amarillo, Texas. In January 1949 it was restructured to operate only between Memphis and Oklahoma City, with a connecting non-Rocket train between Oklahoma City and Amarillo. Contrary to some beliefs, the Choctaw Rocket never operated to Tucumcari, New Mexico although a companion Rock Island train on this route, the Memphis-Californian and the Cherokee, did operate to Tucumcari, New Mexico, connecting there with the Southern Pacific Railroad to continue service west to Los Angeles. The Railway Mail Service utilized the Choctaw Rocket for United States mail transportation, sorting and distribution along the route. One railway post office crew worked between Memphis, TN and McAlester, OK, while a second crew operated between McAlester and Amarillo. By 1952, the Choctaw Rocket had lost its Rocket designation, Rock Island's identification for the company's premier passenger trains, reflecting the route's downgrade to secondary train status. In August 1953, the conventional locomotive-pulled trains were replaced by self-propelled Budd rail diesel cars and the trains were renamed the Choctaw Rockette, a name which lasted until mid-1958. After the discontinuance of Western Pacific's rail diesel car trains 1-2 (Salt Lake City-San Francisco) in 1960, the Rock Island's Memphis - Amarillo RDC route held the distinction of being the longest such route in the United States.Duke, Donald. (1990). RDC, The Budd Rail Diesel Car. Declining patronage and a desire by the Rock Island to close many small-town depots resulted in the discontinuance of this route, now designated as unnamed trains 23–24, with last runs occurring on August 8, 1964.Interstate Commerce Commission Finance Docket No. 23015; July 27, 1964. 324 ICC 729.

He was convicted of the September 2, 1991 murders of three rival drug dealers and a visitor to their Youngstown, Ohio home. Williams had returned to the neighborhood after a long absence to find that several people including Alfonda R. Madison, William L. Dent, and Eric Howard had taken over his drug dealing in the area. He decided to regain control and to do this decided to murder the three. He enlisted the help of his 16-year-old girlfriend, Jessica M. Cherry; her brother, Dominic M. Cherry; and Dominic Cherry's seventeen-year-old \\"cousin\\", Broderick Boone. On the night of September 1, after Jessica Cherry had previously gone to the house of Madison to discuss a drug deal, Williams arrived with the three accomplices. All but Williams went into the house, where they drew guns on Madison. Using walkie-talkies they signaled for Williams to enter the house. Madison was handcuffed and his mouth taped with duct tape. Theodore Wynn, Jr. then arrived at the house, looking for Madison and Howard. Jessica answered the door and told Wynn the two weren't home. Williams realized that Wynn could identify them, so he got Jessica to call him back into the house. Wynn was then handcuffed and gagged. Jessica was then instructed by Williams to use a payphone to call Dent and get him to come to the house. He arrived with Howard and the two were ambushed by Williams and the other three, and forced into the bathroom. Williams then proceeded to strangle Madison and Wynn, and then shot the four victims in the head with a gun owned by Madison. Dominic Cherry turned himself in to police on September 24. Police then arrested Jessica Cherry and Broderick. The three were held at Mahoning County Juvenile Justice Center. Williams was then arrested but escaped on October 15 and while a fugitive was indicted on four counts of aggravated murder, four counts of kidnapping, and one count of aggravated burglary. His next action was on January 12, 1992 when he and two other men went to the Juvenile Justice Center and tricked the receptionist into letting them enter. He then held the receptionist and deputy sheriff hostage while demanding to see Jessica, Dominic and Broderick. He would later testify that he planned to kill the three to stop them being witnesses at his trial. He later surrendered and was re-indicted on twelve counts of aggravated murder, four counts of kidnapping, and one count of aggravated burglary. The three juveniles plead guilty to delinquency by reason of complicity to aggravated murder, complicity to aggravated burglary, and complicity to kidnapping. Williams plead not guilty but was convicted on all counts and was sentenced to death on the four aggravated murder convictions. Police think that Williams may have killed up to ten other people during his criminal career. He had previously done five years in a California prison for cocaine trafficking Bank robbery. He had also once walked into a police station in Youngstown and asked for information on rival drug dealers in the area. The Ohio Parole Board recommended that Governor Bob Taft not give clemency in this case, which he withheld on October 24.

Its beers and sodas are sold in Pennsylvania and neighboring states. History =Early History: 1905 to 1933= The Lion Brewery traces its origins to 1905 when the Luzerne County Brewing Company was organized and ground was broken on its four story brick brewery located at 700 North Pennsylvania Avenue, Wilkes Barre. The brewery was built on land acquired from Delaware and Hudson Company in 1905. The land was purchased for one dollar on the terms that the company would build a brewery capable of producing per year in just the first year and sell each barrel for no less than a dollar a piece. If the terms were not met, the land would return to the Delaware and Hudson Company. The brewery formally opened May 25, 1906, and was especially designed to brew Bohemian and Bavarian Beers.\\"New Brewery\\", The Wilkes-Barre News, May 25, 1906, p.1 Its beers included a pilsner and a porter brewed under the Edelbrau name, and Munchner Bock Beer. Luzerne County Brewing Company went into bankruptcy in May 1908 but continued to operate under a receiver.\\"In Capable Hands\\", The Wilkes-Barre Record, October 7, 1908, p.7 In 1911, the company was reorganized as Lion Brewing Company.\\"Luzerne Co Brewery is Now Reorganized\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, May 30, 1911, p.1 In 1912, it began marketing Lion Beer,\\"Lion Beer Will Be Placed on Market Here Next Friday\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, July 23, 1912, p.12 which included a pilsner and a bock. After the arrival of Prohibition in 1919, the Lion Brewing Company produced near-beers called Buck-O and Gold Label. The company struggled to survive, and after its president was charged in 1923 with violation of prohibition laws,\\"Brewery President Arrested\\", The Wilkes-Barre Record, Feb. 5, 1923, p.4 went into receivership. The brewery was then purchased by the Malt Beverage Company, the president of which was Charles Gibbons.\\"New Owners of Brewery are Restrained from Operating by Witmer\\", The Scranton Times, April 5, 1924, p.3 The brewery operated until 1928, when it was raided by Federal agents and was again closed for making high-alcohol beer.\\"Brewery Raided Here – Six Men Under Arrest\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Aug. 28, 1928, p.1 =Smulowitz Family Ownership: 1933 to 1993= The brewery remained closed until the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, when it was purchased by The Lion, Inc., a company owned by brothers Henry, Ted, Morris and Louis (Laffe) Smulowitz. Members of the Smulowitz family owned the brewery for the next 60 years. When the brewery resumed operations in the summer of 1933, Charles A. Gibbons was plant manager as well as Secretary Treasurer of the company.\\"Lion Brewery Improvements Total $100,000\\", The Wilkes-Barre Evening News, July 29, 1933, p.3The brewery had an annual capacity of 200,000 barrels at that time. The beer it initially produced was marketed as Lion Beer. In 1936, in order to avoid confusion with other similarly named brands, it changed the name of its beer to Gibbons beer (named for Charles Gibbons)\\"Smulowitz Beer? Brewery Brothers opted for Gibbons\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, June 17, 1983, p. 5C\\"Barreling Along – The Scrappy Lion Brewery Survives in the Tough World of Making Beer\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, March 5, 1988, which became its flagship brand, and included lager, ale and porter varieties. For most of the next 40 years, the brewery traded as Gibbons Brewing Co. The Lion Brewing Company underwent many changes during the sixty-year Smulowitz ownership. In the 1940s, brewery officials sensed changing tastes and successfully introduced the first lighter bodied beer in Northeast Pennsylvania. Post-Prohibition, the beer brewing industry as a whole grew by leaps and bounds until around 1960, when the big breweries began to take control of the market. In 1957, William Smulowitz, Ted's son, started with the brewery. He became president of The Lion in 1969 and ran it until 1993, when he sold it. In 1967, with consolidation taking place in the brewing industry, Bartels Brewing Company, a brewery located in nearby Edwardsville, Pennsylvania, went out of business and The Lion acquired its labels and recipes.\\"The Lion, Inc. to Brew Bartels\\", Wilkes-Barre Record, March 1, 1967, p. 1 A much larger acquisition occurred in 1974 when The Lion's cross-town rival Stegmaier Brewing Company went out of business and The Lion acquired its labels and recipes Founded in 1857, the Stegmaier Brewery had been the dominant area brewery and had been much larger than The Lion. Although Stegmaier Gold Medal Beer became The Lion's largest selling brand, there was a loss of brand loyalty and national brands continued to take market share, and sales slipped with time. In 1983 Lionshead beer was introduced. It has since become the flagship brand of the brewery. The 1980s were a period of diversification for The Lion. In 1981, it began brewing Malta, a non-alcoholic malt beverage, for Goya Foods. In 1986 it first produced malt-based wine coolers, and in 1987 began brewing natural soda. In 1987, The Lion also began contract brewing for craft brewers. Its first contract brewed craft beer was Manhattan Gold, which was brewed for Manhattan Brewing Company. It has since contract brewed numerous beers for many companies. Stegmaier 1857, an all-malt lager brewed in accordance with the Reinheitsbot, was introduced in 1988.\\"'Stegmaier 1857' beer unveiled\\", Wilkes-Barre Citizens Voice, October 14, 1988, p. 2 It would go on to win many awards, including a gold medal at the 1994 Great American Beer Festival. =Events since 1993= In 1993, Bill Smulowitz sold the Lion Brewery to the Quincy Partners. In 1996, the Quincy Partners took the Lion Brewing Company public by selling shares on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. Under the supervision of head brewmaster Leo Orlandini, the Brewery Hill line of craft beers was introduced in the 1990s. In 1999 Orlandini was named Mid-Size Brewing Company Brewmaster of the Year at the Great American Beer Festival.\\"Lion Brewery Receives 2 Awards\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Oct. 14, 1999, p. 9B In 1999 Chuck Lawson spearheaded the purchase of the Lion Brewery for 18.5 million dollars, thereby transferring the company back into private hands. The Brewery Hill line of craft beers was rebranded under the Pocono label in 2002. The Lion Brewery hosted its first Oktoberfest celebration in 2005. This festival is designed to promote the brewery and German culture and to give people the chance to learn how beer is made, sample German food, and celebrate. Stegmaier Oktoberfest was brewed to be the official beer of the festival. Brewery tours are given on Saturday during the festival. Entertainment includes live bands, rides, games, wiener dog races and a fireworks display. On November 1, 2007, Chuck Lawson and Pat Belardi sold The Lion Brewery to private equity investors led by Cliff Risell and Ron Hammond who continued to operate the brewery as a private company. In late 2009 production of beer in 16oz. returnable bottles ended in order to make room for a new canning line, which began operating in 2010. The Gibbons and Bartels brands were also discontinued in the process. Between 2007 and 2017 the Lion Brewery invested $20 million in updating brewery capabilities. Among these additions are a Krones Top Modul Labeller with Paper and PSL label capabilities, a Dual Deck Krones Pasteurizer, and two Alvey Palletizers. The company has also invested in various quality control measures such as a Quality Lab and on-staff Microbiologists. At the end of 2019 the Lion Brewery was purchased by Encore Consumer Capital, a San Francisco-based private equity firm. Current brands =Lionshead= Lionshead bottle Lionshead is an economy brand 4.5% abv deluxe pilsner introduced in 1983 and made with American malts, corn and hops. It is primarily available in Pennsylvania, with limited distribution in other states. Lionshead bottle caps display rebus puzzles originally created by the Falstaff Brewing Corporation. The answer to 20 Lionshead's puzzles can be found here: and maybe here: The top of the Lionshead cap has a gold lion's paw on a maroon background and the words \\"claw off\\" on it. There is a Lionshead Light version and it has recently become available in cans. =Stegmaier= The Stegmaier Brewery was founded in Wilkes-Barre in 1857 by Charles Stegmaier (1821-1906) a native of Wurtemberg, Germany. Stegmaier became a brewing apprentice at the age of 15 and served as a brewmaster in Wurtemberg before emigrating to the United States in 1849. He initially went to Philadelphia, but in 1851, he relocated to Wilkes-Barre. In 1857 he started a small brewery on Hazel Street, near High Street. As business grew, Stegmaier formed a partnership with his father-in-law under the name Baer & Stegmaier. In 1863 a larger brewery was built on East Market Street. Baer & Stegmaier failed during the panic of 1873, but in 1875 Stegmaier had formed a new brewing Company, C. Stegmaier & Son, and in 1880, he re-purchased the Market Street Brewery. The beer brewed by Charles Stegmaier, especially his lagers and porters, earned a reputation for superior quality, and his brewery grew significantly.\\"C. Stegmaier & Son\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times, Dec. 19, 1894, Industrial Edition To meet growing demand C. Stegmaier & Son constructed a new 6-story brew house in 1894 on Market Street. In 1897 the brewery was incorporated as the Stegmaier Brewing Company, which funded additional expansion of the brewery complex. Janosav, Robert A., \\"Cold and Gold from the Poconos - A History of the Stegmaier Brewing Company\\", Tres Canis Publishing Co - Nanticoke, PA, 1997 Charles Stegmaier was held in high esteem in the Wyoming Valley. Shrewd, but honest, he was active in the community and was charitable, caring towards his employees, generous to those in need, and treated his guests with lavish hospitality.\\"Death Ends Useful Career of Charles Stegmaier Sr.\\", The Wilkes-Barre News, Aug. 13, 1906 The Stegmaier Brewery was the largest brewery in northeast Pennsylvania for many years. Stegmaier beer won 8 gold medals at European expositions held between 1911 and 1913, which furthered its reputation for quality. Stegmaier survived prohibition by making near-beer. In 1942 Stegmaier produced 510,000 barrels of beer. The loss of population in Northeastern Pennsylvania resulting from the demise of the anthracite coal mining industry, together with competition from national breweries hurt Stegmaier's sales. In 1963, it only sold 188,000 barrels of beer. Janosav, Robert A., \\"Cold and Gold from the Poconos - A History of the Stegmaier Brewing Company\\", Tres Canis Publishing Co - Nanticoke, PA, 1997 In October 1974 it was announced that The Stegmaier brewery was closing and that The Lion was acquiring Stegmaiers' labels and recipes. In addition to a shrinking customer base and encroachment from national brands, Stegmaier had trouble competing because of antiquated equipment, a large brewery building with high overhead costs,\\"Not Biggest, But Still OK\\", The Scranton Times, Sept. 9, 1977, p. 13 and 1973-74 price shocks that increased the cost of many commodities needed to produce beer. After the acquisition, The Lion hired 50 former Stegmaier employees and it formed a Stegmaier Brewing division that was responsible for its Stegmaier beer.\\"Stegmaier Executive Staff Directs Own Division at Lion, Inc.\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Feb. 6, 1975, p. 25 Charles Stegmaier's great- great-grandson, Charles Maier, who had been an Executive Vice President in Stegmaier Brewing Company, became an Executive Vice President in The Lion. A Stegmaier brewmaster was hired by The Lion, and consumers were assured that Stegmaier was being brewed by The Lion to the exact same formula as it had been previously,\\"Executive V.P. Comments on Recent Brewery Merger\\", The Wilkes-Barre Sunday Independent', Nov. 10, 1974, p. C-4\\"228 Local Beer Workers Break production Records at America's Biggest Little Brewery\\", The Wilkes- Barre Times Leader, April 17, 1975, p. 27 (including the use of Stegmaier's yeast\\"Distinctive Flavor Starts Here\\", The Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Feb. 6, 1975, p. 25). As of 2019, Stegmaier products are distributed in northeastern Pennsylvania. Stegmaier products include: Stegmaier Gold Medal - Stegmaier Export beer was awarded 8 gold medals at European expositions held between 1911 and 1913. As a result, the name of the beer was changed to Stegmaier Gold Medal Export, and finally to Stegmaier Gold Medal. It was the Stegmaier Brewing Company's flagship brand until it closed, and after Lion Brewery acquired the right to produce Stegmaier products in 1974, it became the Lion's biggest selling brand. Stegmaier IPA - Introduced in 2005 to commemorate the Lion Brewery's 100th anniversary. Seasonal Stegmaier beers include Porter, Pumpkin Ale, Oktoberfest, and Winter Warmer. Stegmaier Porter was first brewed by Charles Stegmaier in the 1800s. Porter originated in England in the early 1700s and became popular in Colonial America, with production concentrated in Pennsylvania. When German brewers like Charles Stegmaier began brewing lager to America in the mid-1800s, the popularity of porter led them to add porters to their offerings. Prior to the start of the craft brewing revolution in the 1970s, Yuengling, Stegmaier and Narragansett were the only breweries still producing porters on a regular basis in the United States.\\"American Porters\\", by Martin Lodahl, https://www.morebeer.com/articles/american_porters (By this time, no British breweries were brewing porters.) For this reason, these breweries have been credited with helping to keep the porter style alive. Stegmaier Porter was a Gold Medal winner at the 1997 World Beer Championships. \\"We Are Your Mane Brewery\\", The Weekender (Wilkes-Barre, April 2, 1998, p. 25 Liebotschaner Cream Ale. Liebotschaner, which means \\"love of beauty\\" in German, was first brewed by Charles Stegmaier before 1886 and was made until Prohibition. In 1962 it was revived as a super-premium and was brewed from 100% specially roasted barley malts and imported hops. \\"Early Brew Reintroduced\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, Aug. 8, 1962, p. 42 In mid-1974 Stegmaier stopped brewing Liebotschaner due to the unavailability of ingredients. \\"Stegmaier's Stops Making Liebotschaner\\", Wilkes-Barre Times Leader, July 1, 1974, p. 3 In 1975, after the acquisition of Stegmaier's brands by The Lion, Liebotschaner was revived as a cream ale.\\"The Other Brands Keep Coming but Lion Inc.

They do contract brewing for Pabst Brewing Company brands. Discontinued brands =Gibbons= The Gibbons brand was introduced in 1936 when the name of Lion Beer was changed to Gibbons in order to avoid confusion with other similarly named brands produced by other brewers. It was named for Charles A. Gibbons, an early officer of Lion, Inc. For many years the brewery produced Gibbons beer, ale and porter, and the brewery traded as Gibbons Brewing Company. Gibbons was the flagship brand of The Lion until the acquisition of the Stegmaier brands in 1974. Gibbons beer continued to be produced until November 2009, when the Lion Brewery stopped packaging beer in 16oz returnable bottles. =Bartels= In 1967 The Lion acquired the labels and recipes of Bartels Brewing Company, which was founded in nearby Edwardsville, Pennsylvania in 1889.\\"The Lion, Inc. to Brew Bartels\\", Wilkes- Barre Record, March 1, 1967, p. 1 Bartels was a traditional darker beer in contrast to Gibbons, which was a lighter modern style.\\"'Is Good' Brews More Business\\", The Scranton Sunday Times, March 19, 1967, p. B8 The Bartels label continued to feature \\"The Professor\\", a highly regarded symbol when Bartels was the biggest selling brand in the region, who had dispensed words of wisdom in Bartels advertising. Like Gibbons beer, Bartels was discontinued after the Lion Brewery stopped packaging beer in 16oz returnable bottles in November 2009.

The Phoenix Lights (sometimes called the \\"Lights over Phoenix\\") were a series of widely sighted unidentified flying objects or UFOs observed in the skies over the U.S. states of Arizona, Nevada, and the Mexican state of Sonora on March 13, 1997. Lights of varying descriptions were seen by thousands of people between 19:30 and 22:30 MST, in a space of about 300 miles (480 km), from the Nevada line, through Phoenix, to the edge of Tucson. There were two distinct events involved in the incident: a triangular formation of lights seen to pass over the state, and a series of stationary lights seen in the Phoenix area. The United States Air Force identified the second group of lights as flares dropped by A-10 Warthog aircraft that were on training exercises at the Barry Goldwater Range in southwest Arizona. Witnesses claim to have observed a huge carpenter's square-shaped UFO, containing five spherical lights or possibly light-emitting engines. Fife Symington, the governor at the time, was one witness to this incident; he later called the object \\"otherworldly.\\" The lights were reported to have reappeared in 2007 and 2008, but these events were quickly attributed to (respectively) military flares dropped by fighter aircraft at Luke Air Force Base and flares attached to helium balloons released by a civilian. Timeline =Initial reports= At about 18:55 PST (19:55 MST), a man reported seeing a V-shaped object above Henderson, Nevada. He said it was about the \\"size of a (Boeing) 747\\", sounded like \\"rushing wind\\", and had six lights on its leading edge. The lights reportedly traversed northwest to the southeast. An unidentified former police officer from Paulden, Arizona is claimed to have been the next person to report a sighting, after leaving his house at about 20:15 MST. As he was driving north, he allegedly saw a cluster of reddish or orange lights in the sky, comprising four lights together and a fifth light trailing them. Each of the individual lights in the formation appeared to the witness to consist of two separate point sources of orange light. He returned home and through binoculars watched the lights until they disappeared south over the horizon. =Prescott and Prescott Valley= Lights were also reportedly seen in the areas of Prescott and Prescott Valley. At approximately 20:17 MST, callers began reporting the object was definitely solid, because it blocked out much of the starry sky as it passed over.http://www.phoenixlightsufo.com/ Tim Ley, eyewitness, in his own words. John Kaiser was standing outside with his wife and sons in Prescott Valley when they noticed a cluster of lights to the west-northwest of their position. The lights formed a triangular pattern, but all of them appeared to be red, except the light at the nose of the object, which was distinctly white. The object, or objects, which had been observed for approximately 2 to 3 minutes with binoculars, then passed directly over the observers, were seen to \\"Bank to the right\\", and then disappeared in the night sky to the southeast of Prescott Valley. The altitude could not be determined; however, the object was fairly low and made no sound whatsoever.Ufo Events Over Arizona The National UFO Reporting Center received the following report from the Prescott area: =First sighting from Phoenix= Tim Ley and his wife Bobbi, his son Hal and his grandson Damien Turnidge first saw the lights when they were above Prescott Valley about 65 miles (100 km) away from them. At first, the lights appeared to them as five separate and distinct lights in an arc-shape, as if they were on top of a balloon, but they soon realized that the lights appeared to be moving towards them. Over the next ten or so minutes, the lights appeared to come closer, the distance between the lights increased, and they took on the shape of an upside down V. Eventually, when the lights appeared to be a couple of miles away, the witnesses could make out a shape that looked like a 60-degree carpenter's square, with the five lights set into it, with one at the front and two on each side. Soon, the object with the embedded lights appeared to be coming right down the street where they lived, about 100 to 150 feet (30 to 45 meters) above them, traveling so slowly that it appeared to hover and was silent. The object then seemed to pass over their heads and went through a V opening in the peaks of the mountain range towards Squaw Peak Mountain and toward the direction of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Witnesses in Glendale, a suburb northwest of Phoenix, saw the object pass overhead at an altitude high enough to become obscured by the thin clouds; this was at approximately between 20:30 and 20:45 MST. =Arriving in Phoenix= When the triangular formation entered the Phoenix area, Bill Greiner, a cement driver hauling a load down a mountain north of Phoenix, described the second group of lights: \\"I'll never be the same. Before this, if anybody had told me they saw a UFO, I would've said, \\"Yeah and I believe in the Tooth Fairy.\\" \\"Now I've got a whole new view and I may be just a dumb truck driver, but I've seen something that don't belong here.\\" Greiner stated that the lights hovered over the area for more than two hours.Hamilton, Bill. Phoenix Sightings: Summary Report – Mass Sightings in Arizona. =After Phoenix= A report came from a young man in the Kingman area who stopped his car at a payphone to report the incident. \\"[The] young man, en route to Los Angeles, called from a phone booth to report having seen a large and bizarre cluster of stars moving slowly in the northern sky\\". =Reappearance in 2007= A repeat of the lights occurred February 6, 2007 and was recorded by the local Fox News television station. According to military officials and the Federal Aviation Administration, these were flares dropped by F-16 aircraft training at Luke Air Force Base. =Reappearance in 2008= On April 21, 2008, lights were again reported over Phoenix by local residents. These lights appeared to change from square to triangular formation over time. A valley resident reported that shortly after the lights appeared, three jets were seen heading west in the direction of the lights. An official from Luke Air Force Base denied any United States Air Force activity in the area. On April 22, 2008, a resident of Phoenix told a newspaper that the lights were nothing more than his neighbor releasing helium balloons with flares attached. This was confirmed by a police helicopter. The following day, a Phoenix resident, who declined to be identified in news reports, stated that he had attached flares to helium balloons and released them from his back yard. Photographic documentation Imagery of the Phoenix Lights falls into two categories: images of the triangular formation seen prior to 22:00 MST in Prescott and Dewey, and images of the 22:00 MST Phoenix event. Almost all known images are of the second event. All known images were produced using a variety of commercially available camcorders and cameras. There are no known images taken by equipment designed for scientific analysis, nor are there any known images taken using high powered optics or night vision equipment. =First event= There are few known images of the Prescott/Dewey lights. Television station KSAZ reported that an individual named Richard Curtis recorded a detailed video that purportedly showed the outline of a space craft, but that the video had been lost. The only other known video is of poor quality and shows a group of lights with a clear discernible outline of a v shape, fitting the description of what many witnesses reported. A cleaned up and enhanced copy of the video can be viewed on you tube. =Second event= During the Phoenix event, numerous still photographs and videotapes were made, distinctly showing a series of lights appearing at a regular interval, remaining illuminated for several moments and then going out. These images have been repeatedly aired by documentary television channels such as the Discovery Channel and the History Channel as part of their UFO documentary programming. The most frequently seen sequence shows what appears to be an arc of lights appearing one by one, then going out one by one. UFO advocates claim that these images show that the lights were some form of \\"running light\\" or other aircraft illumination along the leading edge of a large craft – estimated to be as large as a mile (1.6 km) in diameter – hovering over the city of Phoenix. Other similar sequences reportedly taken over a half hour period show differing numbers of lights in a V or arrowhead array. Thousands of witnesses throughout Arizona also reported a silent, mile wide V or boomerang shaped craft with varying numbers of huge orbs. A significant number of witnesses reported that the craft was silently gliding directly overhead at low altitude. The first-hand witnesses consistently reported that the lights appeared as \\"canisters of swimming light\\", while the underbelly of the craft was undulating \\"like looking through water\\".Dateline NBC The Phoenix Lights http://msnbcecn.vo.llnwd.net/e1/video/flash/x_30_dtl_UFO1_080517.flv However, skeptics claim that the video is evidence that mountains not visible at night partially obstructed views from certain angles, thereby bolstering the claim that the lights were more distant than UFO advocates claim. UFO advocate Jim Dilettoso claimed to have performed \\"spectral analysis\\" of photographs and video imagery that proved the lights could not have been produced by a man- made source. Dilettoso claimed to have used software called \\"Image Pro Plus\\" (exact version unknown) to determine the amount of red, green and blue in the various photographic and video images and construct histograms of the data, which were then compared to several photographs known to be of flares. Several sources have pointed out, however, that it is impossible to determine the spectral signature of a light source based solely on photographic or video imagery, as film and electronics inherently alter the spectral signature of a light source by shifting hue in the visible spectrum, and experts in spectroscopy have dismissed his claims as being scientifically invalid. Normal photographic equipment also eliminates light outside the visible spectrum – e.g., infrared and ultraviolet – that would be necessary for a complete spectral analysis. The maker of \\"Image Pro Plus\\", Media Cybernetic, has stated that its software is incapable of performing spectroscopic analysis. Cognitech, an independent video laboratory, superimposed video imagery taken of the Phoenix Lights onto video imagery it shot during daytime from the same location. In the composite image, the lights are seen to extinguish at the moment they reach the Estrella mountain range, which is visible in the daytime, but invisible in the footage shot at night. A broadcast by local Fox Broadcasting Company affiliate KSAZ-TV claimed to have performed a similar test that showed the lights were in front of the mountain range and suggested that the Cognitech data might have been altered. Dr. Paul Scowen, visiting professor of Astronomy at Arizona State University, performed a third analysis using daytime imagery overlaid with video shot of the lights and his findings were consistent with Cognitech. The Phoenix New Times subsequently reported the television station had simply overlaid two video tracks on a video editing machine without using a computer to match the zoom and scale of the two images. Wind direction data Wind direction measured independently by several weather stations in the Phoenix area and archived by the National Centers for Environmental Information is consistent with reports about the movement of the lights. During the events, wind direction (origin) was changing from roughly west (i.e., blowing towards the east) to north (i.e., blowing towards the south). This supports the hypothesis that the flying objects were wind driven and could simply have been balloons (such as sky lanterns or other balloon-carried light effects) or flares. Wind direction in Phoenix, AZ on March 13–14, 1997. Wind is reported by the direction from which it originates. Data courtesy of NOAA National Climate Data Center. Explanations There is some controversy as to how best to classify the reports on the night in question. Some are of the opinion that the differing nature of the eyewitness reports indicates that several unidentified objects were in the area, each of which was its own separate \\"event\\". This is largely dismissed by skeptics as an over-extrapolation from the kind of deviation common in necessarily subjective eyewitness accounts. The media and most skeptical investigators have largely preferred to split the sightings into two distinct classes, a first and second event, for which two separate explanations are offered: =First event= The first event – the \\"V\\", which appeared over northern Arizona and gradually traveled south over nearly the entire length of the state, eventually passing south of Tucson – was the apparently \\"wedge-shaped\\" object reported by then-Governor Symington and many others. This event started at about 20:15 MST over the Prescott area, and was seen south of Tucson by about 20:45 MST. Proponents of two separate events propose that the first event still has no provable explanation, but that some evidence exists that the lights were in fact airplanes. According to an article by reporter Janet Gonzales that appeared in the Phoenix New Times, videotape of the v shape shows the lights moving as separate entities, not as a single object; a phenomenon known as illusory contours can cause the human eye to see unconnected lines or dots as forming a single shape. Mitch Stanley, an amateur astronomer, observed high altitude lights flying in formation using a Dobsonian telescope giving 43x magnification. After observing the lights, he told his mother, who was present at the time, that the lights were aircraft. According to Stanley, the lights were quite clearly individual airplanes; a companion who was with him recalled asking Stanley at the time what the lights were, and he said, \\"Planes\\". When Stanley first gave an account of his observation at the Discovery Channel Town Hall Meeting with all the witnesses there he was shouted down in his assertion that what he saw was what other witnesses saw. Obviously Stanley was seeing the Maryland National Guard jets flying in formation on their way to drop high-altitude flares at the Barry M. Goldwater bombing range south of Phoenix. His account as to the nature of the lights that moved in formation that night is contradicted by some Phoenix residents without high powered telescopes, however, and no military or civilian aircraft formations were known to have been flying in the area at that time. Of course, the Maryland National Guard jets were not known about at that time because their mission was a classified military mission. Additionally, Prescott includes the western campus of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University where flight training occurs with a large fleet of light aircraft. An additional whispered theory on campus is that the aircraft in formation were ERAU aircraft flying in formation with transponders and lights off as a prank. It is treated as an open secret as such behavior is a severe violation of FAA and ERAU rules. =Second event= The second event was the set of nine lights appearing to \\"hover\\" over the city of Phoenix at around 10 pm. The second event has been more thoroughly covered by the media, due in part to the numerous video images taken of the lights. This was also observed by numerous people who may have thought they were seeing the same lights as those reported earlier. The U.S. Air Force explained the second event as slow-falling, long-burning LUU-2B/B illumination flares dropped by a flight of four A-10 Warthog aircraft on a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range at Western Pima county. According to this explanation, the flares would have been visible in Phoenix and appeared to hover due to rising heat from the burning flares creating a \\"balloon\\" effect on their parachutes, which slowed the descent. The lights then appeared to wink out as they fell behind the Sierra Estrella, a mountain range to the southwest of Phoenix. A Maryland Air National Guard pilot, Lt. Col. Ed Jones, responding to a March 2007 media query, confirmed that he had flown one of the aircraft in the formation that dropped flares on the night in question. The squadron to which he belonged was in fact at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, on a training exercise at the time and flew training sorties to the Barry Goldwater Range on the night in question, according to the Maryland Air National Guard. A history of the Maryland Air National Guard published in 2000 asserted that the squadron, the 104th Fighter Squadron, was responsible for the incident.Ball, Ronald ed. Maryland Air National Guard 1921–2000, 2000 The first reports that members of the Maryland Air National Guard were responsible for the incident were published in The Arizona Republic newspaper in July 1997.Ruelas, Richard. \\"Air Guard unit sheds light on Valley's UFOs.\\" Arizona Republic. July 25, 1997. Military flares such as these can be seen from hundreds of miles given ideal environmental conditions. Later comparisons with known military flare drops were reported on local television stations, showing similarities between the known military flare drops and the Phoenix Lights. An analysis of the luminosity of LUU-2B/B illumination flares, the type which would have been in use by A-10 aircraft at the time, determined that the luminosity of such flares at a range of approximately 50–70 miles would fall well within the range of the lights viewed from Phoenix. Public response =News media= There was minimal news coverage at the time of the incident. In Phoenix, a small number of local news outlets noted the event, but it received little attention beyond that. But on June 18, 1997, USA Today ran a front-page story that brought national attention to the case. This was followed by news coverage on the ABC and NBC television networks. The case quickly caught the popular imagination and has since become a staple of UFO-related documentary television, including specials produced by the History Channel and the Discovery Channel. =Governor= Shortly after the lights, Arizona Governor Fife Symington III held a press conference, stating that \\"they found who was responsible\\". He proceeded to make light of the situation by bringing his aide on stage dressed in an alien costume. (Dateline, NBC). But in March 2007, Symington said that he had witnessed one of the \\"crafts of unknown origin\\" during the 1997 event, although he did not go public with the information. In an interview with The Daily Courier in Prescott, Arizona, Symington said, \\"I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it\\". Symington had earlier said, \\"It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape. Symington also noted that he requested information from the commander of Luke Air Force Base, the general of the National Guard, and the head of the Department of Public Safety. But none of the officials he contacted had an answer for what had happened, and were also perplexed. Later, he responded to an Air Force explanation that the lights were flares: \\"As a pilot and a former Air Force Officer, I can definitively say that this craft did not resemble any man made object I'd ever seen. And it was certainly not high-altitude flares because flares don't fly in formation\\". In an episode of the television show UFO Hunters called \\"The Arizona Lights\\", Symington said that he contacted the military asking what the lights were. The response was \\"no comment\\". He pointed out that he was the governor of Arizona at the time, not just some ordinary civilian. Frances Barwood, the 1997 Phoenix city councilwoman who launched an investigation into the event, said that of the over 700 witnesses she interviewed, \\"The government never interviewed even one\\".

It is also found in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, China, Korea, SE Russia, Japan. It is a close relative of the painted lady. Subspecies The subspecies of Vanessa indica are- * Vanessa indica indica (Herbst, 1794) – northeast India, Myanmar * Vanessa indica nubicola (Fruhstorfer, 1898) – Sri Lanka * Vanessa indica pholoe (Fruhstorfer, 1912) – south India Description Side view This species resembles Vanessa cardui but the ground colour is darker both on the uppersides and undersides, and the orange markings are deeper and richer in tint. It also differs as follows: underside forewing: the ochraceous orange-red on disc, and across cell proportionately of less extent, and uniform, not getting paler towards the apex of the cell; the upper four spots of the preapical transverse series on the black apical area minute. It is about 5 inches (13 cm) in length. Hindwing: the postdiscal transverse band much narrower and shorter, not extending below vein 1, margined inwardly by a series of broad black subcrescentic marks; the tornal angle with a small patch of violet scales bordered inwardly by a short black transverse line. Underside very much darker than in V. cardui, the orange red on the disc and in the cell on the forewing restricted as on the upperside; three small transversely placed blue spots beyond the cell. Hindwing: the mottling comparatively very dark, purplish blade, with slender white margins, shaded on disc with rich dark olive-brown; the postdiscal series of ocelli dark and somewhat obscure; an inner subterminal transverse series of blue, and an outer very much slenderer transverse series of black lunules. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white, alternated with brown. Antenna black, tipped with pale ochraceous; head, thorax and abdomen with dark olive-brown pubescence; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale ochraceous brown. The Vanessa indica is not reported as a pest on any crop but on ramie it causes considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect the growth of the plant. The larvae of this insect feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look like the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and later fold the leaves in such a way that both the margins are attached by a silky web and pupation takes place inside the folded leaf. Later the adult emerges as a butterfly. Range V. indica is found in the higher altitude regions (above ) of India including the Nilgiri Hills in southern India. It also occurs on smaller hill ranges in Peninsular India such as the Nandi Hills near Bangalore. Behaviour These are fast flying butterflies. Mainly found in open areas near the river in the mountainous jungle, they are also often seen on grass near roads or in the soil around the plant flowers sucking, honey, or they sitting on the ground basking in the sun. Both male and female Indian red admiral can be seen around the hill nettle plant species. The male Indian red admiral encircles the female while the female goes around to lay eggs on leaves that are suitable. The male butterflies are territorial and they choose the places best suitable for mating. After selecting they fly around the place keeping a watch on the movements of the female. The males are generally aggressive and often seen fighting with other males. They show acrobatic techniques to attract the female's attention. Sometimes adult butterflies extract food from ripe fruit, juices of a variety of flowers and fermented plants. Very few are seen sitting on bird droppings. During summers and dry weather, the males sit on the ground and drink water. At higher altitudes due to strong winds the morning temperatures are low. Consequently, in order to gain the strength needed to perform body and wings activities they require to bask in the warmth of the sun. Larva The larvae of V. indica are known to feed on: *Urtica (nettles) **Urtica thunbergiana *Girardinia diversifolia (Himalayan nettle) *Boehmeria densiflora *Boehmeria nivea (ramie) Gallery Red Admiral I IMG 7045.jpgIn Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, India (around ) Red Admiral I IMG 7046.jpgIn Kullu district (around ) Painted Lady I IMG 6702.jpgIn Kullu district (around ) Indian Red Admiral (Vanessa indica) at Samsing, Duars, West Bengal W IMG 6369.jpgAt Samsing in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India Cultural references *In March 1987 DPR Korea issued a postage stamp depicting Vanessa indica.

The coeducational Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo has 8,822 members as of 2011. History Scouting started in the Republic of Mongolia after the fall of the communist regime in 1990 at the initiative of a group of young Mongol students who created the first Scout troops in Ulaanbaatar, in early 1991. That year, the first Scout troop was organized and 39 Scouts took the oath. On April 16, 1992, the Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo was officially founded by Myagmaryn Esunmönkh, (b. September 9, 1970) a professor at Ulaanbaatar University. That year, the first Scout camp was organized near Ulaanbaatar, and 200 Scouts participated. Mongolia is particularly wellsuited for Scouting, with many picturesque places to camp and take part in traditional Scouting activities, and a very young population, where about 40% are children under 16. Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo, the Scout Association of Mongolia, was officially recognized and declared the 136th member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement on November 5, 1994. That year, the first Mongolian contingent of 50 Scouts participated in the Asia-Pacific Jamboree, and the first Scout Newsletter was published. In 1995, 45 Mongolian Scouts participated in the World Jamboree in the Netherlands. In 1996, the first Mongolian National Jamboree was held. A Global Development Village was organized during the jamboree. In 1997, Scottish and Mongolian Rovers built the \\"Children's Development Center\\". In 1999, Mongolia hosted the 11th Asia Pacific/First Mongolian National Rover Moot. As of 2004, Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo had 8,209 members, in every province and district of Mongolia. Scouts in Mongolia had a successful third National Jamboree August 10-17, 2004 in the Khentii Mountains in the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar. A total of 1,183 Scouts and 170 staff members came from all provinces of Mongolia and from Ulaanbaatar. From 25 July to 01 August 2016, the Scout Association of Mongolia held the Second International Jamboree, the test-jamboree for the 2017 Asia-Pacific Jamboree (also held in Mongolia), at the Nairamdal Children's Centre, on the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar. Foreign contingents who attended included The Scout Association from the United Kingdom, Scouts of China from Taiwan, and small number of representatives from South Korea, Singapore, Australia, and the United States. Metropolitan Jamboree, 2006 Mongolyn Skautyn Kholboo is active in the community and focuses on a variety of charitable causes, in particular, at risk youth and street children. Mongolian Scouts are committed to assisting with the growth of the country during this historic period. The Scouts of Mongolia are presently involved in a national campaign to alleviate poverty, and are focusing their efforts on abandoned children and disabled youth, working in collaboration with the national authorities and with the United Nations agencies active in the country, notably UNICEF. Scouts of Mongolia have a partnership project with Danish Scouting (KFUM). Program and ideals *Cubs-ages 7 to 11 *Scouts-Boys and girls ages 12 to 17 *Rovers-ages 17 and older The Cub Scout Motto is Let's Do Good Things Every Day (equivalent to 'Do A Good Turn Daily'); the Scout Motto is Belen Bol, Be Prepared in Mongol; and the Rover Scout Motto is To Serve. The Mongol noun for a single Scout is Скаут. The Scout emblem incorporates elements of the soyombo, the national emblem. Mongolian culture extends even to the light blue Scout uniforms, as light blue is a traditional Central Asian color of courage and generosity. The Scout Association of Mongolia now runs a street Scout group in Ulaanbaatar starting August 2008. Presently, it has 32 members, 18 boys and 14 girls, ranging from eight to 14 years of age under the guidance of Ariunbold Buuveibaatar as the unit leader, who regularly holds Scouting activities in a school located in Ulaanbaatar.

Steel is from Ohio, and worked in the newspaper business before becoming a mail carrier. Early life William Steel was born on September 7, 1854, in Stafford, Ohio, to Elizabeth Lawrie and William Steel,Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 234. Scottish-born abolitionists who were active in the Underground Railroad. Steel's brother, George A. Steel, became Oregon State Treasurer.

On March 25, 1868 the Steel family moved from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a farm near Oswego, Kansas.Smith Brothers' Chronological History of Crater Lake National Park; craterlakeinstitute.com While a schoolboy in Kansas, in May 1870, Steel read an article, in the newspaper wrapping his lunch, about the discovery of Crater Lake. Crater Lake Steel first visited Crater Lake in 1885, traveling by railroad and then stagecoach to Fort Klamath. He then walked , arriving at the lake on August 15, 1885. Steel published an article describing his reactions as he viewed the lake for the first time in the March 1886 issue of West Shore magazine.Mark, Stephen R., \\"Early Efforts to Establish Crater lake National Park: 1885-1893\\", Administrative History Crater Lake National Park Oregon, Crater Lake National Park, United States Park Service, United States Department of Interior, Washington, D.C., 1984.\\"William Steel (1854-1934)\\", The Oregon History Project, Oregon Historical Society, Portland, Oregon, 2002. Steel was a member of the Portland Alpine Club, the first alpine club in the West, and then helped found Mazamas after the Portland Alpine Club folded. =Promotion of National Park = Steel guided influential people around the Crater Lake area, leading nature hikes and giving campfire lectures about the lake's geography, plants and animals, much like a contemporary interpretive Park Ranger. Steel publicized Crater Lake by hosting the Mazamas convention and mountain climbing tour in 1896. Hundreds of people, including politicians, scientists and climbers, spent three weeks in the area. At the close of the convention, fireworks were lit on Wizard Island, and the group ceremoniously christened the volcano that once stood where the lake is, which the Klamath people had called giiwas for 10,000 years, calling it Mount Mazama. Steel's lobbying led to the designation of Crater Lake National Park as the sixth US National Park. He was not the first superintendent of the park, but did manage to get the first superintendent ousted in what was known as the \\"Crater Lake Rumble\\". Steel believed it was important to develop the lake to bring the public to the lake, including selling the idea of a lodge and an encircling road at the crater's rim, but he also envisioned an elevator to take people to the lake's surface, and roads around the lake itself and to Wizard Island for cars. After three years, Steel was removed as superintendent of the park. Later life Steel became known as \\"The Judge\\", and the \\"father of Crater Lake\\", described as a \\"one-man chamber of commerce\\". He last visited the park in 1932, and died in Medford in 1934.

Originally available exclusively on the Sega Meganet multiplayer gaming service in 1990, it was later remade for the Sega Genesis in 1991. The game appears in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and was later included in Sega Genesis Classics for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. The game was also released for Microsoft Windows on September 13, 2010. The game is similar to and shares assets with Dragon Crystal, which was also released around that time. Gameplay The hero of Fatal Labyrinth engaged in combat. The player controls a nondescript hero who has agreed to enter a forbidden labyrinth, battle various monsters, and make way up to the 30th floor where an evil dragon guards a stolen Holy Goblet. The hero may walk about town talking with the villagers for advice prior to entering the labyrinth. Upon defeating the dragon and reclaiming the Goblet, the player flies back to the village to speak to villagers, who offer praises and congratulations for the hero's efforts. Although Fatal Labyrinth does have a very basic experience points system, it is not exactly a typical turn-based or action RPG. It shares elements with roguelike games, with a much simpler storyline and gameplay. Just as in roguelike games, each level and its contents are randomly generated, similarly to Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series. On each level of the labyrinth, weapons, armor, magic rings, and other items are found, which can be equipped or thrown. Melee weapons include axes, swords and polearms (although the length of the weapon determines its characteristics). Short weapons (axes, short swords) are more powerful but less accurate while longer weapons (broad swords, polearms) usually hit for less damage but are more accurate. Bows and shurikens are included for projectile combat. Body armor, helmets and shields can be found. The effects in magic rings vary from powering up the hero to using them as magical throwing projectiles. Fatal Labyrinth also has a wide variety of other items, including scrolls, canes and potions. A key part of the game revolves around identifying which of these items benefit the character and which ones have curses. Sometimes throwing these items can cause projectile damage. After defeating monsters, the hero levels up and gains health points, added attack power and receives a better title. Enemies only move and attack in response to the player's actions; i.e., when the player takes a step, the enemies take a step. Checkpoints exist on every fifth floor; upon dying, the player is returned to those floors if they were reached. If the hero wanders around a level for too long, the screen will flash and the monsters will respawn. Some floors have pits in which the character falls down one level and has to fight monsters on that level again. The hero may also step on an alarm and may become trapped by monsters. Sometimes the hero respawns in a room with no visible doors, so he might need to search for a hidden door. Food is a vital part of the game. When fed, the hero slowly regenerates health. If unfed for extended periods of time, the hero becomes hungry and loses health. Conversely, if too much food is eaten, the character dies of overeating. Some items can help or hinder the digestion of the hero. Like many role-playing games, gold is present, though the only role it serves is to provide the player with a better funeral service upon death. The more gold you collect in the game, the more detailed your grave is. More people will attend the player's funeral based on their level when killed.

He became a member of parliament, a Cabinet Minister of Transport in 1964, the Deputy Speaker of Parliament from 1994-2000 and a diplomat. He authored several books and edited newspapers and magazines. He was chairman and general manager of a State corporation. He briefly held the honorary rank of Colonel. Background and education Moonesinghe was born in Colombo, Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon), on 15 February 1927. A member of the family of Anagarika Dharmapala (who named him 'Anil Kumar'), he was brought up with Buddhist and Sinhalese nationalist values, as well as an abhorrence of the colonial power, Britain. He went to school at Royal College, Colombo, an elite institution which produced many radicals as well as civil servants and bourgeois politicians, where he won his colours in athletics. During the Second World War he organised a brigade of boys to aid the Japanese if they landed on the island and earned himself the nickname 'Rommel' at school. Later he became influenced by communism (he wrote in praise of the Red Air Force). Together with Osmund Jayaratne and Dicky Attygala, he formed a communist group in Royal College. This group gradually moved to a specifically Trotskyist stance. Moonesinghe went on to University College Ceylon (which later became University of Ceylon), where he excelled in athletics, representing his University at the All India Universities Athletic Meet, which was held regularly in those years, in Lahore in 1944. He taught briefly at Royal Primary School, which had been evacuated to Glendale Bungalow, Bandarawela. He won an exhibition to the University of London and went to Britain in 1945. He sailed on board a troopship; when the news of Churchill's defeat at the general election came through, all the soldiers on board threw their caps in the air and cheered, a fact which greatly encouraged him. Revolutionary Communist Party At University College, London, he studied law. There he met his future wife, Jeanne Hoban – a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) whom he converted to Trotskyism – and Stan Newens, who was later to become a Labour & Co-op MP. They joined the Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP), in which they were associated with the group around Tony Cliff, the so-called 'State-Caps' after their characterisation of the USSR as 'State-Capitalist'. The group later became the Socialist Review Group (SRG), organised around the Socialist Review which evolved into the Socialist Workers Party (SWP). Both Anil and Jeanne were present at the founding conference of the SRG. Through the group he got to know Max Shachtman, becoming familiar with his theory of 'bureaucratic revolution'. He was also familiar with Jock Haston and Ted Grant. Within the RCP he went by the Pseudonym 'Anil Kumaran'. =Marriage= For a time he worked as an overhead crane operator at Southern Forge Ltd, Langley, Slough. He married Jeanne Hoban in 1948 and they moved into a houseboat called 'Red October', which they built together, on the Thames near Marlow. They both entered the Labour Party in Slough, on the heels of a group of the RCP, led by Jock Haston. Anil was a speaker for the National Council of Labour Colleges; while Jeanne was elected to the Executive of the Labour Leagues of Youth, later being put on the list of Labour Parliamentary candidates. They were both associated with the MP for Slough Fenner Brockway and with George Padmore, the prophet of Black African Liberation. LSSP Days His parents summoned Anil back to Colombo urgently in 1952. He was called to the Bar and practised law all over the island. He and Jeanne joined the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) and worked in the Lanka Estate Workers' Union (LEWU), which organised labourers on the tea and rubber plantations. At the time the British were still very powerful on the island, in spite of Ceylon having obtained a form of independence in 1948. The British planters prevailed upon the government to deport Jeanne, but she went into hiding and the LSSP fought successfully to prevent the deportation. In 1954 the LEWU sent him to the Mohomediya Estate in Agalawatte, in the Pasdun Korale (county) to organise a strike there. He was so successful that the Agalawatte Local of the LSSP asked for him to be sent as the Party's parliamentary candidate for the constituency. At the time, the seat was held by the United National Party (UNP) with a comfortable majority (the plantation workers, who were a large minority of the electorate, were disenfranchised by the UNP Government in 1949). In 1956 he won the election for this seat in Parliament representing Agalawatte for 11 years. He worked hard for his constituency, building roads and schools through self-help and worked for the welfare of the poorest sections, particularly for the neglected so-called lower castes. He also successfully contested the working-class Dematagoda Ward of the Colombo Municipal Council, but found that working in Agalawatte took up too much time for him to devote any to his ward work. Together with Jeanne, he joined Sri Lanka's first co-operative housing scheme, the Gothatuwa Building Society, founded by Herbert Keuneman, Seneka Bibile, 'Bonnie' Fernando and other members of the radical intelligentsia. This led to the foundation of the Welikadawatte housing estate, which attained some fame as an island of intellectual creativity. He was elected to the Central Committee of the LSSP and then onto its Political Bureau (Politburo), a position he never lost until he left the party. In 1956 he spoke in Parliament condemning the Soviet invasion of Hungary. In 1960, Yugoslavia opened an embassy in Colombo, and he advised the new ambassador unofficially on how to operate in Sri Lanka. In 1963 he went to Yugoslavia for an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. There he had an opportunity to view at close hand the operation of the Workers' Councils. He was deeply impressed by the level of open debate that he found at these councils, and this experience was to aid him in later years. =Cabinet Minister= At the 1964 LSSP conference, he was aligned with Dr N.M. Perera on the question of whether or not to enter the Coalition Government of Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike. The Party did enter the Government and he became one of the first three Trotskyist cabinet ministers. He received the portfolio of Communications (Transport) and set to work to build up the country's transport resources. He established Employees' Councils to help run the Ceylon Government Railway and the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB). He obtained a large parcel of land in the centre of Colombo for establishing a Central Bus Station (CBS) in close proximity to the main Fort Railway Station. The construction of the new International Airport at Katunayake (a former RAF base which had been taken over in 1957) was also started by him. He negotiated an agreement with the FIAT company to build buses in Sri Lanka. However, the Government was defeated shortly thereafter and he was unable to complete his work – the next government did not sign the agreement with FIAT. =Back in opposition= At the next general election, at which the coalition was defeated, he held his Parliamentary seat. However, in 1967 he lost it on an election petition, although the LSSP retained the Agalawatte seat at the subsequent by-election. He was editor of the daily Janadina newspaper for a short while around this time. In 1966, the police arrested several lower-ranking soldiers and civilians, implicated in an alleged attempted coup d'état, the so-called 'Lavatory Coup'. Several army officers, including the Army Commander Major General Richard Udugama, were dismissed or suspended. Moonesinghe was lawyer for the 9th accused, Mayadunne, in the subsequent trial. He visited Czechoslovakia during the 'Prague Spring' and was again impressed by the activities of the Workers' Councils there. He later wrote a book condemning the Soviet invasion which ousted Alexander Dubček. He succeeded Dr N.M. Perera as President of the redoubtable All Ceylon United Motor Workers' Union (ACUMWU). He also set about organising the United Corporations and Mercantile Union (UCMU) which brought together workers in government corporations, and of which he was general secretary. He went around the country from factory to factory and built up a union of several tens of thousands of members. One of his lieutenants in this task was Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who became an MP in 1970. At the 1970 General Election, the UCMU also sponsored the candidature of novice Mahinda Rajapakse, who was the Chairman of its Vidyodaya University branch and who was later to become Prime Minister and then President of Sri Lanka. =CTB chairman= After the 1970 election, at which the United Front (UF) won a landslide victory, the workers at the CTB spontaneously established workers' committees and took over the running of the institution. They also asked for Anil Moonesinghe to be made chairman of the board. The new Government therefore appointed him chairman and general manager. Thus began the most successful years of the CTB as an institution. For the last two of the five years he was there, the CTB ran at a profit, while providing a service which was never previously or subsequently matched. In this he was aided by his Minister, Leslie Goonawardena. Senior citizens still nostalgically refer to the CTB under Moonesinghe, which provided an efficient and disciplined service to the public. He would dress in a bush shirt and trousers and operate as a one-man flying squad to catch errant bus crews in the act, lying in wait in his metallic blue Volkswagen Variant or his Citroën 2CV at places like Dematagoda Junction to prowl on them. Stories would abound (all untrue) of him being spotted disguised with a beard. To prove that eight buses could be serviced in a day, he once personally carried out eight vehicle services at the Central Workshops, Werahera. In addition to the role in management of the Employees' Councils (which the workers' committees were transformed into after being properly constituted, with democratic elections supervised by the Elections Commission), commuter organisations were included in an advisory role. The services were expanded and measures were taken to improve efficiency, including rationalising bus types. The CTB started buying buses from the Isuzu Company of Japan, to offset any cartelisation by Tata and Ashok Leyland, the main suppliers, and also purchased Ikarus buses from Hungary. Several new bus stands and bus depots were established. A modern, multi-storied bus station was planned at the CBS, complete with hotel and cinema, but this would never be completed. Moonesinghe also took measures to build up local industry and the CTB became well equipped with foundries and workshops: the Central Workshop at Werahera became the largest in South Asia. The local modification of ticket machines was started after employees pointed out many unsuitable features, and a new workshop was acquired for this. In 1974 he started the assembly of bus chassis and prototypes of a locally manufactured bus and a car rolled out of Werahera. In 1971, when the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) staged an insurrection, he formed a 2,000-strong paramilitary body, the Hansa Regiment (of which he was honorary Colonel), from among the employees of the CTB to guard bus depots, bus stops and workshops. He also created 'CANTAB', a secret intelligence organisation, the agents of whom were employees of the CTB, which provided accurate reports of the strength and distribution of JVP units. At this time he joined the editorial board of State, a theoretical journal of the LSSP, published in three languages. In 1975, Leslie Gunawardena and he were preparing the ground for a major shift in the management of the CTB, whereby Employees' Council representatives were to form half the board of directors. However, in September that year the UF broke up and the LSSP Ministers were removed, so Anil resigned from the CTB. =Back in opposition= He was briefly employed at this time, by the Government of Guyana, as a consultant on transport. He contested the 1977 election for the Matugama constituency, which lay next to Agalawatte. He was narrowly beaten into third place by the sitting member of the SLFP. He became deputy secretary of the LSSP in 1978, having supported the group led by NM Perera at that year's conference. In 1980, he was arrested for his part in the General Strike, but later released without any charges being made. At this time he wrote a book on the repression of the Solidarity union in Poland. About this time, he coined the term 'Casino Capitalism' to describe the economic set-up under the UNP regime. SLFP Days He split from the LSSP in 1982 over its refusal to go into coalition with Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike's Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP), forming the Sri Lanka Sama Samaja Party (SLSSP) with other breakaways. He supported Hector Kobbekaduwa at the Presidential Election of that year. In 1983 the SLSSP dissolved itself and he joined the SLFP and contested the Matugama seat at a by-election and won. He represented Matugama until 1989 and then was one of the MPs – under proportional representation – for the Kalutara District until 2000. During the 1983 anti-Tamil pogrom, he intervened to save several people from death. During the 'White Terror' of 1988–90, he was active in saving hundreds of suspects from summary execution – at one point having to threaten an Army commandant with attack. In the early 1990s he was elected a vice-president of the SLFP and was part of a re- organisation drive led by Anura Bandaranaike, DM Jayaratne, Berty Premalal Dissanayake and Mahinda Rajapakse. In opposition, he was the spokesperson for Transport (he was also President of the Sri Lanka National Transport Workers' Union) and, being acknowledged as the best man to take care of the public transport sector, was expected to receive that portfolio in the event of the SLFP returning to power. However, after the victory in 1994 of the People's Alliance, the new Prime Minister, Chandrika Kumaratunga did not care to revive the CTB and did not make Moonesinghe a Minister. Instead, he became Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of Parliament. Soon after this, he was elected President of the Mahabodhi Society, a Buddhist Missionary organisation headquartered in Colombo. He was disoriented by the rather Byzantine internal politics of the SLFP. In the LSSP debate was out open and was democratic, with matters being finally settled with a vote. His habit of speaking his mind, which had only irritated others in the LSSP, proved to be a liability in his new political home. After becoming Deputy Speaker, he grew close to Mrs Bandaranaike, who had herself been deserted by many of her closest allies. Her death affected him deeply. Diplomat In 2000 he was appointed Sri Lanka's Ambassador to Austria, the UN and accredited to the former Yugoslav republics, Hungary, the Czech republic and Slovakia. On 14 March 2002 he presented his credentials as the first Sri Lankan Ambassador to Croatia. He had a close relationship with Václav Havel, the President of the Czech Republic, due to his connections with the oppositional movement in Czechoslovakia since the Prague Spring. After the victory of the UNP at the general election of December 2001, he was recalled. He died on 8 December 2002 in Colombo. He left four children, Janaki, Vinod, Previn and Priyanka, the last two by a second marriage to Joan de Zilva.

He was also a successful real estate investor. After selling his stock in Carnegie Steel, he devoted a great deal of his time and money to philanthropic works. Early life Henry Phipps Jr. was born on September 27, 1839 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His English parents- Henry Phipps, a shoemaker, and Hannah (née Frank)\\\\- migrated to Philadelphia in the early part of the 19th century before settling in Pittsburgh in 1845. He was educated at public schools in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. He had one sister, Amelia Phipps Walker (Mrs. John Walker; 1846-1887), and two brothers: William Henry Phipps (1825-1902), and John Phipps (1833-1860), who was also friends with Carnegie and who died young. Career Phipps began working as a young man as an office boy and later a bookkeeper with Dillworth & Bidwell. In 1861, he became a partner in Bidwell & Phipps, which was an agent for the du Pont Powder Company, and a partner in Kloman & Phipps, a small iron mill. =Involvement with Carnegie= In 1865, he became a partner in childhood friend and neighbor's Andrew (1835–1919) and Thomas Carnegie's (1843–1886) Union Iron Mills, which was created from a merger between Phipps' Kloman & Phipps and Cyclops Iron Company, an iron company which the Carnegies had acquired an interest in. Kloman and Phipps at first refused, but Thomas made an offer of all the shares in Cyclops plus an additional payment of $50,000 ().Bridge, 1903, p. 23. Therefore, on May 1, 1865, the new Union Iron Mills Company was formed.Derbyshire, 2008, p. 78-79. For the next year, Phipps and Carnegie went to Europe on tour, and when they returned in 1866, went to work. Phipps toiled for the next 20 years and proved a capable financier, becoming Carnegie's business partner in Carnegie Steel Company, founded in 1892, which would make him a very wealthy man as the company's second-largest shareholder. In 1901, Carnegie Steel Company was sold to the United States Steel Corporation; a newly formed organisation, set up by Pierpont Morgan.Nasaw, D., 2006, p.580-588 It sold for $400 million (approx. $13.3 billion today), of which $226 million went to Carnegie himself,Nasaw, D., 2006, p.687 and $48 million went to Phipps. In 1907, Henry Phipps established Bessemer Trust Company to manage his substantial assets that would be shared by his offspring following his death. =Real estate= In 1909, Phipps expanded his Cape Cod holdings to the entire 800 acre Great Island on Cape Cod, purchasing the remaining 50 acres from Charles B. Cory (1857–1921). The Cape Cod estate was next to Aberdeen Hall (which burnt down in September 1924) and was near Andrew Carnegie, Henry M. Flagler, and Henry Clay Frick's estates. In 1912, Phipps divided $3,000,000 () worth of real estate in Chicago, Illinois realty among his three sons. Later in the same year, he also gave his sons $10,000,000 () worth of property in Pittsbugh. In 1916, he purchased property in Great Neck, Long Island in the Village of Lake Success and in 1917, began construction on a thirty-nine-room Georgian mansion summer home, which was completed in 1919. He named the home, Bonnie Blink, which is Scottish for Pretty View. After his death, the mansion and property were donated to the school district and have since become William A. Shine Great Neck South High School.\\"Lucky 7\\", (Match, Richard).\\"This is Great Neck\\", (The League of Women Voters of Great Neck). In 1926, he bought Island Beach, which was sold by his heirs in 1953 to the State of New Jersey. Now known as Island Beach State Park, it is the last remaining stretch of undeveloped barrier island on the central New Jersey coast. Phipps was one of the pioneer investors in Florida real estate. At one time, he and his family owned one- third of the town of Palm Beach, 28 miles (approximately 45 kilometers) of oceanfront between Palm Beach and Fort Lauderdale, prime bay front property in downtown Miami, and 29,653 acres (approximately 12,000 hectares) of land in Martin County. The Phipps family donated to the town of Palm Beach one of the most significant gifts in county history: an ocean-to-lake frontage property that is now known as Phipps Park. =Philanthropy= Phipps Houses, Queens, NYC Phipps believed that those who have achieved great wealth should give back for the public good and create institutions dedicated to that purpose.The Philanthropy Hall of Fame, Henry Phipps Jr. As such he was involved with a number of philanthropic causes, the best known of which is the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Schenley Park, an 1893 gift to the city of Pittsburgh. Among his many benevolent works, he also funded the Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment and Prevention of Tuberculosis at the University of Pennsylvania and The Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital which in 1913 made possible the first inpatient facility in the United States for the mentally ill constructed as part of an acute care hospital. Phipps was also an advocate of decent housing for the poor and in 1905 Phipps funded the non-profit Phipps Houses to build affordable housing in New York City.Community Development  PCDC  About . www.phippsny.org He gave $1,000,000 () to build tenement houses for \\"working people.\\" Phipps Houses still operates to this day; Henry Phipps's great-grandson, Stuart S.

He was a member of the Country Party and served in the House of Representatives from 1919 to 1934. He was Minister for Works and Railways in the Bruce–Page Government from 1924 to 1928. Early life Hill was born on 14 April 1866 at Burnt Creek near Dunolly, Victoria. He was the son of English immigrants Sarah (née Baker) and John Hill; his mother was illiterate. His father and uncle ran the local flour mill, but after the mill burned down the family moved to Stradbroke to take up a selection of uncleared forest. Hill was educated at a part-time school in Stradbroke before joining the clerical division of Victorian Railways. He served as stationmaster at Elphinstone, during which time he would walk several miles to Castlemaine to attend evening classes. He married Lucy Shields in 1892; her father Edward Shields was mayor of Chewton. Following the death of his father-in-law, Hill left the railways to manage the family's tannery in Chewton. He served on the Chewton Borough Council from 1900 to 1906 and was secretary of the Castlemaine Rifle Clubs' Union. Farming In 1906, Hill took up a portion of David Mitchell's subdivided estate at Colbinabbin. He served as the secretary of the Colbinabbin Progress Association and in 1915 was elected secretary of the Wheat Pool Vigilance Committee, formed by farmers concerned that the government and wheat merchants were conspiring to reduce the price of wheat. In 1916, Hill was elected as the founding president of the Victorian Farmers' Union (VFU). He was also a delegate to the Australian Farmers' Federal Organization, a member of the Victorian Wheat Commission's advisory council, a growers' representative on the Australian Wheat Board, and chairman of the Farmers' Advocate newspaper published in Melbourne. He led a movement to supply cheaper superphosphate to farmers and served as chairman of the Phosphate Co-operative Company of Australia.

It was the first bilingual (English – Hindi) news service and was initially run by STAR India on its own with NDTV doing the production until 2003. When the agreement with the NDTV expired in 2003, STAR News was transformed into a complete Hindi language news channel, part of the STAR and ABP tie up. In 2003, the contract with NDTV ended and STAR decided to run the channel on its own. However, the government introduced a guideline capping foreign equity in the News business to 26%. STAR then entered into a joint venture with the Ananda Bazar Patrika group to form a company called Media Content and Communications Services Pvt. Ltd. (MCCS) which ran the channel STAR News. STAR owned 26% in this joint venture while the Ananda Bazar Patrika group owned 74%. On 16 April 2012, Anandabazar Patrika (ABP) Group announced that they would part ways, allowing the Rupert Murdoch-controlled company to retreat from the news business in India to focus on entertainment. With the split, the eight-year affiliation with the 'Star' brand came to an end. Media Content and Communications (MCCS), the company that owned and operated the news channels, said that after the split, Hindi news channel Star News would be named ABP News, Bengali news channel Star Ananda would become ABP Ananda and the Marathi news channel Star Majha would be called ABP Majha.

Feingold (born June 15, 1899 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; died, March 23, 1982) was a pediatric allergist from California, who proposed in 1973 that salicylates, artificial colors, and artificial flavors cause hyperactivity in children. Hyperactivity is now classified as Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Biography =Education= Dr. Feingold received a BS degree in 1921, and an MD in 1924, from the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He performed his internship at Passavant Hospital, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1924 to 1925. He did a fellowship in Pathology at the University of Göttingen, Germany in 1927. Between 1928 and 1929, he worked under Professor Clemens von Pirquet. =Career= Feingold worked as the house officer at the children's clinic of the University of Vienna, Austria from 1928 to 1929. From 1929 to 1932, he was clinical instructor of Pediatrics at the Northwestern University School of Medicine. From 1932 to 1958, he worked as attending physician in Pediatrics and in Infectious Diseases at Los Angeles County General Hospital, Los Angeles. He also worked as attending physician in Pediatrics at Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, Los Angeles from 1932 to 1941, and at Los Angeles Children's Hospital from 1932 to 1951.

Family The four actors listed here were children, and grandchildren, of Marie Hérve and Joseph Béjart (died 1643), the holder of a small government post. There were 10 children in the family which was very poor and lived in the Marais, then the theatrical quarter of Paris. Four of the children became notable in the acting profession. Madeleine Béjart Madeleine Béjart in Les précieuses ridicules. Madeleine Béjart (8 January 161817 February 1672), was a French actress and theatre director, one of the most famous French stage actors of the 17th-century. Madeleine was the second child of Joseph and Marie-Herve Bejart. She debuted with her elder brother Joseph at the Theatre du Marais and in the provinces in the late 1630s. Madeleine headed a travelling company to which her sister Geneviève (1631–1675) -- who played as Mlle Hervez -- and her brothers belonged, before they joined Molière in forming l'Illustre Théâtre. In 1643 she co-founded, with Molière, the Illustre Théâtre, of which she was co-director. She was described as a skillful administrator with the ability to avoid conflicts among the staff. She could freely choose to perform any of the roles in the plays by Molière. She became famous from her performances in his plays. Gradually, she chose smaller parts and left the main parts to Mademoiselle Du Parc and her daughter Armande Béjart. She had a relationship with Molière. In 1662 Molière married her daughter Armande. This marriage does not seem to have ended her relationship with Molière. She remained with Molière until her death on 17 February 1672. Madeleine had an illegitimate daughter (1638) by an Italian count, and her conduct on her early travels had not been exemplary, but whatever her private relations with Molière may have been, however acrimonious and violent her temper, she and her family remained faithful to his fortunes. She was a tall, handsome blonde, and an excellent actress, particularly in soubrette parts. Among her creations were Marotte in Les Précieuses ridicules, Lisette in L'École des maris, Dorine in Tartuffe. A contemporary, Georges de Scudery, described her: > \\"She was beautiful, she was gallant, she was very intelligent, she sang, she > danced well, she played all kinds of instruments, she wrote very nicely in > verse and prose and her conversation was very entertaining. She was over all > one of the best actresses of her age and her acting had so much charm, that > it really inspired all the feigned passion of the plays one saw her > represent at the Theatre.\\" Madeleine's daughter, Armande (1645-1700) was also a famous actress and married Molière. Joseph Béjart Their brothers included Joseph Béjart (–1659), a strolling player and later a member of Molière's first company (l'Illustre Théatre), accompanying him in his theatrical wanderings, and was with him when he returned permanently to Paris, dying soon after. He created the parts of Lélie in L'Étourdie, and Eraste in Le Dépit amoureux. Louis Béjart Joseph's brother Louis (–1678) was also in Molière's company during the last years of touring. He created many parts in his brother-in-law's plays -- Valère in Le Dépit amoureux, Dubois in Le Misanthrope, Alcantor in Le Mariage forcé, and Don Luis in Le Festin de Pierre -- and was an actor of varied talents. As a result of a wound received when interfering in a street brawl, he became lame and retired in 1670 with a pension, the first ever granted by the company to a comedian.

It is roughly south of downtown Asheville. White water kayaking The Green Narrows is best known for being one of the most extreme kayaking runs in the Eastern US. Water is released on a regular basis from the Tuxedo Power station with a 100% release being equivalent to . This regular flow allows for year- round kayaking and is part of the reason the Green is such a notorious and well known river. The river has an average gradient of 178 feet per mile (33.7 m/km or 3%) with a half mile (800 m) section dropping roughly and containing 11 major class IV+ to V+ rapids. Through this area the water often channels through extremely tight slots as narrow as wide as the river funnels through a stunning gorge. The three major rapids on the river (\\"The Big Three\\") are called \\"Go Left and Die\\", \\"Gorilla\\" and \\"Sunshine\\". Gorilla is considered the most visually impressive rapid on the river. It consists of the river funneling into a -wide slot (\\"The Notch\\") and is then immediately followed by an waterfall (\\"the flume\\") and then another waterfall (\\"Scream Machine\\"). Sunshine is considered the most difficult and dangerous rapid, and consists of a waterfall landing on a jagged rock shelf below. The route through Sunshine is about wide and mistakes here have been known to cause paralysis. The river gets considerably more difficult at higher water levels, however the Green has been run at up to 300% flows (over 30\\" on the stick gauge). On the first Saturday of November many of the best paddlers in the world descend on the Green to participate in the annual Green Race. The race is considered by many as the most competitive and coveted whitewater race on the planet. Since 1996, the staggering amount of video, blog posts, magazine articles, and mega-pixels captured by still cameras at the Green Race can not be estimated, nor can the nervousness of new contestants and the pride of participation. However, it is only for an unknown reason and historical twist of fate that paddlers still have the Green River to enjoy today, for in 1906 it was nearly dammed in four places (instead of the one dam upstream built around 1921). The engineers for the four dam concept were Ladshaw and Ladshaw from Spartanburg, SC, and the now annual celebration of man's mysterious failure to advance is called \\"Ladshaw Day\\". At Ladshaw Day parties across the southeast, paddlers make the toast with no small amount of irony, humor, and gratitude: \\"To Ladshaw!\\".

Origin of the Silver Pit In origin, it is probably a tunnel valley (Benn & Evans fig.9.27) which was kept free of periglacial deposits by the Wash River when the sea level was lower, towards the end of the Devensian glaciation. However, the Silver Pit may date partially or largely from the Wolstonian Stage.

It belongs to the Nymphalidae or brush-footed butterfly family. It has a weak fluttery flight. It is avoided by most insect predators. This species and the yellow coster (Acraea issoria) are the only two Indian representatives of the predominantly African tribe Acraeini. It is found in India, Sri Lanka, Maldives to Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Singapore. Taxonomy There has been long standing debate among taxonomists on whether the correct name for this species is Acraea terpsicore Linnaeus, 1758 or Acraea violae Fabricius, 1775. Pierre and Bernaud stated that they verified the type in the Linnean Society of London and considered A. violae the same species as A. terpsicore. Honey and Scoble argued that both specimens in the Linnean Society are later additions by James Edward Smith who purchased Linnaeus specimens. In the absence of authentic syntypes, the identity of terpsicore remains uncertain although there are chances that they may be synonyms. A. terpsicore was confused with the African species A. eponina Cramer, 1780. Pierre and Bernaud studied this nomenclatural problem and rehabilitate the original name Acraea serena for that species.  Description  = Male = Upperside tawny. Forewing: a transverse black spot in cell, and another irregular, oblique and broader at the discocellulars; a discal series of spots in interspaces 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 10, and the apex and termen black. The upper four spots of the discal series inclined obliquely outwards, the lower two obliquely inwards; the black edging to apex and termen narrowing posteriorly, but with slender linear projections inwards in the interspaces. Hindwing: a basal series of four or five black spots with a similar spot beyond in middle of cell and a subcostal black spot above it, followed by a discal series of obscure blackish spots and a minute postdiscal black dot in interspaces 4 and 6 respectively; finally, a broad black terminal band medially traversed by a series of small spots of the ground colour. Most of the macular black markings are obscure, being only the spots on the underside seen by the transparency of the wing membrane; the inner edge of the black terminal band crenulate. Underside ground colour ochraceous yellow or a paler tawny yellow. Forewing: paling to whitish on the apex, with the black markings as on the upperside but somewhat blurred and diffuse. Hindwing: the black spots and black terminal band as on the upperside, but the spots more clearly defined, none obscure; the series of spots traversing the black terminal margin very much larger and white - not tawny; the base of the wing black, separated from the basal transverse series of black spots by two or three large whitish spots. Antennae black, head and thorax black spotted with ochraceous and white; abdomen anteriorly black, posteriorly ochraceous yellow with narrow transverse black lines; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen ochraceous, the thorax spotted with ochraceous, the abdomen with a longitudinal line of black at base. Female underside = Female = Similar to that of the male. Upperside ground colour duller; the black spots on forewings and hindwings larger, the upper discal spots often coalescing and forming an irregular oblique short band; the black edging to apex and termen on the forewing and the black terminal band on the hindwing proportionately broader, the spots traversing the latter larger and whitish. Underside ground colour much paler and duller markings as on the upperside and, as in the male, the spots on the hindwing better defined than on the upperside. Antennae, bead, thorax and abdomen as in the male. Wingspan of 53–64 mm.  Distribution, habits and habitat  This species does not fly high, but seems to keep within 3 m of the ground and tends to rest on vegetation in the regions of a meter off the ground. Acraea terpsicore can be seen in abundance wherever its larval food plant (Passiflora species) is found. The adult tends to avoid dense undergrowth and shady areas, instead keeping to open spaces in all types of vegetation. sphragis The adult flies slowly with weak seemingly unsteady wing beats. It is one of the boldest butterflies, protected as it is from predators by a nauseous chemical. When attacked it plays dead and exudes a noxious yellowish fluid from glands in the joints of the legs. Like all butterflies protected in this manner, Acraea terpsicore has a tough exoskeleton which enables the adult to survive a few pecks of a bird or even the bites of a lizard. Once left alone the adult immediately takes off and resumes its uncaring flight. When feeding on flowers, this butterfly is unhurried, often spending a long time sitting on the same flower. When sitting it either spreads its wings or closes them over its back the hindwings covering the forewings to a large extent. Sometimes the butterfly will not sit, but rest gently on the flower while feeding, while doing this, to maintain balance, it beats only its forewings while keeping the hindwings completely steady. = Mating plugs = The tawny coster is one of a group of butterflies where females feature a sphragis (copulatory plug) which is formed after a mating session. After males produce the spermatophore, they pass an additional gland secretion (a waxy substance) that spills out of the female's copulatory opening, forming a mating plug that hardens within a few hours for the purpose of preventing further matings.  Life cycle  The butterfly breeds on plants of the family Loganiaceae and species of Passiflora many of which contain toxins that are sequestered by the caterpillars. They have also been noted to feed on the leaves of Hybanthus enneaspermus (Violaceae) in Bengal and on Turnera ulmifolia (Passifloraceae) in Maharashtra. = Eggs = Eggs are laid in batches of anywhere between 20 and 100. Eggs are yellow and slightly elongated and tall and display shallow transverse ribbing. = Larva = The fully grown caterpillar is about in length. It is reddish brown on the upperside and a yellowish white on the underside. Each body segment bears a number of branched spines. The head is reddish. The caterpillars of a batch tend to feed gregariously and devour all soft tissue of the host plant. In this manner they can become a major menace to the passion flower plant they are feeding on. Like the adults, the caterpillar is protected by the toxins, processed from the Passiflora species. \\"Cylindrical, slender, with six longitudinal rows of fine branched spines; colour reddish brown with an oily gloss, much paler on the head, second and last segment; an unwholesome looking insect, doubtless protected like the butterfly.\\" (Davidson & Aitken) = Pupa = The pupa boldly marked with aposematic colours, advertising the fact that this is an unwholesome object if eaten. It is white with thick black lines, spots and markings in red and orange. The pupa hangs freely from the support without the aid of a band. The pupa is long. \\"Perpendicularly hung, long, slender, smooth; two lateral angles on the thorax; head quadrate; colour creamy white, with broad longitudinal bars of purplish-black spotted with orange.\\" (Davidson & Aitken.)

Description Fulgora laternaria can reach a length of , with a wingspan up to . This insect has a protuberance at its head as long as , looking like a peanut and showing false eyes to resemble that of a lizard or a serpent. The insect was originally - and mistakenly - believed to be luminescent. When attacked, it protects itself by displaying large, yellow, fake eyes on its hind wings to frighten the aggressor, and releases a foul- smelling substance. Adults can be found from June to December. They feed on the sap of plants, mainly from some trees as Hymenaea courbaril, Simarouba amara and Zanthoxylum species. It will generally remain camouflaged on a tree trunk during the day. It will knock its head on a hollow tree to create vibrations for mates. It will lay its eggs on the Hymenaea courbaril or quapinol tree, and coat them in a waxy substance for protection. Several very similar species in the genus occur from Central to South America, and many museum and commercial specimens identified as laternaria are actually other species. Distribution and habitat This species inhabits tropical forests in Mexico, Central America and South America.  History  In the 1970s, a Colombian reporter on a trip to Putumayo Department wrote a chronicle about this insect, and related the folk tale that if it bites you, it would cause death unless the affected person practiced a sexual act within 24 hours. Although this species is not venomous, the publication of this text in a national magazine gave notoriety to both the author and the claim.

These smaller appendages are covered with long hairs, giving them the characteristic brush look. Description =Wet-season form= Male: Upperside brownish ochraceous. Forewings and hindwings crossed by slender, somewhat obscure, very sinuous or zigzag dark basal, two subbasal and two discal lines disposed in pairs, followed by a single, sometimes double, postdiscal and a single subterminal slender line. All these lines more or less interrupted anteriorly on the hindwing, which has a smooth unmarked uniform appearance from costa to subcostal vein and vein 5. On the forewing there is in addition a series of obscure spots between the postdiscal and subterminal markings, arid a small white subcostal spot before the apex. Underside much as in Ariadne ariadne, but the transverse chestnut bands broader, more diffuse. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brownish ochraceous. Sex-mark on the underside of the forewing as in A. ariadne no sex-mark on upperside of hindwing. Female: Similar; but on the upperside the transverse lines broader, more diffuse, with a greater tendency to form bands; the postdiscal line always double, forming a band traversed by a series of dark ochraceous spots in the interspaces; these lines and bands continuous, not interrupted anteriorly on the hindwing as they are in the male. Underside: except for the sex-mark, as in the male. =Dry- season form= Upperside: ground colour much paler, the transverse lines more distinctly in pairs, forming bands, the ground colour between each pair more dusky brown. Underside similar to that in the wet-season form, but the ground colour paler, the bands more diffuse. Wingspan 52–62 mm. Distribution All over India, Simla to Sikkim in the Himalayas, and recorded from Rajputana and Bengal; Assam; Cambodia, Myanmar; Tenasserim; Malayan subregion. The Tenasserim specimens are darker and often without the white subcostal spot in the forewing, approximating thus to the southern Indian and Ceylon race.

It is known for its large but elegant appearance and is usually gray, although chestnut and black are also allowed by the French breed registry. Originally there were several sub-types, but they were crossbred until only one is seen today. The breed's origins trace to a period before the Crusades and, during the 17th century, Spanish Barb, Arabian, and Andalusian blood were added to create the modern type. During the early 1900s, the Boulonnais were imported in large numbers to the United States and were quite popular in France; however, the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th-century wars. The breed nearly became extinct following World War II, but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for horse meat. Breed numbers remain low; it is estimated that fewer than 1,000 horses remain in Europe, mostly in France, with a few in other nations. Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population, and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should be a priority for conservation within France. The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, while the larger varieties performed heavy draft work, both on farms and in the cities. The Boulonnais was also crossbred to create and refine several other draft breeds.  Breed characteristics  The characteristic facial profile of the breed The Boulonnais today stands from or more. It has a short, elegant head with a broad forehead and a short, muscular neck. Members of the breed have full chests, rounded rib cages and sloping shoulders. The legs are fairly short but robust and strong. Unlike other draft breeds such as the Shire or Clydesdale, it has no heavy feathering on its lower legs. The breed is generally branded with a small anchor mark on the left side of the neck. Due mostly to the many additions of Oriental blood, the Boulonnais has an elegant appearance that is not often seen in heavy draft breeds and it has been called \\"Europe's noblest draft horse\\".Edwards, pp. 264–265. The fineness of the skin and delicate appearance of the veins has allowed the horse to be described as looking \\"like polished marble\\", leading to its \\"White Marble Horse\\" nickname. In 1778, the French National Stud performed an initial survey of the breed and found that most were black or dark bay. During the 1800s, gray horses began to appear, and it was the predominating color by the end of the century. Gray became a popular color during this time due to the use of the horses to haul fish at night – gray horses were more visible in the dark, and therefore more valuable. In the later years of the 20th century, breeders again began to prefer darker colors such as bay and chestnut. Today, chestnut, gray and black are the only colors allowed by the French breed registry, with the vast majority of horses being gray – a popular phrase says that the horses have coats \\"the color of the clouds from the coast\\". = Sub-types = There were originally several types of Boulonnais. The Petit Boulonnais, Mareyeuse or Mareyeur was used in the rapid transport of cartloads of fresh fish (la marée) from the Pas-de-Calais to Paris; it stood and weighed . The Picard draft came from the Picardy region,Moll & Gayot, p. 524. and was called the \\"horse of the bad land\\", in comparison to the Cauchoix horse from the Pays de Caux area, which was called the \\"horse of the good land\\". The \\"grand Boulonnais\\", which stood high and weighed , was bred in the 19th century for farm work in the sugar beet fields. All of these types were bred together to create the modern Boulonnais horse.  History  Engraving of a Boulonnais, 1861 One theory states that the origins of the Boulonnais breed emerged from the crossbreeding of native French mares and stallions brought by the Numidian army in 55–54 BC. However, many equine scholars are skeptical of this theory, and state that, whatever the early origins, the later selective breeding and local climate and soil types had a greater influence on the breed than any early Oriental blood.Mavré, p. 40. During the Crusades, two breeders, Eustache, Comte de Boulogne, and later Robert, Comte d'Artois, wanted to create a fast, agile, and strong warhorse for knights to ride in battle. They crossed the existing heavy French stallions with German Mecklenberg mares, similar to modern-day Hanoverians. During the 17th-century Spanish occupation of Flanders, a mixture of Spanish Barb, Arabian, and Andalusian blood was added to the breed, to create the modern Boulonnais. By the 17th century, horse dealers were coming into the Boulonnais district from Picardy and Upper Normandy to buy local horses, which enjoyed a good reputation among breeders. From the late 18th through the mid-19th century, the Boulonnais spread across France and Europe; during this time, the breed increased in size as the Industrial Revolution called for larger horses that retained the active movement of the original type.Mavré, p. 41; Beginning in the 1830s, it was proposed to cross the Arabian with the Boulonnais to create a new type of cavalry horse, and in the 1860s, calls were put forth to add Thoroughbred blood for the same reason.; Moll & Gayot, p. 526. However, breeders rejected these calls, stating that using the breed to create cavalry horses would make them poorer draft horses.Moll & Gayot, p. 527. Breed societies also discouraged crosses between the Boulonnais and the Brabant. In June 1886, a studbook was created for the breed in France, and placed under the jurisdiction of the Syndicat Hippique Boulonnais (SHB) in 1902.Collective, p. 110. During the early 20th century, the Boulonnais was imported into the United States in large numbers, where it was registered along with other French heavy horse breeds as the \\"French draft horse\\". Breed members in the United States were registered with the Anglo- Norman Horse Association (or National Norman Horse Association) beginning in 1876, an association that was renamed the National French Draft Association in 1885. This association declared in 1876 that the Boulonnais, Norman, Percheron and Picardy breeds were all essentially the same, and should all be known as the \\"Norman horse\\". They later declared that all of the \\"Norman horses\\" were in fact \\"Percherons\\", regardless of actual breeding. This was mostly designed to sell mixed breed draft horses to American consumers at higher prices, and the Illinois Board of Agriculture soon ruled that only those Percherons who came from proven Percheron stock were to be registered as such, and all other breeds, including the Boulonnais, were to be considered separately. Boulonnais were exported from France to Austria, although they saw little success there, and breeding stallions were sent to Argentina. = 20th century and today = in-hand, 2011 The Boulonnais was once a popular workhorse in France, with an estimated population of over 600,000 in the early 1900s. World War I and World War II almost destroyed the breed, as its home area saw heavy combat in both wars and the bands of broodmares were scattered. Between World War II and the 1970s, the breed almost became extinct, and only a few breeders kept it alive. In the 1970s, it became popular for horse meat, and consumers considered it to be some of the best meat available. However, by this point, there were fewer than 1,000 mares remaining. During the mid-20th century, the stallions Fréthun (foaled in 1949), Select (1962), Trésor (1963), Astérix (1966) and Prince (1981) had a strong influence on the breed, although this contributed to the problem of inbreeding. Fréthun genes are found in 14 percent of the pedigrees of Boulonnais living today. In the early 1970s, Henry Blanc, the newly appointed director of the French National Stud, proposed that nine draft horse breeds, including the Boulonnais, be recategorized from pulling horses to meat horses. When enacted, this recategorization helped to preserve the gene pool of the Boulonnais by encouraging breeding, but it also changed its primary purpose, resulting in a dramatic weight increase by the 1980s.Mavré, p. 150. The Boulonnais is still bred in small numbers, with the American Boulonnais Horse Association estimating a population of fewer than 1,000 animals remaining in Europe. Many studs are government-funded, to prevent the breed from dying out. The majority of the breed, 95 percent, are located in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Normandy regions and 75 percent in just the Pas-de- Calais department of Nord-Pas-de-Calais alone. Although most Boulonnais are in France, a few are exported. In 1999, fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina. On average, a little over a dozen horses a year are exported, mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for forestry work. A few horses live in the Netherlands, Switzerland and Luxembourg, as well as in North America. Since 2006, twenty horses, including two registry-approved breeding stallions, have been exported from France to Denmark to create a stud farm in that country. The French national stud, the Haras Nationaux, allows the registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, but does not allow the registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity in the breed.  Uses  Boulonnais horses at pasture in Le Titre, Somme, France During the 17th century, the smaller Mareyeuse type was used for transporting fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris, a distance of almost 200 miles, in under 18 hours. This journey is remembered annually in the Route du Poisson race. Only mares pulled small carts full of ice and fish on the relay-style trip. By 1884, the Boulonnais was called the \\"largest and most valuable of that kind of horse in France\\". At that time, they were used to move heavy blocks of building stone in Paris, with six to eight horses drawing blocks of several tons. During the 20th century, the larger Boulonnais type was utilized by the French army, and highly regarded for its ability to pull artillery and supply wagons. Falling demand for the breed means that today it is bred mainly for horsemeat. In 2010, 60 percent of Boulonnais horses bred in France were intended for slaughter, and 80 percent of these were exported, mainly to Italy, to be fattened before being sent to slaughterhouses. However, the sector is in crisis due to falling prices, controversy and the importation of cheap meat;Collective, p. 111. despite a resurgence following the Mad Cow scares of the 1990s, the consumption of horse meat has fallen sharply, although the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region remains the largest consumer of horse meat in France. The Boulonnais provided part of the base for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play a large role in the creation of the Selle Français. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft,Edwards, p. 258. the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse,Edwards, p. 275. and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection.

He was known for his plunger mute technique and wrote an instructional book called Plunger Techniques. Career Al Grey, the last great big time plunger by Gwendolyn Lanier-Gardner, 2015 Al Grey was born in Aldie, Virginia and grew up in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. During World War II he served in the U.S. Navy, where he started playing the trombone. Soon after his discharge, he joined Benny Carter's band, then the bands of Jimmie Lunceford, Lucky Millinder, and Lionel Hampton. In the 1950s he was a member of the big bands of Dizzy Gillespie and Count Basie. He led bands in the 1960s with Billy Mitchell and Jimmy Forrest. Later in life he recorded with Clark Terry and J. J. Johnson. Grey's early trombone style was inspired by Trummy Young. He developed a wild, strong and full sound. Solos often consisted of short, pronounced phrases with precisely timed syncopation. When playing with the plunger, however, he would produce the most mellow fill-ins and shape melodic answers to the lead voice. This aspect of his playing can be heard to great effect in response to Bing Crosby's vocals on the 1972 album Bing 'n' Basie. He died in Phoenix at the age of 74. He had been suffering from a number of ailments, including diabetes.http://www.mtv.com/news/820205/trombonist-al-grey-dies-at-74/  Discography  =As leader/co-leader= * Dizzy Atmosphere (Specialty, 1957) * The Last of the Big Plungers (Argo 1960) * The Thinking Man's Trombone (Argo, 1961) * The Al Grey - Billy Mitchell Sextet (Argo, 1962) * Snap Your Fingers (Argo, 1962) * Having a Ball (Argo, 1963) * Boss Bone (Argo, 1964) * Night Song (Argo, 1963) * Shades of Grey (Tangerine, 1965) * Grey's Mood (Black and Blue, 1979) * Get It Together (Pizza Express, 1979) * O.D.

It flies with stiff wing beats and often glides. The wing is not flapped very far below the horizontal. Description The male is brown with slight traces of olive. The forewing has two transverse short black lines at the base, a black loop across the middle, and another beyond the apex of the cell, with their centres dark brown, followed by an angulated discal dark brown band bordered outwardly by a series of five white spots; two preapical white spots beyond and a broad, somewhat diffuse, subterminal black band broadening over the apex and angulated inwards in interspace 1. Hindwing shaded with dark brown at base, two crescent-shaped dark brown loop-like marks in cell; a discal series of dark brown, elongate, outwardly acute, inwardly diffuse, somewhat hastate (spear-shaped) spots, followed by a subterminal series of small spots of the same colour. Underside ochraceous brown. Forewing on the underside shows five transverse slender black lines across cell; a black spot below median vein; discal and preapical white spots as on the upperside, succeeded by a postdiscal series of somewhat diffuse crescent-shaped black marks, and a broad terminal pale lilac band not reaching the apex, bordered narrowly along the termen with dark brown. Hindwing with four or five slender black loops at base, a posteriorly obsolescent postdiscal series of diffuse black marks and a subterminal series of black dots; the termen near apex touched with pale lilac. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, the antennae ochraceous at the tip, the body paler beneath. The female is similar but of a paler shade. Upperside forewing differs from that of the male in the absence of the dark discal and subterminal bands, and in the series of discal spots being elongate, much larger. The hindwing has the discal series of outwardly pointed black markings only as traces. Underside similar to that of the male, but the ground colour more ochraceous, the markings larger, more diffuse. Race vasanta, Moore is found in Sri Lanka. It resembles the nominate race, but in the male the white spots on the forewing are entirely absent, above and below; the discal hand on both forewing and hindwing on the upperside is more irregular and not nearly so well defined; on the forewing the interspace between it and the subterminal band and on the hindwing the posterior half suffused with dark green 5 the terminal margin of the fore and anterior half of the hindwing tinged with pink. Underside similar, but both the ground colour and markings paler; the latter less prominent. Female. Differs prominently on both upper and under sides in the discal row of white spots being more oblique and complete, extending from the costa to near the apex of interspace 2. Race acontius is found in the Andaman Islands. The wingspan is 68–79 mm.

Habits Sun loving and avoids shade. Seen in the plains, gardens, and edges of clearings. Has active and sharp flight movements. Visits flowers regularly especially Lantana, Duranta, Meyenia laxiflora, Gymnosporia montana, and thistles. Often seen mudpuddling from damp patches in the ground, either alone or in groups. A regular basker with wings spread wide open. It is commonest in dry areas and dry weather and absent from the wetter parts of India during the monsoon. It often perches on edges of clearing with wings half open and has the habit of chasing away other butterflies and guarding its territory.

Founded in 1913, it became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1993. The coeducational Cercetașii României has 3,500 members as of 2014. History 140px Romania was a founding member of the WOSM, having formally had Scouts between 1913 and 1937. Influenced by reading Baden-Powell's \\"Scouting for Boys\\", the first informal patrol of Boy Scouts was established in Romania in 1913 at Gheorghe Lazăr High School by Dimitrie Dimăncescu, his brother, Ioan, and classmates. Prince Carol would become the first formal troop leader. Others joined in broadening awareness of the Scout movement (Gheorghe Munteanu-Murgoci, Alexandru Borza, Vladimir Ghidionescu, Constantin Costa-Foru, Nicolae Iorga, Ion G. Duca and Colonel Grigore Berindeihttp://cercetasia.blogspot.jp/2013/02/grigore-berindei.html) who became familiar with the Scout movements in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Germany. The translation of Baden-Powell's book Scouting for Boys into Romanian was published in 1915. That same year saw the official founding of the Cercetaşii României; on the occasion, Lord Baden-Powell sent a message of congratulations, with the admonition that Scouting should be adapted to the local situation. Membership grew quickly across Romania. During World War I, Romanian Scouts were very active in defense activities. Ecaterina Teodoroiu guided a patrol of Scouts and Guides and was employed as a nurse, before joining the Romanian Army and dying a heroine. Many Scouts who helped the transporting of the wounded were killed during the air attacks. On September 29, 1916, Baden-Powell sent a message expressing regret to the Scouts for the death of their fellows. At the end of the war, the Boy Scouts marched in the front of the Victory Train, under the Triumphal Arch in Bucharest. In 1920, 67 Romanian Boy Scouts and their leaders were present at the first World Jamboree in London, England. Before World War II, the Scout Movement developed further: many patrols were formed in towns and in villages, many camps, socials, expeditions and spectacles were organized, and a great number of magazines, literary writings and pedagogical studies were published for Scouts and their Chiefs. At the time, one of the devoted Boy Scouts was the philosopher Mircea Eliade. In 1930, the first Romanian Scout Jamboree took place, in the presence of Hubert Martin and many delegations of Scouts and Guides from other countries. Cercetașii României had 45,000 members at that point, and the Guides Movement had 14,000. The organizer and Chief of the Guides Movement was Princess Ileana, the daughter of Queen Marie. With the growing influenced of fascism in the 1930s, Romanian Scouting officially preserved its apolitical character, only to be replaced in 1937 by a totalitarian organization, Străjeria (Straja Țării), as part of the dictatorial measures initiated by King Carol II (alongside the creation of the National Renaissance Front). Straja Țării withdrew from the International Scout Conference the same year. John S. Wilson signed and agreement in March 1939 of interchange of visits and permit the Straja Țării participate in Scout Conferences as observers and to attend courses at Gilwell Park but subsequent events cancelled this agreement.S. Wilson, John (1959). Scouting Round the World. London: Blandford Press Ltd. p. 158. After World War II, there were attempts to restore the Scout Movement in Romania, but the emergence of the communist regime brought a ban on all alternative youth movements, replaced by the Pioneer Organization and Union of Communist Youth. After the Revolution of 1989, former Scouts and others acted for the revival of Scouting in Romania. Cercetașii României was again established in 1991, and in 1993 gained recognition by the World Bureau of the WOSM. But in 2006, there are only 2,000 registered Scouts.

J. Cherryh is a collection of science fiction and fantasy short stories, novelettes and novella written by the United States author C. J. Cherryh between 1977 and 2004. It was first published by DAW Books in 2004. This collection includes the contents of two previous Cherryh collections, Sunfall (1981) and Visible Light (1986), all of the stories from Glass and Amber (1987), stories originally published in other collections and magazines, and one story written specifically for this collection (\\"MasKs\\"). Cherryh's 1978 Hugo Award winning story, \\"Cassandra\\" is also included. The Collected Short Fiction of C. J. Cherryh was voted the second best collection in the 2005 Locus Awards. Background C. J. Cherryh is best known for her science fiction and fantasy novels. Short story writing is an art she never considered until she had several novels published. The compactness and limited characterisation of the short story form did not lend itself well to Cherryh's precise and complex novel construction methodologies. In spite of this, she has proved herself quite capable of working in this medium and this collection as a whole has been well received by critics. \\"Cassandra\\" won her a Hugo Award, was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story and the Locus Award for best short story, and in 1999 was named as one of Locus magazine's 50 best science fiction short stories of all time. Additionally, \\"A Thief in Korianth\\" won the 1982 Balrog Award for best short fiction, \\"The Scapegoat\\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novella and \\"Gwydion and the Dragon\\" was nominated for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novella. While novels are still her preferred medium, she does enjoy the chance to write short stories, doing so mostly when requested or between other works when a given idea does not lend itself to a novel. The collection contains almost all the short stories she had published through 2004, with the exception of those published in the various shared world anthologies to which she has contributed. Contents This collection is divided into three sections: Sunfall (stories from Cherryh's Sunfall collection plus a new story, \\"MasKs\\"), Visible Light (stories from Cherryh's Visible Light collection) and Other Stories (stories from other collections and magazines).

Sunfall is a collection of stories set in the far future on an ancient Earth under a dying Sun that is emitting dangerous levels of radiation. Each story deals with a city and how it has evolved to cope with the fading Sun. Paris and New York City have become single self-contained structures with no \\"outside\\". In \\"The Only Death in the City (Paris)\\" this closed biosphere has resulted in no \\"new births\\": everyone who dies is reincarnated again in the city with all the memories of their previous lives.

Biography One of nine children, Ralph Tucker was born in Hymera, Indiana. Tucker's father died when the young Ralph was three years old. His mother, left to support nine children alone, placed Ralph in an orphanage, where he would live until he was nearly ten years old. He would later live with an older sister. When Tucker reached adulthood, he moved to Chicago, where he became a salesman and met the woman who would become his wife, Virginia. They were wed in 1936. Also that year, the young couple moved back to Terre Haute, where Tucker worked for radio station WBOW. In 1938, Tucker was elected city clerk, but he served only one term in this first elected office. He was defeated in the 1942 election, but his political career was far from over. When the popular mayor of Terre Haute, sporting goods dealer Vernon R. McMillan, declined to seek re-election in 1947, Tucker threw his hat into the ring, narrowly escaping in the Democratic primary, but once past that obstacle, he won handily in the general election. Controversy swirled at times throughout his 20-year reign as the city's mayor. Unemployment ballooned and the city's reputation took hits from inside and outside the state, some saying the city's old, early-1900s nickname of \\"Sin City\\" still stuck. Regardless, Terre Haute's citizenry re-elected Tucker in 1951, 1955, 1959 and 1963. It could have been different, though, had 1956 not been an overwhelmingly Republican year for political victory. Against the odds, Tucker was chosen as the Democratic candidate for Indiana governor in the 1956 election, but he lost in a landslide to the sitting Republican lieutenant governor, Harold Handley. Like many Republicans that year, Handley rode into office on the coattails of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who easily won a second term in that election. In 1967, Tucker decided not to seek a sixth term as mayor. He left office at the beginning of 1968 and started his own public relations firm. Later, he became president of the Terre Haute Area Chamber of Commerce. Sadly, Ralph Tucker died after a long battle with cancer at the age of 71, on November 21, 1977. His funeral was the second of a prominent Terre Haute resident in the span of a month; Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Hulman & Co. owner Tony Hulman had died some three weeks earlier. 1906 births 1977 deaths Mayors of Terre Haute, Indiana Indiana Republicans Deaths from cancer in Indiana ","title":"Ralph Tucker"},{"id":"2985322","text":"Luxor Air was a charter airline based in Cairo, Egypt.

The tamarind plant originated in Africa but has since been widely distributed on a global scale and is commonly found in tropical regions. The tamarind plant produces fruit pods containing pulp and seeds. Tamarind is a versatile ingredient that is used for a variety of commercial, culinary and medicinal purposes with the pulp being the most commonly used part of the tamarind plant, used in a range of beverages including tamarindo and other similar beverages such as Nam Ma Kham Wan in Thailand and Poha Beer in Ghana. Tamarind pulp offers a flavour that ranges from sour to sweet, making tamarindo a sour-sweet beverage (dependent on the amount of sugar added) recognised as a popular flavour of aguas frescas, which is traditionally consumed in Latin America. Comprising only three ingredients, tamarindo involves a simple production process making it an easy beverage to prepare at home. Tamarindo has been produced commercially as a soda flavour, by companies such as Jarritos and Nestle, and distributed globally.  History  Tamarind tree The tamarind plant has origins in Africa where it has been commonly utilised as a shade tree. In the 4th century BC tamarind was common among the Greeks and ancient Egyptians and has since been distributed and cultivated in over 50 countries worldwide, notably in Asia (in particular the Indian subcontinent), and Latin America. During the 16th century tamarind was introduced into Mexico where it became commonly used as a flavour of aguas frescas. Aguas frescas are a type of non-alcoholic beverage, comprising water, sugar and one or more seasonal fruits, seeds, cereals or flowers which are sold primarily in Mexico and other Latin American countries and have since been introduced into the United States. Aguas frescas are commonly sold at street vendors as well as at restaurants and taquerias and are traditionally served from an authentic Mexican glass dispenser (a vitrolero) with a ladle and poured over ice. Aguas frescas are beverages typically enjoyed with meals or as a refreshing beverage (usually consumed in the warmer months). Tamarindo is one of the many popular flavours of aguas frescas, alongside other flavours such as horchata and hibiscus.  Ingredients  Tamarindo consists of a combination of 3 ingredients: tamarind, water and sugar. = Tamarind = Tamarind pods, fruit and seeds Tamarind pods The primary ingredient of tamarindo, tamarind (also known as Tamarindus indica L), is a legume, part of the family Fabaceae. Tamarind grows on tamarind trees which are typically found in tropical regions and grow to 24 meters high on average. The trees produce fruit in abundance, on average, for 50 to 60 years but can live for over 200 years. Tamarind trees produce brown fruit pods that enclose one to twelve reddish-brown seeds as well as pulp. High levels of tartaric acid makes tamarind fruit highly acidic, this acid is also a common component of other sour fruits such as raspberries and grapes. Depending on the ripeness of the tamarind fruit the taste of the pulp can range from sour to sweet, the more ripe the tamarind fruit, the sweeter it tastes due to increased sugar levels that balance out the proportion of tartaric acid. The pulp is the most commonly extracted part of the tamarind plant. Tamarind pulp contains high proportions of carbohydrates (41.1 to 61.4 grams per 100 grams) and low levels of fat (0.6 grams per 100 grams) and is high in various vitamins and minerals, including potassium (62 to 570 milligrams per 100g), calcium (81 to 466 milligrams per 100 grams) and phosphorus (86 to 190 milligrams per 100 grams). Tamarind seeds are also utilised as a food source as they contain high levels of protein (26.9 grams per 100 grams) and oil (10.9 grams per 100 grams) and in some countries, tamarind seeds are used as an emergency food because of their high protein levels. The leaves of the tamarind plant are high in calcium and protein and have been consumed by domestic animals and wild animals, including elephants, as a fodder.  Production  Mature and protected tamarind trees can produce up to 150 to 225 kilograms of tamarind fruit per year, however on average, tamarind trees produce between 30 and 50 kilograms of fruit annually. The tamarind fruit is most commonly produced in its sour form and accounts for 95% of tamarind production worldwide with India (in particular the states of Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Karnataka) and Thailand being the largest Asian producers of tamarind and Mexico as the largest producer of tamarind in the Western hemisphere. The majority of African countries do not produce tamarind commercially, but it is commonly utilised by the local people. The pharmaceutical industry in America is responsible for processing 100 tonnes of tamarind pulp annually.  Uses  Most parts of the tamarind tree (including the wood, bark, flowers, leaves, pulp and seeds) are used for a variety of commercial, culinary and medicinal purposes. = Commercial uses = Tamarind trees are used as shade trees and ornamental trees (common along highways and in parks). Tamarind seeds are used in the production of tamarind kernel powder which is used as a sizing agent in the textile industry because of its ability to absorb water and swell up, in India, tamarind kernel powder has also been used as a sizing agent in the production of cotton. In Bengal, tamarind seeds are used in the production of an oil used in varnishes. The wood of the tamarind plant is used in carpentry (such as making furniture and wheels) and the leaves and flowers are used as a setting agent for dyes. = Culinary uses = Tamarind pulp is the most common part of the tamarind plant utilised for culinary purposes, being used in a range of chutneys, curries, sauces (such as Worcestershire sauce and barbecue sauce) and beverages (such as tamarindo). In Sri Lanka tamarind pulp has been used as a lime alternative and in Sengel the pulp is mixed with sugar to produce sweet meats known as ‘bengal’. In India tamarind pulp is made into a juice used in the preservation of fish and in many countries of East Africa the pulp is used in the making of a dish called ‘ugali’ (a type of maize flour porridge). Tamarind fruits have been utilised in the production of tamarind syrup in Puerto Rico which is used by street vendors to flavour shaved ice. The seeds of the tamarind plant are also used for culinary purposes but the whole seed cannot be directly consumed and need to be soaked and boiled in water before they are edible. The seeds are commonly used in jellies, marmalades and jams because they contain pectin which gives them ‘jelly forming properties’ and have also been used as a stabiliser in the production of cheese, ice cream and mayonnaise. In Indonesia, after the seeds have been roasted, they are consumed as a snack accompanied with salt and grated coconut and in Thailand tamarind seeds are used as a coffee alternative. = Medicinal uses = Different parts of the tamarind plant have been used globally for various medicinal purposes. In the northern parts of Nigeria, the roots of the tamarind plant are used to treat leprosy and in America tamarind pulp has been utilised as a laxative and to treat a range of ailments such as alleviating sunstroke and sore throats. In Thailand the pulp has been transformed into a tablet to reduce excess weight and in Brazil the pulp is used for its moisturising effects. The pulp has also been used in traditional medicine to treat colds, diarrhoea and to reduce inflammation. Tamarind seeds have been used in powdered form to aid dysentery in India and Cambodia and in Ethiopia softened tamarind seeds are used to rid parasitic worms. The bark of the tamarind tree is used to treat malaria in Uganda and has been made into lotions in the Philippines to treat ulcers and boils.  Production  There are different variations of tamarindo, however it is typically made by shelling the tamarind pods and adding them to boiling water. The pods are left to soak for approximately 45 minutes then the seeds are removed from the pods which leaves the pulp that is then strained through a sieve and blended with water and sugar. Store bought tamarind pulp can be used as an alternative to minimise the time required to prepare the tamarind pods. Once the ingredients are combined the beverage is served over ice. This process typically takes between 45 minutes to an hour to complete, but is dependent on if store bought tamarind pulp is used or how long the tamarind pods are left to soak. In the commercial production of tamarindo the beverage is carbonated, making it similar to a soft drink. The use of tamarind pulp in tamarindo makes the beverage a good source of potassium, calcium and carbohydrates and contains high levels of Vitamin B (Vitamin B1 - thiamine and Vitamin B3 - niacin) and small amounts of Vitamin C.  Producers  Street vendors selling Aguas FrescasTamarindo is traditionally sold at street vendors throughout Latin America.Muñoz, L. (2015). Selling memory and nostalgia in the Barrio. In K. Graaff, & N. Ha (Ed.) Street vending in the neoliberal city : A global perspective on the practices and policies of a marginalized economy. New York, NY: Berghahn Books. Street vendors play an important role in Latin American culture as they comprise a significant portion of the informal economy and are responsible for providing many employment opportunities for local people. Street vendors typically sell food, beverages, clothing and other daily use items and have become introduced into the United States by immigrants as a way to reproduce experiences similar to that in their home countries. Tamarindo, along with various other flavours of aguas frescas, are common products sold at street vendors, taquerias and restaurants in both Latin America and the United States. Tamarindo is now commercially produced by a range of companies, such as Jarritos and Nestle, and distributed globally. Jarritos is a Mexican soft drink brand that was established in 1950 and has since been distributed into the United States and internationally. Jarritos offers a range of flavours alongside Tamarindo, including Mandarin, Lime and Guava. Global food and beverage company, Nestle, introduced three Latin American inspired flavours into the United States in 2011 which included Tamarindo, Horchata and Jamaica.  Variations  There are a range of beverages, similar to tamarindo, that utilise tamarind as the primary component. = Poha Beer = Poha Beer is a tamarind based beverage, composed primarily of tamarind pulp in addition to spices, such as ginger and peppercorn, commonly consumed in Ghana. The preparation of Poha Beer involves seven key stages including: threshing (removal of the outer covering of the fruit), fermenting (the fruit is covered in water and left to ferment), moulding (the fruit is moulded into balls), soaking (the pulp is extracted by leaving the fruits to soak in warm or cold water), mashing (the fruits are mashed to extract more pulp), decanting (the removal of unwanted materials) and spicing (spices, such as ginger and peppercorns, are added to flavour). = Nam Ma Kham Wan = Nam Ma Kham Wan is a popular beverage consumed in Thailand made with tamarind pulp, water, salt and sugar. The tamarind pulp is mixed and blended with water then boiled. Salt and sugar are then added to the mixture which is then cooled and served over ice. = Nuoc Da Me = Nuoc Da Me is a tamarind based beverage typically consumed in Vietnam. It is a simple drink to make involving tamarind pulp being mixed with sugar and water which is then served over a glass filled with ice, water and any type of nut (usually peanuts). = Imli Ka Amlana = Imli Ka Amlana is a tamarind based beverage consumed in India made by combining various spices (usually black salt, black pepper, cardamom powder and cumin powder) and sugar with tamarind pulp and serving it chilled over ice. Imli Ka Amlana was made available for commercial consumption by Paper Boats but the product has now since been discontinued.

He served as Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of South Australia and also in the Australian Senate. Since his death in 1960, every South Australian Labor leader since then has served as Premier of South Australia. Early life Born in Yanyarrie in outback South Australia, the Irish Catholic O'Halloran was educated at public schools before leaving to work on his parents' farm aged 13. Politics O'Halloran joined the ALP at 15 and was first elected to the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral district of Burra Burra at the 1918 election. He lost the seat at the 1921 election, but regained it at the 1924 election. He also made an astute move in 1924 by marrying Mary Frances Rowe on 14 August 1924. They had no children, but Mary would act as O'Halloran's electorate officer and advisor for the remainder of his political life. Following his defeat at the 1927 election, O'Halloran worked as an organiser for the Labor Party until his election to the Senate at the 1928 federal election. He served as the Deputy Opposition Leader in the Senate from 1932 until his defeat at the 1934 federal election. After a failed bid to re- enter the Senate at the 1937 federal election, O'Halloran returned to state parliament at the 1938 election, as the member for Frome, based around the area north of Port Pirie. An eccentric, O'Halloran forbade any Labor people to enter Frome or campaign there and it became known as his personal fiefdom. Despite this, or possibly because of this, O'Halloran comfortably retained Frome for the rest of his life, and succeeded Robert Richards as Leader of the Opposition on 10 October 1949. In the process he became the first Catholic to lead the South Australian Labor Party. During his eleven years as ALP leader, O'Halloran lost four consecutive elections to the Sir Thomas Playford IV led Liberal and Country League. The ALP won the primary vote in each of these elections, and actually won a majority of the two-party vote at the 1953 election. However, it was locked out of power due to a grossly malapportioned electoral system known as the Playmander. While Adelaide was (with few exceptions) an ALP stronghold, under the Playmander there were two rural electorates for one electorate in Adelaide. The 1953 election illustrated how grossly distorted the Playmander had become by this time. Labor won 53 percent of the two-party vote to the LCL's 47 percent. In a fairer electoral system, this would have been enough to make O'Halloran Premier with a solid majority. However, due to the rural weighting, the LCL won 21 seats to Labor's 14, just barely enough for the LCL to govern alone. Nevertheless, O'Halloran's leadership of the party remained unchallenged during this time. O'Halloran used his influence within the ALP to support H.V. Evatt as federal ALP leader. Notwithstanding his own Catholicism, he resisted overtures to join the Catholic-dominated Democratic Labor Party, ensuring that the South Australian branch of the ALP remained free from the splits that occurred in Victoria and Queensland. O'Halloran had a very good working relationship with Playford, which would be unthinkable in today's climate of adversarial politics. Sharp philosophical differences (Playford was a liberal conservative, O'Halloran was a trade-union socialist) did not prevent the two men from being friends. They dined together each week to discuss Playford's future plans for South Australia. In response, Playford would regularly, and publicly, call attention to the important role O'Halloran played in the running of the state, while O'Halloran once described Playford as \\"the best Labor Premier South Australia ever had\\". For this continued rapport, both men had good reasons. Many of Playford's ideas were socialistic by the standards of the time (such as the development of government-owned electricity boards) and as such were anathema to his conservative colleagues. Since the LCL never held more than 23 seats during Playford's tenure, he often required Labor support to get many of these policies past his own party's right wing. O'Halloran, meanwhile, realised that with the Playmander in place, Labor had little chance of winning office in its own right. Maintaining cordial dealings with Playford was thus the ideal way to ensure that ALP-friendly legislation was passed. This partnership meant that O'Halloran was portrayed in the media as Playford's amenable offsider, even though many thought he was a better speaker than Playford. For most of the 1950s, the public believed the key to South Australia's ongoing economic success was the status quo of Playford as Premier and O'Halloran as opposition leader. This may not have concerned O'Halloran a great deal, however. Indeed, he appeared to be content to remain as Opposition Leader; he once told an acquaintance, \\"I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can do more for my voters than I could if I were in his shoes.\\" Indeed, following the 1959 election, a cartoon highlighting O'Halloran's relief at losing yet another election was published and O'Halloran liked it so much he framed and hung it in his Parliament House Office. While O'Halloran had despaired of ever becoming Premier, Labor did manage to whittle away at the LCL's majority during his tenure as opposition leader. Labor went from a ten- seat deficit when O'Halloran took the leadership to only a four-seat deficit at his death. O'Halloran's de facto alliance with Playford also proved beneficial to him personally. For example, O'Halloran had eagerly sought to obtain a papal audience for many years, but had been informed that only Heads of State could be given such an audience. When he sadly mentioned this fact to Playford, the latter (who, as a Baptist, had no great interest in meeting the Pope) made arrangements to visit Pius XII while in Europe to attend Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. Playford took O'Halloran and Mrs O'Halloran to the Vatican with him. O'Halloran's fondness for whiskey was renowned within state politics. He would regularly over-indulge during parliamentary sessions, and Playford would thoughtfully adjourn the House early so as not to embarrass him. Similarly, Don Dunstan recalled an incident during the 1953 election campaign when O'Halloran arrived at a public meeting intoxicated, and had to be led away quietly before he fell over. Despite these weaknesses, O'Halloran was universally liked. Labor's most effective orator prior to Dunstan's entry into politics, O'Halloran was a \\"decent, heavily built but gentle man who ... wore an air of sleepy benevolence\\", smoked a pipe and spoke with an Irish brogue. Death O'Halloran was still Opposition Leader when he died suddenly of a pulmonary embolism in Adelaide. Upon hearing the news of O'Halloran's death, the normally imperturbable Playford publicly wept. The Premier served as one of the pallbearers at O'Halloran's state funeral (the first state funeral for an opposition leader in South Australian history). In his eulogy on that occasion, Playford said that he had greatly respected O'Halloran as a man who always told the truth. References * Australian Dictionary of Biography * Cockburn, S.

More particularly, it allows an online shopper using an Internet marketplace to purchase an item without having to use shopping cart software. Instead of manually inputting billing and shipping information for a purchase, a user can use one-click buying to use a predefined address and credit card number to purchase one or more items.  Patent  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued for this technique to Amazon.com in September 1999. Amazon.com also owns the \\"1-Click\\" trademark. On May 12, 2006, the USPTO ordered a reexamination of the \\"One-Click\\" patent, based on a request filed by Peter Calveley. Calveley cited as prior art an earlier e-commerce patent and the Digicash electronic cash system. On October 9, 2007, the USPTO issued an office action in the reexamination which confirmed the patentability of claims 6 to 10 of the patent. The patent examiner, however, rejected claims 1 to 5 and 11 to 26. In November 2007, Amazon responded by amending the broadest claims (1 and 11) to restrict them to a shopping cart model of commerce. They have also submitted several hundred references for the examiner to consider. In March 2010, the reexamined and amended patent was allowed. Amazon's U.S. patent expired on September 11, 2017. In Europe, on 1-Click ordering was filed with the European Patent Office (EPO) but was rejected by the EPO in 2007 due to obviousness; the decision was upheld in 2011. A related gift-ordering patent was granted in 2003, but revoked in 2007 following an opposition. In Canada, the Federal Court of Canada held that the One click patent could not be rejected as a pure business method since it had a physical effect. The Court remanded the application to the Canadian patent office for a reexamination. Licensing =Apple Inc.= Amazon.com in 2000 licensed 1-Click ordering to Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) for use on its online store. Apple subsequently added 1-Click ordering to the iTunes Store and iPhoto. =Barnes & Noble= Amazon filed a patent infringement lawsuit in October 1999 in response to Barnes & Noble's offering a 1-Click ordering option called \\"Express Lane\\". After reviewing the evidence, a judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering Barnes & Noble to stop offering Express Lane until the case was settled. Barnes & Noble had developed a way to design around the patent by requiring shoppers to make a second click to confirm their purchase.[Claim 1 of the patent is limited to orders being placed \\"in response to only a single action being performed\\" The lawsuit was settled in 2002. The terms of the settlement, including whether or not Barnes & Noble took a license to the patent or paid any money to Amazon, were not disclosed. In response to the lawsuit, the Free Software Foundation urged a boycott of Amazon.com. The boycott was lifted in September 2002.

The book was intended as a tribute to Walt Disney and a satire on the state of the French comics industry. It was released on October 14, 2005 to commercial success, but was panned by the critics. This was the final volume produced by Uderzo before handing over the series to a new creative team. Plot summary An alien spaceship appears above the Gaulish village, causing nearly all of the people and animals to turn rigid. Only Asterix, Obelix, Getafix and Dogmatix are unaffected due to consumption of the magic potion. An alien named Toon emerges from the spherical spaceship. He is from the planet Tadsilweny and is accompanied by \\"superclone\\" security men. Toon turns off his ship's \\"anti- collision magnetic field\\", ending the paralysis of the village. He informs the Gauls he is on a mission to confiscate their \\"secret weapon\\" (Getafix's potion) that is \\"known throughout the universe\\", in order to prevent it from being seized by evil aliens called Nagmas. Meanwhile, a Nagma has landed his spaceship in the nearby Roman camp of Compendium and seeks the \\"powerful deadly weapon\\". The Roman centurion Polyanthus gives him directions to the Gaulish village. Toon's army of superclones and the Nagma's \\"cyberat\\" robot warriors engage in battle. Asterix and Obelix enter the fray, and the Nagma attempts to abduct Getafix. The Nagma is eventually defeated, and Toon abandons his quest for the magic potion as its only discernible effect on the aliens is to cause them to temporarily increase to an enormous size. As he departs, Toon erases all memory of his visit from the village and the Roman camp.  Reception  Falling Sky was a commercial success, but a critical disappointment. Ian Rankin, writing for the Guardian, described this Asterix volume as appearing to 'jump the shark' and 'not a success' which possibly led to the 8 year hiatus during which author Uderzo handed over writing duties to a new team. St Mag called it a 'disappointment' with 'more dissatisfactions in the book than anything else'. Roy Boyd from Sling's and Arrows called it a 'confused and pointless tale'. Splinter describes it as 'polarising', and 'the strangest Asterix story' that most deviates from the classic feel of the series, whilst acknowledging the influences that led Uderzo into introducing such foreign elements into the comic. There were some favourable reviews, including from Wales Online who acknowledged that 'purists will probably be horrified', but states that the story contains all the classic elements of an Asterix adventure. On Goodreads, it has a score of 3.25 out of 5. Notes * The cover is a mirror image of that for the first Asterix adventure, Asterix the Gaul. * The book is dedicated to Uderzo's older brother Bruno (1920–2004), who first recognized and encouraged his younger brother's talent for art. * At the end of the book, there is a message from Uderzo, paying tribute to \\"the great creations\\" of Walt Disney. * The story is seen as a satire of the 2003 United States-led invasion of Iraq on the pretext of possession of weapons of mass destruction. The extra-terrestrial elements have been described as a parody of American cultural imperialism. * Toon resembles Mickey Mouse. The name of his planet, Tadsilweny, is an anagram of Walt Disney, while Hubs is an anagram of Bush (viewed as a reference to US President George W. Bush). Uderzo told France-Soir newspaper he was inspired by \\"what the Americans are going through today with Bush\\". * Toon's \\"superclones\\" resemble Arnold Schwarzenegger dressed as Superman, while the Nagma resembles an insect-like Japanese manga character. Uderzo said he disliked manga comics and his aim was to poke fun at them, while paying tribute to Walt Disney. * The Nagma sage's name Akoaotaki is an anagram of Takao Aoki, the creator of the Beyblade manga series. * Uderzo was adamant this would not be the final Asterix album, saying in a Financial Times interview, \\"No, no, no, it is not the last. Certain journalists believed this because the cover was the mirror image of the first Asterix album. That is indeed the case but it was not at all my intention to suggest it would be the last album.\\" Financial Times * Although criticized for its science fiction elements, the book was a commercial success, breaking comic book sales records in 2005 when 2.4 million copies of the French- language version were sold in two months.

He was one half of SL2, who had a 1992 UK hit with \\"On a Ragga Tip\\". Biography In 1985, while working as an electrician and courier, Nelson obtained his first turntables and started playing hip-hop and house. He then founded a pirate radio station named \\"Raw FM\\" in London's East End, and in 1989 began his professional DJ career as DJ for the Raindance rave event. His first music production was in 1989 where Slipmatt collaborated with DJ Lime forming SL2. The single \\"Do That Dance\\", was released in that same year. This was followed by the number 11 UK chart hit \\"DJs Take Control\\" / \\"Way in My Brain\\". The follow-up single, \\"On a Ragga Tip\\", reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in April 1992. As a result of their chart success, the band were propelled into the media spotlight and made appearances on Top of the Pops and other television shows. SL2's chart success continued with a remix of \\"Way in My Brain\\", which made the top twenty in the UK chart. Amidst the chart success, Slipmatt cemented his name on the breakbeat hardcore DJ circuit and was a regular at major Fantazia and Dreamscape events. In 1993, Nelson set up a new project, the SMD series (Slip Matt's Dubs). The first release, SMD#1, sold over 10,000 copies, with a further three installments following in the series. A compilation album collected these recordings. 1994 saw the release of \\"Breaking Free\\" and \\"Hear Me\\" on Slipmatt and Lime's own Awesome Records imprint, the former being embraced by jungle and happy hardcore DJs alike. The tracks were later remixed by DJ SS (Formation Records) and DJ Seduction (Impact Records) respectively. By 1995, Slipmatt's DJ sets had veered strongly towards the Happy Hardcore genre and Nelson set up Universal Records to represent this burgeoning style. Releases from Force & Styles (as A Sense of Summer), DJ Sy & Unknown, DJ Demo and others followed. The tracks \\"Breaking Free\\" and \\"Hear Me\\" were again remixed, this time by Ramos & Sunset Regime. As Slipmatt, he has compiled and mixed several albums, including United Dance Anthems 1 & 2 and Moondance True Rave Anthems. Slipmatt's remixes include \\"Crowd Control\\" by Ramos, Supreme and the Sunset Regime on Hectic Records, \\"My Own\\" by DJ Seduction on Impact records and \\"Take Me Away\\" by Jimmy J and Cru- l-t on Kniteforce Records. In 1997, Nelson began presenting his own radio show on Kiss 100. Nelson has played in the US, Australia, Thailand, and around Europe. He has DJ'd at Ibiza's Space, Es Paradise, Eden, Summum, and West End clubs. In 2003, Slipmatt's track, \\"Space\\", peaked at #41 in the UK Singles Chart. Slipmatt has DJed at Fantazia, Raindance, Moondance, Dreamscape, Pleasuredome, Hardcore Heaven, Dance Concept, Helter Skelter, One Nation, United Dance, Uprising, Dizstruxshon, Alderney Bunker Parties, World Dance & Slammin Vinyl raves.

From the late 1940s through the 1970s, Landers was a popular gathering point for conventions of UFO enthusiasts, with the primary destinations of interest being the Integratron and nearby Giant Rock. The area was the epicenter of the June 28, 1992 Landers earthquake, a magnitude 7.4 strike-slip earthquake. It caused considerable structural damage to the surrounding area, and one death - a three-year-old child. The Morongo Basin Historical Society is located in Landers; the original Post Office is now there.Morongo Basin Historical Society http://www.mbhs.net/ Geography A typical sunrise in Landers, California Landers lies in the Homestead Valley of the southeastern Mojave Desert.

It is thought to be the largest free standing boulder in the world.Lucernevalley.net: Giant Rock history A significant part of its southern side split off in February 2000 for unknown reasons. It was sacred to the Californian Indians in the region, where the north and south tribes met annually. The deteriorated remains of a packed sand air strip that was operational from 1947 to 1975 are still visible, as is a concrete pad that was the location of a cafe at the site, built and operated by George Van Tassel, who was also associated with the Integratron.

The Integratron dome is built using a unique design of wood construction with 16 glued and laminated spines held together at its apex by one ton of concrete. It is high and in diameter. The Integratron and Giant Rock are the two Landers sites of most interest to UFO enthusiasts. Renowned food and travel personality Anthony Bourdain did a segment in 2011 on Van Tassel and the Integratron as part of his No Reservations television series (s07e13 - see here). Van Tassel, the Integratron and Giant Rock received serious treatment in 2018 by filmmaker Jonathan Berman in his documentary, Calling All Earthlings.

History CAMERA has chapters in major US cities and Israel, including New York City, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, and in 1988 a Boston chapter and headquarters, founded and led by Andrea Levin; Charles Jacobs became deputy director of the Boston chapter. In 1991, Levin succeeded Winifred Meiselman as executive director of CAMERA. According to the organization's website, CAMERA's membership grew from 1,000 in 1991 to 55,000 in 2007. The director of the Washington office of CAMERA is Eric Rozenman. In 2002, The Jewish Daily Forward named CAMERA executive director and regular Jerusalem Post contributor Andrea Levin America's fifth most influential Jewish citizen, saying \\"Media-monitoring was the great proxy war of the last year, and its general is Andrea Levin.\\" In 2008 CAMERA launched a campaign to alter Wikipedia articles to support the Israeli side of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. The campaign suggested that pro-Israeli editors should pretend to be interested in other topics until elected as administrators. Once administrators they were to misuse their administrative powers to suppress pro-Palestinian editors and support pro-Israel editors. Some members of this conspiracy were banned by Wikipedia administrators. Structure, staff, and activities On its official website, CAMERA describes itself as \\"a media-monitoring, research and membership organization devoted to promoting accurate and balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East\\" which \\"fosters rigorous reporting, while educating news consumers about Middle East issues and the role of the media.\\" CAMERA further describes itself as a \\"non- partisan organization\\" which \\"takes no position with regard to American or Israeli political issues or with regard to ultimate solutions to the Arab–Israeli conflict.\\"See \\"About CAMERA\\" and \\"Our Mission\\" as featured on the official website. CAMERA complained in 2008 that the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations (of which it is a member) did not consult it before disinviting Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin to an anti-Ahmadinejad rally. CAMERA has also criticized the Israeli non-governmental organization B'Tselem for some of its reporting on Israel. When CAMERA perceives an inaccurate statement in the media, it says it gathers information, and sends findings asking for a printed or broadcast correction. CAMERA lists 46 news outlets which it says have issued corrections based on their work.[Corrections. http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=10 ] The organization also publishes monographs about topics relating to the Arab- Israeli conflict. A 2005 Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs interview with the director of CAMERA Andrea Levin says CAMERA has 55,000 paying members and thousands of active letter writers. CAMERA is a member of the Israel Campus Roundtable, which includes the Anti-Defamation League, The David Project Center for Jewish Leadership, and other pro-Israel organizations. As a member of this Campus Roundtable, CAMERA operates on college campuses to combat what it perceives as \\"propagandistic assaults on Israel ... creating harmful misperceptions of Israel\\" and is active on about 50 college campuses. CAMERA runs a student-focused site containing specialized information available for countering misinformation. CAMERA also provides one-on-one assistance to students who encounter Middle East distortions in campus publications, flyers, rallies and classroom teaching. CAMERA has offered student representative positions which include compensation and training in Israel. Criticism by CAMERA Among the organizations and works that have been criticized by CAMERA are: =ABC News anchor Peter Jennings= \\"We've long considered him anti- Israel\\", CAMERA's founder Andrea Levin has commented of Peter Jennings, after an incident in which CAMERA, and eventually also the Columbia Journalism Review, took issue with Jennings and ABC News for refusing to correct an alleged misquote of Benjamin Netanyahu. =National Public Radio= CAMERA's report, \\"A Record of Bias: National Public Radio's Coverage of the Arab–Israeli Conflict: September 26 – November 26, 2000\\" (2001) asserted that National Public Radio's \\"coverage of the Arab–Israeli conflict has long been marred by a striking anti-Israel tilt, with severe bias, error and lack of balance commonplace.\\" CAMERA supported a boycott of NPR, and demanded the firing of NPR's foreign editor, Loren Jenkins. CAMERA said that Jenkins had a long record of partisanship in favor of Palestinian views, and let his personal views tilt NPR's coverage. CAMERA also said Jenkins compared Israel to Nazi Germany in his writings, and referred to it as a \\"colonizer\\".Press Release. CAMERA Calls on NPR to Fire Foreign Editor Loren Jenkins. May 3, 2002.Andrea Levin. Just Say No to NPR. The Jerusalem Post, September 27, 2002. NPR's then-Ombudsman, Jeffrey Dvorkin, said in a 2002 interview that CAMERA used selective citations and subjective definitions of what it considers pro- Palestinian bias in formulating its findings, and that he felt CAMERA's campaign was \\"a kind of McCarthyism, frankly, that bashes us and causes people to question our commitment to doing this story fairly. And it exacerbates the legitimate anxieties of many in the Jewish community about the survival of Israel.\\"Camille T. Taiara.

[In June 2006 Dvorkin left the position of NPR Ombudsman to become the executive director of the Committee of Concerned Journalists (CCJ), an organization founded by Bill Kovach as part of the Project for Excellence in Journalism (CEJ), effective July 1, 2006; see Dvorkin's last column as NPR Ombudsman, \\"Dear Listeners: Thanks and Farewell,\\" and CEJ/CCJ press release, June 19, 2006.] =Encarta= In an article originally published in The Jerusalem Post and posted on the official website of CAMERA, Andrea Levin, the Executive Director of CAMERA, describes Microsoft's digital multimedia encyclopedia Encarta as \\"a troubling mix of solid information, bias and error.\\" In particular, Levin points to the articles written by Shaul Cohen of the University of Oregon, which Levin says \\"blurs Arab aggression against the Jews from the Mandate period to the present, repeatedly equating the violence by the parties.\\"\\"Microsoft's Encarta Muddles the Middle East,\\" Jerusalem Post February 12, 2004, CAMERA May 26, 2006. =Steven Spielberg's film Munich= In her film review of Munich (2005), posted on the official website of CAMERA, Andrea Levin states that the film (a collaboration of director Steven Spielberg and playwright–screenwriter Tony Kushner) promotes \\"its thesis of Israeli culpability\\" and that \\"Israel's action battling its adversaries is cast as aberrant, bloody and counterproductive.\\" Levin continues: \\"indeed, it is stunning to watch Munich and realize that its director [Spielberg] brought Schindler's List to the world. Where that was artistry drawn from truth, Munich is cinematic manipulation rooted in lies.\\"\\"File Review of Munich: Spielberg and Kushner Smear Israel,\\" CAMERA December 21, 2005, accessed May 18, 2006. =Mearsheimer and Walt= CAMERA published Alex Safian's detailed critique of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, a paper written by Harvard University professor Stephen Walt and University of Chicago professor John Mearsheimer. Safian argued that the paper is \\"riddled with errors of fact, logic and omission, has inaccurate citations, displays extremely poor judgement regarding sources, and, contrary to basic scholarly standards, ignores previous serious work on the subject. The bottom line: virtually every word and argument is, or ought to be, in 'serious dispute.' In other words, a student who submitted such a paper would flunk.\\"Alex Safian, \\"Study Decrying 'Israel Lobby' Marred by Numerous Errors\\" (\\"Updated April 6: Rebutting charges of expulsion and massacre\\"), CAMERA March 20, 2006, accessed March 24, 2006.

See also Glenn Frankel, \\"A Beautiful Friendship? In Search of the Truth about the Israel Lobby's Influence on Washington,\\" The Washington Post, July 16, 2006: W13. =God's Warriors= CAMERA published a critique of Christiane Amanpour's CNN documentary series God's Warriors, calling it \\"one of the most grossly distorted programs to appear on mainstream American television\\", \\"false in its basic premise\\", and \\"a perfect illustration of classical propaganda techniques\\". Amanpour has responded that the documentary is not meant to compare religions, but rather to show \\"that each faith has their committed and fervent believers, and we're showing how each of those are active in the political sphere in today's world.\\" =\\"Israel's Jewish Defamers\\"= In October 2007, CAMERA organized a conference entitled \\"Israel's Jewish Defamers,\\" in which a panel of discussants accused selected Jewish critics of Israel, as well as one of Israel's leading newspapers, Haaretz, of distortions and falsehoods about Israel. CAMERA director Andrea Levin described the Jewish critics—who included Princeton University's Richard Falk, writer Norman Finkelstein, New York Review of Books contributor Henry Siegman, former New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis, Trent University professor Michael Neumann, and Tikkun magazine publisher Michael Lerner—of being guilty of \\"demonstrably false and baseless defaming of Israel, wildly distorted out of context accusations against Israel.\\" Among the panelists were writer Cynthia Ozick and Harvard psychiatrist Kenneth Levin, who likened the Jewish critics to chronically abused children. In response, Anthony Lewis told the New York Sun that the conference was \\"about a nonexistent phenomenon,\\" noting that Jewish criticism of Israeli policies was not necessarily defamatory. Haaretzs editor-in-chief, David Landau, refused to comment on the conference, citing that \\"it was \\"a matter of policy and principle\\" not to respond to CAMERA, which Landau described as \\"McCarthyite.\\" Tikkun editor Lerner also rejected the notion that he was anti-Israel.Elliot Resnick.

Media watchdog blasts 'Israel's Jewish defamers'; Michael Lerner, Ha'aretz editor reject charges. The Jewish Review, Vol. 50, No. 8, October 2007. =2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict= In response to coverage of the 2008–2009 Gaza War, CAMERA criticized the reporting of the Los Angeles Times, CNN, Haaretz, NPR, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, and Norwegian doctors being funded by the Norwegian ministry who appeared on media outlets such as the BBC and CBS. CAMERA said that in its view reporting from the Los Angeles Times \\"consistently omitted key information about Gaza Strip sites targeted by the Israeli army\\" and \\"gives the false impression that Israel doesn't aim to prevent civilian deaths.\\" CAMERA criticized Haaretz for \\"confusion and misinformation on the medical issue\\" in its \\"outlining what medical supplies Gaza is reportedly lacking and ignoring all incoming medical aid\\". =Quotation misattributed to Moshe Ya'alon= In early 2009 CAMERA began investigating the dissemination of a quotation widely misattributed to Moshe Ya'alon, \\"The Palestinians must be made to understand in the deepest recesses of their consciousness that they are a defeated people\\", after the quotation was cited by Rashid Khalidi, a Columbia University professor, in an op-ed article in The New York Times. The quotation, and variants, had previously been repeated throughout the world by news broadcasts, blogs, and in reputable publications such as the Chicago Tribune, Boston Globe, Toronto Star, Time, and the London Review of Books. The belief that Ya'alon, a high-ranking Israeli military official, had expressed disregard for Palestinian people in this manner reinforced an opinion among some readers and commentators that Israel was the aggressor and Palestinians its victims. However, Ya'alon did not make the statement in the 2002 Haaretz interview generally cited as its source, and appears never to have made the statement at all. In part due to CAMERA's campaign, a number of international newspapers, including the New York Times, issued corrections. =The New York Times coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict= In a 2012 monograph of its study of The New York Times, CAMERA asserted that the newspaper shows a clear preference for the Palestinian narrative. It further says that The New York Times treats Israel with a harsher standard and omits context. The study called \\"Indicting Israel: New York Times Coverage of the Palestinian–Israeli Conflict – A July 1 – December 31, 2011 Study\\" is part of the Monograph Series. In the executive summary senior CAMERA research analysts Ricki Hollander and Gilead Ini, say that the dominant finding of the study was a disproportionate, continuous, embedded indictment of Israel that dominated both news and commentary sections. It further states that \\"Israeli views are downplayed while Palestinian perspectives, especially criticism of Israel, are amplified and even promoted.\\" According to Rick Richman, writing in Commentary magazine, the CAMERA study examines all news and editorial sections in the print version of the newspaper directly relating to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (July 1 – December 31, 2011). Reception to CAMERA CAMERA has attracted both critics and supporters. Gershom Gorenberg, a journalist for The American Prospect, has written that CAMERA is \\"Orwellian-named\\" and that \\"like others engaged in the narrative wars, it does not understand the difference between advocacy and accuracy\\". Other critics have described CAMERA as a special interest group fighting for a pro-Israeli bias.Robert I. Friedman. \\"The lobby: Jewish political power and American foreign policy\\", The Nation 244 (June 6, 1987). Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, US Senator Joe Lieberman, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, and former Israeli cabinet minister Natan Sharansky have assisted CAMERA in its fund raising efforts, by speaking at their national conference. US Representative Tom Lantos was previously on CAMERA's advisory board. =The Boston Globe= * In a 2003 profile of the organization in The Boston Globe, Mark Jurkowitz observed: =Washington Report on Middle East Affairs= * Mitchell Kaidy, writing in the Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, criticized CAMERA's efforts to pressure university libraries to remove books that the organization finds offensive.Mitchell Kaidy, \\"CAMERA and Facts and Logic About the Middle East FLAME: Pressuring U.S. Media\\", Washington Report on Middle East Affairs, July/August 1993: 29, WRMEA Archive of Back Issues April 10, 2006; cf.

Conversely CAMERA has criticized the organization as being \\"virulently anti-Israel\\".Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, Washington Report on Middle East Affairs . Retrieved December 1, 2006. =Journalists= * Writing in The Nation in 1987, journalist and author Robert I. Friedman described CAMERA as having been formed in the wake of Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon \\"to keep the U.S. press in line,\\" noting that the organization's activities at the time included publishing a newsletter and placing advertisements in The Christian Science Monitor and The New Republic in support of Israel's West Bank settlement policies. According to Friedman, \\"CAMERA, the A.D.L., AIPAC and the rest of the lobby don't want fairness, but bias in their favor. And they are prepared to use McCarthyite tactics, as well as the power and money of pro-Israel PACs, to get whatever Israel wants.\\" * In his 2006 book Public Editor #1, former New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent expressed gratitude to CAMERA as a notable example of organizations that \\"maintained an evenness of tone and an openness of communication no matter how much they disagreed\\" with his columns.Daniel Okrent, Public Editor #1, pp. 20–21. * Writing about criticisms from CAMERA he and his colleagues have received, Jerusalem-based journalist Gershom Gorenberg wrote \\"It is not the press's job to provide PR for any government.

Moment Magazine. Washington: Oct/Nov 2007. Vol. 32, Iss. 5; p. 14. * Ian Mayes, president of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen in Britain, wrote in 2006 that to him, methods employed by CAMERA seemed to go beyond reasonable calls for accountability. He mentioned CAMERA's campaign against the Middle East reporting of National Public Radio, in which he says CAMERA had attempted to influence NPR's supporters to withhold funds. * Jonathan Cook lists CAMERA among \\"Zionist watchdogs\\" that \\"created what the late Edward Said called 'the last taboo in American public life', moving rapidly to shut down any signs of critical debate about Israeli policies or US support for such policies either in the American media or in Washington's corridors of power\\". =The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles= * Writing about attempts by CAMERA to get a local Pasadena, California church to cancel an appearance by Palestinian activist Reverend Naim Ateek, Rob Eshman, Editor-in-Chief of The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, wrote: \\"I'm always leery when Jewish groups ride in from out of town to try to save us from the bad guys. We have plenty of sharp-eyed Jewish defense groups locally who can tussle on our behalf. It's just a bit condescending to think we rubes, out in America's second-largest Jewish city, don't know how and when to fight. Or whom.\\"Rob Eshman. \\"Butt Out\\". The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles January 25, 2008. Eshman later clarified that his criticism was directed specifically at CAMERA's handling of the Ateek visit, and not toward the organization in general. \\"I think CAMERA, which in so many cases I find useful and correct, is in this case making things worse,\\" he wrote.Rob Eshman. Response to CAMERA letter. The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, February 1, 2008. =Center for Middle Eastern Studies= * In 2005, Donald Wagner, Executive Director of the defunct Center for Middle Eastern Studies and Associate Professor of Religion and Middle Eastern Studies at Northpark University, characterized the organization as \\"a well-known source of extremist pro-Israel propaganda that is routinely challenged by Israeli and international human rights and peace organizations for its consistent misrepresentation of the facts in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\" =The Atlanta Journal-Constitution= The Atlanta Journal- Constitution described the place CAMERA took in a debate among various Jewish groups about statements made by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said it was not right to outright dismiss his apology. CAMERA said true repentance required Carter to reverse any of the perceived harm he caused, and called on the president to take \\"concrete actions to redress troubling false statements\\" the group said he made about the war Israel waged in Gaza. Ira Forman, chief executive of the Washington-based National Jewish Democratic Council, said it was \\"mensch-like\\" to accept and encourage Carter's remarks. =Academia= In 1986, Florida International University political science professor Cheryl A. Rubenberg noted CAMERA was \\"Another pro-Israeli organization that was formed after 1982 to monitor the media...\\"Cheryl A. Rubenberg: Israel and the American National Interest: A Critical Examination, University of Illinois Press, 1986. , p. 339. > Another pro-Israeli organization that was formed after 1982 to monitor the > media is the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting (CAMERA). She further stated that CAMERA was one of several 'new groups' which constituted the \\"Israeli lobby\\" at the time.Rubenberg, pp. 353–54, > The term \\"Israeli lobby\\" loosely refers to the approximately thirty-eight > major Jewish groups that concern themselves with Israel and with influencing > US Middle East policy to serve the interests of the Jewish state. (Since the > 1982 war in Lebanon, there has been a proliferation of new groups, in > addition to the thirty-eight, such as ASFI, CAMERA, and others.) In 1988, Edward Said, a political activist and Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, argued that not even the Israeli government has ventured arguments as extreme as CAMERA, and that \\"surely, the Israeli lobby can find better propaganda methods than this!\\" Robin Shepherd, Director of International Affairs at the Henry Jackson Society, describes CAMERA as one of \\"several reputable institutions monitoring [media] trends closely.\\"Robin Shephard, A State Beyond the Pale, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2009, pp. 76 and 272. In 2010, Richard Landes, a political activist and professor of history at Boston University argued that CAMERA is \\"careful both to reason and cite sources scrupulously\\" and that those who dismiss their work \\"rely on a dismissal that is at least as partisan as that with which it charges others. CAMERA campaign in Wikipedia In an April 2008 article, online publication The Electronic Intifada revealed the existence of a Google group set up by CAMERA. The stated purpose of the group was \\"help[ing] us keep Israel-related entries on Wikipedia from becoming tainted by anti-Israel editors\\". Electronic Intifada accused CAMERA of \\"orchestrating a secret, long- term campaign to infiltrate the popular online encyclopedia Wikipedia to rewrite Palestinian history, pass off crude propaganda as fact, and take over Wikipedia administrative structures to ensure these changes go either undetected or unchallenged\\". Andre Oboler, a Legacy Heritage Fellow at the Israeli non-governmental organization NGO Monitor, responded that \\"Electronic Intifada is manufacturing a story.\\" Excerpts of some of the e-mails were published in the July 2008 issue of Harper's Magazine under the title of \\"Candid camera.\\" In April 2008, CAMERA's \\"Senior Research Analyst\\" Gilead Ini would not confirm that the messages were genuine but maintained that there was a CAMERA email campaign which adhered to Wikipedia's rules. In August 2008, Ini argued the excerpts published in Harper's Magazine were unrepresentative and that CAMERA had campaigned \\"toward encouraging people to learn about and edit the online encyclopedia for accuracy\\". A group of Wikipedia administrators strongly believed an editor on Wikipedia to be Gilead Ini and blocked that user account indefinitely. In April 2008, Gilead refused to say whether he was behind the Gni account, and in May 2008 he denied that the account belonged to him. Andre Oboler alleged that groups such as \\"Wikipedians for Palestine\\" have engaged in similar practices. Electronic Intifada co- founder Ali Abunimah insisted that his group would never encourage a similar e-mail campaign. Commenting on the incident, Gershom Gorenberg, of the liberal magazine The American Prospect, stated \\"CAMERA is ready to exempt itself from the demands for accuracy that it aims at the media. And like others engaged in the narrative wars, it does not understand the difference between advocacy and accuracy.\\" Gorenberg criticized CAMERA for telling members not to share information about the campaign with media, and he also argued Ini's definition of accuracy \\"only means not printing anything embarrassing to his own side\\".Gorenberg, Gershom. The Mideast Editing Wars. The American Prospect, May 1, 2008. David Shamah, of The Jerusalem Post, stated that \\"the vast anti- Israel lobby that haters of our country have managed to pull together\\" hate it when groups like CAMERA mess up \\"their anti-Israel propaganda with (gasp!) facts\\".Shamah, David. \\"Digital World: Internet Independence Day\\", The Jerusalem Post, May 6, 2008.

The is a prominent example of early Japanese armor worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan. The term ō-yoroi means \\"great armor.\\"(Mondadori, 1979, p. 507). History Ō-yoroi, Kamakura period, 13th-14th century, National Treasure, Kasuga grand shrine.Kasuga Grand Shrine Ō-yoroi first started to appear in the 10th century during the middle and late Heian period, and came into widespread use in the Genpei War around the 12th century when the call for armor was at its peak. Significant aspects of this armor were designed for cavalry archers. The box shaped ō-yoroi was heavy and did not allow as much movement or flexibility as its counterpart the dō-maru, so the armor fell out of favor in the fifteenth century when samurai shifted to mostly infantry tactics.(Ogawa, 1989). For the most part the ō-yoroi was a rich man's armor and not used by lower ranking samurai. The armor was mainly worn by the higher ranking samurai on horseback. The lower ranking soldiers had armor that was similar to the ō-yoroi, but had fewer components, was lighter, and lacked the decorative markings of the higher ranking samurai.(Ratti and Westbrook, 1991). Most of the information known about the ō-yoroi is based on the armor of the higher-ranking officials since the armor was either donated to a shrine as an offering or maintained by the descendants of the original wearer.(Ogawa, 1989).(Hoopes, 1930). Many of the original components of the ō-yoroi still in existence have been replaced over time due to the items being lost or damaged. The few remaining examples of ō-yoroi are on display in museums in several different countries.相馬の物具（もののぐ）文化 \\\\- Minamisoma City Museum There are also a few examples of ō-yoroi in Shinto shrines where they have been maintained and protected for centuries.(Ogawa, 1989).  Components  Samurai on horseback wearing an ō-yoroi-the large skirt-like kusazuri shows that this is an ō-yoroi. The basic components of the ō-yoroi and other samurai armor are known collectively as the “hei-no-rokugu” or simply “rokugu,” which means six articles of arms. The six major components are the dō (cuirass), kabuto (helmet), menpo (mask), kote (armoured sleeves), sune-ate (greaves), and the hai-date (cuisses). The ō-yoroi combines plate and scales (kozane) laced together (lamellar). One specific advance over earlier armors is that the kozane of ō-yoroi are first laced together and then covered with lacquer, which enhances resistance to corrosion. The dō of the ō-yoroi is unique from later models because it is composed of two separate parts instead of one piece with an opening on the side or back of the dō to allow the samurai to put on the armor.(Ogawa, 1989). The ō-yoroi (dō) consisted of two parts. One (the waidate) was a separate defense for the right side and the other part covered the rest of the wearer's trunk. The upper part of the waidate was solid iron plate covered with leather. The lower part was lamellar. When dressing for battle, the waidate was put on before the rest of the dō and fastened with cords that tied around the body. The rest of the dō was constructed with individual lacquered scales (kozane) laced together and covered with leather on top.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004p.94 The shoulder straps of the dō-yoroi, the watagami, were also unique from those on the dō- maru. The watagami were made of leather with attached metal plates. They were thicker and offered more protection than the straps on the dō-maru. The watagami of the dō-maru were eventually adopted because it was lighter and allowed more flexibility.(Hoopes, 1930). A four piece box like skirt (kusazuri) of similar construction to the rest of the armor differentiated the ō-yoroi from the other armours of the era, the (dō-maru) and the (haramaki), which usually had seven panels of kusazuri.Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior. Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 P.29 Samurai ō-yoroi armour from the Tokyo National Museum Various supplementary pieces included large (shield like) rectangular lamellar shoulder guards (ō-sode) and a fabric and plate sleeve (yugote) worn on the left arm when using a bow. A loin protector (koshi-ate) was a basic part of the ō-yoroi. The koshi-ate was later replaced by the haidate in the do-maru model. Specialized yugake archery gloves were made from deerskin and boots (kegutsu or tsuranuki) were made of bearskin or sealskin.(Mondadori, 1979, p. 508). The kabuto (helmet) of the ō-yoroi is known as a hoshi-bachi-kabuto (star helmet), because of the protruding rivets. This type of helmet first appeared around the 10th century and was constructed with iron plates (tate hagi-no-ita) that are arranged vertically, and radiate from an opening in the top called the tehen or hachiman-za, the rivets that connect the plates have large protruding heads (o-boshi).The Watanabe Art Museum Samurai Armour Collection, Volume I ~ Kabuto & Mengu, Trevor Absolon, P.21 Facial armor called ’’mengu’’Samurai: The Weapons and Spirit of the Japanese Warrior. Clive Sinclaire, Globe Pequot, 2004 P.30 was worn to protect the samurai's face as part of the full yoroi. It was composed of iron or lacquered leather. Mengu could cover the entire face or only sections of it. There were many different types and styles of mengu. Ō-yoroi weighed around 30 kg or 65 pounds, and the metal of choice was iron. Due to the weight of iron, armour makers limited its use to cover the vitals, and substituted leather for the rest. One way to lower the weight was by alternating metal and leather kozane (scales) when constructing the rows of lamellar, creating a very strong armor with great flexibility and a more manageable weight. The ō-yoroi could take up to 265 days to make, using 2000 kozane in its construction. The time, materials and labor meant that an o-yoroi was a substantial investment for a samurai.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004P.94 It was big boxy armor designed for use on horseback and was loose fitting. The boxy shape hindered the samurai from using the sword with the free, fluid motion vital in hand-to-hand combat, hence the use of yari.  Lacing  12th century Armor (Yoroi) The Metropolitan Museum of Art Samurai o-yoroi armour from the Tokyo National Museum (side view) The color, design, and material of the lacing identified the clan of the warrior. The clans were also identified by the designs painted on the armor. Many of the clans used symbols as a crest, such as cherry blossoms or depictions of deities. The color and design of lacing the plates together, odoshi, was a system used for identification on the field. There were many different color combinations that identified warriors from a distance.(Conlan, 1999). The design and coloring of the lacing also indicated rank. Higher-ranking officers had the plates of their armor laced together tightly, while lower ranking samurai had armor that was laced more loosely. The loosely laced armor was adopted for all ranks of samurai over time to decrease the weight, allow more flexibility, and help ventilate the armor. This allowed air to flow, keeping the samurai comfortable in hot and cool weather. The loose lacing also allowed the armor to be cleaned and dried out, preventing the armor from rotting. It also reduced the weight of the armor by reducing the amount of water and ice retained on the lacing since it would be dried by the air flow. Once the loose lacing was adopted by all ranks, the lacing of the neck protector was then used to indicate rank. The pattern and number of pairs in the lacing specifically indicated the rank of the wearer. Many of the remaining examples of the ō-yoroi have been re- laced to maintain the original form of the armor. However, some of the remaining ō-yoroi contain sections of the original lacing which impart valuable knowledge of the clan association.(Ogawa, 1989).

In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought what would become the southern coast of Namibia from Josef Frederiks II, a chief of the local Oorlam people, and founded the city of Lüderitz. The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, proclaiming it German South West Africa (). Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials. In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost its colonial possessions, including South West Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former German colony was administered as a South African mandate. The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory alongside Afrikaans and English. Language Today, English is the country's sole official language, but about 30,000 Namibians of German descent (around 2% of the country's overall population) and possibly 15,000 black Namibians (many of whom returned from East Germany after Namibian independence) still speak German or Namibian Black German, respectively. However, the numbers of German Namibians, rather than of Namibian speakers of German, are uncertain. Many Namibians of German descent still speak German and prefer classification as Namibian Germans not as Afrikaners. German Namibians retain a fully-fledged culture in German within Namibia, with German-medium schools, churches, and broadcasting. Television, music and books from Germany are widely popular in the community. Often German Namibian youth attend university or technical school in Germany. This is despite the fact that in most areas and in Windhoek, the broader lingua franca is Afrikaans while English is now often the sole language used in many other spheres such as government or on public signs and product packaging. Unlike in South Africa, German Namibians have not been absorbed into the larger Afrikaans and English speaking communities. However, virtually all German Namibians are fluent in Afrikaans and are either familiar with English or can speak it fluently. History of German settlement Hohenzollernhaus in Swakopmund The first Germans in Namibia were missionaries, initially sent through the London Missionary Society and then later also the Rheinish Missionary Society. Both institutions worked closely together towards the end of the 18th century, as the Rheinish Missionary Society did not yet have any established facilities in Southern Africa. From 1805 the Albrecht brothers, followed by a number of other missionaries, settled in Southwest Africa. They engaged in cultural work, but also laid the groundwork for later colonisation. Later traders arrived and after the landing of the ship Tilly in Lüderitz Bay in 1883, a rising number of German officials, settles, workman and soldiers. After Southwest Africa was officially declared a German colony in 1884, as well as receiving recognition by England, an increasing number of migrants arrived from Germany. This migration flow reached its high point during the first Lüderitz diamond discoveries. Migration stagnated after the end of World War I, when Germany lost all sovereignty over its colonies in the Treaty of Versailles. The governance of Southwest Africa was transferred to South Africa by the League of Nations. During the subsequent 'south-africanisation' of Southwest Africa, around half of the remaining 15 000 German residents were deported with their farms being handed over to South Africans. This so-called 'degermanistion' policy only changed after the London Agreement of 23 October 1923, according to which the remaining Germans were afforded British citizenship. German immigration as well as the spread of the German language were also expressively encouraged. In all 3 200 Germans took up the opportunity of acquiring citizenship. At the start of World War II, South Africa aligned itself to the English by a slim majority, although the country did not intervene in the war. In 1939 those in Southwest Africa of German origin were put under house or farm arrest and then in 1940 transferred to South Africa to be interned in camps, where they would remain until 1946. From 1942 their British citizenship, afforded to them in 1923, was revoked. The Apartheid policy of South Africa came under increasing criticism and resulted in the founding and strengthening of the black resistance movement, including in Southwest Africa. At this time relations between the South African government and the German population were warming, leading to an increase in migration from Germany being viewed more favourably. Communities Most of the current German Namibians are descendants of farmers, officials, craftsmen and relatives of the so-called Schutztruppe (protection troops) as well as descendants of the migration waves following both of the world wars. Since around 1980, an increase in tourism has led to a rise in ownership of holiday and retirement homes by Germans. many Germans in Namibia are small and medium entrepreneurs. Many German-speakers live in the capital, Windhoek (), and in smaller towns such as Swakopmund, Lüderitz and Otjiwarongo, where German architecture, too, is highly visible. Many German Namibians are prominent in business, farming, and tourism or as governmental officials. For example, the first post-independence mayor of Windhoek, Björn von Finckenstein, is a German Namibian. The interests of the community are frequently voiced through Africa's only German-speaking daily, Die Allgemeine Zeitung. The Goethe- Institut in Windhoek lobbies on behalf of the German community. The legacy of German colonisation in Namibia can also be seen in the Lutheran Church, which is the largest religious denomination in the country. Many place names in Namibia carry names of German origin. The main road in the capital city, Windhoek retained the name Kaiserstrasse (\\"Emperor Street\\") until Namibian independence in 1990. Decline The percentage of the population of Namibia formed by Germans has declined recently, spurring speculation that the overall number of German Namibians is decreasing. The decline in the percentage of German Namibians is mainly due to their low birth rates and the fact that other Namibian ethnic groups have higher birth rates and bigger families. Unlike other southern African white groups, emigration to Europe, Australia or North America is not common. German Namibians tend to emigrate instead to South Africa. According to the 2001 Census, only 1.1% of all Namibian households use German as a home language (3,654 households), which is much less than that for Afrikaans (39,481 or 11.4%) or English (6,522 or 1.9%). As per the 2011 census, 0.9% of all Namibian households used German as a home language (4,359 households), as compared to 10.4% using Afrikaans (48,238) and 3.4% using English (15,912). German is spoken by only 0.3% of the rural Namibians as compared to 1.7% of the urban Namibians. The maximum concentration can be found at Erongo (2.8%), Khomas (2.6%) and Otjozondjupa (1.4%).

Muromachi period, 15th century, Tokyo National Museum, Important Cultural Property Dōmaru with “Eurasian Jay” Lacing, Red at the Top. Muromachi period, 15th century, Tokyo National Museum, Important Cultural Property Dō-maru (胴丸), or \\"body wrap\\", was a type of chest armour (dou or dō) worn by the samurai class of feudal Japan. Dō-maru first started to appear in the 11th century as an armour for lesser samurai and retainers.Oriental Armour, H. Russell Robinson, Courier Dover Publications, 2002 P.180 Like the ō-yoroi style it became more common in the Genpei War at the end of the 12th century. Description There were quite a number of similar styles and types of Japanese armor; the dō-maru is particularly defined by the fact that a dō-maru opens on the right side as opposed to the haramaki style which opened in the back and the ō-yoroi the cuirass of which is completely open on the right side requiring a separate plate (waidate) to cover the right side. The ō-yoroi was a heavy box like armour meant for use on horse back, it was also expensive to make. The dō-maru like the haramaki had more skirt plates (kusazuri) than an ō-yoroi and was lighter, closer fitting and less expensive to make. The dō-maru was easier to fight with on foot and eventually even higher status samurai adopted the dō-maru over the ō-yoroi. Dō-maru were constructed from small scales of leather or metal laced into plates with cord and lacquered. Then each plate was laced together to form the armor. Due to the weight of iron, armour makers limited its use to the most vital parts of the armor and used leather for the remainder.

Born in Monto, Queensland, Bennett was a significant figure in contemporary Indigenous Australian art. Early life Born in Monto, Queensland in 1955, of Anglo-Celtic and Aboriginal ancestry, Gordon Bennett grew up in Victoria from the age of four, when his family moved back to Queensland, to the town of Nambour. He attended Nambour State High School. He left school at fifteen and worked in a variety of trades before undertaking formal art studies at the Queensland College of Art, Brisbane between 1986 and 1988. Career Some of his work is about what he saw when he was young. His 1991 painting Nine Ricochets won the prestigious Moët & Chandon Australian Art Fellowship, and he rapidly established himself as a leading figure in the Australian art world. Bennett lived and worked in Brisbane, where he created paintings, prints and worked in multi-media. In 2004, Bennett, together with Peter Robinson, had a two-person exhibition Three Colours, which showed at several Victorian art galleries including Heide Museum of Modern Art, Shepparton Art Gallery, Bendigo Art Gallery and the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery. In late 2007 he had a solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, that set his works on colonialism in an international context. Bennett exhibited his work in biennales in numerous cities, including Sydney, Venice, Gwangju, Shanghai, Prague and Berlin. Views Bennett expressed his discomfort with being seen as spokesman for Aboriginal peoples, and in a manifesto (or 'manifest toe' as he called it) published in 1996 he spoke of his wish \\"to avoid banal containment as a professional Aborigine, which both misrepresents me and denies my upbringing and Scottish/English heritage,\\"* while simultaneously expressing his wish that his young daughter could grow up in a society where her life would not be defined by her race. The confrontation of Australian racism is a regular theme in works by Bennett. Death Gordon Bennett died on 3 June 2014, of natural causes. He was 58. Legacy Judith Ryan, senior curator from the National Gallery of Victoria in 2004 described Bennett as \\"an artist's artist\\" and \\"like no other artist currently working\\". Noting the influence of Jackson Pollock, Piet Mondrian and Basquiat, she considered Bennett's style to be theoretical and confronting, and intended to encourage critical reflection on national identity. Bennett is represented in most major public collections in Australia, including the Queensland Art Gallery, as well as in several important overseas collections. In September 2017, Bennett's 1991 Possession Island was unveiled at London's Tate Modern.

He is noted for interdisciplinary work on the interface of linguistics and philosophy—in particular on the philosophical foundations of Noam Chomsky's theory of generative linguistics and on the foundations of the theory of meaning in linguistic semantics. He has worked on the application of analytic philosophy of language to topics in epistemology, metaphysics, and logic, among other areas. Ludlow has also established a research program outside of philosophy and linguistics. Here, his research areas include conceptual issues in cyberspace, particularly questions about cyber-rights and the emergence of laws and governance structures in and for virtual communities, including online games, and as such he is also noted for influential contributions to legal informatics. In recent years Ludlow has written nonacademic essays on hacktivist culture and related phenomena such as WikiLeaks. Ludlow has taught as a professor of philosophy at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, the University of Michigan, the University of Toronto and Northwestern University, where he was the John Evans Professor in Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. In May 2015, Ludlow resigned his position at Northwestern after a university disciplinary body found that \\"he had engaged in sexual harassment involving two students.\\" Education and career Ludlow received his B.A. in 1979 from Bethel College. He received his PhD in philosophy from Columbia University in 1985 under the direction of Charles Parsons, but also studied with Noam Chomsky and James Higginbotham at MIT. He worked for a year on projects related to natural language processing as an engineer at Honeywell from 1985 to 1986. From 1987 to 2002 he worked at the State University of New York at Stony Brook Department of Philosophy as an assistant professor and from 1994 as an associate professor. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan from 2002 to 2007, a professor of philosophy at the University of Toronto from 2007 to 2008 and a professor of philosophy at the Northwestern University from 2008 to 2015. From 2011 he was also John Evans Professor in Moral and Intellectual Philosophy at Northwestern University. He has been a visiting fellow at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice in 1993, 1995 and 1997–1998, when he held a Fulbright distinguished chair. He has also been a visiting fellow at King's College London in 1997 and a visiting professor at the Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science in 2012, where he taught a course on hacktivism. He has also held visiting positions at several other universities in the United States and Europe. Work =Philosophy of generative linguistics= Ludlow's work in generative linguistics has revolved around three basic themes.The first theme is that generative linguistics at its best is concerned with understanding and explanation, and not just with observation and data gathering. To this end, generative linguistics is interested in underlying mechanisms that give rise to language related phenomena, and this interest will often trump the goal of accumulating more data. The second theme is what he calls the \\"Ψ-language hypothesis\\". It is the hypothesis that the underlying mechanisms (the more basic elements) posited by generative linguists are fundamentally psychological mechanisms and that generative linguistics is a branch of cognitive psychology, but against Noam Chomsky's I-Language hypothesis Ludlow argues that it doesn't follow that cognitive psychology must therefore be interested in mental states individuated solely by what happens inside the language user's head. It is consistent with the Ψ-language hypothesis that psychological states (and indeed syntactic states) are individuated in part by the embedding environment. The third theme is what Ludlow calls the principle of \\"methodological minimalism\\". It is the thesis that best theory criteria like simplicity and formal rigor cannot be given theory neutral definitions, and thus must really come down to one thing: seek methods that help linguists to do their jobs with the minimum of cognitive labor. =Foundations of semantics= Ludlow's earliest work in semantics was an attempt to combine work in the theory of meaning with contemporary work in generative linguistics, but using resources that are more parsimonious than those typically used in semantic theory—for example without using the higher-order functions and intensional objects deployed in Montague grammar. The resources were largely limited to primitives like truth and reference to individuals. His subsequent work has explored ways of formalizing alternative approaches to semantic theory—including the possibility of formalizing a Wittgensteinian use theory or expressivist semantics for natural language, which is to say a theory in which the building blocks of a semantic theory are expressions of attitudes rather than primitives like truth and reference.See chapter 5 of his The Philosophy of Generative Linguistics, Oxford University Press, 2011. =Philosophy of language= Intensional transitive verbs Ludlow's PhD dissertation defended a proposal dating back to the medieval logician Jean Buridan, and revived by W.V.O. Quine in philosophy and James McCawley in linguistics, according to which so-called \\"intensional transitive verbs\\" like \\"seek\\" and \\"want\\" are really propositional attitudes in disguise. He has subsequently developed these ideas in collaboration with the linguists Richard Larson and Marcel den Dikken. Interpreted logical forms Ludlow's paper with the semanticist Richard Larson, \\"Interpreted Logical Forms\\", advocated a quasi-sententialist view of propositional attitude verbs (a view that has been criticized by Scott Soames in Chapter 7 of his book Beyond Rigidity). Ludlow's response to Soames involves the idea that propositional attitude reports are not supposed to correspond to some fact about what is going on inside the agent's head but rather are created by a speaker S, for the benefit of a hearer H, to help H form some theory about the agent being reported on. Crucial to this account is the idea that the lexicon is dynamic and that speakers engaged in conversation will negotiate the coinage of terms \\"on the fly\\" in constructing attitude reports.A version of this account can be found in Ludlow's paper \\"Interpreted Logical Forms, Belief Attribution, and the Dynamic Lexicon,\\" in K.M. Jaszczolt (ed.) \\"Pragmatics of Propositional Attitude Reports.\\" Elsevier Science, Ltd, 2000. The dynamic lexicon Ludlow's work on interpreted logical forms has led to the development of a view of linguistic meaning according to which meaning shifts are much more common than intuition suggests. He rejects the \\"common coin\\" view of word meaning, and argues that word meanings are negotiated on the fly as conversational partners build little microlanguages together. These ideas have subsequently been applied to controversies in epistemology (see below). Implicit comparison classes In his article \\"Implicit Comparison Classes\\"\\"Implicit Comparison Classes,\\" Linguistics and Philosophy 12, #4, 1989, pp. 521-533. Ludlow argues for the syntactic reality of comparison class variables in adjectival constructions. That is, when one says \\"the elephant is small\\", there is an implicit variable for the comparison class (in this case elephants, as in \\"small for an elephant\\"), and that variable is represented by the language faculty. That work was influential in subsequent work on the context sensitivity of language by Jason Stanley and Zoltán Gendler Szabó, and has played a role in debates about contextualism in contemporary epistemology. Contextualism in epistemology Recent work in epistemology has pushed back against skepticism by arguing that knowledge attributions are context sensitive—our standards of knowledge vary from context to context. So, while in a philosophy class I may not know I have hands, in other contexts (for example, chatting in a bar) I do. Ludlow initially argued that there were implicit argument positions for standards of knowledge.\\"Contextualism and the New Linguistic Turn In Epistemology\\" in G. Preyer and G. Peter (eds.) Contextualism in Philosophy. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005. In response to criticism from Jason Stanley in his book \\"Knowledge and Practical Interests\\", Ludlow has advanced a doctrine that he calls \\"Cheap Contextualism\\".“Cheap Contextualism,” Nous. Philosophical Issues 16: Annual Supplement, Sosa and Villanueva (eds.), 2007. The idea is that on the dynamic lexicon view, shifts in word meaning are ubiquitous, and the meaning of the term \\"know\\" is not an exception. Contextualism in epistemology is just a consequence of these garden variety shifts in meaning. Natural logic Ludlow has written a series of papers on the logical form of determiners (words like \\"all\\", \\"some\\", and \\"no\\") and has pursued the idea that their most interesting properties can be given purely formal or syntactic accounts. The work borrows from one of the central ideas of medieval logic—the hypothesis that all the key logical inferences can be reduced down to just two basic inferences that are sensitive to whether the syntactic environment was dictum de omni or dictum de nullo—classical notions that are basically equivalent to the contemporary notions of upward and downward entailing environments. To explain, in an upward entailing (de omni) environment a superset can be substituted for any set. In a downward entailing environment a subset may be substituted for a set. Ludlow revives the medieval project by combining it with the descriptive tools of contemporary Chomskyan linguistics and recent technical work in formal logic. Presentism and tensism Ludlow's first book, Semantics, Tense, and Time, was devoted to arguing that presentism, a metaphysical thesis that denies the reality of past and future events, is consistent with the intuitive truth of much of our tensed discourse. More recently, he has argued that while tense is an ineliminable feature of reality, the resulting position (called \\"tensism\\") does not force us to be presentists. =Conceptual issues in cyberculture= Criticizing the Greek god model of governance Most of Ludlow's work on cyberculture has centered on the question of governance for virtual worlds and he has been critical of what he calls the \\"Greek god model\\" of virtual world governance. This is a model in which virtual world platform owners do not have coherent systematic policies to deal with in world disputes, but rather reach in and dabble as suits their dispositions at the moment. In an e-book entitled \\"Our Future in Virtual Worlds\\" Ludlow argues that as our lives continue to move online, the Greek god model becomes ever more dangerous. This critique has been extended to social networking platforms more generally.\\"Monarchia Social Network.\\" Interviewed by Alessandro Longo in L'Espresso, Oct. 10, 2010. (In Italian) Online gaming chronicles Ludlow founded The Alphaville Herald on October 23, 2003. It was the unofficial newspaper for the Alphaville server of The Sims Online, where Ludlow used the avatar Urizenus Sklar. Its stories uncovered in-game scams and cyber-prostitution, and highlighted Electronic Arts' indifference to the social problems in their game. In a controversy, reported in the New York Times and elsewhere (including law journals), Ludlow was kicked out of The Sims Online after some editorials criticized Electronic Arts Corporation for their failures at managing and policing the gamespace. The newspaper subsequently migrated to another virtual world, Second Life, in June 2004. The Herald has been written about in Wired and the Columbia Journalism Review. Ludlow (in the voice of Urizenus Sklar) is currently a contributing editor, while the avatar Pixeleen Mistral, revealed by Ludlow in 2010 to be Internet pioneer Mark P. McCahill, is the newspaper's managing editor. Ludlow and Mark Wallace wrote a book about The Herald and its exploits called The Second Life Herald: the Virtual Tabloid that Witnessed the Dawn of the Metaverse (MIT Press, 2007). The book received the American Association of Publishers, Professional/Scholarly Publishing award for \\"Best Book in Media and Cultural Studies, 2007\\", was named a Choice \\"Outstanding Academic Title, 2008\\", and Library Journal honored it as a \\"Top Sci-Tech Book, 2007,\\" (they ranked it one of top 39 science books of 2007 and top book in category of Computer Science). MTV.com has described Ludlow as the \\"Unwelcome Guest\\" in the \\"10 most influential video game players of all time\\" because of his chronicles about online video games. In particular MTV wrote that EA revoked Ludlow's \\"online citizenship\\" in The Sims Online, allegedly because the \\"offense was Ludlow's publication of a TSO-centric newspaper that chronicled creative and sometimes troublesome behavior of other gamers in the world, including allegations that under-age players were involved in virtual-sex- related activities. EA claimed Ludlow's newspaper violated the terms of service for playing TSO\\" and that Ludlow later similarly chronicled the game Second Life with his The Second Life Herald. Controversies Ludlow has been a highly prominent, and sometimes controversial, figure in several virtual worlds communities, especially The Sims Online and Second Life, since the early 2000s. He has been accused by Scott Jennings and Catherine Fitzpatrick of giving griefers \\"his blessing\\" through his newspaper, The Alphaville Herald. Ludlow resigned from his position at Northwestern in November 2015 after a university disciplinary body found that he sexually assaulted two students. Ludlow denied any wrongdoing and said the relationship was consensual.McCarthy, Ciara. \\"Northwestern professor resigns after sexual harassment investigation\\", The Guardian, November 3, 2015 Fellow Northwestern professor Laura Kipnis defended him, stating that female university students should be responsible for their own decisions about whether to date a professor, and argued that \\"you have to feel a little sorry these days for professors married to their former students.

Although born in New York, he went to school in Virginia and fought in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. After attending college in Germany and Virginia, he became a lawyer. He later served in the Virginia State Senate, as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Virginia's second congressional district, and as a Virginia Circuit Court judge.  Early life  He was born in East Hampton, New York and was the first child born to former President John Tyler and his second wife, Julia Gardiner Tyler. He was named after his late maternal grandfather, David Gardiner. As a child, he attended private schools in Charles City County, Virginia. In 1862, he entered present-day Washington and Lee University, where he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, but dropped out the following year to fight in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. He was present at the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House. Following the war, he and his brother, John Alexander Tyler, traveled to Germany, and attended school in the Grand Duchy of Baden. He returned to the United States, and graduated from the Washington and Lee School of Law in 1869.  Career  From 1870 to 1884, he practiced law in Richmond, Virginia, before accepting an appointment as Director of the state lunatic asylum in Williamsburg, Virginia, serving until 1887. From 1891 to 1892, he served in the Virginia State Senate, and on the Board of Visitors of the College of William and Mary. Tyler was elected to the United States House of Representatives from the state's 2nd District, serving from 1893 to 1897. He was defeated for renomination in 1896, and returned to private law practice until his reelection to the state senate, where he served from 1900 to 1904. From 1904 until his death in 1927, he served as a state circuit court judge. =Elections= *1892; Tyler was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives defeating Independent Republicans P.C.

They are shown at auto shows and other exhibitions. Show cars can either come from car companies or from private individuals. Corporate show cars generally fall into one of three categories: * Cars intended to preview an upcoming new production model or redesigned model, either to assess or to whet the public appetite. Such preview show cars may be thinly disguised or slightly retrimmed versions of the eventual production model, painted in bold or unusual colors or fitted with unusual trim to attract attention. * Cars intended to assess the public reaction to a type of model, or a particular styling theme or feature. A prominent example was the 1938 Buick Y-Job, a custom-built Buick created by General Motors styling chief Harley Earl for his own use; although it was never produced, it contained features such as hidden headlights that later became GM styling features. Such cars typically are not intended for production themselves, but may become the basis of a production model if demand is high enough. The Dodge Viper is notable example of the latter. * Styling exercises built to reward successful designers, letting them blow off steam with a design more exciting than workaday, \\"cooking\\" sedans and trucks. Such exercises also serve to draw attention to the manufacturer's more ordinary products. Privately owned show cars are cars extensively cared for by their owners primarily for the purpose of entering car shows and can be production models or custom-made. History The creation of show cars dates back to at least the 1920s, but reached its zenith in the United States in the 1950s, when most major U.S. automakers began to exhibit wild, fanciful dream cars. The preeminent dream car maker was GM, which displayed its work at a series of traveling Motorama shows, mounted at great expense and attracting much publicity. In the 1960s American show cars became substantially more mundane, slight variations on typical production models (with exceptions like Chevrolet's Mako Shark prototype). The practice of building them fell on hard times during the 1970s, when automotive whimsy was a low priority compared to safety, emissions control, and fuel economy. The practice was revived in the 1980s, and remains strong today both in the U.S. and abroad.

A medium-pace bowler, his chief weapon was his accuracy, giving him economical bowling figures, although he occasionally would come in for punishment in the late stages of limited overs matches due to a lack of variation in his line and length. Domestic career In a three-day match for Wellington in February 1980, Chatfield played a key role in defeating the West Indies, who were at the time the best cricket team in the world, taking six wickets in the first innings and seven in the second.http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1979-80/WI_IN_NZ/WI_WELL_16-18FEB1980.html Chatfield also played for Hutt Valley in the Hawke Cup. In 1984 he was awarded the Hutt City Sportsperson of the Year award (the first person to receive this award). International career With the ball, Chatfield distinguished himself with efforts against the West Indies, the leading cricketing side of the day, on tour in 1984/85 and in the home series which New Zealand drew in 1986/87. He was also a member of the New Zealand sides which achieved the country's first Test series wins against England and Australia at home and away. Chatfield spent much of his career as the bowling partner to Sir Richard Hadlee. Coincidentally, the pair share the same birthday, though Chatfield is one year Hadlee's senior. =Head injury= Chatfield is also noted for being seriously injured on the cricket field, in the First Test against England in the 1974-75 season at Eden Park, Auckland. England were at the end of a long and difficult tour in which they had been defeated in the Ashes by Australia, chiefly by the Australian fast bowlers Jeff Thomson and Dennis Lillee. Chatfield, a number 11 batsman, was holding up England with a last wicket partnership with his future captain, Geoff Howarth. English fast bowler Peter Lever decided to test Chatfield with a bouncer. At the time helmets and other now common protective gear were not in use. The ball deflected from Chatfield's bat and struck him on the temple, rendering him unconscious and not breathing. The English team's physiotherapist Bernard Thomas was the first to realise what had happened: Chatfield had swallowed his tongue. Thomas flicked it back into place and managed to revive Chatfield with heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.Wisden 1976, pp. 954–55. Lever was distraught; Chatfield later joked that when he was visited by Lever in hospital, \\"he looked worse than I did\\". A couple of years later helmets were introduced into cricket and Chatfield wore one thereafter. =Late career= A classic no.11 batsmen, In one of the most memorable tests in New Zealand cricket history, he accompanied Wellington team mate Jeremy Coney in a partnership to defeat Pakistan at Carisbrook, Dunedin, in the 1984/85 Test series. It was technically not a last wicket win, as Lance Cairns was still available to bat, but Cairns was severely concussed at the time and essentially incapable of batting, making Chatfield his side's last hope for a series win. Chatfield managed his highest Test score, an unbeaten 21. Such was Coney's faith in his partner that Chatfield ended up facing 84 deliveries during their stand as opposed to Coney's 48. In the 1990 New Year Honours, Chatfield was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. After cricket Since retiring from first-class cricket, Chatfield has had a variety of jobs. He coached the Hutt Valley association until they merged with Wellington, worked in a chip shop, was a courier and drove a van for a dairy. He also mowed lawns, and in 2009 was working as a taxi driver in Wellington. In 2020, the 95-year old Basin Reserve Museum Stand was reopened and the Old Pavillion Stand therein was renamed for Chatfield.

Sanjay Subrahmanyam (eds.)The Mughal State, 1526-1750 Oxford University Press (Themes in Indian History) pg 251 In pre-Mughal times, the term referred to a military officer but did not refer to a specific rank. With the administrative reforms performed by Mughal emperor Akbar, this rank was systemised. It constituted an independent administrative unit and its territorial limits varied from place to place and from time to time.Ibid pg 236 A faujadari comprised a number of thanas or military outposts. At each of these the number of swears were stationed under a thanadar. Faujdari carried with it a fixed number of sawars and it was up to the faujdar to station soldiers in various thanas under him.Ibid pg 243 In addition in some faujdaris there were a number of thanas described as huzuri or huzuri mashruti. In these thanas the Thanadars were appointed directly by the central government via royal orders or at the recommendations of the Nazim or Diwan of the province. Such thanadars were to a considerable degree independent officers who could receive orders direct from the central government.

GlueX is a particle physics experiment located at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) accelerator. Its primary purpose is to better understand the nature of confinement in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by identifying a spectrum of hybrid and exotic mesons generated by the excitation of the gluonic field binding the quarks. Such mesonic states are predicted to exist outside of the well-established quark model, but none have been definitively identified by previous experiments. A broad high-statistics survey of known light mesons up to and including the J/\\\\psi is also underway. Experimental Apparatus The experiment uses photoproduction (that is, the scattering of a real photon on a nucleon) to produce mesonic states. Unlike previous similar experiments, it uses linearly polarized photons, which allows the analysis of accumulated events for certain polarization observables that are thought to make identification of exotic states feasible. The GlueX detector was installed in the new Hall D (the fourth such hall at JLab) as part of the accelerator's upgrade to 12 GeV energy.12 GeV Upgrade: Future Science at Jefferson Lab - Project Information GlueX began its first commissioning run in 2014, and first received 12 GeV electrons in 2015, the highest energy available at the CEBAF accelerator. Publication-quality physics data was accumulated during multi- weeks runs in the spring months of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The detector is based on a solenoidal hermetic detector optimized for tracking of charged particles (electron, pions, kaons, and protons) and detection of neutral particles (primarily photons). Figure 1 shows the detector. GlueX uses the coherent bremsstrahlung technique to produce a linearly polarized photon beam. In order to reach the optimal photon energy of 9 GeV for this mapping of the exotic spectrum, 12 GeV electrons are required and are provided by the CEBAF accelerator at Jefferson Lab. In 2018, improved kaon/pion separation capability will be established with the addition of a quartz-based differential Cherenkov light detector (\\"DIRC\\"). Physics Program The goal of the GlueX experiment is to search for and study hybrid mesons. Hybrid mesons, and in particular exotic hybrid mesons, provide the ideal laboratory for testing QCD in the confinement regime since these mesons explicitly manifest the gluonic degrees of freedom. Photoproduction is expected to be particularly effective in producing and identifying these states. At the same time these data will be used to study the spectrum of conventional mesons, including the poorly-understood excited vector mesons and strangeonium. The search for new mesonic states requires very specialized analysis methods since such states are rare and must be established through their decay to lighter and longer-lived particles. By examining the energy and angular distributions of produced particles through \\"partial wave analysis\\", the production and decay of all intermediate states can be reconstructed. The quantum numbers of the intermediate states can be established by this method. These quantum numbers include the spin angular momentum (J), parity (P), and charge conjugation parity (C). Many hybrid states are expected to have quantum number combinations that are the same as conventional quark-model mesons. But the quark model predicts precisely how many such states should exist, and it is expected that an \\"overpopulation\\" of certain combinations may herald hybrid states. That is, identified intermediate states with quantum numbers permitted by the quark model may be \\"hybrids\\" that contain gluonic excitation, and can be established as such if their number and pattern of mass distribution are not explained within the simple quark model. States with quantum numbers that are strictly forbidden by the naive quark model are said to be \\"exotic\\" and, if found experimentally, immediately demonstrate gluonic excitation. A list of the scientific and technical papers resulting from the GlueX program is linked at the bottom of this article. The range of questions addressed is broad, as seen in the following list of topics of present and possible future runs: * Exploration of the light meson spectrum * Partial wave decomposition of various reaction channels to identify underlying mesonic structure * Threshold photoproduction of charm and the search for associated pentaquarks * High- statistics study of eta and eta' meson production, asymmetries, and decays * Photoproduction of baryon-antibaryon pairs * Search for photoproduced Cascade resonances beyond the few well-known ones * Search for \\"leptophobic\\" states beyond the Standard Model * Eta meson decay width measurement via the Primakoff Effect * ...
