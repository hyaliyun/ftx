It is located on the courtyard in front of O‚ÄôShaughnessy Hall on the University of Notre Dame campus, which is in South bend, Indiana, and is owned by the University of Notre Dame. Description The life-sized sculpture, made of bronze, depicts St. Luke the Evangelist seated with his left foot propped up on a rock and cupping his chin with his hand. He holds a stylus in his right hand, atop a tablet balanced on his right knee. The sculpture of St. Luke, completed in 1957, is one part of a collection of four total figures located outside of O‚ÄôShaughnessy Hall on the south quad of the campus of Notre Dame. The collection includes sculptures of Christ and the Samaritan Woman, St. Luke and St. John. The pedestal it rests on is concrete. Catholic Inspiration St. Luke is the writer of the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, who has been identified with St. Paul's \\"Luke, the beloved physician\\" (Colossians 4:14). According to the early Church historian named Eusebius, Luke was born at Antioch in Syria. The collection as a whole illustrates, in St. John‚Äôs Chapter 4 in the Gospel, the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman. ‚ÄúOne day Jesus was walking to Galilee with His disciples, who continued on into the nearby Samaritan town while Jesus waited for them at Jacob‚Äôs Well. In the heat of the day, a local woman came to draw water, and she was surprised when Jesus requested a drink from her‚Äî a despised non- believer. He revealed such remarkable knowledge, even of her own life, that she asked if He were the Messiah, and He replied that He was. She hurried away, whereupon the disciples rejoined Jesus, dismayed that He had conversed with a woman of the scorned sect.‚Äù Influence of War Ivan Me≈°troviƒá supported Croatia‚Äôs liberationist movement against Italy‚Äôs attempts to seize parts of Dalmatia, Croatia in World War I. The more popular Ivan Me≈°troviƒá became, the more his politically charged art put him in danger. At the outbreak of World War I, he was forced to flee Croatia. After fleeing Croatia, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá became a professor and for 20 years was the director of the Art Institute of Zagreb. Drawing on his own poor upbringing in rural Croatia, he donated all his wages so that poor students could study art. During World War II, Hitler invited Ivan Me≈°troviƒá to exhibit in Berlin, but Ivan Me≈°troviƒá declined and was arrested and imprisoned for five months. This time allowed him to plan future religious sculptures that would later help him deal with his sadness about the war. The vatican petitioned and won the release of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá, who then lived in Rome for a time. Ivan Me≈°troviƒá did not want to go back to Yugoslavia where Marshall Tito had invited him back to. Instead, he became a professor at Syracuse University in 1947. While in New York, Ivan Me≈°troviƒá had his own exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the first one man show to ever take place there. Syracuse University is the last place Ivan Me≈°troviƒá lived before coming to the University of Notre Dame. Ivan Me≈°troviƒá at Notre Dame St. Luke In 1955, President of the University of Notre Dame Theodore Hesburgh, invited Ivan Me≈°troviƒá to come to Notre Dame where he produced 24 total works in mediums of wood, marble, bronze, as well as oil paintings. Rev. Anthony J. Lauck, CSC, founding director of the Snite Museum, chair of the art department, and a sculptor, encouraged Hesburgh to bring the renowned artist to Notre Dame.http://sniteartmuseum.nd.edu/learn/publications/catalogs-and- brochures/ivan-mestrovic-at-notre-dame-selected-campus-sculptures/ Ivan Me≈°troviƒá's presence is a lasting one at the University of Notre Dame, not only because of his numerous works spread around campus, but because he was a professor in residence for seven years at Notre Dame before he died in 1962, teaching the students who went on to create pieces influenced by his teachings. Moving to the Catholic University of Notre Dame from his previous residency at Syracuse University allowed Ivan Me≈°troviƒá to sculpt more religious pieces that demonstrated his love for the Catholic faith of his homeland, Croatia. Style ‚ÄúMany of his best works possess just such a rough, almost primitive, quality designed to dominate the viewer.‚Äù After the war, he chose to sculpt more about religion and his folk culture. This style remained consistent, with no significant changes to the end of his career. His work remained both classical and modern. Condition Bronze sculptures used to be known for their durability, but a changing world environment has ‚Äúimperiled outdoor bronze sculptures‚Äù. The St. Luke sculpture has taken on a lighter, almost blue and green color to it, likely from the copper that used to be used on the surface of bronze sculptures.

The app predicts the days on which a woman is fertile and may be used for planning pregnancy and contraception. It was developed by scientist Elina Berglund, who founded the company with her husband, Raoul Scherwitzl. The app was the first to be certified as a contraceptive in the European Union and in August 2018 the Food and Drug Administration approved U.S. marketing for the app. The app has come under criticism for misleading advertising and potential lack of efficacy.  History  Berglund was a physicist partly based at CERN, collaborating with the team who discovered the Higgs boson, before co-founding the company with her husband Scherwitzl. Because the couple was in search of an alternative natural contraceptive themselves, Berglund used data analysis to develop an algorithm designed to pinpoint her ovulation. The couple then decided to create an app with the underlying algorithm, Natural Cycles. Following several medical trials, the app became the first tech-based device to be certified for use as contraception in the European Union in February 2017 by the European inspection and certification organisation T√úV S√úD. In November 2017 Natural Cycles received a $30M investment in series B round led by EQT Ventures fund, with participation from existing investors Sunstone, E-ventures and Bonnier Growth Media (the VC arm of privately held Swedish media group, the Bonnier Group). While the app is currently only certified in the European Union, where its users are concentrated in the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries, it is available worldwide. Natural Cycles offers a subscription product, which had over 800,000 users across 160 countries as of June 2018. 75 percent use the app as a contraceptive, and the rest use it to try and become pregnant. The app works by taking your temperature each morning, under the tongue as soon as you wake up in the morning and logging it into the app. This is done with a basal thermometer. The apps algorithm calculation is based on the observation that post-ovulation, progesterone warms the female body by up to 0.45C. Natural Cycles algorithm then determines, based on the temperature, whether the user is fertile or not. A red day means fertile (which is when you should abstain or use a condom), a green day means not fertile. For the app to remain effective, women need to follow the app's instructions correctly, and it does not protect its users from sexually transmitted diseases. In 2019, the company completed a pilot program in Sweden that tested a feature to help women trying to get pregnant determine if they should seek fertility help. A new mode also became available in 2019 that helps users monitor pregnancy.  Research  Studies carried out by the app's creators have found it to be as effective in preventing pregnancies as the contraceptive pill. These studies, however, only consider women who used the app in a \\"perfect use\\" scenario - the rate of pregnancies was higher when considering all users - and only considered users who were paying members and were within the age range 20-35. Criticism In 2018, S√∂dersjukhuset, a hospital in Stockholm, Sweden filed a complaint with the Medical Products Agency of Sweden after 37 women who had been using Natural Cycles as their primary method of contraception sought an abortion at the hospital after becoming pregnant unintentionally. Natural Cycles responded by saying the number of pregnancies was within the reported effectiveness rates.http://www.businessinsider.com/natural-cycles-under-investigation- unwanted-pregnancies-2018-1https://naturalcycles.com/en/science In the UK, the app came under investigation by the Advertising Standards Authority over supposedly misleading claims in its marketing; the complaint was upheld by the ASA in August 2018, concluding that the app misled consumers regarding being \\"highly accurate\\" and a \\"clinically tested alternative to birth control\\". A number of users and healthcare professionals have expressed concerns over the efficacy of the app. In August 2018, Lauren Streicher, professor of clinical obstetrics at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine expressed concerns over the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the app. Streicher has claimed that the app is \\"problematic\\" as it relies on users' self-reported temperatures which must be taken as soon as they wake up each morning in order to be accurate. In an interview with Vox, Streicher claimed \\"The minute you rely on action, the efficacy goes down.‚Äù Natural Cycles has also been criticised for its marketing strategy of paying social media influencers to promote the app. In July 2018 researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published a study which claimed ‚ÄúNatural Cycles‚Äô marketing materials ought to be entirely transparent, more clear than they currently are about the limitations of their app and pregnancy risks‚Äù  See also  * Calendar-based contraceptive methods * Natural family planning  References  Birth control Women's health Fertility awareness Medical software ","title":"Natural Cycles"},{"id":"52559080","text":"Moses is an outdoor bronze sculpture by Croatian artist Josip Turkalj.

The sculpture represents Moses lecturing the Israelites, who in his absence had fallen into idolatry. Moses' hand is pointing into the sky to proclaim that there is only one God. As Notre Dame has a long history of renaming statues with football reference, Moses has been awarded the name of First Down Moses. Much like the South panel of the Hesburgh Library which was named Touchdown Jesus. Also, the statue of Father Corby in front of Corby Hall is nicknamed Fair Catch Corby. First Down Moses, according to students, also signals that the Notre Dame football team is number one, hence the statue's hand pointing to the sky. One of the controversies that exist surrounding the sculpture is the representation of Moses with horns in is head. Initially it was thought to be \\"a mistranslation, because the Hebrew word for horns can also refer to rays of light.\\" Nevertheless, as scholars have continued to research they have come to the conclusion that the representation of Moses with horns may have been \\"referring to one of the most famous depictions of Moses in sculpture, the early-16th century statue by Michelangelo that forms part of part of the tomb of Pope Julius II.\\" See also * Michelangelo * University of Notre Dame * Ivan Me≈°troviƒá References 1962 sculptures Cattle in art Outdoor sculptures in Notre Dame Sculptures of Moses University of Notre Dame Public Art Collection ","title":"Moses, Notre Dame"},{"id":"52559088","text":"King of Moomba may refer to: * King of Moomba, awarded at the Moomba festival * \\"King of Moomba\\" (song), a single by Do-R√©-Mi ","title":"King of Moomba"},{"id":"52559091","text":"Patersonia occidentalis, commonly known as purple flag or long purple flag, is a perennial herbaceous plant that is endemic to Western Australia.

(903-June 23, 960Academia Sinica Chinese-Western Calendar Converter.), alternative name Feng Yansi (), courtesy name Zhengzhong (), was a famed poet and politician of the Chinese Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period state Southern Tang, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Southern Tang's second emperor Li Jing (Emperor Yuanzong).  Background  Feng Yanji was born in 903, during the reign of the late-Tang Emperor Zhaozong. He was from Guangling (Âª£Èôµ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). His father was named Feng Lingjun (), who was a military officer at Guangling. He had at least one younger half-brother named Feng Yanlu, who would later also be a prominent politician. (Feng Yanlu's mother was described as Feng Yanji's stepmother, so Feng Lingjun probably married her after Feng Yanji's mother's death, although that is not completely clear.) While Feng Yanji and Feng Yanlu were half-brothers and would eventually be political allies, they did not have a good relationship, and neither did Feng Yanji with Feng Yanlu's mother. At one point, Xu Zhigao, the adoptive son of Wu (which was the state that succeeded Tang in the lower Yangtze River region) regent Xu Wen, commissioned Feng Lingjun as the secretary of the bureau of salt and iron monopolies at She Prefecture (Ê≠ôÂ∑û, in modern Huangshan, Anhui). Feng Yanji apparently followed his father there, for it was mentioned that, in 916, there was a time when the prefect of She, Gu Yan (), was very ill, and rumors spread that Gu was already dead, causing destabilization of morale among the soldiers. At Feng Lingjun's request, Feng Yanji, then 13, went to see Gu, and then, after exiting Gu's mansion, relayed Gu's words to the officers, causing the soldiers to be calmed. As he grew older, he became known for his elegance and writing skills.  During Li Bian's reign  At one point, Feng Yanji, then a civilian, went to see Xu Zhigao ‚Äî who had, by that point, seized the Wu throne and established a new state of Southern Tang and had changed his own name to Li Bian ‚Äî and Li Bian made him a Mishulang (ÁßòÊõ∏ÈÉé, assistant at the Palace Library). After Li Bian's oldest son Li Jing the Prince of Qi was given the title of Generalissimo in 939,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Feng was made his secretary, in addition to his then position of Jiabu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu). Feng became a close associate to Li Jing's advisor Chen Jue, and as Chen was closely aligned with the chancellor Song Qiqiu, also became a member of Song's party. It was said he found ways to expel that of those who worked in Li Jing's headquarters who had higher positions than he did. He once jokingly spoke to a higher- ranked official, Sun Sheng, who carried the title of Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé, deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng), stating, \\"What abilities do you have, Lord, that you get to be Zhongshu Shilang?\\" Sun, who had long despised Feng, responded: While serving at Li Jing's headquarters, Feng Yanji and Feng Yanlu had often advocated reversing the ban disallowing people from selling their sons and daughters into servitude, but Li Bian, agreeing with the advice of the official Xiao Yan () that that effectively would enslave the children of the poor in favor of the rich, disapproved. The official Chang Mengxi () often spoke to Li Bian against Feng Yanji, Chen, and Wei Cen (), and Li Bian had considered removing them from Li Jing's staff, but had not yet done so by 943, when Li Bian fell seriously ill and thereafter died. Li Jing then poised to take the throne. As he was preparing to do so, Feng Yanji, who was happy about Li Bian's death and Li Jing's succession, often went into the palace to make reports to him, up to three to four times a day. Li Jing responded to his aggressiveness by responding, \\"A secretary has his own responsibilities. Why are you being so tedious?\\" He and Feng Yanlu were apparently put in charge of drafting the public will/final edict on Li Bian's behalf, and they inserted the provision allowing the sale of sons and daughters that they had advocated but Li Bian had disapproved of. Xiao submitted a report to Li Jing, pointing out Li Bian's prior disapproval. Li Jing reviewed Li Bian's archives and realized that this was the case, but decided not to strike that provision from the will, as it had already been published.  During Li Jing's reign  After Li Jing formally took the throne, he entrusted much of the governance to Chen Jue. Feng Yanji, Feng Yanlu, Wei Cen, and Cha Wenhui () were all in close association with Chen and influential in decision-making, and they were referred to by their detractors as the \\"Five Ghosts.\\" Feng Yanji received the positions of Jianyi Daifu () and imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). He was soon promoted to deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang) and chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi), and soon received the title of Zhongshu Shilang. As of 944, Li Jing wanted to eventually pass the throne to his younger brothers Li Jingsui the Prince of Qi and Li Jingda the Prince of Yan. Feng Yanji and his partisans wanted to use this case to control the officials' access to the emperor, and therefore encouraged him to issue an edict stating, \\"Li Jingsui the Prince of Qi shall oversee all policy matters. Of all the officials, only the deputy chiefs of staff Chen Jue and Cha Wenhui shall be allowed to report to the emperor; for all others, they shall not be allowed to do so unless summoned.\\" This greatly shocked the state, and the imperial guard officer Jia Chong () was eventually able to persuade Li Jing to reverse the decision. In 945, when Cha was commanding an army attacking Southern Tang's southeastern neighbor Min's then-capital Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian), Feng Yanji, Feng Yanlu, and Wei, as his allies, all greatly advocated for his army to be well-supplied, such that it was said that the imperial treasury was entirely drained, and that the people of nearby prefectures ‚Äî Hong (Ê¥™Â∑û, in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), Rao (È•íÂ∑û, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), F«î (Êí´Â∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Jiangxi), and Xin (‰ø°Â∑û, in modern Shangrao) ‚Äî particularly suffered.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. Cha was eventually able to capture Jian Prefecture and force Min's last emperor Wang Yanzheng to surrender, allowing Southern Tang to take over a substantial part of Min territory. However, Min's traditional capital F√∫ Prefecture (Á¶èÂ∑û, in modern Fuzhou, Fujian, note different tone) was still in the hands of the warlord Li Hongyi, who was paying nominal allegiance to both Southern Tang and its northern neighbor Later Jin. When Chen volunteered to go see Li Hongyi to persuade him to give up his control of F√∫, Li Hongyi was arrogant to him and refused. Chen subsequently forged an order in Li Jing's name, conscripting the troops of Jian, F«î, Xin, and Ting (Ê±ÄÂ∑û, in modern Longyan, Fujian) Prefectures and putting them under the command of Feng Yanlu so that he could lead a campaign against Li Hongyi.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. However, the Southern Tang forces were eventually crushed in spring 947 by the relief forces sent by Wuyue's king Qian Hongzuo and were forced to retreat in defeat, ending Southern Tang's hopes of taking all of Min territory. (In light of the Southern Tang losses, it also soon lost effective control of the Quan (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian) and Nan (ÂçóÂ∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) Prefectures region to the warlord Liu Congxiao, although Liu remained in nominal allegiance to Southern Tang.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Meanwhile, in 946, Li Jing had made Feng Yanji a chancellor (with the title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ()), along with Li Jianxun. It was said that Li Jianxun was skilled in administrative matters but indecisive, while Feng was capable in literary matters, but was wicked and partisan in his decision making, often covering for his inadequacies by using grand words to persuade people of his correctness. After Li Jing formalized his intended succession arrangement by creating Li Jingsui the Crown Prince and Li Jingda the Prince of Qi in 947, Feng, wanting to ingratiate Li Jingsui and Li Jingda into believing that he was responsible for this arrangement, once, at a feast held at Li Jingsui's crown prince palace, caressed Li Jingda's back and stated, \\"You should not forgive me!\\" Li Jingda was offended, and immediately went to see Li Jing, demanding Feng's execution. Li Jing had to spend much time dissuading Li Jingda from the demand. After Chen's and Feng Yanlu's defeat, Li Jing considered executing them, but when the imperial censor Jiang Wenwei () submitted an article of impeachment that not only dealt with Chen and Feng Yanlu, but also Feng Yanji and Wei, Li Jing was angered by what he saw as its exaggeration, and demoted Jiang. He subsequently exiled Chen and Feng Yanlu, rather than killing them. Subsequently, Feng Yanji was demoted to the title of Taidi Shaobao (), an advisor to Li Jingsui. (Feng Yanji was apparently then given the honorary title of military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhaowu Circuit (Êò≠Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Guangyuan, Sichuan, then under the control of Later Shu), and then left governmental service for some time to observe a mourning period for his mother ‚Äî or possibly stepmother (i.e., Feng Yanlu's mother) ‚Äî and then was restored to a general title, and then made Taidi Taibao (Â§™ÂºüÂ§™‰øù, senior advisor to Li Jingsui) and (honorarily) military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi, then under the control of Later Jin's successor state Later Han. In 952, Li Jing again made Feng Yanji chancellor, along with Xu Jingyun () (who was removed not long after) and Sun Sheng. Feng also received the title of Zuo Pushe (Â∑¶ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, one of the heads of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng)). When the edict announcing the commission of the three chancellors was publicly read, Chang Mengxi publicly ridiculed it by stating, \\"The edict was wonderfully written, but not as wonderfully as Jiang Wenwei's petition!\\" Sun, who did not have a good opinion of Feng, privately stated, \\"How is it that a golden goblet and a jade bowl now contains dog feces?\\" As chancellor again, Feng argued to Li Jing that chancellors should be given full authority to make decisions for the state, and Li Jing agreed, giving Feng full authority to rule on things, but Feng did not actually have the ability to do so, so he relied on his administrators for civilian matters and generals for military matters, without actually ruling on anything himself. Finding this situation untenable, Li Jing began making his own decisions again. However, when Xiao Yan, who repeatedly attacked Feng and who was then the chief judge of the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂçø, Dali Qing), erroneously sentenced a woman to death, when other officials Zhong Mo () and Li Deming () wanted to use this opportunity to condemn Xiao to death, Feng defended Xiao based on his years of loyal service, and Xiao was spared. Because of this, Feng was praised by many.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 290. It was said that the reason why Feng was able to gain Li Jing's favor was that he constantly advocated strategies for taking the Central Plains. Feng became so arrogant that he showed open contempt for Li Bian's insistence on peace, praising Li Jing instead for Li Jing's willingness to use force.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294. One of the things that Li Jing had to decide shortly after Feng and Sun were made chancellors was what to do with the lands of Southern Tang's southwestern neighbor Chu, whose last ruler Ma Xichong had surrendered to Southern Tang in 951, ending Chu. Despite Ma's surrender, however, Southern Tang effectively only had control of one of Chu's three main circuits, Wu'an (Ê≠¶ÂÆâ, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan, i.e., Chu's former capital Tan Prefecture (). Wuping Circuit (Ê≠¶Âπ≥, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan) was in the hands of the Chu general Liu Yan, and Jingjiang Circuit (ÈùúÊ±ü, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi) was seized by Chu's southern neighbor Southern Han. Li Jing's plans in 951 had been to take those circuits by force, but by 952, he was weary of the campaigns, and considered abandoning the Jingjiang project entirely and try to gain Liu's nominal allegiance by making him military governor. Sun agreed with the idea, but Feng opposed, arguing that acquiescing with just taking Wu'an would make Southern Tang appear weak. Li Jing agreed with Feng and continued the campaigns, but the general Li Jing sent to attack Jingjiang, Zhang Luan (), was defeated by Southern Han forces with great loss. Subsequently, Liu launched a surprise attack on Tan, catching Southern Tang's military governor of Wu'an, Bian Hao, by complete surprise. Bian abandoned Tan and fled, leading to Southern Tang's loss of the circuit and effectively gaining nothing from the Chu adventure. In light of this, both Feng and Sun resigned their chancellorships, but retained their Pushe titles. However, Feng was again made chancellor in spring 953.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 291. In 956, in the midst of a major invasion by Later Han's successor state Later Zhou, Li Jing decided to send a high-level delegation to meet with the Later Zhou emperor Guo Rong, hoping to persuade Guo to stop his campaign. The delegation was to be headed by Sun. Sun pointed out to Feng that, as Feng's title was more honored than Sun's, Feng should have gone, but that he would nevertheless go despite the dangers. As Sun feared, his efforts were unsuccessful, and Guo put him to death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 293. The war only ended in 958 when Southern Tang capitulated and ceded all of its territory north of the Yangtze River, and also agreed to be a vassal to Later Zhou. After that agreement was reached, Li Jing sent Feng to Guo's court to submit a tribute of silver, textile, money, tea, and grains, for Guo's army to use. Shortly after, with Southern Tang now being a vassal, many high-level officials' titles were reduced to show submission to Later Zhou.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.  Description  It is a two-and-a-half-story wood frame house with simple detailing on a concrete block foundation. It is about in plan, and it has a one-story addition to the rear and a one-story porch. It looks distinctive relative to simpler gable roof houses, as it has a jerkinhead which clips off the pointy end of the gable, and it has returning eaves, thus making a trapezoidal shape on the front facade above the second floor windows. As of 2009, the house had its original clapboard siding and had recently been painted green with white and maroon trim, compatible with its appearance when Susan La Flesche Picotte lived there. Includes nine photos from 2008. Also included on the property is a carriage house/garage which housed the carriage that she used to travel in her duties as a doctor and as a tribal leader.  History  Picotte lived in the home from 1907 until her death in 1916. The Dr. Susan Picotte Memorial Hospital, also in Walthill, was built in 1912-13 to serve as a facility for her practice.

Tiedemann is most known for his commission of the historic Franklin Castle (aka \\"Hannes Tiedemann House\\" or \\"Tiedemann House\\") in 1881. The property has been notoriously catalogued as one of the top fifty most haunted houses in America, and one of the most haunted sites in Ohio.  Early years  Tiedemann, was born in Prussia, and emigrated from Germany to New York in 1848 with his family ‚Äì his mother, Wiebka (also spelled Wiebeka), his brothers, Claus and Ludwig, and his sisters, Catharina, Rebecca Eliese, and Lowiese. His father had died in 1846.  Businesses  By about 1850, Tiedemann worked as an apprentice to a barrel maker, which relocated him to Royalton, Ohio. He moved to Cleveland around 1855 and worked as a clerk for Babcock & Hurd, a wholesale grocer, and resided at Bennett Forest City House, a rooming house at Cleveland's Public Square. In 1864, Tiedemann was a wholesale grocer in the firm of Weidemann & Tiedemann, having begun the business with John Christian Weiderman. In 1871, Tiedemann sold out his interests in Weideman & Tiedemann, though he retained business offices within its building. In 1883, Tiedemann founded and was Vice-President of Savings & Trust Co., newly permitted at that time by Ohio state law to form as a trust company. In January 1907, he retired from United Savings and Banking Co. of Cleveland, where he had become president, following his involvement in many Cleveland area banks.  Personal life  In 1862, Tiedemann married Luisa (also referred to as Louise or Louisa) H√∂ck (also spelled Hook or Hoeoek). The Tiedemann family consisted of Hannes, his wife, Luisa, his mother, Wiebka, and six children: Wilhelmine Hanna (died in infancy), August Johannes (survived to adulthood), Emma (died at 15), Ernst (died in infancy), Dora Louise (survived to adulthood), and Albert (died in infancy), though it is alleged that Tiedemann also fathered another child, named Herbert, with a woman named Ella May Clark. After losing his wife, Luisa, in 1895 to liver failure, Tiedemann remarried. His second wife was named Henrietta. This subsequent marriage led to rumors regarding Luisa's purported cause of death. Tiedemann's second marriage ended in divorce after one year. Tiedemann died on January 22, 1908, following a massive stroke he suffered while on a walk in a park, though it has been claimed that he died due to complications relating to Arterial Sclerosis.  Franklin Castle (\\"Tiedemann House\\") and Stone Castle  In late 1880, Tiedemann built two houses. Although it was named \\"Stone Castle\\", the first house was not constructed of stone and did not resemble a castle either. It was built in the popular half-timbered Tudor-revival style of the time. His second home, also known as the \\"Franklin Castle\\", named after the road on which it was built, that has Tiedemann steeped into paranormal history.

She writes about war and peace, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, humanitarian aid, and the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Her research has influenced policy interventions as well as scholarly debates on peacebuilding and on Congo. She is a Professor of Political Science at Barnard College, Columbia University (New York, US), where she specializes in international relations and African studies.  Education  Autesserre holds a post-doctorate from Yale University (2007), a Ph.D. in political science from New York University (2006), master's degrees in international relations and political science from Columbia University (2000) and Sciences Po (France, 1999), respectively, and a B.A in political science from Sorbonne University (France, 1997).  Books and scholarly publications  Autesserre's early research focused on local violence and international intervention in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It culminated in her book, The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding, released by Cambridge University Press in 2010. This book explains why international efforts to end civil wars often fail. Drawing from interviews and field research, it presents a case study of the international intervention during the Democratic Republic of Congo's unsuccessful transition from war to peace and democracy (2003‚Äì06). It argues that local rivalries over land, resources, and political power motivated widespread violence. However, an international peacebuilding culture shaped the intervention strategy in a way that precluded action on local conflicts, ultimately dooming the international effort. Book cover - The Trouble with the Congo Research for this project also appeared in Foreign Affairs, International Organizationhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0020818309090080/type/JOURNAL_ARTICLE the Review of African Political Economy, the African Studies Review,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/african-studies- review/article/div-classtitlelocal-violence-national-peace-postwar-settlement- in-the-eastern-dr-congo-20032006div/8AEB72455D2B584F3725A97610C6B440, the African Security Review,http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rasr20/20/2 International Peacekeeping, the Revista de Relaciones Internationales, and the Journal of Humanitarian Assistance. Autessere's second book, Peaceland: Conflict Resolution and the Everyday Politics of International Intervention, was released by Cambridge University Press in 2014 and focuses on the everyday elements that influence peacebuilding interventions on the ground. It included fieldwork in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and comparative research in Burundi, Cyprus, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, South Sudan, and Timor-Leste. The book suggests a new explanation for why international peace interventions so often fail to reach their full potential. It demonstrates that everyday elements ‚Äì such as the expatriates‚Äô social habits and common approaches to understanding their areas of operation ‚Äì strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Through this analysis of the interveners‚Äô everyday life and work, Peaceland proposes innovative ways to better help host populations build a sustainable peace. Book cover - Peaceland Findings from this project have also appeared in Critique Internationalehttp://www.sciencespo.fr/ceri/sites/sciencespo.fr.ceri/files/critique_add/art_sa.pdf and African Affairs. Autesserre is currently finalizing a third book, entitled The Frontlines of Peace: An Insider's Guide to Changing the World, which will be released in early 2021 (hardcover and ebook by Oxford University Press, Audiobook by Audible). In it, she shares the stories of the ordinary yet extraordinary individuals who have built peace in their local communities. Using field research from all over the globe, she argues that the world must fundamentally reimagine the way peace is built‚Äînot through outside interventions‚Äîbut rather through the everyday, grassroots efforts of local people and movements. Findings from this project have appeared in International Peacekeeping, the International Studies Review, the Washington Post, and Foreign Affairs.  Media  Autesserre has published columns, essays, and op-eds in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, African Arguments, and The International Herald Tribune. In 2014 she gave a TED talk that has since been translated into 19 languages.

His league and championship career with the Kerry senior team spanned twelve seasons from 1943 to 1954. Born in Killarney, County Kerry, Lyne was raised in a family that had a strong association with the game of Gaelic football. His brothers, Dinny and Mikey, both enjoyed All- Ireland success with Kerry. Lyne's nephew, Pat Spillane, was an eight-time All-Ireland medal winner with Kerry between 1975 and 1986. Lyne played competitive Gaelic football during his schooling at St. Brendan's College. Here he claimed a Dunloe Cup medal before later winning county senior championship medals as a dual player. Lyne subsequently joined the Killarney Legion club and enjoyed an eighteen-year senior championship career, winning one county senior championship medal in 1946. Lyne made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of seventeen when he was selected for the Kerry minor team in 1941. He enjoyed one championship season with the minor team, however, he ended the year as All-Ireland runner-up. Long made his senior debut in a tournament game in 1943. Over the course of the next twelve seasons, he won two All-Ireland medals in 1946 and 1953. Long also won eight Munster medals. After being dropped from the Kerry team prior to the 1954 All- Ireland final, he played his last game for Kerry later than year in a tournament. After being chosen on the Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1945, Lyne was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for much of the next decade. During that time he won three Railway Cup medals. In retirement from playing, Lyne continued his association with Kerry by becoming involved in team management and coaching. He was a selector with the Kerry senior team that claimed All-Ireland honours in 1955. Over a decade later Lyne returned to the senior team as trainer. In his four seasons in charge he guided the team to two successive All-Ireland Championships, three successive Munster Championships and two National Leagues.

Powe Jr. is an American lawyer, currently the Anne Green Regents Chair in Law at University of Texas at Austin, and leading Supreme Court historian of law. Early years and education Powe's father was from Los Angeles. Powe Sr. attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he ran the mile in track, and in 1941 was graduated from Boalt Hall School of Law. He married Nellie Sheafe, and moved near her family in Oakland, California. Powe was born in 1943 in Oakland, California. After the war his parents moved to Seattle where he was raised. He majored in American History at Yale and graduated in 1965 and married Carolyn McKenny of Seattle, WA. He then went to the University of Washington School of Law where he graduated number one in his class and was Articles Editor of the Law Review. After two years teaching at the University of British Columbia he was selected as Law Clerk to Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas for the 1970 Term. Teaching and scholarship In 1971, he joined the University of Texas faculty. He holds the Anne Green Regents Chair and teaches in the Law School and Government Department. He has been a Visiting Professor at the University of California Berkeley, the University of Connecticut, and Georgetown University Law Center. Powe's scholarship has analyzed government regulation and the role of the Supreme Court in shaping society. In Powe's 1987 book, American Broadcasting and the First Amendment, he urged deregulation of broadcast media, in contrast to the theory in favor of television regulation put forth by Lee C. Bollinger.Ayres, Ian (1988). \\"Halfway Home: On Powe's American Broadcasting and the First Amendment,\\" 13 Law & Soc. Inquiry 413. A key difference between newspapers, on the one hand, and television stations, on the other, is that broadcasters are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission. No matter what politically sensitive stories a newspaper prints, the government cannot take away its presses. But a television station that offends the government can have its license revoked, a paradigm that can contribute to self-censorship, Powe argued. In his 2000 book, The Warren Court and American Politics, Powe contended the flaw in the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren was an attempt at social engineering at the expense of fidelity to the Constitution. One scholar described Powe's criticism: \\"it was a result- oriented Court, less concerned with legal reasoning than with the outcome. Powe writes that 'it is difficult to speak of an overriding jurisprudence apart from the results reached.' But what were the right results? What drove the Court? For Powe, the answer is straightforward: 'From the justices' points of view, the Court's prime role was to facilitate the policies ordained by the elected branches.'\\" Powe's second book on the Court, The Supreme Court and the American Elite, 1789-2008 was described by Princeton's Keith Whittington as \\"the best one volume history of the Supreme Court ever published.\\" His third book on the Court, \\"America‚Äôs Lone Star Constitution: How Supreme Court Cases from Texas Shape America\\" combines Texas history with that of the Court. When Powe was selected by the alumni (or ‚ÄúExes‚Äù as the University of Texas calls its alums) as one of the ten best teachers in the university in 2019, he became the only faculty member to hold that distinction along with the honor of having one of his books (The Warren Court and American Politics) selected by a faculty committee as the best book published by a Texas faculty member that year. In 2010, Powe stated he admired Justices Louis D. Brandeis and Robert H. Jackson. Powe is a member of the American Law Institute. He was a reviewer for the History Book Club for almost thirty years.

It was called \\"Morning Star rebellion\\" because of the mace, commonly called \\"morning star\\", which was used by the leader of the rebels as a royal scepter. The situation in Sweden had been a bit tense in the countryside in 1650, when the peasantry had protested and boycotted the law that required those living on the land of a noble family to serve in their land, protests which were however successful, as Queen Christina had this duty limited by law. Nonetheless, it created some tension. The rebellion started in N√§rke in February 1653 as a protest against prescriptions of soldiers and hard taxation during a famine. Messengers calling for rebellion were passed among the peasantry and the rebels armed themselves and elected their leader as king and a maid as queen in the \\"Peasant Kingdom\\" they aspired to create. The majority of the rebels belonged to the poorest part of the peasantry, such as and Forest Finns rather than regular farmers. Under the leadership of a former soldier, the rebels traveled around requiting more peasant soldiers from adjoining parishes with the plan to eventually spread through the nation. A noblewoman who traveled through the area wrote to her son that a member of the peasantry estate in the Riksdag of the Estates had told some of her staff: \\"What the peasants had in mind, that they wished to kill the nobility. Which is why I ask in the name of the death God has suffered, not to show yourself there... I do not know how I will travel up there, because they say they are as crazy in Sm√•land...\\" Englund, Peter, Ofreds√•r: om den svenska stormaktstiden och en man i dess mitt, 2. uppl., Atlantis, Stockholm, 1994, p. 517-18 However, the rebels did not manage to secure support from the majority of the peasantry and find recruits sufficient to stand against the royal army commanded against them by Queen Christina. The wealthier farmers refused to join, and many of the men who were requited only did so because they were threatened. The rebel army mainly traveled around in fruitless attempts to secure support and make recruits, and when the royal troops arrived, they initially managed to avoid them. Without support from the population, the rebels could not defeat the army and were soon betrayed and captured by the royal troops. Some rebels, notably Anders M√•nsson i Holmen and Henrik Matsson i Gryten, were killed on the spot. The \\"king\\" and the military commander of the rebels, Olof M√•rtensson and Nils M√•rtensson, were taken to the capital of Stockholm and executed by breaking wheel in April 1653. The leader posing as a monarch had a crown of heated iron pressed over his head and his arms, legs and spin crushed by the mace he used as a scepter.

Prior to opening her own firm, she worked as a teacher and as an executive secretary for the Citrus Company of Belize. Since 1981, she has been producing pepper sauce and in 2016 was inducted into the Hot Sauce Hall of Fame. She is the founder and owner of Marie Sharp's Fine Foods Ltd. Early life Marie Sharp was born in 1940 in Belize City in British Honduras. Her parents were originally from San Pedro Town on Ambergris Caye, but moved to Belize City shortly before her birth. The couple separated when she was eight years old, and Sharp moved with her father to Dangriga, because of the schooling opportunities. In San Pedro, most schools taught only Spanish, but in Dangriga, she quickly learned the Garifuna language and attended school where English was taught. Graduating from high school in 1958, Sharp passed her Senior Cambridge Exams. Career Sharp began her career as a teacher, working in various elementary schools for six years. For the ten years following, she served as an executive secretary of the Citrus Company of Belize. Her second husband was a farmer, and his family owned a 400-acre farm, Melinda Estates Limited. Sharp would spend spare time at the farm and plant various crops that grew well in the country. She originally planted chili peppers for a hot sauce manufacturer who took only a small amount of her habanero peppers. To prevent them from spoiling, Sharp grated the peppers and made barrels of pepper mash. Working during the day for the Citrus Company, Sharp experimented with various vegetable combinations to make hot sauce and gave them away to friends. At their urging, she began to manufacture the sauce and in 1981, began Marie Sharp‚Äôs Fine Foods. Her first product was called \\"Melinda's\\" after the farm owned by her husband's family. For ten years, she worked to build the brand, expanding into jams, jellies, and marmalades made with tropical fruit. In 1988, with the help of the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the United States Agency for International Development, she attended Clemson University, studying food packaging. Sharp found a distributor in the United States and began to market the product internationally. It was the first Belizean-made export product to gain wide acceptance and the only habanero-based sauce on the market at that time. In a marketing move, the distributor filed a trademark on the name. When Sharp found out in 1991 that the distributor had trademarked her product, she hired a lawyer. Because of the cost involved, travel constraints and the fact that as her sole distributor she could not work, Sharp eventually gave up the name to her sauce in exchange for a release of her contractual obligations, after a five-year struggle. Though the situation required that she start over with new branding, Sharp was determined and re-branded with her own name that same year. In 2000, the Government of Belize facilitated her completing a course on food processing in Honduras at Zamorano Pan-American Agricultural School. Sharp also took a course on business management with the Belize Institute of Management and several courses on marketing and manufacturing practices in Jamaica and Barbados. After years of struggling to get her products on shelves in the United States, Sharp was contacted by a distributor for a major superstore and began exporting her products to U.S. markets in 2003, though she refused to sign an exclusive distributorship arrangement. The arrangement brought her products, which were already available in Central America to all North American markets. Soon after, she was approved to do business in Japan and her Japanese distributor contracted to take the product to other parts of Asia, Europe and Oceania. Her products known as Marie Sharp's have been widely recognized. She received the Gold prize in the 20th Food and Beverage Competition of D√ºsseldorf, Germany. In 2013, her entries at the Anuga Food Fair in Cologne made the prestigious \\"Taste13 Showcase\\" round and Sharp's sauce placed in the top three. In 2014, she was honored by Belize's Special Envoy for Women and Children as a woman trailblazer. Sharp was inducted into the Hot Sauce Hall of Fame in 2016. In June 2017 Mrs. Sharp¬¥s Products won twice golden awards in 2 out of 3 categories at the German Chili Award in Hanover/Germany. Personal life Sharp has been married twice. Her first husband, with whom she had three sons, died of cancer. She remarried, and her second husband brought his seven children, two girls and five boys, into the family.

Wing Generator is located on the University of Notre Dame Campus in Notre Dame, IN, near the city of South Bend, and is owned by the Snite Museum of Art of the University of Notre Dame. The large sculpture of corroded steel incorporates an abstract wing shape formed of several smaller sculpted pieces on top of a rectangular base. Description Wing Generator is an outdoor sculpture featuring smaller abstract sculpted pieces implicative of industrial and biomorphic forms welded together to form a larger shape evocative of a wing. The largest piece of Wing Generator extends approximately three feet from the center of the sculpture while a smaller spade-shaped piece extends one foot from the center in the opposite direction. A distinct gear shape can be found on the lower right side of the object if one is facing the sculpture head-on. The sculpture is mounted on a large podium with a rectangular base. The base and sculpture are made out of corten steel pieces welded together, which have been artificially corroded to appear highly rusted. The sculpture measures 59 x 48 x 60‚Äô‚Äô. Historical information Wing Generator (1980) was originally conceived as a gravesite monument commissioned for Hunt‚Äôs deceased friend Hobart Taylor, Jr. through his will. According to Hunt, Wing Generator is a hybridization of the winged sculptures of Nike, the deity of victory, found in Greco-Roman sculpture such as the famous Winged Victory of Samothrace, and the avian motifs found on the iron staffs of the Yoruba culture in Africa. Hunt owned several Yoruba staffs in his private collection of African art, the forms of which he strove to replicate in Wing Generator. Hunt has also stated that the theme of victory in the work can be extended to the Christian idea of the victory of life after death. The theme of victory was employed in the sculpture to symbolize the victories of Taylor during his career as a civic lawyer. The various sculpted forms of mechanical appearance found in Wing Generator, contributing to the Generator aspect of its title, relate to Taylor‚Äôs involvement in cases surrounding General Electric, U.S. Steel, and Eastern Airlines. Hunt made a replica of the sculpture, later sold to the Snite Museum of Art at the University of Notre Dame [1]. =Location history= In 2010, the Snite Museum of Art contacted Richard Hunt in order to express their interest in purchasing one of his sculptures.[2] Other works by Hunt owned by the Snite Museum of Art include Hybrid Form (1986), Untitled (1968), Standing Form #5 (1962), and Natural Form (1969).[3] The sculpture is one of five contemporary sculptures (George Rickey's Two Lines Oblique, Deborah Butterfield‚Äôs Tracery, Stephen DeStaebler's Single Winged Figure on Plinth and Peter Randall-Page's Little Seed comprising the other four works) curated for the Charles B. Hayes Sculpture Park that would be completed in the late fall of 2012.[4] Wing Generator was purchased in September 2010 for $70,000.[5] Before delivering the sculpture to the Snite Museum, Hunt attached the sculpture to a large rectangular base that placed the work approximately three feet above ground in order to allow for a higher degree of air circulation through the steel pieces of the sculpture to maximize the health and longevity of the corten steel.[6] The changes to the sculpture were completed September 20 and the work was placed in the Charles B. Hayes Sculpture Park upon the park‚Äôs completion.[7] In July of 2014, Wing Generator suffered severe damage from a falling tree during a thunderstorm. The proper right side of the sculpture was crushed; the metal pieces were folded over one another, the center was turned counterclockwise upon the base, and several of the welds were broken.[8] Hunt visited the University of Notre Dame to access the damage of the piece and to provide a list of materials that would be needed for its repair.[9] Wing Generator was sent to McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory in Oberlin, Ohio for repairs that were completed the following September of 2015.[10] Since the return of the repaired sculpture to campus, the Snite Museum of Art has kept the work in the museum‚Äôs courtyard, as opposed to the sculpture park, in order to protect Wing Generator from further damage from the current landscaping and construction taking place in the park. =Acquisition= On September 17, 2010, the University of Notre Dame purchased Wing Generator from the artist himself for $70,000.[11] This purchase price was suggested by Richard Raymond Alasko from the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) in August of 2010 and was accepted by both the Hunt and the Snite Museum.[12] A smaller maquette of the sculpture by Hunt, Maquette for Wing Generator, was purchased immediately before the larger sculpture.[13] The work was part of a collection of sculpture acquired by the museum to fill the Charles B. Hayes Sculpture Park, completed in 2012 and situated on the edge of campus near the Compton Family Ice Arena and Eddy Street Commons.[14] Within the collection of the Snite Museum of Art, Wing Generator received the accession number 2010.030. Wing Generator is credited as a gift from Judith H. Kinney of St. Joseph, Michigan.[15] The current monetary value of Wing Generator is unknown the Snite Museum of Art has not conducting a reappraisal of the sculpture as of 2016.[16] Artist Richard Hunt is a celebrated African-American sculptor born in 1935 in Chicago, IL. He attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago were he received his B.A.E. in 1957. In 1962, Hunt was the youngest artist exhibited at the Seattle World‚Äôs Fair, and in 1971, Hunt became the first African-American sculptor to receive a retrospective exhibition of his work at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Hunt has received a series of 15 international fellowships and awards, 14 honorary degrees, and has completed professorships and artist residencies at 21 universities in the United States. His sculptures can be found in the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery and National Museum of American Art in Washington, DC, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. [17] William S. Liberman (art critic and previous director of MoMa) declared Hunt to be, ‚Äúone of America‚Äôs foremost living sculptors.‚Äù[18] Hunt has described his work as following the sculptural movement of ‚Äúdirect metal‚Äù and ‚Äúopen form‚Äù sculpture resonating in the 1950s, these types of sculptures featuring open interiors, negative spaces within the object, and various linear planes often projecting from the center of the object. Hunt uses raw industrial materials, particularly steel, to create his sculptures. He avoids coating his works with chemical patinas so as to primacy the rough, corroded appearance of the steel. It is typical of a Hunt sculpture to show welding lines and discolorations from the forgery in order to draw the viewer‚Äôs attention to his artistic process and craft. In addition to being placed in the context of Abstract Expressionism due to his use of unworked materials, Hunt as also been understood by art historians in the context of Surrealism as several of his sculptures feature an outlandish combination of industrial and biomorphic forms such as gears, wheels, and machinery pieces juxtaposed to metal forms resembling antennae, wings, and insect legs.[19] Condition The current condition of Wing Generator has no further structural damages as of 2016. In July of 2014, Wing Generator received severe damage from a falling tree (see Location History). The sculpture was sent to McKay Lodge Conservation Laboratory in Ohio where the sculpture was separated into various portions. The portions were reshaped using an oxyacetylene torch and a forge. The portions were then reassembled using Corton welding wire. The welds were chased back to match the contours of the original sculpture, and the entire sculpture was then artificially corroded in order to obtain its original orange-colored, heavily rusted surface. The price of these conservation treatments and repairs amounted to $27,432. [20] References *1. Loving, Charles R. (2009). ‚ÄúRichard Hunt: Voyage Through Modernism.‚Äù Sculpture 28 no. 3 ap 2009 *2.

Boris Cipusev (born Melbourne 1988) is an Australian artist known for his highly detailed and colourful drawings in felt-tip pen and watercolour pencil. His work often incorporates text sourced from signage and advertising billboards, which he encounters in the commute between his residence in the suburb of Preston and his Northcote-based studio at Arts Project Australia, where he has worked since 2007. A series of his text-based works were acquired for the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria in 2014, and appeared in their blockbuster exhibition of contemporary art, Melbourne Now, in the same year.  Career, themes and style  Since 2007, Cipusev has been a regular studio artist at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although he received no formal training prior to commencing his studio residency there, his participation in the program at APA has provided him with access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. Shortly following the commencement of his work at APA he began exhibiting regularly in Australia and participated in his first international group exhibitions in 2014, in the Scotland and Canada (see EXHIBITIONS). In 2013, David Hurlston, Curator of Australian art at the National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), selected a series of fifty drawings, entitled Who Next? (2010), for the landmark exhibition Melbourne Now. These works were also acquired for the collection of the NGV. Since that time Cipusev has continued to exhibit his work at the APA gallery and at La Trobe University. Cipusev‚Äôs drawings have been noted for their visual representations of text. The works usually consist of a carefully placed word drawn in highly coloured felt-tip pen against a white background. His manner of combining multiple word or word-number combinations which are open for deciphering and interpretation by viewers, has seen his work described as ‚Äúenigmatic‚Äù and ‚Äúpoetic.‚Äù His works are typically inspired by his immediate environment; advertising in the landscape, objects in his domestic home and workplace, television, the names of people he knows or figures from popular culture.

He devoted much of his time to the LSC, and within a few years was elected to its committee and appointed as its chairman. In 1878, he was appointed as assistant secretary of the union, then in 1881 he succeeded as its general secretary.Trades Union Congress, \\"Obituary: Mr C. J.

Mieses was born at Brody on October 31, 1824. Till the age of 15, he studied Hebrew literature exclusively. At an early age he showed signs of great intellectual power, and was hailed as a genius. In the house of his father-in-law, I. Mieses, a scholar living in Dresden, he met, besides Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport and other Maskilim, his future teacher, M. Sehongut, who initiated him into the study of philosophy, and with whom he used to converse in Hebrew during their regular daily walks. At the same time, he assiduously applied himself to the study of German, French, Italian, Latin, mathematics, and astronomy. In 1846, his German essay \\"Gegenwart und Vergangeuheit im Judenthume\\" appeared in Julius F√ºrst's Der Orient; and from that time, he became assistant editor of and a regular contributor to that paper. In 1878, he published (at Lyck) a didactic poem entitled \\"HaEmunah weha-Tebunah,\\" treating of Darwinism and its opponents. By this production, he gained for himself a prominent and lasting place among Hebrew poets. Mieses was a prolific writer. Besides frequently contributing to various Hebrew and German periodicals, he wrote the following independent works: \\"Ha-Kabbalah weha- Hasidut\\" (Breslau, 1866; Odessa, 1871); \\"Korot ha-Filusufiyah ha-Hadashah\\" (Leipsic, 1887), a history of modern philosophy from Kant to Mieses' own time; \\"Shirim\\" (Cracow, 1891), a collection of miscellaneous poems; \\"Die Bibel der Vernunft\\" (Leipsic, 1895).

The term Galway shawl usually refers to a specific type of heavy weight shawl that was worn by Irish women during the colder seasons. It became popular during the late nineteenth centuryCoughlan, Dan. Curator of Textiles, Paisley Museum, Scotland. 2016 and was still being worn up until the 1950s by a few older, more traditional Irish women. Throughout Ireland, not just in Galway, women traditionally wore various types of lightweight shawls that were hand knit, crocheted, or woven; and would have been of solid color, plaid, print, or paisley. Lightweight shawls, worn directly over the blouse and tied or tucked in at the waist, were worn in all seasons both indoors and out.Owens, Mary. Stitches in Time: Exhibition of Traditional Clothing on Inis O√≠rr. Inis O√≠rr, Galway: √Åras √âana. 2011 The Galway shawl was a winter-weight outer garment worn over the lightweight shawl. History The Galway shawl was woven on a hand jacquard loom in Paisley, Scotland, but used neither the design nor construction of the shawl commonly known as the Paisley shawl. The Galway shawl was woven on a cotton warp with a weft of botany wool. These reversible shawls were a solid color in the center with a decorative, multicolor, wide border; and they were fringed. The Galway shawl contained neither velvet nor fur, but it was referred to by weavers as a velvet or fur shawl because it was heavily milled in the finishing and a soft, velvet-like nap was raised on the surface. In 1892 one company in Paisley employed 40 weavers producing this type of shawl. The last firm weaving fur or velvet shawls closed in 1943, and one of their looms was donated to the Paisley Museum where it is still on display though it is no longer in working condition. (Edward Harrison states that the last two firms closed in 1941.Harrison, Edward. The Paisley Shawl. Scottish Tartans Authority, June 1949.) According to Coughlin, the shawls were fringed at the factory in Paisley, and could be returned to the factory for repair if the fringe became damaged. Owens, however, reports that the shawls were shipped unfringed from Paisley to the Galway Woollen Mills where the fringe was added. Because several factories produced the shawls, both cases could be true. During the time of their popularity, the eye-catching shawls were costly items, worn with pride, and considered \\"Sunday best\\" in Ireland. They were usually inherited or acquired for the bride-to-be upon marriage. As years passed, the Galway shawl became unfashionable, and older women who continued to wear them became known as shawlies. The shawlies and their Galway shawls became associated in the popular imagination with poverty and backwardness. However, the costuming of Maureen O‚ÄôHara in a Galway shawl for the film \\"The Quiet Man\\" prompted a renewed appreciation for the beauty of the Galway shawl.

He was also referred to as the \\"Weather god of Heaven\\" or the \\"Lord of the Land of Hatti\\".  Name  Tar·∏´unna is a cognate of the Hittite verb tar·∏´u-zi, \\"to prevail, conquer, be powerful, be able, defeat\\"; from the Proto-Anatolian weather god *T·πõ·∏´u-ent-, \\"conquering\\"; ultimately from PIE *terh‚ÇÇ-, \\"to cross over, pass through, overcome\\". The same name was used in almost all Anatolian languages: Luwian Tar·∏´unz-; Carian TrquŒ¥-; Milyan Trqq√±t-, and Lycian: Trqqas (A), Trqqiz (B). Norbert Oettinger has argued that the functions of the Anatolian weather god ultimately come from the Proto-Indo-European god Perkwunos, but that they did not preserve the old name to coin instead the new epithet T·πõ·∏´u-ent- (\\"conquering\\"), which sounded close to the name of the Hattian Storm-god Taru.  Role  As weather god, Tar·∏´unna was responsible for the various manifestations of the weather, especially thunder, lightning, rain, clouds, and storms. He ruled over the heavens and the mountains. Thus it was Tar·∏´unna who decided whether there would be fertile fields and good harvests, or drought and famine and he was treated by the Hittites as the ruler of the gods. Tar·∏´unna legitimised the position of the Hittite king, who ruled the land of Hatti in the name of the gods. He watched over the kingdom and the other institutions of the state, but also borders and roads.  Genealogy  Tar·∏´unna is the partner of the Sun goddess of Arinna. Their children are the gods Telipinu and , the goddesses Mezulla and Inara, the Weather god of Zippalanda and the Weather god of Nerik. As a result of his identification with the Hurrian god Te≈°≈°up, Tar·∏´unna is also the partner of ·∏™epat (who is syncretised with the Sun goddess of Arinna) and the father of the god ≈†arruma and the goddesses and Kunzi≈°alli. His siblings are ≈†uwaliyat (identified with the Hurrian ) and Aranza·∏´, the goddess of the Tigris river.·∏™attu≈°ili and Pudu·∏´epa make offerings to Tar·∏´unna and ·∏™epat, on the Fƒ±raktƒ±n relief.  Depictions  Tar·∏´unna at left, on top of Namni and Huzzi, with Hebat at right, Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya Tar·∏´unna was the chief god of the Hittites and is depicted at the front of a long line of male gods in rock reliefs at the sanctuary of Yazƒ±lƒ±kaya. There he is depicted as a bearded man with a pointed cap and a sceptre, standing on the backs of the mountain gods and holding a three- pronged thunderbolt in his hand. Later depictions show him with a battle axe in the form of an adze. Equivalents The god had cognates in most other ancient Anatolian languages. In Hattian, he was called Taru; in Luwian, Tar·∏´unz (Cuneiform: Tar·∏´u(wa)nt(a)-, Hieroglyphic: DEUS TONITRUS); in Palaic, Zaparwa; in Lycian, Trqqas/Trqqiz; and in Carian, TrquŒ¥e (dat.). In the wider Mesopotamian sphere, he was associated with Hadad and Te≈°≈°up. The Luwian god Tar·∏´unz worshipped by the Iron Age Neo-Hittite states was closely related to Tar·∏´unna, Personal names referring to Tar·∏´unz, like \\"Trokondas\\", are attested into Roman times. Tarhunna has also been identified with the later Armenian and Roman god, Jupiter Dolichenus.  References  Piotr Taracha: Religions of Second Millennium Anatolia.

History The house was built in 1769 for the French diplomat (legationsr√•d) Honor√© Antoine Mossois de Verrayon . It is believed that the architect was Nicolas-Henri Jardin. The writer Tyge Rothe, who introduced a Danish audience to many of the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, lived in the building from 1776 to 1783. He had recently returned to Copenhagen after serving a few years as prefect (Amtmand) in Segeberg in Schleswig-Holstein. He had previously had a career in the central administration but fell out of favour at the court with Struense's fall in 1772. He also owned the estate Tybjergg√•rd at N√¶stved. The building was listed by the Danish Heritage Agency in the Danish national registry of protected buildings in 1943. It went through a major refurbishment in the early 1990s. Architecture The building is four bays wide and consists of three storeys, Mansard roof and cellar. The windows are placed in slightly recessed sections. Decorative elements include emi-circular (en plein cintre) blind arches are found above the windows of the bel √©tage. Corbels support the main cornice. Some details are remniscient of the Yellow Mansion in Amaliegade. A three- storey, half-timbered rear sing dates from before 1732 and probably around 1700.

All three gods are connected to horses. She was originally worshipped in southeastern Anatolia at Kani≈° and Kizzuwatna. She may originally be a Luwian goddess.  Role  Maliya is often attested with rivers and mountains as a recipient of offerings and was probably identical with the goddess of the Maliya river, whose cult statue was made of iron. In a vineyard ritual, the weather god Tar·∏´unna is invoked for the sake of the king's vineyard. Various pairs of gods are offered bread and animal sacrifices, including Tilipinu, who is paired with \\"Maliya of the Garden, mother of wine and corn.\\" In the city of , offerings were made to \\"Maliya of the Horn.\\" In healing rituals, Maliya is named along with the divine sorceress, Kamru≈°epa. In one such ritual, she learns from Ishtar of a plague and reports it to Pirwa, who passes it on in turn to Kamru≈°epa, who yokes her horses to her chariot and rides to the \\"great river.\\" Maliya was among the main deities of the nine-day , which was originally celebrated in Kizzuwatna to safeguard the royal family. Most of the gods involved in this festival belonged to the Hurrian pantheon. In the court of the temple of Maliya, the Hittite king bowed down before the divine horse Erama and offered it barley from an offering vessel. Together with Pirwa and other deities, Maliya appears in the circle of the 'singer of Kani≈°'. = Maliyanni = The Maliyanni (\\"Small Maliyas\\") are a pair of gods which were worshipped in vineyards. According to the ritual of the sorceress Anna of Kaplawiya for remedying infertile vineyards, a pit should be dug in front of the Maliyanni and cakes thrown into it as offering. Significantly, this ritual includes a speech in an unknown language.  Onomastics  Maliya appears as a component in Hittite place names and personal names. The oldest example comes from 18th century BC Assyrian documents from K√ºltepe, in which the female name Maliawa≈°·∏´i appears frequently.Ilya S. Yakubovich: Sociolinguistics of the Luvian Language; Chicago (2008). pp.269f. With respect to place names, the city of Malliya≈°≈°i is significant, since it is formed in the same way as the cities of Tar·∏´unta≈°≈°a and Tiwata≈°≈°a (named after the Luwian weather god Tar·∏´unz and Sun god Tiwaz).  Later history  Maliya probably continued to be worshipped under various names during Classical Antiquity. In Lycia the goddess Malija was worshipped; she was identified with the Greek goddess Athena. Her epithet hriuwama, meaning \\"the Empowerer\\" suggests that she was a goddess of vegetation. The lexicographer Hesychius also equates Malis (ŒúŒ±ŒªŒØœÇ) with Athena, Theocritus mentions a nymph of the same name, and on the island of Lesbos, Malis (Œú·æ∂ŒªŒπœÇ) was a spinning goddess like Athena. According to Hellanicus, Malis (ŒúŒ±ŒªŒØœÇ) was a slave of the Lydian queen Omphale who had a child, Akeles, with Heracles. Finally, Sophocles refers to the Maliadian nymphes (ŒúŒ±ŒªŒπŒ¨Œ¥ŒµœÇ).

Since 2007 it has been part of the Baillieston administrative ward within the Glasgow City Council area. Location and history Wellhouse consists primarily of council tenements dating from the time the 'scheme' was laid out in the late 1950s and which were refurbished in the early 21st century, as well as some modern houses built to replace other tenements which were knocked down. There are two primary schools (Aultmore Park Primary and Newhills SEN School), a row of shops, a youth facility with children‚Äôs play area and a modern community centre in the centre of the neighbourhood. There are also areas of waste ground where buildings (including a church and a previous school) were demolished but the land remains unused. Wellhouse was constructed in the 1950s as part of 'Greater Easterhouse' although it is physically separated from the main scheme and its amenities by the M8 Motorway (and served by Junction 10 which is also the exit for Glasgow Fort shopping centre). It is bordered to the west and north by Queenslie (an industrial suburb), to the south (across Edinburgh Road) by the Barlanark residential district, and to the east by the smaller area of Easthall. modern housing on Langbar Crescent (2017) Wellhouse, Barlanark and Easthall share many characteristics and there has been a history of gang-related tension and violence between the youths living in the schemes, although in the 2010s a lot of progress was made by way of initiatives to provide alternatives to gang activity and build links between local communities. The area was home to one of the more successful amateur football teams in Glasgow, Wellhouse AFC, who won the Scottish Amateur Cup in 2013 but folded soon after in 2015 after 40 years in competition. The frequent (six per hour) '41' and '60' bus services operated by First Glasgow pass along Wellhouse Road (on different routes between Glasgow City Centre and Easterhouse), while the '38E' service passes along Edinburgh Road towards Baillieston. The nearest railway station is on the North Clyde Line between West Dunbartonshire and Edinburgh. In 2016, Glasgow City Council outlined masterplans for the development of the Greater Easterhouse area (including Wellhouse) over the next 20 years.

Looney Tunes animated cartoon directed by Bob Clampett. The short was released on May 13, 1939, and stars Porky Pig in the role of Christopher Columbus. Plot Since this cartoon is set in 1492, Porky Pig is the star of the short as Kristopher Kolumbus Jr. himself with a song at the title card. The short begins with the 1492 text zooming and forming smoke with the announcer saying that the astronomers thought \\"the world was flat as a pancake\\" with a sign on top, located not too far from Saturn. Porky Pig (as Christopher Columbus) proposes to Queen Isabella of Spain to travel the world and prove that it is not flat. When the queen doubts whether the world is round, Porky gives the queen a demonstration by holding on to a baseball. Porky then starts to do a trick with his arm and aims it to the right. He winds up 4 times until he immediately throws the baseball into the horizon as Porky looks at the right, then waits for it to return from the other side, so he turns to the left. The ball continued its journey until he catches it in his hand. It turns out that it has stamps covered over, which proves it has been through parts of the United States (like Ohio, Los Angeles, and New York) and China. The Queen is convinced and gives Porky enough money to make his voyage. Porky addresses his crew that they are going to travel the Atlantic Ocean, but they are seemingly scared with their legs moving from left-to-right. When Porky asks them: \\"Why fellas, you ain't scared to go, are you? What are you men or mice?\\", they then looked in different directions until they shrink smaller and smaller, as they transform into mice, giving the answer in a chipmunk voice that they are mice, and run off down the ship (with another one sliding down). Porky then however was shown holding the flag rope with appeals a pair of underpants. Then it shows a view of a banner reading \\"Bon Voyage Kris\\" with the audience in the background. Many signs appear as Porky speeds with his boat with many signs, such as Highway 441 and a no parking after 5 miles sign. The boat then acts like a car, turning left. Meanwhile, at nighttime, Porky now decides to make the voyage on his own, navigating with the help of arrows pointing to America in the sky, with one being when he looks through the telescope (which is the next scene) showing in his telescope an arrow pointing left to America with stars. He stutters about messing up his history. The scene then shifts to the next day and the next night in a flash. The announcer then says \\"Hey! that is only 39\\"! The scene then shifts back from day to night, and fixed it. Porky then looks at a map, with the announcer telling about sea serpents. Porky said there is no such things as sea serpents. Porky then turns to the right, with the serpent looking at Porky, smiling. He then finds the serpent in a friendly manner until he notice that it is a serpent. So he runs in fear, up to the highest pole of the ship. Then the serpent shows off his muscles in front of the camera, until an even bigger serpent jumps out of nowhere with Porky's boat on his head, telling the other serpent \\"oh, yeah?!\\" (The same quote \\"oh, yeah?!\\" was later used in a couple more shorts), the other serpent then looks from the bottom to his head of the bigger serpent, staring for a moment, and forcing the other serpent to run in fear. They all run off, and Porky's boat was then fallen back to sea. After an encounter with some sea serpents, Porky continues to look at his telescope. After the telescope acts a bit funny, he finally discovers America with grass acting like the sea. A parody version of a Statue of Liberty was shown after Porky jumps all excited. A sign was then shown to the left, saying \\"Attention paleface! Try our Dandruff Cure, one scalp treatment lasts a lifetime. From the Tom E. Hawke Method\\". After a moment of staring, a steamboat was then shown with a sign reading \\"Excursion to see the white men, 30 degrees\\", where the camera greets the Native Americans. After a moment of showing the Native Americans, the chief later came surfboarding on a wooding plank. He turns in many curves and finally reaching in Porky's ship. Porky with the greedy chief who is angry, then cheerfully starts to introduce to the greedy chief. The chief later gives Porky the signal until he crazily gets close to his face with a quote which is later used in Fresh Fish in November: \\"How do you do?\\" Porky however then appears in a car during a parade with a view of the city covered with graffiti (the same gag however was also used on MGM 6 years earlier from at the end of Willie Whopper's first short from July/August 1933 \\"The Air Race\\"). Shortly afterwards, Porky then raveled back with him to Spain, where a same clip before Porky's destination from the beginning then plays afterwards, showing a view of the banner with the sound of the audience. Porky then starts to show the queen the Native Americans they brought with after Porky's visit. Shortly afterwards, they perform a jitterbug dance with all of the Native Americans and Porky dancing in front of the queen who is still sitting on her throne. At one point afterwards, her Majesty orders the dance to stop for a total of 18 seconds, only for her to join in. Once the queen said go, the queen was joined in the dance. At that note, the cartoon irises out as the cartoon ends. Notes The joke where Porky proves the world is round by throwing a baseball into the horizon, then waiting for it to return from the other side and show to the queen that it has stamps covered over it to show it has been through parts of the United States and China was later re-used in another Warner Brothers cartoon, namely Bob McKimson's Hare We Go (1951), which stars Bugs Bunny meeting Columbus.http://www.sandiegoreader.com/weblogs/big- screen/2012/oct/08/free-movies-columbo-day-edition/ When the Indian chief greets Porky he says \\"How DO you do?\\", which is a reference to the catchphrase of radio comedian Bert Jordan's comedy character \\"The Mad Russian\\". This joke was often made in a lot of Looney Tunes cartoons. The scene where the Indians dance has re-used animation from an earlier Clampett cartoon, Sweet Sioux.

Absalon.Cell.No.5 Biography Meir Eshel, the eldest of four children of Ad√®le and Elie Eshel, was born in December 1964 in the city of Ashdod. At the age fourteen he began to study at the Technical School of the Air Force in Haifa. After his graduation in 1982 he served as an aircraft technician at the Hatzerim Israeli Air Force Base for three years. From 1985 to 1987, Absalon lived in Sinai and later in the dunes south of Ashdod, where he built a wooden cabin and made his living making jewelry. In an interview Absalon described the period:\\"I built my first house when I was 20: I was discharged from the army in a very bad state and went to the desert [...] for about a year I lived with the Bedouins in Sinai. I had a fantasy about life in the desert. I believed I could do it, until I realized it didn't fulfill me.\\" In 1987 he immigrated to Paris, and moved to the home of his uncle Jacques Ohayon which was located on Temple Street (Rue de Temple) in the Third Arrondissement of Paris. Eshel through Ohayon met several artists such as Christian Boltanski and Annette Messager. He began studying art at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts Paris-Cergy (ENSAPC) and attended the weekly Boltanski class at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts (ENSBA) during this period, he adopted the name \\"Absalon\\", a nickname given to him by one of his uncle's friends and referred to the biblical Absalon. In 1989 he received a one-year scholarship to study at the Institut des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques in Paris. In 1990 he was represented by the Galerie Chantal Crousel. In the same year he was introduced to the curator Yona Fischer by Christian Boltanski, who invited him to exhibit in Israel at the Artists Studios, Aika Brown Gallery, Jerusalem, it was the first time he returned to Israel since moving to Paris. In 1991 Absalon moved to live in the Villa Lipchitz (Jacques Lipchitz) in Boulogne built by Le Corbusier in 1923‚Äì24. In 1993 Absalon planned to live in the six cells he designed for six cities, on October 10, 1993 Absalon died from an illness associated with HIV, at the age of 28. Cells In the course of six years Absalon created a series of one person living units based on everyday routine actions and designed entirely in relation to his measures. The inside of the cell is all covered in white in order to reduce distractions or elements that can disturb the eye. In his video Solutions (1992) Absalon demonstrate the study of measurements and calculation of movements like eating, sleeping, taking shower which later will define the form of his cells. In 1993 Absalon started to construct six cells which were supposed to be installed in six metropolitan centers as Absalon described in interview: \\"I would like to create my own setting and belong to nothing else. My living unit will be the six habitation units which I construct, and my homeland will be in-between them.\\" Education * 1987‚Äì The √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts Paris-Cergy, Paris, France * 1987‚Äì The √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des Beaux-arts, Paris, France * 1988‚Äì The Institute des Hautes √âtudes en Arts Plastiques (IHEAP), Paris, FranceAbsalon.Disposition.1990 Videos * 1991‚Äì Proposals for Habitation (3:30min) * 1992‚Äì Solutions (7:25 min) * 1993‚Äì Noises (3:23 min) * 1993‚Äì Battle (62:24 min) * 1993‚Äì Mr. Leloup Life (31min) * 1993‚Äì Assassinations (33 min) Absalon.Cell No.2 (inside view) Solo exhibitions * 1989‚Äì Centre d'Art Contemporain d'Ivry (CREDAC), Ivry-sur-Seine, France (catalogue) * 1990‚Äì\\"Proposals for Habitation (Scale 1:1),\\" Artists Studio, Aika Brown Gallery, Jerusalem (catalogue) * 1990-Mus√©e Sainte-Croix, Poitiers, France (catalogue) * 1990‚Äì\\"Cells,\\" Galerie Crousel-Robelin / Bama, Paris * 1991‚Äì \\"Compartments,\\" Kunstlerhaus, Stuttgart * 1991‚Äì \\"Compartments\\" Kulturbehrde, Hamburg * 1991‚Äì \\"Compartments,\\" Galerie Crousel-Robelin / Bama, Paris * 1992‚Äì Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv (catalogue) * 1992‚Äì Galerie Etienne Ficheroulle, Brussels * 1992‚Äì \\"A Universe without Objects,\\" FNAC, H√¥tel des Arts, Paris * 1992‚Äì Kaye Pesblum Gallery, Helsinki * 1993‚Äì \\"Cells,\\" Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (catalogue) * 1993‚Äì \\"Battle,\\" Galerie Crousel-Robelin / Bama and Jean-Ren√© Fleurieu, Paris * 1993‚Äì Carmelitenkloster, Frankfurt * 1993‚Äì Galerie Luis Campana, Cologne * 1994‚Äì Galerie Crousel-Robelin / Bama, Paris * 1994‚Äì \\"Cells,\\" Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow * 1994‚Äì De Appel, Amsterdam (catalogue) * 1994‚Äì Carr√© d'Art, Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain, N√Æmes, France (catalogue) * 1994‚Äì \\"Noises,\\" Chisenhale Gallery, London * 1994‚Äì \\"Disposition,\\" Ch√¢teau d'Aulteribe, Sermentizon, France * 1994‚Äì Attitudes Gallery, Geneva * 1995‚Äì \\"Cells,\\" Chisenhale Gallery, London * 1995‚Äì \\"Cells,\\" Kunstverein, Hamburg * 1996‚Äì \\"Cells,\\" Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin * 1996‚Äì \\"Absalon: Complete Video Works,\\" Oriel Gallery, Cardiff * 1997‚Äì Galerie Chantal Crousel, Paris * 1997‚Äì L‚ÄôInstitut d ‚ÄòArt et Techniques de Bretagne Occidentale (IATBO), Brest, France 1997‚Äì Kunsthalle Zurich * 1999‚Äì \\"Cells, Models & Drawings,\\" Goldie Paley Gallery at Moore College, Philadelphia (catalogue) * 2005‚Äì Platform Garanti, Istanbul * 2005‚Äì \\"The Intruders,\\" off-site program, Pavillon de l‚ÄôArsenal, Mus√©e de la Ville de Paris * 2005‚Äì Les Visiteurs programme, Chartreuse de Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon, France * 2006‚Äì \\"Battle,\\" Ballet Preljocaj, opening of the Pavillon Noir, Centre Chor√©ographique National, Aix en-Provence * 2007‚Äì \\"Marie-Ange Guilleminot pr√©sente Absalon,\\" La Chappelle de Visitandines, Amiens * 2008‚Äì Passerelle Centre d‚ÄôArt, Brest, France * 2010‚Äì KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin (catalogue) * 2012‚Äì Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (catalogue) * 2013‚Äì Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Tel Aviv (catalogue) Selected Group Exhibitions * 1988‚Äì Atelier du Parvis de Beaubourg, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris * 1989 ‚Äì \\"Pas √† c√¥t√© pas n'importe o√π (Not a side, not anywhere),\\" Villa Arson, Nice * 1989 ‚Äì \\"Carte blanche √† Jean de Loisy (Free card for Jean de Loisy),\\" Centre d'Art Contemporain d'Ivry (CREDAC), Ivry-sur- Seine * 1990 ‚Äì \\"Resistance: Absalon, Art in Ruins, V√©ronique Joumard, Serge Kliaving,\\" Mus√©e Sainte-Croix, Poitiers (catalogue) * 1990 \\"Lignes de mire 1 (Lines of Sight),\\" Fondation Cartier, Jouy-en-Josas, France * 1990‚Äì \\"Le Cinq (the Five),\\" Tramway, Glasgow;

It is housed in the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica of Palazzo Barberini, Rome. The painting dealt with a controversial topic of Beatrice Cenci, a woman who was executed by Papal authorities, specifically Pope Clement VIII Aldobrandini. Description The author of this work has been previously highly debated, with many previous critics assigning the work to Elisabetta Sirani, and categorizing as a statement by a 17th-century feminist. She is depicted in the white robes of a Roman Sybil or perhaps a vestal virgin, evoking sympathy. She looks back melancholic at an angle backward. Tradition holds that he painted the work for the Cardinal Ascanio Colonna. The work has inspired many romantic artists including Stendhal, Percy Shelley, Dumas, Artaud, and Guerrazzi.Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica, Rome, entry on work. The debate over the authorship and its influence are as interesting as the work itself. Traditions with no factual documentation claim Reni entered her cell the day prior to the execution, or saw her on the way to the scaffold. Others claim he was not even in Rome at that date.Frank Leslie's Sunday Magazine, Volume 4, page 635. The earliest Barberini catalogue states it likely depicts the Cenci girl by an unknown painter, only a later one attributes the work to Reni.

He has exhibited widely, both nationally and internationally [see Exhibitions] and his work is held in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia, MADMus√©e, Li√®ge, and the National Sports Museum.  Early life and education  Ciccone grew up in the semi-rural suburb of Yarrambat, the third of four children. According to his mother, he began ‚Äúdrawing obsessively‚Äù from the age of four or five, and even at this young age his key source of imagery was taken from the mass media (television and newspapers). It was during his childhood that he began creating his collection of rendered logos from favourite television shows, a collection he has continued to expand throughout his life, alongside others, including a collection of music cassettes which extends to over 1000 objects. Ciccone has demonstrated an extraordinary memory for these collections (which remain unlabelled and yet are perfectly organised and accessible for him) and an ability to recall the names of individual persons met briefly, over periods stretching many years. This ability has been noted as a key component of his artwork, informing the connections he draws between figures of public life and popular culture, and the attention to detail in his technical execution. In 1984 Ciccone was one of the first artists to take up a studio residency at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although he has received little formal training, his participation in the studio program at APA provided him with access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. He also spent a number of years attending weekly drawing classes at the School of Art at RMIT University. Ciccone‚Äôs early works were in watercolour and in the early 1990s he produced a series of monochrome drawings featuring imagery and text taken directly from newspapers. Following a serious illness in 1993 and a lengthy period of rehabilitation, his work underwent a significant change as he introduced colour to his palette. During this time he produced artworks centred on the actions and heroics of Australian Rules Football players, one of which has been acquired for the permanent collection of the National Sports Museum.  Career, themes and style  Glenn Barkley, Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia, has described Ciccone‚Äôs ‚Äúobsessive engagement‚Äù with television and mass media presentations of sporting events as being a quintessential trait of his generation, stating that for ‚ÄúGeneration X,‚Äù there is ‚Äúlittle difference between what we might watch and how we might feel.‚Äù He notes the manner in which Ciccone democratises his subjects, describing an oeuvre of works in which ‚Äúcathedrals are as important as the corner of a studio and lions lie with mice, and elephants, and koala bears.‚Äù However, Barkley is careful to point out that Ciccone‚Äôs works are not flippant; he attributes his use of low-brow televisual imagery to a project which elevates and finds meaning in banal aspects of contemporary life, claiming that he ‚Äúcelebrates the mundane, the disposable and finds it beautiful.‚Äù Stylistically, Ciccone‚Äôs rendering of mass media personages and events in soft, layered pastel, work towards this elevation of his subject, transforming the ‚Äúflatness of newsprint or flickering image on the screen‚Äù into something ‚Äúwarm and personal.‚Äù Although best known for his works in pastel on paper, Ciccone has worked in a range of mediums including painting, printmaking, ceramics and digital animation. His work has been categorised within the genre of Outsider Art and has been included in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA. However, in recent years his work has also achieved success in more conventional art institutions and has been acquired for major permanent collections at the National Gallery of Australia (Print Archive) and MADMus√©e, Li√®ge, Belgium.

He was fatally shot on March 31, 1870 in Eutaw, the county seat. The Klan members apparently intended to hang him in the square in a public lynching, to demonstrate their power during this period and their threat to Republicans. Boyd fiercely resisted their taking him from his hotel room. In the armed confrontation, he was shot and killed there. As was typical of most Klan attacks, his murderers were never brought to justice. That same night, prominent black Republican James Martin was shot and killed at his home in Union, Alabama, also in Greene County. Early life Boyd was born in South Carolina, and later lived in Alabama. He was among thousands of Klan victims who were killed or wounded in Alabama and other Southern states during the Reconstruction era. The Klan's primary targets were freedmen and free blacks from the North, but they also attacked and intimidated white Republican officeholders, teachers, and other freedman sympathizers. Similarly, the Greene County Courthouse was burned in 1868, and some suspect it was arson to destroy such records of suits by freedmen against planters. Death On the night of Boyd's murder, thirty masked, armed, and costumed Klansmen were observed riding into the town square of Eutaw, the county seat of Greene County. A number of the men entered George Cleveland's hotel and demanded to be shown to Boyd's room. Boyd put up unexpected resistance and a gunfight broke out. He was wounded and left the room, and was fatally shot in the hallway. It is believed that he was attacked to prevent prosecution of suits by freedmen against planters. That same night, James Martin, a black Republican prominent in the county, was shot by gunmen near his home in Union, Alabama, who took him away rather than let him be treated; he was never seen again. Aftermath In the fall of 1870 before elections, two black politicians were killed in Greene County. An estimated four blacks were killed by whites in the Eutaw riot, which took place in the town square. President Ulysses S. Grant gained congressional passage of the 1870 Enforcement Acts, intended to authorize the federal government to suppress Klan violence. While the Klan was suppressed, rifle leagues and such insurgent groups as the White League in Louisiana and Red Shirts in Mississippi and the Carolinas developed as other paramilitary insurgent groups.

The highway begins at an intersection with US Highway 65 (US 65) and US 425 and runs to US 63/US 79\\\\. The designation also includes a spur route, Highway 81 Spur, created in 2005. Both highways are maintained by the Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department (AHTD). The Highway 81 designation has also been used for a former highway in Arkansas. A route between Arkansas City and Rohwer held the Highway 81 designation between 1926 and 1929. The designation was reused in 1945 to replace Highway 13 between Louisiana and US 65 east of Pine Bluff (present-day US 425). Route description The route begins at an intersection with US 65 and the northern terminus of US 425 just east of Pine Bluff. Highway 81 runs due north as a section line road to an intersection with Highway 81S, when it turns due west. After running briefly west, Highway 81 intersects US 63/US 79 and terminates. History Highway 81 was first designated during the 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering in Desha County, but this route was supplanted by Highway 4 in 1929. The designation was revived in 1945, when it supplanted Highway 13 between Louisiana and US 65 in Pine Bluff. The highway was extended north (along its current routing) to an International Paper plant on February 20, 1957.. Other than a realignment for a bypass in Monticello in 1960,. the route remained unchanged until November 16, 1988, when the AHTD and the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LADOTD) proposed supplanting Highway 81 and Louisiana Highway 139 with a new route, US 425.. This route was approved by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), renumbering the entire route except the short portion north of US 65 to the paper plant. Following construction of Lock and Dam No. 4 on the Arkansas River, the Arkansas State Highway Commission desired a connection to the new location Highway 13 (now US 63/US 79, the current northern terminus).

Between 12 and 22 weeks, abortions may be performed on medical grounds under conditions established by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Social Affairs. After 22 weeks, abortions additionally require approval of a three-member medical committee. The law governing abortion was instituted in 2000. The abortion rate in Georgia dropped sharply during the 1990s, from 41.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 in 1992 to 21.9 in 1996 and 19.1 in 2005. This decline has been attributed to increased use of modern contraceptives. , the abortion rate was 26.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, among the highest rates in the world. By an alternate measure, however, abortion fell between 2005 and 2010: a 2005 study found that women in Georgia had on average 3.1 abortions in their lifetimes, then the highest rate in the world; by 2010, that statistic had fallen to 1.6 abortions. A majority of Georgians oppose legal abortion. The 2013 Caucasus Barometer poll found that 69% of Georgians believe that abortion can never be justified. Public opinion polling by the Pew Research Center, released in May 2017, found that only 10% supported legal abortion in most or all cases. A study of 2005‚Äì2009 data found a sex ratio at birth of 121 males for every 100 females, suggesting that sex- selective abortion may be occurring.

In the call, Tsai congratulated Trump for his victory in the presidential election. The two leaders spoke for around 10 minutes, focusing on politics, economy, and security in Asia-Pacific. Following the call, Trump publicized this on Twitter and Facebook and said thank you to \\"the President of Taiwan\\". After Trump's transition team confirmed the event, the Presidential Office of Taiwan released a statement about the content of the call. Several prominent Republicans praised the call between the two leaders, saying that the United States needs no more pressure from the government of the People's Republic of China (commonly called \\"China\\"), which does not recognize the ROC government and claims Taiwan is part of its territory. Some commentators from U.S. media outlets said that the call humiliated Beijing as it seemed a violation of a diplomatic practice.

But the 1979 Act of Congress Taiwan Relations Act and the 1982 Six Assurances between the governments between U.S. and Taiwan have defined the substantial relations between the peoples of the United States and Taiwan. After Tsai Ing-wen's victory in Taiwan's presidential election in 2016, analysts predicted that Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party would install a largely pro-American government, in contrast to that of former President Ma Ying-jeou's Kuomintang, which called for close co-operation with Beijing.

He made his MLB debut in 2018, and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award. The next season, Acu√±a was named an MLB All-Star, was the NL stolen base leader, and won a Silver Slugger Award. Career =Minor leagues= Acu√±a signed with the Atlanta Braves for $100,000 as an international free agent in July 2014. He made his professional debut in 2015 with the Gulf Coast Braves and was later promoted to the Danville Braves that season. In 55 games between the two teams he batted .269 with four home runs, 18 RBIs, and 16 stolen bases. In 2016, he slashed .312/.392/.429 with four home runs and 19 RBIs in only 42 games combined between the Gulf Coast Braves and Rome Braves due to an injury. After the season, he played for the Melbourne Aces of the Australian Baseball League and was named an ABL All- Star. Acu√±a made his first appearances in Grapefruit League games at the start of the 2017 season as an extra player originally assigned to minor league camp. He began the year with the Florida Fire Frogs of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League and was later promoted to the Mississippi Braves of the Class AA Southern League. Acu√±a was named to the All-Star Futures Game roster in July, and played the whole game, one of three World Team members to do so. He reported to the Gwinnett Braves of the Class AAA International League immediately after the All-Star break, making his International League debut against the Charlotte Knights, during which he hit an opposite-field home run in his second at bat. For the year, Acu√±a appeared in 139 games, hitting .325/.374/.522 with 21 homers, 82 RBIs and 44 stolen bases. After the 2017 minor league regular season ended, Acu√±a was invited to join the MLB's premier elite prospect finishing school, the Arizona Fall League and was assigned to the Peoria Javelinas. He played 23 games in the AFL hitting .325/.414/.639 alongside seven home runs, winning the league championship and claiming league MVP honors, becoming the AFL's youngest most valuable player. Baseball America ranked Acu√±a as the No. 1 Major League Baseball prospect heading into the 2018 season. MLB.com ranked him second to Japanese pitcher/hitter Shohei Ohtani. Acu√±a began the year at major league spring training. Despite a .432 average and four home runs in spring training, Acu√±a was reassigned to minor league camp on March 19, 2018. He reported to the Gwinnett Stripers to begin the 2018 season. =Atlanta Braves= 2018 On April 25, 2018, the Braves promoted Acu√±a to the major leagues. This made him the youngest player in Major League Baseball at that time, claiming the distinction from teammate Ozzie Albies. Though Acu√±a wore uniform number 24 throughout his minor league career in honor of Miguel Cabrera, he made his major league debut on April 25, 2018, wearing number 13. Against the Cincinnati Reds, Acu√±a collected his first career hit off Kevin Shackelford. He finished the game 1 for 5 and scored the game tying run in the eighth inning as the Braves won 5‚Äì4. The next day, also against the Reds, Acu√±a hit his first MLB home run off Homer Bailey. He finished the game 3 for 4 as the Braves won 7‚Äì4. On May 28, Acu√±a was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a mild ACL sprain and a bruise in his left knee as well as back contusion. On June 21, the Braves optioned Acu√±a to Triple-A Gwinnett for a rehab assignment. Acu√±a at SunTrust Park in 2018 Acu√±a regularly hit in the leadoff spot in the lineup after the All-Star break. His performance improved markedly as he implemented an adjustment to his batting stance at the suggestion of Kevin Seitzer. While playing against the Miami Marlins on August 13, 2018, Acu√±a became the fourth player in the history of Major League Baseball to hit a home run to lead off both games of a doubleheader. Additionally, he had hit a home run in his last four games, becoming the youngest player since 1920 to accomplish the feat. By hitting a home run off Trevor Richards on August 14, Acu√±a became the youngest major leaguer ever to hit home runs in five consecutive games, as well as the fifth batter in Atlanta Braves history to do so. Facing Adam Conley later that same game, Acu√±a hit his second home run of the night, marking the first time he had ever hit more than one home run in a game. In the finale of the Braves' series against the Marlins on August 15, Acu√±a faced Jos√© Ure√±a, who hit him with the first pitch of the game. Ure√±a was ejected from the game, while Acu√±a was replaced in the field at the top of the second inning. Acu√±a played the Braves' next game against the Colorado Rockies on August 16. When Acu√±a next played the Marlins on August 23, he hit another home run, and was subsequently struck by another pitch. His production during the month of August won him the Major League Baseball Rookie of the Month Award. On September 2, Acu√±a hit his seventh leadoff home run, tying a Braves team record, set by Marquis Grissom, for such home runs in a season. Three days later, Acu√±a broke the team's leadoff home run record in a game against the Boston Red Sox. With his 25th home run on September 9, Acu√±a became the seventh player in MLB history to hit that many home runs while under the age of 21. Later that month, it was announced that Acu√±a would be playing in the MLB Japan All-Star Series scheduled for November. With his fifteenth stolen base on September 22, 2018, Acu√±a became the fourth player in MLB history to record a 25‚Äì15 season, while aged 20 or below, alongside Alex Rodriguez, Orlando Cepeda, and Mike Trout. Overall with the 2018 Braves, Acu√±a appeared in 111 MLB games, batting .293 with 26 home runs and 64 RBIs. On October 7, in a National League Division Series game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Acu√±a became the youngest player in MLB history to hit a postseason grand slam, aged 20 years 293 days, off Dodgers pitcher Walker Buehler. On November 12, he was named the National League Rookie of the Year. 2019 On April 2, 2019, Acu√±a and the Braves agreed to an eight-year contract worth $100 million. The extension included team options for the 2027 and 2028 seasons. Aged 21, Acu√±a became the youngest player in baseball history to sign a contract worth at least $100 million. Acu√±a's deal was the largest for any player with less than one year of major league service. By June 2019, Acu√±a had drawn attention for his power production. At midseason, he was named a starting outfielder for the National League in the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, and invited to take part in that year's Home Run Derby. On August 9, Acu√±a hit his thirtieth home run of the 2019 season while facing Marlins pitcher Tayron Guerrero. Acu√±a joined the 30‚Äì30 club on August 24, in a game against the New York Mets. He became the second-youngest player to reach the milestone, after Mike Trout. With his fortieth home run on September 19, Acu√±a became the youngest major leaguer to enter the 40‚Äì30 club. He reported a minor injury in the penultimate series of the Braves' 2019 season, and was rested for the remainder of the regular season. For the year, Acu√±a hit .280/.365/.883, with 127 runs (leading the National League), 41 home runs, and 37 stolen bases (leading the NL). Acu√±a missed the 40‚Äì40 club by three stolen bases, but still entered the prestigious 30-30 club as the second-youngest member behind only Mike Trout. He led the major leagues in power-speed number (38.9). Acu√±a and teammates Ozzie Albies and Freddie Freeman won the 2019 National League Silver Slugger Awards for outfield, second base, and first base, respectively. 2020 During a season shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Braves won the division for the third time in a row, earning a league-record 20th division title. Near the end of the season, Acu√±a hit a 495-foot home run against the Red Sox; it was the longest MLB home run that year and the longest home run ever hit at Truist Park. In 2020 he batted .250/.406/.581, with 14 home runs and 29 RBIs in 160 at bats.  Player profile  = Batting style = A powerful right-handed batter, Acu√±a has all round batting range. According to Sean Casey: His batting style is comparable to Roberto Clemente as their natural core power and rotational torque allow them to hit without a back swing, and keeping the knob of the bat pointing down at home plate (normally pointing towards the catcher during back swing), yet still making contact and control of the barrel. = Baserunning = On the basepaths, Acu√±a starts off like an infielder with a more upright stance, or a running back standing with a slight bend of the knees and hands on the knees to generate greater acceleration. According to Harold Reynolds, who adopted the Rickey Henderson technique for both baserunning and fielding, the stance also stops him from leaning or tipping off fielders for base stealing. Personal life Acu√±a's grandfather, Romualdo Blanco, and father, Ronald Acu√±a Sr., both played minor league baseball. Acu√±a Sr. represented Venezuela at the 2011 Pan American Games. Acu√±a Jr. is the eldest of four sons. A younger brother, Luisangel, is a shortstop in the Texas Rangers organization. An uncle, Jos√© Escobar, played for the Cleveland Indians in 1991, and several cousins have also played in Major League Baseball, namely Vicente Campos, Alcides Escobar, Edwin Escobar, and Kelvim Escobar. Acu√±a received the nickname El Abusador from Miami Marlins center fielder Starling Marte.

Plans exist to bring it to Universal Studios Hollywood in California and Universal's Epic Universe in Orlando. The theme park is based on Nintendo video game franchises such as Super Mario. Development Following several years of declining gaming revenue and console market share, Nintendo sought avenues to leverage and develop its intellectual properties, and so entered a theme park partnership with Universal Parks & Resorts. The partnership, announced in May 2015 and detailed the next year, would use Mario and other Nintendo franchises as themes in dedicated areas of Universal theme parks. The ($351 million U.S.) collaboration built for Universal Studios Japan in Osaka is similar in scale to Universal's investment in the Harry Potter franchise. Locations Construction on the initial theme park land in Osaka began in June 2017 with a groundbreaking ceremony. The opening was planned for completion in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics, before the event was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. Two rides have been confirmed for this version of the land: one ride will be themed on Yoshi and the other will be based on Mario Kart. On January 24, 2020, Universal confirmed that a Super Nintendo World themed area would be included in the Epic Universe park for Universal Orlando Resort.https://www.travelpulse.com/news/entertainment/super-nintendo- world-confirmed-for-new-universal-theme-park.html =Future locations= There are plans to bring Super Nintendo World to Universal Studios Singapore, but no timeframe has been announced. The lack of space might also be of concern. There are also plans to bring Nintendo attractions to Universal Studios Hollywood, but no other information is known. Construction work has started in the northwestern part of the park. Rides will differ across each instance of the park. Layout =Universal Studios Japan= Super Nintendo World is wedged in at the northern end of the park, west of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter; south of the Shinmaya Toll Gate and the Nisshin Steel Company that are just outside of the property.

Her mathematical research concerns geometric topology, geometric group theory, and Teichm√ºller theory. She is also interested in the cultural studies, philosophy, and history of science and mathematics. Duchin is one of the core faculty members and serves as director of the Science, Technology, and Society program at Tufts. She has done significant research on the mathematics of redistricting and gerrymandering, and founded a research group to advance these mathematical studies and their nonpartisan application in the real world of US politics. Early life and education Duchin was given her first name, Moon, by parents \\"on the science-y fringes of the hippie classification\\". She grew up knowing from a young age that she wanted to become a mathematician. As a student at Stamford High School in Connecticut, she completed the regular high school mathematics curriculum in her sophomore year, and continued to learn mathematics through independent study. She was active in math and science camps and competitions, and did a summer research project in the geometry of numbers with Noam Elkies.. Duchin studied at Harvard University as an undergraduate, where she was also active in queer organizing, and finished a double major in mathematics and women's studies in 1998. As a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Chicago, she continued her feminist activism by teaching gender studies and pushing the university to add gender- neutral bathrooms,. and was mentioned mockingly by name on the Rush Limbaugh show. She completed her doctorate in 2005, under the supervision of Alex Eskin. She was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California at Davis, and the University of Michigan, before joining the Tufts faculty in 2011. Work Duchin's mathematical research has focused on geometric topology, geometric group theory, and Teichm√ºller theory. For example, one of her results is that, for a broad class of locally flat surfaces, the geometry of the surface is entirely determined by the shortest length in each homotopy class of simple closed curves.Technically, \\"shortest length\\" here means an infimum of lengths, as there is not generally a single shortest representative curve for the class. See Bowman, Joshua Paul (2011). Review of . Duchin's expertise in geometry has led her to conduct research on the mathematics of gerrymandering. A key aspect of this research is the geometric notion of the compactness of a given political district, a numerical measure that attempts to quantify how extensively gerrymandered it is. ‚ÄúWhat courts have been looking for is one definition of compactness that they can understand, that we can compute, and that they can use as a kind of go-to standard‚Äù, she said in an interview with The Chronicle of Higher Education. To help tackle the challenge of finding an agreed-upon standard, Duchin has developed a long- term, wide-ranging project on the mathematics of gerrymandering. As a part of this project, she founded a summer program to train mathematicians to become expert witnesses in related legal cases. In 2016, she founded the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG), a nonpartisan research group which coordinates and publicizes research on geometry and computing, and their application to the redistricting process in the US. In 2018-2019 she was on leave of absence from Tufts, and was a Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University. Her research focus was \\"Political Geometry: The Mathematics of Redistricting\\". In 2018, Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolf enlisted Duchin to help him evaluate newly drawn redistricting maps for fairness. This happened as a consequence of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision declaring the 2011 U.S. congressional districting map unconstitutional. Duchin generated a report published on February 15, 2018.

Gamarra had wanted Pedro Pablo Berm√∫dez as his successor to the presidency instead of Luis Jos√© de Orbegoso. On April 17, 1834, the two sides clashed in the Battle of Huaylacucho, in Huancavelica resulting in a victory for the revolutionaries. On April 24, 1834, there was another clash near Jauja. Although the revolutionaries, Obregoso was overthrown the next year by Felipe Santiago Salaverry, sparking the Salaverry-Santa Cruz War. The Peruvian Civil War of 1834, also known as the Berm√∫dez Revolution, was a conflict that began in Peru after the election of General Luis Jos√© de Orbegoso as the country‚Äôs provisional president. Former president and General Agust√≠n Gamarra, unhappy with election results, incited General Pedro Berm√∫dez to stir up a rebellion against the new government. The rebellion began in January of 1834. The people divided themselves into two factions: the Bermudistas and the Orbegosistas. After several months of fighting on different fronts, the factions peacefully reconciled in what is called the Embrace of Maquinhuayo.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 133. This was the first civil war in the history of Peru as a republic. Context On December 20, 1833, the constitutional term of President August√≠n Gamarra ended. Because a successor had not been chosen due to failed elections months before, the National Convention (a congress of constituents) agreed to choose a provisional president.Perea, ‚ÄúPower of the Law or Power of the Sword\\", 224. Gamarra and the conservatives supported candidate General Pedro Berm√∫dez, while the liberals that dominated the assembly supported General Luis Jos√© de Orbegoso, a less authoritarian soldier. Francisco Xavier de Luna Pizarro, the famous liberal clergyman who presided over the assembly, was like a son to Orbegoso. The other candidate was General Domingo Nieto. The voting was carried out in the midst of the Convention, where Orbegoso received 47 votes, Berm√∫dez received 37, and Nieto received only one. Orbegoso assumed power on the 21st of December, 1833, counting on the approval of the city. His ascension to power meant the end of Gamarra‚Äôs government, which had been worn down because of his authoritarian beliefs. However, the supporters of Gamarra, who continued to control key positions of power, harassed the new administration with the intention of demolishing it and placing Berm√∫dez as the new president.Delaney, ‚ÄúGeneral Miller and the Confederaci√≥n Per√∫-Boliviana‚Äù, 218.

Pamphlets, newspapers and magazines began circulating in different forms and different languages.\\" In April 2013, the Index on Censorship published a report by Gheblawi about \\"Free Speech in Post-Gaddafi Libya.\\" He wrote that while the introduction of freedom of speech in the country had been \\"hailed by many observers as one of the major achievements of the Libyan uprising,\\" the \\"initial euphoria\\" had since yielded to frustration. \\"In the post-uprising reality, newspapers and television channels that dared investigate claims of corruption and human rights violations, committed mostly by rogue militant and fundamentalist armed groups, face violent attacks; television channels have been vandalised, journalists kidnapped and tortured, or forced into silence or exile, and in some cases imprisoned and prosecuted under Gaddafi-era laws.\\" In August 2013, BBC World broadcast an \\"audio essay\\" written and read by Gheblawi. He lamented the \\"serious problems\\" that now afflicted Libya, including continued conflict between different groups and a lack of law and order, all of which had led to widespread \\"despair and frustration\\" among the Libyan people. Still, he said, he was one of many Libyans who still maintained a \\"modest level of hope\\" for the country's future. In a December 2015 article, Gheblawi complained that the international community and local leaders alike were at fault for the failure to build and maintain stable national institutions in Libya after Gaddafi's fall. This failure, he charged, had led to the instability, violence, and terrorism that were now threatening the country and region. He rejected the idea that it would have been better to keep Gaddafi in power, pointing out that the dictator had not only suppressed freedoms in Libya but also helped finance, plan, and carry out terrorist attacks around the world. In January 2016, Gheblawi took part in a BBC World Service discussion of the current situation in Libya. He described the state of affairs in Tripoli as tense, although people were trying to live as normal a day-to-day life as possible. Gheblawi has said that the Gaddafi dictatorship \\"rotted the fabric of society,\\" and consequently Libyans \\"are not proud to be Libyan.\\" Other professional activities He gave a presentation about the Arab Spring at the 2011 Oslo Freedom Forum.

Plot  The movie starts with an accident of a girl Eyl√ºl (Farah Zeynep Abdullah) in Istanbul. She survives it but just one problem - Eyl√ºl cannot remember the past one month of her life that happened to be 'September'. On her insistence, her friends take her to Bozcada Island, where she was for summers in the previous month. Eyl√ºl just wants to know what happened in that past September which she cannot remember. There in Bozcada, she meets a native man called Tekin or Tek (Engin Aky√ºrek). Tek is a very innocent soft-spoken and decent islander who is a cartoonist by profession. But he has a drawback - he is not beautiful. And this outer ugliness hides his inner beauty. Tek immediately claims to Eyl√ºl that they both fell in love with each other in the previous month. Eyl√ºl does not believe this, as she cannot accept the fact that she being a pretty Istanbul girl can fall in love with a dirty and ugly man like Tek! She runs away from him feeling scared, but Tek follows her. When he reaches her he calms her down telling her that he will not hurt her and that he is telling her the truth. As Tek hears Eyl√ºl's friend coming, he leaves after asking her to remember him. When Eyl√ºl asks him that why does he wants her to remember him, Tek replies 'Because I am not just a memory.' and leaves. Eyl√ºl's friends try to convince her about returning to Istanbul but she wants to stay. The viewers are shown in flashback scenes, what actually happened. In the previous month, Eyl√ºl is vacationing on Bozcada Island with her friends. Tek who paints the caravans and signboards, falls in love with her at first sight. A little girl there who is close to Tek plays a trick and gifts a hat to Eyl√ºl telling her that it is given by Tek. They look at each other for the first time then. Tek invites her to dinner which she accepts. Her friend asks her what she is doing to which Eyl√ºl replies that it won't be bad to have some fun during vacation. Tek waits for her at the dinner table which he has arranged, but she doesn't come. Before this scene we hear Tek's conversation with his mother and get to know about him. Tek tells his mother about his inferiority complexes. He says that he is different from these civilized people, who belong to the modern world, as he is not physically beautiful like them. Being a cartoonist, his hands are always stained with paint. But he tells his mother that he has fallen in love with one from this different kind, a girl who is pretty and quite a part of that world. Tek is scared that she might reject him but also feels at the same time that Eyl√ºl will fall in love with him. With these flaws in his appearance and with his quite nature, Tek forced himself to live in a faraway island, so that he is away from the fast world, where he considers himself to be a misfit. Nevertheless, despite of Eyl√ºl's disrespectful behavior towards him and regardless of the fact that she plays with his emotions, Tek continues to pursue her. He brings her to his simple house, which is a small wooden workshop where he does his paintings. His bed is fixed in open-air like a big swing. His kitchen and bath-tub are all set outside. Tek's house is a typical island residence. He shows her his cartoon publications. There Eyl√ºl tells him that she is a big fan of his paintings and had decided to marry the person who drew them. But she quite insultingly exclaims that she expected someone better looking than him. Tek is hurt and looks himself in the mirror and thinks that he is ugly and how can a beautiful girl like Eyl√ºl love him? These all flashbacks and Tek reminding Eyl√ºl of their times spent together in the present day in are shown simultaneously. Tek tries to make her remember through a book in which he compiled all their meetings through his artistic drawings. He reminds her of the sunset they watched together. In the past scenes, we see that Eyl√ºl has also fallen in love with Tek. She loves his pure nature, his creativity and enjoys his company. They explore the island together, draw paintings and watch movies with Tek's puppy and the little girl. In the present time Tek makes Eyl√ºl recall near the sea where he wrote their names on sand. She remembers and calls to him. They hug each other and Tek tells her that he missed her a lot. Then again he tells her how she taught him swimming and that how much he was scared to even dip his feet in the water but she encouraged him to go deeper and caught him when he was frightened. All these days in the previous month of September when Eyl√ºl was staying at Tek's place, she never told her friends about him. It is because she herself is complexed to tell people of her class about the man she has fallen in love with. Eyl√ºl does love Tek but is not brave to confess it to the whole world as she fears that she will be made fun having fallen in love with a shaggy man like Tek. She has lied to her friends that she is travelling the island with some friends and will return soon. One night during her stay at Tek's place, a friend calls Eyl√ºl. She is not near so Tek picks it up. But she quickly snatches the phone from him and tells her friend on the other end that she will be back soon. Tek listens to this and is hurt again that Eyl√ºl is not telling her people about falling in love with him. He says to her melancholy that he wishes that he was a handsome man with unstained hands so that she could have introduced him to her people with pride. Eyl√ºlsoothes him and says that she does not want any handsome man but she wants this Tek with stained hands. Tek and Eyl√ºl are in love and spent a pleasant night together. The next morning Eyl√ºl wakes-up before Tek and puts on his stained shirt that he wears while painting. She kisses Tek good morning and tells him to get up as she will prepare breakfast herself. Eyl√ºl is dancing on music, is enjoying the beauty of Bozcada and is picking up berries. She is making breakfast but suddenly, something makes her to STOP... She is startled to see her image in the mirror. In Tek's dirty shirt and with her dry hairs and with a face without her cosmetics, she sees herself to be ugly. She looks herself in the mirror and then at Tek. She gets scared that if she continues staying here because of her love for Tek, she would become as ugly as him and will end up as an outcast, just like Tek. This Eyl√ºl who loves life, loses her love for Tek to her love for the glamour world. She calls her friend at that very instant and asks her to come and take her. Thus, Eyl√ºl leaves a sleeping Tek without saying a word to him. At night when she is all pretty in her party clothes and make-up and is enjoying drinks with her friends near her hotel, Tek comes to see her. Eyl√ºl is worried as she sees him fearing her truth might be exposed. She introduces him to her friends as her friend Tek. Tek asks her to come with him to their house. Eyl√ºl's friend asks Tek who he is and what does he do. Tek in his simple manner tells that he is a cartoonist and he and Eyl√ºl are both in love with each other and have spent time together. On hearing this Eyl√ºl's friend asks her that where did she find this idiot from? She remains silent and doesn't know what to say. When Tek insists her to come, her friend pushes him. Eyl√ºl stops him and makes Tek go from there. The next day Eyl√ºl is leaving Bozcada on boat with her friends. Tek is there. He is telling her to stay and is asking her that why she is leaving him when she loves him. She is not convincing in her replies and is saying to Tek that she is like this and she told him not to take her seriously. She just wants to go away from him and leaves. In the present day, Tek and Eyl√ºl are sitting in the same restaurant where they used to meet in the previous month. Eyl√ºl has remembered almost everything now. On hearing her friends approaching them, Tek leaves from there after giving Eyl√ºl his drawing book. She tries to stop him, but Tek wants to leaves, he somehow does not want to be with her in her friends' presence. As her friends come to her, they ask Eyl√ºl who she was with. She says that she was with Tek. Her friends are shocked and ask her what the hell she is talking about. Eyl√ºl says that she is going to Tek, she left him before but will not leave him now. She runs away. Her friends run after her but she in a small cart drives towards Tek's cabin. She calls for him but he is nowhere. Tek‚Äôs bed is swinging in air and his puppy is strolling around. Eyl√ºl sees that little girl who actually introduced them. She asks her where is Tek. The girl replies that he is where he was. Eyl√ºl then runs towards the beach where in the sea she taught him to swim. She sees Tek standing there, with his back towards her. She goes near to him. Tek is watching constantly into the sea. Eyl√ºl says, ‚ÄòTek, I‚Äôve come, let‚Äôs go home.‚Äô Then the viewers are shown the scene after Eyl√ºl left him, one month ago. As her boat is going farther and farther, Tek goes into the sea, trying to swim and saying that he is not scared as Eyl√ºl was with him. He goes deeper and deeper and loses his balance. Tek drowns in the sea, he cannot pull himself above again as he is not a proper swimmer. Eyl√ºl in present day is seeing all this and she jumps after him into the sea. Tek drowned and died in the sea a month back.. Eyl√ºl‚Äôs accident occurred because while going in the jeep which her friend was driving, she read Tek‚Äôs death news in the newspaper and became hysterical and started beating her friend. He lost control and the car crashed. In present when Eyl√ºl has jumped into the sea after the Tek who drowned few weeks back there, sees his drawing pen and picks it up. When she swims up she writes her and Tek‚Äôs names on the sand, just like he wrote there in September. From the start of the movie, Tek was already dead.

The mutiny prompted a series of reforms by the government. Background The Ansar force was formed as the \\"East Pakistan Ansars\\" by the East Pakistan Ansars Act of 1948, and officially launched on 12 February 1948. From 1948 to 1972, it was under the National Service Board. In 1973, it was placed under the Ministry of Home Affairs and an Ansar cadre was formed in the Bangladesh Civil Service. Together with its sister organization Village Defence Party, it has over 4 million members including reserves. Events The Bangladesh Ansar mutinied in the Ansar Academy in Shafipur, and Khilgaon on 1 December 1994, demanding higher pay, job security and better treatment from officers. The mutiny was ended on 4 December 1994, when a military operation was launched by Bangladesh Rifles, supported by the Bangladesh Police and helicopters from Bangladesh Air Force. Official estimates place the death toll at 1 or 2 and 12-40 Ansar personnel were injured. Independent estimates place 30 mutineers among the casualty. Aftermath Journalist and social critic, Farhad Mazhar, called the mutiny inevitable because of the social discrimination faced by members of Bangladesh Ansar. He was jailed for his views on the mutiny. = Reform = In response to the agitations, the government passed a series of acts in the Jatiya Sangsad. These include Ansar Bahini Act (1995), Battalion Ansar Act (1995) and the Village Defence Party Act (1995). Under these acts, the Ansar Bahini and the Battalion Ansars were declared a \\"Disciplined Force\\" in accordance with article 152 of the Constitution. The government set up Ansar VDP Bank where the members of Ansar-VDP were decided to be the shareholders. The bank also provides soft loans to Ansar members.

The church was constructed between 1890 and 1896 to cater to the religious needs of the cotton mill workers of the Krenholm Manufacturing Company. The cathedral was the only building standing after the bombing of the city in 1944 during World War II. History In 1890, the shareholders of the Krenholm Manufacturing Company, under the initiative of director Ivan Prove, decided to construct an Orthodox church for the workers of the company. The shareholders of the company donated 500,000 roubles to construct the church on land donated by Prove. The foundation stone was laid by Bishop Alexander Dmitrievich (Arseny) Bryantsev in the presence of Czar Alexander III and Empress Maria Feodorovna on August 5, 1890. The cathedral also commemorates the meeting between the German Emperor Wilhelm II and Czar Alexander III. While Narva received heavy bombardment during world War II, the cathedral remained standing till the end of the war. On 20 January 1958, it was renamed as the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The cathedral underwent extensive renovations as part of its centenary celebrations. The renovated basement church was consecrated in the name of Seraphim of Sarov by Archbishop Cornelius of Tallinn and all of Estonia on November 16, 1996. Architecture The Iconostasis in the cathedral The architecture is Neo-Byzantine and the architect was Pavel Alis. The church is made in the Greek Cross plan, with a square central mass and four arms of equal length. The walls and dome for the cathedral was made with red bricks sourced locally. The stairways and other aisles were made of Rapakivi granite procured from Finland. The cathedral can hold up to 2000 people during mass and has a bell tower which is 28.8 m high.

It utilizes knowledge of mathematics, physics, materials sciences, and engineering technologies. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines.  Dawn of civilization to early Antiquity  Engineering arose in early civilization as a general discipline for the creation of large scale structures such as irrigation, architecture, and military projects. Advances in food production through irrigation allowed a portion of the population to become specialists in Ancient Babylon. All six of the classic simple machines were known in the ancient Near East. The wedge and the inclined plane (ramp) were known since prehistoric times. The wheel, along with the wheel and axle mechanism, was invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC. The lever mechanism first appeared around 5,000 years ago in the Near East, where it was used in a simple balance scale, and to move large objects in ancient Egyptian technology. The lever was also used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC, and then in ancient Egyptian technology circa 2000 BC. The earliest evidence of pulleys date back to Mesopotamia in the early 2nd millennium BC, and ancient Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty (1991-1802 BC). The screw, the last of the simple machines to be invented, first appeared in Mesopotamia during the Neo-Assyrian period (911-609) BC. The Egyptian pyramids were built using three of the six simple machines, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the lever, to create structures like the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Assyrians were notable in their use of metallurgy and incorporation of iron weapons. Many of their advancements were in military equipment. They were not the first to develop them, but did make advancements on the wheel and the chariot. They made use of pivot-able axles on their wagons, allowing easy turning. They were also one of the first armies to use the move-able siege tower and battering ram. The application of mechanical engineering can be seen in the archives of various ancient societies. The pulley appeared in Mesopotamia in 1,500 BC, improving water transportation. German Archaeologist Robert Koldewey found that the Hanging Gardens likely used a mechanical pump powered by these pulleys to transport water to the roof gardens. The Mesopotamians would advance even further by replacing \\"the substitution of continuous for intermittent motion, and the rotary for back-and-forth motion\\" by 1,200 BC. The Sakia was developed in the kingdom of Kush during the 4th century BC. It lifted water 3 to 8 metres with less expenditure of labor and time. Reservoirs in the form of Hafirs were developed in Kush to store water and boost irrigation.Fritz Hintze, Kush XI; pp.222-224.Bloomeries and blast furnaces were developed during the seventh century BC in Meroe. Kushite sundials applied mathematics in the form of advanced trigonometry. In Ancient Egypt, the screw pump is another example of the use of engineering to boost efficiency of water transportation. Although the Early Egyptians built colossal structures such as the pyramids, they did not develop pulleys for the lifting of heavy stone, and used the wheel very little. The earliest practical water-powered machines, the water wheel and watermill, first appeared in the Persian Empire, in what are now Iraq and Iran, by the early 4th century BC. In Ancient Greece, Archimedes (287‚Äì212 BC) developed several key theories in the field of mechanical engineering including mechanical advantage, the Law of the Lever, and his name sake, Archimedes‚Äô law. In Ptolematic Egypt, the Museum of Alexandria developed crane pulleys with block and tackles to lift stones. These cranes were powered with human tread wheels and were based on earlier Mesopotamian water-pulley systems. The Greeks would later develop mechanical artillery independently of the Chinese. The first of these would fire darts, but advancements allowed for stone to be tossed at enemy fortifications or formations.  Late Antiquity to early Middle Ages  In Roman Egypt, Heron of Alexandria (c. 10‚Äì70 AD) created the first steam-powered device, the Aeolipile.\\"Heron of Alexandria\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2010 - Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Accessed: 9 May 2010. The first of its kind, it did not have the capability to move or power anything but its own rotation. In China, Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 AD) improved a water clock and invented a seismometer. Ma Jun (200‚Äì265 AD) invented a chariot with differential gears. Leo the Philosopher is noted to have worked on a signal system using clocks in the Byzantine Empire in 850, connecting Constantinople with the Cicilian Frontier and was a continuation of the complex city clocks in Eastern Rome. These grand machines diffused into the Arabian Empire under Harun al-Rashid. Another grand mechanical device was the Organ, which was reintroduced in 757 when Constantine V gifted one to Pepin the short. With the exception of a few machines, engineering and science stagnated in the West due to the collapse of the Roman Empire during late antiquity.  Middle Ages  During the Islamic Golden Age (7th to 15th century), Muslim inventors made remarkable contributions in the field of mechanical technology. Al-Jazari, who was one of them, wrote his famous Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices in 1206 and presented many mechanical designs. Al-Jazari is also the first known person to create devices such as the crankshaft and camshaft, which now form the basics of many mechanisms.Al-Jazar√≠.

The earliest practical wind-powered machines, the windmill and wind pump, first appeared in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age, in what are now Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, by the 9th century AD.Ahmad Y Hassan, Donald Routledge Hill (1986). Islamic Technology: An illustrated history, p. 54. Cambridge University Press. . The earliest practical steam-powered machine was a steam jack driven by a steam turbine, described in 1551 by Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf in Ottoman Egypt.Taqi al-Din and the First Steam Turbine, 1551 A.D. , web page, accessed on line 23 October 2009; this web page refers to Ahmad Y Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, pp. 34-5, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo.Ahmad Y. Hassan (1976), Taqi al-Din and Arabic Mechanical Engineering, p. 34-35, Institute for the History of Arabic Science, University of Aleppo The cotton gin was invented in India by the 6th century AD, and the spinning wheel was invented in the Islamic world by the early 11th century, both of which were fundamental to the growth of the cotton industry. The spinning wheel was also a precursor to the spinning jenny, which was a key development during the early Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. The crankshaft and camshaft were invented by Al-Jazari in Northern Mesopotamia circa 1206,Georges Ifrah (2001). The Universal History of Computing: From the Abacus to the Quatum Computer, p. 171, Trans. E.F. Harding, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (See ) and they later became central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls. The earliest programmable machines were developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century. In 1206, Al- Jazari invented programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.Professor Noel Sharkey, A 13th Century Programmable Robot (Archive), University of Sheffield. The castle clock, a hydropowered mechanical astronomical clock invented by Al-Jazari, was the first programmable analog computer.Howard R.

Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) The medieval Chinese horologist and engineer Su Song (1020‚Äì1101 AD) incorporated an escapement mechanism into his astronomical clock tower two centuries before escapement devices were found in medieval European clocks and also invented the world's first known endless power-transmitting chain drive.Needham, Joseph (1986). Science and Civilization in China: Volume 4. Taipei: Caves Books, Ltd. The Middle Ages saw the wide spread adoption of machines to aid in labor. The many rivers of England and northern Europe allowed the power of moving water to be utilized. The water-mill became instrumental in the production of many goods such as food, fabric, leathers, and papers. These machines used were some of the first to use cogs and gears, which greatly increased the mills productivity. The camshaft allowed rotational force to be converted into directional force. Less significantly, tides of bodies of water were also harnessed. Wind-power later became the new source of energy in Europe, supplementing the water mill. This advancement moved out of Europe into the Middle East during the Crusades. Metallurgy advanced by a large degree during the Middle Ages, with higher quality iron allowing for more sturdy constructions and designs. Mills and mechanical power provided a consistent supply of trip-hammer strikes and air from the bellows. Da Vinci's flying machine concepts  European Renaissance  During the 17th century, important breakthroughs in the foundations of mechanical engineering occurred in England. Sir Isaac Newton formulated Newton's Laws of Motion and developed Calculus, the mathematical basis of physics. Newton was reluctant to publish his works for years, but he was finally persuaded to do so by his colleagues, such as Sir Edmond Halley, much to the benefit of all mankind. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is also credited with creating Calculus during this time period. Leonardo da Vinci was a notable engineer, designing and studying many mechanical systems that were focused around transportation and warfare His designs would later be compared to early aircraft design. Although wind power provided a source of energy away from riverside estate and saw massive improvements in its harnessing, it could not replace the consistent and strong power of the watermill. Water would remain the primary source of power of pre- industrial urban industry through the Renaissance.  Industrial Revolution  At the end of the Renaissance, scientists and engineers were beginning to experiment with steam power. Most of the early apparatuses faced problems of low horsepower, inefficiency, or danger. The need arose for an effective and economical power source because of the flooding of deep-mines in England, which could not be pumped out using alternative methods. The first working design was Thomas Savory's 1698 patent. He continuously worked on improving and marketing the invention across England. At the same time, others were working on improvements to Savory's design, which did not transfer heat effectively. Thomas Newcomen would take all the advancements of the engineers and develop the Newcomen Atmospheric Engine. This new design would greatly reduce heat loss, move water directly from the engine, and allow variety of proportions to be built in. The Industrial Revolution brought steam powered factories utilizing mechanical engineering concepts. These advances allowed an incredible increase in production scale, numbers, and efficiency. During the 19th century, material sciences advances had begun to allow implementation of steam engines into Steam Locomotives and Steam-Powered Ships, quickly increasing the speed at which people and goods could move across the world. The reason for these advances were the machine tools were developed in England, Germany, and Scotland. These allowed mechanical engineering to develop as a separate field within engineering. They brought with them manufacturing machines and the engines to power them.Engineering ‚Äì Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, accessed 6 May 2008 At the near end of the Industrial Revolution, internal combustion engine technology brought with it the piston airplane and automobile. Aerospace Engineering would develop in the early 20th century as an offshoot of mechanical engineering, eventually incorporating rocketry. Coal was replaced by oil based derivatives for many applications.  Modern Age  With the advents of computers in the 20th century, more precise design and manufacturing methods were available to engineers. The rise of CAD software has reduced design times and allowed for precision manufacturing. Engineers are able to simulate the forces and stresses of designs through computer programs. Automated and Computerized manufacturing allowed many new fields to emerge from Mechanical Engineering such as Industrial Engineering. Although a majority of automobiles remain to be gas powered, electric vehicles have risen as a feasible alternative. Because of the increased complexity of engineering projects, many disciplines of engineer collaborate and specialize in sub fields. One of these collaborations is the field of robotics, in which electrical engineers, computer engineers, and mechanical engineers can specialize in and work together. Mechanical Engineering is the most popular of all the engineering fields for college majors in the 21st century. = Professional associations = The first British professional society of mechanical engineers was formed in 1847 Institution of Mechanical Engineers, thirty years after the civil engineers formed the first such professional society Institution of Civil Engineers.R.A. Buchanan. The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb. 1985), pp. 42‚Äì60. In the United States, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) was formed in 1880, becoming the third such professional engineering society, after the American Society of Civil Engineers (1852) and the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1871).ASME history , accessed 6 May 2008. = Education = The first schools in the United States to offer an mechanical engineering education were the United States Military Academy in 1817, an institution now known as Norwich University in 1819, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1825.

When Mauryan central power disappeared, several small independent entities were formed, which started to strike their own coins, defining a period of Post-Mauryan coinage that ends with the rise of the Gupta Empire in the 4th century CE. This phenomenon was particularly precocious and significant in the area of Gandhara in the northwest, and more particularly in the city of Taxila,The Coins Of India, by Brown, C.J. p.13-20 in modern-day Pakistan. Technology =Punch-marked coinage= c. 600‚Äì300 BCE. This coinage was minted under Achaemenid administration in Gandhara.CNG Coins These political changes were accompanied by technological changes in coin production techniques. Before the collapse of the Maurya Empire, the main type of coinage was punch-marked coins. After manufacturing a sheet of silver or silver alloys, coins were cut out to the proper weight, and then impressed by small punch-dies. Typically from 5 to 10 punch dies could be impressed on one coin. =Cast die-struck coinage= The types of coins were replaced at the fall of the Maurya Empire by cast, die-struck coins.Recent Perspectives of Early Indian History Book Review Trust, New Delhi, Popular Prakashan, 1995, p.151 Each individual coins was first cast by pouring a molten metal, usually copper or silver, into a cavity formed by two molds. These were then usually die-struck while still hot, first on just one side, and then on the two sides at a later period. The coin devices are Indian, but it is thought that this coin technology was introduced from the West, possibly from the neighboring Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Coin types =Single-die coins= The most ancient of the coins are those that were die-cast on one side only, the other side remaining blank. They seem to start as early 220 BCE, that is, already in the last decades of the Maurya Empire.CNG Coins notice Some of these coins were created before the Indo-Greek invasions (dated to circa 185 BCE, start of the Yavana era), while most of the others were created later. These coins incorporate a number of symbols, in a way which is very reminiscent of the prievous punch-marked coins, except that this time the technology used was cast single die-struck coinage.Ancient Indian Coinage, Rekha Jain, D.K.Printworld Ltd, p.114 Single-die coins before Indo-Greek invasions (220-185 BCE) File:Taxila (local coinage).

Single-die coins after the Indo-Greek invasions (185 BCE) The year 185 BCE is the approximate date the Greco-Bactrians invaded India. This date marks an evolution in the design of single-die cast coins, as deities and realistic animals were introduced. At the same time coinage technology also evolved, as double-die coins (engraved on both sides, obverse and reverse) started to appear. The archaeological excavations of coins have shown that these coins, as well as the new double die coins, were contemporary with those of the Indo- Greeks. According to Osmund Bopearachchi these coins, and particularly those depicting the goddess Lakshmi, were probably minted by Demetrius I following his invasion of Gandhara.Osmund Bopearachchi, 2016, Emergence of Vi·π£·πáu and ≈öiva Images in India: Numismatic and Sculptural Evidence File:Taxila (local coinage).

These coins have quite specific types, depending mainly on the region where they were struck. Coins with a lion device are mainly known from Taxila, while coins with other symbols such as the Swastika or the Bodhi tree are attributed to the region of Gandhara. These coins were cast during the rule of Indo-Greek kings Pantaleon and Agathocles in the area of Gandhara, and they are generally contemporary with those of Indo-Greek rulers.CNG notice Symbolic designs File:Taxila coin with wheel and Buddhist symbols.jpgTaxila coin with wheel and Buddhist symbols.

The symbol at the top of the bull is only a mint mark. These symbols disappeared soon after, and only the elephant and the bull remained. The Indo-Greeks, following their invasion of the Indian subcontinent circa 185 BCE, in turn started to mint their own coins in the Indian standard (Indian weight, square shape, and less often round shape) with bilingual inscriptions, from the reign of Agathocles (190-180 BCE). =Symbolism= In addition to their own Attic coins, Greek kings thus started to issue bilingual Greek-Prakrit coins in the Indian standard, often taking over numerous symbols of the Post-Mauryan Gandhara coins, such as the arched-hill symbol and the tree-in-railing or Goddess Lakshmi at the beginning, and depictions of the bull and elephant later. =Legends= Several coins of king Agathocles use the Kharoshthi legend Akathukreyasa \\"Agathocles\\" on the obverse, and Hira√±asame on the reverse (as one of the known coins of Taxila above). Hira√±asame would mean \\"The Golden Hermitage\\", an area of Taxila (preferred interpretation), or if read 'Hitajasame would mean \\"Good-fame possessing\\", a direct translation of \\"Agathokles\\"Monnaies Gr√©co-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques, Bopearachchi, p.176Geography from Ancient Indian Coins & Seals, Parmanand Gupta, Concept Publishing Company, 1989, p.126 File:Pantaleon with Lakshmi and Lion.jpgCoinage of Pantaleon with dancing woman (Lakshmi?) and lion.

Later on, from the second half of the reign of Apollodotus I (ruled 180-160 BCE), legends would become standardized, with simply the King's name and attribute in Greek on the obverse and Kharoshthi Prakrit on the reverse. The usage of Indian symbols would become much more restrained, generally limited to the illustration of the elephant and the zebu bull. There are two major exceptions however: Menander I and Menander II used the Indian Wheel of the Law on some of their coins, suggesting an affiliation with Buddhism, which is also described in literary sources. However the usage of bilingualism would endure, at first coexisting with Attic-standard coins, and later becoming exclusive. The last Indo-Greek kings even went as far as issuing some Prakrit-only coinage. The period of Indo-Greek coinage in northwestern India would last until the beginning of our era.

Miner: A North Country Legend, Retrieved October 30, 2011 Heart's Delight Farm, the land that would become Miner Institute, was developed by William H. Miner on his family homestead beginning in 1903. Biography Miner focused on farming and philanthropy, founding the Chazy Central Rural School, Physician's Hospital (now called CVPH Medical Center) and expanding Heart's Delight Farm into all areas of agricultural production. Miner also oversaw construction of hydroelectric dams and powerhouses throughout Chazy and Altona. The largest dam, finished in 1915, cost one million dollars and held one billion gallons of water. It supplied power to the area for seven years until equipment failure forced its closing.Miner Open House Open house shows interest in Miner Institute. July 28, 2009 Between 1910 and 1920 Miner purchased over 5,000 acres of land. At peak size, the farm had 4,000 acres of tillable land, 2,000 acres of pasture and 6,000 acres of woodland. Fruits, vegetables, beef and dairy cattle, mules, sheep, pigs, chickens, turkeys, pheasants and brook trout were raised on the farm. In addition to the 800 regularly employed workers Miner hired around 100 families to camp at Flat Rock and pick berries. At the height of production Miner was shipping 16,000 quarts of berries a day to major metropolitan areas.Life at Flat Rock. ‚Äò‚ÄôLife on the Rock‚Äô‚Äô Westie, Leland. 2002. http://www.apnmag.com/natural%20selections/past%20stories/jack%20pine/jackpine.htm Heart‚Äôs Delight food products were sold nationwide. The farm‚Äôs 800 workers at that time worked draft horses, purebred horses and the farm had its own dairy, box factory, ice house, natatorium, greenhouses and gristmill. Miner also built a 20-bedroom guesthouse and an entertainment center named Harmony Hall, which included an auditorium, complete with a stage large enough for 300 people.

Blanchard wrote most of the compositions for the record, except for pianist Edward Simon‚Äôs waltz \\"The Process\\" and jazz standard \\"I Thought About You\\". For the latter song, the album was nominated in 2000 for Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Solo. Critical reception Willard Jenkins of Jazz Times stated \\"Anyone expecting Terence Blanchard to rest on his laurels, comfortably ensconced in the lucrative world of motion picture scoring, better think again. Though his abiding interest in film scoring is evidenced by his continuing ascension to the A list of the genre, and his beautifully crafted journey through a program of film classics on last year‚Äôs superior Sony record was clear evidence of his immersion in that world, Blanchard remains a jazz trumpeter, bandleader and composer to his core. All three attributes are in stout form on this latest date for Sony Classical... There is a handsome, dusky quality to this date, rather like a rich black coffee or that mahogany table you‚Äôve been coveting, as Blanchard explores a fine palette of moods and colors, with one contribution from Simon, the intrepid ‚ÄúThe Process,‚Äù and the evergreen ‚ÄúI Thought About You.‚Äù The rest is pure Blanchard.\\" Lee Prosse of Jazz Review mentioned \\"Jazz trumpeter Terence Blanchard has quite the resume: he played in Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers in the 1980s and composed the music for some of director Spike Lee's films... On MOON, he's joined by a couple of notable vets‚Äîsaxophonist Branford Marsalis and acoustic bassist Dave Holland (no stranger to these electro-pages & he's played with everyone from Anthony Braxton to Bonnie Raitt) and some names new to me: ace sax-fellows Brice Winston & Aaron Fletcher. Pianist Edward Simon plays with sweet lyricism as well as vigor, and Eric Harland is a stunningly dynamic drummer in the multi- rhythmic Blakey mold. Hey Wynton, dig this!\\" Michael G. Nastos of Allmusic wrote \\"Trumpeter Blanchard has released some fine recordings in the '90s, but this one may be the best of them all, as he asserts himself as a composer of truly original modern jazz. He wrote seven selections, utilizing one or two of three saxophonists per cut‚ÄîBranford Marsalis and Brice Winston (tenor) or Aaron Fletcher (alto). It's the rhythm section that boils this pot over; bassist David Holland and especially pianist Edward Simon are en fuego, while young drummer Eric Harland continues to show steady progress en route to becoming a first-rate trappist... Sparks fly, and unrequited moods coalesce during this prismatic epic of emotions, swing, and truly new mainstream jazz from Blanchard and his cohorts.

He additionally served as the Hackensack Water Company's president for at least 15 years, and as a trustee or director of multiple other corporations. He also led public charity work. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed DeForest to the State Tenement House Commission, which he served as chairman and which produced the Tenement House Law of 1901. It also led to the creation of a New York state Tenement House Department in 1902, following an amendment to the state charter.

Biography  Milosav Jovanoviƒá was born in Opariƒá, a village near Jagodina, Serbia, in 1935. He resided in Begaljica, a village near Belgrade, where he lived until his death, in 2014. He began doing painting in 1955. He is considered to be one of the foremost contributors to the naive art genre, with a worldwide reputation. He is considered to be one of the foremost contributors to the Serbian outsider art and naive art genres in former Yugoslavia and later on, in Serbia. Because of his original artistic expression and characteristic technique of painting, he got a worldwide reputation.N.

By painting landscapes the artist described the interior of his visions composed of suppressed fears, lost hopes and erotic phantasmagoria. The combination of spontaneous and instinctive presentation of the subject matter and its patient pictorial development is surprising. In his works of dense intensity in artistic expression and mystic messages, the inclination towards the decorative is combined with inner symbolical tension. The painter superficially distributed stylized shapes on the surface of the painting, avoiding empty areas and animating them using characteristic colour signs. These are short strokes in the shape of dots, blots, broken and parallel lines, circles or rhombus. The artist thereby intensifies the strength of experience by employing raw tint. His colour is not a coat but the texture. It brings pronounced energy and warmth, but reduces the predominance of the subject matter in its entire suggestiveness. The structure of forms which is especially interesting for the artist reveals his horror vacui therefore, he is persistently devoted to each segment of the coloured pigment, construing miniature cones over the flat surface. The encounters of red and greed reveal the passion of his chromatic expression, while his drawings, as a separate artistic branch, show even more inventive approach to the presentation of the vision itself.Oto Bihalji-Merin; Neboj≈°a Bato Toma≈°eviƒá, Enciklopedija naivne umetnosti sveta, Beograd, 1984 His drawing in Indian ink is a special quality within his oeuvre. The pronounced continuity, permeation, intertwining of vibrant graphic, filled and empty surfaces, i.e. black and white, optically contributes to the kinetics of pictorial elements. He had independent and group shows in the country and abroad.  Exhibitions and awards  From 1960 Milosav Jovanoviƒá participated in significant international exhibitions and biennial and triennial events worldwide. From 1966, he exhibited at World Triennial in Bratislava. He received a series of recognition, including the Award for Entire Artistic Work at the Eleventh Biennial in MNMA, Jagodina, Serbia. N.

Jakob Jensen was born in Helgen√¶s on Djursland where he grew up on the family farm but he later moved to Aarhus where he worked as a mason and later as a politician. He founded the local mason's union, was involved in numerous organizations and during his tenure as mayor he was instrumental in expanding the Port of Aarhus and getting the University of Aarhus established. Jakob Jensen was a member of the Danish Social Democratic Party.  Public service  In the 1880s he became involved in the Social Democratic worker's movements in 1883 he helped establish Murernes Fagforening (Mason's Union) and from 1887 he functioned as the president of it. From 1894 he functioned as the spokesperson of business matters for Arbejdernes Forbrugsforening (Worker's Union of Consumers). In 1900 Jakob Jensen was elected to the City Council and in 1919 he became the first publicly elected mayor of the city. His primary focus in the council was in the areas of education and the municipally owned Port of Aarhus. During Jensen's tenure the elementary schools on Finsensgade, N.J. Fjords Gade, Sams√∏gade, L√¶ss√∏esgade and Ingerslevs Boulevard were built and he was the primary driver behind Marselisborg Gymnasium and the location of Aarhus University. Jakob Jensen served as mayor for 13 years before he left office to Hans Peder Christensen. Jakob Jensen was a strong opponent of public intoxication and workers spending their salaries in the nightlife instead of their families. He advocated for limiting permits and opening hours of bars and would famously show up in bars to personally stop people from drinking, if necessary with physical force.  Depictions  Aarhus Yacht Harbor was inaugurated on 14 May 1933 and a memorial stone for Jakob Jensen was unveiled. The relief was made by the artist Jenny Salicath and the inscription reads \\"Borgmester Jakob Jensen. Medlem af Aarhus Havneudvalg 1900‚Äì1933\\" (English: Mayor Jakob Jensen.

It lies in the Puna de Atacama, a region of tall volcanic peaks on a high plateau close to the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. It is the second highest active volcano in the world after Ojos del Salado. Llullaillaco formed during two different phases in the Pleistocene-Holocene out of dacitic lava flows. The oldest rocks are about 1.5 million years old. About 150,000 years ago, the volcano's southeastern flank collapsed, generating a debris avalanche that reached as far as from the summit. The youngest dated rocks were erupted 5,600 ¬± 250 years ago in the summit region, but there are reports of activity from the 19th century. The mountain's first recorded climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs and a number of archeological sites were found on the mountain and at its feet; Llullaillaco marks the highest archeological site in the world. In 1999, the mummified remains of three children, known as the Children of Llullaillaco, were found at its summit. They are presumed to have been human sacrifices. The occurrence of mice in the summit region has been reported as well.  Name  The name Llullaillaco is derived from the Quechua word meaning \\"false\\", \\"lie\\" or \\"deceitful\\" and or meaning \\"water\\". This name probably refers to the meltwater from snow, which flows down the slopes but then is absorbed into the soil. Normally such mountains are sources for water. Another translation in Aymara is \\"hot water\\".  Geography and geology  Volcanism in the Andes is caused by the subduction of the Nazca Plate and the Antarctic Plate beneath the South America Plate. The Nazca Plate subducts at a speed of and the Antarctic Plate at a speed of . Volcanism does not occur along a continuous chain; there are four separate regions named: the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone, the Southern Volcanic Zone, and the Austral Volcanic Zone. The formation of magma results from the release of water and other volatile material from the subducting plate, which is then injected into the above-lying mantle wedge. The volcanic zones are separated by areas where the subducting plate subducts at a flatter angle and volcanism is absent. The Peruvian flat slab between the Northern and the Central Volcanic Zones is associated with the subduction of the Nazca Ridge, the Pampean flat slab between the Central and the Southern Volcanic Zone is associated with the subduction of the Juan Fernandez Ridge, and the Patagonian volcanic gap between the Southern and the Austral Volcanic Zone is associated with the Chile Triple Junction. About 178 volcanoes are found in the Andes, 60 of which have been active in historical times. In addition, large calderas and monogenetic volcanoes exist in the Andes. = Local setting = Llullaillaco is part of the Central Volcanic Zone. At least 44 volcanic centres with historical activity and 18 large caldera-forming volcanoes have been identified in the Central Volcanic Zone. Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone mostly occurs on the Altiplano and the Cordillera Occidental. A number of volcanoes there reach heights of over above sea level. Large Miocene ignimbrites that cover large surfaces are also part of the regional geology. Llullaillaco is located about east of the Peru-Chile Trench. The Wadati- Benioff zone is deep. Llullaillaco is located in the northwestern Argentine Andes, towards the southern end of the Puna. The border between Argentina (Salta Province) and Chile crosses the volcano. It lies in the Puna de Atacama, a region of very high volcanic peaks on a high plateau close to the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places in the world. Llullaillaco seen from Cerro Paranal, 189 km away. The volcano is an imposing mountain, rising by above the Salar de Punta Negra away. With a summit height of , or alternatively or , it is the second highest active volcano in the world after Ojos del Salado (, ). The height of the mountain and the clear air in the region make Llullaillaco visible from Cerro Paranal, 189 km away as measured by Google Maps. The region is dry and located at high altitudes, making work in the area difficult. farther east of Llullaillaco lies the Miocene Cerro Rosado volcano (). This volcano has erupted dacitic lava flows during the Pliocene-Quaternary on its northeastern and southern flanks. east of Llullaillaco, and behind Cerro Rosado, lies the Salar de Llullaillaco ( ), a salt pan with warm springs at its western and southwestern shores and three abandoned borate mines: Mina Amalia and the salt mines Mina Luisa and Mina Maria. Mitral mountain () lies southwest of Llullaillaco and is of Miocene age. It features an eroded crater that opens to the northwest. Iris mountain () north of Llullaillaco is constructed of Pliocene rocks. Other volcanoes in the neighbourhood are Dos Naciones, Cerro Silla, and Cerro 5074. Llullaillaco is associated with a local crustal upwarp. = The volcano = Llullaillaco is a stratovolcano which rises above the surrounding terrain. The edifice has an elliptical shape with dimensions of and has a volume of about -. It is formed by thick dacitic lava flows erupted during the Quaternary. These flows extend away from the volcano and form its summit. An older unit is formed by ignimbrites and pyroclastic flows. Older lava flows extend west from the volcano and are partly buried by sediments closer to the edifice. These flows reach lengths of and form about 70% of the surface of the volcano. The slopes of the volcano are fairly steep, with an altitude drop of over only horizontal distance. The slopes high up are steeper than those at lower altitudes. A crater at altitude was formed early in the development of the Llullaillaco volcano. Erosion has reduced it to a plateau. This crater is filled with snow and ice. The ice shows evidence of recent geothermal heating. Llullaillaco seen from space, with lava flows clearly visible. The summit of Llullaillaco is formed by a small cone with about four associated lava domes, which reach lengths of and have abrupt walls. Large dacitic coulees emanate from the summit of the volcano and are young in appearance. One extends north of the volcano and the other one south. Their overall length is and their flow fronts are up to thick. Morphologically, these flows are reddish-black aa lava flows and feature blocks with sizes of . The southern lava flow is long and was fairly viscous when it was erupted. It almost reaches a road southwest of the volcano. These flows feature levees and ridges. At first they were considered to be Holocene, but argon-argon dating indicates they are of late Pleistocene age. Some traces of glacier activity are found in the summit area. At least two stages of construction are recognized, Llullaillaco I and Llullaillaco II. The first stage originated from two centres and is now extensively degraded by glaciation and hydrothermal alteration. This applies especially to the high Azufrera Esperanto mountain north of Llullaillaco, where little original volcanic substance is preserved and where erosion has exposed deeply altered white rock. Llullaillaco II on the southern and northeastern flank is better preserved; the toes of the lava flows reach thicknesses of . Its lava flows are less extensive than the ones of Llullaillaco I. Pyroclastic flow deposits with a composition similar to Llullaillaco II are found on the southern slope of the volcano and may have formed before the lava eruptions began. Volcanism in the Central Volcanic Zone may be affected by deep-seated lineaments, which control where volcanoes and geothermal systems form. Such lineaments extend diagonally across the volcanic arc and are accompanied by volcanic manifestations at substantial distances from the arc. One of these lineaments, the Archibarca, runs beneath Llullaillaco and is also associated with the Escondida copper deposit, Corrida de Cori, Archibarca, Antofalla, and the Gal√°n caldera. Other lineaments include the Calama-El Toro. Several dry valleys originate on Llullaillaco, including Quebrada de las Zorritas on the north-northeastern slope, Quebrada El Salado and Quebrada Llullaillaco on the northwestern slope, and Quebrada La Barda on the southwestern slope. The Quebrada Llullaillaco drains into the Salar de Punta Negra northwest of the volcano. The volcano is relatively unaffected by water erosion, water is only episodically present on the mountain. In addition, there is a lake called the \\"Llullaillaco volcano lake\\" on the mountain; it is one of the highest lakes in the world. Periglacial phenomena are observed on Llullaillaco, commencing at altitude and reaching their maximum around on the Chilean and on the Argentine side. There, solifluction and cryoplanation surfaces are developed, including lobe-shaped ground and block ramparts. These landforms have been mapped on the northwestern side of the volcano. Patterned ground is also common. Permafrost is found at higher altitudes. Cryoplanation and solifluction landforms are also observed on Iris and Mitral. Other than on periglacially influenced terrain, the ground at Llullaillaco is formed mostly by lavic rocks and block debris, which are frequently buried by tephra. Two abandoned sulfur mines can be found north and south of Llullaillaco. The northern mine is known as Azufrera Esperanto and associated with an area of hydrothermal alteration. A path or road leads up to that mine from northwest. Llullaillaco Sunset.jpgLlullaillaco during sunset Parque Nacional Llullaillaco, Chile.jpgLlullailaco with a road leading to the mountain.

Llullaillaco 2.jpgLava flow from Llullaillaco Llullaillaco 1.jpgLlullaillaco in Salta = Debris avalanche = A major landslide occurred in the volcano's history during the late Pleistocene, probably triggered by volcanic activity. This landslide descended the eastern- southeastern flanks of the volcano into Argentina, first over a steep slope of 20¬∞ on the volcano, split around Cerro Rosado and entered the Salina de Llullaillaco east of the summit, extending up to into the salar. The toe of the avalanche reaches a thickness of above the salar in the avalanche's southern lobe. Part of the avalanche was channelled in a valley between Cerro Rosado and an unnamed volcano farther south. When it reached Cerro Rosado, the avalanche climbed about and mostly continued to flow southeast into the main avalanche path, with only a small flow continuing northeastwards. Part of the run-up avalanche later collapsed backwards over the main avalanche deposit. Unlike Socompa farther north, a landslide scar is only poorly developed at Llullaillaco despite the large size of the collapse; it was largely filled in later by lava flows and volcaniclastic debris. This landslide has been subdivided into four facies and features landforms like levees up to high, longitudinal ridges and a run-up mark on Cerro Rosado. Such ridges may be associated with uneven underlying terrain. The surface of the slide is covered by lava bombs less than long, blocks exceeding width, cobbles, and gravel-like rocks. Close to the collapse scarp on Llullaillaco the largest blocks with sizes of up to are found. Overall, the margins of the landslide are very crisp and the surface covered by hummocks. The landslide deposit covers a surface of about . Its volume has been estimated at and the speed at . This speed range is comparable to that of the Colima, Lastarria, and Mount St. Helens debris avalanches. The landslide occurred no later than 156,000 ‚Äì 148,000 ¬± 5,000 years ago, it might coincide with the 48,000 year old lava flow. Some volcanic rocks were still hot at the time of the collapse, indicating that volcanic activity occurred immediately before the collapse. A smaller undated avalanche occurred on the northeastern flank. Such landslides are common at volcanoes, where they are favoured by the steep edifices that form from lava flows being stacked on top of each other. It is not usually known what triggers the collapse, although eruption-associated earthquakes are suspected to play a role. Other volcanoes in the region with sector collapses are: Lastarria, Ollague, San Pedro, Socompa, and Tata Sabaya. The Mellado and Cerro Rosado volcanoes close to Llullaillaco also display evidence of sector collapses. = Basement = The terrain around Llullaillaco consists of andesite and dacite lavas and pyroclastics of Miocene to Pliocene age. Some Oligocene-Miocene layers are exposed in the Quebrada de las Zorritas. Dates obtained by argon- argon dating range between 11.94 ¬± 0.13 and 5.48 ¬± 0.07 million years ago. west of Llullaillaco do Paleozoic granites and volcanite rocks crop out. Elsewhere these layers are buried by Cenozoic rocks. There are several faults in the region, such as the Imilac-Salina del Fraile lineament whose movement has influenced the activity of Llullaillaco. = Composition = Llullaillaco has mostly erupted dacites with medium potassium content, with rocks becoming more felsic the younger they are. Rock samples taken from Llullaillaco are mostly porphyritic or vitrophyric, with a glassy or microcrystalline matrix. Phenocrysts are mostly plagioclase, with mafic phenocrysts being dominated by orthopyroxene and smaller amounts of biotite, clinopyroxene, and hornblende. Ilmenite, magnetite, and sulfide minerals are also present, magnetite especially in the more oxidized older lavas. Some phenocrysts show evidence of a complex history. Quartz is rare. Older lavas have developed a red colour and contain oxidized iron in form of hematite. Lavas from Llullaillaco I are grey. The content of is 65‚Äì67%. The rocks belong to the calc-alkaline series. Trace element data are typical for Central Volcanic Zone rocks. High potassium content is typical for shoshonite-like lavas erupted at large distance from the trenches. The composition may reflect magma differentiation in a solitary magma chamber, but with occasional replenishment with more primitive magma. Magma mixing and plagioclase crystallization occurred in it. A lithospheric structure probably directed magma flows over long time periods along the same pathway. The depth of the magma source probably varied over the history of the volcano. The total magma output at Llullaillaco is about -. = Geological history = Research by J.P. Richards and M. Villeneuve has allowed the determination of the geological history of the region. Had volcanism during the Eocene and Oligocene been centered on the Precordillera, increased subduction of the Nazca Plate during the late Oligocene caused the volcanic arc to broaden to about . 25 million years ago, the \\"Quechua event\\" triggered the uplift of the Puna-Altiplano, a highland covering a surface area of and reaching an altitude of . In the late Miocene-Pliocene a phase of strong ignimbrite volcanism occurred. About 2 million years ago, the \\"Diaguita deformation\\" was characterized by a change in the deformation regimen from crustal shortening to strike-slip faulting and of volcanism from voluminous felsic eruptions to isolated stratovolcanoes and back-arc mafic volcanism. A slowdown in the subduction may have caused this change. Nowadays most volcanism occurs at the western edge of the Puna, where volcanoes such as Lascar and Llullaillaco formed.  Climate, glaciers and biota  The climate at Llullaillaco is cold and dry. The average temperature is about , with temperature maximums ranging between summer and winter. Ground temperatures however can reach during the day in summer. The temperature of the ground fluctuates strongly during the day. The climate is extremely sunny on account of the lack of a cloud cover, the high altitude, and the close coincidence between summer solstice with the day where Earth is closest to the Sun. Snowfall can occur down to altitudes of . Precipitation is episodic to the point that it is difficult to give average values. It is most often associated with either convective or cyclonic activity during summer and winter respectively. Snow patches on Llullaillaco Small glaciers are found above altitude. Other sources contend there are no glaciers on Llullaillaco, which would make it the highest mountain in the world without one; although the existence of an ice slab on the western slope was reported in 1958. However, Llullaillaco has snow fields. high penitentes occur above altitude, especially in more sheltered areas. high penitentes were observed in 1954. Snow covers the terrain above altitude. Gullies that are found in the area probably result from meltwater runoff. The snowfields on Llullaillaco supply water to the Salar de Punta Negra. The existence of a cirque on the northwestern slope has been postulated. It was once believed that Llullaillaco had experienced three large glaciations, but the \\"moraines\\" are actually mudflow deposits. However, during the Pleistocene glaciers reached down to altitude on the northwestern slope. Lava flows have overrun some of the glaciated surfaces and it is possible that lava flows induced the melting of glaciers. A number of glacial landforms elsewhere were destroyed by mudflows during the time of Llullaillaco's last activity. Llullaillaco may not have been glaciated at all during the Pleistocene. Between 24 and 25¬∞ degrees southern latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, half of the precipitation falls in summer and the other half in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This is the reason why the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects. Vegetation is scarce in the arid climate. Vegetation at Llullaillaco begins at altitude with Acantholippia punensis, Atriplex imbricata, and Cristaria andicola. They are joined at altitude by Stipa frigida which can be found up to of altitude. The maximum vegetation density is found around with 12% of the surface and decreases thereafter, probably due to the low temperatures. At this altitude, Adesmia spinosissima, Fabiana bryoides, Mulinum crassifolium, and Parastrephia quadrangularis are found in addition to the previously mentioned plants. Above elevation there is no vegetation. Mice were filmed at 6205 metres in 2013, and an expedition in February 2020 found mice all the way to the summit, where a mouse of the species Phyllotis xanthopygus was captured. The biologists of the expedition did not determine what the mice eat, since there are no green plants at those altitudes. This is the highest altitude in the world at which a mammal has been found to live. Weakly developed fungal and bacterial communities have been found in the soils at Llullaillaco, with better developed algal and cyanobacterial communities found on the penitentes; some soil microbes may depend on volcanic carbon monoxide. The environmental conditions in these soils are among the most extreme on the planet., with aridity, strong UV radiation, daily freeze-thaw cycles and a lack of nutrients. Organic material transported on the mountain by winds may be the principal source of food for some of these microorganisms. Dry valleys and sheltered areas feature grasses. A permanent spring is found in Quebrada de las Zorritas. Deposits in this valley indicate that between 2,436.8 ¬± 49 and 1,593.1 ¬± 36 radiocarbon years ago runoff was more intense. Casualidad C 23.jpgLlullaillaco from Salar Rio Grande Salar de Aguas Calientes IV, Regi√≥n de Antofagasta.JPGLlullaillaco from Salar de Aguas Calientes IV  Archaeology  Llullaillaco was first climbed by Inkas centuries ago. In 1999, a team of archeologists, led by Johan Reinhard, found three mummies of children on the top of Llullaillaco. At the time of their death they were six, seven, and fifteen years old. They were ostensibly human sacrifices offered to the gods of the Incan pantheon on mountaintops. In 2003 they were at the Catholic University of Salta, but starting from 2007 they can be found at the Museum of High Altitude Archaeology of Argentina. The mummies were found buried beneath a large platform. The existence of ruins in the summit area had been reported during the first climb of the volcano in 1950. Because of the findings, the summit area of the volcano in 2001 was classified as a ' by the government of Argentina. Other archeological objects found along with the mummies included: headdresses with feathers, pottery, statues made out of gold and silver and textiles. A total of 145 objects were found together with the mummies. The hairs found with the mummies and as offerings accompanying the mummies have been subject of research to establish the background of the victims. Archeological site at the top of Llullaillaco At least three paths lead up to Llullaillaco. Two of them meet at a tambo or inn at an altitude of , while the third passes through a cementerio (cemetery) where 16 bodies were found in 1972 before reaching the tambo. From the tambo another path leads up the mountain, past two further archeological sites to of altitude. At this altitude the path is marked by cairns, probably to indicate where the path is when the volcano is covered by snow. The path ends at altitude at the Portezuelo del Inca ruins, where a staircase begins. From these ruins one path goes to a cemetery at altitude and another to the summit platform. The other path reaches two subrectangular walls farther up, and continues to the platform where the mummies were found. These are the highest archeological sites in the world. The paths were discovered by Mathias Rebitsch in 1958. Llullaillaco appears to have been the most important Inca sacred mountain in the region. Archeological sites are also found in the valleys that drain Llullaillaco towards the Salar de Punta Negra, including the Quebrada Llullaillaco and the Quebrada de las Zorritas. The paths connect with the major north-south axis that runs between San Pedro de Atacama and Copiapo. This axis is associated with the extensive Inca road system.  Eruptive history  The volcano is about 1.45 ¬± 0.41 million years old, and Llullaillaco I is of early Pleistocene age. The oldest date, 1.5 ¬± 0.4 million years ago, was determined on a lava flow northwest of Llullaillaco's main edifice. Two dates obtained on lava flows of Llullaillaco II are 401,000 ¬± 6,000 and 1,500,000 ¬± 400,000 years ago, based on argon-argon dating and potassium-argon dating respectively. The northern young lava flow is less than one million years old based on potassium-argon dating, the southern flow is 48,000 ¬± 12,000 years old based on argon-argon dating on biotite. Surface exposure dating based on helium has yielded ages of 41,000 ¬± 1,000 years for Llullaillaco I at over altitude and of 5,600 ¬± 250 years for Llullaillaco II at an altitude of over . Llullaillaco has been active in historical time, with the last eruption occurring in the late 19th century. Eruptions were recorded in February 1854, September 1868, and May 1877, involving two explosive eruptions and one with lava flows. According to a report in 1899, during the 1868 eruption large fissures opened on its slopes. The last eruption consisted of smoking reported at the time of the 1877 Iquique earthquake. The volcano is currently considered dormant and there are no known fumaroles. Future eruptive activity may cause sector collapses, although they would be a small danger to human life, given that the area is sparsely inhabited.

R. (1962). \\"Principles of the self-organizing system\\", pp. 255‚Äì278 in Principles of Self- Organization. Heinz von Foerster and George W. Zopf, Jr. (eds.) U.S. Office of Naval Research. It states that any deterministic dynamic system automatically evolves towards a state of equilibrium that can be described in terms of an attractor in a basin of surrounding states. Once there, the further evolution of the system is constrained to remain in the attractor. This constraint implies a form of mutual dependency or coordination between its constituent components or subsystems. In Ashby's terms, each subsystem has adapted to the environment formed by all other subsystems. The cybernetician Heinz von Foerster formulated the principle of \\"order from noise\\" in 1960.Von Foerster, H. (1960). \\"On self-organizing systems and their environments\\", pp. 31‚Äì50 in Self-organizing systems. M.C. Yovits and S. Cameron (eds.), Pergamon Press, London It notes that self-organization is facilitated by random perturbations (\\"noise\\") that let the system explore a variety of states in its state space. This increases the chance that the system will arrive into the basin of a \\"strong\\" or \\"deep\\" attractor, from which it then quickly enters the attractor itself. The biophysicist Henri Atlan developed such a concept by proposing the principle of \\"complexity from noise\\"See occurrences on Google Books.

Warren McCulloch proposed \\"Redundancy of Potential Command\\"Embodiments of Mind MIT Press (1965)\\" as characteristic of the organization of the brain and human nervous system and the necessary condition for self-organization. Heinz von Foerster proposed Redundancy, R = 1 ‚àí H/Hmax, where H is entropy. In essence this states that unused potential communication bandwidth is a measure of self-organization. In the 1970s Stafford Beer considered this condition as necessary for autonomy which identifies self-organization in persisting and living systems. He applied his viable system model to management. It consists of five parts: the monitoring of performance of the survival processes (1), their management by recursive application of regulation (2), homeostatic operational control (3) and development (4) which produce maintenance of identity (5) under environmental perturbation. Focus is prioritized by an alerting \\"algedonic loop\\" feedback: a sensitivity to both pain and pleasure produced from under-performance or over-performance relative to a standard capability.\\"Brain of the Firm\\" Alan Lane (1972) see also \\"Beyond Dispute,\\" Wiley, Stafford Beer 1994 \\"Redundancy of Potential Command\\" pp. 157‚Äì158.

His strict definition of concept \\"a procedure to bring about a relation\\"Pask, G. (1973). Conversation, Cognition and Learning. A Cybernetic Theory and Methodology.

His edict, an exclusion principle, \\"There are No Doppelgangers\\"Pask, Gordon (1993) Interactions of Actors (IA), Theory and Some Applications. means no two concepts can be the same (all interactions occur with different perspectives making time incommensurable for actors). This means, after sufficient duration as differences assert, all concepts will attract and coalesce as pink noise and entropy increases (and see Big Crunch, self-organized criticality). The theory is applicable to all organizationally closed or homeostatic processes that produce enduring and coherent products (where spins have a fixed average phase relationship and also in the sense of Nicholas Rescher's coherence theory of truth with the proviso that the sets and their members exert repulsive forces at their boundaries) through interactions: evolving, learning and adapting. Pask's Interactions of Actors \\"hard carapace\\" model is reflected in some of the ideas of emergence and coherence. It requires a knot emergence topology that produces radiation during interaction with a unit cell that has a prismatic tensegrity structure. Laughlin's contribution to emergence reflects some of these constraints.

While virtuous Mrs Pett looks after the home and tends to her children, decadent Mrs Pott prefers to idle in her chair reading a saucy book. Cavalcanti had established a name for himself making avant-garde films in the 1930s. and managed to smuggle a number of sound and visual experiments into a rather light storyline. The first 'experimental' sequence occurs when we see Mr Pett (a solicitor) and Mr Pott (a debt collector) on the train with other businessmen dressed in identical suits and bowler hats. A close-up of a newspaper headline 'Another Suburban Burglary', is followed by a cut to a woman awaking in her bed screaming ‚Äì her scream merging with the noise of a train going through a tunnel. Back in suburbia, Mrs Pett is seen using the house's telephone for transactions and personal calls. Mrs Pott prefers to invest her money in a maid and in another experimental sequence Mrs Pott is seen becoming a slave to her own maid. As she trudges up steps with heavy shopping, the calendar flicks through the days, while the same image is shown over a monotonous drum beat. The maid invites a friend round and the two of them begin to steal from the Potts' household. The noises they make alert the Petts' daughter, who uses the telephone to call the police. In court the Potts are condemned for their decadent behaviour, whilst the Petts - and the telephone - are praised. Viewed in retrospect, the film has been described as 'radical fun', rather like Un Chien Andalou reworked by Gilbert and Sullivan. Cast * J. M.

Biography Krstiƒçeviƒá was born on July 1, 1969 in Vrgorac, Split-Dalmatia County in SFR Yugoslavia. Since his childhood, he knew he wanted to be a soldier. He finished military high school in Sarajevo. Upon graduating from the Military Academy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia broke up. He joined the Croatian National Guard in the summer of 1991. He was assigned to the 4th Guards Brigade where he eventually rose to the position of the brigade's commander. After the war, in 1997, he was sent to continue his education at United States Army War College, and finished with excellent grades. In 2000 he was one of the signatories of the Twelve Generals' Letter, which resulted in Krstiƒçeviƒá's retiring by then Croatian president Stjepan Mesiƒá. He then worked as a manager, ceo, procurator and member of the supervisory board in computer software developing companies M SAN and King ICT.

Ethnic Jew, he was born in Aleksandrovka, Slavyanoserbsk County, Yekaterinoslav Governorate (now Oleksandrivsk, Luhansk Oblast) as Yosyp Abramovych. In 1909 Yosyp turned to Orthodox Christianity and was baptised in the Russian Orthodox Church as Mykhailo. His patronymic and surname he took from personal name and surname of his godfather. Before his religious conversion, in 1905‚Äì1908 Mykhailyk was a Russian Menshevik. In 1916 Mykhailyk graduated the Jurist faculty (predecessor of the Kharkiv Law Institute) of the Kharkiv University. After school in 1916‚Äì1917 he served in the Russian Imperial Army. In 1918 Mykhailyk worked in the Ministry of Land Melioration of the Ukrainian State. During that time he was a member of the left-wing Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries (before adaptation of Communist- Borotbists). Soon after the second occupation of Kyiv by the Soviet troops following the Battle of Kiev, in April 1919 Mykhailyk joined Bolsheviks and the Kiev Revolutionary Committee.

It stands on a hill at approximately 200 metres above sea level, overlooking the Gulf of Hammamet, Hergla and Sousse to the east, Djebel Zaghouan to the north, and the Kairouan plain to the south.  History  The name Takrouna is believed to have originated from a tribe that immigrated to Andalusia in the 8th century. Following the expulsion of the Moors in 1609, the descendants of these immigrants settled on the hill that the village now occupies. Takrouna was the site of the last major action by New Zealand troops in North Africa during World War II, before the surrender of Italy and Germany. Following the Battle of the Mareth Line (16-31 March 1943), Axis forces were driven back into Tunisia. On 19 April New Zealand forces prepared for an assault on Takrouna, then held by one Italian battalion and one German platoon. At dawn on 20 April, Lance-sergeant Haane Te Rauawa Manahi led a platoon on an attack up the hill, and successfully overran the Italian defenses. Manahi then left to locate reinforcements, returning with a section of C Company and another platoon, successfully resisting an Axis counterattack. Manahi and his section descended from the hill, but despite the reinforcements the New Zealand forces lost the hill to a second Axis counterattack on 21 April. Manahi returned in the afternoon and, with artillery support, retook first the ledge and then the village on the summit, taking 300 prisoners. Over 550 New Zealanders lost their lives in the battle.  Demographics  Six families of Berber origin live in the village with one family of Andalusian descent.  Economy  The inhabitants practice agriculture and weaving of alfa and Berber carpets  Popular culture  Takrouna was the location of the film Sabra and the Monster from the Forest by Habib Mselmani.

The song were composed by Anil Johnson.Indajith Sshivada Song Plot Both Mustafa (Biju Menon) and Vimal (Indrajith Sukumaran) are convicts who escaped during transport from Peermade to Ernakulam. Musthafa and Vimal are handcuffed together. Musthafa is a petty thief convicted of stealing a watch from a mall while Vimal is arrested for a murder he did not commit. Vimal asks Musthafa to help him to find the real killer whom he suspects, in exchange for 3 lakhs. They move through the forest and encounter wild creatures. Vimal tells Musthafa his story. Vimal is rich. He and Shalini (Sshivada), who is hearing- impaired, fall in love with each other and get engaged with each other. One rainy night, after reaching her Aunt's home, Shalini calls Vimal for help because somebody enters the house. Even though Vimal reaches the house, he is unable to save Shalini from falling from the terrace. Shalini dies and Vimal is framed for her murder. The only mark on the real murderer is that Shalini stabbed the real killer. Then it is revealed that it was actually Musthafa who is the real killer. Musthafa stole the watch and put it into Shalini's bag at the Shopping mall as police find him. At night Musthafa goes to take the watch from her house but Shalini sees him and thinks that he is a rapist and accidentally falls from the terrace. Finally, Vimal knows that it was Mustafa who was responsible for Shalini's death. Mustafa admits that it was an accident and saves Vimal from police by admitting his role and goes to jail.

The cave is under a building located where the Church of San Gin√©s, Toledo stood until 1841.  History  The structure was likely constructed in the time of the Roman Empire, probably towards the second half of the 1st century. It appears to have been a water reservoir supplied via the aqueduct bridge which brought water across the River Tagus. It is located in the east corner of the current courtyard and was built in two construction phases. It was covered with a barrel vault, realized in ashlar, and displayed the aspect of a great tank to the open sky, with an overflow at the edge. The first half of the wall, made in Roman concrete and covered with opus signinum, is preserved, and overlooks San Gin√©s alley. The structure was deeply altered with the construction of an arcade of three arches of ashlars in the southwest side. This divides the primitive one in two and currently separates it from the other half of the deposit, belonging to No. 2 of San Gin√©s street. It is unknown whether this change occurred in the first or second phase of construction. The second half of the northeast wall that faces the street was constructed in the second Roman phase. A facade was built in opus quadratum of seven rows of ashlars of varying size, which is attached to the northeast lateral wall of the hydraulic structure of the first phase. The size was increased from the northwest to the southeast by creating a new line of orientation to the wall, which is the one that generates the trapezoidal plant that will have the nave. In this space, different rupture interfaces are observed along the entire surface. In the Visigothic era, it is probable that there was a Visigothic church on the property. In the Al-Andalus period, constructions were developed, probably a mosque, in whose walls were embedded Visigothic reliefs. This mosque followed a structure similar to others of the city, being a small oratory with practically square plant, four interior columns and nine vaults or domes. The first references to this property as the church of San Gin√©s come from 1148. At the end of this Late medieval epoch, or the beginning of the Early modern age, a series of changes were made, such as the creation of five individual chapels. The building deteriorated during a prolonged period of the Early modern era. Abandoned and closed to the public during the 18th century, the church was demolished in 1841. The wall of the entrance, where several Visigothic reliefs are embedded, was partially preserved, as were the remains of the sacristy. The lot, including the vaults beneath, was put up for sale and was parceled out among several neighbors.

It carries out development programs for working boys and for their families. Its stated aim is to give working children help to work out of their situation of extreme poverty and to gain control of their own lives, and to do this by providing education for them and for their families, together with meals, health services, housing assistance, loans to start up microbusinesses, and cultural enhancement.  History  In 1964 the Worker Boys' Center began with 200 shoeshine and street worker boys in the attic of La Iglesia Church in the old centre of Quito. Early primary education was given, along with three daily meals and healthcare. Boys were trained in carpentry and shoemaking. In 1974, a headquarters was set up at La Marin. Working children's families were included in a comprehensive training program, adding adult education and various technical skills. In 1981 the opening of Worker Boy #2 in northwest Quito (Cotocollao) resulted in the extension of services to 400 families. In 1984 the Craft Defense Board and the Ministry of Education gave official recognition to the technical education workshops. A clinic was later added to health services and health promoters were trained. Marketing was taught in a business school joined to the workshops. A training program for microentrepreneurs was launched and loans made available. In 2002, the \\"Drop of Milk\\" program in product donation led to the CMT Milk Drop Society. The Office of Development subsequently changed the focus of the CMT to systematize its activities and to add a human development proposal. In 2015 the President of Ecuador Rafael Correa speaking at the Center acknowledged its help in reducing child labor over the past eight years from over 16% to under 3%.  Education  Primary education for working children and a program for children with disabilities are offered. Technical education, extending to adults, involves training and internships in workshops while students study the specialties of automotive and industrial mechanic, carpentry and furniture, plumbing, beauty salon, sewing, restaurant, and bakery. Adult Training also offers completion of a primary diploma. Technical High School with IRFEYAL is also available for those who wish to continue their studies.El Telegrafo on urban entrepreneurs.

Origin  He was from a side-branch of the Stuart family, descended from the Scottish King Robert II. He was the seventh son of John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute and his wife Charlotte Jane. He received the courtesy title Lord Stuart after his father became the first Marquess of Bute in 1796. Among his brothers were Charles Stuart, who died in 1796 aboard HMS Leda and Captain William Stuart RN.  Life  After attending Eton College, he joined the Royal Navy in November 1793 as a midshipman. In 1795 he took part in the second voyage of under Captain William Robert Broughton, during which they went in search of George Vancouver to the Pacific coast of North America and later to Japan and Macau. After the wreck of HMS Providence on a coral reef at Miyako-jima, Stuart and 29 seamen finally returned to Great Britain on board an East Indiaman in 1799. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1800 and commander in 1802. On 3 March 1804 he was appointed captain and took command of 44-gun frigate HMS Sheerness in the Indian Ocean; he was not aboard Sheerness when she sank in a heavy storm off Trincomalee on 7 January 1805. On 8 April 1806 as commander of the frigate HMS Duncan he captured the French privateer √éle de France in the North Sea.

In the summer of 1808 l'Aimable escorted General Wellesley's army from Cork to Portugal. On 3 February 1809 he captured the French frigate Iris after a 28-hour pursuit in the North Sea. In July 1809 he assumed command of a light squadron at the mouth of the Elbe and on 7 July, a landing party destroyed French coastal batteries nearby and occupied the city for a short time. On 29 July, the French occupied the town of Geestendorf, on the Weser from Cuxhaven. Learning of this Captain Stuart decided to march cross-country and attack the town. He succeeded in this and re-took it. A few days later Duke Friedrich- Wilhelm of Braunschweig-Oel and his army arrived on the opposite bank of the Weser and, because the fortress at Geestendorf had been destroyed was able to embark there and escape destruction. In November 1810, Stuart became commander of the frigate HMS Horatio, he occupied the Dutch Zierikzee in December 1813 and expelled the French forces from the island of Schouwen.

Su√°rez de Urbina. Fernando Bol√≠var -Ferbo Ligali- is a pioneer in studies on the bio-deterioration of cultural goods.  Biography  In the 1980s, he became a part of the ADENA-WWF management in Granada, acting for several years as a monitor for a camp founded by F√©lix Rodr√≠guez de la Fuente in the province of Segovia, and simultaneously started his studies in Fine Arts and Biology at the University of Granada. In 1991, the Ministry of Education and Science gave him a scholarship to specialize in bio-deterioration at the pioneering laboratory of the institution located in Rome, ICR (Istituto Centrale per il Restuaro), where he collaborated in research into the restoration of the Coliseum and the Trevi Fountain. After completing the investigations, he received the first scholarship for research for the first year of graduates in this subject from the Faculty of Fine Arts, for which he wrote the first Spanish thesis on the bio-deterioration of cultural assets. He obtained a doctorate in 1994 for descriptive, analytical and experimental studies on photosynthetic organisms in the Nasrid Palaces of the Alhambra. The thesis highlights the significance of microalgae in the conservation of Spain's most visited monument for the first time. He is currently an Arts professor at the University of Granada (the only one trained to teach all the subjects of Art, Restoration and Biology). Under his pseudonym Ferbo Ligali, he also carries out his work as a visual artist, creating paintings, sculptures, graphic work and installations in which he constructs a fusion of science and art. He was a pioneer in the defense of the rights of children affected by divorce, and co-founded the DEHISE association. He is currently the president of the Defense of Effective Equality and Justice association and is associated with the Federation for the Defense of Effective Equality. He is currently the creator of the cultural movement \\"Ligalismo\\" as part of an artistic-scientific trend.  Arts and Science in his Work  The search for scientific applications for art and artistic responses for science has been central to his education and subsequent specialized works. This concern for the symbiosis between art and the humanities/sciences, typical of the Renaissance yet still valid today, has been a characteristic since his career began in all of his research, teaching, professional and management activities, which are very useful in managing teams that require integration of two fields that are supposedly so different. 1\\\\. Studies on the conservation and restoration of monuments, painting with an easel and textiles: Especially concerning the Alhambra as regards the bio-deterioration of hydraulic architecture, for example the monumental fountains, with diagnosis and treatment of bio-deterioration using biological agents (bacteria, vascular plants, algae, fungi, insects and vertebrates). 2\\\\. Artistic creations: Mainly pictorial, sculptural or illustrations and photographs. = Teaching and professional activity = He started teaching in 1991, giving practical introductory classes on procedures in the Department of Art of Granada. In 1992 he became responsible for introducing restoration and later subjects related to the restoration of textiles, being the only lecturer in this subject in Spain. This included deterioration agents, conservation problems, deterioration factors, exhibition designs and other matters related to pictorial production such as painting and figuration, art and the natural environment, pictorial techniques and technology, painting and representation: the natural environment, etc. Furthermore, in order to provide Fine Arts students with the scientific bases to study bio-deterioration and artistic techniques, he created elective courses, specifically: \\"Basic Biology applied to Artistic Techniques and Restoration\\" and \\"Bio-deterioration and Restoration: Organic Materials\\". His interest in teaching has led him to participate in the Teaching Innovation Project, in which he has attempted to facilitate and update the teaching of restoration, bio- deterioration, painting and scientific enlightenment. Thus, he participates in activities involved in adapting existing studies to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). He is the director and founder of the BIO-ARTE class (Granada Artists for Nature, 2006) at the Faculty of Fine Arts, which has a specialized illustration and \\"Wildlife Art\\" workshop in the Albayzin district, where he organizes various activities such as field trips, painting contests and awards, and exhibitions by students. He also organizes various activities such as workshops in the Science Park, book illustrations, websites, DVDs, exhibitions and training courses on painting and illustration of nature; and has been the Classroom Musical director at the Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts since 2005; and lab director for bio-deterioration. = Artistic Activity = In 1989 he had his first exhibition and since then he has participated and organized numerous individual and collective multidisciplinary exhibitions that have appeared in the local and national media, on television, radio, printed and digital media and the social networks, demonstrating the innovation and transcendence of his proposals in both artistic and scientific forums. His best-known works are based on the use of live algae, developing an algal paint from ground, bonded microalgae with synthetic polymers, and on the other hand living pictures by cultivating microalgae between crystals. The \\"living pictures\\" are solid pictorial works in algae that has been isolated and framed between two panes of glass, some with small openings that allow air to pass through, evolving in composition and color in relation to the microorganisms that form them. He also has unique works created specifically to be viewed with 3D glasses, as well as made-to-order, personally designed chess sets.  The Cabinet as a Museum  His exhibition \\"The strange Cabinet of Prof. Bolivar-Galiano\\", borne out of his particular combination of science and art, has allowed him to regain the use of cabinets as museums. The idea not to exhibit this work in galleries or conventional museums but rather in the places that inspired them, as in the case of \\"Art and Science\\" located at the Faculty in Granada, has enabled the creation a new concept of museum space where the exhibition was moved. Bol√≠var Galiano, this time under the artistic pseudonym Ferbo Ligali, proposes a return to the way of exhibiting before the dissociation of museums, when they were still called Cabinets of Curiosities or Halls of Marvels, and which subsequently became known as museums of natural history and natural sciences on the one hand and fine art galleries on the other. This drove him to the need to recreate the lighting and aesthetic environments for these unique spaces that attracted attention among both those knowledgeable in letters and those in sciences. In this way and using his experience in mounting exhibitions, he created the Ferbo Ligali Cabinet- Museum, a space where besides acting as a cabinet, it also acts a museum where science and art come together in a corner of Granada where nature, beauty and science coexist in a space that allows for different cultural activities such as lectures, courses, workshops, seminars, film forums, photo forums, filming for television, concerts, theatre, etc., with room for all the artistic, scientific and philosophical disciplines too. He recently installed a cabinet in the lobby of the Higher Royal Musical Conservatory's Auditorium in Granada as part of the Musik = Art = Science exhibition, which artistically demonstrates the relationship between science and music.

A notorious womaniser, another more damning quote was ‚Äúthe acts of his whoredom are written in the parish chronicles of Scotland‚Äù. He had at least 67 illegitimate children. Life He was born on 7 February 1751 the fourth son of Marion Lauder of Huntly Wood and her husband, George Innes of Stow. His father was second cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland later becoming Cashier (the then equivalent of Chief Executive of the bank). He was the great grandson of John Lauder, Lord Fountainhall.Grants Old and New Edinburgh vol.I p.59 Innes studied at the University of Edinburgh but did not graduate. By the time of his father‚Äôs death in 1780, Innes was the sole surviving son, and inherited the family estate of Stow, near Lauder in the Scottish Borders. In 1787 Gilbert became a Director of the Royal Bank of Scotland. He helped the Bank survive the financial crises of 1793 and 1797. In 1793 Innes was one of the jury on the trial of Thomas Muir of Huntershill on the charge of sedition (campaigning for parliamentary reform).The Reformers Gazette 1832 In 1800 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

On his death, his fortune of over ¬£1million was left to his sister Jane Innes. It was the largest ever inheritance in Scotland at that time and equates to around ¬£80 million in modern terms. When his sister died childless and without a will in 1839 a scramble for the fortune began amongst his numerous illegitimate children. The bulk of his estate ultimately passed to his nephew (a second sister‚Äôs son) William Mitchell cashier (Chief Executive) of the Royal Bank of Scotland 1814 to 1825 who thereafter was known as William Mitchell-Innes.

History There have been two churches on the site, the first of whose construction was funded by the K√∏benhavns Kirkefond (Copenhagen Church Fund), which also bought the land later used for it in the late 19th century. That land was made available to Nathanael's Church so that it could split part of its parish off to form a new one, since the original parish was becoming too large to manage. Thomas Havning (1891‚Äì1976) was commissioned to design the new building and he proposed an underground crypt church, whose foundation stone was laid in 1924, costing a total of 122,000 kroner. The first building caused some anxiety, since it only rose a few metres above the ground and lay in an open field. Rapidly encroached upon by tall apartment blocks all around it, the church's congregation commissioned Havning again to build a full building with 550 seats and costing 280,000 kroner. This was consecrated on 25 September 1932. It soon became involved in the Oxford Group, prevalent up until 1940. The church was fully renovated in 1977 and 1978, whilst its most notable priest was the hymn writer Hans Anker J√∏rgensen (1976‚Äì1979). It is now used for meetings by a Filipino congregation.

Her father may have been Charles Lamoureux. She began to study the pianoforte at the age of four, receiving her first instruction from her father, who for 40 years was a violoncello-player in the Conservatoire de Paris and Grand Opera orchestras. In 1868, she was accepted by Auber as a student at the Conservatoire without any preliminary examination. At this institution, she gained the first prize for piano playing under Henri Herz‚Äôs guidance, and afterwards studied with Stephen Heller. Career Upon completing her studies, Marx undertook a series of concert tours through France and Belgium, everywhere meeting with a cordial reception. At Brussels, she met Pablo de Sarasate, who, recognizing her great talent, engaged her as soloist and accompanist, in which capacities she accompanied him on his tours through Europe, Mexico, and the US; she played in all in about 600 concerts. She composed several \\"Rhapsodies Espagnoles,\\" and arranged Sarasate's Spanish dances for the piano. Around 1894, she married Otto Goldschmidt, Sarasate's friend, accompanist, and manager. Marx accomplished some large memorizing feats in the course of her career. Perhaps the greatest occurred in 1894, when she played about 250 works by heart, during a series of concerts in Berlin and Paris. She died in 1925. References =Bibliography= *Ehrlich, A. .

Morphology The body of the fish is medium- high, very compressed laterally. Seen from profile it resemblances an ellipse. The mouth is terminal, very small, with non-protrusive jaws. The base color of the head, the upper half of the body and the fins are pale blue, except for the dorsal and caudal fins, which are yellow. The lower half of the body and the belly are whitish-silvered. The head has a diagonal brown strip that crosses the eye, from the nape of the neck to the chin. Another diagonal brown stripe extends from the base of the 4th or 5th spine to the base of the pectoral fins. Both the head and upper half of the body are decorated with fine spots and yellow and irregular stripes. The central part of the body is a pinkish hue, and the later part of the back is yellow. It is distinguished from its relative S. doliatus, in which the whole body is covered with vertical stripes, more or less parallel, and does not have the base of the yellow dorsal radius.

The remains of the first human inhabitants of Brazil were found in the park area in the early 19th century, along with bones of now-extinct megafauna. The main attraction is the Gruta da Lapinha, a large limestone cave. Location The Sumidouro State Park is in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa (56%) and Pedro Leopoldo (44%) to the north of the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. It is from Belo Horizonte. The park is in the federal Carste de Lagoa Santa Environmental Protection Area. It has an area of . The unit was named after its lagoon, Sumidouro (\\"sink\\"). The lagoon is drained by a network of galleries through which the water penetrates underground into the limestone basin. History Lagoa Santa skulls collected by Peter Wilhelm Lund The Danish naturalist Peter Wilhelm Lund conducted research in the area now covered by the park in the first half of the 19th century. He found remains of Lagoa Santa Man, the first inhabitants of Brazil, along with extinct megafauna. This coexistence of man with extinct species was quoted by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species. The skeleton of \\"Luzia\\" found in Lagoa Santa in the 1970s was dated to 11,500 years ago, changing views of when the continent had been occupied. There are traces of stone age people who lived outside the caves in what may be the oldest open-air site of paleoindians. The Sumidouro State Park was created by state governor Francelino Pereira by decree 20.375 of 3 January 1980. It was originally called the Ecological Park of the Sumidouro Valley (). Little was done to implement the park until 2006, when environmental compensation funding became available from the green line between Belo Horizonte and the Tancredo Neves International Airport in Confins. In October 2007 it was reported that the Sumidouro State Park was in the final stages of implementation, and since August 2007 had a temporary headquarters at the Casa Fern√£o Dias. The State Forest Institute (IEF) was to acquire by the end of the year and start construction of a visitor center, house for the manager and administrative structure, and the goal was to complete implementation by the end of 2008. The IEF was also registering owners living in the park and checking their documentation so that compensation for expropriation could be calculated. The consultative council held its first meeting in October 2007 after an inauguration ceremony in the Gruta da Lapinha attended by councilors and representatives of the local community. Decree 44.935 of 3 November 2008 expanded the area of the park. Law 19.998 of 29 December 2011 defined the boundaries. It is a fully protected conservation unit with the objectives of promoting preservation of the environment and cultural heritage, while supporting research, conservation, environmental education and tourism. A study published in 2013 indicated that the local people were dissatisfied with the way the park was being managed. Residents said they had not been consulted in the park creation process, did not see the need for so many rules, and if they had more information could help maintain the natural heritage while enjoying it as in the past. Environment Tree growing on a cliff in the park The park is in an area of carbonate rock formations, with springs, sink holes and caves rich in speleothems. The climate is tropical humid, with rainy summers when there are periods of flooding and dry winters. The flora includes species from the cerrado and Atlantic Forest biomes. Vegetation includes gallery forest, cerrado and rocky meadows. Flora include ip√™-amarelo, ip√™- roxo, moreira, aroeirinha, jatob√°-do-campo, gabiroba, manjoba, mutamba and faveiro. The park is in the transition zone from cerrado to Atlantic Forest, and also has dry forest. Trees with heights of predominate in the cerrado, in the northeast and east regions of the Sumidouro lagoon. These include pequi, pau-terra, cagaita, tingui and sucupira. Deciduous trees predominate in limestone areas, reaching about in height. These include aroeira, gameleira, angico, cedro, catigu√°, embiru√ßu, paineira and maria-pobre. There are also species typical of the caatinga such as cactos mandacaru and figo-da-barb√°ria, and shrubs such as pimentinha-do-mato. Around the Gruta da Lapinha the predominant trees are semi-deciduous, losing about half their leaves in the dry season, and growing to . These include angico-vermelho, angico-branco, jequitib√°-branco and paineira. The original forest has been damaged by man, causing impoverishment of the soil and invasion of cerrado species. The park's management plan includes restoration of some of the areas. There 13 species of mammals including marsupials and rodents and 13 species of bats. There is a large bat population due to the many caves in the park area. Fauna include jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira), tayra (Eira barbara), coatis, crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), black-tufted marmoset (Callithrix penicillata), gray four-eyed opossum (Philander opossum), opossums, Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), South American water rat (Nectomys squamipes), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) pacas, common agoutis, Brazilian guinea pig (Cavia aperea) and tapeti (Sylvilagus brasiliensis). Amphibians include pererequinha-de-banheiro, r√£zinha, r√£-cachorro, r√£-manteiga, r√£-assobiadeira, sapo-cururu, sapo- cururuzinho and sapo-boror√≥. 132 species of birds have been recorded. These include pied-billed grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus), snowy egret (Egretta thula), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), southern lapwing (Vanellus chilensis), whistling heron (Syrigma sibilatrix), black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Facilities Sumidouro Lake The park has two visitor bases, one with the Peter Lund Museum and the Gruta de Lapinha, and the other with the Casa Fern√£o Dias. There is accommodation for researchers and a research center. There are entrance fees for the museum, trails and the cave, which can only be visited when accompanied by a registered guide. The park is busiest in July and August. The visitor center has restrooms and a snack bar. Lagoa Santa also has eating places, shops and hotels. All visits must be scheduled and accompanied by a guide. There are rock faces from height near the Peter Lund Museum that may be scaled by experienced climbers who bring their own equipment. =Exhibitions= The Peter Lund Museum was inaugurated on 21 September 2012. It has an exhibition area with 80 fossils from the Natural History Museum of Denmark. There is an area with exhibits that explain the historical and cultural importance of the Lagoa Santa karst. There is also a multi-purpose room and two rooms with exhibits on the park and the speleological management plans. The Casa Fern√£o Dias is outside the park proper, in the Quinta do Sumidouro district of Pedro Leopoldo. It is listed by the State Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IEPHA) as a cultural heritage monument. The exhibits tell the history of Fern√£o Dias, a bandeirante who spent several years in the region with his followers in search of gold and precious stones. The house contains an annex where administrative staff work. =Gruta da Lapinha= The Gruta da Lapinha is a cave within a limestone massif formed around 600 million years ago in the bed of the sea that once covered the whole region. The great hall created where the limestone has dissolved is long and deep. It contains beautiful speleothems, which are illuminated by light- emitting diodes (LEDs) to avoid generating too much heat. =Trails= Trail through vegetation typical of the park The trails can only be visited on weekends. During the rainy season in November and December the trails may be closed depending on weather conditions. The Lapinha circuit is a 40‚Äì60 minute interpretive trail that begins at the entrance of the Gruta da Lapinha and leads along the side of the limestone massif. The trail lets visitors see features of the karst relief and typical cerrado flora. It passes through the Macumba cave, which shows aspects of geological and climatic changes in the region. The trail is easy to medium difficulty, with some stairs and slight inclines. It must be scheduled in advance. The 90-minute Sumidouro trail starts at the Casa Fern√£o Dias and passes through the historical landmark \\"Cruz do Pai Man√©\\". It leads to the Sumidouro lagoon gazebo, which gives a view of the surrounding region, and then to the Gruta do Sumidouro (Sumidouro Ccave), which has cave paintings thousands of years old. The Gruta do Sumidouro is where Peter Lund found human bones mingled with bones of extinct megafauna, and removed about 30 skulls of \\"Lagoa Santa Man\\". The trail returns to the Casa Fern√£o Dias along the edge of the Sumidouro lake. The trail is medium difficult and must be scheduled in advance. The 3 hours and 30 minutes Travessia trail starts from the Gruta da Lapinha and crosses the park to the Sumidouro lake. Some stretches are through forest and others across open meadows, and some climbing is involved. Along the trail there are panoramic views of the region and points of interest such as the Cruzeiro Hist√≥rico, the Vinh√°tico, the Sumidouro lookout point and the Sumidouro cave with its rock paintings. The trail is medium difficult and must be scheduled in advance.

It began with 1987's Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei, which is based on Aya Nishitani's novel of the same name, and has spawned a sequel and several sub-series, such as the Persona and Devil Summoner series. The original Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei games and the Shin Megami Tensei sub-series form the core of the series, while other entries are considered spin-offs. Early games have received infrequent releases outside Japan: the first title to be released in North America was 1995's Jack Bros., and the first Megami Tensei RPG released in the region was 1996's Revelations: Persona. The first game released in the PAL region was 2003's Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne, which was released there in 2005. The series has several recurring themes, including demon-summoning, Japanese folklore, and the occult. Despite its thematic roots in Japanese culture and mythology, it has found a cult following internationally. It is Atlus's flagship role-playing game series, and one of the biggest in the genre in Japan. Several other types of media based on the series have been made, including anime and manga.

On May 12, 2020, the AIFC established the Advisory Council on the Development of Legal Technology, which comprises experts from the UK, US, Netherlands, Kazakhstan, Russia, China, Singapore, and Switzerland. The main goal of the Council is to create a vibrant and sustainable legal technology ecosystem that can improve the efficiency and quality of legal services and make them more accessible. Partnerships The AIFC signed an agreement with London-based global communications company OneWeb in January 2020 to accelerate broadband connectivity in Kazakhstan. The partnership was established as part of the Digital Kazakhstan program to promote digitization in the country. The agreement stipulated that OneWeb would engage local telecom operators among its distribution partners to provide universal, high-speed, fibre-like broadband connectivity across the private and public sector, including businesses, schools, hospitals and civil services. Other initiatives The AIFC creates competence centres at Kazakhstan‚Äôs major universities to improve investment literacy and help students develop skills in finance, investment and other industries. Eight platforms have already been established at Almaty universities.

Built in the 1840s, it is a well- preserved example of a Greek Revival district school building. It served as a school until 1946, aided by modernization steps taken in the early 20th century to maintain state standards. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Cobb School Description and history The former Cobb School building stands in a rural area of central northern Hardwick, on a wooded lot at the west side of the junction of Cobb School and Bridgman Hill Roads. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and a foundation of large granite slabs. A square open belfry rises from the center of the roof ridge, capped by a pyramidal roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with outer bays housing small fixed- pane square windows, and the centered entrance flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a hood with large plain angled brackets. The building corners have simple pilasters, which rise to an entablature on the sides. The north side entablature is interrupted by a bank of windows, an early 1900s alteration. The building interior has been converted to residential use. with The Cobb School was built to serve Hardwick's District Four in the 1840s. It was built on land donated by John Cobb, to whom school-designated land had been leased by the town as a means of subsidizing the costs of education. The school underwent an interior update in the late 19th century, and in the early 20th century two banks of windows were added, a response to state standards on lighting conditions in schools. The building was electrified in 1915, but was never fitted with plumbing while it served as a school. It closed, due to declining enrollment and a comparatively high cost of operation in 1946. It was then converted into a residence.

First light was on 6 July 2007. Its name is a play on the acronym: Galaxy HŒ± Fabry- Perot System and the Spanish word \\"gafas\\" meaning spectacles. It produces maps, in intensity and velocity, of extended objects in the sky (which could be external galaxies, star forming regions in the Galaxy, planetary nebulae, or supernova remnants, as examples), which radiate in the H-alpha line, emitted by ionized hydrogen in interstellar space. It can also be used for a variety of other lines. The possibility to detect the emission line of interstellar neutral hydrogen at 21 centimeters wavelength revolutionized astronomy in the second half of the 20th century, as a powerful tool to explore the structure and evolution of galaxies and the star formation within them. A second revolution came, when, at millimetre wavelengths, molecular hydrogen could be detected and measured in directly using, above all, the emission from the lines of the CO molecule. Surprisingly, the emission from the third phase of interstellar hydrogen, the ionized phase, which is at optical wavelengths, has had less attention. The basic aim of GHaFaS is to make up for lost time by taking H-alpha velocity fields of galaxies at high spatial and spectral resolution. The performance of GHaFaS is comparable to that of the largest radio telescope producing 21 cm maps in atomic hydrogen: the VLA. Over a field of 3.4 arcminutes in diameter, it produces a map of ionized hydrogen emission with a nominal velocity resolution of and an angular resolution limited by the \\"seeing\\" due to atmospheric turbulence of less than 1 arcsecond when used on the WHT. These values are similar to the best figures obtainable with the VLA. However, a good quality map can be obtained in half a night's observing with GHaFaS, which is considerably more time efficient than that on the VLA. Comparison with ALMA, the best system for observing molecular hydrogen, is not so easy. ALMA produces maps at considerably higher angular resolution, but over a much smaller field. Thus, at the moment GHaFaS is best suited to observing \\"local\\" galaxies, out of distance, while ALMA is superior at intermediate and high redshift, in terms of angular and velocity resolutions. GHaFaS is very well suited to exploring the fine details of the internal kinematics of galaxies, as well as any phenomena related to the formation of high mass stars and their surroundings. It has been used to make the best measurements to date of the corotation radii of the density wave systems related to galaxy bars, and to explore the initial phases of the huge superbubbles caused by the combined stellar winds and supernovae of the OB associations of massive young stars, among a variety of its observing achievements.

It is one of the renowned Subramanya temples in Kerala which is estimated to be at least 1500 years old.  Location  The temple is located on Manarcaud - Kidangoor state highway, near the banks of Meenachil river. It is about 2 km from Kidangoor and 5 km from Ayarkunnam.  Deity  Lord Subramanya presides here by the name 'Thrikkidangoorappan'. He is also known as 'Parighapuresan' because Kidangoor have an alternate name 'Parighapuram'.  Legend  Kidangoor is one among the 64 Nambudiri villages and was on the boundary of the Vadakkumkur and Thekkumkur kingdoms. The legend has it that the idol of Subramanya came out of the Kamandalu (an oblong pot) of sage Gauna when the water flowed out. The idol flawed along with the water and it reached the Vishnu shrine in Kidangoor.  sub temple deities  *Bhagavathi: (Bhuvaneswari) faces south. Pushpanjaly, Raktha Pushpanjaly, Guruthi, Vara nivedyam, Kadumpayasam and Vella Nivedyam are the main offerings to Devi. *Sastha: Sasthas shrine is placed in the southwest corner. Pushpanjaly, Neivilakku, Neeranjanam, Vella Nivedyam, Ellupayasam, Muzhukkappu and Thirumugam are the important offerings. *Vishnu: Lord Vishnu has equal importance in the temple. He presides here by the name 'Vadakkumthevar' and the shrine is placed to the north of Subramanya sanctum. It is believed to be older than the Subramanya temple. *Ganapathi: Ganapathi, the first-worshipped God in Hinduism, is installed in a separate temple on the south-west side of the temple, facing east. This temple is a sub-temple of Kidangoor Temple, though constructed very recently in 1995.  Festivals  The temple hosts its annual festival in the Malayalam month of Kumbham (i.e. February/March) which lasts 10 long days. As in many temples in Kerala, the festivities start-off with the ceremonial flag hosting (Kodiyettu) on the Karthika day. The Aarattu (holy bathing) is held at Chembilavu Ponkunnathu Mahadeva temple on the banks of Meenachil river. Lord Shiva who presides at this temple is considered as the father of Thrikkidangoorappan. 'Thaipooyam' in the month of Makaram and 'Skanda Shashti' are the other important festive occasions. Pilgrims from different regions comes here to perform the sacred Shashtivrata on the 6th day of Amavasya.  Offerings  Utsavabali, Tulabharam, Kavadi, Chuttu Vilakku, Udayasthamana pooja, Muzhukappu, Panchamrita abhishekam, Pantheerazhi, Kadumpayasam are some of the important offerings.

These threads are absent in the deep, strong, shallow, sinus-furrow below the suture, in which, however, a few feeble spiral threads are found. Two, a little stronger, marginate the underside of the suture. The shell of the holotype is weathered, but seems to have been of a uniform pale tint. The spire is very tall, narrow, and conical. The apex broken. There remain 11 convex whorls of slow increase. The last is hunchy but not large, and is drawn out into a concave base with a broad snout. The suture is small, very much distorted by the longitudinal ribs. The aperture is small, elongately and gibbously pear-shaped. The outer lip is immensely but remotely thickened outside by the last rib, from which it is bevelled off to a narrow edge. The U-shaped sinus is deep, broad, and strong, close up to the suture but parted from it by a big triangular shelf. Below it the lip edge advances very much and then retreats again in front. The inner lip shows a thin broad glaze on the columella, which is very strong, oblique to the left, slightly cut off in front, where alone it is twisted with a thin rounded edgeWatson, R.B.

Motsoeneng was removed from his position as Chief operating officer after it had been found that he lied about his qualifications. After being removed as acting Chief operating officer it was announced that Motsoeneng would move back to his previous position as Group Executive Editor of Provinces and Corporate Affairs of the SABC. In December 2016, the Western Cape High Court ruled that Motsoeneng's appointment as Group Executive was illegal and that he was \\"not entitled to occupy any position at the SABC\\". Early life Motsoeneng was born in either Phuthaditjhaba, Free State in South Africa or Thaba Bosiu in Lesotho, where he was raised by his aunt. His mother is a sangoma. He attended Qhibi Ha Sethunya primary school in Qwa Qwa, Free State. Motsoeneng went on to Metsi Matsho High School, but did not matriculate. Early career Motsoeneng's career began in Puthaditjhaba when he met Kenneth Mopeli, then Chief Minister of the South African bantustan of QwaQwa, and became his mentor. Mopeli worked in the same office as Motsoeneng used to work. In the 1990s Motsoeneng became a freelancer at Radio Sesotho and would carry around a radio bag with a mic recorder where he would get lifts with his friends to stories because he did not own a vehicle. During this period community members alleged that Motsoeneng was a puppet used by Mopeli because not a week would go by where Motsoeneng would not broadcast a positive story about him. During this time Motsoeneng started to network with other high-profile politicians. Motsoeneng was eventually moved to Lesedi FM in Bloemfontein in 1992 where he started to make contacts with African National Congress (ANC) politicians. Employed as a stringer he was paid by the story despite being unable to speak English properly and did not have a matric certificate. He wanted to be closer to the newsroom and learn more. At the station, he became good friends with Sebolelo Ditlhakanyane and Sophie Mokoena. He would become close to ANC politicians such as Ace Magashule and Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri who would later go on to become the Premier of Free State and later the Minister of Communication under President Thabo Mbeki. Motsoeneng first met Jacob Zuma when Zuma made a speech in Free State before the 1994 elections. Motsoeneng went to cover the event. Zuma's speech was not well received, but Motsoeneng supported him and the two became close from then on. In 1995 he applied for permanent employment with the SABC and while completing the application form for the job, lied about having completed his matric at Metsi-Matsho High School in 1991. He would later explain that a Mrs Swanepoel from human resources told him to \\"fill in anything\\", while Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri was also chairman of the SABC at the time of his application. South African Broadcasting Corporation Motsoeneng joined the public broadcaster in 1996, as a junior news reporter and by 2003 had advanced to become a current affairs executive producer for Lesedi FM reporting to regional editor James Barkhuizen, again claiming to have matric qualifications. Due to his ANC connections, he was able to attract top politicians for interviews on his radio show. In 2002, Motsoeneng was named in an forensic audit in an investigation into the conduct of a news editor in Bloemfontein. Journalists claimed that Motsoeneng was promoted to a senior position as a producer because he helped her gain her own promotion. Soon Motsoeneng was clashing with his boss, Barkhuizen, interfering with the latters decisions and challenging editorial decisions. He was said to have given staff increases and hired others without his boss's permission. Both would be suspended in 2006 and Motsoeneng faced internal charges of racism, dishonesty, disruption and policy violations. There were at least three inquiries into the problems at the Free State office. The culminated in the 2006 inquiry by the SABC group internal audit department. He was fired from his position in 2007 for allegedly lying about his educational qualifications. In 2008 he sought employment at the Free State provincial government as a communications officer but by 2009, was reinstated at the SABC =Return to the SABC= After being back for 9 months he was appointed as Acting COO. Motsoeneng is best known for his controversial tenure as COO of the SABC and close relationship with President Jacob Zuma. During his time at SABC Motsoeneng blocked any critical coverage of President Jacob Zuma leading the Public Protector to state that his actions threatened to entrench a culture of impunity of people in power. He was also widely known for the unusual nature of his press statements and demands on journalists working for the SABC. Often referring to himself in the third person and making non sequitur statements. In February 2014, the public protector, Thuli Madonsela released a report entitled, ‚ÄúWhen governance and ethics fail‚Äù calling for the board of the SABC to take disciplinary action against Motsoeneng for dishonesty and the misrepresentation of his qualification, abuse of power and improper conduct in the appointments and salary increments for several employees. In 2014, the Democratic Alliance brought an interim application before the Western Cape High Court calling for Motsoeneng‚Äôs suspension pending a disciplinary hearing. Motsoeneng appealed the decision, but was overruled by the Supreme Court of Appeals. In 2015, Motsoeneng was criticized for granting himself a salary increase from R2.8 million to R3.7million, despite a reported annual loss for the SABC of R395 million. On 19 September 2016, the SABC board asked the Minister of Communications Faith Muthambi to appoint Motsoeneng as acting chief operating officer of the SABC until December 2016. After the Democratic Alliance filed papers in court in October 2016 against his appointment as the Group Executive of Corporate Affair, on 12 December 2016, the Western Cape High Court's Judge Owen Rogers ruled in favour of the Democratic Alliance application. He declared Motsoeneng's appointment as being unlawful and irrational. The SABC disciplinary hearing, that had cleared his way to obtaining the position, was also declared inadequate. The judge declared that the original disciplinary process should be put aside and a new open hearing established. In November 2016, parliamentary ad hoc committee was formed to investigate the SABC. The committee was to have a draft report ready by 24 January 2017 with a presentation to parliament on 15 February 2017. A leaked copy of the report in January 2017 outlined problems in financial compliance, political interference, unlawful dismissals of board and staff, interference in editorial decisions and poor transparency in the sale of its archives to MultiChoice and purchase of copies of the New Age newspaper. After a media briefing on 19 April 2017, presented while on suspension, Motsoeneng proceeded to criticise the SABC, its current board members and parliamentary ad hoc committee that investigated the organisation. The SABC felt he had breached the terms of his suspension and brought the organisation into disrepute and instituted a disciplinary hearing. In May 2017, he applied to the Labour Court to prevent the SABC from proceeding with its internal disciplinary hearing but the court denied his application. On 12 June 2017, the SABC finally sacked Motsoeneng after an internal disciplinary hearing found him to having lied about his qualifications, firing and retrenching staff and policy violations in regard to salary increases. In August 2017, he failed to appear in the Labour Court to answer questions as to why he shouldn't be held personally responsible for wrongly dismissing eight SABC journalists in July 2016. They had spoken out about the latters decision for the SABC not to broadcast anti- government protests. Later career On 13 December 2018, at the Garden Court Milpark Hotel in Johannesburg, Motsoeneng launched a political party, the African Content Movement. Introduced as Hlaudi (the decision-maker), he claimed was registered with the Electoral Commission and would contest the 2019 South African general election. With his political manifesto to follow shortly, he claimed he would become president, that the country would produce 90% of its requirements, that the economy shall be in the hands of the people, make company worker's shareholders, force foreign companies to leave the country and reduce social grants. The African Content Movement received 4,841 votes at 0.03% of the total vote in the elections. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_South_African_general_election  References  South African chief executives Jacob Zuma Living people 1968 births ","title":"Hlaudi Motsoeneng"},{"id":"52565762","text":"Absalon's Church Absalon's Church () is a defunct church in the Absalons Sogn of Copenhagen, Denmark.

The album was released on August 18, 2009 via Concord Jazz and Universal Music Group International labels. Background The idea for Choices was generated by conversations between Blanchard and Herbie Hancock during their joint tour in Fall 2008. The album is a loose sequel to Blanchard's previous Grammy- winning 2007 record, A Tale of God's Will (A Requiem for Katrina). Choices centers on broader questions about free will and personal responsibility. On several compositions the album features the voice of Cornel West, a notable socialist philosopher, civil rights activist, critic, and teacher of both religion and African American studies at Princeton University. Blanchard substantially bases the album's title and its conceptual backstory on the West's discourse on the nature of choice and the kind of people we may choose to be. Reception Mike Hobart of Financial Times stated \\"The flowing post- modal jazz, bubbling rhythm section and fluent solos are great. Blanchard‚Äôs smooth-centred sound packs punch, pianist Fabian Almazan delivers pinpoint textures and bass and drums subtly complete the picture. Bilal adds low-key vocals and Lionel Loueke trademark guitar.\\" Thom Jurek of AllMusic commented \\"Choices is a musically expansive, challenging recording that engages its title's subject matter critically and liberally without beating the listener over the head with it. It should appeal not only to jazzheads but open-minded music fans of all stripes. This set has plenty of class and sophistication, but it also speculatively reflects musical and intellectual history and mystery too\\". Dan Ouellette of Billboard wrote \\"the New Orleans-based trumpeter/composer embarks on a new, dramatic song cycle that plumbs the depths of personal and societal decision-making. In addition to his band, \\"Choices\\" features special guests: Lionel Loueke provides imaginative guitar parts, Dr. Cornel West delivers provocative spoken-word interludes, and vocalist Bilal sings on a pair of R&B; beauties. Blanchard has never sounded better on trumpet-his most passionate playing appears on the samba-like \\"Journey,\\" on which he supports Bilal, and the 12-minute lyrical sojourn \\"Winding Roads.\\" Other standouts include the Bilal-sung \\"When Will You Call\\" and the upbeat \\"Robin's Choice.\\" Robert Spellman of Sunday Express added \\"Blanchard, joined by his closest players, follows with plaintive, tumbling, free-flowing jams that cannot fail to engage the jazz listener\\".

Born in St Croix, while it was still a Danish colony before it was purchased by the US government and incorporated into the US Virgin Islands, hence its citizens were able to emigrate to the US mainland. Elizabeth was raised in St. Croix until 11 years old when she was sent to New York to stay with her aunt. In New York Elizabeth received a good education and went on to High School where she mixed with and was influenced by prominent white people of respectable backgrounds. Elizabeth became a member of the Quaker organisation and had a love child by G.E. Willett, son of an influential Quaker family from Quebec. Elizabeth later became a prominent member of the Harlem Renaissance movement of east New York. She was a well- known street corner speaker and was involved in the struggles of the Harlem Tenants League in the 1920s. She helped to establish benevolent organizations, several groups in New York including the American West Indians Ladies Aid Society, and the Virgin Islands Catholic Relief Organization to help Virgin Islanders at home and in Harlem. She also assisted prominent Virgin Islander Rothschild Francis in establishing his paper, The Emancipator. (AWILAS) was called the Danish West Indians Ladies Aid Society when it was established in Harlem in 1915 to serve Danish West Indian immigrant women. At the time there were other Danish West Indian organizations in New York, but none geared specifically toward women. The AWILAS worked in conjunction with many other organizations in Harlem. Elizabeth Hendrickson served as president of the Society in 1924 and 1930. Elizabeth Anna was a well-known street corner speaker and was involved in the struggles of the Harlem Tenants League in the 1920s. Harlem was a black metropolis, and West Indians were part of a larger, more Pan-African, demographic group. Of the Caribbean immigrants the Virgin Islander knew more about the U.S. and their discrimination against blacks due to the colonisation of the Danish Islands in 1917. With Ashley L. Totten she formed the Virgin Islands Protective Association, which aimed at addressing the mistreatment of those in their homeland. As radical street-corner speakers these Virgin Islander immigrants, such as Elizabeth Anna really shone. \\"The street corner became the most viable location for an alternative politics and the place where new social movements gained a hearing and recruited supporters\\".Watkins-Owens, Blood Relations, 92 Authorities frequently blamed Caribbean immigrants for stirring up discontent in Harlem. Elizabeth Anna introduced her radical thoughts to a mass that was eager at least to listen to new ideas. In this way Elizabeth Anna, among other Virgin Islanders, played a significant part in the shaping of politics in New York City. TBC.

After graduating from the Department of Commercial Law in Bolzano, Italy, she studied biology at the University of Innsbruck in Austria in 1979. By 1984, she was also an Italian language interpreter. From 1986 to 1988, she worked in the private sector in Bregenz, and, from 1989 to 2000, as an assistant to the hospital management in the Feldkirch country hospital in Feldkirch.  Political career  Schmid began her political activity in G√∂fis. From 1995 to 2000, she was the local representative of the \\"Offene Dorfliste\\" and chairman of the Social Committee. In 1999 and 2000, she was a member of the Landtag for the √ñVP in the Vorarlberg Landtag, and as such she also part of the environmental committee of the Volkspartei. From October 2000 onwards, she was responsible in the areas of family, women, youth and senior citizens, social affairs, nursing and care, development cooperation, information technology and telecommunication policy as a regional councilor in the Vorarlberg provincial government as the successor to Eva Maria Waibel. In the 14 years of her career, Schmid was a member of a total of four √ñVP-led provincial governments under two different provincial heads. The first time, she was a member of the state governments in the provincial government of Herbert Sausgruber by 11 October 2000, and subsequently became a member of the provincial government under the title of regional governor for new governor Markus Wallner.

Retinol-binding proteins (RBP) are a family of proteins with diverse functions. They are carrier proteins that bind retinol. Assessment of retinol-binding protein is used to determine visceral protein mass in health-related nutritional studies. Retinol and retinoic acid play crucial roles in the modulation of gene expression and overall development of an embryo. However, deficit or excess of either one of these substances can cause early embryo mortality or developmental malformations. Regulation of transport and metabolism of retinol necessary for a successful pregnancy is accomplished via RBP. Retinol-binding proteins have been identified within the uterus, embryo, and extraembryonic tissue of the bovine, ovine, and porcine, clearly indicating that RBP plays a role in proper retinol exposure to the embryo and successful transport at the maternal-fetal interface. Further research is necessary to determine the exact effects of poor RBP expression on pregnancy and threshold levels for said expression. Genes * Cellular: RBP1, RBP2, RBP5, RBP7 * Interstitial: RBP3 * Plasma: RBP4 RBP in pregnancy Retinol plays a crucial role in the growth and differentiation of various body tissues, and it has been previously characterized that embryos are extremely sensitive to alterations in retinol concentration that can lead to spontaneous abortion and malformations occurring during development. Within a mature animal, retinol is transported from the liver via the circulatory system while bound to RBP to the desired target tissue. RBP is also bound to a carrier protein, transthyretin. The process by which RBP releases retinol for cellular availability is still unknown and not concisely determined. =Sites of synthesis= Traditionally, RBP is synthesized within the liver with secretion being dependent upon retinol concentrations. However, the concentrations levels do not appear to have an effect upon transcription of RBP messenger RNA (mRNA) which remains constant. Literature reveals that the bovine endometrium has also been identified as a location of RBP synthesis, as well as, the conceptus and extraembryonic tissues of various livestock species. =Types= # Plasma retinol-binding protein, the retinol transport vehicle in serum. # CRBP I/II, cellular-binding proteins involved in transport of retinol and metabolites into retinyl esters for storage or into retinoic acid. # CRABPs, cellular retinoic acid‚Äìbinding proteins capable of binding retinol and retinoic acid with high affinity. It has also been characterized that CRABPs are involved in many aspects of the retinoic acid signaling pathway such as the regulation and availability of retinoic acid to nuclear receptors. =Presence in livestock species during gestation= ;Bovine/Ovine RBP, identical to that found in plasma has been identified in the placental tissues of both the ovine and the bovine, suggesting that RBP may be highly involved in retinol transport and metabolism during pregnancy. However, exact timing of expression had been yet to be identified. An antiserum specific for bovine conceptus RBP and immunohistochemistry has been utilized to identify the presence of RBP at different stages of early pregnancy. Strong immunostaining and hybridization were observed in the trophectoderm of tubular, but not spherical blastocysts at day 13. RBP mRNA was localized to epithelial cells of the chorion, allantois, and amnion at day 45 of pregnancy. Lastly, RBP mRNA was detected in the cotyledons, the fetal contribution to the placenta and the site of attachment to the uterine epithelium for fetal/maternal exchange. Expression of RBP in developing conceptuses, extraembryonic membranes, and at the fetal- maternal interface indicate that there may be some regulation of retinol transport and metabolism that occurs due to RBP by the extraembryonic membranes. Within the uterus of pregnant bovines, it has been found that RBP synthesis in the luminal and glandular epithelium is quite similar to that of a cyclic animal‚Äôs; however upon reaching day 17 of the estrous cycle, levels of RBP remain constant and continue to gradually rise throughout gestation. It has also been suggested that ovarian steroids may play a role in regulating uterine RBP expression. ;Porcine All three previously mentioned types of retinol-binding proteins (RBP, CRBP, CRABP) have been identified within the porcine placenta during pregnancy via immunohistochemistry. As previously mentioned, retinol and retinoic acid are modulators of gene expression and are necessary for the proper development and growth of a conceptus. Porcine exhibit a diffuse type placenta that has areolar-gland subunits which allows for transport of larger molecules between dam and fetus. RBP and CRBP have been identified in the endometrial glands and areolar trophoblasts, suggesting that RBP is crucial in transport of retinol from the gland to the trophectoderm of the conceptus. RBP expression has also been identified within the yolk sac, myometrium, oviduct, and numerous other fetal tissues.

The genus encompasses several distinct varieties of Asian herb, seed, and vegetable crop, including P. frutescens (deulkkae) and P. frutescens var. crispa (shiso). The genus name Perilla is also a frequently employed common name (\\"perilla\\"), applicable to all varieties. Perilla varieties are cross-fertile and intra-specific hybridization occurs naturally. Some varieties are considered invasive. Taxa and synonyms The classification of Perilla is confused, partly because botanists struggled with distinguishing the two distinct cultigens as different species or variations. Until a few decades ago, P. frutescens var. crispa was regarded as a species in its own right, distinct from P. frutescens, although it was well established that these types readily cross-pollinate. An early example of dividing the two cultigens into different species is found in Matsumura's 1884 nomenclature book, where the synonym P. arguta Benth. is applied to P. frutescens var. crispa, and the synonym P. ocymoides L. was applied to P. frutescens. The species name P. ocymoides or P. ocimoides has historically been used to denote P. frutescens var. crispa, especially by the Japanese, therefore it should not be considered an interchangeable synonym for either cultigen. Recent genetic research confirms that the cultigens are of a common gene pool, corroborating the taxonomists' claim for consolidating the two crops into one species. Existing Perilla species: * P. frutescens ‚Äì also called Korean perilla or deulkkae; the leaves are called kkaennip ** P. f. var. crispa ‚Äì also called shiso, t√≠a t√¥, or Japanese basil ** P. f. var. hirtella ‚Äì also called lemon perilla Possible Perilla species with insufficient description and without known herbarium specimens include: * P. cavaleriei H.L√©v. * P. heteromorpha Carri√®re * P. setoyensis G.Honda The past legacies and subsequent reclassification of taxa has led to confusion of nomenclature. The red or purple leafed variety of P. frutescens var. crispa had been dubbed P. nankinensis, and this label was used throughout the 19th century in the West following the introduction of the species for ornamental planting. Whether green-leafed or red-leafed, the perillaldehyde factor that characterizes the unique P. frutescens var. crispa fragrance may turn out to be present or absent in the individual or population, and this is not differentiable from outward appearance alone. Chemical studies classify the genus into different chemotypes, depending on the essential oils they contain. Three wild species that are endemic to Japan are recognized as genetically distinct from the cultivated P. frutescens var. crispa, however, some references treat, e.g., P. frutescens var. hirtella as the same species as the P. frutescens var. crispa. =Formerly placed here= * P. elata = Elsholtzia blanda * P. fruticosa = Elsholtzia fruticosa * P. lanceolata = Mosla scabra * P. leptostachya = Elsholtzia stachyodes '' * P. marathrosma = Agastache foeniculum * P. nankinensis = Plectranthus scutellarioides * P. polystachya = Elsholtzia ciliata Use =Culinary use= Perilla varieties are cultivated and consumed mainly in Korea, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam. P. frutescens leaves, seeds, and seed oil are used extensively in Korean cuisine, while P. frutescens var. crispa leaves, seeds, and sprouts are used in Japanese and Vietnamese cuisines.

In 1806 Bavaria opened negotiations for a concordat, which were shelved in 1807, but in 1814 Bavaria's Foreign Minister and Interior Minister began preparing for fresh negotiations. These opened in 1816, with talks led by Bavaria's minister to the Holy See, bishop Johann Casimir H√§ffelin.

In the consistory of 6 April 1818 Pius VII also made him a cardinal, with his title being Santa Sabina and then from 1822 Sant'Anastasia - as such he took part in the conclave of 1823 which selected pope Leo XII.

Route There is a short on-road section along Lancaster Ave Melrose Park, and elevated steel mesh boardwalks through Ermington Nature Reserve. There used to be a further short on-road section via Pike St and South St Rydalmere to Subiaco Creek, but this is no longer the case since the Subiaco Creek link opened in June 2017.

Built in 1901 as part of a larger estate, the complex includes a carriage house, tack house, and coachman's quarters of a quality unrivaled in the state. Obsoleted by the advent of the automobile, the buildings have been converted to residential use. They were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Wells-Jackson Carriage House Complex is located in a residential area between downtown Burlington and the University of Vermont campus, on the south side of Jackson Court, a short, densely built residential side street off South Willard Street. The complex includes three buildings: the wood-frame tack house and coachman's quarters, both set near the street, and the large brick carriage house, which stands behind those two, and is accessed via a drive between them. The tack house and coachman's house both have redstone foundations, and have exteriors finished in a combination of wooden clapboards and shingles in the Queen Anne Victorian style. The carriage house has a 2-1/2 story main block, from which two large wings project. Its main entrance, facing north towards Jackson Court, has a large two-leaf doorway topped by a hayloft entrance in the form of a Palladian window. These are set in a two- story round arch panel with brick quoined borders and a granite keystone. The interior of the carriage barn was, at the time of its construction, fitted with a wide array of modern amenities, including steam heat, electricity, and plumbing. with The complex was built by the widow of William Wells and her son-in-law, Dr. H Nelson Jackson. The family owned an estate whose surviving house is located north of here, but is separated by later infill residential construction. The Wellses had become wealthy in the business of manufacturing patent medicines, and the elaborate amenities (which resulted in horses being stabled in better conditions than some of Burlington's human residents) reflected the family's wish for the highest quality. The buildings represent the final epitome of carriage houses and horse-related outbuildings, which were soon obsoleted by the advent of the automobile. These buildings only saw relatively brief use as their intended function, and the tack house and portions of the carriage house were soon converted to residential use. The remaining portions of the carriage house were converted to residential use later in the 20th century.

The Finney Strictureplasty is performed by folding the diseased bowel on itself and creating a large opening between the two loops. This strictureplasty can be used to address longer strictures (>7 cm and ‚â§15 cm) than those manageable with the Heineke-Mikulicz technique (usually performed for strictures up to 7 cm). The Finney Strictureplasty is named after the Finney pyloroplasty, first described in 1937. The strictured loop is folded over itself at its midpoint section, forming a U shape. A longitudinal enterotomy is then performed halfway between the mesenteric and the antimesenteric side on the folded loop. The opposed edges of the bowel are sutured together to create a short side-to- side anisoperistaltic enteroenterostomy. Concerns about long-term complications, such as bacterial overgrowth in the bypassed segment, limit the length of the stricture to be addressed by this strictureplasty to less than 15 cm. Strictureplasties are categorized into three groups: Conventional, intermediate, and complex procedures. The Heineke-Mikulicz Strictureplasty is the most common among the conventional stricutreplasties, the Finney Strictureplasty is the most common intermediate strictureplasty, and the most common complex strictureplasty is the Michelassi Strictureplasty.

She served in the German parliament (Bundestag) between 1990 and 2002, and was a Bundestag vice-president between 1998 and 2002. In 1990 she served, improbably as she thought, both at the time and subsequently, as the chair of the 50 member Electoral Commission appointed to supervise East Germany's first (and last) freely held and fairly administered general election. Life =Provenance and early years= Petra Bl√§ss was born in Leipzig which at that time was in the heavily urbanised southern part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Her father was a theatre director. Her mother was also involved in theatre work, later working at Cottbus as a prompter in a music theatre. Her sister became an actress. Her parents' marriage broke up soon after she was born, and she \\"grew up without a father\\". She grew up in Wittenberg, a small university town closely associated with Martin Luther, located some 40 km (25 miles) to the north of Leipzig. Bl√§ss successfully completed her school final exams (\\"Abitur\\") in 1982 which opened the way for her enrollment at the Humboldt University in Berlin where she studied History, Germanistics and Pedagogy, emerging in 1987 with a degree and a qualification as a teacher of History and German. Instead of entering the teaching profession she remained at the Humboldt till 1990, working on her doctorate. and undertaking research in Literary science in the German Studies department. The working title for her doctoral dissertation was \\"The presentation of war and images of peace in the dramatic output of \\" (\\"Kriegsdarstellung und Friedensbilder in der Dramatik Alfred Matusches\\"). This piece of work was never completed, however. In 1986 she had joined East Germany's ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), \\"buoyed by the hope that Gorbachev's more liberal brand of socialism in the USSR might be workable in East Germany too\\", although sources are silent on any political involvement before 1989. As she herself later explained the matter, since there were no parties with real power ... other than the SED, joining the party was the only option there was to influence political developments. =Time of changes= Political changes accelerated during 1989 and 1990 along with accompanying uncertainty: the university let her know early in 1989 that after she had obtained her doctorate it did not expect to offer her a job, and she spent a year or so looking for suitable work in the theatre, the arts or the media, but without immediate success. In December 1989 she was a co-founder of the Independent Women's Association (\\"Unabh√§ngige Frauenverband\\" / UFV), described by some as a \\"political party\\". A few months earlier it would have been unthinkable for anything resembling a political party to exist in the German Democratic Republic that was not directly controlled by the SED, but during the run-up to the March 1990 election the UFV was one of several new political groupings that emerged blinking from semi-secrecy. A month after helping to create the UFV, in January 1990 Bl√§ss resigned from the SED. In February 1990 she was nominated as the UFV delegate to the 50-member electoral commission being set up ahead of the forthcoming general election and communal elections. In a secret ballot she was then elected to chair the commission, receiving 12 of the 27 votes cast. No less a person than the new prime minister, Hans Modrow himself, after first asking if he might address her as \\"Petra\\" (rather than as \\"Miss Bl√§ss\\"), when he congratulated her on the appointment also made clear his belief that, where the opportunity presented itself, one must do something in uncertain times to support national stability, if only in order to avoid the question from members of future generations, \\"Why did you do nothing?\\". Interviewed by a journalist at the time, Bl√§ss was unable to explain why she had been selected for the job, beyond commenting that it seemed to have to do with her involvement in the women's movement, and that she brought nothing remarkable to the job except an exceptional ability for keeping calm under pressure \\"even before exams\\". Despite her national responsibilities, she continued to pursue her political agenda. In the evenings she involved herself in discussion groups with the UFV, with New Forum and with \\"Green\\" groups. Following the electoral success in March 1990 of the CDU in East Germany, an unstoppable momentum developed towards reunification, but the political backdrop for the re-appearance of democracy in the German Democratic Republic was seen by many activists in 1989 to have more to do with Mikhail Gorbachev than with Helmut Kohl. Petra Bl√§ss was one of many thoughtful East Germans who harboured reservations about the steam-roller progress to a united Germany, and expressed her outrage when the first draft of the reunification treaty mentioned in just one very dismissive sentence \\"the needs of women and the disabled\\". In June 1990 she finally abandoned any prospect of completing her doctoral dissertation, taking an editorial job with DFF, the East German state broadcasting corporation. She stayed with DFF till the end of 1990. =Politics in a united Germany= Ahead of the General election of December 1990, which was the first post-reunification election, Bl√§ss was invited to put her name forward on the candidate list of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), which was East Germany's old ruling Socialist Unity Party, now rebranded and desperately trying to re-invent itself as a left-wing mainstream party for a democratic Germany. She was not at this stage a party member (joining it formally only in January 1997) but agreed, and although the PDS only received 2.4% of the total votes, which gave it just 17 seats in the new 662 seat Bundestag, her name was high enough on the party list for her to be one of the 17, though formally she was not, at this stage, affiliated to any political party. As an academic at the Humboldt University she had not been targeted with the political persecution that had affected more politically engaged colleagues and other dissidents, and while she was critical of the abusive aspects of the old regime, she continued to respect many of the social values that had characterised East Germany. Thanks in part to a desperate labour shortage, East Germany had far outstripped West Germany in terms of female participation in the work force, and its abortion laws had also been strikingly more \\"progressive\\". Bl√§ss never felt moved to condemn the old East German r√©gime unreservedly. She later recalled that in the immediate aftermath of reunification the 17 Bundestag members from the PDS candidate list found themselves isolated or shunned by members of other parties. \\"We were shut out. We were the evil ones.\\" Bl√§ss nevertheless continued to sit as a Bundestag member till 2002 (by when the PDS vote share had grown to the point where it was entitled to fill 37 of the 666 seats). Between October 1998 and October 2002 she served as a Bundestag vice-president. During this period she also spoke for the PDS in the chamber on Women's Issues and Social Policy. After leaving the Bundestag Bl√§ss continued to be politically involved, although in 2005 she resigned again from the PDS, asserting that membership of a political party was not compatible with the political neutrality which was a top priority for her work at the time. In recent years she has described herself as a \\"freelance political consultant\\" (\\" freiberufliche Politikberaterin\\"). Her largest series of projects arose from Germany's contribution to the Balkans Stability Pact, and has involved advising, initially, on parliamentary structures and institutions in the various countries formerly in Yugoslavia and, more recently, in Albania. One priority, reflecting a defining theme of her entire political career, concerned training women for politics and participation in civil society. After she switched her focus towards Albania she combined advising on parliamentary matters in Tirana with teaching a course on Gender studies at a university in the southeast of the country. Petra Bl√§ss is a member of \\"Atlantic Bridge\\" (\\"Atlantik-Br√ºcke\\") and of the Southeast Europe Society.

He was the deputy leader of the first Indian expedition to the Antarctica during 1981‚Äì82. He was known for his geological studies on Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and was an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy, Geological Society of India, Association of Exploration Geophysicists and the National Academy of Sciences, India. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Earth, Atmosphere, Ocean and Planetary Sciences in 1978. The Government of India awarded him the fourth highest Indian civilian honour of Padma Shri in 1983.  Biography  Aligarh Muslim University H. N. Siddiquie was born on 20 July 1934 to M. A. Siddiquie, a civil surgeon and his homemaker wife, Ahemedi Begum as the eldest of their 6 sons and two daughters in Bijnor in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. His early education was at the Government Higher Secondary School, Adilabad and after matriculation in 1949, he completed his intermediate studies at Osmania University in 1951. Thereafter he joined Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) from where he completed his graduate degree in science in 1954. It was during this period, his father died but he continued his studies at AMU to obtain a master's degree in geology in 1956 and pursued his doctoral studies at the university but his doctoral degree came years later when the university awarded him the degree of Doctor of Philosophy while he was serving National Institute of Oceanography. His career started at Geological Survey of India (GSI) in 1956 at their Ground Water Exploration Division and Research Laboratories. He served GSI for over 17 years during which period he served as a senior geologist during 1966‚Äì73 and had a training stint at Shirshov Institute of Oceanology, Moscow. When the Government of India established National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in 1973, he moved to the institute's Goa headquarters as a Grade-E scientist and the head of the Geological Oceanography Division. He served NIO in different capacities such as Grade-F Scientist and deputy director before becoming the director of the institute in 1985. Siddiquie was married to Talat, and the couple had a daughter and two sons. He was 52 years old when he died in harness on 14 November 1986 succumbing a massive heart attack, the second one in a span of one year.  Legacy  National Institute of Oceanography, Goa Siddiquie's principal areas of operation were the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and the Antarctica and his efforts may be categorized under seven heads viz. exploration of petroleum and minerals, infrastructure development, exploration of ploymetallic nodules, studies on sediments, studies on Foraminifera, paleoclimatic studies and Antarctica expedition. He was associated with several oil projects which include piping route identification, bathymetric and shallow seismic surveys and post-lay surveys in Bombay High, Bassein-Gujarat line, and Butcher Island routes for Oil and Natural Gas Commission and the Mahanadi delta survey for Oil India. For Port Trust Board of India, he conducted surveys for the ports of Mormugao, Visakhapatnam, Mangalore and Karwar. He was credited with the initiation of managanese nodule program in India and this coordinated program was reported to have earned India a place among the seven registered Pioneer Investors of the International Seabed Authority of the United Nations. The first bottom sediment map of the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal was prepared under his supervision which served as a guide for future explorations in the region. The map identified the presence of Foraminifera, a class of amoeboid protists, which indicated the marine pollution levels and the resources of calcareous sediments in Lakshadeep sea. His studies on Lakshadeep offshores also assisted in widening the understanding of about the origin of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. He was the deputy leader of the first Indian expedition to Antarctica, under the leadership of Syed Zahoor Qasim and he coordinated the marine science programs for Dakshin Gangotri, the permanent Indian station in the southernmost continent. His studies and researches have been documented by way of a number peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles has listed 14 of them. He also mentored seven doctoral scholars in their studies. Siddiquie was associated with the Indian government agencies such as Ocean Science and Technology Board and National Council of Science Museums and was a member of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics and Jadavpur University Geological Society in 1983 and 1984 respectively. He sat in the council of Association of Exploration Geophysicists in 1985 and served as the vice-chair of the Training, Education and Mutual Assistance (TEMA) (1984‚Äì85) and Improved uses of Research Vessels workshop (1984), both organized by of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission/UNESCO. He was also a member of IOC/UNESCO Guiding Group of Experts for the Programme Ocean Science and Non- Living Resources (OSNLR). On the educational front, he served as a member of the research and advisory council of the National Geophysical Research Institute, the boards of studies of Andhra University, Cochin University of Science and Technology, Mangalore University and Bombay University, the planning board of Kashmir University and the executive council of Goa University. He also served as a member of the editorial boards of Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences and Indian Journal of Marine Sciences.

In this strictureplasty the long loop of the bowel affected by Crohn's disease is first divided at its midpoint. The two halves are then moved side to side. A very long opening is created between two loops, which are then sutured together. The recent extension of this technique to Crohn's disease of the last portion of the small bowel (terminal ileum) going into the right colon is poised to change the paradigm of surgical treatment of terminal ileitis from a conventional resection (ileocolectomy) to a bowel sparing procedure. This technique is now used around the globe. Long-term results with this technique are very satisfactory. Strictureplasties are categorized into three groups: Conventional, intermediate, and complex procedures. The Heineke-Mikulicz Strictureplasty is the most common among the conventional stricutreplasties, the Finney Strictureplasty is the most common intermediate strictureplasty, and the most common complex strictureplasty is the Michelassi Strictureplasty.

Having been sterilized without knowing at the Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, the mothers sued county doctors, the State of California, and the U.S. government. Having collected hospital records from a whistleblower, Chicana lawyer Antonia Hernandez led the lawsuit against powerful institutions. Plot summary The documentary introduces several mothers involved in the Madrigal v. Quilligan trial who recount the day they were sterilized, what their dreams and aspirations concerning family had been beforehand, and their involvement in fighting for Chicana rights. Family members are also introduced throughout, many having just learned about the sterilizations performed on their loved ones. The history of coercive sterilization, focusing on the sterilization of Latina women, is the main theme of the documentary. No M√°s Beb√©s transitions to focusing on Madrigal v. Quilligan, introducing Antonia Hernandez as the lawyer in charge of the case and detailing the obstacles she faced in building a case against the powerful institutions that were on trial. The documentary comes to a close with ruling of the trial in favor of the Hospital and the final thoughts of the figures in the documentary. Video and news clips from the 1970s concerning the women, the court case, and the hospital appear throughout the documentary. Characters =Mothers= Consuelo Hermosillo: Originally from Vera Cruz, Mexico, and known for her cooking skills in her son's restaurant, Hermosillo was always the one fighting for the rights of her children and community, making her well known within her neighborhood.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/554ef065e4b0f8a239408807/t/56a00e155827c3c94e05445a/1453329942396/No+Mas+Bebes+PBS+EPK.pdf She loves children and wanted 4 or 5. She was sterilized at 23. The doctors made her sign in a gurney while experiencing a lot a pain and discomfort after giving birth. Next to her signature was \\"No mas bebes por vidas\\". She joined the court case, but originally didn‚Äôt think Ms. Antonia could accomplish anything. Hermosillo was shocked when Hernandez had made it so far with the case. During her recorded interview with Prof. Ibanez, she described how she always dreamt that she had her baby and that she would go to Mexico and people would always want to see him. \\"A miracle that nobody else can have\\". The operation made Consuelo feel not as brave as she used to feel. Mar√≠a Hurtado: A strong willed woman who found way to cross the traditional boundaries of the role of Chicana women. Her strong relationship with her husband, who she has been married to for 51 and half years, is evident throughout the film, many clips depicting the two dancing. Because she was not fluent in English, her five children would translate for her. The Hurtados had valued family and had plans to have a large family. She joined the lawsuit immediately after Antonia Hernandez had asked her to.\\"Keep fighting for what you want\\" Dolores Madrigal: Dolores and her husband were factory workers that saved up for their family and house. After learning about the sterilization several weeks after it occurred, her relationship with her husband became strained, who directed his anger at her verbally and physically. He had started to drink after the sterilization occurred. He would say, \\"Women do this to be with other men and their husbands never found out\\". She was the lead plaintiff in the historic civil rights trial. Her son found out about the sterilization during the production of the film. Maria Figueroa: Living in East LA, a family-oriented women that was always with her children when not at work. Like the other mothers, Maria's life was changed when she was sterilized, affecting her life and marriage.She chose to stay in her marriage for her children, and almost went as far as committing suicide because of the effects the sterilization had on her marriage and mental state. After informing her husband of her sterilization, he told her that she could not conduct any interviews or testify. Melvina Hern√°ndez: A homeworker that was sterilized at the age of 23 and did not find out until four years later. She was told to sign a paper that was in English for a C-section that was needed if the doctor was going to \\"save her and the baby.\\" Hernandez refused, because her husband was not present, but the nurse told her to sign or she would die. The nurse ended up grabbing her hand and signed the paper for her. =Attorneys= Antonia Hernandez: Civil Rights attorney. A UCLA Law School Graduate, Hernandez immigrated from Mexico and grew up in East LA. Employed at the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice (LACLJ), she was one of the two attorneys who filed Madrigal v. Quilligan at the age of 26. She decided to file the case after Dr. Rosenfeld landed in the legal aids office. Hernandez would spend her time driving up and down Lincoln Heights in East LA, trying to find the mothers, many of whom their statute of limitation had ended. Ms. Antonia felt that the only way to go to court was to file a class action lawsuit to claim that the women's right to have babies was denied. She later became the President of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and is now the CEO of the California Community Foundation. Nancy Menzies Vaessen: Doctor's Defense attorney. Was able to file a motion that dismissed Dr. Quilligan and Dr. Roger Freeman from the case for not having direct responsibility and not being present during the sterilizations. \\"You have to look at what the facts are....that's why documentation is so important\\" Charles Nabarrete: A graduate of UCLA law school, Nabarrete was the lead attorney for the Madrigal case. Jovit Rivera: Plaintiff. Rivera believed that the ruling was saying that nothing had happened. Hon. Jesse Curtis, Jr.: The federal judge that decided the outcome of Madrigal vs. Quilligan. He found the defendants not guilty and that \\"the cultural background of these particular women has contributed to the problem\\" of these sterilizations taking place. =Doctors= Dr. Edward James Quilligan: (County hospital obstetrician) Known as a pioneer in the field of maternal fetal medicine, Dr. Quilligan is well regarded by his peers. During the time of the women's‚Äô sterilizations and the trial, Quilligan was the head of the Women's Hospital at LAC+USC Medical Center after coming from Yale. As the main defendant in the Madrigal trial, he denied and claimed that he was unaware of the multiple accounts of forced sterilization that took place in USC. He denied pushing for family planning on any specific group. \\"If you see a patient for the first time who is in labor who has a large number of children and one of the things you discuss with her is the possibility of tubal ligation, I think it's perfectly appropriate\\" Dr. Bernard Rosenfeld: Early into his residency, Dr. Rosenfeld was suspicious of the forced sterilizations by tubal ligation. Rosenfeld chose to speak out and collected files on the sterilizations performed and conversations he had on the matter, despite being ignored by many of his colleagues. Every day. he would type letters explaining what was going on in USC. Rosenfeld would also record conversations between doctors, some having a stereotypical view of the Hispanic community. He complained to Quilligan at least three times, but the problem was never stopped. He provided evidence against the hospital to Nabarette and Hernandez. As a whistleblower, Rosenfeld was let go by the hospital and ostracized over the years. The hospital went to the extent of trying to revoke his license by claiming that he gave hospital information to a third party. \\"He could've stopped the problem completely.....but it kept happening\\" \\"No private doctor would ever go up to a woman in a private hospital while she was in labor about having her tubes tied\\" Dr. Karen Benker: An obstetric technician conducting rounds at USC during the times of the sterilizations from 1967 to 1971, during her time there, she was exposed to the many members of staffs attitudes towards the sterilizations of minority women. On one account, she described how she was on an obstetrics rotation and Dr. Quilligan took the doctors on a tour and declared that the hospital had gotten a grant to see how far they could cut the negro and Mexican. She testified of the doctors wrongdoings in Madrigal vs. Quilligan. Dr. Jerry Neuman: A former medical student at USC hospital, when he first came to LA, he was not familiar with Latin culture at all. After having orientation for an hour, he was sent out to start his work in the hospital. As a defendant in the Madrigal vs. Quilligan case, Neumann believed he was doing nothing wrong and had not sterilized anyone through coercion. He claimed it was \\"horrible to have your name splashed on the front page of the LA Times, having headlines questioning your motives. Dr. Howard Blanchette A former medical student that was at USC during the sterilization incidents Dr. Michael Kreitzer A former medical student at USC and defendant in Madrigal vs. Quilligan. He was offended by the idea that the sterilizations they performed were aimed at performing sterilization on Mexicans who were seen as unable to take care of their kids. \\"Nothing could be further from the truth\\" =Professors= Professor Elena Gutierrez: An Associate Professor of Latin American and Latino Studies Program and Gender Studies & Women's Studies Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In the film, she discussed the message of the infamous book, The Population Bomb by Stanford University Professor Paul R. Ehrlich. She describes the book as a call to having so many births. Professor Alexandra Stern A historian from the University of Michigan's American Culture department. Provided history on the concept and reasonings behind the major push for family planning in the '70s in the United States. Professor Carlos Velez-Ibanez An expert witness and anthropologist that graduated from UCLA and is currently the Regents Professor of the School of Transborder Studies at Arizona State University. He conducted several interviews for Hernandez and Nabarette. He had received a call from Hernandez about what the effects of sterilization would have on the women, and Ibanez responded that they would be serious. Ibanez claims that the judge used him during the trial to justify the reasoning that the doctors would not have known about the effects of sterilization on if it took him, an anthropologist, 6 months to figure it out. =Activist= Gloria Molina: Molina was a legal secretary and president of Comisi√≥n Femenil Mexicana Nacional when the nascent feminist organization signed on as class representatives for the lawsuit. She oversaw the reform and reconstruction at LAC+USC. She would go on to have a successful career in politics. =Journalist= Claudia Dreifus: A journalist that provided historical context for the documentary. She described that during the time of the trial, women were strongly beginning to ask about their reproductive rights, but people were not considering coerced sterilization. She also interviewed Dr. Quilligan and described him as not understanding what was moderately problematic about the sterilizations. \\"He felt that him or those under him did anything wrong\\" Frank Cruz: Cruz was the only TV reporter that covered the Madrigal v. Quilligan trial as the first Latino anchor on the Los Angeles television news. Before television, he taught Chicano history. He is currently a member of the Board of Trustees of USC. Impact of sterilizations in women in film Some of the women felt as if the sterilizations had ended their lives and their husbands would leave them, because they were no longer \\"women\\". When Antonia Hernandez interviewed/talked to the mothers, the subject would be changed when the husband was present. They would then tell Hernandez not to bring up the subject again. The women would be coerced into signing the paper by phrases such as, \\"Want the shot to take away the pain? Sign, no m√°s dolor\\". \\"You better sign those paper, or your baby could probably die here.\\" Family planning Family planning was a major push in the '70s to control population growth and supply, especially minority women, access to health services that they previously did not have before. Large sums of money came through the government to promote the plan. Public institutions were allowed to apply for money from federal programs. Because the flow of money was not controlled, it led to the problems around coerced sterilization of minorities in hospitals. There were many rushed labors in the hospital and women would sign consensus forms for tubal ligation without reading the document. Women would go to the county hospitals to give birth, with some of them leaving sterilized without their knowledge. Using the phrase \\"tying of the tubes\\" misinformed people believing that tubes could become untied. They did not know that their tubes were ultimately cut. Madrigal vs. Quilligan: important details from the film * Built under Roe v. Wade. * The women who signed on as plaintiffs agreed that their stories would go public for the first time * Took a year and a half to prepare the case *Described as Goliath versus David * California had one of highest sterilization rates, if not the highest * June 1971‚ÄìMarch 1974, coercive sterilization * Cased filed in 1975 by 10 Chicana women (Plaintiffs) *Defendants: Dr. Quilligan and obstetricians at USC * Decision made on June 7, 1978 (Central District of California) * Affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Ninth Circuit * Federal class-action suit * Case not subject to a jury * Wanted compensation, sterilization counseling, and consent forms in Spanish * Doctors accused of having intention to lower birth rate of Mexican women in California, controlling populations * Violation of civil and constitutional rights to bear children *Ruling, judge sided with hospital: no deliberate intent of the doctors to hurt the women. * Women unknowingly signed the paperwork in exchange to receive pain medication after giving birth. Others were also told that the process could be reversed, told that \\"tubes would be tied\\" * Women were working class, independent of government assistance *Case was prompted during the Chicana movement, which clashed with the chicano and women's liberation movement. Because the Chicano movement was led by men who had a very sexist approach, they say the needs of the women only secondary to ending racism. In regards to the Women's liberation movement, while chicanas wanted to have truly informed consent with a waiting period, white feminists opposed this. Instead, they wanted consent straight away. They did not take into account whether the individual could speak English, and could fully comprehend the purpose of a sterilization. Outcome * Changed ways things have been done * Forms in different languages, including Spanish made available * Patients under the age of 21 would have 72 hours to make decision * Welfare benefits would not be revoked * Minorities better informed of their rights regarding sterilization * Establishment of MALDEF CRP in 1974. * Bilingual counselors provided at county hospitals Sterilization in California * Conducted the most sterilizations in the United States * Responsible for at least a quarter of the coerced sterilizations in USA * Passed sterilization law in 1909 and was unopposed for next 70 years * In total, 3 laws were passed in California concerning sterilization * Mexicans were specifically targeted, because it was stereotypically thought that they were diseased and carried tuberculosis * Fueled by immigration anxiety * Targeted by the traditional idea of large Mexican American families * Sterilization legislation used by Nazi Germany * Eugenics was seen as a way to protect society from the offspring of those deemed inferior * Performed 20,000 sterilizations, one-third of those in the nation, 1900s‚Äì1970s * Leader in eugenics movement * Pacific colony, feeble- mindedness * Sterilization bill granted superintendents to asexualize would improve inmate or patient physically, mentally, or morally * Family planning services and population research act, \\"birth curb bill\\" passed.

Patients whose cuffitis is refractory to mesalamine and/or corticosteroids should be evaluated for other disease in the cuff area, such as fistula or anastomotic leaks. Cuffitis that is refractory to medication can also be a sign of Crohn's disease of the pouch. Chronic cuffitis can also contribute to the development of anastomotic stricture. Cuffitis that is refractory, Crohn's-related, or is associated with surgical complications can contribute to pouch failure.  Diagnosis  Definitive diagnose of cuffitis is obtained by endoscopy.

Derwinski is a United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims case that dealt with the \\"benefit of the doubt\\" rule in veterans law.  Background  Mr. Norman Gilbert was claiming service connection for a back injury. Specifically, he claimed that he injured his back while falling with a machine gun in his arms while serving in Korea in 1956. The Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) upheld the denial of the back condition, stating that any residual back injury that occurred during service was acute and transitory in nature. BVA also held that the benefit of the doubt rule did not apply to this case.  Analysis  In this decision, the Court compared and contrasted the various burden of proof against the \\"benefit of the doubt\\" rule. In criminal law, the burden of proof used is beyond a reasonable doubt. Next in the spectrum would be clear and convincing evidence, followed by the \\"fair preponderance\\" standard used in civil litigation. Last in stringency order would be the \\"reasonable doubt standard\\" which is defined regulatorily as: > It is the defined and consistently applied policy of the Department of > Veterans Affairs to administer the law under a broad interpretation, > consistent, however, with the facts shown in every case. When, after careful > consideration of all procurable and assembled data, a reasonable doubt > arises regarding service origin, the degree of disability, or any other > point, such doubt will be resolved in favor of the claimant. By reasonable > doubt is meant one which exists because of an approximate balance of > positive and negative evidence which does not satisfactorily prove or > disprove the claim. It is a substantial doubt and one within the range of > probability as distinguished from pure speculation or remote possibility. It > is not a means of reconciling actual conflict or a contradiction in the > evidence. Mere suspicion or doubt as to the truth of any statements > submitted, as distinguished from impeachment or contradiction by evidence or > known facts, is not justifiable basis for denying the application of the > reasonable doubt doctrine if the entire, complete record otherwise warrants > invoking this doctrine. The reasonable doubt doctrine is also applicable > even in the absence of official records, particularly if the basic incident > allegedly arose under combat, or similarly strenuous conditions, and is > consistent with the probable results of such known hardships. (emphasis > added) The Court, in explaining how this applies to the weighing of evidence in Veterans claims, used a rule used in baseball sandlot folklore that the tie goes to the runner. In other words, when the evidentiary value of the negative evidence against the Veteran's claim is the same as the evidentiary value of the positive evidence for the Veteran's claim, reasonable doubt is resolved in favor of the Veteran. In applying this rule to Mr. Gilbert's claim, the Court noted that BVA had not provided adequate reasons and bases, or a legal explanation in its decision, as to why the benefit of the doubt rule did not apply to the claim. Since there were insufficient reasons and bases, the claim was remanded back to BVA for a new decision.  Decision  The Court remanded the claim back to BVA for a new decision detailing why the Veteran was not entitled to the benefit of the doubt under the law.

Spacecraft Bus is the primary support component of the James Webb Space Telescope, that hosts a multitude of computing, communication, propulsion, and structural components, bringing the different parts of the telescope together.NASA - Spacecraft Bus Along with the Sunshield, it forms the Spacecraft Element of the space telescope. The other two major elements of the JWST are the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) and the Optical Telescope Element (OTE). Region 3 of ISIM is also inside the Spacecraft Bus; region 3 includes ISIM Command and Data Handling subsystem and the MIRI cryocooler. The structure of the Spacecraft Bus must support the 6.5 ton space telescope, while it (just the structure, not the whole bus) itself weighs 350 kg (about 772 lb). It is made primarily of graphite composite material. It was assembled in the U.S. state of California by 2015, and then it had to be integrated with the rest of the space telescope leading up to its planned 2018 launch. The bus can provide pointing of one arcsecond and isolates vibration down to two milliarcseconds (arcseconds are a unit of angle equal to 1/3600 of a degree, see Minute of arc). The fine pointing is done by the JWST fine guidance mirror, not by physically moving the whole mirror or bus. The spacecraft bus is on the sun-facing \\"warm\\" side and operates at a temperature of about 300 kelvins (80 ¬∞F, 27 ¬∞C). Everything on the sun-facing side must be able to handle the thermal conditions of JWST's halo orbit, which has one side of continuous sunlight and the other shaded by the spacecraft sunshield. Another important aspect of the Spacecraft Bus is the central computing, memory storage, and communications equipment. The processor and software direct data to and from the instruments, to the solid-state memory core, and to the radio system which can send data back to Earth and receive commands. The computer also controls the pointing and moment of the spacecraft, taking in sensor data from the gyroscopes and star tracker, and sending the necessary commands to the reaction wheels or thrusters.  Overview Diagram of the Spacecraft Bus. The solar panel is in green and the light purple flats are radiators shades. The Bus is a carbon fibre box that houses a large number of major systems that keep the telescope functioning, such as the solar panels and computers. It also physically houses the Miri cooler and some major ISIM electronics. There are six major subsystems in the Spacecraft Bus. Major subsystems: *Electrical Power Subsystem *Attitude Control Subsystem *Communication Subsystem *Command and Data Handling Subsystem (C&DH;) **Command Telemetry Processor **Solid State Recorder (SSR) *Propulsion Subsystem *Thermal Control Subsystem The spacecraft bus has two star trackers, six reaction wheels, and the propulsion systems (fuel tank and thrusters).EoPortal - JWST Two major tasks are pointing the telescope and performing station keeping for its meta-stable L2 halo orbit. ;Computing and communications The computing systems include a solid- state data memory storage with a capacity of 58.9 GB. The memory storage is called the Solid State Recorder (SSR) and is part of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem. The SSR had a software test program devised to test using a software simulation of the telescope. The communications dish which can point at Earth is attached to the bus. There is Ka-band and S-band radio communication. The Common Command and Telemetry System is based on Raytheon ECLIPSE system. The telescope is designed to communicate with NASA's Deep Space Communication Network. The main Science and Operations Center is the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) which is in the U.S. state of Maryland. ;Rocket engines, attitude control, etc. As of 2012 the propulsion system uses 16 MRE-1 thrusters which can provide one pound of thrust each. They are mono-propellent thrusters designed to survive the unique thermal conditions JWST including extended periods of direct sunlight and light reflected from the sunshield. There is another set of thrusts called the Secondary Combustion Augmentation Thrusters; there are four of these thrusters and they have eight pounds of thrust each. Whereas the smaller thrusters are intended for aiding in precision pointing, the bigger thrusters are planned to be used for station keeping to maintain the telescope's halo orbit. The MRE-1 use hydrazine as a monoproellant and the larger SCAT thrusters are bi- propllant. The SCAT also uses hydrazine (N2H4), but also uses dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as an oxidizer as the two fuels for its two-propellant design.

(each DTM has two engines) **This thruster is a mono-propellant design There is also a tank with helium gas for use as a pressurant. Overall the SCAT thrusters are used for bigger moments and the DTMs for smaller ones. The SCAT engines have a specific impulse of 295 seconds. Like the rest of Webb, including the exposed Beryllium mirrors, it is designed to endure the expected level of micro- meteoroid impacts. JWST also has six reaction wheels for attitude control, which are spinning wheels that allow the orientation to be changed without necessarily using propellant to change momentum. The reaction wheels can only provide a certain amount of change in angular momentum. There is set of small thrusters that can be used in conjunction with reaction wheels, which are also limited, but by the amount of propellant on board. To detect changes in direction JWST uses Hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG).JWST FAQ HRG are expected to be more reliable than the gas-bearing gyroscopes that were a reliability issue on Hubble Space Telescope (HST), but they cannot point as finely which is overcome by the JWST fine guidance mirror. The problem with HST gyroscopes was eventually tracked down; engineers determined that the gyro failures were caused by corrosion of electric wires powering the motor that was initiated by oxygen-pressurized air used to deliver the thick suspending fluid. HST got all-new gyros in 2009, assembled using pressurized nitrogen, and they are expected to be more reliable. ;Thermal Thermal systems on the bus include the Deployable Radiator Shade Assemblies.Status of the JWST Sunshield and Spacecraft There are two, called DRSA-V and DRSA-H, for vertical and horizontal respectively (with respect to the coordinate system of the spacecraft bus). The membrane that makes of the DRSA is a coated Kapton membrane. Other thermal elements on the outside include a small radiator for the battery. There is also a narrow lower-fixed radiator shade, also made of coated Kapton membrane. The coating of the membrane is silicon and VPA. Other areas of the outside are covered with JWST multi-layer insulation (MLI). =Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS)= The Electrical Power Subsystem provides electricity to the JWST spacecraft. It consists of a set of solar panels and rechargeable batteries., a solar array regulator (SAR), a power control unit (PCU), and a telemetry acquisition unit (TAU). The solar panels convert sunlight directly into electricity. This raw power is fed to the SAR which consists of four redundant buck converters each operating with a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm. While the output voltage is not strictly regulated, the buck converters will not allow the spacecraft main bus voltage to drop below about 22 volts, or rise above about 35 volts. With every science instrument and all support circuits \\"on\\" simultaneously, approximately three of the four redundant converters could handle all of the power required. Typically one or two converters need be operating at a time with the other two on active standby. The PCU (Power Control Unit) consists mainly of electronic switches that turn each science instrument or support device on or off under control of the central computer. Each switch allows power to flow to its selected instrument from the SAR. Communications with the central computer is via a 1553 bus. In addition to the power switches, processors for the SAR MPPT algorithm are located in the PCU, along with some telemetry processors, processors to detect when the spacecraft has disconnected from the launch upper stage, and some cryo-cooler controllers. The TAU (Telemetry Acquisition Unit) consists of electronic switches for various heaters for the \\"hot\\" sides of the telescope. In addition, there are switches for the deployment actuators, and the bulk of the telemetry processors (e.g. measuring temperatures, electric power, fuel levels, etc.). The TAU communicates with the central computer via 1553 bus. Both the PCU and TAU contain completely redundant systems with one active while the other is in standby mode or off, completely. The rechargeable batteries of JWST are the lithium-ion type. The batteries use the Sony 18650 hard carbon cell technology. The batteries are designed to endure spaceflight, and should sustain 18 thousand charge- discharge cycles. The solar panel is in what's called a \\"tail-dragger\\" configuration and includes five segments. Each solar panel structure support is honey-comb carbon fiber composite. Some early configurations of the Bus had two solar panel wings, one on each side. Part of the JWST program design was to allow different design variations to \\"compete\\" with each other. =Structure= Although the Bus will operate in the weightless environment of outer space, during launch it must survive the equivalent of 45 tons. The structure can support 64 times its own weight.James Webb Space Telescope spacecraft inches towards full assembly 2015 The Spacecraft Bus is connected to the Optical Telescope Element via the Deployable Tower Assembly, which also connects to the sunshield.Neil English - Space Telescopes: Capturing the Rays of the Electromagnetic Spectrum - Page 290 (Google Books On the other side the Bus connects to the launch vehicle with a strong cone. This is where the observatory attaches to the launch vehicle, and why it must support the weight, plus forces from acceleration during launch. Afterwards it must cleanly separate from the launch stage. The rest of the telescope must be strongly attached to the bus, as it points and thrusts the telescope to its correct location, orbit, and orientation. The structure of the bus walls are made of carbon fiber composite and graphite composite. The bus is 3508 mm (3.5 meters 11.5 feet) long without the solar arrays. From one edge of an extended radiator shade to another it is 6775 mm wide (6.7 m 22.23 feet); this includes the length of the two two-meter-wide radiator shades. The tail-dragger solar array is 5900 mm long (5.9m 19.36 feet) but it is normally at an angle of 20 degrees towards the sunshield. The array is in front of the sunshield segments shield deployment boom, which at the end of it also has a trim tab attached. The bus structure itself weighs 350 kg (about 772 lb). Once JWST is launched, it begins to unfolded and extend to its operating configuration. The plan is that during its first week another part of JWST (the deployable tower) will extend, which will separate the bus from the upper spacecraft by about 2 meters. Testing: JWST IV and V Simulation and Test (JIST) Solid State Recorder (SSR) Simulator  A software simulation of the Solid-State Recorder was developed for testing purposes, which supports the overall software simulation of JWST. This is called the JIST SSR simulator, and was used to test flight software with SpaceWire and MIL-STD-1553 communication, as it relates to the SSR. An Excalibur 1002 Single Board Computer ran the test software. The SSR test software an extension of the JIST software which is called JWST Integrated Simulation and Test core (JIST). JIST brings together software simulations of JWST hardware with actual JWST software, to allow virtual testing. The simulated SSR was created to support making a software test version of the JWST, to help validate and test the flight software for the telescope. In other words, rather than using an actual test hardware version of the SSR, there is a software program that simulates how the SSR works, which runs on another piece of hardware. The SSR is part of the Command and Data Handling Subsystem.  Construction  The Deployable Tower Assembly(DTA) is where the Spacecraft Bus connects to Optical Telescope Element. When it extends, it moves the bus farther away from the main mirror, creating a space for the sunshield layers. The spacecraft element is made by Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems. The sunshield and Bus are planned to be integrated in 2017.Astrophycis Update 2015 - Paul Hertz In 2014 Northrop Grumman began construction of several spacecraft bus components including the gyroscopes, fuel tanks, and solar panels. On May 25, 2016, the spacecraft's panel integration was completed. The overall spacecraft bus structure was completed by October 2015. The spacecraft bus was assembled at facilities in Redondo Beach, California in the United States. The completed spacecraft bus was powered on for first time in early 2016. The solar arrays completed a preliminary design audit in 2012, moving to the detailed design phase. Fuel and oxidizer tanks were shipped out to assembly in September 2015. In 2015 the communications subsystems, star trackers, reaction wheels, fine sun sensors, deployment electronics Unit, command telemetry processors, and wire harnesses were delivered for construction. The spacecraft bus will be assembled with the Spacecraft Element and the other parts in California. For launch, the spacecraft bus is attached to the Ariane 5 on a Cone 3936 plus ACU 2624 lower cylinder and clamp-band. It is a contained launch fairing 4.57 meters (15 ft) and 16.19 meters (53.1 ft) of usable interior length.  Gyroscopes  JWST uses a type of gyroscope known as a hemispherical resonator gyroscope (HRG). This design has no bearings, rubbing parts, or flexible connections. This is not a traditional mechanical gyroscope; instead, an HRG has a quartz hemisphere vibrating that vibrates at its resonant frequency in a vacuum. Electrodes detect changes if the spacecraft moves to collect the desired information, and the design is predicted to have a mean time before failure of 10 million hours. Gyroscopes failed on several occasions on the Hubble Space Telescope and had to be replaced several times. However, these were a different design called a gas-bearing gyroscope, which have certain benefits, but experienced some long-term reliability issues. JWST will have six gyroscopes, but only two are required for pointing. JWST does not need as precise pointing because it has a Fine Steering Mirror that helps counter small motions of the telescope. The JWST telescope still has spinning reaction wheels, which can be adjusted to point the telescope without using propellant. The gyroscopes are sensors that provide information, while the reaction wheels are devices that physically change the orientation of the spacecraft. JWST has both reaction wheels and gyroscopes, which work together with the other systems to keep the telescope in the right orbit and pointed in the desired direction. There are two main traditional uses for gyroscopes in a spacecraft: to detect changes in orientation, and to actually change the orientation. JWST uses HRG as sensors to detect changes in orientation as opposed to actual spinning gyroscopes. However, it also has a set of actual spinning reaction wheels to turn the telescope without using propellant. It also has a set of small thrusters that can physically change the attitude of the telescope.  Docking ring  Orion capsule In 2007, NASA said that JWST will also have a docking ring which would be attached to the telescope to support JWST being visited by an Orion spacecraft if such a mission became viable. An example of a mission was if everything worked but an antenna did not fold out. Two noted cases where small problems caused issues for space observatories includes Spacelab 2 IRT, and Gaia- in each case stray material caused issue. On theInfrared Telescope (IRT) flown on the Space Shuttle Spacelab-2 mission, in a piece of mylar insulation broke loose and floated into the line-of-sight of the telescope corrupting data.Kent, et al. ‚Äì Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope (1992). This was on the STS-51-F in the year 1985. Another case was in the 2010s on the Gaia spacecraft for which some stray light was identified coming from fibers of the sunshield, protruding beyond the edges of the shield. Integration The Spacecraft Bus is integrated into the whole JWST during construction. The Spacecraft Bus and the Sunshield segment are combined into what's called the Spacecraft Element, which is in turn combined with a combined structure of the Optical Telescope Element and Integrated Science Instrument Module called OTIS. That is the whole observatory, which is mounted to a cone which connects the JWST to the last stage of the Ariane 5 rocket. The Spacecraft Bus is where that cone connects to the rest of JWST.

He is the Jack and DeLoris Lange Professor of Molecular Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco, where he works together with his wife Lily Jan as co-PIs of the Jan Lab. Biography Jan was born in Shanghai, China to a family from Jiangxi. His birthday is officially listed as December 20, 1946, but that is according to the Chinese calendar and corresponds to January 11, 1947 of the Western calendar. In 1949, his family escaped to Xinpu, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Although Jan attended a prestigious public school like his future wife Lily Jan his talents in science remained undiscovered until he excelled in a nationwide college entrance exam placing in the top 10 out of 30,000 students. Jan would go on to attend National Taiwan University (NTU) for his undergraduate studies where he earned his B.S. in physics in 1968. Jan fulfilled his military service as a communication and electronics officer in the Taiwanese Air Force. Jan has shared the year of his service he purchased a motorcycle so he could sneak off the base to visit Lily Jan who he had met earlier during a weeklong hiking trip in 1967. Lily Jan was a fellow student studying physics at National Taiwan University and would become his future wife. At the time, both of the Jans were interested in pursuing advanced studies in theoretical high-energy physics and applied to graduate school abroad. They were both accepted to the physics program at CalTech. They were the only two students to be accepted from NTU, a major academic achievement given how few foreign students were accepted to the program at the time and especially so from their university. In line with his research interests as an undergraduate, Jan began his graduate studies at Caltech with the intention to study theoretical physics. However, research seminars at Caltech and a conversation with Max Delbr√ºck, a winner of the 1969 Nobel Prize, inspired Yuh Nung to switch fields to biology. Max Delbr√ºck would become his Ph.D. advisor which was particularly formative given that Delbr√ºck was also a physicist who later switched fields to biological physics. Jan's Ph.D. studies were focused on studying the perception of sensory signals by a single-celled fungus. Although he was in the same thesis lab as Lily Jan, their research paths were distinct and they would in fact not begin their life-long scientific collaboration or publish together until after they graduated Caltech with their degrees. As he approached graduation, Yuh Nung would come across a publication by the scientist Seymour Benzer detailing opportunities associated with correlating fly embryo morphology with functional behavior. Inspired by opportunities associated with such lines of research, Yuh Nung decided to pursue post-doctoral studies in the field. In preparation for this shift in research, he and Lily Jan spent a summer at Cold Spring Harbor learning techniques in experimental neuroscience. This would mark the start of their life-long collaboration in the experimental laboratory and later in their roles as independent investigators. Upon joining the Benzer laboratory as post-docs later that year, they would build their first experimental set-up together, an electrophysiology rig. Their early collaborative research in the Benzer group was focused on uncovering the basis for defects in synaptic transmission. A series of mutant flies, named Shaker, with uncontrolled muscle contractions proved crucial to these endeavors and set the stage for some of their most significant contributions in the field of neuroscience. The Jans would later moved to Harvard Medical School for a second postdoc with Steven Kuffler. Jan and his wife then joined the faculty at UCSF in 1979 where they are co-PIs of the Jan Lab and have won numerous awards together. Jan has been an Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator since 1984.

In 1971, Lily and Yuh-Nung married with a simple ceremony in a Los Angeles courthouse followed by a celebration camping and hiking in Yosemite. The Jans had their first child together a daughter, Emily Huan-Ching Jan, on August 6, 1977. Remarkably, Lily Jan was still involved in research leading up to her due date and went into early stages of labor in the midst of Seymour Benzer's group meeting. Just seven weeks later after celebrating the arrival of Emily, the Jans would move across the country to begin the next stages of their research careers at Harvard Medical School. Just a few years later, the Jans had established their independent research group at UCSF. In 1984, they were named Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators. That same year on November 7, 1984 the Jans welcomed their second child a son named Max Huang-Wen Jan after the Jans‚Äô Ph.D. adviser, Max Delbruck. The Jans have shared that before their children went to college they rarely attended scientific meetings together such that there was always one parent at home with their children. Outside of the lab, they have continued to enjoy their shared interest in exploration and hiking throughout their careers. And in 2011, after their visiting professorship at the Chinese Academy of the Sciences the Jans accomplished one of their lifelong goals together, seeing Mt. Everest from the base camp in Tibet.
