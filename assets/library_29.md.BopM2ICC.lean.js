Schuster (1873-1972) was the driver of the American built Thomas Flyer and winner of the 1908 New York to Paris Race. The \\"Great Race\\" was an international competition among teams representing Germany (Protos), Italy (Brixia-Zust), France (three teams: DeDion-Bouton, Moto Bloc, Sizaire- Naudin) and the United States (Thomas Flyer). Schuster's victory for the American entry still stands nearly a century later. Schuster was also the first person to drive across the United States during the winter in an automobile. The 22,000 mile course (13,341 miles driven) started February 12, 1908 in Times Square with a crowd of 250,000 watching the start of what would become a 169-day ordeal. The Race began in mid-winter at a time when there were no snowplows, few roads on the around the world route, unreliable maps, and often little food for the competitors. The original plan was to drive the cars the full distance from New York City to Paris using the frozen Bering Straits to \\"bridge\\" the Pacific. This proved impossible, requiring the competitors to cross the Pacific by ship. The Flyer arrived in Paris July 30, 1908 to win although the German Protos had actually arrived there four days before; race officials decided to penalize the Germans for having shipped their car via rail for part of the route rather than it having traveled the entire land portion of the route under its own power as the organizers had envisioned. Of the six teams that started the race, only three finished in Paris; the German Protos, the Italian Briax-Zust, and the American Thomas Flyer; the French Sizaire team had never made it out of New York State. Schuster was chosen to be part of the Thomas Race Team due to his proven mechanical abilities, which were put to daily use during the Race. Schuster was the only American team member aboard the Flyer from its start in New York City to the finish in Paris. Schuster's start in the automotive industry had been building tubular radiators in October 1902 for the E.R. Thomas Motor Company at the Buffalo, New York factory. From there he quickly progressed to become the troubleshooter for Thomas, in charge of final vehicle assembly and often delivering Thomas cars to their new owners. In the early 1900s, first- time auto owners or their chauffeurs were taught by factory or dealer representatives not only how to care for their new machines but often also how to drive them. Schuster was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame on October 12, 2010.

Stanton received an honorary award from Kentucky governor Wallace Wilkinson, who named Stanton a Kentucky Colonel. =Largo, Florida= Stanton was hired away from Berea to become assistant city manager in Largo, Florida in August 1990. Stanton worked under city manager Stephen Bonczek until April 20, 1993 when Bonczek resigned under pressure from city commissioners, who were unhappy with Bonczek's poor relationship with city workers and unions. At that point Stanton became interim city manager, and was formally hired as acting city manager in May 1993 (with a consequent rise in salary). City commissioners cited their confidence in Stanton, as well as the time and cost of recruiting a replacement for Bonczek, as their reason for hiring in-house. City Clerk Henry Schubert was reassigned at the same time to the post of assistant city manager. Both assignments were open-ended, with the commission delaying its decision on a permanent city manager until later that year. Stanton's posting was made permanent in September 1993, with an 18-month contract and another increase in salary.Davis, Amelia, \\"Largo manager now permanent.\\" St. Petersburg Times, 8 September 1993.

Stanton decided to continue her long professional career in public policy and politics while undergoing gender transition. Stanton appeared in public for the first time as a woman on May 9, 2007. Stanton lobbied Congress on behalf of laws to protect gay and transgender people from employment discrimination. Stanton testified before Congress, appeared on TV with Larry King and Montel Williams and became the somewhat reluctant face of the transgender-equality movement. Susan applied for more than 100 positions in city management, but had interviewed in less than half a dozen cities. Atlanta's Gay Pride Parade asked Stanton to be grand marshal. A Chicago transgender convention invited her to speak. The City of Sarasota named Stanton a finalist for its city manager job. Stanton was eventually named third for the position as city manager in Sarasota, FL, but didn't get the job. =Lake Worth, Florida= Two years after losing her job as Largo city manager, Susan Stanton was picked to lead Lake Worth, Florida. Stanton was selected as City Manager of Lake Worth, Florida, on April 7, 2009 by a 4-1 vote. Lake Worth City Commissioner Suzanne Mulvehill said she liked Stanton's approach to marketing the city and her ability to work for such a long time in Largo. Commissioner Cara Jennings said she favored Stanton because of her team-building approach to managing city staff. Vice Mayor Jo-Ann Golden stated, \\"I thought she had the right temperament for our city and, truthfully, I learned a lot from her.\\" Mac Craig, City of Largo's current manager, stated, \\"I think she'll make an excellent city manager. I personally think they're lucky to have her.\\" Stanton was selected for the job from a group of 50 candidates. Lake Worth, a city of about 37,000 people, near the ocean in Palm Beach County offered Stanton an annual salary of $150,000. Stanton was quoted as saying, \\"Lake Worth has a very progressive city commission and a staff that wants to improve the quality of life in the community. It's the first place I wanted to work after I left graduate school at the University of Florida.\\" She was terminated abruptly from her position at Lake Worth on December 6, 2011. In reflecting upon Stanton's dismissal, the Palm Beach Post noted that during her tenure \\"she dismissed low-performing employees and brought in smart, eager wonks.

More than 100 people packed a five-hour public hearing on the proposed ordinance at Largo's City Hall on August 5, 2003, hearing testimony from over 40 people on both sides of the question. Had the ordinance passed, it would have made Largo the 64th municipality in the United States to extend equal rights protection to transgender people through the inclusion of gender identity. However, the proposed ordinance failed by a 4 to 3 vote of the City Commission, leaving both gender identity and sexual orientation as permissible reasons for Largo residents to be discriminated against in employment, housing, and public accommodations.Tan, Shannon, \\"Largo rights issue passionately debated\\".

The policy included definitions of harassment and retaliation, and explained that sexual harassment could involve individuals of the same or different gender. Extensive training for all city employees was set to take place in November and December 2003, under Stanton's direction in her role as city manager. The policy was passed partly in reaction to two incidents in which a fire department lieutenant and a police officer made racial slurs.Tan, Shannon, \\"Officials revise city policy on conduct\\".

Transgender issues =Struggle with being transgender= Stanton reports having had thoughts of transitioning since she was a child, and recalls wearing her sister's clogs when she was age 6 or 7 to walk to the candy store. In adolescence, she tried on her mother's tennis dress, and while in college she went to the library to read about cross- dressing. After graduation, she threw away all her \\"girl clothes\\" after deciding that cross-dressing was incompatible with a career in municipal government. She continued to collect women's items, but purged them with each new job.Helfand, Lorri, \\"Largo official preparing for sex change.\\" St. Petersburg Times, 21 February 2007.

She and her wife had a son, Travis, in 1993, shortly after she became acting city manager of Largo. However, in 1997 she became involved in an Internet chat group for cross-dressers. =Decision to pursue sex reassignment= Stanton supported the proposed city-wide ordinance, though she did not take a prominent role in the debate that surrounded it. Afterwards, she began to discuss her feelings with a therapist who had testified in support of the ordinance, and ultimately made the decision along with her wife to pursue sex reassignment. Since then, Stanton underwent counseling, with clinical psychologist and gender therapist Kathleen Farrell, and hormone replacement therapy in preparation for sex reassignment surgery at some future date. =Preparing to go public= Stanton met privately with Largo City Mayor Pat Gerard on January 1, 2007 to inform her that she was transgender and intended to begin the final stages of gender transition in the coming year.Porter, Suzette, \\"Stanton tell employees she‚Äôs transgendered in an e-mail.\\" Largo Leader, 23 February 2007.

Camp Mackall is the setting of primary training to become a member of U.S. Army Special Forces. History Originally named Camp Hoffman, on February 8, 1943, General Order Number 6 renamed the facility Camp Mackall in honor of Private John Thomas (Tommy) Mackall. He was born May 17, 1920 in Ohio and grew up in Wellsville, Ohio. He served in Company E, 2nd Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment. During the Allied invasion of North Africa in the airborne segment called Operation Torch, he was mortally wounded in an attack by French Vichy aircraft on his aircraft as the aircraft landed near Oran. Seven paratroopers died at the scene and several were wounded, including Mackall. He was evacuated by air to a British hospital at Gibraltar where he died on November 12, 1942. He had been wounded on November 8, the day that construction began at the camp. He is buried in Glenview Cemetery in East Palestine, Ohio. Historian Stephen E. Ambrose described the camp as a \\"marvel of wartime construction\\", having been converted from 62,000 acres of wilderness to a camp \\"with 65 miles of paved roads, a 1,200-bed hospital, five movie theaters, six huge beer gardens, a complete all-weather airfield with three 5,000-foot runways, and 1,750 buildings\\" in just four months. Facilities The Mackall Army Airfield has two runways: 4/22 is 5,001 by 150 feet (1,524 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface and 11/29 is 4,740 by 150 feet (1,445 x 46 m) with a concrete surface. The Colonel James \\"Nick\\" Rowe Training Compound hosts SERE, SFAS, the Q Course and other training courses. It is named for Col. James N. Rowe. The obstacle course at the camp, arguably the hardest obstacle course in the U.S. Army, is named the \\"Nasty Nick\\" in honor of Rowe.

Created with Soviet assistance in 1954, the outfit monitored all voice and electronic communications inside and outside of Romania. They bugged telephones and intercepted all telegraphs and telex messages, as well as placing microphones in both public and private buildings. Fiction The 1991 Polish comedy film Rozmowy kontrolowane (Monitored Conversations) capitalizes on this fact. The title alludes to the pre-recorded phrase \\"Rozmowa kontrolowana\\" (\\"The talk is being monitored\\") a person repeatedly hears during a phone conversation.

For example, the motion of a particle constrained to lie on the surface of a sphere is subject to a holonomic constraint, but if the particle is able to fall off the sphere under the influence of gravity, the constraint becomes non-holonomic. For the first case the holonomic constraint may be given by the equation: :r^2-a^2=0 where r is the distance from the centre of a sphere of radius a, whereas the second non-holonomic case may be given by: :r^2 - a^2 \\\\geq 0 Velocity- dependent constraints such as: :f(q_1,q_2,\\\\ldots,q_n,\\\\dot{q}_1,\\\\dot{q}_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\dot{q}_n,t)=0 are not usually holonomic. Holonomic system (physics) In classical mechanics a system may be defined as holonomic if all constraints of the system are holonomic. For a constraint to be holonomic it must be expressible as a function: : f(x_1,\\\\ x_2,\\\\ x_3,\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ x_N,\\\\ t)=0, \\\\, i.e. a holonomic constraint depends only on the coordinates x_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and time t\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. It does not depend on the velocities or any higher order derivative with respect to t. A constraint that cannot be expressed in the form shown above is a nonholonomic constraint. =Transformation to independent generalized coordinates= The holonomic constraint equations can help us easily remove some of the dependent variables in our system. For example, if we want to remove x_d\\\\,\\\\\\\\! which is a parameter in the constraint equation f_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, we can rearrange the equation into the following form, assuming it can be done, :x_d=g_i(x_1,\\\\ x_2,\\\\ x_3,\\\\ \\\\dots,\\\\ x_{d-1},\\\\ x_{d+1},\\\\ \\\\dots,\\\\ x_N,\\\\ t), \\\\, and replace the x_d\\\\,\\\\\\\\! in every equation of the system using the above function. This can always be done for general physical system, provided that f_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is C^1\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, then by the implicit function theorem, the solution g_i\\\\, is guaranteed in some open set. Thus, it is possible to remove all occurrences of the dependent variable x_d\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Suppose that a physical system has N\\\\,\\\\\\\\! degrees of freedom. Now, h\\\\,\\\\\\\\! holonomic constraints are imposed on the system. Then, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced to m=N - h\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. We can use m\\\\,\\\\\\\\! independent generalized coordinates (q_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\!) to completely describe the motion of the system. The transformation equation can be expressed as follows: :x_i=x_i(q_1,\\\\ q_2,\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ q_m,\\\\ t)\\\\ ,\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad i=1,\\\\ 2,\\\\ \\\\ldots N. \\\\, =Differential form= Consider the following differential form of a constraint equation: : \\\\sum_j\\\\ c_{ij} \\\\, dq_j+c_i \\\\, dt=0; \\\\, where cij, ci are the coefficients of the differentials dqj and dt for the ith constraint. If the differential form is integrable, i.e., if there is a function f_i(q_1,\\\\ q_2,\\\\ q_3,\\\\ \\\\ldots,\\\\ q_N,\\\\ t)=0\\\\,\\\\\\\\! satisfying the equality : df_i=\\\\sum_j\\\\ c_{ij} \\\\, dq_j+c_i \\\\, dt=0,\\\\, then this constraint is a holonomic constraint; otherwise, nonholonomic. Therefore, all holonomic and some nonholonomic constraints can be expressed using the differential form. Not all nonholonomic constraints can be expressed this way. Examples of nonholonomic constraints which can not be expressed this way are those that are dependent on generalized velocities. With a constraint equation in differential form, whether the constraint is holonomic or nonholonomic depends on the integrability of the differential form. =Classification of physical systems= In order to study classical physics rigorously and methodically, we need to classify systems. Based on previous discussion, we can classify physical systems into holonomic systems and non-holonomic systems. One of the conditions for the applicability of many theorems and equations is that the system must be a holonomic system. For example, if a physical system is a holonomic system and a monogenic system, then Hamilton's principle is the necessary and sufficient condition for the correctness of Lagrange's equation. =Examples= Pendulum A simple pendulum As shown on the right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string‚Äôs length is a constant. Therefore, this system is holonomic; it obeys the holonomic constraint : {x^2+y^2} - L^2=0, where (x,\\\\ y)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the position of the weight and L\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is length of the string. Rigid body The particles of a rigid body obey the holonomic constraint :(\\\\mathbf{r}_i - \\\\mathbf{r}_j)^2 - L_{ij}^2=0, \\\\, where \\\\mathbf{r}_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, \\\\mathbf{r}_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\! are respectively the positions of particles P_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and P_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, and L_{ij}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is the distance between them.

He played college football at Purdue University and was drafted in the fifth round of the 1971 NFL Draft.  Early life  Donnie Green was the sixth of nine children of Irene and James Green in Annapolis, Maryland, where he attended elementary school. At age 10, his mother died and Green moved to live with his father in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he played football and basketball at Crestwood High School. College Green was recruited by Purdue out of Crestwood high school in Virginia. Green was an AP and UPI All-American in 1970, and also was named a team captain during his senior year. The previous season, Green's blocking played a role in the team finishing with an 8-2 record under head coach Jack Mollenkopf. The quarterback on that team was Mike Phipps, who would be the first round draft choice of the Cleveland Browns in the next NFL draft. That 1969 team finished the season ranked number 18 in the AP poll. While at Purdue, Green majored in Physical Education. In Green's senior year, Purdue went 4-6 under head coach Bob DeMoss, with one of the highlights of the season being an upset 26-14 win over Stanford. Some of Green's teammates on that Purdue squad that would go on to play in the NFL include quarterback Gary Danielson, Running back Otis Armstrong and wide receiver Darryl Stingley. NFL Green was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round (107th player taken overall), one round after Jim Braxton, who'd be a back field mate of O.J. Simpson and part of the Bills famed \\"Electric Co.\\" offense of the 1970s. Green played in ten games his rookie season, starting nine of them as the Bills struggled to an 1-13 record under coach Harvey Johnson. After that season, Johnson was fired and Lou Saban was named as head coach. Saban made Green the full-time starter at right tackle, as the Bills improved to 4-9-1. The next season the Bills improved to 9-5 as Green along with Dave Foley, Reggie McKenzie, Bruce Jarvis, and Joe Delamielleure formed the line that helped Simpson rush for 2,003 yards in a season. In 1974, Green only started 10 games, but he recorded his only pass reception, a one yarder from quarterback Joe Ferguson in a 24-16 loss to the Miami Dolphins. 1975 would be Green's last as a full-time starter. He started all 14 games that year, eleven in 1976. He played for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1977 as a back-up, and spent 1978 seeing spot duty for the Detroit Lions. He retired after that season. Post career and death Green struggled with life after pro football. He soon separated from his wife and battled drug use. He lost the lease on the home he was in and ended up living for a time in a shelter in Hagerstown, Maryland and worked there as a night monitor. On August, 28th, 2019, the Buffalo Bills issued a press release that confirmed that Green had passed away, though an exact cause was not announced.

His novels featured elements of African-American life. He also wrote plays, short stories and essays, and published articles in a range of outlets. Early life and education Killens was born in Macon, Georgia, to Charles Myles Killens, Sr, and Willie Lee Killens. His father encouraged him to read Langston Hughes' writings, and his mother, who was president of the Dunbar Literary Club, introduced him to poetry. Killens was an enthusiastic reader as a child and was inspired by writers such as Hughes and Richard Wright. His great-grandmother‚Äôs tales of slavery were another important factor in his learning traditional black mythology and folklore, which he later incorporated into his writings. Killens graduated in 1933 from the Ballard Normal School in Macon, a private institution run by the American Missionary Association. It was then one of the few secondary schools for blacks in Georgia, which had a segregated system of public schools and historically underfunded those for black students.DesJardines, David E., \\"John Oliver Killens (1916-1987)\\", The New Georgia Encyclopedia. August 22, 2013. Planning to be a lawyer, Killens he attended historically black colleges and universities between 1934 and 1936 to study further at the college level and focus on law: Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, Florida, Morris Brown College in Atlanta, Howard University in Washington, D.C., and in 1939, Robert H. Terrell Law School in Washington, D.C. In his final year, he left in order to study creative writing at Columbia University in New York City. Killens enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, serving as a member of the Pacific Amphibious Forces from 1942 to 1945. He spent more than two years in the South Pacific, and rose to the rank of master sergeant. Literary career In 1948, Killens moved to New York City, where he worked to establish a literary career. He attended writing classes at Columbia University and at New York University. He was an active member of many organizations, serving as a union representative to a local chapter of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and joining the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Around 1950, Killens co-founded with Rosa Guy and others a writers' group that became the Harlem Writers Guild (HWG).\\"About The Harlem Writers Guild (HWG)\\", The Harlem Writers Guild website. His first novel, Youngblood (1954), dealing with a black Georgia family in the early 1900s, was read and developed at HWG meetings in members' homes. Killens became friends with actor Harry Belafonte, who after establishing his production company HarBel wanted to adapt William P. McGivern's crime novel Odds Against Tomorrow as a film. Belafonte picked Abraham Polonsky as the screenwriter, but since Polonsky had been blacklisted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Killens generously agreed to act as his front and was credited with the screenplay for the film. In 1996 the Writers Guild of America restored credit to Polonsky for the film under his own name. Killen's second novel, And Then We Heard the Thunder (1962), was about the treatment of the black soldiers in the military during World War II, when the armed forces were still segregated. Critic Noel Perrin ranked it as one of five major works of fiction of World War II. Killens's third novel, Sippi (1967), focused on the voting rights struggles of African Americans during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Slaves (1969), a historical novel, was developed from the screenplay for the film of the same name, intended to accompany its release.Rivera, Louis Reyes, Lest We Forget, Khandi Pages. First published in New Rain, Vol. 9 (blind beggar press), 1999. In The Cotillion; or, One Good Bull Is Half the Herd (1971), Killens explored upper- class African-American society. In addition to novels, Killens also wrote plays, screenplays, and many articles and short stories. He published these works in a range of media, including The Black Scholar, The New York Times, Ebony, Redbook, Negro Digest and Black World.Samuels, Wilfred D.

Early life Born in Columbus, Indiana, Fehring attended Purdue University, where he starred in football, basketball, and baseball, one of only two Purdue athletes to letter nine times. Fehring helped the Boilermakers win two Big Ten Conference titles in football and a national championship in basketball in 1932, and was the traveling roommate of John Wooden. Fehring was inducted into the inaugural class of the Purdue University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994. Baseball career After graduating from Purdue, Fehring chose to play his favorite sport, baseball, where he excelled as a catcher. He was signed by the Chicago White Sox and made a single major league appearance, in a road game against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium on July 25, 1934. Fehring entered the game in the bottom of the seventh inning to catch, with the Yankees leading 10‚Äì2. During that inning, Lou Gehrig attempted an inside- the-park home run on a ball hit to center field; the ball was relayed to Fehring, who tagged Gehrig out at the plate. Gehrig was credited with a triple on the play; he had already hit a home run, single, and double in the game, thus it became the first time that Gehrig hit for the cycle in his career. Fehring had one at bat during the game, striking out in the ninth inning. Coaching career After his baseball career ended, Fehring returned to Purdue and became their head baseball coach and assistant football coach from 1936 to 1942. After serving in World War II, Fehring was an assistant football coach for two years at Oklahoma and for one year at UCLA, where he recommended his college friend John Wooden for the head basketball coaching vacancy. =Stanford= In 1949, Fehring was hired as an assistant baseball and football coach at Stanford. He took over as head baseball coach in 1956, and coached for 11 years, culminating in a College World Series semifinals appearance in 1967. Along with his football coaching role in the 1952 Rose Bowl, Fehring has the unique distinction as a coach in both a College World Series and a Rose Bowl.

The other Stroboflash models used the same lamp head. Stroboflash is the name of one of the earliest commercially successful portable dry cell battery powered electronic flashes produced. History of development It was designed and initially manufactured in 1942 by Strobo Research, a company founded by Edward Farber and Harold Edgerton that was located in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Stroboflash electronic flashes were used extensively by newspaper photographers as an alternative to flash bulbs. In 1955, Stroboflash was sold by Strobo Research to Graflex, Inc., a now defunct company that also produced sheet film large format cameras and a host of camera accessories and was located in Rochester, New York. There were four models of Stroboflash, aptly designated as Stroboflash I, Stroboflash II, Stroboflash III and Stroboflash IV. The Stroboflash I used two 240 volt dry cell batteries that are no longer made and was the lightest of the four models and produced 50 watt seconds of light power. The Stroboflash II, III and IV were powered by two 225 volt dry cell batteries that are still produced by Eveready, but are now quite expensive (two #489 225 volt batteries hooked up to produce 450 volts). The Stroboflash II and Stroboflash IV were produced by Graflex through 1975, when Graflex, Inc. sold the Stroboflash IV to another company called Graflite that produced it until about 1978, then they also went out of business. The Stroboflash III was only produced for a few years. It put out 200 watt seconds of light power, but could not be turned down. It was replaced by the Stroboflash IV that had four power setting that could be selected via a rotary top mounted switch: 1/4 (50 watt seconds), 1/2 (100 watt seconds), 3/4 (150 watt seconds) and full (200 watt seconds). The Stroboflash II had a constant 100 watt second light output that was not adjustable. Stroboflash Flash features All four Stroboflash models consisted of a power pack that connected to a separate flash head via a power cord and special plug and all used the same Stroboflash flash heads, which were light weight and had a satin reflector that produced very soft, non directional light. Professional photographers used Stroboflash II and IV electronic flashes extensively in the 1950s through 1980s because of the soft, well diffused light they produce. The Stroboflash electronic flash units are still considered flashes that produce excellent quality high power lighting, but the battery expense and the fact that the batteries only produce between 1,000 and 2,000 flashes (depending on the power level selected) and the fact that these flash batteries were not rechargeable led to professionals replacing these flashes with other models that were powered by batteries that could be recharged. Current repairs and updates There is a company that has developed a rechargeable power supply for the Stroboflash II, III, and IV, which plugs right into the Stroboflash power pack instead of the original dry cell batteries and uses two 12 volt rechargeable battery packs. They also repair these flashes. This can be found at Stroboflash.com.

Born in Medway, Massachusetts, the son of Sewall Sanford and Edena Holbrook, Milton Sanford would become one of the town's greatest benefactors. Sanford owned wool and cotton mills and made a fortune manufacturing blankets for the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1883 he built the Sanford Textile Mill in Medway which still stands to this day as a condominium property. Thoroughbred horse racing Wealthy enough to satisfy his passion for Thoroughbred horse racing, Milton H. Sanford owned Preakness Stud at what today is the corner of Valley Road and Preakness Avenue in Preakness, New Jersey as well as the Preakness Stud Farm in Lexington, Kentucky. In the summer of 1868, following a day of racing at Saratoga Race Course, Milton Sanford hosted a now famous dinner party for horsemen and other distinguished guests at the Union Hall Hotel in Saratoga Springs, New York. During the evening, John W. Hunter suggested that the occasion be marked with the creation of a Stakes race to be called the Dinner Party Stakes with a very substantial purse of $15,000. It was agreed that the race be held in the fall of 1870 and be open to three-year-old colts and fillies at a distance of two miles (3 km). Maryland governor Oden Bowie was in attendance and he promised that if the race would be run in Maryland, he would see to it that a new racetrack would be built to host it. As a result, Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore was built and on October 25, 1870 a horse named Preakness owned by Milton Sanford won the inaugural Dinner Party Stakes. The Preakness Stakes, established at Pimlico Race Course in 1873, was named in honor of Sanford's horse. In 1881, the sixty-eight-year-old Milton Sanford sold Preakness Stud in Kentucky to Daniel Swigert who renamed it Elmendorf Farm. He died less than two years later at his summerhouse at 72 Washington Street in Newport, Rhode Island. The property, designed by William Ralph Emerson, is now a bed and breakfast called the Sanford-Covell Villa Marina Milton Sanford is buried in his birthplace of Medway, Massachusetts where Sanford Hall and Sanford Street are named in his honor.

Some 5th graders are regularly allowed to participate, and 4th graders are allowed to participate in rare circumstances. Nazarene Bible Quizzing emphasizes Scripture memorization and application, uses a form of Bible Quiz competition for 6th‚Äì12th grade children all over the world, and is sponsored by the Church of the Nazarene. In Nazarene Bible Quizzing, two or three teams made of up to five members compete against each other with participants jumping off of a chair to answer a question. The jumping triggers an electronic lockout device in the seat, and only the first person to jump may answer the question. Should someone jump before the question is completed, he/she must finish the question and give the answer. In this respect, the competition is similar to other Christian denominational Bible quiz ministries. Each year, the material is chosen from a predetermined list of books in the New Testament. Within each eight-year cycle, Nazarene Bible Quizzing covers over half of the New Testament.  Types of questions  There are eight different types of questions, as follows: *General: A basic question (who, what, where, when, why, how, and so on). *According To: Gives a reference then asks a question, such as, \\"According to Luke chapter 9 verse 60, what was Mary?\\". *Situation: Asks multiple questions out of a single verse then gives a quote, such as, \\"Who said it and to whom, 'Do not be afraid, Zechariah, your prayer has been heard'?\\". *In What Book and Chapter: Gives a quote and the answer is the book and the chapter. *Context: Asks a question out of the context of a verse. *Quote: Gives a reference of a memory verse and the quizzer needs to quote the verse. The quotation must be word perfect. *Finish the Verse: Starts quoting a verse and the quizzer finishes, word perfect. *Reference: Starts quoting a verse, and quizzer must finish and give the reference, word perfect. Each round consists of 20 question: 11 general questions, 4 according-to questions and 1 question from each of the 5 remaining categories ‚Äì which depend on the predetermined books studied. \\"Situation\\" questions are only used when the book(s) being studied are that of a story or an actual timeline (Matthew, Luke, John, Acts) ‚Äì otherwise, \\"In What Book and Chapter\\" questions are used in the years where the letters are being studied (Hebrews and 1 and 2 Peter, Romans and James, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians-Ephesians-Philippians- Colossians-Philemon).2002 Nazarene Quizzing Rules Accessed March 11, 2012.

There are National Track competitions at the following levels: Districts ‚Äì This is the basic officially sanctioned level of quizzing. Local teams attend monthly meets in order to practice and to give their quizzers the opportunity to qualify for the end-of-the-year regional quiz. Normally, the top ten quizzers from the final district meet are sent in two separate teams (A and B) to the regional quiz. District meets tend to be fairly casual and laidback, providing low-pressure quizzing that allows quizzers to make mistakes and get feedback. District meets also allow quizzers to meet new people that attend nearby churches and make new friends. Fields ‚Äì This event consists of teams from the same region. The United States has eight fields (formerly called regions), each being associated with one of the Nazarene Universities located in the United States. Quizzers qualify for field-level competition based on the final meet in their district, which typically takes place in March or April. Teams first play in a round-robin tournament, then the 16 quizzers (or 24 in some regions) with the best scores compete in a quiz-off. The top ten quizzers from the quiz-off are again split into two separate teams (A and B) and sent to Nationals. After the quiz-off, district teams compete in a double- elimination tournament to decide a Field Champion. This has no bearing on the teams that attend Nationals. Typically, 80 quizzers from among all the regions will qualify to quiz at Nationals. However, this can vary slightly if a Region only brings one team, eleven quizzers, or if a team from a field outside of the United States (usually an Asia-Pacific team consisting of missionary youth) join Nationals. Nationals ‚Äì Nationals take place at the General Assembly of the Nazarene Conference or at the Nazarene Youth Conference (these events are held once every two years and alternate so that each event occurs only once every four years), as well as at a Q event held at one of the Nazarene Universities. The top quizzers from English-speaking countries compete. The top quizzers are chosen through one of the eight field competitions that occur in March, April, and May. The field teams normally participate in a double round robin tournament, receive seedings ranging from 1 to 8, and then participate in a double-elimination tournament. At the end of the quizzing, the teams are ranked 1‚Äì8, A-division quizzers 1‚Äì40, and the B-division quizzers 1‚Äì40 (41‚Äì80 if considered on an A/B combined scale). A Q event also includes quizzes for local churches and districts. Teams that participate in these quizzes compete in either the novice or the experienced division. The General Assembly and Nazarene Youth Conference events only hold the field-level competition. Non-National Track quizzes are of two styles: Invitational ‚Äì This quiz meet style does not mean that all teams require an invitation but that some qualification process is required to attend. The only true Non-National invitational is the St. Louis Top Ten. This quiz can only be attended by the A and B teams from a district. It is notable because it is the only Non-National competition that discourages local church teams from attending and encourages A and B district teams to attend. It is always held in early December, halfway through the season. The Tri-State tournament is similar to a true invitational because any team that is not located on the Mount Vernon Nazarene University Field that wishes to compete must be invited based on performances at other tournaments and at Q events. A team will typically play against the 8 or 9 other teams in its randomly assigned division. All of the teams are then sorted into new divisions based on their records such that they play against teams of similar skill during the tournament. Each new division has a round-robin tournament, and the top-three teams from each new division are given awards. Individual quizzers are ranked and awarded based on their performance in the pre-tournament rounds. Tournament ‚Äì This quiz meet style is similar to an invitational but is open to quizzers and teams of all skill levels and abilities. This level of competition allows experienced quizzers to compete with others of the same caliber from around the country. Most tournaments tend to host teams from 2‚Äì4 different regions. Like invitationals, tournaments use divisional round-robins to determine seeding for the afternoon tournament. Unlike invitationals, tournaments tend to use elimination-style competition rather than round robins to determine the winning teams. Also, District A and B teams, or \\"cup teams\\", are strictly forbidden from quizzing at these events. However, churches can combine teams under extenuating circumstances.

Isle Royale was launched by Todd Pacific Shipyards, Inc. of Seattle, Washington on 19 September 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Greer A. Duncan; and delivered to the Navy on 2 July 1946 for layup in the San Diego Reserve Fleet. During her period of inactivation, Isle Royale served as headquarters ship for the San Diego Subgroup, Pacific Reserve Fleet. She was designated to replace the in the active fleet, and commissioned at Long Beach, California on 9 June 1962, taking Hamuls officers and men as that ship decommissioned. After shakedown, Isle Royale moved to Long Beach to begin her services to Pacific Fleet destroyers, supplying them with parts and vital repair facilities. Service history The tender sailed for Pearl Harbor on 8 February 1963 and for the next seven months served the destroyers roaming the Pacific on their vital peacekeeping mission. She returned to Long Beach from this deployment on 11 September 1963 and conducted training operations in California waters until June 1964. The ship then got underway again for Pearl Harbor, where she operated until 30 October. She returned to Long Beach 5 November where she operated until departing 3 August 1965 for a scheduled six-month mid-Pacific cruise. However, upon arriving Pearl Harbor, she received orders to proceed on to the Philippines where she tended ships of the 7th Fleet fighting in Vietnam. Isle Royale earned one campaign star for Vietnam War service. Isle Royale returned to Long Beach on 5 March 1966 and operated along the West Coast until sailing again for the Far East on 16 September. She remained in the Orient operating primarily out of Subic Bay tending the destroyers of the 7th Fleet until her return to Long Beach on 12 April 1967. Thereafter Isle Royale operated in waters off southern California preparing for future action. After she was decommissioned on 11 March 1970, Isle Royale was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September 1976. Custody was transferred to the Maritime Administration, for disposal; Isle Royale was sold by MARAD on 1 December 1977, to Waterman Supply Co. who stripped her any usable parts before selling the hulk to International Steel Co. for scrap.

The character is the son of wealthy businessman, Alan Spaulding, and his former wife, Hope Bauer. Alan-Michael was born on-screen on September 23, 1981, but this was subsequently revised to 1970 when he turned 17 years old and then later to 1965 or 1966 during his brief dalliance with Marina Cooper in 2006. Four actors have regularly portrayed the character, the most recent being Michael Dempsey from November 2005 to May 2007. Rick Hearst was the actor who portrayed him the longest, and is arguably the best known for the role. He was nominated for four Daytime Emmy Awards, winning his first in 1991.Rick Hearst's awards page at IMDB.com The child who played him at birth was a baby girl named Jessica Zutterman. Carl T. Evans introduced the teenage character on July 4, 1987, when Alan-Michael literally parachuted onto the annual Bauer barbecue. He played Alan-Michael until 1990 when Rick Hearst took over the character, playing him for six years. When he left, Michael Dietz was recast briefly (July 3, 1996, to February 7, 1997). In 2005, Guiding Light reintroduced the character with Michael Dempsey in the role. Family troubles Alan-Michael was raised to adulthood by his mother in New York City and lived near his great great Aunt Trudy Bauer Palmer until he came to Springfield to live with his father when he was 17 years old. Until recently, he was the only biological son of his father, Alan Spaulding. Despite this, his adopted older brother, Phillip, seemed to be Alan's favorite and was groomed to take over the business while Alan-Michael was often left feeling overlooked and unloved. He is heavily influenced by his desire to be nothing like his father and brother on a personal level and his deep-rooted need to prove that he's just as capable as they are in business. While Alan and Philip are wholly proud of being Spauldings, Alan-Michael has always seen it as a mixed blessing, and sometimes more of a curse. He also has a deep-seated need for his father's approval which is usually at odds with his disdain for him. Conversely, he is much closer with his Aunt Alexandra who is usually an ally to him in business as well as personal matters. Between 1992 and 1993, Alan- Michael was the only Spaulding by blood residing in Springfield, with Alan in prison, Philip and Beth out of town, and Alexandra out on a mission to find herself. Roger Thorpe took this opportunity to use Alan-Michael's inexperience to take over Spaulding Enterprises which he did with the help of jewel thief Jenna Bradshaw who claimed that her late father was responsible for the invention which brought Spaulding to the top of the business world. Ousted from his family's company, Alan-Michael searched desperately for Alexandra to no avail. Just when it seemed all was hopeless, Alexandra returned, and with the help of Bess Lowell (Brandon Spaulding's former executive secretary), they were able to regain control at Spaulding. As a reward, Bess received a great deal of money from Alexandra and gave Alan-Michael $1,000,000 to start his own business. The feisty senior citizen remarked to him that had she been born 50 years later, they would have made history. When Alan was released from prison, he utilized each of his family members to cause tension so he could take back over Spaulding, but when he came to an agreement with Alexandra, they made Alan-Michael president with the two of them sharing the title of heads of the board of directors. Alan-Michael's issues concerning girlfriend Lucy Cooper and psychotic Spaulding enterprises employee Brent Lawrence distracted him, and after his brother Philip's return, Alan-Michael and Lucy left town. Alan- Michael, despite being a member of the richest and arguably most powerful family in Springfield, resided at The Beacon Hotel upon his return due mainly to his tempestuous relationship with his father. In 2007, he was forced to leave Springfield after Alan framed him for embezzlement, stating that he wouldn't lose another son to a vendetta (referring to Phillip's past troubles). Family Alan-Michael is the only child born to the brief marriage of Alan Spaulding and Hope Bauer. His parents were mismatched from the beginning, and their relationship was fraught with difficulties. Alan's affair with Vanessa Chamberlain Reardon finally ended the marriage, which led Hope to drink. Her battle with alcoholism continued throughout Alan-Michael's early years. In 1986, Alan-Michael fell in love with Dinah Marler. However, Cameron Stewart tried to break the couple up. Later that year, Harley Cooper came to town. Harley, who loved Cameron, teamed up with Alan-Michael to stop Dinah and Cameron from getting closer. Much to their schemes, Dinah and Cameron could not resist temptation and began dating. Cameron left Harley and Alan-Michael was dumped by Dinah. So Alan-Michael wanted to get even so he and Harley began having sex. Alan-Michael wanted to gain his trust fund but learned from Alexandra that Alan would only let him have it if he was married or until he decides it's the right time. When Alan-Michael married Harley Cooper in 1988, his mother refused to attend, since Alan would be present at the wedding. Alan-Michael only married Harley to gain his trust fund in 1988, but despite his failure in that endeavour, he ended up falling in love with her. The marriage didn't last, however, because Alan made it seem like Harley had cheated on Alan-Michael, leading him to sleep with his brother, Phillip's wife Christina \\"Blake\\" Thorpe, who wanted to get even with Phillip who left her for Beth, who returned to town. Blake, who pretended she was pregnant, coerced Alan-Michael into divorcing Harley and marrying her so that she could continue to interfere with Beth and Phillip. Not long after their marriage, Blake faked a miscarriage, but the truth about her fake pregnancy was found out. Alan-Michael left Blake, but throughout the early 1990s, he and Blake would team up to feud with Alan. Alan-Michael soon fell in love with and married Eleni Andros. Eleni, however, had conceived a child before they married, thinking it was Alan-Michael's; when it was revealed to be Frank Cooper's instead, Eleni left Alan-Michael to marry Frank. Heartbroken yet again, Alan-Michael took over Spaulding Enterprises. He would date Josh's ex Tangie Hill in 1994, who also flirted with Alan, much to Josh's dislike. However, his heart would later be wooed by Lucy Cooper in 1995 whom he'd marry before leaving town in 1997. During this time, Alan-Michael's ex, Dinah Marler, returned to town, vowing revenge for leaving her to marry Harley Cooper all those years ago. Knowing how much the Spauldings, especially Alan Michael, had hatred for Roger Thorpe, Dinah saw a chance at getting even by marrying Roger, trying to make Alan-Michael jealous, however he was trying to break up Lucy and Brent Lawerence. So, Dinah gave up, but continued to marry Roger in order to gain her Trust Fund. Lucy left the crazy Brent Lawerence and went back to Alan-Michael in the summer of 1995. Alan-Michael and Gilly Grant teamed up in late 1995 and early 1996 to help Reva Shayne convince Josh and Annie Dutton to agree over joint custody of Marah and Shayne. Alan-Michael would return in 2005, divorced from Lucy. He and Marina Cooper (ironically, the child Eleni had conceived with Frank) would have a brief courtship between 2005 and 2006, and he later had a courtship with Ava Peralta before leaving Springfield again.

He lives and works in Sofia. A graduate of the Academy for Fine Arts \\"Nicolae Grigorescu\\" in Bucharest, Romania (1970‚Äì1975), under Professor Paul Vasilescu's beneficial guidance, Ivan Minekov's striking talent quickly attracted the attention of the Bulgarian artistic society. Aleksandar Stamboliyski, monument by Ivan Minekov In the early years of his career, Ivan Minekov participated in all common exhibitions in Bulgaria, as well as in representative exhibitions in Europe. In the period between 1975 and 1990 he completed a number of large monumental works in many Bulgarian cities, among which his native Pazardzhik, Burgas (1978), Rousse, Lovech, Dorkovo and others. In the same period he was included in the Encyclopedia of Bulgarian Fine Arts. The Bulgarian National Television produced a short film about his monumental work Levski (1987) and a documentary about the artist (1988), which is now included in BNT's golden fund. Also in 1988, Minekov's work was chosen as a symbol of the second allied space journey of Bulgaria and Russia. The portrait of Professor Denton Cooley (1990), founder of the Texas Heart Institute, owned and deeply appreciated by Mr. Cooley, as well as Georges Ecly's interest towards Minekov's art, opened the doors to a rewarding international artistic career. In 1993-94 the Harada Collection in Tokyo commissioned Ivan Minekov to create the portrait of Peter Michailov and in the year of 2000, Minekov's inclination towards mythology and history brought to life Dimitar Peshev's portrait, honoring the great politician for saving the Bulgarian Jews in World War II. The bust has proudly found its place in the Palace of Europe in Strasbourg. Today Minekov's works are owned by private collectors throughout Europe, USA, Israel and Japan. In the last few years the artist has participated in two exhibitions in the Netherlands (2005, 2007) and in a joint exhibition with painter Branimir Tzakov in the Seasons Gallery in Sofia (2006).

Paulsen played hockey at the University of Minnesota from 1938‚Äì41 and was an All-American in 1940 at left wing alongside teammate John Mariucci. He was team captain as a senior in 1940-41 finishing his career as Gopher hockey's all-time leading scorer, a record that would hold for the next 25 years. He was selected for the 1940 U.S. Olympic Hockey team, but due to World War II those games were cancelled. With boyish looks, and a small stature, Paulsen earned the nickname \\"Babe\\" during his playing days in high school and college. Following college, Paulsen signed a professional contract with the Chicago Black Hawks, but never made it to Chicago. He coached the Roseau High School Rams varsity hockey team before joining the Navy during World War II. Paulsen returned to Minnesota after the war and completed a master's degree in education. He coached the varsity ice hockey program at Thief River Falls High School. Paulsen was hired as the first varsity ice hockey coach at Michigan State University on August 1, 1948. Before recruiting or coaching, Paulsen oversaw the renovation of Demonstration Hall into an indoor rink with artificial ice-making capabilities. Paulsen struggled through his first two years at Michigan State with a 6-25 record. MSU athletic director Ralph H. Young felt the hockey program's progress was inadequate and Paulsen resigned after the 1951 season. Following his coaching career, Paulsen earned a doctorate in physical education from the University of Michigan. He continued teaching health education courses at Michigan State. In 1956 he left Michigan State to become athletic director at Slippery Rock State Teachers College in Pennsylvania, now Slippery Rock University. Paulsen moved on to teach physical education at Mankato State College, now Minnesota State University, Mankato, until his retirement in 1988.

Rudolf Peter Heinrich Heidenhain (; 29 January 1834 ‚Äì 13 October 1897) was a German physiologist born in Marienwerder, East Prussia (now Kwidzyn, Poland). His son, Martin Heidenhain, was a highly regarded anatomist.  Academic career  He studied medicine at the Universities of Halle and Berlin. After receiving his doctorate, he remained in Berlin as an assistant to Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896). In 1856 he returned to Halle, and worked in the laboratory of Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann (1801-1877). While serving an assistant at Halle, he made improvements on Hermann Welcker‚Äôs procedure for measurement of blood volume. In 1859 he attained the chair of physiology at the University of Breslau, where he remained for the rest of his career. Three of his famous students at Breslau were Karl Weigert (1845-1904), Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936), and Albert Wojciech Adamkiewicz (1850-1921). His laboratory was the source of voluminous contributions by himself, his pupils, or his assistants to Pfl√ºgers Archiv on a large variety of special topics in the field of his studies.  Work in muscle physiology  Heidenhain is remembered for his work involving muscle and nerve physiology, and contributions made in the study of physiological thermoelectrics. He demonstrated the muscles' self-regulatory process for expenditure of energy, as well as its ability to \\"economize\\" energy. Heidenhain showed that total output energy (heat and mechanical work) increases with an increased load, in other words, a muscle freed more energy when resistance to its contraction was greater. Also, when a muscle was fatigued, it had the ability to work more economically. Heidenhain's research also dealt with the study of heat production during muscular activity. He was able to detect and measure a small increase of temperature during the slightest muscular movement.  Other contributions  Heidenhain did extensive research concerning the secretory and absorption processes of glands. He studied the stomach's gastric glands and the processes it used to produce pepsin and hydrochloric acid. The eponymous demilunes of Heidenhain were described by him. These are half-moon shaped cellular structures associated with the salivary glands. Heidenhain conducted scientific studies of hypnotism, having been impressed by the public hypnotist, Carl Hansen. His research was from a physiological basis, and he explained hypnosis in terms of inhibition of the cortex. Later, Ivan Pavlov carried on Heidenhain's physiological studies of hypnosis.

As the mortality rates of childhood cancers have plummeted since effective treatment regiments have been introduced, greater attention has been paid to the effect of treatment on neurocognitive morbidity and quality of life of survivors. The goal of treatment for childhood cancers today is to minimize these adverse \\"late effects\\", while ensuring long-term survival. Effect of cancer and its treatment on brain development Research shows that children with cancer are at risk for developing various cognitive or learning problems. These difficulties may be related to brain injury stemming from the cancer itself, such as a brain tumor or central nervous system metastasis or from side effects of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Studies have shown that chemo and radiation therapies may damage brain white matter and disrupt brain activity. Cognitive problems that have been associated with cancer and its treatments in children include deficits in attention, working memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, persistence, verbal fluency, memory, motor skills, academic achievement and social function. These deficits have been shown to occur irrespective of age, socioeconomic status, months since onset or cessation of treatment, anxiety, fatigue and dosage schedule. Cognitive rehabilitation Some clinicians and research groups in neuropsychology are developing programs to help treat the cognitive problems associated with childhood cancer. Treatment typically involves a program of cognitive rehabilitation which aims to help improve cognitive function either by restoring capacities that were impaired and/or helping the patient learn ways to compensate for the impairment(s). Cognitive rehabilitation therapy usually involves evaluation to determine the specific impairments involved, an individualized program of specific skills training and practice and metacognitive strategies. Metacognitive strategies include helping the patient increase self-awareness regarding problem solving skills by learning how to better monitor the effectiveness of these skills and self- correct when necessary. Cognitive rehabilitation is conducted under the supervision of a neuropsychologist or other trained professional.

The oldest theory is the Ransom Theory...It held sway for a thousand years. [...] The Forensic Theory is that of the Reformers and their successors.' is a theory of the atonement within Christian theology, which argues that Christ, by his own sacrificial choice, was punished (penalized) in the place of sinners (substitution), thus satisfying the demands of justice so God can justly forgive sin. It developed with the Reformed traditionJ. I. Packer, What did the Cross Achieve? The Logic of Penal Substitution (Tyndale Biblical Theology Lecture, 1973): '... Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Melanchthon and their reforming contemporaries were the pioneers in stating it [i.e. the penal substitutionary theory]...'L. W. Grensted, A Short History of the Doctrine of the Atonement (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1920), p. 191: 'Before the Reformation only a few hints of a Penal theory can be found.'H. N. Oxenham, The Catholic doctrine of the atonement (London: Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts, and Green, 1865), p. 112-3,119: '...we may pause to sum up briefly the main points of teaching on Christ's work of redemption to be gathered from the patristic literature of the first three centuries as a whole. And first, as to what it does not contain. There is no trace, as we have seen, of the notions of vicarious satisfaction, in the sense of our sins being imputed to Christ and His obedience imputed to us, which some of the Reformers made the very essence of Christianity; or, again, of the kindred notion that God was angry with His Son for our sakes, and inflicted on Him the punishment due to us ; nor is Isaiah s prophecy interpreted in this sense, as afterwards by Luther; on the contrary, there is much which expressly negatives this line of thought. There is no mention of the justice of God, in the forensic sense of the word; the Incarnation is in variably exclusively ascribed to His love; the term satisfaction does not occur in this connection at all, and where Christ is said to suffer for us, huper (not anti) is the word always used. It is not the payment of a debt, as in St. Anselm's Cur Deus Homo, but the restoration of our fallen nature, that is prominent in the minds of these writers, as the main object of the Incarnation. They always speak, with Scripture, of our being reconciled to God, not of God being reconciled to us.' [p. 112-3]; 'His [Jesus'] death was now [in the Reformation period], moreover, for the first time viewed as a vicarious punishment, inflicted by God on Him instead of on us.' [p. 119] as a specific understanding of substitutionary atonement, where the substitutionary nature of Jesus' death is understood in the sense of a substitutionary punishment. While penal substitution shares themes present in other theories of the atonement, penal substitution is a distinctively Protestant understanding of the atonement that differs from both Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox understandings of the atonement. A belief in penal substitution is often regarded as a hallmark of the evangelical faith and is included as an article of faith by many (but not all) evangelical organizations today.  Definition  The penal substitution theory teaches that Jesus suffered the penalty for mankind's sins. Penal substitution derives from the idea that divine forgiveness must satisfy divine justice, that is, that God is not willing or able to simply forgive sin without first requiring a satisfaction for it. It states that God gave himself in the person of his Son, Jesus Christ, to suffer the death, punishment and curse due to fallen humanity as the penalty for our sin. Important theological concepts about penal substitution depend on the doctrine of the Trinity. Those who believe that Jesus was himself God, in line with the doctrine of the Trinity, believe that God took the punishment upon himself rather than putting it on someone else. In other words, the doctrine of union with Christ affirms that by taking the punishment upon himself Jesus fulfills the demands of justice not for an unrelated third party but for those identified with him. If, in the penal substitution understanding of the atonement, the death of Christ deals with sin and injustice, his resurrection is the renewal and restoration of righteousness. Some other atonement theories are the ransom theory, which says that Christ's death represents the cosmic defeat of the devil to whom a ransom had to be paid, c.q. Christ Victor theory, the rescue of humanity from the power of sin and death, a view popularised by Gustaf Aul√©n; and exemplary theory, associated with Peter Abelard and Hastings Rashdall, which argues that the cross had its effect on human beings, by setting forth a supreme example of godliness which we must follow. Development The penal substitution theory is a specific interpretation of vicarious (substitutionary) atonement, which in turn goes back to Second Temple Judaism, although evangelicals such as William Lane Craig cite the offer of Moses of the death of himself instead of the people of Israel (Exodus 32:30-34) as an example of this substitution. It was developed during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century,Gregg Allison, 'A History of the Doctrine of the Atonement' in Southern Baptist Journal of Theology 11.2 (Summer 2007): 4-19: 'The Reformers introduced another view of the atonement, generally called the penal substitutionary theory ' (p. 10); '...the penal substitutionary theory of the atonement, originated by the Reformers and developed by their successors' (p. 14-15). being advocated by Martin Luther and Calvin.'The roots of the penal substitution view are discernible in the writings of John Calvin (1509-1564), though it was left to later expositors to systematize and emphasize it in its more robust forms.' (Paul R. Eddy and James Beilby, 'The Atonement: An Introduction', in P. R. Eddy and J. Beilby [eds], The Nature of the Atonement: Four Views [Downers Grove: IVP, 2006], p. 17) It was more concretely formulated by the Reformed theologian Charles Hodge (1797-1878). Advocates of penal substitution argue that the concept is both biblically 'But he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.' Isaiah 53:5 ESV based and rooted in the historical traditions of the Christian Church. =Vicarious atonement= The idea of vicarious atonement flows from Judaism. Isaiah 53:4-6, 10, 11 refers to the \\"suffering servant\\": =New Testament= The New Testamentical authors used various metaphors to explain and interpret the death and resurrection of Jesus. According to C. Marvin Pate, \\"there are three aspects to Christ's atonement according to the early Church: vicarious atonement [substitutionary atonement], the escatological defeat of Satan [Christ the Victor], and the imitation of Christ [participation in Jesus' death and resurrection].\\" Pate further notes that these three aspects were intertwined in the earliest Christian writings, but that this intertwining was lost since the Patristic times. Key New Testament references which reflect a vicarious atonement of Jesus' death and resurrection include: * Romans 3:23-26‚Äî\\"All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God; they are now justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a sacrifice of atonement by his blood, effective through faith. He did this to show his righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over the sins previously committed; it was to prove at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies the one who has faith in Jesus.\\" (NRSV) * 2 Corinthians 5:21‚Äî\\"For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.\\" (RSV) * Galatians 3:10, 13‚Äî\\"All who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, 'Cursed be every one who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law, and do them.' ... Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us - for it is written, 'Cursed be every one who hangs on a tree.'\\" (RSV) *Colossians 2:13-15‚Äî\\"And you, who were dead in trespasses and uncircumcision of your flesh having canceled the bond which stood against us with its legal demands; this he set aside, nailing it to the cross. He disarmed the principalities and powers and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in him.\\" (RSV) * 1 Peter 2:24‚Äî\\"He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.\\"(RSV) * 1 Peter 3:18‚Äî\\"For Christ also died for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God.\\" (RSV) On the basis of N. T. Wright has argued that there are, in fact, different models of penal substitution in which ideas of justification work together with redemption and sacrifice.N. T. Wright, \\"The Cross and the Caricatures\\" Fulcrum (Eastertide 2007)}} =Early Church= In scholarly literature it has been generally recognised for some time that the penal substitution theory was not taught in the Early Church.Gustaf Aulen, Christus Victor (1931) (London: SPCK), p.143: 'The history of the doctrine of the Atonement is a history of three types of view, which emerge in turn. The classic idea emerges with Christianity itself, and remains the dominant type for of teaching for a thousand years. The origin of the Latin doctrine can be exactly determined...'J. F. Bethune-Baker, An introduction to the early history of Christian doctrine to the time of the Council of Chalcedon (London: Methuen & Co, 1903), p. 328, 351-2: 'Of the various aspects of the Atonement which are represented in the pages of the New Testament, the early Fathers chiefly dwell on those of sacrifice (and obedience), reconciliation, illumination by knowledge, and ransom. Not till a later time was the idea of satisfaction followed up' [p. 328]; 'The only satisfaction which was thought of was the satisfaction which the penitent himself makes. There is no suggestion of any satisfaction of the divine justice through the sufferings of Christ. ' [p. 328, n. 3]; 'From this review of the teaching of the Church it will be seen that there is only the most slender support to be found in the earliest centuries for some of the views that became current at a later time. It is at least clear that the sufferings of Christ were not regarded as an exchange or substitution of penalty, or as punishment inflicted on him by the Father for our sins. There is, that is to say, no idea of vicarious satisfaction, either in the sense that our sins are imputed to Christ and his obedience to us, or in the sense that God was angry with him for our sakes and inflicted on him punishment due to us.' [p. 351-2]. The ransom theory of atonement was nearly universally accepted in this early period.A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk, Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011), pp 250-277.'In one form or another, [the Christus Victor] view seems to have dominated the atonement theology of the early church for the first millennium (thus the label \\"classic view\\").' (Paul R. Eddy and James Beilby, 'The Atonement: An Introduction', in P. R. Eddy and J. Beilby [eds], The Nature of the Atonement: Four Views [Downers Grove: IVP, 2006], p. 12Michael Green, The Empty Cross of Jesus (Eastbourne: Kingsway, 2004; first published 1984), p. 64-5: 'The simplest and most obvious understanding of the cross is to see it as the supreme example. ... This is a favourite theme in the early Fathers, as H.E.W. Turner showed in The Patristic Doctrine of Redemption. ... It can scarcely be denied that much of the second century understanding of the cross was frankly exemplarist.' Scholars vary when interpreting proposed precursors to penal substitution in the writings of some of the Early Church fathers, including Justin Martyr (c.100-165), Eusebius of Caesarea (c.275-339), Athanasius (c.300-373) and Augustine of Hippo (354-430). There is general agreement that no writer in the Early Church taught penal substitution as their primary theory of atonement. Yet some writers appear to reference some of the ideas of penal substitution as an afterthought or as an aside. The ransom theory of atonement is a substitutionary theory of atonement, just as penal substitution is. It can therefore be difficult to distinguish intended references to the ransom view by Early Church writers from real penal substitutionary ideas. The Fathers often worked upon biblical quotations,Justin Martyr Dialogue with Trypho: \\"Cursed is everyone who hangeth on a tree\\" - Deuteronomy 21:23; \\"Cursed is everyone who continues not in all things that are written in the book of the law\\": Deuteronomy 27:26, quoted in Galatians 3:10-13 from both Testaments, describing Christ's saving work, sometimes adding one to another from different places in Scripture.Gregory of Nazianzus quotes in the same passage Galatians (above), 1 Corinthians 15 (the \\"new Adam\\") and Hebrews 5:8 (obedience through suffering) The dominant strain in the soteriological writings of the Greek Fathers, such as Athanasius of Alexandria (c.296/298‚Äì373), was the so-called \\"physical\\" theory that Christ, by becoming man, restored the divine image in us; but blended with this is the conviction that his death was necessary to release us from the curse of sin, and that he offered himself in sacrifice for us.Kelly p. 377; Gregory of Nyssa, who follows him, developed the 'classic' theory of Christ as a ransom. =Anselm (11th century)= It was not until St. Anselm (1033/4‚Äì1109) wrote his famous work Cur Deus Homo (1098) that attention was focused on the theology of redemption with the aim of providing more exact definitions.J. N. D. Kelly, Early Christian Doctrines (fifth, revised edition; London: Adam & Charles Black, 1977), p. 375\\\\. Compare F. W. Dillistone The Christian Understanding of the Atonement(Nisbet 1968). Anselm's view can best be understood from medieval feudalistic conceptions of authority, of sanctions and of reparation. Anselmian satisfaction contrasts with penal substitution in that Anselm sees the satisfaction (i.e. restitution) as an alternative to punishment. According to Anselm, \\"The honour taken away must be repaid, or punishment must follow\\" (bk 1 ch 8), whereas penal substitution views the punishment as the means of satisfaction. Comparing what was due to God and what was due to the feudal Lord, he argued that what was due to God was honour. \\"'Honour' comprises the whole complex of service and worship which the whole creation, animate and inanimate, in heaven and earth, owes to the Creator. The honour of God is injured by the withdrawal of man's service which he is due to offer.\\"Richard Southern, Anselm and his biographer (CUP 1963) This failure constitutes a debt, weight or doom, for which man must make satisfaction, but which lies beyond his competence; only if a new man can be found who by perfect obedience can satisfy God's honour and by some work of supererogation can provide the means of paying the existing debt of his fellows, can God's original purpose be fulfilled. So Christ not only lives a sinless life, which is again his due, but also is willing to endure death for the sake of love. Although penal substitution is often associated with Anselm of Canterbury (1033/4‚Äì1109), he predates its formal development within Reformed theology. It is therefore doubted even among Reformed theologians whether his 'satisfaction' theory is strictly equivalent.Steve Jeffery, Michael Ovey, Andrew Sach, 'N. T. Wright on Pierced for our Transgression', quoted in D. Flood, 'Substitutionary atonement and the Church Fathers' in Evangelical Quarterly 82.2 (2010), p. 143: 'Anselm did not teach penal substitution. Yes, he brought to prominence the vocabulary of ‚Äòsatisfaction‚Äô, which became important in later formulations. But in Anselm‚Äôs feudal thought- world, it was God‚Äôs honour that needed to be satisfied by substitutionary obedience, not his justice by substitutionary penalty.' =Reformation= The Reformers claimed over and over to be recovering the truth of the Gospel from both the New Testament and the earliest Christian fathers. They generally believed doctrinal errors were introduced by the later fathers of the Middle Ages.https://europeanhistory.boisestate.edu/reformation/reformers/zwingli.shtml Europe in the Age of Reformation, on Zwingli \\"He was still at the point where he would say not only that he could find no basis in Scripture but also not in the Church fathers.\\"Calvin in his preface to the Institutes \\"Then, with dishonest clamour, they assail us as enemies and despisers of the Fathers. So far are we from despising them, that if this were the proper place, it would give us no trouble to support the greater part of the doctrines which we now hold by their suffrages.\\"Christianity today. http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/news/2004/jan16.html?start=2 Chris Armstrong writes \\"'Ours is the ancient tradition,' they said. 'The innovations were introduced in the Middle Ages!' They issued anthologies of the Fathers to show the Fathers had taught what the Reformers were teaching.\\"The Reception of the Church Fathers in the West: From the Carolingians to the Maurists,edited by Irena Dorota Backus (John Calvin and the Church Fathers) P665 \\"Calvin counterclaims two things, first that the doctrines of Rome are contrary to the teachings of the Early Church, and secondly that the teaching of the Reformers is in fact very close to \\"the ancient writers of a better age of the church.‚Äô\\" Concordia Theological Quarterly Volume 68:3/4 Carl Beckwith Martin Chemnitz's Use of the Church Fathers in His Locus on Justification'' Luther Broadly speaking, Martin Luther followed Anselm, thus remaining mainly in the \\"Latin\\" model identified by Gustaf Aul√©n. He held, however, that Christ's atoning work encompassed both his active and passive obedience to the law: as the perfectly innocent God-man, he fulfilled the law perfectly during his life and, in his death on the cross, bore the eternal punishment that all men deserved for their breaking the law. Unlike Anselm, Luther thus combines both satisfaction and punishment.Cf. Paul Althaus, Die Theologie Martin Luthers, 7th ed. (1994), 179, 191-195. Furthermore, Luther rejected the fundamentally legalistic character of Anselm's paradigm in terms of an understanding of the Cross in the more personal terms of an actual conflict between the wrath of God at the sinner and the love of God for the same sinner.One might recall Gershom Scholem's observation in another context (i.e., in reference to Jewish Gnosticism) that not all the elements of the mythological have been expunged from Jewish monotheism. For Luther this conflict was real, personal, dynamic and not merely forensic or analogical.To what extent Luther's understanding of the Christ's sufferings on the Cross paralleled similar conflicts within his own personal character will doubtlessly continue to be a matter of academic debate, but may ultimately be theologically irrelevant, because the ultimate question is how closely Luther's personal spiritual struggles are paradigmatic of humanity in general and not merely those singularly characteristic of Luther's own personality. If Anselm conceived of the Cross in terms a forensic duel between Christ's identification with humanity and the infinite value and majesty of his divine person, Luther perceived the Cross as a new G√∂tterdammerung, a dramatic, definitive struggle between the divine attributes of God's implacable righteousness against the sinful humanity and inscrutable identification with this same helpless humanity which gave birth to a New Creation, whose undeniable reality could only be glimpsed through faith and whose invincible power worked only through love. One cannot understand the unique character or force of Luther's and the Lutheran understanding of the Cross apart from this dramatic character which is not readily translated into or expressed through the more rational philosophical categories of dogmatic theology, even when these categories are those of Lutheran Orthodoxy itself. Calvin Calvin appropriated Anselm's ideas but changed the terminology to that of the criminal law with which he was familiar‚Äîsince he was trained as a lawyer. Man is guilty before God's judgement and the only appropriate punishment is eternal death. The Son of God has become man and has stood in man's place to bear the immeasurable weight of wrath‚Äîthe curse, and the condemnation of a righteous God. He was \\"made a substitute and a surety in the place of transgressors and even submitted as a criminal, to sustain and suffer all the punishment which would have been inflicted on them.\\"John Calvin, Institutes 2:16:10 Calvin made special appeal to the Suffering Servant passage in and to with its reference to the \\"Harrowing of Hell\\"‚Äîthe release of the spirits of those who had died before Christ. From the former, he singled out \\"But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed.\\" Both are set, by Calvin within the context of Pilate's court of judgment to which, according to Dillistone, they do not properly belong;Dillistone, p. 201 nevertheless, the image of \\"one who has borne the stripes and the chastisement which should, by strict desert have fallen\\"Dillistone, p. 214 upon others, within the divine purpose, is, on all sides agreed to be an essential element in the story. John Wesley John Wesley the founder of Methodism also held strongly to the penal substitution theory of the atonement, as did the majority of early Methodists including the first great Methodist systematic theologian Richard Watson. Kenneth J. Collins in his book \\"The Theology of John Wesley: Holy Love and the Shape of Grace\\" writes, \\"for Wesley, Christ makes compensation and satisfies the justice of God precisely by standing in the place of sinful humanity, by being reckoned among its numbers, and in the end by bearing the penalty, the very wages of sin.\\"Kenneth J. Collins, \\"The Theology of John Wesley: Holy Love and the Shape of Grace\\" 102 This is perhaps made the most clear in Wesley's writing entitled \\"The Doctrine of Original Sin\\". In this treatise Wesley writes, \\"Our sins were the procuring cause of all his sufferings. His sufferings were the penal effects of our sins. 'The chastisement of our peace,' the punishment necessary to procure it, 'was' laid 'on him,' freely submitting thereto: 'And by his stripes' (a part of his sufferings again put for the whole) 'we are healed'; pardon, sanctification, and final salvation, are all purchased and bestowed upon us. Every chastisement is for some fault. That laid on Christ was not for his own, but ours; and was needful to reconcile an offended Lawgiver, and offering guilty creatures, to each other. So 'the Lord laid on him the iniquity of us all'; that is, the punishment due to our iniquity.\\"Jackson,\\"Wesley's Works\\" 9:412 The work of the Reformers, including Zwingli and Philip Melanchthon, was hugely influential. It took away from Christianity the requirement of works as a means of justification, whether corporal or spiritual, of the need for penance, belief in purgatory, etc; and it did so by emphasizing a finality of Christ's work. Criticisms and replies =Criticisms= Ever since the doctrine of penal substitution received full expression in the Reformation period, it has been the subject of continual criticism on biblical, moral and logical grounds. A number of 21st- century works provide recent critiques.A. J. Wallace, R. D. Rusk Moral Transformation: The Original Christian Paradigm of Salvation, (New Zealand: Bridgehead, 2011) David. A. Brondos, Paul on the Cross: Reconstructing the Apostle's Story of Redemption (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2006) Stephen Finlan, Problems With Atonement: The Origins Of, And Controversy About, The Atonement Doctrine (Liturgical Press, 2005) Joel B. Green, Mark D. Baker, Recovering the Scandal of the Cross: Atonement in New Testament & Contemporary Contexts (IVP Academic, 2000) The first extensive criticism of the penal substitutionary view came during the Reformation period from within the Anabaptist movement, from the pen of Faustus Socinus.De Jesu Christo Servatore (1578) He argued that penal substitution was \\"irrational, incoherent, immoral and impossible.\\" His objections were as follows: # Perfect satisfaction for sin, even by way of substitution, leaves no room for divine forgiveness or pardon. # It is unjust both to punish the innocent and to allow the guilty to go free. # The finite suffering and temporary death of one is disproportionate to the infinite suffering and permanent death of many. # The grace of perfect satisfaction would appear to confer on its beneficiaries a freedom to sin without consequence. Socinus thought that Jesus was not himself God and that he had not come in the flesh to intentionally die for humanity. Socinus argued against the Trinity. It thus follows as a natural consequence that it would be unjust to punish Jesus for the sins of others. Similarly, his argument that a temporary death of one would not be sufficient to pay for all mankind's sins also flows from his premise that Jesus was only an ordinary man. Calvin's general framework, coinciding as it did with a rising respect for law, considered as a bulwark against the ferments of war, revolution and civil insurrection, remained normative for Reformed Christians for the next three centuries. Moreover, if Socinus spoke from the point of view of the radical reformers, there were also Catholics for whom the once and for all nature of Christ's redeeming work was in danger of weakening the doctrine of sanctification and the spiritual life of the believer and his or her appropriation of the divine mystery through the sacraments of penance and the Eucharist. Further, with the development of notions of inalienable personal responsibility in law, the idea of \\"penal\\" substitution has become less easy to maintain. In modern law, the punishment of the innocent and the acquittal of the guilty is regarded as the perfect example of injustice.Anscome, G.E.M., \\"Modern Moral Theory\\" in Virtue Ethics (OUP 1997; see also Hart H.L.A., Punishment and the Elimination of Responsibility (Hobhouse Memorial Lecture 1962) Anglican theologian F. W. Dillistone stated that \\"no strictly penal theology of the atonement can be expected to carry conviction in the world of the twentieth century.\\"Dillistone, F. W. The Christian Understanding of the Atonement (Nisbet, 1963) p. 214 Among the problems identified is that the word \\"penal\\" implies an association with law, but the relationship between theological ideas and social institutions such as the law changes.Daube, David Studies in Biblical law (CUP, 1947) The contemporary argument as to the relationship of human rights to positive law is a modern extension of this. Secondly, ideas of justice and punishment are not the same in Jewish law, imperial Roman law, sixteenth-century European law and modern common law. Thus, for instance, \\"satisfaction\\" and \\"merit\\" are understandable within the context of Roman law, but sit less easily within either Old or New Testament conceptions. Likewise, when the word \\"penal\\" is used, it raises as many questions about the different theories of punishment, past and present. Thirdly, in Calvin's work, and subsequently, there is an interplay between legal and cultic language. Words such as \\"curse\\", \\"expiation\\", \\"propitiation\\", \\"wrath\\", and \\"sacrifice\\" appear together with sixteenth-century legal language. \\"The framework is legal, the process is cultic. Removal of legal sanctions is equated with freedom of access in worship.\\"Dillistone, p. 199) Calvin contends that it was necessary for Jesus to suffer through a judicial process and to be condemned as a criminal (even though the process was flawed and Pilate washed his hands of the condemnation), but tying this to the need for sacrifice \\"proved to be a dead weight upon the thinking and imagining of Reformed Christendom.\\" according to Dillistone. Next, the two words \\"expiation\\" and \\"propitiation\\" present problems. It has been argued that the former, which means to purge away, needs to be distinguished from the latter, which means to appease a person, and that it is propitiation which presents the problem for those who are critical of the idea of penal substitution.'['Propitiation'] accurately represents the meaning in classical Greek of the word used‚Ä¶However, the Hebrew equivalent is never used with God as the object, this fact suggests that the primary meaning is to expiate or remove an obstacle on man‚Äôs part to his relationship with God. To say that the death of Christ is ‚Äòpropitiatory‚Äô is, then, to say that it is effective in restoring the relationship between God and man, damaged by sin.' ('Atonement'. Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church (E. F. L. Cross & E. A. Livingstone [Oxford: OUP, 2005]) James D.G. Dunn, 'Paul‚Äôs Understanding of the Death of Jesus' in Robert Banks (ed.), Reconciliation and Hope (Carlisle: Paternoster Press, 1974), p. 137: '...\\"expiation\\" does seem to be the better translation [than \\"propitiation\\"] for Rom. 3:25. The fact is that for Paul God is the subject of the action; it is God who provided Jesus as a [hilasterion]. And if God is the subject, then the obvious object is sin or the sinner. To argue that God provided Jesus as a means of propitiating God is certainly possible, but less likely I think. For one thing, regularly in the Old Testament the immediate object of the action denoted by the Hebrew kipper is the removal of sin‚Äïeither by purifying the person or object, or by wiping out the sin; the act of atonement \\"cancels\\", \\"purges away\\" sin. It is not God who is the object of this atonement, nor the wrath of God, but the sin which calls forth the wrath of God.'Anglican theologian O.C. Quick: \\"the persistent mistake of supposing that sin-offerings must somehow have been meant to propitiate God by the killing of a victim in the offerer's stead, an idea which has been a source of endless confusion in the exegesis of the New Testament.\\" (O.C. Quick, Doctrines of the Creed [Scribner's, 1938] p.232.Austin Farrer argues that St. Paul's words should be translated in terms of expiation not propitiation: \\"God himself, says St. Paul, so far from being wrathful against us, or from needing to be propitiated, loved us enough to set forth Christ as an expiation of our sins through his blood.\\" (Said or Sung [Faith Press, 1964] p.69)Everett Ferguson, The Church of Christ: A Biblical Ecclesiology for Today (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1996), p. 150‚Äì152: 'In the New Testament, instead of a sacrifice offered by human beings to God, [the hilaskomai] word group refers to a sacrifice made by God himself (Rom. 3:25; 1 John 4:10). Some passages use the expected language of a sacrifice offered to God (Eph. 5:2), but the New Testament usage of hilasterion and hilasmos stands the pagan Greek idea on its head. God is not appeased or propitiated. He himself acts to remove the sin that separates human beings from him. Instead of humans offering the sacrifice, God himself expiates or makes atonement for sins. God performs the sacrifice. The divine action for human salvation completely reverses the usual understanding of religion and worship.' Karl Barth (and later J√ºrgen Moltmann) argued in Church Dogmatics IV/1 'A doubtful feature in this presentation is the distinction between an objective atonement and a subjective which is obviously quite different from it. So, too, is the distinction between that which has been worked out and is available in Christ and that which has still to come to me. So, too, and above all, is the description of the antithesis in categories of possibility and actuality, which later becomes the differentiation of a purpose which is only present in Jesus Christ and which attains its goal only in some other occurrence.' Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics IV/1:285 that propitiation and expiation are false categories when applied to the triune God: If God forgives us in and through Christ (\\"Christ pays our debt\\"), then the cost has been borne by God in, as, and through Christ. For God to propitiate himself is expiation; because expiation is always self- propitiation as it means the forgiver paying the debt (here, the price of the sin) at his own expense. Hence Dietrich Bonhoeffer says grace is free, but is not cheap. Additionally, a view of human salvation which defines it in terms of once-and-for-all acquittal has to deal with its relationship to subsequent actionsFiddes, Paul, Past Event and Present Salvation: The Story of the Atonement (1989) and the lives of those not born at the time of the Paschal Mystery.Wiles, Maurice The remaking of Christian Doctrine (SCM 1974) p. 65. Some, like Karl Barth, simply criticized the concept of satisfaction of God's wrath for being unscriptural.'...we must not make this [the concept of punishment] a main concept as in some of the older presentations of the doctrine of the atonement (especially those which follow Anselm of Canterbury), with in the sense that by His [Christ's] suffering our punishment we are spared from suffering it ourselves, or that in so doing He \\"satisfied\\" or offered satisfaction to the wrath of God. The latter thought is quite foreign to the New Testament.' Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics IV/1:253 =Replies= Proponents of penal substitution contend that critics overlook the repeated declarations of Jesus that he intended to die on the cross, and that his death was the very purpose for which he was born on the Earth (). It is irrelevant, they argue, whether it might be unjust to punish an innocent bystander involuntarily, since the actual proposition is one of Jesus offering voluntarily to die on behalf of others, like a soldier throwing himself on a hand grenade to save his fellow soldiers. Jesus himself taught that \\"greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends\\" () and repeatedly announced that he was intentionally going to Jerusalem, knowing that he was heading to his death (; ). Jesus' identity as himself being God is also central to penal substitution. Those who do not believe that Jesus was God visiting the Earth in human form necessarily conclude that God chose a bystander named Jesus to suffer for others. However, those who believe that Jesus was actually God (; ) conclude that God‚Äîagainst whom mankind had sinned‚Äîcame to accept the penalty upon himself. Thus, they see no injustice in God's choosing to come to Earth in order to take humanity's sin upon himself. However, the replies in these two paragraphs do not directly answer the objection that guilt is inherently non-transferable, whether the victim seeks to have it transferred or not. While they show that Jesus was not in the position of being punished involuntarily, they do not show that it is possible or just to punish a willing innocent victim in place of the guilty. J. I. Packer admits that proponents do not know how this could be possible but choose to believe it anyway. J. I. Packer states that language must be used in a stretched sense. God is not a sixteenth-century monarch, he says, and divine government is not the same as earthly government. He states that Christians should regard all truth of God as an \\"apprehended mystery,\\" and always hold that God is greater than our formularies. He holds, nonetheless, that penal substitution can be described as a model in a way comparable to how physics uses the term. He defines the term model, in a theological sense, as \\"explanatory constructs formed to help us know, understand, and deal with God, the ultimate reality.\\" He states that the \\"mystery of God is more than any one model, even the best, can express.\\" He states that \\"all the knowledge we can have of the atonement is of a mystery which we can only think and speak by means of models.\\" To Packer, the biblical models are presented as being inspired by God and given to us as \\"knowledge of the mystery of the cross.\\" The theologian Stephen Sykes has interpreted Packer's account of penal substitution as being presented as a metaphor. Theologians who advocate penal substitution are keen to define the doctrine carefully, rather than, as Packer says; \\"the primary question is, not the rationality or morality of God but the remission of one's sins.\\" He suggests that it be seen not as a mechanical explanation (how it works) but rather than kerygmatically (what it means to us). Denney contends that the atonement should not be seen forensically (though as Packer says, Denney avoided the term \\"penal\\" in any case).James Denney, Atonement And The Modern Mind, (Hodder And Stoughton, 1903) p.271, as quoted by Packer in note 28 of his essay above What matters in Packer's view is that \\"Jesus Christ our Lord, moved by a love that was determined to do everything necessary to save us, endured and exhausted the destructive divine judgment for which we were otherwise inescapably destined, and so won us forgiveness, adoption and glory.\\" However, John Stott critiques loveless caricatures of the cross as \\"a sacrifice to appease an angry God, or ... a legal transaction in which an innocent victim was made to pay the penalty for the crimes of others\\" as being \\"neither the Christianity of the Bible in general nor of Paul in particular.\\" Furthermore, \\"It is doubtful if anybody has ever believed such a crude construction.\\"John Stott, The Cross of Christ, (IVP, 1986) p. 172 Recent controversies Recently controversy has arisen over a statement made by Steve Chalke that \\"The cross isn't a form of cosmic child abuse‚ÄîA vengeful Father punishing his Son for an offense he has not even committed.\\"Steve Chalke, Alan Mann, The Lost Message of Jesus (Zondervan, 2003) p. 16 This sparked a debate in the UK among evangelicals which is cataloged in the book The Atonement Debate: Papers from the London Symposium on the Theology of Atonement (Zondervan, 2008). The debate has largely been conducted in evangelical circles,See Steve Jeffery, Mike Ovey, and Andrew Sach, Pierced for our Transgressions: Rediscovering the Glory of Penal Substitution (IVP, 2007) to which the Bishop of Durham, N. T. Wright, has responded in \\"The Cross and the Caricatures\\". though the dismissal of the doctrine of penal substitution on moral grounds by Jeffrey John, an Anglo- Catholic priest and Dean of St Albans, in a broadcast talk during Holy Week 2007Jeffrey John, Lent Talks, BBC Radio 4 (04/04/07): 'As he said, \\"Whoever sees me has seen the Father\\". Jesus is what God is. He is the one who shows us God's nature. And the most basic truth about God's nature is that he is love, not wrath and punishment.' [8.07-08.21 min.]; 'The cross, then, is not about Jesus reconciling an angry God to us; it's almost the opposite. It's about a totally loving God, incarnate in Christ, reconciling us to him. On the cross, Jesus dies for our sins, the price of sin is paid, but it's not paid to God, but by God. As St Paul says ... Because he is love, God does what love does: unites himself with the beloved. He enters his own creation and goes to the bottom line for us. Not sending a substitute to vent his punishment on, but going himself to the bitter end, sharing in the worst of suffering and grief that life can throw at us, and finally sharing our death so that he can bring us through death to eternal life in him.' [09.37-10.36 min.]; '...so far from inflicting suffering and punishment, be bears our griefs and shares our sorrow. From Good Friday on, God is no longer God up there, inscrutably allotting rewards and retributions; on the cross, even more than in the crib, he is Emmanuel, God down here, God with us.' [13.22-13.45 min.]'\\"In other words, Jesus took the rap and we got forgiven as long as we said we believed in him,\\" says Mr. John. \\"This is repulsive as well as nonsensical. It makes God sound like a psychopath. If a human behaved like this we'd say that they were a monster.\\"': Jonathan Wynne-Jones, 'Easter message: Christ did not die for sin' in The Telegraph, 01/04/07. Online (accessed 27/02/11). has drawn fire in his direction.E.g., from Reverend Rod Thomas of Reform on Today, BBC Radio 4, 04/04/07'Church figures have expressed dismay at his comments, which they condemn as a \\"deliberate perversion of the Bible\\". The Rt Rev Tom Wright, the Bishop of Durham, accused Mr. John of attacking the fundamental message of the Gospel. \\"He is denying the way in which we understand Christ's sacrifice. It is right to stress that he is a God of love but he is ignoring that this means he must also be angry at everything that distorts human life,\\" he said.': Jonathan Wynne-Jones, 'Easter message: Christ did not die for sin' in The Telegraph, 01/04/07. Online (accessed 27/02/11).Audio of both J. John's Lent Talks and R. Thomas' criticism can be found on the BBC website, here (accessed 27/02/11). In his book Mere Christianity C. S. Lewis mentions that before becoming a Christian, the doctrine of penal substitution had seemed extremely unethical to him, and that while he had since found it to be less so, he nonetheless indicated a preference for a position closer to that of Athanasius, in which Christ's death is seen as enabling us to die to sin by our participation, and not as a satisfaction or payment to justice as such. He also stated, however, that in his view no explanation of the atonement is as relevant as the fact of the atonement.Mere Christianity (Fount, 1981), pp. 54-55 Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe in his fantasy fiction series, The Chronicles of Narnia, depicts the king Aslan surrendering himself to Jadis the White Witch as a substitute for the life of Edmund Pevensie, which appears to illustrate a ransom or Christus Victor approach to the atonement.Mark D.

Globally, Hong Kong is perhaps best known for its role as an international financial centre and shopping hub, and not for its artistic and cultural offerings. The popular stereotype of the city holds that its residents are far too focused on getting and spending to concern themselves with the ephemeral affairs of art and culture. Yet in recent years the city's government, residents, and the media have brought more attention to the development of the city's arts scene and preservation of the former British colony's unique cultural heritage. It has been argued that the role of art and culture in Hong Kong has taken on increasing prominence in city's search for an identity in the ten years since China resumed sovereignty over the territory. The limitations on democracy in post-colonial Hong Kong may lead more residents to seek expression or confirmation of their identities through arts and culture.Clarke, David, Hong Kong Art: Culture and Decolonization. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press, 2002. Cultural policy The administration of arts and culture in Hong Kong has undergone major changes since Hong Kong's handover to China in 1997. Cultural matters, previously under the auspices of the two Municipal Councils, now fall mainly under the purview of the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) and the Hong Kong Arts Development Council (ADC). The government's formal cultural policy statement is available on the website of the Home Affairs Bureau.Home Affairs Bureau: Cultural Policy statement The ADC is a statutory body established in 1995 to replace the former Council of Performing Arts. The ADC is responsible for promoting broad development of the arts, makes recommendations to the government on cultural policy and development and provides funding for cultural organisations. However, the ADC has been criticised for lacking the executive power and resources to implement policies directly.Yuen, Terence, \\"A Decade's Long March: Reform of the Institutional Framework on Culture and the Arts.\\" In A Decade of Arts Development in Hong Kong, 7-25. Hong Kong: Hong Kong Arts Development Council, 2005. The current chief executive of the ADC, Jonathan Yu, took up his position in April 2005 after more than two decades with the Kowloon‚ÄìCanton Railway Corporation. The LCSD organises artistic and cultural activities and manages a number of cultural facilities. LCSD manages 15 performance venues and 16 museums throughout Hong Kong. The Antiquities and Monuments Office, part of the LCSD, is responsible for heritage conservation and education in Hong Kong. The Culture and Heritage Commission (CHC) was set up in April 2000 to advise on cultural policy and funding priorities. Its Policy Recommendation Report,Culture and Heritage Commission: Policy Recommendation Report (31 March 2003) submitted in April 2003, has been adopted as the blueprint for Hong Kong's cultural policy. The CHC set forth six general principles to guide Hong Kong's cultural policy: The six principles are \\"people-oriented\\", \\"pluralism\\", \\"freedom of expression and protection of intellectual property\\", \\"holistic approach\\", \\"partnership\\" and \\"community-driven.\\" Other proposed policy reforms include increased corporatisation of government-sponsored cultural organisations, small scale public-private partnerships, and the controversial West Kowloon Cultural District Development Project. The government has commissioned a number of studies on Hong Kong's creative industries and cultural policy. Yet to date, many of the ongoing policy issues have not been resolved. Critics have complained of the government's over-reliance on advisory committees and consultations in managing cultural affairs on the grounds that it is inefficient and contrary to global trends in arts administration. Funding and support for the arts The Hong Kong government allocates around US $300 million (US$43 per capita) per year. for culture and arts, which accounts for about 1 percent of total government spending. The HKSAR Government claims that this is \\"broadly comparable to that in some Western countries\\" *HKSAR Government Cultural Policy - accessed May 2010 such as France. However, in monetary terms, France's per capita spend for culture is 197.20 Euro/US$250 per year.*Council of Europe Cultural Policies and Trends There is due to the fact that Hong Kong's public spending as a percentage of GDP is low compared with other developed nations. On average Government expenditures were more than 40% of GDP in OECD countries in 2001.Eswar Prasad, Jorge A.

In the 2006-2007 Policy Address,2006-2007 Policy Address Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced that the Arts and Sport Development Fund would receive US $5 million to support cultural activities. The ADC receives an annual subvention of around US $12 million from the Home Affairs Bureau and around US $3 million on average from the Arts and Sports Development Fund. In addition to providing grants to arts groups, the ADC has established an Arts Service Centre in Sheung Wan to provide office space and facilities for smaller arts organizations. The LCSD provides funding for the annual Hong Kong Arts Festival and nine professional performing companies: the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra, Hong Kong Sinfonietta, Hong Kong Dance Company, Hong Kong Ballet, City Contemporary Dance Company, Hong Kong Repertory Theatre, Chung Ying Theatre, Zuni Icosahedron and Theatre Ensemble . In addition to individual events, it also organizes two arts festivals per year: the summer International Arts Carnival for families and children, and a themed arts festival in the fall. Film industry Globally, Hong Kong's most noted contribution in terms of arts and culture has come through its film industry, which is the world's third largest (after Hollywood and Bollywood). Hong Kong films have received worldwide critical acclaim and have been remade into blockbuster films by Hollywood, while Hong Kong directors and actors (such as John Woo, Jackie Chan, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-fat) have gone on to find crossover success in Hollywood. Hong Kong's film industry has suffered since its last heyday of the 1980s and early 1990s, and the government has recently introduced measures to boost the film industry but this has failed miserably. The death of the Arts in Hong Kong is in large part due to an atmosphere of fear and self-censorship that the Hong Kong Chinese imposed upon themselves after the 1997 handover. In the 2006-2007 Policy Address the Chief Executive proposed the establishment of a Hong Kong Film Development Council to support film production in the city. In his 2007-2008 budget,2007-2008 Budget Speech Financial Secretary Henry Tang announced that US$40 million would be earmarked for a new fund to finance film production and professional development within the industry.

Heritage conservation and collective memory After the demolition of the Star Ferry Pier in December 2006 led to widely publicised protests, the government is reviewing its policies on heritage conservation. The Antiquities and Monuments Office has published a list of 491 graded historic structuresList of Graded Historic Buildings in Hong Kong (as at 7 Nov 2008) throughout the territory, though no decision has been made on the extent of protection for these buildings. Hong Kong's collective memory, as manifested in its street markets, food culture, and artisanal traditions, is also being integrated into the city's cultural policy.

Two of his books on the end of the Ottoman dynasty, \\"Son Osmanlƒ±lar\\" (The Last Ottomans) and ≈ûahbaba (literally, The Emperor-father), a biography of Mehmed VI Vahideddin, became best-sellers in Turkey, the former also having been carried over to the screen in the form a TV serial.

It was a large village, divided into several areas under the jurisdiction of many different sheikhs. Gu√©rin, 1874, pp. 343-4 He further noted that ‚ÄúKubataieh stands upon a rocky hill, whose sides are pierced by numerous cisterns of ancient origin, some of which are partly filled up and in bad repair ; others are still used by the people. The latter are closed at the mouth by great round stones in form of a mill- stone, pierced in the centre. This second opening is itself closed by another stone, which is taken away when the water is drawn. This system of closed wells and cisterns by means of a stone is of extreme antiquity.‚Äù Gu√©rin, 1874, pp. 343-4; as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 156 In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described it as a ‚Äúlarge stone village on a slope, east of a small plain which is full of olives.

In July 2016, clashes between Palestinians and Israeli armed forces occurred during a house demolition by Israel of a man accused of being involved in an attack in Jerusalem. The Israeli military reported that the military convoy that carried out the demolition was met by Molotov cocktails and fire from improvised guns. Palestinian officials reported six Palestinians wounded in the exchange, with the Israeli military confirming three Palestinians hit. Israel calls the demolition of homes of attackers as a deterrent to violence, while human rights groups and Palestinians condemn it as a form of collective punishment. {  Salah al-Din mosque in the town of Qabatiya  Teachers at the boys' high school, 1980  Khaled Ibn Al-Waleed Mosque in 2019  Recent Photo of Salah Al Din mosque (2019) }  References  Bibliography    (Monro, 1835, vol 1, p. 277, cited in Robinson and Smith, vol 3, p. 154)  * External links * Welcome To Qabatiya *Qabatya, Welcome to Palestine *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 11: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Google-map *WolframAlpha ‚Äì Qabatiya *Population statistics Cities in the West Bank Jenin Governorate Municipalities of the State of Palestine ","title":"Qabatiya"},{"id":"9777907","title":"Roman Catholic Diocese of Lamego"},{"id":"9777909","text":"New San Jose State Stadium was a planned a multi-use stadium in San Jose, California.

He also was a guard and captain on the basketball team and ran track at Bradley. Baseball Handley originally signed with the Cincinnati Reds, but Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided the contract, resulting in Handley's signing with Pittsburgh for a $20,000 bonus.

He was a rookie Pirate regular at second base in 1937, and a full- or part-time third baseman from 1938 through 1941. His most productive season came in 1938, when he posted career-numbers in games played (139), runs (91), hits (153), doubles (25), home runs (6) and runs batted in (51). He also was considered in the Most Valuable Player vote. In 1939 Handley hit a career- high average of .285 and tied for the National League lead in stolen bases (17), despite suffering a serious beaning that kept him out of the lineup for 52 games. He also was hurt in an automobile accident before the 1942 season, but returned in 1945 to hit .298 in 98 games.

Sprague de Camp, the sixth book of his Viagens Interplanetarias series and the fourth of its subseries of stories set on the fictional planet Krishna. Chronologically it is the seventh Krishna novel. It was first published in the magazine Science Fiction Stories for May 1958. It was first published in book form in hardcover by Avalon Books, also in 1958, and in paperback by Airmont Books in 1963. It has been reissued a number of times since by various publishers. For the later standard edition of Krishna novels it was published together with The Virgin of Zesh in the paperback collection The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid by Ace Books in 1983. An E-book edition was published by Gollancz's SF Gateway imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpageAmazon.com entry for e-book edition The novel has also been translated into Italian and German. The Tower of Zanid was de Camp's last Krishna novel for a quarter century, the next one (The Hostage of Zir) not appearing until 1977. As with all of the \\"Krishna\\" novels, the title of The Tower of Zanid has a \\"Z\\" in it, a practice de Camp claimed to have devised to keep track of them. Short stories in the series do not follow the practice, nor do Viagens Interplanetarias works not set on Krishna.  Plot summary  Anthony Fallon, the Terran deposed as king of the Krishnan island of Zamba in the earlier novel The Queen of Zamba, has fallen on hard times, having failed to regain his throne and lost his second wife Julnar as well. Currently he resides in Zanid, capital of the kingdom of Balhib, where he makes a precarious living as a city guardsman and spy for the nomad realm of Qaath. Cover art from the first combined edition of The Virgin of Zesh & The Tower of Zanid by L. Sprague de Camp, Ace Books, 1983, featuring a scene from The Tower of Zanid. Fallon's life is made more complicated when Terran consul Percy Mjipa enlists him to help archaeologist Julian Fredro study the Safq, an ancient snail- shaped tower forbidden to all but members of the native Yeshite cult. Fallon is also to look into recent disappearances of Terran scientists in the region. Mjipa, introduced in this novel as a secondary character, would go on to appear in three other Krishna novels; the chronologically earlier The Hostage of Zir and The Prisoner of Zhamanak (the latter as the protagonist), and the chronologically later The Swords of Zinjaban. Balancing Fallon's mutually exclusive allegiances while continuing to work toward recovering his kingdom is a difficult undertaking, which he realizes could prove fatal‚Äìparticularly when the Safq turns out to be hosting a secret project to reproduce Terran weaponry as a secret weapon for the war with Qaath. Then in the climactic battle the Qaathians unleash their own secret weapon, designed and built by the captive scientists. In the ensuing chaos Fallon figures the best thing to do is cut and run with the proceeds of his espionage, only to be undone by the fallout of a rare good deed, his earlier rescue of missionary Welcome Wagner. Anthony Fallon would reappear, reformed, in the later Krishna novel The Swords of Zinjaban as a Terran official. Setting The planet Krishna is de Camp's premier creation in the Sword and Planet genre, representing both a tribute to the Barsoom novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs and an attempt to \\"get it right\\", reconstructing the concept logically, without what he regarded as Burroughs' biological and technological absurdities. De Camp intended the stories as \\"pure entertainment in the form of light, humorous, swashbuckling, interplanetary adventure-romances - a sort of sophisticated Burroughs-type story, more carefully thought out than their prototypes.\\"De Camp, L. Sprague. \\"The Krishna Stories\\" (Essay, in New Frontiers, v. 1, no. 1, Dec. 1959, page 3.) As dated in the 1959 version of de Camp's essay \\"The Krishna Stories\\" and James Cambias's GURPS Planet Krishna (a 1997 gaming guide to the Viagens series authorized by de Camp), the action of The Virgin of Zesh takes place in the year 2168 AD.,De Camp, L.

Reception P. Schuyler Miller called the book \\"a back- handed sequel to 'The Queen of Zamba,'\\" noting that its hero \\"was the rather off-stage villain of the earlier book.\\" He finds it \\"fun, but it would be a better book and even more fun except for the author's ingrown integrity,\\" because of which \\"[t]he languages, titles and names of the various races are worked out to the last detail, with proper attention for dialect, and the resulting jawbreakers are pretty hard to remember, the translation into English is deliberately awkward-sounding, and there isn't quite enough zing in the book to be worth the trouble.\\" Comparing it to Rogue Queen, which he considers \\"the masterpiece of the Viagens series,\\" he notes that \\"[t]his isn't.\\"Miller, P. Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library\\", in Astounding Science Fiction, April 1959, p. 147.

Schuyler. \\"The Reference Library\\", in Analog Science Fact-Science Fiction, March 1964, p. 92. Floyd C.

Mary, Mary was revived off-off-Broadway in 2019 by Retro Productions. Plot The plot focuses on wisecracking cynic Mary and infuriatingly sensible Bob, only recently divorced and who have not seen each other in nine months, who meet at his apartment in the hope they can avert an audit by the Internal Revenue Service. A snowstorm forces Mary to spend the night, and the following morning, mutual friend and lawyer Oscar, Hollywood heartthrob and neighbor Dirk Winston, and Bob's considerably younger fianc√©e Tiffany arrive on the scene. The comedy's humor is derived from discussions about income taxes, marriage, alimony, divorce, remarriage, extramarital affairs, weight- loss programs, exercise, and sex. Film Richard L.

In 1835 he went to the University of Parma, and later to that of Pisa, but he had to leave the latter on account of a duel in which he wounded a fellow student whom he had challenged for having made an insulting remark about the Jews.

In Paris he belonged to the circle of Italian patriots; and, on returning to Italy, he soon became one of the leaders in the political movement for the secession of northern Italy from the Austrian Empire and for the union of all the Italian states. Settling in Venice, Levi took part in the Lombardic rebellion against Austria of 1848-49. In 1850 he removed to Turin. After the Franco-Italian-Austrian War of 1859, when the Italian provinces of Austria were united with the Kingdom of Italy (1860), he was elected to the Italian assembly at Florence, where, as a member of the Liberal Party, he championed the cause of equality of rights and religious freedom. He was a member of the National Assembly until 1879, when, being defeated, he retired from politics. Levi wrote many poems, especially during his stay at Venice, and a large number of political and war songs, among these the well-known ode to Pope Pius IX, who in 1846, upon his election to the papal chair, was hailed as liberator, but who in 1849 changed his political views and became strongly reactionary. Through all Levi's works his great love for Italy and for Judaism is evident. Levi was the author of: Patria ed Affetti (Venice, 1849), a collection of poems; Gli Martiri del 1799 (Turin, 1850), a drama; Martirio e Redenzione (ib. 1859); Del Navarra a Magenta (ib. 1866; revised ed., 1884, with a fantastic allegorical dialogue as a second part); Vita di Pensiero (Milan, 1875); Vita d'Azione (Turin, 1882); Il Semitismo (ib. 1884); La Mente di Michelangelo (ib. 1890); Giordano Bruno (ib. 1894). Il Profeta Levi's principal work, however, is the great drama Il Profeta. Its theme Levi describes in his introduction as follows: \\"I intend to hold a mirror before my contemporaries, in which they may see their errors, faults, and mistakes, and thereby learn to despise them; at the same time placing before them a high ideal, which they should strive to live up to.\\" To this end he selected the story of Jeremiah. The drama treats in five acts of the war between Zedekiah and Nebuchadnezzar. Jeremiah foresees the fall of Jerusalem, if the people do not give up their worship of Baal, repent of their sins, and return to the only true God. Jeremiah the prophet and Ananias, the priest of Baal, respectively exhort and try to persuade the king and the Jews to follow them. Ananias is successful; Jeremiah is thrown into prison; and Jerusalem falls when attacked by the invading army. The Temple is destroyed, and the Jews are led into captivity. Jeremiah's prophecy is fulfilled. When Jeremiah is thrown into prison his daughter Rachel falls into the hands of Ananias, who tries to win her for himself. His suit proving unsuccessful, he orders her to be sacrificed to Moloch, when God intercedes. Lightning kills Ananias, and Rachel is liberated by her lover, Emanuel. The last words of Ananias are: \\"Uno Infinito hai vinto\\" (end of Act 3). Emanuel joins the ranks of the defender of Jerusalem, is mortally wounded, and dies in the arms of his beloved. Spiritually Jewdom has conquered over heathendom, and Rachel has returned pure to her lover; but physically Jewdom is defeated. Rachel loses her lover and must go into exile; this exile will, however, purify not the Jews alone, but through them the world, and will prepare man for a better future. The dialogue which follows the drama in the 1884 edition has very little connection with it. It is sustained by Emanuel, the representative of prophetism, and by Ahasuerus, the representative of mankind, and treats mainly of Rome.

Cross-cultural and international education is defined as the examination of education from diverse perspectives in international, transnational, and global contexts. The topics that students address in this program transcend national boundaries. This differs from multicultural education which specifically examines issues within a single nation. The program connects cultural and international understanding with educational theory and practice through a unique combination of courses from several disciplines at BGSU. Students construct the academic basis for their program from select courses in the College of Education and Human Development and other colleges on campus. The students then apply this academic foundation to a practical cross-cultural/ international internship experience. Current students are participating in a variety of internships in formal and non- formal settings, including international sites in China, South Africa, Vietnam and Belize, and domestically with Indigenous students in Alaska and Mexican migrant populations in Ohio. Students complete the MACIE program with a capstone seminar or a master's thesis.Retrieved from www.macie.org on 11/26/10  Cultural Studies  This master's degree is a one or two year degree that allows students to engage the heterogeneous body of theories and practices associated with cultural studies and critical theory in the critical investigation of culture.

Dispute Resolution  Dispute Resolution as a master's degree program, a first in Australia, focuses on the wide range of non-adversarial dispute resolution processes. The subject accommodate distinct streams that include commerce, family, community and court-annexed programs. This subject is an introduction to the philosophy, theory and practice of an area of increasing importance in all professions, business and government. Dispute resolution processes are now integrated into the adversarial framework as well as being applied to an ever-widening range of private and public situations. This emerging practice of professional dispute resolution converge within and outside the legal profession.  Divinity  The Master of Divinity (M.Div.) is the first professional degree in ministry (in the United States and Canada) and is a common academic degree among theological seminaries. It typically takes students three years to complete. Other theology degree titles used are Master of Theology (Th.M. or M.Th.), Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.), Master of Arts in Practical Theology (M.A.P.T.), and Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.).  Education  Master of Education degrees are similar to MA, MS, and MSc, where the subject studied is education. In some states in the United States, teachers can earn teacher licensure with a bachelor's degree, but some states require a master's degree within a set number of years as continuing education. Other education-related master's degrees conferred in the United States are Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.), Master of Science in Instruction (M.S.I.), Master of Science in Education (M.S.Ed. or M.S.E.), Master of Arts in Education (M.A.Ed.), Master of Adult Education (M.Ad. Ed.), and Master of Music Education (M.Mus.Ed.). A Master of Education degree, or M.Ed., is a professional, graduate-level degree geared toward individuals who are seeking to move beyond the classroom into administrative-level positions or other specialized roles. It is generally not a degree leading to teaching at a college level, though it can very well prepare individuals for employment in higher education management and student personnel administration, as well as becoming adjunct college instructors. Many online M.Ed. programs offer a specialization in educational leadership. Over the past few years, however, the opportunity to specialize in educational technology has also become increasingly available. While many M.Ed. graduates seek to become principals and school district administrators, others become reading or technology specialists. The Master of Education degree is sometimes referred to as a practitioner's degree, because of its immediate and practical application to the school environment. A Master of Arts in Education is perhaps the most flexible degree in the field, and often allows an educator to specialize in one of several concentrations. In addition to taking core classes in educational philosophy, child psychology, educational ethics, and education research methods, teachers pursuing this advanced education degree generally specialize in one of several fields. Educational professionals who are looking to remain in the classroom often opt to pursue an online Master of Arts in Education with a concentration in either elementary or secondary education. At many universities, a concentration in special education is also available. Individuals who are looking to leave the classroom often pursue concentrations in educational leadership, technology, or counseling. This list is by no means complete, as each university offers its own options for specialization. Overall, the M.A. in Education includes more of the theoretical study of education than most of the other advanced degree options. The Master of Arts in Education also offers an extremely high level of flexibility, and can help to advance careers both inside and outside of the classroom. While the other advanced degree programs tend to be more widely known, the Master of Science in Education can also provide professional educators with the tools needed for success in the classroom and advancement in educational leadership. As the name suggests, this degree program provides ample opportunity for the student to take a more scientific approach to the study of education. Many of those individuals who choose to follow the scientific route concentrate on topics like instructional technology or educational research. In many instances, M.S. Education programs that take a scientific slant tend to include coursework in statistics and educational evaluation and measurement. Educators who pursue the more scientific path generally leave the classroom, and in many instances, the school. They have excellent job prospects in the educational research sector. Many go on to work with school districts, state governments, or private research organizations to assess student performance and suggest policies that will boost student achievement. Others supervise technology initiatives for schools or school districts, work in distance education, or pursue doctoral studies. Other individuals who pursue an MS in Education opt for a less scientific course of study, such as educational leadership, or literacy. In some instances, these programs resemble the previously discussed Master of Education degree, but at other schools, these programs place a much greater focus on the scientific aspects of studying education. In either case, the same opportunities for advancement as a school administrator should be available, regardless of whether one has earned a degree of Master of Science in Education, a Master of Arts in Education, or a Master of Education.  Educational Technology  The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) defines the field as \\"the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources.\\". Programs typically include courses on instructional design, learning theories, educational media, instructional messaging, related theory, and research methods. Some institutions use the term instructional technology to refer to their programs. Although some experts within the field distinguish between educational and instructional technology, on a practical level, the two are essentially synonymous. Master's in Educational Technology programs are offered in at least one university in nearly every US state, and in many countries outside of the United States, including Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, South Korea, and Turkey. One of the oldest programs in North America is based in the Department of Education at Concordia University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, which has graduated approximately 2,000 master's degree and over 150 PhD students in its 50 years. Students can study full- or part-time, preparing to use their skills and knowledge to design curricula and programs, integrate technology, advise on educational technology policy, and conduct related research for schools, higher education, workplace learning, and community and informal learning. The University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada offers a part-time program within the Faculty of Education, focusing on curriculum design and technology integration. The one-year professional Masters in Educational Technology and Applied Learning Science (METALS) is an interdisciplinary program offer by Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In the United States, engineering candidates are typically awarded MS degrees, although a growing number of schools also offer an MEng (e.g. the University of California, Berkeley). The distinction between the two programs varies between schools, but the MS is largely considered an academic degree, whereas the MEng is a professional degree. In the UK and Canada, candidates are generally awarded MSc, MASc or MEng degrees. In Canada, the Master of Applied Science (MASc) is awarded to master's degree students with a research focus (having completed work leading to a thesis), while an MEng is awarded to master's degree students with a coursework focus and the completion of a research paper. The distinction between MASc and MEng is not definite since some universities grant only an MEng and some universities grant only an MASc, be it either research or coursework-focused. In Francophone universities, the Master's Degree is referred to as a Ma√Ætrise. The Master of Applied Science translates to Ma√Ætrise des sciences appliqu√©es and is abbreviated MScA. The Ma√Ætrise in Canada is not equivalent to the Ma√Ætrise in France, nor is the Baccalaur√©at. Canadian French-language degree and title nomenclature are consistent to North American custom. The MEng title translates to MIng, though this title cannot be used in one's signature in Qu√©bec (nor can BIng), as the title ing. (equivalent of P.Eng. in other provinces) is reserved for members of the provincial board of engineers, the Ordre des ing√©nieurs du Qu√©bec. The Master of Science in Engineering is a post-graduate degree to be differentiated from the Master of Engineering. It requires a thesis and qualifies students holding it to apply for a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering.

Offered within United States law schools, students of an M.J. curriculum are often business professionals and/or Juris Doctor degree holders; who wish to enhance their knowledge in a specialized field of law. A Master of Jurisprudence is highly beneficial for those that need an in-depth understanding of the law within current executive level positions.M.J. students are required to develop a comprehensive understanding of the operation of law as it applies to a specified area of law. An M.J. program combines a combination of graduate level legal courses with MBA-style courses in concentrated areas of study. Master of Jurisprudence program offerings include but aren't limited to degrees in Business and Corporate Governance Law, Health Law and Policy, and Child and Family Law. The M.J. program is typically 24 credit hours and can be completed in two years; or longer depending on the law student's enrollment status.lMaster of Jurisprudence Wikipedia.  Landscape Architecture  The Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) degree is a professional degree in the field of landscape architecture.  Laws  Master of Laws (LL.M.) is a graduate law degree, pursued after earning a first law degree in the U.S. or abroad, such as a LL.B. or J.D.. The LL.M. program typically lasts one year if taken full-time. For foreign law graduates, the LL.M. is similar to a 'study abroad program' and offers a general overview of the American Legal System. Domestic U.S. law graduates pursue the LL.M. for different reasons, largely academic. With the exception of LL.M. Programs in highly specialized areas where advanced knowledge in a field is useful (e.g., Taxation, International Taxation, Intellectual Property; etc.), the Master of Laws is designed for those intending to teach law, whereas the J.D. is a professional doctorate.  Leadership  The Master of Science in Leadership is an alternative to, not a substitute for, the traditional Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. The MSL degree requirements may include some business courses that are required in an MBA program. However, this degree program concentrates heavily on leader-follower interactions, cross-cultural communications, coaching, team development, project leadership, and behavioral motivation theories; it does not concentrate on financial or quantitative analysis, marketing, or accounting which are common in MBA programs. The degree program is appealing to people in well-established careers already. The MSL degree is similar to the Master of Organizational Leadership (MSOL) degree.  Liberal Studies  The Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) Master of Liberal Arts (MLA, ALM) and Master of Liberal Studies (MLS) are interdisciplinary master's degrees. Characteristics that distinguish these degrees from others include curricular flexibility, interdisciplinary synthesis via Master's thesis or capstone project, and optional part-time enrollment.  Library Science  A Master of Library Science (MLS) degree is the culmination of an interdisciplinary program encompassing information science, information management, librarianship, and/or related topics. Modern variants include Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS), Master of Science in Information Studies (MSIS), Master of Librarianship, Master of Information Management and Systems (MIMS), Master of Science in Library Science (MSLS), and others. Some universities use standard degree titles such as Master of Arts while others, such as the University of Michigan, use Master of Arts in Library Science (AMLS). (University of Iowa) and Master of Science (University of Illinois) for their Library Science master's degrees.  Logistics, Trade, and Transportation  The Master of Science in Logistics, Trade, and Transportation (MS LTT) at the University of Southern Mississippi is an interdisciplinary program of 30 total credit hours.

These courses are delivered in several flexible formats including on- line, in-person, and executive/hybrid format to allow practitioners to continue to work while pursuing the degree.  Management  The Master of Arts in Management (MAM), in the United States, is a professional graduate degree that prepares business professionals for senior level management positions and executive leadership of organizations and corporations (for- profit, nonprofit and public sector). The business MAM degree should not be confused with Master's degrees in Arts Management, which may be more numerous in the U.S.. The MAM degree is a specialized degree that focuses studies on all areas of business, e.g., strategic planning and leadership, marketing analysis and strategy, operations management, project management, human resource management, organizational design and development, finance, accounting, management and contract negotiations, statistical methods and applications, economic theory, and research. A characteristic that tends to distinguish the MAM and MBA business degrees from other Master's degrees in business is the absence of in-depth study within one particular area of business. M.S. business degrees typically focus on traditional areas like Finance, Accounting, and Information Systems. The MAM student's courses cover advanced management and strategic leadership as they apply to all areas of business, e.g., accounting, finance, operations management marketing, strategic planning, and human resources. The MAM student \\"masters the art of management.\\" MBA and MAM degrees are both Master's level business degrees that cover broad and general content. Master of Science programs in Management involve course work focusing within one areas of business such as Management Information Systems, Finance, Accounting and other areas.  Management in the Network Economy  Management in the Network Economy is a one- or two-year interdisciplinary post-graduate program that uniquely blends information economics, technology management and business administration, in order to forge leaders able to understand and manage the complexity of organizations and markets in the digital economy.

A full-time student can expect to complete the degree program in 18 to 24 months. A part- time student could take anywhere from 3 to 5 years to complete a MSN program. Completion of a MSN/NP program earns nursing professionals the title of Nurse Practitioner (NP). While registered nurses administer medication and perform basic diagnostic tests, nurse practitioner's order and analyze the diagnostic tests, as well as prescribe treatments. Nurse Practitioner's entry level salary is typically $20,000 more than a Registered Nurse will earn.  Occupational Therapy  The Master of Occupational Therapy is awarded to students who have completed a post-graduate course of study, and is now the entry-level degree for this profession. This degree is sometimes also conferred as a Master of Science in Occupational Therapy.  Organizational Leadership  MSOL is a multi-disciplinary masters program that focuses on values-based leadership. The courses focus on the development of relationships between organizational members, effective decision-making processes, and an understanding of how modern technology can best support leaders. The MSOL degree is an alternative, not a substitute for an MBA. The programs are different in content and purpose. The MSOL degree is multidisciplinary and focuses more on people and organization issues, less on business topics such as finance, accounting and marketing. For example, in MSOL you will take courses in psychology and philosophy as well as courses in business and management. The MSOL degree is intended for those who are already established in a career. In contrast, those who are preparing to enter the world of work or change careers often seek an MBA degree. Although the MBA degree is more widely known, degree programs like the MSOL are being developed across the country because of increasing demand for ethical organizational leadership.  Pacific International Affairs  The Master of Pacific International Affairs degree is a professional master's degree that provides training in various aspects of international affairs including International Business Management, International Politics, Public Policy, International Environmental Policy and Development and Non-Profit Management. The program requires mastery in a Pacific Rim language, quantitative and economic analysis techniques and a regional focus.

Failure to complete the course, but having completed three years, usually awards the student a bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Science.  Philosophy  In the United States and Canada, a Master of Philosophy or Magister Philosophiae (MPhil) degree is sometimes awarded to ABD (all but dissertation) doctoral candidates who have completed all coursework, passed their written and oral examinations, and met any other special requirements before beginning work on the doctoral dissertation. Such programs generally award the M.A. to students who have completed all coursework and preliminary exams (about two years after the B.A.), and the M.Phil. after advanced exams (comprehensives) and all language requirements have been met, and a dissertation topic approved (usually a year after the M.A.). In other countries, assuming all requirements are met, the MPhil degree is generally awarded after about one year of full-time study towards a doctorate. The MPhil is considered equivalent to the former French DEA (Dipl√¥me d'√©tudes approfondies) and Spanish DEA (Diploma de Estudios Avanzados).  Physician Assistant Studies  The Master of Physician Assistant Studies is a professional degree providing training in the profession of a physician assistant to practice medicine based on the medical school model. This degree is also sometimes seen as an MS in Physician Assistant Studies (MSPAS), the Master of Physician Assistant Practice (MPAP)  Professional Counseling  The Masters of Arts in Professional Counseling (MAPC) is a two-year program that prepares individuals for the independent professional practice of psychological counseling, involving the rendering of therapeutic services to individuals and groups experiencing psychological problems and exhibiting distress symptoms. Includes instruction in counseling theory, therapeutic intervention strategies, patient/counselor relationships, testing and assessment methods and procedures, group therapy, marital and family therapy, child and adolescent therapy, supervised counseling practice, ethical standards, and applicable regulations.  Professional Studies  The Master's of Professional Studies (MPS or MProfStuds) is a terminal interdisciplinary degree and is sometimes used by programs that do not fit into any traditional categories. In some cases it is used as replacement for an MFA for programs with heavy technology focuses like NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program. Other programs use it for Organizational Studies or interdisciplinary Social Science programs.  Professional Writing  The Master of Professional Writing (MPW) degree is a professional graduate degree program that prepares candidates for a wide variety of writing-related positions in business, education, publishing, and the arts. Coursework in three concentrations - applied writing, composition and rhetoric, and creative writing - allows students to gain theoretical and practical knowledge in various fields of professional writing.

There are a limited number of universities and schools worldwide to be accredited by the Global Accreditation Center of the Project Management Institute¬Æ PMI, they must meet the standards of the leading association for project management professionals.  Public Administration  The Master of Public Administration (M.P.A. or MPA; MAP in Qu√©bec) degree is one of several Master's level professional public affairs degrees that provides training in public policy and project and program implementation (more recently known as public management). MPA programs focus on public administration at the local, state/provincial, national/federal and supranational levels, as well as in the nongovernmental organization (NGO) and nonprofit sectors. In the course of its history the MPA degree has become more interdisciplinary by drawing from fields such as economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, and regional planning in order to equip MPA graduates with skills and knowledge covering a broad range of topics and disciplines relevant to the public sector. A core curriculum of a typical MPA program usually includes courses on microeconomics, public finance, research methods / statistics, policy process and policy analysis, ethics, public management, leadership, planning & GIS, and program evaluation/performance measurement. Depending on their interest, MPA students can focus their studies on a variety of public sector fields such as urban planning, emergency management, transportation, health care (particularly public health), economic development, urban management, community development, education, non-profits, information technology, environmental policy, etc.  Public Health  The Master of Public Health and Master of Science in Public Health degrees are awarded to students who have completed a \\"post-graduate course\\" of study in Public Health. The MPH is considered a management/leadership degree specific to the fields related to public health while the MSPH is considered an academic degree, with a focus on empirical research methodologies.  Public Management  The Master of Public Management is offered through Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College. This masters level degree is conferred upon those students who have completed a post-graduate course of study, and is usually associated with broadening the students' understanding of social, political, technological and economic processes, as well as paradigms of organizational and human behavior.  Public Policy  The Master of Public Policy is a master level professional degree that provides training in policy analysis and program evaluation at public policy schools. Over time, the curriculum of Master of Public Policy and the Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) degrees have blended and converged, due to the realization that policy analysis and program evaluation could benefit from an understanding of public administration, and vice versa. However, MPP programs still place more emphasis in policy analysis, research and evaluation, while MPA programs place more emphasis on operationalization of public policies and the design of effective programs and projects to achieve public policy goals. Over the years MPP programs have become more interdisciplinary drawing from economics, sociology, anthropology, politics, and regional planning. Depending on the interest, MPP students can concentrate in many policy areas including, but not limited to, urban policy, global policy, social policy, health policy, non- profit management, transportation, economic development, education, information technology, etc. Students interested in pursuing a degree program focused entirely on global public policy can also consider Master of Public Policy and Global Affairs (M.P.P.G.A) programs.  Public Service  The MPS program provides a multi-disciplinary training that equips you with the knowledge, skills and experience you need for a career within any level of government in Canada.With rapid technological changes, shifting demographics, economic uncertainty and globalization, the Canadian public service needs employees with specific knowledge and ingenuity to ensure resources, organizational capacity and effective communications are in place to meet the challenges ahead. Whether working in policy research, financial management or community development, professionally trained public servants are essential to good government. \\"The Public Service today must address a significant demographic challenge. For the first time, it has more employees over 45 than under, and it is facing the imminent retirement of a generation of valued employees ‚Ä¶ In this context, how can we ensure that Canada continues to have a strong and effective Public Service to help Canadians meet the important challenges facing the country in the years ahead?\\"Kevin Lynch, the former Clerk of the Privy Council, in his second report to the Prime Minister, February 2008. The Master of Arts in Public Service (MAPS) degree is a professional graduate degree program which offers specializations in areas of administration of justice, dispute resolution, health care administration, leadership studies, and non-profit studies.

The program is within the College of Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota.  Social Work  The Master of Social Work (MSW) is a professional graduate degree preparing students to become professional social workers, typically in either direct practice or community practice. MSW programs require students to complete an extensive field practicum, under mentorship of a senior social worker. MSW programs in the United States are accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The degree title MSW is not used in the US by all social work schools. The University of Chicago uses A.M. and Columbia University uses M.S. to name a few of the exceptions.  Strategic Leadership  The Master of Science in Strategic Leadership (MSSL) graduate degree is an Executive Program in Organizational Leadership and Management Development, teaching the skills and knowledge in working effectively with people, organizational systems, and complex information. MSSL objectives embody development of a leadership skill set, strategies for problem solving, and solutions to facilitate and manage change applicable in business and not-for-profit environments.  Taxation  The Master of Science in Taxation (MST) is a professional graduate degree designed for Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and other tax professionals. See also: Master of Accountancy  Teaching  Coursework and practice leading to a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) degree is intended to prepare individuals for a teaching career in a specific subject of middle and/or secondary-level curricula (i.e., middle or high school). The MAT differs from the MEd degree in that the course requirements are dominated by classes in the subject area to be taught (e.g., foreign language, math, science, etc.) rather than educational theory; and that the MAT candidate does not already hold a teaching credential whereas the MEd candidate will. The MAT often is the initial teacher education program for those who hold a bachelor's degree in the subject that they intend to teach. Work toward most MAT degrees will, however, necessarily include classes on educational theory in order to meet program and state requirements. Work toward the MAT degree may also include practica (i.e., student teaching). This abbreviation is also sometimes used to refer to a Master's in Theology (see ThM). The Master of Arts in Teaching, or MAT, differs from the M.Ed. and the other Master's degrees in education primarily in that the majority of coursework focuses on the subject to be taught (i.e. history, English, math, biology, etc.) rather than on educational theory. While some online MAT programs offer a more general overview of the foundations of effective teaching, most MAT programs combine the study of widely established ‚Äòbest practices‚Äô in the classroom with a focus on teaching within a specific discipline. Either way, the MA in Teaching is truly a teaching degree. Individuals who pursue the Master of Arts in Teaching generally choose to remain in the classroom. An MAT can also provide an educator with the appropriate credentials to become a department chairperson. The online Master of Arts in Teaching can offer educational professionals an increase in earning power along with instruction in the most up-to-date and effective instructional techniques.  Theology  The Master of Divinity (M.Div.) is the first professional degree in ministry (in the United States and Canada) and is a common academic degree among theological seminaries. It is typically three years in length. Other theology degree titles used are Master of Theology (Th.M. or M.Th.), Master of Theological Studies (M.T.S.), Master of Arts in Practical Theology (M.A.P.T.), and Master of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.).  Urban Planning  The Master of Urban Planning (MUP), Master of City and Regional Planning (MCRP), Master of Urban and Regional Planning (MURP), Master of Environmental Design (MEDes (planning)) and Master of City Planning (MCP) are professional degrees in the study of urban planning.  Urban Studies  The degree is primarily focused on urban issues including planning issues.

The environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM) is a scanning electron microscope (SEM) that allows for the option of collecting electron micrographs of specimens that are wet, uncoated, or both by allowing for a gaseous environment in the specimen chamber. Although there were earlier successes at viewing wet specimens in internal chambers in modified SEMs, the ESEM with its specialized electron detectors (rather than the standard Everhart-Thornley detector) and its differential pumping systems, to allow for the transfer of the electron beam from the high vacuums in the gun area to the high pressures attainable in its specimen chamber, make it a complete and unique instrument designed for the purpose of imaging specimens in their natural state. The instrument was designed originally by Gerasimos Danilatos while working at the University of New South Wales.  History  The world's first ESEM prototype Starting with Manfred von Ardenne, early attempts have been reported on the examination of specimens inside \\"environmental\\" cells with water or atmospheric gas, in conjunction with conventional and scanning transmission types of electron microscopes. However, the first images of wet specimens in an SEM were reported by Lane in 1970 when he injected a fine jet of water vapor over the point of observation at the specimen surface; the gas diffused away into the vacuum of the specimen chamber without any modification to the instrument. Further, Shah and Beckett reported the use of differentially pumped cells or chambers to presumably maintain botanical specimens conductive in order to allow the use of the absorbed specimen current mode for signal detection in 1977 and in 1979. Spivak et al. reported the design and use of various environmental cell detection configurations in an SEM including differential pumping, or the use of electron transparent films to maintain the specimens in their wet state in 1977. Those cells, by their nature, had only limited application use and no further development was done. In 1974, an improved approach was reported by Robinson with the use of a backscattered electron detector and differential vacuum pumping with a single aperture and the introduction of water vapor around 600 Pa pressure at the freezing point of temperature. However, neither of those approaches produced a stable enough instrument for routine operation. Starting work with Robinson in 1978 at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Danilatos undertook a thorough quantitative study and experimentation that resulted in a stable operation of the microscope at room temperature and high pressures up to 7000 Pa, as reported in 1979. In the following years, Danilatos, working independently, reported a series of works on the design and construction of an environmental or atmospheric scanning electron microscope (ASEM) capable of working at any pressure from vacuum up to one atmosphere. These early works involved the optimization of the differential pumping system together with backscattered electron (BSE) detectors until 1983, when he invented the use of the environmental gas itself as a detection medium. The decade of 1980 closed with the publication of two major works comprehensively dealing with the foundations of ESEM and the theory of the gaseous detection device (GDD). Furthermore, in 1988, the first commercial ESEM was exhibited in New Orleans by ElectroScan Corporation, a venture capital company wishing to commercialize the Danilatos ESEM. The company placed an emphasis on the secondary electron (SE) mode of the GDD and secured the monopoly of the commercial ESEM with a series of additional key patents. Philips and FEI companies succeeded ElectroScan in providing commercial ESEM instruments. With the expiration of key patents and assistance by Danilatos, new commercial instruments have been recently added to the market by LEO (succeeded by Carl Zeiss SMT). Further improvements have been reported to date from work on the original experimental prototype ESEM in Sydney and from numerous other workers using the commercial ESEM in a wide variety of applications worldwide. An early comprehensive bibliography was compiled in 1993 by Danilatos, whilst a more recent survey can be found in a Ph.D. Thesis by Morgan (2005). Microscope Schematic of an ESEM. An ESEM employs a scanned electron beam and electromagnetic lenses to focus and direct the beam on the specimen surface in an identical way as a conventional SEM. A very small focused electron spot (probe) is scanned in a raster form over a small specimen area. The beam electrons interact with the specimen surface layer and produce various signals (information) that are collected with appropriate detectors. The output of these detectors modulates, via appropriate electronics, the screen of a monitor to form an image that corresponds to the small raster and information, pixel by pixel, emanating from the specimen surface. Beyond these common principles, the ESEM deviates substantially from an SEM in several respects, all of which are important in the correct design and operation of the instrument. The outline below highlights these requirements and how the system works. =Differential pumping= Isodensity contours of gas flowing through aperture. Basic ESEM gas pressure stages. The specimen chamber sustaining the high-pressure gaseous environment is separated from the high vacuum of the electron optics column with at least two small orifices customarily referred to as pressure-limiting apertures (PLA). The gas leaking through the first aperture (PLA1) is quickly removed from the system with a pump that maintains a much lower pressure in the downstream region (i.e. immediately above the aperture). This is called differential pumping. Some gas escapes further from the low pressure region (stage 1) through a second pressure limiting aperture (PLA2) into the vacuum region of the column above, which constitutes a second stage differential pumping (stage 2). A schematic diagram shows the basic ESEM gas pressure stages including the specimen chamber, intermediate cavity and upper electron optics column. The corresponding pressures achieved are p0>>p1>>p2, which is a sufficient condition for a microscope employing a tungsten type of electron gun. Additional pumping stages may be added to achieve an even higher vacuum as required for a LaB6 and field emission type electron guns. The design and shape of a pressure limiting aperture are critical in obtaining the sharpest possible pressure gradient (transition) through it. This is achieved with an orifice made on a thin plate and tapered in the downstream direction as shown in the accompanying isodensity contours of a gas flowing through the PLA1. This was done with a computer simulation of the gas molecule collisions and movement through space in real time. We can immediately see in the figure of the isodensity contours of gas through aperture that the gas density decreases by about two orders of magnitude over the length of a few aperture radii. This is a quantitatively vivid demonstration of a first principle that enables the separation of the high-pressure specimen chamber from the low pressure and vacuum regions above. By such means, the gas flow fields have been studied in a variety of instrument situations, in which subsequently the electron beam transfer has been quantified. =Electron beam transfer= Beam transmission along PLA1 axis. electron skirts in main chamber and intermediate stage By the use of differential pumping, an electron beam is generated and propagated freely in the vacuum of the upper column, from the electron gun down to PLA2, from which point onwards the electron beam gradually loses electrons due to electron scattering by gas molecules. Initially, the amount of electron scattering is negligible inside the intermediate cavity, but as the beam encounters an increasingly denser gas jet formed by the PLA1, the losses become significant. After the beam enters the specimen chamber, the electron losses increase exponentially at a rate depending on the prevailing pressure, the nature of gas and the accelerating voltage of the beam. The fraction of beam transmitted along the PLA1 axis can be seen by a set of characteristic curves for a given product p0D, where D is the aperture diameter. Eventually, the electron beam becomes totally scattered and lost, but before this happens, a useful amount of electrons is retained in the original focused spot over a finite distance, which can still be used for imaging. This is possible because the removed electrons are scattered and distributed over a broad area like a skirt (electron skirt) surrounding the focused spot. Because the electron skirt width is orders of magnitude greater than the spot width, with orders of magnitude less current density, the skirt contributes only background (signal) noise without partaking in the contrast generated by the central spot. The particular conditions of pressure, distance and beam voltage over which the electron beam remains useful for imaging purposes has been termed oligo- scattering regime in distinction from single-, plural- and multiple-scattering regimes used in prior literature. For a given beam accelerating voltage and gas, the distance L from PLA1, over which useful imaging is possible, is inversely proportional to the chamber pressure p0. As a rule of thumb, for a 5 kV beam in air, it is required that the product p0L = 1 Pa¬∑m or less. By this second principle of electron beam transfer, the design and operation of an ESEM is centered on refining and miniaturizing all the devices controlling the specimen movement and manipulation, and signal detection. The problem then reduces to achieving sufficient engineering precision for the instrument to operate close to its physical limit, corresponding to optimum performance and range of capabilities. A figure of merit has been introduced to account for any deviation by a given machine from the optimum performance capability. =Signal detection= The electron beam impinges on the specimen and penetrates to a certain depth depending on the accelerating voltage and the specimen nature. From the ensuing interaction, signals are generated in the same way as in an SEM. Thus, we get secondary and backscattered electrons, X-rays and cathodoluminescence (light). All of these signals are detected also in the ESEM but with certain differences in the detector design and principles used. Secondary electrons The conventional secondary electron detector of SEM (Everhart-Thornley detector) cannot be used in the presence of gas because of an electrical discharge (arcing) caused by the kilovolt bias associated with this detector. In lieu of this, the environmental gas itself has been used as a detector for imaging in this mode: =Gaseous detection device= ESEM gaseous detection device (GDD)-principle Efficiency characteristics of gaseous detection device in ESEM In a simple form, the gaseous detection device (GDD) employs an electrode with a voltage up to several hundred volts to collect the secondary electrons in the ESEM. The principle of this SE detector is best described by considering two parallel plates at a distance d apart with a potential difference V generating a uniform electric field E = V/d, and is shown in the accompanying diagram of the GDD. Secondary electrons released from the specimen at the point of beam impingement are driven by the field force towards the anode electrode but the electrons also move radially due to thermal diffusion from collisions with the gas molecules. The variation of electron collection fraction R within anode radius r vs. r/d, for fixed values of anode bias V, at constant product of (pressure¬∑distance) p¬∑d = 1 Pa¬∑m, is given by the accompanying characteristic curves of efficiency of the GDD. All of the secondary electrons are detected if the parameters of this device are properly designed. This clearly shows that practically 100% efficiency is possible within a small radius of collector electrode with only moderate bias. At these levels of bias, no catastrophic discharge takes place. Instead, a controlled proportional multiplication of electrons is generated as the electrons collide with gas molecules releasing new electrons on their way to the anode. This principle of avalanche amplification operates similarly to proportional counters used to detect high energy radiation. The signal thus picked up by the anode is further amplified and processed to modulate a display screen and form an image as in SEM. Notably, in this design and the associated gaseous electron amplification, the product p¬∑d is an independent parameter, so that there is a wide range of values of pressure and electrode geometry which can be described by the same characteristics. The consequence of this analysis is that the secondary electrons are possible to detect in a gaseous environment even at high pressures, depending on the engineering efficacy of any given instrument. As a further characteristic of the GDD, a gaseous scintillation avalanche also accompanies the electron avalanche and, by detection of the light produced with a photo-multiplier, corresponding SE images can be routinely made. The frequency response of this mode has allowed the use of true TV scanning rates. This mode of the detector has been employed by a latest generation of commercial instruments. The novel GDD has become possible first in the ESEM and has produced a practically 100% SE collection efficiency not previously possible with the Everhart-Thornley SE detector where the free trajectories of electrons in vacuum cannot all be bent towards the detector. As is further explained below, backscattered electrons can also be detected by the signal- gas interactions, so that various parameters of this generalized gaseous detector must be controlled to separate the BSE component out of the SE image. Therefore, care has been taken to produce nearly pure SE images with these detectors, then called ESD (environmental secondary detector) and GSED (gaseous secondary electron detector). Backscattered electrons Optimum BSE detectors in ESEM Backscattered electrons (BSE) are those emitted back out from the specimen due to beam-specimen interactions where the electrons undergo elastic and inelastic scattering. They have energies from 50 eV up to the energy of the primary beam by conventional definition. For the detection and imaging with these electrons, scintillating and solid state materials have been used in the SEM. These materials have been adapted and used also in ESEM in addition to the use of the GDD for BSE detection and imaging. BSE pass through the gaseous volume between the electrodes of the GDD and generate additional ionization and avalanche amplification. There is an inner volume where the secondary electrons dominate with small or negligible BSE contribution, whilst the outer gaseous volume is acted upon mainly by the BSE. It is possible to separate the corresponding detection volumes so that near pure BSE images can be made with the GDD. The relationship of relative strength of the two signals, SE and BSE, has been worked out by detailed equations of charge distribution in the ESEM. The analysis of plane electrodes is essential in understanding the principles and requirements involved and by no means indicate the best choice of electrode configuration, as discussed in the published theory of the GDD. =Adapted detectors= Despite the above developments, devoted BSE detectors in the ESEM have played an important role, since the BSE remain a most useful detection mode yielding information not possible to obtain with SE. The conventional BSE detection means have been adapted to operate in the gaseous conditions of the ESEM. The BSE having a high energy are self-propelled to the corresponding detector without significant obstruction by the gas molecules. Already, annular or quadrant solid-state detectors have been employed for this purpose but their geometry is not easily adaptable to the requirements of ESEM for optimum operation. As a result, no much use has been reported of these detectors on genuine ESEM instruments at high pressure. The \\"Robinson\\" BSE detector is tuned for operation up to around 100 Pa at the usual working distance of conventional SEM for the suppression of specimen charging, whilst electron collection at the short working distance and high pressure conditions make it inadequate for the ESEM. However, plastic scintillating materials being easily adaptable have been used for BSE and made to measure according to the strictest requirements of the system. Such work culminated in the use of a pair of wedge-shaped detectors saddling a conical PLA1 and abutting to its rim, so that the dead detection space is reduced to a minimum, as shown in the accompanying figure of optimum BSE detectors. The photon conduction is also optimized by the geometry of the light pipes, whilst the pair of symmetrical detectors allow the separation of topography (signal subtraction) and atomic number contrast (signal addition) of the specimen surface to be displayed with the best ever signal-to-noise-ratio. This scheme has further allowed the use of color by superimposing various signals in a meaningful way. These simple but special detectors became possible in the conditions of ESEM, since bare plastic does not charge by the BSE. However, a very fine wire mesh with appropriate spacing has been proposed as a GDD when gas is present and to conduct negative charge away from the plastic detectors when the gas is pumped out, towards a universal ESEM. Furthermore, since the associated electronics involve a photomultiplier with a wide frequency response, true TV scanning rates are readily available. This is an essential attribute to maintain with an ESEM that enables the examination of processes in situ in real time. In comparison, no such imaging has been reported with the electron avalanche mode of the GDD yet. The use of scintillating BSE detectors in ESEM is compatible with the GDD for simultaneous SE detection, in one way by replacing the top plane electrode with a fine tip needle electrode (detector), which can be easily accommodated with these scintillating BSE detectors. The needle detector and cylindrical geometry (wire) have also been extensively surveyed. Cathodoluminescence Cathodoluminescence is another mode of detection involving the photons generated by the beam-specimen interaction. This mode has been demonstrated to operate also in ESEM by the use of the light pipes after they were cleared of the scintillating coating previously used for BSE detection. However, not much is known on its use outside the experimental prototype originally tested. Clearly, ESEM is more powerful and meaningful under this detection mode than SEM, since the natural surface of any specimen can be examined in the imaging process. Cathodoluminescence is a materials property, but with various specimen treatments required and other limitations in SEM the properties are obscured or altered or impossible to detect and hence this mode of detection has not become popular in the past. The advent of ESEM with its unlimited potential may provoke more interest in this area too, in the future. X-rays The characteristic elemental X-rays produced also in the ESEM can be detected by the same detectors used in the SEM. However, there is an additional complexity arising from the X-rays produced from the electron skirt. These X-rays come from a larger area than in SEM and the spatial resolution is significantly reduced, since the ‚Äúbackground‚Äù X-ray signals cannot be simply ‚Äúsuppressed‚Äù out of the probe interaction volume. However, various schemes have been proposed to solve this problem. These methods involve spot masking, or the extrapolation technique by varying the pressure and calibrating out the effects of skirt, whereby considerable improvement has been achieved. Specimen current In vacuum SEM, the specimen absorbed current mode is used as an alternative mode for imaging of conductive specimens. Specimen current results from the difference of electron beam current minus the sum of SE and BSE current. However, in the presence of gas and the ensuing ionization, it would be problematic to separate this mode of detection out of the generally operating gaseous detection device. Hence this mode, by its definition, may be considered as unsustainable in the ESEM. Shah and Becket assumed the operation of the specimen absorbed current mode if the conductivity of their specimen was assured during the examination of wet botanical samples; in fact, Shah by 1987Shah J (1987). Electronmicroscopy comes to life. No. 208/1987/SPECTRUM/6, published by Central Office of Information obtainable through British Embassy, High Commission or Consulate still considered the ionisation products in gas by SE and BSE as a formidable obstacle, since he believed that the ionisation did not carry any information about the specimen. However, he later embraced to correct role of gaseous ionisation during image formation. =Specimen charging= The electron beam impinging on insulating specimens accumulates negative charge, which creates an electrical potential tending to deflect the electron beam from the scanned point in conventional SEM. This appears as charging artifacts on the image, which are eliminated in the SEM by depositing a conductive layer on the specimen surface prior to examination. Instead of this coating, the gas in the ESEM being electrically conductive prevents negative charge accumulation. The good conductivity of the gas is due to the ionization it undergoes by the incident electron beam and the ionizing SE and BSE signals. This principle constitutes yet another fundamental deviation from conventional vacuum electron microscopy, with enormous advantages. =Contrast and resolution= As a consequence of the way ESEM works, the resolution is preserved relative to the SEM. That is because the resolving power of the instrument is determined by the electron beam diameter which is unaffected by the gas over the useful travel distance before it is completely lost. This has been demonstrated on the commercial ESEMs that provide the finest beam spots by imaging test specimens, i.e. customarily gold particles on a carbon substrate, in both vacuum and gas. However, the contrast decreases accordingly as the electron probe loses current with travel distance and increase of pressure. The loss of current intensity, if necessary, can be compensated by increasing the incident beam current which is accompanied by an increased spot size. Therefore, the practical resolution depends on the original specimen contrast of a given feature, on the design of the instrument that should provide minimal beam and signal losses and on the operator selecting the correct parameters for each application. The aspects of contrast and resolution have been conclusively determined in the referenced work on the foundations of ESEM. Further, in relation to this, we have to consider the radiation effects on the specimen. =Specimen transfer= The majority of available instruments vent their specimen chamber to the ambient pressure (100 kPa) with every specimen transfer. A large volume of gas has to be pumped out and replaced with the gas of interest, usually water vapor supplied from a water reservoir connected to the chamber via some pressure regulating (e.g. needle) valve. In many applications this presents no problem, but with those ones requiring uninterrupted 100% relative humidity, it has been found that the removal of ambient gas is accompanied by lowering the relative humidity below the 100% level during specimen transfer. This clearly defeats the very purpose of ESEM for this class of applications. However, such a problem does not arise with the original prototype ESEM using an intermediate specimen transfer chamber, so that the main chamber is always maintained at 100% relative humidity without interruption during a study. The specimen transfer chamber (tr-ch) shown in the diagram of ESEM gas pressure stages contains a small water reservoir so that the initial ambient air can be quickly pumped out and practically instantaneously replaced with water vapor without going through a limited conductance tube and valve. The main specimen chamber can be maintained at 100% relative humidity, if the only leak of vapor is through the small PLA1, but not during violent pumping with every specimen change. Once the wet specimen is in equilibrium with 100% relative humidity in the transfer chamber, within seconds, a gate valve opens and the specimen is transferred in the main specimen chamber maintained at the same pressure. An alternative approach involving controlled pumping of the main chamber may not solve the problem entirely either because the 100% relative humidity cannot be approached monotonically without any drying, or the process is very slow; inclusion of a water reservoir inside the main chamber means that one cannot lower the relative humidity until after all of the water is pumped out (i.e. a defective control of the relative humidity). Radiation effects During the interaction of an electron beam with a specimen, changes to the specimen at varying degrees are almost inevitable. These changes, or radiation effects, may or may not become visible both in SEM and ESEM. However, such effects are particularly important in the ESEM claiming the ability to view specimens in their natural state. Elimination of the vacuum is a major success towards this aim, so that any detrimental effects from the electron beam itself require special attention. The best way around this problem is to reduce these effects to an absolute minimum with an optimum ESEM design. Beyond this, the user should be aware of their possible existence during the evaluation of results. Usually, these effects appear on the images in various forms due to different electron beam-specimen interactions and processes. The introduction of gas in an electron microscope is tantamount to a new dimension. Thus, interactions between electron beam and gas together with interactions of gas (and its byproducts) with specimen usher a new area of research with as yet unknown consequences. Some of these may at first appear disadvantageous but later overcome, others may yield unexpected results. The liquid phase in the specimen with mobile radicals may yield a host of phenomena again advantageous or disadvantageous. Advantages The presence of gas around a specimen creates new possibilities unique to ESEM: (a) liquid-phase electron microscopy is possible since any pressure greater than 609 Pa allows water to be maintained in its liquid phase for temperatures above 0 ¬∞C, in contrast to the SEM where specimens are desiccated by the vacuum condition. (b) Electrically non-conductive specimens do not require the preparation techniques used in SEM to render the surface conductive, such as the deposition of a thin gold or carbon coating, or other treatments, techniques which also require vacuum in the process. Insulating specimens charge up by the electron beam making imaging problematic or even impossible. (c) The gas itself is used as a detection medium producing novel imaging possibilities, as opposed to vacuum SEM detectors. (d) Plain plastic scintillating BSE detectors can operate uncoated without charging. Hence, these detectors produce the highest possible signal-to-noise-ratio at the lowest possible accelerating voltage, because the BSE do not dissipate any energy in an aluminium coating used for the vacuum SEM. As a result, specimens can be examined faster and more easily, avoiding complex and time-consuming preparation methods, without modifying the natural surface or creating artifacts by the preceding preparation work, or the vacuum of the SEM. Gas/liquid/solid interactions can be studied dynamically in situ and in real time, or recorded for post processing. Temperature variations from subzero to above 1000 ¬∞C and various ancillary devices for specimen micro- manipulation have become a new reality. Biological specimens can be maintained fresh and live. Therefore, ESEM constitutes a radical breakthrough from conventional electron microscopy, where the vacuum condition precluded the advantages of electron beam imaging becoming universal. Disadvantages The main disadvantage arises from the limitation of the distance in the specimen chamber over which the electron beam remains usable in the gaseous environment. The useful distance of the specimen from the PLA1 is a function of accelerating voltage, beam current, nature and pressure of gas, and of the aperture diameter used. This distance varies from around 10 mm to a fraction of a millimeter as the gas pressure may vary from low vacuum to one atmosphere. For optimum operation, both the manufacturer and the user must conform, in the design and operation, to satisfy this fundamental requirement. Furthermore, as the pressure can be brought to a very low level, an ESEM will revert to typical SEM operation without the above disadvantages. Therefore, one may trade-off the ESEM characteristics with those of SEM by operating in a vacuum. A reconciliation of all these disadvantages and advantages can be attained by a properly designed and operated universal ESEM. Concomitant with the limitation of useful specimen distance is the minimum magnification possible, since at very high pressure the distance becomes so small that the field of view is limited by the PLA1 size. In the very low magnification range of SEM, overlapping the upper magnification of a light microscope, the superior field is limited to a varying degree by the ESEM mode. The degree of this limitation strongly depends on instrument design. As X-rays are also generated by the surrounding gas and also come from a larger specimen area than in SEM, special algorithms are required to deduct the effects of gas on the information extracted during analysis. The presence of gas may yield unwanted effects in certain applications, but the extent of these will only become clear as further research and development is undertaken to minimize and control radiation effects. No commercial instrument is as yet (by 2009) available in conformity with all the principles of an optimal design, so that any further limitations listed are characteristic of the existing instruments and not of the ESEM technique, in general. Transmission ESEM The ESEM can also be used in transmission mode (TESEM) by appropriate detection means of the transmitted bright and dark field signals through a thin specimen section. This is done by employing solid state detectors below the specimen, or the use of the gaseous detection device (GDD). The generally low accelerating voltages used in ESEM enhance the contrast of unstained specimens while they allow nanometer resolution imaging as obtained in transmission mode especially with field emission type of electron guns. ESEM-DIA ESEM-DIA is an abbreviation standing for a system consisting of an ESEM microscope coupled to a digital image analysis (DIA) program. It directly makes possible the quantitative treatment of the digitally acquired ESEM images, and allows image recognition and image processing by machine learning based on neural network. Applications Some representative applications of ESEM are in the following areas: =Biology= An early application involved the examination of fresh and living plant material including a study of Leptospermum flavescens. The advantages of ESEM in studies of microorganisms and a comparison of preparation techniques have been demonstrated. =Medicine and medical= The influence of drugs on cancer cells has been studied with liquid-phase ESEM- STEM. =Archaeology= In conservation science, it is often necessary to preserve the specimens intact or in their natural state. =Industry= ESEM studies have been performed on fibers in the wool industry with and without particular chemical and mechanical treatments. In cement industry, it is important to examine various processes in situ in the wet and dry state. =In situ studies= Studies in situ can be performed with the aid of various ancillary devices. These have involved hot stages to observe processes at elevated temperatures, microinjectors of liquids and specimen extension or deformation devices. =General materials science= Biofilms can be studied without the artifacts introduced during SEM preparation, as well as dentin and detergents have been investigated since the early years of ESEM. Commercial ESEM The ESEM has appeared under different manufacturing brand names. The term ESEM is a generic name first publicly introduced in 1980 and afterwards unceasingly used in all publications by Danilatos and almost all users of all ESEM type instruments. The ELECTROSCAN ESEM trademark was obtained intermittently until 1999, when it was allowed to lapse. The word ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù was originally introduced in continuation to the prior (historical) use of ‚Äúenvironmental‚Äù cells in transmission microscopy, although the word ‚Äúatmospheric‚Äù has also been used to refer to an ESEM at one atmosphere pressure (ASEM) but not with any commercial instruments. Other competing manufacturers have used the terms \\"Natural SEM\\" (Hitachi), ‚ÄúWet-SEM‚Äù (ISI), ‚ÄúBio-SEM‚Äù (short-lived, AMRAY), ‚ÄúVP-SEM‚Äù (variable-pressure SEM; LEO/Zeiss-SMT), ‚ÄúLVSEM‚Äù (low-vacuum SEM, often also denoting low-voltage SEM; JEOL), all of which seem to be transient in time according to prevailing manufacturing schedules. Until recently, all these names referred to instruments operating up to about 100 Pa and with BSE detectors only. Lately, the Zeiss-SMT VP-SEM has been extended to higher pressure together with a gaseous ionization or gaseous scintillation as the SE mechanism for image formation. Therefore, it is improper to identify the term ESEM with one only brand of commercial instrument in juxtaposition to other competing commercial (or laboratory) brands with different names, as some confusion may arise from past use of trademarks. Similarly, the term GDD is generic covering the entire novel gaseous detection principle in ESEM. The terms ESD and GSED, in particular, have been used in conjunction with a commercial ESEM to denote the secondary electron mode of this detector.

Because of these indicated schedules, the reform is sometimes (erroneously) referred to as \\"3-5-8\\". The system applies to the European Higher Education Area.  European Master's Market  Through the Bologna initiatives and support of the European Union, Europe is unifying and standardising especially the structure of their masters' programmes, making them more and more accessible to foreign students. An often cited advantage of the European universities is an advantageous cost/quality ratio. In Europe, especially continental Europe, universities are heavily subsidized by their national governments. In Germany, Scandinavia or Eastern Europe for instance, most masters programmes have been traditionally totally free of charge. Recently, these governments are discussing and/or introducing tuition fees. E.g. Sweden started charging tuition for non-EU students in 2010 and Finland starts charging non-EU/EEA students in 2017. File:International tuition fees.png  Austria  In Austria, one obtains a bachelor's degree after 3 years of study and a master's degree after 2 more years of study. This is true for both the \\"research- oriented university\\" sector as well as the \\"university of applied sciences\\" sector which had been established in the 1990s. Medicine and dentistry pose an exception; these studies are not divided into bachelor's and master's degree, but take 6 years to complete and the degree obtained is called \\"Dr. med.\\" (However this is not an equivalent to other doctoral degrees, as one writes a \\"diploma thesis\\" and not a \\"doctoral thesis\\" or \\"dissertation\\".) In addition to traditional master's degrees, Austrian universities also offer the Master of Advanced Studies which is a non-consecutive continuing education degree the degree. MAS programs tend to be interdisciplinary and tend to be focused toward meeting the needs of professionals rather than academics. Before the Bologna process, the traditional Austrian equivalent to the master's degree was the Diplomstudium, leading to the title Diplom-Ingenieur (female title: Diplom-Ingenieurin)(Abbreviation: \\"Dipl.-Ing.\\" or \\"DI\\") in engineering or Magister (female: Magistra)(Abbreviation: \\"Mag.\\") in almost every discipline. The Diplomstudium took about 4‚Äì6 years of study.  Belgium  In Belgium, possessing a master's degree means that one has completed a higher education (usually university or college) programme of 4 or 5 years. Before the Bologna process most university degrees required 4 years of studies (leading to a licence), but some programmes required 5 years of study. An example in the field of education in business/management was the 5-year programme of \\"Handelsingenieur\\" (Dutch) or \\"Ing√©nieur de Gestion\\" (French) (English: \\"Commercial Engineer\\") with an important amount of mathematics and sciences, and which corresponds to an M.Sc. in Management. This degree co-existed with a graduate degree in business economics (4 years) named \\"Licentiaat in toegepaste economische wetenschappen\\" (Dutch) or \\"Licence en sciences √©conomiques appliqu√©es\\" (French) (English: \\"Licence in applied economics\\").  Denmark  In Denmark, a Master's degree is awarded. The MA and M.Sc. degrees and other master's degrees are distinguished. The MA and M.Sc. degrees are similar to a traditional Master's Programme, which are obtained by completing a higher education with a typical duration of five years on an accredited Danish university. Other master's degrees can be taken on an accredited Danish university, but these are made as adult (part-time) education such as the Master of IT (abbreviated M. IT) degree. A large number of subdivisions exist, usually designating the area of education (e.g. cand.theol., cand.arch. and cand.jur.), though some have more vague definitions (cand.mag., cand.scient., cand.polyt., and cand.scient.techn., each of which encompass broad, overlapping areas of science). The Bologna process has widely prompted master's degree education to consist of either 120 ECTS or 180 ECTS credit cycles, where one academic year corresponds to 60 ECTS-credits that are equivalent to 1,500‚Äì1,800 hours of study. In most cases, these will take 2 to 3 years respectively to complete. * 1st cycle: typically 180‚Äì240 ECTS credits, usually awarding a bachelor's degree. The European Higher Education Area did not introduce the Bachelor with Honours programme, which allows graduates with a \\"BA hons.\\" degree. * 2nd cycle: typically 90‚Äì120 ECTS credits (a minimum of 60 on 2nd-cycle level). Usually awarding a master's degree.  Finland  In Finland, the introduction of the Bologna Process has standardized most of the degrees into the European model. The master's degree takes 2‚Äì3 years (120 ECTS units) after the bachelor's degree. In English-speaking usage, the degree title is named after the particular faculty of study. In Finnish, the degree is called maisteri in most fields. When precision is needed, the term ylempi korkeakoulututkinto is used to denote all degrees of Master's level. Literally, this translates into English as higher diploma of higher education. Medicine-related fields of medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine pose an exception to Bologna system. In medical fields, the Licenciate (, ) is an equivalent degree, the completion of which takes five (dentistry) or six years (medicine and veterinary), while the Bachelor of Medicine's degree () is gained after second year of studies. In fields other than medicine, the Licentiate's degree is a post-graduate degree higher than Master's but lower than doctor's. In Engineering, the higher degree is either diplomi-insin√∂√∂ri (, literally \\"Engineer with diploma\\") or arkkitehti (, ) although in international use MSc is used. In Pharmacy, the degree is proviisori (). All such degrees retaining their historical name are classified as master's degrees (ylempi korkeakoulututkinto) and in English usage, they are always translated as master's degrees. Some other master's degrees give the right to use the traditional title of the degree-holder. Most importantly, the degree of Master of Science in Economics and Business Administration gives the right to use the title of ekonomi, while the Masters of Science in Agriculture and Forestry may use the titles of mets√§nhoitaja (Forester) or agronomi (Agronomist) depending on their field of study.  France  In France the Bologna Process has standardised most of the degrees into the three-cycle Bologna model, of which the master's degree is the second cycle. A master's degree takes 2 or 3 years (120 ECTS units) after the Licentiate. Many countries follow the French model (e.g. the Francophone regions in Switzerland, Belgium, Lebanon, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia). The following are considered master's degrees: * The master's diploma (dipl√¥me de master) is the most common master's degree. It is awarded mainly by universities, although some grandes √©coles also deliver master's diplomas. * The Engineer's degree diploma is awarded by grandes √©coles. Not all grandes √©coles programs are accredited by the State. * The Architect's degree. * Some degrees from Schools of Fine Arts. * Qualifications recognised at Level 1 (EQF Level 7) of the r√©pertoire national des certifications professionelles (national register of professional certificates). France is also host to a number of private American-style universities like The American University of Paris or Schiller International University, which offer US-accredited master's degrees in Europe. Admission into these master's programs requires a completed American undergraduate degree or an equivalent French/European degree.  Germany  Due to the EU-wide Bologna process, the traditional German academic degrees Diplom and Magister have mostly been replaced by the undergraduate Bachelor (3-4 year study programme) and postgraduate Master's degree (1-2 year study programme). In Germany the Diplom (first degree after (usually) 4‚Äì6 years - from either a Universit√§t (University), a Technische Hochschule or a Kunsthochschule with university status) and the Magister had traditionally been equivalated to the master's degree, the Magister being a degree after the study of two or three subjects (one main and one or two subsidiary subjects), as common in Humanities or Liberal Arts, whereas the Diplom is awarded after the study of one subject, commonly found in Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Formal sciences and some Applied Sciences. The Fachhochschulen or Universities of Applied Sciences conferred the Diplom (FH), whose length of study is between the bachelor's and master's degree. Under the harmonised system there is no legal academic difference between the bachelor's and master's degrees conferred by the Fachhochschulen and Universit√§ten. The German Meister qualification for a master craftsman is neither a degree nor is it comparable to the academic master's degree. It, however, qualifies the holder to study at a University or Fachhochschule, whether the Meister holds the regular entry qualification (Abitur or Fachhochschulreife) or not.  Ireland  Postgraduate master's degrees in Ireland can either be taught degrees involving lectures, examination and a short dissertation, or research degrees. They usually are one of: MA (except Trinity College Dublin, where this is an undergraduate degree awarded 21 terms after matriculation such as in MAs awarded by the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge and University of Dublin) or MA, M.Sc., MBA, MAI, ME/MEng/MEngSc, MPhil, LLM, MLitt, MArch, MAgrSc, MSocSc, MCH, MAcc, MEconSc. In most established 3rd level institutes which award post graduate qualifications (NUI, DIT) a distinction between an MA qualification and an MPhil qualification. An MA is a combination of taught (classroom) and research-based modules, whilst an MPhil is composed exclusively of research-based learning. The Magister in Arte Ingeniaria (MAI), literally meaning 'Master in the Art of Engineering', is awarded by the University of Dublin, Ireland, and is more usually referred to as Master of Engineering. While still available (via two routes), historically it was the engineering master's degree taken by the university's BAI graduates. Today the more common engineering master's degree in the University of Dublin is the M.Sc.. A Master of Business Studies (MBS) refers to a qualification in the degree of master that can be obtained by students of recognized universities and colleges who complete the relevant approved programmes of study, pass the prescribed examinations, and fulfil all other prescribed conditions. An MBS can be studied in the following areas: Electronic Business, Finance, Human Resource Management, International Business, Management Information System, Management & Organisation Studies, Management Consultancy, Marketing, Project Management, Strategic Management & Planning and can be obtained from many universities in Ireland including University College Dublin. The Pontifical University St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, offer a Masters in Theology (MTh) and Masters in Liturgical Music (MLM)Courses Maynooth College the Church of Ireland Theological Institute offers a Masters in Theology (MTh) programme.Church of Ireland Theological Institute University College Cork and Mary Immaculate College, Limerick offer a Master of Education (M.Ed), also the Mater Dei Institute now at St. Patricks Campus, Dublin City University had a Masters in Religious Education (MREd), now more commonly awarded as an MA. The other universities in Ireland usually award a MEngSc, M.E., MEng or M.Sc. for their postgraduate master's degree in engineering.  Italy  The old university system (Vecchio Ordinamento) consisted in a unique course, extended from four to five years or maximum of six (only Medicine), with a variable period (six-twelve months usually) for the thesis work. After the thesis discussion, students got the Master's Degree, simply called Laurea. This system was reformed in 1999/2000 to comply to the Bologna process directives. The new university system (Nuovo Ordinamento) includes two levels of degrees: a three-year Bachelor's degree, called Laurea di Primo Livello or just Laurea (e.g. Laurea di Primo Livello in Ingegneria Elettronica is Bachelor of Science in Electronic Engineering) and a two-year course of specialization, leading to a master's degree called Laurea di Secondo Livello, Laurea Magistrale (e.g. Laurea Specialistica in Ingegneria Elettronica is Masters of Science in Electronic Engineering). Both degrees include a thesis work with final discussion. A student can apply for the Ph.D. level course, called Dottorato di Ricerca, only after getting a Master's degree. Medicine and some other school (\\"Facolt√†\\"), notably Law, have adopted the reformed system only partially, keeping the previous unique course. Medicine is therefore still a six-year course followed, possibly, by the specialization, requiring from three to five years more. However, these Facolt√† also have other courses organized according to the new system (e.g., Tecniche di radiologia medica for Medicine, Consulente del lavoro for Law)  Netherlands  In 2002, the Dutch degree system was changed to abide by international standards. This process was complicated by the fact that the Dutch higher education system has two separate branches, Hoger Beroeps Onderwijs (HBO, which indicates College or \\"University of Professional Education\\" level), and Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs (WO, which indicates University level). HBO level education focuses more on practical and professional education while WO is academic and scientific. Before the Bachelor/Master system was introduced, HBO graduates received the title baccalaureus (with the corresponding pre-nominal abbreviation \\"bc.\\"), which was rarely used. On the other hand, the HBO graduates with an engineering degree used the degree ingenieur, with pre-nominal abbreviation \\"ing.\\", which was (and still is) used quite commonly. WO degrees consisted of several different titles, such as doctorandus (pre-nominal abbreviated to drs., corresponds to MA or MSc), ingenieur (ir. for WO level, corresponds to MSc) and meester in de rechten (mr., corresponds to LL.M.) These former titles are no longer granted (although they are still used, protected, and interchangeable with MA and MSc titles). The title of doctor (dr., corresponding to the PhD degree) is still awarded. Prior to the education reform, a single program leading to the doctorandus, ingenieur or meester degree was in effect, which comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs put together. Those who had already started the doctorandus, ingenieur or meester program could, upon completing it, opt for the old degree (before their name), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard. Since these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is in fact ‚Äì in retrospect ‚Äì incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree. In the new system, completed college (HBO) degrees are equivalent to a bachelor's degree and are abbreviated to \\"B\\" with a subject suffix. Universities (WO) grant a bachelor's degree for the general portion of the curriculum. This degree is a \\"Bachelor of Science\\" or \\"Bachelor of Arts\\" with the appropriate suffix. Before one is admitted to a Master's program, one must have obtained a bachelor's degree in the same field of study at the same level. This means that someone with a HBO Bachelor's degree can normally not start directly with a WO Master, their scientific deficiencies are bridged in a half-year or full year program after which they can continue into the WO Master program. There might also be additional requirements such as a certain higher than average GPA, sometimes it's possible to complete the bridging program parallel to the HBO Bachelor. Note that completing this program does not grant the student a WO Bachelor's degree but merely entrance to the Master and that some two year WO Masters allow HBO Bachelor's degree holders in directly. All fully completed curricula in the Netherlands are equivalent to master's degrees with the addition of a \\"of Science\\" or \\"of Arts\\" to distinguish them from HBO Master's degrees, which until 2014 were simply known as Master. After 2014 \\"of Science\\" and \\"of Arts\\" are also granted to HBO masters. WO Master's degrees focus on specialization in a sub-area of the general bachelor's degree subject and typically take 1 year except for research masters, engineering studies and medical school where the Master takes 2, 2 and 3 years, respectively. HBO Master's are usually started only after several years of work and are similarly focused on specialization. The title is signified by the abbreviation M and therefore an MBA would indicate a HBO Master's degree in business administration, but use of the MBA title is protected and it can only be granted by accredited schools.  Norway  As a result of the Bologna- process and the Quality reform, the degree system of Norwegian higher education consists of the two main levels Bachelor's degree and Master's degree. A Bachelor's degree at a Norwegian university/university college is equivalent to an undergraduate degree and takes three years (with the exception of the teaching courses, where a bachelor's degree lasts for four years). The master's degrees are either fully integrated five-year programmes (admission does not require undergraduate degree) leading up to a graduate degree, or two-year courses at graduate level which require an already completed undergraduate degree. Following the graduate level, education is given at the doctoral level, usually through a four-year research fellowship leading to a PhD. Before the implementation of this system, various titles were given in accordance with the field of study and the length of the course. For instance, a three-year undergraduate degree in engineering would give the title \\"h√∏gskoleingeni√∏r\\" (Bachelor's degree), and a 4,5 to 5 year graduate degree in engineering would give the title \\"sivilingeni√∏r\\" (Master's degree). That being said, these titles are still very common and are, although formally abolished, degrees granted earlier are still being used, also by academic personnel.  Poland  Currently there are two models of higher education in Poland. In the traditional model, a master's degree is awarded after completion of a university curriculum ‚Äî a 5-year programme in science courses at a university or other similar institution, with a project in the final year called magisterium (it can be translated as a Master of Arts or a Master of Science thesis) that often requires carrying out research in a given field. An MA degree is called a magister (abbreviated mgr) except for medical education, where it is called a lekarz (this gives the holder the right to use the title of physician and surgeon), a lekarz weterynarii in the veterinary field and a dentysta in field of dentistry. Universities of technology usually give the title of magister in≈ºynier (abbreviated mgr in≈º.) corresponding to an MSc Eng degree. More and more institutions introduce another model, which as of 2005 is still less popular. In this model, following the Bologna process directives, higher education is split into a 3 to 4-year Bachelor programme ending with a title of licencjat (non-technical) or in≈ºynier (technical fields), and a 2-year programme (uzupe≈ÇniajƒÖce studia magisterskie) giving the title of magister or magister in≈ºynier. Nevertheless, even in these institutions, it is often possible to bridge the Bachelor education directly into the Master programme, without formally obtaining the licencjat degree, thus shortening the time needed for completing the education slightly. Depending on field and school, the timing may be slightly different.  Portugal  = Prior to the Bologna Process = Prior to the full implementation of the Bologna Process in July 2007 degrees in Portugal could be divided between Bacharelato (three years), Licenciatura (five years), Mestrado (Licenciatura + 2‚Äì3 years of postgraduate studies) and doutoramento (Mestrado + 4‚Äì6 years of postgraduate studies). = After the Bologna Process = With the full implementation of the Bologna process in July 2007, a Licenciatura (3 years) with the criteria for the first cycle and a Mestrado ('Licenciatura' + 2 years) in line with the criteria for the second cycle. There are other posgraduated titles after some of these cycles.  Sweden  = Prior to the Bologna Process = Prior to the full implementation of the Bologna Process in July 2007 degrees in Sweden could be divided between kandidat (three years), magister (four years), licentiat (magister + 2‚Äì3 years of postgraduate studies) and doktor (magister + 4‚Äì5 years of postgraduate studies).  Engineering  In engineering disciplines M. Sc was called civilingenj√∂r, a four and a half year academic program concluded with a thesis. There was no direct equivalent to a B.Sc, however, a three-year engineering degree with a more practical focus called h√∂gskoleingenj√∂r was close. = After the Bologna Process = With the full implementation of the Bologna process in July 2007, a kandidat (3 years) and a master (five years) was introduced in line with the criteria for the second cycle. The magister will still exist alongside the new master, but is expected to be largely neglected in favour of the new, internationally recognized degree. The M. Sc of engineering, civilingenj√∂r, was expanded to five years and a new B. Sc was introduced to coexist with the unaltered h√∂gskoleingenj√∂r  United Kingdom  = Integrated Master's degrees = In the UK, many universities now have four-year integrated master's programmes (five years in Scotland) mainly in STEM subjects, often with a research project or Dissertation in the final year. An integrated master's degree typically includes a year of study at master's level, along with three years (four in Scotland) at bachelor's level. The awards for these may be named after the subject, so a course in mathematics would earn a Master in Mathematics degree, (abbreviated to MMath), or have a general title such as MSci (Master in Science at most universities but Master of Natural Sciences at Cambridge) or MLibArts (Master of Liberal Arts). Examples include MChem, MPharm, MEng, MMath, MPhys. Integrated master's degrees are considered qualification at master's level and are second-cycle qualification on the qualifications framework for the European higher education area established under the Bologna Process. = Postgraduate Master's degrees = Postgraduate master's degrees in the United Kingdom can either be taught degrees involving lectures, examination and a short dissertation, or research degrees (normally MPhil, MLitt or MRes programmes). Taught Master's programmes involve 1 or 2 years of full-time study. The programmes are often very intensive and demanding, and concentrate on one very specialised area of knowledge. Some universities also offer a Master's by Learning Contract scheme, where a candidate can specify his or her own learning objectives; these are submitted to supervising academics for approval, and are assessed by means of written reports, practical demonstrations and presentations.  Taught postgraduate Master's degrees  (MSc, MA, MSt, LL.M., MLitt, MSSc, MEnt etc.) The most common types of postgraduate taught master's degrees are the Master of Arts (MA) awarded in Arts, Humanities, Theology and Social Sciences and the Master of Science (MSc) awarded in pure and applied Science. A number of taught programs in Social Sciences also receive the Master of Science (MSc) degree (e.g. MSc Development Studies at the London School of Economics and University of Bath). However, some universities - particularly those in Scotland - award the Master of Letters (MLitt) to students in the Arts, Humanities, Divinity and Social Sciences, often with the suffix (T) to indicate it is a taught degree, to avoid confusion with the MLitt offered as a research degree. In the University of Oxford, on the other hand, the MPhil (which is elsewhere reserved for research degrees) is a taught master's degree (normally also including a short research component) and the MSc can be either taught or by research.; the MLitt is also offered as a research degree in the humanities. Some other universities, such as the University of Glasgow, previously used the designation MPhil for both taught and research master's degrees, but have recently changed the taught appellation to MLitt. In the University of Cambridge, the main taught master's degree is the MSt (Master of Studies). In Business Schools a special Masters of Business Administration MBA type of a degree is available to those who have business practice experience. For example, Salford Business School in Greater Manchester offers a degree which is only available to those who can show professional experience. In Law the standard taught degree is the Master of Laws, but certain courses may lead to the award of MA or MLitt. Until recently, both the undergraduate and postgraduate master's degrees were awarded without grade or class (like the class of an honours degree). Nowadays however, Master's degrees may be classified into a maximum of four categories (Distinction, Merit, Pass or Fail), while others can have a more simplified form of assessment by only distinguishing between a Pass or a Fail.  Research postgraduate Master's degrees  The Master of Philosophy (MPhil) is a research degree awarded for the completion of a thesis, with the title being reserved for \\"extended master's courses that typically involve a substantial element of research or equivalent enquiry\\". It is a shorter version of the PhD and some universities routinely enter potential PhD students into the MPhil programme and allow them to upgrade to the full PhD programme a year or two into the course. Advanced candidates for a taught postgraduate Master's sometimes undertake the MPhil as it is considered a more prestigious degree, but it may also mean that the student could not afford or could not complete the full PhD. A student who fails to reach the standard required for a PhD may only be awarded an MPhil if they have successfully reached the standard for a master's degree. The Master of Research (MRes) degree is a more structured and organised version of the MPhil, usually designed to prepare a student for a career in research. For example, an MRes may combine individual research with periods of work placement in research establishments. The Master of Letters (MLitt) degree is a two-year research degree at many universities, including Cambridge and the ancient Scottish universities, and is generally awarded when a student cannot or will not complete the final year(s) of their PhD and so writes their research up for the MLitt. Because MLitt is also used for a taught degree, the suffix (T) or (R) for taught or research is often added, so the more prestigious two-year research degree is called MLitt (R). Like the PhD, the MPhil and MRes degrees are generally awarded without class or grade as a pass (the standard grade) or can, rarely, be awarded with a distinction. = Non- master's level qualifications =  MAs in Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin  The universities of Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin award master's degrees to BAs without further examination, where seven years after matriculation have passed, and (in some but not all cases) upon payment of a nominal fee. It is commonplace for recipients of the degree to have graduated several years previously and to have had little official contact with the university or academic life since then. The only real significance of these degrees is that they historically conferred voting rights in University elections, it was seen as the point at which one became eligible to teach at the University and certain other privileges e.g. the right to dine at the holder's college's high table. They still do confer some restricted and rarely used voting rights. The MAs awarded by Oxford and Cambridge are colloquially known as the Oxbridge MA, and that from Dublin as the Trinity MA, and would be usually distinguished respectively: MA (Oxon), MA (Cantab) and MA (Dubl), \\"Oxon\\" here being an abbreviation for Oxoniensis (of Oxford), \\"Cantab\\" for Cantabrigiensis (of Cambridge) and, \\"Dubl\\" for Dubliniensis (of Dublin). The Universities of Cambridge and Dublin also offer an MA to certain senior staff - both academic and non-academic - after a number of years' employment with the university. The MAs awarded by Oxford and Cambridge are not considered academic qualifications. Until the advent of the modern research university in the mid 19th century, several other British and American universities also gave such degrees \\"in course\\".  Scottish MA  In Scotland the first degree in Arts, Fine Art, Humanities and Social Sciences awarded by the ancient universities of Scotland is the Master of Arts. The Science and Law faculties of Scottish universities award the BSc and LLB degrees respectively and the New Universities generally award the BA. Scottish undergraduate honours courses (including the MA as well as the BA, BSc and LLB) are four years in length rather than the three years that is usual in the rest of the UK; three- year undergraduate degrees are available in Scotland but lead to non-honours degrees. The Scottish MA with honours is a qualification at the level of a bachelor's degree with honours, and the Scottish MA without honours is a qualification at the level of a non-honours bachelor's degree.  Other approaches  As indicated above, even though higher education systems in Europe try to comply with the Bologna process, the process is not yet fully accomplished. Differences in methodology and curricula are still widely different in some cases. To mitigate this, several initiatives and approaches are currently tried, some of them with the support of the European Union institutions. Either in partnership or as private consortia, networks of universities in different countries are trying to work out shared curricula and adopt similar methodologies. In niche educational areas like translation and interpreting this has proved successful and the networks have become functional, i.e. European Master's in Translation and the European Master's in Conference Interpreting. While these are not mainstream developments in these networks of universities, a similar master's degree certificate is offered for a given field, and the network/consortium collectively guarantees that these degrees have a high level of convergence.

By 1973 he was collaborating with Avital Geva, Moshe Gershuni, Matthew Greenberg and Michael Druks exhibiting at the Romi Goldmuntz Centre, Antwerp. He printed for many artists including Ian McKeever and Genesis P'Orridge with Cosey Fanni Tutti making posters for the infamous Prostitution show at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London in 1976, as well as conceiving and creating photo-events with Genesis and Cosey as performers and models. He has since continued to use photography, film and music in his work. He has worked with a large number of Australian artists at Port Jackson Press publishing in Melbourne. During the eighties, while he was a committee member, and later when he was president of the Print Council of Australia, Meyer curated travelling exhibitions including the controversial Print as Object. He also created Gapscape, an exhibition of his prints and drawings which toured twenty-four regional Australian galleries. In 1995 he participated in The Wandering Jew. Myth and Metaphor, curated and toured for the Jewish Museum of Australia, an organisation with which he has collaborated in numerous other curated and solo projects. Recent work includes the 105 metre charcoal on paper installation, A Special Place - HaMakom, and experiments with Lamda photographic digital prints.

Standing, from left to right, Sir Archibald Sinclair, Mr A. V. Alexander, Lord Cranborne, Herbert Morrison, Lord Moyne, David Margesson and Brendan Bracken. Seated, from left to right, Ernest Bevin, Lord Beaverbrook, Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, Sir John Anderson, Arthur Greenwood and Sir Kingsley Wood. The Gen 75 Committee was a committee of the British cabinet, convened by the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, on 10 August 1945. It was one of many ad hoc cabinet committees, each of which was convened to handle a single issue, and given a prefix of Gen (for general) and a number. The purpose of the Gen 75 committee was to discuss and establish the British government's nuclear policy. Attlee dubbed it the \\"Atom Bomb Committee\\". It was replaced by an official ministerial committee, the Atomic Energy Committee, in February 1947. Matters considered by the Gen 75 Committee included decisions on what production facilities should be built to produce nuclear weapons, authorising the construction of nuclear reactors to produce plutonium at Windscale, and a gaseous diffusion plant to produce uranium-235 at Capenhurst. It took decisions on the administrative structures that would oversee production, and appointed Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff, to run the project, which became High Explosive Research. The final decision to proceed with building nuclear weapons, however, was made by another Gen committee, the Gen 163 Committee. Background During the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys. A directorate of that name coordinated this effort. Sir John Anderson, the Lord President of the Council, was the minister responsible, and Wallace Akers from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) was appointed the director. At the Quadrant Conference in August 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project to create a combined British, American and Canadian project. The British considered the Quebec Agreement to be the best deal they could have struck under the circumstances, and the restrictions were the price they had to pay to obtain the technical information needed for a successful post-war nuclear weapons project. Margaret Gowing noted that the \\"idea of the independent deterrent was already well entrenched.\\" Many of Britain's top scientists participated in the British contribution to the Manhattan Project. A British mission led by Akers assisted in the development of gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, led by Mark Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the electromagnetic separation process. John Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. The British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Rudolf Peierls, included distinguished scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Otto Frisch, Ernest Titterton and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a spy for the Soviet Union. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted. Origin The Government of the United Kingdom is directed by the cabinet, a group of senior government ministers led by the Prime Minister. Most of the day-to-day work of the cabinet is carried out by cabinet committees, rather than by the full cabinet. Each committee has its own area of responsibility, and their decisions are binding on the entire cabinet. Their membership and scope is determined by the Prime Minister. During the post-Second World War period, in addition to standing committees, there were ad hoc committees that were convened to handle a single issue. These were normally short-lived. Each was given a prefix of Gen and a number. Gen 183, for example, was the Committee on Subversive Activities. Between 1945 and 1964, Gen (for general) committees were sequentially numbered from 1 to 881 in order of formation. Prime Minister Clement Attlee, who succeeded Churchill in June 1945, created the Gen 75 Committee on 10 August 1945 to examine the feasibility of a nuclear weapons programme. It was known informally by Attlee as the \\"Atomic Bomb Committee\\", although no explicit decision to build one was made until January 1947. The Gen 75 Committee differed from other Gen committees in that its deliberations were not reported to the full cabinet, and were shrouded in secrecy even at that level. The entire subject of nuclear weapons was kept off the full cabinet agenda, and cabinet ministers not attending the meetings may not have even known of its existence. Composition Membership of Gen 75 initially consisted of five ministers: the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee; the Lord President of the Council, Herbert Morrison; the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin; and the President of the Board of Trade, Stafford Cripps. It was soon expanded with the addition of the Lord Privy Seal, Arthur Greenwood, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Hugh Dalton. After the Gen 75 Committee decided that the nuclear weapons project should be the responsibility of the Ministry of Supply, the Minister of Supply, John Wilmot, was added. Activity =International relations= As reports came in of the devastation caused by the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Attlee considered how nuclear weapons had changed the nature of warfare and international relations. He raised the matter with the Gen 75 Committee, and Bevin suggested that a first step should be a letter to Truman suggesting a review of policy. The letter was sent to Truman on 20 September 1945. A response was slow in coming; Truman was concerned about the effect that Anglo-American and Canadian talks might have on the Soviet Union. At Attlee's insistence, talks were scheduled for 9 November 1945. The Gen 75 Committee meeting discussed what should be said at the meeting, in particular what British policy towards the Soviet Union should be. Bevin took a conciliatory line at the Gen 75 Committee meeting on 11 October 1945, only to take a harder one at the meeting a week later. Unusually, the matter was placed before the full cabinet. Hopes were expressed that Britain might be able to broker a deal that would head off a schism between the United States and the Soviet Union. Ultimately, though, it endorsed Attlee's preference that practical knowledge of nuclear weapons design not be shared with the Soviet Union. =Research establishment= During the war, Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant, Peierls, Harrie Massey and Herbert Skinner had met in Washington, DC, in November 1944, and drawn up a proposal for a British atomic energy research establishment, which they had calculated would cost around ¬£1.5 million. The Tube Alloys Committee endorsed their recommendation in April 1945, and Anderson, in his capacity as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy, submitted the memorandum advocating it to the Gen 75 Committee. It endorsed the creation of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in September, Attlee announced the decision in the House of Commons on 29 October 1945. =Organisation of production= In October 1945, the Gen 75 Committee considered the issue of ministerial responsibility for atomic energy. The Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges, and the Advisory Committee on Atomic Energy both recommended that it be placed within the Ministry of Supply. Developing atomic energy would require an enormous construction effort, which the Ministry of Supply was best equipped to undertake. The Tube Alloys Directorate was transferred from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to the Ministry of Supply effective 1 November 1945. To coordinate the atomic energy effort, the Gen 75 Committee decided to appoint a Controller of Production, Atomic Energy (CPAE). Wilmot suggested Marshal of the Royal Air Force Lord Portal, the wartime Chief of the Air Staff. Portal was reluctant to accept the post, as he felt that he lacked administrative experience outside the Royal Air Force, but eventually accepted it for a two-year term, commencing in March 1946. In this role he had direct access to the Prime Minister. Portal ran the project until 1951, when he was succeeded by Sir Frederick Morgan. It was hidden under the cover name High Explosive Research. =Nuclear reactors= An early debate among the scientists was whether the fissile material for an atomic bomb should be uranium-235 or plutonium. Tube Alloys had performed much of the pioneering research on gaseous diffusion for uranium enrichment, and Oliphant's team in Berkeley were well-acquainted with the electromagnetic process. The staff that had remained in Britain strongly favoured uranium-235; but the scientists that had worked in the United States argued for plutonium on the basis of its greater efficiency as an explosive, despite the fact that they had neither the expertise in the design of nuclear reactors to produce it, nor the requisite knowledge of plutonium chemistry or metallurgy to extract it. However, the Montreal Laboratory had designed and was building pilot reactors, and had carried out some work on separating plutonium from uranium. The Manhattan Project had pursued both avenues, and the scientists who had worked at Los Alamos were aware of work there with composite cores that used both; but there were concerns that Britain might not have the money, resources or skilled manpower for this. In the end, it came down to economics; a reactor could be built more cheaply than a separation plant that produced an equivalent quantity of enriched uranium, and made more efficient use of uranium fuel. A reactor and separation plant capable of producing enough plutonium for fifteen bombs per year was costed at around ¬£20 million. It fell to the Gen 75 Committee to decide how many reactors should be built at its meeting on 18 December 1945. Considering the demands that reactors would make on scarce skilled labour and materials, the Gen 75 Committee decided to defer a decision on building a second reactor, but to proceed with the first one \\"with the highest urgency and importance\\". Reactors were built at the former ROF Sellafield. To avoid any confusion with Springfields, where uranium metal was produced, the name was changed to Windscale. =Gaseous diffusion facility= A few months later, Portal, who had not been appointed when this decision was taken, began to have doubts. Word reached him of problems with the Hanford Site reactors, which had been all but completely shut down due to Wigner's disease. On a visit to the United States in May 1946, Groves advised Portal not to build a reactor. By this time, there was interest from the scientists in making better use of uranium fuel by re-enrichment of spent fuel rods. A gaseous diffusion plant was costed at somewhere between ¬£30 and ¬£40 million. The Gen 75 Committee considered the proposal in October 1946. Michael Perrin, who was present, later recalled that: The Gen 75 Committee thereupon approved the construction of the proposed gaseous diffusion plant, which was built on the site of an old Royal Ordnance Factory at Capenhurst, near Chester. Gen 163 Committee In July 1946, the Chiefs of Staff Committee considered the issue of nuclear weapons, and recommended that Britain acquire them. This recommendation was accepted by the Cabinet Defence Committee on 22 July 1946. The Chief of the Air Staff, Lord Tedder, officially requested an atomic bomb on 9 August 1946. The Chiefs of Staff estimated that 200 bombs would be required by 1957. Despite this, and the research and construction of facilities that had already been approved, there was still no official decision to proceed with making atomic bombs. Dissent came from Patrick Blackett, who submitted a paper to the Gen 75 Committee that forcefully argued against Britain acquiring atomic bombs. The Foreign Office, however, labelled his ideas \\"dangerous and misleading rubbish\\", and rejected a characterisation of the Soviet Union as a peace- loving state with no expansionist ambitions whereas the United States was an aggressor predisposed towards preemptive war. Portal submitted his proposal to proceed with the manufacture of nuclear weapons at the 8 January 1947 meeting of the Gen 163 Committee. This was a smaller committee, consisting of Attlee, Morrison, Bevin, Wilmot, the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Lord Addison, and the Minister of Defence, A. V. Alexander. It was this committee, which met only once, that agreed to proceed with the development of atomic bombs. Once again, Bevin was a strong supporter, arguing that \\"We could not afford to acquiesce in an American monopoly of this new development.\\" It also endorsed Portal's proposal to place Penney in charge of the bomb development effort, although Penney was not informed of this decision until May. Abolishment With the decision taken to proceed with nuclear weapons development, the Gen 75 Committee was replaced in February 1947 by a standing committee, the Atomic Energy Committee \\"to deal with questions of policy in the field of atomic energy which require the consideration of Ministers\\". Its membership was that of the Gen 75 Committee, plus Alexander and Addison. However, the Atomic Energy Committee only met five times in 1947, twice in 1948, four times in 1949, twice in 1950 and just once in 1951. Important decisions therefore continued to be made by Gen committees.

Biography Jackson was born in the Waterhouse district of Kingston, Jamaica in 1946. One of seven children, Jackson left home at the age of twelve to find work at a furnace in Waterhouse. At seventeen, the effects of malnutrition had left him hospitalized, and on his release he was left with severe arthritis which had partially crippled his legs.Campbell, Howard (2012) \\"Yabby You: Jesus Dread\\", Jamaica Observer, 8 June 2012. Retrieved 8 June 2012 His physical condition meant that he was unable to return to his previous work, and he was forced into hustling a living on the streets of Kingston. His beliefs were markedly different from that of his Rastafarian contemporaries, believing in the divinity of Jesus rather than Haile Selassie I, earning him the nickname 'Jesus Dread'; This often prompted debate on religio- philosophical matters, and it was after one of these discussions that Jackson first headed towards a recording studio, having heard music \\"like a strange ting, inside a my thoughts ‚Äì like an angel a sing\\". Another spell in hospital meant that finding money for recording was difficult, but eventually the \\"Conquering Lion\\" single was released late in 1972, credited to 'Vivian Jackson and the Ralph Brothers'. Cut for King Tubby, the popularity of the song and its distinctive introduction (the chant of \\"Be-you, yabby-yabby-you\\") earned Jackson the nickname \\"Yabby You\\", which has remained with him during his entire career. The next few months saw the recording of several more singles, released under different names on various record labels, (although usually credited to 'Vivian Jackson and the Prophets', and often featuring a King Tubby 'version' on the b-side); culminating in the release of the Conquering Lion album. A King Tubby mixed dub set, King Tubby's Prophesy of Dub, was also issued, albeit on a limited run of 500 copies, helping to establish Jackson as a roots artist. Yabby's success allowed him to branch out as a producer, and he began working with both upcoming and more established artists including Wayne Wade, Michael Rose, Tommy McCook, Michael Prophet, Big Youth, Trinity, Dillinger and Tapper Zukie, while continuing to release his own material. Jackson continued to record, produce and perform (often with the aid of crutches) until the mid-1980s. He re-emerged in the early 1990s, issuing both new and old material, and his recordings have been the subject of several high quality reissues in recent years. In 2000 he released a singles remix project with Glen Brown. The album included remixes of \\"Conquering Lion\\" by Smith and Mighty, and a remix of Glen Brown by Small Axe and Terminal Head. Shanachie Records released a 3-CD box set in 2014. Shanachie Records chief Randall Grass explained in an interview with the website Midnight Raver: On 14 August 2014, Shanachie Records announced their plans to release a Willi Williams/Yabby You project titled \\"Unification: From Channel One To King Tubbys With Willi Williams And Yabby You,\\" which includes tracks recorded in the late seventies and never released.

Laid down on 6 March 1940 as SS Sea Panther, a Maritime Commission type (C3 Cargo) hull under Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 40) by the Federal Shipbuilding & Drydock Company of Kearney, New Jersey. Launched in May 1940 she was delivered to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company of New Orleans and renamed Doctor Lykes. After two trips to the Orient she was acquired by the United States Navy and commissioned as a cargo ship, USS Hamul (AK-30), on 14 June 1941 at Charleston, South Carolina, Commander F. M. Tillson in command. Service history =Cargo ship, 1941-1942= In July 1941, Hamul rendered logistical support for the occupation of Iceland, prior to America's involvement in World War II. After working with General Electric in experiments on night camouflage, Hamul departed Boston in January, 1942 to head a convoy of five ships with men and material to establish a base at Bora Bora, Society Islands. This mission completed, the cargo ship returned to the States via Chile, while she loaded 10,000 tons of nitrate. Hamul discharged the valuable cargo at Mobile, Alabama and remained there for conversion to a destroyer tender. =Destroyer tender= 1943-1946 Departing Mobile 7 January 1943 redesignated as AD-20, Hamul tended destroyers and other ships in Casco Bay, Maine until April and then sailed south to serve as flagship of the Destroyer-Escort Shakedown Task Group in Bermuda. In the following 19 months she tended some 348 DD's as well as removing demolition charges from . This German submarine was the first capture of a regular enemy warship on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815. After overhaul at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Hamul sailed for the Pacific 1 January 1945 reaching Saipan 12 February via the Panama Canal, Pearl Harbor, and Eniwetok. She remained there preparing amphibious craft for the massive Iwo Jima invasion until 27 March, when she sailed to Ulithi. At Ulithi Hamul kept busy repairing damaged craft returning from the Okinawa campaign until 6 May, when she sailed for the scene of the Pacific war's last major struggle. Hamul reached Okinawa on 10 May 1945 and remained there until February, 1946 to repair battle-damaged ships. With over 400 homeward bound veterans aboard, she departed Okinawa 10 February 1946. After discharging them at San Diego she proceeded to Jacksonville, Florida and subsequently Orange, Texas to prepare for decommissioning. 1946-1962 As Hamul entered the final stages of the decommissioning process, she was called back into active service as station ship at Plymouth, England. Reaching the British port on 17 April 1947, Hamul remained there for three years tending various American ships and making quarterly cruises to Atlantic and Mediterranean ports. Again ordered to decommission, Hamul departed Plymouth on 17 July 1950, but the outbreak of war in Korea again called for every available ship. Going west via Norfolk, Hamul reached Sasebo, Japan on 23 October and began servicing the fleet operating off the Korean coast. From that period on Hamuls career fell into a pattern of six months duty in the East, which took her to the Philippines, Hong Kong, Formosa, and other Asian ports and islands, alternating with a similar period of time in her home port, Long Beach. During the active fighting in Korea and the Cold War afterwards, she played a vital role in maintaining America's mobile presence in the Pacific. Hamul (AD-20) decommissioned on 9 June 1962 at Long Beach. Returned to the Maritime Administration, she was placed in the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay in Benicia, California. Hamul earned one battle star for World War II service and one battle star for Korean War service.

Washington Arts Centre is also located in Fatfield. The southern part of the village by the River Wear is popular for country walks and the three public houses and working men's club that are situated on the banks of the river. The site of the original village is just to the west of the North Biddick Club. A school was originally built on the site of the old village, but was replaced by private housing several years ago. Mine disaster In 1814 the Hall Pit in Fatfield exploded with the loss of 32 lives. At 12:30 on Tuesday 28 September a fall of stone from the roof drove firedamp into contact with candles used by the miners for illumination. All the men below ground were killed, as was one of the four men in the shaft at the time. Contemporary reports refer to the survivors being affected by the afterdamp. Although the colliery was claimed (by, for instance, the colliery overman) to be safe and well worked, there had been three previous explosions of firedamp which had each killed three men.

He became the eighteenth president of Indiana University on July 1, 2007. On August 14, 2020, McRobbie announced that he plans to retire at the end of June 2021 after 14 years as the head of the university and that a search committee is being formed to find his replacement. Early life and education Michael Alexander McRobbie was born on October 11, 1950, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, and grew up in Gold Coast, Queensland. He graduated with a BSc with First Class Honours from the University of Queensland in 1974, and with a PhD from the Australian National University in 1979. His early work was in philosophy, artificial intelligence and automated theorem proving. Career McRobbie with U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in 2007 McRobbie at the Southwest Central Indiana Region Grant Announcement in 2016 After a postdoctoral fellowship in philosophy, he founded an automated reasoning project, the ANU Centre for Information Science Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Advanced Computational Systems. McRobbie was a 1988 Fulbright Scholar in Computer Science from The Australian National University to the Argonne National Laboratory. From 1990 through 1996 he was a professor at the Australian National University. He had a growing interest in international research collaborations. In 1996 he and Kilnam Chon proposed what became Asia Pacific Advanced Network at a symposium held at Tsukuba, Japan. In 1997 he became the vice president for information technology at Indiana University. The network operations center for the Abilene Network was established at IU under his direction, and the Pervasive Technology Laboratories were established with a $29.9 million grant from the Lilly Endowment in 1999. McRobbie was principal investigator of a project sponsored by the US National Science Foundation to connect US and Asian national research and education networks called TransPAC. The state-funded $5.3 million I-Light project connected all campuses of the IU system with fiber optic communications (further expanded in 2010). In 2003 he became the vice president for research of IU. In 2005, the TransPAC2 project was funded as a follow-on to TransPAC. He was chairman of the steering committee for the Indiana Metabolomics and Cytomics Initiative (METACyt), which was the largest outside funded project in the history of Indiana University Bloomington. McRobbie served as interim provost and vice president of academic affairs of the Bloomington campus in 2006. He increased external funding by securing millions of dollars in grants for life science initiatives. On a July 2006 trip through China he established a cooperative research program with Tsinghua University in Beijing. By September 2006, the then president of Indiana University, Adam Herbert, announced he wanted to leave office before July 2008. On March 1, 2007 McRobbie was selected as IU's 18th president and took office on July 1, 2007. He served on the board of directors for ChaCha (the Indiana-based search engine). Some press were critical of a deal that used IU library staff as \\"guides\\", although McRobbie resigned from the board before becoming president of the University. McRobbie has served on the board of trustees for Internet2 since 2009, and was named chair of the board starting in 2012. In 2012 he announced a new supercomputer called Big Red II at IU. Although other universities operate larger computers, by some measures this Cray XK7 was expected to be the largest for use by a single US university and not a consortium or national resource. The original Big Red computer was installed in 2006. Personal life While still an undergraduate at the University of Queensland, McRobbie married Brisbane native Andrea Gibson in 1973. They had three children together. She died from brain cancer in 2003. A fellowship was named in her memory. McRobbie has three children and three stepchildren. His second wife, Laurie Burns McRobbie, was born in Michigan and worked as a technologist for 20 years. Both of them had been widowed before they married in 2005. Laurie McRobbie was the executive director of member and partner relations for Internet2, and an adjunct faculty member in IU's School of Informatics. After living in Indiana for 13 years, McRobbie became a US citizen in October 2010 while still retaining his original Australian citizenship. Honors and awards McRobbie was made a Sagamore of the Wabash, the highest honor the state can bestow, in 2007 by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels. That same year he received an honorary degree from the University of Queensland. In 2008 he received an honorary degree from Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, and one from the Australian National University in 2010. Also in 2010 he was named an officer of the Order of Australia.

Thouron, K.B.E., and Esther du Pont Thouron. It was created to strengthen the \\"special relationship\\" between the United States and the United Kingdom through educational exchange between British universities and the University of Pennsylvania. Through the programme the Thourons sought to nourish and develop Anglo-American friendship by ensuring that, in the years to come, a growing number of the leading citizens of these two countries would have a thorough understanding of their trans-Atlantic neighbours. In the years since its founding, the Thouron Award has sponsored programs of graduate study for more than 650 fellows, known as Thouron Scholars. Graduates of British universities receive support for up to two years of study ‚Äì in any degree course ‚Äì at the University of Pennsylvania, and Penn graduates may study at any university in the U.K. with up to two years of support. The Award, among the most generous exchange fellowships in the world, pays tuition and a stipend that covers room, board, and such extras as entertainment and travel. The Exchange Programme was set up to bring young people of exceptional ability from each country into contact with the ideas and peoples of the other country. The experience of sharing different ways of life, of studying in a new academic and cultural environment, and of confronting viewpoints and assumptions that have long and varied pasts, fosters personal enrichment and maturity and contributes to deeper understanding of the people and the traditions of each country. The founders of the Award believed that recipients of the Award should be chosen as much for their personal abilities and leadership potential as for their scholastic ability. Accordingly, Thouron Scholars are chosen on the basis of their \\"ambassadorial qualities\\" as well as their ability to succeed in their chosen academic programs. A primary goal in selection is find individuals who are deemed ready to represent their home country while being open to the different perspectives of the country in which they conduct their academic program. One aspect of the Thouron Award which somewhat differentiates it from other fellowships is the close involvement of a specific family - the Thouron family, beginning with Sir John R.H. Thouron, continuing through his son Tiger and now his grandson Rupert. The family has welcomed every Thouron Scholar into what they deem to be their \\"extended family\\" by inviting them into their homes, entertaining them, and maintaining long-term contact with them. This extended family, due to the diverse geographical spread of its constituents, is very much a global entity. History of the Award In the autumn of 1960, three British students, a geologist, an economist and a landscape architect, began their courses of study at the University of Pennsylvania as the first Thouron Fellows. In 1961, two graduates of the University of Pennsylvania arrived in the United Kingdom, an economist to the London School of Economics and a classicist to Balliol College, Oxford, as the first Fellows from the United States. Since that time over 500 Fellows have been selected. Thouron Fellows have pursued degrees in a wide variety of fields. British Fellows have studied in all of the graduate and professional schools of the University of Pennsylvania. American Fellows have attended some 53 British educational institutions, with Cambridge, Oxford and the University of London attracting the majority of the Penn students. In the 50 years of its existence, the Thouron Award has played an influential role in the lives and careers of its alumni. As new Thouron Fellows cross the Atlantic each year to take up or continue their studies, it seems that the program of cooperation is growing and strengthening. Thouron Prize The Thouron family has also established a Thouron Prize for Summer Study at Pembroke College in the University of Cambridge for undergraduate students. The award is granted to eight or nine rising juniors and seniors from Harvard, Yale, and Penn, with typically three students selected from each university. The students receive a full scholarship to travel and spend two months studying at the University of Cambridge in the Pembroke-King's Programme. The Thouron Prize covers the full cost of the program. In addition, recipients are given a seminar series from Sir Roger Tomkys, a former Master of Pembroke College. Competition for the prizes is often fierce, and the universities typically have their own mechanism for initial nomination. Nominees are then passed onto the consideration of members of the Thouron family, who personally hold interviews with all the nominees before coming to a final decision. The Thouron Prize is sometimes seen as the sophomore/junior analog of the Rhodes or Marshall Scholarships; however, the latter can only be applied to during one's senior year and typically cover two years of graduate study rather than one undergraduate summer. Similar to the goals of the other British fellowships, the Thouron Prize endeavors to give undergraduates \\"an understanding of both shared and differing aspects of British and American culture.\\" At least one student who won the undergraduate Thouron Prize later went on to win the graduate Thouron Award as well. At least two Thouron Prize winners have also gone on to win the Rhodes Scholarship.

In 1863 Semen Hulak-Artemovsky wrote his libretto Zaporozhets za Dunayem in Saint Petersburg to commemorate the exodus of Zaporizhian Cossacks to the Danube, an area of Silistra Eyalet. The Cossacks were protecting the Metropolitan bishop of Braila who serviced the area of Budjak and Yedisan (Ottoman Ukraine) and was titled as Metropolitan bishop of all Ukraine.[Mitropolitul Proilaviei, al Tomarovei, al Hotinului, al tuturor marginilor DunƒÉrii »ôi ale Nistrului »ôi al √Æntregii Ucraine a hanului]; Iustin S.

End of Zaporozhia By the late 18th century, the combat ability of Zaporozhia was greatly reduced, especially after the Treaty of K√º√ß√ºk Kaynarca and the Russian annexation of Crimea, when the need for the Host to guard the borders was removed. At the same time, the Zaporozhian's other enemy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was also weakened and on the verge of being partitioned. This meant that militarily the Zaporozhian Sich was becoming increasingly superfluous, but at the same time their existence caused friction with Imperial Russian authorities who wanted to colonise the newly acquired lands that the Cossacks inhabited. After a number of Cossack attacks on Serbian colonies and with Cossack support offered to Yemelyan Pugachev, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great issued an order to General Pyotr Tekeli to end the troublesome Sich. Tekeli's operation, carried out in June 1775, was bloodless. The Zaporozhian Sich was surrounded with infantry and artillery and an ultimatum was given to the Kosh otaman Petro Kalnyshevsky to destroy the Sich and to have Zaporozhian knights transfer to the family life. The Cossacks did not resist so that no Russian blood would be spilt. But later Zaporozhian Cossack Grigory Potemkin, and apparently without Kalnyshevky's knowledge, reached an agreement to allow a group of 50 Cossacks under the guidance of a starshyna Lyakh to go fishing in the river Ingul next to the Southern Buh in Ottoman territory and to issue 50 passports. The pretext was enough to allow the Russians to let the Cossacks, as 50 passports allowed five thousand Cossacks to leave Taras Chukhlib Alexander Suvorov in Ukrainian history, Pravda.org.ua Retrieved on 21 April (approximately 30% of the Zaporozhian Cossacks). As long as Potemkin could be guilty, so starshyna, including Kalnyshevsky, was arrested for this. These Cossacks were joined by numerous Ukrainian peasants fleeing from Russian Serfdom and lived on the left bank of the Danube river (Budjak) then part of the Ottoman Empire, who allowed them to settle there. By 1778 they numbered 12 thousand men, and the Turkish Sultan decided that they would have much more use as a Cossack Host, and allocated them the land of Kuchungary (modern Transnistria) in the lower Dniester where they swore loyalty to the Ottoman Empire. However the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War divided the Cossacks. Some returned to Russia and joined the new Host of Loyal Zaporozhians (later the Black Sea Cossack Host) formed out of the Cossacks who chose to remain in Russia in 1775. After the Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì12), Bessarabia became part of Russia, and the Danubian Cossacks lost their allocated land. Rivalry with Nekrasovites Following Turkey's defeat, some Cossacks retreated with the Turkish Army across the Danube River, where the Sultan allowed them to build a Sich in the settlement of Katerlez in the Danube Delta right next to existing settlements of Nekrasov Cossacks and Lipovans. There was increasing friction between the two groups over land and fishing rights. In 1794, the Nekrasovites attacked and destroyed Katerlez. Afterwards the Turkish authorities re-located the Danubian Zaporozhians further up the Danube on the Brailov Island. The new location was much poorer for fishing and resulted in a group of 500 Cossacks, led by Kosh Pomelo to return to Russia. In 1800 the Balkan Peninsula erupted in uprisings led by Osman Pazvantoƒülu who rebelled against the new Turkish Sultan Selim III. In order to gain support, Pazvantoƒülu promised the Nekrasovites all the land on the lower Danube. Seeing an opportunity to settle the score with their rivals, the Danubian Zaporozhians sided with the Sultan. The resulting Civil War saw severe losses in both Cossack groups. In the end the rebellion was put down, the Zaprozhians where rewarded by the Brailov Nazir, who allowed then to return to Katerlez in 1803. However the Nekrasovites found their own protector, the commandant of Izmail Pekhlevanoƒülu. With his aid, they attacked the Sich once again in 1805 and sacked it. The surviving Zaporozhians fled to Brailov (modern BrƒÉila, Romania). The new Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812) caused further division among the Danubian Cossacks. After Russia overran the Danube, the Kosh Otaman Trofim Gaibadura and Ivan Guba offered their allegiance to Russia. They were permitted to settle in the Budjak region and by order of Alexander I and on 20 January 1807 formed the Lower-Danube Budjak Host (–£—Å—Ç—å-–î—É–Ω–∞–π—Å–∫–æ–µ –ë—É–¥–∂–∞—Ü–∫–æ–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ). The new host lasted only five months, during which many neighbouring Ukrainian and Moldovan landowners complained about their serfs running off to Kiliya (modern Ukraine) and Galats (modern Gala≈£i, Romania) where the Host was based. Therefore, on 20 June, the host, which by that point numbered only 1387 men, was disbanded. Approximately 500 of them moved to the Kuban. This caused many of the remaining Danubians, who initially wished to follow the Kosh and move to Russia, to reconsider. After negotiations with the Russian General Kutuzov, many Nekarsovites were pardoned and allowed to move to Russia. The 1812 Treaty of Bucharest resulted in the Buhjak becoming part of Russia. With the old rivalry still strong, the Zaporozhian Danubians once again attacked their enemy, and in 1813 retook Katerlez. After a very brutal conflict, which shocked even the Turkish authorities, Zaporozhians captured the Nekrasovite capital Upper Dunavets (modern Romania) in 1814 . There they founded their final Sich. Many Nekrasov Cossacks were later re-located to Anatolia, while those who remained mixed with Lipovans and old-believers among the Danubian Cossacks. Service to the Sultan After a few years of peace, trouble once again came to the Balkans, with the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence. In 1821 the Russian-Greek commander Alexander Ypsilantis moved the Eterian Greeks from Russia to Wallachia. The Danubian Cossacks, under command of Kosh Nikifor Beluha, assisted in the defeat of this incursion. Afterwards five thousand Cossacks under the Kosh Semen Moroz were sent to Greece to fight for the Turks. In 1824 they took part in the storming of Messolonghi. Many died there, and Moroz himself was killed in the naval battle off the island of Chios. During this time the Danube Sich reached its height, numbering 10,000-15,000 men, and controlling all of the Danube delta region with six villages being in personal control of the Kosh. In the Upper Dunavets there were 38 kurens under old traditional names of the Zaporozhian Sich. However, the new Sich was noticeably different from its predecessor. There were no longer any Host Starshynas, and only un-married Cossacks were considered as eligible for service. Polkovnyks were assigned temporarily by the Kosh. The Host lacked any cavalry, only infantry in boats. The social structure also began to fragment; instead of the former equality of all Cossacks, many fishing, tradesmen and landowners became the Rayah. In order to gain permission to do so, there had to be at least a marriage link to a Cossack family. End Serhiy Vasilkivsky's painting of a Danubian Sich Cossack. In 1825 Kosh otaman Lytvyn promised to send another expedition to Greece but fled the Sich without any trace. The events in Greece once again affected relations between Turkey and Russia, and a new Russo-Turkish War broke out. Among the Danubian Cossacks there was as ever a pro-Russian and a pro-Turkish split. The former were willing to return to Russia if a pardon was given. Learning of this, the head (Hradonachalik) of Izmail S.A. Tuchkov entered into secret negotiations with Kosh Vasily Nezmayevsky (1827). The conditions were set to allow the whole Host to return to Russia. Despite being a Russophile, Nezmayevsky was not ready to accept such a move. With the outbreak of the new Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829), the Russian Army under command of Field-Marshal Peter Wittgenstein advanced. Threatening to overrun the Sich, the Sultan wished to relocate it to Adrianopol (modern Edirne, Turkey) and ordered the Kosh to rally the Dunubian Army to Silistra (modern Bulgaria). The new Kosh was Osyp Hladky, originally from a rich landowner family from Poltava who in 1820 had left his home to earn a living, but after a few failed business attempts in Crimea and Odessa, had left Russia and joined the Sich in 1822. He took part in the campaign against Messolonghi and afterwards was elected to be a Kuren Ataman of the Platnyrovsky Kuren. After the failed negotiations with Nezmayevsky, Tuchkov approached Hladky, who upon the Kosh elections held on Pokrov (1 October) was elected to be the Kosh Ataman. Gladky only gathered those that he suspected of having a pro-Turkish allegiance (about two thousand men) and set out for Silistra. After reaching there, he asked to return to the Sich to gather more. When he returned, he instead called for a Cossack Rada and announced his decision to side the whole Sich with Russia. On 10 May 1828, Hladky along with 218 Cossacks and 578 Rayah crossed the Danube with all the Sich regalia, treasury and prized possessions. After landing on the left bank, they were taken to the Russian headquarters where they knelt before Emperor Nicholas I himself, who was quoted saying: The Danubian Cossacks were fully pardoned for their past, and managed to win over the Tsar's trust, which was confirmed when the Russian Army Crossed the Danube, as Nicholas was in the same boat that Hladky had initially came over in, with Kosh Polkovnyks rowing. The Tsar let the Danubians form a new Special Zaporozhian Host (–û—Ç–¥–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ó–∞–ø–æ—Ä–æ–∂–Ω–æ–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ), with Hladky as the appointed Ataman. The new Host was small with only a five infantry sotnias (~100 men each) and came under the control of the Danube flotilla. Despite the small number of men, they soon became a prized asset due to their knowledge of the complicated Danube Delta. They proved themselves in combat in the storming of Isaccea, and 10 Cossacks were awarded the Cross of St. George. For those Danubian Sich Cossacks who refused to follow Hladky, their fate was tragic. Learning of Hladky's betrayal, the Sultan called upon the Janissary corps to raze the Sich, massacre its population and burn down its church. Even those that were in Silistra were disarmed and sent to forced labour deep in Turkey. Aftermath After the war ended, Russia remained to administer the Danubian Principalities. Nicholas I decided to form yet another new Cossack group the Danube Cossack Host, which was to include descendants of the Zaporozhians who fled Russia in 1775 but did not join the Sultan and instead settled in Bessarabia. In addition it included loyal Nekrasovites as well as many volunteers from the Balkan peoples. It was based in the many historical refuge areas, where over the previous decades many Cossacks fleeing from Turkey found sanctuary such as Akkerman. There were plans to relocate the Danubian Cossack Host to the Kuban, where Gladky visited in 1830. But the Caucasus War was in full swing, and the long journey for such a small group would have been too difficult. Instead the Tsar allowed Gladky to remain in Novorossiya and find a piece of land that was uninhabited (Rather than just let them remain). Gladky chose the northern coast of the Azov Sea, next to Berdyansk. In May 1832 Gladky carried his men over to the new land and there they formed the Azov Cossack Host. Initially numbering 2336 people (including 687 women), the new Host was the only Cossack force in Russia which had a Naval role, acting as a coast guard for the Caucasus and Crimean coasts, by defending them from Turkish and Circassian raiders. The remaining Cossacks who managed to escape the Sultan's vengeance, but did not return to Russia moved to the Danube Delta, where in 1830 they numbered 1,095 families. Over the years they were joined by other peasants fleeing serfdom in the Russian Empire. To date there is still a small Ukrainian minority living in the Dobruja region around Ukraine and Romania. In 1992 they numbered four thousand people according to official Romanian statistics Calculated from statistics for the counties of Tulcea and Constan≈£a from while the local community claims to number 20,000. Known as Rusnaks they continue to pursue the traditional Cossack lifestyle of hunting and fishing. Legacy The legacy of the Danube Cossacks survived in a lyrical-comic opera called \\"A Zaprorozhian Cossack beyond the Danube\\" (Zaporozhetz za Dunayem) composed in the 1850s by Semen Hulak-Artemovsky, a student of Mikhail Glinka. Although the opera historically relates to the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-9, where according to a peace treaty, the Danube cossacks were granted the right to return to their homeland, Hulak-Artemovsky reset the opera to take place in the 18th century. The opera first opened in St. Petersburg at the Mariinsky Theatre on 14 March 1863. After its premiere it was censored and restricted from performance.

The bridge is located near the Chinese Theater, opposite the central gates of the Catherine Palace. It is one of the entrances to Alexander Park. The bridge is named Large so to distinguish it from two Small (or Iron) Chinese Bridges located in the park. The Large Chinese Bridge was commissioned by Catherine the Great as part of her plan to create a Chinoiserie in her park. Catherine ordered Antonio Rinaldi and Charles Cameron to model the village after a Chinese engraving from her personal collection. The village was expected to consist of 18 stylized Chinese houses (only ten were completed), shadowed by an octagonal domed observatory (never completed at all). The Large Chinese Bridge is constructed out of pink granite. The most original features of the bridge are the low wall barriers stylishly decorated with tall, granite vases which have intertwining branches of red iron \\"coral\\" iron. Originally, in addition to the vases and iron coral, the Large Chinese Bridge was decorated with four painted plaster Chinese figures sitting on short pedestals and holding Chinese lanterns on long poles. However, these Chinese figures have not survived to the present day. To the left of the Large Chinese Bridge stand two Small Chinese bridges leading to the Chinese Village. At first these little bridges constructed by Charles Cameron in 1781 were wooden. In 1786 they were replaced with iron ones forged at the Sestroretsk Armory. The Large Chinese Bridge is one of three bridges that lead to the village. The Dragon Bridge, and the Large Chinese Bridge were completed in 1785 and the Cross-Shaped Bridge (Krestovoy Most) had been erected six years earlier. Catherine's death in 1796 led to the village being suspended until 1818 when Alexander I asked Vasily Stasov to remodel the village to provide accommodation for his guests. Although much of the original decor was removed, the renovated village provided a place to live for such important visitors.

Early life Kingston was born in Birr, County Offaly to William Kingston a shopkeeper, and Catherine (n√©e Roche). Brugha attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Roscrea. Her family later moved to Dublin when she was 31 and Brugha continued the activism she had been part of through the Gaelic League when she got there. Brugha married Irish revolutionary Cathal Brugha, head of a candle manufacture company, in 1912. Because of the family activities and involvement in the War of Independence, they moved several times, to the Ring Gaeltacht in Waterford and Ballybunion in Kerry. In the aftermath of the Truce the family was able to return to Dublin. Elections Cathal Brugha died in battle on 7 July 1922 in the first days of the Irish Civil War, having taken the Republican side opposing the Anglo-Irish Treaty. His death left her widowed with six children under the age of 10. She ran for what had been her husband's seat and was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Sinn F√©in TD at the 1923 general election for the Waterford constituency. She was re-elected at the June 1927 general election. In accordance with Sinn F√©in policy of the time she did not take her seat in D√°il √âireann.

Sinn F√©in was unable to raise the funds to contest the second election called that year,'Mr. Cosgrave And The Oath', The Times, 30 August 1927 and Brugha did not contest the September 1927 general election. Brugha successfully campaigned on the welfare of Republican prisoners. Later life She established a drapery business, Kingston's Ltd, in 1924 and following her exit from politics devoted much time to the venture.

Etymology Tegart police station, Nahalal. The forts are named after their designer, British police officer and engineer Sir Charles Tegart. In Israel, the name is often pronounced \\"Taggart\\". This is probably due to the transliteration of the name to Hebrew and then back to Latin alphabet, along with the translator's wrong assumption that the most common way of writing this anglicised Scottish surname has to be applied (\\"Taggart\\" is far more widespread than \\"Tegart\\"). History Sir Charles Tegart designed the forts in 1938 based on his experiences in the Indian insurgency. They were built of reinforced concrete with water systems that would allow them to withstand a month-long siege. Two types of forts were erected. Five structures were built to reinforce the so- called \\"Tegart's wall\\" of the northern border with Lebanon and Syria, using a specific design. Dozens more, of a different design to the northern forts and sharing a common basic plan, were built at strategic intersections in the interior of Palestine. Many of them can still be seen in Israel today, and continue to be used as police stations and jails.Anton La Guardia, Jericho Jail Creates Own Modern History, Los Angeles Times, reproduced in Arab News, March 24, 2006 accessed at 2007-02-28 One houses Camp 1391 prison for \\"high- risk\\" prisoners. In the West Bank, several such forts, now known as Mukataa (, \\"District\\") are used as offices and administrative centers of the Palestinian National Authority. The Mukataa was damaged by Israeli forces in Operation Defensive Shield and the later siege, was later restored and added to under President Mahmoud Abbas, obscuring the lines of the original British structure. The fort in Hebron was used as the headquarters of the Jordanian administration between 1949 and 1967, of the Israeli military governor between 1967 and 1997, and of the Palestinian Authority's governor between 1997 and 2002. It was destroyed in 2002 when the city was reconquered by Israeli forces in Operation Defensive Shield. The Tegart fort in Ma'alot-Tarshiha, now a police station, is being restored as a historical landmark, attracting the attention of preservationists and tourists.

In the , Kiels Mountain had a population of 664 people.  Geography  The Bruce Highway defines the western boundary of the locality. The mountain of the same name is central to the locality () and rises to . Eudlo Creek passes through the southeast tip of Kiels Mountain. Numerous creeks form on the slopes of the mountain, all of which are eventually tributaries of the Maroochy River. The land use is principally rural residential. History The mountain is named after Heinrich \\"Henry\\" August Keil who settled on the eastern slopes in 1880. Henry Keil was the son of one of the early Lutheran missionaries/settlers of Brisbane. The Keils were prominent Salvationists during the early growth of the Salvation Army on the Sunshine Coast, and were known for their charity to the local Aborigines. Kiels Mountain school was built on land near the corner of Preston and Diddillibah Roads, between Woombye and Diddillibah. It opened on 23 September 1918 and closed on 15 April 1962. On 7 December 2003, 13-year-old Daniel Morcombe disappeared while waiting for a bus on Nambour-Connection Rd (Old Bruce Highway), near the Kiel Mountain Road overpass at Woombye. An arrest was made in August 2011 in connection with his death. His remains were discovered near the Glass House Mountains. At the 2011 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 657. Spiritual retreat At the summit of Kiels Mountain is Avatar's Abode, a spiritual retreat dedicated to Meher Baba (1894-1969) who stayed there in 1958. Avatar's Abode is the oldest and longest-running Eastern retreat in Queensland.

With a height of 595 metres (1,952 ft), it is the second highest point in that range (after ≈Åysica at 612 meters or 2,008 ft). On its slopes and atop its summit are several hiking trails, the ruins of a pagan wall from 9th century, the Benedictine monastery ≈öwiƒôty Krzy≈º from the 11th century (destroyed during the Second World War, now partially restored), and a ≈öwiƒôty Krzy≈º TV Tower. The mountain also features prominently in a local legend about witches' sabbaths. Location Countryside ≈Åysa G√≥ra, composed primarily of quartzite and Cambrian slates, lies in the eastern part of the ≈Åysog√≥ry range, and is the second largest peak of the larger ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains (after ≈Åysica). A notable summit within the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski National Park, it is a vital point in many sightseeing trails of the region. The blue path to Pƒôtkowice begins here, and the red path from Go≈Çoszyce to Ku≈∫niaki passes through here. Notable landmarks Remains of the pagan wall. During the times of prehistory of Poland, ≈Åysa G√≥ra was likely a sacred mountain and a site of a pagan-cult temple of three gods, mentioned in the Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz. There are remains of a quartzite U-shaped wall surrounding the higher part of the hill, with length of about 1.5 km and height of 2m from 8th-10th centuries. The temple was abandoned after the baptism of Poland. The legend about witches' sabbaths is likely related to the old cult. Abbey in winter. On the site of the pagan temple the Benedictine monastery of Holy Cross (≈öwiƒôty Krzy≈º) was founded (according to a legend, in 1006, by king of Poland, Boles≈Çaw Chrobry, but most sources give the 11th century). The monastery was named after a fragment from Christ' Cross which was supposedly enshrined there, and was a site of frequent pilgrimages. The monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout its history, with the most significant destruction taking place in the 19th and 20th centuries. After partitions of Poland, the Russian Empire took over the building in 1819 and converted it into a prison. Partially restored during the interwar period after Poland regained independence, it was taken over by the Nazi Germany and used as a prison and execution site of Soviet prisoners of war (about 6000 perished here). Afterwards, the Polish communist government transferred the building to the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski National Park, which renovated parts of them. Currently the National Park has a museum in some of the former buildings, while a part has been taken over by another religious institute (Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate). The abbey, although now past its Golden Age, has given its names to the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Mountains range as well as the ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship itself. The abbey also holds some mummified bodies; one of them is rumored (but not confirmed) to belong to Prince Jeremi Wi≈õniowiecki. ≈öwiƒôty Krzy≈º TV Tower Another notable building found on the hill is the ≈öwiƒôty Krzy≈º TV Tower; the tallest free-standing TV tower in Poland. Built in 1966, it is a 157 metre tall concrete tower. The Soviet prisoners executed by the Nazis are buried in a mass grave near the peak. At the bottom of the hill, there is a monument to Poles who died in the Katyn massacre.

The NHF is based in California and describes its mission as protecting individuals' rights to use dietary supplements and alternative therapies without government restriction. The NHF also opposes mainstream public-health measures such as water fluoridation and compulsory childhood vaccines. The NHF was founded by Fred J. Hart in 1955, after he was ordered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to cease marketing fraudulent radionics devices. Mainstream medical organizations have criticized the NHF for promoting dubious alternative cancer treatments and health claims; the American Cancer Society recommends that cancer patients avoid products promoted by the NHF, while Quackwatch describes the NHF as \\"antagonistic to accepted scientific methods as well as to current consumer-protection law.\\" History and activities The National Health Federation was founded in 1955 by Fred J. Hart, and is the world's oldest health freedom organization. He promoted radionics devices. Hart founded the NHF to ensure free expression of health advances and alternatives as well as disagreeing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration compelling his company to cease marketing FDA non- authorized devices for medical treatment. Over the years, the NHF has promoted a range of alternative cancer therapies, including laetrile. According to its website, the NHF fought and won the battle for mandatory inspection of poultry, coordinated a drive to help chiropractors become legally licensed in the United States, waged a campaign against water fluoridation, and advocated legislative recognition of acupuncture in the United States. The Federation has collaborated with European consumer organizations and political parties in a campaign demanding that the European Union (EU) accept the outcome of a referendum in Ireland on the Lisbon Treaty. In the 1990s, the Federation lobbied on behalf of consumers and manufacturers to pass the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA), which put into place government quality controls of dietary supplements, health claims, good manufacturing practices and oversight by the Food and Drug Administration. The organization has stated vaccines are questionable and promoted claims that under certain conditions vaccines were dangerous, fought malathion spraying as an environmental toxin, and opposed the use of Class 5 poison fluorosilsilic acid in water fluoridation. The organization publishes a quarterly newsletter, Health Freedom News. It has a worldwide membership in 22 countries, and the only consumer health-freedom organization in the world to enjoy official observer status (able to speak out for health freedom) at meetings of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the highest international body on food standards. Scott Tips is the current president for the National Health Federation. He is a California-licensed attorney and former Managing Editor of the California Law Review. He has published extensively in Trade Magazines, updating readers on issues regarding consumer health and safety. He is the main representative at the CODEX meetings held throughout the year at different venues around the world. Reception The NHF is a non-profit organization promoting freedom of choice in the alternative medical community. The Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine by J.C. Segen defines the NHF as a \\"fringe medicine organization that exerts political pressure to secure 'health freedom' and 'freedom of medical choice' on behalf of alternative medicine practitioners, their families, and 'health food' consumers.\\" The American Cancer Society, noting that the NHF is \\"not a medical or scientific body,\\" recommended that \\"persons with cancer avoid the therapies and products promoted by the National Health Federation for the treatment of cancer.\\" Quackwatch calls NHF, based on Stephen Barrett, \\"an alliance of promoters and followers who engage in lobbying campaigns... and uses the words 'alternative,' and 'freedom' to suit its own purposes,\\" adding that \\"NHF is antagonistic to accepted scientific methods as well as to current consumer- protection law.\\" The NHF has been at the forefront internationally in protecting consumers' rights and nutrition. Most recently in Ottawa, Canada, they helped to successfully defeat organic label deception to have GMO foods labeled as \\"biofortification\\". They have a tireless record of attendance to speak out and aid accuracy of labeling, veterinary drug issues, herbecides, pesticides and other toxic chemical standards. They also maintain close attention to the language of Representatives which want to loosen standards of safety of toxic products by introducing new terminology of standards and new terms of consensus.

It is run by a Board of Management, but owned by the Religious Society of Friends.  History  Newtown School was founded in 1798 by the Religious Society of Friends (Quaker), on the estates of the former home of Sir Thomas Wyse. Its original purpose was the education of Quakers in the south of Ireland, and until 1858 no non-Quakers were admitted, although priority is given to applicants who are Quakers. In 1924 Newtown adopted a fully coeducational policy which it has maintained to the present day. Newtown School is a co-educational boarding and day school. Boarding facilities are offered on a three-weekly basis. Some students may opt for weekly boarding. There are two residences, for girls and boys separately. Accommodation is mostly in dorms but there are also twin and single rooms. Day students have the opportunity to become day boarders and remain in school until after evening study thus allowing them to take a full part in all aspects of school life.  Curriculum  = Junior cycle = For the Junior Cycle, Newtown follows the curriculum for the Junior Certificate. All offered subjects offered are available in Higher and Ordinary levels. First Year Scholars have access to twenty-one subjects. In Second and Third Year, all Junior Certificate candidates study Art, Craft & Design and Science, all have access to French and/or German and:or Spanish and all take a practical subject, either Materials Technology (woodwork) or Home Economics, Technical graphics , business studies or music. = Transition year = Newtown operates a compulsory Transition Year program. In recent years students have participated in kayaking, outdoor pursuits, Young Social Innovators, surfing, lifesaving courses, drama, media, personal development, nutrition, enterprise, crafts and fashion design. The programme also includes week-long work experience placements, and a European studies tour on themes pertinent to the programme, along with other courses that vary from year to year. = Senior cycle = The senior cycle begins at the end of Transition Year when students are asked to choose the subjects in which they would like to be examined at Leaving Certificate, in order of preference. The subjects offered in addition to the three compulsory subjects (English, Maths and Irish) vary each year, depending on demand(e.g. Applied Mathematics). At present there are over 20 Leaving Certificate subjects offered, all of which are available for study at any level.  Sports Facilities  Newtown has a 25m indoor swimming pool (with diving platforms and a diving board), a gym, a weights-room, an astroturf hockey pitch, an athletics track, two hockey training pitches, two rugby pitches, a cricket lawn and tennis courts.

It is east of Leeds city centre, and within the LS14 Leeds postcode area. The district falls within the Cross Gates and Whinmoor ward of the Leeds Metropolitan Council. In the 1950s, the Swarcliffe housing estate was developed by the city council which built two and three-bedroomed semi- detached council houses, a number of three-storey blocks containing 12 flats or more, and three brick-built nine-storey blocks of flats. Two of the blocks of flats were demolished in the 1990s and an old people's home was built on the site. In 2007, the remaining block was demolished. The previous year, six of seven fifteen-storey high-rise blocks of flats, built in 1966 as part of the Whinmoor estate, were demolished. Swarcliffe is served by Swarcliffe Primary School and Nursery, Grimes Dyke Primary School and St. Gregory's Youth & Adult Centre. Stanks Fire Station provides a service to more than 42,452 people. Swarcliffe has a dwindling number of public houses and shops. Great and Little Swarcliffe Woods lie within the boundaries of the estate. The area is being regenerated by Yorkshire Transformations; a private finance initiative, which is a partnership between Leeds City Council and two private sector companies: Carillion and the Bank of Scotland. The MP for the Leeds East constituency from 1955 to 1992 was Denis Healey, who represented the Labour Party. He was succeeded by George Mudie MP. In 2009, the population of Swarcliffe and Stanks was 6,751, of which 4,544 were considered to be \\"hard- pressed\\", or experiencing financial difficulty. History Cock Beck going north from Barwick Road The Battle of the Winwaed, between the army of the Christian king Oswiu of Bernicia and the pagan army of King Penda of Mercia, took place in 655 AD, according to Bede, although some historians favour 654 or 656. The actual site of the battle is disputed, but one possibility is that the River Winwaed is now the Cock Beck; to the east of Swarcliffe. The battle is remembered in the names of Pendas Way, a street south of Swarcliffe, and the nearby Pendas Fields estate. After the Norman Conquest in 1066, William the Conqueror granted the parish of Whitkirk, which included Seacroft, to Ilbert de Lacy of Pontefract, whose descendants held the title of Earl of Lincoln. The parish was subsequently leased by the de Lacys to the Somerville family. During the English Civil War in 1643, Lord Goring's Royalist army defeated the Parliamentarians under Sir Thomas Fairfax at the Battle of Seacroft Moor. In the 1820s, Swarcliffe and Stanks were part of the Barwick- in-Elmet parish. The name Stanks derives from a French word meaning ponds or pools of putrid water. Before the Swarcliffe Estate was built, the area contained Winmore Lodge (renamed Winn Moor Lodge in 1893), Penwell House, Hill Top, Spikeland Nook, Swarcliffe Farm,In 1997, Alan Noble, the church warden of St James‚Äô Church, Seacroft, remembered moving to a tied cottage in Taylors Yard in 1926, when his father was employed by Mr. Presious; the owner of Swarcliffe Farm.

An 1893‚Äì1894 Ordnance Survey map of Seacroft, showing Swarcliffe's woods/plantations (marked in red) The Leeds to Halton Dial road was turnpiked in 1751. Tolls were collected at the Penny Toll; a toll house on York Road, at the north-eastern border of the area. This road is the A64 Leeds to York road The toll house was owned by Sir Thomas Gascoigne, whose agents charged one penny per pair of wheels, which was \\"a considerable sum\\", according to the historian, Ralph Thoresby, who visited the area in 1702. In 1886, the property was owned by Colonel Frederick Trench-Gascoigne, of Parlington Hall, Aberford, who rented it out for three pounds, fourteen shillings and sixpence a year. Gascoigne owned and rented out a number of houses, coal mines, woodland and farm land in Seacroft, Whinmoor, Barnbow, Garforth, Barwick-in-Elmet, Cross Gates, and Scholes. The toll house was situated north of a cottage and a 19th-century granite-built windmill, which is now part of the Britannia Hotels Leeds hotel. In the mid-1800s, Isaac Chippindale, who lived at Windmill Farm, started the Scholes Brick and Tile Works on Wood Lane, on the border with Scholes. The company's quarry produced high quality bricks which were used to build many houses in the surrounding area. Its kilns and house were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving two small fishing lakes, but the site is still known as \\"Chippy's Quarry\\". The Leeds to Wetherby Railway had a station at Scholes and passed under the turnpike to the northeast. The line was built by the North Eastern Railway and ran past the eastern border of Swarcliffe and Stanks. It opened on 1 May 1876 and closed in 1964. Services were withdrawn as part of the Beeching Axe; an informal name for the British Government's attempt to reduce the cost of running British Railways in the 1960s. In 1874, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners published a report which noted that two new parishes would be delineated by \\"an imaginary line commencing at the point where the boundary dividing the said new parish of Seacroft from the new parish of Manston aforesaid crosses the footpath leading from Seacroft through Little Swarcliffe Plantation to Wood Laith Lane\\"‚Äîleading from the Cock Beck to Scholes; now called Wood Lane. In 1812, the title Squire of Seacroft was held by the Wilson family: the last member of which was Squire Darcy Bruce Wilson. According to the 1891 census, he lived at Seacroft Hall with his sister, Louisa, and five servants: a footman, cook, kitchen maid and two housemaids. He was a Master of Arts, Barrister at Law, Justice of the peace, and a captain in the Yorkshire Hussars. After his death at Seacroft Hall in 1936, his nephew sold the family estate to Leeds Corporation one year later. The hall was demolished in 1953, and its ornamental lake was filled in to make way for Parklands Girls' High School. Templar Villas, a cluster of semi-detached Victorian houses, was built on Templar Lane/Barwick Road before 1893, and a row of large houses was built on Templar Lane before 1908. Between 1938 and 1952, private houses were built on the north side of Barwick Road, between Stanks Lane South and the Cock Beck. = Development = prefabricated panels in the 1950s, before refurbishment in the late 2000s Modern flats in place of Elmet Towers. To the left is Great Swarcliffe Woods In a boundary change on 1 April 1937, Whinmoor was added to the Leeds County Borough from the Tadcaster Rural District. In 1953, The Civil Engineer reported that Leeds City Council paid Myton Ltd from Kingston upon Hull, ¬£227,232 \\"for the erection of 172 dwellings on the Swarcliffe (Seacroft) Estate\\". In 1955, The Civil Engineer reported that Leeds City Council paid ¬£2,867 for \\"Electrical installations in 130 dwellings at the Swarcliffe (Seacroft) estate\\". The estate was built between the Seacroft and Manston estates, bordered by the A6120 Leeds Outer Ring Road to the west, the A64 York Road to the north, and Barwick Road to the south, with Cock Beck and Scholes to the east. The adjacent Whinmoor estate was built in the 1960s, to the east and north. Swarcliffe measures , from north-west to south-east, and , from east to west. It is , east of the Leeds city centre, and within the LS14 Leeds postcode area, which encompasses Swarcliffe, Seacroft, Whinmoor, Killingbeck, Scarcroft, and Thorner. The housing estate consisted of two and three-bedroomed semi-detached houses, and a number of three-storey blocks containing 12 flats or more, but some have been demolished. Most houses were built of brick, but a number were constructed of prefabricated cinder and concrete panels. The right to buy scheme, implemented by the Conservative Party in the Housing Act of 1980, enabled tenants to buy their homes. In 2008, the average price for a house in Swarcliffe was ¬£109,810. In 2010, 1,025 homes were privately owned, and 1,394 were rented. Swarcliffe was noted for its trio of brick ten-storey flats, built to a T-plan with access from balconies. Each block contained 60 dwellings. The Leeds Planning Committee approved the application in 1959. The contract to build the development was won by W J Simms Sons & Cooke Ltd. In 1998, Swarcliffe Towers and Manston Towers were demolished. In 2007, Elmet Towers was also demolished. An old people's home, Woodview Court, was built on the site of Swarcliffe Towers and Manston Towers, and new housing was built on the Elmet Towers site. The West Yorkshire Archaeological Service believes that the Elmet Towers site may contain the remains of medieval pottery, which was once manufactured there. = Boundary change, demolitions and redevelopment = Example of terraced, partly prefabricated 1960s housing on the Swarcliffe estate in the 1960s Since Swarcliffe estate was built in the 1950s, and Whinmoor estate in the 1960s, the southern part of Whinmoor is now within the Swarcliffe boundary.A small part of the Swarcliffe estate in the north-east is now within Seacroft Houses built in the Whinmoor area were mostly prefabricated terraces, along with seven partly prefabricated high-rise blocks: 44 metres high, with fifteen floors. The Leeds Neighbourhood Index, provided by Leeds City Council, states that the new boundary contains 38 per cent terraced housing, 37 per cent semi-detached and 22 per cent purpose-built flats: 1,187 semi-detached homes, 873 terraced, 488 flats, 108 detached, 46 bungalows, and 28 maisonettes. Langbar Towers, next to a shopping parade, was the first of five 15-storey H-plan tower blocks to be completed at Whinmoor. The high rise blocks had reinforced concrete frames with no-fines concrete infill panels. The planning application was approved in 1964 and the first block, Langbar Towers, completed on 24 January 1966 was officially opened on 19 February 1966 by Denis Healey MP. Ash Tree Court, Brayton Grange, Farndale Court, Langbar Grange, Langbar Towers and Pennwell Croft, six of seven high- rise blocks of flats built in 1966, were demolished in 2006. Sherburn Court, the remaining high-rise block, was refurbished and given a new roof, windows and lifts. A ¬£100 million scheme to refurbish the area's housing, funded by a public-private partnership scheme, started in 2006. This Private finance initiative, operating as Yorkshire Transformations, is a partnership between Leeds City Council and private sector companies; Carillion and the Bank of Scotland. In the late 2000s, Persimmon Homes built St Gregory's, seventy-three private houses east of Stanks Drive. Governance Swarcliffe is in the Cross Gates and Whinmoor ward of the City of Leeds. It is currently represented by three Labour councillors: Suzi Armitage (elected to serve until 2012), Peter Gruen (elected to serve until 2014), and Pauleen Grahame (elected 2011), who lives in Swarcliffe. All three hold surgeries at St Gregory's Youth & Adult Centre. Denis Healey (Labour) was the MP from 1955 to 1992, when he was succeeded by George Mudie, who was succeeded by Richard Burgon in 2015. Since the boundary changes which took effect before the 2010 general election, the Leeds East constituency has been composed of Swarcliffe, Cross Gates, Whinmoor, Seacroft, Gipton, Harehills, Killingbeck, Temple Newsam, Halton Moor, Halton, Whitkirk, Colton and Austhorpe. The Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for Yorkshire and the Humber European Parliament constituency elected in the 2009 European Parliament election, were Godfrey Bloom (UK Independence Party), Andrew Brons (BNP), Timothy Kirkhope (Conservative), Linda McAvan (Labour), Edward McMillan-Scott (Liberal Democrat), and Diana Wallis (Liberal Democrat). Geography Boundary Map of Swarcliffe The Swarcliffe housing estate is situated between the Seacroft, Whinmoor and Manston estates, and is bordered by the A64/York Road to the north, Barwick Road to the south, Cock Beck and Scholes to the east, and the A6120, Leeds Outer Ring Road to the west. The smaller Stanks estate is included in the Swarcliffe area. After the western part of the estate was built in the 1950s, Whinmoor estate was built to the east and north in the 1960s. After a boundary change, the southern part of Whinmoor (to the east of the original Swarcliffe estate) is now part of Swarcliffe. The underlying rocks are coal measures towards the northern extremity of the Yorkshire coalfield containing shales, mudstones, sandstones and coal seams laid down in the Carboniferous period. The rock strata have a general dip towards the south and south-east. Great Swarcliffe Wood, formerly Great Swarcliffe Plantation, which borders Swarcliffe Avenue, Eastwood Gardens, Swarcliffe Drive and Eastwood Drive, contains an abundance of sycamore, oak and rowan trees, being approximately long, and wide. The Little Swarcliffe Wood, formerly Little Swarcliffe Plantation, borders Swarcliffe Drive, but can be accessed via Swarcliffe Bank. It has a collection of European trees, including sycamore, oak, ash, elm and lime. It is approximately long, and wide. Although the woods can be crossed along desire pathways, there are no official public rights of way. Fed by the Grimes Dike from the north of York Road, the Cock Beck runs in a southerly direction past Swarcliffe and Stanks' eastern borders, and joins the River Wharfe to the south of Tadcaster. =Neighbouring districts= =Climate= Although the climate in Swarcliffe is generally relatively moderate, in 2011 it was reported that extreme winds had damaged the roofs of several flats in the Lombardy House block on Southwood Close. Structural engineers were called to inspect the damage. Demography In 2009, the population of Swarcliffe and Stanks was 6,751, of which 4,544 were considered to be \\"hard-pressed\\", or experiencing financial difficulty. In the 2001 census Swarcliffe was recorded as having 4,819 Christians, 18 Sikhs, 17 Muslims, nine Buddhists, six Hindus and six Jews.

In the early 1960s, Oxfam made a colour film for its 21st anniversary about the pupils of Swarcliffe School, called Swarcliffe Junior School Presents Our Daily Bread, which featured pupils creating a stand for Leeds' Freedom From Hunger exhibition. In September 1964, St. Gregory's Catholic Primary School opened on Stanks Gardens to accommodate the overflow of children from St Theresa's Primary School in Cross Gates, which is , to the south. In 1989, the school moved to the former St. Kevin's Secondary modern school premises on Barwick Road. The school closed in 2008 and was demolished in late 2009. The old school became St Gregory's Youth & Adult Centre, offering adult education classes, older people's services, child care, a Youth Service, and the Swarcliffe Good Neighbours Scheme which was established in 1994.In 2010, 600 people signed a petition to prevent the closure of the centre. Grimes Dyke Primary School was built in the late 1960s in the north eastern part of Swarcliffe. In a 2008 census, it was reported that 1,419 children lived in the Swarcliffe area. Swarcliffe Children's Centre is a privately owned day nursery, on Langbar Road (behind The Staging Post public house), and the Tykes Pre-School Playgroup is situated in the St Gregory's Y & A Centre, Stank Gardens. Churches St Luke's Church is in the parish of Seacroft and part of the Seacroft Team Ministry; a group of (Anglican) churches in Seacroft, Whinmoor and Swarcliffe. The parish is in the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds. Funds to build the church were provided by the Lilley family, who were connected with the Samuel Smith Brewery in Tadcaster. The church was designed by M. J. Farmer and built in 1963, with stone taken from Ripon Cathedral being used to support the altar. Swarcliffe Baptist Church opposite Swarcliffe Primary School and Nursery, was used as a classroom when the school suffered from overcrowding. Stanks Methodist Church on Barwick Road was opened on 23 February 1869 by Primitive Methodists, but the building was closed and the congregation disbanded in 2007. St. Gregory's Roman Catholic Church (Swarcliffe Drive, opposite Southwood Gate), formally called St. Gregory the Great Church, is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds. The land on which it stands was bought in 1954, but before building work started, mass was held in the priest's council house, with confessions taken through the dining hatch of the kitchen. The first church on the site, a simple red brick hall opened on 11 October 1956, is now occupied by St Gregory's Social Club. On 12 March 1970, an octagonal church of modern design, by A. G. Pritchard Son & Partners, was opened next to the original church. It has simple bench seating for 335 worshippers. St Gregory's Social Club hosts meetings of the Swarcliffe and Stanks' Residents and Tenants' Association.

An inning in baseball, softball, and similar games is the basic unit of play, consisting of two halves or frames, the \\"top\\" (first half) and the \\"bottom\\" (second half). In each half, one team bats until three outs are made, with the other team playing defense. A full baseball game typically is scheduled for nine innings, while softball games consist of seven innings; although this may be shortened due to weather or extended if the score is tied at the end of the scheduled innings. The use of the term inning in baseball and softball contrasts with cricket and rounders, in which the term is innings in both singular and plural. Gameplay Each half-inning formally starts when the umpire calls \\"Play\\" or \\"Play ball\\". A full inning consists of six outs, three for each team; and, in Major League Baseball and most other adult leagues, a regulation game consists of nine innings. The visiting team bats in the first half-inning, the top of the inning, derived from the position of the visiting team at the top line of a baseball line score. The home team's half of an inning is the bottom of the inning, and the break between halves of an inning is the middle of the inning. If the home team is leading in the middle of the final scheduled inning, or scores to take the lead in the bottom of the final scheduled inning, the game immediately ends in a home victory. In most leagues, if the score is tied after the final scheduled inning, the game goes into extra innings until an inning ends with one team ahead of the other. In Japanese baseball, however, games end if tied after 12 innings (or, in postseason play in Nippon Professional Baseball, 15 innings). For the 2011 and 2012 NPB season, a game also ended in a tie if a regular-season game has reached its 3-hour, 30-minute time limit, and both teams are tied. As in the case of the ninth inning, a home team which scores to take a lead in any extra inning automatically wins, and the inning (and the game) is considered complete at that moment regardless of the number of outs. This is commonly referred to as a \\"walk-off\\" situation since the last play results in the teams walking off the field because the game is over. However, road teams can't earn a \\"walk-off\\" victory by scoring the go-ahead run in extra innings, unlike in ice hockey where the team (either home or away) scoring first in overtime automatically wins. A baseball game can be shorter than scheduled innings if it is interrupted by rain (or other bad weather). Such a game called a rain out, is often preceded by a rain delay, a pause in the game during which the umpires will try to determine if the weather will allow the game to continue. If so, the game will simply be delayed until the rain stops, and then play will resume. If not, the umpires will announce a rainout and play will be suspended for the day. The game may have to be replayed in its entirety at a later date, but under certain circumstances, a game shortened because of rain can count as an official game, and the team that was ahead at the time the game was called will be awarded the win. See the article on rainout (sports) for further details.Baseball Explained by Phillip Mahony, McFarland Books, 2014. See www.baseballexplained.com Professional baseball games as well as college baseball games are scheduled for nine innings. Softball games and high school baseball games are scheduled for seven innings, as are some minor league baseball doubleheaders. College games may be shortened to seven innings if one team's score is ahead by a minimum of ten runs. Little League games are scheduled for six innings and may be shortened further (auto-forfeit) if a team has an overwhelming scoring lead. Terminology Ending a half-inning is referred to as \\"retiring the side\\". A half-inning in which all batters are put out without taking a base is referred to as a \\"one-two-three inning\\". The number of innings a pitcher is in a game is measured by the innings pitched statistic. In US English, baseball terminology is sometimes found in non-sports usage in a tense situation: \\"it's the bottom of the ninth [inning]\\" (sometimes adding, \\"with two outs\\"), meaning \\"there isn't much time to turn things around here\\". While inning is the standard baseball term, there is at least one literary instance, of innings being used in a baseball context. This occurs in the story \\"Baseball Hattie\\" by Damon Runyon, who refers to the seventh innings of a Phillies-Giants game.

His nickname was The Lion for his matches. Since 2011, he played for the British Darts Organisation (BDO). Sams' first televised darts match was on Anglia Television in 1986 at the Ladbrokes Festival (British Matchplay). He reached the final, but lost to Terry O'Dea. He then had some minor tournament victories including the Camber Sands Singles (1988) and Kent Open (1988 and 1989) but it was a long time before he made any impact on the darts circuit. Professional Darts Corporation career His career turned for the better after joining the PDC. He hit a perfect nine-dart leg in a match against Ronnie Baxter in Montreal in May 2002 ‚Äì there was no prize for the achievement, but players passed round a hat to collect $400. He qualified for the PDC World Championship for the first time in 2004 and beat Roland Scholten before losing to Simon Whatley in the last 16. Sams consistently reached the last 16 of tournaments on the PDC circuit, which helped him to maintain a world ranking inside the top 32. He was seeded 16th in 2006 and 22nd in 2007 for the World Championship as a result. Sams was successful at the West Tyrone Open in February 2007, winning the singles and the doubles event, with Sean McGowan. Career decline Sams' record at the World Championship has been poor since reaching the last 16 in 2004 and he lost his first match at each of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 Championships. He also failed to achieve success in the other televised tournaments, being unable to reach the quarter-final stage of any of the majors. He slipped outside the top 32 towards the end of 2007, and as a result, he inadvertently failed to enter himself for the qualifying rounds for the 2008 World Championship, missing out on the tournament for the first time since 2003. He has failed to qualify for the PDC World Championship since 2007. During 2009, he reached two quarter finals on the PDC Pro Tour, but ended the year with only ¬£6,100 in total prize money. He had a further decline in 2010, picking up just ¬£600 in total prize money, as he entered fewer events and then failed to get past the last 64 stage of any Pro Tour Event. His PDC ranking fell to near 100 at the start of 2011 and he chose to decline a Pro Tour card for the year, effectively ending his PDC career.

Activities, goals and values thumb thumb thumb thumb Ten Sing work is based on a common agreement between member countries of the European Ten Sing Group ‚Äì The Ten Sing Idea: Abstract Ten Sing is a YMCA international Youth programme and YWCA (Young Women's Christian Association), which focuses on getting young people to express themselves by using their own culture through creative performing arts. The main aims The underlying objectives are leadership training, democracy training and personal and social development of body, mind and spirit. Ten Sing invites young people to a creative work process that uses different cultural expressions in a Christian context. The five C's The five C's \\"Culture, Creativity, Care, Competence and Christ\\" are equally important parts of the Ten Sing idea. By young people, for young people. Young people know best what young people think, dream of, feel and desire. Therefore, young people should be active in the management of Ten Sing and take responsibility for running programmes themselves. Young responsibility, adult presence Ten Sing is for young people, with young people and run by young people. Even though the young people are responsible for the programme, it is important to have adult presence. Adults should act as mentors for the youth leaders. The adults should be a resource for help, support and advice when needed. The whole human being Everybody has talents that can be used in Ten Sing, and everyone should get the chance to be creative and active with his or her own mind and body, thus stimulating their spirit. This happens through a great variety of performing arts, such as music, dance, drama, video and other creative expressions. The Ten Sing programme focuses on \\"the whole human being\\", with spirit, mind and body. Process before product To reach the goal of developing young people, Ten Sing focuses on the process of making a creative performance. The process is the tool to make everybody contribute. Therefore, the young people should develop both social and creative skills. This is why the process itself is the key: Letting the young people work together regularly in a safe environment, trying and failing, challenging each other, developing and growing, whilst creating a product that the young people can enjoy and be proud of. This enables them to reflect and value their achievements and skills gained through the process. Open membership, Christian leadership Ten Sing is open to everyone irrespective of gender, beliefs, abilities, talents, ethnic and social background. It is not necessary to be a Christian to be a member of Ten Sing. Nevertheless, to secure the Christian context of Ten Sing it's important that at least one of the key leaders is a Christian. Origin Ten Sing originated from Norway in 1968. The name \\"Ten Sing\\" is a combination of the Norwegian suffix \\"-ten\\" (en. \\"-teen\\") and the English word \\"sing\\" ‚Äì a kind of language mixing that was quite common in Norway at the time. The first Ten Sing group was started in Bergen by Kjell Gr√∏nner. It was inspired by Sing Out, which later became known as Up with People. The years that followed more groups were formed in Norway, and today there are over hundred groups all over Norway. The Norwegian YWCA‚ÄìYMCA wanted to implement Ten Sing in other European countries, and the starting point was Germany in 1986. This was the start of Ten Sing Norwegen, now Ten Sing Norway. The first European Ten Sing Conference was held in 1987.

The musical had been variously described as an operetta and a genuine comic opera in the press. Ford presented a tryout of the musical, titled Dear Enemy at the Ohio Colonial Theatre in July 1925. After rewrites, it played for a week in Baltimore in early September 1925.Dearest Enemy, New World Records, 2013, accessed February 7, 2016 The Broadway production opened on September 18, 1925 at the Knickerbocker Theatre and closed on May 22, 1926, after 286 performances.

Patriot Mary Murray (of the Muray Hill Murrays) and her young ladies are working to sew uniforms for American soldiers, but they are sad at the absence of their young men. Mary's flirty daughter Jane leads British General Tryon's son Harry to her house; she finds him charming. His commander, General Howe, and some British officers commandeer Mary's house as their temporary headquarters. Mary instructs the houseful of beautiful young ladies to discourage the British soldiers, but the girls are eager to engage the enemy in more than just conversation. George Washington sends word to Mary asking her to try to detain Howe and his officers overnight. Mary's feisty, feminist Irish niece Betsy Burke comes home wearing only a barrel after a dog steals her clothes while she is swimming. British Captain Sir John Copeland has gallantly supplied the barrel. Though divided by nationality and Copeland's sexism, they fall in love (\\"Here In My Arms\\"). Mary gives a Ball for the British officers, promising to show them some of the beauties of the local countryside. The British soldiers are happy to spend time consuming refreshment and indulging in music, dancing and flirtation at the Murray mansion. Betsy and Sir John dream of being together when the war is over as Jane and Harry also fall in love (\\"Bye and Bye\\"). Mary's messenger is captured, and Betsy volunteers to take an update to General Washington. She is told to return to Mary's house and, when the coast is clear for the American soldiers to move, to light a lantern then put it out.

While interned at the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, he was the editor of the internment camp's newspaper, The Heart Mountain Sentinel. After being freed from the camp in 1943, Hosokawa worked as a columnist and editor at The Denver Post for 38 years. He retired from the newspaper industry in 1992, at the age of 77. Hosokawa was also a prolific author. His best-selling book Nisei: The Quiet Americans (1969) chronicles the experiences of second-generation Japanese Americans, known as Nisei. Hosokawa published his final work, Colorado's Japanese Americans: From 1886 to the Present (2005), when he was 90 years old. His other books include Out of the Frying Pan (1998), Thirty-Five Years in the Frying Pan (1978), Thunder in the Rockies (1976), The Two Worlds of Jim Yoshida (1972), and The Uranium Age (1955). Hosokawa was a recipient of the 2007 Civil Rights Award from the Anti-Defamation League. Early life/Middle Life Bill Hosokawa was born on January 30, 1915, in Seattle, Washington. His parents were recent immigrants from Japan. His father, Setsugo Hosokawa, who immigrated from Hiroshima, Japan, in 1899 at the age of 15, worked as a migrant farm worker and a railroad section hand in Montana. Hosokawa's parents eventually settled in Seattle. Hosokawa graduated from Garfield High School in Seattle. He enrolled at the University of Washington, where he earned his bachelor's degree in journalism in 1937. In 1936, while a student at UW, Hosokawa's professor and adviser strongly recommended that he abandon his journalism career goals, because no newsroom would hire a Japanese American. Career Hosokawa and his new wife, Alice Miyake, moved to Asia in 1938 because he was unable to land a job at any major metropolitan newspaper in the United States. He found a job working at an English-language newspaper in Singapore. He was later employed by a magazine in Shanghai, China. Hosokawa's wife returned to the U.S. in anticipation of the birth of their first child. Hosokawa did not see his son, Michael, until the baby was 14 months old. The family lived in Seattle in 1941, just before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Soon after the attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066. As a result, Bill Hosokawa, his wife, and the couple's infant son were among 120,000 Japanese Americans on the West Coast who were sent to Japanese internment camps during World War II. Julena Steinheider (far right), in his home at Heart Mountain The Hosokawa family were sent first to an assembly center at the Puyallup, Washington fairgrounds where the family, along with others from the Seattle area, lived in horse stalls while the camps were being built. The family was moved to the Heart Mountain Relocation Center in Wyoming when he was 27 years old. Hosokawa's later writings and news reports were influenced by his time spent interned with fellow second-generation Japanese Americans, who were known as Nisei, and their children, such as his son, who were known as Sansei. Since Hosokawa had journalism and writing experience, he was appointed the editor of the Heart Mountain Relocation Camp newspaper, The Heart Mountain Sentinel. Hosokawa and his family were released from the internment camp in 1943, so he could work as a copy editor at The Des Moines Register. However, the experience of internment stayed with Hosokawa. For more than forty years Hosokawa published a column in the Pacific Citizen entitled From The Frying Pan. His column offered his personal observations on the internment of Japanese Americans. His topics included bigotry and what he called \\"native fascism.\\" His later entries sometimes focused on parenthood and travel, but he usually stayed on the topic of discrimination. Hosokawa finally received a position with a major metropolitan newsroom after World War II, when he accepted a job with the Denver Post. He served as a war correspondent for the Denver Post during the Korean War and Vietnam War. He also worked at the Post as a columnist, associate editor, and assistant managing editor at the paper. He also held the post of the editor of the Denver Post's Sunday magazine for twenty-five years. He left the Denver Post in 1984 and took a position as the reader ombudsman at the Rocky Mountain News, which was the archrival of the Denver Post. He remained with the Rocky Mountain News for eight years, until his retirement from the newspaper business in 1992. Hosokawa worked to promote opportunities from Nisei and Sansei Japanese Americans during his career. He often helped Japanese Americans, as well as recent immigrants, find jobs and counseling. According to the Rocky Mountain News, Hosokawa once even gave away his living room couch to a couple who needed it. He also worked to promote positive Japan ‚Äì United States relations. He served as the Honorary Consul General of Japan for Colorado from 1976 until 1999. Career as a writer Hosokawa's books and writings were deeply influenced by his experience as a Japanese American in the internment camps during World War II. His first major work, Nisei: The Quiet Americans, which explored this experience, became a national bestseller when it was published in 1969. He also focused some of his writings on his love of newspapers. His 1976 book, Thunder in the Rockies, chronicled the history of the Denver Post. His last book, Colorado's Japanese Americans: From 1886 to the Present, was published in 2005 when he was 90 years old. Some of his writings were inscribed onto the National Japanese American Memorial in Washington D.C. when the monument was dedicated in 2000. =Books written by Bill Hosokawa= *Nisei: The Quiet Americans (Paperback - April 2002) *Old Man Thunder: Father of the Bullet Train (Hardcover - Dec 1997) *Thunder in the Rockies: The Incredible Denver Post (Hardcover - 1976) *Colorado's Japanese Americans: From 1886 to the Present (Hardcover - Oct 30, 2005) *JACL: In Quest of Justice (Hardcover - Dec 1982) =Co-authored by Bill Hosokawa= *They Call Me Moses Masaoka: An American Saga by Mike Masaoka and Bill Hosokawa (Hardcover - Sep 1987) *From Foe to Friend: One Man's Experience in Japanese/American Trade by Shinsaku Sogo and Bill Hosokawa (Hardcover - April 2002) *East To America A History of the Japanese in the United States by Robert A.

In 2003, the Asian American Journalists Association presented Hosokawa with its lifetime achievement award for his work. Most recently, he was a recipient of the 2007 Civil Rights Award from the Anti-Defamation League. Additionally, the Japan Society of Colorado sponsors a fellowship in the name of Bill and Alice Hosokawa's name. Death Bill Hosokawa died on November 9, 2007, at the age of 92 at the home of his daughter, Christie Harveson, in Sequim, Washington, where he had lived for the previous four months. Hosokawa's wife, Alice, died in 1998, while his youngest son, Peter, died in 2006. He was survived by his two daughters, Christie and Susan, his son, Michael, his brother, Robert Hosokawa, as well as eight grandchildren and seven great grandchildren. In a column published in the Denver Post on November 22, 2007, Hosokawa's colleague Fred Brown called him a \\"champion of civility, dignity and human rights\\".

To date, the IWC has designated two such sanctuaries, the other being the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary. Area The northern boundary of the sanctuary follows the 40¬∞S parallel of latitude except in the Indian Ocean sector where it joins the southern boundary of the Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary at 55¬∞S, and around South America and into the South Pacific where the boundary is at 60¬∞S. History The Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was established by the IWC in 1994 with 23 countries supporting the agreement and Japan opposing it. The status of the Southern Ocean Sanctuary is reviewed and open to change by the IWC every 10 years. During the 2004 meeting a proposal was made by Japan to remove the sanctuary, but it failed to reach the 75% majority required (it received 25 votes in favour and 30 votes against with two abstentions). Controversy and enforcement While commercial whaling is prohibited in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) has continued to hunt whales inside the Sanctuary in accordance with a provision in the IWC charter permitting whaling for the purposes of scientific research. Japan clarified its position on whaling in a number of forums, noting that while some whale species are threatened, many such as minke whale are not. Some conservation groups such as the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society claim Japan's whaling operations are conducted in violation of the IWC charter, arguing that Japan's self-imposed annual quota of 1000 whale kills for research is not really scientific activity, but rather a veil to cover commercial fishing operations as whale meat ends up being sold in Japanese markets. In an open letter to the Japanese government, published in 2002 in the New York Times and sponsored by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), 21 scientists declared that they \\"believe Japan's whale 'research' program fails to meet minimum standards for credible science\\". They were \\"concerned that Japan's whaling program is not designed to answer scientific questions relevant to the management of whales; that Japan refuses to make the information it collects available for independent review; and that its research program lacks testable hypotheses or other performance indicators consistent with accepted scientific standards\\". They accused Japan of \\"using the pretense of scientific research to evade its commitments to the world community\\". The Australian delegation to the IWC has argued to repeal the provision that allows nations to harvest whales for scientific research, to no effect. Japan, meanwhile, lodged a formal objection to the sanctuary with regard to minke whales, meaning that the terms of the sanctuary do not apply to its harvest of that species within the boundaries of the sanctuary. Claiming the Japanese whaling fleet's actions to be illegal, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society acts against Japanese whaling ships engaged in yearly hunts, attempting to interrupt or cut short the whaling activities. The ICR considers the activists' methods as constituting piracy, terrorism, and illegal harassment of the ICR fleet. Critics of the ICR point out that recent scientific advances allow for the use of non-lethal techniques in cetacean research, such as biopsies or determination of cetacean dietary intake through analysis of DNA samples from whale feces. During the 2010/2011 whaling season, the ICR was forced to halt its whaling operations due to the actions of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, having harvested 172 whales (a fifth of their season quota). The ICR dispatched its whaling fleet as usual to the Northwest Pacific survey (JARPN II), with a quota for 260 whales, including 100 Minkes. Dispute over legality Japan has argued that the establishment of the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary was in contravention of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) on which the IWC is based and is therefore illegal. This view received strong support from Professor W. T. Burke of the University of Washington in his paper circulated as IWC Document Number IWC/48/33. He refers to Article V(2) of the ICRW, which states that the creation of any sanctuary must \\"be based on scientific findings\\" and \\"take into consideration the interests of the consumers of whale products and the whaling industry\\".Chairman's Report of the 47th Meeting. (IWC. 1995). pp.23-24 Prof Burke's interpretation is disputed by Prof Chris Wold of the Northwestern School of Law of Lewis & Clark College, who argued that the IWC must maintain both the conservation and whaling industry objectives of the ICRW. This view is supported by Alexander Gillespie, Professor of Law at the University of Waikato, who reasoned in his 2006 book, Whaling Diplomacy, that phrases such as \\"best interests of the whaling industry\\" must now consider commercial non-consumptive use (such as whale watching). As there is no settlement procedure in the IWC for this type of dispute, Japan has asked the IWC to submit its case to a relevant legal body for analysis. This proposal was rejected by a majority of IWC members. \\\\- Section 5.6 =International Court of Justice (ICJ) proceedings= On 31 May 2010, the Australian Government lodged formal proceedings against Japan in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, Netherlands. In a joint ministerial statement, the government stated that it \\"has not taken this decision lightly.\\" On 5 January 2011, leaked US diplomatic cables revealed that the Australian legal challenge to Japanese whaling was heavily influenced by domestic political pressures and Australian government advisers were left deeply pessimistic about the prospects of success in the International Court. In its reports to Washington, the US Embassy reported that Australian government contacts were stating that the legal proceedings \\"... would be unlikely to stop the whale hunt entirely, but could well force modifications that would make it more difficult for the Japanese\\". The Australian public overwhelmingly supports governmental efforts to stop Japanese whaling, even at risk of losing valuable trade relations. The New Zealand government lodged a \\"Declaration of Intervention\\" with the ICJ on 6 February 2013, in which it deemed Japan as ineligible for a Special Permit that would allow whaling on the basis of scientific research. As a result of the Australian government's 2010 application, a court case was heard at the ICJ. The hearing ran from 26 June 2013 until 6 July 2013. In its deposition to the ICJ, the Australian government has claimed that Japan \\"has breached and is continuing to breach\\" its obligations under the international convention, and further asserted that Japan has refused to accept International Whaling Commission (IWC) recommendations. Solicitor-General of Australia Justin Gleeson appeared for Australia before the ICJ. The ICJ's 16-judge bench received and then decided upon the case. Rothwell stated that the case \\"is a complex one which raises novel legal issues not previously considered by any international court\\". Tony Press, CEO of the Antarctic Climate and Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre at the University of Tasmania, Australia, provided weekly reports of the ICJ hearings for The Conversation Australia media publication. Following the second week, Press relayed that Japan articulated in certain terms its intentions in the Southern Ocean: \\"the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry\\", further explaining that a whale must be killed to obtain certain types of information, such as the collection of ear plugs to estimate the age of a whale. During the second week, Professor Lars Wall√∏e, of the University of Oslo and a former Norwegian Commissioner to the Whaling Commission was presented by Japan as its sole expert witness. During the week beginning 8 July 2013, New Zealand delivered its intervention, in which it provided a history of the origin of the 1946 Whaling Convention and Australian Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus affirmed that his nation had not \\"colluded\\" with New Zealand to launch the ICJ proceedings. Dreyfus concluded Australia's contribution by emphasising the friendship shared by Australia and Japan, and stated: \\"Australia respectfully requests the Court to bring Japan‚Äôs whaling program to an end.\\" The ICJ hearing concluded on 16 July 2013. In Japan's final presentation Professor Payam Akhavan of Harvard University stated: \\"it would not be an exaggeration to say that Australia‚Äôs case now hangs by a thread\\". Outcome On 31 March 2014 the ICJ ruled that Japan's JARPA II whaling program \\"can broadly be characterized as ‚Äúscientific research‚Äù\\" but failed to comply with three provisions of the Schedule to the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The Court ordered that \\"Japan revoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to kill, take or treat whales in relation to JARPA II, and refrain from granting any further permits under Article VIII, paragraph 1, of the Convention, in pursuance of that programme\\". The court's judges agreed with Australia that the number of Japanese scientific research publications were not proportionate to the number of animals killed. Two former Australian Environment ministers applauded the decision and stated their hopes that Japan will respect it. The decision of the ICJ is final and the right of appeal does not apply in this context; Japan said it would abide by the decision.

The Mickey Mouse Club was the first national TV show to star children who appeared primarily as themselves as well as acting as characters in scenes and musical numbers. The original show aired in syndication in the 1960s, reran again in 1975, then on the Disney Channel in the 1980s through the early 2000s. After appearing on the show, Burr's entertainment career included stints as an actor, dancer, singer, choreographer, and his writing career included being a book author, playwright, lyricist, journalist, critic and poet. Throughout adulthood, he continued to honor his Disney experience. As he was quoted in an interview, ‚ÄúWhether I someday scale the Matterhorn or win my Pulitzer, I shall always be known as Mouseketeer Lonnie; that is the way the obituary will begin. I have come to learn that is a marvelous association.‚Äù Early life Burr was born in Dayton, Kentucky. The family moved to Highland Park, California when he was three. From 1st through 12th grade Lonnie attended Hollywood Professional School, a private school for children working in show business. He is of Danish, French, Scots-Irish and German descent. His parents, Howard Ambrose Babin and Dorothy Doloris Burr, were a night club and vaudeville dance team that toured from 1934 to 1941 as \\"Dot and Dash\\". (An African-American team of the same name appeared in the 1935 film Temptation.) Early performances At age four Burr started dance lessons with legendary tap teacher Willie Covan and was soon and was soon dancing, singing and doing imitations for live audiences and local, Pasadena, CA TV shows. He began acting on radio after turning professional at age five. By six (1949) he was working on national television, radio, films, theatre and commercials. His first two movie appearances were in A Yank in Korea and Queen for a Day, followed by M (1951 U.S. remake), Hans Christian Andersen (1952), The Greatest Show on Earth (1952) and Apache (1954). Burr‚Äôs first recurring television role (1950-1951) was as next door neighbor Oliver Quimby on The Ruggles situation comedy starring Charlie Ruggles. He guest starred as Jimmy, title character in \\"The Holy Terror\\" episode of The Range Rider, made ten appearances on The Colgate Comedy Hour, and also appeared on The Roy Rogers Show, The Alan Young Show, All Star Revue, The Donald O'Connor Show, and Father Knows Best. On radio, he was heard on The Enchanted Lady as Buster Beetle, Prince Charming and other characters, the child lead on the popular NBC Radio soap opera Dr. Paul and in 1953 as Tiny Tim in Dickens‚Äô A Christmas Carol on Stars Over Hollywood. For two years in the early 1950s he was also the national radio voice of the enthusiastic boy who loved Chef Boyardee spaghetti(\\"Oh Boy, it's Chef Boy-Ar-DEE !!\\"). After years of radio and voice-over work, Lonnie became the pre-recorded voice of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the 21st century giving visitors general information, opening and closing times and providing safety and emergency instructions. Lonnie's career as a stage actor began at age six at California's renowned Pasadena Playhouse. After appearing in two plays, he performed his first stage lead there at age eight in The Strawberry Circle. His early television commercials included appearing during Space Patrol (1950s series) to eat a bowl of Chex, one of the show's sponsors, and The Lone Ranger, in which he and Clayton Moore (the original television Lone Ranger), both on horseback, promoted the goodness of Cheerios breakfast cereal. (Lonnie dehorsed to enjoy his cereal at the breakfast table.) Mickey Mouse Club In 1955 Lonnie signed a seven-year contract with Walt Disney Studios as one of twenty-four original Mouseketeers hired for the first season of The Mickey Mouse Club from the thousands of children who auditioned. He was made a member of the show's first string unit, the Red Team, and appeared in the show's Roll Call and Alma Mater segments daily for the first two seasons. As one of only four boys, of thirty-nine total kids, who remained under contract for the run of the series, he was a member of the ‚ÄúRed Team‚Äù, the group that comprised the show's first string unit. Lonnie appeared in the show's opening number, ‚ÄúRoll Call‚Äù, and closing number, ‚ÄúAlma Mater‚Äù, segments daily for the first two seasons. Unfortunately, a prominent facial injury during rehearsal kept him off camera for the third season pre- filming of those two numbers, but he was otherwise an active season three Red Team member, continuing to perform in skits and musical variety numbers both solo and with other Mouseketeers. He is generally acknowledged to have been one of the show's three top dancers and his slightly husky singing voice and resemblance to singer Mel Torm√©, nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Velvet Fog\\",caused other Mouseketeers to call Lonnie \\"The Velvet Smog\\". Lonnie appeared in more than 200 episodes of the original The Mickey Mouse Club. The popularity he and other Red Team members enjoyed continued after ABC cancelled the Mickey Mouse Club in 1959. The series reran in the 1960s and 1970s, then continued on the Disney Channel from the 1980s through the early 2000s. The ‚ÄúMice‚Äù, as the adult Mouseketeers often call themselves, continued to acquire new fans; eventually adults who were fans as children watched with their own children and grandchildren. Disney also licensed the shows internationally, and they were aired in five languages in forty-plus foreign countries including Japan, France, Mexico, Australia (twelve years), parts of South America, and in the 1980s and 1990s in Russia (U.S.S.R.) and the other Warsaw Pact countries. Roles as an adult After The Mickey Mouse Club stopped filming in 1958, Lonnie took a hiatus from the entertainment business and at age fourteen he completed his senior year of high school. Accepted at UCLA, he received a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in Theatre Arts by age twenty. He completed a year toward a Ph.D. in English Literature a few years later, but decided to return to his professional careers in the performing arts and his new career as a published author. Burr resumed his performing career in the 1960s in plays, musical comedy, film, television, commercials, industrial films, night clubs and other live performances. He transitioned from child TV star to adult character actor, deliberately taking roles in which he could vary his appearance and attitude to the extent that in the 1980s Robert Osborne, then columnist for The Hollywood Reporter and later TCM host, named him ‚Äúa master of disguises.‚Äù Live theatre is Burr‚Äôs favorite performing medium. His 45 drama, comedy and musical theatre performances include Gower Champion‚Äôs original Broadway production of Mack & Mabel (1974-75) with Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters; two productions of George M (1969), the first National Company with Joel Grey and on his own in a 1983 Las Vegas production; Death of a Salesman (1999) at the Olney Theatre Center; the Ford‚Äôs Theatre (Washington DC) production of The Grapes of Wrath(2005); a second revival of No, No Nanette; The Boys From Syracuse (Goodman Theatre, Chicago ); the premiere of \\"Over The Hill‚Äù, a comedy he also wrote and directed; as the fascist Capitano Aldo Finzi in Tamara, Los Angeles‚Äô longest running play (nine years); and the year-long Los Angeles production of 42nd Street (Shubert Theatre, Los Angeles). In Actors' Equity professional summer stock on both coasts, Lonnie co-starred as Spats Palazzo in Sugar with the late Arte Johnson, Marcellus in The Music Man with Peter Marshall, with Ginger Rogers in Coco, and with Elke Sommer in Irma La Douce. Lonnie‚Äôs live appearances include performances during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s at both Disneyland and Walt Disney World (WDW) in 30-minute stage shows reuniting some of the original Mouseketeers, who performed new numbers and a few recreated from the original series. Lonnie also wrote and choreographed the first of these appearances. As a promotion for the original Mickey Mouse Club‚Äôs return to television in the mid-1970s, Lonnie and other Mouseketeers appeared on Tomorrow, Tom Snyder‚Äôs national late night talk show from New York. Lonnie and three other Mouseketeers also visited Queens to appear at a Shea Stadium New York Mets game with Mickey Mouse, who was scheduled to throw out the first baseball. Instead, Mickey handed the ball to Lonnie, making him the only Mouseketeer to have thrown the opening ball for a Major League Baseball game. Mickey and Lonnie were together again in the 1980s when Disneyland promoted its extensively renovated New Fantasyland via a 10-stop Amtrak trip from California to New Orleans. Lonnie was the Disney spokesperson on local TV talk and news shows, children‚Äôs hospitals, schools, and in public meetings with city mayors and other officials. Lonnie‚Äôs films since his Ph.D. semester include Live a Little, Love a Little (Elvis), Sweet Charity, The Hospital, The Prisoner of Second Avenue, Copacabana,Pink Lightning, Hook, Lionheart, The Silence of the Hams (Italian: 'Il Silenzio dei Prosciutti'), Newsies, Mr. Saturday Night, Illicit Behavior, Police Academy: Mission to Moscow and Lots of Luck with Annette Funicello. While Lonnie and Annette had been in contact during the years after the Mickey Mouse Club, Lots of Luck marked the first and only adult acting appearance by two original Mouseketeers. In fact, Lonnie and Annette had been boyfriend-girlfriend on the first year of the Mickey Mouse Club, and had ‚Äúgone steady‚Äù at a party for a few hours until her father found out and immediately made her give the ring back. But it was not until the 1994 publication of Annette‚Äôs autobiography, A Dream Is A Wish Your Heart Makes that Lonnie discovered that he was the fortunate young man who gave Annette her first kiss! Among Lonnie‚Äôs 67 TV credits are guest roles on The Beverly Hillbillies, Hunter, Hill Street Blues, The New Gidget, Saved By The Bell, a recurring role on Falcon Crest, Murder She Wrote, Chicago Hope, Lois and Clark, L.A. Heat, Homicide: Life on the Streets, and daytime dramas Another World and General Hospital. He has been a guest on more than 100 national and local talk shows from the 1960s into the 21st century promoting the Mickey Mouse Club for Disney and his own books, criticism, poetry and plays. As a writer, Lonnie is the author of a memoir, The Accidental Mouseketeer (2014) and Two for the Show: Great 20th Century Comedy Teams(2000). He has two poetry collections, forty-eight poems published in literary journals and newspapers and is the recipient of 11 poetry awards. He is a playwright with four produced plays (Occam's Razor, Over the Hill, Children Are Strangers and Exeunt All) and a musical (book and lyrics for Fantasies), which have been staged in Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington, DC, plus twenty-two nationally aired radio dramas for Heartbeat Theatre and two for American Radio Theatre. Finally, he is the author of numerous articles, essays, and both film and theatre criticism whose work has appeared in more than twenty national and regional newspapers and magazines including the Los Angeles Times, New York Times Syndicate, American Film, Cincinnati Enquirer, US, Louisville Today, Oui, Hartford Courant, Storyboard and online publications. Burr was one of the hosts and the creative consultant (WGAw, second writer) for the 1980 ABC television special 25 Years of Mouseketeers (aka Mouseketeers 25th Anniversary Special). He was also instrumental in the creation of scripts for the Disneyland live performances by some of the original Mouseketeers throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s. As a choreographer, Burr‚Äôs specialty is creating tap and jazz routines for actors, singers and personalities who are not trained dancers. Examples of his work include live and filmed Disney and Disneyland/WDW productions; his swing dance with Hayley Mills as junior high school teacher Miss Bliss in the ‚ÄúSave The Last Dance for Me‚Äù (2/4/1989) episode of Good Morning, Miss Bliss (series title changed to Saved By The Bell), the original Carl‚Äôs Jr. guacamole burger ‚ÄúFlamenco, Ole!‚Äù commercial, plays and several industrial shows. He has worked with such dance greats as Bob Fosse, Twyla Tharp, Vincent Paterson, Gower Champion, Larry Fuller, Lester Wilson, Kenny Ortega, Joe Layton, Tommy Tune, and Dee Dee Wood (The Sound of Music, Mary Poppins). As an inveterate library and museum patron since the early 1960s, Lonnie recognizes the importance of giving back whenever possible. Items from a number of his areas of interest now belong to Smithsonian National Museum of American History, Skirball Cultural Center, Thousand Oaks Library American Radio Archives (Thousand Oaks, CA), UCLA Film and Television Archive, Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center of Boston University, The Paley Center for Media in New York City (founded 1975 as The Museum of Broadcasting; renamed The Museum of Television and Radio 1991 -2007), Chicago's Museum of Broadcast Communications and The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens (San Marino, CA).

Bush administration's Department of Justice ordered the unprecedented\\"Although Bush and President Bill Clinton each dismissed nearly all U.S. attorneys upon taking office, legal experts and former prosecutors say the firing of a large number of prosecutors in the middle of a term appears to be unprecedented and threatens the independence of prosecutors.\\" Gonzales: 'Mistakes Were Made' The Washington Post, March 14, 2007 midterm dismissal of seven United States Attorneys. Congressional investigations focused on whether the Department of Justice and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage. Allegations were that some of the attorneys were targeted for dismissal to impede investigations of Republican politicians or that some were targeted for their failure to initiate investigations that would damage Democratic politicians or hamper Democratic-leaning voters. The U.S. attorneys were replaced with interim appointees, under provisions in the 2005 USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization. A subsequent report by the Justice Department Inspector General in October 2008 found that the process used to fire the first seven attorneys and two others dismissed around the same time was \\"arbitrary\\", \\"fundamentally flawed\\", and \\"raised doubts about the integrity of Department prosecution decisions\\". In July 2010, the Department of Justice prosecutors closed the two-year investigation without filing charges after determining that the firing was inappropriately political, but not criminal, saying \\"Evidence did not demonstrate that any prosecutable criminal offense was committed with regard to the removal of David Iglesias. The investigative team also determined that the evidence did not warrant expanding the scope of the investigation beyond the removal of Iglesias.\\" Issues in brief By tradition, all U.S. Attorneys are asked to resign at the start of a new administration. The new President may elect to keep or remove any U.S. Attorney. They are traditionally replaced collectively only at the start of a new White House administration. U.S. Attorneys hold a political office, in which the President nominates candidates to office and the Senate confirms, and consequently, they serve at the pleasure of the President. When a new President is from a different political party, typically almost all of the resignations are eventually accepted and the positions are then filled by newly confirmed appointees, typically from the new President's party. Although a political appointee, it is essential to the effectiveness of a U.S Attorney that they are politically impartial in deciding which cases to prosecute and in arguing those cases before judges and juries with diverse views. Some U.S. Senators were concerned about a provision in the 2006 re-authorization of the USA PATRIOT Act that eliminated the 120-day term limit on interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys made by the United States Attorney General to fill vacancies. The revised USA PATRIOT ACT permitted the Attorney General to appoint interim U.S. Attorneys without a term limit in office, and avoid a confirming vote by the Senate. The change in the law undermined the confirmation authority of the Senate and gave the Attorney General greater appointment powers than the President, since the President's U.S. Attorney appointees are required to be confirmed by the Senate and those of the Attorney General did not require confirmation. The Senate was concerned that in dismissing the seven U.S. Attorneys which had been confirmed, the administration planned to fill the vacancies with its own choices, bypassing Senate confirmation and the traditional consultation with Senators in the selection process. Congress rescinded this provision on June 14, 2007, and President Bush promptly signed the bill into law. =Administration rationale unclear= The reasons for the dismissal of each individual U.S. Attorney were unclear. Two suggested motivations were that the administration wanted to make room for U.S. Attorneys who would be more sympathetic to the administration's political agenda, and the administration wanted to advance the careers of promising conservatives. Critics said that the attorneys were fired for failing to prosecute Democratic politicians, for failing to prosecute claims of election fraud that would hamper Democratic voter registration, as retribution for prosecuting Republican politicians, or for failing to pursue adult obscenity prosecutions. The administration and its supporters said that the attorneys were dismissed for job-performance reasons \\"related to policy, priorities and management\\", and that U.S. Attorneys serve at the pleasure of the President. However, at least six attorneys had recently received positive evaluations of their performance from the Department of Justice. In September 2008, the Department of Justice Inspector General's investigation concluded that the dismissals were politically motivated and improper. The Bush administration issued changing and contradictory statements about the timeline of the planning of the firings, persons who ordered the firings, and reasons for the firings. The origin and evolution of the list of attorneys to be dismissed remained unclear. In response the Inspector General's report in September 2008, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed Acting United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut, Nora Dannehy as special prosecutor to determine if administration officials had perjured themselves in testimony to Congress. Her investigation concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone with perjury. =Politicization of hiring at the Department of Justice= Attorney General Gonzales, in a confidential memorandum dated March 1, 2006, delegated authority to senior DOJ staff Monica Goodling and Kyle Sampson to hire and dismiss political appointees and some civil service positions. On May 2, 2007, the Department of Justice announced two separate investigations into hirings conducted by Goodling: one by the department's Inspector General, and a second by the Office of Professional Responsibility. In testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, on May 23, 2007, Goodling stated that she had \\"crossed the line\\" and broken civil service laws regulating hiring for civil service positions, and had improperly weighed political factors in assessing applicants. According to a January 2009 Justice Department report, investigators found that Bradley Schlozman, as interim head of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice, \\"favored applicants with conservative political or ideological affiliations and disfavored applicants with civil rights or human rights experience whom he considered to be overly liberal\\". The positions under consideration were not political, but career, for which the political and ideological views of candidates are not to be considered, according to federal law and guidelines. In a letter of May 30, 2007, to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General and Counsel for the Office of Professional Responsibility confirmed that they were expanding their investigation beyond \\"the removals of United States Attorneys\\" to include \\"DOJ hiring and personnel decisions\\" by Monica Goodling and other Justice Department employees. =Dismissed attorneys and elections= The controversy surrounding the U.S. Attorneys dismissals was often linked to elections or voter-fraud issues. Allegations were that some of the U.S. Attorneys were dismissed for failing to instigate investigations damaging to Democratic politicians, or for failing to more aggressively pursue voter-fraud cases. Such allegations were made by some of the dismissed U.S. Attorneys themselves to suggest reasons they may have been dismissed. The background to the allegations is the recent tendency for elections in parts of the United States to be very close; an election outcome can be affected by an announced investigation of a politician. It is explicit policy of the Department of Justice to avoid bringing voter-related cases during an election for this reason. In September 2008, the Inspector General for the Department of Justice concluded that some of the dismissals were motivated by the refusal of some of the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute voter fraud cases during the 2006 election cycle. Fallout By April 2007, there was some speculation that the dismissal of the US attorneys might affect cases of public corruption and voter fraud. According to the National Law Journal, > Just the appearance of political influence in cases related to those > firings, combined with the recent, unusual reversal of a federal public > corruption conviction in Wisconsin [c.f., Georgia Thompson], some say, will > spur aggressive defense lawyers to question the political motivation of > prosecutors in certain cases; make magistrates and judges more skeptical of > the evidence before them; and perhaps even chill line prosecutors in their > pursuit of some indictments. By mid-September 2007, nine senior staff of the Department of Justice associated with the controversy had resigned. The most prominent resignations include: Alberto Gonzales :* Attorney General Alberto Gonzales :* Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty; :* Acting Associate Attorney General William W. Mercer resigned from the acting office prior to Senate confirmation hearings for the same position, and returned to his post as U.S. Attorney for Montana (he held dual positions); :* Chief of staff for the Attorney General Kyle Sampson :* Chief of Staff for the Deputy Attorney General Michael Elston; :* Director of the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) Michael A. Battle; :* the subsequently appointed Director to the EOUSA, Bradley Schlozman, also the former acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division; :* the Department of Justice's White House Liaison Monica Goodling In June 2008, a grand jury was empaneled to consider criminal indictments against officials involved in the firings. The grand jury was presented evidence from ongoing investigations at the Department of Justice Inspector General's office and at the DOJ's Office of Professional Responsibility. =Inspector General Report and Special Prosecutor= On September 29, 2008 the Justice Department's Inspector General (IG) released a report on the matter that found most of the firings were politically motivated and improper. The next day Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor Nora Dannehy to decide whether criminal charges should be brought against Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings. The IG's report contained \\"substantial evidence\\" that party politics drove a number of the firings, and IG Glenn Fine said in a statement that Gonzales had \\"abdicated his responsibility to safeguard the integrity and independence of the department.\\" The report itself stopped short of resolving questions about higher White House involvement in the matter, because of what it said were the refusal to cooperate of a number of key players, among them Karl Rove, Senator Pete Domenici and Harriet Miers and because the White House refused to hand over its documents related to the firings. On July 21, 2010, Dannehy concluded that \\"there was insufficient evidence to establish that persons knowingly made material false statements to [the Office of Inspector General] or Congress or corruptly endeavored to obstruct justice\\" and that no criminal charges would be filed against Sampson or Gonzales. Replacement of the U.S. Attorneys Harriet Miers Karl Rove =Initial planning= On January 6, 2005, Colin Newman, an assistant in the White House counsels office, wrote to David Leitch stating, \\"Karl Rove stopped by to ask you (roughly quoting) 'how we planned to proceed regarding U.S. Attorneys, whether we were going to allow all to stay, request resignations from all and accept only some of them or selectively replace them, etc.'\\". The email was then forwarded to Kyle Sampson, chief of staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. In reply, Kyle Sampson, then Department of Justice counsel to Attorney General John Ashcroft, wrote that it would be \\"weird to ask them to leave before completing at least a 4-year term\\", that they \\"would like to replace 15‚Äì20 percent of the current U.S. Attorneys\\" and that the rest \\"are doing a great job, are loyal Bushies, etc.\\" In March 2005, Sampson ... > came up with a checklist. He rated each of the U.S. Attorneys with criteria > that appeared to value political allegiance as much as job performance. He > recommended retaining 'strong U.S. Attorneys who have ... exhibited loyalty > to the President and Attorney General.' He suggested 'removing weak U.S. > Attorneys who have ... chafed against Administration initiatives'. Sampson wrote in January 2006 to Miers that he recommended that the Department of Justice and the Office of the Counsel to the President work together to seek the replacement of a limited number of U.S. Attorneys, and that by limiting the number of attorneys \\"targeted for removal and replacement\\" it would \\"mitigat[e] the shock to the system that would result from an across- the-board firing\\". On February 12, 2006, Monica Goodling sent a spreadsheet of each U.S. Attorney's political activities and memberships in conservative political groups, in an email to senior Administration officials, with the comment \\"This is the chart that the AG requested\\". Sampson strongly urged using changes to the law governing U.S. Attorney appointments to bypass Congressional confirmation, writing in a September 17, 2006 memo to Harriet Miers: > I am only in favor of executing on a plan to push some USAs out if we really > are ready and willing to put in the time necessary to select candidates and > get them appointed ... It will be counterproductive to DOJ operations if we > push USAs out and then don't have replacements ready to roll immediately ... > I strongly recommend that as a matter of administration, we utilize the new > statutory provisions that authorize the AG to make USA appointments ... [By > avoiding Senate confirmation] we can give far less deference to home state > senators and thereby get 1.) our preferred person appointed and 2.) do it > far faster and more efficiently at less political costs to the White House. =Implementation: The U.S. Attorney Removal List= In October 2006, George W. Bush told Alberto Gonzales that he had received complaints that some of the U.S. Attorneys had not pursued certain voter-fraud investigations. The complaints came from Republican officials, who demanded fraud investigations into a number of Democratic campaigns. According to Newsweek, \\"Kyle Sampson, Gonzales's chief of staff, developed the list of eight prosecutors to be fired last October‚Äîwith input from the White House\\". On November 27, 2006, Gonzales met with senior advisers to discuss the plan. The Justice Department did not receive White House approval for the firings until early December. As late as December 2, Sampson had written to Michael Elston that the Justice department was \\"[s]till waiting for green light from White House\\" with regards to the firing. Deputy White House counsel William K. Kelley responded on December 4, 2006, saying, \\"We're a go for the U.S. Atty plan ... [the White House office of legislative affairs], political, communications have signed off and acknowledged that we have to be committed to following through once the pressure comes.\\" On December 7, 2006, Justice Department official Michael A. Battle informed seven U.S. Attorneys that they were being dismissed. Although seven attorneys were dismissed on December 7, 2006, subsequent disclosures show that three or more additional attorneys were dismissed under similar circumstances between 2005 and 2006. U.S. Attorney Bud Cummins in Arkansas had been informed in June 2006 that he was to be replaced, and he resigned, effective December 20, 2006, several days after the public announcement of the appointment of his successor Timothy Griffin.

In September 2006, it became clear that Charlton had launched an investigation of Rep. Rick Renzi, R-Ariz, over a land-swap deal. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales's chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, subsequently included Charlton on a list of U.S. attorneys \\"we now should consider pushing out.\\" Sampson made the comment in a Sept. 13, 2006, letter to then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Carol Lam (R) U.S. Attorney for California, oversaw the investigation and conviction of Rep. Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham (R-CA) for corruption in military contracting. Congressman Darrell Issa complained (falsely) that Lam was not prosecuting illegal border crossings aggressively enough. On December 7, 2006, Michael A. Battle, Director of the Executive Office for US Attorneys, called Lam and notified her that she must resign no later than January 31, 2007. Battle instructed Lam to explain that she had decided to pursue other opportunities. Battle insisted that Lam had to depart in weeks, not months, and these orders were \\"coming from the very highest levels of government\\". Lam submitted her resignation January 16, 2007, effective February 15.

The department was pushing for a lawsuit against Missouri, accusing the state of failing to eliminate ineligible people from voter rolls.

The White House role in the dismissals remained unclear despite hours of testimony by Attorney General Gonzales and senior Department of Justice staff in congressional committee hearings. Reactions and congressional investigation =Initial reaction= The initial reaction was from the senators of the affected states. In a letter to Gonzales on January 9, 2007, Senators Feinstein (D, California) and Leahy (D, Vermont; Chair of the Committee) of the Senate Judiciary Committee expressed concern that the confirmation process for U.S. attorneys would be bypassed, and on January 11, they, together with Senator Pryor (D, Arkansas), introduced legislation \\"to prevent circumvention of the Senate's constitutional prerogative to confirm U.S. Attorneys\\", called Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act of 2007, and . Senators Feinstein, Leahy, Pryor to Fight Administration‚Äôs Effort to Circumvent Senate Confirmation Process for U.S. Attorneys (Press Release). Office of Senator Dianne Feinstein. January 11, 2007. Retrieved January 7, 2014. The initial concern was about the USA PATRIOT Act and the confirmation process, rather than the politicization of the U.S. Attorneys. Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 18. He assured the committee that he did not intend to bypass the confirmation process and denied the firings were politically motivated. The concerns expressed by Senators Feinstein and Pryor were followed up by hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee called by Senator Schumer (D, New York) in February.Notice of Rescheduled Committee Hearing, Tuesday, February 6, 2007 at 9:30 a.m Hearing on \\"Preserving Prosecutorial Independence: Is the Department of Justice Politicizing the Hiring and Firing of U.S. Attorneys?\\" United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary January 30, 2007. Retrieved April 16, 2007. Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 6. He said that the seven were fired for job performance issues and not political considerations; these statements lead several of the dismissed attorneys, who had been previously silent, to come forward with questions about their dismissals, partially because their performance reviews prior to their dismissal had been highly favorable. In subsequent closed-door testimony on April 27, 2007 to the committee, McNulty said that days after the February hearing, he learned that White House officials had not revealed to him White House influence and discussions on creating the list. McNulty in February called Senator Schumer by telephone to apologize for the inaccurate characterization of the firings. McNulty testified that Bud Cummins, the U.S. Attorney for Arkansas, was removed to install a former aide to Karl Rove and Republican National Committee opposition research director, Timothy Griffin. Cummins, apparently, \\"was ousted after Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel, intervened on behalf of Griffin\\". McNulty's testimony that the attorneys were fired for \\"performance related issues\\" caused the attorneys to come forward in protest. There is some evidence that the administration was concerned about the attorneys' going public with complaints prior to this time. Salon.com reported: \\"[A]t least three of the eight fired attorneys were told by a superior they were being forced to resign to make jobs available for other Bush appointees, according to a former senior Justice Department official knowledgeable about their cases.\\" =Further investigation and resignations= Battle resignation On March 5, 2007 effective March 16, Michael A. Battle resigned his position of Director of the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (EOUSA). On March 6, 2007, Gonzales responded to the controversy in an op-ed in USA Today in which he wrote: > To be clear, [the firing] was for reasons related to policy, priorities and > management ‚Äî what have been referred to broadly as \\"performance-related\\" > reasons ‚Äî that seven U.S. attorneys were asked to resign last December ... > We have never asked a U.S. attorney to resign in an effort to retaliate > against him or her or to inappropriately interfere with a public corruption > case (or any other type of case, for that matter). Like me, U.S. attorneys > are political appointees, and we all serve at the pleasure of the president. > If U.S. attorneys are not executing their responsibilities in a manner that > furthers the management and policy goals of departmental leadership, it is > appropriate that they be replaced ... While I am grateful for the public > service of these seven U.S. attorneys, they simply lost my confidence. I > hope that this episode ultimately will be recognized for what it is: an > overblown personnel matter. Sampson resignation On March 12, 2007, Sampson resigned from the Department of Justice. On March 13, Gonzales stated in a news conference that he accepted responsibility for mistakes made in the dismissal and rejected calls for his resignation that Democratic members of Congress had been making. He also stood by his decision to dismiss the attorneys, saying \\"I stand by the decision and I think it was the right decision\\". Gonzales admitted that \\"incomplete information was communicated or may have been communicated to Congress\\" by Justice Department officials, and said that \\"I never saw documents. We never had a discussion about where things stood.\\" Gonzales lost more support when records subsequently challenged some of these statements. Although the Department of Justice released 3,000 pages of its internal communications related to this issue, none of those documents discussed anything related to a performance review process for these attorneys before they were fired. Records released on March 23 showed that on his November 27 schedule \\"he attended an hour-long meeting at which, aides said, he approved a detailed plan for executing the purge\\". Executive Privilege claims Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy stated that Congress has the authority to subpoena Justice Department and White House officials including chief political advisor to the president Karl Rove and former White House counsel Harriet Miers. On March 20, President Bush declared in a press conference that his aides would not testify under oath on the matter if subpoenaed by Congress. Bush explained his position saying, > The President relies upon his staff to provide him candid advice. The > framers of the Constitution understood this vital role when developing the > separate branches of government. And if the staff of a President operated in > constant fear of being hauled before various committees to discuss internal > deliberations, the President would not receive candid advice, and the > American people would be ill-served ... I will oppose any attempts to > subpoena White House officials ... My choice is to make sure that I > safeguard the ability for Presidents to get good decisions. Despite the President's position against aides testifying, on March 21 the House Judiciary Committee authorized the subpoena of five Justice Department officials, and on March 22, the Senate Judiciary Committee authorized subpoenas as well. Goodling resignation Sampson's replacement as the Attorney General's temporary chief of staff was U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, Chuck Rosenberg. Rosenberg initiated a DOJ inquiry into possibly inappropriate political considerations in Monica Goodling's hiring practices for civil service staff. Civil service positions are not political appointments and must be made on a nonpartisan basis. In one example, Jeffrey A. Taylor, former interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, tried to hire a new career prosecutor, Seth Adam Meinero, in the fall of 2006. Goodling judged Meinero too \\"liberal\\" and declined to approve the hire. Meinero, a Howard University law school graduate who had worked on civil rights cases at the Environmental Protection Agency, was serving as a special assistant prosecutor in Taylor's office. Taylor went around Goodling, and demanded Sampson's approval to make the hire. In another example, Goodling removed an attorney from her job at the Department of Justice because she was rumored to be a lesbian, and, further, blocked the attorney from getting other Justice Department jobs she was qualified for. Rules concerning hiring at the Justice department forbid discrimination based on sexual orientation. On March 26, 2007, Goodling, who had helped coordinate the dismissal of the attorneys with the White House, took leave from her job as counsel to the attorney general and as the Justice Department's liaison to the White House. Goodling was set to testify before Congress, but on March 26, 2007, she cancelled her appearance at the Congressional hearing, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. On April 6, 2007, Goodling resigned from the Department of Justice. On April 25, 2007, the House Judiciary Committee passed a resolution, by a 32‚Äì6 vote, authorizing lawyers for the House to apply for a court order granting Goodling immunity in exchange for her testimony and authorizing a subpoena for her.Gonzales aide gets immunity On May 11, 2007, U.S. District Court Chief Judge Thomas Hogan signed an order granting Goodling immunity in exchange for her truthful testimony in the U.S. Attorney firings investigation, stating that \\"Goodling may not refuse to testify, and may not refuse to provide other information, when compelled to do so\\" before the Committee. Gonzales resignation A number of members of both houses of Congress publicly said Gonzales should resign, or be fired by Bush. On March 14, 2007, Senator John E. Sununu (R, New Hampshire) became the first Republican lawmaker to call for Gonzales' resignation. Sununu cited not only the controversial firings but growing concern over the use of the USA PATRIOT Act and misuse of national security letters by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Calls for his ousting intensified after his testimony on April 19, 2007. By May 16, at least twenty-two Senators and seven Members of the House of Representatives ‚Äî including Senators Hillary Clinton (D, New York) and Mark Pryor (D, Arkansas)‚Äî had called for Gonzales' resignation. Gonzales submitted his resignation as Attorney General effective September 17, 2007, by a letter addressed to President Bush on August 26, 2007. In a statement on August 27, Gonzales thanked the President for the opportunity to be of service to his country, giving no indication of either the reasons for his resignation or his future plans. Later that day, President Bush praised Gonzales for his service, reciting the numerous positions in Texas government, and later, the government of the United States, to which Bush had appointed Gonzales. On September 17, 2007, President Bush announced the nomination of ex-Judge Michael Mukasey to serve as Gonzales' successor. Testimony of Sara Taylor: Claims of executive privilege On July 11, 2007, Sara Taylor, former top aide to Karl Rove, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Throughout Taylor's testimony, she refused to answer many questions, saying \\"I have a very clear letter from [White House counsel] Mr. [Fred] Fielding. That letter says and has asked me to follow the president's assertion of executive privilege.\\" Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) dismissed the claims and warned Taylor she was \\"in danger of drawing a criminal contempt of Congress citation\\". Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) took issue with the claim as well, telling Taylor In summary, Taylor told the Senate that she > \\"did not talk to or meet with President Bush about removing federal > prosecutors before eight of them were fired\\", she had no knowledge on > whether Bush was involved in any way in the firings, her resignation had > nothing to do with the controversy, \\"she did not recall ordering the > addition or deletion of names to the list of prosecutors to be fired\\", and > she refuted the testimony of Kyle Sampson, Attorney General Alberto > Gonzales' chief of staff, that she sought \\"to avoid submitting a new > prosecutor, Tim Griffin, through Senate confirmation.\\" =Contempt of Congress charges= On July 11, 2007, as Sara Taylor testified, George Manning, the attorney to former White House Counsel Harriet Miers, announced that Miers intended to follow the request of the Bush Administration and not appear before the Committee the following day. Manning stated Miers \\"cannot provide the documents and testimony that the committee seeks.\\" In response to the announcement, Committee Chairman John Conyers (D-MI) and Rep. Linda S√°nchez (D-CA) Chair of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, released a letter saying the decision \\"could subject Ms. Miers to contempt proceedings.\\" Conyers wrote > I am extremely disappointed in the White House's direction to Ms. Miers that > she not even show up to assert the privilege before the Committee. We > understand that the White House has asserted privilege over both her > testimony and documents, and we are prepared to consider those claims at > tomorrow's hearing. S√°nchez wrote > \\"It is disappointing that Ms. Miers has chosen to forego this opportunity to > give her account of the potential politicization of the justice system.\\", > S√°nchez added \\"Our investigation has shown ‚Äì through extensive interviews > and review of documents ‚Äì that Ms. Miers played a central role in the Bush > Administration's decision to fire chief federal prosecutors. I am hopeful > that Ms. Miers will reconsider the White House's questionable assertion of > executive privilege and give her testimony on the firing of U.S. Attorneys.\\" On July 17, 2007 Sanchez and Conyers notified White House Counsel Fred Fielding that they were considering the executive privilege claims concerning a \\"subpoena issued on June 13 to Joshua Bolten, White House Chief of Staff, to produce documents.\\" They warned, \\"If those objections are overruled, you should be aware that the refusal to produce the documents called for in the subpoena could subject Mr. Bolten to contempt proceedings\\". The panel ruled the claims of privilege as invalid on a party-line vote of 7‚Äì3. The White House had consistently refused to provide the sought documents but \\"offered to permit former and current aides to talk with lawmakers behind closed doors‚Äîbut without a transcript and not under oath.\\" This offer had been rejected by the Democratic Leadership in the House as unacceptable. On July 25, 2007 the United States House Committee on the Judiciary voted along party lines 22-17 to issue citations of Contempt of Congress to White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Committee Republicans voted against the measure, calling it \\"a partisan waste of time\\", while Democrats said \\"this is the moment for Congress to rein in the administration.\\" White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said of the action, > For our view, this is pathetic. What you have right now is partisanship on > Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults, insinuations, > inquisitions and investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of > trying to pass major pieces of legislation ... now we have a situation where > there is an attempt to do something that's never been done in American > history, which is to assail the concept of executive privilege, which hails > back to the administration of George Washington\\".

The committee has never been given a > privilege log, and there is no indication the president was ever personally > involved in the termination decisions. Having passed the Committee, the motion went to the full House, where it was unlikely to receive a vote until after Congress's August recess. If the measure passed the full House, the case would be given to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. \\"The administration has said it will direct federal prosecutors not to prosecute contempt charges.\\" On February 14, 2008, the United States House of Representatives voted 223‚Äì32 along party lines to pass the contempt resolutions against White House Chief of Staff Bolten and former White House Counsel Miers.Original text of the Letter from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Attorney General Michael Mukasey informing him of the contempt resolution passing the House Most Republicans staged a walkout during the vote. Aftermath =Subpoenas and lost emails= White House spokesman Scott Stanzel stated that some of the emails that had involved official correspondence relating to the firing of attorneys may have been lost because they were conducted on Republican party accounts and not stored properly. \\"Some official e-mails have potentially been lost and that is a mistake the White House is aggressively working to correct.\\" said Stanzel, a White House spokesman. Stonzel said that they could not rule out the possibility that some of the lost emails dealt with the firing of U.S. attorneys. For example, J. Scott Jennings, an aide to Karl Rove communicated with Justice Department officials \\"concerning the appointment of Tim Griffin, a former Rove aide, as U.S. attorney in Little Rock, according to e-mails released in March, 2007. For that exchange, Jennings, although working at the White House, used an e-mail account registered to the Republican National Committee, where Griffin had worked as a political opposition researcher.\\" CNN reported a larger question concerning the lost e-mails: \\"Whether White House officials such as political adviser Karl Rove are intentionally conducting sensitive official presidential business via non-governmental accounts to evade a law requiring preservation‚Äîand eventual disclosure‚Äîof presidential records.\\" On May 2, 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to Attorney General Gonzales compelling the Department of Justice to produce all email from Karl Rove regarding evaluation and dismissal of attorneys that was sent to DOJ staffers, no matter what email account Rove may have used, whether White House, National Republican party, or other accounts, with a deadline of May 15, 2007, for compliance. The subpoena also demanded relevant email previously produced in the Valerie Plame controversy and investigation for the 2003 CIA leak scandal. Lahey, Patrick Rove Email Subpoena United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary' (via Findlaw) May 2, 2007. Retrieved May 8, 2007. In August 2007, Karl Rove resigned without responding to the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena claiming, \\"I just think it's time to leave.\\" =Appointment of U.S. Attorneys and the 2005 Patriot Act reauthorization= The President of the United States has the authority to appoint U.S. Attorneys, with the consent of the United States Senate, and the President may remove U.S. Attorneys from office. In the event of a vacancy, the United States Attorney General is authorized to appoint an interim U.S. Attorney. Before March 9, 2006, such interim appointments expired after 120 days, if a Presidential appointment had not been approved by the Senate. Vacancies that persisted beyond 120 days were filled through interim appointments made by the Federal District Court for the district of the vacant office. (U.S. Code prior to amendments of the USA PATRIOT Act, as of the retrieval date March 15, 2007.) The USA PATRIOT Act Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, signed into law March 9, 2006, amended the law for the interim appointment of U.S. Attorneys by deleting two provisions: (a) the 120-day maximum term for the Attorney General's interim appointees, and (b) the subsequent interim appointment authority of Federal District Courts. With the revision, an interim appointee can potentially serve indefinitely (though still removable by the President), if the President declines to nominate a U.S. Attorney for a vacancy, or the Senate either fails to act on a Presidential nomination, or rejects a nominee that is different than the interim appointee. On June 14, 2007, President Bush signed a bill into law that re-instated the 120-day term limit on interim attorneys appointed by the Attorney General.

It is the sequel to the 1971 film, Billy Jack, and the third film overall in the series. Directed by Laughlin, it has a running time of nearly three hours. Although commercially successful, it was panned by critics. The film was included as one of the choices in the book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. Plot Billy Jack (Tom Laughlin) goes to court facing an involuntary manslaughter charge stemming from events in the earlier film. He is found guilty and sentenced to a prison term. Meanwhile, the kids at the Freedom School‚Äîan experimental school for runaways and troubled youth on a Native American reservation in Arizona‚Äîvow to rebuild the school. They raise funds and acquire a new building, eventually starting their own newspaper and television station. Inspired by Nader's Raiders, they begin using the newspaper and TV station to conduct investigative reporting, angering several politicians and townspeople in the process with their expos√©s. The school's activities range from having their own search and rescue team, to artistic endeavors such as a marching band and belly dancing. This culminates with the school hosting a large marching band contest and arts festival, which they call \\"1984 is Closer Than You Think\\", to raise money for the school. Midway through the film, Billy Jack is released from prison and, trying to reconnect with his spiritual beliefs, begins a series of lengthy vision quests. He gets involved in a radical group on the reservation which is trying to oppose the federal de-recognition of their tribe and the turning of their tribal lands over to local developers. When one of the tribal members is arrested for poaching deer on what was formerly tribal land, the school comes to his defense. The school begins to hold hearings on Native rights and child abuse. One of the children at the school was abused by his father who cut off his hand in a fit of rage, and the school defies a court order to turn the boy back over to his father. The FBI begins visiting the school and taps their phones. As tensions mount between the school and the people in the nearby town, a mysterious explosion at the school knocks their television station off the air. The governor calls a state of emergency and mobilizes the National Guard, and a curfew is established in town. The students respond by holding a parade in the town in violation of the curfew. On the way back to the school their bus breaks down and local townspeople confront the students and threaten to set their bus on fire. Billy Jack shows up during the incident to protect the students, and then comes to the rescue of a tribal member who is being harassed and beaten at a local dance in town. Near the end of the film, the National Guard is stationed around the school and is ordered to open fire on the students, killing four and wounding hundreds more. The entire story is told in flashbacks by Jean Roberts (Delores Taylor, Laughlin's real-life wife), a teacher at the school, from her hospital bed after the shooting incident. The violence in the finale is a symbolic bookend to the massacre of Vietnamese civilians seen in the beginning of the film. During Billy's trial, he mentions the 1968 My Lai massacre and recalls, in a flashback scene, witnessing a similar incident while serving in Vietnam.

Reception =Box office= According to Variety by 1976 the film had earned $6,716,000 in theatrical rentals in North America.\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976, pg 44. Its international take was very small, which Laughlin suggested was due to U.S. government agencies conspiring to get the film \\"banned in almost every country in the world\\" to hide its \\"scorching expos√©s\\" from foreign audiences, though he indicated he had no evidence.Medved and Dreyfuss, p. 260. =Critical= The film was a commercial success upon its release in theaters, but met with a harsh reaction from movie critics. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"three hours of naivet√© merchandised and marketed with the not-so-innocent vengeance that I associate with religious movements that take leases on places like the Houston Astrodome.\\" Variety wrote that the film was \\"badly in need of trimming its 170-minutes running time\\" and that Laughlin sometimes seemed to be \\"only a visiting guest star, since he does not figure in what seems to be reels of irrelevant school action. It is only when he is on-camera that the picture picks up, a commanding figure whose low-key characterization adds to the brilliance of his performance.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The Trial Of Billy Jack\\". Variety. November 13, 1974. 18. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1 star out of 4 and called it \\"gross, misleading and a run-on bore,\\" writing that \\"whereas the original had moments of genuine humor and refreshing improvisation, 'The Trial of Billy Jack' comes on as totally committed to establishing half-truths. In reality, both My Lai and Kent State are testaments to the danger of arming young men and placing them in combat situations. But 'The Trial of Billy Jack' twists those facts so as to make the killings a direct policy statement of the national government.\\"Siskel, Gene (November 25, 1974). \\"Trial of Billy Jack\\".

Based on the 1905 play by Baroness Orczy and Montagu Barstow and the classic 1908 adventure novel by Baroness Orczy, the film is about an eighteenth-century English aristocrat who leads a double life, appearing as an effete aristocrat while engaged in an underground effort to free French nobles from Robespierre's Reign of Terror. The film was produced by Alexander Korda. Plot In 1792, at the bloody height of the French Revolution's Reign of Terror, vengeful French mobs are outraged when again and again French aristocrats are saved from death by the audacious \\"Band of the Scarlet Pimpernel\\", a secret society of 20 English noblemen, \\"one to command, and nineteen to obey\\". Among the latest scheduled for execution are the Count de Tournay, former ambassador to Great Britain, and his family. However, one of the Scarlet Pimpernel's men visits them in prison disguised as a priest and gives them a message of hope. As the prisoners are being escorted to the cart to be taken to the guillotine, the guards take the count away; French leader Maximilien Robespierre wishes to question him further. The countess and her daughter are rescued and spirited away to England. Back in Paris, Robespierre meets with Chauvelin, the republic's new ambassador to Britain, to discuss the problem of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Summoning the Count de Tournay, they offer him his life in return for information from his English contacts as to the Pimpernel's true identity. The Scarlet Pimpernel is Sir Percy Blakeney, a wealthy English baronet and friend of the Prince of Wales. Sir Percy cultivates the image of a fop in order to throw off suspicion. His pose is so successful that not even his French wife Marguerite suspects the truth. Though the two are in love, Sir Percy no longer trusts his wife because of her past denunciation of the Marquis de St. Cyr, which led to the execution of the marquis and his family. Through his network of spies, Chauvelin discovers that Armand St. Just, Marguerite's brother, is one of the Scarlet Pimpernel's agents. Chauvelin orders Armand's arrest, then uses the threat of his execution to force Marguerite into helping him discover the identity of the Pimpernel, who he knows will be at an upcoming ball. At the ball, Marguerite intercepts a message given to Sir Andrew Ffoulkes, a member of the Pimpernel's band, stating that the Pimpernel will be in the library at midnight. She passes the information along to Chauvelin, who goes to the library to find only Percy, apparently asleep. While waiting, Chauvelin falls asleep; when he wakes up, he finds a message from the Pimpernel mocking him. The next morning, Percy and Marguerite travel to their house in the country. There, Marguerite breaks down and tells her husband of Armand's arrest and her deal with Chauvelin. Confronting her, Percy learns the truth behind the denunciation of the marquis; he had her imprisoned for consorting with his son. After the revolution freed her, she told her friend Chauvelin, who was the one who denounced them. Promising to use his influence at court on Armand's behalf, Percy leaves for London. Afterward, Marguerite notices a detail on a portrait of the 1st baronet hanging in the library ‚Äì on his finger is a ring decorated by a pimpernel. Realizing that she has inadvertently betrayed her own husband, she rushes out of the room, only to be presented a letter from Chauvelin announcing that he had discovered the Pimpernel's true identity as well. Racing back to London, she warns Ffoulkes that Percy's life is in danger. Ffoulkes agrees to mobilise the band to warn Percy. To lure Percy into his trap, Chauvelin has both Armand and the Count de Tournay transferred to Boulogne-sur-Mer. Despite the vigilance of Chauvelin's men, the Pimpernel frees the two men from prison through bribery. However, one of the prison guards tells Chauvelin that the Pimpernel will be at a certain tavern (the Lion d'Or) that evening. Marguerite goes there to warn Percy, only to be arrested by Chauvelin and his troops. Percy arrives at the appointed time and is met by a gloating Chauvelin. Percy distracts him long enough for Armand and the count to board the ship, but as he prepares to leave, Chauvelin announces that he has Marguerite in custody. Percy surrenders on the condition that she be freed. He is led away by soldiers to be shot by a waiting firing squad. Chauvelin exults at the sound of gunfire, but Percy returns to the tavern very much alive, revealing that the men in uniform are in fact his. After securing Chauvelin in the basement, Percy joins his wife on the ship back to England.

When the announcement went out to the press, the reaction from the Pimpernel's many fans was negative; the pug-nosed Laughton was thought inappropriate to play the suave Sir Percy. Korda thus gave the role to Leslie Howard, with Merle Oberon as Marguerite. Howard set the standard with his portrayal of Sir Percy Blakeney.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning Markab was built as the cargo ship Mormacpenn by Ingalls Shipbuilding Company of Pascagoula, Mississippi and launched 21 December 1940. A ship named Mormacpenn launched the previous year had been acquired by the Navy to become the . The later Mormacpenn, sponsored at launch by the wife of the General Counsel of the Maritime Commission, Mrs. Carl F. Farbach, was intended for service on the South American routes of the American Republics Line. The ship was acquired by the United States Navy on 2 June 1941 before any commercial service at Charleston, South Carolina; and commissioned as USS Markab (AK 31) on 15 June 1941 with Commander Allen D. Brown in command. Service history =World War II= Cargo ship, 1941‚Äì1942 Markab operated with Atlantic amphibious forces in the Hampton Roads area until 1 October 1941. She then loaded cargo at Jersey City, New Jersey for delivery to American troops recently stationed in Greenland. Returning to Brooklyn, New York on 21 November, she took on board supplies for distribution to various bases in the Caribbean. World War II engulfed the United States before Markab steamed into Ensenada Honda, Puerto Rico, her first port of call. The new wartime demands on the Navy caused this voyage to terminate at Mobile, Alabama on 8 January 1942 where she was converted to a destroyer tender. Sixteen days later she was redesignated AD-21, but it was 27 September before Commander Brown again commanded a fully commissioned vessel. Destroyer tender, 1942‚Äì1947 After shakedown Markab transited the Panama Canal on 27 October to join Destroyer Force, Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor. Ships recently returned from the battle for the Solomon Islands made use of her facilities for three months prior to her departure on 6 February 1943 to service the North Pacific Force. In the year she remained in the Aleutians, she rendered noteworthy service in helping to prepare vessels for both the Attu and Kiska invasions. Steaming to San Francisco late in January, 1944 the ship prepared for an even more extensive Pacific tour. She departed the West Coast on 26 February and worked her way toward the war zone. As a part of Service Squadron 10, Markab overhauled, repaired, and replenished destroyers and destroyer escorts at Pearl Harbor, Majuro, and Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands, and Ulithi in the Carolines. Having assisted in preparing and sustaining the ships fighting in the bloody conquests of the Marianas and Iwo Jima, she sailed for the Philippines on 16 February 1945. Her work force now overhauled and readied landing craft for the assault on Okinawa. During June she played an important part in preparing TF 38 for the last great raids on Japan. Following the Japanese surrender, Markab refitted and restocked ships bound for the occupation areas of Japan, Korea, and China. Steaming in their wake, she arrived Sasebo, Japan on 1 November and early in January 1946 joined the 7th Fleet at Shanghai, China. Her services in the western Pacific ended 2 April as Markab commenced the long voyage home for inactivation. The ship off loaded at New Orleans beginning 6 May. At Orange, Texas on January, 1947 she decommissioned and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. =Korea, 1952‚Äì1955= When the Cold War turned hot in Korea, the resultant expansion of the Navy brought the temporary reactivation of Markab. Recommissioned on 26 February 1952 with Captain Melvyn H. McCoy in command, she remained on the East Coast servicing Destroyer Force ships. Operating initially at Newport, Rhode Island and after April, 1955 at Fall River, Massachusetts, Markab also participated in the semiannual fleet exercises. On 9 February she departed on a voyage to Charleston where she decommissioned on 31 July. =Vietnam, 1960‚Äì1969= Towed to Mare Island Navy Yard in California, she was redesignated as Repair Ship AR-23 on 15 April 1960 and recommissioned on 1 July with Captain Edwin Monroe Westbrook, Jr. in command. Homeported at Alameda Naval Air Station, the repair ship sailed to Pearl Harbor late in October, returning 22 December. Between 5 July 1962 and 14 September 1966 she projected her services even more widely, steaming three times on seven month WestPac deployments with Capt. Bennie W. Jones, Jr. at the helm. On the first such voyage Markab returned a priceless Chinese art treasures exhibit to Taiwan. On the next two tours, ships returning from combat patrol off the coast of Vietnam increasingly required her facilities. Interspersed with the work periods in the Philippines and Japan were brief rest and rehabilitation periods at Hong Kong and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. She continued this pattern of West Coast duty and western Pacific deployment into 1969. Markab earned one campaign star for Vietnam War service. Decommissioning and scrapping Decommissioned again on 19 December 1969 at the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility in Vallejo, California, Markab was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September 1976. Custody was permanently transferred to the Maritime Administration and the ship was placed in the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet on 3 December 1976. The ship was sold to Zidell Explorations, Inc., 12 April 1977 for $301,688.88, and physically delivered to zidell on 3 May 1977 for scrapping.

Established as an international not-for-profit association under Swiss law, Rights and Humanity is multi-faith and multi-cultural by philosophy, composition and action. Its premise is that international human rights law and the principles of humanity - the values shared across faiths and cultures - together provide a legal framework and moral compass for global action for progress. Its unique approach is holistic, cooperative, solutions-oriented and champions progress rather than blame. It puts people and planet at the centre of policy and action, prompting an ethic of cooperation for the common good. The association‚Äôs effective positive approach has attracted the global patronage of people of great eminence. In 2003, our Patrons and other global leaders signed ‚ÄòThe Rights and Humanity Principles of Responsibility‚Äô ‚Äì the first multi-faith, multi-cultural consensus on individual responsibilities. Rights and Humanity‚Äôs distinguishing role is that it focuses on: ‚Ä¢ promoting economic and social justice through the practical realisation of human rights as a foundation for peace (rather than monitoring violations of human rights) ‚Ä¢ building solutions-oriented consensus through a unique approach which emphasises the highest common vision rather than the lowest common denominator ‚Ä¢ developing education in human rights and responsibilities, peace and sustainability in public policy, corporate, professional and daily life. Professor Julia H√§usermann, Founder and President of Rights and Humanity Rights and Humanity have a YouTube channel with several short videos outlining their achievements. Achievements During the last 30 years, Rights and Humanity has played a significant role in shaping global policy and practice through the integration of a ‚Äúhuman rights approach‚Äù.A Human Rights Approach to Development by J. H√§usermann (published 1998) It has chosen to focus on various priority issues of the day, including HIV/AIDS, poverty, health, water Right to Water, in partnership with WaterAid and others Nepal Journals Online and sanitation,World Health Organization participatory democracy, cultural rights,Circle Network complex emergencies and the global financial crisis. For each issue Rights and Humanity: ‚Ä¢ undertakes holistic, multi-disciplinary research on all aspects ‚Ä¢ brings together public, private and civil society stakeholders to analyse the challenges through the lens of human rights and responsibilities, identify necessary reforms and adopt common strategies ‚Ä¢ encourages implementation of the agreed strategies through policy advice to UN agencies, governments and NGOs; demonstration pilot projects; education; and professional training. The ‚Äúhuman rights approach to development‚Äù pioneered by Rights and Humanity has been adopted by UN agencies, governments and NGOs around the world.The Overseas Development Institute International Council on Social Welfare The association has demonstrated how discrimination and social exclusion are among the root causes of poverty and preventable ill-health. Evaluations have established that this approach is saving and bettering millions of lives around the world. Rights and Humanity has successfully used its peace-building approach to resolve deadlock between governments on a number of sensitive issues such as those between: ‚Ä¢ Western/Northern states and Eastern/Southern states before the World Conference on Human Rights, Vienna, 1993, to forge global consensus on the universality of human rights ‚Ä¢ Islamic and Western states at the Fourth World Conference on Women, Beijing, 1995, to ensure that adolescent girls receive health information and services ‚Ä¢ Israeli and Arab delegates before the World Conference on Racism, Durban, 2001, to achieve joint recognition of both the atrocities of the Holocaust and the suffering of the Palestinian people.

There are two main choices for field dominance: odd or even. With odd field dominance the edit or switch occurs at the start of the odd field. With even field dominance the edit or switch occurs at the start of the even field (some equipment, such as vision mixers or switchers allow the field dominance to be set to 'none' which means the switch will occur on the next field boundary after the switch has been pressed). Interlacing divides the frame into two fields, each containing half the number of lines. Each field is scanned in 1/60 second under the 525-line system (or 480i ‚Äì often incorrectly referred to as NTSC) or 1/50 of a second under the 625-line system (or 576i ‚Äì often incorrectly referred to as the PAL). With interlaced systems there are an odd number of lines in each frame. This means that there is a half line offset between the fields, therefore the lines in the second field will be positionally interleaved with the lines in the first field. The lines are numbered in the order in which they are scanned (so it is incorrect to talk of the 'odd numbered lines' and the 'even numbered lines' when referring to interlaced video - but see PsF Line Numbers). In 525/60 systems, by convention, the first field in the frame is considered the even field. In 625/50 systems, by convention, the first field in the frame is considered the odd field. Selecting a consistent field dominance in vision switching and linear editing systems will maintain color framing synchronization. Re-editing old video material already edited with a different field dominance convention can be problematic, as it can lead to \\"flash fields\\" when old and new edits are made too close together. The term field dominance is often incorrectly used to refer to field order, particularly when referring to a field order error such as can occur when converting between certain different video file formats. Analogue 525/60 systems field one, line one starts when the falling edge of the first equalizing pulse is coincident with the start of a line. In 625/50 systems field one line one starts with line sync being coincident with the falling edge of the first broad pulse in the analogue field sync. Digital formats use a single-bit in their Timing Reference Sequence as the \\"Field\\" flag. Field flag bit F=0 marks the first field of each frame. F=1 Marks the second field. PsF Line Numbers In Progressive segmented frame (PsF), which is a way of sending a progressively scanned picture over an interlaced system, each alternate field will contain the odd and even lines of the original progressive scan. But once it is being carried as an interlaced picture the lines are numbered in the order they are being sent as with any 'normal' interlaced system.

Starting at its junction with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway line at Haltwhistle, the line ran to the town of Alston. An 1846 Parliamentary Act authorised a line as far as Nenthead, providing an outlet for the lead mines in the Alston area, and plans were made to connect with railways further south. When the decision was made to terminate the branch at Alston, a further act was needed in 1849. Initially the line opened in stages: from the junction to Shafthill (later renamed Coanwood) in 1851, and from Alston to Lambley in 1852. The full opening of the line awaited the construction of Lambley Viaduct, and was achieved later in 1852. Rundown and closure Summer 1961 timetable In the 1950s freight services were withdrawn from Coanwood, and all the intermediate stations were unstaffed. After the locomotive shed closed in 1959 and the line's goods services were withdrawn in the early 1960s, the line operated with a Class 101 Diesel Multiple Unit based at Blaydon and ran as a siding, a simple railway with no signals other than those at the junction, from Haltwhistle. Railbuses were unsuccessfully trialled in 1965. Although the line was marked for closure in the Beeching plan, the lack of an all-weather road kept it open. A link between local roads, including a temporary level crossing over the branch, was built in the Lambley area. This enabled Ribble Motor Services to run a replacement bus service. The line closed officially on 3 May 1976, with the last train working two days earlier. Despite efforts by the South Tynedale Railway Preservation Society to take over the line, the track was lifted soon after the closure.  The branch line today  Northern railhead of the South Tynedale Railway, near Slaggyford station, 1 May 2017. In 1983, a narrow-gauge railway opened between Alston and Gilderdale (in Cumbria) and has since been extended northwards, across the border into Northumberland. This gauge line is called the South Tynedale Railway and now runs from Alston to Slaggyford. It regularly runs a steam service with a couple of German-built Henschel engines, Helen Kathryn and Thomas Edmondson. The journey includes a viaduct over the River South Tyne. Construction of the next section of track, a mile stretch from Lintley to Slaggyford, was finally completed in July 2017. With this, the STR is now approximately 5 miles in length. The track bed has been severed at two points close to Haltwhistle junction, by the A69 Haltwhistle Bypass and the removal of a former bridge on a minor road nearby.

The radula is composed of many transverse horizontal series of teeth, the centrals tricuspidate, about the size of the laterals, laterals bicuspid, or tricuspid with the interior cusp obsolete, marginals usually wider than high, short with two or three small cusps. In the soft parts the most obvious distinction is the lack of a caudal mucous pit, and their possessing a sculptured jaw. Typically, there is a distinction in the dentition, although in some species the lateral teeth take on a pseudozonitoid appearance; even in such cases the extreme marginals in Helix remain short and very obtuse. This family of snails is defined by the anatomical presence of a diverticulum. Some genera within this family create and use love darts as part of their mating behavior. These snails have one dart apparatus. The dart sac has no accessory sac, and contains two tubular glands, inserted at the base of the dart sac. In this family, the number of haploid chromosomes lies between 21 and 30 (according to the values in this table).Barker G.

However some species, notably Cornu aspersum, have been introduced and become established in numerous different areas worldwide.

The story has also been made into an episode of the Smurfs animated cartoon show, where the only known significant difference is that Smurfette stays in the village for the rest of the show's run. Apart from the titular story, it contains another one called La Faim des Schtroumpfs (\\"The Hunger of the Smurfs\\").  Plot  =The Smurfette= Gargamel wants to take revenge against the Smurfs for his humiliating defeat at their hands. He decides that the most horrible plan to destroy them would be to send them a female Smurf, who shall seduce them and lead them to their doom. He thus fashions her out of clay and dips her in a potion, creating Smurfette. Smurfette is sent to the Smurf village, and the others befriend her, despite that she later proves to be annoying, albeit good-meaning. She is very talkative, a bit bossy, overly friendly, and hysterical. At first, Smurfette looks like a male Smurf with scraggly black hair, a large nose, and rather surly eyes, the only thing separating her from the rest being her white dress; not exactly the attractive temptress that Gargamel tried to create. Some of the Smurfs become sick of her, so they decide to play a trick: they make her think she has become overweight (by rigging a scale, setting in a misshaping mirror, making her listen to some nasty talk...). Becoming depressed, she realizes that she is not pretty and Papa Smurf decides to help her: he operates plastic smurfery on her for days and nights, and Smurfette comes out with blonde hair, more delicate features, longer eyelashes, walking and acting much more gracefully. All the Smurfs instantly fall in love with her and soon after, they all try to seduce her through different means. The competition and jealousy eventually bring chaos and violence among the Smurfs, who are ready for anything to please her, even painting the dam of the river pink. The last straw is when Smurfette forces Poet Smurf to open the dam for her, just so she could see the water spurting. The dam gets stuck open and the village is flooded. Even after the dam is sealed back up, the village is in a disastrous state. When Papa Smurf discovers that Smurfette is indirectly responsible, he tells her that she has only brought trouble. Furious, Smurfette tells them all that she shall then go back to Gargamel. After hearing this, Papa Smurf orders her arrested and places her on trial. The trial proves to be quite biased, most of the Smurfs supporting Smurfette's innocence. Jokey Smurf (who is Smurfette's attorney) reminds them that she has been able to seduce the Smurfs because of Papa Smurf, who made her attractive. Smurfette is eventually declared not guilty. Smurfette cannot stand the Smurfs fighting each other for her anymore, so she leaves the village indefinitely, leaving a message saying that she will be back one day (which she eventually does). Although they are saddened by the event, Papa Smurf cheers them up by telling that they should get revenge on Gargamel and give him a taste of his own medicine: they create a fat ugly human woman out of clay (as Gargamel did with Smurfette) and send her to his house, where she desperately asks him for shelter, speaking in Smurf talk. The story ends with Gargamel running away from her, grumbling that he shall take vengeance. =The Hunger of the Smurfs= Winter is near and the Smurfs are gathering food. But days after the winter comes, the food storage is destroyed in a fire. To survive, they are forced to leave the village and find a place where they can feed themselves. After long days journeying in the cold wilderness, they find a human castle where its lord is living alone after losing all his fortune. Trying to find remaining food, they stumble on a secret room of jewels. They share their discovery with the lord, who can then buy food for them. The Smurfs are then able to go back to the village. In other media When the Smurfette story was adapted for the cartoon show, the plastic smurfery was moved to after the dam incident and the subsequent trial. With the trial, all the Smurfs are depicted as angrily well aware of Smurfette's treachery and change their minds only when she confesses that she is a pawn of Gargamel. Some time after Smurfette gets her new look, Gargamel contacts her and after noting that she's changed, he tells her that he can help her repay the Smurfs with a surprise party by the big oak tree. Of course, it turns out to be a trap. Smurfette arrives late and after discovering that she had been tricked, she disguises herself as a male Smurf, rescues the other Smurfs, and defeats Gargamel. The episode ends with Gargamel running away from the homely human woman the Smurfs created while Smurfette, with her loyalty now clearly established, is fully welcomed into the Smurf community.

Life He was son of John Carpenter, rector of Northleigh, Devon, and was born there on 7 February 1589.Alexander Chalmers, F.S.A., 1813, The General Biographical Dictionary: Containing An Historical and Critical Account of the Lives and Writings of the Most Eminent Persons in Every Nation; Particularly the British and Irish; from the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time, revised and enlarged; Volume VIII, p. 273, gives his birth date as 7 February 1588 and states that he was born in North-Lew, West Devon district of the county of Devon, \\"not Northlegh.\\" He matriculated at St. Edmund Hall, Oxford, on 7 June 1605; but was elected, on a recommendatory letter of James I, a Devonshire fellow of Exeter College on 30 June 1607. A second Devonshire candidate, Michael Jermyn, obtained an equal number of votes; the vice- chancellor gave his decision in favour of Carpenter. The dates of Carpenter's degrees were: Bachelor of Arts 5 July 1610, Master of Arts 1618, Bachelor of Divinity 11 May 1620, Doctor of Divinity 1626. During his residence at Oxford he is said to have become a noted philosopher, poet, mathematician, and geographer. One of his pupils at the university was Sir William Morice, secretary of state 1660‚Äì8, a politician with religious views similar to his tutor's Calvinism. Matthew Sutcliffe nominated him a member of Chelsea College, and Archbishop James Ussher brought him to Ireland, where he was appointed schoolmaster of the king's wards in Dublin (wards being minors of property whose parents were Roman Catholics). Carpenter's death is said to have occurred at Dublin in the beginning of 1628, and his funeral sermon was preached by Robert Ussher. Works His earliest work Philosophia libera triplici exercitationum decade proposita was an attack on the Aristotelian system of philosophy, and appeared at Frankfurt in 1621, under the pseudonym \\"N. C. Cosmopolitanus.\\" Later editions were issued under his name in 1622, 1636, and 1675. His treatise of Geography Delineated Forth in Two Books was published in 1625, and republished in 1685. Three sermons entitled Achitophel, or the Picture of a Wicked Politician, preached to the University of Oxford and dedicated to James Ussher, are stated to have appeared in 1627, 1628, 1629, 1638, 1638, and 1642. The first edition was called in, and the passages against Arminianism were removed. After his death there appeared (1633 and 1640) a sermon, Chorazin and Bethsaida's Woe, which he had preached at St. Mary's, Oxford. The dedication by N. H. was to Thomas Winniffe, and asserts that but for a kinsman the manuscript might have been lost on the Dutch shores, as Carpenter's works on optics were in the Irish Sea.

It was written by Laurence James under the house name James Axler. Plot synopsis Arriving in New Mexico via a MAT-TRANS jump, Ryan Cawdor, Krysty Wroth, J. B. Dix, Dr. Theophilus Tanner, and Mildred Wyeth are met by Jak Lauren, who informs them that Ryan's son Dean was ambushed and kidnapped by slavers while he was left in Jak's care. Jak's wife, Christina, was able to capture a mortally wounded slaver and under torture extract information about the group he belongs to. All are surprised to learn that the group is not regional, but instead makes use of the MAT-TRANS chambers and their \\"last destination\\" setting to capture slaves from throughout the Deathlands. What is most troubling for Ryan, however, is the name of the group's leader: Major-Commandant Gregori Zimyanin, a man Ryan has encountered two times previously. After taking a day to rest at the Lauren ranch and construct a plan, Ryan and Jak set out alone to rescue Dean, not taking the entire group so as to better function covertly. Though they anticipate a cold destination based on various clues and statements from the captured slaver, both are only minimally prepared when the MAT-TRANS jump takes them to a brutally cold redoubt. As they make their way through the facility they come across three \\"cuddlies\\", small, furred, foot-long animals reputed to be both highly friendly and cute. This turns out to be only half true, which Jak and Ryan both discover when the seemingly benign cuddlies turn vicious once they get close to the pair. After a struggle, both are able to kill the surprisingly lethal animals. Ryan narrowly avoids injury, but Jak is wounded in a few places, the worst being a long cut on his jaw which refuses to stop bleeding. Though not lethal if treated, the wound is severe enough that it will likely become infected and gangrenous in the bitter cold. Both Jak and Ryan agree there is no other choice, and Jak returns to New Mexico through the MAT-TRANS. Ryan reaches the exit of the redoubt and immediately spots the slavers' base: a large sulfur mine, well-guarded and operated by slave labor, surrounded on all sides by barren, mountainous terrain. He decides to wait until nightfall to make his approach, and ventures further into the redoubt to find a place to rest. While exploring an abandoned testing office Ryan inadvertently activates a set of five prototype \\"sec hunters\\": androids programmed to identify a target by their DNA and then hunt them ceaselessly. Ryan only becomes aware of this several hours later, when the first 'droid appears and tries to kill him. The sec hunter proves all but impervious to gunfire, but with some difficulty Ryan manages to destroy the 'droid by pushing it off the edge of a cliff. His victory is short-lived, as a few hours later the second sec hunter attacks, nearly killing him while he sleeps. After defeating the second hunter, Ryan heads to the test chamber to meet the third as it activates; eventually it does, but malfunctions spectacularly, attacking and destroying itself. The fourth and fifth sec hunters do not activate, and Ryan cautiously departs with the hope that the onslaught is over. Ryan makes his way down the treacherous mountain path and is eventually forced to seek shelter from a harsh blizzard. He finds the entrance to an abandoned mine tunnel, occupied by Kate Webb and her elderly grandfather Cody, two slaves who have escaped from the mine but have discovered they have nowhere to flee to. Cody is abruptly killed soon after when the fourth sec hunter emerges from the blizzard, following Ryan and killing Cody because he was in the way. Kate and Ryan flee deeper into the mine, eventually losing the 'droid by jumping over a large chasm blocking the tunnel. Venturing deeper they discover a fast-moving underground river, which unexpectedly swells and draws them into it. They are briefly stopped by a net strung across the river by \\"trackies\\" - hostile mutants - and after nearly being killed by a large group of them Kate and Ryan take their chances in the river again. When they finally find themselves outside again and on land Ryan narrowly manages to get both of them to the shelter of a small cave and start a fire before they succumb to the cold. Grateful for him saving her life, Kate seduces Ryan into having sex with her. Back in New Mexico Jak has returned safely home. During breakfast one morning he mentions that Christina has been ill recently; at Doc Tanner's questioning he confirms that his wife has been sick only in the mornings, but fails to understand the significance. Sometime later the companions notice a large dust cloud moving in their direction. Christina, equipped with binoculars, can make out a slow-moving group of horses and people at its center, but cannot tell if they are simply another peaceful oxen train or something else. Preparations begin for either eventuality. The next morning Ryan and Kate sneak into the sulphur mine, slipping unnoticed into a work crew and passing themselves off as other slaves. From there Ryan and Kate attempt to locate Dean, carefully moving from crew to crew over the next several days. Meanwhile, Dean is doing his best to avoid the attention of Zimyanin, who has met the boy a few times over the past days and finds him unsettlingly familiar, but cannot place why. The Major- Commandant only realizes the connection several days later, conveniently when Dean is recovering from a near-fatal mine collapse in the infirmary and Ryan himself has been detained in chains for disobeying sec men while attempting to rescue his son. Zimyanin arrives at Ryan's jail just minutes too late; Kate has managed to kill the jail's guards and free Ryan, and both are gone by the time Zimyanin arrives. The Major-Commandant posts extra guards on Dean, but Ryan stages a mass escape, forcing most of Zimyanin's sec men to round up escaped slaves. Ryan and Kate rescue Dean in the confusion and flee to a disused mining equipment warehouse. Fearing the possibility of a revolt, Gregori orders all remaining slaves executed. Zimyanin has his sec men surround the warehouse, then proceeds in alone. The game of cat-and-mouse between him and Ryan is interrupted when the fourth sec hunter makes itself known by decapitating Kate. Dean and Ryan flee from the 'droid along elevated metal catwalks with Zimyanin in pursuit; the three of them wind up trapped between a fallen section of catwalk and the advancing sec hunter. Ryan negotiates a brief truce with the Major-Commandant, carefully leaving out that the sec hunter is primarily interested him alone. Zimyanin attempts to confront the 'droid head-on, which ends with the robot breaking his right arm. The brief confrontation causes the catwalk to shift and drop slightly, which the robot has difficulty coping with; noticing this, the three deliberately rock the catwalk violently, eventually causing one end of a section to break free and drop. Zimyanin blocks a last-ditch effort by the sec hunter to attack Ryan and forcibly throws it from the catwalk to its destruction, but ends up hanging one-handed from a severed support cable. Despite the risks (and against the oft-repeated advice of the Trader) Ryan moves to help Gregori back onto the catwalk. However, Dean refuses to let him live, taking aim with his pistol at the Major-Commandant. Rather than force the young boy to kill him, Zimyanin deliberately lets go, falling to his death. Ryan and his son make their way down from the catwalk and escape to the redoubt under the cover of a snowstorm. The MAT-TRANS takes Ryan and Dean back to New Mexico without incident. As they exit the ruins of the redoubt Ryan spots a large column of smoke in the distance, coming from the direction of the Lauren ranch. Cultural references As Ryan and Jak are riding away from the Lauren farm, Doc Tanner runs after them for a moment while calling out, \\"Shane,\\" mirroring the end of the film of the same name. While attempting to shake the sec hunter from the warehouse walkway, Zimyanin refers to Ryan and Dean as his \\"droogs\\", a fictional slang word for \\"friends\\" featured in A Clockwork Orange.

That is, it is a method for assigning a value to a series, different from the conventional method of taking limits of partial sums. Given a series ‚àëan, if its Euler transform converges to a sum, then that sum is called the Euler sum of the original series. As well as being used to define values for divergent series, Euler summation can be used to speed the convergence of series. Euler summation can be generalized into a family of methods denoted (E, q), where q ‚â• 0. The (E, 1) sum is the ordinary Euler sum. All of these methods are strictly weaker than Borel summation; for q > 0 they are incomparable with Abel summation. Definition For some value y we may define the Euler sum (if it converges for that value of y) corresponding to a particular formal summation as: : _{E_y}\\\\, \\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty a_j := \\\\sum_{i=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{(1+y)^{i+1}} \\\\sum_{j=0}^i \\\\binom{i}{j} y^{j+1} a_j . If all the formal sums actually converge, the Euler sum will equal the left hand side. However, using Euler summation can accelerate the convergence (this is especially useful for alternating series); sometimes it can also give a useful meaning to divergent sums. To justify the approach notice that for interchanged sum, Euler's summation reduces to the initial series, because :y^{j+1}\\\\sum_{i=j}^\\\\infty \\\\binom{i}{j} \\\\frac{1}{(1+y)^{i+1}}=1. This method itself cannot be improved by iterated application, as : _{E_{y_1}} {}_{E_{y_2}}\\\\sum = \\\\, _{E_{\\\\frac{y_1 y_2}{1+y_1+y_2}}} \\\\sum. Examples * Using y = 1 for the formal sum ::\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty (-1)^j P_k(j) :we get ::\\\\sum_{i=0}^k \\\\frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \\\\sum_{j=0}^i \\\\binom{i}{j} (-1)^j P_k(j), :if Pk is a polynomial of degree k. Note that the inner sum would be zero for , so in this case Euler summation reduces an infinite series to a finite sum. * The particular choice ::P_k(j):= (j+1)^k :provides an explicit representation of the Bernoulli numbers, since ::\\\\frac{B_{k+1}}{k+1}=-\\\\zeta(-k) :(the Riemann zeta function).

The exact nature of the color frame sequence depends on the video standard being used. In the case of the three main composite video standards, PAL video has an 8-field (4 frame) color frame sequence, and NTSC and SECAM both have 4-field (2 frame) color frame sequences. Preserving the color framing sequence of video across edits and between channels in video effects was an important issue in early analog composite videotape editing systems, as cuts between different color sequences would cause jumps in subcarrier phase, and mixing two signals of different field dominance would result in color artifacts on the part of the signal that was not in sync with the output color frame sequence. To help prevent these problems, SMPTE time code contains a color framing bit, which can be used to indicate that the video material the timecode refers to follows a standard convention regarding the synchronization of video time code and the color framing sequence. If the color framing bit was set in both types of material, the editing system could then always ensure that color framing was preserved by constraining edit decisions between input sources to keep the correct relationship between the timecode sequences, and hence the color framing sequences. Color framing has become largely an issue of historical interest, first with the advent in the 1980s of digital composite video timebase correctors and frame stores, which could regenerate the color frame sequence of a composite signal at any phase, and later with analog component video editing and modern digital video systems, in which subcarrier phase is no longer relevant.

Conklin Gunnar Dahlberg Julian Huxley The Race Question is the first of four UNESCO statements about issues of race. It was issued on 18 July 1950 following World War II and Nazi racism to clarify what was scientifically known about race, and as a moral condemnation of racism.\\"The Race Question\\", UNESCO, 1950, 11pp It was criticized on several grounds and revised versions were publicized in 1951, 1967, and 1978.  Authors  The statements were signed by some of the leading researchers of the time, in the field of sociology, psychology, biology, cultural anthropology and ethnology. The original statement was drafted by Ernest Beaglehole; Juan Comas; Luiz de Aguiar Costa Pinto; Franklin Frazier, sociologist specialised in race relations studies; Morris Ginsberg, founding chairperson of the British Sociological Association; Humayun Kabir, writer, philosopher, and twice Education Minister of India; Claude L√©vi- Strauss, one of the founders of ethnology and leading theorist of structural anthropology; and Ashley Montagu, anthropologist and author of The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity, who was the rapporteur. The text was then revised by Ashley Montagu following criticisms submitted by Hadley Cantril; Edwin Conklin; Gunnar Dahlberg; Theodosius Dobzhansky, author of Genetics and the Origin of Species (1937); L. C. Dunn; Donald Hager; Julian Huxley, first director of UNESCO and one of the many key contributors to modern evolutionary synthesis; Otto Klineberg; Wilbert Moore; H. J. Muller; Gunnar Myrdal, author of An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy (1944); Joseph Needham, a biochemist specialist of Chinese science; and geneticist Curt Stern.  Introduction  The introduction states that it was inevitable that UNESCO should take a position in the controversy. The preamble to the UNESCO constitution states that it should combat racism. The constitution itself stated that \\"The great and terrible war that has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races.\\" A 1948 UN Social and Economic Council resolution called upon UNESCO to consider the timeliness \\"of proposing and recommending the general adoption of a programme of dissemination of scientific facts designed to bring about the disappearance of that which is commonly called race prejudice.\\" In 1949, the UNESCO adopted three resolutions which committed it to \\"study and collect scientific materials concerning questions of race\\", \\"to give wide diffusion to the scientific material collected\\", and \\"to prepare an education campaign based on this information.\\" Before undertaking this campaign, the scientific position had to be clarified. Furthermore, in doing this The introduction stated \\"Knowledge of the truth does not always help change emotional attitudes that draw their real strength from the subconscious or from factors beside the real issue.\\" But it could \\"however, prevent rationalizations of reprehensive acts or behaviour prompted by feelings that men will not easily avow openly.\\" UNESCO made a moral statement: UNESCO would start a campaign to spread the results of the report to a \\"vast public\\" such as by publishing pamphlets. It described Brazil as having an \\"exemplary situation\\" regarding race relations and that research should be undertaken in order to understand the causes of this \\"harmony\\".  Criticism and controversy  Despite the introduction stating that \\"The competence and objectivity of the scientists who signed the document in its final form cannot be questioned\\", the first version of the statement was heavily criticized. A revised edition in 1951 explained the controversy as \\"At the first discussion on the problem of race, it was chiefly sociologists who gave their opinions and framed the 'Statement on Race'. That statement had a good effect, but it did not carry the authority of just those groups within whose special province fall the biological problems of race, namely the physical anthropologists and geneticists. Secondly, the first statement did not, in all its details, carry conviction of these groups and, because of this, it was not supported by many authorities in these two fields. In general, the chief conclusions of the first statement were sustained, but with differences in emphasis and with some important omissions.\\" Some examples of differences include that the first version argued that there was no evidence for intellectual or personality differences. The revised version stated that \\"When intelligence tests, even non-verbal, are made on a group of non-literate people, their scores are usually lower than those of more civilised people\\" but concluded that \\"Available scientific knowledge provides no basis for believing that the groups of mankind differ in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development.\\" The first version did not reject the idea of race biology, a biological basis to racial categories. It defined the concept of race in terms of a population defined by certain anatomical and physiological characteristics diverging from other populations; it gives as examples the Caucasian, Mongoloid, and Negroid races. The first version stated that \\"National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups: and the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connection with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of ethnic groups.\\" The revised version instead stated that the experts \\"agreed to reserve race as the word to be used for anthropological classification of groups showing definite combinations of physical (including physiological) traits in characteristic proportions.\\" A revised version of the statement was published in 1951 and accompanied by observations, comments, and criticisms from many of the scientists engaged in the drafting and review of the text.\\"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\\". UNESCO, 1952 Notably, four scientists are listed as \\"frankly opposed\\" to the statement as a whole.\\"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\\", p. 26. UNESCO, 1952 Among these, English statistician and biologist R. A. Fisher insisted on racial differences, arguing that evidence and everyday experience showed that human groups differ profoundly \\"in their innate capacity for intellectual and emotional development\\" and concluded that the \\"practical international problem is that of learning to share the resources of this planet amicably with persons of materially different nature\\", and that \\"this problem is being obscured by entirely well-intentioned efforts to minimize the real differences that exist.\\"\\"The Race Concept: Results of an Inquiry\\", p. 27. UNESCO, 1952  The 1951 revised statement  The 1951 revised statement stated that Homo sapiens is one species. \\"The concept of race is unanimously regarded by anthropologists as a classificatory device providing a zoological frame within which the various groups of mankind may be arranged and by means of which studies of evolutionary processes can be facilitated. In its anthropological sense, the word 'race' should be reserved for groups of mankind possessing well-developed and primarily heritable physical differences from other groups.\\" These differences have been caused in part by partial isolation preventing intermingling, geography an important explanation for the major races, often cultural for the minor races. National, religious, geographical, linguistic and cultural groups do not necessarily coincide with racial groups. There is no evidence for the existence of so- called \\"pure races\\" and no scientific justification exists for discouraging reproduction between persons of different races.  Legacy and other UNESCO statements  The UNESCO later published other similar statements on racism. In 1978, the UNESCO Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice\\"Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice\\", UNESCO, 1978. (PDF:) stated that \\"All peoples of the world possess equal faculties for attaining the highest level in intellectual, technical, social, economic, cultural and political development\\" and \\"The differences between the achievements of the different peoples are entirely attributable to geographical, historical, political, economic, social and cultural factors.\\" It also argued for implementing a number of policies in order to combat racism and inequalities, and stated that \\"Population groups of foreign origin, particularly migrant workers and their families who contribute to the development of the host country, should benefit from appropriate measures designed to afford them security and respect for their dignity and cultural values and to facilitate their adaptation to the host environment and their professional advancement with a view to their subsequent reintegration in their country of origin and their contribution to its development; steps should be taken to make it possible for their children to be taught their mother tongue.\\" A draft of the statement was prepared by the Director-General and \\"eminent specialists in human rights\\". It was discussed at a meeting by government representatives from over 100 member states. It was recommended that the representatives should include among them \\"social scientists and other persons particularly qualified to in the social, political, economic, cultural, and scientific aspects of the problem\\". A number of non-governmental and inter-governmental organizations sent observers. A final text of was adopted by the meeting of government representatives \\"by consensus, without opposition or vote\\" and later by the UNESCO General Conference, Twentieth Session. In 1995, UNESCO published a Declaration of Principles on Tolerance\\"Declaration of Principles on Tolerance\\", UNESCO, 1995. (PDF:) to add to its dialogue about racial equality with recommendations for tolerant treatment of persons with varied racial and cultural backgrounds. It stated \\"Tolerance is respect, acceptance and appreciation of the rich diversity of our world's cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being human. It is fostered by knowledge, openness, communication, and freedom of thought, conscience and belief. Tolerance is harmony in difference. It is not only a moral duty, it is also a political and legal requirement. Tolerance, the virtue that makes peace possible, contributes to the replacement of the culture of war by a culture of peace.\\" The 1950 UNESCO statement contributed to the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court desegregation decision in Brown v.

Description  shell of Arianta arbustorum (top left); lateral view (top right); apical view (bottom left) and umbilical view (bottom right) The shell is usually brown with numerous pale yellowish rows of spots and usually with a brown band above the periphery, occasionally yellowish, reddish or with greenish hue, weakly striated and with fine spiral lines on the upper side. The shell has 5-5.5 convex whorls with deep suture. The last whorl is slightly descending near the aperture. The aperture is with prominent white lip inside. The apertural margin is reflected. Umbilicus is entirely covered by the reflected columellar margin. The width of the shell is 18‚Äì25 mm. The height of the shell is 12‚Äì22 mm. Dimensions are locally variable. The shell shape is globular in most present-day populations, but originally is believed to have been depressed in the Pleistocene, before lowlands were invaded and shells became globular, re-invading mountain regions except some isolated spots among glaciers. The animal is usually black.  Life cycle  Arianta arbustorum lives in forests and open habitats of any kind. It requires humidity. It lives also in disturbed habitats (not in Ireland where it is restricted to old native woodland). It may locally tolerate non-calcareous substrate, in north Scotland also on sandhills. In the Alps up to 2700 m, in Britain 1200 m, in Bulgaria 1500 m. It feeds on green herbs, dead animals and faeces.

Her sister ships were Trygg and Sn√∏gg. The Trygg class vessels were the only additions to the Norwegian fleet of torpedo boats between the First and the Second World Wars. At the outbreak of the Second World War the Trygg class was mobilised together with eight 2. class and six 1. class torpedo boats. Stegg was constructed at Horten naval shipyard and had yard number 111. She was named after the Stegg, the Norwegian term for the male grouse. Second World War =Intercepting German merchants= The Stegg had a brief and intense period of service in the Norwegian Campaign after the German invasion of Norway. When the invasion began on 9 April 1940 she was anchored at Skudeneshavn and commanded by Lieutenant H. M. Hansen. She entered the Hardangerfjord on 10 April 1940 and proceeded to capture two German merchant ships; first the 5,295-ton on 12 April 1940 and then the 6,567-ton iron ore laden five days later. Together with the 1. class torpedo boat HNoMS S√¶l, Stegg escorted Afrika to the port of Odda the same day she was captured.Hegland & Lilleheim 1998: 57 The German crews were held as POWs by Norwegian land forces. Cl√§re Hugo Stinnes was used by the Norwegian forces from 14 April as the depot ship of the Hardangerfjord naval air group in Eidfjord. The two captured ships were later to become the centres of battles at Kinsarvik (Cl√§re Hugo Stinnes) and Ulvik (Afrika). Afrika, having been captured on her way from Narvik to Germany, ended up being scuttled by her Norwegian captors in the heat of battle at Ulvik, while Cl√§re Hugo Stinnes survived an unsuccessful Kriegsmarine attempted recapture at Kinsarvik and was eventually released with her crew on 2 May 1940 as Norwegian resistance in South Norway collapsed. On her way to Bergen Cl√§re Hugo Stinnes was attacked by the Royal Navy submarine Trident and damaged by gunfire. =Final battle= The end for Stegg came on 20 April 1940 as she was anchored at Her√∏ysund. In the morning the 1,870-ton artillery training ship Bremse and the armed whaler Schiff 221 blocked Stegg in the fjord and attacked her. Early on in the engagement two 57 mm shells from Schiff 221 hit Stegg in the bow, set her ablaze and caused water to start flooding the torpedo boat. The heavier shells of Bremse meanwhile failed to find their target and the burning Stegg returned fire against Schiff 221, hitting the whaler twice with her 76 mm main gun. However, for Stegg the war was over, as the fire on board got out of control and her crew had to abandon ship. Soon the fire reached Steggs torpedoes and ammunition hold and the ship went up in a large explosion. The entire bow of the ship disappeared and Stegg sank slowly to the bottom of the fjord. The crew got away without serious injuries, despite being bombarded by the two German warships as they fled inland.

Richard Griffith (January 11, 1814 ‚Äì June 29, 1862) was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. He was mortally wounded at the Battle of Savage's Station during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. He was one of a number of Confederate generals who were born in the North in Pennsylvania. Early life and career Griffith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Ohio University in Athens, Ohio, he moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in about 1840. During the Mexican War, he served as an infantryman with the 1st Regiment of Mississippi Rifles, where he met and became friends with Colonel Jefferson Davis. After the war, he returned to civilian life and made his living as a banker and a U.S. Marshal. He was active in state and local politics, and was elected as the State Treasurer of Mississippi in 1847. He was a member of the antebellum state militia, holding the rank of brigadier general. His wife was Sallie Ann Whitfield, and they had four sons, including Benjamin Griffith who was mayor of Vicksburg, MS, 1905‚Äì1909. Civil War service Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi. When the Civil War began, Griffith was appointed as the colonel of the 12th Mississippi Infantry in May 1861. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 2 and put in command of a brigade of four Mississippi regiments that became part of Maj. Gen. John B. Magruder's division in April 1862. He soon saw action in the Seven Days Battles near Richmond, Virginia. It was during this fighting that General Griffith was mortally wounded. On June 29, 1862, Griffith and his men were pursuing Union soldiers retreating from positions on the Nine Mile Road when they encountered elements of Maj. Gen. Edwin V. Sumner's II Corps near Savage's Station, who were guarding the Union forces' retreat. In heavy artillery fire, Griffith was wounded in his thigh by a shell fragment. When he was informed that he was fatally wounded, it is reported that General Griffith said, \\"If only I could have led my brigade through this battle, I would have died satisfied.\\" Griffith was taken to Richmond, but succumbed to his wounds the same day. He is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi. Legacy The loss of General Griffith was much lamented by many, including his long-time friend Jefferson Davis. Of the fighting at Savage's Station he wrote, \\"Our loss was small in numbers, but great in value. Among others who could ill be spared, here fell the gallant soldier, the useful citizen, the true friend and Christian gentleman, Brigadier General Richard Griffith. He had served with distinction in foreign war, and, when the South was invaded, was among the first to take up arms in defense of our rights.\\" Later in the war, a group of soldier-musicians called \\"The McLaws Minstrels,\\" serving under Lafayette McLaws and formerly under General Griffith, would play at a theater in Fredericksburg. They charged a modest admission fee, the proceeds from which were used to erect a monument in the Mississippi State Capitol in honor of their fallen commander. His portrait hangs in Beauvoir, the Jefferson Davis Home and Presidential Library, and a copy of that portrait hangs in the Mississippi Hall of Fame in the Old Capitol Museum. Three blocks from the museum, East and West Griffith Streets are named after him.

It is located near the town of Fragkista. An independent community since 1912, it became part of the municipality of Fragkista in 1997. The population of the community at the 2011 census was 91 inhabitants. In the summer it grows to almost 500 people. The village is separated into \\"neighborhoods\\". The most Northern village is called Amiriani. The central area, also the largest, simply called Meseo or central Marathia. The next part is Kato Marathia, which is a ghost town. The next and most southern part is Parkio. There is also a small isolated section known as Voilada. History Marathia used to be a relatively large village that composed of over 600-800 families. It was originally inhabited by several Byzantine monasteries. The most prominent was the monastery of the Holy Trinity. It also maintains over ten churches with the largest being the church of Saint Athanasios in central Marathia. The northern part of Marathias, Amiriani, received its name during the Ottoman occupation of Greece. In the 18th century massive revolts took place against the Ottomans. In response the Ottomans placed a small battalion in Amergiani which was led by a soldier named Giannis. He was a rank of Amer in the Ottoman Empire, thus the name Amiriani. During this time the village saw several revolts which burned the village several times before the Greek War of Independence. In the 1950s, a major earthquake struck Evrytania which devastated the area. The neighborhood Kato Maxalas was heavily hit. This resulted in the neighborhood being abandoned as they relocated to Parkio. Prior to this in the late 1940s, vast amounts of the population emigrated to major cities as a result of the Greek Civil War, in which much of the village was occupied by the Communist. The 1960s saw a large exodus of the population to other areas of Greece, mainly Karpenisi, Agrinio, Lamia, and Athens. A large percentage moved to Canada, Australia and the United States mainly in the states of the Eastern Seaboard: New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and the central areas of North Carolina, in the cities of Winston-Salem, Charlotte and Burlington.

The boat was awarded numerous awards. Accordingly, as a result of Rubiss service with the FNFL, the boat was made a companion of the Ordre de la Lib√©ration by a decree issued by General Charles de Gaulle on 14 October 1941.  Career  After serving in Toulon with the 7th and later 5th Submarine Squadrons, in 1937 Rubis was transferred to Cherbourg. During the Norwegian campaign, in May 1940, Rubis laid mines off the Norwegian coast; the boat's mines claimed four Norwegian vessels in May and June, and a further three merchant ships in July. At the time of the French surrender on 22 June 1940, the boat was in the port of Dundee, Scotland in the United Kingdom, where the boat promptly joined the pavilion of the Free French Forces. At that time, she was commanded by Capitaine de Corvette Georges Cabanier. Whilst minelaying off Norway in mid-1941, Rubis encountered and torpedoed a Finnish merchant ship. Later in the war, the boat laid mines in the Bay of Biscay, claiming three German auxiliary minesweepers, an armed trawler, and a Vichy French tugboat in 1942, and a fourth auxiliary minesweeper in 1943. Operating off Stavanger in September 1944, the boat's mines claimed two auxiliary submarine chasers and two merchant ships. In October and November, Rubis continued in Norwegian waters, damaging but not sinking two vessels. On 21 December, the boat's mines claimed three auxiliary submarine chasers, a German merchant ship, and a minesweeper. Throughout the war, Rubis made 22 operational patrols, laying nearly 683 mines and sinking some 21,000 GRT of shipping. With 22 ships sunk (14 of them German, including 12 warships), Rubis achieved the highest kill number in the FNFL.https://web.archive.org/web/20131104144623/http://sous- marin.france.pagesperso-orange.fr/Q158.htm From 1946 to 1948, she was used as a school ship for rigging in Toulon. Rubis was struck on 4 October 1949, and was sunk on 31 January 1958 to be used as a sonar target.

Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975), was a US Supreme Court case. It held that a public school must conduct a hearing before subjecting a student to suspension. Also, a suspension without a hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. Background Nine students, including a student named Dwight Lopez, were suspended from Central High School (Columbus, Ohio) for 10 days for destroying school property and disrupting the learning environment. Ohio Law ¬ß 3313.66 empowered the school principal to suspend students for 10 days or expel them. The law required students' parents to be notified of the action within 24 hours to be given the reason. If students were expelled, they could appeal to the Board of Education, but ¬ß3313.66 gave no such allowances if they were suspended. A three-judge District Court struck down the law as a violation of students' right to due process of law. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio held: The District Court reprimanded the school for its violation of the 14th Amendment, as there were \\"minimum requirements of notice and a hearing prior to suspension, except in emergency situations.\\" The case was appealed by the school to the Supreme Court. Majority opinion Justice Byron R. White delivered the opinion of the Court, on behalf of a narrow 5-4 majority. It held that the state had violated due process by suspending the students without a hearing. The state had made education a fundamental right by providing for free public education for all residents between 5 and 21. The Court stated that protected interests are created not by the Constitution but by its institutions (Board of Regents v. Roth). The Court held that a 10-day suspension was not a de minimis deprivation of property. It also stated that suspending students had the potential of seriously harming their reputation and affecting their future employment and education. The Court also held that the state had no authority to deprive students of their property interest in educational benefits or their liberty interest in reputation, without due process of law. The Court reiterated the principle, first clearly formulated in Tinker v. Des Moines School Dist. but established in a long line of decisions before that case, students \\"do not shed their constitutional rights at the schoolhouse door.\\" Dissenting opinion Lewis Powell wrote the dissent that argued that the Ohio statute had granted the right to education, not the right to education without discipline. He challenged the court's finding that the suspension was severe enough to bring the Due Process Clause into play. Powell also argued that the safeguards provided by the Ohio statute were sufficient. The statute required the student's parents and the Board of Education to be given written notice of the suspension and \\"reasons therefor\\" within 24 hours. Powell also argued that the informal hearing proposed by the majority would not provide significantly more protection. Powell criticized at length the Court's interference with the operation of schools. He argued that minors should be and are treated differently under the law and that the Court was turning its back on precedent. Powell concluded that the majority's decision would allow students to claim due process violations when they were excluded from extracurricular activities, failed from a course, promoted, required to take certain subjects, transferred from one school to another, or bused to a distant school.

The cable owners of the JASURAUS system that became part of the APCN were Optus, Telstra and Indosat. They joined the APCN consortium by transferring 90% of the JASURAUS capacity for 10% on the APCN. JASURAUS was conceived in 1995 as an additional link from Australia to provide telephony services connection to the world, with a design life of 25 years and at a cost of A$160 million. The name was derived from a concatenation of the original planned sites of 'Jakarta' - 'Surabaya' - 'Australia'. However the Surabaya landing was abandoned before project commencement, though the name remained. The landing point in Indonesia was at Ancol Cable Station. The final landing point chosen at the Australian end was in Port Hedland, a number of options were looked into for the cable station including a secure concrete duct to the existing South Hedland exchange 11 km inland utilising the vacant 2nd floor which had previously been used for the Telstra Manual Assistance Centre. The PFE, SLTE and MUX equipment was finally commissioned in a new purpose built building located adjacent to the Cooke Point exchange. It featured many redundant systems, including a new physically diverse fibre to connect to the existing inland fibre route to Perth. At time of being ready for service in 1997, the main cables linking Australia to the world were Tasman2 (Sydney to Auckland connecting with PacRimEast and continuing to Hawaii) and PacRimWest (Sydney to Guam). Each system consisted of two fibre pairs delivering a total of 560 Mbit/s bandwidth per system. Jasuraus was designed to deliver a dramatic increase in network capacity, and was able to carry nearly 60,000 phone calls simultaneously at a data rate of 5.332 Gbit/s. JASURAUS was overtaken in 2000 by the 40 Gbit/s SeaMeWe3 and 320 Gbit/s Southern Cross Cable Network, just 3 years after start-up. The new systems provided stiff competition for JASURAUS, due to their higher bandwidth and easy access to systems located in the United States, and ongoing economic concerns proved to be an issue for the primary operators Telstra and Optus throughout the life of the cable. While JASURAUS was capable of supporting an upgrade to 20 Gbit/s, such agreements would have required consensus from the JASURAUS operators and APCN's owners. Proposed upgrades were further hampered due to the high cost charged by Telstra to third parties for the provision of IP transit and Leased line services from Port Hedland to Perth, which resulted in decreased demand from carriers as there was no alternative communications path out of Port Hedland. In the absence of upgrades beyond its initial bandwidth, JASURAUS saw minimal further use. Its remaining years were spent largely idle, with the cable retained as a backup link out of Australia and as an additional source of connectivity for AARNet. According to industry sources, JASURAUS was decommissioned in 2012.

Active from 1906 until 1910, it was founded by Oscar Hammerstein I. History The company began operations in 1906 at the Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street in New York City. Hammerstein built the house with the initial intent of making it a home for performances solely of opera in English; before construction was completed, however, he chose to shift the company's focus, deciding instead to present great operas in their original languages. The casts were to be drawn from the ranks of the greatest singers of the era. William Guard was hired to be the company's press representative, remaining in that capacity until the organization folded. The Manhattan Opera Company opened its first season on December 3, 1906, with a performance of Vincenzo Bellini's Norma; Cleofonte Campanini served as the artistic director. Many of the greatest opera stars of the era appeared with the company during its four- year history; among the most notable were Nellie Melba, Lillian Nordica, Luisa Tetrazzini, Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Giovanni Zenatello, Lina Cavalieri, Mary Garden, John McCormack, Lalla Miranda, Alessandro Bonci, Charles Dalmor√®s, Giovanni Polese, Maurice Renard, Alice Zeppilli, and Nicola Zerola. Many of them made their American debuts for Hammerstein. The repertory tended to French opera, then being neglected by the competing Metropolitan Opera, and to novelties. Among the latter were Pell√©as et M√©lisande featuring Garden, Elektra, and Louise. Hammerstein's company was a huge success, and provided damaging competition to the Metropolitan Opera; eventually this led to the resignation of Heinrich Conried as the latter company's general director, after which it was greatly reorganized. Nevertheless, after giving 463 performances of 49 different operas during its existence, the Manhattan Opera Company suddenly folded in 1910. For years the reason remained a mystery; more recently it has been discovered that Hammerstein and the directors of the Metropolitan, led by Otto Kahn, entered into a contractual agreement which led to the dissolution. Under the terms of the contract, negotiated by his son Arthur, Hammerstein was paid a flat sum of $1.2 million, in exchange for which he promised to stage no opera in the United States for the following ten years. It is widely believed that Hammerstein took the deal because the mounting costs of running the company were taking their toll on his finances, and he was going bankrupt.Bio by Oscar Hammerstein III.

Des Moines, IA. Author. =Moberly Junior College (1946‚Äì1958)= John began his collegiate coaching career starting the basketball program at Moberly Junior College in Moberly, Missouri. He compiled a 285-58 record (.831) for Moberly in 12 seasons from 1946‚Äì1958. John led Moberly to back-to-back NJCAA National Championships in 1954 and 1955. He was followed at Moberly by future NBA coach Cotton Fitzsimmons, who led Moberly to another two NJCAA National Championships. =Drake University (1958‚Äì1971)= John moved from Moberly to Drake University of the Missouri Valley Conference in Des Moines, Iowa in 1958. He would have a 211‚Äì131 record at Drake. In 1963‚Äì64, John led Drake to the postseason with an invitation to the 12-team 1964 National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden in New York City. There, the Bulldogs defeated Pittsburgh 87-82, before losing to New Mexico in the Elite Eight, 65‚Äì60. He led Drake (26‚Äì5) to the 1969 Final Four of the 1969 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament, where the Cinderella Bulldogs gave powerhouse UCLA and Lew Alcindor a scare on their way to the NCAA Championship. The game has been labeled as \\"the greatest near upset in NCAA Tournament history.\\" In the 1969 NCAA Tournament, Drake opened by defeating Texas A&M; 81‚Äì63 in the round of 16 after receiving a bye in the 25 team tournament. The Bulldogs then defeated Colorado State 84‚Äì77 to win the Midwest Region and advance to the Final Four. In the 1969 Final Four, they lost to Alcindor and Coach John Wooden's UCLA dynasty squad 85‚Äì82 on March 20, 1969 in the National Semi- Final. Drake, down 41‚Äì39 at halftime was close with the #1 ranked team the entire game, behind 24 points from Willie McCarter, 13 points with 16 rebounds from Willie Wise, a famous block of an Alcinder shot by Rick Wanamaker and strong defense by Dolph Pulliam. UCLA led 83-74 with one minute 12 seconds left, but Drake scored eight straight points and UCLA now had a one-point lead in the final minute of play. The Bruins went on to beat Purdue by 20 points (92‚Äì72) in the Championship game, en route to seven consecutive NCAA Championships. The Los Angeles Times gave an account of the closing moments: \\"Late in the game, UCLA led by three, but Drake had the ball and the momentum. Guard Willie McCarter put up a jumper from the left corner that ricocheted around the rim before falling into the hands of Drake forward Dolph Pulliam, who went straight back up with it. On the way up, Pulliam was hammered by Alcindor and Curtis Rowe, but the ball somehow made it through the hoop. The basket counted, but no foul was called against the Bruins. Eight seconds remained, and Drake trailed by one. UCLA escaped the Bulldogs' full-court press and got a pass through to Lynn Shackelford. In desperation, Drake's Ron Gwin fouled him. Shackelford made both of his one-and-one attempts.\\" Regarding the UCLA loss, McCarter reflected. \\"My mother always told me that God never gives you anything you can't handle,\\" McCarter said. \\"That's what I thought about Coach John. He never gave us anything we couldn't handle. In that 1969 game against UCLA, for one special moment he had us all believing we were more than what we really were.\\" After the game, when asked what was the matter with UCLA, John Wooden replied simply,\\"Drake.\\" In the 1969 3rd Place Game, the Bulldogs continued their strong play as they defeated Coach Dean Smith's ACC Champion North Carolina Tar Heels, with Charlie Scott convincingly, 104‚Äì84, behind 28 points from Willie McCarter. John proceeded to lead Drake to the 1970 and 1971 NCAA Tournaments as well, and both times led the Bulldogs to the Elite Eight. In the 1970 NCAA Tournament, Drake (22‚Äì7) defeated Coach Guy Lewis and Houston, with Dwight Davis, 92‚Äì87, before losing to New Mexico State 87-78 in the Midwest Regional Final. In the 1971 NCAA Tournament, Drake (21‚Äì8) defeated Notre Dame with Austin Carr 79‚Äì72 in OT, then lost to Kansas 73‚Äì71 in the Midwest Regional Final. His final Drake team averaged 83 points per game before the advent of the three-point shot. John became known for his \\"belly- button\\" defense, in which he pushed his players to stick out their stomachs and play face-to-face. It was noted that John, during that turbulent era was one of the first to hire a black assistant coach and have a black and white player room together in the same hotel room on road trips, even in the deep South. =Iowa State University (1971‚Äì1973)= In 1971, John left Drake to move to nearby Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa. John inherited an Iowa State team that was 5-21 the previous season. \\"I'm sure some of the fans never understood the reasons why he left, or tolerated them,\\" said Paul Morrison, who was Drake's sports information director and business manager during John's tenure. \\"This was a great opportunity for the guy to step up the ladder.\\" Iowa States' Hilton Coliseum was ready to open and John had tired of scheduling conflicts with Veterans Memorial Auditorium, having longed for a campus facility at Drake. He led Iowa State in an improved 12‚Äì14 record in his first season. On Dec. 2, 1971, John coached ISU to a 71‚Äì54 victory over Arizona in the first game played at Hilton Coliseum. In 1972‚Äì73, John led the Cyclones to a 16‚Äì10 record, a 15-year best for Iowa State. However, John's last ever game was played in Des Moines against Drake, and was the first loss of his third season, 61‚Äì60.White, M. (1994, March 20). John still place in Final Four lore. The Des Moines Register. 8‚Äì9. =Illness and death= In the 1973‚Äì74 season, Iowa State was off to a 4‚Äì1 start. John sat out the rest of the 1973‚Äì74 season after a cancer diagnosis. Assistant Gus Guydon (11‚Äì10) finished the season. In October 1973, John had been having trouble sleeping and went to see a doctor. Two months later, on the day Iowa State team lost at Drake, John was told he had an inoperable malignant tumor at the base of his esophagus. \\"It was a bolt out of the blue for someone who lived his life free of smoking or drinking,\\" His son John said later. \\"There was high stress. But he was always healthy.\\" John hoped to return to coaching Iowa State in 1974‚Äì75, but his health worsened. He resigned because of his health on July 30, 1974. John said \\"It's going to be hard for me not to be on that bench. I won't have to sweat out all those games down on the floor. But truthfully, I'd rather be down there sweating them out.\\" John died on October 15, 1974 at the age of 55. During his 28‚Äêyear coaching career, John's teams won 528 games and lost 214. Personal Maury John was married to Jean (d. 2009), and they had two children, John and Maurice Jr. \\"They say a Rolls Royce increases in value the older it gets,\\" said Willie McCarter. \\"That is what Coach John is to us. The more I look back, the more I realize how important he was to our lives. Coach John took racism out of the Drake vocabulary. Coach John made us all take a role,\\" McCarter added. \\"He made everyone feel that without them, the wheel wouldn't go around. He made every spoke in the wheel as important as the other. That made you want to go out and bust your butt for him. I'd give it all up if he could still be here. Selfishly, I've needed to talk to him more than once.\\" ‚ÄúI echo what my teammates have said,‚Äù former player Willie Wise stated. ‚ÄúI'm so appreciative to Maurice John. He came out and got this little kid from San Francisco and brought me to Iowa. I had never been in the Midwest, never been out of California. I owe basically what I am today because of Maurice John and Drake.‚Äù Honors * John is a member of The Des Moines Sunday Register's Iowa Sports Hall of Fame. * John was inducted into the NJCAA Men's Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1984. * John was inducted into the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2000. * The \\"Fitzsimmons-John Arena,\\" (built in 1998) is the arena at Moberly Area Community College.

It is endemic to Madagascar and is also known as the Madagascar banded kestrel, barred kestrel or Madagascar barred kestrel. Its closest relatives are the grey kestrel and Dickinson's kestrel of mainland Africa and the three are sometimes placed in the subgenus Dissodectes. It is 27‚Äì30 cm long with a wingspan of 60‚Äì68 cm. The upperparts are grey and the tail is dark. The underparts are whitish with dark grey streaks on the throat and upper breast and dark grey barring on the lower breast and belly. The feet, eyes and cere are yellow and there is bare yellow skin around the eye. Juvenile birds are browner than the adults with darker eyes and less bare skin around the eye. The species has a shrill, staccato, chattering call and a sharp, screaming call but is usually silent outside the breeding season. It is fairly common in the southern and western parts of Madagascar but more local in the north and east and absent from the central plateau. It occurs from sea level up to 2000 metres. It inhabits clearings and edges in forest and woodland. It rarely hovers, preferring to hunt from a perch. It feeds on small reptiles such as chamaeleons and day geckos, large insects such as grasshoppers and beetles and occasionally on birds. Prey is caught on the ground or snatched from a branch or tree trunk. Breeding takes place from September to December. The nest is a simple scrape, usually in the old nest of another bird, especially the sickle-billed vanga. The nest is located in a tree hole or amongst epiphytic growth. Three yellowish eggs are laid. References *Ferguson-Lees, James & Christie, David A.

The coastal cutthroat trout occurs in four distinct forms. A semi-anadromous or sea-run form is the most well known. Freshwater forms occur in both large and small rivers and streams and lake environments. The native range of the coastal cutthroat trout extends south from the southern coastline of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska to the Eel River in Northern California. Coastal cutthroat trout are resident in tributary streams and rivers of the Pacific basin and are rarely found more than from the ocean. Adults migrate from the ocean to spawn in fresh water. Juveniles migrate to the sea where they feed and become sexually mature before returning to fresh water to overwinter and spawn. Unlike steelhead and Pacific salmon, coastal cutthroat do not make lengthy migrations out to sea. Generally speaking, coastal cutthroat will remain in or near estuarine waters, usually within of their natal stream. Some cutthroat, however, have been shown to move as far as into the open ocean. There are also lacustrine and riverine populations that spend their entire lives in freshwater. One such population is the trout of Lake Crescent in Washington state that was formerly considered to be a separate subspecies called the Lake Crescent cutthroat trout, Oncorhynchus clarkii crescenti. Taxonomy Cutthroat trout were given the name Salmo clarkii in honor of William Clark, who co-led the expedition of 1804‚Äì1806. One of Lewis and Clark's missions was to describe the flora and fauna encountered during the expedition. The type specimen of S. clarki was described by naturalist John Richardson from a tributary of the lower Columbia River, identified as the \\"Katpootl\\", which was perhaps the Lewis River as there was a Multnomah village of similar name at the confluence. This type specimen was most likely the coastal cutthroat subspecies. In 1989, morphological and genetic studies by Gerald R. Smith, the Curator of Fishes at the Museum of Zoology, and Ralph F. Stearley, a doctoral candidate at Museum of Paleontology (University of Michigan) indicated trout of the Pacific basin were genetically closer to Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus species) than to the Salmos-brown trout (S. trutta) or Atlantic salmon (S. salar) of the Atlantic basin. Thus, in 1989, taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow, cutthroat and other Pacific basin trout into the genus Oncorhynchus. Description Freshwater forms of the coastal cutthroat trout are generally dark green to greenish-blue on back, olive-green on upper flank, silvery on lower flank and belly. They display more numerous flank spots below lateral line, irregular spots on dorsal, adipose and caudal fins and the anal, pectoral and pelvic fin bases. The gill covers are pinkish. Sea-run forms while in salt water and shortly after returning to fresh water are silvery with a bluish back, yellowish lower flanks and fins, and display sparse spots. Cutthroats usually display distinctive red, pink, or orange linear marks along the undersides of their mandibles in the lower folds of the gill plates. These markings are responsible for the common name \\"cutthroat\\" given to the trout by outdoor writer Charles Hallock in an 1884 article in The American Angler., although the red slashes are not unique to the cutthroat trout and some coastal rainbow trout and redband trout also display throat slashes. The sea- run forms of coastal cutthroat average , while stream-resident forms attain much smaller sizes . =Lifecycle= Coastal cutthroat trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms. They are native to the alluvial or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific Basin. They typically spawn from December through June, with peak spawning in February. Eggs begin to hatch within six to seven weeks of spawning. Spawning begins when water temperatures reach . Depending on temperature, alevins emerge as fry between March and June, with peak emergence in mid-April. Lake-resident coastal cutthroat trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation for good food production. Lake populations generally require access to gravel-bottomed streams to be self-sustaining, but occasionally spawn on shallow gravel beds with good water circulation. Cutthroat trout naturally interbreed with the closely related rainbow trout, producing fertile hybrids commonly called \\"cutbows\\" although this is a much rarer occurrence with the coastal cutthroat trout because of reproductive isolation as the coastal cutthroat trout is the only cutthroat subspecies to coevolve through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout (O. mykiss irideus). As this hybrid generally bears similar coloration and overall appearance to the cutthroat, retaining the characteristic orange-red slash, these hybrids often pose a taxonomic difficulty. Range and habitat The native range of the coastal cutthroat trout extends south from the southern coastline of the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska to the Eel River in Northern California. Coastal cutthroat trout are resident in tributary streams and rivers of the Pacific basin and are rarely found more than from the ocean. Semi-anadromous, stream resident, fluvial and lake resident forms exist. The great majority of coastal cutthroat trout habitat coincides with the belt of Pacific coast coniferous rainforest that extends from Alaska southward into Northern California. Coastal cutthroat trout use a large variety of habitat types, including lower and upper reaches of both large and small river systems, estuaries, sloughs, ponds, lakes, and near shore ocean waters. They spend more time in fresh water environments than other anadromous Pacific salmonids. In fresh water they prefer deeper pool habitat and cover, such as that formed by woody debris. The semi-anadromous forms of coastal cutthroat trout do not overwinter in saltwater and rarely make extended migrations across large bodies of water. Migrations in the marine environment are usually within of land. Semi-anadromous coastal cutthroat typically spend two to five years rearing in fresh water before making their initial migration into saltwater. Generally, semi-anadromous coastal cutthroat trout spend short periods offshore during summer months and return to estuaries and fresh water by fall or winter. Conservation status The coastal cutthroat is a secure subspecies of the cutthroat trout. Although there has been a general population decline of the sea-run form throughout its native range since the 19th century, none of the populations in the United States or British Columbia are considered threatened or endangered. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in cooperation with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Marine Fisheries Service and state wildlife agencies has designated ten distinct population segments (DPS) from Alaska to California. A comprehensive status review of the DPSs in 1999 determined that only one DPS, the Southwestern Washington/Columbia River DPS be proposed for threatened status under the Endangered Species Act. On July 5, 2002, after lengthy public comment and scientific evaluation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service withdrew its proposal to list the Southwestern Washington/Columbia River DPS as threatened. Stream resident, fluvial and lake forms are secure within their native range and supplemented by stocking of hatchery raised fish in Washington and Oregon.

It stretches along the Zeta river, being wider in river's lower end, down to the confluence with Moraƒça river near Podgorica. The Bjelopavliƒái clan originates from this valley. Bjelopavliƒái was a tribal region part of the Hills (Brda), one of \\"the seven hills\\" (or \\"tribes\\") alongside Vasojeviƒái, Piperi, Kuƒçi, Bratono≈æiƒái, Moraƒçani and Rovƒçani. The region is situated around Danilovgrad. View from Ostrog monastery to Bjelopavliƒái plain Zeta river valley has historically been densely populated, as fertile lowlands are rare in mountainous Montenegro. Confusingly, the other significant plain in Montenegro, Zeta plain has been named after Zeta river, although Zeta river itself does not flow through it. The Bjelopavliƒái plain provided a corridor for road and rail connection between two biggest Montenegrin cities, Podgorica and Nik≈°iƒá. The largest settlement in the plain is the town of Danilovgrad which got name by Prince (Knjaz) Danilo Petroviƒá. History The eponymous founder, Bijeli Pavle (\\"White Paul\\"), is said to have fled Metohija from the Ottomans, and settling in Lu≈°ka ≈æupa (, later known as Zeta). Bjelopavliƒái are first mentioned in a Ragusan document dating to 1411, when they, together with the Malon≈°iƒái, Ozriniƒái and Mazniƒái, had looted a ship of the Republic of Ragusa (from Dubrovnik). According to some sources they are an Albanian tribe.Tea Perinƒçiƒá Mayhew, 2008 Dalmatia Between Ottoman and Venetian Rule: Contado Di Zara, 1645-1718 https://www.academia.edu/860183/Dalmatia_Between_Ottoman_and_Venetian_Rule_Contado_Di_Zara_1645-1718 #page=45Robert Elsie, 2015, The Tribes of Albania: History, Society and Culture, https://books.google.hr/books/about/The_Tribes_of_Albania.html?id=-EzWCQAAQBAJ&redir;_esc=y #page=3 In 1496, the Ottomans conquered the greater part of Zeta and the surrounding area called \\"Hills\\" (Brda), which included the Vasojeviƒái, Bjelopavliƒái, Piperi, Kuƒçi, Bratono≈æiƒái, Moraƒçani and Rovƒçani. The tribe came under the Sanjak of Scutari. The burning of Saint Sava's remains after the Banat Uprising provoked the Serbs in other regions to revolt against the Ottomans. In 1596, an uprising broke out in the Bjelopavliƒái plain, then spread to Drobnjaci, Nik≈°iƒá, Piva and Gacko (see Serb Uprising of 1596‚Äì97). It was suppressed due to lack of foreign support. In 1612 the Sultan sent the son of Mehmet Pasha to Podgorica to tackle the uprisings by the people. The Pasha remained in Podgorica for three months and then decided to ravage Bjelopavliƒái, taking 80 women and children as slaves, setting the village on fire and stealing animals. The males were hiding in other villages and upon the department of the Ottoman soldiers, the tribesmen attacked and killed 300 sipahis with their horses and baggage stolen.Mariano Bolizza In 1613, the Ottomans launched a campaign against the rebel tribes of Montenegro. They reached an agreement with the rebels for 1,000 ducats and 12 slaves. Venetian Mariano Bolizza ( May 1614) recorded that the region was under the command of the Ottoman army in Podgorica. There was 800 armed men of Bjelopavliƒái (), commanded by Neneca Latinoviƒá and Bratiƒç Toma≈°eviƒá. Later that year, the Bjelopavliƒái, Kuƒçi, Piperi, and Kelmend sent a letter to the kings of Spain and France claiming they were independent from Ottoman rule and did not pay tribute to the empire. When Pasha of Herzegovina attack city of Kotor 1657, Albanian tribes of Klimenti and Bjelopavliƒái also participated in this battle In 1774, in the same month of the death of ≈†ƒáepan Mali, Mehmed Pasha Bushati attacked the Kuƒçi and Bjelopavliƒái, but was decisively defeated and returned to Scutari. Prince-Bishop Petar I (r. 1782-1830) waged a successful campaign against the bey of Bosnia in 1819; the repulse of an Ottoman invasion from Albania during the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29) led to the recognition of Montenegrin sovereignty over Piperi.Miller, p. 142 Petar I had managed to unite the Piperi and Bjelopavliƒái with Montenegro, and when Bjelopavliƒái and the rest of the Hills (Seven hills) were joined into Peter's state, a polity officially called \\"Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". A civil war broke out in 1847, in which the Piperi, Kuƒçi, Bjelopavliƒái and Crmnica sought to confront the growing centralized power of new prince of Montenegro; the secessionists were subdued and their ringleaders shot.Miller, p. 144 Amid the Crimean War, there was a political problem in Montenegro; Danilo I's uncle, George, urged for yet another war against the Ottomans, but the Austrians advised Danilo not to take arms.Miller, p. 218 A conspiracy was formed against Danilo, led by his uncles George and Pero, the situation came to its height when the Ottomans stationed troops along the Herzegovinian frontier, provoking the mountaineers. Some urged an attack on Bar, others raided into Herzegovina, and the discontent of Danilo's subjects grew so much that the Piperi, Kuƒçi and Bjelopavliƒái, the recent and still unamalgamated acquisitions, proclaimed themselves an independent state in July, 1854. In Danilo I's Code, dated to 1855, he explicitly states that he is the \\"knjaz (duke, prince) and gospodar (lord) of the Free Black Mountain (Montenegro) and the Hills\\". Danilo was forced to take measurement against the rebels in Brda, some rebels crossed into Ottoman territory and some submitted and were to pay for the civil war they had caused. Knjaz Danilo was assassinated in August, 1860 as he was boarding a ship at the port of Kotor. The assassin, Chief Todor Kadiƒá of the Bjelopavliƒái, was said to be assisted by Austrian authorities in carrying out the assassination. Some speculate that there was a personal feud between the two, the fact that Danilo had an affair with Todor's wife and the ongoing mistreatment of the Bjelopavliƒái tribe by Danilo's guards and his forces. During Nikola I, the Bjelopavlici had bad relations with the rule as a member of the tribe, Andrija Radoviƒá, was sentenced to 15 years in a bombing trial and the trials in 1908-1909 further damaged relations. As an Old Montenegro tribe, the Bjelopavlici support an independent Montenegro. Families All families have the slava of Parascheva of the Balkans (sv.

Unbalance √ó2, also Unbalance Unbalance) is a Korean manhwa series written by Dall-Young Lim and illustrated by Soo-Hyun Lee. The series focuses on Jin-Ho Myung, a high school senior, and his romantic relationship with his homeroom teacher, Hae-Young Nah. The manhwa began biweekly serialization in Young Champ magazine in May 2005, and the first volume was released on June 15, 2005 by Daewon C.I.. The series had a long hiatus following the release of the ninth volume, and resumed serialization in Young Champ from October 2010 to October 2011. The tenth and final volume was released by Daewon C.I. on January 13, 2012. Unbalance Unbalance was licensed in North America by Infinity Studios, and released the first volume on January 11, 2007. A drama CD was released in Japan in September 2009. Story Jin-Ho Myung returns a wallet and cell phone to a beautiful young woman (Hae-Young Nah) in a book shop, little realizing that she would notice that he has already (rather presumptuously) taken 7000 won to buy a book he really wanted. The woman in question is understandably rather upset but decides to consider the money as a loan, which she expects to be paid back. On the first day of the new school year, he learns, to his horror, that the very same woman is to be his new homeroom teacher. The bad news for Jin-Ho is that she remembers their previous encounter very well. After a series of misadventures, Jin-Ho and Hae-Young become friends. Eventually, Jin-Ho confesses his feelings for Hae-Young, who is also attracted to him, but is apprehensive because she is older than him and the fact that she is his teacher. All this happens despite the fact that Ji-Soo (Jin-Ho's classmate and Class President) and Jae-Kyung (Jin-Ho's senior and the founder of the school Film Club) are secretly in love with Jin-Ho. Carrie, Hae-Young's half sister from England enters their lives and makes a move on Jin-Ho to taunt her sister. She quickly understands Jin- Ho's love for Hae-Young and supports them. Hae-Young becomes increasingly conflicted with her feelings for Jin-Ho and dares him to steal her heart by the end of the month, or else she shall leave his life forever. Meanwhile Jae- Kyung breaks up with her boyfriend and resolves to re-enter Jin-Ho's life. She is aware of Hae-Young's love for Jin-Ho and tells her she will steal him. Anguished, Hae-Young admits her love for Jin-Ho who accepts. Currently, Jin-Ho declines Jae-Kyung's confession of love. Jae-Kyung sorrowfully accepts Jin- Ho's decision on loving Hae-Young instead of her. As Jin-Ho leaves the Film Studies Club room, Jae-Kyung cries in total depression. She soon has a mental breakdown, in which she wears her high school uniform and goes back to school, reminiscing her old days as the president of the Film Studies Club and thinking about Jin-Ho. Jin-Ho soon learns about Jae-Kyung's condition and she is rushed to the hospital. In hopes of bringing her back to normal, the doctor suggests Jin-Ho to support and love her in order for her to recover much faster. Hae-Young later meets Jin-Ho and invites him to her house for a date. Jin-Ho, knowing Jae-Kyung's mental condition, abruptly turns her down much to Hae-Young's dismay. Jin-Ho shares his woes to Carrie, stating that while he certainly loves Hae-Young, he cannot abandon Jae-Kyung because of her mental breakdown. Later Carrie reveals the whole situation to Hae-Young. She visits Jin-Ho and tells him she is willing to fulfil his desire. Jin-Ho once more turns her down and Hae-Young angrily breaks up with him. However, she gets upset and starts sobbing. Following her break-up with Jin-Ho, Hae-Young decides to resign from her post after the first semester of school. She decides to leave Jin-Ho's life for good. Ji-Soo later asks if Jin-Ho was aware of this fact and if Jae-Kyung was involved, but Jin-Ho denies the involvement of Jae-Kyung and claims that he no longer loves Hae-Young. Ji-Soo later goes to see Jae-Kyung where she overhears her phone call, saying that she had already recovered. After hearing the phone call, Ji-Soo confronts Jae-Kyung, who claims that she doesn't know Ji-Soo, who beats her out of anger for tricking Jin-Ho. Hae-Young eventually goes to the airport to leave Korea, which she confesses to Caroline that she's happy to be her sister. When she arrives in the UK, she is confronted by Jin-Ho who hands her a device resembling an iPad containing a video message from Jae-Kyung. Jae-Kyung wishes well for Hae-Young and Jin-Ho. Hae-Young tearfully reconciles with Jin-Ho and the two kiss. Characters The characters' original names are shown on the left, while their names from the Japanese version appear on the right. Only Carrie, Ami, and Mi-Na retain their names in both versions. =Main characters= ;Jin-Ho Myung () / : : Jin-Ho is a student in his final year at Arim High School and finds himself a student in Hae-Young's class. Seemingly caring little for schoolwork, he has been known to go to the nurse's office to sleep, watch erotic movies in school, and complete mathematics tests (generally unsuccessfully) using pure guesswork. In middle school, it appears he was something of a delinquent who got into many fights, becoming quite skilled along the way. When it comes to his teachers, friends, or family, he takes their physical abuse and, in most cases, takes the blame and punishments simply because he can (especially early on in the story). This has been a source of concern to his family, or at the very least for his aunt who usually acts more like an older sister than a parent figure. However, he can also become focused if something interests him, like film, which caused him to be the co-founder and eventually the president of the school's Film Studies Club. :He lives with his aunt and father and there are suggestions in the story that he is estranged or separated from his mother, a possible cause for some of his rather more reckless behavior.Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 6, Chapter 42 His sometimes rather cavalier attitude leads him into a number of compromising situations with his teacher. These instances have led Hae-Young to fall in love with him. ;Hae-Young Nah () / : : A beautiful woman in her mid-20s, Hae- Young teaches mathematics at Arim High and also acts as the homeroom teacher for class 3-2. She lives with her sister and niece in an apartment block quite close to Jin-Ho's. Her father's unexpected departure from her life when she was young has had a huge impact on her. Even though she is extremely attractive and was apparently popular (and pursued) throughout her school life, she has become very guarded around men, feeling unable to trust or form relationships with them. Consequently, she is still a virgin and even shares her first kiss with Jin-Ho during the course of the story.Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 3, Chapter 24 She also seems to be following her mother's career path: she was also a teacher and became the district superintendent before retirement.Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 1, Chapter 8 There have been several instances where she acts rather childishly. In one instance, she takes out her (misplaced) anger on Jin-Ho after being reminded of her absentee father by a news article, and she repeatedly slapped him hard enough to give him a nosebleed because he didn't think he should apologize for a prior incident. Despite Hae-Young trying to be strict and meticulous in her work and home life, she has found herself in increasingly compromising and desperate situations with Jin-Ho. Much to her own initial displeasure and continuing discomfort, she finds herself developing increasingly romantic feelings for him, so much that during the course of the MT trip, they kissed several times. =Supporting characters= ;Young-Gi Cha () / : :Jin-Ho's friend and classmate. They have been placed together in the same class for the previous six years. Like his friend, he is skilled at fighting. It has been implied that he likes Ji-Soo; he is very protective of her and careful of how she perceives him. Young-Gi also has a strong sense of justice and, despite his tall, athletic build, prefers to find the most peaceful resolutions to otherwise violent confrontations. His first encounter with Jin-Ho was back in middle school when Jin-Ho, who was a notable delinquent at the time, was harassing another student; the two fought and soon afterwards became close friends. ;Ji-Soo Ha () / : :The senior class president as well as now being the president of the Student Council. She is hardworking, studious, performs well and is also popular. She appears to have liked Jin-Ho ever since her freshmen year of high school, when he helped her make origami flowers. He does not feel the same way towards her, though at one point he does suddenly notice that she is attractive. :In the After Story, Jin-Ho reveals to Hae-Young that he had always suspected Ji-Soo having feelings for him. At one point, Jin-Ho wanted to date her, but kept quiet because he was aware of Young Ki having feelings for Ji-Soo. He admits that if he had actually dated Ji-Soo, he would probably end up betraying her for Hae-Young. ;Ami Eun () / : :She is a senior and a friend of Ji-Soo. She is shy and quiet at school, where she often reads yaoi manhwa. She is one of the first to find out about Hae-Young and Jin-Ho's complicated out-of-school relationship. When Jin-Ho learns that she is the one who told Ji-Soo about his situation with Hae-Young, he attempts to confront her. During this face-off, she threatens to publicly reveal the relationship, which would be likely to get Jin-Ho suspended and, even worse for him, ruin Hae-Young‚Äôs career. She even forces Jin-Ho to kneel in front of her without a second thought so as to exert her power over him, and gets pleasure out of it. She seems to not like men in general, and also appears to dislike Jin-Ho in particular. It transpires that this was an empty threat on Ami's part, since she herself is also in love with Hae-Young; she even tries to force herself on her teacher, who then turns her down. ;Caroline Pendleton ) / : :Nicknamed \\"Carrie\\", she is a Eurasian (half Korean/half British) woman who has recently arrived in Korea. She has lived in the United States for a while, learning the French martial art of savate. She has come to Korea because she is curious about her father's homeland and her siblings, who turn out to be Hae-Young and Hae-Jung. When she first arrives, she lives in a temporarily motel while her father arranges for her to stay with her half-sisters for about a month. She has been employed at Arim High as an English teacher and an assistant homeroom teacher under Hae-Young. It is revealed by Hae-Jung that her Korean name is Hae-Eun Nah. Whether she changed her name while living in America or while living in Britain remains unknown.Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 6, Chapter 41 :Her first encounter with Jin-Ho, like her half-sister's, is not entirely without its troubles, ending in a fight and injury (which she somehow gave herself as Jin-Ho did not actually hit her) for her. Her opinion of Jin-Ho changes however when he escorts her back to her motel room and shows concern for her well-being. As she has no full siblings, she appears to harbor a strong desire for a warm relationship with her half-sisters, though this is complicated somewhat by their rather cold and distant relationship with their father. She expresses great romantic interest in Jin-Ho and has challenged Hae-Young Nah to see who can first win his heart. Although this was originally just a ploy to provoke her half-sister, Jin-Ho's rather chivalrous inner nature made her realize she might actually fall for him. She spends the remainder of the Manhwa supporting Jin-Ho and Hae-Young's romance. ;Jae-Kyung Park () / : :She is a college freshman and a friend of Jin-Ho's. In her high school days (where it is revealed she had short hair), she was the co-founder and former president of the Film Studies Club (now passed on to Jin-Ho) as well as the former president of the Student Council (which is now succeeded by Ji-Soo). Even though she flirts with him, Jin-Ho feels comfortable enough with her to confide his girl problems to her. There are also hints that Jin-Ho may have had rather deeper feelings for her while she was in high school,Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 1, Chapter 7 and seems that Jin-Ho has been rather more distant with girls since she left.Unbalance Unbalance; Volume 1, Chapter 1 There are implications that Jae-Kyung has romantic inclinations towards Jin- Ho, most prominent when she breaks up with her boyfriend and seeking out Jin- Ho for comfort, and acts very coldly towards Hae-Young after she finds out he was waiting for her. Caroline even states that Jae-Kyung is one of Hae-Young's rivals. :It is later revealed that long before Hae-Young's arrival, Jin-Ho was best friends with Jae-Kyung and had a crush on her. Jae-Kyung initially didn't return his feelings, but afterwards she secretly changed her mind. Before graduating from high-school, Jae-Kyung tried to seduce Jin-Ho, but he rejected the idea, because he was interested in a meaningful relationship and not an affair. The two parted ways but remained good friends. :Afterwards, Jae-Kyung dated a guy but later broke up with him and decides to have a proper relationship with Jin-Ho. She is displeased to discover that Jin-Ho is in love with Hae-Young. Jae-Kyung threatens to steal Jin-Ho from Hae-Young, prompting the latter to desperately confess her love for Jin-Ho. Jin-Ho meets Jae-Kyung to politely decline her feelings and leaves. Jae-Kyung is devastated and develops temporary anterogade amnesia. Feeling responsible for her, Jin-Ho is forced to break up with Hae-Young. Jae-Kyung recovers but decides not to tell Jin-Ho so that he will accept her affections. Ji-Soo discovers Jae-Kyung's ploy and starts slapping her for deceiving Jin-Ho. Jae-Kyung relents and allows Jin-Ho to reunite with Hae-Young. Media =Manhwa= Unbalance Unbalance began biweekly serialization in Daewon C.I.'s Young Champ magazine on May 30, 2005. The first bound volume was released in South Korea on June 25, 2005 under their Young Comics imprint, and sold ten volumes until January 13, 2012, spanning 82 chapters throughout its run. The series had a long hiatus following the release of the ninth volume, and resumed serialization in Young Champ from October 5, 2010 to October 1, 2011. The manhwa was licensed in North America by Infinity Studios, and released two volumes of the series between January 11, 2007 and December 12, 2007 prior to its closure. Unbalance Unbalance has been licensed for international releases in a number of languages. It is licensed in France by Tokebi, in Hong Kong, Macau and in China by Asia Comics, in Russia by Comics Factory, and in Japan by Kill Time Communication, where it was serialized in Comic Valkyrie from the November 2010 issue (published on September 27, 2010) to the January 2012 issue (published on November 28, 2011). The Japanese releases feature unique cover art designs and uncensored scenes, as well as being localized to better suit Japanese readers. In a Japanese interview with Dall-Young Lim, the author of the series, he claims the reasons for the unedited scenes is due to Korea's stricter censorship policy keeping him from doing so. He also claims he has much more freedom in terms of mature content with the Japanese version than with the Korean version. =Drama CD= A drama CD produced by Indies Mega was released in Japan on September 26, 2009. It featured Tomokazu Sugita and Kikuko Inoue as the voices of Kenichi Kando (Jin-Ho Myung) and Elina Takanashi (Hae-Young Nah), respectively. Sequel A spin-off sequel was serialized, exploring Jin-Ho and Hae-Young's relationship after reconciliation. Jin-Hi and Ji-Soo pretend to date to prevent Hae-Young from being suspected. It ends with Jin-Ho and Hae-Young reaffirming to continue their relationship.

In most systems, a parent process can create an independently executing child process. The parent process may then issue a wait system call, which suspends the execution of the parent process while the child executes. When the child process terminates, it returns an exit status to the operating system, which is then returned to the waiting parent process. The parent process then resumes execution. Modern operating systems also provide system calls that allow a process's thread to create other threads and wait for them to terminate (\\"join\\" them) in a similar fashion. An operating system may provide variations of the wait call that allow a process to wait for any of its child processes to exit, or to wait for a single specific child process (identified by its process ID) to exit. Some operating systems issue a signal (SIGCHLD) to the parent process when a child process terminates, notifying the parent process and allowing it to retrieve the child process's exit status. The exit status returned by a child process typically indicates whether the process terminated normally or abnormally. For normal termination, this status also includes the exit code (usually an integer value) that the process returned to the system. During the first 20 years of UNIX, only the low 8 bits of the exit code have been available to the waiting parent. In 1989 with SVR4, a new call waitid has been introduced that returns all bits from the exit call in a structure called siginfo_t in the structure member si_status. Waitid is a mandatory part of the POSIX standard since 2001. Zombies and orphans When a child process terminates, it becomes a zombie process, and continues to exist as an entry in the system process table even though it is no longer an actively executing program. Under normal operation it will typically be immediately waited on by its parent, and then reaped by the system, reclaiming the resource (the process table entry). If a child is not waited on by its parent, it continues to consume this resource indefinitely, and thus is a resource leak. Such situations are typically handled with a special \\"reaper\\" process that locates zombies and retrieves their exit status, allowing the operating system to then deallocate their resources. Conversely, a child process whose parent process terminates before it does becomes an orphan process. Such situations are typically handled with a special \\"root\\" (or \\"init\\") process, which is assigned as the new parent of a process when its parent process exits. This special process detects when an orphan process terminates and then retrieves its exit status, allowing the system to deallocate the terminated child process. If a child process receives a signal, a waiting parent will then continue execution leaving an orphan process behind. Hence it is sometimes needed to check the argument set by wait, waitpid or waitid and, in the case that WIFSIGNALED is true, wait for the child process again to deallocate resources.

Absent an outbreak, case definitions are used in the surveillance of public health in order to categorize those conditions present in a population (e.g., incidence and prevalence). How are they used A case definition defines a case by placing limits on time, person and place.https://www.cs.columbia.edu/digigov/LEXING/CDCEPI/gloss.html Time criteria may include all cases of a disease identified from, for example, January 1, 2008 to March 1, 2008. Person criteria may include age, gender, ethnicity, and clinical characteristics such as symptoms (e.g. cough and fever) and the results of clinical tests (e.g. pneumonia on chest X-ray). Place criteria will usually specify a geographical entity such as a town, state, or country, but may be as small as an institution, a school class, or a restaurant meal session. Case definitions are often used to label individuals as suspect, probable, or confirmed cases. For example, in the investigation of an outbreak of pneumococcal pneumonia in a nursing home the case definition may be specified as: *Suspect Case: All residents of Nursing Home A with onset of cough and fever between January 1, 2008 and February 1, 2008. *Probable Case: Meet the suspect case definition plus have pneumonia on chest X-ray. *Confirmed Case: Meet the probable case definition plus have pneumococcal infection confirmed by blood culture or other isolation of pneumococci from normally sterile site. By creating a case definition, public health professionals are better equipped to study an outbreak and determine possible causes. As investigations proceed, a case definition may be expanded or narrowed, a characteristic of the dynamic nature of outbreak investigations. At any given time, the case definition is supposed to be the gold standard to diagnose a given disease. A sensitive case definition, often applied early in an outbreak,https://wiki.ecdc.europa.eu/fem/w/wiki/sensitivity-and- specificity-of-a-case-definition.aspx will capture all cases, but will include many non-cases. A specific case definition, usually applied after the outbreak is considered more well understood, will exclude most non-cases, but will also exclude some actual cases. Diagnostic criteria The term diagnostic criteria designates a case definition with a specific combination of signs, symptoms, and test results that the clinician uses to attempt to determine the correct diagnosis. Some examples of diagnostic criteria are: *Amsterdam criteria for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer *McDonald criteria for multiple sclerosis *ACR criteria for systemic lupus erythematosus *Centor criteria for strep throat Clinical definitions When diagnostic criteria are universally accepted they can be considered a \\"clinical definition\\" because they define the limits of the affected population, determining which patients are inside and outside of the set. A clinical definition should be regarded as a statistical analysis tool, and not a substitute for a pathological definition when this is required.Jos√© Roberto Lambertucci, Revisiting the concept of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and its challenges using traditional and new tools, Rev.

His brother was the tenor Italo Campanini. Biography Born in Parma, Italy on 1 September 1860, Campanini studied music at that city's conservatory, making his debut with a performance of Carmen, also in Parma, in 1883. That year he was invited to New York City during the inaugural season of the Metropolitan Opera, and was offered a position as assistant conductor with the company. Five years later he returned to the United States to lead the American premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's Otello at the Academy of Music. Desdemona was sung by Eva Tetrazzini, who Campanini had married in 1887. He conducted at the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos, Lisbon, between 1888 and 1903 where he conducted, among others, the premieres of Augusto Machado's Mario Wetter (1898) and Alfredo Keil's Serrana (1899) (considered the best Portuguese opera) with Eva Tetrazzini in the leading roles. Campanini conducted at La Scala for three years, where he conducted the premiere of Puccini's Madama Butterfly in 1904. In 1906 he was appointed artistic director of the newly formed Manhattan Opera Company. He stayed there for three years before resigning over artistic disagreements with the company's manager, Oscar Hammerstein I. In 1910 he became the first conductor of the Chicago Grand Opera Company at the Auditorium Theatre, remaining there until his death; he brought the company with him in 1918 to New York for a four-week season that included Amelita Galli-Curci's first appearance in the city. He was initiated as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity in 1917. From 1915 to his death in 1919, Campanini was artistic director and principal conductor of the Chicago Opera Association. Campanini was known for his association with French opera, and introduced numerous works to the United States; these included H√©rodiade, I gioielli della Madonna, Louise, Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Monna Vanna, Jules Massenet's Sapho and Tha√Øs. Campanini died at St. Luke's Hospital in Chicago, Illinois on 19 December 1919 of pneumonia. References Further reading *Francisco Fonseca Benevides, \\"O Real Thetro de S.

Description  Adults are blue-grey on the upperparts with white underparts, with a long slender bill and a long black tail with white outer tailbands on the uppertail. The undertail is extensively white, showing black only along a thin vertical center line and at the very tip. Males show a prominent black cap. This species is very similar to the California gnatcatcher and the black-tailed gnatcatcher. Their breeding habitat occurs in riparian woodlands of western and northwestern Mexico. It has occasionally nested just across the border in southernmost Arizona, (the Madrean sky islands area), of the United States where it is infrequently found in the summer. They build a small cup nest most often in a horizontal limb of a small tree or shrub. Both parents construct the nest and feed the young. The female normally lays 4 eggs. These birds are primarily non-migratory, remaining in breeding territories year round. They forage actively in trees or shrubs, mainly eating insects. They may hover over foliage-(gleaning), or fly to catch insects in flight-(hawking).

The club was founded in 1975 and currently competes in the Montenegrin Third League. History Founded in 1975, FK Bratstvo is a second football team from the territory of Urban Municipality of Golubovci (part of Podgorica Capital). Oldest and much successful is FK Zeta. From their beginnings, FK Bratstvo played in the Fourth League - Central, but without any significant results during the SFR Yugoslavia era. Their first biggest success came during the 1995‚Äì96 season. FK Bratstvo won the title in the Fourth League and gained its first-ever promotion to Montenegrin Republic League.'Crnogorski klubovi u fudbalskim takmiƒçenjima 1946-2016', Podgorica, 2016. The team spent 10 consecutive seasons in Republic League. During that time, at February 2003, FK Bratstvo made biggest result on one single game, by eliminating strongest Montenegrin side FK Buduƒánost from Montenegrin Republic Cup first round. After Montenegrin independence, FK Bratstvo became a member of Montenegrin Second League. From 2007, the team was moved from the old stadium in Cijevna village to neighbouring Ljajkoviƒái. All the time since 2006, FK Bratstvo spent in Second League. Historical results of FK Bratstvo came on seasons 2009-10 and 2015-16, when the team finished at third place, which gained them playoffs for First League. On 2009‚Äì10 First League playoffs, FK Bratstvo lost against FK Mornar (0‚Äì1; 1‚Äì2). Six years after that, Bratstvo lost another chance for historical First League promotion, after 2015-16 playoff games against FK Iskra (2‚Äì2; 0‚Äì6). On season 2016‚Äì17, FK Bratstvo finished as a last-placed team. So, after 11 consecutive seasons in the Second League, they were relegated to the third- tier competition.

He played playsas a striker and winger. Club career =Santiago Wanderers= His childhood was spent in the Cerro Toro of Valpara√≠so then was enrolled in Santiago Wanderers at an early age. His debut as a professional was on the 1998 season. During the 1998 season, Santiago Wanderers had a team with many talented players but at that same season his team dropped to the second division of Chilean football. During the 1999 season, like the previous season, he did not have the chance to play since the time the team had a particularly good goal scoring figure in Reinaldo Navia. The following year and back in the first division he began to consider several offers for different teams and began to assert himself. In 2001, the Santiago Wanderers made several changes and Joel became stronger in front of the post holder and with much more experience, he started to become a figure alongside other players like Jaime Riveros, Moises Villarroel and Silvio Fernandez. During this season he was called to be in part of the roster for the national team sub-20 to compete in the under-20 World Cup but the bitter fact was that he and along with other teammates, was involved in an act of indiscretion, which led to his demotion to be trained with a lesser team. Once he came back with the Santiago Wanderers, he became one of the leader scores which resulted in a world championship place for his team, the first one for Santiago Wanderers in 33 years. During the 2002 season for the first time in his career he disputed an international cup, the Copa Libertadores, where his team was eliminated in the first round but achieving good results versus the current champion, Boca Juniors, a tie in Argentina and a victory in Chile were crucial for Soto. In the same 2002 season, Soto continued playing for Santiago Wanderers for the national championship and scoring more goals, rumors emerged from people linked to big national football clubs like Club Am√©rica and Boca Juniors, and even a team from France. In that same year, he also achieved playing for the first time in the Copa Sudamericana where he reached the quarterfinals. Everything was achieved during this season which earned him a spot on the roster for the adult national team playing in some practice games. Finally, despite all the rumors about his departure from Santiago Wanderers nothing was finalized in particular because of the problems with the leadership and continuous playing for the love of the club, he even went into a tournament for the first time, he was elected by his peers as team captain. =Mexico= After so many rumors about his transfer finally in mid-2003 is transferred to Mexican soccer to Chiapas earlier in the tournament had been descended. Yet the Jaguars could not achieve a good performance, it was no longer the same as playing at Santiago Wanderers, on this table Buenos Aires wanted to have it back for the 2004 season but the economic gap could not make it succeed, and that Soto had no intentions of returning to Chilean football because it cost a lot for going abroad. Despite its low yield, their calls to the selection were not integrated and the preparation of the Selection Sub pre-23 to compete in pre-Olympic to be held in Chile. =Return to Chile= During the tournament pre Sudamerican Sub-23 in Chile, Soto wished for his return to Chile but this time not played by Santiago Wanderers, he took part in the Chile's most popular soccer club, Colo-Colo. Soto came to the club for six months on loan as a reinforcement for the Copa Libertadores in 2004 where they failed to pass through to the first round. Colo-Colo was unable to pay him well and in nine matches where only two single achievements were made before his former club, Santiago Wanderers. To this day, he is playing for Uni√≥n La Calera.

In 1851 he earned his doctorate from the University of Giessen, and in 1859 he became a professor and prosector at the University of Halle. In 1876 he succeeded Alfred Wilhelm Volkmann (1801‚Äì1877) as director of the anatomical institute at Halle. Along with his anatomical duties, Welcker was also a specialist in the fields of anthropology, ethnology, microscopy and biology. He published numerous articles on each of these subjects. In 1854 he devised a method for measuring blood volume in humans and animals. He also devised a method for measuring red blood cell volume. The eponymous \\"Welcker's angle\\" is named after him, which is the anterior, inferior angle of the parietal bone. He is also credited with starting the first permanent study of fingerprint patterns over time. He recorded his right hand print in 1856 and 1897, publishing a study in 1898.Wilder, H.

History Garlando was founded officially in 1954 at Spinetta Marengo - a small village near Alessandria - by Renato Garlando, the father of the present managing director, already in the market for the production of various wood objects. An activity that he, in his turn, had inherited from his father. Following the success of table football, originating in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s, and later the United States, Spain and France, Renato Garlando decided to produce them for the Italian market, where he had unexpected success. From then on, the company continuously grew. Foreign countries were added to the domestic revenue, including overseas to the United States, where the Garlando football tables experienced a boom in the 1970s. During this time, Garlando began manufacturing pool tables with the same domestic success as with table football equipment. In the course of the 1980s, the current managing director, Giuseppe Garlando, took the lead and, with his brother Marino, began renovating the working procedures which, from still largely craftsmanlike, became industrialised and standardised. In the same period the factory dimensions enlarged, the number of the employees increased, while they become more and more skilled, new computerised machinery is purchased to reach the utmost precision in the output, new foreign markets are open on which Garlando soon becomes a leader. In the 1990s, the North Africa and Eastern Europe markets were tapped, and the product range was expanded to meet the requirements of new segments of public. To meet more and more urgent production requirements, late in 2002 the company left Spinetta Marengo to move to their much more modern premises at Pozzolo Formigaro, near Novi Ligure, a dozen kilometres from the old site. The company now covers a 10,000 square metre area, equipped with the most modern machines to work the wood as well as to mould the plastic. The new location employs over 60 people, both for the office and the factory.

It relates how, accused of conspiring to kill Gamal Abdel Nasser, the president of Egypt, in 1965, the author was arrested and imprisoned. While awaiting trial, she was subjected to torture. Return of the Pharaoh describes the ordeal which this Muslim activist went through in the notorious Egyptian prison. Instead of dampening her enthusiasm for Islam and the Islamic movement, her prison experiences increased her commitment and dedication to the cause of Islam. This autobiographical work can be considered a historic document in that its author was an active witness to one of the most volatile periods of Egypt's contemporary history. Author Zaynab Al-Ghazali Al-Jubaili was born in Egypt in 1917. At the age of twenty, she formed a major women's charitable organization which rendered service to the poor, orphans and the underprivileged. Although she had acquaintance with Shaikh Hasan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood (al-Ikhwan al-Muslimun), since the late 1930s and actively participated in many Islamic programmes, she formally joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1948. After the assassination of Hassan al- Banna in 1949, she played a major role in the re-organization of the Muslim Brotherhood. She was arrested in 1965 for an alleged conspiracy to kill Gamal Abdel Nasser and overthrow his government. She was released from prison in 1971 during Anwar Sadat's presidency. In addition to being very active in Da'wah work, Zainab al Ghazali has been a prolific writer, contributing regularly to major Islamic journals and periodical. Her latest book is a two- volume study on the Tafsir of the Qur'an.

Recognition of a cluster depends on its size being seen as greater than would be expected by the play of chance. Identification of a suspected disease cluster may initially depend on anecdotal evidence. Epidemiologists and biostatisticians need to assess whether the suspected cluster corresponds to an actual increase of disease in the area. Typically, when clusters are recognized, they are reported to public health departments in the local area. If clusters are of sufficient size and importance, they may be re-evaluated as outbreaks. John Snow's pioneering investigation of the 1854 cholera outbreak in Soho, London, is seen as a classic example of the study of such a cluster.

Biography =Early life= Busch was born in Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire in England. When he was age 13, he apprenticed to Craggs & Sons of Middlesbrough, and at the age of 20 was employed as a draftsman while studying naval architecture at night. He relocated to Ulster, Northern Ireland in 1888, where he served as draftsman- in-charge at the Harland and Wolff shipyards in Belfast until 1892. =Career in the United States= In January 1892, Busch emigrated to the United States, and was employed as a draftsman at William Cramp & Sons Shipbuilders in Philadelphia. He was a longtime member of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers (SNAME) which became organized in 1893 in the state of New Jersey. In 1895, Busch moved to Elizabethport, New Jersey, where he was the shipyard superintendent at Lewis Nixon's Crescent Shipyard This shipyard is where the United States Navy's first submarines were built under Busch's supervision beginning in the late fall of 1896. Busch worked in unison with John Philip Holland to design and build the pioneering , also known as the Holland VI design. This was the first commissioned submarine in the United States Navy, and purchased by the American Government on April 11, 1900 ‚Äì a day later commemorated by the United States submarine community as \\"Submarine Day\\". Holland's company was then known as the Holland Torpedo Boat Company - the forerunner and precursor to the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation. The United States government then ordered more submarines after the successful trials and purchase of Holland VI. These submarines were known as the A class or . A prototype was constructed under Busch's direction at the Crescent Shipyard in the year 1900. This submarine craft was called Fulton, named after the American steamship pioneer Robert Fulton. However, Fulton was never commissioned into U. S. Navy service and was sold to the Imperial Russian Navy in 1905 for use in the Russo-Japanese War against the Empire of Japan. =Career in Japan= After Crescent Shipyard lost the contract from the US Navy for the B-class submarines, Busch was offered a position by Isaac Leopold Rice with Electric Boat Company, which had received a contract from Japan for the construction of five Type VII submarines for the Imperial Japanese Navy. These vessels were built at the company‚Äôs Fore River Shipyards in Quincy, Massachusetts. Busch oversaw construction of the vessels, their dismantling, transport to Seattle by rail, shipment to Yokohama and reassembly at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Yokosuka, Japan. The project was done in complete secrecy, as the United States was officially neutral in the Russo- Japanese War. The entire project was completed in twelve months, and Busch was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, 4th class by Emperor Meiji. Rheocities biography =Subsequent career= After returning from Japan, Busch returned to work for Lewis Nixon as manager of the United States Shipbuilding Company in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. In 1909, Busch established the American Architectural Shipbuilding and Development Company, and proposed designed for miniature submarines to the Japanese government. The venture was not a success and Busch went to work for the New Jersey Drydock Company in Elizabeth, New Jersey and was later shipyard manager for the Moore Shipyards of the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Company, and advisor to the president of Eureka Shipyards in Newburg, New York. During his long career, Busch was responsible for the design and development of many ship classes for the United States Navy and contributed to their production at some of the country's largest shipyards through both World Wars. He retired in 1941, and died on 9 March 1956. After World War I, Busch changed his last name to Du Busc in 1919 - this was most probably due to the large amount of anti-German sentiment that existed in the United States during that time though his family lineage was of Huguenot origins.

The race winners The 1908 New York to Paris Race was an automobile competition consisting of drivers attempting to travel from New York to Paris. This was a considerable challenge given the state of automobile technology and road infrastructure at the time. Only three of six contestants completed the course. The winner was the American team, driving a 1907 Thomas Flyer. In 1907 the Peking to Paris automobile race had inspired an even bolder test of these new machines. The following year the course would be from New York City, USA, to Paris, France, with a planned ship passage from Nome, Alaska, across the Bering Strait to East Cape, Siberia.London Daily Mail, 1908. The 1908 New York to Paris Race The race, which was the first of its kind among automobiles, commenced in Times Square on February 12, 1908. Six cars representing four nations were at the starting line for what would become a 169-day ordeal (making it, in terms of time taken, still the longest motorsport event ever held). Germany, France, Italy, and the United States participated, with the Protos representing Germany, a Zust representing Italy, three cars (De Dion-Bouton, Motobloc, and Sizaire-Naudin) representing France, and a Thomas Flyer representing the United States. At 11:15 AM a gunshot signaled the start of the race. Ahead of the competitors were very few paved roads, and in many parts of the world no roads at all. Often, the teams resorted to straddling locomotive rails with their cars riding tie to tie on balloon tires for hundreds of miles when no roads could be found. The American Thomas Flyer was in the lead after crossing the United States and arriving in San FranciscoSchuster & Mahoney. The Longest Auto Race (New York: The John Day Company 1966), p.71. in 41 days, 8 hours, and 15 minutes. It was the first crossing of the US by an automobile in winter. The route then took them to Valdez, Alaska, by ship. Then Thomas crew found impossible conditions in Alaska and the race was rerouted across the Pacific by steamer to Japan where the Americans made their way across to the Sea of Japan. Then it was on to Vladivostok, Siberia, by ship to begin crossing the continents of Asia and Europe. Only three of the competitors made it past Vladivostok: the Protos, the Z√ºst, and the Flyer. The wet plains of Siberia and Manchuria during the spring thaw made progress difficult. At several points, forward movement was often measured in feet rather than miles per hour. Eventually, the roads improved as Europe approached and the Thomas arrived in Paris on July 30, 1908, to win, having covered approx 16,700 km. The Germans, driven by Hans Koeppen, arrived in Paris four days earlier, but had been penalized a total of 30 days for not going to Japan and for shipping the Protos part of the way by railcar. That gave the win to the Americans with George Schuster (the only American to go the full distance from New York to Paris)Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877-1925 (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.115. by 26 days (still the largest winning margin in any motorsport event ever). The Italians arrived later in September 1908. The race was of international interest with daily front page coverage by The New York Times (a cosponsor of the race with the Parisian newspaper Le Matin). The significance of the event extended far beyond the race itself. Together with the Peking to Paris race which took place the year before it established the reliability of the automobile as a dependable means of transportation, eventually taking the automobile from an amusement of the rich to a reliable and viable means of long distance transportation for the masses. It also led to the call for improved roads to be constructed in many parts of the world. The winning driver George Schuster was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame on October 12, 2010. The winning Thomas Flyer is on display in Reno, Nevada, at the National Automobile Museum, alongside the trophy.

In the 1930s, Graf's moved to S. 41st Street and W. Greenfield Ave. in West Milwaukee. In the early years, Graf then formed his own company, Graf Beverages, which produced a variety of soft drinks. Graf continued to brew soft drinks, but his root beer is remembered the most. Graf's image is still on the can of root beer. His legacy was passed onto his son after his death in 1930, when his daughter, Sylvia Graf, assumed presidency of the company. When she died in 1963, Lawrie O. Graf took over the company. Lawrie Graf was known for his creative engineering skills and his education in chemistry at Marquette University, and helped the company achieve a national status. Lawrie Graf continued to run the company until 1968, when he sold the company to P & V Atlas. P & V Atlas sold Graf products to Canada Dry, which, in turn, sold Graf to A. J. Canfield in 1984.

She performed on saxophone, vibes, piano, and vocals. In the 1930s and 1940s Gilbert and her band performed in the most famous nightclubs in Hollywood, including the Cocoanut Grove. At one of these clubs, she met and fell in love with Kay Boley, a vaudevillian and contortionist. During this period, she appeared in films, toured Alaska with a USO troupe, and began to be an advocate for women musicians. After a difficult period following the Second World War, in the 1950s Gilbert had success on radio and television programs. In 1974, at 69 years old, she created her last great all- female band, The Dixie Belles, with musicians from vaudeville and the Big Band era. The group performed on TV and at jazz festivals, appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and in the 1980 Rose Bowl Parade. In 1985 the band recorded the album Peggy Gilbert & the Dixie Belles. Gilbert lived until the age of 102 and died in Burbank, California. Life and career =Early years= Peggy Gilbert was born Margaret Fern Knechtges Gilbert on January 17, 1905, in Sioux City, Iowa. Her father, John Darwin Knechtges, played in theater pit bands in Sioux City as a violinist, and her mother, Edith Ella Gilbert, sang for the opera house in Sioux City. Gilbert \\"was raised to respect all types of music and to love all kinds of music\\". She began to take piano lessons at age eight, and frequently accompanied her father to stage shows, playing piano in her first performance with his band. Gilbert lived in a nurturing home environment. She and her brother Oral Lloyd Knechtges, who was born in 1900, were always encouraged to listen to music, and they lived a very comfortable life. In addition, her parents did not tolerate prejudice, and they \\"learned right from the beginning to treat everyone with respect and consideration, regardless of race or ethnicity.\\" Gilbert admired her father and his musical ability and took much of her inspiration from him. At age seven, Gilbert landed her first professional job as a dancer for the touring group of the Scottish cultural ambassador Sir Henry Lauder. She and six other young girls toured Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, and Iowa, performing the Highland Fling dance. From a young age, Gilbert was aware of the injustice that came along with gender preference, and she learned that she would have to work hard in order to achieve what she wanted. For example, although her brother Orval encouraged her in her studies, she realized that people treated him differently; she was very aware of the fact that she was \\"just a girl.\\" Gilbert attended Sioux City High School where she took secretarial courses, as well as weekly piano lessons. When she graduated in 1923, she attended Morningside College for six months before leaving and going into the music business. Part of this decision was based on the fact that in the 1920s, her father became ill, so Gilbert was needed to help support her parents. At this time, she self-taught herself the alto saxophone, as she was told it was not suitable for young women, and joined the Musicians Union in Sioux City. =The Melody Girls= Gilbert organized her first band in Sioux City, a group that was composed of Gilbert on the saxophone and clarinet, Marjorie Kelley on piano, Dorothy Kelley on banjo and accordion, Orval Knechtges on drums, Ruth Dubnoff on violin, and two other men on trumpet and bass. The Melody Girls, also formed in Sioux City, was made up of five or six pieces and was formed with some of the musicians from her first band. The band played all around the city, in all of the clubs, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Martin Hotel, where they played for two years and were broadcast every night on the local radio station KSCJ. When Gilbert's father died in November 1927, she decided she needed to start a career in the entertainment business in order to support her mother and grandmother. In 1928, the family moved to Los Angeles but had to return to Sioux City to help a suddenly widowed Orval. The family, now including Orval and his children, all moved to Los Angeles with Gilbert. The move to Los Angeles, and the promise of fame, prompted Gilbert to adopt her mother's maiden name because \\"Knechtges\\" (kuh-NET-chiz) was too difficult to pronounce. At this time, there wasn't too much competition in Los Angeles because women jazz musicians were still finding their place in the business. Gilbert's first job in the city was with the vaudeville performers Irene Franklin and Juanita Connors. =Fanchon and Marco= In 1928, Gilbert auditioned for the vaudeville producers Fanchon \\"Fanny\\" Wolff Simon and Marco \\"Mike\\" Wolff, first touring with Rudy Wiedoeft and a sextet of saxophone players in a show titled \\"Saxophobia Idea.\\" The show opened in October 1928 in Los Angeles, and toured San Diego, Hollywood, San Francisco, Salem, Seattle, Denver, Buffalo, Hartford, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, and many other cities. The tour was very well received and widely covered by the press. After the \\"Saxophobia\\" tour, Gilbert returned to Hollywood. She spent the spring and summer of 1929 as a saxophone player for an all-female group performing at El Mirador Hotel in Palm Springs. In October 1929, Gilbert performed in another Fanchon and Marco tour, the \\"Jazz Temple Idea.\\" This yearlong tour helped Gilbert provide for her mother through the stock market crash of 1929. The show, which followed the same itinerary as the \\"Saxophobia\\" tour, was considered \\"a novelty.\\" The next Fanchon and Marco tour in which Gilbert performed was the \\"Busy Bee Idea,\\" a tour that traveled through the United States and Canada in 1930 and 1931. After this tour, Gilbert returned to Los Angeles, where she was doing studio work for MGM. =Early 1930s= By the end of the \\"Busy Bee\\" tour, the Great Depression was in full swing, and it was much more difficult to earn a living in show business. Gilbert started promoting herself as a bandleader, using connections to appear in several movies with her all-female band. They appeared as sideliners and usually did not receive screen credit, so it's hard to know exactly how many films they appeared in at MGM. However, Gilbert began promoting the band as Peggy Gilbert and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Girls. Known film appearances include Politics (1931), Wet Parade (1932), and That's My Boy (1932). In 1932, Gilbert traveled throughout California, taking up various jobs with various bands. During this time, Gilbert made sure her bands were heard on the radio because she knew it would build them an audience. They were broadcast both live from nightclubs and ballrooms and from the radio stations. In 1933, Gilbert joined Boots and Her Buddies. She traveled with them for about three months, then returned to Los Angeles, where the rest of the women from the band joined her a few months later. With their arrival in May 1933, Gilbert saw the opportunity to form her own big band. The band played in Las Vegas and at all of the major theater chains in the area: Warner Bros. Theaters, Pantages Theaters, and West Coast Theaters. In October 1933, Gilbert took her band to Hawaii with E.K. Fernandez, the man who began the entertainment business in Hawaii in 1903. After the band returned from Hawaii in 1934, there were plenty of jobs available for musicians in Los Angeles. Gilbert always had a gig lined up for the band, and they played in popular nightclubs all over L.A., including the Cocoanut Grove at the Ambassador Hotel, the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, and the Club New Yorker. =Late 1930s= The Hollywood music scene continued to flourish in 1935, despite the Great Depression. Gilbert and her band played in clubs and ballrooms all over Hollywood, San Diego, and Southern California. They also took over the radio, as they were broadcast over KFWB, KFOX, and KFXM. They played on KFOX regularly, according to radio listings, and performed regularly at the Italian Village in Los Angeles during the cocktail hour primetime. These radio performances and club gigs led to Gilbert's continued popularity in the mid-1930s. In March 1936, the band performed at the 41 Club's 35th anniversary celebration, the Annual Dinner Dance of the California Yacht Club, and the Albert Sheetz Circus Caf√©. The band at this point consisted of Kathleen McArtor on drums, Bunny Hart on guitar, Mable Hicks on trumpet, Caryl Agnew on piano, and Gilbert on saxophone. These performances were \\"rated tops as exponents of modern harmony and swing rhythm.\\" In 1937, the band played at the Zenda Dance Caf√© in Los Angeles five nights a week and appeared in the Second Hollywood Swing Concert at The Palomar. They were considered \\"one of the finest bands of its type in the country.\\" In January 1938, Gilbert and her band returned to the Zenda Ballroom, where their two-week contract ended up extending to two years. The band continued to play in films during this time. They appeared in Melody for Two (1937), The Great Waltz (1938), Rhythm of the Saddle (1938) and Reckless Living (1938). In 1939, Gilbert and her band continued to be featured in many clubs and events, including the New Hollywood Caf√© and the 15th Annual Policemen's Ball in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1939 and 1940, the band was broadcast on KMPC as \\"The Early Girls and Three Chirps.\\" The group did the regular morning and afternoon programs, as well as additional programs that were requested by commercial sponsors. They still played late nights at clubs and worked sidelined in films. Gilbert then returned home in order to live a \\"normal life,\\" but, quickly realizing that she couldn't stay in Sioux City, returned to Los Angeles. =Gilbert's article in Down Beat= In 1938, Gilbert wrote an article for Down Beat magazine in response to an anonymous article titled \\"Why Women Musicians Are Inferior.\\" The article criticized men who discourage women musicians. She said that women musicians faced a double standard: they had to look beautiful while playing their instruments. It was nearly impossible for an all-female band to survive \\"on musicianship rather than looks.\\" While men were hired for musical talent, women were, for the most part, hired strictly for looks. Gilbert experienced this discrimination throughout her career, as \\"she encountered incredulity, outright rejection and auditions at which band members were asked to lift their skirts to prove they had good legs.\\" Gilbert asked, \\"How can you smile with a horn in your mouth?\\" She received support from other women musicians all over the country. The article gave her national prominence as an advocate for women instrumentalists and throughout the rest of her life, she continued to be a strong \\"one-woman support network and staunch advocate for women.\\" =Early 1940s and World War II= By the late 1930s, there was very high demand for all-female bands. This rise of women's bands that correlated with the United States' involvement in World War II did not mean that women musicians were solely filling the men's shoes for a few years. Although \\"All-woman bands had been abundant in the '20s and '30s, yet musicians who played in the groups of the '40s were regarded as temporary war-time phenomena: Rosie the Riveter with a trumpet.\\" Despite the growing competition, Gilbert refused to make her shows risqu√©, and she avoided being a \\"glamour girl\\" bandleader. Instead, she focused on the music and on how the band sounded, gaining respect from all who played with her. In 1941, Gilbert began to work for Local 47 where she helped the union operate the Hollywood Canteen as a place to entertain troops, host blood drives, sell war bonds, help place male musicians into military bands, and more. Gilbert's band also began playing as The Victory Belles on a radio show geared toward servicemen. In June 1942, Peggy and her steady boyfriend of seven years, James Wright, decided to get married before he was sent to Europe. Although he was gone, Gilbert was kept busy, saying that during World War II, her band was working all the time in all different job settings. In 1944, Gilbert did a six-month tour of Alaska with the United Service Organization (USO) with Thelma White, an actress and comedian. The group performed for men in hospitals and camps at various airbases where the band still experienced some gender-based discrimination. One night, high-ranking officers cancelled a hospital ship show so that the women in the band could \\"mingle at a party instead.\\" The band, however, was able to leave the party and make it in time to perform, which was what they had come to do. In October 1944, before she left for Alaska, Gilbert met Kay Boley, and the two instantly became close, lifelong friends. When Gilbert and her husband got a divorce, she and Kay moved in together and continued out their lives as loving partners and supportive friends. During that time, there was \\"no presumption or discussion of a lesbian lifestyle,\\" and Gilbert and Kay's lifestyle was accepted by their friends and family. When the war ended, Gilbert was back in Los Angeles trying to find jobs for her big band. Many women musicians, including Gilbert, lost their jobs after World War II because the women \\"had to move over and let [the men] take over where they left off.\\" While Gilbert continued to play whenever she could, she began to work full-time for Local 47, doing clerical work. She was forced to organize a band of men and women after the war because there was a lack of female musicians. This band, called The Jacks and Jills, included Gilbert's brother Orval on drums and continued to perform until the 1950s. In the late 1940s, jazz began to develop into bebop, and Gilbert's bands became steadily old-fashioned. By 1949, Gilbert was in high demand as a secretary and served on many committees at Local 47. With this section of her life coming to a close, it was clear that \\"her skill as a saxophonist and bandleader, combined with business acumen, flexibility, and good humor, allowed her to make a living and support her family throughout the depression and war years.\\" =1950s and 1960s= In 1951, Gilbert received permission from Local 47 to perform with Ada Leonard on KTTV television for a year. In 1953, she left her job at Local 47 for a job as secretary to the president of a barbecue manufacturing company, but she did not stay long at her new job, returning to Local 47 and working there until 1970. The late 1950s brought the rise of free jazz, and many of the women in Gilbert's generation were no longer performing. Gilbert, however, continued to play when she was asked, but she realized that she was too old to be performing live on a regular basis. She had to ask for approval from Local 47 to perform outside her office job. Gilbert continued to appear in films with her all-female groups, including The Second Time Around (1961). As jobs for musicians began to decline in the early sixties, Gilbert focused on helping younger musicians through Local 47. She was in charge of orientation sessions for new members, as well as served on the Trial Board and Board of Directors for many years. She was discouraged from performing while working there, but was seen on occasional TV shows and motion pictures. In July 1967, Gilbert was honored at a reunion of sixty women from the \\"Girls Big Band Era.\\" The event was \\"a surprise tribute to one of the most loved and respected leaders of 'show biz'‚ÄîPeggy Gilbert.\\" =The Dixie Belles= Gilbert retired from Local 47 in January 1970, on her sixty-fifth birthday, but she continued to serve on the Trial Board of Local 47 until 1984, and in 1985, she was elected to be a Trustee of the Union. Gilbert founded a senior citizen Dixieland jazz group, The Dixie Belles, in the early 1970s, and they immediately had great success and began to perform regularly. In 1975, Gilbert put a group together to appear in the film Long Last Love, and she continued to promote the band for film and TV appearances. Gilbert also continued to speak out for women musicians. Beginning in 1979, she wrote a regular column called \\"Tuning in on Femme Musicians\\" for The Overture in which she promoted professional women musicians. At this time, Gilbert was also a senior member of Local 47, and she continued to mentor younger generations of musicians. The Dixie Belles continued to perform throughout Southern California, playing at many festivals, fairs, parades, and other events in California. In July 1981, Gilbert received a \\"Live Music Award\\" in recognition of her service to Local 47. The Dixie Belles also appeared on several television shows: The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1981), Madame's Place (1982), The Golden Girls (1988), America's Funniest Home Videos (1991), and You Bet Your Life (1993). The band continued playing for various benefits and festivals during the 1980s. In 1986, the Dixie Belles recorded their only album for the Cambria Master Recording label. The band at this time consisted of Gilbert on saxophone, Natalie Robin on clarinet, Marnie Wells on trumpet, Jerrie Thill on drums, Georgia Shilling on piano, and Pearl Powers on bass. In March 1986, Jeannie Pool produced a luncheon and concert in order to make a \\"Tribute to the Pioneer Women Musicians of Los Angeles.\\" The program honored 106 women musicians that performed in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, and Peggy Gilbert and The Dixie Belles made appearances. By 1989, the Dixie Belles were playing an average of 150 jobs per year. They band continued to appear on television throughout the early- to mid-1990s, including shows such as ABC-TV World News Saturday and Ellen. The death of Dixie Belle clarinetist Natalie Robin in March 1998 marked the end of the band. Some of the members of the band continued to perform, but they had ceased to play as a group, after nearly twenty-four years together. =Final years and death= In 1990 the Dixie Belles received the Commitment to Feminism Award from the City of Los Angeles Street Fair. In 2005, Gilbert celebrated her 100th birthday at Local 47 in an auditorium that she helped to build in 1949. After her hundredth birthday, Gilbert became increasingly frail, especially with her partner, Kay, in the hospital. Gilbert died on February 12, 2007, at the age of 102, after suffering complications from hip surgery. Her ashes were buried a few weeks later in the Hollywood Hills, and Kay, who died only a few months later, is buried next to her. Despite the hardships she faced as a female musician, Gilbert always stayed true to her values and lived by the mantra that \\"making a living doing something that you love is important. I was making a living in a business that I loved.\\" Legacy Gilbert's archives are held in the Oviatt Library at California State University, Northridge.

The treaty followed the last battle in the French and Indian War in North America, the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762, which confirmed British control of Canada. In Europe, the associated Seven Years' War continued to rage. Having lost Canada, King Louis XV of France proposed to King Charles III of Spain that France should give Spain \\"the country known as Louisiana, as well as New Orleans and the island in which the city is situated.\\"Herbermann, Charles. 'Louisiana' The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church. Encyclopedia Press, 1913, p. 380 (Original from Harvard University). Charles accepted on November 13, 1762. This agreement covered all of Louisiana: the entire valley of the Mississippi River, from the Appalachians to the Rockies. The Treaty of Fontainebleau was kept secret even during the French negotiation and signing of the Treaty of Paris, which ended the war with Britain. The Treaty of Paris, made between France and Great Britain following the Seven Years' War, divided Louisiana at the Mississippi. The eastern half was ceded to Britain, and the western half and New Orleans were nominally retained by France. Spain did not contest Britain's control of eastern Louisiana, as it already knew that it would rule in western Louisiana. Also, under the Treaty of Paris, Spain had ceded Florida to Britain for which western Louisiana was its compensation. The Treaty of Paris provided a period of 18 months in which French colonists who did not want to live under British rule could freely emigrate to other French colonies. Many of the emigrants moved to Louisiana, where they discovered later that France had ceded Louisiana to Spain. The cession to Spain was finally revealed in 1764. In a letter dated April 21, 1764, Louis informed the governor, Jean-Jacques Blaise D'Abbadie, of the transition: :Hoping, moreover, that His Catholic Majesty will be pleased to give his subjects of Louisiana the marks of protection and good will which only the misfortunes of war have prevented from being more effectual. The colonists in western Louisiana did not accept the transition and expelled the first Spanish governor in the Rebellion of 1768. Alejandro O'Reilly, an Irish √©migr√©, suppressed the rebellion. O'Reilly made good Spain's title by occupancy by taking took formal possession in 1769 and raising the Spanish flag. The acquisition of Louisiana consolidated the Spanish Empire in North America. When Great Britain returned Florida to Spain in 1783, after the American Revolutionary War, Spanish territory completely encircled the Gulf of Mexico and stretched from Florida west to the Pacific Ocean, and north to Canada west of the Mississippi River.

The party returned later that day with an interpreter to ask the settlers why they were \\"pursuing him with hostile intentions\\" when a crowd rushed on them, some pioneers wanting to \\"shoot him at any risk\\". During the skirmish three men died, two being pioneers, with George LeBreton, Recorder of the legislature, killed by Cockstock with a poisoned knife. Cockstock himself was killed by having his skull broken by the barrel of Anderson's rifle. This conflict was part of the motivation for the bill by the Provisional Government excluding blacks from Oregon.

The agreement read in part: :\\"That we, as citizens of said territory, in pursuance of this duty, forthwith organize ourselves into a company of mounted riflemen, and pledge ourselves to abide by such rules, regulations and laws as may be adopted by a majority of the company.\\" :\\"Resolved, That this company shall be called \\"The Oregon Rangers.\\"\\" With the creation, they selected the officers of the company as follows: Captain Charles Bennett, First Lieutenant A.A. Robinson, Second Lieutenant Isaac Hutchins, Third Lieutenant Hiram English, orderly sergeant Thomas Holt, second sergeant Thomas Howell, third sergeant S.C. Morris, fourth sergeant William H. Herron, first corporal P.C. Keizer, second corporal Robert Walker, third corporal B. Frost, fourth corporal John Rowe. Many in the group had some military experience, including Bennett and Holt who had been in the Seminole War as dragoons. In June 1846 a band of Wascos arrived in the Willamette Valley and camped on the Santiam River.Whaley, Gray H. Oregon and the Collapse of Illahee. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2010. pp. 179-180 The band was probably on a seasonal berry gathering excursion, a traditional movement that \\"almost certainly dates back hundreds of years.\\" Rumors began to spread among the pioneer settlements accusing these Wascos of thefts, including livestock formerly owned by the Methodist Mission. An estimated forty Rangers rode about 14 miles to location occupied by the band, under the command of Robinson, near what became known as Battle Creek in Marion County, Oregon. A short skirmish ensued with one Ranger collapsing from heat exhaustion and one Wasco injured by David Daily. The Rangers soon retreated a short distance and then opened fire with their longer range rifles. A parley ensued, with the Wascos upset and angered by the unprovoked attack, and they denied the accusations of their supposed thefts. As there was no evidence to support the settlers' claims, the Rangers offered a horse and some blankets as reparations to the injured native. The poor judgment and action by the Rangers led to ridicule by fellow settlers and the company was disbanded.

He then spent some years in Mongolia, where he was well regarded, and his teachings were presented on radio and television and published in the local newspapers. Books Gyatso's most recent book, A Leaf in the Wind, is a personal account of one man's search for happiness which is often humorous and sometimes shocking. Venerable Gyatso doesn't shirk revealing the mistakes and failings which help to highlight his personal message of hope. He wants us to know that the ego undermines our happiness and fortifies our habitual destructive emotions. His spiritual path is a quest to slay the ego and his life story is a parable for modern times.A Leaf in the Wind The Perfect Mirror: Reflections on Truth and Illusion explains the principal teachings of the Buddha and reflects on the search for a truthful way of life, the pursuit of happiness, birth, death, love, friendship, sex, marriage and raising children.

At the age of 19 he turned to bass guitar. During this time he played in bands called Blue Life, Sold Out, Louis Glover House Band and Drivin' Force. Dirk appeared as a guest musician on Gamma Ray's first album, Heading For Tomorrow, playing bass on the track \\"Money\\" and parts of the track \\"The Silence\\".

Burstall, who claims he wrote most of the script with Al Finney, says that: > When it came to the crunch, Blundell failed to differentiate between paying > Balls and playing Alvin pretending to be Balls. In my view, the film fails > for precisely that reason, i.e. Alvin is lost.Scott Murray, 'Tim Burstall', > Cinema Papers Sept-Oct 1979 p495 Release Alvin Rides Again was the recipient of some more controversy when it was released, but was only rated M.

John D.

KNST's studios and offices are located north of Downtown Tucson along Oracle Road, while the transmitter site is in West Tucson, off North Silverbell Road.Radio-Locator.com/KNST Programming KNST's lineup parallels most iHeart talk stations. Weekdays begin with The Morning Ritual with Garrett Lewis, followed by syndicated shows hosted by Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Clyde Lewis, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal. Weekend shows focus on health, money, law, computers and other topics. Some weekend programs are paid brokered programming. Syndicated weekend hosts include Glenn Beck, Bill Handel, Ric Edelman, Kim Komando, Bill Cunningham and an Arizona gardening and home repair show, Rosie Romero's Rosie On The House (originating from its flagship station KTAR-FM in Phoenix).

By the early 1960s, the station got a boost to 5,000 watts by day, 500 watts at night, its current power.Broadcasting Yearbook 1965 page B-9 In 1966, Strauss Broadcasting purchased KCEE. In 1967, Strauss added an FM station, 96.1 KCEE- FM (now KLPX). At first the FM station simulcast AM 790, but later switched to beautiful music.

The series contains several hundred characters, while the following list contains only the most frequently mentioned. Many of the names Paolini has used originate from Old Norse, German, Old English, and Russian sources, as well as the invented languages. With the exception of Angela, the characters' personalities are entirely imagined and not based on actual people. Some characters, like the titular character Eragon were developed before the series was written, while others (such as Angela) were added on an as-needed basis. Major characters * Eragon Bromsson ‚Äì the human son of Brom and Selena, although Eragon's true relationship to Brom is not revealed until the third novel. Eragon is the cousin of Roran Garrowsson and half-brother of Murtagh. Until the age of fifteen, he was raised by his uncle Garrow. After the dragon Saphira hatches for him, he travels to the Varden, where he learns of the evils done by Galbatorix and determines to end the king's rule. He has romantic feelings for the elf Arya, but the two never become a couple as he leaves Alaga√´sia permanently at the end of the final novel. He is also known as Eragon Bromsson, Argetlam, Shur'tugal, Shadeslayer, Firesword, and Kingkiller. :Eragon has dark brown eyes and hair and fights with bow and arrow or a sword, especially the sword Brisingr, crafted for him by the master smith Rhun√∂n. After a magic ceremony in the second novel, Eragon takes on the physical characteristics of an elf, although he retains some aspects of his human body (such as the ability to grow a beard). He is a skilled magician and second to only Murtagh in his skill with the sword. :The author originally intended Eragon's character serve in an autobiographical capacity. However, Paolini states, \\"Eragon has done] many things that I haven‚Äôt‚Äîsuch as ride a dragon, fight monsters, and use magic‚Äîand these experiences have made him a different person than me. Eragon is now his own person, similar to me in some respects, but possessing a unique history, likes, dislikes, friends, and family.\\" Eragon was the first character developed by Paolini, and the author's outline of how the character would develop drove the novels' storyline. The name \\"Eragon\\" is an aptronym based on the word \\"dragon\\", and a play on the phrase \\"an era gone\\". ::Eragon was portrayed by Edward Speleers in the film adaptation of Eragon. *Saphira Bjartskular (\\"Brightscales\\") ‚Äì a female blue dragon who hatches from an egg stolen from Galbatorix by Brom and Jeod. She is the last living female dragon in all of Alaga√´sia, although more dragon eggs are found at the end of the final novel. Saphira is wise, fearless, protective of Eragon, and somewhat vain. She is also skilled at aerial acrobatics. Her sire was Iorm√ªngr, a bonded dragon, and her dam was Vervanda, a wild dragon. At the end of Inheritance she mates with F√≠rnen before leaving Alaga√´sia with Eragon. ::Saphira's name is derived from the word \\"sapphire\\", and as such serves as an aptronym describing her coloration (blue being Paolini's favorite color). She was voiced by Rachel Weisz in the film. *Arya Dr√∂ttningu ‚Äì a female elf and is the only daughter of King Evandar and Queen Islanzad√≠. Arya has served as courier of Saphira's egg and the elves' ambassador to the Varden. She becomes queen of the elves after the death of her mother, as well as a dragon rider (bonded to F√≠rnen), at the end of the final book. She is also known as Arya Svit-kona and Arya Shadeslayer. Eragon rescues her in the first novel when she is being held captive by Durza. When Eragon first pursues her romantically, she rebuffs his advances, telling him she had recently lost a close friend, F√§olin, and that any relationship would be unwise because of their respective responsibilities and age differences. She holds traditional human gender roles in disdain. At the end of the final novel, she is willing to consider Eragon as a romantic partner, but he leaves before they can begin a relationship. She shows this by telling her true name to Eragon, which she refused to do before. :Arya is over 100 years old. She is beautiful and wise and possesses inhuman speed, strength, grace, and superior fighting and magical skills (like most elves). She has long black hair, slanted cat-like green eyes, and is very tall. ::She was portrayed by Sienna Guillory in the film. *Murtagh Morzansson ‚Äì the human son of Morzan and Selena, Eragon's half-brother. Eragon first meets him in Eragon and travels with him to the Varden, where he is mistrusted for being Morzan's son. In Eldest, Murtagh is kidnapped by the Twins and forced to serve Galbatorix after the dragon Thorn hatches for him. He is an exceptionally skilled swordsman naturally, and has enhanced strength and magic from Galbatorix, as well as his Eldunar√≠ (the source of a dragon's being and life force). Due to his difficult childhood, he has little empathy for others. He has romantic feelings for Nasuada, but does not pursue a relationship as he feels he can never be accepted by society, even after helping to defeat Galbatorix. His name is entirely the author's invention. ::Murtagh was played by Garrett Hedlund in the film. * Galbatorix ‚Äì the human king and tyrant of the Empire. When his first dragon, Jarnunv√∂sk was killed by Urgals, Galbatorix began a quest for revenge against the Riders which ultimately resulted in their extinction and his rise to power in the human kingdom. He stole a dragon hatchling named Shruikan and bound their minds in a crude approximation of a Rider's bond. He has derived incredible magical strength from the captured souls of dead dragons, the Eldunar√≠. He is at least 120 years old. He is killed in the final novel. Galbatorix's name means \\"Big King\\" in Celtic. ::He was played by John Malkovich in the film adaptation of Eragon. *Nasuada ‚Äì the daughter of Ajihad and Nadara, human members of the Wandering Tribes. Upon her father's death at the beginning of Eldest, Nasuada becomes leader of the Varden. She is Eragon's liegelord. She is very cunning and trusted by both her people and Eragon, which leads her to become queen of the Empire in Inheritance. Her later decision to force all magic-users to register and be monitored by the government is what drives Eragon to leave Alaga√´sia. ::Nasuada was played by Caroline Chikezie in the film version of Eragon. *Roran Garrowsson (Stronghammer) ‚Äì Eragon's cousin and father of Ismira, who grew up with him in Carvahall with Eragon. Roran has an almost obsession with his eventual-wife, Katrina, which leads him to travel with the whole of Carvahall to join the Varden. He becomes an excellent motivational speaker as a result. Although he at first resents his cousin for inciting war and bringing about Garrow's death, the two make up and become quite close. ::Roran was played by Chris Egan in the film Eragon. *Orik Thrifksson (also known as Grimstborith Orik and King Orik) ‚Äì a dwarf, a member of the clan D√ªrgrimst Ingeitum, and the nephew of King Hrothgar. He becomes king and leader (Grimstborith) of Ingeitum after Hrothgar's death. Orik is a smith, a warrior, and Eragon's guide. He adopts Eragon into his clan in Eldest. Orik later marries Hvedra, the Grimstcarvlorss of Ingeitum. Humans *Brom ‚Äì Eragon's father and first mentor. He is known for his intelligence and craftiness, surviving long after his dragon's death despite being hunted by Galbatorix (more than 100 years) Brom was the co-founder of the Varden. He has white hair and a long white beard, carries Morzan's sword Zar'roc, and can work basic magic. He is gruff yet kind towards Eragon. He is revealed to be a former Dragon rider (bonded to the first Saphira) as he lays dying at the Ra'zac's hand in Eragon. Brom was played by Jeremy Irons in the film adaption of Eragon. *King Orrin ‚Äì the king of Surda, a minor human empire not ruled by Galbatorix. Orrin's royal line comes from the Broddring Kingdom, the human's first empire. He is an enthusiastic scientist, viewed by Nasuada as somewhat childish and undisciplined. Orrin secretly supports the Varden, and he allows them to move to his country in Eldest. He often comes into conflict with Nasuada when she encroaches on what he believes to be his rightful power, and develops a drinking problem in the final novel which she cites as a reason he should not replace Galbatorix. **Irwin is the Prime Minister of Surda and opposes King Orrin's open support of the Varden. *Elva ‚Äì an orphaned baby whom Eragon attempts to bless in the first novel. From his \\"blessing\\" Elva is compelled to protect other people from misfortune or danger. During the battle against Galbatorix, he mutes her and Elva therefore is of no help. However, previous to the battle she proves useful and helps Eragon, Arya, Saphira, and their spell casters navigate Galbatorix‚Äôs traps leading up to the throne room. Eragon tried to remove the curse, but failed. As a result, Elva is not forced to help others, but she can still sense their pain. *Ajihad ‚Äì leader of the Varden and Nasuada's father. He is responsible for the Varden's alliance with the Dwarven nation. Shortly after the Battle of Farthen D√ªr, at the beginning of Eldest, he is killed by Urgals. ::Ajihad was played by Djimon Hounsou in the film version of Eragon. His name is entirely Paolini's invention. *Jeod Longshanks is a merchant and scholar. He is an agent of the Varden, whom he supported with his business by smuggling various supplies until he was exposed to the Empire, causing him to suffer heavy losses. He and Brom stole Saphira's egg from the Empire. *Carvahall villagers **Selena - she was the mother of Eragon and Murtagh, Morzan's consort and Garrow's sister. She was also known as The Black Hand (a name which is later used to describe a network of the Empire's spies in the Varden) Selena fell in love with Morzan, who trained her in magic and other warrior arts to act as his spy and assassin. After falling in love with Brom, she escaped to Carvahall to give birth to Eragon, dying shortly after. **Garrow is Roran's father (with his deceased wife Marian) Eragon's uncle, and Selena's brother. He lives on a farm, away from the rest of the village. He is killed by the Ra'zac. **Katrina is the daughter of Sloan and Ismira. She wishes to marry Roran, which causes her disapproving father to kidnap her when he allies himself with the Ra'zac. After Roran, Eragon, and Saphira rescue her, she marries Roran and the two have a child. **:Katrina is portrayed by Tamsin Egerton in the film adaptation. However her scenes were cut in the final version of the film. ***Ismira is the name of both Katrina's mother (deceased, pre-series) and her daughter born in the final book. **Sloan is Carvahall's butcher and Katrina's father. Sloan dotes upon his daughter and is highly possessive of her, betraying the rest of the village to the Empire in exchange for her safety. The Ra'zac blind and torture him. When Eragon meets Sloan after his betrayal, he curses him (with approval from the elven Queen) to go live among the elves and remain separate from his daughter until the man repents. **Horst is a blacksmith, and husband of Elain and father of Baldor, Albriech, and Hope. **Birgit Mardasdaughter, the mother of Nolfavrell, assists Roran during the village's flight from the Empire to Surda. Her husband was Quimby, the village brewer, who was accidentally killed by Imperial soldiers when he tried to break up an argument in the village's tavern, then eaten by the Ra'zac. Birgit blames Roran and Eragon for his death, and tells Roran she plans to extract a blood price for this insult. When finally given the chance, she decides not to kill him. * soldiers and magicians **The Twins were powerful human magicians who claimed to support the Varden but really worked for Galbatorix. **Trianna ‚Äì After the disappearance of the Twins in Eldest, Trianna leads Du Vrangr Gata, a group of weak human magicians. Trianna is put in charge of Nasuada's plan to use cheap lace to finance the Varden's war efforts. She also leads Du Vrangr Gata in battle. ***Carn is a spellcaster who serves with Roran throughout the missions in Brisingr and remains a close friend of his. Although not a particularly strong magician, he compensates by inventing extraordinarily clever spells and worming his way into his opponents' minds. Carn is killed in a Wizard's Duel in Inheritance by an enemy magician. **J√∂rmundur is second-in-command of the Varden troops. He is also a member of the Varden's Council of Elders but is the only member to support Nasuada. ***Martland Redbeard is Roran's commander during his first mission and a tactical genius. After losing a hand, he becomes one of Nasuada's military strategists. ****Edric is the commander of one of Roran's missions with the Varden. Edric is a competent but overbearing and rigid commander. ***Captain Brigman is a Varden officer who was sent by Nasuada to conquer the city of Aroughs. After an extended siege, Nasuada, wanting to conquer the city quickly, sent Roran to replace him as commander. **Fredric is the Varden's weapon master. He aids Eragon in finding a new sword, a falchion. He wears a suit of pungent ox hide armor, and wields a massive two-handed sword which is over five feet long. *Lord Barst was a general who was known for his power in battle, said to be just as ruthless as Galbatorix. *King Palancar was the king of the humans when they first migrated and established a settlement in Alaga√´sia. He founded the Broddring Kingdom, but was defeated by the Dragon Riders when he attempted to annex elvish territory. (deceased, pre-series) *Marcus T√°bor was the Lord of Dras‚ÄìLeona before its siege by the Varden. Riders The Dragon Riders are the humans and elves who bonded with dragon hatchlings, as well as a kind of police force existing in the time before Galbatorix's rise to power. They began with the first Eragon, an elf who adopted a newly hatched dragon during a massive war between their two species. Their rule ended 100 years before the events of Eragon with the death of Vrael. *Oromis is Eragon's second teacher after Brom. He is an elf and the last remaining Dragon Rider of the old order. He is also known as \\"Osthato Chetowa, the Mourning Sage\\" and \\"Togira Ikonoka, the Cripple Who is Whole\\" because of a curse placed upon him by one of the Forsworn. He is bonded to Glaedr. *The Forsworn were a group of 13 Riders (and their dragons) who joined Galbatorix during the Fall. When the dragons learned that thirteen of their kind were willingly helping to exterminate the rest of their race, they banded together and erased the Forsworn's dragons' names and identities. After \\"The Banishing of the Names\\" the Forsworn's dragons became beastlike and some of the Forsworn themselves went insane. **Morzan was a Dragon Rider, long dead by the start of Eragon. He is described as \\"strong of body, but weak of mind\\" by Brom, who idolized him until the former's alliance with Galbatorix. **Kialand√≠ was a male Rider. (deceased, pre-series) **Formora was a female elven Rider. (deceased, pre-series) **Glaerun was a Dragon Rider and one of the Forsworn. He died during a nuclear-like explosion caused by the elven Rider Thuviel sacrificing himself at Doru Areba. **Enduriel was a Dragon Rider and one of the Forsworn. It's implied that Enduriel died after the event of the destruction of Ilirea and Vroengard. He may have been killed by Brom or the Varden. (deceased, pre-series) *Vrael was the last leader of the Riders before their Fall and was bonded to the male white dragon Umaroth. **Anurin was an elven Dragon Rider, and leader of the Dragon Riders before Vrael. *Arva was an elven Rider who was at Ilirea when the Forsworn attacked the city. He fought Kialand√≠ (who dealt him a mortal blow) but managed to pass his sword T√°merlein to his sister, Naudra (mate of Lord Fiolr). *Thuviel was a Dragon Rider whose dragon was killed before the battle of Doru Areba. Crippled by the emotional and psychological effects of losing such a bond, Thuviel became depressed and no longer wished to continue living. Vrael however, encouraged Thuviel to sacrifice himself by turning his body into pure energy. Galbatorix long believed the eggs hidden within the Vault of Souls to have been destroyed in the explosion. Thuviel's sacrifice made Doru Areba uninhabitable for even hundreds of years afterward, akin to the effects of nuclear radiation. Dragons In the novels, the dragons are grouped into those bonded to Riders and wild dragons. The wild dragons are far more fierce, while the bonded dragons are more intellectual. All dragons hatch from eggs, in which they can remain for a very long time; once hatched they have a nearly infinite lifespan and continue growing their whole lives. They can breathe fire and reproduce at about six months old. When a dragon dies, it has the option to transfer its consciousness into a diamond-like organ inside its body called an Eldunar√≠. If it disgorges its \\"heart of hearts\\" before its death, the dragon has no choice but to retreat into it when it dies. Such Eldunar√≠ will live on until another creature destroys them. Dragons are a variety of colors, which do not appear to be related to their parents' colors. *Glaedr is the gold dragon bonded to Oromis. He is at least three times as large as Saphira and a skilled fighter, but lost his left leg in battle with Formora. After escaping the Forsworn, Glaedr and Oromis went into hiding in Du Weldenvarden to teach the first of the new generation of Riders. He disgorges his Eldunar√≠ shortly before his and Oromis's death in Brisingr, and is thus forced to live on after his body dies. *Thorn is a red male dragon bound to Murtagh. He has been magically grown to large proportions, but still has the mind of a child. Saphira refers to him as \\"Red-Shrike-Thorn\\". *Shruikan is Galbatorix's black dragon, the largest of all the dragons to appear in the series. He was twisted into the king's service through black magic. The dragon's name is a play on the word \\"shuriken\\". *Saphira is a female dragon bound to Eragon and a central character of the series. Eragon first encountered her as an egg (believing her to be a rare stone) while hunting in the wilderness of the Spine Mountains early in the first book. Her name is a play on the word \\"sapphire\\", due in part to her deep blue coloration. *F√≠rnen was one of the eggs that was captured by Galbatorix. His didn't hatch until Arya, his bond, brought him to the Crags of Tael'neir when the war with the Empire had finished. He is a small green dragon and Saphira's mate. *Bid'daum ‚Äì the dragon whose egg was found by the first Eragon. (deceased, pre-series) *Umaroth (pronounced \\"oo-MAR-oth\\") was the white dragon bonded to Vrael, leader of the Dragon Riders before their downfall. He speaks for all the Eldunar√≠ in the Vault of Souls. *Cuaroc served as guardian of the Vault of Souls in a magical automaton body. *Valdr (meaning \\"Ruler) is the eldest of the Eldunar√≠ in the Vault of Souls. He gives Eragon a vision where the dreams of starlings are equal to the concerns of kings. *Belgabad was an enormous, ancient, wild dragon who lived alone in the northern region of Alaga√´sia. (deceased, pre-series) *Raugmar The Black was black male wild dragon who was a distant descendant of Belgabad. Raugmar was a great-great-great grandsire of Vervada, Saphira's mother. (deceased, pre- series) Elves The elves are one of the oldest races, but not native to Alaga√´sia. They came from a land called Alalea. They are very gifted in magic and live in the forest called Du Weldenvarden. *Queen Islanzad√≠ is queen of the elves until her death in the final novel. She lives in the elven capital Ellesm√©ra. She is the widow of the former king of the elves, Evandar, and the mother of Arya. **King Evandar was the mate of Islanzad√≠ and Arya's father. He was ruler of Du Weldenvarden before Islanzad√≠ was. He died in the elves' and Riders' final siege of Ur√ª'baen. (deceased, pre-series) **Queen Tamunora was the elven queen who worked with the dragons to create the pact that would lead to the formation of the Dragon Riders, ending Du Fyrn Skulblaka.(deceased, pre-series) **Queen Dellanir was queen of the elves when Anurin decided to add humans to the pact so that there would be human Dragon Riders. (deceased, pre- series) **Lord Fiolr is Arya's friend and leader of S√≠lthrim. He is well trained in magic. It is implied that he fought at Ceunon and Gil'ead. He lives in the House of Valtharos. He is the owner of T√°merlein, one of the last swords of the Dragon Riders that was his wife's brother's sword. Later in Inheritance, Arya adopts this sword (with a few modifications) after she becomes a rider. *Rhun√∂n is an ancient elf who created all of the Dragon Riders' swords. After the betrayal of the Forsworn, Rhun√∂n swore never to make another sword. In Brisingr, Eragon works with her to circumvent that oath and forge his sword Brisingr. *Bl√∂dhgarm (translated in an appendix as \\"Bloodwolf\\") is an elf who has magically edited his body to appear beast-like. His scent attracts females. He is the leader of a small group sent to protect Eragon and Saphira. **Wyrden was a powerful elven spellcaster under Bl√∂dhgarm. *Vanir is a (comparatively) young elf, who is Eragon's sparring partner during his training in Eldest. He is cocky and dismissive of Eragon until the latter's transformation during the Blood-Oath Celebration. His name comes from the group of Norse gods known as the Vanir, associated with fertility and prophecy. Dwarves The dwarves are one of the only humanoids native to Alaga√´sia. Their mythology holds that they were born from the rock of the mountains there. *King Hrothgar ‚Äì the King of the dwarves, controlling the thirteen dwarf clans and Tronjheim, the city within Farthen D√ªr. He admits Eragon as a member of D√ªrgrimst Ingeitum, an honor that had never previously been bestowed upon a non-dwarf. He is killed by magic from Murtagh in the Battle of the Burning Plains. His name comes from that of a legendary Danish king who lived in the 6th century and who appears as a character in the Anglo- Saxon epics Beowulf and Widsith. He is succeeded by his nephew Orik. *Verm√ªnd is the Grimstborith of Az Sweldn rak Anh√ªin, a clan that lost everything during the Fall. Verm√ªnd orders the assassination of Eragon when he stays in Tronjheim during Brisingr. Because of his crime, Az Sweldn rak Anh√ªin are banished from the dwarves by Orik and the other clan chiefs until Verm√ªnd is replaced. Verm√ªnd himself is branded a traitor and shall be ignored until he dies. *Gannel Ormsson is Grimstborith (\\"clan chief\\") of D√ªrgrimst Quan, the religious clan of the dwarves. He is also the head priest of the dwarves. He gives Eragon a necklace that will prevent anyone from scrying him. He supports Grimstborith Nado for the dwarven kingship, and later summons the chief dwarf god, G√ªntera. *Korgan was the first dwarf king. He discovered Farthen D√ªr while tunneling for gold. (deceased, pre-series) *√õndin Der√ªndsson Grimstborith of D√ªrgrimst Ragni Hefthyn ‚Äî \\"the River Guard\\", host of Eragon's party in Tarnag. He original voted for Gannel as the dwarves new king, but switched his vote to Grimstborith Nado under Gannel's orders. *Hadfala is Grimstborith of D√ªrgrimst Ebardac. She original supported Gannel as king, but converted her vote to Orik after the attempt on Eragon's life. Other characters and creatures *Angela is a fortune teller, herbalist, witch, and a friend of Eragon's. She is accompanied by a werecat named Solembum. She makes most of her living by fortune-telling for the richer people of Teirm and selling potions. It is implied that she is not entirely human and has lived for an incredibly long time. :Her character is loosely based on Paolini's sister. ::Angela is portrayed by Joss Stone in the film Eragon. *Werecats are sentient creatures who can shapeshift between what appears to be a small, childlike human form and a lynx-like cat form. They are wise, magical, and have mild prophetic abilities. They get along very well with dragons. **Solembum is a werecat who journeys with Angela. In Tierm, he gives Eragon and important prophecy: \\"When the time comes and you need a weapon, look under the roots of the Menoa tree. Then, when all seems lost and your power is insufficient, go to the rock of Kuthian and speak your name to open the Vault of Souls\\". Solembum has red (sometimes blue or yellow) eyes and his ears are tipped with black tufts when in cat form; as a human, he appears as a small dark-haired boy and fights with a dagger. **Grimrr Half-Paw the werecat's current \\"king\\". **Maud is a werecat that lives in Ellesm√©ra and friend of Solembum. *The Ra'zac are extremely powerful beings of indeterminate origins who work for Galbatorix, in exchange for a supply of human flesh. They arrived in Alagaesia from the land the humans had migrated from; the Riders tried but failed to exterminate them. They have evolved to be the perfect human predators. It is impossible to sense their life force, which made it easier to sneak up on riders and kill them. Similar to insects, the Ra'zac have a three- staged life: first as eggs, then as humanoid youngsters and finally, after the first full moon of their twentieth year, they shed their skin and become huge beasts called the Lethrblaka. :The Ra'zac are killed in the movie, but remain alive until Brisingr in the novels (although some Ra'zac eggs are later discovered in the final novel). *Urgals ‚Äì large, grey-skinned, horned humanoids. Although they are first considered beasts, Eragon later learns that the Urgals are as sentient and capable as humans, elves, or dwarves. Despite living in remote matriarchal mountain villages, the social rank and sexual attractiveness of males is determined by the number of foes they have vanquished, which leads to conflict with neighboring humans. They make a pact with Galbatorix to fight for him in exchange for more land sometime before the events of Eragon; when the king fails to deliver, they join the Varden. Urgals who grow to more than eight feet tall are considered Kull, and make up the Urgals' elite force of warriors. The Urgal race and the Kull were invented entirely by the author. **Nar Garzhvog is a Kull warlord and brilliant strategist. He fights in the Battle of the Burning Plains and accompanies Eragon on a later journey to the foot of the Beor Mountains. Garzhvog hopes that, after Galbatorix's defeat, some kind of treaty and athletic contests can be established between the Urgals and humans to avert future conflict between their races. **Yarbog is an Urgal who challenges the authority of Roran (his commander) during a mission. Roran defeats him in an unarmed combat wrestling match and earns his respect. *Shades are humanoid sorcerers possessed by spirits. They wish to kill all other living things and can only be killed by stabbing them directly through the heart. **Durza the shade, works for Galbatorix hunting down the new Rider Eragon and extracting information from Arya in the first book. He is killed by Eragon, but not before seriously wounding the Rider. **:Durza is portrayed by Robert Carlyle in the film Eragon. **Varaug is the Shade created by three magicians using the body of a soldier during the siege on the city of Feinster. He is killed by Arya. *The Menoa Tree is one of the oldest and largest trees in Du Weldenvarden. The tree is the spirit of the elf Linn√´a, who imbued her consciousness into the tree after being jilted by a lover. Linn√´a was an elf who lived before the war between elves and dragons, when they first migrated to the new land. *Blagden is a raven blessed by Evandar for pecking out an Urgal's eyes when the elf king stumbled during a fight, allowing him to recover and defeat the Urgal. The magic gave Blagden the ability to speak (though he primarily speaks in riddles) and see the future, but also unintentionally turned his feathers pure white. Blagden's name is an Old English name meaning \\"the dark/black valley\\". *The five creatures of the Beor mountains are five unique species living only in the mountain range, for which five dwarf clans are named. **Feld√ªnost are large goat-like creatures used as mounts and to produce dairy. Their name means \\"frostbeard\\" in the dwarf language. **Nagra are giant boars hunted by the dwarves. **Fanghur are rare creatures that resemble dragons, though not as large or intelligent as their cousins, and are unable to breathe fire. They are considered to be the most deadly of the native Beor creatures through the way they hunt, by letting out piercing screams or to attack their victim's minds to paralyse them while they go in for the kill. Three attack Saphira in the second novel. **Shrrg are giant wolves. **Urzhad (called Beorn by the elves) are massive cave bears that grow to a large size. Urzhad are larger than most Beor creatures, about as big as a small house.

Domestic and international trains connect at the station to most major cities in Europe; these are operated primarily by Polskie Koleje Pa≈Ñstwowe. During 1972, Katowice railway station was officially completed, having been built as a replacement station for the city's old terminus, Katowice historic train station. It is located in the centre of Katowice city, and forms of the biggest transport interchanges anywhere in Poland. As built, the railway station was located only a few minutes walk away from the city's main bus station. By the twenty-first century, Katowice railway station was reportedly being used by around 12 million passengers per year. The condition of the building had degraded over the course of 30 years, creating to an impetus for its replacement. During July 2009, it was announced that the Polish government had signed an agreement with the Spanish construction firm Neinver for the latter to build a new integrated transportation hub and commercial center in the middle of Katowice, including the redevelopment of the existing railway station. During May 2010, ground was broken at the site, marking the official commencement of phase one of construction, which was focused on the main station building itself; a temporary building was used to host train services while the original hall was demolished and its replacement built. During phase two of the redevelopment programme, the station's platforms were progressively closed for reconstruction. Later phases of the work involved the construction of the retail, hotel, and other on-site facilities. By late 2012, the new main hall of the railway station and its integrated underground bus station had become operational; during the summer of 2013, the entire complex, including the adjoining Galeria Katowicka mall on Szewczyk Square, was officially completed.  History  =1970s incarnation= During the 1960s, work began on the construction of a replacement station for the city's old terminus, Katowice historic train station, which dated back to the nineteenth century. The new complex was designed to serve as a high-profile example of modern architecture; the main railway hall of the building was designed as a collaborative effort between the Polish architects Wac≈Çaw K≈Çyszewski, Jerzy Mokrzy≈Ñski and Eugeniusz Wierzbicki, while the construction of the station was supervised by the noted civil engineer and designer Wac≈Çaw Zalewski. Beyond its aesthetic qualities, the hall's design took into account the troublesome ground conditions present at the site, as the region has been previously used for coal mining and is known to remain susceptible to tectonic movement to the present day. Station in 1973 During 1972, Katowice railway station was officially completed and passenger services commenced that year. It is located in the centre of Katowice city, and forms of the biggest transport interchanges anywhere in Poland. Since opening, the station has accommodated connecting services through to various major cities across Poland, as well as to many international destinations across Europe. Around the start of the twenty-first century, it is believed that, on average, around 520 trains per day were stopping at Katowice Railway Station, while the facility was also being used by roughly 12 million passengers annually.\\"Katowice Railway Station Redevelopment.\\" railway-technology.com, Retrieved: 17 June 2018. Through the station, Katowice is connected to major cities including Vienna, Budapest, Kiev, Berlin, Ostrava, Prague, Bratislava, Zilina, Hamburg, Moscow and Minsk. The railway station is located only a few minutes walk away from the city's main bus station; this closeness serves to ease passenger movements between the two transit networks. However, by the twenty-first century, the condition of Katowice railway station was visibly deteriorating in places. Specifically, inspections of the building's cup-shaped pillar structures discovered that many has fallen into a poor condition and that correcting this weakness required considerable remedial action to guarantee long-term structural integrity, or would necessitate the building's demolition. Following an analysis of the possible options, it was determined that the facility's wholesale replacement via the site's redevelopment was the preferred option. During June 2009, PKP SA (Polish State Railways SA) unveiled its plans for the modernisation and commercialisation of various railway stations across the country in the near-future, including Katowice railway station. During this announcement, it was revealed that considerable planning activity had already been conducted on the initiative, including the scheduling of investments and securing of finance, as well as detailed modernisation plans, in conjunction with the public revealing of the strategy. =2010s redevelopment= Interior of the redeveloped railway station, 2013 During July 2009, it was announced that the Polish government had signed a construction agreement with the Spanish construction firm Neinver, under which the latter would perform the construction of a new integrated transportation hub and commercial center in the middle of Katowice. This programme involved the reconstruction of the existing railway station, along with the construction of an underground bus station, an adjacent shopping center (Galeria Katowicka) and an office tower;http://www.dworzec-katowice.pl Galeria Katowicka other changes included the reconfiguring of various streets, sidewalks and public space located around the railway station. The underground part of the complex will feature new multi-storey car parking facilities. Reportedly, the overall investment was estimated in 2009 to come to around 240 million euros.Cheng, Thean Lee. \\"EPF buys Polish retail mall for RM1.4bil.\\" thestar.com.my, 22 May 2018. As planned, the redeveloped railway station is not to be entirely newly built; instead, it is intended to retain several existing elements of the building, albeit renovated and modernised where deemed to be suitable or necessary. The problematic cup-shaped pillars are on such element, being reinforced rather than removed; a grand new entrance into the main hall of the station is to be developed between the two cups. A glazed structure which connects between the railway station and the new retail and office facilities shall be constructed; the shopping and office complex are to be located upon a newly built elevation, composed primarily of perforated steel structures, these are reportedly intended to provide an aesthetically-pleasing lighting effect via their highly reflective characteristics. will make the building resemble a lighted city centre at night. The existing terrace, leading to a footbridge over the square on Szewczyk Fashion Avenue, is to be demolished. During May 2010, ground was broken at the site, marking the official commencement of the construction phase of the new project. By the end of September 2010, a temporary train station had been opened to accommodate the diversion of passenger services; the old station concourse was closed on 1 October 2010. The first phase of construction was focused on the main station building itself, which is features a one-story hall featuring multiple ticketing counters and information desks, along with 31 retail outlets and trade points, a spacious waiting area for passengers, and compressive closed-circuit television coverage across the complex. As designed, it is to be suited for being simultaneously used by up to 5,000 passengers at any one time, and serve an estimated 12 million visitors per year. The demolition of the old main hall was performed between 22 December 2010 and 11 January 2011. The main station hall was originally scheduled for completion by May 2012; however, the new one-level station hall was eventually opened during October 2012, several months behind schedule. During the ensuring months, a number of the station's platforms were shut off and services redirected so that work could be performed on them, which was undertaken as series of staggered platform reconstructions, performed during phase two of the redevelopment programme. The entire complex, including the adjoining Galeria Katowicka mall on Szewczyk Square, was completed by the summer of 2013, with the new main hall and its integrated (underground) bus station having entered operation by late 2012. The main hall is connected through to the platforms through a series of fixed and removable ramps. The redevelopment programme entailed a total development area of around 136,000m¬≤, of which 17,350m¬≤ of the gross building area (GBA) was the railway station itself, while 8,100m¬≤ GBA was used for offices and 4,800m¬≤ for an on-site hotel.

Publication history Wraith first appeared in Marvel Team-Up #48 and was created by Bill Mantlo and Sal Buscema. Fictional character biography Brian DeWolff was a former patrolman for the New York Police Department who was shot by criminals and rescued by his father, ex- Commissioner Phillip DeWolff. Determined to see his son, who was rendered catatonic, survive, Phillip resorted to using experimental technologies to restore Brian's health. During the restoration process, both Brian and Phillip were accidentally exposed to the machinery's ray; this process gave Brian psionic abilities, including the ability to read minds, induce illusions in the minds of others, project psionic force bolts and control the mind of another person (but he can only control one mind at a time), but also mind- linked him with his father and left him susceptible to his mental domination. Under Phillip's psionic control, Brian (as the Wraith) operated as a vigilante, killing both several criminals and innocent civilians by his insane father's decree. He fought Spider-Man, Iron Man, Doctor Strange, and his sister Jean DeWolff until he was defeated by Spider-Man and Iron Man.Marvel Team-Up #48‚Äì50 During their trial, Brian fell under the mental possession by Phillip once more, but Phillip was defeated by Doctor Strange and Iron Man. Strange revived the Wraith's own consciousness, and he was reunited with his sister, Jean. Once overpowered and the true circumstances revealed, Brian regained his independent will and was found innocent of the crimes; his father went to prison.Marvel Team-Up #51 The Wraith became a costumed adventurer and joined with Iron Man, Jean, and others in battling Midas.Iron Man #105‚Äì108 He also aided Spider-Man and Iron Man against Whiplash and the Maggia.Marvel Team-Up #72 When his sister Jean was killed by the Sin-Eater (who was also a policeman much like Brian), the Wraith was driven mad with grief and he decided to take vengeance on the whole New York Police Department. When he arrived at a police station, he was shot by the Scourge of the Underworld who was disguised as a policeman and attempting to murder Flash Thompson.Amazing Spider-Man #278 His original form was destroyed, but he later transferred his mind into the body of another. He led the Vampire's Lair Club against police, but he was killed again by Morbius, the Living Vampire.Morbius #18‚Äì19 The Wraith was later among the seventeen criminals murdered by the Scourge who were resurrected by Hood using the power of Dormammu as part of a squad assembled to eliminate the Punisher.Punisher vol. 7 #5 While the Wraith was scouting the city, the Punisher shot him in the chest with an arrow.Punisher vol. 7 #7 Powers and abilities Wraith possesses a variety of psionic powers as an effect of energy from advanced technology procured by Phillip DeWolff. The Wraith had the psionic ability to control the mind of one other person at a time. He had the ability to cast illusions indiscernible from reality in the minds of one or more people simultaneously, thereby making reality appear to change or making himself seem invisible. He also had the psionic ability to induce mental pain in others equivalent to the physical pain which would be caused by what they were perceiving without causing his victim physical injury, the telepathic ability to read minds, and the psionic ability to affect Spider-Man's mind in such a way as to shield himself from detection by the latter's \\"spider-sense.\\" He also carried a smoke pistol of unknown origin.

Other American schools with similar programs include St. John's College of Annapolis, Maryland and Santa Fe, New Mexico. Overview A tutorial consists of either one student and one professor or a very small group of students and a professor. Instruction is undertaken through dialogue rather than lecture. HTC students are required to take at least one course per semester in tutorial format, and also enroll in traditional courses, including graduate courses, with course prerequisites waived. The academic expectations for students in the College reside between those of a traditional undergraduate honors program and a graduate program. The College has approximately 225 students and offers programs in 35 disciplines, from journalism to astrophysics. Around 80 students are accepted per year, with suggested applicant scores of 30 on the ACT and/or 1300 on the SAT, and top 10% class placement at high school graduation. Students benefit from their involvement with the College: they are the first to register for classes, can waive general education requirements for graduation, can tailor their tutorials with content that does not mirror existing Ohio University courses, can check out books from the university library for extended periods of time, receive first preference for scholars' dorms, and are eligible for funding to support specific activities, including foreign study, attending conferences, and internships in expensive cities. All programs of study require the completion of a thesis project that requires an original contribution to the particular field. Students must also maintain a 3.5 GPA in their overall coursework. The foundation of an \\"honors program\\" at Ohio University existed as far back as 1945. In 1959, an Honors Program and Awards Committee was established to set rules for and supervise honors courses conducted by various academic departments. In 1972, Professor Ellery Golos approached the University Curriculum Council with \\"A Proposal for a Tutorial System.\\" The proposal was approved on May 9, 1972. Prior to that point, an Honors College had existed previously since 1964. Famous alumni include actress Piper Perabo, Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning reporter Joe Mahr, NASA scientist Lori Poultz-Snyder, CEO at the biotechnology and pharmaceutical company Nodality, Inc Laura Brege, NPR correspondent Adam Hochberg, and Emmy Award- winning writer and producer Matt Wickline. The Honors Tutorial College is located at 35 Park Place near the center of the University. It is across the street from Alden Library and down the street from the E. W. Scripps Hall, home of the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism and the John Calhoun Baker University Center. Since July 2019, Dr. Donal C. Skinner has served as dean of the Honors Tutorial College.

It is a member of pentaspan transmembrane glycoproteins, which specifically localize to cellular protrusions. When embedded in the cell membrane, the membrane topology of prominin-1 is such that the N-terminus extends into the extracellular space and the C-terminus resides in the intracellular compartment. The protein consists of five transmembrane segments, with the first and second segments and the third and fourth segments connected by intracellular loops while the second and third as well as fourth and fifth transmembrane segments are connected by extracellular loops. While the precise function of CD133 remains unknown, it has been proposed that it acts as an organizer of cell membrane topology.  Tissue distribution  CD133 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, endothelial progenitor cells, glioblastoma, neuronal and glial stem cells, various pediatric brain tumors, as well as adult kidney, mammary glands, trachea, salivary glands, uterus, placenta, digestive tract, testes, and some other cell types.  Clinical significance  Today CD133 is the most commonly used marker for isolation of cancer stem cell (CSC) population from different tumors, mainly from various gliomas and carcinomas. Initial studies that showed ability of CD133-positive population to efficiently propagate tumor when injected into immune-compromised mice firstly were performed on brain tumors. However, subsequent studies have indicated the difficulty in isolating pure CSC populations. CD133+ melanoma cells are considered a subpopulation of CSC and play a critical role in recurrence. Moreover, CD133+ melanoma cells are immunogenic and can be used as an antimelanoma vaccination. In mice the vaccination with CD133+ melanoma cells mediated strong anti-tumor activity that resulted in the eradication of parental melanoma cells. In addition, it has also been shown that CD133+ melanoma cells preferentially express the RNA helicase DDX3X . As DDX3X also is an immunogenic protein, the same anti- melanoma vaccination strategy can be employed to give therapeutic antitumor immunity in mice.

For two years he was based at Loreto, Baja California, then moved to Monterey, California. =New settlements= ;Las Californias It was during de Neve's administration that Lieutenant Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Moraga is credited with building the Presidio of San Francisco, after the site was selected by Juan Bautista de Anza in 1776. Moraga is also known as the founder of El Pueblo de San Jos√© de Guadalupe, the present day city of San Jose, California. On 29 November 1777, Moraga founded San Jos√© on orders from Antonio Mar√≠a de Bucareli y Urs√∫a, the Spanish Viceroy of New Spain. It was the first Spanish colonial pueblo in the northern region of Las Californias Province, which became its own Alta California Province in 1804. The city served as a farming community to support the Presidio of San Francisco and the Presidio of Monterey. In 1781, later in de Neve's tenure, he founded the Pueblo de Los √Ångeles. Governor de Neve had applied to Viceroy Bucareli for permission to establish a settlement (pueblo) near the Los Angeles River (R√≠o de Porci√∫ncula), where Father Juan Cresp√≠ had met local Tongva Indians. With the viceroy's approval, de Neve was granted authority from The Crown, Charles III of Spain, to found and establish the second pueblo in upper Las Californias, El Pueblo de Nuestra Se√±ora la Reina de los √Ångeles del R√≠o de Porci√∫ncula (The Pueblo of Our Lady Queen of the Angels of the Porci√∫ncula River), the present day city of Los Angeles, California. During de Neve's tenure as governor, he quarreled constantly with the missionaries' leader, padre Jun√≠pero Serra, over the secularization of the Missions and the redistribution of land to the Mission Indian neophytes and soldiers. During his tenure four missions were founded: Mission San Francisco de As√≠s also called Mission Dolores (29 June 1776), Mission San Juan Capistrano (1 November 1776), Mission Santa Clara de As√≠s (12 January 1777) and Mission San Buenaventura (31 March 1782). =Comandante general= Governor de Neve's success as provincial governor won him promotion in 1783 to succeed Teodoro de Croix as Comandante General of the Provincias Internas, a position that had authority over all the northern provinces (including Las Californias).

Dictionary of genetics. Oxford. \\"Panmixia (panmixis): random mating as contrasted with assortative mating.\\"Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary. \\"Panmixia: Random mating within a breeding population.\\" A panmictic population is one where all individuals are potential partners. This assumes that there are no mating restrictions, neither genetic nor behavioural, upon the population and that therefore all recombination is possible. The Wahlund effect assumes that the overall population is panmictic. In genetics, random mating involves the mating of individuals regardless of any physical, genetic or social preference. In other words, the mating between two organisms is not influenced by any environmental, hereditary or social interaction. Hence, potential mates have an equal chance of being selected. Random mating is a factor assumed in the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg principle and is distinct from lack of natural selection: in viability selection for instance, selection occurs before mating. Description In simple terms, panmixia (or panmicticism) is the ability of individuals in a population to interbreed without restrictions; individuals are able to move about freely within their habitat, possibly over a range of hundreds to thousands of miles, and thus breed with other members of the population. To signify the importance of this, imagine several different finite populations of the same species (for example: a grazing herbivore), isolated from each other by some physical characteristic of the environment (dense forest areas separating grazing lands). As time progresses, natural selection and genetic drift will slowly move each population toward genetic differentiation that would make each population genetically unique (that could eventually lead to speciation events or extirpation). However, if the separating factor is removed before this happens (e.g. a road is cut through the forest), and the individuals are allowed to move about freely, the individual populations will still be able to interbreed. As the species's populations interbreed over time, they become more genetically uniform, functioning again as a single panmictic population. In attempting to describe the mathematical properties of structured populations, Sewall Wright proposed a \\"factor of Panmixia\\" (P) to include in the equations describing the gene frequencies in a population, and accounting for a population's tendency towards panmixia, while a \\"factor of Fixation\\" (F) would account for a population's departure from the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg expectation, due to less than panmictic mating. In this formulation, the two quantities are complementary, i.e. P = 1 ‚àí F. From this factor of fixation, he later developed the F statistics.  Background information  In a panmictic species, all of the individuals of a single species are potential partners, and the species gives no mating restrictions throughout the population. Panmixia can also be referred to as random mating, referring to a population that randomly chooses their mate, rather than sorting between the adults of the population. Panmixia allows for species to reach genetic diversity through gene flow more efficiently than monandry species. However, outside population factors, like drought and limited food sources, can affect the way any species will mate. When scientist examine species mating to understand their mating style, they look at factors like genetic markers, genetic differentiation, and gene pool.  Panmictic species  Pantala flavescens is considered as a global panmictic population. A panmictic population of Monostroma latissimum, a marine green algae, shows sympatric speciation in southwest Japanese islands. Although panmictic, the population is diversifying. Dawson's Burrowing bee, Amegilla dawsoni, may be forced to aggregate in common mating areas due to uneven resource distribution in its harsh desert environment. Pantala flavescens should be considered as a global panmictic population.  Related experiments and species  # Anguilla rostrate, or the American eel, exhibits panmixia throughout the entire species. This allows the eel to have phenotypic variation in their offspring and survive in a wide range of environmental conditions # In 2016, BMC Evolutionary Biology conducted a study on Pachygrapsus marmoratus, the marbled crab, marking them as panmictic species. The study claimed that the crabs' mating behavior is characterized by genetic differentiation due to geographic breaks across its distribution range and not panmixia # In a heterogeneous environment such as the forests of Oregon, United States, Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii) exhibit local patterns of adaptation. In a study conducted by Chaves (2014) a population along an entire transect was found to be panmictic. Traits observed in this study included skull shape, fur color, etc. # Swordfish based in the Indian Ocean (Xiphias gladius) have been found to be a single panmictic population. Markers used in the study carried out by Muths et al (2013) found large spatial and temporal homogeneity in genetic structure satisfactory in order to consider the swordfish a singular panmictic population.

The dedication of the original building in 1961 brought together students from the former Shenandoah and Stanley high schools. It is one of the few five-year high schools in the United States, with grade levels 9-12 (freshmen through seniors), and has an enrollment of approximately 700 students. The feeder schools are Shenandoah Elementary, and Stanley Elementary. Page County High School has an auditorium that can hold approx. 700 people, a gym with two side of retractable bleachers, a full library, a cafeteria that feeds students in 45 minute blocks each day, and three computer labs. In 2005 a distance learning lab was instituted that allows students and teachers to communicate with Luray High School in real time. The school's mascot is the Panther. Major Renovations of Page County High School took place during the summer of 2002. The front facade, doors, and windows were replaced, and many interior changes were made. There were permanent annexes behind the school that housed math and foreign language classes. A new building was built directly behind the now standing Page County Middle School. A new rubber track was added in the summer of 2015. Athletic Complex Page County High School houses an exquisite athletic complex, which hosts all of the school's sports. To the left of the school is the Practice Soccer and PracticeFootball fields. Before the Middle school stands the track, which circles the football/soccer field. Unlike many tracks, Page County's track is not regulation length, therefore all running events start and end differently. The school's softball field is on a hill behind the high school. The Baseball and Softball field stands to the left of the track and football field. The cross country course begins and ends on the football field, but runs through nearby woods and around two large fields, one behind the school and one adjacent to the baseball field. Basketball and volleyball are both played inside the school's gym. The school's golf team practices and plays home matches at the Luray Caverns Country Club. New Construction In August 2006, the Page County Board of Supervisors approved construction of two new high schools in the county. These plans would turn the current Page County High School building into a middle school. The groundbreaking was in November 2006, and the school was scheduled to be completed for the opening of the 2009-2010 school year. The New PCHS In September 2009, The New Page County High School opened its doors, and will see its first class of Seniors, the class of 2010 graduate in June 2010. The new building is located directly above the old PCHS; which now houses Page County Middle School (PCMS).

The school, like all minority schools in Turkey, is a secular school. History Œïstablished in 1454 by the Patriarch, Gennadius Scholarius who appointed the Thessalonian Matthaios Kamariotis as its first Director. It soon became the school of the prominent Greek (Phanariotes) and other Orthodox families in the Ottoman Empire, and many Ottoman ministers as well as Wallachian and Moldavian princes appointed by the Ottoman state, such as Dimitrie Cantemir, graduated from it. The current school building is located near the Church of St. George in the neighborhood of Fener (Phanar in Greek), which is the seat of the Patriarchate. It is known among the locals with nicknames such as The Red Castle and The Red School. Designed by the Greek architect Konstantinos Dimadis, the building was erected between 1881 and 1883 with an eclectic mix of different styles and at a cost of 17,210 Ottoman gold pounds, a huge sum for that period. The money was given by Georgios Zariphis, a prominent Greek banker and financier belonging to the Rum community of Istanbul.Clogg (1998), fig. 15. Despite its function as a school, the building is often referred to as \\"the 5th largest castle in Europe\\" because of its castle-like shape. The large dome at the top of the building is used as an observatory for astronomy classes and has a large antique telescope inside. Today the school, which is the \\"second largest\\" school after the Zografeion Lyceum, has six Turkish teachers, while the remaining fifteen are Greek. The school (like all minority schools, as it is compulsory by law) applies the full Turkish curriculum in addition to Greek subjects: Greek language, literature and religion.

Blakeslee took up a claim on the prairie in the central part of the township where there were no other settlers. He bought 200 head of cattle since there was plenty of empty pastureland. He bought lumber in Ottawa, Illinois that he transported to his claim to build his home and farm buildings.The History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1878 pp. 557-558 Thomas F.

Corey had been an officer in the Mexican War. He was the first Supervisor of Sunbury Township, being elected in 1858. He also held the office 1874 to 1876. He moved on to Iowa in 1876. Erastus was a carpenter who came to the area in the employ of the railroad. He later returned to his home state. In 1854, two railroads, the Chicago & Alton and the Illinois Central, were completed through central Illinois. This opened the area to immigrants and also to the laborers who had worked on the railroad line construction.The History of Livingston County, Illinois, 1878, p. 558 Anderson Corbin and Oliver Corbin arrived in April 1855 from Virginia. For several years they were the village blacksmiths. John Gower and his son Bailey A. Gower arrived from LaSalle County about 1856. They were natives of Maine. The former was supervisor in 1859, 1860 and 1863, and the latter during the years of 1866 and 1869.History of Livingston County, 1909, p. 829 Erastus Thatcher and H. H. Brower also arrived in 1855.

The film was a major commercial success and one of the biggest pictures of 1926 becoming Warner Brothers' highest grossing film. The Sea Beast is the first adaptation of Herman Melville's 1851 novel Moby-Dick, a story about a monomaniacal hunt for a great white whale. However, the film alters the novel's plotline by establishing prequel and sequel elements that are not in the original story‚Äîsuch as the romancing of Esther and Ahab's safe return, respectively‚Äîand substitutes a happy ending for Melville's original tragic one. Some of the characters in the film do not appear in Melville's original novel. Plot Scene from The Sea Beast At the beginning of the story, Ahab (John Barrymore) and his half brother Derek (George O'Hara) compete for the affections of a winsome minister's daughter, Esther Wiscasset (Dolores Costello). Meanwhile, an albino whale has been eluding harpooners, and bears the scars of many failed attacks against him. The animal's fame has reached epic proportions. One day, Ahab and Derek are on the same whaler as the whale heaves into view. Ahab raises his harpoon to kill the beast, but at that moment, Derek pushes him overboard and Ahab loses his right leg to the whale. Not long after this incident, the shallow Esther rebuffs Ahab as her suitor once she catches sight of his peg leg. Heartbroken at this turn of events, Ahab blames neither Esther nor his brother; instead he transfers blame and an undying hatred onto the whale. The following saga of Ahab's pursuit of the whale takes on the aura of a super-human quest, far beyond the proportions of its first motivation. Cast A still from The Sea Beast *John Barrymore as Captain Ahab Ceeley *Dolores Costello as Esther Harper *George O'Hara as Derek Ceeley *Mike Donlin as Flask *Sam Baker as Queequeg *S≈çjin Kamiyama as Fedallah *George Berrell as Perth/As Himself *Sam Allen as Captain *Frank Nelson as Stubbs *Mathilde Comont as Mula *James O.

Barrymore had always wanted to do a film version of Moby Dick and insisted on making this film first rather than the prospected first contract film Don Juan. In retrospect and because of this delay, Don Juan became the first Warner feature to have the Vitaphone soundtrack rather than The Sea Beast.Slide (2014), p.223 Barrymore and Costello One of the most popular of Barrymore's films, this version extends the story beyond the final battle of man versus whale in a variation on Melville's book. Adding publicity to the film was a bit of early Hollywood hype, unintentional though it may seem: the actress Priscilla Bonner was fired by Barrymore from the role of Wiscasset, in preference for his lover, actress Dolores Costello, and Bonner successfully sued the studio and won a considerable out-of-court settlement. Barrymore exploited the romantic scenes with Costello to their full potential in the film, displaying a \\"boyish enthusiasm\\" according to biographer Margot Peters, which made him fall out with Costello's mother. Barrymore drank heavily during the production of the film, and his eyes were constantly bloodshot, with stubble on his chin. Producer Jack L. Warner said \\"that's a great makeup job\\" to director Millard Webb, who retorted, \\"That's not makeup. It's a hangover\\". The ship used in the film, The Narwhal, was actually a former fighting ship with decks stained with blood from fights. The theme in the orchestral score is \\"Love's Old Sweet Song\\". Due to the success of this film, an all-talking version was released in 1930 under Melville's original book title, with Barrymore again in the role of Captain Ahab. The 1930 film used the plotline of The Sea Beast rather than following Melville's novel. A German-language version, Daemon des Mers, was filmed simultaneously in Hollywood by Warner Bros. It was directed by William Dieterle, beginning his American career. Reception A trade ad for The Sea Beast The Sea Beast proved to be \\"extremely popular\\" with the public,Nichols (1985), p.117 and was generally well received by critics when released in January 1926. The romantic scenes between Barrymore and Costello were particularly well received. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., whose father was an old friend of Barrymore's, said he saw the film half a dozen times.Salad Days, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. writing in his autobiography, c.1980 The New Castle News of Pennsylvania called it a \\"remarkable picture\\" which \\"represents the finest in motion picture art\\", considering it to be the biggest picture of the year. The Post-Crescent of Appleton, Wisconsin heavily praised the cast and cinematography, referring to it as \\"a picture of rich, colorful beauty of heart-searing pathos, of poetry that sings in action of courageous deeds of emotions as violent and eternal as the terrific storms that sweep through the picture\\". Mordaunt Hall of The New York Times noted the \\"energy, earnestness and virility\\" John Barrymore displayed in the role of Ahab Ceeley, and stated that his \\"real triumph in this photoplay comes in the second half of the picture, for he has a great opportunity as the grim master of a whaler with a mixed crew of half-mad yellow, white and black scum\\". Hall did believe, however, that the exploits with the whale were not as effective as they could have been, concluding that \\"this is a good production and one which contains much interest, but it is not a great photoplay\\". Photoplay magazine wrote: \\"John Barrymore gives his usual finished performance. His agony is almost too realistic in the scene wherein the sailors cauterize the bloody stump of the leg torn off by the sea beast. It's too gruemsome for the sensitive souls... Dolores Costello's beauty is a delight to behold, and her acting is unbelievably good for a comparative newcomer. The scene in which she first sees the havoc wrought upon her lover by the white whale reaches artistic heights that leave one trembling. And the scene is perfect pictorially.\\" However, Movie Monthly was less enthusiastic about the film, declaring that it \\"does not come up to expectations, principally because its story turns out to be quite preposterous\\". Preservation status The film survives intact and was broadcast on television in the 1950s. The film is listed as being held by several archives around the world. It is available on DVD from Televista.

Jonson's work was half of a total performance, the other half written by Thomas Dekker. The work was especially significant in the developing literary career of Jonson, in that it marked the commencement of his role as a writer of masques and entertainments for the Stuart Court, a role he would fill for the next three decades. The entertainment \\"confusingly goes by several names\\"Terence P. Logan and Denzell S. Smith, eds., The New Intellectuals: A Survey and Bibliography of Recent Studies in English Renaissance Drama, Lincoln, NE, University of Nebraska Press, 1977; p. 84. ‚Äì including The King's Entertainment, and Part of the King's Entertainment in Passing to His Coronation. Under the latter title, Jonson's work was entered into the Stationers' Register on 19 March 1604 and published later that year along with another of his Stuart entertainments, The Entertainment at Althorp, in a quarto printed by Valentine Simmes for the bookseller Edward Blount. The work was reprinted in the first folio collection of Jonson's works in 1616, and was included in the collected works thereafter. (Dekker's portion, which included contributions from Thomas Middleton, John Webster, and Stephen Harrison,Heather Anne Hirschfeld, Joint Enterprises: Collaborative Drama and the Institutionalization of the English Renaissance Theatre, Boston, University of Massachusetts Press, 2004; p. 165. was published separately in the same year, as The Magnificent Entertainment Given to King James.) Jonson's text is dominated by a range of mythological figures (Euphrosyne; Plutus; others) and personifications (Agape; Eudaimonia; Eleutheria; Theosophia; Tamesis, for the River Thames; others) reciting the praises of the new monarch. It was performed while James's coronation procession passed through a series of triumphal arches.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 391. Jonson's first attempt to win royal patronage had not been a success: his play Cynthia's Revels was a failure when acted at Court in 1601, and led to no preferment from Queen Elizabeth. His luck with the new dynasty was much better: Jonson composed several more entertainments in the early Jacobean era, and in 1605 his first masque, The Masque of Blackness, was presented at Whitehall Palace. From that time down to Chloridia in 1631, Jonson was the primary author of masques for the Stuart Court. References External links * The Coronation Triumph online.
