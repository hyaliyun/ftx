It was a private joint-stock mortgage bank serving the Northwestern Krai of the Russian Empire. Its mission was to provide loans collateralized by real estate to manor owners (agriculture) and city residents (industry). As it could not accept deposits, the bank issued mortgage bonds to raise funds for the loans. The bank was established in 1872 after a banking reform. It was one of eleven land banks operating in the Empire, and grew to be one of the largest. Despite several economic crises, particularly the one caused by the Russian Revolution of 1905, the outstanding loans grew from 5 million rubles in 1874 to 148.8 million in 1912. Both Lithuanians and Russians complained that the bank was controlled by and served the Polish interests. During World War I, the bank was evacuated to Petrograd (Saint Petersburg). After the war, in 1920, it returned to Vilnius, which became part of the Second Polish Republic. It continued to operate at diminished volumes until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939. Historical background At the time of the Emancipation reform of 1861, there were no credit facilities available to landowners. The State Bank of the Russian Empire (predecessor of the Central Bank of Russia) was founded in 1862 but did not deal in mortgages. A new law was passed in May 1872 which allowed the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Empire to approve new banks with less than 5 million rubles in capital. That greatly simplified approval procedures as new banks no longer needed approvals from the State Council or the Tsar. However, Finance Minister Mikhail Reytern was afraid that a rapid expansion of the banking network could cause banks to fail. He prohibited from establishing new banks in cities where one already existed and limited the number of banks to two per province. Therefore, entrepreneurs hurried to establish new banks in various regional centers. In total, eleven land banks were established in 1871‚Äì1873. Their initial combined equity was 13.5 million rubles. Founders and personnel Adam Plater, one of the founding shareholders and chairmen of the board Vilnius Land Bank was approved on 9 August 1872 and began operations in December. It was founded by the same group of people who founded the Vilnius Private Commercial Bank. It was established by the largest landowners in the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania (Peter Wittgenstein, son of Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, of Zubov family, ), Russian nobles (, ), Russian politicians (Nicolas de Benardaky, , Colonel Vladimir Giuliani (–í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –Æ—Ä—å–µ–≤–∏—á –î–∂—É–ª–∏–∞–Ω–∏), General ), bankers from Saint Petersburg (Joseph G√ºnzburg, Leon Rosenthal, I. Gonzaga-Pavlichinsky (–ò. –õ. –ì–æ–Ω–∑–∞–≥–æ-–ü–∞–≤–ª–∏—á–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π)), engineer Konstantin Mikhailovsky, and others. The founders raised 1.2 million rubles in capital (down from initial plans of 1.5 million). It was allotted the territory of the Northwestern Krai and Pskov Governorate. It held monopolistic privileges in Vilnius, Kaunas, and Grodno Governorates until 1886 when St. Petersburg ‚Äì Tula Land Bank was allowed to operate in these territories as well. In the Vitebsk, Minsk and Mogilev Governorates, the bank competed with the Moscow Land Bank. In the 1870s, the largest shareholders were business people from Saint Petersburg, including Vladimir Giuliani (665 shares or 14%) and Leon Rosenthal (600 shares or 12.5%), while local nobles Zubov and Plater only had 30 shares each. The ownership later shifted with local nobles becoming the majority shareholders. In 1905, family owned 403 shares, Plater family owned 714 shares, Protasewicz family owned 330. The bank was governed by a 5-member board elected for three years. The initial five members included four founders, namely Giuliani, Zubov, Wittgenstein, and Mikhailovsky. Up to 1915, about 20 people served on the board. The longest serving members of the board were Adam Plater (32 years; chairman in 1898‚Äì1908), J√≥zef Montwi≈Ç≈Ç (27 years), Nikolay Zubov (26 years; chairman in 1872‚Äì1898), and Pawe≈Ç Piotr Ko≈Ñcza (26 years; chairman in 1909/1910‚Äì1915). In addition to salary and dividends, board members received an annual bonus which averaged 11,881 rubles in 1892‚Äì1902. The number of employees grew from 45 in 1885 to 131 in 1915.They received annual salary increases and bonuses. Among the employees were several prominent Lithuanian politicians and activists, including Antanas Smetona, Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, and Jurgis ≈†aulys. Headquarters In 1887, the bank purchased a plot of land along the St. George Avenue (present-day Gediminas Avenue). It measured 702 square Russian fathoms (one Russian fathom is about ). The bank held an architectural competition for the design of its headquarters and received 17 submissions. The chosen design by architect Vikentijus Gorskis, who was also an employee of the bank, was for a two-floor building with a basement symmetrically designed in the neoclassical and neorenaissance style. The construction started in fall 1889 and was completed by spring 1891. The interior boasted a rich decor, which was restored to its original state in 1994‚Äì1997. The building was shared with the Vilnius Private Commercial Bank, established in 1873. In 1910, the building was expended by adding two avant-corps in the inner yard. At the same time, the building was connected with a newly built concert hall (present-day Lithuanian National Drama Theatre) and a residential building creating a complex architectural assemble. In 1928, the vestibule was reconstructed to include revolving door and a white marble dual staircase. In the Lithuanian SSR, the building was used by the Gosbank (State Bank of the Soviet Union) and has served as the headquarters of the Bank of Lithuania since Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1990.

Long-term loans were paid not in cash, but in mortgage bonds which provided for a fixed annual interest to their holders. Initially, that interest was 6%. Twice a year, the borrowers had to pay the interest to mortgage bond holders plus 1% administrative fee to the bank. This fee was lowered several times and in 1900s it was 0.25% for manor owners and 0.5% for city residents. The loans were provided for only up to 60% of the appraised value of the mortgaged real estate. The terms of the long-term loans varied over the years. Initially, the loans for manor owners were offered for 43.5, 48.67, or 54.5 years. More terms were added later, the longest being 66.17 years. The loan terms for city residents were shorter: initially up to 27.5 years and later up to 38.33 years. Most borrowers (more than 80% in 1912‚Äì1914) opted for the longest possible loans. Short-term loans, for one to three years, were available only for up to 10% of the appraised real estate value. The outstanding loans grew from 5 million rubles in 1874 to 148.8 million in 1912. Correspondingly, mortgaged properties grew from 148 manors (approx. 192,700 dessiatins of land) in 1874 to 12,480 manors (approx. 4,135,200 dessiatins or approx. ) in 1914. Already by 1895, 15% of all privately owned land in the Russian Empire was mortgaged to land banks and Vilnius Land Bank commanded a 4% share. The average manor size dropped showing that the loans were taken out by smaller nobles and, in some cases, well-to-do peasants. The bank was very conservative in its lending practices, often using very low valuations of mortgaged properties for which it faced criticism and pressure both from the shareholders and the clients. The average loan per dessiatian increased from 12.4 rubles in 1874 to 28.6 rubles in 1913. The default rate was low (just 0.8% or 434,000 rubles in 1890), but increased sharply during economic downturns. In early 1890s, due to an agricultural crisis (caused by international trends as well as the Russian famine of 1891‚Äì92) and a tariff war with Germany, the default rate increased to 1.9 million rubles in 1895 and 2.9 million rubles or 3.8% in 1898. The defaults increased during the Russian Revolution of 1905 and were 4.1 million rubles in 1907. The bank offered many forms of relief to the struggling nobles, protecting local Polish landed nobility and attracting ire of Russian regulators. Russification policies called for a two-thirds land ownership by Russians and prohibited Catholic gentry and Jews from purchasing land. Therefore, there were very few land sales (as nobles could not repurchase the land later on) and auctioning foreclosed land was one of the few ways for Russians to acquire it. In 1905‚Äì1906, the bank foreclosed and sold a record 55 manors in auctions. The share of urban borrowers kept slowly increasing to about 30% of all loans but those were riskier loans. The share of loans to merchants, who were mostly Jewish, was particularly low ‚Äì just 2.2% in 1889 when the average of other banks was 13.5%. A big jump in urban loans was seen in 1892 due to the agricultural crisis (from 8 million to 13.4 million). These loans helped industrialisation, but were blamed for a construction boom which later resulted in a bust. From 1901 to 1907, the bank auctioned 659 urban properties but managed to sell only 452 and suffered 2 million rubles in losses. There were no restrictions of Catholic nobles or Jews on acquiring urban properties. In 1902, to reign in the perceived abuses, the government limited urban loans to 30% of outstanding loans. Despite the losses and regulations, the bank continued to lend to city residents and the outstanding loans amounted to 35.9 million and represented 2,891 properties in 1915. =Mortgage bonds= Mortgage bond issued by Vilnius Land Bank in 1908 The mortgage bonds were a way for the bank to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed redemption of the bonds with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. When prices rebounded and stabilized at 92‚Äì96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99‚Äì102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow Land Bank had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the bond price dropped to 68 rubles. After the revolution, the market recovered and in early 1913 Vilnius Land Bank had 146.5 million rubles worth of mortgage bonds outstanding. In 1913 they traded at an average of 86 rubles. =Capital and reserves= According to banking regulations, the bank could lend not more than 10 times its capital. Therefore, as lending increased every year, new shares had to be issued almost annually. Up to 1902, the bank issued 33,700 additional shares (nominal value 250 rubles). The shares were first offered to existing shareholders who often bought majority of the new shares using their annual dividends. In 1896, Vilnius Land Bank had third largest capital among land banks after Moscow and Kharkiv banks. In 1898, Vilnius Land Bank had a profit of 1.6 million rubles, second largest after Moscow Land Bank (1.9 million). In 1912‚Äì1914, Vilnius Land Bank was the second largest, after the Bank Handlowy w Warszawie, among Polish banks in terms of capital. The annual dividend grew from 4.35% in 1873, 8% in 1874, and 14.0‚Äì14.9% in 1878‚Äì1885, to 16% in 1896‚Äì1900. The dividends dipped to 13.12% in 1904. The bank took great care to keep the dividend high and consistent, cutting bonuses for board members and even reducing bank's capital in a bad year. The capital grew to 10.6 million rubles in 1913‚Äì1914. This capital was used to provide short-term loans and any excess was required to be invested in Russian government bonds. The bank was also required to have a reserve capital which could be used to cover losses, guarantee 8% annual dividend, or timely payment of interest on mortgage bonds in case of a borrower's default. The reserve capital had to be at least a third (later half) of its stock capital and at least a third of it had to be invested in Russian government bonds or deposited with the State Bank of the Russian Empire. Investment income from Russian government bonds and 5% of annual profit were transferred to this reserve capital. From 1883, newly issued shares were required to be sold at a premium over the nominal face value to build up the reserve. The bank achieved the required reserve level (4.8 million rubles) in 1904. From 1899, the bank had a second special reserve to cover investment losses. Due to requirements of keeping capital invested (mostly stocks of railway companies and Russian government bonds), the bank suffered significant losses (10.4 million rubles) in 1900‚Äì1905. After World War I Vilnius Land Bank returned to its old headquarters in Vilnius, now part of the Second Polish Republic, in 1920 and continued to issue mortgages and mortgage bonds. The bond interest rates varied between 4.5%, 5%, 8% and 10%. The bonds were denominated both in Polish z≈Çoty and in U.S. dollars until the 1934 devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In the post-war years, the bank raised its capital only twice, in 1925 and 1928, but continued to keep its annual dividend high at 8% to 13%. It continued to pay the annual dividend even during the Great Depression. However, its lending volume in 1930 was only 23% of pre-war lending. In 1935, the bank organized an auction for 160 urban properties and 447 rural properties encompassing approximately of land. In 1936, it was ranked the 8th largest private bank in Poland in terms of capital (6.3 million z≈Çoty); at the time, it had total assets of 114 million z≈Çoty. Aleksander Meysztowicz was chairman of the bank for most of the interwar period (1918‚Äì1926, 1932‚Äì1939).

He is most famous for his play Growing Up Gonzales.  Career  Rojas began his theatrical career at Syracuse University when he participated in the production of \\"Short Eyes\\" by Miguel Pinero. In the mid 1980s, Rojas was introduced to Marvin Felix Camillo, artistic director of The Family Repertory Company (\\"The Family\\"), who ultimately became Rojas' mentor. The Family's primary focus was to create plays in English that were written by Hispanic writers that captured the experience of being raised in an urban environment. Rojas was able to travel to Spain and Cuba with The Family as a writer, stage manager, and production manager. It was through The Family that Rojas was able to produce his first two original works, Hotel Presidential and From the Mind of Cheo. After the production of Mandance, Rojas took a 17-year break from the industry to focus on raising his two sons, Felix Jr. and Nick. During his time away from the entertainment industry, Rojas served as a director of a Boys and Girls club. He worked in outreach for the homeless for five years before returning to the theater. In 2009, Rojas was introduced to a script-writing program by his youngest son, Nick. From then, Rojas began writing again and returned to the entertainment business in 2010 with a number of original works. One of his biggest works after his return was Growing Up Gonzales, which originally opened in the Pregones Theater in 2010 and has played on and off for the last 7 years throughout New York in The Jan Hus Playhouse, The Poet's Den Theater, and The Medicine Theater. Rojas states that for him, inspiration is active. There is not one person that inspires him to write, rather it is the collection of constantly moving pieces of life such as music, food, children, and words. His primary goal when writing is to capture life not a genre. = Growing Up Gonzales = Set in the Bronx during the 1970s, Growing Up Gonzales is a two act show following the life of two brothers, Johnny and Cisco. Johnny is tasked with cleaning out Cisco's apartment after he passes away. While cleaning, Johnny finds a box full of notepads full of stories that Cisco wrote down over the years. As Johnny reads through them, he discovers a different side of Cisco. Through the play, one is able to see the juxtaposed experiences of brothers growing up in the same environment but leading completely different lives. Growing Up Gonzales takes into consideration the audience members that may not speak Spanish and those who are not familiar with certain Puerto Rican customs and provides a comedic voice over prior to the commencement with definitions of terms that would be used throughout the performance. = El Conde y La Condesa = With the combination of monologues and live music, El Conde y La Condesa tell the story of Cita Rodriguez, daughter of Pete \\"El Conde\\" Rodriguez who was a salsa legend that rose to fame in the 1970s. The one-woman show recounts moments that capture the love that Cita had for her father and the impact that their relationship had on her life. The show heavily relies on music to show the intense love and loyalty that are shared in this father-daughter relationship. It attracts not only theatergoers but also music lovers and salsa enthusiasts. The play was written in collaboration with Cita Rodriguez. = Papi's Promise = Papi's Promise is a TV pilot that brings up the issue of domestic violence, taking responsibility and protecting one's children. The main character, Carlos Bonilla (played by Felix Rojas), loses his girlfriend to a sudden car accident and he is left to care for her fourteen-year-old son, Jay. However, after the death of his mother, Jay begins to act out and Carlo does not know how to deal with him. Jay calls his abusive biological father, who tries to convince Jay to go live with him. Social services takes Jay away from Carlo after the two were arrested for replacing the American flag with the Puerto Rican flag while intoxicated. The film shows the battle that Carlo went through to get Jay back and the personal and legal obstacles of being a parent to a child that is not biologically yours.

Course and features Selwyn Rock - grooves and striations on exhumed Permian glacial pavement. The Inman River rises on the eastern slopes of the Mount Lofty Range and its headwaters drain the Inman Valley as the river flows southeast towards its mouth emptying into Encounter Bay on the southern side of Victor Harbor. The river descends over its course. Etymology The Inman River was named through association with Inspector Henry Inman, founder and first commander of the South Australia Police, who pursued two allegedly escaped convicts there in August 1838. Two indigenous names are recorded for the river: Moo-oola and Moogoora. The mouth was called Mugurank, meaning 'place of hammerstones'. Selwyn Rock, named after Alfred Richard Cecil Selwyn who first discovered it in 1859, is a glaciated pavement in the bed of the river near the settlement of Inman Valley which clearly shows evidence of Glacial striation.

It that occurred in 309 BC during the First Bosporan Civil War, the Siraces were a hellenized Sarmatian tribe that had sided with Eumelos, a claimant to the Bosporan throne and a brother of Satyrus. Prelude Before the siege, the Bosporan army which had been composed of 34,000 troops (20,000 Scythian Infantry, 10,000 Scythian cavalry, 2,000 Thracians peltasts and 2,000 Greek mercenaries hoplites) had successfully defeated and routed Aripharnes and Eumelos, and the Siracen army of 42,000 (22,000 Infantry, 20,000 cavalry) during the Battle of the River Thatis. Satyros gave immediate chase to his younger brother, where he came up the Siracen capital city of Siracena which was heavily fortified and situated on that the river Thatis. Knowing that he could not take the city, he plundered the surrounding countryside and took on many prisoners. Siege Satyros II had his men cut through the trees that surrounded the easiest entry way of the city for a total of 4 days, although on the third day, they began to experience missile fire and arrows from the Siracens on the city's walls, they could not fight back as the woods were too thick and could not see who was firing at them, or from where. On the fourth day, they were able to reach the wall and enter the city. As soon as he made it through, Meniscus fought with great valor and boldness against his enemies, but had to retreat once a larger force of Siracens had arrived at his location. Seeing his friend in danger, Satyrus rushed to his aid and fought valiantly, but was struck with a spear to his right shoulder and he was carried to camp. Satyrus died that night, and Meniscus gave up the siege and took his body back to Panticapaeum. Aftermath Meniscus returned the body of his friend Satyros to his younger brother Prytanis, who then assumed the title of basileios and continued his brother's war against his other brother Eumelos. Prytanis would later be spared, to only be later killed after his attempt to usurp his brother Eumelos and he would become ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom and expand its fame and naval power in the Black Sea.

History The origins of the office, possibly in its original form though not conclusive dates from a very much earlier date, John, King of England who developed a royal fleet and the earliest known administrative structure for the English Navy, through his appointment of William of Wrotham in the early 13th century, William a naval administrator is said by modern historians to have had a \\"special responsibility for ports, customs, and the navy\\". Murray (1935), Oppenheim reprint, (1940), Lloyd (1970) and Runyan (1987) support the view that his office was continued down until the creation of the Navy Board in 1546 and the Clerk of the Act's and the Secretary of the Admiralty. However a clear definition of Wrothams office is not conclusive and has been viewed by other sources such as Turner (1994) to be similar to that of the First Lord of the Admiralty. King John's successor Henry III continued refining the naval administration his fleets. However it was during Edward III's reign when a formal naval administration really began to evolve. It was possibly the oldest administrative appointment in connection with the Royal Navy, at first called Keeper of the King's Ports and Galleys during the thirteenth century, later in the fourteenth century known as Clerk of the King's Ships, according to naval historian Nicholas A. M. Rodger in his book the Admiralty (1979) states \\"Insofar as mediaeval Kings of England possessed a permanent administrator of their navies, he was the 'Clerk of the Kings Ships'. The post first appears in a distinct form under King John with William de Wrotham was Keeper of the Kings Ports and Galleys, the Clerk of the Kings Ships was not a one man department of state but a permanent agent of the crown\\" this official held, sometimes really and sometimes nominally, for a period of over 300 years the control of naval organisation until the formation of the Navy Board in 1546. During the course of the following centuries the title changed its name. In the fifteenth century the post was known as the Clerk of Marine Causes and during the sixteenth century the office was known as the Clerk of the Navy, in the seventeenth century, Clerk of the Acts. Between the years 1673 and 1677 the office was held jointly by two clerks of the acts, and then again from 1702 until 1706. Between 1673 and 1680 the post was held simultaneously with the Secretary of the Admiralty. In the same year the Clerk of the Acts was appointed an assistant to alleviate him of some of his secretarial duties and thus separating those responsibilities from the office of the secretary. In 1796 the offices of Clerk of the Acts and three other offices, those of Comptroller of Storekeepers Accounts, Comptroller of Treasurer Accounts and Comptroller of Victualling Accounts, were abolished and the Board reconstituted; the function of the Navy Office was then supervised by three Committees, of Correspondence, Accounts and Stores. Responsibilities The Clerk of the Acts' official responsibility's were: * As head of the Navy Office staff * Administering and processing of all Naval contracts. * Coordinating the secretarial side of the Navy Board's work. * Framing and writing answers to letters, orders, and commands from the Board of Admiralty. * Management of Navy Board records. * Processing of petty cash payments * Provision, equipment and victualing of all ships. * Superintending and organizing the business of the Navy Board. The Clerk of the Kings Ships' responsibilities were: * Administration of ships of the Crown. * Repair of ships of the Crown. * Payments to all crews of the Crown's ships * Safekeeping of ships of the Crown. * Victualling of ships of the Crown. The Keeper of the Kings Ports and Galleys' responsibilities were: * Carrying out the King's orders regarding the Navy. * Organization and general conduct on the Navy. * Supervision of repairs of ships. * Requisition merchant shipping in relation to meet abnormal demands of transport and supply. * Process mariners' payments.

It was designed by Donoghue & Fulton and built from 1945 to 1951. It is also known as North Ward Hospital. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 April 1996.  History  The first hospital in Townsville was opened in a cottage on The Strand in 1866 and was known as the Burdekin and Flinders Districts Hospital. In 1881 it was relocated to the present site on Stanton Hill. A two storied building was completed in 1882 and numerous buildings were subsequently built on the site. Second Townsville General Hospital, circa 1952 The Second Townsville General Hospital was designed by Donoghue and Fulton between 1935 and 1939 but construction was delayed due to the outbreak of World War II. On 11 November 1945, the foundation stone was laid by the Queensland Treasurer, Ned Hanlon. On 21 April 1951 he officially opened the hospital in his role as Queensland Premier. The new hospital was to be the largest facility of its type in Australia outside a capital city and had been built at a cost of approximately ¬£500,000 for building and equipment. It opened with approximately 270 beds. Dr Kiernan Dorney was the medical superintendent and the hospital claimed to have the largest staff of specialists outside Brisbane. Between 1932 and 1945 was a period of rapid development in hospitals in Queensland. This was partly due to the passing of the Hospital Act in 1923 which laid the foundations for the Queensland Government to resume responsibility for financing and administrating public hospitals which had previously been run by voluntary committees. Under the Act the state was divided into regions and regions into districts. Each region was controlled from a base hospital which coordinated other hospitals in the region. Hospital boards, dominated by government representatives and excluding members of the medical profession, were created to oversee the administration of the hospitals. The Queensland Government was to provide 60% of the running costs while the remainder was to be met by local government. The boards had the power under the act to appoint their own architects. Ned Hanlon, who was minister for Health and Home Affairs from 1935 until 1944 and premier from 1946 until 1952, was responsible for many of the projects undertaken at this time. The Free Hospital Scheme was introduced to Queensland in 1946. Tenders were called in 1947 for new nurses quarters at Townsville designed by JP Donoghue, Cusick and Edwards. By 1964 the hospital complex also included a maternity hospital, a thoracic block, isolation and psychiatric annexes, a dental clinic, an Institute of Tropical Medicine (established in 1910 and the first medical research organisation in Australia) and a Commonwealth Serum Laboratory. Other hospital works designed by Donoghue and Fulton include general hospitals at Kingaroy (1936-38), Ayr (1941) and Roma, the Nurses' Quarters at Nambour Hospital (1937-38) and maternity hospitals at Goondiwindi, Rockhampton, Warwick and Nambour. Later works include the Barcaldine General Hospital by Fulton and Collins built in 1957 and the Thoracic Block at the Toowoomba Hospital by Donoghue, Cusick and Edwards in 1958. The Second Townsville General Hospital demonstrates the emergence of the Australia-wide trend for a progressive image, inspired by European modernist architecture, for highrise hospital design. The high rise plan, in which various functions could be concentrated in vertically stacked spaces, replaced the earlier pavilion planning principles, in which detached buildings containing single wards were widely separated. Developments in medical theory meant that ventilation and isolation were no longer considered as important to the health of the patient. New priorities based on more efficient use of space, staff, circulation between different parts of the hospital and reduced heating costs led to the popularity of the much more compact highrise type of hospital. Block 3 at the Brisbane General Hospital, designed in 1930, was the first hospital building in Queensland to fully incorporate the principles of the highrise plan. It was designed in the Spanish Mission style to coordinate with the earlier Blocks 1 and 2. The design for the Second Townsville General Hospital was probably the first in Queensland to combine highrise planning principles with a progressive modern image. First introduced into Australia in the 1930s the highrise plan soon dominated new hospital construction. Melbourne architects Stephensen and Meldrum, later Stephensen and Turner, and Leighton Irwin were noted specialists in this increasingly complex field of architectural design. The development of modernist architecture in Australia is often associated with hospitals designed by these firms in the 1930s and 1940s. Charles Fulton is recognised as a key practitioner to have designed in the modern style in Queensland before the Second World War. Fulton was born in Sydney in 1906 and undertook his architectural training there. He worked in London for B George, Architects in 1931 and 1932. In 1933 he was employed by Hall and Cook in Brisbane and he established his practice with Donoghue in 1937. Fulton received acknowledgment for his skilled execution of this style for the Masel residence at Stanthorpe through a meritorious architecture award in the first Queensland awards programme in 1938 and again in 1940 for his own residence at Indooroopilly. In 1937 Fulton was appointed Lecturer in Charge of Architecture at the Central Technical College. Eventually the Second Townsville General Hospital could not expand any further due to its urban location and was regularly reaching absolute capacity. The third and current Townsville Hospital at Douglas began construction in 1998 and opened in 2001, co-located with James Cook University.Townsville Council website: A Chronological History of Townsville 1970 to 2003 However the heritage-listed buildings of the second hospital, with their landmark white Art Deco appearance, enviable location, and water views, have been retained and were turned into exclusive apartments.  Description  The Second Townsville General Hospital is a six- storied concrete and brick building with a flat roof concealed behind parapet walls. It is situated near the northern corner of the hospital reserve and overlooks Cleveland Bay and Magnetic Island. The external walls, which are rendered and painted white, sit on a base of exposed brickwork. The building has a narrow plan with the long north eastern elevation forming the dominant front facade. This symmetrical facade is divided into five distinct bays where the building steps back from the centre to the edges. The central bay is a tower-like structure which provides the main entrance on the ground level. The entrance is further emphasised through the use of exposed brickwork and a cantilevered awning. Steel framed windows form a vertical strip in the centre of the entrance tower above the awning. On the flanking bays each level is expressed through projecting balconies which run along the north eastern elevation. The balconies have light weight metal balustrades. At the edge of the balconies, underneath the balustrades, are deep horizontal bands or valances which provide sunshading for the windows below. Built in a modernist style the surfaces of the building are undecorated. The composition of the building contrasts horizontal with vertical elements, and sheer surfaces with carefully controlled openings and deep shadowed recesses. The vertically proportioned elements are the central entrance tower and stepped corners. The wards, with long open balconies curved and cantilevered at the ends, form the horizontals.  Heritage listing  The Second Townsville General Hospital was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 26 April 1996 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The hospital is one of the most prominent examples of the extensive hospital building program undertaken by Labour Governments in the 1930s and 1940s throughout Queensland as part of its commitment to government sponsored public health. The first hospital in Townsville was opened in a cottage on the Strand in 1866 and was known as the Burdekin and Flinders Districts Hospital. In 1881 it was relocated to the present site on Stanton Hill. A two storied building was completed in 1882 and numerous buildings were subsequently built on the site. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Second Townsville General Hospital, designed in the late 1930s, is significant as an early example in Queensland of a highrise hospital influenced by European modernist architecture. This style of architecture developed in the 1930s and 1940s in Australia, with new hospitals providing many of the most prominent examples. Through its simple geometry of horizontal and vertical elements, wide cantilevered balconies with rounded corners, flat roof concealed behind parapets and its plain surfaces, Townsville General Hospital is a good example of a hospital built in this idiom. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Second Townsville General Hospital is significant as an institutional building designed by the important architectural firm Donoghue and Fulton which combined the latest ideas in hospital planning with recent developments in architectural design. Charles Fulton, who designed the building, was a key practitioner and teacher of the modern trends in architectural design in Queensland. Fulton was acknowledged for his work in this style. Both the Masel residence at Stanthorpe (1938) and his own residence in Indooroopilly (1940), received a meritorious architecture award in the early Queensland Awards Programmes.

The rebuild project was first reported by media in October 2013 and formally launched in January 2014. The ship will be the same size as the original Titanic, hence 269 meters in length and 28 meters wide. The remake will be permanently docked in a reservoir on the Qijang River in Sichuan's rural Daying County. The replica vessel, which will be the centrepiece of the Romandisea resort and will house hotel rooms, is currently under construction by the river Qi (ÈÉ™Ê±ü), a right tributary of the Fu River. The new Titanic is being assembled at the coordinates e  Background  In 1912, the original Titanic set out on its maiden and only voyage from Southampton in the United Kingdom to New York City. Five days into the voyage, the ship hit an iceberg and sank, killing approximately 1,500 of the 2,224 aboard. Titanic was the largest ship of its time. South African businessman mogul Sarel Gous proposed building Titanic II in 1998. Gous said he had acquired the original drawings for the famous ship and now wanted to fulfill his dream. If the ship had been completed, it would have had a length of and a width of , which is longer and metres wider than the original. In 2006 the Replica Titanic project was scrapped due to high costs and a low amount of support for the project. The last Titanic survivor to pass away, Millvina Dean, had expressed her opposition to the project. Another replica ship based on the Titanic was announced and planned by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer. It too was referred to as the Titanic II. The intended launch date was originally set in 2016, delayed to 2018, then 2022. James Cameron's 1997 Titanic movie enjoys great and lasting popularity in China, and introduced the Chinese masses to the Titanic story. The importance of this movie as a reference point for the Chinese developers is indicated by the fact that actor Bernard Hill, who portrayed Captain Edward Smith in Cameron's film, was present at the launch of the project and was named the \\"honorary captain\\" of the vessel to be constructed. The investors behind the Sichuan replica approach the 1912 tragedy primarily as a story of heroic self-sacrifice in the face of disaster. The CEO of the investment group is reported to have elaborated on the 'Titanic spirit': > Su Shaojun insisted that harrowing stories that happened when the Titanic > sank represented a concentrated release of the noblest side of human > emotions hidden deep in people‚Äôs hearts for more than a hundred years. > ‚ÄúPeople have never forgotten how at that time people sacrificed their lives > to carry out their responsibilities, with men protecting the women and > children and couples side by side in life and death. That is the Titanic > spirit of responsibility and universal love.‚Äù He thinks the Titanic spirit > shall be passed on and a really unsinkable Titanic shall be rebuilt, ‚Äúand > let it become the place to pass on and experience the great spirit of > Titanic. Romandisea will therefore become a world-class tourist destination > with a noble soul and spiritual pursuit.‚Äù  Construction and features  Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Co.,Ltd has confirmed the replica Titanic will be a tourist attraction and that will cost approximately US$161 million to build. The ship will include many features of the original, including, dining rooms, first-class cabins, second and third class cabins, Turkish baths, gymnasium and a swimming pool. It will also include replica of the original ship's engine. New features will include a ballroom and theatre which were not on the original ship. The original ship's Grand Staircase will also be remade. The ship is expected to accommodate 2,400 passengers and 900 staff and will also house an interactive museum. On December 23, 2017, the Facebook page of the project indicated that boiler room 1 will be replicated; the engine room will also be recreated, complete with a (mock-up) reciprocating steam engine for visitors to see. Using audiovisual technology, the ship was at one point intended to contain a simulation of the original's collision with an iceberg that led to the original ocean liner sinking. This caused some criticism. Hollywood production designer Curtis Schnell, who is hired in to work on the project, stated that the 1912 tragedy is approached in a ‚Äúvery respectful way‚Äù. However, that idea has since been scrapped. As for authenticity of design, Schnell stated: ‚ÄúWe're trying to get as close as we can. We are not building every room in the [original] ship, by any means, but the shell of the ship and the exteriors will be quite accurate, [and] there will be interior rooms to be able to tour and see from the standpoint of historical accuracy.‚Äù Xinhua News Agency has reported that it took two years to design the new vessel with cooperation from an American firm, and that the blueprints of the original ships were obtained for the purpose of a basis for the new ship. Construction is being done based on the design of the original Titanic, and is being assisted by designers and technicians from the United States and Britain. As said by the vice general manager of the Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group Corp., construction of the replica is being done with investment from Seven Star Energy Investment, a private company based in Sichuan province. Prior to the commencement of building this ship, none of the numerous proposed full-size replica ships of the Titanic ever made it to the point where actual construction began. Despite this, in May 2015, Wuchang started making parts for the vessel. A keel laying ceremony at the site of the future resort occurred at the end of November 2016, with Lord Peter Mandelson attending.  Project status  Su Shaojun, CEO of the investment group, initially indicated that the replica was expected to be completed around the end of 2017. However the start of on-site assembly was delayed over a year. In 2018 NPR reported that the project might be experiencing financial problems while aerial images captured between April and October of that year showed no visible changes in the ship's construction status. On December 10, 2018, Romandisea confirmed that construction work had resumed. In June 2020 the project's official media site posted an image of the forecastle section nearly completed.  Documentary  In December 2016 the developer signed a cooperation agreement with the United States National Geographic Channel to document the construction of the vessel.  Titanic II  The Romandisea Titanic is completely unrelated to the Titanic II project being promoted by Australian business man Clive Palmer. While the Romandisea ship is designed only as an exhibit, Palmer's ship is intended to be a fully functioning ocean liner. The most noticeable difference is the addition of a \\"safety deck\\" between C and D decks on Titanic II to accommodate SOLAS compliant lifeboats and marine evacuation systems. As of June 2020 construction has yet to begin on the Palmer vessel. References  External links  *Official Romandisea web site, where the new Titanic will be situated.

It has a single hairy leaf and up to three greenish-cream flowers which have a forward-projecting, white labellum. Description Caladenia uliginosa subsp. patulens is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, 120‚Äì180 mm long and 6‚Äì10 mm wide. Up to three greenish-cream flowers 80‚Äì100 mm long and 40‚Äì60 mm wide are borne on a spike 200‚Äì350 mm tall. The sepals and petals have brownish, thread-like tips. The dorsal sepal is erect, 45‚Äì100 mm long and about 2 mm wide and the lateral sepals are 45‚Äì100 mm long, 4‚Äì5 mm wide and curve downwards. The petals are 35‚Äì80 mm long and about 3 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 14‚Äì22 mm long, 7‚Äì10 mm wide and projects forward with a white tip. The side of the labellum have short, thin, pale red teeth, its tip curves downward and there are four rows of pale red calli along its centre. Flowering occurs from September to early October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia uliginosa was first described in 1984 by Alex George and the description was published in Nuytsia. In 2001, Stephen Hopper and Andrew Phillip Brown described three subspecies, including subspecies patulens and the description was also published in Nuytsia from a specimen collected near Harvey. The subspecies name (patulens) is derived from the Latin word patulus meaning \\"spread out\\" or \\"open\\" referring to the lateral sepals and petals which are more spreading in this subspecies than in subspecies uliginosa. Distribution and habitat The frail spider orchid is found between Harvey and Nannup in the Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions where it usually grows among dense shrubs in woodland and forest. Conservation Caladenia uliginosa subsp. patulens is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.

The band was formed in 2012 and is self-described as a \\"retro country band\\". History The Delines were formed when singer Amy Boone was touring with Richmond Fontaine and singing the female parts from that band's 2003 album, Post to Wire, which had been performed by her sister Deborah Kelly. Kelly and Boone had been in the Texas band the Damnations. Vlautin then formed the Delines, centred on Boone's evocative world-weary and vulnerable vocals. They gathered in Portland, Oregon with producer John Askew to cut the band's debut album, Colfax. The songs on Colfax, which was released in June 2014, combined Vlautin's admired lyrics about characters from the America's hinterland and their everyday struggles, with Boone's vocals, the emotion of which wrings out the pain of the characters. Colfax was well received by the critics and scored 87 on Metacritic with seven positive reviews. Following the release of Colfax the band embarked on a European tour. They have since toured in North America and Australasia, and returned to Europe. A second album, Scenic Sessions, was released as a limited edition CD for sale only on the 2015 European tour and from the band's website. This ten- song album had seven songs by Vlautin, a song written by Cory Gray and another by Amy Boone, as well as a cover of Sunshine by Sparklehorse. Amy Boone was involved in a car accident in March 2016 and the band planned to record again when she had recovered. The band's second album, The Imperial, and a single from the album, \\"Eddie and Polly\\", were both released in January 2019. They also announced a European tour for the beginning of 2019. The Imperial was nearly as well received as their debut album, scoring 84 on Metacritic from 6 reviews.

Each image can be viewed correctly from a certain angle. Most tabula scalata have the images in vertical lines so the picture seems to change from one image to another while walking past it. The top image on versions with horizontal strips could be seen via a mirror placed above the picture. Some tabula scalata have the two pictures matched in shape and size, which practically creates a simple type of morphing effect when the viewing angle changes. A variation, known as \\"triscenorama\\" or \\"tabula stritta\\" has three images: two on each side of perpendicular slats in front of the third picture. The basic idea of tabula scalata and tabula stritta is somewhat similar to that of the ancient triangular periaktos theatre coulisse and that of the modern day Trivision billboard. Terminology The Latin term \\"Tabula scalata\\" was introduced in 1646 by Athanasius Kircherhttp://www.mas.bg.ac.rs/_media/istrazivanje/fme/vol45/2/3_aderosa_et_al.pdf and can be roughly translated as \\"ladder picture\\". The terminology in the English language has been somewhat diffuse: many different words have been used for the same type of corrugated pictures. \\"Perspective picture\\" and \\"anamorphic picture\\" have been common but not very precise terms; these are also used for very different pictures. Furthermore, it has been suggested that \\"anamorphic\\" should be reserved for the flat type of pictures with a distorted perspective. \\"Turning pictures\\" is more precise but less common. The term \\"double portrait\\" is not uncommon, but does not cover any tabula scalata that depict different subjects. History Tabula scalata were known at least since the late 16th century, when they were a popular novelty in England. References can be found in the works of Shakespeare and in other literature of the time. A turning picture of a young woman (often thought to be Mary, Queen of Scots) with a skull on the other side of the vertical wooden prisms was painted by an unknown artist around 1580. The woman's face and the skull are depicted in the same angle, with the woman's eyes, nose and ears matching the corresponding holes in the skull. The pictures do not completely match: the woman's mouth is much smaller and higher than the skull's upper teeth (the jawbone is missing) and the skull is bigger: the back of the head matches the woman's wide collar. An illustration of the basic technique, with a single picture hidden from sight by blank sides of slats when viewed from below, was published in a 1583 book on perspective drawing by Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola and Ignazio Danti.egnatio danti A double portrait of Charles III of Lorraine and his daughter Christine of Lorraine (wife of Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany) was painted on horizontal wooden prisms by Ludovico Buti in 1593. Christine's portrait was visible via a mirror placed above the painting, while Charles portrait could be seen when looking upwards to the painting located above a door. The painting is now in the collection of the Museo Galileo, Florence. French Minim mathematician and painter Jean Fran√ßois Niceron described the technique in his 1638 ground-breaking book La perspective curieuse, illustrated with a horizontal version of tabula scalata with a mirror showing the image that was hidden on the top side of the prisms. More extant double paintings are known from the 17th century. For instance Gaspard Antoine Bois-Clair made some double portraits in 1692, including one of Danish Prince Frederik IV (when viewed from the left) and his sister Sophie Hedevig (when viewed from the right).https://www.thecultureconcept.com/wp- content/uploads/2011/04/Bois-Clair-Portraits.pdf Trisceneoramas (with three images) were common at the end of the 19th century as souvenirs for tourists. Many other examples from the time have religious imagery.http://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2008/bridges2008-149.pdf On October 23, 1906 Hiram C.J. Deeks was granted US patent 834,048 (application November 25, 1904) for a \\"Material for printing multiple photographs\\" that used a similar technique. Photographic paper on cardboard was corrugated with a press to form minute ridges that were then exposed to two different images from two different angles. Under this patent H.C.J. Deeks & Co marketed postcards with changing photographs or drawings, first as Puzzle Post Card later as Photochange Post Card. The pictures in some notable examples would change from a person to a skeleton - depicted in similar position and size. Deeks also marketed a Colorchange Post Card with minute corrugations that had identical pictures on each side, but were sprayed with different \\"liquid pigment or coloring matter\\" on (parts of) each side. The process was granted US patent No. 856,519 on June 11, 1907 (application filed September 24, 1906). The basic principle of tabula scalata later provided the basis for lenticular printing.  Use on British Pound Coin  The UK Pound Coin introduced in 2017 bears a small embossed image that changes from a \\"¬£\\" symbol to a \\"1\\", described by the Royal Mint as \\"like a hologram\\", it is actually a tabula scalata.

Early life He was the son of David Brown, and younger brother of Charles Philip Brown. His father, a chaplain in Bengal, died in 1812, and his mother Frances (n√©e Cowley) then brought her family of eight children to London. In 1819 he was nominated for the East India College. Appointed as writer in 1820, he returned to India in November 1821, and was given posts at the assistant level, in the revenue and judicial systems, in 1823. Official In 1826 Brown had an acting judicial position in Futtehpore, and in 1827 in Allahabad. In 1830 he became judge in Jaunpur, and in 1831 also Collector there. In 1834 he was consulted by John Low on the state of affairs in Awadh. In 1835 Brown took 18 months furlough, in the Cape of Good Hope, for the sake of his health. In 1837 he was appointed Officiating (acting) Commissioner of Revenue at Bhagalpur (12th Circuit or Division). Also, that, he was appointed to Suheswan, but this was a post he never took up. His post at Bhagalpur was confirmed in 1854. Brown raised funds for a Gothic church in Bhagalpur. He also helped set up a Christian mission there, with the Rev. Frederick William Vaux. Santal rebellion The Santals settled in Damin-i- koh, a forested area. James Pontet had responsibility from 1837 for developing the area as a source of revenue. The Santals opposed other incomers, and the situation was disturbed in the mid-1850s by the building of a railway line. Santal leaders emerged, and led a rising. The rebels moved on the town of Barhait, and gained an initial victory at Pirpainti, against British forces led by Major F. W. Burroughs, sent from Bhagalpur. Brown made proclamations, and declared martial law, though he was later found to have erred procedurally. He persisted with claims that the rebellion was being promoted by agitators, and argued his case with Frederick James Halliday. But Alfred Clarke Bidwell was appointed special commissioner for the suppression of the insurrection. The rebels were defeated after fighting on a large scale, with thousands killed. Bidwell's report pointed a finger at Pontet, accused of failing to support the large number of Santal migrants to the area. The official view was that the local administration was at fault. A separate Santal Pargana district was created in 1855, under George Yule. Yule became also Commissioner at Bhagalpur, with Ashley Eden as deputy. Later life and death Brown retired from the East India Company service (retirement after 35 years of service became normal in 1854), and joined the Royal Institution in 1860. He died on 9 April 1871, and his will was proved in London. Family Brown married in 1830 Catharine Jemima Gane, third daughter of James Gane; she died at Putney on 6 December 1863. Their children included: * George James Cowley-Brown; * Francis David Millet Brown VC; * George Peploe Brown, Royal Artillery and artist (youngest son, died 1909), who married Harriette, daughter of William Wilberforce Bird;Bedfordshire Mercury, 12 March 1909 * Hannah Maria(h) Brown who married John Henry Pratt; and * Lucy Gisborne Brown, baptised 1836 at Rondebosch, South Africa, appears (as Browne and a spinster) in an official notice of her father's death as executor.

She has also previously played for Worcestershire, New South Wales Breakers, Tasmanian Roar and Hobart Hurricanes. Early life Born in Lismore, New South Wales, and raised in nearby Alstonville, Redmayne was the youngest of three children, and became a cricketer at an early age. She played backyard cricket against her elder brother, and her dentist father was a local coach who encouraged girls to play for boys' teams. In February 2005, she caused a stir when she took a double hat-trick (four wickets in four deliveries) for the Alstonville Maroon Under-12s. By then, she had already represented North Coast PSSA cricket team in two State carnivals; she later played NSW State underage cricket in the Under-15s, Under-17s, and Under-18s. While a student at Alstonville High School, Redmayne played for Combined High Schools. She broke almost every CHS girls' cricket batting record, won player of the carnival in her final two school years, and captained the CHS Firsts. At the age of 16, she and her father played men‚Äôs second grade together. In 2012, after gaining an ATAR score of 99.75, she took a gap year, organised by Stan Gilchrist, one of her coaches and father of former Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist, to play cricket for Worcestershire in England. In her first innings on English soil, she scored a century. New South Wales Breakers In August 2014, Redmayne was added to the New South Wales Breakers squad for the 2014‚Äì15 season. She made her Women's National Cricket League debut for the Breakers in the 2014‚Äì15 WNCL Final. In the 2015‚Äì16 season, playing for Universities in the McDonald‚Äôs Sydney Women‚Äôs Grade competition, Redmayne won the First Grade Player of the Year award. With a batting aggregate for the regular season of 656 runs at an average of 82.00, she scored nearly 200 runs more than the next best batter, and she was also part of the Universities team that won the Club Championship. However, she was denied more exposure to top-class cricket in NSW because of the presence of Australian 'keeper Alyssa Healy, to whom she was deputy. Tasmanian Roar and Hobart Hurricanes Redmayne batting for the Hobart Hurricanes during WBBL03 In May 2016, Redmayne, who had been contemplating retirement, was recruited by Tasmanian Roar for the 2016‚Äì17 WNCL season. The Roar's coach, Julia Price, told The Examiner that Redmayne would be able to assist the Roar's captain and vice-captain with field settings and tactics, and strengthen the batting order. In July 2016, Redmayne also joined Hobart Hurricanes for its WBBL02 campaign. Redmayne's move from the Breakers to the Roar soon paid off spectacularly. In October 2016, she became the first player for Tasmania to hit a WNCL century, which helped the Roar to a thrilling final-ball win against the ACT Meteors. She was immediately rewarded with an embrace by her 87-year-old grandfather, who had been watching the game and vaulted the fence in his excitement. The following month, Redmayne backed up that effort with a 116-run score against Western Fury; the Roar also won that match, by six wickets. Redmayne finished the 2016‚Äì17 season as the fourth-highest run scorer of the WNCL competition, with 295 runs in six matches at an average of 59. She also took three catches and made seven stumpings. In the ensuing WBBL02 tournament, she took seven catches, made five stumpings and scored 278 runs at an average of 23. In March 2017, she was named in the Shooting Stars squad for its March‚ÄìApril 2017 tour of Sri Lanka. Redmayne remained with the Roar and the Hurricanes for the 2017‚Äì18 season. During her first WNCL match of that season, she scored 89 against the Western Fury. At the end of the season, she won the Betty Wilson Young Women's Cricketer of the Year award for Australia's most promising rising player. The award was founded on a vote by Australian-based international, state and WBBL- contracted cricketers, and took into account performances in all of the WNCL, WBBL, and international games between 10 December 2016 and 28 November 2017. In November 2018, Redmayne was named in the Hobart Hurricanes' squad for the 2018‚Äì19 Women's Big Bash League season. Queensland Fire In May 2019, Redmayne was signed by Queensland Fire for the 2019‚Äì20 WNCL season. She was expected to take on a batter-only role, as the Fire already had keepers Beth Mooney and Josie Dooley in its squad. Personal life Off the field, Redmayne holds a Bachelor of Medical Studies and Doctor of Medicine awarded by the University of New South Wales, She graduated in 2018, and hopes to pursue a career in sports medicine. , she was combining her cricket career with working as a doctor at Tweed Hospital on the New South Wales-Queensland border. In 2013, Redmayne won the Bradman Foundation's Bradman Scholarship, and in 2016, UNSW awarded her a Ben Lexcen Sports Scholarship.

The game was developed by Thomas Brush, who created and designed it over a five-year period. It was published by Armor Games. Plot Pinstripe follows Teddy, a disgraced ex- minister, who is on a train with his three-year-old daughter, Bo. Ted encounters Pinstripe, a shadowy figure who is also on the train. After Bo is kidnapped by Pinstripe, and the train crashes into a town, Ted goes off to find Bo. Exploring the town, Ted finds his dog, George, who gives him advice throughout the game, and Bo's slingshot, which acts as a weapon. Throughout the town, the residents are drunk off of Sack Juice, which Pinstripe produces. Near the end of the game, clues collected by Ted imply that after his wife died, Ted began to drink, and soon after crashed his car, killing him and Bo, and also finds that Pinstripe is the name of the whisky he drank. Owning up to his mistakes, he faces off against Pinstripe, who wants to adopt Bo to take her away from Ted. After defeating Pinstripe, Ted enters a dark room, and George sacrifices himself to let Ted pass. The ending sees that Ted is reunited with Bo in a sunny field. Dialogue options earlier in the game decide if George is reunited with Ted and Bo. They come across a woman on a bench, presumed to be Bo's mother. The game then ends. Development Brush had been working on the game for four years, and it was originally slated for release on Steam and iOS in 2016. On February 16, 2016, a Kickstarter was launched to help finish with the game's development and so Brush could quit his job as a freelancer, with a goal of $28,000. The project had reached its funding goal within two days raising $42,494. The project ended on March 17, 2016, having raised $106,729, funding stretch goals that include a bonus level, voice acting and an extra mode. Thomas Brush created every aspect of the game himself, including the original score, artwork, programming, and writing, though several people did lend their voices to the game for various characters. The game finally released on April 25, 2017, and was localized into seven different languages. In his development postmortem for the game at Gamasutra, Brush credits Unity as being easy to learn and supported by plugins which were invaluable to his development. He warned others against using UnityScript, due to its excessive compilation time, and instead to use C#. Reception In 2016, Pinstripe was a finalist at the third SXSW Gaming Awards under the category 'Gamer's Voice Award (single player)'. Upon its release, the reviews were mixed. Jeremy Winslow, writing at GameSpot awarded the game 5/10, criticising the narrative as pedestrian, and \\"failing to inspire emotional attachment in [its] characters\\". For Winslow, this, and flaws in its puzzle design, combat and platforming overpowered the game's rich atmosphere. At Time, Matt Peckham was much more positive, awarding the game 5/5. Peckham described the game's depiction of hell as \\"a melange of beauty and horror\\" and compared it to the works of Bosch, Bruegel and Dante. He concluded the review, by reflecting on the themes raised by the game, \\"What does loss resemble? How does it sound? What if the museums to mistakes that we spend lifetimes assembling in our minds were a physical space?\\" References External links * Crowdfunded video games IOS games Linux games MacOS games Kickstarter-funded video games 2017 video games Video games developed in the United States Windows games Unity (game engine) games Adventure games Puzzle video games Single-player video games Nintendo Switch games PlayStation 4 games Xbox One games ","title":"Pinstripe (video game)"},{"id":"53591850","title":"List of ambassadors of Liberia to China"},{"id":"53591867","text":"The 1st Cavalry Division (, 1-ya Kavaleriiskaya Diviziya) was a cavalry formation of the Russian Imperial Army.

It became part of the Imperial fief and was ruled by a number of Genoese noble families, including the Dora, Fieschi and Spinola. It became part of the short-lived Ligurian Republic in 1797, subsequently joining Mongiardino Ligure, became a hamlet in the comune of Mongiardino Ligure until 1958 when it was transferred to Cabella Ligure. The current parish church, San Martino, was constructed in the latter part of the 19th Century after the old church collapsed in a landslide in 1870. The church is part of the Diocese of Tortona. In 1908, an aqueduct was constructed using pipes from a ship abandoned at the port of Genoa.

Educated in Italy, and serving since 1592 as the metropolitan bishop of Larissa (though he was based in Trikala, as Larissa was scarcely Christian), Dionysios had in 1598 sent a monk from Ioannina to the Republic of Venice to urge the Greek community there to request ammunition and arms from Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor, Philip III of Spain, and Pope Clement VIII for a Greek rebellion. Orthodox Christian leaders had requested aid from Western powers in the previous years (i.e. in Banat, Himara, and Herzegovina). In 1599 or early 1600, inhabitants of Epirus, Macedonia, and Thessaly assured the Pope through correspondence that they were ready to die for Christianity and asked him to rise against the Ottoman Empire, to save them from 'the relentless tyrant'. Although the mission was deemed a failure, Dionysios was persistent, and began holding on to the poll tax and ecclesiastical revenues which in fact was to be handed over to the Orthodox Patriarchate. Breaking out in the autumn of 1600, the rebellion was quickly suppressed, with harsh reprisal. Laymen and priests were executed, including Bishop Serapheim of Phanari (who was later proclaimed a Neomartyr).

Overall, however, the book is suspenseful and exciting.\\" A New Scientist review summarised the book concluding \\"It also contains Heinrich's own - and excellent - drawings of the various raven postures, a comprehensive review of the literature, beginning with the Bible, and even a section of the ravens of the Tower of London.\\" Psychologists acknowledge that \\"Heinrich's helpful ravens [as discussed in Ravens in Winter] are now a classic example of animal altruism\\" It was a Evergreen Audubon & Nature Center Book of the Month.

Raised by her mother following her father's death when she was four years old, she moved out of her family home as a teenager and served her first prison sentence at the age of 18, by which time she was already working as a prostitute. She received many convictions for prostitution, public order offences and theft in subsequent years. In 1901 she married shoemaker Ebenezer Rushbrook, and continued to work as a prostitute and thief. The couple moved to Bridgend, and although both Selina and Ebenezer Rushbrook were convicted of theft in 1902 she appears not to have come to the attention of the authorities for the three years following that incident. In late 1905 or early 1906 the Rushbrooks separated, and Selina returned to Swansea to work as a prostitute. In February 1907, while leading prospective client Ernest Witts towards a secluded area of Swansea Docks, she fell from a footbridge into the lock. Although Witts attempted to grab her he failed to reach her and was left holding her shawl. He made no further effort to save her as he was unable to swim and instead went to fetch help; roughly three hours later, police recovered her body from the lock. In her lifetime, Rushbrook attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts. Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s‚Äì1914. Early life alt=low stone church Born in June 1880 in Swansea, Selina Ann Jenkins was the eldest of the three children of Francis James Jenkins and Catherine Jenkins; she was baptised into the Church of England at Christ Church in Oystermouth Road. A basket maker from Cornwall, Francis Jenkins settled with his family at 114 Rodney Street in Swansea. Francis Jenkins died in May 1885 at the age of 30, leaving Catherine Jenkins to raise the couple's three daughters alone. In 1887 Catherine married mason John Collins, having two children by him. By early 1899, Selina was no longer living with her family, but had moved into Vaughan's lodging house on The Strand, Swansea. Selina Jenkins first came to the attention of the authorities in February 1899, when she was arrested for riotous behaviour. Given the choice of seven days' hard labour in Swansea Prison or a 13s 6d fine (about ¬£ in terms), she opted for the custodial sentence, the first of her many spells in prison; the prison records describe her as being 5 feet 2 inches (159 cm) tall, with brown hair, an imperfect education and an occupation of prostitute. Adult life In June 1899, Jenkins was convicted of \\"offences against decency in a lane near the Sailors' Rest\\" with Swansea resident Thomas O'Connell. Jenkins and O'Connell were each sentenced to a ¬£1 fine (about ¬£ in terms) or 10 days' imprisonment. A report at the time in the South Wales Daily Post described both O'Connell and Jenkins as looking \\"very shamefaced\\". Soon afterwards she had progressed from prostitution to procuring, operating a brothel in Welsh Harp Court, Swansea. On 19 September 1899 PC Umpleby and PC Hockings attended the brothel, and \\"witnessed circumstances which irrefutably stamped the house as being used for immoral purposes\\". Sentenced to a ¬£10 3s 6d fine (about ¬£ in terms) or a month's hard labour, Jenkins told the judge \\"Oh, I'll take the month\\", and was duly sent to Swansea Prison on 2 October 1899. A report on the case in the Western Mail described Selina Jenkins as \\"a very young-looking woman\\". Shortly after her release she was arrested for disorderly conduct, and in November 1899 was sentenced to seven days' imprisonment, this time without being given the option to pay a fine in lieu of a custodial sentence. On her release her career of petty crime continued. On 17 April 1900 she was again arrested for riotous behaviour, and on 11 May of that year was duly sentenced to seven days' imprisonment. alt=short-haired woman holding a board with \\"Selina Jenkins\\" written on it Following her release in mid-May Jenkins moved out of Vaughan's lodging house into new lodgings at 4 Owens Court, Swansea. She avoided coming to the notice of the authorities for the next few months, but had progressed from prostitution to more serious crimes. In October 1900 Jenkins was convicted, along with fellow prostitutes Mary Ann Rumph and Mary Ann Howlett, of the theft of a half sovereign and half crown (12s 6d in total, about ¬£ in terms) from Benjamin Williams in the Bird-in-Hand pub in the High Street. All three were sentenced to a month's hard labour. On her release Jenkins again avoided the attention of the police, other than a single conviction for public drunkenness for which she received a seven-day prison sentence. She moved into new accommodation in Neptune Court, and in May 1901 married shoemaker Ebenezer Rushbrook, with whom she had lived for the previous five months. Married life Married life appears to have had little impact on Selina Rushbrook's lifestyle. In June 1901 an unidentified woman (likely to have been Selina Rushbrook) was arrested by PC Maggs of the Swansea Borough Police. As Maggs attempted to march her to the police station, Ebenezer Rushbrook approached the pair, told the officer that the woman in question was his wife, and demanded she be released. PC Maggs declined to do so; the woman fell to the floor, and as Maggs bent to hold her Ebenezer Rushbrook jumped onto his back and knocked his hat off to the ground. As Maggs reached to collect his hat the woman took the opportunity to flee; Ebenezer was duly arrested and sentenced to a fine of 40s (about ¬£ in terms) or one month's imprisonment. (Ebenezer Rushbrook claimed that he had not intervened until he saw PC Maggs kicking the woman while she was on the floor.) Shortly afterwards, in August 1901, Ebenezer was convicted of \\"knowingly living on the earnings of his wife's immorality\\", and sentenced to three months' hard labour. In December of that year Selina was convicted of the theft of a purse from a sailor, and sentenced to two months' hard labour owing to her lengthy criminal record; her accomplice, fellow prostitute Rose Willis, received the lighter sentence of one month's imprisonment.The Cambrian, 6 December 1901, quoted alt=two-storey stone building behind a high fence Soon after her release, the Rushbrooks moved to Bridgend. The move did not reduce the couple's criminal activities, and in November 1902 Selina was convicted, along with fellow prostitute Sarah Musgrove, of stealing a watch in the York Hotel, Bridgend from William Howells of Coity. Ebenezer was convicted of receiving the watch in question and pawning it, and all three were sentenced to one month's hard labour. Following this conviction, the Rushbrooks disappeared from police attention until late 1905, when Ebenezer received a 14-day custodial sentence for \\"behaving like a madman\\" towards police. After this incident the couple separated, with Selina returning to Vaughan's lodging house in Swansea. Arrested on 17 November 1905 along with her friends Catherine Driscoll and Lily Argent for the theft of a sea-captain's purse, all three were found not guilty. Other than this incident, the only occasion on which she came to police notice was an incident in late 1906 when her neighbour William Jones was sentenced to a month's imprisonment for giving her two black eyes and knocking her into a telegraph pole. Death In the early hours of 17 February 1907, shortly after midnight, Selina Rushbrook was walking near Swansea Docks in the company of King's Dock labourer Ernest Witts. According to Witts's testimony, he had met Rushbrook in the Engineers' Inn at 8:30 the previous evening, where he had bought her a drink. The two had left the pub separately, but had met again at another pub where he bought her another drink, and at around 11 pm she \\"made a suggestion\\" to which he agreed. Rushbrook led him to Pottery Bridge, a drawbridge separating North Dock from a canal. While crossing the narrow bridge Rushbrook caught her foot on a beam, and fell into the lock below. Although Witts tried to catch her he failed to do so, only managing to grab her shawl. Witts, still holding Rushbrook's shawl, approached a police officer in the High Street and informed him of what had happened, and soon afterwards police arrived at the scene with grappling irons. The water level in the lock was lowered, and at 3 am Rushbrook's body was recovered. She had just 6s 5d (about ¬£ in terms) in her possession when she died. At the subsequent inquest, held at the nearby Adelaide Hotel on 18 February, Witts testified that after Rushbrook had fallen from the bridge he made no attempt to save her as he was unable to swim. A verdict of accidental death was recorded, and at the direction of the coroner the jury added a note that inadequate lighting had made the area around Pottery Bridge a dark and dangerous place at night and that the local authority should take steps to improve lighting. The coroner commended Witts for his honesty for giving \\"the bald ugly truth\\" in his account of events, and conceded that in intentionally leading Witts to a place where they were unlikely to be seen or heard Rushbrook had harmed the chances of her being rescued. However, the coroner strongly criticised Witts for making no attempt to rescue Rushbrook, saying that \\"probably his muddled state through drink was his only excuse\\", and warned him to give up his lifestyle, to which Witts replied \\"Yes, sir\\". Selina Rushbrook was buried in the Jenkins family plot in Danygraig cemetery.

In her work, she combines elements of sculpture, installation, performance, video art and black and white photography. Her work focuses on the development and presentation of individual mythologies. Life and work Sheehan studied at the Parsons School of Design and the New School of Social Research in New York. Until 1994, she lived and worked in New York City, after which she emigrated to Cologne. The term Individual Mythology, originally coined by Harald Szeemann on the occasion of the documenta 5, denotates a mode in which artists create works from their subjective inner perception as these relate, in their mythological qualities, to recurring events in human life, such as birth, death, etc. It follows that these art installations have a puzzling effect on the viewer. The ambiguity of the presented impulses invites reflection by, and resonance within, the viewers themselves. Sheehan's main interest lies in the narrative interweaving of complex interrelationships. Through her use of varied media, she achieves a multi-dimensional world of experience in which everything relates to the given locations and her studies of them. For the exhibition alighting (2015), for example, Sheehan produced a video entitled alighting on the river, which mirrors the two main themes in the history of the city of Augsburg, namely the textile manufacturing and the river Lech, which flows through Augsburg. A woman in a plain dress walks barefoot, each step slow and deliberate, along a river bank. She wears a white kerchief and puts down under a willow, the coarse linen sack and black stone which she carried in her arms like a child or her own soul. Then, she turns her back to the viewer of the black-and-white video and steps into the water which soon reaches her thighs. Cut. The next scene shows nothing but water, the rushing river. The End. (in German: Eine Frau in einem schlichten Kleid geht barfu√ü, jeder Schritt langsam und tastend, an einem Flussufer entlang. Sie tr√§gt ein wei√ües Kopftuch und legt unter einer Weide den Sack aus grobem Leinen und den schwarzen Stein ab, den sie wie ein Kind oder ihre Seele in den Armen trug. Dann dreht sie dem Betrachter des in Schwarz-Wei√ü gedrehten Videos den R√ºcken zu und schreitet ins Wasser, das ihr bald bis zu den Oberschenkeln reicht. Schnitt. Die n√§chste Einstellung zeigt nichts als Wasser, den dahinstr√∂menden Fluss. Ende.) The exhibition was opened by a performance in which Sheehan ‚Äì encased in a hessian sack ‚Äì crawls into the room to gradually free herself from this cover. The main part of the exhibition was conceived around self-staged, photographic, self-portrait in black and white photography, in which she deals physically with themes such as birth, stillbirth, loss, healing and transformation. For the exhibition Soulfood (2003) at the Fuhrwerkswaage in Cologne, she installed the ingredients for 2000 kg of rice pudding in triangular formation: two open cubes together with one hanging sack; ingredients not only for a comfort food for children and adults, but essential to basic nutrition of large portions of the world's population: [‚Ä¶] she combines the purism of the empty, utilitarian space with the modern concept of minimalism to create the aura of a still life of motherly care. (in german: [‚Ä¶] sie verbindet den Purismus des ausger√§umten Nutzraumes mit dem Minimalismus moderner Positionen zur Aura eines Stillebens m√ºtterlicher F√ºrsorge.) For Visitors and other Beings (2011) in Siegburg, Germany, Sheehan created beings - in varying sizes, from giants over two meters high, to tiny forms of existence which one instinctively wants to protect. Although these creatures are made of textiles and seem like cuddly animals, on closer inspection they emerge rather as creepy and disturbingly alien. This impression is reinforced by the accompanying photographs: For this the artist took to the razor, partly removed the plush from the resin faces and partly formed it into hairstyles and eyebrows. Greatly enlarged, these panels are suggestive in their own way: The human figure seems to emerge from the plush toy. The observer becomes witness to a moulting process.

For Under the Skin (2001), Sheehan conceived a kind of breeding station for the Lehmbruck Museum, in which entities, mutually isolated in transparent plastic, were nourished by tubes and investigated for apparently scientific purposes. They appeared soft and slimy, not entirely finished, or still in the process of maturing. Additionally, she created a video entitled Single Opening, in which she appeared as Professor Dr. Nurse and explained that the creatures are the result of the recreation of a monotreme, which she calls Maboutae. It possesses one great economic advantage: it has only one body opening and produces a special milk. She sarcastically caricatures them as an absurd research focus and our amateurish ideas about the possibility of genetic engineering and its economic advantages. (in German:Sarkastisch karikiert sie damit abseitige Forschungsschwerpunkte und unsere laienhaften Vorstellungen von den M√∂glichkeit der Gentechnik und deren √∂konomischen Vorteilen.) Like a kind of human seismograph, Sheehan senses energies of the rooms in which she works and exhibits. Based on them, she develops her installations and performances: There is a place of fertile tension between desire and consciousness, between looking out at the world and looking back in to the self. I go to this place to gather and form images, objects, actions and words. I meld with a material, until the physical experience sparks my practice. The actions I take are guided by this charge. In a state of heightened awareness, I sense the poignancy of a presence wanting to be manifested in my hands, asking to be born and shared. (in German: Es gibt einen Ort der fruchtbaren Spannung zwischen Wunsch und Bewusstsein, zwischen dem Blick auf die Welt und Retrospektive in das Selbst. Ich gehe an diesen Ort, um Bilder, Gegenst√§nde, Handlungen nd Worte zu sammeln und zu bilden. Ich verschmelze mit dem Material, bis das physische Erleben meine Praxis anregt. Die Handlungen, die ich durchf√ºhre, sind davon bestimmt. In einem Stadium erh√∂hter Aufmerksamkeit f√ºhle ich die Dringlichkeit einer Anwesenheit, die durch meine H√§nde manifestiert werden m√∂chte, und darum bittet, geboren und vermittelt/geteilt zu werden.)

History As a result of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, an industrial development certificate (IDC) had to be obtained from the government (Board of Trade, and later the Department of Trade and Industry (formed in 1970) which became the Department of Industry in 1974) if a company wanted to expand an industrial plant beyond a regulated area of 5,000 square feet, before the company could seek planning permission for that industrial development.19 June 1968 The planning permission could then be refused. It allowed central government to have direct control over where industry could and could not be built. The government could influence the siting of industry. Companies were also encouraged to open new factories in a government-authorised Development Area, also known as an assisted area. The Industry Act 1972 allowed areas of the UK to be given assistance for industrial development (Section 7 and Section 8). The Industrial Development Act 1966 and Local Employment Act 1970 also designated the areas where the government wanted industry to be sited. On 4 December 1981, the IDC scheme was suspended, as it was believed by the government that it was a psychological barrier to new investment, although it was believed that the scheme had been of help in the 1960s and early 1970s. From 1975 to 1981, out of 7,000 applications for an IDC, only 28 had been refused - a refusal rate of 0.4%. Although not issued after 1981, IDCs were legally abolished under the Town and County Planning Act 1986.

It was fought between the Este troops of the Ferrara Regency Council fighting in the name of the young Niccol√≤ III d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara and the rebel forces of his uncle, Azzo X d'Este, pretender to the Lordship of Ferrara. Background After the death of Alberto d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, he was succeeded by his legitimated son Niccol√≤, who was still a minor. His uncle Azzo claimed the title on the grounds of Niccol√≤'s young age and his legitimacy, but was rebuffed by the Regency Council (a council formed to rule Ferrara during Niccol√≤'s minority). Azzo therefore organised a military force by the hiring of mercenaries. The battle The two armies met at Portomaggiore, some 10 miles (15 kilometers) south-west of the city of Ferrara. The Regency Council forces were under the command of Astorre Manfredi, a condottiero (mercenary leader) who had once formed the Compagnia della Stella, a private mercenary army. He had the support of troops from Florence, Bologna, Venice, and Carrara. Azzo's force of mercenaries was led by the condottiero Giovanni da Barbiano. The Regency Council troops quickly attacked Azzo's 8,000 strong army, eventually forcing them to retreat and seek refuge in the castle, where they were ultimately forced to surrender. Azzo's forces lost some 1,000 men and Azzo himself was captured. Regency Council losses were limited. References *P. Orsi - Signorie e principati (1300-1530) - Milano, Ed.

The company's flagship product was a cloud gaming service of the same name, launched on March 24, 2017 and shut down in 2018. Announced at Consumer Electronics Show 2017, the service aimed to tackle issues that other providers struggle with, including latency and input lag. Its major competitors include Sony's PlayStation Now and NVIDIA's GeForce Now for PC and Mac.  History  The company was founded in 2014 by Ian McLoughlin and Scott Johnson as LiquidSky Software Inc. Prior to founding LiquidSky, McLoughlin had expressed displeasure of how existing cloud gaming solutions handled latency and input lag, particularly OnLive. Ian stated that his goal when founding LiquidSky was to offer a service with minimal latency and input lag, thus offering a cleaner experience for gamers. Testing began sometime around late 2014, with the company quietly bringing in waves of testers to try out the service. The company found success, raising almost $12 million in funding for the service. At the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, after roughly two years of testing, McLoughlin and the company announced that the service would be launching in Q1 2017, with an ad-supported plan, upgraded datacenter hardware, and a redesigned client. Other shown off included concepts for standalone hardware and demo footage of Battlefield 1 running at 60 FPS. Originally slated for release on March 14, 2017, it was delayed to March 24, 2017, due to server issues and launched with support for Microsoft Windows. On July 11, 2017, LiquidSky updated their Android client to reflect the launch of the service. The company stated that support for macOS was in development. LiquidSky shut down their service on December 17th, 2018 while they focus their efforts on building a new streaming platform. As of 2018, LiquidSky was acquired by Walmart and now focusing on other projects.  Features  Among the features stated for LiquidSky were low latency, fast intranet speeds, up-to-date hardware, and different storage plans. The service had 6 datacenters worldwide, including: * San Jose, California * Dallas, Texas * Washington, DC * London, England * Frankfurt, Germany * Hong Kong Datacenters in Chennai, India; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Sydney, Australia; and Mexico were available at launch, but were discontinued due to lack of user adoption compared to more developed countries. Additionally, the platform lacked local language translation, faced VAT taxes, and payment processing fees for the centers.  Reception  LiquidSky has received attention from various online news outlets, including Engadget, VentureBeat, Time, IGN, PCGamer, and PCGamesN, with many claiming that the service succeeded where previous services such as OnLive failed.

Called the \\"Flor del trabajo\\" (Labor flower), Cano led the struggle for basic civil rights and for the rights of salaried workers. She was the leader of several workers' strikes and a co-founder of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Early life and education Cano was born on 12 August 1887 in Medell√≠n in Antioquia Department to Don Rodolfo Cano and Dona Amelia M√°rquez, educated and influential Radical Liberals. She had two sisters. She was educated in secular rather than Catholic schools. Colombian women were not at the time permitted to attend University. Both of Cano's parents died when she was 23. Career Cano a literary circle and magazine called Cyrano with other intellectuals from Medell√≠n. By 1922, she was working for the newspaper El correo liberal (\\"The Liberal Mail\\"). Her writing and poetry had an \\"intimate and erotic\\" tone. In March 1924, she expressed a desire to open a free public library, inviting newspapers and bookstores to donate materials, and by May a municipal library had begun. Cano was involved in political circles influenced by the Bolshevik Revolution and became a socialist. She abandoned writing purely for artistic reasons and became a social activist and revolutionary leader. As well as providing food and clothing to people in need, she did readings at the library to raise the cultural awareness of workers. She visited factories and began denouncing the unfair working conditions and organising strikes. On 1 May 1925, Colombia's Labor Day, Cano was given the name the \\"Labor flower of Medell√≠n\\", an honorific title usually given to charity workers that she used as a political platform. She became a symbol for rebellious women, and \\"parents in Antioquia sought to prevent their daughters from becoming mariacanos.\\" From 1925‚Äì1927, Cano made seven tours of the country. Her first rallies were held at the mines of Sevilla and Remedios. She was instrumental in the liberation of Ra√∫l Eduardo Mahecha. In 1926, the National Workers Confederation gave her the responsibility of organising Antioquia's representation at the Third Labor Congress. At the congress she interviewed the government secretary, calling for the release of political prisoners Vicente Adame and Manuel Quint√≠n Lame, making her the first women to occupy a leadership position in a political organisation in Colombia. She was declared the \\"Labor flower of Colombia\\". She was instrumental in the founding of the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1926. She spoke out against the death penalty alongside former President Carlos Eugenio Restrepo. Cano was arrested several times and placed under police surveillance. Several of her rallies were broken up by police in riot gear. She spoke out against social injustice amongst the elite, the government's repression of opposition and the practices of US companies. Cano co-founded the party newspaper, La justicia and wrote for numerous other publications. In 1928, she led the fight against the government's ley heroica, a law designed to suppress communism. She also supported Nicaraguan leader Augusto C√©sar Sandino against the invasion of US troops. In November 1928, a strike of banana plantation workers culminated in a massacre of workers at a demonstration at Ci√©naga, Magdalena on 6 December. Although Cano was not present, she was charged with conspiracy and imprisoned. She became politically isolated after an ideological split in the socialist ranks and was unsuccessful in a 1934 attempt at returning to politics. Cano left Bogot√° and worked for the Antioquia State Press in Medell√≠n. The Medell√≠n Women's Alliance recognised her contributions in 1945, and in 1960 she was appointed as speaker for the Democratic Organization of Antioquia Women. Personal life Cano lived with communist writer and orator Ignacio Torres Giraldo. Death and legacy Cano died in Medell√≠n on 26 April 1967. In 1990, Camila Loboguerrero directed a Colombian film called Maria Cano, starring Maria Eugenia D√°vila as Cano filmed in Salamina-Caldas. In Antioquia, there is a street, two schools and a University named after Cano. In 1991, the labor organization The Flor del Trabajo Association was created in Funza. Its name was changed on 23 March 2013 to the Association Maria Cano.

The construction of the votive stairway was begun in 1531. due to the Croatian warlord captain (Petar Kru≈æiƒá), who excelled in the battles with the Turks. Petar Kru≈æiƒá built the lower part of the staircase way leading to the Basilica of Notre-Dame of Trsat, today is Church of Our Lady of Trsat dated 15th century. It is why this staircase was named Petar Kru≈æiƒá stairway. Later the stairway was extended up to 561 steps. One of the votive chapels along this stairway was created in 15th century and another one in 18th century. The baroque chapel and legend The porch at the foot of the stairway leading to Trsat has a statue of \\"Virgin with Child\\" dating from 1745. There is a legend about the Trsat stairway. It says that the Franciscans made a deal with the Devil: if he makes a stairway, he will have a soul who climbs the stairway first. After some deliberation, the Devil accepted. Once he finished the work, the Devil waited for the victim. However, the Franciscans let a goat climb the stairway. The Devil was so enraged that he mixed the steps, so that nobody had been able to count them to this day! The legend is based on the fact that the stairway was extended on several occasions. When it was first built in 1531 by Petar Kru≈æiƒá, the captain of the Uskoks, there were about a hundred steps. Today, their number exceeds 500. The beginning of the steep ascent as votive repositories of dignitaries. A unique experience is to climb the Trsat steps in the procession on the Feast of the Assumption. Even today, some pilgrims practise the ancient votive tradition of climbing the steps on their knees.

It was initially proposed that the newly reopened line could terminate at a new station, close to the Woodhorn Colliery Museum and Northumberland Archives, rather than at , the previous station however revised plans, released in July 2019 appear to have dropped Woodhorn station from project scope. Development In the early 2010s, Northumberland County Council (NCC) became interested in restoring passenger services along the remaining freight- only section of the former Blyth and Tyne Railway between Benton Junction and Woodhorn. In June 2013 NCC commissioned Network Rail to complete a GRIP 1 study to examine the best options for the scheme. The GRIP 1 study was received by NCC in March 2014 and in June 2015 they initiated a more detailed GRIP 2 Feasibility Study at a cost of ¬£850,000. The GRIP 2 study, which NCC received in October 2016, confirmed that the reintroduction of a frequent seven-day a week passenger service between Newcastle and Ashington was feasible and could provide economic benefits of ¬£70 million with more than 380,000 people using the line each year by 2034. The study suggested a new station should be built as a terminus of the newly reopened line. At the time it was suggested that, subject to funding being raised for the ¬£191 million scheme, detailed design work could begin in October 2018 with construction commencing four months later and the first passenger services introduced in 2021 though by October 2018 such works were yet to begin. After receiving the GRIP 2 study, NCC initially announced that they were preceding with a GRIP 3 Study from Network Rail but such a report was not commissioned at the time. Despite a change in the political leadership of Northumberland County Council following the 2017 local elections the authority continued to work towards the reintroduction of a passenger service onto the line, encouraged by the Department for Transport's November 2017 report, A Strategic Vision for Rail, which named the line as a possible candidate for a future reintroduction of passenger services. Consequentially, NCC commissioned a further interim study in November 2017 (dubbed GRIP 2B) to determine whether high costs and long timescales identified in the GRIP 2 Study could be reduced by reducing the initial scope of the project but the report failed to deliver on this. Despite this, the county council has continued to develop the project, announcing a further ¬£3.46 million in funding for a further business case and detailed design study (equivalent to GRIP 3) to be completed by the end of 2019. It is envisaged that passenger trains could be introduced as early as 2022. However, the revised proposals, released in July 2019, are reduced in scope from the plan considered in the 2016 GRIP 2 study and propose 4-phase project to reduce the initial cost of the scheme. Under these plans, the new station at Woodhorn appears to have been dropped in favour of creating new turn-back facilities at Ashington.

Bose National Fellow of the Department of Biotechnology and an elected fellow of all the three major Indian science academies viz. National Academy of Sciences, India, Indian Academy of Sciences, and Indian National Science Academy. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards for his contributions to Medical Sciences in 2001.  Biography  Jawaharlal Nehru University B. N. Mallick, born on 1 August 1956 at Jamalpur, a small village in the Indian state of Bihar to Manju Mukherjee and Baidya Nath Mallick. He received his BSc hons at the University of Calcutta in 1978 winning B. K. S. Medal for standing first in City College, Kolkata and earned a master's degree in physiology in 1981 with a University Gold Medal for securing the first rank in the university. While pursuing his master's studies, he simultaneously did a medical course at Calcutta Homoeopathic Medical College and obtained a degree in homeopathic medicine (DMS) from the Central Council of Homoeopathy. Subsequently, he moved to Delhi for his doctoral studies, and joined the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi as a teaching fellow in 1981. By the time he secured a PhD for his thesis on neurophysiology of sleep- wakefulness in 1986 from AIIMS, he had already worked there as a senior demonstrator during 1983‚Äì86. He moved to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in 1986 as an assistant professor at the School of Life Sciences and, moved up the ranks to the position ofa professor. He also heads the Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Laboratory, where he hosts a number of scholars and research students. In between, he had five sabbaticals; as a research associate (1987‚Äì88) and as a visiting associate professor (March‚ÄìJuly 1995 and March‚ÄìJuly 1997) at University of California, Los Angeles, as a visiting assistant professor at Harvard Medical School (March‚ÄìJuly 1993) and at University of Nice Sophia Antipolis as a guest professor (November‚ÄìDecember 2002). Mallick is married to Roma Banerjee and the couple has two children. The family lives in the Dakshinapuram campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University.  Career  Rapid eye movement of a dog Mallick carried his doctoral research on sleep and wakefulness on to his later career and worked on the neural mechanisms involved with sleep. His studies combined the electrophysiological and biochemical aspects of rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) and he established that the increased production of noradrenaline activated neuronal Na+/K+-ATPase, triggering REM sleep-loss and resultant brain excitability. According to him, REM sleep maintains brain excitability and suggested that this unique phase of sleep could be regulated by ceasing REM-off neurons present in the locus coeruleus; his research has been documented by way of texts and articles and ResearchGate, an online repository of scientific articles have listed 108 of them. Besides, he has published four books viz. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep, Sleep-Wakefulness, Environment and Physiology and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep: Regulation and Function; the first listed, which is a monograph co-edited with Shojiro Inoue, is reported to be the first book published on REM sleep. He has also contributed chapters to books published by others and his work has been cited in a number of publications. He is a member of the Neurobiology Task force of the Department of Biotechnology.  Awards and honors  Mallick received B. K. Anand Prize of the Association of Physiologists and Pharmacologists of India in 1984 for the best research paper in physiology and the Shakuntala Amir Chand Award of the Indian Council of Medical Research in 1992. He was one of the first recipients of the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology in 1999. The National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as a fellow in 2000 and he received the Chandra Kanta Dandiya Prize of P. C. Dandiya Trust in 2001. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards the same year and he became an elected member of Guha Research Conference in 2004.

It was formed by the amalgamation of the National Union of Teachers and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in 2017. With 510,000 members, it is the largest education union in the UK. Governance and administration The NEU came into being on 1 September 2017. At that time a Joint Executive Council was formed with the existing structures of the NUT and ATL continuing to function as sections of the new union. Full amalgamation took place on 1 January 2019 and a new Executive Committee was elected. The existing general secretaries of the NUT and ATL, Kevin Courtney and Mary Bousted, will serve as joint general secretaries of the new union until 2023 when a single general secretary will be elected. History =National Union of Teachers= The NUT was established at a meeting at King's College London on 25 June 1870 as the National Union of Elementary Teachers (NUET) to represent all school teachers in England and Wales, combining a number of local teacher associations which had formed across the country following the Elementary Education Act 1870. After toying with the idea of changing the name to the National Union of English Teachers, the name National Union of Teachers (NUT) was finally adopted at Annual Conference in April 1889. =Association of Teachers and Lecturers= The origins of ATL go back to 1884 when 180 women met to create the Association of Assistant Mistresses (AAM). These women worked in schools founded for higher education of girls. Their concern was primarily for the pupils. However, in 1921, the AAM appointed representatives to the newly formed Burnham Committee on Salaries in Secondary Schools. The Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools (AMA) was formed in 1891. Its purpose was to protect and improve the conditions of service of secondary teachers. Between 1899 and 1908 it played an influential part in obtaining security of tenure for assistant teachers through the Endowed Schools Act. In 1978 AAM and AMA merged to form the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association (AMMA), with a membership of approximately 75,000. The name was changed in 1993 to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). =National Education Union= The NUT and ATL agreed to pursue a merger during their autumn conferences in late 2016. A ballot of members of both unions took place between 27 February and 21 March 2017. The results were announced the following day and resulted in 97% of NUT members and 73% of ATL members who returned their ballot papers supporting the merger proposals. Logo and corporate identity A logo for the new union was launched on 30 June 2017. The logo features a starburst of pentagons with the name of the union written at the centre. Despite being a proper noun, the name is stylised in the logo in all lower case letters as \\"national education union\\" rather than \\"National Education Union\\". The union uses the strapline \\"together we'll shape the future of education\\". Fred and Anne Jarvis Award Named after former NUT General Secretary Fred Jarvis and his late wife, the Fred and Anne Jarvis Award was established by the NUT in 2007 and presented annually, originally to individuals other than NUT members who campaigned tirelessly for all children and young people. From 2019 the award has been presented by the NEU.

He published the novel The Devil's Glove. The San Jose Mercury Newspaper described his life as an \\"eye-popping head swivel.\\" Biography =Early life= Born in Flushing, New York, Agnello was a student at Western Connecticut State University when he became a stripper. He earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1992. Agnello worked as a stripper in New York to work his way through college. He later operated World Famous Cousin Vinny's Gorgeous Strippers. In 1986, he appeared on \\"Regis and Kathie Lee Live.\\" At about the same time, Agnello dabbled in acting, appearing on the soap operas \\"Guiding Light,\\" \\"Ryan's Hope\\" and \\"One Life to Live.\\" Later he would be a featured guest on The O'Reilly Factor, Hannity and Colmes, and Judith Regan Tonight among others. He was news. As a stripper, his fame was so out there, he was a guest on Regis and Kathie Lee Live. He was driven by media attention. But something snapped in him after he was shot in 2008. One bullet hit Agnello's left upper thigh and another was blocked by the wad of credit cards he was carrying in his pocket. At the time, he was wearing $100,000 worth of jewelry and police determined the shooting was a botched robbery. He realized he was mortal. In 2011, he returned to a novel that he had begun writing 20 years earlier: \\"The Devil's Glove.\\" Published by the Christian-based Tate Publishing group, October 2013, \\"The Devil's Glove\\" is the fictional tale of minor league baseball player Billy Green, who has lost his way after years of disappointment and summons a \\"mysterious stranger who promises to help him cheat his way on to the big stage of major league baseball if he lives up to the terms of a nefarious agreement.\\" On the surface, the 371-page soft cover novel sounds a bit like \\"Damn Yankees\\" and/or a retelling of the classic German tale of \\"Faust.\\" And it definitely is a precautionary tale about the temptations of evil. But the reviews are coming in, strong and sturdy for a good read. It has been called a \\"spiritual thriller,\\" a \\"timeless tale that will renew your faith in God and human nature.\\" Barnes & Noble writes that \\"The Devil's Glove\\" is \\"mostly baseball, partly supernatural and inspirational. (It is) a book that defies easy description by an author who defies description.\\" The book has garnered national attention and led to a book-signing tour with stops at multiple U.S. cities. In February 2014, Agnello kicked off a long U.S. book signing tour. He's been in Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, Tennessee, Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and the list just keeps traveling. Right before his two book signings in Pacifica, he'll have made California stops in Bakersfield, Palmdale, Visalia, Fresno, Turlock, Tracy, Stockton and San Jose. There will be more California stops before he heads home for a bit to take a holiday break. Agnello notes the book is \\"bigger than him\\" and he is more of a \\"messenger\\" than an author. Judging by the long, long line of people of all ages that look out from the author's Facebook page, each looking genuinely pleased as they hold a \\"Devil's Glove\\" copy and pose with Agnello, this messenger might really be onto something. =Books= He released the book The Devil's Glove, a Christian morality tale, in 2014. Agnello recently completed the sequel to The Devil's Glove called The Revenge of the Manager. In 2014 Adweek opened their feature on \\"Cousin Vinny\\" by saying, \\"If you've forgotten or never read about Agnello's incredible life story, do yourself a favor and take the time to digest the details of Savannah Morning News entertainment writer Linda Sickler's profile piece.\\"http://savannahnow.com/do/2014-03-27/former-stripper-king-new-york- writes-inspirational-book References External links *Former stripper king of New York-writes-inspirational-book *Interview on Youtube *Interview on Youtube *Devil's Glove interview Wichita KS. * 1960 births American male writers Living people ","title":"Louis &quot;Cousin Vinny&quot; Agnello"},{"id":"53593071","text":"Mab√≠lio Albuquerque (born 3 June 1969) is a Portuguese swimmer.

Owned by Princeton University, it is operated by Renew Theaters, a non-profit which manages golden-age movie theaters. The theater shows first run movies of high artistic quality as well as classic and foreign language films, and Saturday kid's matinees. The Garden live broadcasts performances from the Royal National Theatre and host talks and lectures from filmmakers including Terrence Malick and Peter Saraf. In March 2017 the Garden was named New Jersey's best movie theater by NJ.com. History =Early plans= The original impetus for the Garden Theatre came from a desire to improve the quality of performing spaces in the town. As early as 1909 a proposal was made to build a new home for the Princeton Triangle Club which performed in a structure on campus called the Casino considered to have poor acoustics. Alexander Hall was thought to have an awkward stage and to be too large for smaller gatherings. In 1914, Professor Donald Clive Stuart, an advocate of the Little Theatre Movement, proposed a new facility similar in size to the Princess Theatre in New York which would also be suitable for motion pictures drawn from the Rialto Theatre. =Construction= A more concrete plan took form in 1919 with the creation of the Princeton Theater Company. The company secured the site at the corner of Nassau Street and Vandeventer Avenue adjacent to and behind Bainbridge House, a historic structure that had served as the British headquarters during the Revolutionary War Battle of Princeton. The theater took its name from the rose garden that once stood beside the house. The original plans, while expecting that moving pictures would be the chief attraction, called for the construction of a sizable stage to allow for live theater. With the remaining live theater spaces in Trenton being converted to movie theaters it was expected that the Garden would provide a space for openings of shows by New York theater companies. As construction progressed it was decided to drop plans for a stage, while allowing for the possibility that one would be added in future, and restrict the Garden to cinema and the occasional lecture. As completed in 1920 the theater cost $60,000, including the organ, and had 1000 seats, 780 in the orchestra and 220 in the gallery which also had a number of boxes. With the garden strictly a movie theater, the desire for a new space for live performances in Princeton was ultimately fulfilled with the opening of McCarter Theatre in 1930. While it is sometimes claimed that the Garden was initially home to the Princeton Triangle Club that was only a proposed use during early planning and never came to pass. =Early decades= Thomas Meighan, star of Civilian Clothes, the first movie to play at the Garden The Garden opened on September 20, 1920 with a showing of Civilian Clothes, a silent comedy starring Thomas Meighan.

It was published by Candlewick Press in 2014 and is Primiano's first book. Its lexile score of 750L makes it appropriate for readers aged 12‚Äì18 years. Swim that Rock follows a teenager named Jake Cole after his father disappears while at sea. Jake must work as a fisherman to help his family repay a loan, or else face moving away from his New England home. The book was positively received by critics. Although reviewers note the predictable nature of the story and unoriginal language, the book has been lauded as an authentic portrait of life in coastal Rhode Island and an \\"entertaining coming-of-age story\\". Development The novel was inspired by the shared experiences of the two authors John Rocco and Jay Primiano, both of whom grew up in Rhode Island. Rocco (then 11) met Primiano (then 19) when the latter was repairing his boat at a mutual friend's home, and got a job working for Primiano as a fisherman. The two remained friends even after pursuing different careers. Primiano became a poet, living in Jamestown, Rhode Island; Rocco pursued a career as a children's book illustrator (and later, author) and moved to Los Angeles, California. Rocco approached Primiano about collaborating on a book sometime in 2004, although the two did not actually start writing Swim that Rock until 2008. Living far apart, the two first collaborated via email, with Primiano sending approximately 4000 words a day to Rocco for him to \\"cull through...[and] pick out the literary pearls\\". Eventually, Rocco and Primiano rented a house in Mystic, Connecticut to collaborate in-person and finished their first manuscript. They had difficulty securing a publisher until Rocco spoke to Candlewick Press president Karen Lotz, who finally took up the book. At the time, Rocco was working on several illustration projects with the publisher. The book was edited even further before publication in April 2014. The book's title is derived from a time when Rocco was working for Primiano on the latter's boat. Primiano, looking to challenge his companion, gave Rocco a large rock to swim to a neighboring boat some 200 yards away, ostensibly because the other boat's captain needed it to build a rock wall around his home. In the novel, Jake asks Gene Hassard (one of Jake's father's friends) if Gene will initiate him by making him \\"swim with a rock\\". The older man replies that Jake already has \\"[his] own rock to swim\\", which becomes a metaphor for the boy's difficulties throughout the book. Other events in the novel are also based on real-life experiences of either Rocco or Primiano, as are a number of characters. In particular, the book's Gene Hassard is based on Primiano's first boss, Gene Beebe. The fishermen and diner workers as well were based on real people from the pair's lives, albeit more generally. The authors stated that they were working on a sequel continuing Jake Cole's story as early as June 2014. Publication Swim that Rock was first published as a hardcover and ebook on April 8, 2014. A paperback edition is scheduled to be released April 11, 2017 with slightly different cover art. The authors embarked on a 12-day tour to promote the book shortly after its publication in 2014. They visited several towns in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, including Primiano's home of Jamestown. The tour included a launch party, book signings at regional booksellers, and visits to local middle schools where the authors (clad in fluorescent orange waders) explained the principles behind clamming. Rocco and Primiano also held a second tour in May 2015, visiting similar locations. The book's Lexile score is 750L, making it appropriate for children ages 12‚Äì18, or those at or above the seventh grade-level. Plot summary The book takes place in Warren, Rhode Island in 1982, and centers around a Jake Cole's quest to find his father, who went missing at sea. Like his father, 14-year-old Jake is a fisherman and quahogger in Narragansett Bay. The Cole family owns a small diner called the Riptide, but is in danger of losing the business because of a large debt owed to a local mafia loan shark. When his mother suggests that the family give up on the diner and move in with relatives in Arizona, Jake determines to repay the loan any way he can, thus giving him a chance to find his father (whom everyone else believes is dead). After a run of bad luck, Jake resorts to illegal night-fishing with a mysterious man called \\"Captain\\", but must contend with a game warden paid off by the mob. Although ultimately successful in saving the diner, Jake is deeply affected by the new experience of providing for his family. =Characters= *Jake is a very tall, lanky teenager. He catches quahogs in his free time and considers himself more fit at sea than on land. *Tommy is Jake's recycling- obsessed friend. *Jake's mother is the owner of a restaurant named the Riptide.

She sings well but feels embarrassed in front of audiences. *Trax is a friend and brother figure to Jake. His parents are Native American and Irish and he is described as \\"probably the only Indian with freckles.\\" Reception Although the novel was not a bestseller, it has been favorably received by critics. Library Media Connection claimed that it \\"will be sure to please middle school boys who are looking for an engaging read\\". John Freeman Gill's generally positive review for The New York Times especially praised illustrator John Rocco's pencil drawings and maps, comparing them to E. H. Shepard's work in the Winnie-the-Pooh books. One of the most effusive reviews came from author Rick Riordan, John Rocco's longtime collaborator. Riordan lauded the novel's well-executed descriptions of its setting, a sentiment shared by numerous other reviewers. Many reviewers note the predictability of the book's plot as its main downfall, and cite the vivid, unusual setting as the main reason for its success. For instance, the Kirkus Reviews review of Swim that Rock reads, \\"while the distinct, clearly realized setting details distinguish this title from the vast schools of novels for young teens swimming in the publishing sea, choppy pace and perfunctory dialogue drag it down to the ocean floor.\\" A review by Publishers Weekly similarly remarked on the book's familiar \\"framework\\", but praised its \\"overall sense of authenticity\\" for helping readers better relate to the young Jake Cole. This realism has also been positively remarked on by other critics. A review by Booklist posited that the novel's autobiographical elements help reinforce this authenticity. Gill's review describes the dichotomy between Rocco and Primiano's descriptions of life on land and life at sea, noting the improved narrative style in the latter. A few reviews have criticized other aspects of the novel as well. Its sometimes \\"harried\\" pace and generally \\"light character development\\", for example, was mentioned by reviews by the School Library Journal, among others. This lack of character development, especially regarding Jake's father, was also mentioned by Gill's New York Times review.

Little grew up in Muskegon, Michigan, where her sisters played on a softball team. She wanted to play along with her sisters, but the team's coach said her that she was too young. As luck would have it, one day the team was short of players and she received a chance to play at the age of 11. She then formed part of the regular lineup thereafter. In 1947, Little was playing in a Muskegon factory league when an AAGPBL scout signed her to a contract, as she went to Opa-locka, Florida for spring training. She was assigned to her home team, Muskegon Lassies, but she was never given enough playing time because already the Lassies had the slick- fielding Sara Reeser at first base. She then was reassigned to the Fort Wayne Daisies the next season and the same thing happened, as they used outstanding first sacker Betty Foss.

Niobium diselenide is a lubricant, and a superconductor at temperatures below 7.2 K that exhibit a charge density wave (CDW). NbSe2 crystallizes in several related forms, and can be mechanically exfoliated into monatomic layers, similar to other transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers. Monolayer NbSe2 exhibits very different properties from the bulk material, such as of Ising superconductivity, quantum metallic state, and strong enhancement of the CDW. Synthesis Number of NbSe2 layers as a function of Se powder temperature during CVD. Niobium diselenide crystals and thin films can be grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Nb oxide, selenium and NaCl powders are heated to different temperatures in the range 300‚Äì800 ¬∞C at ambient pressure in a furnace that allows maintaining a temperature gradient along its axis. Powders are placed in different locations in the furnace, and a mixture of argon and hydrogen is used as the carrier gas. The NbSe2 thickness can be accurately controlled by varying the temperature of Se powder. NbSe2 monolayers can also be exfoliated from the bulk or deposited by molecular beam epitaxy. Structure Niobium diselenide exists in several forms, including 1H, 2H, 4H and 3R, where H stands for hexagonal and R for rhombohedral, and the number 1, 2, etc., refers to the number of Se-Nb-Se layers in a unit cell. The Se-Nb-Se layers are bonded together with relatively weak van der Waals forces, and can be exfoliated into 1H monolayers. They can be offset in a variety of ways to make different crystal structures, the most stable being 2H. Properties =Superconductor= NbSe2 is a superconductor with a critical temperature TC = 7.2 K. The critical temperature drops when the NbSe2 layers are intercalated by other atoms, or when the sample thickness decreases, with TC being ~1 K in a monolayer. Recent studies show infrared photodetection in NbSe2 devices. =Charge density wave= Along with the CDW the lattice develops a periodic lattice distortion around 26 K. This period is three times that of the crystal lattice, so that there is a 3 by 3 superlattice. =Friction= NbSe2 sheets develop higher friction when very thin. Intercalation Because the layers in NbSe2 are only weakly bonded together, different substances can penetrate between the layers to form well defined intercalation compounds. Compounds with helium, rubidium, transition metals, and post-transition metals have been made. Extra niobium atoms, up to one third extra can be added between the layers. Extra metal atoms from first transition metal series can intercalate up to 1:3 ratio. they go in between the layers. Intercalating two atoms of helium per formula increases the layer separation to 2.9 and the Se-Se distance to 3.52. =Rubidium= When rubidium is intercalated, the NbSe2 layers separate to accommodate it. Each individual layer is also compressed slightly. The Nb-Se distance stays the same, but the Nb-Nb distance in the layer increases. The Se-Se distance on top and bottom of the layer decreases, and the Nb-Se-Nb angle increases. Extra electron density transfers from the Rb atoms to the niobium layer. =Vanadium= Vanadium can enter the 2H NbSe2 structure to the limit of 1% by substituting for Nb.

He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893. After a long and successful colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.  Early life  Born in Savigliano on 26 April 1846, Arimondi attended the Royal Military Academy in Modena. After graduating in 1865, he was appointed sub-lieutenant in the Bersaglieri, and fought in the 1866 Italo-Austrian War. Upon reaching the rank of captain he served as a military observer during the Franco-Prussian War. He then attended the School of War and in 1874 was promoted major in the Army Staff.  Colonial service in Eritrea  In 1887, Arimondi was assigned as a staff officer to the expeditionary corps of General Alessandro Asinari di San Marzano and left for Eritrea, where he stayed until 1890. In 1892, he was promoted to colonel and sent again in Eritrea with full command of all native troops in the colony. In this position, he won a series of minor clashes and defeated the Dervishes under Emir Ahmed Al√¨ at the Second Battle of Agordat in December 1893. In this battle, he remarkably decided to deploy his men in an extended battle line, with reserves echeloned at the rear. This caught by surprise the Mahdists, who were expecting close square formations as the ones adopted by British infantry in previous engagements. For this victory he received a promotion to major general.Royal Decree, 1 February 1894 In 1894 he commanded the 2nd Operational Corps under General Oreste Baratieri, fighting the Battle of Kassala and the Battle of Coatit. Arimondi urged rapid and daring offensive manoeuvres, and quarreled with Baratieri's more cautious plans. When the Governor refused to support his projects of a preventive attack against Menelik II in Tigray, he twice requested permission to return home. The Minister of War refused, not willing to replace one of the most experienced colonial officers. This situation eventually led to the massacre of Major Pietro Toselli's column. Isolated in an outpost at Amba Alagi, Toselli never received the order to retreat and was trapped by the army of Menelik. Arimondi, who had previously advanced to Ader√†, away, was stopped by a telegram from Baratieri and forced to retreat. This left Toselli and Galliano to fend for themselves at the battle of Amba Alagi and the siege of Mek'ele.  Battle of Adwa and death  On 12 February, pressed by the Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Baratieri had his forces dug in at strong positions at Sauria, from Menelik's camp. By 27 February, the army had only a few days supply left and the intelligence wrongly reported that the Ethiopians were scattered across the hills of Adwa, foraging. Unable or unwilling to decide between a temporary withdrawal or a small advance, the Governor asked for the advice of his brigade commanders: Arimondi, Matteo Albertone, Vittorio Dabormida and the newly appointed Giuseppe Ellena. Arimondi estimated Menelik's forces at 50,000‚Äì60,000 warriors and, supported by his colleagues, urged for an aggressive approach. On 28 February, Baratieri resolved to advance towards the Ethiopian camp at Adwa. His orders on 29 February called for an offensive thrust to occupy a solid position on the hill east of Adwa. From there on he could react according to the moves of the Abyssinians; defend if attacked, keep the position if unmolested or attack the rearguard of the Negus' army if it retreated from Adwa. The field force was ordered to move during the night; Albertone and the Native Brigade on the left flank, was to occupy the Kidane Meret peak, Dabormida on the right flank, the mountain of the Rebbi Arienni and Arimondi, with the center, again the Rebbi Arienni, in a less prominent position. The reserve brigade of General Ellena was stationed behind Arimondi. = Night march = During the night of 29 February/1 March, Arimondi's Infantry Brigade marched without his native battalion, which could not be assembled in time from the several outposts it was guarding, leaving the center weaker than intended. At 21:30 the brigades of Albertone, Arimondi and Dabormida were on their way, each following different roads; Ellena's brigade was to follow Arimondi three hours later, with Baratieri and his staff. At midnight it was found that the track followed by Albertone and Arimondi were converging. Arimondi stopped and let Albertone pass ahead. The Native Brigade marched faster than the two european formations and by 3:30 a.m. Albertone reached his position. His guides, though, informed him that the brigade was on Erar√† Hill and not on the Kidane Meret, as intended. Albertone thus decided to resume the march until he reached what his guides reported as the 'real' Kidane Meret, away. This decision opened a wide gap in the Italian lines, and isolated Albertone's force from Arimondi and Dabormida. The two Italian brigades had deployed on the Rebbi Arienni by 5:30 a.m., while on the Kidane Meret Albertone was launching his attack on the Ethiopian camp. The Native Brigade at first met little resistance, but was soon repulsed by the larger number of enemy troops. = Dabormida's advance = At 6:30 a.m., Baratieri reached the Rebbi Arienni and heard the sounds of the fight on the left. He ordered Dabormida to relieve the pressure on Albertone, then brought up the reserve to occupy the position vacated by Dabormida. At 8:15 a.m. a message from Albertone (sent at 7:00 a.m.) reached Baratieri: the general was under heavy attack and in dire need of reinforcements. Baratieri ordered Arimondi to advance and form his line between Mount Rajo and Bellah, while Ellena occupied the Rebbi Arienni. Due to the broken ground which slowed his progress, Arimondi completed his movement at 9:00 a.m. Almost immediately he came upon a trickle of wounded soldiers from Albertone's brigade, which had been forced to retreat on the nearby mount Semaiata. Within half an hour the trickle became a stream and Baratieri sent Albertone orders to retire and reform under Arimondi's cover. It was too late: the Colonial Brigade, out of ammunition, disintegrated shortly afterwards. At 10:00 a.m. the Ethiopian forces, mixed with the disbanded Italians, launched their first assault on Arimondi's position. = Arimondi's stand and death = After the initial Ethiopian attacks were repulsed, Menelik sent his guard to outflank the left side of Arimondi's forces. The colonial battalion of Galliano, the only unit Ellena could detach to guard Arimondi's right flank, was overwhelmed. With his brigade hard pressed on the front and outflanked on both sides, General Arimondi was mortally wounded after two hours of fighting. With his death and the defeat of his brigade, the battle was lost.
