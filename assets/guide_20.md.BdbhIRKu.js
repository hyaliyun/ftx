These bacteria can be further categorized as obligate alkaliphiles (those that require high pH to survive), facultative alkaliphiles (those able to survive in high pH, but also grow under normal conditions) and haloalkaliphiles (those that require high salt content to survive).HORIKOSHI, KOKI. \\"Alkaliphiles: Some Applications of Their Products for Biotechnology.\\" MICROBIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REVIEWS 63.4 (1999): 735-50. Print. A typical bacillus culture. Many alkaliphiles possess a bacillus morphology. Background information Microbial growth in alkaline conditions presents several complications to normal biochemical activity and reproduction, as high pH is detrimental to normal cellular processes. For example, alkalinity can lead to denaturation of DNA, instability of the plasma membrane and inactivation of cytosolic enzymes, as well as other unfavorable physiological changes.Higashibata, Akira, Taketomo Fujiwara, and Yoshihiro Fukumori. \\"Studies on the Respiratory System in Alkaliphilic Bacillus; a Proposed New Respiratory System.\\" Extremophiles 2 (1998): 83‚Äì92. Print. Thus, to adequately circumvent these obstacles, alkaliphiles must either possess specific cellular machinery that works best in the alkaline range, or they must have methods of acidifying the cytosol in relation to the extracellular environment. To determine which of the above possibilities an alkaliphile uses, experimentation has demonstrated that alkaliphilic enzymes possess relatively normal pH optimums. The determination that these enzymes function most efficiently near physiologically neutral pH ranges (about 7.5‚Äì8.5) was one of the primary steps in elucidating how alkaliphiles survive intensely basic environments. Since the cytosolic pH must remain nearly neutral, alkaliphiles must have one or more mechanisms of acidifying the cytosol when in the presence of a highly alkaline environment. Mechanisms of cytosolic acidification Alkaliphiles maintain cytosolic acidification through both passive and active means. In passive acidification, it has been proposed that cell walls contain acidic polymers composed of residues such as galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and phosphoric acid. Together, these residues form an acidic matrix that helps protect the plasma membrane from alkaline conditions by preventing the entry of hydroxide ions, and allowing for the uptake of sodium and hydronium ions. In addition, the peptidoglycan in alkaliphilic B. subtilis has been observed to contain higher levels of hexosamines and amino acids as compared to its neutrophilic counterpart. When alkaliphiles lose these acidic residues in the form of induced mutations, it has been shown that their ability to grow in alkaline conditions is severely hindered. However, it is generally agreed upon that passive methods of cytosolic acidification are not sufficient to maintain an internal pH 2-2.3 levels below that of external pH; there must also be active forms of acidification. The most characterized method of active acidification is in the form of Na+/H+ antiporters. In this model, H+ ions are first extruded through the electron transport chain in respiring cells and to some extent through an ATPase in fermentative cells. This proton extrusion establishes a proton gradient that drives electrogenic antiporters‚Äîwhich drive intracellular Na+ out of the cell in exchange for a greater number of H+ ions, leading to the net accumulation of internal protons. This proton accumulation leads to a lowering of cytosolic pH. The extruded Na+ can be used for solute symport, which are necessary for cellular processes. It has been noted that Na+/H+ antiport is required for alkaliphilic growth, whereas either K+/H+ antiporters or Na+/H+ antiporters can be utilized by neutrophilic bacteria. If Na+/H+ antiporters are disabled through mutation or another means, the bacteria are rendered neutrophilic.Krulwich, Terry A., Mashahiro Ito, Ray Gilmour, and Arthur A. Guffanti. \\"Mechanisms of Cytoplasmic PH Regulation in Alkaliphilic Strains of Bacillus.\\" Extremophiles 1 (1997): 163-69. Print. The sodium required for this antiport system is the reason some alkaliphiles can only grow in saline environments. Differences in alkaliphilic ATP production In addition to the method of proton extrusion discussed above, it is believed that the general method of cellular respiration is different in obligate alkaliphiles as compared to neutrophiles. Generally, ATP production operates by establishing a proton gradient (greater H+ concentration outside the membrane) and a transmembrane electrical potential (with a positive charge outside the membrane). However, since alkaliphiles have a reversed pH gradient, it would seem that ATP production‚Äîwhich is based on a strong proton motive force‚Äîwould be severely reduced. However, the opposite is true. It has been proposed that while the pH gradient has been reversed, the transmembrane electrical potential is greatly increased. This increase in charge causes the production of greater amounts of ATP by each translocated proton when driven through an ATPase.Hirabayashi, Toshikazu, Toshitaka Goto, Hajime Morimoto, Kazuaki Yoshimune, Hidetoshi Matsuyama, and Isao Yumoto. \\"Relationship between Rates of Respiratory Proton Extrusion and ATP Synthesis in Obligately Alkaliphilic Bacillus Clarkii DSM 8720T.\\" J Bioenerg Biomembr 44 (2012): 265-72. Print. Research in this area is ongoing. Applications and future research Alkaliphiles promise several interesting uses for biotechnology and future research. Alkaliphilic methods of regulating pH and producing ATP are of interest in the scientific community. However, perhaps the greatest area of interest from alkaliphiles lies in their enzymes: alkaline proteases; starch- degrading enzymes; cellulases; lipases; xylanases; pectinases; chitinases and their metabolites, including: 2-phenylamine; carotenoids; siderophores; cholic acid derivatives and organic acids. It is hoped that further research into alkaliphilic enzymes will allow scientists to harvest alkaliphiles' enzymes for use in basic conditions. Research aimed at discovering alkaliphile- produced antibiotics showed some success, yet has been held at bay by the fact that some products produced at high pH are unstable and unusable at a physiological pH range. Examples Examples of alkaliphiles include Halorhodospira halochloris, Natronomonas pharaonis, and Thiohalospira alkaliphila.

It was an ally of the United States, but there were several foreign policy differences between the two countries over the course of the Cold War. Canada was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949, the North American Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in 1958 and played a leading role in United Nations peacekeeping operations ‚Äì from the Korean War to the creation of a permanent UN peacekeeping force during the Suez Crisis in 1956. Subsequent peacekeeping interventions occurred in the Congo (1960), Cyprus (1964), the Sinai (1973), Vietnam (with the International Control Commission), Golan Heights, Lebanon (1978), and Namibia (1989‚Äì1990). Canada did not follow the American lead in all Cold War actions, sometimes leading to tensions. Canada refused to join the Vietnam War and in 1984 the last nuclear weapons based in Canada were removed. Relations were maintained with Cuba and the Canadian government recognized the People's Republic of China before the United States. The Canadian military maintained a standing presence in Western Europe as part of its NATO deployment at several bases in Germany ‚Äì including long tenures at CFB Baden-Soellingen and CFB Lahr, in the Black Forest region of West Germany. Also Canadian military facilities were maintained in Bermuda, France and the United Kingdom. From the early 1960s until the 1980s, Canada maintained weapon platforms armed with nuclear weapons ‚Äì including nuclear-tipped air-to-air rockets, surface-to-air missiles, and high-yield gravity bombs principally deployed in the Western European theatre of operations as well as in Canada. Background The Royal Canadian Air Force, February 1945. By the end of World War II, Canada fielded a significantly large air force, and navy. Canada emerged from the Second World War as a world power, radically transforming a principally agricultural and rural dominion of a dying empire into a truly sovereign nation, with a market economy focused on a combination of resource extraction and refinement, heavy manufacturing, and high-technology research and development. As a consequence of supplying so much of the war effort for six long years, Canada's military grew to an exceptional size: over a million service personnel, the world's fifth largest surface fleet and fourth largest air force. Despite a draw-down at the end of the war, the Canadian military nonetheless executed Operation Muskox, a massive deployment across the Canadian Arctic designed in part to train for a ground and air war in the region. Canadians also assisted in humanitarian efforts, and sending observers for the United Nations to India and Palestine in 1947 and 1948. There was never any doubt early on as to which side Canada was on in the Cold War due to its location and historical alliances. On the domestic front, the Canadian state at all levels fought vehemently against what it characterized as communist subversion. Canadian and business leaders opposed the advance of the labour movement on the grounds that it was a Bolshevik conspiracy during the interwar period. The peak moments of this effort were the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 and the anticommunist campaigns of the depression, including the stopping of the On-to-Ottawa Trek. Early Cold War (1946‚Äì1960) In February 1946, the Canadian government disclosed to the public the defection of a Soviet cipher clerk, Igor Gouzenko, in Ottawa; who also disclosed the existence of a Soviet spy ring in the country. The event has been used by historians to mark the beginning of the Cold War era in Canada, with the Gouzenko affair triggering another red scare in Canada. Canada was a founding member of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), of which Prime Minister St. Laurent was a chief architect. Canada was one of its most ardent supporters and pushed (largely unsuccessfully) to have it become an economic and cultural organization in addition to a military alliance. Dew Line, the Mid-Canada Line, and the Pinetree Line, a series of early warning radar systems developed in the 1950s. To defend North America against a possible enemy attack, Canada and the United States began to work very closely together in the 1950s. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) created a joint air-defense system. In northern Canada, the Distant Early Warning Line (Dew Line) was established to give warning of Soviet bombers heading over the north pole. Similar early warning radar systems were also developed in the middle of Canada, known as the Mid-Canada Line; and across the 50th parallel north, known as the Pinetree Line. =Domestic anti-Communism= Canada addressed the threat posed by Communist sympathizers in a manner more moderate than in the United States. The United States wished the Canadian government would go further, asking for a purging of trade unions, but the Canadian government left the purge of trade unions to the AFL-CIO. The American officials were especially concerned about the sailors on Great Lakes freight vessels, and, in 1951, Canada added them to those already screened by its secret anti-communist screening program. The Communist Party of Canada had not been outlawed since Section 98 was repealed by Prime Minister Mackenzie King in 1935. Despite its comparatively moderate stance towards Communism, the Canadian state continued intensive surveillance of Communists and sharing of intelligence with the United States. PROFUNC was a Government of Canada top secret plan to identify and detain Communist sympathizers during the height of the Cold War.CBC: Secret Cold War plan included mass detentions Tensions between Canada and the United States heightened during this time as on April 4, 1957, Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, E. Herbert Norman, leaped to his death from a Cairo building after the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security released a textual record of a previous hearing to the media. Despite having been cleared several years earlier, first by the RCMP in 1950, then again by the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson, the United States media portrayed Norman as a spy and traitor. The only evidence the United States had was that as a student at Cambridge and Harvard he was a part of a Marxist communist study group. This made Pearson, who was still External Affairs Minister, backed by outrage across the country, send a note to the US Government, threatening to offer no more security information on Canadian citizens until it was guaranteed that this information would not slip beyond the executive branch of the government. =Peacekeeping= Two Canadian officers during the Korean War. During the war, Canadian Forces were dispatched as a part of the United Nations forces. It was during the Cold War period that Canada began to assert the international clout that went along with the reputation it had built on the international stage in World War I and World War II. In the Korean War, the moderately sized contingent of volunteer soldiers from Canada made noteworthy contributions to the United Nations forces and served with distinction. Of particular note is the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry's contribution to the Battle of Kapyong. Canada's major Cold War contribution to international politics was made in the innovation and implementation of 'Peacekeeping'. Although a United Nations military force had been proposed and advocated for the preservation of peace vis a vis the U.N.'s mandate by Canada's representatives Prime Minister Mackenzie King and his Secretary of State for External Affairs Louis St. Laurent at the United Nations Conference on International Organization in San Francisco in June 1945, it was not adopted at that time. Lester B. Pearson, Secretary for External Affairs, 1957. The previous year, Pearson proposed the creation of a United Nations Emergency Force to diffuse the Suez Crisis. During the Suez Crisis of 1956, the idea promoted by Canada in 1945 of a United Nations military force returned to the fore. The conflict involving Britain, France, Israel and Egypt quickly developed into a potential flashpoint between the emerging 'superpowers' of the United States and the Soviet Union as the Soviets made intimations that they would militarily support Egypt's cause. The Soviets went as far as to say they would be willing to use \\"all types of modern weapons of destruction\\" on London and Paris ‚Äì an overt threat of nuclear attack. Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson re- introduced then Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent's UN military force concept in the form of an 'Emergency Force' that would intercede and divide the combatants, and form a buffer zone or 'human shield' between the opposing forces. Pearson's United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) ‚Äì the first peacekeeping force, was deployed to separate the combatants and a cease-fire and resolution was drawn up to end the hostilities. Canada‚ÄìU.S. tensions (1961‚Äì1980) Great debate broke out while John Diefenbaker was Prime Minister as to whether Canada should accept U.S. nuclear weapons on its territory. Diefenbaker had already agreed to buy the BOMARC missile system from the Americans, which would be not as effective without nuclear warheads, but balked at permitting the weapons into Canada. A RCAF CIM-10 Bomarc missile in North Bay, Ontario. Viewed as an alternative to the defunct Avro Arrow program, its adoption garnered controversy given its nuclear payload. Canada also maintained diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba following the Cuban Revolution. Prior to the Cuban Missile Crisis, the insistence on a much more placated policy towards the Cuban government had been a source of contention between the United States and Canada. Prime Minister Diefenbaker firmly stood by his policy decision, insisting that this was the result of the rights of states to establish their own forms of government, rejection of current US interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine as well as Canada's right to establish its own foreign policy. Concern in the Canadian government was focused primarily on nuclear weapons, many politicians in the opposition and in power believed that as long as the US president retained absolute control of the nuclear weapons, Canadian forces could be ordered to undertake nuclear missions for the US without Canadian consent. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, Canada was expected to fall in line with American foreign policy, in that Canada's military forces were expected to go on immediate war alert status. Diefenbaker however, refused to do so emphasizing the need for United Nations intervention. It would only be after a tense phone call between President John F. Kennedy and Diefenbaker that Canada's armed forces would begin preparations for \\"immediate enemy attack\\". Although the crisis would eventually be solved by diplomatic talks between Nikita Khrushchev and Kennedy, nothing would loom larger over the Canadian state in the months following the crisis than the governing party's disarray on the question of nuclear arms. In the 1963 Canadian election, Diefenbaker was replaced by the famed diplomat Lester B. Pearson, who accepted the warheads. Further tensions developed when Pearson criticized the American role in the Vietnam War in a speech he gave at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. See also Canada and the Vietnam War. Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and U.S. President Richard Nixon, 1972. Tensions between Canada and the U.S. increased shortly after the implementation of the Nixon Shock in 1971. Shortly after the implementation of economic policies, and tariffs, known as the Nixon shock, the Canadian government began to articulate a Third Option policy; with plans to diversify Canadian trade, and downgrade the importance of its relationship with the United States. In a 1972 speech in Ottawa, Nixon declared the \\"special relationship\\" between Canada and the United States dead.Bruce Muirhead, \\"From Special Relationship to Third Option: Canada, the U.S., and the Nixon Shock,\\" American Review of Canadian Studies, Vol. 34, 2004 online edition During this period, Canada played a middle power role in international affairs, and pursued diplomatic relations with Communist countries that the US had severed ties with, such as Cuba and China after their respective revolutions. Canada argued that rather than being soft on Communism, it was pursuing a strategy of \\"constructive engagement\\" whereby it sought to influence Communism through the course of its international relationships. Canada also refused to join the Organization of American States, disliking the support and tolerance of the Cold War OAS for dictators. Under Pearson's successor Pierre Trudeau, US- Canadian policies grew further apart. Trudeau removed nuclear weapons from Canadian soil, formally recognized the People's Republic of China, established a personal friendship with Castro, and decreased the number of Canadian troops stationed at NATO bases in Europe. Final years of the Cold War (1980‚Äì1991) Brian Mulroney and Ronald Reagan had a close relationship, but the 1980s also saw widespread protests against American testing of cruise missiles in Canada's north. In addition, Canada may have played a small role in helping to bring about glasnost and perestroika. In the mid-1970s, Alexander Yakovlev was appointed as ambassador to Canada, remaining at that post for a decade. During this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends. In the early 1980s, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two began, tentatively at first, to discuss the need for liberalisation in the Soviet Union. Yakovlev then returned to Moscow, and would eventually be called the \\"godfather of glasnost\\", the intellectual force behind Gorbachev's reform program. Theseus to lay an acoustic array throughout the Arctic seaboard, in an effort to detect Soviet submarines. In 1987, Canada released a long-awaited White Paper on Defence; signalling its intent to re-assert sovereignty over its Arctic Waters. Concerned that Soviet submarines were operating in Canada's Arctic Archipelago, several programs were proposed to close the gap between Canada's current capabilities and its commitments to NATO. Project Spinnaker was born, a joint Canada‚ÄìUS endeavour whose secret purpose was to provide the capability to monitor submarine traffic in Canadian Arctic waters by deploying acoustic listening posts on the seafloor. This project required the development of a large autonomous underwater vehicle ‚Äì named Theseus ‚Äì whose sole purpose was to lay communications trunk cables on the seafloor in waters with a permanent ice cover. In the spring of 1996, Theseus was transported to CFS Alert (on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island) then was deployed from an ice camp where it laid 180 km of fibre optic cable on the seafloor in ice-covered waters, successfully delivering it to an acoustic array deployed on the edge of the Continental Shelf. Post-Cold War When the Cold War ended, Canadian Forces were withdrawn from their NATO commitments in Germany, military spending was cut, and air raid sirens were removed across the country. The Diefenbunkers, Canada's military-operated fallout shelters designed to ensure continuity of government, were decommissioned. In 1994, the last active United States military base in Canada, Naval Station Argentia Newfoundland, was decommissioned and the facility was turned over to the Government of Canada. The base was a storage facility for the Mk 101 Lulu and B57 nuclear bombs and a key node in the US Navy's SOSUS network to detect Soviet nuclear submarines. Canada continues to participate in Cold War institutions such as NORAD and NATO, but they have been given new missions and priorities. CF-18 Hornet at CFB Baden‚ÄìSoellingen, shortly before the airbase's closure in 1993. The end of the Cold War saw the withdrawal of Canadian military formations in Europe. The Cold War in Canada came to an end during the period 1990‚Äì1995 as the traditional mission to contain Soviet expansion faded into the new realities of warfare. The Cold War required permanent foreign deployments to Western Europe, something which was no longer necessary, and as such bases closed down. Less equipment was needed, and so much was sold off, soon to be replaced by newer equipment designed for future conflicts. At home, bases were closed and operations consolidated and streamlined for maximum efficiency, as by the early 1990s many Canadians were openly questioning the necessity of large defence budgets. In 1990, Canadian troops were deployed to assist provincial police in Qu√©bec in an effort to defuse tensions between Mohawk Warriors and the Suret√© du Qu√©bec and local residents. In 1991 Canadian Forces personnel deployed in support of the American liberation of Kuwait. By 1992, Canadian peacekeepers were deployed to Cambodia, Croatia and Somalia. In 1993 Balkan involvement expanded into Bosnia and Canadian troops participated in some of the fiercest combat since the Korean War during Operation Medak Pocket. By the end of the 1990s, Canada would have a completely different military, one more inclined towards the rigours of peacekeeping and peace-making operations under multi-national coalitions. The country would be further involved in the Yugoslav Wars throughout the rest of the decade, would become involved in Haiti, and would further see action again in Zaire and East Timor. The Navy, by decade's end (and prior to the modern post-9/11 era), was comparatively brand new, the Air Force well-balanced and modern as well. The Army began to acquire new equipment, such as the LAV-III, Bison APC and the Coyote Reconnaissance Vehicle as it transitioned to fighting irregular warfare instead of the large tank battles once feared would rage across Western Europe. It is with Canada's late-Cold War and early-Peacekeeping Era military that Canada would embark on its deployment to Afghanistan, currently Canada's longest-running war.

It is a major landmark of the southern portion of Nicollet Mall and home to many events throughout the year, in addition to being the Orchestra's home. The auditorium seats 2,089, of which about 1,200 are accommodated on the main floor. The remaining seats are placed in three balconies above and along the sides of the main floor. The auditorium is actually a second building separated for acoustical reasons by a one-inch gap from the \\"shell\\" which contains the lobby and various administrative offices. The stage contains an unusual feature: a large cube motif in the rear stage wall which continues along the ceiling towards the rear of the auditorium. The cubes were added for acoustic reasons, successfully, and turned out to be visually striking as well. History The Hall was built by Hammel, Green and Abrahamson in 1974 (as was the adjacent Peavey Plaza) and opened for the 1974 concert season. Originally noted for its modernist design, chosen to represent an orchestra for everyone, not what was then perceived to be the formal \\"elitist\\" designs of the past. The exterior of the building was recognizable by its large, blue ventilation ducts. Their unusual size was chosen to reduce air velocity and hence noise. The lobby area's original \\"power plant\\" design was meant to remove tones of class and privilege from the symphony-going experience; it was upgraded in late 1997 and included several bars. Expansive windows overlooked the street. Built in 1975, Peavey Plaza was designed by landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg who also designed the Loring Greenway. The plaza which holds an amphitheater and water fountain is considered one of the endangered historic properties in Minnesota. Renovation In April 2007, it was announced that the hall would be undergoing a multimillion-dollar renovation.\\"What Sounds Great at Orchestra Hall? A $90m Facelift\\" St. Paul Pioneer Press, 30 April 2007. This renovation had a heavy emphasis on the lobby and patron areas. On April 9, 2010, plans were revealed for a $40 million renovation and expansion. The lobby and public areas were doubled in size and the former utilitarian exterior was replaced with stone and glass. A grand new entrance was also added. KPMB of Toronto were the architects and MBJ of Minneapolis were the structural engineers. Construction began in June 2012.

Despite the word \\"range\\", the iron ranges are not mountain chains, but outcrops of Precambrian sedimentary formations containing high percentages of iron. These cherty iron ore deposits are Precambrian in age for the Vermilion Range, while middle Precambrian in age for the Mesabi and Cuyuna ranges, all in Minnesota. The Gogebic Range in Wisconsin and the Marquette Iron Range and Menominee Range in Michigan have similar characteristics and are of similar age. Natural ores and concentrates were produced from 1848 until the mid 1950s, when taconites and jaspers were concentrated and pelletized, and started to become the major source of iron production. The far eastern area, containing the Duluth Complex along the shore of Lake Superior, and the far northern area, along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, of the region are not associated with iron ore mining. Due to its shape, the area is collectively referred to as the Arrowhead region of Minnesota. It consists of seven counties: Aitkin, Carlton, Cook, Itasca, Koochiching, Lake, and Saint Louis. The Iron Range and its economy Map of Minnesota with the Iron Range counties highlighted. Iron ore Croft Mine Historic Park Soudan Underground Mine State Park From a geological perspective, the Iron Range in Minnesota includes these four major iron deposits:2 Billion Years Ago: Iron Range Beginnings, Minnesota Historical Society * Mesabi Range, the largest iron range, largely within Itasca and Saint Louis counties; * Vermilion Range, northeast of the Mesabi, in Saint Louis and Lake counties; * Gunflint Range is in the extreme northern portion of Cook County and extends into Canada; and * Cuyuna Range, southwest of the Mesabi, largely within Crow Wing County. Within Minnesota, \\"The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation is a State Department, established by the legislature of 1941 to render public service through research and the actual development of all the state's resources both natural and human.\\" The Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB), known simply as \\"the I-triple-R-B\\" or Iron Range Resources,Iron Range Resources is an economic development agency funded partly by taxes levied by the state on taconite-producing companies and charged with creating jobs. History Geologically, the iron ranges in Minnesota belong to the Animikie Group. The geologic history of the formations containing iron are typical of banded iron formations worldwide. Prior to the 19th century, Native American groups mined native copper on the Keweenaw Peninsula. William Austin Burt discovered iron ore in the Marquette Range near Negaunee, Michigan in 1844. Iron ore was quickly discovered on the Menominee Range in 1867, on the Gogebic Range in 1884, on the Vermilion Range in 1885, the Mesabi Range in 1890, and the Cuyuna Range in 1903. Underground mines were developed to remove the valuable ore of most ranges. However, iron mining operations on the Mesabi and Cuyuna Ranges evolved into enormous open pit mines, where steam shovels and other industrial machines could remove massive amounts of ore. \\"Large-scale commercial production of magnetite taconite ore on the Mesabi Range started in 1956 at the Peter Mitchell Mine near Babbitt, Minnesota.\\" Cities The Iron Range contains several smaller cities. Some of the more significant communities in the region include: * Aitkin (pop. 2,165) is located on the eastern edge of the Cuyuna Range. Aitkin was the birthplace of stage and film actor Warren William. * Aurora (pop. 1,853) is located on the Eastern Mesabi Range. The former St. James, Meadow, Miller and Stephens mines lie within the city limits. * Babbitt (pop. 1,475) * Biwabik (pop. 969) * Bovey (pop. 804) is located along U.S. Highway 169 between Coleraine and Taconite. Bovey was the birthplace of NHL goaltender Adam Hauser, San Francisco politician Richard Hongisto, and Eric Enstrom ‚Äì photographer of the famous 1918 photograph \\"Grace.\\" * Buhl (pop. 1,000) is located along U.S. Highway 169 between Chisholm and Virginia. Buhl is known for its fine water and claims \\"The Finest Water in America\\" on its water tower. * Chisholm (pop. 4,976) is the geographic center of the Mesabi Range, home of the Chisholm Bluestreaks. It is the home of Minnesota Discovery Center, the Minnesota Museum of Mining, and the Iron Range Research Center.

Iron pellets are shipped \\"downward\\" through the Soo Locks to steel towns such as Cleveland, Erie, Toledo et al. The Port of Duluth allows for the iron ore to be easily shipped through the Great Lakes. * Deerwood (pop. 529) Mining engineer Cuyler Adams discovered the Cuyuna Range near Deerwood in 1895. * Ely (pop. 3,460), in the Vermillion Range, is perhaps best known as the most popular entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. * Eveleth (pop. 3,718) is where U.S. Senator Paul Wellstone and seven others died in a plane crash in 2002 two miles away from the municipal airport. It also the site of the conflict that resulted in the landmark sexual harassment class action case Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co. and the film North Country. It is also home of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. * Grand Rapids (pop. 10,869) is named for the local rapids in the Mississippi River, which was the uppermost limit of practical steamboat travel during the late 19th century. Today, those rapids are hidden underneath the dam of the Blandin Paper Mill, which has its papermaking facilities in downtown Grand Rapids. The city is considered to lie on the westernmost edge of the Mesabi Range. The current economy has a large tourist footing, with many local resorts, golf courses, and regional hunting and fishing. Grand Rapids is the birthplace of entertainer Judy Garland. * Gilbert (pop. 1,799) is home of one of Minnesota's most well known off-highway vehicle parks. It is also the location of Lake Ore-be-gone, which is actually an artificial lake created by flooding three open-pit iron ore mines. *Grand Marais (pop. 1,351) The area was a bustling fur trading station since the 1700s, and the French Voyageurs termed the settled village ‚ÄòGrand Marais‚Äô which is French for \\"Great Marsh\\", referring to a marsh that, in early fur- trading times, was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and situated at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. The town comprises much of the Gunflint Trail, which extends to the former Paulson Mine site. * Hibbing (pop. 16,361) is the largest city by area in the state of Minnesota and is the former boyhood home of Bob Dylan, basketball great Kevin McHale and the location of the Hull‚ÄìRust‚ÄìMahoning Open Pit Iron Mine, one of the largest open pit iron mines in the world. Hibbing is also the birthplace of Roger Maris. * Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota (pop. 1,888) is the located on Eastern Mesabi Range. Erie Mining Company previously mined ore and there is currently ongoing testing to mine new minerals. * Keewatin, Minnesota (pop. 1,068) is located between Nashwauk and Hibbing. It is home to U.S. Steel's KeeTac taconite mining and processing plant. It is the hometown of New England Patriots Hall of Famer Gino Cappelletti and Big Ten College Baseball's record holder for most career wins and current Minnesota Gophers baseball coach, John Anderson. * Kinney (pop. 169) is an old mining boomtown on the Iron Range, located between Buhl and Mountain Iron. * Mountain Iron (pop. 2,869) is home to Minntac, the world's largest taconite processing plant. * Nashwauk (pop. 983) is a small town between Grand Rapids and Hibbing, 4 miles from Keewatin. There are a few pit lakes in the area that now hold bass, lake trout, and northern pike. Currently (2010), Essar Minnesota Steel LLC is constructing a new direct-reduction steel producing facility north of town. It is a first for the Iron Range, as it will have blast furnaces on-site to produce steel from the mining of taconite. * Soudan is an unincorporated community in Breitung Township, Saint Louis County. It is located immediately east of the city of Tower on Minn.Highway 169 / Minn.Highway 1, where the area school and business district are located. It is the home of the Soudan Underground Mine State Park which contained the University of Minnesota's Soudan Underground Laboratory which housed detectors, including MINOS, over 700 meters below the surface of the Earth. * Taconite (pop. 360) named after the taconite pellets from iron ore was a town many miners lived in. The town recently celebrated its centennial year and is famous for its rich hockey tradition. * Two Harbors (pop. 3,745) is the county seat of Lake County, Minnesota along the shore of Lake Superior. The town was historically an important port for loading and shipping iron ore from the Range. However, like Duluth, Two Harbors is not itself a mining town. * Virginia (pop. 8,712), perched next to the Rouchleau mine pit which is nearly three miles long, a half-mile wide and 450 feet deep. Virginia is the major retail shopping center of the northern part of the Iron Range, and has the Thunderbird Mall. Four miles north of Virginia is the Laurentian Divide, which separates the watershed of the streams that flow north to the Arctic Ocean from the watershed of the streams that flow southeast through the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. The motion picture \\"North Country\\" was also partly filmed in Virginia, notably the courthouse sequences. * Winton (pop 172). Once several times larger than Ely, Winton sits just 3 miles north of Ely, and was once home to a very large lumber mill and was a lumber boomtown. Culture The area has a recognizably Italian, Slavic, and Scandinavian/Nordic heritage. A noticeable northern Minnesota accent is present in the area, especially among older people, hence the popular nickname, \\"Da Range.\\" See also North Central American English. Ice hockey is a predominant sport in the region, which has produced several NHL players as well as all three members of the \\"Iron line\\" from the 1980 U.S.A. Hockey Miracle on Ice team. Bob Dylan, who grew up in Hibbing, memorialized the Iron Range in the 1963 song \\"North Country Blues\\", a lament portraying hard times in the region. Presented in his 1964 album The Times They Are a-Changin', it includes such lines as: :So the mining gates locked and the red iron rotted :And the room smelled heavy from drinking :When the sad, silent song made the hour twice as long :As I waited for the sun to go sinking The Iron Range is known for Cornish pasties stuffed with carrots, ground beef and potatoes. Pasties were an easy lunch for those working deep in the iron mines. Slovenian and Croatian immigrants brought the honey-nut bread called potica to the Iron Range region that is still served at Easter and Christmas in northern Minnesota. Politics The rural area has remained a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party stronghold because of its history of a largely unionized workforce in the mining industry, the mainstay of the economy of the Iron Range. In 2004, John Kerry carried most of the counties in the region by a comfortable margin. This was perhaps aided by George W. Bush referring to the area as the \\"Iron Ridge\\" in a campaign speech. Barack Obama outperformed McCain in 2008, carrying every county in the Iron Range. The area remains the greatest Democratic stronghold in Minnesota after the urban centers of Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2016, Donald Trump's populist message enabled him to gain ground in the Iron Range, winning multiple counties and reducing the Democratic margins of victory in others. Climate The region is known for harsh winters, and pleasant summers. The average year-round temperature is in the 30s ¬∞F (between about 2 ¬∞C and 4 ¬∞C). Temperatures below ‚àí40 ¬∞F/¬∞C occur somewhere in the region during most winters. For example, statistics from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center climate summaries , record that Virginia, MN has a mean annual temperature of 38 ¬∞F, with an average January low temperature of ‚àí6.2 ¬∞F (about ‚àí21 ¬∞C) and July high of 77.4 ¬∞F (25 ¬∞C). Precipitation there averages 27 in (690 mm) annually and snowfall 53.2 in (135 cm). Near Lake Superior, the temperature differences are somewhat less extreme, but due to its proximity to the lake annual snowfalls over 100 inches are common.

Fox, the commanding officer of the destroyer , who went down with his ship when she was torpedoed and sunk in the naval battle of Guadalcanal on 13 November 1942. Fox was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his contribution to the defeat of a superior enemy force in this battle, and was later awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a second Navy Cross for earlier actions on 26 and 30 October and 3 November, when he rescued survivors of the aircraft carrier under hazardous conditions. Douglas H. Fox was launched 30 September 1944 by Todd-Pacific Shipyards, Inc., Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. J. T. Boone; and commissioned 26 December 1944, Commander R. M. Pitts in command.

Between 3 September and 22 December 1957, she joined elements of the British and Canadian navies for a NATO exercise in the North Atlantic, visiting the Mediterranean before returning to Norfolk to resume local operations. Between 7 August 1959 and 26 February 1960, she served again in the Mediterranean, as well as in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, returning to Norfolk for overhaul. From June through the end of 1960, H. Fox operated off the East Coast, cruising north of the Arctic Circle on NATO maneuvers, and patrolling in the Caribbean during political unrest in Central America. After completing a 1961 Mediterranean deployment, Fox participated in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) exercises and patrols through March 1962. At that time the ship went into the Norfolk Naval Shipyard for a FRAM II (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) conversion. Included in the changes were updated torpedo mounts, and a Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH) and Variable-Depth Sonar (VDS) system. In November 1962, she departed from the yard with this increased ASW capability, more modern and comfortable quarters, and a longer life expectancy with the United States Navy. 1963-1973 In December 1962, Douglas H. Fox reported to the Fleet Training Group at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba for refresher training and base defense. In February and March 1963, the ship took part in Operation Springboard - 63, an extensive training cruise in the Caribbean, after which she resumed her ASW ready duties with the Atlantic Fleet.

From November 1965 to April 1966 she was in Norfolk Naval Shipyard undergoing overhaul. In July 1966, she returned to the Mediterranean and paid a visit to Safi, Morocco. Fox was the first American warship to visit Safi in seventeen years. The ship returned to Norfolk 17 December 1966, and in 1967 the ship performed a variety of work with the Second Fleet, with the major emphasis on anti-submarine warfare. Much time was spent in this period in areas just east of Cape Hatteras. In May 1967, Fox operated with 55 ships from four countries in Operation Fizwiz Sunrise. In June, a NATO exercise called New Look took the ship to the North Atlantic for ten days of highly competitive ASW operations with the Royal Canadian Navy. In addition, there were two weeks of operations out of Key West as a school ship for the Fleet Sonar School. On 1 September 1967 the ship began a five-month deployment with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. In September 1968, 323 miles southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, while en route for a return visit to Vietnam, a pinhole ruptured in the HPS (High Pressure Steam) pipe in the aft fireroom, killing nine seamen and injuring thirty five. The fire was brought under control and the ship returned to port under tow. After extensive repairs were completed at Charleston Naval Shipyard, Fox departed again for Vietnam arriving in February 1969. From February to September, she operated in the Vietnam area on a variety of assignments which included plane-guarding in the Tonkin Gulf, and harassment and interdiction fire on a regular basis. She also operated independently providing close-in gunfire support to troops on numerous occasions. =Chilean Navy= On 15 December 1973, Douglas H. Fox was given orders to proceed to the Navy Yard at Philadelphia to be decommissioned. After decommissioning, the ship was sold to Chile for further naval service. Under a different flag and with a new name, Ministro Portales (DD-17) served its new country for another 22 years. Between 1975 and 1976 she was refitted with an extension in the flight deck. Ministro Portales participated in the Beagle-Channel diplomatic conflict in 1978. in this period, all the Chilean navy ships were camouflaged. This ship was decommissioned from the Chilean Navy in 1990. Ministro Portales was sunk off Cape Horn on 11 November 1998 at 15:47 hours (Chilean time).Ministro Portales Awards Douglas H.

Writers disagree in how much of the shield's surface is to be covered by a fess or other ordinary, ranging from one-fifth to one-third. The Oxford Guide to Heraldry states that earlier writers including Leigh, Holme, and Guillim favour one-third, while later writers such as Edmondson favour one-fifth \\"on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable.\\"Woodcock & Robinson (1988), Oxford Guide to Heraldry, p. 58. A fess is likely to be shown narrower if it is uncharged, that is, if it does not have other charges placed on it, and/or if it is to be shown with charges above and below it; and shown wider if charged. The fess or bar, termed fasce in French heraldry, should not be confused with fasces.

A shield of (often six or eight) horizontal stripes of alternating colour is called barry. Narrower versions of the bar are called barrulets (\\"little bars\\"), and when a shield of horizontal stripes alternating colour is composed of ten or more stripes, it is called barruly or burely instead of barry. A cotise, defined as half the width of a barrulet, may be borne alongside a fess, and often two of these appear, one on either side of the fess. This is often termed \\"a fess cotised\\" (also cottised, coticed or cotticed). Another diminutive of the fess called a closet is said to be between a bar and barrulet, but this is seldom found. A fess when couped (\\"cut off\\" at either end, and so not reaching the sides of the shield) can be called humetty, but this term is very rare in the Anglophone heraldries and is most often used of the cross.

A charge placed horizontally may be termed fesswise or fessways, and two or more charges arranged in a horizontal row are blazoned in fess or in bar. Notable and unusual forms A mural fess, that is a fess embattled and masoned of the field, can be seen in the arms of Suzanne Elizabeth Altvater. The arms of Baroness Fritchie provide an example of three Barrulets fracted and there conjoined to a Chevronel. A flag which has a central horizontal stripe that is half the height of the flag is sometimes said to have a Spanish fess. The name is based on the most well-known example of this style of flag, the flag of Spain. See also * Bar (heraldry) Notes Further reading * Boutell, Charles (1890).

Long a serial composer, Rochberg abandoned the practice following the death of his teenage son in 1964; he claimed this compositional technique had proved inadequate to express his grief and had found it empty of expressive intent. By the 1970s, Rochberg's use of tonal passages in his music had invoked controversy among critics and fellow composers. A teacher at the University of Pennsylvania until 1983, Rochberg also served as chairman of its music department until 1968 and was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities in 1978. For notable students Life Born in Paterson, New Jersey, Rochberg attended first the Mannes College of Music, where his teachers included George Szell and Hans Weisse, then the Curtis Institute of Music, where he studied with Rosario Scalero and Gian Carlo Menotti. He served in the United States Army in the infantry during World War II. He was Jewish . Rochberg served as chairman of the music department at the University of Pennsylvania until 1968 and continued to teach there until 1983. In 1978, he was named the first Annenberg Professor of the Humanities . He married Gene Rosenfeld in 1941, and had two children, Paul and Francesca. In 1964, his son died of a brain tumor. Rochberg died in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania in 2005, aged 86. Most of his works are held in the archive of the Paul Sacher Foundation in Basel, Switzerland. Some can also be found in the Music Division of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress in Washington D.C., the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, New York, the University of Pennsylvania, Curtis Institute of Music, Philadelphia, and the City University of New York. Music A longtime exponent of serialism, Rochberg abandoned this compositional technique upon the death of his teenage son in 1964. He said he had found serialism empty of expressive intent and that it had proved an inadequate means for him to express his grief and rage. By the 1970s, Rochberg had become controversial for the use of tonal passages in his music. His use of tonality first became widely known through the String Quartet No. 3 (1972), which includes an entire set of variations that are in the style of late Beethoven. Another movement of the quartet contains passages reminiscent of the music of Gustav Mahler. This use of tonality caused critics to classify him as a neoromantic composer. He compared atonality to abstract art and tonality to concrete art and compared his artistic evolution with Philip Guston's, saying \\"the tension between concreteness and abstraction\\" is a fundamental issue for both of them . His music has also been described as neoconservative postmodernism . Of the works Rochberg composed early in his career, the Symphony No. 2 (1955‚Äì56) stands out as an accomplished serial composition by an American composer. He is perhaps best known for his String Quartets Nos. 3‚Äì6 (1972‚Äì78). Rochberg conceived Nos. 4‚Äì6 as a set and named them the \\"Concord Quartets\\" after the Concord String Quartet, which premiered and recorded the works. The String Quartet No. 6 includes a set of variations on the Pachelbel Canon in D. A few of his works were musical collages of quotations from other composers. \\"Contra Mortem et Tempus\\", for example, contains passages from Pierre Boulez, Luciano Berio, Edgard Var√®se and Charles Ives. Symphonies Nos. 1, 2, and 5, and the Violin Concerto were recorded in 2001‚Äì2002 by the Saarbr√ºcken Radio Symphony Orchestra and conductor Christopher Lyndon Gee and released on the Naxos label. =Legacy= James Freeman, musician and teacher at Swarthmore College, said this about Rochberg and serialism: \\"If George Rochberg can do something like that, there's nothing that I can't do and get away with it. I don't have to write 12-tone music; I can if I want to. I can write stuff that sounds like Brahms. I can do anything I want. I'm free. And that was an extraordinary feeling in the late 1960s for young composers, I think, many of whom felt really constrained to write serial music\\" . Writings Rochberg's collected essays were published by the University of Michigan Press in 1984 as The Aesthetics of Survival. A revised and expanded edition , published shortly before his death, was awarded an ASCAP Deems Taylor Award in 2006 .

In this sequel to Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, Max (Mel Gibson) is exiled into the desert by the ruthless ruler of Bartertown, Aunty Entity (Tina Turner), and there encounters an isolated cargo cult centred on a crashed Boeing 747 and its deceased captain. The film is the third installment in the Mad Max film series and the last with Gibson as Max Rockatansky. The series was given a fourth installment in 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road, starring Tom Hardy in the title role. Plot In post-apocalyptic Australia, Max Rockatansky is crossing the desert in a camel-drawn V8 wagon when he is attacked by a Transavia PL-12 Airtruk piloted by a man named Jedediah and his son. They steal his wagon and belongings, and Max continues on foot, following their trail to a survivor community named 'Bartertown' - which has rebuilt ramshackle vestiges of basic civilization, even electricity. Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, Max is brought before the founder and ruler of Bartertown, the ruthless Aunty Entity. She offers to resupply his vehicle and equipment if he completes a task for her. Aunty explains that Bartertown‚Äôs electrical supply depends on a crude methane refinery powered by pig feces. The refinery is run by a dwarf called Master and his giant bodyguard Blaster. \\"Master Blaster\\" holds an uneasy truce with Aunty for control of Bartertown; however, Master has begun to challenge Aunty's leadership. Aunty instructs Max to provoke a confrontation with Blaster. According to Bartertown law, conflicts are resolved by a duel to the death in a gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome. Max enters the subterranean Underworld refinery area to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work for slaughtering a pig to feed his family. Max finds his stolen vehicle in Master/Blaster's possession and is forced to disarm his own booby-trapped engine. Here he discovers that although Blaster is exceptionally strong, he is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises, which severely disorient and incapacitate him. Accusing Master of the theft of his vehicle, Max provokes him into demanding justice for the insult by entering Blaster into a Thunderdome duel with Max. Blaster dominates the duel until Max is able to use his bosun's whistle to gain the upper hand. Poised to kill Blaster, Max knocks his helmet off and is shocked to discover that Blaster has Down syndrome. Max refuses to kill a man with \\"the mind of a child\\" and confronts Aunty for deceiving him, thus exposing her plot. Master, previously unaware of this arrangement to kill Blaster, is furious and vows to shut down the refinery and, by extension, Bartertown. Aunty has Blaster killed, Master imprisoned, and Max exiled. He is bound on a horse and sent off in a random direction through the wasteland. When his mount perishes in a sinkhole, Max frees himself and presses on. Near death, Max is found by a desert dweller named Savannah Nix, who hauls him back to her home, \\"Planet Erf\\", a primitive community of children and teenagers who live in an oasis. The children, descended from survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, were left by their parents who went to find civilization. They believe Max to be the flight captain, G. L. Walker, returned to fix the aeroplane and fly them to civilization. Max denies this and insists that they remain in the relative safety of the oasis, knowing that the only \\"civilization\\" within reach is Bartertown. Some of the children, led by Savannah, leave anyway, determined to find the prophesied \\"Tomorrow-morrow Land.\\" Max stops them by force, but another tribe member, Scrooloose, sets them free during the night and leaves with them. Their leader, Slake M'Thirst, asks Max to go after them, and he agrees, taking a few of the children with him to help. They find Savannah's group in danger but are unable to save one of the children from a sinkhole. With no supplies left, they are forced to head for Bartertown. The group sneak in via an underground entrance, and, with Pig Killer's help, free Master and escape in a train- truck, destroying Bartertown's methane refinery in the process. Aunty leads the Imperial Guards in pursuit chasing in their postmodern vehicles, catching up to the train. Max's group slows them down while Scrooloose hijacks one of the pursuing vehicles. The group comes across Jedediah and his son, and Max coerces Jedediah into helping his group escape with their aeroplane. Max uses his vehicle to clear a path through Aunty's men, allowing the aeroplane to take off and escape, leaving him at Aunty's mercy. Aunty spares his life, having come to respect him, and departs to presumably make good on her vow to rebuild Bartertown. Jedediah flies the children to the coast, where they discover the nuclear-devastated ruins of Sydney. Years later, the children have established a small society of themselves and other lost wanderers in the ruins. Savannah, now leader of the group, recites a nightly story of their journey and the man who saved them, as Max, still alive in the desert, wanders on to places unknown. Cast * Mel Gibson as \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky, a former MFP officer and lone warrior. Max roves the desert aimlessly, his existence entirely based around self-survival. * Tina Turner as Aunty Entity, the ruthless, determined ruler of Bartertown. Entity is a glamorous, Amazon-like figure who recognises a strength of character in Max, and hopes to exploit him to gain sole control of Bartertown from Master. Despite her brutality and Bartertown's chaos, Entity is an intelligent, cultured woman, who holds a hope of one day rebuilding society to its former glory. In regard of the character, Miller said, \\"We needed someone whose vitality and intelligence would make her control over Bartertown credible. She had to be a positive character rather than a conventional evil 'bad guy.' We had worked on the script with [Turner] in mind. But we had no idea if she'd be interested.\\" * Bruce Spence as Jedediah the Pilot, a marauding pilot who trades stolen goods in Bartertown. Spence previously played the Gyro Captain in Mad Max 2. \\"They were well into the shoot when they offered me a part described as 'not the Gyro Captain but kind of like the Gyro Captain!'\\" said Spence. \\"They said there's kind of a reflection of him and that they were having difficulty casting the role so they thought to themselves, 'Why not Bruce!'\\" * Adam Cockburn as Jedediah Jr., Jedediah's son, who often helps his father steal supplies, flying his father's aeroplane while Jedediah procures the goods. * Frank Thring as the Collector, head of Bartertown's trade and exchange network. * Angelo Rossitto as Master, a diminutive former engineer, who parlays his technical expertise into building the methane extractor responsible for Bartertown's electricity. When the film begins, Master has grown power-crazed under the protection of Blaster, and the reverence he receives from the people of Bartertown. He frequently humiliates Entity into acknowledging his power over her. When Blaster is killed however, Master becomes a far more subdued, humble character, and eventually escapes with the help of Max, Pig Killer, and the children. * Paul Larsson as Blaster, Master's silent, mentally-impaired bodyguard. * Angry Anderson as Ironbar Bassey, head of Bartertown's security and Aunty Entity's Number One Henchman. Despite his short height he is a fierce warrior figure, wearing a doll's head standard on his back, who comes to dislike Max more and more as the film proceeds. After several near-death incidents where his survival becomes more and more unlikely, he is last seen giving the middle finger to the escaping heroes, having somehow survived even the film's climactic chase. * Robert Grubb as the Pig Killer, a convict in Bartertown sentenced to work in the methane refinery, shovelling pig feces, for the crime of killing one of Underworld's pigs to feed his children. He befriends Max, and when Max and the children return to rescue Master, the Pig Killer escapes to help them. * Helen Buday as Savannah Nix, leader of a tribe of child survivors (or the children of those survivors) from a crashed 747. Savannah is the one who ensures the tribe remembers its past through the \\"tells\\" and acts as a surrogate mother figure to many of them. * Tom Jennings as Slake M'Thirst, the male leader of the child tribe. * Edwin Hodgeman as Dr. Dealgood, the flamboyant Master of Ceremonies and chief auctioneer of Bartertown. *Rod Zuanic as Scrooloose. The misfit child able to copy everyone else's abilities and manners. * George Spartels as Blackfinger. Production Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was the first Mad Max film made without producer Byron Kennedy, who was killed in a helicopter crash in 1983 while location scouting for the film. While the film was in development before Kennedy's death, director George Miller was hesitant to continue without his producing partner. \\"I was reluctant to go ahead,\\" said Miller. \\"And then there was a sort of need to ‚Äì let's do something just to get over the shock and grief of all of that.\\" A title card at the end of film reads: \\"...For Byron\\". Miller ended up co-directing the film with George Ogilvie, with whom he had worked on the 1983 miniseries The Dismissal. \\"I had a lot on my plate,\\" said Miller. \\"I asked my friend George Ogilvie, who was working on the mini-series, 'Could you come and help me?' But I don't remember the experience because I was doing it to just... You know, I was grieving.\\" Together, Miller and Ogilvie used a group workshopping rehearsal technique that they had developed.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 p85-87 Exterior location filming took place primarily in the mining town of Coober Pedy, with the set for Bartertown built at an old brickworks (the Brickpit) at Homebush Bay in Sydney's western suburbs and the children's camp shot at the Blue Mountains. \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome proved far more challenging than The Road Warrior,\\" said cinematographer Dean Semler. \\"We were dealing with more varied environments than before and it was essential that each of the worlds created for the film have a distinctly different look.\\" =Music= The musical score for Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was composed by Maurice Jarre, replacing Brian May, who composed the music for the previous two films. The film also contains two songs performed by Tina Turner, \\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\" and \\"One of the Living\\", with the latter replacing Jarre's opening titles music. A soundtrack album was originally released by Capitol Records in 1985. It includes Turner's \\"We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\\", which reached #1 in Canada, #2 in the US and #3 in the British single charts; it plays over the end credits. \\"One of the Living\\" was rerecorded for single release, and reached #15 in both Canada and the US, but only #55 in Britain. The song also won a Grammy for Best Rock Vocal. A double CD containing only Jarre's original music was issued in 2010 on Tadlow Music/Silva Screen Records. Release Although the film's budget was more extravagant than its predecessors', its box office yield was only moderate in comparison. Beyond Thunderdome grossed A$4,272,802 at the box office in Australia. In the United States and Canada it grossed $36 million, generating theatrical rentals of $18 million. Outside of the US, it earned a similar amount, giving it worldwide rentals of $36 million. =Critical reception= Critical reaction to the film was generally positive, although reviewers disagreed as to whether they considered the film the highest or lowest point of the Mad Max trilogy. Most of the criticism focused on the children in the second half of the film, whom many found too similar to the Lost Boys from the story of Peter Pan. Robert C. Cumbow of Slant Magazine identifies \\"whole ideas, themes and characterizations\\" adopted from Riddley Walker, a 1980 post-apocalyptic novel by Russell Hoban. On the other hand, critics praised the Thunderdome scene in particular; film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the Thunderdome \\"the first really original movie idea about how to stage a fight since we got the first karate movies\\" and praised the fight between Max and Blaster as \\"one of the great creative action scenes in the movies\\". Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4 and later placed the film on his list of the 10 best pictures of 1985.Ebert's 10 Best Lists: 1967-present via the Internet Archive. Chicago Sun-Times. Retrieved 11 May 2013. Variety wrote that the film \\"opens strong\\" and has good acting from Gibson, Turner, and the children. Despite mostly positive reviews from critics, some fans of the series have criticised the film for being \\"Hollywood-ized\\" and having a lighter tone than its predecessors. The film holds an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 49 reviews with an average rating of 6.43/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Beyond Thunderdome deepens the Mad Max character without sacrificing the amazing vehicle choreography and stunts that made the originals memorable\\". =Legacy= As with the previous installments of the Mad Max series, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome has influenced popular culture in various regards. The term \\"thunderdome\\" is now used in various contexts in which its meaning is similar to the sense in which it appears in the film, a contest where the loser suffers a great hardship. American filmmaker Chris Weitz has cited the film as an influence.

Early life  Garc√≠a Granados was born in Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, Spain. As a young adolescent, he was brought to Central America. He was a member of a wealthy military family. At age twenty- three, Granados visited South America, Europe and the cities of New York and Philadelphia in the US. He completed his schooling in London.Guatemalan Military Museum: Miguel Garc√≠a Granados Reviewed on August 7th 2014. He was the brother of Guatemalan writer Mar√≠a Josefa Garc√≠a Granados.  Career  Garc√≠a Granados was known as a moderate liberal. He compromised with Rafael Carrera, and attempted to get along with his successor Vicente Cerna. Sympathetic with the revolt against the government, Garc√≠a Granados fled to exile and was supported by Guatemalan liberals. After returning to Guatemala, Garc√≠a Granados became the leader of the revolution against Cerna, eventually becoming known as its philosopher. Garc√≠a Granados played a key part in the regime of Justo Rufino Barrios, the founder of \\"the army of 45 men\\". He served as a provisional president from 1871 to 1873 after the liberal victory of Guatemala City. Garc√≠a Granados wanted to regularize the government by constructing a lawful regime. In 1872, Guatemala invaded Honduras, where Garc√≠a Granados decreed freedom of the press and expelled the Jesuits. Garc√≠a Granados and his successor Barrios support multiple liberal revolts. During his presidency, Garc√≠a Granados created the Guatemalan flag by decree, which remains almost identical to his 1871 version. Garcia Granados supported education and the arts. In 1871 he invited Italian conductor Pietro Visoni to stay in Guatemala and become the director of the main military band. Visoni later founded the Martial Symphony Band and the School of Substitutes (Escuela de Substitutos), the first formal music conservatory in Central America. After Garc√≠a Granados stepped down, Barrios served as president until the mid-1870s.  Retirement  Garc√≠a Granados retired from public life to write articles for Guatemalan magazines and newspapers; accounts of the time when he was the leader of the liberal forces and as president; an essay about monetary policy and two volumes of memoirs. Garc√≠a Granados Monument. Located on Avenida La Reforma, in front of the old Guatemalan Military School. In 1877, he arrived in Guatemala Jos√© Mart√≠, who started teaching in the just founded Instituto Nacional Central para Varones and Escuela Normal para Varones. In those days, the high schools' faculty included Spaniard politician Valero Pujol, German engineer Edwin Rockstroh and Cuban poet Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Palma, who used to gather for intellectual conversations. In one of those meetings, Mart√≠ met Mar√≠a Garc√≠a Granados y Sabor√≠o, general Garc√≠a Granados' daughter. Despite his engagement to a Cuban woman, Mart√≠ started visiting the Garcia Granados residency, where he frequently played chess with the general and paid his respects to Mar√≠a. Mar√≠a fell in love with Mart√≠, but after a sudden trip to Mexico in early 1878, came back to Guatemala already married. A few weeks after Marti left for good, Mar√≠a died, followed shortly thereafter by her father. In 1891, Mart√≠ wrote a poem in her memory, named La Ni√±a de Guatemala,The Girl from Guatemala. in which he implies that she died from love.  Death  Garcia Granados died on September 8, 1878 at age 69. Garcia Granaods was laid to rest in the old San Juan de Dios Cemetery.That cemetery was located where the San Juan de Dios Hospital in downtown Guatemala City stands today. In 1894, his remains were transferred to a monument erected in his honor at the new General Cemetery. His portrait appears on the 10 Quetzales bank note.

Turner would retain the name of the band throughout his career, although the group has undergone considerable line-up changes over time. The group was an offshoot of a large big band ensemble called \\"The Tophatters.\\" By the late 1940s Turner had renamed this group the \\"Kings of Rhythm.\\" Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits of the day. In 1951, Turner and his Kings of Rhythm recorded the song \\"Rocket 88\\" (credited to Jackie Brenston and His Delta Cats),\\" which is a contender for the first rock and roll record. The song is inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, the Grammy Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles. In the 1960s, the Kings of Rhythm became the band for the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. For a few years in the early 1970s they were renamed the Family Vibes, and released two albums under that name. After the disbanding of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 1976, Turner revived the Kings of Rhythm in 2001 and released the Grammy-nominated album Here And Now. The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues (2006). After Turner died in 2007, the band for some time was under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane, who was a childhood friend of Turner's. The Kings of Rhythm continue to perform with vocalist Earl Thomas. Career =Formation: The Tophatters= In high school, a teenage Ike Turner joined a huge local rhythm ensemble called \\"The Tophatters\\", who played dances around Clarksdale, Mississippi, playing big band arrangements from sheet music. Members of the band were taken from Clarksdale musicians, and included Turner's school friends Raymond Hill, Eugene Fox and Clayton Love. At one point the Tophatters had over 30 members, and eventually split into two, with one act who wanted to carry on playing dance band jazz calling themselves \\"The Dukes of Swing\\" and the other, led by Turner becoming the \\"Kings of Rhythm\\". Rivalry between the two former factions of the Tophatters lasted for some time, with the two staging an open air 'battle-of-the-bands' where they played from atop two flatbed trucks every fortnight. =1940s: Early years= The Kings of Rhythm had a regular Wednesday night residency at Clarksdale's Harlem Theater. This got them bookings around the Mississippi Delta region. Their early stage performances consisted largely of covers of popular jukebox hits. In March 1951 whilst driving between gigs, the Kings of Rhythm dropped in on a B.B. King club date in Chambers, Mississippi. Turner persuaded King to let the band sit in and play a number with him. King contests this, remembering that it was only Turner who sat in with his band. They were well received and the club owner booked them for a weekend residency, whilst King recommended them to Sam Philips at Sun Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. In the 50s, The Kings received regular airplay from live sessions on Clarksdale radio station WROX-AM, at the behest of DJ Early Wright. The band would sometimes play a session that lasted an hour. =1951: \\"Rocket 88\\"= Sam Phillips invited the Kings of Rhythm down to Memphis to record at Sun Studios, and the group had to devise an original song at short notice for the session. The saxophonist, Jackie Brenston, suggested a song about the new Rocket 88 Oldsmobile. Turner worked out the arrangement and the piano introduction and the band collaborated on the rest with Brenston on vocals. \\"Rocket 88\\" came out with the group erroneously credited as Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, instead of Ike Turner and his Kings of Rhythm featuring Jackie Brenston. The single went on to sell half a million copies, reaching the top of the Billboard R&B; charts in June 1951. The success of the record caused divisions within the group, with Brenston believing he was now the star and should front the group, and Turner and Raymond Hill bitter that they had received little recognition or recompense for writing and recording a hit record. Turner and the band were only paid $20 each for the record,\\"Ike Turner.\\" Unsung. Exec. Prod. Frank Sinton, Arthur Smith, Kent Weed, and Mark Rowland. Nar. Gary Anthony Williams. TV One, 17. Dec. 2012. Television. with the exception of Brenston who sold the rights to Phillips for $910. The group's regular singer, Johnny O'Neal, had left prior to the recording of \\"Rocket 88\\" to sign a contract with King Records, but Turner still refused to allow Brenston to take over as singer. Following the success of the record, Brenston was convinced he was the star of the group and left to pursue a solo career. This caused the group to fall apart with some members backing Brenston on the road. However Turner held onto the name and soon reformed the Kings of Rhythm with a new line-up. = 1952‚Äì1954: Sun/Modern Records = Between 1952 and 1954, Turner became a session musician and production assistant for Sam Philips at Sun Records and the Bihari brothers at Modern/RPM Records. Turner was also a freelance talent scout, and used the Kings of Rhythm as session musicians. They played on many recording for the Biharis Modern, RPM, and Flair labels. Turner's wife Bonnie Turner was a pianist and vocalist in his new line-up. They released the record, \\"My Heart Belongs To You\\" / \\"Looking for My Baby\\" from RPM in 1952. The Kings of Rhythm which included Bonnie Turner, Raymond Hill, Billy \\"The Kid\\" Emerson and Johnny O'Neal recorded for Sun in 1953 and 1954. Some of the recordings remained unissued until Charly Records released of Sun: The Roots Of Rock: Volume 3: Delta Rhythm Kings in 1976. Turner and the Kings of Rhythm last recorded for Sun in 1958 with Tommy Hodge, by then, Phillips had shifted his focus onto rockabilly music and wasn't recording many black musicians anymore. = 1954‚Äì1962: St. Louis = In late 1954, Turner took the reformed version of Kings of Rhythm north to East St. Louis, which included Kizart, Sims, O'Neal, Jessie Knight, Jr. and Turner's then wife Annie Mae Wilson on piano and vocals. Around this time, Turner moved over to playing guitar to accommodate Wilson, taking lessons from Willie Kizart to improve. Turner maintained strict discipline over the band, insisting they lived in a large house with him so he could conduct early morning rehearsals at a moment's notice. He would fire anyone he suspected of drinking or taking drugs, and would fine or physically assault band-members if they played a wrong note. He controlled everything from the arrangements down to the suits the band wore onstage. Starting off playing at a club called Kingsbury's in Madison, Illinois, within a year Turner had built up a full gig schedule, establishing his group as one of the most highly rated on the St. Louis club circuit, vying for popularity with their only real competition, Sir John's Trio featuring Chuck Berry. The bands would play all-nighters in St. Louis, then cross the river to the clubs of East St. Louis, and continue playing until dawn. In St. Louis for the first time Turner and the band were exposed to a developing white teenage audience who were excited by R&B.; Clubs they played in St. Louis included Club Imperial, which was popular with white teenagers, The Dynaflow, The Moonlight Lounge, Club Riviera and the West End Walters. In East St. Louis, the group would play at Kingsbury's, Manhattan Club and The Sportsman. In between live dates, Turner took the band to Cincinnati to record for Federal in 1956. The session produced the regional hit \\"I'm Tore Up,\\" featuring lead vocalist Billy Gayles. In 1958, the band recorded for Cobra/Artistic in Chicago. He befriended St. Louis R&B; fan Bill Stevens, who in 1959 set up the short-lived record label, Stevens Records, financed by his father Fred. Turner recorded numerous sessions for Stevens with various vocalists and musician lineups of the Kings of Rhythm, of which seven singles were released (these are collected on the Red Lightnin' compilation Hey Hey (RL0047). None of the Stevens records had wide distribution and the operation ceased after a year. In addition the band appeared on local television shows. They toured the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\" of black southern clubs for many years. = 1960‚Äì1976: The Ike & Tina Turner Revue = After the addition of his future wife Little Ann (Tina Turner) as lead singer, Turner formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. The creation of the revue was in a large part the birth of the soul revues of the 1960s. The Kings of Rhythm and Tina were joined on stage by the Ikettes who contributed backing vocals and choreographed dance moves. As backing band to the duo, the band played on many substantial soul hits, including the million sellers \\"A Fool In Love\\" (1960) and \\"It's Gonna Work Out Fine\\"(1961) both for Sue Records. Also included in the revue were male singers Stacy Johnson, Vernon Guy, Jimmy Thomas and Bobby John. Turner moved the revue to California in 1962. In the mid-1960s Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band. Turner fired him because his guitar solos became \\"so elaborate they overstepped the bounds.\\" In 1964, the band released the single \\"Getting Nasty\\" / \\"Nutting Up\\" under the alias Nasty Minds on Turner's Sonja label. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue was featured in the 1966 concert film The Big T.N.T. Show. The lineup for that performance was Turner and Herb Sadler on guitar, James Norwood on drums, Sam Rhodes on bass and Ernest Lane on piano. In 1971, the Kings of Rhythm were renamed Family Vibes. They released two albums under that name, Strange Fruit (1972) and Confined to Soul (1973), both produced by Turner. The Ike & Tina Turner Revue disbanded in 1976 following an altercation between the Turners. = 1986‚Äì1987: St. Louis Kings of Rhythm = In 1986, a revival of the King of Rhythm consisting of several veteran members toured Europe as the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm. The tour extended into 1987, and an album titled St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm was released on Timeless Records in Europe. Mayor Vincent Schoemehl officially appointed the St. Louis Kings Of Rhythm ambassadors for the City of St. Louis. = 2001‚Äìpresent: Reformation = In the late 1990s Turner toured with Joe Louis Walker, the positive response to the tour encouraged him to reform the Kings of Rhythm. The King of Rhythm toured the U.S. in 2001 and headlined a showcase at South by Southwest where they were hailed as one of the highlights of the conference. This led to the recording and release of the Grammy-nominated album Here And Now (2001) by Turner and the Kings of Rhythm. The album won two W.C. Handy Awards, the Blues Foundation's equivalent of the Grammy Awards, for Best Traditional Blues Album and Comeback Album of the Year in 2002. They received positive reviews for their performances at various music festivals, including Montreux Jazz Festival (2002), North Sea Jazz Festival (2002), and Jazz √† Vienne (2004). The Kings of Rhythm backed Turner on his Grammy-winning album Risin' With The Blues (2006). After Turner died in December 2007, the band was temporarily under the leadership of pianist Ernest Lane (1931‚Äì2012), a childhood friend of Turner's. The band performed Turner's classic songs at his funeral. Since 2008, the band has performed with vocalist Earl Thomas. Thomas became a fan of Ike & Tina Turner after watching the film Soul To Soul (1971) as a child. He met Turner in 2004 and remained in contact with him until his death.  Legacy  By some accounts, \\"Rocket 88\\" is considered the first rock and roll record. Speaking on \\"Rocket 88\\" being a contender for the first rock 'n' roll record, broadcaster Paul Gambaccini said: > In musical terms [he was] very important. \\"Rocket 88\\" is one of the two > records that can claim to be the first rock 'n' roll record, the other being > \\"The Fat Man\\" by Fats Domino from 1949. But \\"Rocket 88\\" does have a couple > of elements which \\"The Fat Man\\" did not. The wailing saxophone and that > distorted electric guitar.

She was a professor of psychology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, noted for her pioneering work in the field of evolutionary psychology and her contributions to the study of violence. Biography Wilson was born on October 1, 1942, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. She spent her childhood years in the Gwich'in community of Fort McPherson, where her mother, a nurse, provided medical services. She attended the University of Alberta, graduating with an undergraduate degree in psychology in 1964. She then studied behavioural endocrinology at the University of California and, after winning the a Commonwealth Scholarship, at University College London, England, where she earned her PhD in 1972. From 1972 through 1975, she was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Toronto, where she met her future husband, fellow psychologist Martin Daly. Together, they moved to Hamilton in 1978 after Daly was hired by McMaster University. In the 1980s, Wilson was appointed professor of Psychology at McMaster, where she remained for the rest of her career. Wilson was elected president of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in 1997. With Daly, she was, for 10 years, the editor-in- chief of the journal Evolution and Human Behavior,. In 1998, she was named a fellow of the Royal Society. Wilson died in Hamilton on September 24, 2009, of cancer. In 2009, the Human Behavior and Evolution Society established the Margo Wilson Award (for best paper published in the previous year) to honour her contributions to the field.  Research  In 1978, Wilson proposed the idea to Daly that they could analyze patterns of homicide to better understand humans' social behaviours from an evolutionary perspective. For the next 30 years, Wilson and Daly collaborated on this research, authoring several books and over 100 academic papers and book chapters in this area.\\"Margo Wilson's research shed light on evolutionary psychology\\" by Julia Belluz, The Globe and Mail, October 1, 2009 Their first book on this topic, Homicide (1988), has been described as a \\"founding\\" and \\"classic\\" text for the field of evolutionary psychology.

Biography Son of Thomas Shenstone and Anne Penn, daughter of William Penn of Harborough Hall, then in Hagley (now Blakedown), Shenstone was born at the Leasowes, Halesowen on 18 November 1714. At that time this was an exclave of Shropshire within the county of Worcestershire and now in the West Midlands. Shenstone received part of his formal education at Halesowen Grammar School (now The Earls High School). In 1741, Shenstone became bailiff to the feoffees of Halesowen Grammar School. While attending Solihull School, he began a lifelong friendship with Richard Jago. He went up to Pembroke College, Oxford in 1732 and made another firm friend there in Richard Graves, the author of The Spiritual Quixote. Shenstone took no degree, but, while still at Oxford, he published Poems on various occasions, written for the entertainment of the author (1737). This edition was intended for private circulation only but, containing the first draft of The Schoolmistress, it attracted some wider attention. Shenstone tried hard to suppress it but in 1742 he published anonymously a revised draft of The Schoolmistress, a Poem in imitation of Spenser. The inspiration of the poem was Sarah Lloyd, teacher of the village school where Shenstone received his first education. Isaac D'Israeli contended that Robert Dodsley had been misled in publishing it as one of a sequence of Moral Poems, its intention having been satirical, as evidenced by the ludicrous index appended to its original publication. The view from the ruined Halesowen Priory towards The Leasowes (on the crest of the hill on the right). In 1741 he published The Judgment of Hercules. He inherited the Leasowes estate, and retired there in 1745 to undertake what proved the chief work of his life, the beautifying of his property. He embarked on elaborate schemes of landscape gardening which gave The Leasowes a wide celebrity (see ferme orn√©e), but sadly impoverished the owner. Shenstone was not a contented recluse. He desired constant admiration of his gardens, and he never ceased to lament his lack of fame as a poet. In 1759, Shenstone made the acquaintance of James Woodhouse, a shoe-maker from nearby Rowley Regis who had started writing poetry. Shenstone encouraged Woodhouse's literary efforts, allowing him access to the library at the Leasowes and including one of Woodhouse's works in a collection of poems published in 1762. Shenstone died unmarried on 11 February 1763. Critical appraisal Shenstone's poems of nature were written in praise of his most artificial aspects, but the emotions they express were obviously genuine. His Schoolmistress was admired by Oliver Goldsmith, with whom Shenstone had much in common, and his Elegies written at various times and to some extent biographical in character won the praise of Robert Burns who, in the preface to Poems, chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786), called him ... that celebrated poet whose divine elegies do honour to our language, our nation and our species. The best example of purely technical skill in his works is perhaps his success in the management of the anapaestic trimeter in his Pastoral Ballad in Four Parts (written in 1743), but first printed in Dodsley's Collection of Poems (vol. iv., 1755). Arthur Schopenhauer mentioned Shenstone in his discussion of equivocation. \\"[C]oncepts\\", Schopenhauer asserted, \\"which in and by themselves contain nothing improper, yet the actual case brought under them leads to an improper conception\\" are called equivocations. He continued: Bibliography Shenstone's works were first published by his friend Robert Dodsley (3 vols., 1764‚Äì1769). The second volume contains Dodsley's description of the Leasowes. The last, consisting of correspondence with Graves, Jago and others, appeared after Dodsley's death. Other letters of Shenstone's are included in Select Letters (ed. Thomas Hill 1778). The letters of Lady Luxborough (n√©e Henrietta St John) to Shenstone were printed by T. Dodsley in 1775; much additional correspondence is preserved in the British Museum letters to Lady Luxborough (Add. MS. 28958), Dodsley's letters to Shenstone (Add. MS. 28959), and correspondence between Shenstone and Bishop Percy from 1757 to 1763 the last being of especial interest; To Shenstone was due the original suggestion of Percy's Reliques, a service which would alone entitle him to a place among the precursors of the romantic movement in English literature. In a letter written in 1741 Shenstone became the first person to record the use of \\"floccinaucinihilipilification\\". In the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary this was recognised as the longest word in the English language.

In recent years they have doubled as more influential political roles while retaining the ceremonial functions. A mayor's term of office denotes the municipal year. The most famous example is that of the Lord Mayor of the City of London. Traditionally mayors and provosts have been elected by town, borough and city councils. Since 2000, several districts now have directly elected mayors with extensive powers. See borough status in the United Kingdom for a list of English districts to have a borough charter (and therefore a mayor). The role of the chairman of a district council is exactly the same as the mayor of a borough council, and they have the same status as first citizen, after the Sovereign, in their district, but they are not addressed as mayor. Election In England, where a borough or a city is a local government district or a civil parish, the mayor is elected annually by the council from their number and chairs meetings of the council with a casting vote. Where the mayoralty used to be associated with a local government district but that district has been abolished, Charter Trustees may be set up to provide continuity until a parish council may be set up. Where a parish council (whether the successor of a former borough or not) has resolved to style itself a Town Council, then its chairman is entitled to the designation Town Mayor, though in practice, the word Town is often dropped. =Direct election= In 2000 the Labour government led by Tony Blair passed a local government reform which changed this system somewhat. Several districts in England now have directly elected mayors with real powers and an advisory cabinet to assist them. Also since 2000, the area of Greater London has had a Greater London Authority headed by the Mayor of London. This is a separate post to the historic and honorific Lord Mayor of London and may be characterised as a strategic, regional, role rather than as anything analogous to previous local government in England. Lord Mayors The right to appoint a Lord Mayor is a rare honour, even less frequently bestowed than city status. Currently, 23 cities in England have Lord Mayors: * Birmingham * Bradford * Bristol * Canterbury * Chester * Coventry * Exeter * Kingston upon Hull * Leeds * Leicester * Liverpool * London * Manchester * Newcastle upon Tyne * Norwich * Nottingham * Oxford * Plymouth * Portsmouth * Sheffield * Stoke-on-Trent * City of Westminster * York. Honorifics The Lord Mayors of London and York are styled The Right Honourable, Bristol also uses the honorific although without official sanction. All other Lord Mayors, as well as the Mayors of cities and the original Cinque Ports (Sandwich, Hythe, Dover, Romney and Hastings, are styled The Right Worshipful. All other Mayors are styled The Worshipful, though this is in practice seldom used for a Town Mayor. These honorific styles are used only before the Mayoral title and not before the name, and are not retained after the term of office. A mayor can also be styled Mr Mayor and usually appoints a consort, usually a spouse, other family member or fellow councillor. In England (and the Commonwealth) the designated female consort of a mayor is usually styled Mayoress or occasionally Mrs Mayor and accompanies the mayor to civic functions. A female mayor is also called mayor, not, as sometimes erroneously called, \\"Lady Mayoress\\". A mayoress or Lady Mayoress is a female consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor; a male consort of a mayor or Lord Mayor is a Mayor's Consort or Lord Mayor's Consort. The Lord Mayor of Bristol uses the prefix without official sanction.The Title of Lord Mayor ‚Äì Use of the Prefix \\"Right Honourable\\", The Times, 7 July 1932, p.16 See also *Local government in England *Municipal year References External links *BBC article *New Local Government Network *English city and regional mayors 2017 Local government in the United Kingdom Ceremonial officers in the United Kingdom ","title":"Mayors in England"},{"id":"598896","text":"The Daman and Diu Portuguese Creole, also known as Daman and Diu Indo- Portuguese and, to its speakers, as ' (Portuguese for \\"Home language\\"), refers to varieties of Portuguese-based creole spoken in Daman and Diu. Before the Indian annexation of the territory, the Daman creole went through a profound decreolization by Standard Portuguese of Goa, a phenomenon whereby the Indo- Portuguese creole reconverged with Standard Portuguese. Daman Indo- Portuguese The Daman creole is a descendant of the Norteiro creole, spoken originally by the Norteiros on the Coast from Chaul, Ba√ßaim, Bombay, Daman and Diu. The superstrate language is Portuguese. The substrate of the Daman creole is likely to be Konkani. Gujarati has also been suggested as a possible substrate, but this is doubtful since the Gujarati people moved into the region only after the Portuguese arrived. Diu Indo-Portuguese The Diu Indo-Portuguese or Diu Portuguese is spoken in Diu, India. It is a creole language based mainly on Portuguese and Gujarati. It is a member of the larger family of Indo-Portuguese creoles, particularly close to the variety of Daman. There is a considerably vital oral tradition in this language, with songs regularly performed in Diu, elsewhere in India and among Indo-Portuguese communities abroad. Widely spoken in the past, it was first documented in the 19th century by the initiative of Hugo Schuchardt. At present, the language is spoken natively by most of the local Catholics, numbering about 180, but is potentially endangered by the pressure of other languages such as Gujarati, English and standard Portuguese. Number of speakers The Portuguese heritage in Daman is more common and lively than in Goa and this helped to keep the language alive. The language is spoken by an estimated number of 2,000 Damanese. However, the Damanese Portuguese-Indian Association says that there are 10- 12,000 Portuguese speakers in the territory of 110,000 residents. Sunday Mass is celebrated in Portuguese.

Early life Carstares was born at Cathcart, near Glasgow, Scotland, the son of the Rev. John Carstares, a Covenanter. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and then at the University of Utrecht. In the Netherlands he had an introduction to Gaspar Fagel. Through Fagel he met the Prince of Orange, the future King William III of Great Britain, and began to take an active part in politics. During the Third Anglo-Dutch War, Carstares acted as an intelligence agent for the Prince of Orange, making journeys to England as \\"William Williams\\". He corresponded with Pierre du Moulin (died 1676), who ran the Prince's espionage. He was suspected by the English, and arrested by warrant in September 1674 on English soil. 1674 to 1689 Carstares was then committed to the Tower of London; the following year, 1675, he was transferred to Edinburgh Castle. He was believed to be concerned with Sir James Stewart in the authorship of a pamphlet An Account of Scotland's Grievances by reason of the D. of Lauderdale's Ministrie, humbly tendered to his Sacred Majesty (1674). John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale himself got Carstares to admit he had been involved in printing the pamphlet. Lauderdale used the threat of the torture of the boot, which could be employed legally in Scotland; but Carstares was not tortured. In August 1679 he was released, one of the government sops to Scottish opinion after the Battle of Bothwell Bridge. He cannot therefore have been the William Carstares who was the chief prosecution witness at the trial of William Staley (the first of the Popish Plot trials) in November 1678, although that Carstares was also a Scotsman, and like his namesake is said to have acted as an intelligence agent. After this, Carstares visited Ireland, joined nonconformist circles in London, and then in 1681 became pastor to a congregation at Theobalds, near Cheshunt in Hertfordshire. The aftermath of the Exclusion Crisis saw him directly involved in conspiracy with the Whig faction. Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll in the Netherlands was in touch with Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Carstares provided liaison, while his brother-in-law William Dunlop was able to use his colonial project in the Province of Carolina as cover for Shaftesbury's preparations for rebellion. During 1682 Carstares was in the Netherlands, but the following year he was again in London. He was implicated in the Rye House Plot, and arrested in July 1683 at Tenterden, Kent, using an assumed name. He denied knowing any of the plot, though he had heard assassination rumours from Robert Ferguson. He was again threatened with torture in London, this time by Sir George Mackenzie. Once more he was transferred to Edinburgh. In July 1684 the Privy Council of Scotland tortured William Spence, Argyll's agent, and Carstares was implicated. Carstares himself, who had seen poor health in his detention, was tortured in September, with the thumbikins, and then the boot, clumsily applied. The next day John Drummond, Secretary of State in Scotland, made a deal with Carstares that his answers would not be used in court, and had a doctor see him. Carstares then replied to the questions of the Council. He signed a statement, managing to conceal the covert links to Dutch supporters, and the government published it. Later that month he was moved to Stirling Castle. In the trial of Baillie of Jerviswood, Mackenzie as Lord Advocate found a way to use the statement by Carstares to secure a conviction; Baillie was hanged, drawn and quartered in December 1684. Carstares was freed, and went to London, and then to The Hague shortly before the Monmouth Rebellion, as an adviser to the Prince of Orange. Under William III Carstares was court chaplain to William as Prince of Orange, and at the time of the Williamite Revolution sailed with the Prince to Torbay. He continued as royal chaplain for Scotland, once William was king in Great Britain. He was the confidential adviser of the king, especially with regard to Scottish affairs. He advocated that a Presbyterian polity should replace the Scottish bishops, and the immediate events of the Williamite conflicts bore out his opinion in practical terms. His subsequent influence on matters concerning the Kirk, as a courtier, earned him the nickname \\"Cardinal Carstares\\". He also manipulated the Parliament of Scotland, helped by being able to read James Johnston's mail. He was Queenberry's man at court in 1700. Later life On the accession of Queen Anne, Carstares retained his post as royal chaplain, but resided in Edinburgh, having been elected principal of the University of Edinburgh in 1703. He was a reforming administrator, introducing the Dutch professorial system of teaching He was also minister of Greyfriars Kirk, and afterwards of St Giles'. He was four times chosen Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, in 1705, 1708, 1711 and 1715.John Warrick, The Moderators of the Church of Scotland from 1690 to 1740 (1913), p. 158; archive.org. He took an important part in promoting the Union, and was consulted by Harley and other leading Englishmen concerning it. During Anne's reign, the chief object of his policy was to frustrate the measures which were planned by Lord Oxford to strengthen the Episcopalian Jacobites, especially a bill for extending the privileges of the Episcopalians and the bill for replacing in the hands of the old patrons the right of patronage, which by the Revolution Settlement had been vested in the elders and the Protestant heritors. On the accession of George I, Carstares was appointed, with five others, to welcome the new dynasty in the name of the Church of Scotland. He was received graciously, and the office of royal chaplain was again conferred upon him. A few months after he was struck with apoplexy, and died on 28 December 1715. He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The grave lies amongst the large monuments on the outer walls of the original churchyard, towards the south-west, slightly north-west of the Adam mausoleum. Family On 6 June 1682 Carstares married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Kekewich of Trehawk in Cornwall, who died in 1724. They had no children.

It was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. During the nine-day flight, the crew aboard Atlantis operated the twelve experiments that constituted the ATLAS-1 (Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science) cargo. ATLAS-1 obtained a vast array of detailed measurements of atmospheric chemical and physical properties, which contributed significantly to improving our understanding of our climate and atmosphere. In addition, this was the first time an artificial beam of electrons was used to stimulate a man-made auroral discharge.

Run-time type information can apply to simple data types, such as integers and characters, or to generic types. This is a C++ specialization of a more general concept called type introspection. Similar mechanisms are also known in other programming languages, such as Object Pascal (Delphi). In the original C++ design, Bjarne Stroustrup did not include run-time type information, because he thought this mechanism was often misused. Overview In C++, RTTI can be used to do safe typecasts, using the \`dynamic_cast<>\` operator, and to manipulate type information at runtime, using the \`typeid\` operator and \`std::type_info\` class. RTTI is available only for classes that are polymorphic, which means they have at least one virtual method. In practice, this is not a limitation because base classes must have a virtual destructor to allow objects of derived classes to perform proper cleanup if they are deleted from a base pointer. RTTI is optional with some compilers; the programmer can choose at compile time whether to include the functionality. There may be a resource cost to making RTTI available even if a program does not use it. typeid The \`typeid\` keyword is used to determine the class of an object at run time. It returns a reference to \`std::type_info\` object, which exists until the end of the program.C++ standard (ISO/IEC14882) section 5.2.8 [expr.typeid], 18.5.1 [lib.type.info] -- http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall11/CSCI-GA.2110-003/documents/c++2003std.pdf The use of \`typeid\`, in a non-polymorphic context, is often preferred over \`dynamic_cast\` in situations where just the class information is needed, because \`typeid\` is always a constant-time procedure, whereas \`dynamic_cast\` may need to traverse the class derivation lattice of its argument at runtime. Some aspects of the returned object are implementation-defined, such as \`std::type_info::name()\`, and cannot be relied on across compilers to be consistent. Objects of class \`std::bad_typeid\` are thrown when the expression for \`typeid\` is the result of applying the unary * operator on a null pointer. Whether an exception is thrown for other null reference arguments is implementation-dependent. In other words, for the exception to be guaranteed, the expression must take the form \`typeid(*p)\` where \`p\` is any expression resulting in a null pointer. =Example= #include #include class Person { public: virtual ~Person() = default; }; class Employee : public Person {}; int main() { Person person; Employee employee; Person* ptr = &employee; Person& ref = employee; // The string returned by typeid::name is implementation- defined. std::cout << typeid(person).name() << std::endl; // Person (statically known at compile-time). std::cout << typeid(employee).name() << std::endl; // Employee (statically known at compile-time). std::cout << typeid(ptr).name() << std::endl; // Person* (statically known at compile- time). std::cout << typeid(*ptr).name() << std::endl; // Employee (looked up dynamically at run-time // because it is the dereference of a // pointer to a polymorphic class). std::cout << typeid(ref).name() << std::endl; // Employee (references can also be polymorphic) Person* p = nullptr; try { typeid(*p); // Not undefined behavior; throws std::bad_typeid. } catch (...) { } Person& p_ref = *p; // Undefined behavior: dereferencing null typeid(p_ref); // does not meet requirements to throw std::bad_typeid // because the expression for typeid is not the result // of applying the unary * operator. } Output (exact output varies by system and compiler): Person Employee Person* Employee Employee dynamic_cast and Java cast The \`dynamic_cast\` operator in C++ is used for downcasting a reference or pointer to a more specific type in the class hierarchy. Unlike the \`static_cast\`, the target of the \`dynamic_cast\` must be a pointer or reference to class. Unlike \`static_cast\` and C-style typecast (where type check is made during compilation), a type safety check is performed at runtime. If the types are not compatible, an exception will be thrown (when dealing with references) or a null pointer will be returned (when dealing with pointers). A Java typecast behaves similarly; if the object being cast is not actually an instance of the target type, and cannot be converted to one by a language-defined method, an instance of \`java.lang.ClassCastException\` will be thrown.http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html =Example= Suppose some function takes an object of type \`A\` as its argument, and wishes to perform some additional operation if the object passed is an instance of \`B\`, a subclass of \`A\`. This can be accomplished using \`dynamic_cast\` as follows. #include #include #include #include using namespace std; class A { public: // Since RTTI is included in the virtual method table there should be at // least one virtual function. virtual ~A() = default; void MethodSpecificToA() { cout << \\"Method specific for A was invoked\\" << endl; } }; class B: public A { public: void MethodSpecificToB() { cout << \\"Method specific for B was invoked\\" << endl; } }; void MyFunction(A& my_a) { try { // Cast will be successful only for B type objects. B& my_b = dynamic_cast(my_a); my_b.MethodSpecificToB(); } catch (const bad_cast& e) { cerr << \\" Exception \\" << e.what() << \\" thrown.\\" << endl; cerr << \\" Object is not of type B\\" << endl; } } int main() { array, 3> array_of_a; // Array of pointers to base class A. array_of_a[0] = make_unique **(); // Pointer to B object. array_of_a[1] = make_unique **(); // Pointer to B object. array_of_a[2] = make_unique(); // Pointer to A object. for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) MyFunction(*array_of_a[i]); } Console output: Method specific for B was invoked Method specific for B was invoked Exception std::bad_cast thrown. Object is not of type B A similar version of \`MyFunction\` can be written with pointers instead of references: void MyFunction(A* my_a) { B* my_b = dynamic_cast(my_a); if (my_b != nullptr) my_b->methodSpecificToB(); else std::cerr << \\" Object is not B type\\" << std::endl; } See also * Type inference * Type introspection * typeof * Reflection (computer science) * Template (C++) References External links * \`dynamic_cast\` operator at IBM Mac OS X Compilers * \`dynamic_cast\` operator at MSDN Articles with example C++ code C++ Class (computer programming) Data types ","title":"Run-time type information"},{"id":"598917","text":"Francis Andrew \\"Drew\\" Gaffney is an American doctor.

He is qualified for assignment as a Mission Specialist on future Space Shuttle flight crews. Since then he has held a variety of technical assignments in support of the Space Shuttle Program, including flight software testing in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL); launch support activities at the Kennedy Space Center; spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM) in mission control during Space Shuttle missions; Chief of Astronaut Appearances. Gemar has flown three times and has logged over 580 hours in space. He flew on STS-38 (November 15‚Äì20, 1990), STS-48 (September 12‚Äì18, 1991), and STS-62 (March 4‚Äì18, 1994). On his first mission, Gemar served on the five-man crew of STS-38 which launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 15, 1990. During the five- day mission crew members conducted Department of Defense operations. After 80 orbits of the Earth in 117 hours, in the first Shuttle recovery in Florida since 1985, Space Shuttle Atlantis and her crew landed back at the Kennedy Space Center on November 20, 1990. Gemar then served on the five-man crew of STS-48 aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on September 12, 1991. During 81 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS), designed to study the Earth's upper atmosphere on a global scale thus providing scientists with their first complete data set on the upper atmosphere's chemistry, winds and energy inputs, in addition to conducting numerous secondary experiments ranging from growing protein crystals, to studying how fluids and structures react in weightlessness. This five-day mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on September 18, 1991. Mission duration was 128 hours. Gemar's most recent mission was STS-62 aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, which launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on March 4, 1994.

The Stars My Destination is a science fiction novel by American writer Alfred Bester. Set in the 24th or 25th century, which varies between editions of the book, when humans have colonized the Solar System, it tells the story of Gully [Gulliver] Foyle, a teleporter driven by a burning desire for revenge. Its first publication was in book form in June 1956 in the United Kingdom, where it was titled Tiger! Tiger!, named after William Blake's 1794 poem \\"The Tyger\\", the first verse of which is printed as the first page of the novel. The book remains widely known under that title in the markets in which this edition was circulated. It was subsequently serialized in Galaxy magazine in four parts beginning with the October 1956 issue. A working title was Hell's My Destination, and the book was also associated with the name The Burning Spear. Plot At the time when the book is set, \\"jaunting\\"--personal teleportation--has so upset the social and economic balance that the Inner Planets are at war with the Outer Satellites. Gully Foyle of the Presteign-owned merchant spaceship Nomad--an uneducated, unskilled, unambitious man whose life is at a dead end--is marooned in space when the ship is attacked and he alone survives. After six months of his waiting for rescue, a passing spaceship, the Vorga, also owned by the powerful Presteign industrial clan, ignores his signal and abandons him. Foyle is enraged and is transformed into a man consumed by revenge, the first of many transformations. Foyle repairs the ship, but is captured by a cargo cult in the Asteroid Belt which tattoos a hideous mask of a tiger on his face. He manages to escape and is returned to Terra. His attempt to blow up the Vorga fails, and he is captured by Presteign. Unknown to Foyle, the Nomad was carrying \\"PyrE\\", a new material which could make the difference between victory and defeat in the war. Presteign hires Saul Dagenham to interrogate Foyle and find the ship and PyrE. Protected by his own revenge fixation, Foyle cannot be broken, and he is put into a jaunte-proof prison. There he meets Jisbella McQueen, who teaches him to think clearly, and tells him he should find out who gave the order not to rescue him. Together they escape and get his tattoos removed--but not with total success: the subcutaneous scars become visible when Foyle becomes too emotional. They travel to the Nomad, where they recover not only PyrE, but also a fortune in platinum. Jisbella is captured by Dagenham, but Foyle escapes. Some time later, Foyle re-emerges as \\"Geoffrey Fourmyle\\", a nouveau riche dandy. Foyle has rigorously educated himself and had his body altered to become a killing machine. Through yoga he has achieved the emotional self-control necessary to prevent his stigmata from showing. He seeks out Robin Wednesbury, a one-way telepath, whom he had raped earlier in the novel, and persuades her to help him charm his way through high society. Foyle tracks down the crew of the Vorga to learn the identity of the ship's captain, but each is implanted with a death-reflex and dies when questioned. Each time, Foyle is tormented by the appearance of \\"The Burning Man\\", an image of himself on fire. At a society party, Foyle is smitten with Presteign's daughter Olivia. He also meets Jisbella again--now Dagenham's lover--who chooses not to reveal Foyle's identity, although Dagenham has realized it anyway (Foyle's alias was implanted in his subconscious mind during Dagenham's interrogation). During a nuclear attack by the Outer Satellites, Foyle goes to Olivia to save her. She tells him that to have her, he must be as cruel and ruthless as she is. Robin, traumatized by the attacks, tries to buy her way out of her arrangement with Foyle with the name of another Vorga crew member. Foyle agrees, but immediately reneges. In response, Robin goes to Central Intelligence to betray him. Foyle learns that the captain of the Vorga joined a cult on Mars and has had all her sensory nerves disabled, making her immune to conventional torture. Foyle kidnaps a telepath to interrogate the captain, and learns that the ship did not rescue him because it was picking up refugees, taking their belongings, and scuttling them into space. He also learns that Olivia Presteign was the person in charge. Olivia rescues him from Martian commandos, as she sees in Foyle someone who can match her hatred and need to destroy. Driven by a guilty conscience, Foyle tries to give himself up, but is captured by Presteign's lawyer Regis Sheffield, who turns out to be a spy for the Outer Satellites. Sheffield tells Foyle that when the Nomad was attacked, Foyle was taken off the ship, transported 600,000 miles away, and set adrift in a spacesuit to be a decoy to attract ships to be ambushed. Instead, Foyle space-jaunted--teleporting a cosmic distance, very much further than had been previously believed possible--back to the Nomad. Now, the Outer Satellites not only want PyrE, they want Foyle as well, to learn the secret of space-jaunting. Meanwhile, Presteign reveals that PyrE is activated by telepathy, and Robin is enlisted to trigger it to flush out Foyle. Bits of PyrE left exposed by Foyle's tests to determine its purpose cause destruction worldwide, but primarily at Foyle's abandoned encampment in St. Patrick's Cathedral, where Sheffield has brought him. The church partially collapses, killing Sheffield and trapping Foyle, unconscious but alive, over a pit of flame. Suffering from synesthesia brought on by the explosion affecting his neurological implants, Foyle jauntes through space and time as The Burning Man. Finally he lands in the future, where Robin telepathically tells him how to escape from the collapsing cathedral. Back in the present, Foyle is pressured to surrender the rest of the PyrE, which was protected from exploding by its Inert Lead Isotope container, and to teach mankind how to space-jaunte. He leads them to where the rest of the PyrE is hidden, but makes off with it and jauntes across the globe, throwing slugs of PyrE into the crowd at each stop. He asks humanity to choose: either destroy itself or follow him into space. Foyle now realizes the key to space-jaunting is faith: not the certainty of an answer, but the conviction that somewhere an answer exists. He jauntes from one nearby star to another, finding new worlds suitable for colonization, but reachable only if he shares the secret of space-jaunting. He comes to rest back with the cargo cult, where the people see him as a holy man and await his revelation. Background and influences The Stars My Destination anticipated many of the staples of the later cyberpunk movement, for instance the megacorporations as powerful as governments, a dark overall vision of the future and the cybernetic enhancement of the body. Bester added to this mix the concept that human beings could learn to teleport, or \\"jaunte\\" from point to point, provided they know the exact locations of their departure and arrival and have physically seen the destination, similar to A. E. van Vogt's Gilbert Gosseyn in the 1948 novel The World of Null-A. There is one overall absolute limit: no one can jaunte through outer space. (A jaunte of 1,000 miles is the maximum any jaunter is able to achieve, and even that is extremely rare.) On the surface of a planet, the jaunte rules supreme; otherwise, mankind is still restricted to machinery. In this world, telepathy is extremely rare, but does exist. One important character is able to send thoughts but not receive them. There are fewer than half a dozen full telepaths in all the worlds of the solar system. The novel can be seen as a science-fiction adaption of Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo. It is the study of a man completely lacking in imagination or ambition, Gulliver Foyle, who is introduced with \\"He was one hundred and seventy days dying and not yet dead...\\". Foyle is a cipher, a man with potential but no motivation, who is suddenly marooned in space. Even this is not enough to galvanize him beyond trying to find air and food on the wreck. But all changes when an apparent rescue ship deliberately passes him by, stirring him irrevocably out of his passivity. Foyle becomes a monomaniacal and sophisticated monster bent upon revenge. Wearing many masks, learning many skills, this \\"worthless\\" man pursues his goals relentlessly; no price is too high to pay. Like Edmond Dant√®s in The Count of Monte Cristo, Foyle is thrown into prison, the supposedly jaunte-proof \\"Gouffre Martel\\" located in caverns. He establishes a clandestine connection to another prisoner, Jisbella McQueen, and through her he is educated to the point where he can conceive a plan to escape and exact his revenge. Escaping with her and locating the wreck of the Nomad, he uses its treasure, as Dant√®s did, to re- invent himself as Geoffrey Fourmyle. The scenario of the shipwrecked man ignored by passing ships came from a National Geographic Magazine story that Bester had read, about the shipwrecked sailor Poon Lim who had survived four months on a raft in the South Atlantic during World War II, and ships had passed him without picking him up, because their captains were afraid that the raft was a decoy to lure them into torpedo range of German submarines. Bester once wrote that he used playful narration at one point to grab the reader's attention. =Terminology and allusions= The title \\"The Stars My Destination\\" appears in a quatrain quoted by Foyle twice during the book. The first time, while he is trapped in outer space, he states: :Gully Foyle is my name :And Terra is my nation. :Deep space is my dwelling place, :And death's my destination. Toward the end of the book, after he has returned to human life and become something of a hero, he states: :Gully Foyle is my name :And Terra is my nation. :Deep space is my dwelling place, :The stars my destination Both quatrains are based on a poetic form that was popular in England and the United States during the 18th-to-mid-20th centuries, in which a person stated their name, country, city or town, and a religious homily (often, \\"Heaven's my destination\\") within the rhyming four-line structure (see book rhyme). This literary device had been previously used by James Joyce in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Bester may have come across his title expression in the writings of John Whiteside Parsons, one of the fathers of modern rocketry, who was also a science fiction fan and occultist. In 1943, Parsons wrote: \\"Rocketry may not be my True Will, but it's one hell of a powerful drive. With Thelema as my goal and the stars my destination and my home, I have set my eyes on high.\\"Pendle, George. Strange Angel: The Otherworldly Life of Rocket Scientist John Whiteside Parsons (Orlando, Florida: Mariner Book, 2006). p.169. Bester's initial work on the book began in England, and he took the names for his characters from a UK telephone directory. As a result, many of the characters are named after British or Irish towns or other features: Gulliver Foyle (and his pseudonym, Fourmyle of Ceres), Robin Wednesbury, the Presteign clan, Regis Sheffield, Y'ang-Yeovil, Saul Dagenham, Sam Quatt, Rodger Kempsey, the Bo'ness and Uig ship underwriters. Characters * Gulliver (\\"Gully\\") Foyle: Last remaining survivor of a merchant spaceship, the Nomad. Captured by the \\"Scientific People\\" on an asteroid, he is tattooed on his face according to their customs. The tattoos are later removed, but the scars left under his skin become visible when his emotions get out of control. * Presteign: Head of the wealthy Presteign clan, whose interests include a chain of luxury department stores, each managed by an identical \\"Mr. Presto\\". Wealthy people like Presteign demonstrate their status by using outmoded methods of transportation and never jaunting if they can avoid it. Presteign holds court in his Star Chamber, an elaborate old-fashioned office equipped with a bar, and staffed by robots. It is designed to disorient visitors and give him the psychological edge. * Robin Wednesbury: A Telesend, a one-way telepath who can send thoughts but not receive them. Foyle meets her in \\"jaunte rehab\\" while pretending to be someone who has lost the ability to jaunte. She discovers his deception but he kidnaps her and rapes her to intimidate her into silence. Later, as Fourmyle, he recruits her to help him navigate the upper echelons of society. After she discovers who he really is, he offers her the prospect of finding her family, who were refugees on the Vorga. * Jisbella (\\"Jiz\\") McQueen: Serving five years of \\"cure\\" in Gouffre Martel for larceny. She turned to crime in rebellion against the limitations imposed on women to \\"protect\\" them in a world where everyone can teleport. She escapes with Foyle and takes him to a criminal doctor who is able to bleach out his tattoos by applying a chemical with a tattoo needle. The process is agony for Foyle but Jisbella makes him endure it out of disgust for him. * Saul Dagenham: The head of a private \\"special services\\" agency contracted by Presteign to interrogate Gully Foyle and force him to reveal the location of the Nomad. Dagenham was a nuclear scientist who became radioactive in an accident. He cannot remain in a room with other people for more than a short time. The agents of \\"Dagenham Couriers Inc.\\" are a bizarre collection of freaks who specialize in \\"FFCC\\", or \\"Fun, Fantasy, Confusion and Catastrophe\\" to carry out their missions of theft, kidnapping and espionage. * Peter Y'ang-Yeovil: Head of a government Central Intelligence agency based on ancient Chinese principles, who is also trying to find Nomad. He is \\"a member of the dreaded Society of Paper Men, and an adept of the Tsientsin Image Makers\\". Although of Chinese descent and able to speak fluent Mandarin, he does not look Chinese. * Olivia Presteign: Daughter of Presteign. She is an albino who is blind to visible light, but can see in infrared and some radio waves. Like Jisbella, she too is in revolt against her treatment as a woman, and as a genetic anomaly. Her rebellion takes the form of interplanetary smuggling of refugees. It was on one such mission that she ordered her ship, the Vorga, to ignore the distress calls from Nomad. * Regis Sheffield: A high-priced lawyer working for Presteign, he is actually an agent of the Outer Satellites coalition. * \\"Bunny\\", Sheffield's personal secretary. He is apparently Chinese, speaks Mandarin with difficulty, and is said to resemble a frightened rabbit, hence the nickname. Speculative science The novel included some notable early descriptions of proto-science and fictional technology, among them Bester's portrayal of psionics, including the phenomenon of \\"jaunting\\", named after the scientist (Charles Fort Jaunte) who discovered it. Jaunting is the instantaneous teleportation of one's body (and anything one is wearing or carrying). One is able to move up to a thousand miles by just thinking. This suddenly revealed, and near-universal ability, totally disrupts the economic balance between the Inner Planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, and the Moon) and the Outer Satellites (various moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune), eventually leading to a war between the two. Jaunting has other effects on the social fabric of the novel's world, and these are examined in true science-fictional fashion. Women of the upper classes are locked away in jaunte-proof rooms \\"for their protection\\", the treatment of criminals of necessity goes back to the Victorian \\"separate system\\", and freaks and monsters abound. The second significant technology in the novel is the rare substance known as \\"PyrE\\", a weapons technology powerful enough to win an interplanetary war. Bester's description of synesthesia is the first popular account published in the English language. It is also quite accurate. Reception and influence Initially, reviews of The Stars My Destination were mixed. The well-regarded science fiction writer and critic Damon Knight, in In Search of Wonder (1956), wrote of the novel's \\"bad taste, inconsistency, irrationality, and downright factual errors\\", but called the ending of the book \\"grotesquely moving\\". In a profile of Bester for Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature (2005), critic Steven H. Gale cited the novel as a reflection of the author's maturation, addressing as it does \\"the continued evolution of humankind as a species\\", a grander theme than those treated with in his earlier work. Gale declared the novel to be Bester's most stylistically ambitious work, citing the use of disparate fonts to evoke synaesthesia, the progressively intelligent language accorded to the maturing protagonist, and the framing of the narrative between the variations on Blake's quatrain. The book has received high praise from several science fiction writers. After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed The Stars My Destination as among stories \\"that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical\\". By 1987, when the author died, \\"It was apparent that the 1980s genre owed an enormous debt to Bester‚Äîand to this book in particular,\\" Neil Gaiman wrote in the introduction to a 1999 edition of the book. \\"The Stars My Destination is, after all, the perfect cyberpunk novel: it contains such cheerfully protocyber elements as multinational corporate intrigue; a dangerous, mysterious, hyperscientific MacGuffin (PyrE); an amoral hero; a supercool thief-woman ...\\" James Lovegrove called it \\"the very best of Bester\\", and Thomas M. Disch identified it as \\"one of the great sf novels of the 1950s\\". \\"Our field has produced only a few works of actual genius, and this is one of them,\\" wrote Joe Haldeman. who added that he reads the novel \\"every two or three years and it still evokes a sense of wonder.\\" According to Samuel R. Delany, the book is \\"considered by many to be the greatest single SF novel\\". while Robert Silverberg wrote that it is \\"on everybody's list of the ten greatest SF novels\\". Fantasy writer Michael Moorcock praised it as \\"a wonderful adventure story\\" that embodies truly libertarian principles.Moorcock, Michael. \\"Starship Stormtroopers \\". Cienfuegos Press Anarchist Review, 1978. Ty Franck, co-author of The Expanse series, said \\"I don't remember any of the other stories in [A Treasury of Great Science Fiction, Volume Two; an anthology of science fiction stories], and I read that book a dozen times. The only story that sticks out in my mind is The Stars My Destination.\\" In a 2011 survey asking leading science fiction writers to name their favourite work of the genre, The Stars My Destination was the choice of William Gibson and Moorcock. Gibson remarked that the book was \\"perfectly surefooted, elegantly pulpy\\", and \\"dizzying in its pace and sweep\\", and a \\"talisman\\" for him in undertaking his first novel. Moorcock hailed Bester's novel as a reminder of \\"why the best science fiction still contains, as in Ballard, vivid imagery and powerful prose coupled to a strong moral vision\\". In 2012, the novel was included in the Library of America two- volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe. Adaptations Howard Chaykin and Byron Preiss created a graphic adaptation the first half of which was published in 1979 by Baronet Publishing and the complete version - delayed due to Baronet's bankruptcy after releasing the original version - by Marvel Entertainment's Epic imprint in 1992.'The Complete Alfred Bester's The Stars My Destination' by Howard Chaykin and Byron Preiss A dramatisation titled Tiger! Tiger! was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on September 14, 1991 and repeated on August 16, 1993. It was scripted by Ivan Benbrook and directed by Andy Jordan. Alun Armstrong played Gully Foyle, Miranda Richardson was Olivia, Siobhan Redmond was Robin Wednesbury and Lesley Manville was Jisbella McQueen. A 2004 anime series, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, was originally intended as an adaptation of The Stars My Destination, the copyright holders' refusal to allow an adaptation led the director, Mahiro Maeda, to instead use The Count of Monte Cristo, which had inspired Bester's story. Various film adaptations of the book have been scripted but none has yet made it to the screen.\\"Destination: Development Hell: How Alfred Bester's 'The Stars My Destination' Took a Jaunt to Hollywood\\" in David Hughes, The Greatest Sci-Fi Movies Never Made.

Before becoming an astronaut, Gibson graduated from the University of Rochester and the California Institute of Technology. He became a research assistant in jet propulsion while completing his studies, and eventually became a research scientist for Philco Corporation until joining NASA in 1965. Gibson is the last surviving crew member of Skylab 4. Gibson was selected as part of NASA Astronaut Group 4, the first group of scientist-astronauts. He served on the support crew of Apollo 12, the second Moon landing mission, before working on the development of the Skylab space station. In 1973‚Äì74, Gibson made his only flight into space as science pilot aboard Skylab 4, the third and final crewed flight to Skylab. He, along with Commander Gerald Carr and Pilot William Pogue, spent just over 84 days in space. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974, but returned in 1977 to preside over the selection of scientist-astronaut candidates. Gibson retired from NASA for the last time in October, 1982. Early life and education Gibson was born in Buffalo, New York, on November 8, 1936. From ages 2 to 8, Gibson battled osteomyelitissoft spots in bonesand spent many months in and out of hospitals. Newly-available penicillin cured the disease. To strengthen his leg that was nearly amputated, Gibson took up sports: swimming, football, and track. He primarily used swimming to strengthen his leg. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America. He earned the rank of First Class.Edward G. Gibson at scouting.org He graduated from Kenmore Senior High School in Kenmore, New York, in 1955, and earned a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the University of Rochester in June 1959. At the University of Rochester, Gibson became a member of the Theta Chi fraternity. He received a Master of Science degree in engineering (jet propulsion option) from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in June 1960 and a Ph.D. in engineering with a minor in physics from Caltech in June 1964. Early career While studying at Caltech, Gibson was a research assistant in the field of jet propulsion and classical physics. His technical publications are in the fields of plasma physics and solar physics. He was senior research scientist with the Applied Research Laboratories of the Philco Corporation at Newport Beach, California, from June 1964 until moving to NASA. While at Philco, he did research in lasers and the optical breakdown of gases. Gibson has logged more than 4,300 hours flying time‚Äî2,270 hours in jet aircraft. NASA career Gibson's spacewalk during his time on Skylab 4 Gibson was selected as a scientist-astronaut by NASA in June 1965. He completed a 53-week course in flight training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and earned his Air Force wings. Since then, he has flown helicopters and the T-38. He served as a member of the astronaut support crew and as a CAPCOM for the Apollo 12 lunar landing, becoming the first from the scientist-astronaut group to get a crew assignment of any kind. He also participated in the design and testing of many elements of the Skylab space station. As part of his preparation for the Skylab program, Gibson studied solar physics, ultimately writing an introductory monograph/textbook on solar astrophysics The Quiet Sun, apart from 1973 English edition published in the United States there was 1977 Russian edition of this book, published in the Soviet Union by Mir Publishers. =Skylab 4= Gibson at the Apollo Telescope Mount console in the Skylab Multiple Docking Adapter Gibson was the science pilot of Skylab 4. The third and final crewed visit to the Skylab space station, it launched November 16, 1973, and concluded February 8, 1974. This was the longest crewed flight (84 days 1 hour 15 minutes) in the history of crewed space exploration at that time. Gibson was accompanied on the record- setting 34.5-million-mile flight by Commander Gerald P. Carr and Pilot William R. Pogue. They successfully completed 56 experiments, 26 science demonstrations, 15 subsystem detailed objectives, and 13 student investigations during their 1,214 revolutions of the Earth. They also acquired a wide variety of earth resources observations data using Skylab's earth resources experiment package camera and sensor array. Dr. Gibson was the crewman primarily responsible for the 338 hours of Apollo Telescope Mount operation, which made extensive observations of solar processes.\\"NASA's Scientist-Astronauts,\\" David Shayler and Colin Burgess Until the Soviet Union's Soyuz 26 broke the record in March 1978, Gibson and his Skylab 4 teammates held the world record for individual time in space: 2,017 hours 15 minutes 32 seconds. Gibson logged 15 hours and 22 minutes in three EVAs outside the Skylab Orbital Workshop. Gibson resigned from NASA in December 1974 to do research on Skylab solar physics data as a senior staff scientist with the Aerospace Corporation of Los Angeles, California. Beginning in March 1976, he served for one year as a consultant to ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, in West Germany, on Spacelab design under the sponsorship of a U.S. Senior Scientist Award form the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. In March 1977, Gibson returned to the Astronaut Office astronaut candidate selection and training as Chief of the Scientist-Astronaut Candidates. During his second tenure at NASA, Gibson had hoped to fly on another space station mission due to his experience on Skylab, but at the same time was not keen on flying a Space Shuttle mission. He served as CAPCOM for STS-1. Gibson ultimately decided to retire from NASA again on October 31, 1982 and began working for TRW. Post-NASA activities In October 1990, Gibson began his own consulting firm, Gibson International Corp. The firm provides consulting services on program management, market development and space infrastructure design and operations. He has performed a significant amount of speaking and writing, having published a text book in solar physics, two novels (Reach and In the Wrong Hands ), and edited The Greatest Adventure, a compilation of stories and pictures on space missions from many astronauts and cosmonauts around the world.

Glassjaw has been rumored to discourage the purchasing of this album due to their acrimonious split from Roadrunner Records. Instead, they encourage people to download their music via file sharing software, such as Limewire. Robinson claimed that the label showed no interest in the band until he pushed to have them signed and showed little interest after. A remastered version of the album was released on March 24, 2009 with two bonus tracks: \\"Convectuoso\\" and a cover of Youth of Today's \\"Modern Love Story\\". Background and recording Glassjaw originally formed in 1993 after vocalist Daryl Palumbo and guitarist Justin Beck met each other working for a summer camp. Throughout the next few years, the group issued various demo tapes and EPs and experienced many line up changes. Their line up would eventually stabilize by 1999, featuring bassist Manuel Carrero, guitarist Todd Weinstock, and drummer Sammy Siegler. With this line up, the group booked a recording session with local producer Don Fury, and the demo recording that resulted from it would eventually be heard by producer Ross Robinson. Robinson, impressed by the material, would then show up to a rehearsal, after which he offered them studio time at Indigo Ranch and convinced Roadrunner Records to sign the group. Recording sessions for the album lasted for about two months total. While all material for the album was written by the band before production began, Robinson did influence arrangements of the tracks \\"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\\" and the album's title track. Content The album has been noted for its overall angry and negative tone in terms of lyrics. The title track was written about Crohn's disease, an intestinal disorder that Palumbo was diagnosed with in 1996. Many songs on the record were written concerning bad relationships, and some accused the band of misogyny due to the violent nature of the lyrics. The band have made statements condemning the lyrics. Track listing All lyrics written by Daryl Palumbo. All music written by Glassjaw, except \\"Lovebites and Razorblades\\", \\"Hurting and Shoving (She Should Have Let Me Sleep)\\" and \\"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence\\", written by Glassjaw and Ross Robinson. Reception Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence has received generally favorable reviews. Absolute Punk reviewer namel praised the songs \\"Pretty Lush\\" and \\"Piano\\", but said some of the album's songs have cringe-worthy lyrics and criticized the track \\"Babe\\". In a retrospective review of the album, Metal Sucks reviewer Mike Gitter was highly positive of the album. Gitter stated \\"Glassjaw laid down the bitchslap in-extremis\\" and regarded the album as a landmark. NME compared the album to \\"Jeff Buckley doused in napalm, crawling through a room full of broken glass.\\" Personnel *Daryl Palumbo - Vocals *Justin Beck - Guitar *Manuel Carrero - Bass guitar *Todd Weinstock - Guitar *Sammy Siegler - Drums *Ross Robinson - Production, mixing *Steve Evetts - Mixing *Chuck Johnson - Engineering *Ted Jensen - Mastering *Kaz Kiriya - Band photography *Paul Brown - Image photography References Glassjaw albums 2000 debut albums Roadrunner Records albums Albums produced by Ross Robinson Nu metal albums by American artists ","title":"Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence"},{"id":"598948","text":"George Patrick John Rushworth Jellicoe, 2nd Earl Jellicoe, Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, (4 April 1918 ‚Äì 22 February 2007) was a British politician, diplomat and businessman.

Much of his childhood was spent at St Lawrence Hall, near Ventnor on the Isle of Wight; at St Peter's Court, a prep school at Broadstairs, Kent; in London; and in the Dominion of New Zealand, where his father was viceroy with the title of Governor-General between 1921 and 1924. He was educated at Winchester College, where he was styled and known as Viscount Brocas. He won the Vere Herbert Smith history prize and secured an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge (matriculated 1936. BA, Modern History tripos 1939, but awarded 1966). He was chairman of the Pitt Club, and his tutor Steven Runciman became a lifelong friend. Second World War In October 1939, the young Jellicoe was a cadet in the first wartime intake at the RMC, Sandhurst.Windmill, Lorna Almonds.

He was commissioned into the Coldstream Guards on 23 March 1940, before joining No. 8 (Guards) Commando, with whom on 31 January 1941 he sailed to the Middle East with Colonel Bob Laycock's Layforce (whose commando officers included Evelyn Waugh, Randolph Churchill, Philip Dunne, Carol Mather, David Stirling, and many distinguished others). He served with L Detachment (from April 1942) (with some of the above and Stephen Hastings), which was the nucleus of the Special Air Service. He was mentioned in despatches thrice, and wounded (bullet in shoulder) once whilst with the 3rd Battalion, Coldstream Guards, in 22 (Guards) Brigade in the Western Desert in January 1941. He won the DSO in November 1942 for operating on a raid that claimed to have blown up more than 20 German aircraft (Ju 88s) on Heraklion airfield, Crete, that June: > His cool and resolute leadership, skill and courage throughout this very > hazardous operation were mainly responsible for the high measure of success > achieved. He ... placed charges on the enemy aircraft and brought off the > survivors after the four Free French members of the party had been betrayed > and killed or captured.London Gazette, 5 November 1942, quoted from L. > Almonds Windmill, page 49 In September 1943, Jellicoe was sent to the Italian-held island of Rhodes to negotiate with the Italian Admiral Inigo Campioni for the surrender of his forces to the Allies. However, negotiations were pre-empted by a surprise German attack on the island on 9 September. He was able to escape from Rhodes during the resulting chaos while the Italian garrison was captured by the German invasion force. This was part of the Dodecanese Campaign. In 1943, he was named Commander of the Special Boat Regiment, Middle East, and he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. He was eventually promoted to brigadier.Churchill's secret warriors. Damien Lewis 2014. For the remainder of the war, his SBS command conducted secretive and dangerous operations along the coasts of Italy and Yugoslavia. In 1944, he won the MC for one of these actions. At the end of the war, Jellicoe was among the first Allied soldiers to enter German-occupied Athens, beating the communist-controlled guerrillas ELAS, to create a pro-Allied presence in the capital. Years later, when First Lord of the Admiralty, Jellicoe told at least one reporter, \\"The only serious military distinction I ever achieved was having a new type of assault boat named after me. It was called I am ashamed to say, the Jellicoe Inflatable Intruder Mark One.\\" In March 1944, Lord Jellicoe married Patricia Christine O'Kane (October 1917 ‚Äì March 2012), who was employed at the British Embassy in Beirut. She had been born and raised in Shanghai and was the daughter of a Greenock-born Irish father and an English mother. Patricia, Countess Jellicoe (popularly known as Patsy Jellicoe), would remain married to Lord Jellicoe until 1966, when they divorced. They had two sons and two daughters together, the eldest son being the 3rd Earl Jellicoe. HM Foreign Service 1947‚Äì1958 Soon after the war Lord Jellicoe joined His Majesty's Foreign Service, (appointed a Foreign Service Officer, Grade 8 in the Senior Branch of the Foreign Service, 10 September 1947). He served in London (German political department, Third Secretary); Washington (Third Secretary, when Donald Maclean of the Cambridge five was Head of Chancery, and then as one of the 11 Second Secretaries with H. A. R. Philby, seeing NATO signed on 4 April 1949, all when Sir Oliver Franks was Ambassador); transferred to Brussels 10 September 1951 (Head of Chancery) acted as Charg√© d'Affaires in 1952); London (no. 2 in Northern department in charge of the Soviet Desk from September 1953); and Baghdad from January 1956 (First Secretary and Deputy Secretary General of the Baghdad Pact Organisation). The Suez Crisis (from July 1956) wrecked everything the Pact was trying to achieve; Jellicoe was appalled by British policy and came close to resigning (L. Windmill p. 136). Jellicoe eventually left the Foreign Office in March 1958, after marital difficulties had caused an impasse (February 1958, Permanent Secretary Sir Derek Hoyar-Millar wrote; 'You have a choice of ceasing your relationship with this lady [Philippa Dunne] or changing your job'). He became a director of the Cayzer dynasty's Clan Line Steamers (cargo ships), and Union Castle Steamship Co. (passengers). However, enthusiasm for his mother's family's businesses ultimately gave way to the call of the Palace of Westminster, where, back from Iraq, he took the Oath in the Lords on 3 December 1957, in the Third Session of the 41st Parliament. House of Lords and 1960s Jellicoe during a skiing holiday. Jellicoe skiing in France. Having first sat in parliament on 25 July 1939, Jellicoe waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech in the House of Lords during a debate entitled \\"The International Situation: The Middle East\\". He spoke from the Cross-Benches about the Baghdad Pact and Iraq: By October 1958 he had joined the Conservatives, in the Lords a natural home for such a distinctly pinkPiers Dixon in Philip Ziegler & Desmond Seward (eds): Brooks's: A Social History, 1991. Whig, who gave him the honour of moving \\"an humble Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech\\" On 7 May 1959, he asked a prescient starred question on the planning of motorways: On 20 July 1959 he initiated a debate on Western aid for uncommitted countries, and by January 1961 he was a Lord-in-waiting to H.M. the Queen, a Government Whip, in Macmillan's administration. He was Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Local Government June 1961 ‚Äì July 1962; Minister of State, Home Office July 1962 ‚Äì October 1963; First Lord of the Admiralty October 1963 ‚Äì April 1964; Minister of Defence for the Royal Navy April‚ÄìOctober 1964; delegate to the Council of Europe and the Western European Union (WEU) 1965‚Äì1967; president of the National Federation of Housing Societies 1965‚Äì1970; a governor of the Centre for Environmental Studies 1967‚Äì1970; chairman of the British Advisory Committee on Oil Pollution at Sea 1968; chairman of the third International Conference on oil pollution of the sea 1968; an hon. vice-president of PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism); and deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Lords 1967‚Äì1970. From April 1967 Lords Jellicoe and Carrington represented the Conservatives in the Lords on the Inter-Party conference group on Lords' reform, which came up with the unsuccessful Parliament (No.2) Bill (1968‚Äì1969). Leading the debate for the (Conservative) Opposition in November 1968 Jellicoe said: During the late 1960s he worked in the City of London where he became chairman of British Reserve Insurance and a director of S G Warburg (Finance and Development) Ltd. Cabinet minister and resignation In Ted Heath's administration he was Minister in charge for the Civil Service Department (CSD), Lord Privy Seal (as such he was eighth on the Roll of The Lords) and Leader of the House of Lords from 20 June 1970 until 24 May 1973. Having earlier re-established relations with the miners' union leaders in February 1972, Heath appointed Jellicoe \\"energy supremo\\" to restore power supplies around the time of the Three-Day Week and had him set up and chair a Civil Contingencies Unit, which was, when an internal crisis arose, to operate through \\"COBRA\\" (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms). In June 1972 Jellicoe was sent to lead Concorde's first sales expedition. As Alan Trengove in My Lord, the super salesman, in the Australian The Sun of 22 June 1972 put it, Trengove considered Sir George Edwards and Sir Geoffrey Tuttle \\"equally impressive members of the sales team\\". (Supersonic flights were on the prototype Concorde G-BSST, certificate signed by Brian Trubshaw, and dated 15 June 1972). Jellicoe, with the help of his very experienced Chief Whip, the second Earl St. Aldwyn, steered the European Communities Act (1972) through the Lords, allowing no amendments. The Industrial Relations Act was another legislative highlight. In May 1973 Jellicoe admitted \\"some casual affairs\\" with call girls (from Mayfair Escorts) in the wake of an accidental confusion with Lord Lambton's prostitution scandal. His name seems to have emerged as a result of a connection between Lambton, the madame Norma Levy, and a tenement house or community hall in Somers Town in the London district of St. Pancras called Jellicoe Hall or House, after Basil Jellicoe (1899‚Äì1935) the housing reformer and priest. The word Jellicoe was seen in Levy's notebook, and a connection was assumed to the Minister rather than the building; a structure named after the earl's distant cousin, and one that may have been opened by the Admiral himself in June 1928. The resignation ended Jellicoe's third career in government service. After the resignation (over his marginal involvement in a minor indiscretion) Richard Crossman, writing in The Times, 30 May 1973 (page 18), described Jellicoe as: On return from the Whitsun recess, tributes were paid in the Lords to their departed leader: the (Labour Party) Opposition leader and Jellicoe's predecessor as Lord Privy Seal, Lord Shackleton said: Lord Byers for the Liberal Party added: \\"we regret bitterly his resignation ... He was a reforming innovator and the House owes a great deal more than it probably knows to the interest he took in this House and to his initiatives.\\" (Hansard, 5 June 1973) From the cross-benches Lord Strang added: William Kendall, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association said: In July 1973 the Diplock Commission, which had been set up to look into the security implications of Lambton and Jellicoe's adventures, concluded its section on Jellicoe (paragraph 24): Business and post-government public career With no estates to distract him, Jellicoe was free to re-join S. G. Warburg & Co. (1 October 1973), and with the help of Alan Lennox-Boyd, who was soon to retire from the board, he became a non-executive director of the sugar company Tate & Lyle in 1973, a position held until 1993. Thanks in the main to Sir Saxon Tate, and presumably because he had succeeded as chairman (until June 1978) of their subsidiary Tunnel Refineries, the family made him Tate & Lyle's first non-family chairman 1978‚Äì1983. Having revived and retrenched Tate & Lyle, Jellicoe became chairman of Booker Tate, 1988‚Äì91. Other non-governmental jobs included: chairman of engineering plant company the Davy Corporation (Davy McKee) (now subsumed into Aker Kv√¶rner) 1985‚Äì1990; director Sotheby's Holdings 1973‚Äì1993; Morgan Crucible 1974‚Äì88; Smiths Industries Ltd 1973‚Äì1986; S. G. Warburg & Co 1964‚Äì1970, 1973‚Äì1988. He was president of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry 1979‚Äì1982. He succeeded Lord Limerick as chairman of the Department of Trade and Industry's British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB) 1983‚Äì1986, for which he was knighted. That was followed by chairmanship (1986‚Äì1990) and then the presidency (1990‚Äì1995) of the East European Trade Council (EETC). He was chairman of the Greek Fund Ltd 1988‚Äì1994 (Schroders) and of European Capital Ltd 1991‚Äì1995. Lord Jellicoe was chairman of the council of King's College London (KCL) 1974‚Äì1983; chairman of the Medical Research Council (MRC) 1982‚Äì1990; a trustee of the National Aids Trust (alongside the likes of Lord Goodman, David Puttnam and Robert Maxwell); president of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) (and of the Institute of British Geographers (IBG) after amalgamation) 1993‚Äì1997; president of the Anglo-Hellenic League 1978‚Äì1986; president of the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust 1987‚Äì1994; president of the UK Crete Veterans Association 1991‚Äì2001; president of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) 1992‚Äì1995; chancellor of Southampton University 1984‚Äì1995, and has been closely associated with research and higher education. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1990. In 1995 he helped found Hakluyt & Company, a strategic intelligence and advisory firm, for which he was a director 1996‚Äì2000. He was president of the SAS Regimental Association 1996‚Äì2000, when he became its patron. Jellicoe was a member of the Onassis International Prizes Committee (1983‚Äì1992); a vice-president of The European-Atlantic Group and of the Byron Society; he was on the board of the Hellenic College London; patron of the City of Southampton Society; a patron of the Greek Archaeological Committee (UK); one of five patrons of The Community Foundation for Wiltshire and Swindon; a director of The Landscape Foundation (now dormant); patron of Friends of The Royal Hospital School; patron of the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology; a member of the World Innovation Fund (WIF) and an associate member of INEED. In 2002 he became a patron of The Second World War Experience Centre in Leeds. Later state contributions He was chairman of the Lords' Select Committee on Committees (1990‚Äì1993) and President of the Parliamentary and Scientific Committee (1980‚Äì1983). In 1983 he was author of the Jellicoe Report which reviewed the operation of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976. The Times saw this appointment as the end of nine years penance in the political wilderness. Between 1963 and 1973 Jellicoe had averaged 90 House of Lords daily attendances per parliamentary session. From 1973 to 1989 his attendance fell to an average of nine appearances per session. However, between 1990 and 2001 he made an average of 72 visits per session. He maintained this rate until early 2006, though his last full speech in the Lords was made as part of the Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech (the Queen's Speech debate) on 28 October 1996; his subject was Ukraine. When the House of Lords Act 1999 removed his hereditary automatic entitlement to attend and sit in the House of Lords, he was created a life peer as Baron Jellicoe of Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, so that he could continue to be summoned: > 1\\\\. Earl Jellicoe (Lord Jellicoe of Southampton) ‚ÄîThe Rt Hon. George Patrick > John Rushworth Earl Jellicoe, having been created Baron Jellicoe of > Southampton, of Southampton in the County of Hampshire, for life by Letters > Patent dated 6 o'clock in the forenoon of 17th November 1999, took and > subscribed the oath pursuant to statute. Lord Jellicoe remained an active member of the House of Lords for the rest of his life. At his death in 2007, Lord Jellicoe was the longest-serving member of the House of Lords, and arguably the longest-serving parliamentarian in the world, having succeeded his father on 20 November 1935 and come of age and sat first in parliament on 25 July 1939. Because he waited until 28 July 1958 to make his maiden speech, a few peers (viz. Earl Ferrers and Lords Renton, Carrington, Healey, and Strabolgi) could have been considered to have been active parliamentarians longer. Moreover, at the time of his death, on the Privy Council only the Duke of Edinburgh (1951) and Lords Carrington (1959), Deedes and Renton (both 1962) had served longer. Character In May 1973, at the time of his resignation from the government, friends are quoted as saying: In July 1970, as one of the first people to be breathalized, he was banned from driving for a year and fined 75 pounds with 20 guineas costs for having consumed more than the permitted level of alcohol in Old Brompton Road at 4 a.m. on 21 March 1970. Luck saw to it that the case came after the General Election and the ban coincided with the arrival of his right to a full-time government car. In 2000, his friend, the former British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Nicholas Henderson, wrote: Lorna Windmill's biography termed Jellicoe a \\"British Achilles\\" on account of two of his careers derailing as a result of women: in the 1950s for love, and in the 1970s for escorts.  Personal life  Lord Jellicoe married firstly, 23 March 1944, Patricia O'Kane (1917‚Äì2012), by whom he had two sons and two daughters. He married secondly, in 1966, Philippa, daughter of Captain Philip Dunne (1904‚Äì1965), by whom he had one son and two daughters. He had eight children in total, born between 1944 and 1984. He was a member of Brooks's (since 1940), the Special Forces Club, the Ski Club of Great Britain and was a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Mercers. He died on 22 February 2007, six weeks before his 89th birthday, at Tidcombe Manor, his house in Wiltshire.

Originally the overall process was called tapeout as historically early ICs used graphical black crepe tape on mylar media for photo imaging (erroneously believed to reference magnetic data‚Äîthe photo process greatly predated magnetic media). When using a standard process‚Äîwhere the interaction of the many chemical, thermal, and photographic variables is known and carefully controlled‚Äîthe behaviour of the final integrated circuit depends largely on the positions and interconnections of the geometric shapes. Using a computer-aided layout tool, the layout engineer‚Äîor layout technician‚Äîplaces and connects all of the components that make up the chip such that they meet certain criteria‚Äîtypically: performance, size, density, and manufacturability. This practice is often subdivided between two primary layout disciplines: Analog and digital. The generated layout must pass a series of checks in a process known as physical verification. The most common checks in this verification process areA. Kahng, J. Lienig, I. Markov, J. Hu: VLSI Physical Design: From Graph Partitioning to Timing Closure, , , p. 10. * design rule checking (DRC), * layout versus schematic (LVS), * parasitic extraction, * antenna rule checking, and * electrical rule checking (ERC). When all verification is complete, layout post processing is applied where the data is also translated into an industry- standard format, typically GDSII, and sent to a semiconductor foundry. The milestone completion of the layout process of sending this data to the foundry is now colloquially called \\"tapeout\\". The foundry converts the data into mask data and uses it to generate the photomasks used in a photolithographic process of semiconductor device fabrication. In the earlier, simpler, days of IC design, layout was done by hand using opaque tapes and films, an evolution derived from early days of printed circuit board (PCB) design -- tape-out. Modern IC layout is done with the aid of IC layout editor software, mostly automatically using EDA tools, including place and route tools or schematic- driven layout tools. Typically this involves a library of standard cells. The manual operation of choosing and positioning the geometric shapes is informally known as \\"polygon pushing\\".

He has served as a chief verification pilot for STS-3 and STS-4 entry guidance, navigation and control simulation testing; as the Deputy Manager for Operations Integration, Space Shuttle Program Office; and subsequently as the Chief of Training within the Astronaut Office. A veteran of four space flights, Grabe served as Pilot on STS-51-J (October 3‚Äì7, 1985) and STS-30 (May 4‚Äì8, 1989), and was the mission commander on STS-42 (January 22‚Äì30, 1992) and STS-57 (June 21 to July 1, 1993). Grabe has logged over 627 hours in space. Effective April 11, 1994, Grabe left NASA and the Air Force to join Orbital Sciences Corporation, Dulles, Virginia. Space flight experience STS-51-J, the second Space Shuttle Department of Defense mission, launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on October 3, 1985. This was the maiden voyage of the Atlantis, the final Orbiter in the Shuttle fleet. After 98 hours of orbital operations, Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on October 7, 1985. Mission duration was 97 hours, 14 minutes, 38 seconds. STS-30 Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on May 4, 1989. During the four-day mission, the crew successfully deployed the Magellan Venus-exploration spacecraft, the first U.S. planetary science mission launched since 1978, and the first planetary probe to be deployed from the Shuttle. Magellan arrived at Venus in mid-1990, and mapped over 95% of the surface of Venus. Magellan has been one of NASA's most successful scientific missions and continues to operate today gaining information about the Venetian atmosphere and magnetic field. In addition, crew members also worked on secondary payloads involving fluid research in general, chemistry, and electrical storm studies. Following 64 orbits of the Earth, the STS-30 mission concluded with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 8, 1989. Mission duration was 96 hours, 57 minutes, 35 seconds. STS-42 Discovery launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on January 22, 1992. Fifty- five major experiments conducted in the International Microgravity Laboratory-1 module were provided by investigators from eleven countries, and represented a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines. During 128 orbits of the Earth, the seven-person crew accomplished the mission's primary objective of investigating the effects of microgravity on materials processing and life sciences. In this unique laboratory in space, the crew worked around-the-clock in two shifts. Experiments investigated the microgravity effects on the growth of protein and semiconductor crystals. Biological experiments on the effects of zero gravity on plants, tissues, bacteria, insects and human vestibular response were also conducted. This eight-day mission culminated in a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on January 30, 1992. Mission duration was 193 hours, 14 minutes, 45 seconds. STS-57 Endeavour launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on June 21, 1993. The primary mission of this flight was the retrieval of the European Retrievable Carrier satellite (EURECA). Additionally, STS-57 featured the first flight of the Spacehab, a commercially provided middeck augmentation module for the conduct of microgravity experiments. Spacehab carried 22 individual flight experiments in materials processing and human factors. A spacewalk was conducted on this flight as part of an ongoing program to evaluate extravehicular activity (EVA) techniques for future missions. The Space Shuttle Endeavour landed at the Kennedy Space Center on July 1, 1993, after 10 days on orbit. Mission duration was 239 hours, 45 minutes. He is married to the former Lynn O'Keefe of Ottawa, Canada. Ron has two daughters and he and Lynn have a son. Recreational interests include skiing, wind surfing, and racquet sports.

Chokers can be made of a variety of materials, including velvet, plastic, beads, latex, leather, metal, such as silver, gold or platinum, etc. They can be adorned in a variety of ways, including with sequins, studs, or a pendant. American silk and metal choker from the 1870s Queen Alexandra History Golden choker necklaces were crafted by Sumerian artisans around 2500 BC and according to curators from the Jewelry Museum of Fine Arts, chokers have been around for thousands of years, first gracing the world's earliest civilizations: Ancient Egypt, in addition to the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Often made with gold or lapis, the necklaces were thought to be protective and imbued with special powers. Chokers were also later worn in the First Century A.D. They are mentioned in the Talmud, book Shabbat, chapter 6Shabbos, beginning of chapter 6 as a common women's accessory. Historically, it was associated with high fashion, but could take on different meanings under different circumstances. In 1798, during the French Revolution, women wore red ribbons around their necks to pay homage to those who met their death at the guillotine. The ribbon could be worn around the neck, or another fashion came in the form of an X around the shoulders and back. Ballerinas and the upper class in the late 19th century commonly wore certain types of chokers. However, at that same time, in the late 19th century, a plain, thin, red, or black ribbon choker had ties to prostitution, as seen in Manet's Olympia (1861). The 19th century fashion for broad chokers reached its peak around 1900 in part due to Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom wearing one to hide a small scar. Chokers were popular into the 1920s and again in the '40s as colliers de chien. In particular, the term dog collars or colliers de chien caught on, and these designs ‚Äì incorporating luxe diamonds, pearls, lace, and velvet ‚Äì could be seen as objects of the elite because the best kinds were custom-made to fit one's neck perfectly. In 1944 Life magazine stated that \\"a dowager fashion of 40 years ago\\" was being revived by young women, illustrating the trend with photos of models wearing the now vaguely rebellious \\"dog collars\\". Princess Maria Annunciata of Bourbon-Two Sicilies Modern fashion In recent years, chokers have been popular with a number of celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow who wore one to the 1999 Academy Awards. Paris Hilton wore three inches of Swarovski around her neck in 2002. Rihanna has also been featured wearing chokers. In the 2010s, the choker became a popular fashion symbol among transgender women, due not only to its association with femininity, but also because of its potential to hide the Adam's apple without performing a tracheal shave.

The pianist hired for the studio-recorded album, More of Tom Lehrer, fell off his bench when he heard the title. =\\"Bright College Days\\"= This song borrows heavily from \\"The Whiffenpoof Song\\", the traditional signature song of the Yale Whiffenpoofs. =\\"The Elements\\"= The lyrics of \\"The Elements\\" (Flash animation) are a recitation of the names of all the chemical elements that were known at the time of writing, up to number 102, nobelium. It can be found on his albums Songs & More Songs by Tom Lehrer as well as An Evening Wasted with Tom Lehrer. The song is sung to the tune of Sir Arthur Sullivan's \\"Major General's Song\\" (\\"I am the very model of a modern major-general...\\") from The Pirates of Penzance. Since that time, 16 more have been discovered. At his concert in Copenhagen (1967), Lehrer admitted, \\"I like to play this song every once in a while, just to see if I can still do it!\\" Indeed, several of Lehrer's fans, such as actor Daniel Radcliffe, have tried and failed to sing it. That is, he sung it in its entirety, but with slight hiccups., broadcast November 12, 2010 At some concerts he also played a version he claims is based on Aristotle's elements: \\"There's earth and air and fire and water.\\", clip from a live performance in 1967 =\\"Oedipus Rex\\"= Lehrer comments that most popular movies of the time have a catchy title song that helps to draw in audiences. Believing that a recent (1957) film adaptation of Sophocles' play Oedipus Rex had failed at the box office because it did not have such a song, he wrote this one in ragtime style. =\\"Clementine\\"= \\"Clementine\\" is a parody of the old folk song \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\\" as it might have turned out had it had been written by various composers in widely different styles of music. The first verse was in the style of Cole Porter (suggestive of \\"Night and Day\\"); the second verse an aria for baritone in the style of Mozart \\"or one of that crowd\\"; the third verse in the style of the Beatnik \\"Cool School\\" (suggestive of Thelonious Monk's \\"52nd Street Theme\\"); and the rousing finale was, in Lehrer's paraphrase of Shakespeare, \\"full of words and music, and signifying nothing,\\" in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan (suggestive of \\"My name is John Wellington Wells\\" or other patter songs). Lehrer's argument for rewriting the song is that folk songs in general are \\"so atrocious, because they're written 'by the people',\\" and that the original \\"Clementine\\" has \\"no recognizable merit whatsoever.\\" =\\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be a Soldier\\"= A parody of the official songs in use by the various branches of the United States military. Lehrer explains that the Army \\"didn't have no official song\\" when he started basic training; he wrote this one in an attempt to remedy the situation. (The branch adopted \\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\\" as its song in 1956, one year after Lehrer enlisted.Army Regulation 220-90, Army Bands, 14 December 2007, para 2-5f, g) One of the rare parodies of Lehrer's work emerged in Jim Bouton's classic book Ball Four: \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to be an Astro\\", conjured up by members of the 1969 Houston Astros.

It is at the mouth of the River Blyth on the south side of the river. The town of Southwold lies to the north of the river and is the nearest town to Walberswick, around away. Walberswick is around south of Lowestoft on the North Sea coast. It is east of Halesworth and north-east of the county town of Ipswich. Coastal erosion and the shifting of the mouth of the River Blyth meant that the neighbouring town of Dunwich, to the south, was lost as a port in the last years of the 13th century. Following a brief period of rivalry and dispute with Dunwich, Walberswick became a major trading port from the 13th century until World War I. Almost half of the properties in the village are holiday homes.

The original sign went missing in the 1980s but after changing hands has since been returned and restored to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The restored sign has been erected opposite the church. Culture and community The village and surrounding beach and marshland have long attracted residents drawn from the arts, film and media. In the 1890s and 1900s the village became associated with Philip Wilson Steer and his circle of English Impressionists. It was home to the noted artist and architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh from 1914. It was also the birthplace of Oscar-nominated documentary film maker Humphrey Jennings famous for his World War II documentaries. Considering its size, an inordinate number of British celebrities own or have owned holiday homes in the village including the late Clement Freud and his wife Jill, and their daughter, Emma Freud and her partner Richard Curtis. Martin Bell, and Geoffrey Palmer, maintain properties here while Paul Heiney and Libby Purves live nearby. Film director Paul Greengrass has a house in the village, as does ITV's Director Peter Fincham. The village is the setting for Esther Freud's novel, The Sea House, thinly disguised as 'Steerborough' ‚Äì presumably a coded reference, or in-joke, towards one-time resident, Philip Wilson Steer (see above). Esther Freud, the cousin of Emma Freud and daughter of painter Lucian Freud, also has a house in the village with her husband, actor David Morrissey. The village was famous for its annual crabbing competition ‚Äì the British Open Crabbing Championship, last held in August 2010. The person who caught the single heaviest crab within a period of 90 minutes was declared the winner. The proceeds supported many charitable causes. Walberswick is reputedly haunted by a phantom coach, drawn by headless horses and driven by the murderer Tobias Gill, who was hanged in the area in the 18th century.  Transport  Walberswick is on the B1387 road which runs from the A12 south of Blythburgh to the village where it terminates. It is at the mouth of the River Blyth which forms part of Southwold Harbour. Some mooring points for smaller craft in the harbour lie on the Walberswick side of the river. The river is crossed by the Bailey Bridge, a footbridge, to the west of the village. This provides pedestrian and bicycle access across the river to Southwold. A passenger ferry, operated by a rowing boat, operates across the river closer to the centre of the village during the tourist season. Walberswick railway station was on the narrow-gauge Southwold Railway which ran from Halesworth (railway station) to Southwold (railway station). The station was located to the west of the village around south of the crossing at the Bailey Bridge. The line and station closed on 11 April 1929.

He is known for being the lead guitarist and lead vocalist for the Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Tredegar, Monmouthshire, Bradfield attended the local Oakdale Comprehensive School where he suffered years of cruelty and bullying (he claims he was \\"a Woody Allen-esque little nerd\\") for his name (nicknamed Crossfire), lazy eye, musical bent and small size. James formed a close relationship with three friends: his cousin Sean Moore, who lived with James and his family throughout their childhood after his own parents' divorce, and future bandmates Nicky Wire and Richey Edwards. Bradfield loved to run and was a steeplechaser, and soon grew fond of punk rock band The Clash, although his earliest musical love was ELO. He gave up his dream of \\"being like Napoleon\\" and decided that he wanted to be a rock star. He learnt to play guitar by learning how to play Guns N' Roses's Appetite for Destruction with the curtains drawn in his parents' front room. = Solo career = Bradfield in De Montfort Hall in 2010 In late April 2006, a track from Bradfield's debut solo single entitled \\"That's No Way to Tell a Lie\\" premiered on Janice Long's show on BBC Radio 2. It became the first single from the album and was released on 10 July while the album, entitled The Great Western, was released on 24 July. The single debuted at #18 in the UK singles chart while the album debuted at #22 on the album chart. The positions were considered relatively successful considering the lack of promotion. In support of the album, Bradfield played a series of solo gigs in May 2006 in Manchester, Glasgow, Dundee, Nottingham, Birmingham, and London. The setlists consisted of tracks from The Great Western as well as several Manics tracks including \\"This Is Yesterday\\" and \\"Ocean Spray\\". He also played one further date at London ULU in June 2006, featuring a similar setlist to the other gigs. Bradfield also performed at the 2006 V Festival in late August. He embarked on his first full UK tour ‚Äì consisting of 15 dates ‚Äì in October. A second single, \\"An English Gentleman\\", was lifted from The Great Western before the tour and entered the UK chart at #31 on 1 October 2006. The second album by Bradfield, Even in Exile, was confirmed in March 2020 to NME alongside the announcement of a 2021 Manics album. That June, the album was confirmed to be inspired by the life and death of V√≠ctor Jara, with lyrics written as unpublished poetry by Patrick Jones. Two tracks, \\"There'll Come a War\\" and the instrumental \\"Seeking the Room With the Three Windows\\" were released the same day. The next week, the album was given a title and date alongside the launch of its first single, \\"The Boy From the Plantation\\", which debuted on Steve Lamacq's show on BBC Radio 6 Music. The album was released on 14 August 2020 on digital, CD, cassette, and vinyl and entered the UK charts at #6, giving Bradfield his first solo top 10 album. = Personal life = He currently lives in Llandaff, Cardiff.

Grainger Postdoctoral Fellow in Experimental Physics, University of Chicago (1988‚Äì89); and senior research fellow, California Institute of Technology (1989‚Äì1992). Grunsfeld's research has covered x-ray and gamma-ray astronomy, high-energy cosmic ray studies, and development of new detectors and instrumentation. Grunsfeld studied binary pulsars and energetic x-ray and gamma ray sources using the NASA Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, x-ray astronomy satellites, radio telescopes, and optical telescopes including the NASA Hubble Space Telescope. NASA career Grunsfeld was selected by NASA in March 1992 as an astronaut candidate and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. He completed one year of training and qualified for flight selection as a mission specialist. Grunsfeld was initially detailed to the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch and was assigned as the lead for portable computers for use in space. Following his first flight, he led a team of engineers and computer programmers tasked with defining and producing the crew displays for command and control of the International Space Station (ISS). As part of this activity, he directed an effort combining the resources of the Mission Control Center (MCC) Display Team and the Space Station Training Facility. The result was the creation of the Common Display Development Facility (CDDF), responsible for the onboard and MCC displays for the International Space Station, using object-oriented programming techniques. Following his second flight, he was assigned as Chief of the Computer Support Branch in the Astronaut Office supporting Space Shuttle and International Space Station Programs and advanced technology development. Following STS-103, he served as Chief of the Extravehicular Activity Branch in the Astronaut Office. Following STS-109, Grunsfeld served as an instructor in the Extravehicular Activity Branch, and worked on the Orbital Space Plane, exploration concepts, and technologies for use beyond low earth orbit in the Advanced Programs Branch. He served as NASA Chief Scientist assigned to NASA Headquarters from 2003 to 2004. In January 2012, he became the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA's headquarters in Washington, replacing Ed Weiler. Grunsfeld has been actively engaged in communicating space science topics to the public through interviews, public lectures, and television appearances. He was recently interviewed by NASA's Astrobiology Magazine about the James Webb Telescope and at the Science with Hubble Space Telescope III conference in Venice, Italy, about carrying out repairs and upgrades on the Hubble Space Telescope. Recent public lectures include Hugging Hubble at the Space Telescope Science Institute's May 2010 Symposium, Big Science Questions at the 50th anniversary celebration of the Aspen Center for Physics and The Hubble Story presented as a special public lecture at Oxford University's Department of Physics. He has made several television appearances to discuss the successful landing of the Mars Curiosity Rover in August 2012 and its mission, including appearances on the PBS NewsHour with Judy Woodruff, the Colbert Report, and on NASAtelevision. On April 5, 2016, Grunsfield announced his retirement from NASA, which starts from April 30. Spaceflight experience John Grunsfeld works on the Hubble Space Telescope during STS-125 May 14, 2009 STS-67/Astro-2 (March 2‚Äì18, 1995) was launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was the second flight of the Astro observatory, a unique complement of three ultra-violet telescopes. During this record-setting 16-day mission, the crew conducted observations around the clock to study the far ultraviolet spectra of faint astronomical objects and the polarization of ultraviolet light coming from hot stars and distant galaxies. Mission duration was 399 hours and 9 minutes. STS-81 (January 12‚Äì22, 1997) was a 10-day mission, the fifth to dock with Russia's Mir space station, and the second to exchange U.S. astronauts. The mission also carried the Spacehab double module providing additional middeck locker space for secondary experiments. In five days of docked operations more than three tons of food, water, experiment equipment and samples were moved back and forth between the two spacecraft. Grunsfeld served as the flight engineer on this flight. Following 160 orbits of the Earth the STS-81 mission concluded with a landing on Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33 ending a 3.9 million mile journey. Mission duration was 244 hours, 56 minutes. During this flight, Grunsfeld placed a phone call to NPR's auto- repair radio show, Car Talk. In this call he complained about his government Rockwell \\"van's\\" performance. To wit, it would run very loud and rough for about two minutes, quieter for another six and a half, and then the engine would quit. This created some consternation for the hosts until they realized that the van in question was, in fact, the Space Shuttle. STS-103 (December 19‚Äì27, 1999) was an eight-day mission during which the crew successfully installed new gyroscopes and scientific instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVA). Grunsfeld performed two spacewalks totaling 16 hours and 23 minutes. The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits, traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes. STS-109 (March 1‚Äì12, 2002) was the fourth Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing mission. The crew of STS-109 successfully upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope installing a new digital camera, a cooling system for the infrared camera, new solar arrays and a new power system. HST servicing and upgrades were accomplished by four crewmembers during a total of five EVAs in five consecutive days. Grunsfeld served as the Payload Commander on STS-109 in charge of the space walking activities and the Hubble payload. He also performed three spacewalks totaling 21 hours and 9 minutes, including the installation of the new Power Control Unit. STS-109 orbited the Earth 165 times, and covered 3.9 million miles in over 262 hours. STS-125 (May 11‚Äì24, 2009) was the fifth and final servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope. Atlantis launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A May 11, 2009 at 2:01 p.m. EDT, and landed on May 24, 2009 at California's Edwards Air Force Base. During the mission, Grunsfeld performed three of the mission's five back-to-back spacewalks, which installed two new instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope: The Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, and the Wide Field Camera 3. The mission also replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor, six new gyroscopes, and two battery unit modules, to allow the telescope to continue to function at least through 2014. One issue Grunsfeld and his crew experienced during the overhaul was the stripping of 10mm bolts due to improper assembly and technique which he discussed again on Car Talk. Grunsfeld has logged over 58 days in space, including eight space walks totaling 58 hours and 30 minutes. Space Telescope Science Institute According to a NASA press release in January 2010, Grunsfeld indicated he would leave the agency to serve as deputy director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. There he helped prepare the institute for operations with NASA's planned James Webb Space Telescope. He also became a research professor in the Johns Hopkins University department of physics and astronomy in July, 2010. Mountaineering Grunsfeld appeared on the PBS NOVA episode \\"Deadly Ascent\\", which showed him climbing Denali, the highest peak in North America, in June 2000. Grunsfeld, along with Howard Donner, (a consultant to NASA) conducted research into the effects of body temperature at high altitudes by using internal thermometers swallowed in pill form. He was able to climb to an altitude of 17,200 feet before acute altitude sickness forced him to turn back. Grunsfeld was inspired by Edmund Hillary in mountaineering. In June 2004, Grunsfeld returned to McKinley while on vacation from NASA and successfully led a team that summitted. He is the only astronaut to have climbed to the top of Denali.

They are anaerobic or microaerophilic, and are often found in stratified water environments including hot springs, stagnant water bodies, as well as microbial mats in intertidal zones.Hunter, C.N., Daldal, F., Thurnauer, M.C., Beatty, J.T. \\"The Purple Phototropic Bacteria\\", Springer-Dordrecht, 2008. Unlike plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, purple sulfur bacteria do not use water as their reducing agent, and therefore do not produce oxygen. Instead, they can use sulfur in the form of sulfide, or thiosulfate (as well, some species can use H2, Fe2+, or NO2‚àí) as the electron donor in their photosynthetic pathways. The sulfur is oxidized to produce granules of elemental sulfur. This, in turn, may be oxidized to form sulfuric acid. The purple sulfur bacteria are largely divided into two families, the Chromatiaceae and the Ectothiorhodospiraceae, which produce internal and external sulfur granules respectively, and show differences in the structure of their internal membranes. They make up part of the order Chromatiales, included in the gamma subdivision of the Proteobacteria. The genus Halothiobacillus is also included in the Chromatiales, in its own family, but it is not photosynthetic. Characteristics of purple sulfur bacteria Major photosynthetic pigments: Bacteriochlorophylls a or b Location of photosynthetic pigments: Plasma membrane and chromatophore (lamellar membrane complexes that are continuous with the plasma membrane) Photosynthetic electron donors: H2, H2S, S Sulfur deposition: Inside the cell Metabolic type: Photolithoautotroph  Ecology  = Habitat = Purple sulfur bacteria are generally found in illuminated anoxic zones of lakes and other aquatic habitats where hydrogen sulfide accumulates and also in \\"sulfur springs\\" where geochemically or biologically produced hydrogen sulfide can trigger the formation of blooms of purple sulfur bacteria. Anoxic conditions are required for photosynthesis; these bacteria cannot thrive in oxygenated environments. The most favorable lakes for the development of purple sulfur bacteria are meromictic (permanently stratified) lakes. Meromictic lakes stratify because they have denser (usually saline) water in the bottom and less dense (usually fresh water) nearer the surface. Growth of purple sulfur bacteria is also supported by the layering in holomictic lakes. These lakes are thermally stratified; in the spring and summer time, water at the surface is warmed making it less dense than underlying colder water which provides a stable enough stratification for purple sulfur bacteria growth. If sufficient sulfate is present to support sulfate reduction, the sulfide, produced in the sediments, diffuses upward into the anoxic bottom waters, where purple sulfur bacteria can form dense cell masses, called blooms, usually in association with green phototrophic bacteria. Purple sulfur bacteria can also be found and are a prominent component in intertidal microbial mats. Mats, such as the Sippewissett Microbial Mat, have dynamic environments due to the flow of tides and incoming fresh water leading to similarly stratified environments as meromictic lakes. Purple sulfur bacteria growth is enabled as sulfur is supplied from the death and decomposition of microorganisms located above them within these intertidal pools. The stratification and sulfur source allows the PSB to grow in these intertidal pools where the mats occur. The PSB can help stabilize these microbial mat environment sediments through the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances that can bind the sediments in the pools.Hubas, C. et al. \\"Proliferation of Purple Sulphur Bacteria at the Sediment Surface Affects Intertidal Mat Diversity and Functionality\\", PLOS One, December 5, 2013.

Ecol Eng 36: 236‚Äì245. doi:10.1016/ j.ecoleng.2008.12.032. =Ecological significance= Purple sulfur bacteria are able to affect their environment by contributing to nutrient cycling, and by using their metabolism to alter their surroundings. They are able to play a significant role in primary production suggesting that these organisms affect the carbon cycle through carbon fixation. Purple sulfur bacteria also contribute to the phosphorus cycle in their habitat, and the iron cycle. Through upwelling of these organisms, phosphorus, a limiting nutrient in the oxic layer of lakes, is recycled and provided to heterotrophic bacteria for use. This indicates that although purple sulfur bacteria are found in the anoxic layer of their habitat, they are able to promote the growth of many heterotrophic organisms by supplying inorganic nutrients to the above oxic layer. Another form of recycling of inorganic nutrients and dissolved organic matter by purple sulfur bacteria is through the food chain; they act as a source of food to other organisms. Some purple sulfur bacteria have evolved to optimize their environmental conditions for their own growth. For example, in the South Andros Black Hole in the Bahamas, purple sulfur bacteria adopted a new characteristic in which they are able to use their metabolism to radiate heat energy into their surroundings. Due to the inefficiency of their carotenoids, or light-harvesting centres, the organisms are able to release excess light energy as heat energy. This adaptation allows them to compete more effectively within their environment. By raising the temperature of the surrounding water, they create an ecological niche which supports their own growth, while also allowing them to outcompete other non-thermotolerant organisms.  Growth in meromictic lakes  Meromictic lakes are permanently stratified lakes produced by a gradient of saline concentrations. The highly salinated bottom layer is separated from the top layer of fresh water by the chemocline, where the salinity changes drastically. Due to the large difference in density, the upper and lower layers do not mix, resulting in an anoxic environment below the chemocline. This anoxic environment with light and sufficient sulfide availability is ideal for purple sulfur bacteria. A study done at the Mahoney Lake suggested that purple sulfur bacteria contributes to the recycling of the inorganic nutrient, phosphorus. The upwelling of purple sulfur bacteria into the top layer of water creates a source of bound phosphorus, and phosphatase activity releases this phosphorus into the water. The soluble phosphorus is then incorporated into heterotrophic bacteria for use in developmental processes. In this way, purple sulfur bacteria participates in the phosphorus cycle and minimizes nutrient loss.  Biomarkers  Purple sulfur bacteria make conjugated pigments called carotenoids that function in the light harvesting complex. When these organisms die and sink, some pigment molecules are preserved in modified form in the sediments. One carotenoid molecule produced, okenone, is diagenetically altered to the biomarker okenane. The discovery of okenane in marine sediments implies the presence of purple sulfur bacteria during the time of burial. Okenane has been identified in one sedimentary outcrop from Northern Australia dating to 1640 million years ago. The authors of the study concluded that, based on the presence of purple sulfur bacteria's biomarker, the Paleoproterozoic ocean must have been anoxic and sulfidic at depth. This finding provides evidence for the Canfield Ocean hypothesis.  Bioremediation  Purple sulfur bacteria can contribute to a reduction of environmentally harmful organic compounds and odour emission in manure wastewater lagoons where they are known to grow. Harmful compounds such as methane, a greenhouse gas, and hydrogen sulfide, a pungent, toxic compound, can be found in wastewater lagoons. PSB can help lower the concentration of both, and others.McGarvey, JA, et al. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02683.x/epdf \\"Induction of Purple Sulfur Bacterial Growth in Dairy Wastewater Lagoons by Circulation.\\" Letters in Applied Microbiology, vol. 49, no. 4, 2009, pp. 427-433. Harmful organic compounds can be removed through photoassimilation, the uptake of carbon by organisms through photosynthesis.\\"Photoassimilation  Definition of photoassimilation in English by Oxford Dictionaries.\\" https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation Oxford Dictionaries  English, Oxford Dictionaries, en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/photoassimilation. When PSB in the lagoons perform photosynthesis they can utilize the carbon from harmful compounds, such as methane,Leytem, AB, et al. https://ac.els- cdn.com/S0022030217305799/1-s2.0-S0022030217305799-main.pdf?_tid=a8cdccc8-cd79-11e7-8cad-00000aab0f6c&acdnat;=1511130986_0d85d5d96ffb65e1ca976c83f8706f90 \\"Methane Emissions from Dairy Lagoons in the Western United States.\\"Journal of Dairy Science, vol. 100, no. 8, 2017, pp. 6785-6803. as their carbon source. This removes methane, a greenhouse gas, from the lagoon and reduces the lagoons' atmospheric pollution affect. H2S can act as a sulfur source for PSB during these same photosynthetic processes that remove the organic compounds. The use of H2S as a reducing agent by PSB removes it from the lagoon and leads to a reduction of odour and toxicity in the lagoons.\\"Hydrogen sulfide.\\" http://www.npi.gov.au/resource/hydrogen-sulfide National Pollutant Inventory, Australian Government Department of Environment and Energy, www.npi.gov.au/resource/hydrogen-sulfide.

Denvers keel was laid 7 July 1964 at Lockheed Shipbuilding and Construction Company, Seattle, Washington. She was launched 23 January 1965, christened by Mrs. Ann Daniels Love, wife of John A. Love, the former governor of Colorado, and commissioned 26 October 1968. After 46 years of service, the Denver was decommissioned at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam on 14 August 2014. At the time of her decommissioning, Denver was the oldest deployable warship in the U.S. Navy, and was one of the last active warships to have served in Vietnam. History =Role in the SS Columbia Eagle mutiny= In 1970, USS Denver played a key role in the SS Columbia Eagle incident. When the SS Columbia Eagle was commandeered by two mutinous crew members on 14 March 1970, Denver was immediately dispatched to intercept and recapture Columbia Eagle. Denver never really caught up with Columbian Eagle, and sat outside the 12-mile limits of Cambodia (to where Columbia Eagle had been diverted) for a few days then departed the area. =Vietnam War, 1975= In April 1975, Denver participated in Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon, Vietnam. =Collision with USNS Yukon= On 13 July 2000, the ship was participating in a refueling exercise near the end of a deployment. Denver, off the coast of Oahu, collided with its refueling vessel, . Denvers bow was seriously damaged. It remained in port at Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs for two weeks. =Typhoon Morakot= Beginning on 17 August 2009 Denver started rendering humanitarian assistance to Taiwan due to the destruction caused by Typhoon Morakot. Denver was tasked independently to render aid, led by Captain Donald Schmieley along with two embarked squadrons, HM-14 and HSC-25. Cooperating closely with Taiwan Army and Air Force, they were supporting efforts by airlifting food, medical supplies, and providing heavy lift support for earth moving equipment to assist with recovery efforts. Due to the sensitive nature surrounding Taiwan, especially with the One China policy, the Department of Defense did not publicly announce relief efforts. Denver was planned to be in the vicinity of Taiwan until 22 August 2009 to render aid to the people of Taiwan. Denver had just completed Talisman Saber 2009 and was on her way to her homeport when she was directly tasked with this humanitarian mission. =2008 Hull Swap= In 2008 Denver replaced . The crew from USS Juneau took all relevant gear and documents from the Juneau and transferred them to Denver. Denver was then home-ported at Sasebo Naval Base, Japan, where it would remain until being decommissioned. =2009 Sumatra earthquakes= The Denver was sent to Sumatra to assist in the recovery efforts following the earthquakes there in September 2009. =2010= During the 2010 Fall Patrol, from 1 September to 25 November 2010, Denver accompanied and on a tour of Southeast Asia. During the patrol, Denver took part in the 60th anniversary of the invasion of Incheon, Korea and assisted the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Megi. On 17 November, Denver, Essex and Harpers Ferry became the first U.S. warships to visit Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour in more than two years. =2011= The ship departed Sasebo in September 2011 for a patrol of the western Pacific. Accompanying the ship were and USS Essex. =2012= In fall 2012, the Denver departed for the 31st MEU fall patrol. During certification exercises around Guam the Denver's boilers suffered severe damage. After 3 weeks of repair at Guam, the Denver left to continue patrol. The Denver finished the patrol with limited power. =Decommissioning= Denver was decommissioned on 14 August 2014 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii. She had been the oldest active duty ship in the US Navy behind . Upon Denver's decommissioning, became the Navy's second oldest ship. The US government has offered to sell the ship to Malaysia to replace KD Sri Inderapura which was destroyed by fire in an accident in 2009. The Navy has announced that will replace Denver in Sasebo in summer 2015.

He served as pilot on STS-51B (April 29 to May 6, 1985), and was the spacecraft commander on STS-33 (November 22‚Äì27, 1989), and STS-44 (November 24 to December 1, 1991). =STS-51B= STS-51B/Spacelab-3 launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on April 29, 1985, with Gregory serving as pilot. The crew aboard the Orbiter Challenger included spacecraft commander, Robert Overmyer; mission specialists, Norman Thagard, William E. Thornton, and Don Lind; and payload specialists, Taylor Wang and Lodewijk van den Berg. On this second flight of the laboratory developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), the crew conducted a broad range of scientific experiments ranging from space physics to the suitability of animal-holding facilities. The crew also deployed the Northern Utah Satellite (NUSAT). After seven days of around-the-clock scientific operations, Challenger and its laboratory cargo landed on the dry lakebed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on May 6, 1985. Mission duration was 168 hours, 8 minutes, 47seconds. =STS-33= When STS-33 launched at night, from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 22, 1989, Gregory became the first African-American to command a space flight. On board the Orbiter Discovery, Gregory's crew included the pilot, John Blaha, and three mission specialists, Manley (Sonny) Carter, Story Musgrave, and Kathryn Thornton. The mission carried Department of Defense payloads and other secondary payloads. After 79 orbits of the Earth, this five-day mission concluded on November 27, 1989, with a hard surface landing on Runway 04 at Edwards AFB, California. Mission duration was 120 hours, 7 minutes, 32 seconds. =STS-44= STS-44 launched at night from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on November 24, 1991. During 110 orbits of the Earth, the crew successfully deployed their prime payload, the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellite. They worked on a variety of secondary payloads ranging from the Military Man in Space experiment designed to evaluate the ability of a space borne observer to gather information about ground troops, equipment and facilities, and also participated in extensive studies evaluating medical countermeasures to long duration space flight. The crew aboard the Orbiter Atlantis included the pilot Tom Henricks; three mission specialists, Story Musgrave, Jim Voss, and Mario Runco Jr.; and Army payload specialist Tom Hennen. The mission concluded on December 1, 1991, with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.

Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog, and Furthur, which he co-led with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer, bassist Oteil Burbridge, and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti to form the band Dead & Company. The band remains active. During his career with the Grateful Dead, Weir played mostly rhythm guitar and sang many of the band's rock-n-roll and country & western songs.

Career On New Year's Eve, 1963, 16-year-old Weir and an underage friend were wandering the back alleys of Palo Alto, looking for a club that would admit them, when they heard banjo music. They followed the music to its source, Dana Morgan's Music Store. Here, a young Jerry Garcia, oblivious to the date, was waiting for his students to arrive. Weir and Garcia spent the night playing music together and then decided to form a band. The Beatles significantly influenced their musical direction. \\"The Beatles were why we turned from a jug band into a rock 'n' roll band,\\" said Bob Weir. \\"What we saw them doing was impossibly attractive. I couldn't think of anything else more worth doing.\\"Jackson, Blair (2000). Garcia: An American Life, p. 67 Originally called Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions, the band was later renamed The Warlocks and eventually the Grateful Dead. Weir performing with Kingfish, in 1975. Photo: David Gans Weir played rhythm guitar and sang a large portion of the lead vocals through all of the Dead's 30-year career. In the fall of 1968, the Dead played some concerts without Weir and Ron \\"Pigpen\\" McKernan. These shows, with the band billed as \\"Mickey and the Hartbeats\\", were intermixed with full-lineup Grateful Dead concerts. In his biography of Jerry Garcia, Blair Jackson notes, \\"Garcia and Lesh determined that Weir and Pigpen were not pulling their weight musically in the band‚Ä¶ Most of the band fights at this time were about Bobby's guitar playing.\\"Jackson, Blair (2000).

DeadBase XI: The Complete Guide to Grateful Dead Song Lists, DeadBase, , p. 8 The incident apparently led to a period of significant growth in Weir's guitar playing. Phil Lesh said that when drummer Mickey Hart left the band temporarily in early 1971, he was able to hear Weir's playing more clearly than ever and \\"I found myself astonished, delighted and excited beyond measure at what Bobby was doing.\\" Lesh described Weir's playing as \\"quirky, whimsical and goofy\\" and noted his ability to play chord voicings on the guitar (with only four fingers) that one would normally hear from a keyboard (with up to ten fingers).Searching for the Sound, Phil Lesh In the late 1970s, Weir began to experiment with slide guitar techniques and perform certain songs during Dead shows using the slide. His unique guitar style is strongly influenced by the hard bop pianist McCoy Tyner and he has cited artists as diverse as John Coltrane, the Rev. Gary Davis, and Igor Stravinsky as influences. Weir's first solo album Ace appeared in 1972, with the Grateful Dead performing as the band on the album, though credited individually. Included in this line-up were Keith Godchaux and his wife Donna, both of whom would be in the band by the time of the album's release. A live version of the album's best-known song, \\"Playing in the Band\\", had been issued on the Skull & Roses album of the previous year. While continuing to perform as a member of the Grateful Dead, in 1975 and 1976 Weir played in the Bay Area band Kingfish with friends Matt Kelly and Dave Torbert. He later contributed to Kelly's 1987 album A Wing and a Prayer, on Relix Records. In 1978 he fronted the Bob Weir Band with Brent Mydland, who joined the Grateful Dead the following year. In 1980 he formed another side band, Bobby and the Midnites. Shortly before Garcia's death in 1995, Weir formed another band, RatDog Revue, later shortened to RatDog. In RatDog, Weir performs covers of songs by various artists, including The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Chuck Berry, and Willie Dixon while also performing many Grateful Dead songs. In addition, Ratdog performs many of their own originals, most of which were released on the album Evening Moods. Weir and Jay Lane on stage with RatDog in 2009. Weir has participated in the various reformations of the Grateful Dead's members, including 1998, 2000, and 2002 stints as The Other Ones and in 2003, 2004 and 2009 as The Dead.

In June 2016, at the Bonnaroo Arts And Music Festival, Weir received the first ever Les Paul Spirit Award, from the Les Paul Foundation. \\"I cannot think of anyone more fitting to be honored with the first annual Les Paul Spirit Award than Bob Weir. Not only is he an extraordinary talent who has given us an amazing array of legendary music, but he is an innovator who understands music, technologies and the spirit of Les Paul,\\" said Michael Braunstein, executive director of the Les Paul Foundation. \\"If Les were still alive today, I have absolutely no doubt that he and Bob would be experimenting together at TRI Studios or at Les's house and the results would be extraordinary.\\" Weir received the 2016 Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 Americana Honors & Awards in Nashville, TN. In September 2016, Weir released a new album of \\"cowboy songs\\" titled Blue Mountain. The release was followed by a tour beginning in October 2016. The album was inspired by his time working as a ranch hand in Wyoming, when he was fifteen years old. During the spring of 2018, Weir performed a series of concerts with former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. The duo, with guest musicians, was billed as Bobby and Phil. Weir performed a concert tour in the Fall of 2018, as Bob Weir and Wolf Bros. The band is a trio, with Weir on guitar and vocals, Don Was on upright bass, and Jay Lane on drums.

Personal life Bob Weir and Mickey Hart performing at the Mid-Atlantic Inaugural Ball during the Inauguration of Barack Obama, January 20, 2009. Weir remained single throughout his years with the Grateful Dead, although he lived for several years (1969‚Äì1975) with Frankie Hart. Hart had been a go-go dancer at the Peppermint Lounge in New York, had worked in Apple Records American marketing department, and had performed on the TV shows Hullabaloo and Shindig!. She was allegedly the inspiration for the Robert Hunter, Bob Weir song \\"Sugar Magnolia\\". Weir made her acquaintance through Mickey Hart, who dated her briefly. He met her following her first Grateful Dead show in New York in 1968. Her real name at that time was Frankie Azzara (from a previous marriage), but used the stage name \\"Frankie Hart\\" (after apparently \\"borrowing\\" Hart's last name). Although she and Weir never married, she adopted his last name after moving in with him and was subsequently known as Frankie Weir. On July 15, 1999, Weir married Natascha M√ºnter in Mill Valley, California. Together they have two daughters, Shala Monet Weir and Chloe Kaelia Weir. Bob Weir's sister-in law is Leilani M√ºnter, a race car driver in the ARCA Racing Series circuit.

Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip. DK ADULT; 1 Amer ed edition (October, 2003). Weir can also be seen playing a sunburst ES-335 in The Grateful Dead Movie, filmed in October 1974. During the early 1970s, Weir also used a Gibson ES-345, a 1961 or 1962 Gibson SG and a black Gibson Les Paul of indeterminate age in 1971. In 1974, Weir began working with Jeff Hasselberger at Ibanez to develop a custom instrument. Weir began playing the Ibanez 2681 during the recording of Blues for Allah; this was a testbed instrument with sliding pickups that Hasselberger used to develop several additional 2681s for use onstage, as well as Weir's custom \\"Cowboy Fancy\\" guitar, which he played from 1976 until the mid-1980s. Weir began using a Modulus Blackknife at that point, and continued to play the Blackknife, along with a hybrid Modulus/Casio guitar for the \\"Space\\" segment of Grateful Dead concerts for the rest of that band's history. Weir's acoustic guitars include several Martins, a Guild, an Ovation, and a line of Alvarez-Yairi signature models. With his post-Grateful Dead bands, Weir has played a Modulus G3FH custom, a Gibson ES-335, and a 1956 Fender Telecaster previously owned by James Louis Parber, his late half-brother. In August 2016, during a preview of Weir's new solo album, Blue Mountain, Weir stated that the only instrument he used during the recording of the album was a Martin acoustic guitar.

Awards and honors * NASA Outstanding Performance Rating * Sustained Superior Performance Award * Outstanding Leadership Award. Academic experience After completing undergraduate studies in physics and mathematics at Southeast Missouri State University, Godwin attended graduate school at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri. During that time she taught undergraduate physics labs and was the recipient of several research assistantships. She conducted research in low temperature solid state physics, including studies in electron tunneling and vibrational modes of absorbed molecular species on metallic substrates (surfaces) at liquid helium temperatures. Results of her research have been published in several journals. Godwin is an instrument rated private pilot.  NASA career Godwin joined NASA in 1980, in the Payload Operations Division, Mission Operations Directorate, where she worked in payload integration (attached payloads and Spacelabs), and as a flight controller and payloads officer on several Space Shuttle missions. Selected by NASA as an astronaut candidate in June 1985, Godwin became an astronaut in July 1986. Her technical assignments have included working with flight software verification in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL), and coordinating mission development activities for the Inertial Upper Stage (IUS), deployable payloads, and Spacelab missions. She also has served as Chief of Astronaut Appearances, Chief of the Mission Development Branch of the Astronaut Office and as the astronaut liaison to its Educational Working Group, Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office, and Deputy Director, Flight Crew Operations Directorate. Godwin is currently the Assistant to the Director for Exploration, Flight Crew Operations Directorate at the Johnson Space Center. A veteran of four space flights, Godwin has logged over 38 days in space, including over ten EVA hours in two spacewalks. In 1991 she served as a Mission Specialist on STS-37, was the Payload Commander on STS-59 in 1994, flew on STS-76 in 1996, a Mir docking mission, and served on STS-108/International Space Station Flight UF-1 in 2001. Spaceflight experience Godwin performs a spacewalk on STS-108. STS-37 Atlantis (April 5 - April 11, 1991) was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. During the 93 orbits of the mission, the crew deployed the Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) to study gamma ray sources in the universe. GRO, at almost 35,000 pounds (16 Mg), was the heaviest payload deployed to date by the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The crew also conducted an unscheduled spacewalk to free the GRO high gain antenna, and conducted the first scheduled extravehicular activity in 5¬Ω years to test concepts for moving about large space structures. Several middeck experiments and activities were conducted including test of elements of a heat pipe to study fluid transfer processed in microgravity environments (SHARE), a chemical processing apparatus to characterize the structure of biological materials (BIMDA), and an experiment to grow larger and more perfect protein crystals than can be grown on the ground (PCG II). Atlantis carried amateur radio equipment for voice contact, fast scan and slow scan TV, and packet radio. Several hundred contacts were made with amateur radio operators around the world. Mission duration was 143 hours, 32 minutes, 44 seconds. STS-59 Endeavour (April 9 - April 20, 1994) was the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) mission. SRL consisted of three large radars, SIR-C/X-SAR (Shuttle Imaging Radar C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and a carbon monoxide sensor that were used to enhance studies of the Earth's surface and atmosphere. The imaging radars operated in three frequencies and four polarizations. This multispectral capability of the radars provided information about the Earth's surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single- frequency experiments. The carbon monoxide sensor MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution by Satellite) used gas filter radiometry to measure the global distribution of CO in the troposphere. Real-time crew observations of surface phenomena and climatic conditions augmented with over 14,000 photographs aided investigators in interpretation and calibration of the data. The mission concluded with a landing at Edwards AFB after orbiting the Earth 183 times in 269 hours, 29 minutes. Godwin is at top right in an EMU suit STS-76 Atlantis (March 22 - March 31, 1996) was the third docking mission to the Russian space station Mir. Following rendezvous and docking with Mir, transfer of a NASA astronaut to Mir for a 5-month stay was accomplished to begin a continuous presence of United States astronauts aboard Mir for the next two-year period. The crew also transferred 4800 pounds (2,200 kg) of science and mission hardware, food, water and air to Mir and returned over 1100 pounds (500 kg) of U.S. and ESA science and Russian hardware. Godwin performed a six-hour spacewalk, the first while docked to an orbiting space station, to mount experiment packages on the Mir docking module to detect and assess debris and contamination in a space station environment. The packages will be retrieved by a future shuttle mission. The Spacehab module carried in the Shuttle payload bay was utilized extensively for transfer and return stowage of logistics and science and also carried Biorack, a small multipurpose laboratory used during this mission for research of plant and animal cellular function. This mission was also the first flight of Kidsat, an electronic camera controlled by classroom students via a Ku-band link between JSC Mission Control and the Shuttle, which uses digital photography from the Shuttle for science and education. The STS-76 mission was accomplished in 145 orbits of the Earth, traveling 3.8 million miles (6.1 Gm) in 221 hours and 15 minutes. STS-108 Endeavour (December 5 - December 17, 2001) was the 12th shuttle flight to visit the International Space Station. Endeavour's crew delivered the Expedition-4 crew and returned the Expedition-3 crew. The crew unloaded over 3 short tons (2.7 Mg) of supplies, logistics and science experiments from the Raffaello Multi-Purpose Logistics Module and repacked over 2 short tons (1.8 Mg) of items no longer needed on the station for return to Earth.

Burroughs began writing it on February 28, 1929, and the finished story was first published in The Blue Book Magazine as a six-part serial in the issues for April to September 1930. It was later published as a complete novel by Metropolitan in May 1931. Plot summary Like many other Burroughs stories, A Fighting Man of Mars resembles The Arabian Nights. The story is purportedly relayed back to earth via the Gridley Wave, a sort of super radio frequency previously introduced in Tanar of Pellucidar, the third of Burrough's Pellucidar novels, which thus provides a link between the two series. The story-teller is Ulysses Paxton, protagonist of the previous novel, The Master Mind of Mars, but this story is not about him; rather, it is the tale of Tan Hadron of Hastor, a lowly, poor padwar (a low-ranking officer) who is in love with the beautiful, haughty Sanoma Tora, daughter of Tor Hatan, a minor but rich noble. As he is only a padwar, Sanoma spurns him. Then Sanoma Tora is kidnapped, and the novel moves into high gear. As Tan Hadron crosses Mars (\\"Barsoom\\", as Burroughs calls it) searching for Sanoma Tora, he encounters some of Barsoom's most ferocious beasts: huge, many-armed, flesh-eating white apes, gigantic spiders, and the insane cannibals of U-Gor. He also meets the mad scientist Phor Tak, who cackles \\"Heigh-oo!\\" and is crazed with the desire for revenge. The initial simplicity of Burroughs' well-worn pursuit plot is elaborated by Hadron's rescue of an escaped slave, Tavia, from a band of six-limbed Green Martians of Torquas, en route to the city of Jahar where Hadron believes Sanoma Tora has been taken. Tavia is an atypical Burroughs heroine; depicted as self-reliant and competent with weapons, witty and intelligent, she compares favorably for both reader and Hadron with beautiful but shallow Sanoma Tora, who ultimately shows herself unworthy of the virtuous hero. With the addition of Nur An, a disaffected Jaharian warrior, and another escaped woman slave, Phao, Hadron's quest becomes more collaborative than Burroughs' usual, although Tavia, in an unsurprising plot development, is revealed to be a princess at the end.

Inception and controversy The prize was established in 1948 by Paul Mellon, and was funded by a US$10,000 grant from the Bollingen Foundation to the Library of Congress. Both the prize and the foundation are named after the village of Bollingen, Switzerland, where Carl Jung had a country retreat, the Bollingen Tower. The inaugural prize, chosen by a jury of Fellows in American Letters of the Library of Congress, was awarded to Ezra Pound for his collection of poems The Pisan Cantos. The choice of a work by a man who had been a committed fascist sympathizer and who was then under indictment for treason in World War II for his antisemitic broadcasts infuriated many. A bitter controversy ensued in the press, and the Library of Congress was requested by a congressional committee to disassociate itself from the award.Britannica online.

Continuance through the Yale University Library The Bollingen Foundation decided to continue the program, with the administrative tasks being handled by the Yale University Library. The prize was awarded annually from 1948 to 1963. In 1963 the amount of the award was increased to $5,000, and thereafter it was given every other year. After 1968, when the Bollingen Foundation was dissolved, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation took over. In 1973 the Mellon Foundation established an endowment of $100,000 to enable the Yale Library to continue awarding the prize in perpetuity. In 1961 a similar prize was set up by the Bollingen Foundation for best translation and it was won by Robert Fitzgerald for his translation of the Odyssey. It has also been won by Walter W. Arndt for his translation of Eugene Onegin, and in 1963 by Richard Wilbur and Mona Van Duyn jointly.

Hexagonal stipe bases of the fern Cyathea medullaris An orchid's stipe, with pollinia The stipe of a brown alga In the case of ferns, the stipe is only the petiole from the rootstock to the beginning of the leaf tissue, or lamina. The continuation of the structure within the lamina is then termed a rachis. In flowering plants, the term is often used in reference to a stalk that sometimes supports a flower's ovary. In orchids, the stipe or caudicle is the stalk-like support of the pollinia. It is a non-viscid band or strap connecting the pollinia with the viscidium (the viscid part of the rostellum or beak). A stipe is also a structure found in organisms that are studied by botanists but that are no longer classified as plants. It may be the stem-like part of the thallus of a mushroom or a seaweed, and is particularly common among brown algae such as kelp. The stipe of a kelp often contains a central region of cells that, like the phloem of vascular plants, serves to transport nutrients within the alga.

A holdfast is a root-like structure that anchors aquatic sessile organisms, such as seaweed, other sessile algae, stalked crinoids, benthic cnidarians, and sponges, to the substrate. Holdfasts vary in shape and form depending on both the species and the substrate type. The holdfasts of organisms that live in muddy substrates often have complex tangles of root-like growths. These projections are called haptera and similar structures of the same name are found on lichens. The holdfasts of organisms that live in sandy substrates are bulb-like and very flexible, such as those of sea pens, thus permitting the organism to pull the entire body into the substrate when the holdfast is contracted. The holdfasts of organisms that live on smooth surfaces (such as the surface of a boulder) have flattened bases which adhere to the surface. The organism derives no nutrition from this intimate contact with the substrate, as the process of liberating nutrients from the substrate requires enzymatically eroding the substrate away, thereby increasing the risk of organism falling off the substrate. The claw-like holdfasts of kelps and other algae differ from the roots of land plants, in that they have no absorbent function, instead serving only as an anchor.Attenborough, D.1984.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 26, 2011 through five counties in southwestern Ohio in the United States. The Little Miami joins the Ohio River east of Cincinnati. It forms parts of the borders between Hamilton and Clermont counties and between Hamilton and Warren counties. The Little Miami River is one of 156 American rivers designated by the U.S. Congress or the Secretary of the Interior as a National Wild and Scenic River and lends its name to the adjacent Little Miami Scenic Trail. Hydrography Watersheds of the Great Miami River (beige) and Little Miami River (yellow) The Little Miami River is a tributary of the Ohio River. It is part of a watershed that drains a area in 11 southwestern Ohio counties: Clark, Montgomery, Madison, Greene, Warren, Butler, Clinton, Clermont, Brown, and Highland. The river discharges on average into the Ohio River. An average of flow through the river proper; after heavy rains, the river flow may rise to . Tributaries of the Little Miami include Beaver Creek, Sugar Creek, the East Fork Little Miami, North Fork, Todd's Fork, Duck Creek, Caesar Creek, Massie Creek, and Turtle Creek. The river's main tributary, the East Fork of the Little Miami, was dammed in 1977 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers to create Harsha Lake, located in East Fork State Park. Similarly, in 1973, the Army Corps dammed Caesar Creek to create Caesar Creek Lake, located in Caesar Creek State Park. The river's headwaters, considered part of the North Fork, are located about from South Charleston in Clark County, near Plattsburgh. The river empties into the Ohio River at California, a neighborhood of Cincinnati in Hamilton County. Between the headwaters and the mouth, there is a decrease in elevation. History The Little Miami River is named for the Miami, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who lived in the region during the early days of white settlement. Historically, the river formed the eastern boundary of the Symmes Purchase and the western boundary of the Virginia Military District. In 1967 The Ohio University Development Planning Institute (Athens, Ohio) published \\"The Little Miami of Ohio; A Study of a Wild and Scenic River\\". This 56-page booklet, illustrated with maps and black and white photographs, first presented the idea of a corridor of parks and natural areas along the river. In June 1967 Dayton newspaper editor Glenn Thompson would bring together educator Arthur Morgan, business leader Charles Sawyer, and outdoor enthusiast Corwin Fred to form Little Miami Incorporated, dedicated to the preservation of the Little Miami River. Mr. Thompson was the editor of the Dayton Journal-Herald in the late 1950s, and a strong advocate for the preservation of green space in the Miami Valley. The members of the newly formed Little Miami Incorporated would convince Ohio Congressman Clarence Brown to ask for inclusion of the Little Miami in the final list of 27 rivers to be studied for a proposed Scenic Rivers Bill. The 1968 Wild and Scenic River Act designated portions of the Little Miami National Scenic River as Ohio's first National Wild and Scenic River. On April 23 of following year, the Little Miami State Scenic River from Milford to the headwaters became Ohio's first State Scenic River, due to legislation that predated the national act by a few months. The remainder of the river was added to the State Scenic River in 1971. Hydropower of the Little Miami River was developed into the largest privately owned ammunition manufacturing center between New England and the Mississippi River. Company towns for the Miami Powder Company and Peters Cartridge Company were built at Goes Station and Kings Mills, respectively. The portion of Peters Cartridge Company factory on the opposite side of the river from Kings Mills in Hamilton Township, which closed in 1944 and is now owned by DuPont, was declared a Superfund site in 1996. Since then, studies by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency have established that the site no longer poses an environmental hazard to the nearby river. Even so, the site was listed as a Superfund National Priorities List (NPL) site by the Environmental Protection Agency in April 2012 for copper, lead and mercury soil contamination. In September 2018, 15 acres of the 71 acre site was removed for the NPL after successful cleanup goals were achieved.EPA's Superfund Site Information for PETERS CARTRIDGE FACTORY, Environmental Protection Agency Ecology The Little Miami River passing through Clifton Gorge in John Bryan State Park, Greene County The Little Miami River is home to at least 87 species of fish, as well as many species of turtles, frogs, water snakes, birds, mammals and invertebrates. The river contains 36 species of mussels, including two threatened species, one of which is endangered. Ohio considers five of the species to be endangered. Recently, zebra mussels and Asiatic clams have crowded out native species. The river is protected by a number of nature preserves owned by Little Miami Inc., as well as by state and local parks (see below). Recreation The Little Miami River is a National Scenic River. A series of state and county parks and bike trails have been built along the river, primarily the Little Miami Scenic Trail, which is concurrent with the Buckeye Trail and Little Miami Scenic State Park. Most of these trails have been built along the abandoned rail grades that run along the river (see Rail trail). The Ohio to Erie Trail project, under construction, aims to link these trails to other trails statewide to create a single bike trail from Lake Erie to the Ohio River. The Little Miami is also popular among canoers and anglers. There are several canoe liveries along its course and the smallmouth bass fishing in the river is among the best in the state. For a river its size and considering that it drains mainly agricultural land, the water quality of the Little Miami River is excellent. Visitors may see a variety of wildlife including several varieties of turtles, mallards, and other ducks, Canada geese and blue herons.

Gernhardt presently serves as a member of the astronaut office EVA branch, as Principal Investigator of the Prebreathe Reduction Program, and as Manager of JSC's Environmental Physiology Laboratory. A four- flight veteran, Gernhardt has logged over 43 days in space, including 4 spacewalks totaling 23 hours and 16 minutes. He was a mission specialist on STS-69 in 1995, STS-83 in 1997, STS-94 in 1997, and STS-104 in 2001. Gernhardt served as an aquanaut on the first NEEMO (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations) crew aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory in October 2001. In April 2005, he was the commander of the NEEMO 8 mission. Gernhardt drove the lunar rover prototype at President Barack Obama's inaugural parade on January 20, 2009. On September 19, 2011, NASA announced that Gernhardt would participate in the NEEMO 15 mission in October 2011 from the DeepWorker submersible. The DeepWorker is a small submarine used as an underwater stand- in for the Space Exploration Vehicle, which might someday be used to explore the surface of an asteroid. In June 2012, Gernhardt piloted the DeepWorker as part of the NEEMO 16 mission, for which he was principal investigator. Spaceflight experience STS-69 took place from September 7‚Äì18, 1995. Its prime objective was the successful deployment and retrieval of a SPARTAN satellite and the Wake Shield Facility (WSF). The WSF was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of using this free-flying experiment to grow semiconductors, high temperature superconductors and other materials using the ultra-high vacuum created behind the spacecraft, near the experiment package. Gernhardt was one of two astronauts to perform a spacewalk to evaluate future Space Station tools and hardware, logging 6 hours and 46 minutes of EVA. Mission duration was 260 hours, 29 minutes, and 8 seconds, traveling 4.5 million miles in 171 orbits of the Earth. STS-83 took place from April 4‚Äì8, 1997. This was the Microgravity Science Laboratory (MSL-1) Spacelab mission, and it was cut short due to problems with one of the Shuttle's three fuel cell power generation units. Mission duration was 95 hours and 12 minutes, traveling 1.5 million miles in 63 orbits of the Earth. STS-94 took place from July 1‚Äì17, 1997.

Brass knuckles are pieces of metal shaped to fit around the knuckles. Despite their name, they are often made from other metals, plastics or carbon fibers. Designed to preserve and concentrate a punch's force by directing it toward a harder and smaller contact area, they result in increased tissue disruption, including an increased likelihood of fracturing the intended target bones on impact. The extended and rounded palm grip also spreads across the attacker's palm the counter-force that would otherwise be absorbed primarily by the attacker's fingers, reducing the likelihood of damage to the attacker's fingers.  History and variations  Brass knuckles carried by Abraham Lincoln's bodyguards during his train ride through Baltimore.

Vajra mushti has been practiced in India since at least 12th century and mentioned in Manasollasa. The Nihang Sikhs used an early variant called Sher Panja in the 18th century. Cast iron, brass, lead, and wood knuckles were made in the United States during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865). Soldiers would often buy cast iron or brass knuckles. If they could not buy them, they would carve their own from wood, or cast them at camp by melting lead bullets and using a mold in the dirt. Some brass knuckles have rounded rings, which increase the impact of blows from moderate to severe damage. Other instruments (not generally considered to be \\"brass knuckles\\" or \\"metal knuckles\\" per se) may have spikes, sharp points and cutting edges. These devices come in many variations and are called by a variety of names, including \\"knuckle knives.\\" By the late 19th century, knuckledusters were incorporated into various kinds of pistols such as the Apache revolver used by criminals in France in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. During World War I the US Army issued two different knuckle knives, the US model 1917 and US model 1918 Mark I trench knives. Knuckles and knuckle knives were also being made in England at the time and purchased privately by British soldiers. By World War II, knuckles and knuckle knives were quite popular with both American and British soldiers. The Model 1918 trench knives were reissued to American paratroopers. British Commandos even had their very own \\"Death's Head\\" knuckle knife, featuring a skull-shaped brass knuckle handle. A notable knuckle knife still in use is the Cuchillo de Paracaidista, issued to Argentinian paratroopers. Current-issue models have an emergency blade in the crossguard.  Legality and distribution  Brass knuckles are illegal in Hong Kong, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Bosnia, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Israel, the Republic of Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Turkey,Yasak Ate≈üsiz Silahlar(in Turkish) Singapore, Taiwan,ÊßçÁ†≤ÂΩàËó•ÂàÄÊ¢∞ÁÆ°Âà∂Ê¢ù‰æã and the United Kingdom. Import of knuckle dusters into Australia is illegal unless a government permit is obtained; permits are only available for limited purposes, such as police and government use, or use in film productions. They are prohibited weapons in the state of New South Wales. In Brazil, brass knuckles are legal and freely sold. They are called \\"soco ingl√™s\\", which means \\"English punch\\". In Canada, brass knuckles, or any similar devices made of metal, are listed as prohibited weapons; possession of such weapon is a criminal offence under the Criminal Code. Plastic knuckles have been determined to be legal in Canada. Similar legislation has been instituted in Russia and Australia. In France, brass knuckles have been illegal for twenty years. They can be bought as a \\"collectable\\" (provided one is over 18), but it is forbidden to carry or use one, whatever the circumstance, self-defense included. The French term is \\"poing am√©ricain\\", which literally means \\"American fist\\". In Germany, brass knuckles are by law \\"illegal weapons\\" (\\"verbotene Waffen\\") and are forbidden to either carry or just possess in any known variant. The German term is \\"Schlagring\\", which literally means \\"punch ring\\". In Italy and Mexico, brass knuckles are legal and freely sold to people of legal age (over 18 years old), but carrying them is forbidden. In Russia brass knuckles were illegal to purchase or own during times of Russian Empire and are still forbidden according to Article 6 of 1996 Federal Law On Weapons.–§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–∫–æ–Ω –†–§ ¬´–û–± –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏–∏¬ª They are called \\"–∫–∞—Å—Ç–µ—Ç\\" (French casse-t√™te, literally \\"breaking the head\\"). In Sweden, brass knuckles are legal to purchase and own (for people 21 years of age), but are not legal to sell in stores or carry in public. The carrying of brass knuckles carry the same penalty as carrying a knife, and falls under the same law. They are called \\"knogj√§rn\\", literally \\"knuckle iron\\". In Serbia, knuckles are legal to purchase and own (for people over 16 years old) but are not legal to carry in public. They are called \\"–±–æ–∫—Å–µ—Ä\\" literally \\"boxer\\". In Taiwan, according to the Law of Taiwan, possession and sales of brass knuckles are illegal. Under regulation, brass knuckles are considered weapons. Without the permission of the central regulatory agency, it is against the law to manufacture, sell, transport, transfer, rent, or have them in collection or on display. In the United States, brass knuckles are not significantly regulated at the federal level, but various state, county and city laws prohibit their purchase and/or possession. Some state laws require purchasers to be 18 or older. Most states have statutes regulating the carrying of weapons, and many specifically prohibit brass knuckles or \\"metal knuckles.\\" Where they are legal, brass knuckles can normally be purchased online or at flea markets, swap meets, and at some sword and weapon shops. Some companies manufacture belt buckles or novelty paper weights that function as brass knuckles and are sold \\"for entertainment purposes only\\".

A shimmy is a dance move in which the body is held still, except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth. When the right shoulder goes back, the left one comes forward. It may help to hold the arms out slightly bent at the elbow, and when the shoulders are moved, keep the hands in the same position.  History  In 1917, a dance-song titled \\"Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble\\" by Spencer Williams was published, as was \\"The Jazz Dance\\", which included the \\"Shimmy-She\\", among others. Gilda Gray attributed to American Indians in a 1919 interview with Variety saying \\"You may not believe it but the original shimmy dance has never been properly introduced in New York. I know, for I have studied the dancing characteristics of the Indians for a long time and they are really responsible for the shimmy which they labeled the 'Shima Shiwa'. There have been continual efforts on the part of this dancer and that one, with each declaring that his or her version is the 'original.' There is no doubt but that the shimmy dance as it was constructed by the American Indian... would have a greater popularity if done right.\\" \\"I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate\\" was an up-tempo jazz dance song, written by Clarence Williams and Armand Piron, and published in 1919 which has been enduringly popular ever since and performed and recorded by many artists. Flappers often performed the dance in the 1920s. The origin of the name is often attributed to Gilda Gray, a Polish emigrant to America. An anecdote says that when she was asked about her dancing style, she answered, in heavy accent, \\"I'm shaking my chemise\\". However, in an interview Gilda denied having said this, and earlier usages of the word are recorded. In the late 1910s, others were also attributed as being the \\"inventor\\" of the shimmy, including Bee Palmer. Mae West, in her autobiography Goodness Had Nothing to Do with It, claimed to have retitled the \\"Shimmy-Shawobble\\" as the Shimmy herself, after seeing the moves in some black nightclubs. The dance was often considered to be obscene and was frequently banned from dance halls during the 1920s. The move is also known in Gypsy dances. In Russian this move is called \\"Tsyganochka\\", or \\"gypsy girl\\", and is done by gypsy female dancers to produce a chime of costume decorations made of the sewn-on coins. The dance move with this name is used in various modern dances. In the early 1960s, several dance songs featuring the Shimmy became hits, including Bobby Freeman's \\"Shimmy, Shimmy\\", the Olympics' \\"Shimmy Like Kate\\", and Little Anthony & the Imperials' \\"Shimmy Shimmy Ko-ko Bop\\".  Belly dance  The shimmy is also a class of belly dance moves. Depending on the desired effect, style, teacher, and country of origin of the particular dance, a shimmy might be executed differently, but altogether, the shimmy will manifest as a fast shaking or shuddering movement that can be rhythmic or arrhythmic. The movement may be localized, such as in the hips, shoulder, chest, etc., or the move might be loose and general, reverberating through the entire body. Shimmies in belly dance can also have orientation, such as an up/down movement or a twisting movement of the hips.

The ecoregion covers an area of 34,630 sq miles (89,691 km2) encompassing the Piedmont and coastal plain of seven states, extending from coastal southwestern Maine, southeastern New Hampshire, eastern Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, southward through Connecticut, New York State, New Jersey, southeast Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. The ecoregion is bounded on the east by the Atlantic Ocean. To the north, it transitions to the New England- Acadian forests, which cover most of northern and inland New England. To the west, the ecoregion transitions to Allegheny Highlands forests and the Appalachian-Blue Ridge forests of the Appalachian Mountains. To the south lie the Southeastern mixed forests and the Middle Atlantic coastal forests. The ecoregion surrounds the distinct Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion, which covers portions of New Jersey, Long Island and Cape Cod in southeastern Massachusetts. Climate The climate in this ecoregion is the broad transition from the humid continental in the north to the humid subtropical climate in the south. Flora Oak forests dominate this ecoregion. American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was formerly important, but its population was devastated by the chestnut blight early in the 20th century. =Dry-mesic oak forests= Northeastern interior dry-mesic oak forests are found throughout this ecoregion. They cover large areas at low and middle elevations, typically on flat to gently rolling terrain. Red oak (Quercus rubra), white oak (Quercus alba), and black oak (Quercus velutina) are common oaks in this habitat. Other trees include hickories (Carya spp.), red maple (Acer rubrum), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), black cherry (Prunus serotina), black birch (Betula lenta), black tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica), and American elm (Ulmus americana). Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is a common understory tree. common shrubs are maple-leaved viburnum (viburnum acerifolium), spicebush (Lindera benzoin), and witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana). In sandier or more acidic soils are mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia), blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and swamp azalea (Rhododendron viscosum). Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) is a common herbaceous plant. =Hemlock-northern hardwood forests= Hemlock- northern hardwood forests occur in deep coves, moist flats, and ravines. They include sugar maple, yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), and beech. These trees often form a deciduous canopy, but are sometimes mixed with hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) or white pine (Pinus strobus). Other common trees include oaks (most commonly red oak), tuliptree, black cherry, and sweet birch. In the Northeast, red spruce (Picea rubens) can be a minor canopy associate. Hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) is frequent but not dominant. =Dry oak-pine forests= Central Appalachian dry oak-pine forests occur on dry sites with loamy to sandy soils. A mix of oak and pine tree species dominate the canopy, typically chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana), and white pine (Pinus strobus), but sometimes white oak (Quercus alba) or scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Varying amounts of oaks and pines result in oak forests, mixed oak-pine forests, or small pine forests. Shrubs such as hillside blueberry (Vaccinium pallidum), black huckleberry (Gaylussacia baccata), and mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) are common in the understory and can form a dense layer. =Pine-oak rocky woodlands= Central Appalachian pine-oak rocky woodlands occur on lower-elevation hilltops, outcrops, and rocky slopes and have a patchy or open aspect. Pitch pine (Pinus rigida) and Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana) are common within their respective ranges. These pines are often mixed with dry-site oaks such as chestnut oak (Quercus prinus), bear oak (Quercus ilicifolia), northern red oak (Quercus rubra), and scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea). Sprouts of chestnut (Castanea dentata) can also be found. In the northeast, eastern red-cedar (Juniperus virginiana) or hophornbeam (Ostrya virginiana) are sometimes important. In the understory, some areas have a fairly well-developed heath shrub layer, others a graminoid layer, the latter particularly common under deciduous trees such as oaks. Harriman State Park in New York. =Successional plant communities= These occur in formerly cleared land, such as old farms, that have been abandoned. Eastern red cedar (Juniperus virginiana) are some of the first trees to occupy these lands. =Freshwater wetlands= Marshes occur where standing water is present for most of the year. Common reed (Phragmites australis) and cattails (Typha spp.) are often abundant. Swamps and floodplains occur where standing water is present for only some parts of the year. Red maple is a common tree, and can be found with swamp tupelo, white ash, American elm, pin oak (Quercus palustris), swamp white oak (Quercus bicolor), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). Spicebush is a common shrub. Skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus foetidus) is found here. Fauna Some of the animals that live in the Northeastern coastal deciduous forests are white-tailed deer, eastern gray squirrels, chipmunks, red foxes, sparrows, chickadees, copperheads, rattlesnakes, northern water snakes, box turtles, snapping turtles, garter snakes, snails, coyotes, black bears, beavers, woodchucks and raccoons. Chickadees, white-tailed deer, and eastern gray squirrels can be seen quite often. Gray wolves used to be quite common, but are extirpated, causing endemic growth in deer populations near suburban areas, with eastern coyotes generally taking their place by the mid-20th century. Moose may also be seen in some of the northernmost regions of the Northeastern coastal forests, though this is very, very rare.https://patch.com/massachusetts/worcester/moose-comeback-massachusetts- map-shows-sightings-deaths Areas of intact habitat The following natural areas are within this ecoregion * New Hampshire ** Bear Brook State Park ** Pawtuckaway State Park * Massachusetts ** Douglas State Forest ** Freetown- Fall River State Forest ** Hockomock Swamp ** Parker River National Wildlife Refuge ** Frederick Weston Memorial Forest ** Wompatuck State Park * Rhode Island ** Arcadia Management Area ** Great Swamp Management Area * Connecticut ** Meshomasic State Forest ** Natchaug State Forest ** Pachaug State Forest ** Yale-Myers Forest * New York ** Bear Mountain State Park ** Black Rock Forest ** Clarence Fahnestock State Park ** Harriman State Park ** Hudson Highlands State Park ** Oyster Bay National Wildlife Refuge ** Sterling Forest State Park ** Storm King State Park * New Jersey ** Abram S.

He won the 1996 World Series with the New York Yankees over his hometown Atlanta Braves and played in the 2006 World Series with the Detroit Tigers. In addition to being known for his fielding (winning 5 Gold Glove Awards), he pitched the 14th perfect game in MLB history. In 2008, he was the oldest baseball player in the American League. Rogers is nicknamed The Gambler, after a song made famous by a singer who also shares his name. Biography Rogers was born in Savannah, Georgia and grew up on a farm in Dover, Florida.1991 Topps baseball card #332 Rogers and his wife, Rebecca Lewis, reside in Westlake, Texas, with their two children. He enjoys golf, fishing and building houses for Habitat for Humanity. Baseball Career Rogers graduated from Plant City High School in Florida in 1982, where he played baseball only during his senior season, hitting .375 as a right fielder (he played shortstop in his senior league). He was selected by the Texas Rangers in the 39th round of the 1982 Major League Baseball draft, and signed for $1,000. He was converted into a pitcher on the strength of his throwing arm and left-handedness. Rogers spent 7 years in the minor leagues before making it to the Rangers in 1989 as a reliever. He became a starting pitcher for the club in 1993. During Rogers' career, he played for the: Texas Rangers (1989‚Äì95, 2000‚Äì02, 2004‚Äì05), New York Yankees (1996‚Äì97), Oakland Athletics (1998‚Äì99), New York Mets (1999), Minnesota Twins (2003), and Detroit Tigers (2006‚Äì08). With the Detroit Tigers in 2006, he won 17 regular season games, and excelled in the post-season with 23 straight scoreless innings over his 3 starts. He's one of only 3 pitchers in Rangers history through 2009 to win at least 17 games in 31 starts or fewer (set back in 1995), along with Scott Feldman (also in 2009) and Ferguson Jenkins (18 wins in 30 starts in 1978). =Oakland Athletics= Rogers was acquired by the Oakland Athletics from the Yankees for third baseman Scott Brosius in Billy Beane's first trade as general manager. Rogers led the Oakland pitching staff in his first season in innings (238.7) and wins (16). The next season, he started 19 games, winning only 5 with a 4.30 ERA. He was traded at the deadline to the New York Mets for Terrence Long and a minor league player. =New York Mets= During his short tenure, Rogers started 12 games during the regular season, winning 5 and losing 1, compiling a 4.03 earned run average. He's best remembered in a Mets uniform for walking in the series winning run against the Atlanta Braves in Game 6 of the 1999 NLCS, costing the Mets the series. =Texas Rangers= After the 1999 season, Rogers signed with the Texas Rangers. On June 29th, 2005, after walking out onto Ameriquest Field for a pre-game warmup against the LA Angels, Rogers shoved two cameramen,ESPN ‚Äì Rangers pitcher threatens and confronts cameramen ‚Äì MLB knocking one camera to the ground. One of the reporters resumed filming after picking up said camera, which angered Rogers into shoving him again, after grabbing and throwing the camera to the ground, kicking it. He was then led away by a teammate and later sent home by the Club. Larry Rodriguez (the assaulted cameraman) of Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex' Fox Network affiliate KDFW was taken to a local hospital, complaining of shoulder, arm and leg pain. While in the hospital, Rodriguez made an official complaint of assault against Rogers. Two days after the incident, Commissioner Bud Selig suspended Rogers for 20 games and fined him $50,000. While an appeal of his suspension was pending, Rogers appeared at the 2005 All-Star Game in Detroit. The suspension was subsequently upheld by Selig. The commissioner was later overruled by independent arbitor Shyam Das, allowing Rogers to return to play after sitting out 13 games. On July 18th 2005, Rogers was charged with a Class A misdemeanor assault charge with regard to Rodriguez and a Class C misdemeanor assault charge with regard to the second, FSN Southwest, cameraman David Mammeli. Rogers was cited and released on $1,500 bond. The Class A charge was later reduced to Class C following Rogers' completion of an anger management course. On August 11th 2005, Rogers returned to the mound against the Boston Red Sox in Fenway Park. Rogers allowed 5 runs and 7 hits during 5 innings, on the way to a 16‚Äì5 Boston victory. He finished 2005 with a 3.46 ERA in 195 innings. Shortly after the regular season ended, the Rangers announced Rogers would not return to the team. On October 5th, 2005, Rodriguez filed a civil suit against Rogers and the Rangers, seeking an unspecified amount of monetary damages. =Signing with Detroit= Rogers warming up prior to a rehab start with the West Michigan Whitecaps, Single-A affiliates of the Detroit Tigers in 2007. On December 8th 2005, Rogers signed a two-year, $16 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Rogers ended the 2006 regular season with a record of 17‚Äì8 and a 3.84 ERA. \\"We've needed a guy like that for a long time. I'm glad we went out and got him...He means a lot to our team and to guys like me,\\" said Tigers starter Jeremy Bonderman on Rogers. Rogers, on his first year in Detroit: \\"There's a lot of benefits here, by far, that you wouldn't know as a visiting player, and for me, I've been around quite a while, but I appreciate the town, the city, the people. The travel for a baseball player is very hard, but here it's not that difficult. It lends itself to being able to relax on certain days that you could get off. There's just more benefits, especially when you have the quality of people here like Dombrowski and like we have in Mr. Ilitch, those things that you can't take for granted. You add in Jim Leyland and the coaching staff here, and I just got lucky to choose this place...Right when I went in the door and met them, I knew. I knew where I was going to end up.\\" On March 30th 2007, ESPN reported that Rogers would miss 3 months after undergoing surgery for a blood clot in his pitching shoulder. He made his return on June 22nd against the Atlanta Braves, pitching 6 scoreless innings and allowing 2 hits while earning his first win of the season. =2006 postseason= On October 6th 2006, Rogers won his first postseason game, pitching 7 scoreless innings with 8 strikeouts in a 6‚Äì0 Tigers victory against the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League Division Series. At 41 years and 330 days old, he became the oldest starting pitcher to earn his first career postseason win. A week later on October 13th, Rogers retired 9 batters in a row, in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Oakland Athletics, allowing only 2 hits and 2 walks in 7 scoreless innings, while striking out 6 and pacing the Tigers to a 3‚Äì0 victory, leaving the Tigers 1 win away from their first World Series appearance since 1984. Rogers started Game 2 of the 2006 World Series on October 22nd 2006\\\\. \\"We wanted Kenny to pitch 2 games at home,\\" Leyland said. He left the game with the Tigers in the lead 3‚Äì0, pitching 8 shutout innings, retiring 10 straight batters, striking out 5, allowing only 2 hits and 3 walks, making him the oldest starting pitcher to win a World Series game,Associated Press and 1 of only 2 pitchers over the age of 40 to do so (Curt Schilling would become the second in 2007). During the first inning, Fox cameras caught a smudge on Rogers' pitching hand. Rogers said it was dirt mixed with rosin from the rosin bag and wiped it off. MLB spokesperson Rich Levin said the incident was investigated, and the substance was described as dirt. Since it's not ruled a foreign substance, per Rule 8.02, Rogers remained in the game.The Official Site of Major League Baseball: News: Major League Baseball News In the process, Rogers extended his streak to 23 shutout innings. Examination of images from previous games revealed similar smudges in 2 other games. =Retirement= After injuries shortened his 2007‚Äì08 seasons, Rogers ceased playing at the end of 2008. With 219 career victories, he became the 7th 200-game winner who never won 20 games in any single season, joining Milt Pappas, Jerry Reuss, Frank Tanana, Charlie Hough, Dennis Mart√≠nez and Chuck Finley. Tim Wakefield joined the group with his 200th win in 2011. Mike Mussina reached 200 wins without having a 20-win season, but recorded a 20-win season afterward. On August 6th 2011, Rogers was enshrined into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. In 2010, Rogers served as a pitching coach for the Detroit Tigers during spring training. According to remarks by Justin Verlander and Jim Leyland, his ability to coach pitchers on fielding would be particularly of interest to the team. In 2011, Rogers threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Comerica Park in Game 3 of the ALDS. Rogers reportedly never formally retired from Major League Baseball. Accomplishments =Perfect game= Rogers pitched the 14th perfect game in baseball history on July 28, 1994 with the Rangers against the California Angels (the last no-hitter in Rangers history to date, and the only perfect game in franchise history). Soon after his feat, he appeared on ABC's Good Morning America on July 29, 1994, and on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on August 1, 1994. He also met and appeared with musician Kenny Rogers at a function in Arlington, Texas on August 13, 1994. Rogers' 1994 perfect game was caught by Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez, who in June 2007 caught the no-hitter of Detroit Tiger Justin Verlander, both of whom were teammates of Rogers at the time. The game took place exactly three years to the day of the last perfect game, pitched by Dennis Mart√≠nez of the Montreal Expos on July 28, 1991. =Gold Gloves= Known as one of the finest fielding pitchers in baseball, Rogers won 5 Gold Glove Awards at pitcher, including 4 with the Rangers and 1 with the Tigers. He was honored with a Fielding Bible Award in 2008 as the top fielding pitcher in MLB. Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane stated that Rogers \\"was the best fielding pitcher\\" he ever saw. \\"It's like having an extra infielder.\\" =200 career wins= On June 18, 2006 Rogers won his 200th game (against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field), during which Detroit set a club record with 8 home runs. =Pickoffs= Rogers is second all-time in pickoffs with 93 in his career.

She was born in Cairo as Lena Westropp, the daughter of a wealthy expatriate British family, and her early years ensured that she had a wide experience of culture. However, she was sent to England to Downe House, a girls' boarding school which specialised in the daughters of colonial servants. She was promising academically and attended Somerville College, Oxford and the University of Heidelberg. During the Second World War she was an organiser for the Women's Voluntary Service and the Land Army. She married twice, firstly Henry Peat, and then John Townsend. In 1955 she was first elected to the London County Council for her home seat of Hampstead, and took a special interest in the Education Committee. She was chosen to be Leader of the Opposition on the Education Committee from the early 1960s. Townsend was an unsuccessful candidate in the first Greater London Council election of 1964, being defeated in Camden. However, in 1967 she was more fortunate and won by about 4,000 votes. This brought with it membership of the LCC Education Committee's successor body, the Inner London Education Authority, and it was there that Townsend concentrated. The Conservatives had won narrow control of ILEA and Townsend ran for the Leadership, but lost to Christopher Chataway who was the preferred candidate of the Conservative Party nationally. Chataway did make Townsend his Deputy, and Chairman of the Schools Committee. The two worked well as a team, with both clearly on the left of the Conservative Party. Townsend supported 'Schools Councils' for pupils to take some responsibility for the management of their schools. She was nominated as a member of the Race Relations Board Conciliation Committee for London in 1968. She was a founder member of the Conservative Group for Europe. In 1969 Christopher Chataway was elected to Parliament in a byelection, and stepped down from the ILEA Leadership. Townsend was chosen as his successor, and largely continued his moderate policies. When Christian morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse attacked a BBC sex education film, Townsend defended it. She was however faced with a strike of teachers in November that year over a national pay claim. Fighting for re-election in 1970, Townsend promoted the record of three years of Conservative ILEA by pointing to the success in reducing class sizes by employing more teachers. However, there was a small swing to Labour, who regained control; Townsend lost her seat in Camden but was elected as an Alderman to the GLC and co-opted to ILEA's Education Committee. She remained as Leader of the Opposition until February 1971 when she resigned, saying that she needed a paying job. Townsend remained an Alderman of the GLC until 1977 when the Aldermanic system was abolished. She was a member of several bodies, most prominently as a Governor of the London College of Fashion (and Chair of Governors from 1967 to 1986). In Edward Heath's Dissolution Honours list of 1974 she was awarded a CBE. Keeping the links with the country of her birth, she was President of the Anglo-Egyptian Association from 1961 until it was wound up in 1987.

Andover Theological Seminary and Newton Theological Institution merged in 1965 to form the Andover Newton Theological School (1965-2018). In its original and merged forms, it was the first and thus the oldest theological seminary founded in the United States. The seminary continues as Andover Newton Seminary at Yale Divinity School launched in 2017. History Andover Theological Seminary traces its roots to the late 18th century and the desire for a well-educated clergy among Congregationalists in the United States. That desire was expressed in the founding of Phillips Academy in 1778 for \\"the promotion of true Piety and Virtue\\". In 1806, a growing split within the Congregational churches, known as the Unitarian Controversy, came to a full boil on the campus of Harvard College. The Hollis Chair of Divinity sat empty at Harvard for two years owing to tensions between liberal and more orthodox Calvinists. This theological battle soon divided many of the oldest churches in Massachusetts and began to impact church polity and the hiring of ministers. When the Harvard Board of Overseers appointed well-known liberal Henry Ware to the Hollis Chair in 1805, the Calvinists withdrew to organize and establish a new school in 1807, Andover Theological Seminary on the campus of Phillips Academy (est. 1778) in Andover, Massachusetts. This act, covered widely in the national press, was one of the significant events that contributed to the split in the denomination and to the eventual founding of the American Unitarian Association in 1825 (which joined the Universalists, founded in 1793, to become the Unitarian Universalist Association in 1961). Andover was founded by the joint efforts of traditionalist, \\"Old Calvinists\\" and the adherents of the New Divinity (also known as New England theology) which was more revivalistic. Leonard Woods, Moses Stuart, and Edward Dorr Griffin were early faculty. Between 1886 and 1892, a theological dispute known as the \\"Andover Controversy\\" broke out between the conservative \\"New England Calvinism\\" of the founders and the liberal theology of many on the faculty. President E. C. Smyth was investigated and dismissed for his liberal views in 1887, but in 1891 his dismissal was reversed, on technical grounds, by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, and the matter was dropped the following year. = Relocations and merger = In 1908, Harvard Divinity School and Andover attempted to reconcile, and the seminary moved its faculty and library to the Harvard campus (and soon into Andover Hall [1911]). Plans for a formal affiliation between the academies were made, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts disallowed the alliance since Andover's endowment is designated for a Christian theological education. Andover, therefore, relocated to the campus of Newton Theological Institution in 1931. Andover Theological Seminary and the Newton Theological Institution formally merged in 1965 as the Andover Newton Theological School (ANTS). Newton Theological Institution began instruction in 1825 at Newton Centre, Massachusetts as a graduate seminary formally affiliated with the group now known as American Baptist Churches USA, the oldest Baptist denomination in America. As the institution developed, it adopted Andover's curricular pattern and shared the same theological tradition of loyalty to the evangelical Gospel and zeal for its dissemination. In November 2015, ANTS announced that it would sell its campus and relocate to Yale Divinity School, after a presence of 190 years on that site. = Historical influence on Protestant missions = Prior to the founding of Andover and Newton, the model for the training of clergy was based on an undergraduate degree (actually the basis for the founding of most of the early colleges in the United States). The graduate model and the three year curriculum with a resident student body and resident faculty pioneered at Andover and Newton has become the standard for almost all of the 140 Protestant theological schools in the country. Reflecting that zeal, the modern missionary movement began in this country through a group of Andover students known as the Brethren. Both Andover and Newton quickly assumed leadership in the modern mission movement, drawing the two schools into close association of people and ideas. Graduates such as Luther Rice and Hiram Bingham pioneered in Christian missions around the world.

The Mordvins comprise one of the more numerous indigenous peoples of Russia. They identify themselves as separate ethnic groups: * Erzya * Moksha * Teryukhan * Tengushev (or Shoksha) Mordvins who became fully Russified or Turkified during the 19th to 20th centuries Less than one third of Mordvins live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia; the rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg and Nizhny Novgorod, while others live in Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Central Asia, Siberia, the Russian Far East, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the United States. The Erzya Mordvins (, Erzyat; also Erzia, Erza), who speak Erzya, and the Moksha Mordvins (, Mokshet), who speak Moksha, are the two major groups. The Qaratay Mordvins live in the Kama Tamaƒüƒ± District of Tatarstan and speak a Tatar language - albeit with a large proportion of Mordvin vocabulary (substratum). The Teryukhan, living in the Nizhny Novgorod Oblast of Russia, switched to using Russian in the 19th century. The Teryukhans recognize the term Mordva as pertaining to themselves, whereas the Qaratay also call themselves Muksha. The Tengushev Mordvins live in southern Mordovia and form a transitional group between Moksha and Erzya. The western Erzyans are also called Shoksha (or Shoksho). They are isolated from the bulk of the Erzyans, and the Mokshan dialects have influenced their dialect/language. Names thumbMordva populi (Mordva people) shown on a 1550 map by Giacomo Gastaldi as residing south of Kasimov and Nizhny Novgorod While Robert G. Latham had identified Mordva as a self-designation, identifying it as a variant of the name Mari, Aleksey Shakhmatov in the early 20th century noted that Mordva was not used as a self-designation by the two Mordvinic tribes of the Erzya and Moksha. Nikolai Mokshin again states that the term has been used by the people as an internal self-defining term to constitute their common origin. The linguist G√°bor Zaicz underlines that the Mordvins do not use the name 'Mordvins' as a self-designation. Feoktistov wrote \\"So-called Tengushev Mordvins are Erzyans who speak [the] Erzyan dialect with Mokshan substratum and in fact they are [an ethnic] group of Erzyans usually referred to as Shokshas. [It] was [the] Erzyans who historically [were] referred to as Mordvins, and Mokshas usually were mentioned separately as \\"Mokshas\\".

A land called Mordia at a distance of ten days journey from the Petchenegs is mentioned in Constantine VII's De administrando imperio. In medieval European sources, the names Merdas, Merdinis, Merdium, Mordani, Mordua, Morduinos have appeared. In the Russian Primary Chronicle, the ethnonyms Mordva and mordvichi first appear in the 11th century. After the Mongol invasion of Rus', the name Mordvin rarely gets mentioned in Russian annals, and is only quoted after the Primary Chronicle up until the 15th‚Äì17th centuries.(Kirjanov 1971, 148‚Äì149) LasloKappeler (1982) Taagepera =Etymologies= The name Mordva is thought to originate from an Iranian (Scythian) word, mard, meaning \\"man\\". The Mordvin word mirde denoting a husband or spouse is traced to the same origin. This word is also probably related to the final syllable of \\"Udmurt\\", and also in and perhaps even in . The first written mention of Erzya is considered to be in a letter dated to 968 AD, by Joseph, the Khazar khagan, in the form of arisa, and sometimes thought to appear in the works of Strabo and Ptolemy as Aorsy and Arsiity, respectively. Estakhri, from the 10th century, has recorded among the three groups of the Rus people the al-arsanija, whose king lived in the town of Arsa. The people have sometimes been identified by scholars as Erzya, sometimes as the aru people, and also as Udmurts. It has been suggested by historians that the town Arsa may refer to either the modern Ryazan or Arsk In the 14th century, the name Erzya is considered to have been mentioned in the form of ardzhani by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani,(Sbornik... 1941, 96) see L√°szl√≥ and as rzjan by Jusuf, the Nogaj khan(Safargaliev 1964, 12) L√°szl√≥ In Russian sources, the ethnonym Erza first appears in the 18th century.(Mokshin 1977, 47) L√°szl√≥ The earliest written mention of Moksha, in the form of Moxel, is considered to be in the works of a 13th-century Flemish traveler, William of Rubruck, and in the Persian chronicle of Rashid-al-Din, who reported the Golden Horde to be at war with the Moksha and the Ardzhans (Erzia). In Russian sources, 'Moksha' appears from the 17th century.(Mokshin 1977, 47)L√°szl√≥ Ethnic structure The Mordvins are divided into two ethnic subgroups and three further subgroups:Mokshin (1995), p. 43. Latham in his account of the \\"Native Races of the Russian Empire\\" (1854) divided the Mordvins into three groups, viz. the Ersad, on the Oka River, the Mokshad, on the Sura River and the Karatai, in the neighbourhood of Kazan. * the Erzya people or Erzyans, (Erzya: –≠—Ä–∑—è—Ç/Erzyat), speakers of the Erzya language. Less than half of the Erzyans live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, Sura River and Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia and USA. * the Moksha people or Mokshans, (Moksha: –ú–æ–∫—à–µ—Ç/Mokshet), speakers of the Moksha language. Less than half of the Moksha population live in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, Russian Federation, in the basin of the Volga River. The rest are scattered over the Russian oblasts of Samara, Penza, Orenburg, as well as Tatarstan, Siberia, Far East, Armenia, Estonia, Australia and USA. *the Shoksha or Tengushev Mordvins constitute a transitional group between the Erzya and Moksha people and live in the southern part of Republic of Mordovia, in the Tengushevsk and Torbeevsk region. *the Karatai Mordvins or Qaratays live in the Republic of Tatarstan. They no longer speak a Volga-Finnic language but have assimilated with Tatars. *the Teryukhan Mordvins live near Nizhny Novgorod had been completely Russified by 1900 and today unambiguously identify as ethnic Russians. Mokshin concludes that the above grouping does not represent subdivisions of equal ethnotaxonomic order, and discounts Shoksha, Karatai and Teryukhan as ethnonyms, identifying two Mordvin sub-ethnicities, the Erzya and the Moksha, and two \\"ethnographic groups\\", the Shoksha and the Karatai.\\"the ethnic structure of the Mordva people at present reveals two subethnoses ‚Äì Erzia and Moksha ‚Äì and two ethnographic groups ‚Äì so-called Shoksha and Karatai\\" Mokshin (1995), p. 43 Two further formerly Mordvinic groups have assimilated to (Slavic and Turkic) superstrate influence: *The Meshcheryaks are believed to be Mordvins who have converted to Russian Orthodox Christianity and have adopted the Russian language. *The Mishars are Mordvins who came under Tatar influence and adopted the language (Mishar Tatar dialect) and the Sunni Muslim religion.Tengushev Mordvins, Karatai Mordvins, Teryukhan Mordvins, Meshcheryaks, Mishars in Religion Erzya practices Christianity (Eastern Orthodox and Lutheranism brought by Finnish missionaries in the 1990s) and Ineshkipaza, a native monotheistic religion with some elements of pantheism. Almost all national-oriented intellectuals practice Ineshkipazia or Lutheranism. Mariz‚Äô Kemal, well-known Erzyan poetess, is also an organizer of traditional Erzyan religion communities. This phenomenon appeared after formation of Mordovian diocese of ROC in 1990. In those days Erzyan intellectuals were hoping to introduce of Erzyan language into worship ceremonies as well as to revive of Erzyan religious and cultural identity, even within ROC structure. Failure of these hopes made many Erzyan believers more radical and stimulated national-oriented intellectuals to renew their ethnic Ineshkipaza religion. Appearance Erzya women of Penza Oblast dressed in traditional costumes The 1911 Britannica noted that the Mordvins, although they had largely abandoned their language, had \\"maintained a good deal of their old national dress, especially the women, whose profusely embroidered skirts, original hair-dress large ear-rings which sometimes are merely hare-tails, and numerous necklaces covering all the chest and consisting of all possible ornaments, easily distinguish them from Russian women.\\" Britannica described the Mordvins as having mostly dark hair and blue eyes, with a rather small and narrow build. The Moksha were described as having a darker skin and darker eyes than the Erzya, while the Qaratays were described as \\"mixed with Tatars\\". Latham described the Mordvins as taller than the Mari, with thin beards, flat faces and brown or red hair, red hair being more frequent among the Ersad than the Mokshad. James Bryce described \\"the peculiar Finnish physiognomy\\" of the Mordvin diaspora in Armenia, \\"transplanted hither from the Middle Volga at their own wish\\", as characterised by \\"broad and smooth faces, long eyes, a rather flattish nose\\". Cultures, folklores and mythologies An Erzya ritual performance in Podlesnaya Tavla, Mordovia According to Tatiana Deviatkina, although sharing some similarities, no common Mordvin mythology has emerged, and therefore the Erza and Moksha mythologies are defined separately. In the Erza mythology, the superior deities were hatched from an egg. The mother of gods is called Ange Patiai, followed by the Sun God, Chipaz, who gave birth to Nishkepaz; to the earth god, Mastoron kirdi; and to the wind god, Varmanpaz. From the union of Chipaz and the Harvest Mother, Norovava, was born the god of the underworld, Mastorpaz. The thunder god, Pur‚Äôginepaz, was born from Niskende Teitert, (the daughter of the mother of gods, Ange Patiai). The creation of the Earth is followed by the creation of the Sun, the Moon, humankind, and the Erza. Humans were created by Chipaz, the sun god, who, in one version, molded humankind from clay, while in another version, from soil. In Moksha mythology, the Supreme God is called Viarde Skai. According to the legends, the creation of the world went through several stages: first the Devil moistened the building material in his mouth and spat it out. The piece that was spat out grew into a plain, which was modeled unevenly, creating the chasms and the mountains. The first humans created by Viarde Skai could live for 700‚Äì800 years and were giants of 99 archinnes. The underworld in Mokshan mythology was ruled by Mastoratia. Latham reported strong pagan elements surviving Christianization. The 1911 Britannica noted how the Mordvins: History thumbEastern Europe c. 9th century =Prehistory= The Mordvins emerged from the common Volgaic group around the 1st century AD.Mokshin, p. 32 Proof that the Mordvins have long been settled in the vicinity of the Volga is also found in the fact that they still call the river Rav, reflecting the name Rha recorded by PtolemyPre- and Proto-historic Finns by Abercromby, pp. 8 (c. AD 100 ‚Äì c. 170). The Gorodets culture dating back to around 500 BC has been associated with these people. The north-western neighbours were the Muromians and Merians who spoke related Finno-Ugric languages. To the north of the Mordvins lived the Maris, to the south the Khazars. The Mordvins' eastern neighbors, possibly remnants of the Huns, became the Bolgars around 700 AD. Researchers have distinguished the ancestors of the Erzya and the Moksha from the mid-1st century AD by the different orientations of their burials and by elements of their costumes and the variety of bronze jewellery found by archaeologists in their ancient cemeteries. The Erzya graves from this era were oriented north-south, while the Moksha graves were found to be oriented south-north. The Mordvin language began to diverge into Moksha and Erzya over the course of the 1st millennium AD.Taagepera, p. 152Mokshin (1995), p. 33. Erzyans lived in the northern parts of the territory, close to present-day Nizhny Novgorod. The Mokshans lived further south and west of present-day Mordovia, closer to the neighbouring Iranian, Bolgar and Turkic tribes, and fell under their cultural influence. The social organization of Moksha and Erzya depended on patriarchy; the tribes were headed by elders kuda-ti who selected a tekshtai, senior elders responsible for coordinating wider regions. =Early history= Mordovian woman, 1781 Around 800 AD two major empires emerged in the neighborhood: Kievan Rus in present-day Ukraine and Russia adopted Eastern Orthodox Christianity, the Bolgar kingdom located at the confluence of Kama and Volga rivers adopted Islam, and some Moksha areas became tributaries to the latter until the 12th century. Following the foundation of Nizhny Novgorod by Kievan Rus in 1221, the Mordvin territory increasingly fell under Russian domination, pushing the Mordvin populations southwards and eastwards beyond the Urals, and reducing their cohesion. The Russian advance was halted by the Mongol Empire, and the Mordvins became subjects to Golden Horde until the beginning of 16th century. Christianization of the Mordvin peoples took place during the 16th to 18th centuries, and most Mordvins today adhere to the Russian Orthodox Church all carrying Russian Orthodox names. In the 19th century Latham reported strong pagan elements surviving Christianization, the chief gods of the Erzyans and the Mokshas being called Paas and Shkai, respectively. =Modern history= In the Russian Empire, the Mordvins were known as capable carpenters, and Ivan the Terrible used them to build bridges and clear forests during his advance on Kazan. Although the Mordvins were given an autonomous territory as a titular nation within the Soviet Union in 1928, Russification intensified during the 1930s, and knowledge of the Mordvin languages by the 1950s was in rapid decline. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Mordvins, like other indigenous peoples of Russia, experienced a rise in national consciousness. The Erzya national epic is called Mastorava, which stands for \\"Mother Earth\\". It was compiled by A. M. Sharonov and first published in 1994 in the Erzya language (it has since been translated into Moksha and Russian). Mastorava is also the name of a movement of ethnic separatism founded by D. Nadkin of the Mordovian State University, active in the early 1990s.Tatiana Mastyugina, Lev Perepelkin, Vitaliƒ≠ Vyacheslavovich Naumkin, Irina Zviagelskaia, An Ethnic History of Russia: Pre-revolutionary Times to the Present, Greenwood Publishing Group (1996), , p. 133; Timur Muzaev, ƒñtnicheskiƒ≠ separatizm v Rossii (1999), p. 166ff. Finno-Ugric peoples, whose territories were included in the former USSR as well as many others, had a very brief period of national revival in 1989-1991. Finno-Ugric peoples of Idel-Ural were able to conduct their own national conventions: Udmurts (November 1991), Erzya and Moksha (March 1992), Mari (October 1992), the united convention of Finno-Ugric folks of Russia in Izhevsk (May 1992). All these conventions accepted similar resolutions with appeals to democratize political and public life in their respective republics and to support the national revival of Finno-Ugric peoples. Estonia had strong influence on moods and opinions that dominated these conventions, (especially among national- oriented intellectuals) because many students at the University of Tartu were from Finno-Ugric republics of Russia. At the time of the Soviet Union‚Äôs disintegration, Erzya and Moksha accounted for only 32,5% in total structure of population in –ú–æ—Ä–¥–æ–≤—ñ—ó. The return of many Erzyans and Mokshans to their national identities was strongly challenged by Russification, urbanization and demographic crisis. In addition, part of Mokshan—à national elites (and Erzyan to a lesser extent) came forward with an idea, that Erzyans and Mokshans are just sub-ethnic groups within the united Mordovian nation. This concept was readily supported by Russian authorities, but most representatives of the Erzyan national movement reacted very negatively. National activists perceived the idea of ‚Äúunited Mordovian nation‚Äù as another tool for hard Russification. In 1989 Veƒ∫mema community center emerges in Mordovia. Very soon it becomes popular attracting both Erzyans and Mokshans. In some time only cultural activity becomes quite a narrow scope for part of radical activists, and Veƒ∫mema experiences a major split. Moderate members create Vajƒ£eƒ∫ organization focused on revival and popularization of national traditions, and a more radical group founded Mastorava, Erzan-Mokshan civic movement, that aims not only a cultural revival of both nations but also wants the presentation of their interests in government bodies.  National representative bodies  Erzya has its own system of national representative bodies. Every time before Raske≈Ñ ozks that takes place every three years, A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em (erz. Council of elders) is convened. A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em is a collective body that discusses the major problems of Erzyan people. A≈•a≈Ñ E≈∫em elects chief elder, Inyazor, by a secret ballot. Inyazor represents all Erzyan people till next Raske≈Ñ Ozks. During the period from 1999 through 2019 position of Inyazor was held by Kshumantsian‚ÄôPirguzh, who was awarded Order of the Cross of St. Mary‚Äôs Land (est. Maarjamaa Risti teenetem√§rk) by President of Estonia in 2014. In 2019 during regular Raske≈Ñ Ozks Syres‚Äô Boliayen‚Äô, chairman of Er≈∫a≈Ñ Val Society, co-founder of Free Idel-Ural civic movement was elected as new Inyazor. His candidature was supported by 12 from 18 elders. Russian authorities do not recognize the legitimacy of the national representative bodies of Erzyan people. Syres‚Äô Boliayen‚Äô is now in exile in Ukraine and representatives of A≈•a≈Ñ e≈∫em, as well as first Inyazor Kshumantsian‚ÄôPirguzh, repeatedly reported about political pressure from Russian authorities. According to Russian laws, the activity of national political parties (Erzya, Mari, Tatars, Chuvashs or any other) is forbidden. Consequently, the national representative agency of Erzya people is the only possible instrument to express the political aspirations of Erzya. Due to the activity of Veƒ∫mema, Vajƒ£eƒ∫ and Mastorava situation with human rights for Erzyans and Mokshans in Mordovia has changed significantly. Mordovian National theatre and faculty of national culture were founded in the republic, Language Law was adopted, productive relationships and contacts with foreign diaspores were established. Aforementioned organizations became a ‚Äútalent foundry‚Äù for new associations of Erzya and Moksha, namely Od Vij, Er≈∫ava, ƒπitova, and Jurhtava; as well as for Mastorava and Er≈∫a≈Ñ Mastor newspapers. Exactly due to the activity of all mentioned organizations and societies Erzyan and Mokshan national movements become able to progress from the ethnographic stage of their struggle to a political one.–í–ª–∞—Å—Ç–µ–π –ú–æ—Ä–¥–æ–≤–∏–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–∑–≤–∞–ª–∏ –Ω–µ –≤–º–µ—à–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –≤ –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–µ–π—à–∏–Ω —ç—Ä–∑—è–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞ https://www.idelreal.org/a/30062876.html At the end of the 1980s Pirguzh Kshumantsian‚Äô, human rights defender, and Mariz‚Äô Kemal, poetess, became leaders of Erzyan national movement. They revived the tradition of Raske≈Ñ Ozks (erz. Family Prayer). 5 days before the very first Raske≈Ñ Ozks Kshumantsian‚Äô, as main organizer of the event, was arrested by Russian authorities. Police forced him to abandon the realization of Prayer, however, he refused to comply with the demands. In 1999 Pirguzh Kshumantsian‚Äô was elected as the first Inyazor (chief elder) in the newest history of Erzyan people. He held this position up to 2019. Mariz‚Äô Kemal adhered to the principle of \\"Kavto keƒ∫≈• - kavto ra≈õke≈•\\" (erz. \\"Two languages - two nations\\"), that denied the existence of the single Mordovian nation as the combination of sub-ethnic groups, namely Erzya and Moksha. National life in the Republic of Mordovia began to draw down with the installation of Vladimir Putin‚Äôs rule. The new president of Russia considered national republics and native peoples as ‚Äúenemies inside‚Äù. May 1, 2020 Atyan‚Äô Ezem (erz. Elders‚Äô Council) approved new system of national representative bodies. Statute on creation and functioning of national representative bodies of Erzya people consists of six chapters, describing aims and tasks of Erzya national movement, its governing bodies, their plenary powers and structure. According to the document, national movement directed by Promks ‚Äì convention of delegates from Erzya political parties and public organizations. Convention forms Atyan‚Äô Ezem, that is operative between Promks sessions and elects Inyazor (Chief Elder), who presents Erzya people and speaks on behalf of all the nation. In the event that there are any legal limitations for creation and operation of national parties (such prohibition exists in Russian Federation nowadays), then plenary powers of Promks are carried by Atyan‚Äô Ezem. The main objective of Promks, Atyan‚Äô Ezem and Inyazor, is to provide and defend national, political, economic and cultural rights of Erzya, including right to national self- determination within national Erzya territories. Erzya approved structure of their national representative bodies http://idel-ural.org/en/archives/erzya- approved-structure-of-their-national-representative-bodies/ Languages The Mordvinic languages, a subgroup of the Uralic family, are Erzya and Moksha, with about 500,000 native speakers each. Both are official languages of Mordovia alongside Russian. The medieval Meshcherian language may have been Mordvinic, or close to Mordvinic. Erzya is spoken in the northern and eastern and north-western parts of Mordovia, as well as in the adjacent oblasts of Nizhny Novgorod, Penza, Samara, Saratov, Orenburg, and Ulyanovsk, and in the republics of Chuvashia, Tatarstan, and Bashkortostan. Moksha is the majority language in the western part of Mordovia. Due to differences in phonology, lexicon, and grammar, Erzya and Moksha are not mutually intelligible, to the extent that Russian language is often used for intergroup communications. The two Mordvinic languages also have separate literary forms. The Erzya literary language was created in 1922 and the Mokshan in 1923. Both are currently written using the standard Russian alphabet. Demographics Mordvins in the Volga-Urals region (2010 Russian census) Latham (1854) quoted a total population of 480,000. Mastyugina (1996) quotes 1.15 million. The 2002 Russian census reports 0.84 million. According to estimates by Tartu University made in the late 1970s, less than one third of Mordvins lived in the autonomous republic of Mordovia, in the basin of the Volga River. Others are scattered (2002) over the Russian oblasts of Samara (116,475), Penza (86,370), Orenburg (68,880) and Nizhni Novgorod (36,705), Ulyanovsk (61,100), Saratov (23,380), Moscow (22,850), Tatarstan (28,860), Chuvashia (18,686), Bashkortostan (31,932), Siberia (65,650), Russian Far East (29,265). Populations in parts of the former Soviet Union not now part of Russia are: Kyrgyz Republic 5,390, Turkmenistan 3,490, Uzbekistan 14,175, Kazakhstan, (34,370), Azerbaijan (1,150), Estonia (985), Armenia (920).

It is also known as \\"PZL P-37\\" or \\"PZL P.37\\", but the letter \\"P\\" was generally reserved for fighters of Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski's design (such as the PZL P.11).E.g. Cynk (1971, 1973, 1990, 2007) Upon its introduction to service, it was popularly considered to be not only the most modern and effective weapon then possessed by Poland, but also to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. From mid-1938 onwards, there was huge interest expressed by various nations in potential export sales of the PZL.37; in response to this highly favourable reception, PZL, being keen to meet the demands, developed additional variants that were intended for the export market, such as the PZL.37C (which was to be powered by a pair of Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines). An improved enlarged derivative, known as the PZL.49 Mi≈õ, was also developed for the Polish Air Force. The ≈Åo≈õ was extensively used in the defense of Poland during the rapid invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939. On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those actually saw active combat use due to aircraft being used by training units, being in maintenance, or having been held in reserve. The bombers suffered from a high attrition rate due to lack of fighter protection, and the final Polish combat missions were performed on 19 September. During October 1940, around 26-27 of the PZL.37s that had been evacuated from Poland were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft were subsequently used by the Royal Romanian Air Force, including offensive missions against the Soviet Union. Development =Background= Throughout the majority of the interwar period, the dominant military philosophies and practices within the leadership of Poland was that aircraft were of a secondary importance and a separate air-oriented service within the Polish Armed Forces would be of questionable value. Instead, it was decided to develop the nation's aviation assets to principally function as a means of providing aerial support to the newly formed Polish Land Forces. As such, a relatively minimal budget was allocated for aviation matters while no dedicated doctrine in respect to air power was developed, neither was an effective bomber force pursued in any form throughout much of this period and, when such a force was established, it was met with controversy and heavy criticism from officers who were sceptical that Poland required any bomber aircraft at all.Cynk 1973, p. 121. Despite this unpromising lack of interest, a separate service, known as the Wojska Lotnicze (Polish Air Force), had been formed during 1918. During the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War of 1919, there had been proposals mooted for the formation of a specialised bomber group equipped with modified Breguet 14 B2 biplanes; however, these were not quickly followed up upon due to a lack of understanding and appreciation amongst senior officers. During April 1920, the first Polish bomber squadron was stood up at Pozna≈Ñ‚Äì≈Åawica Airport, Greater Poland, equipped with a variety of captured ex-German aircraft such as Gotha G.IVs, AEG G.IVs, and Friedrichshafen G.IIIs. However, following the end of the conflict with the Soviets, this bomber squadron was amalgamated with a reconnaissance-orientated squadron.Cynk 1973, pp. 121-122. During 1920, the Polish Air Force heavily benefited from an extensive re-armament and expansion programme headed by General W≈Çodzimierz Zag√≥rski, under which the formation of dedicated bomber regiments was envisioned. Accordingly, an order was placed for 32 French-built Farman F.68 BN.4 Goliath twin-engined night bombers, with which it was intended to equip and launch these squadrons. An additional pair of army co-operation squadrons were repurposed as light bomber units instead, equipped with French Potez XV B2 aircraft. Unfortunately, Zag√≥rski's reforms were abandoned following the May Coup lead by J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski.Cynk 1973, p. 122. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, some officials within Poland remained interested in the establishment of a national bomber force, in some cases for prestige value rather than in terms of strict military value. During 1927, the Department of Aeronautics authorised the development of the Lublin R-VIII, a large single-engined reconnaissance bomber. In the following year, the department ordered Polish aviation manufacturer Pa≈Ñstwowe Zak≈Çady Lotnicze (PZL) to make preparations towards the development of a heavy multi-engined night bomber; while numerous proposals and design studies were made by both PZL and private factories, but none were approved for further development by the department.Cynk 1973, pp. 122-123. Instead, it was decided to procure a number of Dutch-built Fokker F.VII to meet the bomber role, the first of which being delivered during 1929, despite condemnation of the aircraft's poor defensive armament, limited payload capacity, and excessive weight.Cynk 1973, p. 123. =Emergence= Despite not being approved for further development, PZL decided to independently continue refining their designs for a multi- engined night bomber. These studies, led by aircraft engineer Wladyslaw Zalewski, developed an advanced concept, known as the PZL 3, for an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane bomber, which was intended to be powered by an arrangement of four Bristol Jupiter radial engines positioned in tandem pairs and armed with a pair of side-mounted gun turrets in addition to an internally-stowed bombload of 3,000 kg (6,613 lb). However, during December 1930, all work on this concept was abandoned as an economy measure and the construction of a prototype was abandoned. Reportedly, technical data for the PZL 3 was later received by French manufacturer Potez.Cynk 1973, pp. 123-124. During the 1930s, discussions were held regarding a potential replacement of Poland's Fokker F.VIIs. Numerous concepts were explored by the Department of Aeronautics, the most impressive submission was deemed to have been made by Polish aeronautical engineer Jerzy DƒÖbrowski, who had produced the initial proposals that would lead to the PZL.37 during spring 1934 and submitted to the department in July 1934. The concept was of a very quick monoplane bomber manned by a crew of four, featuring all-metal stressed-skin construction and powered by a pair of radial engines capable of producing 800-1,200 hp. The airframe was aerodynamically clean and was to be capable of very high performance, far in advance of contemporary bombers; wind tunnel testing using scale models of the aircraft were extremely encouraged.Cynk 1973, p. 124. During October 1934, the instruction to proceed with the proposal, initially designated P.37, was received by PZL.Cynk 1973, pp. 124-125. An express priority was placed upon performance over armament and equipment, relying upon its high speed for its defence; as such, only a single 7.7 mm machine gun was allocated to each turret position instead of the twin-guns and 20 mm dorsal cannon previously considered. On 14 April 1935, the department issued its approval of a full-scale wooden mock-up of the aircraft, authorising the construction of a pair of prototypes along with a structural test frame.Cynk 1973, p. 125. During early 1936, the necessity of revising the design's structure delayed the construction of the partially-assembled first prototype. During May 1936, the prototype commenced ground testing and taxiing trials; however, on 15 June, while being rolled out for its intended first flight, an engine failure was sustained prior to the attempt, resulting in its delay. On 30 June 1936, the first PZL.37/I prototype, which was fitted with a single vertical stabilizer, performed its maiden flight successfully. In August 1936, the initial factory tests were completed, after which the first prototype participated in official airworthiness and service trials. These revealed a handful of shortcomings, including rear fuselage flutter, excessive vibration on the instrumentation panel, overheating of the cylinder heads, and criticism of the cockpit's lack of space, however, test pilots were typically highly impressed with the aircraft. In response to the feedback from the first prototype's testing, several improvements and other modifications were made, some of which was introduced on the original prototype while more extensive changes were introduced upon the second prototype. This second prototype, known as PZL.37/II, featured the adoption of twin-vertical stabilizers, a re- worked cockpit and an altered ventral gun position amongst other changes, functioned as a representative aircraft of the anticipated production bomber and performed its first flight during autumn 1936.Cynk 1973, pp. 125-126. Suitably impressed, the department accepted the aircraft for production, placing an initial order for 10 pre-production aircraft, as well as bestowing a name upon the bomber, ≈Åo≈õ.Cynk 1973, p. 126. =Production= The second prototype of the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ Production of the ≈Åo≈õ commenced during the winter of 1936-1937. During 1938, the first 10 serial aircraft were manufactured, designated as the PZL.37A; these were furnished with a single vertical stabilizer. The next 19 interim aircraft were constructed to the PZL.37A bis standard, having been outfitted with the newer twin tail configuration. All of these aircraft were powered by the British-developed Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engine, which was produced in Poland under licence. The main production variant, the PZL.37B (or: ≈Åo≈õ II), was furnished with the twin tail arrangement along with newer Pegasus XX engines. During autumn 1938, production of the PZL.37B commenced for the Polish Air Force. During the initial period of service, 2 prototypes and 6 serial aircraft were lost in separate crashes; these had been caused by several technical problems, most of which involved the rudder. Following the implementation of some structural changes, the PZL.37B became a highly reliable aircraft. By the outbreak of the Second World War, roughly 92 PZL.37 bombers had been produced and delivered to the Polish Air Force, and a further 31 were in different phases of production. Prior to the Second World War, the PZL.37B ≈Åo≈õ was widely considered to be one of the most advanced bombers then operational in the world. It was able to carry a heavier bombload than considerably larger aircraft, such as the British-built Vickers Wellington, though the dimensions of the individual bombs were limited. Being smaller than most contemporary medium bombers, the ≈Åo≈õ was relatively fast and easy to handle. As a consequence of a favourable landing gear arrangement, having been fitted with double wheels, the bomber could operate from austere airstrips as well as rough fields or meadows. Typically amongst bombers of the late 1930s, its defensive armament consisted of only three machine guns, which subsequently proved too weak against enemy fighters in combat. =Export interest and further development= Starting with a presentation at a salon in Belgrade in June 1938 and in Paris in November, the PZL.37 met with a huge interest. For export purposes, new variants were developed: the PZL.37C with Gnome-Rhone 14N-0/1 radial engines of 985 cv (971 BHP, 724 kW), maximum speed 445 km/h and the PZL.37D with 14N-20/21 of 1,065 cv (1,050 BHP, 783 kW), maximum speed 460 km/h. In 1939, 20 PZL.37Cs were ordered by Yugoslavia, 12 by Bulgaria, 30 PZL.37Ds and license by Romania and 10, raw materials and parts for next 25 and license by Turkey and, finally, 12 aircraft for Greece.Glass 2008, p. 97. The Belgian company Constructions A√©ronautiques G. Renard was granted permission to perform the license production of between 20‚Äì50 aircraft for the Second Spanish Republic; however, the venture was abandoneded due to the victory of the opposing Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. In addition to the Belgian venture, it is known that Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Iran were all at various stages of negotiation for their own acquisitions of the type. The Polish military were not allowed to establish an arrangement with Iran due to \\"lack of production abilities\\". Nevertheless, the outbreak of the war acted to prevent the production of any of these aircraft. At that time, PZL developed the next variant for the Polish Air Force, the PZL.49 Mi≈õ, but this was not completed before the war. Possessing slightly bigger dimensions, the Mi≈õ (\\"Bear\\") was to be fitted with Bristol Hercules II radial engines of 1,350 BHP (1,370 cv, 1,007 kW), capable of a maximum speed of 520 km/h along with the addition of an upper turret. Design alt=A Polish PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ medium bomber aircraft The PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ was a twin-engined all-metal monoplane medium bomber.Cynk 1973, p. 141. It was relatively conventional in layout, being outfitted with low-set wings, a twin tail (on the majority of aircraft), and a metal-covered exterior. The aircraft was quite small for its bomb load and range; its capacity was achieved in part by a lift-generating, airfoil-shaped fuselage, which was another then-unusual feature (previously used e.g. on PZL.26 sports plane). It was much shorter and had smaller wings than many German and French counterparts; it was slightly larger than the Lockheed Model 10 Electra Amelia Earhart used. The crew consisted of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a forward machine gun. The radio operator sat inside the fuselage, above the bomb bay, and he also operated an underbelly rear machine gun. The ≈Åo≈õ featured retractable main undercarriage, which retracted into purpose- built alcoves located within the engine nacelles. The undercarriage was double-wheeled, complete with independent suspension for each wheel. The bomber was powered by a pair of Bristol Pegasus radial engines; the PZL.37A model had Pegasus XII B engines (normal power: 860 BHP (873 cv, 642 kW), maximum: 940 BHP (953 cv, 701 kW)), the PZL.37B variant had Pegasus XX engines (normal power: 905 HP (918 cv, 675 kW), maximum: 970 BHP (984 cv, 723 kW)). Originally, it was intended for a popular wing profile, designed by Ryszard Bartel (also used in many other successful Polish airframes incl. PZL P.11) to be used for the aircraft; however, the requirement of providing bomb storage with the internal space of the wings necessitated modification to the design. Some publications claim the resulting profile displayed laminar-flow properties (one of the first in the world), but this is disputed ‚Äì its shape which resembled laminar flow wings developed in later years, but this was largely fortuitous, and at any rate achieving the laminar flow regime would have required additional construction features (most importantly extremely smooth wings shaped with extreme precision)For the difficulties in achieving this in the first purposely designed airplane aiming at laminar flow, the P-51 Mustang, see which the aircraft simply lacked. However, the profile did display lower drag than expected and the initial PZL.37A version possessed a maximal speed 10 per cent higher than the originally planned 360 km/h. The modified profile was viewed as highly successful and was later re-used for other projects (sometimes in further modified form; e.g. PZL.46 Sum, PZL.49 Mi≈õ, PZL.50). The bomber's offensive payload was spread across a two-section bomb bay set within the fuselage (providing space for up to 4 bombs) and a total of 8 compact bomb bays located in the central section of the wings (which had space for a maximum of 16 bombs). This arrangement of bomb bays imposed considerable restrictions on the types of bombs that could be carried, especially in the wing bays which were quite small due to the need to fit between the ribs of the wing. The maximum load was 2,580 kg (2 √ó 300 kg and 18 √ó 110 kg). Apart from a pair of 300 kg bombs in one of the fuselage bomb bays, it could not carry bombs larger than 110 kg. When flown at the maximum loadout, the majority of the weight of the bombs was carried inside the wings. There were no provisions for mounting bombs on the outside of the aircraft. During the invasion of Poland in 1939, 110 kg was the maximum weight used, since the 300 kg bombs were available only in small quantities, and were difficult to load at improvised airfields with little infrastructure. 50 kg bombs were also used. Maximal bomb load taken from soft surface runways was reduced to about 800‚Äì1200 kg. Operational history =Poland= During early 1938, the Polish Air Force started to receive the ≈Åos A variant;Air International October 1988, p. 197. it was followed by deliveries of the improved PZL.37B to operational units, which had been slowed by delays in supply of the Pegasus XX engines and other equipment, during the autumn of 1938.Air International October 1988, pp. 216‚Äì217. On 1 September 1939, the Polish Air Force had roughly 86 PZL.37s in total, but less than a half of those were used in combat. 36 PZL.37Bs were in four bomber escadres of a Bomber Brigade: the 11th, 12th, 16th and 17th escadres (two escadres with nine aircraft each, constituted a group, in Polish: dywizjon; the PZL.37 were in groups X and XV). The remainder of the Bomber Brigade's aircraft were PZL.23 Kara≈õ. About 50 remaining PZL.37s were assigned to the reserve XX group, training units or in repairs. As a consequence of there only having been a few months available to train the crews and complete the equipping of the bombers, the planes were not fully ready when the war broke out. For example, the extra internal fuel tanks for the type were not yet in service, thus the maximum range of the bomber that had been quoted in specifications was in practice not achievable. A group of Polish Air Force PZL.37 bombers on the ground, 1939 Only the PZL.37s of the Bomber Brigade actively participated in the defence of Poland. By 1 September, they had been deployed to rural improvised airfields, so they were not destroyed on the ground by the Germans in their initial attack on the main Polish airbases.Cynk 1973, p. 137. However, because of this move away from developed airfields to short fields with poor surfaces, during the campaign the planes could take off with only a fraction of their maximum bomb load (typically 800 kg or 8 x 100 kg bombs), which limited their effectiveness. During the invasion of Poland, from 4 September onward the planes of the Bomber Brigade were attacking German armoured columns in day attacks, forced by the desperate situation to perform this mission for which they were not designed (the original plans to bomb targets inside Germany were quickly abandoned).Cynk 1973, pp. 137-137. Most notably, they hampered the advance of the XVI Army Corps near Czƒôstochowa and Radomsko. During these engagements, the PZL.37 suffered heavy losses as a result of a lack of adequate fighter protection, which was further amplified by the operational tactics employed, usually flying missions in units of no more than three aircraft at a time. The last combat flights took place on 16 September.Cynk 1973, p. 138. During the campaign, the combat units were reinforced with several other aircraft, and about 46 PZL.37s were used in combat. Of the Bomber Brigade aircraft, ten PZL.37s were shot down by fighters, five shot down by enemy anti-aircraft artillery, two bombed on the ground and a further ten lost in other ways. A number of not fully completed, training or reserve PZL.37s were also destroyed on airfields and in factories (18 PZL.37s were bombed in a reserve base in Ma≈Çaszewicze and in a factory in Warsaw ‚Äì Okƒôcie). =Captured aircraft= Twenty-six or twenty-seven Polish Air Force PZL.37s (17 from the Bomber Brigade and ten training ones) were withdrawn in 1939 to Romania. During October 1940, these aircraft were seized by the Romanian government and 23 of these aircraft would be used by the Romanian Air Force in the 4th Group, consisting of the 76th and 77th bomber escadres.Cynk 1973, pp. 138-139. Some were uparmed with four machine guns (the Polish PWU machineguns were still used). About one third were lost in crashes due to lack of experience of Romanian pilots with the PZL.37's handling and its high wing loading, and due to engine faults. About 15 were used in combat against the Soviet Union from 22 June 1941. Among others, they first operated in Bessarabia, while they were later used to conduct bombing missions targeting Kiev and Odessa. Some of the bombers were lost on these missions, mostly due to anti-aircraft fire. Because of a lack of spare parts, the remaining planes were withdrawn from the front in October 1941; after this, the type was mainly used for training. During April 1944, the 76th escadrille returned to combat, with nine aircraft, but it was withdrawn from the front on 3 May 1944. After Romania joined the Allies, on 1 September 1944, German aircraft destroyed five PZL.37s on the ground during retaliatory attacks against Romanian targets. Additionally, a number of captured planes underwent testing by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.Cynk 1973, p. 139. Relatively few PZL.37s fell into German hands, probably only two aircraft; this is partially due to the efforts of Polish factory workers who scrapped roughly 30 PZL.37s that remained in factories in Okƒôcie and Mielec, under the pretext of cleaning up the area, during October 1939, before the German authorities were able to reconnoiter. Preserved parts and models of PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ There are no surviving PZL.37 aircraft. An original PZL Pegaz 20 engine of the type used in PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ is in the collection of the Polish Aviation Museum in Krak√≥w. This engine was sent from Poland to the United States in the spring of 1939 to be exhibited at the 1939 New York World's Fair and thus survived the war, and was returned to Poland in 2006.Serce \\"≈Åosia\\" wr√≥ci≈Ço do Polski ‚Äì page from the Polish Aviation Museum website, includes galleries A 1:1 scale non-flying model of PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ was assembled at PZL Mielec factory, in the factory hall used to construct these bombers before the war.

Once the Federal ten-day waiting period has passed, the Franchise Agreement becomes a State level jurisdiction document. Each state has unique laws regarding franchise agreements. A franchise agreement contents can vary significantly in content depending upon the franchise system, the state jurisdiction of the franchisor, franchisee, and arbitrator. It overall provides the investor with a product, a branded name and recognition, and a support system. A typical franchise agreement contains * Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) * Disclosures required by state laws * Parties defined in the agreement * Recitals, such as Ownership of System, and Objectives of Parties * Definitions, such as :Agreement, Territory Area, Area Licensee, Authorized deductions, Gross Receipts, License Network, The System Manual, Trademarks, Start Date, Trade name, Termination, Transfer of license. * Licensed Rights, such as :Territory, Rights Reserved, Term and Renewal, Minimum Performance Standard * Franchisors Services, such as :Administration, Collections and Billing, Consultation, Marketing, Manual, Training * Franchisee Payments, such as :Initial Franchise Fee, Training Fees, Marketing Fund, Royalties, Renewal fee, and Transfer fee * Franchisee Obligations, such as :Use of Trademarks, Financial Information, Insurance, Financial and Legal responsibility * Relationship of Parties, such as :Confidentiality, Indemnification, Non-Compete clauses * Transfer of License, such as :Consent of franchisor, Termination of license, Termination by licensee * Other provisions * Governing law * Amendments * Waivers * Arbitration * Severability See also *American Association of Franchisees and Dealers *Franchise consulting *Franchise Disclosure Document *Franchise fraud *Franchise termination *Franchising *List of franchises *The Franchise Rule *U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission References Terms and conditions of franchise agreement External links *International Franchise Association *American Association of Franchisees and Dealers *Franchise Brokers Association *FTC Franchise FAQ Page Contract law ","title":"Franchise agreement"},{"id":"599052","text":"A shotgun wedding is a wedding that is arranged to avoid embarrassment due to premarital sex possibly leading to an unintended pregnancy, rather than out of the desire of the participants. The phrase is a primarily American colloquialism, termed as such based on a stereotypical scenario where the father of the pregnant bride-to-be threatens the reluctant groom with a shotgun to ensure that he follows through with the wedding.  Rationale  One purpose of such a wedding can be to get recourse from the man for the act of impregnation; another reason is trying to ensure that the child is raised by both parents. In some cases, as in early America and in the Middle East, a major objective was the restoring of social honour to the mother. The practice is a loophole method of preventing the birth of legally illegitimate children, or if the marriage occurs early enough, to conceal the fact that conception occurred prior to marriage. In some societies the stigma attached to pregnancy out of wedlock can be enormous, and coercive means (in spite of the legal defense of undue influence) for gaining recourse are often seen as the prospective father-in-law's \\"right\\", and an important, albeit unconventional, coming of age event for the young father-to-be. Often a couple will arrange a shotgun wedding without explicit outside encouragement, and some religious teachings consider it a moral imperative to marry in that situation.  By culture  =Asia= West Asia Pre-marital sexual relations remain taboo across all social strata throughout the Middle East. In many cases, fornication is illegal and even a criminal offence. Even when it is not, the social response can be extreme, especially against women who have lost their virginity prior to marriage. In this cultural milieu, shotgun weddings serve to obscure the fact that a baby was conceived prior to marriage. When that proves impossible, the social standing of the couple involved is irreparably damaged. Nevertheless, shotgun weddings serve to prevent the individuals involved, especially the women, from becoming social pariahs. Apart from instances of regional slang, there is no special term for \\"shotgun weddings\\" in Arabic. This is because they are not recognised as a regular social phenomenon and because a successful Middle Eastern shotgun wedding is not known to be a shotgun wedding by the guests.  East Asia  Marriages preceded by pregnancy by age in Japan (2010). *In Japan, the slang term , or for short, emerged in the late 1990s. The term can literally be translated as \\"oops-we-did-it-marriage,\\" implying an unintended pregnancy. Notable celebrities with these marriages include Namie Amuro, Takako Uehara, Y≈çko Oginome, Hitomi Furuya, Ami Suzuki, Kaori Iida, Nozomi Tsuji, Anna Tsuchiya, Meisa Kuroki, Leah Dizon, Melody Miyuki Ishikawa, Riisa Naka, Rie Miyazawa and Emi Takei.Haruna Kashiwase, \\"Shotgun Weddings a Sign of the Times in Japan,\\" Population Today, July 2002, prb.org \\"Japan embraces shotgun weddings\\". Telegraph. June 22, 2009. Retrieved July 25, 2010. A quarter of all Japanese brides are pregnant at the time of their wedding, according to the Health Labor and Welfare Ministry, and pregnancy is one of the most common motivations for marriage. The prevalence and celebrity profile of dekichatta- kon has inspired Japan's wedding industry to introduce an even more benign phrase, . *In China, the term Â•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©ö () means that the couple married because conception occurred outside of marriage. It is a pun on the phrase Â•âÊó®ÊàêÂ©ö, pronounced Fengzhichenghun and implying that a wedding is approved by imperial edict. It is becoming increasingly common among China's youngest generation. However, in the same age group, there is objection and criticism to such a practice.Â•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©öÊàêÂ∏∏ÁèæË±° \\"Â§ßËÇöÊñ∞Â®ò\\"ÊåëÊà∞ÂÇ≥Áµ±Ë≤ûÊìç Married by the child became a norm, \\"Pregnant brides\\" are challenging the traditional chastity.‚ÄúÂ•âÂ≠êÊàêÂ©ö‚ÄùÊåëÊàò‰º†ÁªüÈÅìÂæ∑Â∫ïÁ∫ø \\"Married by the Child\\" challenging traditional marital limits. *In Korea, the slang term ÏÜçÎèÑÏúÑÎ∞ò (RR: Sokdowiban; literally: \\"speeding over the limit\\") refers to the situation in which the pregnancy preceded the marriage. *In Vietnam, the term \\"B√°c sƒ© b·∫£o c∆∞·ªõi\\" (literally meaning \\"because [the] doctor said so\\") is often used with humorous intention. =Southeast Asia= *The Philippines also has a shotgun wedding tradition wherein a man shall be forced to marry a woman whom he impregnates. Other forms of this tradition include a girl's parents forcing the man to marry their daughter due to the latter's social status or wealth (rather than his desire to marry the girl) and others. Firearms may or may not be used during the coercion but other forms of threats include litigation (which is common in cases of impregnation wherein the girl's family threatens to file rape charges against the man). *Indonesia has a similar condition with the Philippines; this is usually called \\"married by accident\\". = Europe = Because of the sexual revolution beginning in the 1960s, the concepts of love, sexuality, procreation and marriage began to separate after being intimately entangled in social consciousness for centuries. However, sexual practice had not always followed social convention, resulting in shotgun or Knobstick weddings. *In the United Kingdom, one source reports that almost 40% of all brides were pregnant in 1850. Quoted at *In Denmark, a 1963 study found that 50% of all brides were pregnant. *In the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch term moetje was a commonly used euphemism for marriage resulting from unintended pregnancy. The noun is formed from imperative of the verb moeten (\\"must\\", \\"to have to\\") with the added suffix -je, indicating a diminutive. Thus, it might be translated as a \\"little must\\" or a \\"little you-have-to\\", i.e. one is compelled to marry to avoid the shame of giving birth out of wedlock. Moetjes were a common occurrence in Belgium and the Netherlands until the first half of the 20th century. In the early 1960s, about a quarter of all marriages in the Netherlands were shotgun marriages; however, in some areas, up to 90% of the brides were pregnant. By the late 2000s, the practice had become so rare that the term was growing obsolete. According to a 2013 by the Centrum voor Leesonderzoek, the word moetje was recognised by 82.5% of the Dutch and 43.1% of the Flemish.Woordenkennis van Nederlanders en Vlamingen anno 2013, p. 679. Centrum voor Leesonderzoek. = North America = *In the United States, the use of duress or violent coercion to marry is no longer common, although many anecdotal stories and folk songs record instances of such coercion in 18th- and 19th-century America. The phenomenon has become less common as the stigma associated with out-of-wedlock births has declined and the number of such births has increased. Effective birth control and legalized abortion have also resulted in fewer unplanned pregnancies carried to term. Nonetheless a marriage which occurs when the bride is pregnant, even when there is no family or social pressure involved, is still sometimes referred to as a \\"shotgun wedding\\".

Equity is measured by comparing the ratio of contributions (or costs) and benefits (or rewards) for each person. Considered one of the justice theories, equity theory was first developed in the 1960s by J. Stacy Adams, a workplace and behavioral psychologist, who asserted that employees seek to maintain equity between the inputs that they bring to a job and the outcomes that they receive from it against the perceived inputs and outcomes of others (Adams, 1963). According to Equity Theory, in order to maximize individuals' rewards, we tend to create systems where resources can be fairly divided amongst members of a group. Inequalities in relationships will cause those within it to be unhappy to a degree proportional to the amount of inequality. The belief is that people value fair treatment which causes them to be motivated to keep the fairness maintained within the relationships of their co-workers and the organization. The structure of equity in the workplace is based on the ratio of inputs to outcomes. Inputs are the contributions made by the employee for the organization. Background Equity theory focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. It proposes that individuals who perceive themselves as either under-rewarded or over-rewarded will experience distress, and that this distress leads to efforts to restore equity within the relationship. It focuses on determining whether the distribution of resources is fair to both relational partners. Equity is measured by comparing the ratios of contributions and benefits of each person within the relationship. Partners do not have to receive equal benefits (such as receiving the same amount of love, care, and financial security) or make equal contributions (such as investing the same amount of effort, time, and financial resources), as long as the ratio between these benefits and contributions is similar. Much like other prevalent theories of motivation, such as Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, equity theory acknowledges that subtle and variable individual factors affect each person‚Äôs assessment and perception of their relationship with their relational partners (Guerrero et al., 2005). According to Adams (1965), anger is induced by underpayment inequity and guilt is induced with overpayment equity (Spector 2008). Payment whether hourly wage or salary, is the main concern and therefore the cause of equity or inequity in most cases. In any position, an employee wants to feel that their contributions and work performance are being rewarded with their pay. If an employee feels underpaid then it will result in the employee feeling hostile towards the organization and perhaps their co-workers, which may result in the employee not performing well at work anymore. It is the subtle variables that also play an important role in the feeling of equity. Just the idea of recognition for the job performance and the mere act of thanking the employee will cause a feeling of satisfaction and therefore help the employee feel worthwhile and have better outcomes. =Definition of equity= Individuals compare their job inputs and outcomes with those of others and then respond to eliminate any perceived inequities. Referent Comparisons: =Inputs and outcomes= Inputs Inputs are defined as each participant‚Äôs contributions to the relational exchange and are viewed as entitling him/her to rewards or costs. The inputs that a participant contributes to a relationship can be either assets ‚Äì entitling him/her to rewards ‚Äì or liabilities - entitling him/her to costs. The entitlement to rewards or costs ascribed to each input vary depending on the relational setting. In industrial settings, assets such as capital and manual labor are seen as \\"relevant inputs\\" ‚Äì inputs that legitimately entitle the contributor to rewards. In social settings, assets such as physical beauty and kindness are generally seen as assets entitling the possessor to social rewards. Individual traits such as boorishness and cruelty are seen as liabilities entitling the possessor to costs (Walster, Traupmann & Walster, 1978). Inputs typically include any of the following: * Time *Education *Œïxperience *Effort * Loyalty *Hard Work *Commitment *Ability *Adaptability * Flexibility * Tolerance *Determination * Enthusiasm *Personal sacrifice *Trust in supervisors *Support from co-workers and colleagues *Skill Outcomes Outputs are defined as the positive and negative consequences that an individual perceives a participant has incurred as a consequence of his/her relationship with another. When the ratio of inputs to outputs is close, then the employee should have much satisfaction with their job. Outputs can be both tangible and intangible. Typical outputs include any of the following: * Job security * Salary * Employee benefit *Expenses *Recognition * Reputation * Responsibility *Sense of achievement *Praise *Thanks *Stimuli =Propositions= Equity theory consists of four propositions: ; self-inside: Individuals seek to maximize their outcomes (where outcomes are defined as rewards minus costs). ; self-outside: Groups can maximize collective rewards by developing accepted systems for equitably apportioning rewards and costs among members. Systems of equity will evolve within groups, and members will attempt to induce other members to accept and adhere to these systems. The only way groups can induce members to equitably behave is by making it more profitable to behave equitably than inequitably. Thus, groups will generally reward members who treat others equitably and generally punish (increase the cost for) members who treat others inequitably. ; others-inside: When individuals find themselves participating in inequitable relationships, they become distressed. The more inequitable the relationship, the more distress individuals feel. According to equity theory, both the person who gets \\"too much\\" and the person who gets \\"too little\\" feel distressed. The person who gets too much may feel guilt or shame. The person who gets too little may feel angry or humiliated. ; other-outside: Individuals who perceive that they are in an inequitable relationship attempt to eliminate their distress by restoring equity. The greater the inequity, the more distress people feel and the more they try to restore equity. (Walster, Traupmann and Walster, 1978) In business Equity theory has been widely applied to business settings by industrial psychologists to describe the relationship between an employee's motivation and his or her perception of equitable or inequitable treatment. In a business setting, the relevant dyadic relationship is that between employee and employer. As in marriage and other contractual dyadic relationships, equity theory assumes that employees seek to maintain an equitable ratio between the inputs they bring to the relationship and the outcomes they receive from it (Adams, 1965). Equity theory in business, however, introduces the concept of social comparison, whereby employees evaluate their own input/output ratios based on their comparison with the input/outcome ratios of other employees (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). Inputs in this context include the employee‚Äôs time, expertise, qualifications, experience, intangible personal qualities such as drive and ambition, and interpersonal skills. Outcomes include monetary compensation, perquisites (\\"perks\\"), benefits, and flexible work arrangements. Employees who perceive inequity will seek to reduce it, either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (\\"cognitive distortion\\"), directly altering inputs and/or outcomes, or leaving the organization (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). These perceptions of inequity are perceptions of organizational justice, or more specifically, injustice. Subsequently, the theory has wide-reaching implications for employee morale, efficiency, productivity, and turnover. =Assumptions of equity theory applied to business= The three primary assumptions applied to most business applications of equity theory can be summarized as follows: # Employees expect a fair return for what they contribute to their jobs, a concept referred to as the \\"equity norm\\". # Employees determine what their equitable return should be after comparing their inputs and outcomes with those of their coworkers. This concept is referred to as \\"social comparison\\". # Employees who perceive themselves as being in an inequitable situation will seek to reduce the inequity either by distorting inputs and/or outcomes in their own minds (\\"cognitive distortion\\"), by directly altering inputs and/or outputs, or by leaving the organization. (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978)'''' =Implications for managers= Equity theory has several implications for business managers: *People measure the totals of their inputs and outcomes. This means a working mother may accept lower monetary compensation in return for more flexible working hours. *Different employees ascribe personal values to inputs and outcomes. Thus, two employees of equal experience and qualification performing the same work for the same pay may have quite different perceptions of the fairness of the deal. *Employees are able to adjust for purchasing power and local market conditions. Thus a teacher from Alberta may accept lower compensation than his colleague in Toronto if his cost of living is different, while a teacher in a remote African village may accept a totally different pay structure. *Although it may be acceptable for more senior staff to receive higher compensation, there are limits to the balance of the scales of equity and employees can find excessive executive pay demotivating. *Staff perceptions of inputs and outcomes of themselves and others may be incorrect, and perceptions need to be managed effectively. *An employee who believes he is overcompensated may increase his effort. However he may also adjust the values that he ascribes to his own personal inputs. It may be that he or she internalizes a sense of superiority and actually decrease his efforts. Criticisms and related theories Criticism has been directed toward both the assumptions and practical application of equity theory. Scholars have questioned the simplicity of the model, arguing that a number of demographic and psychological variables affect people's perceptions of fairness and interactions with others. Furthermore, much of the research supporting the basic propositions of equity theory has been conducted in laboratory settings, and thus has questionable applicability to real-world situations (Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987). Critics have also argued that people might perceive equity/inequity not only in terms of the specific inputs and outcomes of a relationship, but also in terms of the overarching system that determines those inputs and outputs. Thus, in a business setting, one might feel that his or her compensation is equitable to other employees', but one might view the entire compensation system as unfair (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). Researchers have offered numerous magnifying and competing perspectives: =Equity sensitivity construct= The Equity Sensitivity Construct proposes that individuals have different preferences for equity and thus react in different ways to perceived equity and inequity. Preferences can be expressed on a continuum from preferences for extreme under-benefit to preferences for extreme over-benefit. Three archetypal classes are as follows: *Benevolent individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be less than those of their relational partner. In other words, the benevolent prefers to be under-benefited. *Equity Sensitives, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to be equal to those of their relational partner. *Entitled individuals, those who prefer their own input/outcome ratios to exceed those of their relational partner. In other words, the entitled prefers to be over-benefited. (Huseman, Hatfield & Miles, 1987) =Fairness model= The Fairness Model proposes an alternative measure of equity/inequity to the relational partner or \\"comparison person\\" of standard equity theory. According to the Fairness Model, an individual judges the overall \\"fairness\\" of a relationship by comparing their inputs and outcomes with an internally derived standard. The Fairness Model thus allows for the perceived equity/inequity of the overarching system to be incorporated into individuals' evaluations of their relationships (Carrell and Dittrich, 1978). =Game theory= Behavioral economics has recently started to apply game theory to the study of equity theory. For instance, Gill and Stone (2010) analyze how considerations of equity influence behavior in strategic settings in which people compete and develop the implications for optimal labor contracts.

There are two types of scapulars, the monastic and devotional scapular, although both forms may simply be referred to as \\"scapular\\".J L Neve, 2007, Churches and Sects of Christendom page 158Catherine Fournier, 2007, Marian Devotion in the Domestic Church Ignatius Press page 18 As an object of popular piety, it serves to remind the wearers of their commitment to live a Christian life. The \\"monastic scapular\\" appeared first, perhaps as early as the 7th century in the Order of Saint Benedict.Mackenzie Edward Charles Walcott, 2008, Sacred Archaeology Kessinger Publishing page 70 It is a somewhat large length of cloth suspended both front and back from the shoulders of the wearer, often reaching to the knees. It may vary in shape, color, size and style. Monastic scapulars originated as aprons worn by medieval monks, and were later extended to habits for members of religious organizations, orders or confraternities. Monastic scapulars now form part of the habit of monks and nuns in many Christian orders.William Johnston, Encyclopedia of Monasticism page 310 The \\"devotional scapular\\" is a much smaller item and evolved from the monastic scapular. These may also be worn by individuals who are not members of a monastic order. The devotional scapular typically consists of two small (usually rectangular) pieces of cloth, wood or laminated paper, a few inches in size, which may bear religious images or text. These are joined by two bands of cloth and the wearer places one square on the chest, rests the bands one on each shoulder and lets the second square drop down the back.James O'Toole, 2005, Habits of Devotion: Catholic Religious Practice in Twentieth-Century America, Cornell University Press page 98Matthew Bunson, 2004, Encyclopedia of Catholic History, OSV Press page 804 In many cases, both forms of the scapular come with a set of promises for the faithful who wear them. Some of the promises are rooted in tradition. For Roman Catholics, over the centuries several popes have approved specific indulgences for scapulars, as for some other objects of popular piety.Frances Andrews, 2006, The Other Friars: The Carmelite, Augustinian, Sack and Pied Friars in the Middle Ages, page 33Samuel Phillips Day, 2009, Monastic institutions BiblioLife page 108 History Abba Antony of Egypt depicted wearing a brown monastic scapular and cloak The scapular may have emerged from an apron-like piece of cloth worn by monks. Item 55 of the Rule of Saint Benedict, dating to the 7th century refers to the use of the scapular.Robert Maguire, 2008, Papal Indulgences: Two Lectures Kessinger Publishing page 53Andre Vauchez, 2001, Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, Fitzroy Dearborn Press page 1314Terryl Nancy Kinder, 2002, Cistercian Europe, Eardman Press page 59Rule of St Benedict (RB) ch. 55.4-6: \\"‚Ä¶ in temperate regions for each monk a \\"hood(ed cloak)\\"(? cucullam, cowl) and tunic will suffice ‚Äì in winter a woolen \\"hood(ed cloak)\\"(? cucullam, cowl) is necessary, in summer a thinner or worn one ‚Äì, and a scapular for work, and footwear: socks (pedules, slip-shoes) and shoes ‚Ä¶\\" Timothy Fry, \\"RB 1980\\", p. 262, comments: \\"This word (scapulare) is found in antiquity only here in RB and in Vita patr. iuren. 3.5, where it appears as a summer garment. De Vog√º√© 6.916 thinks it is a modified version of the cuculla specially adapted for work. It clearly derives from the Latin scapula, meaning \\"shoulders\\", and it may reasonably be concluded that it was a sleeveless or short-sleeved garment ‚Ä¶ However, A. Guillaumont, \\"√âvagre le Pontique: Trait√© Pratique\\" (SC 171, Paris, √âditions du Cerf 1971, p. 488), suggests that the scapular may be the equivalent to the Greek analabos, which Cassian (inst. 1,5) translates uncertainly by three terms: subcinctoria, redimicula and rebracchiatoria, the purpose of which is to fasten the tunic for work.\\"RB 55.6 has unspecific \\"work\\", not \\"manual work\\" (in RB 48.1 called \\"manual labour\\"), whilst elsewhere there is mention of the \\"Work of God\\", arguably not only in connection with prayer (e.g. RB 7.63, 22.6, 58.7). Apparently therefore RB regards both prayer and labour as \\"work\\". Thus, whether in the oratory or in the fields, a monk is always at work, and so a \\"scapular for work\\" is to be worn always. RB 22.5 supports those who hold that it is meant to be worn even during the night rest. These considerations support the view that St Benedict meant the scapular to be worn not as protective wear but for a symbolic reason, such as with regard to the purpose of the monk in the monastery. The monks' purpose is evident from RB's own purpose, which is a compilation of precepts for those who wish by \\"the labour of obedience to return to him from whom they had drifted through the sloth of disobedience\\" (RB Prol 2) and therefore, in response to \\"the Lord seeking his workman in the multitude of people\\" (RB Prol 14), undergo \\"teaching\\" in \\"a school of the Lord's service\\" (RB Prol 45-50)... A light or minimal item of clothing, as has been suggested on linguistic grounds, would be better suited to a symbolic than a protective use. In the Catholic Church the key elements of a monk's habit eventually became the tunic, the cincture, the scapular and the hood. A nun's clothing included the tunic, the scapular and the head veil.William Johnston, Encyclopedia of Monasticism page 309 Some authors interpret the scapular as a symbolic apron based on the fact that monks and nuns, when engaged on some manual labor, tend to cover it with a protective apron or carefully tuck it up or throw the front length back over their shoulder to prevent it from getting in the way.Terrence Kardong, 1996, Benedict's Rule: A Translation and Commentary Liturgical Press page 444 Varieties =Monastic scapular= Carthusians in white hooded scapulars, by Francisco de Zurbar√°n, 1630‚Äì1635 Today, the monastic scapular is part of the garb, the habit, of many Christian religious orders, of both monks and nuns. It is an outer garment about the width of the chest, from shoulder to shoulder. It hangs down in the front and back almost to the feet, but is open on the sides (it was originally joined by straps at the waist). It is related to the analavos worn in the Eastern tradition. Historically, the monastic scapular was at times referred to as scutum (i.e. shield), as it was laid over the head, which it originally covered and protected with one portion (from which the hood afterwards developed). A specific aspect of the use of the monastic scapular from its earliest days was obedience and the term jugum Christi, i.e. \\"yoke of Christ\\", was used to refer to it. The term \\"yoke of Christ\\" signified obedience and removing a scapular was like removing the yoke of Christ, i.e. rebelling against authority. For instance, the Carmelite constitution of 1281 prescribed that the scapular should be worn to bed under penalty of serious fault, and the constitution of 1369 included automatic excommunication for a Carmelite saying Mass without a scapular.John Welch, 1996, The Carmelite Way Paulist Press page 58Father Kieran Kavanaugh, 2008, Scapular Devotion Discalced Carmelite nuns from Argentina wearing the Brown Scapular Over the centuries the religious orders adapted the basic scapular as they considered appropriate for themselves, as a result of which there are now several distinct designs, colors, shapes and lengths in use. The Carthusians and others attached a hood to their scapular, rather than keeping the former a separate item of their habit, while some, like the Dominican Order or Carmelites, wear it beneath another layer, like a shoulder cape or capuce (that is, the \\"hood\\"). The color selection could change over time; for instance, prior to 1255, the Augustinian scapulars for novices were black and those of the lay brethren were white, but thereafter all scapulars but those of the lay brethren had to be white.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold, Miller Press, page 89 In some cases the monastic scapular was used to distinguish the rank or level of the wearer within a religious order. For instance, in some Byzantine monastic practices, two levels of fully professed monk or nun exist: those of the \\"little habit\\" and those other of the \\"great habit\\", these being more senior and not having to do manual labor. In these cases, the \\"great habit\\" was simply distinguished from the \\"little habit\\" by the addition of a scapular decorated with the instruments of the Passion.Aleksei Pentkovsky, 1999, The Pilgrim's Tale Paulist Press page 43 Just as the stole is the vestment that came to mark the office of a priest, the monastic scapular became the equivalent for those in the monastic life and even today, a long scapular identifies its wearer as a member of a religious order. It is a symbol of the confraternal way, combining in itself the principle of ora et labora (prayer and work), and so the form was later adopted by pious laity who wished to have an open sign of their devotion. =Non-monastic reduced scapular= Some authors suggest that the tradition of wearing a reduced form of a non-monastic scapular started in the 11th century with Saint Peter Damian and the monastic scapular was gradually transformed from an item of clothing that was part of the habit of monks and nuns to a smaller item that expressed devotion by individuals, called oblates, who lived in the world, but wished to be affiliated with a monastery.Greg Dues, 1992, Catholic Customs and Traditions, Twenty-Third Publications pages 127 and 185 In the Middle Ages, it became common for Christian faithful to share in the spirituality of the new mendicant orders in an auxiliary sense, sometimes called Third Orders because they were founded after the initial orders of the friars and nuns. Although these people (called Tertiaries) were permitted to wear the \\"tertiary habit\\", because they had not taken religious vows they were not usually permitted to wear the full habit of the order. With time, it was considered a high honor and great privilege to be granted a small cloth attached by bands which would be worn over the torso in the same manner as the full monastic scapular. Confraternities came to be formed in which people would be granted the wearing of this item as a mark of their sharing in the good works of a particular order.Ann Ball, 2003 Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices page 512 Among Franciscans, they were known as Cordbearers, due to their also wearing a small cord around the waist in imitation of the one worn by the friar. After the disruptions of religious life during the period of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic invasions of France and Italy, wearing of the tertiary habit became prohibited. Thus it eventually became common that a smaller form of an order's scapular would be bestowed upon the non-monastic. Rather than a full length of cloth, it consisted of two rectangles (several inches wide, and much larger than a modern devotional scapular) of wool joined by bands in some fashion. These are still worn today by the \\"Third Order\\" members of the Franciscans, Carmelites, and Dominicans. In order to gain the benefits of the order, the members must wear these scapulae constantly. However, in 1883 in his \\"Constitution On the Law of the Franciscan Third Order\\" called Misericors Dei Filius, Pope Leo XIII declared that wearing either these medium-sized scapulae of the \\"Third Order\\" or the miniature forms of the smaller devotional scapular entitled the wearer equally to gain the indulgences associated with the order.Misericors Dei Filius at the Franciscan Archive Some religious orders still give a short version (sometimes called the \\"reduced scapular\\", but this usage is archaic) of their large scapular to non-monastics that are spiritually affiliated with them. Such short scapulars are designed to be unobtrusive and can be worn under regular clothing at home and at work. =Devotional scapular= The devotional scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel or Brown Scapular Devotional scapulars are objects of popular piety, primarily worn by Roman Catholics, as well as some Anglicans and Lutherans, designed to show the wearer's pledge to a confraternity, a saint, or a way of life, as well as reminding the wearer of that promise. Some devotional scapulars bear images, or verses from scripture. Devotional scapulars typically consist of two rectangular pieces of cloth, wool or other fabric that are connected by bands. One rectangle hangs over the chest of the wearer, while the other rests on the back, with the bands running over the shoulders. Some scapulars have extra bands running under the arms and connecting the rectangles to prevent them from getting dislodged underneath the wearer's top layer of clothes. Rosary and scapular The roots of devotional scapulars can be traced to the gathering of laity into confraternities for spiritual direction, whereby the faithful would be assigned some badge or token of affiliation and devotion. The image or message on the scapular usually reflects the order's focus, tradition or favored devotion.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold: Instructions for Converts, and Enquirers, Miller Press, page 300 Devotional scapulars and the indulgences attached to them grew along with the growth of Catholic confraternities during the 17th and 18th centuries. The fact that specific promises and indulgences were attached to the wearing of scapulars helped increase their following, as was seen with the early example of the Brown Scapular, habit of the Carmelites.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 263 This promise was based on the Carmelite tradition that the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England in 1251 in answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order and recommended the Brown Scapular of the Our Lady of Mount Carmel to him and promised salvation for the faithful who wore it piously.Donovan STL, Colin. \\"Brown Scapular\\", EWTNMatthew Bunson, 2008, The Catholic Almanac, page 155Gerald M. Costello, 2001, Treasury of Catholic Stories, OSV Press, , page 128 Regardless of the scholarly debates regarding the exact origin of the Brown Scapular, it is clear that it has been a part of the Carmelite habit since the late 13th century. Our Lady of Mount Carmel statue in Chile with a Brown Scapular, an example of the use of the scapular in Marian art The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception that dates to 1617 was eventually granted a significant number of indulgences, and many graces were promised to those who would honor the Immaculate Conception by wearing the Blue Scapular and live chastely according to their state in life. In 1885 Pope Leo XIII approved the Scapular of the Holy Face, (also known as The Veronica) and elevated the Priests of the Holy Face to an archconfraternity.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 506 He also approved the Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the Scapular of St. Joseph, both in 1893, and the Scapular of the Sacred Heart in 1900.Francis de Zulueta, 2008, Early Steps In The Fold, Miller Press, page 317 In 1611, the Servite Order's confraternity and their Black Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary received indulgences from Pope Paul V.Henry Charles Lea, 2002, A History of Auricular Confession and Indulgences in the Latin Church, Adamant Media Corp. page 469 During the 19th century, a number of other Scapulars were approved. The green Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was approved by Pope Pius IX in 1877 and the white Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel received the approval of Leo XIII in 1893 for the purpose of invoking Mary's guidance upon its wearer. The black Scapular of Our Lady Help of the Sick, (for the Confraternity founded by St. Camillus de Lellis) was approved by Pius IX in 1860. In 1863 he also approved the Green Scapular, which is not from a Confraternity but an image inspired by a vision of the Blessed Mother experienced by Sr. Justine Bisqueyburu from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul. By the early 20th century the devotional scapular had gained such a strong following among Catholics worldwide that Joseph Hilgers, in the Catholic Encyclopedia of 1912 stated: \\"Like the rosary, [the Brown Scapular] has become the badge of the devout Catholic\\". In the 1917 reported apparitions of Our Lady of F√°tima the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared \\"with a Rosary in one hand and a scapular in the other\\". Sister L√∫cia (one of the three F√°tima children visionaries) stated that the Virgin Mary told her: \\"The Rosary and the Scapular are inseparable\\".Thomas W. Petrisk, 1998, The Fatima Prophecies, St. Andrews Press, page 345Lucia Santos, 1976, Fatima in Lucia's Own Words, Ravengate Press Lynette Marie Ordaz, 2008, The Real Mary, Authorhouse Books, page 88 In the United States \\"Scapular Magazine\\" helped enroll one million Americans to pray the Rosary based on the Fatima messages.Eli Lederhendler, 2006 Jews, Catholics, and the Burden of History Oxford University Press page 98 The Rosary and the devotional scapular continue to be linked in the 21st century.Zenit News 2008 Cardinal Urges Devotion to Rosary and Scapular While a number of scapulars (e.g. the Scapular of the Holy Face, also known as The Veronica) are entirely Christocentric, the most widespread scapulars (including the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception) relate to Marian devotions and consecrations.Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception John Paul II stated that he received his first Brown Scapular of Mount Carmel at age ten when his Marian devotion was taking shape and he continued to wear it into his papacy.Pope John Paul II, 1996, Gift And Mystery, Doubleday Books page 28 The Catholic Encyclopedia lists 18 small scapulars approved by the Roman Catholic church: # The White Scapular of the Most Blessed Trinity (1193) # The White Scapular of Our Lady of Ransom (1218) # The Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (1250) # The Black Scapular of the Seven Sorrows of Mary (1255) # The Blue Scapular of the Immaculate Conception # The Red Scapular of the Most Precious Blood # The Black Scapular of the Passion (1720) # The Red Scapular of the Passion (1846) # The Black Scapular of Help of the Sick (1860) # The White Scapular of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (1877) # The Blue and Black Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel (1880) # The Scapular of St. Benedict (1882) # The Scapular of the Holy Face (1885) # The White Scapular of the Our Lady of Good Counsel (1893) # The White Scapular of St. Joseph (1898) # The White Scapular of The Most Sacred Heart of Jesus (1900) # The Scapular of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (1901) # The White Scapular of St. Dominic (1903) Of all the types recognized by the Roman Catholic Church the best-known, and perhaps the most popular, is the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, sometimes referred to as the Brown Scapular from the color of its bands. The wearing of a devotional scapular has been viewed as a constant meditation by Bishop Leo De Goesbriand: \\"Wherever I am, whatever I am doing, Mary never sees me without seeing upon my body an evidence of my devotion to her.\\"L. De Goesbriand 2008, Meditations for the Use of the Secular Clergy page 408 This scapular, with its history in Britain, along with the Scapular of Our Lady of Walsingham are also popular devotions in the Anglican Church. The Green Scapular, \\"instituted for the conversion of those without faith\\" is another popular scapular among the Christian community. From a spiritual viewpoint, Father Etienne Richer argues that devotional scapular is one of key Roman Catholic devotions that harmonize with Catholic Liturgy in the meditative process.Raymond Burke, 2008, Mariology: A Guide for Priests, Deacons,seminarians, and Consecrated Persons, Queenship Publishing page 667 =In Protestant churches= Scapular wearing is sometimes found in Protestant churches including Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist. Instructions are provided in United Methodist Church allowing scapular to be worn over the alb by anyone lay or clergy, not as a pastoral stole or chasuble, either colored for the Church season or not.https://www.umcdiscipleship.org/resources/12-simple-rules-on-what-to-wear- what-not-to-wear-umc-edition referenced 23-June-2019 Some Anglican churches use the scapular to designate the difference of vestments between choristers boys and girlshttps://lincolncathedral.com/worship-music/chorister-lincoln- cathedral/ referenced 23-June-2019http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/choristers-from-the-salisbury- cathedral-choir-practice-ahead-of-the-picture-id158668662?s=612x612 referenced 23-June-2019, a tradition that continues in Church of South India for women and men.https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jEZOBpwt5uc/maxresdefault.jpg referenced 8 July 2019 Lutheran churches sometimes use scapulars as vestments for both men and women servershttp://trinitywv.org/worship-music.html referenced 23-June-2019 over cassocks which are regarded as clerical clothinghttp://download.elca.org/ELCA%20Resource%20Repository/What_are_vestments_and_paraments_Why_are_they_used.pdf referenced 23-June-2109 not vestments. Scapulars in Protestant churches do not necessarily have the same meaning as in Catholic church. Choirs may wear scapular over alb in Lutheran colleges. Investment, blessing and rules Though each scapular has its own particular qualifications and usage, the Roman Catholic Church has set down certain rules that pertain to all its types, be they monastic or devotional. A scapular associated with a confraternity must be invested by an ordained representative of that group. A scapular associated with a mystery or devotion may simply be blessed by a priest and given to the wearer. To receive the benefits or indulgences granted the scapular generally must be worn constantly. It may be placed aside for a time but, during that period, the wearer does not receive the scapular's benefits. Should the wearer take up the wearing of it again, the benefits are again conferred. A devotional scapular must be in good repair with both bands intact. Multiple scapulae may be worn on the same bands, but the bands must be the color of those prescribed by the scapular with the most preeminence, and that scapular must be foremost with the others behind in order of precedence. If a scapular becomes damaged to the point where it cannot be in good repair, it must be replaced. However, it is not necessary for the wearer to be reinvested as it is the devotion of the wearer, not the object itself, that confers the benefit of the scapular.

It has a long history dating back to the Achaemenid period. In ancient times, it was one of the main centers of the Academy of Gondishapur. Etymology The word Ahvaz is a modern Persianized form of the Arabic \\"Ahwaz\\" which in turn, is derived from an older Persian word. The Dehkhoda Dictionary specifically defines the \\"Suq-al-Ahvaz\\" as \\"Market of the Khuzis\\", where \\"Suq\\" is the Elamite word for market, and \\"Ahvaz\\" is a broken plural () of the form \\"af'ƒÅl\\" () of the word \\"Huz\\", which itself comes from the Persian Huz, from Achaemenid inscriptions where the term first appears. Thus, \\"Ahvaz\\" in Persian means \\"the Huz-i people\\", which refers to the Khuzi original inhabitants of Kh≈´zestƒÅn. The name of the region appears in medieval Syriac sources as ', literally meaning \\"land of the Huzis\\". The term \\"Huz\\", meanwhile, is the Old Persian rendition of Suz (Susa-Susiana), the native Elamite name of the region. See Origin of the name Khuzestan and Elam#Etymology for more details. History =Ancient history= Ahvaz is the analog of \\"Avaz\\" and \\"Avaja\\" which appear in Darius's epigraph. This word appears in Naqsh-Rostam inscription as \\"Khaja\\" or \\"Khooja\\" too. First named ≈åhrmazd-Arda≈°ƒìr (Persian: Hormizdartazir)Dodgeon M. H. and Lieu S. N. C., The Roman Eastern Frontier and The Persian Wars; A Documentary History, London (1991), p.35; it was built near the beginning of the Sassanid dynasty on what historians believe to have been the site of the old city of Taryana, a notable city under the Persian Achaemenid dynasty, or the city of Aginis referred to in Greek sources where Nearchus and his fleet entered the Pafitigris.. It was founded either by Ardashir I in 230 (cf. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, al-Muqaddasi, et al.) or (according to the Middle Persian ≈†ahrestƒÅnƒ´hƒÅ ƒ´ ƒírƒÅn≈°ahr) by his grandson Hormizd I; the cities name either combined Ardashir's name with the Zoroastrian name for God, ≈åhrmazd or Hormizd's name with that of his grandfather. It became the seat of the province, and was also referred to as H≈´m≈°ƒìr. During the Sassanid era, an irrigation system and several dams were constructed, and the city prospered. Examples of Sassanid-era dams are Band-e Bala-rud, Band-e Mizan, Band-e Borj Ayar and Band-e Khak. The city replaced Susa, the ancient capital of Susiana, as the capital of what was then called KhuzestƒÅn. The city had two sections; the nobles of the city lived in one part while the other was inhabited by merchants.cf. Encyclop√¶dia Iranica When the Arabs invaded the area in 640, the part of the city home to the nobility was demolished but the H≈´j-ƒ´-stƒÅnwƒÅƒçƒÅr \\"Market of Kh≈´z State\\", the merchant area, remained intact. The city was therefore renamed S≈´q al-AhwƒÅz, \\"Market of the Khuz\\", a semi-literal translation of the Persian name of this quarter - AhwƒÅz being the Arabic broken plural of H√ªz, taken from the ancient Persian term for the native Elamite peoples, H≈´ja (remaining in medieval kh≈´zƒ´g \\"of the Khuzh\\" and modern KhuzestƒÅn \\"Khuz State\\", as noted by Dehkhoda dictionary). =Medieval history= During the Umayyad and Abbasid eras, Ahvaz flourished as a center for the cultivation of sugarcane and as the home of many well- known scholars. It is discussed by such respected medieval historians and geographers as ibn Hawqal, Tabari, Istakhri, al-Muqaddasi, Ya'qubi, Masudi, and Mostowfi Qazvini. Nearby stood the Academy of Gundishapur, where the modern-day teaching hospital is said to have been first established. Ahvaz was devastated in the Mongol invasions of the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently declined into a village. The dam and irrigation channels, no longer maintained, eroded and finally collapsed early in the 19th century. During this time Ahvaz was primarily inhabited by the original Khuzhis and a small number of Sabians. Although most Arab migrants fled the city, a few stayed. Some minor cultivation continued, while all evidence of sugarcane plantations is still going on in Haft Teppe area in north of Ahvaz, although ruins of sugarcane mills from the medieval era remained in existence.X. de Planhol, Encyclop√¶dia Iranica Several ruins of water mills also still remain in Shush and Shushtar. = Modern history = The seat of the province has, for the most of its history, been in its northern reaches, first at Susa (Shush) and then at Shushtar. During a short spell in the Sasanian era, the capital of the province was moved to its geographical center, where the river town of Hormuz-Ardashir (modern Ahvaz). However, later in the Sasanian time and throughout the Islamic era, the provincial seat returned and stayed at Shushtar, until the late Qajar period. With the increase in the international sea commerce arriving on the shores of Khuzestan, Ahvaz became a more suitable location for the provincial capital. The River Karun is navigable all the way to Ahvaz (above which, the Karun flows through rapids). The town was thus refurbished by the order of the Qajar king, Naser al-Din Shah and renamed after him, N√¢seri. Shushtar quickly declined, while Ahvaz/N√¢seri prospered to the present day. In the 19th century, \\"Ahvaz was no more than a small borough inhabited mainly by Sabeans (1,500 to 2,000 inhabitants according to Ainsworth in 1835; 700 according to Curzon in 1890).\\"Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, p.690, see entry: Ahvaz In the 1880s, under Qajar rule, the Karun River was dredged and re-opened to commerce. A newly built railway crossed the Karun at Ahvaz. The city again became a commercial crossroads, linking river and rail traffic. The construction of the Suez Canal further stimulated trade. A port city was built near the old village of Ahvaz, and named Bandar-e-Naseri in honor of Nassereddin Shah Qajar. Oil was found near Ahvaz in the early 20th century, and the city once again grew and prospered as a result of this newfound wealth. From 1897 to 1925, the city of Ahvaz was in the hands of heshmatoddoleh Ghajar, who acted as governor and Sarhang Reza Gholi Khane Arghoon commander of Ghajari's army based in Khuzestan. Sheikh Khaz'al was recognized by Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar as hereditary ruler of Mohammerah, Sardar Asad Bakhtiari as the most powerful leader of Khuzestan's Bakhtiaries. He had power and authority over most regions of Khuzestan, such as Dezful, Shushtar, Izeh, even Ahvaz and Amir mojahede bakhtiari in Ramhormoz and Behbahan. At this time, the newly founded Ahvaz was named N√¢seri in honour to its founder Nassereddin Shah Qajar. Afterwards, during the Pahlavi period, it resumed its old name, Ahvaz. The government of the Kh≈´zestƒÅn Province was transferred there from Sh√ªshtar in 1926. The Trans-Iranian Railway reached Ahvaz in 1929 and by World War II, Ahvaz had become the principal built-up area of the interior of Kh≈´zestƒÅn. Professional segregation remained well marked between various groups in that period still feebly integrated: Persians, sub-groupings of Persians and Arabs. Natives of the Isfahan region held an important place in retail trade, owners of cafes and hotels and as craftsmen.Ibid, p.690 Iraq attempted to annex Kh≈´zestƒÅn and Ahvaz in 1980, resulting in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War (1980‚Äì1988). Ahvaz was close to the front lines and suffered badly during the war. Iraq had pressed its claims to Kh≈´zestƒÅn. Iraq had hoped to exacerbate ethnic tensions and win over popular support for the invaders. Most accounts say that the Iranian Arab inhabitants resisted the Iraqis rather than welcome them as liberators. However, some Iranian Arabs claim that as a minority they face discrimination from the central government; they agitate for the right to preserve their cultural and linguistic distinction and more provincial autonomy. See Politics of Kh≈´zestƒÅn. In 1989, the Foolad Ahvaz steel facility was built close to the town. This company is best known for its company-sponsored football club, Foolad F.C., which was the champion of Iran's Premier Football League in 2005. In 2005 the city witnessed a series of bomb explosions. Many government sources relate these events to developments in Iraq, accusing foreign governments of organizing and funding Arab separatist groups. The Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz claimed credit for several of the bombings, including four bombs on 12 June 2005, that killed 8 people.Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahwaz MIPT Terror Knowledge Base Gunmen killed at least 29 people in an attack on a crowd watching a military parade on 22 September 2018.

In contrast to traditionalADS Chapter 479 Hours of Duty work arrangements that require employees to work a standard 9a.m. to 5p.m. day, flextime typically involves a \\"core\\" period of the day during which employees are required to be at work (e.g., between 11a.m. and 3p.m.), and a \\"bandwidth\\" period within which all required hours must be worked (e.g., between 5:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.). The working day outside of the \\"core\\" period is \\"flexible time\\", in which employees can choose when they work, subject to achieving total daily, weekly or monthly hours within the \\"bandwidth\\" period set by employers, and subject to the necessary work being done. The total working time required of employees on flextime schedules is the same as that required under traditional work schedules. A flextime policy allows staff to determine when they will work, while a flexplace policy allows staff to determine where they will work. Advantages include allowing employees to coordinate their work hours with public transport schedules, with the schedules of their children, and with daily traffic patterns to avoid high congestion times such as rush hour. Some claim that flexible working will change the nature of the way we work. The idea of flextime was invented by Christel Kammerer.

For four decades, academic papers have contributed to the increased knowledge and interest in flexible working. A descriptive background of the evolution of the concept of flexibility as well as highlighting the main factors contributed to its growth were the main focus of academic studies.Lambert, A.D., Marler, J.H. & Gueutal, H.G., 2008.

Unlike what many assume, women do not have better access to flexitime arrangements, and female-dominated workplaces have worse access to flexitime compared to workplaces where there are more men or equal number of men and women.Chung, H. (2018) 'Women's Work Penalty' in access to flexible working arrangements across Europe. European Journal of Industrial Relations. Many studies examine the outcomes of flexible working.

International Journal of Manpower, 29(6), pp.539‚Äì566 based on a sample of European countries, gave a deep analysis of the concept of flexible working by testing the level of heterogeneity in the effect of flexibility on job satisfaction and found some positive link with some aspects of the job while negative or no relation was found against other aspects. There is increasing evidence for the \\"business case\\" of flexible working. A meta analysis of studies have shown that flexible working can provide a wide range of benefits for companies, including increase in performance, productivity, and reduction in absenteeism etc.de Menezes, LM and Kelliher, C. (2011) Flexible Working and Performance: A Systematic Review of the Evidence for a Business Case. International Journal of Management Reviews 13(4): 452-474. Flexible working can both prevent and create opportunities. There is generally a positive relationship between flexible working and perceptions of job quality in term of work-life balance and helping to improve and control autonomy particularly for remote workers, but some factors such as opportunities for advancement will be negatively affected due to the variations on different dimensions of job quality.Kelliher, C. & Anderson, D., 2008.

Flexible employment is one of the vital factors in the European Union policy discourse. It is a means to reduce unemployment, increase economic and social cohesion, maintain economic competitiveness and enhance equal opportunities between women and men.Perrons, D., 1999. Flexible Working Patterns and Equal Opportunities in the European Union Conflict or Compatibility? European Journal of International Law Journal of women study. 6 (4), pp.391-418 However, flexible working is not without problems. Studies have also shown that flexible working can lead to increase in overtime hours.  The European Commission  In 2017, the European Commission proposed the Directive on Work-Life Balance which includes the extension of the right to request flexible working arrangements (reduced working hours, flexible working hours and flexibility in place of work) to all working parents of children up to 12 and carers with dependent relatives. It also includes non legislative measures ensuring protection against discrimination and dismissal for parents (including pregnant women and workers coming back from a leave) and carers, and encouraging a gender-balanced use of family-related leaves and flexible working arrangements.  United Kingdom  Haller founded a company in the UK in 1971 and registered the trademark \\"Flextime\\", the mark remains the property of that company's successor hfx Ltd. In spring 2003, 17.7% of men and 26.7% of women were employed with flexitime arrangements in the United Kingdom, (Office for National Statistics 2003). In the United Kingdom, flexitime working is commonplace in both the private and public sectors. The practice is often found in administrative and back office functions of commercial organisations and local councils. In 2003, the UK Government introduced legislation that gave parents of children under 6, or the parents of disabled children under 18, the right in law to request a flexible working arrangement from their employer. A survey in 2005 by the National Office of Statistics showed that 71% of female workers and 60% of male workers were aware of the rights created under the 2003 legislation. Between 2003 and 2005 more than 14% of all workers had requested a change to flexible working. Since April 2007 the right to request flexible working also applies to carers of adults. On 13 November 2012 Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees, this legislation takes effect in April 2014. Lawyers have suggested that this will lead to \\"major headaches\\" for employers. Now being enforced by the law on 30 June 2014, industrial reports concentrate on workers right to request for flexible working and how it is guided by Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS). They explained how this code is designed to help employers, employees and their representatives dealing with disciplinary and grievance situations in the workplace.ACAS, 2009.

Shift workers are generally excluded from flextime schemes as are senior managers. Other groups of workers for whom flextime arrangements are rare include those who serve the public during specific opening times. The advantages of Flextime for the individual include a better work-life balance, fewer commutes, less fatigue, more days off, lower sickness rates. The benefits for the company include; better motivated workers, more efficient and effective operation, less fatigued workers, so fewer errors; they get people working overtime hours without paying overtime rates, fewer facilities required, and lower sickness rates. For employers, flextime can aid the recruitment and retention of staff. It has been a particularly popular option in 2009 for employers trying to reduce staff costs without having to make redundancies during the recession. It can also help provide staff cover outside normal working hours and reduce the need for overtime. Additionally flextime can also improve the provision of equal opportunities to staff unable to work standard hours. Flextime can give employees greater freedom to organize their working lives to suit personal needs. In addition, travelling can be cheaper and easier if it is out of peak time.  United States  In Florida, flextime workers, like salaried workers, are exempted from insurance regulations, and are given broad leeway in setting their own work schedule. Unlike exempted salaried workers, employers are still required to pay overtime to a flextime worker if they work more than 40 hours per week. In recent years, the term \\"flextime\\" has acquired a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation's overtime regulations. Under one such proposal by the Bush administration made public on August 5, 2004, employers would not be required to pay non-exempt employees overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two-week period. For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week. Such arrangements are opposed by trade unions such as the AFL-CIO. In certain industries and disciplines, such as information technology, flextime permits workers to vary their schedule. For example, they may opt to work four 10-hour days per week, taking Monday or Friday off. Another flextime schedule is to work nine-hour days Monday through Thursday, an eight-hour day on Friday, taking every other Friday off. Some agencies of the United States government allow employees to work such a schedule, and designate it as an alternative work schedule (AWS).FEDweek, The 2014 Federal Employees Handbook (2013). Workers may arrange to coordinate their days off so that their responsibilities are adequately covered. Other workers may opt simply to come in early, such as 5 or 6a.m., and leave in the mid-afternoon, or come in late and therefore leave late. One benefit of such a schedule is that commuting times occur outside of the congested rush hour traffic within a given geographic region. Flextime arrangements also help parents: one parent works 10a.m. ‚Äì 6p.m. and is in charge of the children before school / daycare, while the other parent works 7a.m. ‚Äì 3p.m. and is in charge of the children after school / daycare. This allows parents time to commute. Flextime is also beneficial to workers pursuing an education. It is an ongoing part of the work-life balance discussions in many companies.  Australia  Flexi-time in Australia is usually referred to accumulated overtime hours that an employee can build up and exchange for the equivalent amount of time off. (Example: Jane works 7a.m. ‚Äì 3p.m. Monday to Friday. Over the past month, Jane has worked 8 hours overtime meaning she is eligible for a paid day off.) If employees accumulate too many flex hours, they are required to perform a \\"flex burndown\\", as they are burning down the flex. Similarly, taking a flex day off is known as \\"flexing\\". It is implemented formally in the federal Australian Public Service and is available for staff in most state and territory government departments. With current changes to industrial relations laws (2006), from State to Federal level there are no new published guidelines (online) for flexi-time.  Recording working  There are many different methods used for recording working time ranging from sophisticated software (computer programs) to handwritten time sheets. Most of these methods are associated with the payment of wages in return for hours worked. As a result, they often do not address a fundamental difference of most flexible working systems ‚Äì namely the intention of flexible working to allow an employee to \\"trade hours\\" with their employer in return for a fixed wage ().  Millennials  \\"Millennial\\" is the name most commonly used to describe those born between 1980 and 2000. As the right to request for flexible working is extended to all by law, many benefits are expected to rise. With \\"Millennials\\" becoming the interest of many organisations, flexible working seems to attract them.BBC, 2014. Flexible working rights extended to all. [Online]. Available at: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-28078690. Accessed 3 February 2015. As ethnic diversity and high level of education are their main characteristics, it is seen that Millennials are more likely to change their jobs more than the previous generation for economic reasons. Additionally, due to the delay in the retirement of baby boomers' generation, gaps in workforce were created, waiting for the Millennial generation to fill them.Red Tree Leadership & Development, 2012, The Millennial Takeover. Visually website. [Online]. Available at: http://visual.ly/millennial-takeover. Accessed 4 February 2015.  Advantages and criticisms  Flexible working is a pattern of working arrangements that enable employees to decide the time, duration, and location of their work.Fell, S.S., 2013. Top 10 Benefits of Flexible Work Policies for Companies. Available at: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sara-sutton- fell/top-10-benefits-of-flexib_b_4158603.html Flexible working patterns have gained the interest of both academics and industrial practitioners for some time, with implementation into law in certain countries as far back as 1930, but also in recent years. Existing literature highlights the fundamental importance of flexible working to both academics and organizations as a means of establishing a good work‚Äìlife balance for employees; work-life balance for employees is theorized to increase employee efficiency, which in turns leads to increase in productivity of the organisation.Silla, I., 2005. Job Insecurity and Health-Related Outcomes among Different Types of Temporary Workers. Economic and Industrial Democracy, 26(1), pp.89‚Äì117Guest, D., 2004. Flexible employment contracts, the psychological contract and employee outcomes: an analysis and review of the evidence. International Journal of Management Reviews, 5-6(1), pp.1‚Äì19 This would also be suggested from research on the decreasing returns of working hours. Academic literature has identified benefits of flexible working patterns to employees including life satisfaction, better wellbeing, a good work-life balance,Stanger, M., 2014. Companies That Offer Flexible Schedules Get More Out Of Their Employees. Available at: http://www.businessinsider.com/most-flexible-employers- according-to-payscale-2013-1 and health benefits but some researchers argue that although there are such benefits, there are some negative effect such as work intensity, job insecurity associated with flexible working arrangement. Research works such as Evans et al., (2000) also highlight that flexible working pattern may not be applicable to all occupational fields, the authors also heighted the medical profession as one of such fields.Evans, J., Goldacra, M. & Lambert, T., 2000. Views of UK medical graduates about ¬Ø exible and part-time working in medicine : a qualitative study., pp.355‚Äì362 A further critique is that some patterns of work deemed \\"flexible\\" such as a compressed work week may be put forward by the employer, rather than suiting the individual employee, and thus may not capture the same benefits as employee- chosen flexible working. Industrial sources also have been able to highlight one of the positive effects of flexible working patterns as being able to attract highly qualified professionals, but BrookinsBrookins, M., 2015. Negatives of Flexible Work Schedules. Available at: http://smallbusiness.chron.com/negatives-flexible-work-schedules-1236.html established some negative effects flexible working patterns had to employers as it adds expenses and responsibility on the organisation, negative availability perspectives of employees on the customers, and employee availability. Both academics and industrial sources were established that in some professions flexible working arrangement may not be available or its availability will have a negative perspective on employees by others with a non-flexible arrangement, example of such profession is the medical profession. The researcher done by Evans et al., (2000) on flexible working patterns in the medical profession emphasized how some medical doctors may attributes negative perception with colleagues with flexible working pattern. In 1930, Employees in the United Kingdom were given the right to request for flexible working arrangement, but there was no instructions or guideline on the way for this would work. Flexible working concept is also a relatively new form of working arrangement and this has limited its application in other parts of the world such as some region in Africa. Flexible working patterns is a working arrangement that enable employees to determine the duration, time and location of their work. It has been seen both by academics and industrial sources to have benefit sure as increase of work-life balance for employee, which in turns leads to increase in productivity for the employer or organisation. Organisations hoping to adopt this form of working pattern for its employee should conduct research on how flexible working pattern can be successfully conducted, thus avoiding some of the expenses and pitfalls existing research has linked to flexible working practices.  Flexible working time accounts  Flexible working time accounts is also known as deposited working-time accounts or work bank account system. It is derived from the German Federal Labor Government's reform program, which was passed by the German Federal Government on August 21, 2002. Then Federal Chancellor, Gerhard Schr√∂der, announced that the program will invite the former director of human resources management of Volkswagen company, Peter Hartz, chaired the Labour Market Reform Committee. This program's goal is to make the rigidity of the labor system more flexible and to change the old social welfare policy, in order to lighten heavy financial burden. =Definitions= The concept of flexible working time accounts is to establish labor-self accounts, and labors can save their working hours, just like saving money, into their own accounts. The working hours in their accounts are their assets, so that employers and workers both sides can increase or decrease the work required by each other without affecting the salaries and welfare. While achieving the purpose of flexible labor, and the account-system may be short-term, long or permanent (life-time) of the convention. =Characteristics= Flexible working time accounts system has the following four characteristics # Flexible working time accounts shall be calculated for at least the period of one year. # The calculation of long-term account system is usually based on time and money, occasionally there may be passed on from other labors' accounts, the situation is only applicable to short-term working time. # When using long-term working time accounts, there are two features can be used to classify: ## Optional long-term accounts Most using of optional long-term accounts occur in the period that labors are still holding a post in their own company, labors can withdraw from accounts after negotiating between employers and labors, usually due to labors'personally needs. ## Aged-related long-term accounts Aged-related long-term accounts can be used when labors'career get mature, preparing of early retirement. semi-retirement, or preparation of retirement. # Unlike the short-term account system, there is the lowest limit standard of withdrawing hours, however, the setting of standard is according to different demand of labors.

(circa 1350) The noun mohel (mohala in Aramaic) \\"circumciser\\", is derived from the same verb stem as milah \\"circumcision.\\" The noun appeared for the first time in the fourth century as the title of a circumciser (Shabbat 156a). Origins of circumcision For Jews, male circumcision is mandatory as it is prescribed in the Torah. In the Book of Genesis, it is described as a mark of the Covenant between God and the descendants of Abraham: \\"Throughout all generations, every male shall be circumcised when he is eight days old...This shall be my covenant in your flesh, an eternal covenant. The uncircumcised male whose foreskin has not been circumcised, shall have his soul cut off from his people; he has broken my Covenant\\".Genesis 17:9-14 at bible.ort.org In Leviticus: \\"God spoke to Moses, telling him to speak to the Israelites: When a woman conceives and gives birth to a boy ... on the eighth day, the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.\\"Leviticus 12:1-3 at bible.ort.org Functions Biblically, the infant's father (avi haben) is commanded to perform the circumcision himself. However, as most fathers are not comfortable or do not have the training, they designate a mohel. The mohel is specially trained in circumcision and the rituals surrounding the procedure. Many mohalim are doctors or rabbis (and some are both) or cantors and are required to receive appropriate training both from the religious and medical fields. Traditionally, the mohel uses a scalpel to circumcise the newborn. Today, doctors and some non-Orthodox mohalim use a perforating clamp before they cut the skin. The clamp makes it easier to be precise and shortens recovery time. Orthodox mohalim have rejected perforating clamps, arguing that by crushing and killing the skin it causes a great amount of unnecessary pain to the newborn, cutting off the blood flow completely, which according to Jewish law is dangerous to the child and strictly forbidden, and also renders the orlah (foreskin) as cut prior to the proper ritual cut. Under Jewish law, a mohel must draw blood from the circumcision wound. Most mohels do it by hand with a suction device,Rabbi probed for circumcised infants' herpes, nbcnews.com, 2 February 2005. Retrieved 2 February 2015. but some follow the traditional practice of doing it by mouth. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a warning in 2012 about the health implications of the latter practice, citing 11 cases of neonatal Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and two recorded fatalities. A 2013 review of cases of neonatal HSV infections in Israel identified ritual circumcision as the source of HSV-1 transmission in 31.8% of the cases. Female mohels According to traditional Jewish law, in the absence of a Jewish male expert, a woman that has the required skills is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she is Jewish.Talmud Avodah Zarah 27a; Menachot 42a; Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, Milah, 2:1; Shulkhan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah, 264:1 Non-Orthodox Judaism allows female mohels, called mohalot (, plural of mohelet, feminine of mohel), without restriction. In 1984, Dr. Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform Jewish mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila Program of Reform Judaism. In popular culture In the popular sitcom Seinfeld, a mohel played by Charles Levin appears in the episode The Bris.

An individual with astereognosis is unable to identify objects by handling them, despite intact elementary tactile, proprioceptive, and thermal sensation. With the absence of vision (i.e. eyes closed), an individual with astereognosis is unable to identify what is placed in their hand based on cues such as texture, size, spatial properties, and temperature. As opposed to agnosia, when the object is observed visually, one should be able to successfully identify the object. Individuals with tactile agnosia may be able to identify the name, purpose, or origin of an object with their left hand but not their right, or vice versa, or both hands. Astereognosis refers specifically to those who lack tactile recognition in both hands. In the affected hand(s) they may be able to identify basic shapes such as pyramids and spheres (with abnormally high difficulty) but still not tactilely recognize common objects by easily recognizable and unique features such as a fork by its prongs (though the individual may report feeling a long, metal rod with multiple, pointy rods stemming off in uniform direction). These symptoms suggest that a very specific part of the brain is responsible for making the connections between tactile stimuli and functions/relationships of those stimuli, which, along with the relatively low impact this disorder has on a person's quality of life, helps explain the rarity of reports and research of individuals with tactile agnosia. However in some cases, those persons with tactile agnosia may have many challenges in daily life and occupation. An example is a task that requires typing quickly, as this agnosia type prevents the recognition of keys without looking at a keyboard. Astereognosis is associated with lesions of the parietal lobe or dorsal column or parieto-temporo-occipital lobe (posterior association areas) of either the right or left hemisphere of the cerebral cortex. Despite cross-talk between the dorsal and ventral cortices, fMRI results suggest that those with ventral cortex damage are less sensitive to object 3D structure than those with dorsal cortex damage. Unlike the ventral cortex, the dorsal cortex can compute object representations. Thus, those with object recognition impairments are more likely to have acquired damage to the dorsal cortex. Those suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease show a reduction in stereognosis, the ability to perceive and recognize the form of an object in the absence of visual and auditory information. This supports the notion that astereognosis appears to be an associative disorder in which the connections between tactile information and memory is disturbed. While astereognosis is characterized by the lack of tactile recognition in both hands, it seems to be closely related to tactile agnosia (impairment connected to one hand). Tactile agnosia observations are rare and case-specific. Josef Gerstmann recounts his experience with patient JH, a 34-year-old infantryman who suffered a lesion to the posterior parietal lobe due to a gunshot. Following the injury, JH was unable to recognize or identify everyday objects by their meaning, origin, purpose and use with his left hand using tactile sensation alone. His motility performance, elementary sensitivity, and speech were intact, and he lacked abnormalities in brain nerves. The majority of all objects JH touched with his left hand went unrecognized, but very simple objects (i.e. globes, pyramids, cube, etc.) were regularly recognized based on form alone. For more complex objects, his behavior and recognition varied daily based on his tactile resources that changed over time and depended on his fatigue. That is, JH‚Äôs ability to recognize depended on his concentration and ability to recognize simple forms and single qualities like size, shape, etc. With further interrogation and greater effort, he was able to correctly identify more specific features of an object (i.e. softness, rounded or cornered, broad or narrow) and could even draw a copy of it, but he was often left unable to identify the object by name, use, or origin. This behavioral deficit occurred even if JH had handled the object in his fully intact right hand. Interventions tend to focus on helping these patients and their family and caregivers cope and adapt to the condition, and furthermore, to help patients function independently within their context.

The band was composed of Alun Woodward (vocals, guitar), Emma Pollock (vocals, guitar), Stewart Henderson (bass), and Paul Savage (drums). Biography The band was formed after friends Woodward, Henderson and Savage were ejected from the band Bubblegum. Joined by Savage's then-girlfriend Pollock, the band named themselves after Tour de France winning cyclist, Pedro Delgado. Their first commercial release came with the inclusion of their track \\"Liquidation Girl\\" on the compilation album Skookum Chief Powered Teenage Zit Rock Angst from Nardwuar the Human Serviette. Instead of signing to a record label, the band started their own, Chemikal Underground, on which they released their own records and also some from other local bands, among them Mogwai and Arab Strap. Chemikal Underground's first release was the Delgados first single \\"Monica Webster / Brand New Car\\". The single caught the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, and the band quickly became one of his favourites, going on to record seven sessions for his show. The cost of Chemikal Underground's second release, the single \\"Disco Nation 45\\" by Bis, left the cash-strapped label unable to afford another release by the Delgados, so their next release \\"Lazarwalker\\" came from the London-based Radar Records. Tempted by Radar to a five-album deal, the band declined, instead poaching their A&R; contact, Graeme Beattie, for work at Chemikal Underground. Another single, \\"Cinecentre\\" followed in early 1996 as the band juggled work at the label with several tours, and recorded their debut album. The band released two more singles, this time taken from their album Domestiques released in November 1996. The song \\"Under Canvas, Under Wraps\\" being voted number three in John Peel's Festive Fifty that year. The band released their second album in 1998. Peloton - also a cycling reference. The single \\"Pull the Wires From the Wall\\" gave the Delgados their first hit single in the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 69. The band's close relationship with Peel continued, with \\"Pull the Wires From the Wall\\" voted to number one in the Festive Fifty (it would also make the all time chart made in 2000). The Delgados' evolution continued with The Great Eastern in 2000. The record was produced by Dave Fridmann. Their next single, \\"American Trilogy\\", reached number 61 in the UK chart. The record was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize. Their fourth album, Hate, was released on Mantra rather than the band's own label. The song \\"The Light Before We Land\\" was used as the opening theme for the anime Gunslinger Girl, while the song \\"Woke From Dreaming\\" is played at the beginning of episode 7. The band returned to their own label for 2004's Universal Audio. The band announced they were splitting up in April 2005 due to the departure of Henderson who found it difficult \\"to pour so much of my energy and time into something that never quite seemed to get the attention or respect [he] felt it deserved.\\" The four will continue to run Chemikal Underground together. Songwriters Pollock and Woodward are pursuing individual projects, while Savage will continue production duties at the band's Chem19 in a new studio. Since the band's separation, the track \\"I Fought the Angels\\" from Universal Audio has been used in the fourth episode in the second season of the Golden Globe-winning medical drama Grey's Anatomy in 2006, and in the opening scene in the series premiere of BBC Three's Lip Service in 2010. A double disc containing 29 tracks, The Complete BBC Peel Sessions, was released on 12 June 2006 in Europe, and later in the year in the United States. Woodward released his debut solo album in June 2009 under the name Lord Cut- Glass. Savage also played on the album.

Harding, the 29th President of the United States of America. Many of these individuals came into Harding's personal orbit during his tenure as a state-level politician in Ohio, hence the name. During the Harding administration, several members of the Ohio Gang became involved in financial scandals. These included the Teapot Dome scandal and apparent malfeasance at the U.S. Department of Justice, some of which ended in prison terms and a suicide. Following Harding's sudden death of a heart attack in 1923, many members of the Ohio Gang were effectively removed from the corridors of power by Harding's Vice President and successor, Calvin Coolidge. Background Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, chief perpetrator of the Teapot Dome bribery scandal Warren G. Harding was elected President by promising to return the nation to \\"normalcy\\", and opposing the idealism of his predecessor Woodrow Wilson. He captured 60% of Americans‚Äô votes and won by a landslide. After Harding had won the election, he appointed many of his allies and campaign contributors to powerful political positions in control of vast amounts of government money and resources. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty and Interior Secretary Albert B. Fall were considered to have been responsible for acts of corruption and cronyism. Albert Fall was responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal. Teapot Dome was considered America‚Äôs biggest political scandal up until Watergate. The group met regularly at the infamous Little Green House on K Street. Also associated with the secret hide out was Jesse W. Smith who was said to have committed suicide because he faced scrutiny from Harding‚Äôs supporters about his activities. There is no information that proves that Harding knew of the scandals that were going on during his time in office. He may not have learned much of it until the eve of his death. Fall was mainly responsible for the Teapot Dome scandal and was eventually jailed for taking bribes. Later President Coolidge forced the resignation of Daugherty for the same crimes. =Internal opposition= Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, one of the leaders of the so-called Ohio Gang Not every member of the Harding administration was a member of the so-called \\"Ohio Gang.\\" Among the critics of the clique was Harding's straitlaced Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover, who while generally appreciative of Harding viewed the motivations and behavior of the Ohio Gang with thinly concealed disgust.Herbert Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933. New York: Macmillan, 1952; pg. 48 In his memoirs, published in 1952, Hoover depicted Harding's Ohio cronies as a reflection of a character flaw: > [Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had > been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the > Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he > appointed Director of the Veterans' Bureau; Thomas W. Miller, whom he > appointed Alien Property Custodian, and Jesse W. \\"Jess\\" Smith who had office > room in the Department of Justice. > He enjoyed the company of these men and his old Ohio associates in and out > of the government. Weekly White House poker parties were his greatest > relaxation. The stakes were not large, but the play lasted most of the > night.... I had lived too long on the frontiers of the world to have strong > emotions against people playing poker for money if they liked it, but it > irked me to see it in the White House. Although the religious Hoover was invited to the White House poker party only once and never invited back, he was nevertheless held in esteem by Harding, and he was abruptly added to the entourage for the President's July 1923 trip to Alaska, which came in the wake of Jess Smith's suicide.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 48-49. Even as Harding prepared to leave Washington, DC, Hoover found him \\"nervous and distraught,\\" and his mood changed little on board ship to Alaska.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 49. Hoover later recalled: > One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to > his cabin. He plumped at me the question: \\"If you knew of a great scandal in > our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party > expose it publicly or would you bury it?\\" My natural reply was \\"Publish it, > and at least get credit for integrity on your side.\\" He remarked that this > method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said > that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, > in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the > matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith > that he would be arrested in the morning. Smith went home, burned all his > papers, and committed suicide. Harding gave me no information about what > Smith had been up to. I asked what Daugherty's relations to the affair were. > He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again. During his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be his last days.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 50-53. Following Harding's death, Hoover and his co-thinker, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, approached new President Calvin Coolidge and asked him to remove prominent Ohio Gang member Daugherty as Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 54. Harding's death had done nothing to stem the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans' Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 53. Hoover recalled: > Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly > delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man's long-time > character, he should never have been in any government.... Coolidge had a > high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of > wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that > Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be > willing to retire for the good of public service. Finally, on March 28, 1924 Coolidge requested and received a letter of resignation from Daugherty, effectively terminating the Ohio Gang's last leading member.Mark Grossman, \\"Harry Micajah Daugherty (1860-1941),\\" in Political Corruption in America: An Encyclopedia of Scandals, Power, and Greed. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003; pp. 91-93. The term \\"Ohio Gang\\", while used as an epithet by some during the decade of the 1920s and subsequently, was embraced by others. In his 1932 memoir Harry Daugherty unabashedly declared: > \\"...I was a true son of Ohio, the battle ground of the Nation. I frankly > confess to a leadership in the so-called 'Ohio Gang' for about forty years. > On the lips of rival politicians the 'Ohio Gang' is an epithet. I wear its > badge as a mark of honor.\\"Harry M. Daugherty in collaboration with Thomas > Dixon, The Inside Story of the Harding Tragedy. New York: The Churchill Co., > 1932; pg. 5.

Different views of what constitutes this community may include a focus on moral standards, economic practices, political structures, and/or cultural forms. A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite. In a cosmopolitan community individuals from different places (e.g. nation-states) form relationships of mutual respect. As an example, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.) enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc.). Various places are called \\"cosmopolitan\\"; this does not usually mean cosmopolitan; cosmopolitan means people of various ethnic, cultural and/or religious backgrounds live nearby and interact with each other. Etymology The word derives from the , or kosmopolit√™s, formed from \\"\\", kosmos, i.e. \\"world\\", \\"universe\\", or \\"cosmos\\", and , \\"polit√™s\\", i.e. \\"citizen\\" or \\"[one] of a city\\". Contemporary usage defines the term as \\"citizen of the world\\".. Definitions Definitions of cosmopolitanism usually begin with the Greek etymology of \\"citizen of the world\\". However, as Appiah points out, \\"world\\" in the original sense meant \\"cosmos\\" or \\"universe\\", not earth or globe as current use assumes.Kwame Anthony Appiah, Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, W.W. Norton, New York, 2006, p. xiv. One definition that handles this issue is given in a recent book on political globalization: > Cosmopolitanism can be defined as a global politics that, firstly, projects > a sociality of common political engagement among all human beings across the > globe, and, secondly, suggests that this sociality should be either > ethically or organizationally privileged over other forms of sociality. The Chinese term tianxia (all under Heaven), a metonym for empire, has also been re-interpreted in the modern age as a conception of cosmopolitanism, and was used by 1930s modernists as the title of a Shanghai-based, English- language journal of world arts and letters, T'ien Hsia Monthly. Multilingual modern Chinese writers such as Lin Yutang, Wen Yuan-ning also translated cosmopolitanism using the now more common term shijie zhuyi (ideology of world[liness]). Philosophical =Philosophical roots= Diogenes Cosmopolitanism can be traced back to Diogenes of Sinope (c. 412 B.C.), the founding father of the Cynic movement in Ancient Greece. Of Diogenes it is said: \\"Asked where he came from, he answered: 'I am a citizen of the world (kosmopolit√™s)'\\".Diogenes La√´rtius, The Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book VI, passage 63; online text in Greek and in English at the Perseus Project. In Ancient Greece, the broadest basis of social identity at that time was either the individual city-state or the Greeks (Hellenes) as a group. The Stoics, who later took Diogenes' idea and developed it, typically stressed that each human being \\"dwells [...] in two communities ‚Äì the local community of our birth, and the community of human argument and aspiration\\".Nussbaum, Martha C. (1997). Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism, in The Journal of Political Philosophy Volume 5, Nr 1, pp. 1‚Äì25 A common way to understand Stoic cosmopolitanism is through Hierocles' circle model of identity that states that we should regard ourselves as concentric circles, the first one around the self, next immediate family, extended family, local group, citizens, countrymen, humanity. Within these circles human beings feel a sense of \\"affinity\\" or \\"endearment\\" towards others, which the Stoics termed Oikei√¥sis. The task of world citizens becomes then to \\"draw the circles somehow towards the centre, making all human beings more like our fellow city dwellers, and so forth\\". =Modern cosmopolitan thinkers= In his 1795 essay Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch, Immanuel Kant stages a ius cosmopoliticum (cosmopolitan law/right) as a guiding principle to help global society achieve permanent, enduring peace. Kant's cosmopolitan right stems from an understanding of all human beings as equal members of a universal community. Cosmopolitan right thus works in tandem with international political rights, and the shared, universal right of humanity. Kant's cosmopolitan right is fundamentally bound to the conditions of universal hospitality and the right of resort. Universal hospitality is defined as the right to be welcomed upon arrival in foreign territory, but is contingent on a guest arriving in a peaceful manner. Kant makes the additional claim that all human beings have the basic right of resort: the right to present oneself in a foreign land. The right of resort is derived from Kant's understanding of the Earth's surface as essentially communal, and further emphasizing his claims on equally shared universal rights among all human beings. The philosophical concepts of Emmanuel Levinas, on ethics, and Jacques Derrida, on hospitality, provide a theoretical framework for the relationships between people in their everyday lives and apart from any form of written laws or codes. For Levinas, the foundation of ethics consists in the obligation to respond to the Other. In Being for the Other, he writes that there is no \\"universal moral law,\\" only the sense of responsibility (goodness, mercy, charity) that the Other, in a state of vulnerability, calls forth. The proximity of the Other is an important part of Levinas's concept: the face of the Other is what compels the response. For Derrida, the foundation of ethics is hospitality, the readiness and the inclination to welcome the Other into one's home. Ethics, he claims, is hospitality. Pure, unconditional hospitality is a desire that underscores the conditional hospitality necessary in our relationships with others. Levinas's and Derrida's theories of ethics and hospitality hold out the possibility of an acceptance of the Other as different but of equal standing. Isolation is not a feasible alternative in the world, therefore, it is important to consider how best to approach these interactions, and to determine what is at stake for ourselves and the others: what conditions of hospitality to impose, and whether or not we have responded to the call of the Other. Further, both theories reveal the importance of considering how best to interact with the Other and others, and what is at stake. Derrida in an interview with Bennington (1997) summarized \\"cosmopolitanism\\", A further state of cosmopolitanism occurred after the Second World War. As a reaction to the Holocaust and the other massacres, the concept of crimes against humanity became a generally accepted category in international law. This clearly shows the appearance and acceptance of a notion of individual responsibility that is considered to exist toward all of humankind.Beck, Ulrich (2006). The Cosmopolitan Vision, Cambridge: Polity Press, p. 45 Philosophical cosmopolitans are moral universalists: they believe that all humans, and not merely compatriots or fellow-citizens, come under the same moral standards. The boundaries between nations, states, cultures or societies are therefore morally irrelevant. A widely cited example of a contemporary cosmopolitan is Kwame Anthony Appiah.Appiah, Kwame Anthony (2006), Cosmopolitanism. Ethics in a World of Strangers, London: Penguin Books Some philosophers and scholars argue that the objective and subjective conditions arising in today's unique historical moment, an emerging planetary phase of civilization, creates a latent potential for the emergence of a cosmopolitan identity as global citizens and possible formation of a global citizens movement.GTI Paper Series see Dawn of the Cosmopolitan: The Hope of a Global Citizens Movement, paper #15, and Global Politics and Institutions, paper #3 These emerging objective and subjective conditions in the planetary phase include improved and affordable telecommunications; space travel and the first images of our fragile planet floating in the vastness of space; the emergence of global warming and other ecological threats to our collective existence; new global institutions such as the United Nations, World Trade Organization, or International Criminal Court; the rise of transnational corporations and integration of markets often termed economic globalization; the emergence of global NGOs and transnational social movements, such as the World Social Forum; and so on. Globalization, a more common term, typically refers more narrowly to the economic and trade relations and misses the broader cultural, social, political, environmental, demographic, values and knowledge transitions taking place. =Contemporary cosmopolitan thinkers= A number of contemporary theorists propose, directly and indirectly, various ways of becoming or being a cosmopolitan individual. Thich Nhat Hanh discusses what he calls \\"Interbeing\\" as a way of living one's life in relation to others; \\"Interbeing\\" might easily be compared to cosmopolitanism. Nhat Hanh's philosophical beliefs are grounded in the precepts of Buddhist teachings, which involve compassion and understanding to protect and live in harmony with all people, animals, plants, and minerals. He further describes what he calls \\"Mindfulness Training of the Order of Interbeing\\" as being aware of sufferings created by, but not limited to, the following causes: fanaticism and intolerances that disrupt compassion and living in harmony with others; indoctrination of narrow-minded beliefs; imposition of views; anger; and miscommunication. Understanding and compassion for others seems to be achieved by the understanding of others' suffering and the root causes of suffering. Therefore, to be responsible is to recognize and understand suffering, which then leads to compassion. It is through this process that others can be recognized as people. Other theorists, philosophers, and activists contend that recognizing suffering is necessary to end violence. In Scared Sacred, Velcrow Ripper takes a journey to different sites of great suffering that ultimately leads him toward developing compassion. In \\"The Planet\\", Paul Gilroy explores how the construction and naturalization of race and the hierarchies produced by difference shape the hatred of others. It is the deconstruction of these ideologies that can lead to the compassion and humanization of others. Thus individual responsibility is being aware of what Judith Butler calls the precariousness of life in self and other; being a cosmopolitan seems to be, above all, a social, ethical enterprise. In Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers, Kwame Anthony Appiah notes how social ethics seem to operate: Whatever obligation one might have to another, especially a foreign other, that obligation does not supersede the obligations one has to those people most familiar to them. However, as Judith Butler questions, \\"at what cost do I establish the familiar as the criterion\\" for valuing others? If one values the familiar more than the foreign, what are the consequences? Paul Gilroy offers a possible alternative to this emphasis on familiarity arguing that \\"methodical cultivation of a degree of estrangement from one's own culture and history ... might qualify as essential to a cosmopolitan commitment.\\" This estrangement entails a \\"process of exposure to otherness\\" in order to foster \\"the irreducible value of diversity within sameness.\\" Estrangement, therefore, could lead to de-emphasising the familiar in ethics by integrating otherness. For Gilroy, being cosmopolitan seems to involve both a social, ethical enterprise and a cultural enterprise. In \\"The Planet\\", Gilroy describes the cases of Tom Hurndall and Rachel Corrie; each seems to exemplify what might be considered Gilroy's figure of the cosmopolitan. Both Hurndall and Corrie removed themselves (geographically) from their home cultures, presumably both physically and mentally estranging themselves from their own cultures and histories. Hurndall and Corrie were both killed in 2003 (in separate incidents). Gilroy's model of estrangement might actually undermine itself through its examples; this might be construed as a failure of Gilroy's theory to address the practical difficulties of estranging oneself from the familiar. The Venus Project, an international, multidisciplinary educational organization created by Jacque Fresco, works to spread cosmopolitan ideas by transcending artificial boundaries currently separating people and emphasizing an understanding our interdependence with nature and each other. Some forms of cosmopolitanism also fail to address the potential for economic colonization by powerful countries over less powerful ones. Frantz Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, observes that when nations achieved independence from European colonizers, frequently there was no system in place to secure their economic future, and they became \\"manager[s] for Western enterprise...in practise set[ting] up its country as the brothel of Europe.\\" When \\"third world\\" nations are drawn into economic partnerships with global capital, ostensibly to improve their national quality of life, often the only ones benefitting from this partnership are well-placed individuals and not the nation itself. Further, Mahmood Mamdani in Good Muslim, Bad Muslim suggests that the imposition of Western cultural norms, democracy and Christianity to name only two, has historically resulted in nationalist violence; however, Appiah has implied that democracy is a pre-requisite for cosmopolitan intervention in developing nations. Cosmopolitanism, in these instances, appears to be a new form of colonization: the powerful exploit the weak and the weak eventually fight back. Much of the political thinking of the last two centuries has taken nationalism and the framework of the sovereign nation-state for granted. With the advance of globalization and the increased facility of travel and communication, some thinkers consider that the political system based on the nation-state has become obsolete and that it is time to design a better and more efficient alternative. Jes√∫s Moster√≠n analyzes how the world political system should be organized in order to maximize individual freedom and individual opportunity. Rejecting as muddled the metaphysical notion of free will, he focuses on political freedom, the absence of coercion or interference by others in personal decisions. Because of the tendencies to violence and aggression that lurk in human nature, some constraint on freedom is necessary for peaceful and fruitful social interaction. Especially, there is no rational ground for curtailing the cultural freedoms (of language, religion and customs) in the name of the nation, the church, or the party. From this point of view, the Internet provides a much more attractive model than the nation-state. Neither is there any just reason for restraining the free circulation of people, ideas, or goods. Moster√≠n thinks that the nation-state is incompatible with the full development of freedom, whose blossoming requires the reorganization of the world political system along cosmopolitan lines. He proposes a world without sovereign nation-states, territorially organized in small autonomous but not- sovereign cantonal polities, complemented by strong world organizations. He emphasizes the difference between international institutions, led by representatives of the national governments, and world or universal institutions, with clearly defined aims served by directors selected by their personal qualifications, independently of any national bias or proportion. Criticizing the abstract nature of most versions of cosmopolitanism, Charles Blattberg has argued that any viable cosmopolitanism must be \\"rooted,\\" by which he means based upon a \\"global patriotism.\\" More general philosophical reviews of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism are also available. Carol Nicholson compares John Searle's opposition to multiculturalism with Charles Taylor's celebration of it. She uses Richard Rorty as a triangulation point in that he remains neutral about multiculturalism, but his philosophical analysis of truth and practice can be deployed to argue against Searle and in favor of Taylor. At a conference on \\"Philosophy in a Multicultural Context\\", Rasmus Winther excavated the philosophical assumptions and practices connected with cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism. He develops Bruno Latour's conception of the philosopher as public diplomat. Political and sociological Emile Durkheim (1858‚Äì1917) observed the development of what he called the 'cult of the individual', which is a new religion that replaced the Christianity that was dying out, and which is centered around the sacredness of human dignity. This new religion would provide the new foundations of Western society, and these foundations are closely related to human rights and individual nation's constitutions. A society's sacred object would be the individual's human dignity, and the moral code guiding the society is found in that country's way of interpreting human dignity and human rights. Thus, rather than finding solidarity through national culture, or a particular traditional religious doctrine, society would be unified by its adherence to political values, i.e. individual rights and a defence of human dignity.Durkheim, Emile. \\"Individualism and Individuals\\": Originally published as \\"L'individualisme et les intellectuels,\\" Revue bleue, 4e serie, 10 (1898): 7-13. Translated by Mark Traugott. Article accessed: https://www.scribd.com/document/85771137/Durkheim- Individualism-and-the-Intellectuals Durkheim's cult of the individual has many similarities to John Rawls' political liberalism, which Rawls developed almost a century after Durkheim.See Cladis, Mark. 'A Communitarian Defense of Liberalism: Emile Durkheim and Contemporary Social Theory' (Stanford University Press: Stanford, 1992). Ulrich Beck (May 15, 1944 ‚Äì January 1, 2015) was a sociologist who posed the new concept of cosmopolitan critical theory in direct opposition to traditional nation-state politics. Nation-state theory sees power relations only among different state actors, and excludes a global economy, or subjugates it to the nation-state model. Cosmopolitanism sees global capital as a possible threat to the nation state and places it within a meta-power game in which global capital, states and civil society are its players. It is important to mark a distinction between Beck's cosmopolitanism and the idea of a world state. For Beck, imposing a single world order was considered hegemonic at best and ethnocentric at worst. Rather, political and sociological cosmopolitanism rests upon these fundamental foundations: * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of those who are culturally different\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of the future\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of nature\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of the object\\" * \\"Acknowledging the otherness of other rationalities\\" A number of philosophers, including Emmanuel Levinas, have introduced the concept of the \\"Other\\". For Levinas, the Other is given context in ethics and responsibility; we should think of the Other as anyone and everyone outside ourselves. According to Levinas, our initial interactions with the Other occur before we form a will‚Äîthe ability to make choices. The Other addresses us and we respond: even the absence of response is a response. We are thus conditioned by the Other's address and begin to form culture and identity. After the formation of the will, we choose whether to identify with the addresses by others and, as a result, continue the process of forming identity.Emmanuel Levinas. Totality and Infinity. An Essay on Exteriority. Lingis A (trans) Duquesne University Press, Pittsburgh, PA 1998. pp. 84, 100‚Äì01 During this process, it is possible to recognize ourselves in our interactions with Others. Even in situations where we engage in the most minimal interaction, we ascribe identities to others and simultaneously to ourselves. Our dependence on the Other for the continuous formation of language, culture, and identity means that we are responsible to others and that they are responsible to us. Also once we've formed a will, it becomes possible to recognize this social interdependence. When we have gained the capacity for recognition, the imperative is to perform that recognition and thereby become ethically responsible to the Other in conscience. Cosmopolitanism shares some aspects of universalism ‚Äì namely the globally acceptable notion of human dignity that must be protected and enshrined in international law. However, the theory deviates in recognising the differences between world cultures. In addition, cosmopolitanism calls for equal protection of the environment and against the negative side effects of technological development. Human dignity, however, is convoluted because it is necessary to first distinguish who has the right to be respected and second to consider what rights are protectable. Under cosmopolitanism, all humans have rights; however, history shows that recognition of these rights is not guaranteed. As an example, Judith Butler discusses a Western discourse of \\"human\\" in Precarious Life: The Powers of Mourning and Violence. Butler works through the idea of \\"human\\" and notes that \\"human\\" has been \\"naturalized in its 'Western' mold by the contemporary workings of humanism\\" (32). Thus, there is the idea that not all \\"human\\" lives will be supported in the same way, indeed, that some human lives are worth more protection than others. Others have extended this idea to examine how animals might be reconfigured as cosmopolitan, present the world-over with varying identities in different places. This idea is reiterated in Sunera Thobani's \\"Exalted Subjects: Studies in the Making of Race and Nation in Canada,\\" where she discusses a discourse in which Muslim people fall into a good/bad dichotomy: a \\"good Muslim\\" is one who has been Westernized and a \\"bad Muslim\\" is one who visibly rejects Western cultural influences. Thobani notes that it is through media representations that these ideas become naturalized. Individuals who embrace Western ideals are considered fully \\"human\\" and are more likely to be afforded dignity and protection than those who defend their non-Westernized cultural identities. According to those who follow Beck's reasoning, a cosmopolitan world would consist of a plurality of states, which would use global and regional consensus to gain greater bargaining power against opponents. States would also utilize the power of civil society actors such as Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and consumers to strengthen their legitimacy and enlist the help of investors to pursue a cosmopolitan agenda. Other authors imagine a cosmopolitan world moving beyond today's conception of nation-states. These scholars argue that a truly cosmopolitan identity of Global Citizen will take hold, diminishing the importance of national identities. The formation of a global citizens movement would lead to the establishment of democratic global institutions, creating the space for global political discourse and decisions, would in turn reinforce the notion of citizenship at a global level. Nested structures of governance balancing the principles of irreducibility (i.e., the notion that certain problems can only be addressed at the global level, such as global warming) and subsidiarity (i.e., the notion that decisions should be made at as local a level possible) would thus form the basis for a cosmopolitan political order.GTI Paper Series see Global Politics and Institutions, paper #3 Daniele Archibugi proposes a renewed model for global citizenship:Daniele Archibugi, The Global Commonwealth of Citizens: Toward a Cosmopolitan Democracy, Princeton University Press, 2009. institutional cosmopolitanism. It advocates some reforms in global governance to allow world citizens to take more directly a part into political life. A number of proposals have been made in order to make this possible. Cosmopolitan democracy, for example, suggests strengthening the United Nations and other international organizations by creating a World Parliamentary Assembly.Daniele Archibugi, Debating Cosmopolitics, London: Verso, 2003. Criticism \\"Cosmopolitanism\\" became a rhetorical weapon used by nationalists against \\"alien\\" ideas that went counter to orthodoxy. European Jews were frequently accused of being \\"rootless cosmopolitans.\\" Joseph Stalin in a 1946 Moscow speech attacked writings in which \\"the positive Soviet hero is derided and inferior before all things foreign and cosmopolitanism that we all fought against from the time of Lenin, characteristic of the political leftovers, is many times applauded.\\"Jeff Greenfield, \\"The Ugly History of Stephen Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄòCosmopolitan‚Äô Epithet: Surprise, surprise‚Äîthe insult has its roots in Soviet anti-Semitism.\\" Politico 3 August, 2017 In the German Democratic Republic, cosmopolitanism was characterized as a bourgeois-imperialist ideology that rejects the nations' right to independence and national sovereignty. Cosmopolitanism was said to promote the dismantling of national and patriotic traditions and national culture. It was said to be advocated by the Anglo-American imperialism with an aim to establish world hegemony (World Government) operating in the interests of monopoly capitalism. Its opposite was not chauvinist bourgeois nationalism, but patriotism; love of your native place, your country. Love of the homeland was said to be one of the deepest feelings of the working people, expressed in the struggle against conquerors and oppressors.Taschenkalender der Kasernierten Volkspolizei 1954. Berlin : Verl. d. Minist. d. Innern, pp. 248-249. In the 21st century, the epithet became a weapon used by Vladimir Putin in Russia, and by nationalists in Hungary and Poland.Jeff Greenfield, \\"The Ugly History of Stephen Miller‚Äôs ‚ÄòCosmopolitan‚Äô Epithet\\" In modern times, Stephen Miller, a Trump administration senior policy advisor, has publicly criticized CNN reporter Jim Acosta as exhibiting \\"cosmopolitan bias\\" during a discussion on the government's new immigration plan.

(abbreviated 8vo, 8¬∫, or In-8) is a technical term describing the format of a book, which refers to the size of leaves produced from folding a full sheet of paper on which multiple pages of text were printed to form the individual sections (or gatherings) of a book. An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets (e.g. of A2 paper) on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet. Other common book formats are folios and quartos. Octavo is also used as a general description of the size of books that are about tall (almost A4 paper size), and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. These terms are discussed in greater detail in book sizes. Format An octavo is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper on which 16 pages of text were printed, which were then folded three times to produce eight leaves. Each leaf of an octavo book thus represents one eighth the size of the original sheet. There are many variations in how octavos were produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as an octavo (eight leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 4 leaves each, an \\"octavo in 4s.\\"Ronald B. McKerrow, An Introduction to Bibliography for Literary Students, Oxford 1927 and later eds., p. 28. The actual size of an octavo book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed. The size of such sheets varied in different localities and times. A sixteenth century octavo printed in France or Italy is about the size of a modern cheap paperback, whereas an eighteenth-century octavo printed in England is larger, about the size of a modern hardcover novel. The Gutenberg Bible was printed as a folio in about 1455, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once. Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book. The oldest surviving octavo book apparently is the so-called \\"Turkish calendar\\" for 1455, presumably printed in late 1454, about the same time as the Gutenberg Bible.British Library, Incunabula Short Title Catalogue, entry for the 1454 Turkish Calendar.Margaret Bingham Stillwell, The Beginning of the World of Books, 1450-1470, Bibliographical Society of America, New York, 1972, p. 6, described as a tract of 6 leaves, but not identifying the format.

Beginning in 1501, Aldus Manutius of Venice began to print classical works in small octavo format which were easily portable. These editions contained only the text of the works, without the commentary and notes, and became very popular with educated readers. As a result, Aldus became closely associated with the octavo format.Martin Lowry, The World of Aldus Manutius, Cornell University Press, 1979, pp. 137-167. Size Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., the number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term \\"octavo\\" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size of the book. The use of the term \\"octavo\\" as applied to such books refers to books which are generally between tall, the most common size for modern hardbound books. More specific sizes are denoted by reference to certain paper sizes as follows: *Foolscap octavo (6¬æ\\" by 4¬º\\") (170 mm x 108 mm) *Crown octavo (7¬Ω\\" by 5\\") (190 mm x 126 mm) *Demy octavo (8¬æ\\" by 5‚Öù\\") (221 mm x 142 mm) *Globe octavo (? by ?) *Royal octavo (10\\" by 6¬º\\") (253 mm x 158 mm) See also *Book size *Bookbinding *Folio *Quarto *Paper size *Units of paper quantity References Book formats ","title":"Octavo"},{"id":"599192","text":"Lassa witch doctors A witch doctor was originally a type of healer who treated ailments believed to be caused by witchcraftLugira, Aloysius Muzzanganda. African Traditional Religion, p. 100 (Infobase Publishing, 2009). and is now more commonly a term used to refer to healers, particularly in regions which use traditional healing rather than contemporary medicine. Original meaning of the term In its original meaning witch doctors were not witches themselves, but rather people who had remedies to protect others against witchcraft. Witchcraft-induced conditions were their area of expertise, as described in this 1858 news report from England:The Ipswich Journal (Ipswich, England), Saturday, September 25, 1858. > Recourse was had by the girl's parents to a cunning man, named Burrell, > residing at Copford, who has long borne the name of \\"The Wizard of the > North:\\" but her case was of so peculiar a character as to baffle his skill > to dissolve the spell, Application was next made to a witch doctor named > Murrell, residing at Hadleigh, Essex, who undertook to effect a cure, giving > a bottle of medication, for which he did not forget to charge 3s. 6d., and > promising to pay a visit on Monday evening to the \\"old witch,\\" Mrs. Mole, > and put an end to her subtle arts... ... the news of the expected coming of > the witch-doctor spread far and wide, and about eight o'clock there could > not have been less than 200 people collected near the cottage of Mrs. Mole > to witness the supernatural powers of the Hadleigh wizard. In Europe The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first record of the use of this term was in 1718, in Francis Hutchinson's work An Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft, with Observations upon Matters of Fact; Tending to Clear the Texts of the Sacred Scriptures, and Confute the Vulgar Errors about that Point. Hutchinson used the phrase in a chapter defending a prisoner who was charged with witchcraft, by asserting that the \\"Witch-Doctor\\" himself was the one using sorcery: > The said Dorothy Durent, having been with a Witch-Doctor, acknowledges upon > Oath, that by his Advice she hang'd up her Child's Blanket in the Chimney, > found a Toad in it at Night, had put it into the Fire, and held it there > tho' it made a great and horrible Noise, and flash'd like Gunpower, and went > off like a Pistol, and then became invisible, and that by this the Prisoner > was scorch'd and burn'd lamentably. Charles Mackay's book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, first published in 1841, attests to the practice of belief in witch doctors in England at the time. > In the north of England, the superstition lingers to an almost inconceivable > extent. Lancashire abounds with witch-doctors, a set of quacks, who pretend > to cure diseases inflicted by the devil. The practices of these worthies may > be judged of by the following case, reported in the \\"Hertford Reformer,\\" of > the 23rd of June, 1838. The witch-doctor alluded to is better known by the > name of the cunning man, and has a large practice in the counties of Lincoln > and Nottingham. According to the writer in \\"The Reformer,\\" the dupe, whose > name is not mentioned, had been for about two years afflicted with a painful > abscess and had been prescribed for without relief by more than one medical > gentleman. He was urged by some of his friends, not only in his own village > but in neighbouring ones, to consult the witch-doctor, as they were > convinced he was under some evil influence. He agreed and sent his wife to > the cunning man, who lived in New Saint Swithin's, in Lincoln. She was > informed by this ignorant impostor that her husband's disorder was an > infliction of the devil, occasioned by his next-door neighbours, who had > made use of certain charms for that purpose. From the description he gave of > the process, it appears to be the same as that employed by Dr. Fian and > Gellie Duncan, to work woe upon King James. He stated that the neighbours, > instigated by a witch, whom he pointed out, took some wax, and moulded it > before the fire into the form of her husband, as near as they could > represent him; they then pierced the image with pins on all sides ‚Äì repeated > the Lord's Prayer backwards, and offered prayers to the devil that he would > fix his stings into the person whom that figure represented, in like manner > as they pierced it with pins. To counteract the effects of this diabolical > process, the witch-doctor prescribed a certain medicine, and a charm to be > worn next to the body, on that part where the disease principally lay. The > patient was to repeat the 109th and 119th Psalms every day, or the cure > would not be effectual. The fee which he claimed for this advice was a > guinea. A healing ceremony held in Worcester, England on October 26, 2017, is a rare modern example of the practice in Europe. A sacred river blessing was conducted by a travelling witch doctor at the River Severn after rumours of a cholera risk. Vibrio cholerae non-O1/non-O139 was said to be present in the river due to migrating salmon which had consumed crustacean zooplankton carrying the bacteria. In Africa Shona traditional healer, or n'anga (Zimbabwe). In southern Africa, traditional healers are known as sangomas. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first use of the term \\"witch doctor\\" to refer to African shamans (i.e. medicine men) was in 1836 in a book by Robert Montgomery Martin. BBC News reported, on March 12, 2015, that, \\"More than 200 witchdoctors and traditional healers have been arrested in Tanzania in a crackdown on the murder of albino people. The killings have been driven by the belief ‚Äì advanced by some witchdoctors ‚Äì that the body parts have properties that confer wealth and good luck. According to the Red Cross, witchdoctors are prepared to pay $75,000 (¬£57,000) for a complete set of albino body parts. Nearly 80 albino Tanzanians have been killed since 2000, the UN says. The latest victims include a one-year-old albino boy, killed in north-western Tanzania. The government banned witchdoctors in January as part of its efforts to prevent further attacks and kidnappings targeting people with albinism.\\"  In Nepal and Northeastern India  Statues of jhƒÅkri at Banjhakri Falls and Energy Park in Gangtok, Sikkim, India JhƒÅkri () is the Nepali word for shaman. It is sometimes reserved specifically for practitioners of Nepali shamanism, such as that practiced among the Tamang people and the Magars; it is also used in the Indian states of Sikkim and West Bengal, which border Nepal. JhƒÅkri shamanism is practiced among numerous ethnic groups of Nepal and Northeast India, including the Limbu, Rai, Sunwar, Sherpa, Kami, Tamang, Gurung, Magars, Lepcha and Khas. Belief in spirits is prevalent, hence also the fear of spirit possession. Some vernacular words for jhƒÅkri are phedangbo in the Limbu language, maangpa or nakchyong in Khambu, and boongthing in Lepcha. JhƒÅkris perform rituals during weddings, funerals, and harvests. They diagnose and cure diseases. Their practices are influenced by Hinduism, Tibetan Buddhism, Mun, and B√∂n rites. Even now the indigenous ethnic groups of Assam, Northeastern India (especially in the Mayong region as well other rural places) have shamanistic medicine man who treats diseases using sorcery as well as witchcraft and black magic for which it was once renowned for. Similar Shamans and Medicine Man are prevalent among the indigenous communities throughout the rural areas of the NE India.

given by a publisher to booksellers, librarians, journalists, celebrities, or others, or as a contest or school prize, before the book is printed for mass distribution. Overview ARCs may lack the final dust jacket, formatting, and binding of the finished product. The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items. ARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to reviewers, bookstores, magazines, and (in some cases) libraries. Book collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do. On rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a confidentiality of content agreement. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer. Before it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound galley proofs only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase 'uncorrected proof' appears on the ARC cover. Although ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is Captain Vorpatril's Alliance by Lois McMaster Bujold. Digital advance copies Publishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as eBooks on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, eARC has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks. This usage dates back to at least 2010 and was promoted by Baen Books for their trade eBooks from at least 2013 onward. References Books by type Book terminology ","title":"Advance copy"},{"id":"599203","text":"Raynaud syndrome, also known as Raynaud's phenomenon, is a medical condition in which spasm of arteries cause episodes of reduced blood flow. Typically, the fingers, and less commonly the toes, are involved. Rarely, the nose, ears, or lips are affected. The episodes result in the affected part turning white and then blue. Often, numbness or pain occurs. As blood flow returns, the area turns red and burns. The episodes typically last minutes, but can last several hours. Episodes are often triggered by cold or emotional stress. Primary Raynaud's, also known as idiopathic, means that it is spontaneous and unrelated to another disease. Secondary Raynaud's occurs as a result of another condition. Secondary Raynaud's can occur due to a connective-tissue disorder, such as scleroderma or lupus, injuries to the hands, prolonged vibration, smoking, thyroid problems, and certain medications, such as birth control pills. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms. The primary treatment is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or stimulant use. Medications for treatment of cases that do not improve include calcium channel blockers and iloprost. Little evidence supports alternative medicine. Severe disease may rarely be complicated by skin sores or gangrene. About 4% of people have the condition. Onset of the primary form is typically between ages 15 and 30 and occurs more frequently in females. The secondary form usually affects older people. Both forms are more common in cold climates. It is named after the French physician Maurice Raynaud, who described the condition in 1862.  Signs and symptoms  Raynaud's affecting all five fingers Bluish coloration The condition can cause localized pain, discoloration (paleness), and sensations of cold and/or numbness. When exposed to cold temperatures, the blood supply to the fingers or toes, and in some cases the nose or earlobes, is markedly reduced; the skin turns pale or white (called pallor) and becomes cold and numb. These events are episodic, and when the episode subsides or the area is warmed, the blood flow returns, and the skin color first turns red (rubor), and then back to normal, often accompanied by swelling, tingling, and a painful \\"pins and needles\\" sensation. All three color changes are observed in classic Raynaud's. However, not all patients see all of the aforementioned color changes in all episodes, especially in milder cases of the condition. The red flush is due to reactive hyperemia of the areas deprived of blood flow. In pregnancy, this sign normally disappears due to increased surface blood flow. Raynaud's has occurred in breastfeeding mothers, causing nipples to turn white and painful. difficulty breastfeeding.  Causes  = Primary = Raynaud's disease, or primary Raynaud's, is diagnosed if the symptoms are idiopathic, that is, if they occur by themselves and not in association with other diseases. Some refer to primary Raynaud's disease as \\"being allergic to coldness\\". It often develops in young women in their teens and early adulthood. Primary Raynaud's is thought to be at least partly hereditary, although specific genes have not yet been identified. Smoking increases frequency and intensity of attacks, and a hormonal component exists. Caffeine, estrogen, and nonselective beta- blockers are often listed as aggravating factors, but evidence that they should be avoided is not solid. = Secondary = Raynaud's phenomenon, or secondary Raynaud's, occurs secondary to a wide variety of other conditions. Secondary Raynaud's has a number of associations: * Connective tissue disorders: ** scleroderma ** Systemic lupus erythematosus ** Rheumatoid arthritis ** Sj√∂gren's syndrome ** Dermatomyositis ** Polymyositis ** Mixed connective tissue disease ** Cold agglutinin disease ** Ehlers-Danlos syndrome * Eating disorders: ** Anorexia nervosa * Obstructive disorders: ** Atherosclerosis ** Buerger's disease ** Takayasu's arteritis ** Subclavian aneurysms ** Thoracic outlet syndrome * Drugs: ** Beta-blockers ** Cytotoxic drugs ‚Äì particularly chemotherapeutics and most especially bleomycin ** Cyclosporin ** Bromocriptine ** Ergotamine ** Sulfasalazine ** Anthrax vaccines whose primary ingredient is the Anthrax Protective Antigen ** Stimulant medications, such as those used to treat ADHD (amphetamine and methylphenidate) ** OTC pseudoephedrine medications (Chlor-Trimeton, Sudafed, others) * Occupation: ** Jobs involving vibration, particularly drilling and prolonged use of a string trimmer (weed whacker), suffer from vibration white finger ** Exposure to vinyl chloride, mercury ** Exposure to the cold (e.g., by working as a frozen food packer) * Others: ** Physical trauma to the extremities ** Lyme disease ** Hypothyroidism ** Cryoglobulinemia ** Cancer ** Chronic fatigue syndrome ** Reflex sympathetic dystrophy ** Carpal tunnel syndrome ** Magnesium deficiency ** Multiple sclerosis ** Erythromelalgia (clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud's, with hot and warm extremities, often co-exists in patients with Raynaud's) ** Chilblains (also clinically presenting as the opposite of Raynaud's, with hot and itchy extremities, however it affects smaller areas than erythromelalgia, for instance the tip of a toe rather than the whole foot) Raynaud's can precede these other diseases by many years, making it the first presenting symptom. This may be the case in the CREST syndrome, of which Raynaud's is a part. Patients with secondary Raynaud's can also have symptoms related to their underlying diseases. Raynaud's phenomenon is the initial symptom that presents for 70% of patients with scleroderma, a skin and joint disease. When Raynaud's phenomenon is limited to one hand or one foot, it is referred to as unilateral Raynaud's. This is an uncommon form, and it is always secondary to local or regional vascular disease. It commonly progresses within several years to affect other limbs as the vascular disease progresses. Mechanism Underlying mechanism Its pathophysiology includes hyperactivation of the sympathetic nervous system causing extreme vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to tissue hypoxia.  Diagnosis  Heat signatures of a Raynaud's hand (top) and a healthy hand (bottom): Red indicates warm areas whilst green indicates cool areas. (Image taken with a thermographic camera) Consensus diagnostic criteria Distinguishing Raynaud's disease (primary Raynaud's) from phenomenon (secondary Raynaud's) is important. Looking for signs of arthritis or vasculitis, as well as a number of laboratory tests, may separate them. If suspected to be secondary to systemic sclerosis, one tool which may help aid in the prediction of systemic sclerosis is thermography. A careful medical history will seek to identify or exclude possible secondary causes. * Digital artery pressures are measured in the arteries of the fingers before and after the hands have been cooled. A decrease of at least 15 mmHg is diagnostic (positive). * Doppler ultrasound to assess blood flow * Full blood count may reveal a normocytic anaemia suggesting the anaemia of chronic disease or kidney failure. * Blood test for urea and electrolytes may reveal kidney impairment. * Thyroid function tests may reveal hypothyroidism. * Tests for rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and autoantibody screening may reveal specific causative illnesses or an inflammatory process. Anti-centromere antibodies are common in limited systemic sclerosis (CREST syndrome). * Nail fold vasculature (capillaroscopy) can be examined under a microscope. To aid in the diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Table 1 below provides a summary of these various diagnostic criteria. Recently, International Consensus Criteria were developed for the diagnosis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon by a panel of experts in the fields of rheumatology and dermatology.  Management  Secondary Raynaud's is managed primarily by treating the underlying cause, and as primary Raynaud's, avoiding triggers, such as cold, emotional and environmental stress, vibrations and repetitive motions, and avoiding smoking (including passive smoking) and sympathomimetic drugs. =Medications= Medications can be helpful for moderate or severe disease. * Vasodilators ‚Äì calcium channel blockers, such as the dihydropyridines nifedipine or amlodipine, preferably slow-release preparations ‚Äì are often first-line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema, but these are not typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium-channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Although, other studies also reveal that CCBs may be effective at decreasing severity of attacks, pain and disability associated with Raynaud's phenomenon. People whose disease is secondary to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy, as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to too much blood supply. * People with severe disease prone to ulceration or large artery thrombotic events may be prescribed aspirin. * Sympatholytic agents, such as the alpha-adrenergic blocker prazosin, may provide temporary relief to secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. * Losartan can, and topical nitrates may, reduce the severity and frequency of attacks, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil and tadalafil may reduce their severity. * Angiotensin receptor blockers or ACE inhibitors may aid blood flow to the fingers, and some evidence shows that angiotensin receptor blockers (often losartan) reduce frequency and severity of attacks, and possibly better than nifedipine. * The prostaglandin iloprost is used to manage critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in Raynaud's phenomenon, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan is used to manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma. * Statins have a protective effect on blood vessels, and SSRIs such as fluoxetine may help symptoms, but the data is weak. * PDE5 inhibitors are used off-label to treat severe ischemia and ulcers in fingers and toes for people with secondary Raynaud's phenomenon; as of 2016, their role more generally in Raynaud's was not clear. = Surgery = * In severe cases, an endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy procedure can be performed. Here, the nerves that signal the blood vessels of the fingertips to constrict are surgically cut. Microvascular surgery of the affected areas is another possible therapy, but this procedure should be considered as a last resort. * A more recent treatment for severe Raynaud's is the use of botulinum toxin. The 2009 article studied 19 patients ranging in age from 15 to 72 years with severe Raynaud's phenomenon of which 16 patients (84%) reported pain reduction at rest; 13 patients reported immediate pain relief, three more had gradual pain reduction over 1‚Äì2 months. All 13 patients with chronic finger ulcers healed within 60 days. Only 21% of the patients required repeated injections. A 2007 article describes similar improvement in a series of 11 patients. All patients had significant relief of pain. =Alternative medicine= Evidence does not support the use of alternative medicine, including acupuncture and laser therapy.  Prognosis  The prognosis of primary Raynaud syndrome is often very favorable, with no mortality and little morbidity. However, a minority develops gangrene. The prognosis of secondary Raynaud is dependent on the underlying disease, and how effective blood flow-restoring maneuvers are.

He began his career as a radio and big band singer who went on to appear in film and on Broadway. From 1965 to 1986, Griffin hosted his own talk show, The Merv Griffin Show. He also created the internationally popular game shows Jeopardy! and Wheel of Fortune through his television production companies, Merv Griffin Enterprises and Merv Griffin Entertainment. Early life Griffin was born July 6, 1925, in San Mateo, California, to Mervyn Edward Griffin, Sr., a stockbroker, and Rita Elizabeth Griffin (n√©e Robinson), a homemaker. The family was Irish American. Raised as a Catholic, Griffin started singing in his church choir as a boy, and by his teens was earning extra money as a church organist. His abilities as a pianist played a part in his early entry into show business. Merv attended St. Matthews Catholic grade school in San Mateo, California. He attended San Mateo High School, graduating in 1942, and continued to aid in financing the school. He attended San Mateo Junior College and then the University of San Francisco. He was a member of the international fraternity Tau Kappa Epsilon. During World War II, Griffin was declared 4F after failing several military physical examinations due to having a slight heart murmur.\\"Merv Griffin, Before He Was a Legend \\" August 12, 2009. During the Korean War several years later, he was examined and deemed healthy enough to serve, but by that time was above age 26 and therefore exempt from the draft. Career =Singing= Griffin started as a singer on radio at age 19, appearing on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which disappointed some radio fans when they saw him in person. He wrote years later in his autobiography that originally there was a deliberate effort to keep the public from finding out how he looked. Embarrassed by the weight issue, Griffin resolved to change his appearance, losing 80 pounds in four months. Freddy Martin heard him on the radio show and asked Griffin to tour with his orchestra, which he did for four years. Griffin had an uncredited role as a radio announcer in the 1953 horror/science fiction classic The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. By 1945, Griffin had earned enough money to form his own record label, Panda Records, which produced Songs by Merv Griffin, the first U.S. album ever recorded on magnetic tape.Entertainment Legend Merv Griffin Dies At 82 , from Billboard In 1947, he had a 15-minute Monday-to-Friday singing program on KFRC in San Francisco. He became increasingly popular with nightclub audiences, and his fame soared among the general public with his 1950 hit \\"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts\\". The song reached the number one spot on the Hit Parade and sold three million copies. At one of his nightclub performances, Griffin was discovered by Doris Day. Day arranged for a screen test at the Warner Bros. Studios for a role in By the Light of the Silvery Moon. Griffin did not get the part, but the screen test led to supporting roles in other musical films such as So This Is Love in 1953. The film caused a minor controversy when Griffin shared an open-mouthed kiss with Kathryn Grayson. The kiss was a first in Hollywood film history since the introduction of the Production Code in 1934. Griffin would go on to film more pictures (The Boy from Oklahoma and Phantom of the Rue Morgue), but soon became disillusioned with movie-making. Griffin bought his contract back from Warner Bros. and decided to devote his attention to a new medium: television. In the summer of 1954, Merv Griffin and Betty Ann Grove sang and danced for a show called \\"Summer Holiday\\" (and \\"Song Snapshots from a Summer Holiday\\"). The premise of the show was a \\"Live musical show with two singers simulating a trip to various places in the world.\\" The show name had alternating titles for the same show, different nights, but were filled with the patter of songs and feet by the two hosts. Merv and Betty were brought together by Byron Paul, producer of \\"The Jane Froman Show\\", and Irving Mansfield, the show's creator. Mansfield remembered Merv for his singing in the Grace Moore picture and for his hit song, \\"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.\\" The producer of the show (Byron Paul) had already considered Miss Grove for the summer replacement show, but \\"it was just a matter of finding a boy,\\" Byron said. \\"I'm quite excited. They're both young, fresh, work well together, work well independently. And I've never met two people who are easier to get along with.\\" The show ran for one summer.TV Guide September 4‚Äì10, 1954 =Game show host= From 1958 to 1962, Griffin hosted a game show produced by Mark Goodson and Bill Todman called Play Your Hunch. The show appeared on all three networks, but primarily on NBC. He also hosted a prime time game show for ABC called Keep Talking. Additionally, he substituted for a week for the vacationing Bill Cullen on The Price Is Right, and also for Bud Collyer on To Tell the Truth. In 1963, NBC offered him the opportunity to host a new game show, Word for Word, which Griffin produced. He also produced Let's Play Post Office for NBC in 1965; Reach for the Stars for NBC in 1967; and One in a Million for ABC in 1967. =Talk show host= Griffin scored a coup when Tonight Show host Jack Paar accidentally emerged onto the set of Play Your Hunch during a live broadcast, and Griffin got him to stay for a spontaneous interview. After Paar left The Tonight Show, but before Johnny Carson took over (Carson was still hosting Who Do You Trust? for ABC), Griffin was one of the many guest hosts who presided over Tonight in the interim. Griffin was considered the most successful of the guest hosts,\\"Late Night\\". Pioneers of Television, January 9, 2008. and was rewarded with his own daytime talk show on NBC in 1962. This live, 55-minute program was not successful, however, and was cancelled in 1963. Griffin (right) and sidekick Arthur Treacher in 1969 In 1965, Griffin launched a syndicated talk show for Group W (Westinghouse Broadcasting) titled The Merv Griffin Show. The show aired in a variety of time slots throughout North America; many stations ran it in the daytime, others aired it in prime-time and a few broadcast it opposite Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show. Griffin's announcer/sidekick was the veteran British character actor Arthur Treacher, who had been his mentor. After Treacher left the show in 1970, Griffin would do the announcing himself, and walk on stage with the phrase: \\"And now..., here I come!\\" According to an obituary article on August 24, 2007 in Entertainment Weekly, The Merv Griffin Show was on the air for 21 years and won eleven Emmy Awards during its run. Griffin was not shy about tackling controversial subjects, especially the Vietnam War. The guests on the Westinghouse show were an eclectic mix of entertainers, authors, politicians, and \\"personality\\" performers like Zsa Zsa Gabor. Griffin also booked controversial guests like George Carlin, Dick Gregory, Richard Pryor, Norman Mailer, and Bertrand Russell. Griffin received critical acclaim for booking such guests, but was also widely criticized for it. When philosopher and anti-war activist Bertrand Russell used Griffin's show to condemn the war in Vietnam, Griffin was criticized for letting Russell have his say. Arnold Schwarzenegger, later the 38th governor of California, made his talk show debut in the United States on Griffin's talk show in 1974 after moving from Austria. Griffin dedicated two shows to the topic of Transcendental Meditation and its founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, one in 1975, the other in 1977; the 1977 edition aired separate from the main series as a standalone special in some regions such as Canada. Griffin himself was an enthusiastic student of the practice. Griffin would also frequently chat with audience members. One regular audience member, Lillian Miller, would become a fixture on Griffin's program throughout its run. Griffin's best friend since the sixth grade, Robert (Bob) Murphy, was the producer of The Merv Griffin Show, and eventually became president of Merv Griffin Enterprises. =Late-night host= CBS gave Griffin a late-night show opposite Carson in 1969, a move which proved disastrous. The network was uncomfortable with the guests Griffin wanted, who often spoke out against the Vietnam War and on other taboo topics. When political activist Abbie Hoffman was Griffin's guest in April 1970, CBS blurred the video of Hoffman so viewers at home would not see his trademark American flag pattern shirt even though other guests had worn the same shirt in the past, uncensored. Griffin disliked the censorship imposed by CBS and complained. Sensing that his time at CBS was ending, and tired of the restrictions imposed by the network, Griffin secretly signed a contract with rival company Metromedia. The contract with Metromedia would give him a syndicated daytime talk show deal as soon as CBS canceled Griffin's show. Within a few months, Griffin was fired by CBS. His new show began the following Monday and ran until the mid-1980s. By 1986, Griffin was ready to retire and ended his talk show run. Thanks to profits from his highly successful game shows, Griffin had become one of the world's wealthiest entertainers. Game show creator Griffin created and produced the successful television game show Jeopardy! in 1964; in an Associated Press profile released right before the show premiered, Griffin talked about the show's origins: The show, originally titled What's the Question?, premiered on NBC on March 30, 1964, hosted by Art Fleming, and lasted for 11 years. Griffin wrote the 30-second piece of music heard during the show's Final Jeopardy! Round, and which later became the iconic melody of the theme for the syndicated version of the show hosted by Alex Trebek. In 1975, NBC canceled Jeopardy! after moving it twice on its daytime schedule, despite having an additional year on its network contract left to fulfill. Griffin produced the show's successor, Wheel of Fortune, which premiered on January 6, 1975. Wheel, with Chuck Woolery as host and Susan Stafford as the hostess, had successful ratings throughout its network run. From December 1975 to January 1976, the show expanded to an hour, in response to the successful 60-minute version of The Price Is Right on CBS. \\"Wheel\\" barely escaped cancellation in 1980, when NBC replaced three of its other game shows with a daytime talk show starring David Letterman; NBC finally cancelled it in 1989, when CBS picked it up for a year (only to return to NBC, when the daytime version was finally cancelled for good in 1991). The show became a phenomenon, when on September 19, 1983, a nighttime version hit the syndication market with Pat Sajak and Vanna White as host and hostess, respectively. Around the same time, Griffin composed the show's best-known theme song, \\"Changing Keys\\", which was used in several variants from then until 2002. As for Jeopardy!, two different revivals of the show would be produced: one on NBC that ran for five months in late 1978/early 1979 with Art Fleming returning as host, and the other airing in first-run syndication beginning on September 10, 1984, starring Alex Trebek. The syndicated versions of both Jeopardy! and Wheel remain on the air today. In 1990, Griffin had an ambitious but unsuccessful attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly into a game show of the same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, with the intent of national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did get a look at it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN. Upon his retirement, Griffin sold his production company, Merv Griffin Enterprises, to the then-Columbia Pictures Television, at the time a unit of The Coca-Cola Company, for US$250 million on May 6, 1986, the largest acquisition of an entertainment company owned by a single individual at that time. Following the sale, Forbes named him the richest Hollywood performer in history. He retained the title of creator of both his game shows. The two powerhouses spun off numerous programs, and Griffin often would sign on as a creative consultant. The spin-offs included Wheel 2000 on CBS in 1997 and the short lived Jep! on GSN in 1998, both for children; Rock & Roll Jeopardy! on VH1 in 1998 for purveyors of pop music trivia; a teen-oriented game called Click!, which introduced Ryan Seacrest as its host, and‚Äîin association with Wink Martindale‚ÄîHeadline Chasers in 1985. On May 14, 2003, Griffin was honored with the Broadcast Music, Inc. (BMI) President's Award at its annual Film and Television Awards ceremony, for having created some of America's best-known game show melodies. In 2007, Griffin's production company, Merv Griffin Entertainment, began production on a new syndicated game show Merv Griffin's Crosswords (originally titled Let's Play Crosswords and Let's Do Crosswords). The show taped in Los Angeles after initial reports that it would be produced at WMAQ-TV in Chicago. The show was produced in association with Program Partners and the William Morris Agency and began airing September 10, 2007. NBC-owned-and-operated stations in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas carried the show, with many stations airing two episodes per day. The show lasted only one season, airing its last episode May 16, 2008; it has run in reruns on various channels since its cancellation. Business ventures Merv Griffin Way with the Beverly Hilton in the background Griffin ventured into real estate, purchasing the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills in 1987. In 1988 Griffin purchased Resorts International and two of their hotels, in Atlantic City, NJ and Paradise Island in the Bahamas from Donald Trump and other investors. Part of the deal was that Trump would buy Resorts' interest in the yet to be constructed Taj Mahal project for $273 million. Griffin subsequently sought bankruptcy court protection on December 23, 1989 for Resorts International Inc., his troubled hotel and casino operator. The background to this was on November 12, when Resorts reached a tentative agreement with certain bondholders, several bondholders petitioned the United States Bankruptcy Court in Camden, New Jersey, to put the company into involuntary bankruptcy to protect legal claims they might have against Trump, the real estate investor Griffin outbid for Resorts the prior year. As a result, this literally wiped out or greatly reduced the investments of the bondholders, so that Mr. Griffin could sue Trump and yet still retain a significant portion for himself. Besides Resorts International, the holding company for casinos in Atlantic City and the Bahamas, three company affiliates also filed for Chapter 11 protection: Griffin Resorts Inc., Resorts International Financing Inc. and Griffin Resorts Holding Inc. An active desert resident, he was a supporter of the La Quinta Arts Festival and the owner of the Merv Griffin Givenchy Resort & Spa in Palm Springs, now The Parker. He owned a ranch near La Quinta, California where he raised thoroughbred racehorses, as well as St. Clerans Manor, a boutique hotel, set in an eighteenth-century estate once owned by director John Huston, near Craughwell, in County Galway, Ireland. In the 1980s, Griffin purchased the Paradise Island Resort and Casino in the Bahamas for US$400 million from Trump, but he later sold it for just US$125 million. Griffin sold his empire to The Coca-Cola Company for $250 million in 1986, then went on a buying spree of hotels, so that his wealth in 2003 was said to be around $1.2 billion. Personal life Griffin was married to the former Julann Wright from 1958 to 1976; they remained friends after their divorce. The two had one son, Tony Griffin, born in 1959; Tony, in turn, had two children of his own. In an interview with The New York Times published on May 26, 2005, Griffin recalled a quip he frequently used when asked about his sexual orientation: \\"I tell everybody that I'm a quarter-sexual. I will do anything with anybody for a quarter.\\" He was otherwise secretive about the details of his business and personal life. In 1991, Deney Terrio, the host of the Griffin-created Dance Fever, sued Griffin, alleging sexual harassment, but the suit was dismissed. The same year, Brent Plott, a longtime employee who worked as a bodyguard, horse trainer and driver, filed a $200 million palimony lawsuit, which was also dismissed. Griffin characterized both lawsuits as extortion. Griffin's Los Angeles Times obituary repeated a 1991 statement he had made regarding Plott's lawsuit: \\"This is a shameless attempt to extort money from me. This former bodyguard and horse trainer was paid $250 a week, lived in one of two apartments underneath my former house as part of his security function, and left my payroll six or seven years ago. His charges are ridiculous and untrue.\\" On being wealthy, he said that \\"if people know you're rich, they don't talk with you when you walk down the street.\\" He kept his wealth an open secret, amassing media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at more than one billion dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it \\"would keep me from sleeping at night\\". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday. Griffin was also an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, having been friends with both of the Reagans for many years. Griffin was a longtime member of the Republican Party. =Honors= In 1974, Griffin was inducted to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Walk of Stars in Palm Springs was dedicated to him. In 2005, he accepted the degree Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) from the National University of Ireland, Galway, and in 2008, he was posthumously inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. Illness and death Griffin's grave, located at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Westwood, Los Angeles, California Griffin's prostate cancer, treated originally in 1996, returned and he was admitted to Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where his condition deteriorated, leading to his death on August 12, 2007, at the age of 82. Funeral services were held for Griffin on August 17, 2007, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. The well-attended service included Nancy Reagan; Arnold Schwarzenegger, who gave the eulogy along with Tony Griffin, Maria Shriver, and various actors, television stars, employees, and friends, including Pat Sajak, Vanna White, Alex Trebek, Dick Van Dyke, Jack Klugman, Dick Van Patten, Ellen DeGeneres, Portia de Rossi, Ryan Seacrest, Johnny Mathis, Catherine Oxenberg and Casper Van Dien. Pallbearers included Griffin Group vice-chairman Ron Ward, President Robert Pritchard, and Vice President Michael Eyre, as well as Tony Griffin. His 7-year-old grandson Donovan Mervyn was an honorary pallbearer as was Nancy Reagan. His 12-year-old granddaughter Farah gave a reading. A post-burial reception was held at the Beverly Hilton, a property owned by Griffin from 1987 to 2003. He was buried in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery and his headstone epitaph (even though in his book Merv, written with David Bender in 2003, states it would be \\"Stay Tuned\\") reads \\"I will _not_ be right back after this message\\", an epitaph Griffin announced on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. GSN honored Griffin by airing ten-episode marathons of Wheel and Jeopardy! during the weekend of August 18‚Äì19, 2007. The Wheel marathon included two episodes with cameo appearances by Griffin: Sajak's departure from the daytime version in 1989 and a 1992‚Äì93 episode that ended with Griffin, his band \\"The MervTones,\\" and White singing at a dinner club in Orlando, Florida. The Jeopardy! marathon consisted of a rerun of the Jeopardy! Million Dollar Masters Tournament from 2002. His estate was sold for $7 million.

SOLARIS synchrotron in Poland (electromagnets in storage ring) A synchrotron is a particular type of cyclic particle accelerator, descended from the cyclotron, in which the accelerating particle beam travels around a fixed closed-loop path. The magnetic field which bends the particle beam into its closed path increases with time during the accelerating process, being synchronized to the increasing kinetic energy of the particles (see image). The synchrotron is one of the first accelerator concepts to enable the construction of large-scale facilities, since bending, beam focusing and acceleration can be separated into different components. The most powerful modern particle accelerators use versions of the synchrotron design. The largest synchrotron-type accelerator, also the largest particle accelerator in the world, is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) near Geneva, Switzerland, built in 2008 by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). It can accelerate beams of protons to an energy of 6.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV). The synchrotron principle was invented by Vladimir Veksler in 1944. Edwin McMillan constructed the first electron synchrotron in 1945, arriving at the idea independently, having missed Veksler's publication (which was only available in a Soviet journal, although in English). The first proton synchrotron was designed by Sir Marcus Oliphant and built in 1952.  Types  Several specialized types of synchrotron machines are used today: *A storage ring is a special type of synchrotron in which the kinetic energy of the particles is kept constant. *A synchrotron light source is a combination of different electron accelerator types, including a storage ring in which the desired electromagnetic radiation is generated. This radiation is then used in experimental stations located on different beamlines. In addition to the storage ring, a synchrotron light source usually contains a linear accelerator (linac) and another synchrotron which is sometimes called a booster in this context. The linac and the booster are used to successively accelerate the electrons to their final energy before they are magnetically \\"kicked\\" into the storage ring. Synchrotron light sources in their entirety are sometimes called \\"synchrotrons,\\" although this is technically incorrect. *A cyclic collider is also a combination of different accelerator types, including two intersecting storage rings and the respective pre-accelerators.  Principle of operation  The synchrotron evolved from the cyclotron, the first cyclic particle accelerator. While a classical cyclotron uses both a constant guiding magnetic field and a constant-frequency electromagnetic field (and is working in classical approximation), its successor, the isochronous cyclotron, works by local variations of the guiding magnetic field, adapting the increasing relativistic mass of particles during acceleration. A drawing of the Cosmotron In a synchrotron, this adaptation is done by variation of the magnetic field strength in time, rather than in space. For particles that are not close to the speed of light, the frequency of the applied electromagnetic field may also change to follow their non-constant circulation time. By increasing these parameters accordingly as the particles gain energy, their circulation path can be held constant as they are accelerated. This allows the vacuum chamber for the particles to be a large thin torus, rather than a disk as in previous, compact accelerator designs. Also, the thin profile of the vacuum chamber allowed for a more efficient use of magnetic fields than in a cyclotron, enabling the cost-effective construction of larger synchrotrons. While the first synchrotrons and storage rings like the Cosmotron and ADA strictly used the toroid shape, the strong focusing principle independently discovered by Ernest Courant et al. and Nicholas Christofilos allowed the complete separation of the accelerator into components with specialized functions along the particle path, shaping the path into a round-cornered polygon. Some important components are given by radio frequency cavities for direct acceleration, dipole magnets (bending magnets) for deflection of particles (to close the path), and quadrupole / sextupole magnets for beam focusing. The interior of the Australian Synchrotron facility, a synchrotron light source. Dominating the image is the storage ring, showing a beamline at front right. The storage ring's interior includes a synchrotron and a linac. The combination of time-dependent guiding magnetic fields and the strong focusing principle enabled the design and operation of modern large-scale accelerator facilities like colliders and synchrotron light sources. The straight sections along the closed path in such facilities are not only required for radio frequency cavities, but also for particle detectors (in colliders) and photon generation devices such as wigglers and undulators (in third generation synchrotron light sources). The maximum energy that a cyclic accelerator can impart is typically limited by the maximum strength of the magnetic fields and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the particle path. Thus one method for increasing the energy limit is to use superconducting magnets, these not being limited by magnetic saturation. Electron/positron accelerators may also be limited by the emission of synchrotron radiation, resulting in a partial loss of the particle beam's kinetic energy. The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle. More powerful accelerators are built by using large radius paths and by using more numerous and more powerful microwave cavities. Lighter particles (such as electrons) lose a larger fraction of their energy when deflected. Practically speaking, the energy of electron/positron accelerators is limited by this radiation loss, while this does not play a significant role in the dynamics of proton or ion accelerators. The energy of such accelerators is limited strictly by the strength of magnets and by the cost. = Injection procedure = Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons are unable to accelerate particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons for this is that its closed particle path would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator. Starting from an appropriate initial value determined by the injection energy, the field strength of the dipole magnets is then increased. If the high energy particles are emitted at the end of the acceleration procedure, e.g. to a target or to another accelerator, the field strength is again decreased to injection level, starting a new injection cycle. Depending on the method of magnet control used, the time interval for one cycle can vary substantially between different installations.  In large- scale facilities  Soleil near Paris) One of the early large synchrotrons, now retired, is the Bevatron, constructed in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. The name of this proton accelerator comes from its power, in the range of 6.3 GeV (then called BeV for billion electron volts; the name predates the adoption of the SI prefix giga-). A number of transuranium elements, unseen in the natural world, were first created with this machine. This site is also the location of one of the first large bubble chambers used to examine the results of the atomic collisions produced here. Another early large synchrotron is the Cosmotron built at Brookhaven National Laboratory which reached 3.3 GeV in 1953.The Cosmotron Among the few synchrotrons around the world, 16 are located in the United States. Many of them belong to national laboratories; few are located in universities. = As part of colliders = Until August 2008, the highest energy collider in the world was the Tevatron, at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, in the United States. It accelerated protons and antiprotons to slightly less than 1 TeV of kinetic energy and collided them together. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which has been built at the European Laboratory for High Energy Physics (CERN), has roughly seven times this energy (so proton-proton collisions occur at roughly 14 TeV). It is housed in the 27 km tunnel which formerly housed the Large Electron Positron (LEP) collider, so it will maintain the claim as the largest scientific device ever built. The LHC will also accelerate heavy ions (such as lead) up to an energy of 1.15 PeV. The largest device of this type seriously proposed was the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), which was to be built in the United States. This design, like others, used superconducting magnets which allow more intense magnetic fields to be created without the limitations of core saturation. While construction was begun, the project was cancelled in 1994, citing excessive budget overruns -- this was due to na√Øve cost estimation and economic management issues rather than any basic engineering flaws. It can also be argued that the end of the Cold War resulted in a change of scientific funding priorities that contributed to its ultimate cancellation. However, the tunnel built for its placement still remains, although empty. While there is still potential for yet more powerful proton and heavy particle cyclic accelerators, it appears that the next step up in electron beam energy must avoid losses due to synchrotron radiation. This will require a return to the linear accelerator, but with devices significantly longer than those currently in use. There is at present a major effort to design and build the International Linear Collider (ILC), which will consist of two opposing linear accelerators, one for electrons and one for positrons. These will collide at a total center of mass energy of 0.5 TeV. = As part of synchrotron light sources = Synchrotron radiation also has a wide range of applications (see synchrotron light) and many 2nd and 3rd generation synchrotrons have been built especially to harness it. The largest of those 3rd generation synchrotron light sources are the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, the Advanced Photon Source (APS) near Chicago, USA, and SPring-8 in Japan, accelerating electrons up to 6, 7 and 8 GeV, respectively. Synchrotrons which are useful for cutting edge research are large machines, costing tens or hundreds of millions of dollars to construct, and each beamline (there may be 20 to 50 at a large synchrotron) costs another two or three million dollars on average. These installations are mostly built by the science funding agencies of governments of developed countries, or by collaborations between several countries in a region, and operated as infrastructure facilities available to scientists from universities and research organisations throughout the country, region, or world. More compact models, however, have been developed, such as the Compact Light Source.  Research  Synchrotrons are unique devices because they produce extraordinary synchrotron light (synchrotron radiation). The unique properties of this type of light include its enormous intensity; it is millions of times brighter than the light that comes to Earth from the Sun. In addition, synchrotron radiation contains electromagnetic waves from the infrared spectrum, through visible and ultraviolet light up to the X-rays. Thanks to this, scientists can study various materials in many ways, both externally and internally. In this way, they learn how these materials are built, and what their chemical composition and electrical or magnetic properties are. Many types of measurements are possible only when synchrotron light is used. This light also allows scientists to get better quality information in less time than by using traditional light sources. Because synchrotrons offer such vast opportunities, they are used in many branches of science such as biology, chemistry, physics, material engineering, nanotechnology, medicine, pharmacology, geology, and crystallography. Synchrotrons are extremely efficient; they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing radiation for scientists conducting measurements simultaneously at many experimental end-stations. They are real research factories.https://synchrotron.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/dla-gosci-i-mediow/solaris-w- pigulce Applications * Life sciences: protein and large-molecule crystallography * LIGA based microfabrication * Drug discovery and research * X-ray lithography * Analysing chemicals to determine their composition * Observing the reaction of living cells to drugs * Inorganic material crystallography and microanalysis * Fluorescence studies * Semiconductor material analysis and structural studies * Geological material analysis * Medical imaging * Particle therapy to treat some forms of cancer * Radiometry: calibration of detectors and radiometric standards See also * List of synchrotron radiation facilities * Synchrotron light * Computed X-ray tomography * Energy amplifier * Superconducting radio frequency * Coherent diffraction imaging References External links *ESRF (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) *National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan *Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste - Elettra and Fermi lightsources *Canadian Light Source *Australian Synchrotron *French synchrotron Soleil *Diamond UK Synchrotron *Lightsources.org *IAEA database of electron synchrotron and storage rings *CERN Large Hadron Collider *Synchrotron Light Sources of the World *A Miniature Synchrotron: room-size synchrotron offers scientists a new way to perform high-quality x-ray experiments in their own labs, Technology Review, February 4, 2008 *Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory *Podcast interview with a scientist at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility *Indian SRS * Sameen Ahmed Khan, Synchrotron Radiation (in Asia), ATIP Report, No. ATIP02.034, 28 pages (21 August 2002).

It is used by listeners for yoga, massage, meditation, reading as a method of stress management to bring about a state of ecstasy rather than trance, or to create a peaceful atmosphere in their home or other environments, and is associated with environmentalism and New Age spirituality. New-age music includes both acoustic forms, featuring instruments such as flutes, piano, acoustic guitar and a wide variety of non- Western acoustic instruments, and electronic forms, frequently relying on sustained synth pads or long sequencer-based runs. Vocal arrangements were initially rare in the genre, but as it has evolved vocals have become more common, especially those featuring Native American-, Sanskrit-, or Tibetan- influenced chants, or lyrics based on mythology such as Celtic legends. There is no exact definition of new-age music. An article in Billboard magazine in 1987 commented that \\"New Age music may be the most startling successful non- defined music ever to hit the public consciousness\\". Many consider it to be an umbrella term for marketing rather than a musical category, and to be part of a complex cultural trend. New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres. Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording. Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside) was one of the important predecessors. Irv Teibel's Environments series (1969‚Äì79) featured natural soundscapes, tintinnabulation, and \\"Om\\" chants and were some of the first publicly available psychoacoustic recordings. Steven Halpern's 1975 Spectrum Suite was a key work that began the new-age music movement.Wright, Carol. Spectrum Suite‚ÄîSteven Halpern. AllMusic. Definitions New-age music is defined more by the use and effect or feeling it produces rather than the instruments and genre used in its creation; it may be acoustic, electronic, or a mixture of both. New-age artists range from solo or ensemble performances using classical-music instruments ranging from the piano, acoustic guitar, flute or harp to electronic musical instruments, or from Eastern instruments such as the sitar, tabla, and tamboura. There is also a significant overlap of sectors of new-age music with ambient music, classical music, jazz, electronica, world music, chillout, space music, pop music and others. The two definitions typically associated with the new-age genre are: * New-age music with an ambient sound that has the explicit purpose of aiding meditation and relaxation, or aiding and enabling various alternative spiritual practices, such as alternative healing, yoga practice, guided meditation, chakra auditing, and so on. The proponents of this definition are almost always musicians who create their music expressly for these purposes.Steven Halpern, New Age Voice Magazine, June 1999 issue To be useful for meditation music needs to have repetitive dynamic and texture, without sudden loud chords and improvisation which could disturb the meditator. It is minimalist in conception, and thus are mostly instrumentalist rather than vocalist musicians. Subliminal messages are also used in new-age music, and the use of music instruments along with the natural sounds of the animals (like whales, wolves and eagles) and nature (waterfalls, ocean waves, rain) is also popular. Flautist Dean Evenson was one of the first musicians to combine peaceful music with the sounds of nature launching a genre that became popular for massage and yoga. Other prominent artists who create new-age music expressly for healing or meditation include Irv Teibel, Paul Horn, Deuter, Steven Halpern, Paul Winter, Lawrence Ball, Karunesh, Krishna Das, Deva Premal, Bhagavan Das, Snatam Kaur and so on. * Music which is found in the new-age sections of record stores. This is largely a definition of practicality, given the breadth of music that is classified as \\"new age\\" by retailers who are often less interested in finely grained distinctions between musical styles than are fans of those styles. Music which falls into this definition is usually music which cannot be easily classified into other, more common definitions, but can contain almost any kind of music‚Äîit is more a marketing slogan rather than musical category. =Debate and criticism= Kitaro, a prominent New Age music artist from Japan Stephen Hill, founder of the Hearts of Space in 1973, considers that \\"many of the artists are very sincerely and fully committed to New Age ideas and ways of life\\". Some composers like Kitar≈ç consider their music to be part of their spiritual growth, as well expressing values and shaping the culture. Douglas Groothuis stated that rejection of all music labeled as \\"new age\\" would be to fall prey to a taboo and quarantine mentality, as most of the music belongs to the \\"progressive\\" side of new-age music, where composers necessarily do not have a New Age worldview. However, it is often noted that \\"New-age music\\" is a mere popular designation which successfully sells records. J. Gordon Melton argued it does not refer to a specific genre of music, but to music which is used in therapeutic or other new-age purposes. Kay Gardner considered that the label \\"New Age\\" is considered an inauthentic commercial intention of the so-called new-age music. She commented that \\"a lot of New Age music is schlock\\" and how due to records sales everyone with a home studio put in some sounds of crickets, oceans, or rivers, as a guarantee of sales. What started as ambient mood music related with New Age activity, became a term for a musical conglomeration of jazz, folk, rock, ethnic, classical, and electronic, among other music styles, with the former and markedly different musical and theoretical movement. Thus under the umbrella term, some consider that the Mike Oldfield's progressive rock album Tubular Bells (1973) became one of the first albums to be referred to under the genre description of New Age. Others consider that music by the Greek composer Vangelis, and general modern jazz- rock fusion, exemplify the progressive side of new-age music. Other artists included are Jean-Michel Jarre (even though his electronic excursions predate the term), Andreas Vollenweider, George Winston, Mark Isham, Michael Hedges, Shadowfax, Mannheim Steamroller, Kitar≈ç, Yanni, Enya, Clannad, Enigma among others. However, many musicians and composers dismiss the labeling of their music as \\"New age\\". When the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album was first created in 1987, its first winner, Andreas Vollenweider, said \\"I don't have any intention to label my music... It's ridiculous to give a name to anything that is timeless\\". Peter Bryant, music director of WHYY-FM (90.9) and host of a New-age program, noted that \\"I don't care for the term... New-age has a negative connotation... In the circles I come in contact with, people working in music, 'new-age' is almost an insult\\", that it refers to \\"very vapid, dreamy kinds of dull music... with no substance or form or interest\\", and that the term has \\"stuck\\". Harold Budd commented how \\"When I hear the term 'new-age I reach for my revolver... I don't think of myself as making music that is only supposed to be in the background. It's embarrassing to inadvertently be associated with something that you know in your guts is vacuous\\". Vangelis considers it a style which \\"gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music\\". Yanni stated that \\"I don't want to relax the audience; I want to engage them in the music, get them interested\\", and that \\"New age implies a more subdued, more relaxed music than what I do. My music can be very rhythmic, very energetic, even very ethnic\\". David Van Tieghem, George Winston and Kitar≈ç also rejected the label of new-age artist. David Lanz argued that he had \\"finally figured out that the main reason people don't like the term New Age is because it's the only musical category that isn't a musical term\\". Andreas Vollenweider noted that \\"we have sold millions of records worldwide before the category New Age was actually a category\\", and shared the concern that \\"the stores are having this problem with categorization\\". Ron Goldstein, president of Private Music, agreed with such a standpoint, and explained that \\"Windham Hill was the hub of this whole thing. Because of that association, New-age has come to be perceived as this West Coast thing\\". However, the label managing director Sam Sutherland, argued that even founders of Windham Hill, William Ackerman and Anne Robinson, \\"shied away from using any idiomatic or generic term at all. It's always seemed a little synthetic\\", and as a company they stopped making any kind of deliberate protests to the use of the term simply because it was inappropriate. Both Goldstein and Sutherland concluded that the tag has helped move merchandise, and that new-age music will be absorbed into the general body of pop music within a few years from 1987. The New York Times music critic Jon Pareles noted that \\"new-age music\\" absorbed other music styles in more softer form, but those same well defined styles don't need the new-age category, and that \\"new-age music\\" resembles other music because it is aimed as a marketing niche‚Äîto be a \\"formula show\\" designated for urban \\"ultra-consumers\\" as status accessory, that the Andean, Asian and African traditional music influences invoke the sense of \\"cosmopolitanism\\", while nature in the album artwork and sound the \\"connection to unspoiled landscapes\\". =Alternative terms= As described in this article, the borders of this umbrella genre are not well defined; however music retail stores will include artists in the \\"new-age\\" category even if the artists belong to different genre, and themselves use different names for their style of music. Here are some other terms used instead of \\"new-age\\": Kay Gardner called the original new-age music \\"healing music\\" or \\"women's spirituality\\". Paul Winter, who is considered a new-age music pioneer, also dismissed the term, and preferred \\"earth music\\". The term \\"instrumental music\\" or \\"contemporary instrumental\\" can include artists that do not use electronic instruments in their music, such as solo pianist David Lanz. Similarly, pianists such as Yanni and Bradley Joseph both use this term as well, although they use keyboards to incorporate layered orchestral textures into their compositions. Yanni has distinguished the music genre from the spiritual movement bearing the same name.Puckett, Jeffrey Lee, \\"Yanni up close: Musician known for larger-than-life venues also loves the Louisville Palace\\", The Courier-Journal, April 26, 2012. The term \\"contemporary instrumental music\\" was also suggested by Andreas Vollenweider, while \\"adult alternative\\" by Gary L. Chappell, which was the term by which Billboard called the new-age and world-music album charts. History The concept arose with the involvement of professional musicians in the New-Age movement. Initially, it was of no interest to the musical industry, so the musicians and related staff founded their own small independent recording businesses. Sales reached significant numbers in unusual outlets such as bookstores, gift stores, health-food stores and boutiques, as well as by direct mail. With the demand of a large market, the major recording companies began promoting new-age music in the 1980s. New-age music was influenced by a wide range of artists from a variety of genres‚Äîfor example, folk-instrumentalists John Fahey and Leo Kottke, minimalists Terry Riley, Steve Reich, La Monte Young, and Philip Glass, classical avant-garde Daniel Kobialka, synthesizer performers Brian Eno, and jazz artists Keith Jarrett, Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, Paul Horn (beginning with 1968's Inside), Paul Winter (beginning in the mid-1960s with the Paul Winter Consort) and Pat Metheny.Birosik, Patti Jean (1989). The New Age Music Guide. Collier Books. .Werkhoven, Henk N. (1997). The International Guide to New Age Music. Billboard Books / Crown Publishing Group. . Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964) is considered to be the first new-age recording., but initially it was popular mostly in California, and was not sold nationally until the 1980s. Another school of meditation music arose among the followers of Rajneesh; Deuter recorded D (1971) and Aum (1972), which mixed acoustic and electronic instruments with sounds of the sea. Kay Gardner's song Lunamuse (1974) and first recording Mooncircles (1975), which were a synthesis of music, sexuality and Wiccan spirituality, were \\"new-age music before it got to be new-age music\\". Her A Rainbow Path (1984) embraced Halpern's theory of healing music from that time with women's spirituality, and she became one of the most popular new-age sacred-music artists. Paul Winter's Missa Gaia/Earth Mass (1982) is described as \\"a masterpiece of New Age ecological consciousness that celebrates the sacredness of land, sky, and sea\\". His work on the East Coast is considered to be one of the most important musical expressions of new-age spirituality. On the West Coast, musicians concentrated more on music for healing and meditation. The most notable early work was Steven Halpern's Spectrum Suite (1975), the musical purpose of which was described as to \\"resonate specific areas of the body... it quiets the mind and body\\", and whose title relates \\"to the seven tones of the musical scale and the seven colors of the rainbow to the seven etheric energy sources (chakras) in our bodies\\". In the 1970s his music work, and the theoretical book Tuning the Human Instrument (1979), pioneered the contemporary practice of musical healing in the United States. In 1976 the record label Windham Hill Records was founded, with an initial $300 investment, and would gross over $26 million annually ten years later. Over the years many record labels were formed that embraced or rejected the new-age designation, such as Narada Productions, Private Music, Music West, Lifestyle, Audion, Sonic Atmospheres, Living Music, Terra (Vanguard Records), Novus Records (which mainly recorded jazz music), FM (CBS Masterworks) and Cinema (Capitol Records). Between the intentional extremes of the West and East Coast are some of the most successful new-age artists, like George Winston and R. Carlos Nakai. Winston's million-selling December (1982), released by Windham Hill Records, was highly popular. Most of Nakai's work, with first release Changes in 1983, consists of improvised songs in native North American style. During the 1990s, his music became virtual anthems for new-age spirituality. In 1981, Tower Records in Mountain View, California added a \\"new age\\" bin. By 1985, independent and chain record retail stores were adding sections for new age, and major labels began showing interest in the genre, both through acquisition of some existing new-age labels such as Paul Winter's Living Music and through signing of so-called \\"new-age\\" artists such as Japanese electronic composer Kitar≈ç and American crossover jazz musician Pat Metheny, both signed by Geffen Records. Most of the major record labels accepted new age artists by the beginning of the next year. In the late 1980s the umbrella genre was the fastest-growing genre with significant radio broadcast. It was seen as an attractive business due to low recording costs. From 1982 to 1989, working on his own and with Lura Jane Geiger, Adam Geiger, New Age Composer/Keyboardist, produced and sold a series of cassette tapes of New Age music on the LuraMedia recording label. Stephen Hill founded the new-age radio show Hearts of Space in 1973. In 1983, was picked up by NPR for syndication to 230 affiliates nationally, and year later was started a record label Hearts of Space Records. On Valentine's Day in 1987, the former Los Angeles rock radio station KMET changed to a full-time new-age music format with new call letters KTWV, branded as The Wave. During The Wave's new-age period, management told the station employees to refer to The Wave as a \\"mood service\\" rather than a \\"radio station\\". DJs stopped announcing the titles of the songs, and instead, to maintain an uninterrupted mood, listeners could call a 1‚Äì800 phone number to find out what song was playing. News breaks were also re-branded and referred to as \\"wave breaks\\". Other new-age-specialty radio programs included Forest's Musical Starstreams and John Diliberto's Echoes. Most major cable television networks have channels that play music without visuals, including channels for New age, such as the \\"Soundscapes\\" channel on Music Choice. The two satellite radio companies Sirius Satellite Radio & XM Satellite Radio each had their own channels that played new-age music. Sirius‚ÄîSpa (Sirius XM) (73), XM‚ÄîAudio Visions (77). When the two merged in November 2008 and became SiriusXM, the Spa name was retained for the music channel with the majority of Audio Vision‚Äôs music library being used. In 1987 was formed the Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, while in 1988 the Billboard's New Age weekly charts. In 1989 Suzanne Doucet produced and held the first international New-Age Music Conference in Los Angeles. By 1989, there were over 150 small independent record labels releasing new-age music, while new-age and adult-alternative programs were carried on hundreds of commercial and college radio stations in the U.S., and over 40 distributors were selling new-age music through mail- order catalogs. In the 1990s many small labels of new-age style music emerged in Japan, but for this kind of instrumental music the terms \\"relaxing\\" or \\"healing\\" music were more popular. Enigma's Sadeness (Part I) became an international hit, reaching number one in 24 countries including UK, also number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling over 5 million worldwide. At the time Holland was the home of two leading European new-age labels‚ÄîOreade and Narada Media. Oreade reported that in 1997 the latest trend was \\"angelic\\" music, while from Narada Media predicted that the genre will develop in the direction of world music (with Celtic, Irish and African influences). In 1995 some \\"new-age\\" composers like Kitar≈ç, Suzanne Ciani and Patrick O'Hearn moved from major to independent record labels due to lack of promotion, diminishing sales or limited freedom of creativity. In 2001 Windham Hill celebrated its 25th anniversary, Narada and Higher Octave Music continued to move into world and ethno-techno music, and Hearts of Space Records were bought by Valley Entertainment. Enya's \\"Only Time\\" peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the album A Day Without Rain at #2 on the Billboard 200, being the number one new-age artist of the year. Today, new-age music flourishes on streaming sites like Spotify and Tidal.

In this picture the recto page shown is of the following page in a book and hence comes next to the verso of the previous page. Recto is the \\"right\\" or \\"front\\" side and verso is the \\"left\\" or \\"back\\" side when text is written or printed on a leaf of paper () in a bound item such as a codex, book, broadsheet, or pamphlet. Etymology The terms are shortened from Latin: and ' (which translate as \\"on the right side of the leaf\\" and \\"on the back side of the leaf\\"). The two opposite pages themselves are called ' and ' in Latin, e.g. Quibus carminibus finitur totum primum folium versum (rectum vacat) voluminis \\"These poems finish the full back page (the front is blank) of the first leaf of the volume\\" [Giovanni Battista Audiffredi], Catalogus historico- criticus Romanarum editionum saeculi XV (1783), p. 225. and the ablative ', ' already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to. Usage In codicology, each physical sheet (', abbreviated fol. or f.) of a manuscript is numbered and the sides are referred to as ' and ', abbreviated as r and v respectively. Editions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form fol. 1r, sometimes with the r and v in superscript, as in 1r, or with a superscript o indicating the ablative ', ', as in 1ro. e.g. Roberts, Longinus on the Sublime: The Greek Text Edited After the Paris Manuscript (2011), 170; Wijngaards, The Ordained Women Deacons of the Church's First Millennium (2012), 232; etc. Tylus, Manuscrits fran√ßais de la collection berlinoise disponibles √† la Biblioth√®que Jagellonne de Cracovie (XVIe-XIXe si√®cles) (2010) This terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century. Lyons (2011) argues that the term ' \\"right, correct, proper\\" for the front side of the leaf derives from the use of papyrus in Late Antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually papyrus would carry writing only on the \\"correct\\", smooth side (and just in exceptional cases would there be writing on the reverse side of the leaf).Martyn Lyons (2011). Books A Living History. Getty Publications. p. 21. . The terms \\"recto\\" and \\"verso\\" are also used in the codicology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like Syriac, Arabic and Hebrew. However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right. The reading order of each folio remains first verso, then recto regardless of writing direction. The terms are carried over into printing; 'Recto verso is an expression in French that means \\"two sides of a sheet or page\\". In Flanders the term recto verso is also used to indicate two- sided printing. Duplex printers are referred to as recto verso printers. is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the printing press over the much older Asian woodblock printing method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper. The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the annotation of scholarly books, particularly in bilingual edition translations. The \\"recto\\" and \\"verso\\" terms can also be employed for the front and back of a one-sheet artwork, particularly in drawing. A drawing is a sheet with drawings on both sides, for example in a sketchbook‚Äîalthough usually in these cases there is no obvious primary side. Some works are planned to exploit being on two sides of the same piece of paper, but usually the works are not intended to be considered together. Paper was relatively expensive in the past; indeed good drawing paper still is much more expensive than normal paper. By book publishing convention, the first page of a book, and sometimes of each section and chapter of a book, is a recto page, and hence all recto pages will have odd numbers and all verso pages will have even numbers. In many early printed books or incunables and still in some 16th- century books (e.g. Jo√£o de Barros's D√©cadas da √Åsia), it is the (\\"leaves\\") rather than the pages, that are numbered. Thus each carries a consecutive number on its recto side, while on the verso side there is no number.See e.g. a modern reprint of the 3rd D√©cada (1563): √Åsia de Jo√£o de Barros: Dos feitos que os Portugueses fizeram no descobrimento e conquista dos mares e terras do Oriente. Tercera D√©cada. Imprensa Nacional ‚Äì Casa da Moeda, 1992. This was also very common in e.g. internal company reports in the 20th century, before double-sided printers became commonplace in offices.

Use of this phrase is first attested in 1901. The term mama's boy has a connotation of effeminacy and weakness. In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the term Oedipus complex denotes a child's desire to have sexual relations with the parent of the opposite sex.

This difference is reflected in how the two works use the prosimetrum format: in the Vita Nova there is a complex interrelation and intertwining between the prose and the poetry, while in the Convivio large blocks of prose have an autonomous existence apart from the poems; the content of the poetry is not amplified or edited in the prose so much as commented upon prosaically, to serve as points of departure for the various subjects that the Convivio discusses. Dante himself tells us that the prose of the Convivio is \\"temperate and virile,\\" in contrast to the \\"fervid and passionate\\" prose of the Vita Nova; and that while the approach to this in the work of his youth was \\"like dreaming\\" the Convivio approaches it subjects soberly and wide awake, often modeling its style on Scholastic authors. The Convivio is a kind of vernacular encyclopedia of the knowledge of Dante's time; it touches on many areas of learning, not only philosophy but also politics, linguistics, science, and history. The treatise begins with the prefatory book, or proem, which explains why a book like the Convivio is needed and why Dante is writing it in the vernacular instead of Latin. It is one of Dante's early defenses of the vernacular, expressed in greater detail in his (slightly earlier) linguistic treatise De vulgari eloquentia (On Eloquence in the Vernacular). Books 2 and 3 form a unit, both focusing on Dante's new love after the death of Beatrice‚Äîhis love for Lady Philosophy, \\"the most beautiful and dignified daughter of the Emperor of the universe,\\" as he calls her. Book 2 discusses allegory and Lady Philosophy (in connection with the canzone Voi che ‚Äôntendendo il terzo ciel movete [You who move the third heaven with an act of the intellect], which opens the book), and also brings such subjects as astronomy, angelology, and the soul's immortality. Book 3 is a hymn of praise for philosophy, launched by an allegorical interpretation of Dante's great canzone Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona (Love, who speaks to me in my mind). In this book, Dante asserts that true philosophy cannot arise from any ulterior motives, such as prestige or money‚Äîit is only possible when the seeker has a love of wisdom for its own sake. Book 4 is by far the longest of the Convivio, and is noticeably distinct from the two books that precede it. The subject of book 4 is the nature of nobility. It opens with the longest canzone of the Convivio, Le dolci rime d‚Äôamor (Those sweet poems of love), which is explicitly about gentilezza or nobility, as well as a condemnation of avarice, asserting that reason and the spirit of acquisition are mutually incompatible. The first half of book 4's thirty chapters are dedicated to debunking the false idea of nobility as an inherited trait, one restricted to the aristocracy, while the final fifteen chapters delineate what true nobility consists of‚Äîthe perfection of a thing according to its nature‚Äîand how nobility manifests in people at various stages of life. The Convivio, in its autobiographical passages and in the trajectories of its lines of thought, gives us a rich portrait of Dante himself, of great importance for an understanding of his work as a whole, especially the Divine Comedy.

Headquartered in Reston, Virginia, it is the oldest national engineering society in the United States. Its constitution was based on the older Boston Society of Civil Engineers from 1848.Perspectives in Civil Engineering: Commemorating the 150th Anniversary of the American Society of Civil Engineers Jeffrey S. Russell; ASCE Publications, January 1, 2003; 392 pages, page 129 \\"They used the constitution of the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, founded four years earlier, as a framework.\\" ASCE is dedicated to the advancement of the science and profession of civil engineering and the enhancement of human welfare through the activities of society members. It has more than 152,000 members in 177 countries. Its mission is to provide essential value to members, their careers, partners, and the public; facilitate the advancement of technology; encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning; promote professionalism and the profession; develop and support civil engineers. History The first serious and documented attempts to organize civil engineers as a professional society in the newly created United States were in the early 19th century.Goldman, Joanne Abel.

The American civil engineer: Origins and conflict. Technology Press, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1960. In 1828, John Kilbourn of Ohio, managed a short-lived \\"Civil Engineering Journal\\", editorializing about the recent incorporation of the Institution of Civil Engineers in Great Britain that same year, Kilbourn suggested that the American corps of engineers could constitute an American society of civil engineers. Later, in 1834, an American trade periodical, the \\"American Railroad Journal\\" advocated for similar national organization of civil engineers. = Institution of American Civil Engineers = On December 17, 1838, a petition started circulating asking civil engineers to meet in 1839 in Baltimore, Maryland to organize a permanent society of civil engineers. Prior to that, thirteen notable civil engineers largely identifiable as being from New York, Pennsylvania, or Maryland met in Philadelphia. This group presented the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia with a formal proposal that an Institution of American Civil Engineers be established as an adjunct of the Franklin...\\" Some of them were: * Benjamin Wright. In 1969, the American Society of Civil Engineers declared Wright to be the 'Father of American Civil Engineering'. * William Strickland * Pennsylvanians Edward Miller and Solomon. W. Roberts, the latter being Chief Engineer for the Allegheny Portage railroad, the first crossing of the Allegheny mountains (1831‚Äì1834) Forty engineers actually appeared at the February 1839 meeting Baltimore including J. Edgar Thomson (Future Chief Engineer and later President of the Pennsylvania Railroad), Wright, Roberts, Edward Miller, and the Maryland engineers Isaac Trimble and architect Benjamin H. Latrobe and attendees from as far as Massachusetts, Illinois, and Louisiana. Subsequently, a group met again in Philadelphia, led by its Secretary, Edward Miller to take steps to formalize the society, participants now included such other notable engineers as: * John B. Jervis * Claudius Crozet * William Gibbs McNeill * George Washington Whistler * Walter Gwynn * J. Edgar Thompson * Sylvester Welch, brother of future ASCE president Ashbel Welch * Other members included Jonathan Knight and Moncure Robinson. Miller drafted up a proposed constitution which gave the society's purpose as \\"the collection and diffusion of professional knowledge, the advancement of mechanical philosophy, and the elevation of the character and standing of the Civil Engineers of the United States.\\" Membership in the new society restricted membership to engineers and \\"architects and eminent machinists were to be admitted only as Associates.\\" Hunt, C. Warren. (1897). Historical sketch of the American Society of Civil Engineers. New York: [Printed by order of the Board of Direction]. Accessed at HathiTrust The proposed constitution failed, and no further attempts were made to form another society. Miller later ascribed the failure due to the difficulties of assembling members due available means for traveling in the country at time. One of the other difficulties members would have to contend with was the requirement to produce each year, one previously unpublished paper or \\"...present a scientific book, map, plan or model, not already in the possession of the Society, under the penalty of $10.\\" In that same period, the editor of the American Railroad Journal commented that effort had failed in part due to certain jealousies which arose due to the proposed affiliation with the Franklin Institute. That journal continued discussion on forming an engineers' organization from 1839 thru 1843 serving its own self interests in advocating its journal as a replacement for a professional society but to no avail. = The American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects = During the 1840s, professional organizations continued to develop and organize in the United States. The organizers motives were largely to \\"improve common standards, foster research, and disseminate knowledge through meetings and publications.\\"Schlesinger, A. (1944). Biography of a Nation of Joiners. The American Historical Review, 50(1), 1-25. doi:10.2307/1843565 Accessed on November 9, 2017, at JSTOR=1843556. Unlike earlier associations such as the American Philosophical Society, these newer associations were not seeking to limit membership as much as pursue \\"more specialized interests.\\" Examples of this surge in new professional organizations in America were the American Statistical Association (1839), American Ethnological Society (1842), American Medical Association (1847), American Association for the Advancement of Science, (1848) and National Education Association (1852). During this same period of association incorporations on the 1840s, attempts were again made at organizing an American engineer association. They succeeded at first with the Boston Society of Civil Engineers, organized in 1848 and then in October 1852, with an effort to organize a Society of Civil Engineers and Architects in New York. Led by Alfred W. Craven, Chief Engineer of the Croton Aqueduct and future ASCE president, the meeting resolved to incorporate the society under the name \\"American Society of Civil Engineers And Architects\\". Membership eligibility was restricted to \\"civil, geological, mining and mechanical Engineers, architects, and other persons who, by profession, are interested in the advancement of science.\\" James Laurie was elected the society's first president. The meetings only went through 1855 and with the advent of the American Civil War, the society suspended its activities. The next meeting was more than twelve years later in 1867. A number of the original founders such as James Laurie, J.W. Adams, C. W. Copeland and W. H. Talcott were at this meeting and were dedicated to the objective of resuscitating the Society. They also planned to put the society on a more permanent footing as well as electing fifty-four new members to the Society. With success in that effort, the young engineering society passed a resolution noting that its preservation was mainly due to the persevering efforts of its first president, James Laurie. The address of President James Pugh Kirkwood delivered at that meeting in 1867 was the first publication of the Society, appearing in Volume 1 of \\"Transactions\\", bearing date of 1872. = 19th century = At an early meeting of the Board of Direction in 1852, instructions were given for the incorporation of the \\"American Society of Civil Engineers and Architects\\" but this was the proper steps were never taken, and therefore this name never legally belonged to the Association. On March 4, 1868, by a vote of 17 to 4, the name was changed to \\"American Society of Civil Engineers\\", but it was not until April 17, 1877, that the lack of incorporation was discovered and the proper steps taken to remedy the defect. The society was then chartered and incorporated in New York state. American Society of Civil Engineers., American Society of Civil Engineers., (1877).

Nora Stanton Blatch Barney 1921 =20th century= Nora Stanton Barney was among the first women in the United States to earn a civil engineering degree, graduating from Cornell University in 1905 with a degree in civil engineering. In the same year, she was accepted as a junior member of the organization and began work for the New York City Board of Water Supply. She was the first female member of ASCE, where she was allowed to be a junior member, but was denied advancement to associate member in 1916 because of her gender. In 2015, she was posthumously advanced to ASCE Fellow status. U.S. stamp commemorating the 100th anniversary of the ASCE in 1952 In 1999, the ASCE elected the top- ten \\"civil engineering achievements that had the greatest positive impact on life in the 20th century\\" in \\"broad categories\\". Monuments of the Millennium were a \\"combination of technical engineering achievement, courage and inspiration, and a dramatic influence on the development of [their] communities\\". The achievements and monuments that best exemplified them included: * Airport design and development the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan * Dams the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River in the United States * Interstate Highway System \\"the system overall\\" * Long-span bridges like the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California * Rail transportation as exemplified by the Eurotunnel rail system connecting the UK and France * Sanitary landfills and solid waste disposal \\"sanitary waste disposal advances overall\\" * Skyscrapers the Empire State Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City * Wastewater treatment the Chicago wastewater system * Water supply and distribution the California State Water Project * Water transportation the Panama Canal Overview ASCE's mission is to deliver essential value to \\"its members, their careers, our partners, and the public\\" as well as enable \\"the advancement of technology, encourage and provide the tools for lifelong learning, promote professionalism and the profession.\\" The Society also seeks to \\"develop and support civil engineer leaders, and advocate infrastructure and environmental stewardship.\\" The Society as an exempt organization in the United States (Section 501(c)(3)) was required to reported its program service accomplishments and related expenses and revenues. =Publications= ASCE stated that dissemination of technical and professional information to the civil engineering profession was a major goal of the society. This is accomplished through a variety of publications and information products, including 35 technical and professional journals amongst them the ASCE Journal of Structural Engineering, the Journal of Environmental Engineering, the Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, Journal of Hydrologic Engineering, the Journal of Transportation Engineering, Part A: Systems, Journal of Water Resources Planning and Management, Civil Engineering, the Society's monthly magazine, an online bibliographic database, conference proceedings, standards, manuals of practice and technical reports. The ASCE Library contains 470+ E-books and standards, some with chapter-level access and no restrictive DRM, and 600+ online proceedings. =Conferences, meetings, and education= Each year, more than 55,000 engineers earn continuing education units (CEUs) and/or professional development hours (PDHs) by participating in ASCE's continuing education programs. ASCE hosts more than 15 annual and specialty conferences, over 200 continuing education seminars and more than 300 live web seminars. Meetings include \\"...committees, task forces, focus groups, workshops and seminars designed to bring together civil engineering experts either from specific fields or those with a broad range of experience and skills. These meetings deal with specific topics and issues facing civil engineers such as America's failing infrastructure, sustainability, earthquakes, and bridge collapses.\\" =Engineering programs= The engineering programs division directly advances the science of engineering by delivering technical content for ASCE's publications, conferences and continuing education programs. It consists of eight discipline specific institutes, four technical divisions and six technical councils. The work is accomplished by over 600 technical committees with editorial responsibility for 28 of ASCE's 33 journals. On an annual basis, the division conducts more than twelve congresses and specialty conferences. As a founding society of ANSI and accredited standards development organization, ASCE committees use an established and audited process to produce consensus standards under a program supervised by the Society's Codes and Standards Committee. Civil Engineering Certification Inc. (CEC), affiliated with ASCE, has been established to support specialty certification academies for civil engineering specialties and is accredited by the Council of Engineering and Scientific Specialty Boards (CESB). CEC also handles safety certification for state, municipal, and federal buildings, formerly the province of the now-defunct Building Security Council. The Committee on Critical Infrastructure (CCI) provides vision and guidance on ASCE activities related to critical infrastructure resilience, including planning, design, construction, O&M;, and event mitigation, response and recovery. Certification is the recognition of attaining advanced knowledge and skills in a specialty area of civil engineering. ASCE offers certifications for engineers who demonstrate advanced knowledge and skills in their area of engineering. *American Academy of Water Resources Engineers (AAWRE) *Academy of Geo-Professionals (AGP) *Academy of Coastal, Ocean, Port & Navigation Engineers (ACOPNE) Institutes ASCE also has nine full-service institutes created to serve working professionals working within specialized fields of civil engineering: *Architectural Engineering Institute (AEI) *Coasts, Oceans, Ports and Rivers Institute (COPRI) *Construction Institute (CI) *Engineering Mechanics Institute (EMI) *Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) *Geo-Institute (G-I) *Transportation and Development Institute (T&DI;) *Structural Engineering Institute (SEI) *Utility Engineering & Surveying Institute (UESI) Advocacy To advance its policy mission, ASCE \\"...identifies legislation to improve the nation's infrastructure, and advance the profession of engineering specifically, ASCE lobbied on legislation at the Federal, State and local levels. In 2015, ASCE's Lobbying at the Federal level was focused primarily upon: *Reauthorization of the federal surface transportation programs such as Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) *Reauthorization of the brownfields revitalization and environmental restoration act. *Reauthorization of the national dam safety program and creation of a national levee safety program due to National Levee Safety Act Of 2007, WRDA Title IX, Section 9000. *Reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund program *Reauthorization of the drinking water state revolving fund program *Water resources development act *funding for stem education programs *Reauthorization of the 1977 national earthquake hazards reduction program *Reauthorization of the national windstorm impact reduction act *Safe building code incentive act *Appropriations for federal programs relating to civil engineering, including surface transportation, aviation, water resources, environment, education, homeland security, and research and development. Lobbying at the state and local level focused primarily upon licensure of civil engineers, procurement of engineering services, continuing education, and the financing of infrastructure improvements as well as lobbying at the state level to raise the minimum requirements for licensure as a professional engineer as part of ASCE's Raise the Bar (RTB) and Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (CEBoK) initiatives. For 2018, ASCE identified Federal advocacy priorities as follows: * Civil engineering education (higher education) * Clean water, drinking water and wastewater issues * Natural hazards mitigation & infrastructure security * Qualifications-Based Selection for engineering services * Research and Development Funding * Science, technology, engineering and math(STEM) education & support (K-12) * Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering * Transportation infrastructure The State advocacy priorities in 2018 are as follows: * Licensing * Natural Hazards Impact Mitigation * Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education & support (K-12) * State support for civil engineering higher education * Sustainability, implicitly sustainable engineering * Tort reform & indemnification for pro bono services * Transportation infrastructure financing =Strategic issues and initiatives= To promote the Society's objectives and address key issues facing the civil engineering profession, ASCE developed three strategic initiatives: Sustainable Infrastructure, the ASCE Grand Challenge, and Raise the Bar. =Policy statements= ASCE developed policy statements on major technical, professional and educational issues of interest to the civil engineering community and the nation in the following areas: * Coastal zones, off shore and waterways * Dams, flood control and levees * Disaster mitigation and response * Diversity * Education, inclusive of statements on history and heritage of civil engineering, STEM and academic prerequisites for licensure and professional practice laying out ASCE's Raise the Bar and Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge initiatives. * Energy * Engineering practice, inclusive of statements on civil engineering project team, engineering surveying, Aesthetics, Professional Ethics and Conflict of Interest, Combating Corruption * Environmental issues, inclusive of statements on acid rain, physical and economic impacts of climate change, pollution management, wetlands regulatory policy, support for the Endangered Species, harmful algal blooms, greenhouse gases and electronic waste recycling. * Government * Hazardous and solid waste * Infrastructure, inclusive of statements on ** Sustainable growth and development that integrates \\"... appropriate urban scale and form, diversity of land use and good engineering design to achieve a balance between the interests of the individual, the community and the natural and built environments.\\"L√©l√©, Sharachchandra M. \\"Sustainable development: a critical review.\\" World development 19.6 (1991): 607-621.

ASCE argues that policy makers should seek to maximize the rate of economic return on infrastructure investment. ASCE advocates for these decision-makers to follow established project and program management principles funded from a wide range of options and types of infrastructure debt such as dedicated user-fees, bonds, Public‚Äìprivate partnership, private investment, infrastructure banks such as the proposed National Infrastructure Reinvestment Bank, state and federal loan funds such as the Highway Trust Fund or State Revolving Funds. This effort had three sub-initiatives: *** Leadership in Infrastructure Renewal, ASCE makes the argument that the United States needs a \\"compelling and overarching vision\\" for infrastructure investment. This statement on infrastructure policy and related reports laid the conceptual framework for the ASCE Report Card for America's Infrastructure, related \\"Failure to Act\\" reports and State and Regional Infrastructure Report Cards and guiding principle recommendations for planning and executing critical infrastructure in the United States. *** Sustainability, Resiliency and Innovation, ASCE advocates that life-cycle cost analysis should be a part of every new or renewed infrastructure project with funding allocated to develop new and improved techniques in delivering projects, construction engineering and building materials for meeting society's infrastructure needs. This statement on infrastructure policy and related reports laid the conceptual framework for the ASCE Grand Challenge and related report on the recommended use of life-cycle cost analysis in transportation planning. *** Plans to Sustain and Enhance Infrastructure, ASCE makes the argument that infrastructure investment should be prioritized by program managers and executed by project managers; according to well-conceived management plans that are consistent with the \\"...national vision and focus on system wide metrics.\\" ** Regulatory process for infrastructure development, ASCE advocates for strategies that expedite regulatory processes and related decision-making for critical infrastructure projects to \\"proceed in a timely manner\\". Its recommendations in this area was for programs to require concurrent reviews by project stakeholders managing design codes (such as UBC and NEC)and other permitting such as wetlands dredge and fill for infrastructure projects. ASCE also recommended the creation of a \\"single administrative processing/permitting agency\\" for approving plans for constructing critical infrastructure as well as time-limits on permitting agency decision-making for approving infrastructure project plans. * International * Legal reform * Licensure * Procurement/contract issues * Public involvement * Quality/standards * Research * Space * Tax issues * Transportation issues * Wastewater * Water resources management Awards and designations ASCE Historical Marker at Philadelphia City Hall.

One award is present in each category of design, construction, government, education, and management. = Walter L. Huber Civil Engineering Research Prize = In July 1946, the Board of Direction authorized annual awards on recommendation by the Society's Committee on Research to stimulate research in civil engineering. In October 1964, Mrs. Alberta Reed Huber endowed these prizes in honor of her husband, Walter L. Huber, Past President, ASCE. The Huber Prize is considered the highest level mid-career research prize in civil engineering and is awarded for outstanding achievements and contributions in research with respect to all disciplines of civil engineering. LTPP International Data Analysis Contest Award The LTPP International Data Analysis Contest is an annual data analysis contest held by the ASCE in collaboration with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The participants are supposed to use the LTPP data. ASCE Foundation The ASCE Foundation is a charitable foundation established in 1994 to support and promote civil engineering programs that \\"... enhance quality of life, promote the profession, advance technical practices, and prepare civil engineers for tomorrow.\\" It is incorporated separately from the ASCE, although it has a close relationship to it and all the Foundation's personnel are employees of ASCE. The Foundation Board of Directors has seven persons and its bylaws require that four of the seven directors must be ASCE officers as well and the ASCE executive director and Chief financial officer must also be ASCE employees. The Foundation's support is most often to ASCE's charitable, educational and scientific programs. The Foundation's largest program is supporting three strategic areas; lifelong learning and leadership, advocacy for infrastructure investment and the role of civil engineers in sustainable practices. In 2014, this foundation's support in these areas was almost US$4 million.

On June 1, 2007, the ASCE issued its expert review panel report, and an accompanying press release. The press release was considered controversial because it contained information not present in the report, conflicting with the report, and minimized the Army Corps' involvement in the catastrophe: \\"Even without breaching, Hurricane Katrina's rainfall and surge overtopping would have caused extensive and severe flooding‚Äîand the worst loss of life and property loss ever experienced in New Orleans.\\" The report stated that had levees and pump stations not failed, \\"far less property loss would have occurred and nearly two-thirds of deaths could have been avoided.\\" The ASCE administration was criticized by the Times-Picayune for an attempt to minimize and understate the role of the Army Corps in the flooding.(June 19, 2007) EDITORIAL: Sound bites and spin jobs The Times-Picayune. Retrieved November 17, 2015. Ethics complaint In October 2007, Raymond Seed, a University of California-Berkeley civil engineering professor and ASCE member submitted a 42-page ethics complaint to the ASCE alleging that the Corps of Engineers with ASCE's help sought to minimize the Corps' mistakes in the flooding, intimidate anyone who tried to intervene, and delay the final results until the public's attention had turned elsewhere. The Corps acknowledged receiving a copy of the letter and refused to comment until the ASCE's Committee on Professional Conduct (CPC) had commented on the complaint. It took over a year for the ASCE to announce the results of the CPC. The ASCE self-study panel did not file charges of ethical misconduct and blamed errors on \\"staff\\" and not review panel members having created the June press release.\\" Review panels to examine alleged ethics breaches On November 14, 2007, ASCE announced that U.S. Congressman Sherwood Boehlert, R‚ÄëN.Y. (ret), would lead an independent task force of outside experts to review how ASCE participated in engineering studies of national significance.Task force will review engineers' studies The Times Picayune, December 8, 2007 ASCE President David Mongan said the review was to address criticism of ASCE¬¥s role in assisting the Army Corps of Engineers-sponsored investigation of Katrina failures. Mongan assured citizens of metro New Orleans in a letter to the Times Picayune, that ASCE took \\"this matter very seriously and that appropriate actions are being taken\\".ASCE is investigating The Times Picayune, December 2, 2007 The panel recommended in results released on September 12, 2008, that ASCE should immediately take steps to remove the potential for conflict of interest in its participation in post-disaster engineering studies. The most important recommendations were that peer review funds over $1 million should come from a separate source, like the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), that ASCE should facilitate but not control the assessment teams, and that information to the public and press should be disseminated not under the extremely tight controls that Ray Seed and his team experienced. It concluded that ASCE should draw up an ethics policy to eliminate questions of possible conflicts of interest. On April 6, 2009, an internal probe with the ASCE issued a report that ordered a retraction of the ASCE's June 1, 2007, press release. The panel determined that the press release had \\"inadvertently conveyed a misleading impression regarding the role of engineering failures in the devastation of New Orleans\\", that it incorrectly said that surge levels along Mississippi's coastline were higher than water levels caused by a tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, and that it had incorrectly repeated estimates of deaths and property damage in New Orleans that might have occurred if levees and floodwalls had not been breached.  Grassroots group spoof of ASCE - USACE relationship  On November 5, 2007, New Orleans-based grassroots group Levees.org led by Sandy Rosenthal criticized the ASCE's close relationship with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in a spoof online public service announcement. On November 12, 2007, the ASCE asked Levees.org to remove the video from the internet, threatening the organization with legal action if it did not comply. On November 13, the Times-Picayune posted the video on its website. Flanked by lawyers with Adams and Reese in the presence of extensive media coverage, the group ignored the threat and posted the video to YouTube citing Louisiana's Anti-SLAPP statute, a \\"strategic lawsuit against public participation\\", which allows courts to weed out lawsuits designed to chill public participation on matters of public significance. In a response for comment, ASCE President Mongan replied, \\"Since the video has already been widely reposted by other organizations, moving forward, we feel our time and expertise are best utilized working to help protect the residents of New Orleans from future storms and flooding.\\" USACE grant money for disinformation, 2008 In March 2008, Levees.org announced that records obtained under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that as early October 2005, the Army Corps of Engineers had directed and later paid the ASCE more than $1.1 million for its peer review (Grant Number: W912HZ-06-1-0001). The grant also paid for a series of misleading ASCE presentations attempting to shift blame away from the corps and onto local levee officials. Members of the ASCE are forbidden from making false or exaggerated statements and also from making statements for an interested party unless this is disclosed. Levees.org claimed the records showed how the external peer review would be done in four phases: Phase 1 was research and analysis on the performance of the levees, floodwalls and other important structures. Phase 2 was provision of information on the current system to prevent future flooding. Phase 3 was provision of information to evaluate alternative approaches to flood protection. Phase 4 was transfer information and knowledge gained to a broader audience within Corps and its consultancy community to communicate lessons learned. The group claimed that these records were proof that ASCE's routine powerpoint presentation from 2007 and 2008 were a public relations campaign to repair the corps' reputation. ASCE officials responded that ASCE paid for the powerpoint presentations itself and had not used USACE grant money for that purpose.

The corticospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of a lateral and anterior tract. The corticospinal tract is involved in voluntary movement. The majority of fibres of the corticospinal tract cross over in the medulla oblongata, resulting in muscles being controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract contains the axons of the pyramidal cells, the largest of which are the Betz cells, located in the cerebral cortex. The pyramidal tracts are named because they pass through the pyramids of the medulla oblongata. The corticospinal fibers when descending from the internal capsule to the brain stem, converge to a point from multiple directions giving the impression of an inverted pyramid. Involvement of the pyramidal tract at any level leads to pyramidal signs. The myelination of the pyramidal fibres is incomplete at birth and gradually progresses in cranio-caudal direction and thereby progressively gaining functionality. Most of the myelination is complete by two years of age and thereafter it progresses very slowly in cranio-caudal direction up to twelve years of age. Structure Pyramidal tracts The term pyramidal tracts refers to upper motor neurons that originate in the cerebral cortex and terminate in the spinal cord (corticospinal) or brainstem (corticobulbar). Nerves emerge in the cerebral cortex, pass down and may cross sides in the medulla oblongata, and travel as part of the spinal cord until they synapse with interneurons in the grey column of the spinal cord. There is some variation in terminology. The pyramidal tracts definitively encompass the corticospinal tracts, and many authors also include the corticobulbar tracts. =Corticospinal tract= Nerve fibres in the corticospinal tract originate from pyramidal cells in layer V of the cerebral cortex. Fibres arise from the primary motor cortex (about 30%), supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex (together also about 30%), and the somatosensory cortex, parietal lobe, and cingulate gyrus supplies the rest. The cells have their bodies in the cerebral cortex, and the axons form the bulk of the pyramidal tracts. The nerve axons travel from the cortex through the posterior limb of internal capsule, through the cerebral peduncle and into the brainstem and anterior medulla oblongata. Here they form two prominences called the medulla oblongatary pyramids. Below the prominences, the majority of axons cross over to the opposite side from which they originated, known as decussation. The axons that cross over move to the outer part of the medulla oblongata and form the lateral corticospinal tract, whereas the fibres that remain form the anterior corticospinal tract. About 80% of axons cross over and form the lateral corticospinal tract; 10% do not cross over and join the tract, and 10% of fibres travel in the anterior corticospinal tract. The nerve axons traveling down the tract are the efferent nerve fibers of the upper motor neurons. These axons travel down the tracts in the white matter of the spinal cord until they reach the vertebral level of the muscle that they will innervate. At this point, the axons synapse with lower motor neurons. The majority of axons do not directly synapse with lower motor neurons, but instead synapse with an interneuron that then synapses with a lower motor neuron. This generally occurs in the anterior grey column. Nerve axons of the lateral corticospinal tract that did not cross over in the medulla oblongata do so at the level of the spinal cord they terminate in. These tracts contain more than 1 million axons and the majority of the axons are myelinated. The corticospinal tracts myelinate largely during the first and second years after birth. The majority of nerve axons are small (<4Œºm) in diameter. About 3% of nerve axons have a much larger diameter (16Œºm) and arise from Betz cells, mostly in the leg area of the primary motor cortex. These cells are notable because of their rapid conduction rate, over 70m/sec, the fastest conduction of any signals from the brain to the spinal cord. Horizontal section through the lower part of the pons, showing the fibers of the corticospinal tract (#19) passing through the pontine nuclei =Corticobulbar tract= Fibres from the ventral motor cortex travel with the corticospinal tract through the internal capsule, but terminate in a number of locations in the midbrain (cortico-mesencephalic tract), pons (Corticopontine tract), and medulla oblongata (cortico-bulbar tract). The upper motor neurons of the corticobulbar tract synapse with interneurons or directly with the lower motor neurons located in the motor cranial nerve nuclei, namely oculomotor, trochlear, motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve, abducens, facial nerve and accessory and in the nucleus ambiguus to the hypoglossal, vagus and accessory nerves. These nuclei are supplied by nerves from both sides of the brain, with the exception of the parts of the facial nerve that control muscles of the lower face. These muscles are only innervated by nerves from the contralateral (opposite) side of the cortex. Function The nerves within the corticospinal tract are involved in movement of muscles of the body. Because of the crossing-over of fibres, muscles are supplied by the side of the brain opposite to that of the muscle. The nerves within the corticobulbar tract are involved in movement in muscles of the head. They are involved in swallowing, phonation, and movements of the tongue. By virtue of involvement with the facial nerve, the corticobulbar tract is also responsible for transmitting facial expression. With the exception of lower muscles of facial expression, all functions of the corticobulbar tract involve inputs from both sides of the brain. The extrapyramidal system refers to tracts within the spinal cord involved in involuntary movement but not part of the pyramidal tracts. Their functions include the control of posture and muscle tone. Clinical significance # Damage to the fibres of the corticospinal tracts, anywhere along their course from the cerebral cortex to the lower end of the spinal cord, can cause an upper motor neuron syndrome. # A few days after the injury to the upper motor neurons, a pattern of motor signs and symptoms appears, including spasticity, hyperactive reflexes, a loss of the ability to perform fine movements, and an extensor plantar response known as the Babinski sign. # Symptoms generally occur alongside other sensory problems. # Causes may include disorders such as strokes, cerebral palsy, subdural hemorrhage, abscesses and tumours, neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple system atrophy, inflammation such as meningitis and multiple sclerosis, and trauma to the spinal cord, including from slipped discs. # If the corticobulbar tract is damaged on only one side, then only the lower face will be affected, however if there is involvement of both the left and right tracts, then the result is pseudobulbar palsy. This causes problems with swallowing, speaking, and emotional lability. # Severe disabling involuntary movements such as hemiballismus or severe chorea might exhaust the patient and become a life threatening situation. # In the past, this condition was treated by partial section of the pyramidal tract either at the primary motor cortex or at the cruz cerebri (pedunculotomy).

A key Ohio Republican political insider, he is best remembered for his service as Attorney General of the United States under Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, as well as for his involvement in the Teapot Dome scandal during Harding's presidency. Despite his status as a key political leader of the Ohio Republican Party from the 1880s through the first decade of the 20th century, Daugherty was himself only briefly a statewide elected politician, serving just two terms in the Ohio General Assembly, working closely during the last two years with Governor William McKinley. Although he sought national office several times, Daugherty was thwarted in his effort to obtain the nomination of his party and was never elected to office again. Daugherty remained an influential figure behind the election of several Congressmen and U.S. Senators. In 1920 he was Harding's campaign manager at the Republican National Convention. Following Harding's successful election Daugherty was named Attorney General. In this capacity, he was instrumental in winning presidential pardons for jailed anti-war dissidents such as Eugene V. Debs. Twice the subject of federal corruption investigations, in 1924 Daugherty was forced to resign his post as Attorney General by the late Harding's presidential successor, Calvin Coolidge. Biography =Early years= Harry M. Daugherty was born January 26, 1860 in the small town of Washington Court House, Ohio. Daugherty's father, John H. Daugherty, was the Pennsylvania-born son of Irish immigrants and worked as a farmer and tailor.James N. Giglio, H.M. Daughterty and the Politics of Expediency. Kent, OH: Kent State University Press, 1978; pg. 2. His mother, Jane Draper Daugherty, was from a prominent Ohio family with Virginia roots dating back to the time of the American Revolution. Daugherty was a first cousin of actress Majel Coleman.Shadow of Blooming Grove, Francis Russell, McGraw Hill, 1968 Daugherty's father died of diphtheria when Harry was just four years old, as did one of his brothers, leaving his mother as the sole provider for the household.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 3. Harry and his older brother, Mally, were forced by economic necessity to take a variety of jobs from a relatively early age to help with the family's living expenses. Daugherty's mother later recalled that he was so young when he worked in a local grocery store that he had to stand on a wooden crate to reach the cash register. Daugherty's mother wanted him to become a Methodist minister, but the prospect of life as a clergyman held no appeal for him. Instead, after graduating from high school in Washington Court House, Daugherty studied medicine for a year before taking a position as a cub reporter for The Cincinnati Enquirer. In 1878 Daugherty entered the University of Michigan Law School, accepted there despite not having first obtained an undergraduate education. He supplemented his insufficient income by gambling, winning a significant sum betting on the election of James Garfield in the 1880 presidential election. Sports betting was also an area of some interest to Daugherty and his brother, who went so far as to tap telegraph wires so that they could obtain game information in advance.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 3-4. Initially successful, this ethically shady activity was ultimately discovered and exposed by local gamblers puzzled by the brothers' uncanny success. Daugherty graduated from law school in 1881 and returned home to Ohio, where he accepted a job in the office of a Washington Court House attorney, spending his spare time preparing to take the Ohio state bar examination.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 4. =Factional soldier= Gov. Joseph B. Foraker, with whom Daugherty was politically allied as a young man, as he appeared in 1902. In 1882 Daugherty was elected by the Fayette County Republican Central Committee as the recording secretary of the organization. He ran for political office in the election of 1882, winning election as the clerk of nearby Union Township. In this capacity Daugherty served a single two-year term, earning a salary of $1500 per year. The following year Daugherty was elected secretary of the Fayette County Executive Committee, where he earned a reputation as an intense and astute young political activist. He was selected as one of five delegates from the Fayette Country Republican Party as a delegate to the Ohio State Republican Convention in 1883, held in Columbus. There Daugherty helped select an aggressive young Cincinnati judge named Joseph B. Foraker as the party's 1883 gubernatorial nominee.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 5. A close political relationship developed between Foraker and Daugherty, with Daugherty exerting himself in support of Foraker's unsuccessful 1883 campaign. When Foraker was elected as Governor of Ohio in 1885, he was able to return the favor, boosting his prot√©g√© Daugherty's career. The connection between the two was tightened further in September 1884, when Daugherty married Lucille Walker of Wellston, Ohio ‚Äì a cousin of Foraker's wife. Daugherty was elected to a two-year term on the city council in the election of 1885, serving from 1886 to 1887.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 6. He was elected as chairman of the Fayette County Republican Central Committee in 1886 but spent most of his time helping to establish a law practice. After practicing alone for three years, Daugherty formed a partnership with Horatio B. Maynard, a prominent local lawyer, and the new practice soon emerged as a leading law firm in the county. In 1889 Republican David Worthington decided not to seek reelection to the Ohio General Assembly and Daugherty threw his hat into the ring. After eking out a narrow victory in the Republican primary election, Daugherty emerged victorious in November, winning election to the Ohio House of Representatives by slightly more than 800 votes out of 5,100 ballots cast. Although Daugherty won his race, his close political ally Joseph Foraker lost his bid for a third term as Governor and the Democratic Party won control of the Assembly as well, forcing Daugherty to participate as a member of the minority party. Daugherty won reelection to the Ohio House of Representatives in the fall of 1891, beating his Democratic opponent by more than 750 votes out of about 4,900 cast.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 10. This time Ohio Republicans recaptured not only the Governor's mansion ‚Äì electing William McKinley to the state's chief executive office ‚Äì but also the majority of the state assembly. Since in this era United States Senators were elected by state legislatures rather than by direct vote of the people, this meant that a Republican would be sent to Washington, DC to fill the expiring term of Senator John Sherman when the assembly reconvened in January 1892. =Change of alliances= Mark Hanna, a key leader of the Sherman faction of the Ohio Republican Party, as he appeared in 1896. The Ohio Republican Party had for several years been deeply split along factional lines, with Senator Sherman and former Governor Foraker leading rival groups of party activists and political functionaries. Foraker was determined to challenge Sherman for his Senate seat and sought assurances from Daugherty that he would continue to support him when the matter came before the legislature. This placed Daugherty in a difficult position, since his native Fayette County was solidly behind the Sherman faction, which included Governor McKinley and the significant financial clout of Cleveland businessman Mark Hanna.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 8-10. Forced by the logic of the situation to switch alliances rather than risk being cast into political oblivion, Daugherty abandoned Foraker in the final contest of the Ohio Republican caucus on January 2, 1892, joining 52 others in voting for Sherman, against 38 for the insurgent campaign of Foraker.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 11. In the aftermath of the caucus that would determine Ohio's U.S. Senator, editorials of the Democratic Columbus Post charged that Daugherty and fourteen other Ohio legislators had changed their support from Foraker to Sherman based upon \\"intimidation, threats, promises, and actual purchase\\" and accused Daugherty by name of having accepted cash payments. A formal investigation of this charge by a bi-partisan four member committee of the Ohio State Senate followed, with Daugherty being unanimously cleared of all charges in a report issued in April 1892.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 12. The 1892 Senatorial campaign marked the formal attachment of Daugherty to the dominant Sherman-Hanna faction of the Ohio Republican Party after the better part of a decade as a trusted adherent of the rival Foraker faction.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 13. The move broadened Daugherty's political possibilities, and he was made chairman of the powerful Corporations Committee and named a member of the Judiciary Committee. In 1893 Daugherty was chosen as chairman of the Ohio Republican State Convention which nominated McKinley as the party's candidate for Governor.\\"Harry M. Daugherty,\\" in Joseph Patterson Smith (ed.), History of the Republican Party of Ohio: Volume 2. Chicago: Lewis Publishing Co., 1898; pp. 411-412. Governor McKinley also named Daugherty as his floor leader in the House of Representatives, keeping party members in line behind the governor's legislative agenda. Over the next two years McKinley and Daugherty forged a close political friendship, working together closely and frequently sharing meals at breakfast and in the evening. With the Foraker faction, however, Daugherty became persona non grata due to what was perceived as his duplicitous political disloyalty. Daugherty attempted to gain nomination as a Republican candidate for Congress in 1892, but the 7th District Republican Convention which put forward the party's nominee was irreconcilably split between Daugherty and his former law partner, A.R. Creamer, and wound up backing a dark horse candidate as a compromise, George W. Wilson.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 14-15. Wilson won his race in the November 1892 general election and wound up serving four years in Congress on behalf of the 7th District. In the aftermath of his failure to win a seat in Congress, Sherman offered Daugherty a political appointment as Assistant District Attorney in Columbus.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 15. Daugherty ultimately decided to decline this position, instead opening a new law office in that city, while still remaining a resident and practicing attorney in his hometown of Washington Court House. =The Washington Court House riot= Ohio Historical Marker at the Fayette County Courthouse in Washington Court House, Ohio On October 9, 1894, a black man named William Dolby was accused of assaulting a white woman named Mary C. Boyd in her home at Parrett's Station, a small settlement near Washington Court House.Howard Burba, \\"A Wild Night at Washington C.H.,\\" Dayton Daily News, June 26, 1932. Dolby fled but was soon arrested and taken back to the jail at Washington Court House, where signs quickly pointed to an outburst of mob violence.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 16. Dolby supposedly confessed to the crime \\"upon being apprehended\\". The Fayette County sheriff called upon Governor McKinley to send out the militia to defend the prisoner from a prospective lynch mob following his sentencing to twenty years in prison at a hearing held on October 16. On October 17 two companies of militiamen arrived at Washington Court House to guard Dolby for his coming transport to the Ohio Penitentiary at Columbus. That evening a mob gathered and began a siege of the jail, attempting to batter down the jailhouse doors so that the prisoner could be removed and violently killed. Commander of the National Guard forces, Colonel Alonzo Coit, ordered his troops to fire upon the enraged lynch mob, which they did, killing five rioters and wounding fifteen others. The mob still failed to disperse and fears grew that an armed assault would be launched by furious local citizens on the militiamen defending the jail. Around 2 am a second volley was fired by the defenders, this time over the heads of the rioters, with the gunfire finally having its desired effect of breaking up the unlawful gathering. In the aftermath Governor McKinley appointed a special court of inquiry to investigate the riot and militia shooting. Following an investigation, the court of inquiry returned an indictment against Col. Coit, charging him with manslaughter in the incident. McKinley then called upon Daugherty to shoulder the politically unpopular job of defending Coit at trial, in the face of a wrathful Fayette County citizenry which sought his conviction. Daugherty accepted the Coit case, and on March 5, 1895, won his acquittal of manslaughter charges. =From politician to political operator= Theodore E. Burton, a Congressman and Senator, was a key Daugherty ally during the first decade of the 20th Century. Although Daugherty sought nomination by the Ohio Republican Party for Governor in 1895, Hanna decided to support another candidate instead, so Daugherty decided to launch a run for Ohio Attorney General instead.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 16-17. The Ohio Republican Convention was dominated by the Foraker faction, however, and Foraker loyalist Frank S. Monnett was nominated for the Attorney General post over the deeply distrusted Daugherty.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 17. Not daunted by his loss, in 1896 Daugherty announced his desire to win election to Congress. An advisory primary election was held among Fayette County Republicans in March 1896, in which Daugherty narrowly won a bitterly fought race.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 18. The actual nomination was to be made by the 7th District Republican Convention, however, and there Daugherty fell victim to factional machinations, with the nomination going instead to Walter L. Weaver, who would ultimately serve two terms in Congress.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 18-19. For a second time Daugherty had been denied. The Republican National Committee recognized Daugherty's gifts as an indefatigable partisan and effective stump speaker, however, and sent him out on the road in support of McKinley's campaign for President of the United States in 1896. Daugherty traveled through Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and Ohio, logging over 9,000 miles traveled in delivering some 47 campaign speeches in support of McKinley and the Republicans' successful effort. In 1898 conflict emerged between Daugherty and Hanna over the slow payment of thousands of dollars of legal fees incurred by then-U.S. Senator Hanna in defending himself against a Senate investigation of electoral bribery charges.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pp. 19-21. While Daugherty's insistence upon being paid had made for a tense relationship, the actual parting of their ways came in 1899, when Daugherty again sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Ohio.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 21. Neither Foraker nor Hanna supported Daugherty for the position, with Hanna lending his support to George K. Nash and Foraker clearly still seething over Daugherty's 1892 abandonment. Daugherty took his fight all the way to the Ohio Republican Convention before losing to Nash, 461 delegate votes to 205.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 23. Over the next five years Daugherty skillfully built political influence in the Ohio Republican establishment by dealing with leaders of both of the party's major factions.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 26. Daugherty maintained considerable influence with Republicans in the state legislature, who had known and worked with Daugherty for years.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 27. His political rehabilitation was only partial, however, for as long as Foraker and Hanna remained the top factional leaders of Ohio Republican politics there remained a very real ceiling beyond which Daugherty could never hope to rise.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 28. Hanna's death in February 1904 and a subsequent discrediting of some of his top allies such as George B. Cox on grounds of political bossism again cleared the way for Daugherty's emergence. By 1906 Daugherty stood as a leader of a new insurgent political faction which included Congressman Theodore E. Burton of Cleveland and former Governor Myron T. Herrick. Daugherty and Burton aligned themselves with supporters of William Howard Taft, Secretary of War under progressive Republican President Theodore Roosevelt, and together the factional allies forced Foraker out of the United States Senate and into political retirement, aided by muckraking news reports that Foraker had received nearly $30,000 as a political retainer from the Standard Oil Trust.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 34. Daugherty was instrumental in helping his ally Burton win election to the Senate in 1908 but was once again relegated to a key backstage role instead of himself standing for election to high office.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 35. Daugherty's position as a political boss rather than a public politician had once again been confirmed. During the party split of 1912, Daugherty was a staunch supporter of Taft and old guard Republican conservatism against the progressive Republicanism espoused by Roosevelt.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 55. Daugherty was a key figure on the ground in Ohio in behalf of the Taft campaign, issuing a major address on May 18 which was so well regarded that it was reproduced as a pamphlet by the Taft organization.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 58. Although Daugherty's machinations along with Cuyahoga County boss Maurice Maschke carried the state Republican convention for Taft, a split of the Republican field in the November election propelled Democrat Woodrow Wilson to the presidency with a plurality of under 42% of the vote. =The Harding campaign= U.S. Senator Warren Harding, circa 1918. The establishment of primary elections for the U.S. Senate in 1914 greatly reduced the power of political bosses such as Daugherty. He remained fully engaged as a political operative in spite of this major change, however, attaching himself to a powerful state senator named Warren G. Harding. Daugherty had known Harding since the autumn of 1899, when he had been prominent in Ohio politics and Harding was a 35-year-old upstart.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 82. It would not be too many years before these roles were reversed, however, with Harding elected to the state senate in 1901 and appointed Republican floor leader in that same session. Harding was an eloquent speaker and a skilled negotiator of political compromise and emerged as one of the top leaders of the Foraker faction. During the 1912 party split, Daugherty and Harding forged a political friendship working on behalf of the Taft campaign, with Daugherty filling the role of Ohio Republican Party chairman with Harding's newspaper, the Marion Daily Star, giving Daugherty its full support.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 83. Both were politically ambitious and while they enjoyed one another's company, they were not intimate personal friends. Harding managed to win election to the Senate in 1914. Daugherty ran for the Republican Senate nomination in 1916, campaigning against former Senator Charles W.F. Dick and former Governor Herrick. Herrick won the nomination, and lost the general election to Atlee Pomerene.Dodd, Mead and Company, New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress, 1917, page 503 Ever the political manipulator, in January 1918 Daugherty observed the significance of the growing temperance movement and opportunistically attempted to become a movement leader in the state.Giglio, H.M. Daugherty and the Politics of Expediency, pg. 84. Daugherty was himself a drinker but was not a man to let personal habits stand in the way of political possibility. As an Ohio Republican boss in 1920, Daugherty engineered Harding's ascendancy as the presidential nominee at that year's Republican National Convention in Chicago. The decision to propel Harding forward, if the nomination wasn't decided on the first ballot, was made in what became known in American politics as the smoke-filled room in the Blackstone Hotel. Harding won the nomination after the vote deadlocked between Leonard Wood and Frank Lowden, an event whose possibility Daugherty had suggested months before in an interview. Daugherty subsequently served as campaign manager for Harding in the presidential election of 1920. He ran the campaign based on Harding's affable personality and fairly neutral political stance, advocating a return to \\"normalcy\\" after World War I. =Attorney General of the United States= Following the resounding Republican victory in the fall of 1920, Daugherty was named Attorney General of the United States by President-elect Harding. Daugherty was confirmed by the Senate and assumed office on March 4, 1921.Mark Grossman, \\"Harry Micajah Daugherty (1860-1941),\\" in Political Corruption in America: An Encyclopedia of Scandals, Power, and Greed. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2003; pp. 91-93. =The \\"Ohio Gang\\"= Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty in his office. Having achieved power, Harding gathered around him a group of political cronies, including factional friends from the Ohio Republican establishment like Daugherty and others of like mind from other states, a group known colloquially as the \\"Ohio Gang.\\" Critics such as Harding's Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover viewed the clique with thinly disguised disgust: > [Harding] had another side which was not good. His political associates had > been men of the type of Albert B. Fall, whom he appointed Secretary of the > Interior; Daugherty, whom he appointed Attorney General; Forbes, whom he > appointed Director of the Veterans' Bureau; Thomas W.

New York: Macmillan, > 1952; pg. 48 Several of Harding's Ohio Gang associates lost no time enriching themselves at the public expense. Soon rumblings began to be heard over possible malfeasance in various government departments, including Daugherty's Department of Justice. C. H. Sykes Then on April 14, 1922, The Wall Street Journal broke a sensational story about a secret bribery scheme involving oil company kickbacks to government officials in exchange for the granting of extraordinarily favorable oil extraction leases via single-bid contracts.\\"Senate Investigates the 'Teapot Dome' Scandal,\\" United States Senate Historical Minutes, www.senate.gov/ The next day Democratic Senator John B. Kendrick of Wyoming introduced a resolution which set in motion the Senate investigation that would ultimately expose this so-called Teapot Dome scandal, involving an illegal financial relationship between Fall, Harding's Secretary of the Interior, and a subsidiary of the Sinclair Consolidated Oil Corporation. Daugherty was accused by opponents of the administration of having been complicit in the Teapot Dome affair by failing to intervene after he had learned of the malfeasance. A pair of special prosecutors ‚Äì Republican Assistant Attorney General Owen J. Roberts and former Democratic Senator Atlee Pomerene ‚Äì were appointed to conduct a more thorough investigation of the matter. After taking testimony on the matter the pair cleared Daugherty of wrongdoing, their final report indicating that the Attorney General had neither been aware of the fraudulent oil contracts nor had he taken any bribes related to the affair. This very specific absolution did not mean that all was on the level at the Justice Department, however. In July 1923, just as Harding was preparing to leave on a working cruise to Alaska, Daugherty's personal assistant, Jess Smith, suddenly committed suicide.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pp. 48-49. Although as a pious Quaker, Hoover was never part of the President's inner circle, yet was abruptly added to the traveling party on the cruise by a \\"nervous and distraught\\" Harding, who apparently sought his counsel.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 49. Hoover later recalled: > One day after lunch when we were a few days out, Harding asked me to come to > his cabin. He plumped at me the question: \\"If you knew of a great scandal in > our administration, would you for the good of the country and the party > expose it publicly or would you bury it?\\" My natural reply was \\"Publish it, > and at least get credit for integrity on your side.\\" He remarked that this > method might be politically dangerous. I asked for more particulars. He said > that he had received some rumors of irregularities, centering around Smith, > in connection with cases in the Department of Justice. He had followed the > matter up and finally sent for Smith. After a painful session he told Smith > that he would be arrested in the morning.

I asked what Daugherty's relations to the affair were. > He abruptly dried up and never raised the question again. Returning from his Alaskan trip Harding suffered the first heart attack in what would prove to be the beginning of his terminal last days, finally dying in San Francisco on August 2, 1923. Harding's death did nothing to quell the tide of emerging scandals revolving around his Ohio clique, with the news dominated by the story of Teapot Dome bribery and allegations of wrongdoing in the Office of the Alien Property Custodian, the Veterans' Bureau, and the Office of the Attorney General.Hoover, The Memoirs of Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 53. While new President Calvin Coolidge initially resisted calls to sack Daugherty, Hoover and Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes prevailed upon him to eliminate a man whom they considered to be a corrupt official. In his memoirs Hoover remembered: > Coolidge was loath to believe that such things were possible. He greatly > delayed the removal of Daugherty from the Cabinet. From this man's long-time > character, he should never have been in any government.... Coolidge had a > high sense of justice and asserted that he had no definite knowledge of > wrongdoings by Daugherty and could not remove him on rumors. We urged that > Daugherty had lost the confidence of the whole country and himself should be > willing to retire for the good of public service.Hoover, The Memoirs of > Herbert Hoover: The Cabinet and the Presidency, 1920-1933, pg. 54. On March 28, 1924, Coolidge acquiesced, demanding and receiving a letter of resignation from Daugherty. He was quickly replaced as Attorney General by Harlan Fiske Stone, dean of the Columbia Law School. =American Metal Company affair= In 1926, Daugherty was indicted on charges that he improperly received funds in the sale of American Metal Company assets seized during World War I. The indictment came down one year after Smith, Republican political boss John T. King of Connecticut, and former Alien Property Custodian Thomas W. Miller were charged with the same misconduct. Daugherty's case went to trial twice, with the first jury deadlocking with 7-5 in favor of conviction. He was acquitted after a single juror remained unconvinced of his guilt in the second trial. =Later years, death, and legacy= Daugherty returned to practicing law until his retirement in 1932, and that year published, with ghostwriter Thomas Dixon, The Inside Story of the Harding Tragedy about his time in the Harding administration. In the book he claimed that Fall had become Secretary of the Interior by forging Daugherty's signature, and that Smith, his close friend, had killed himself because of diabetes, not a guilty conscience. Spending many of his final years in Florida and Mackinac Island, Michigan, Daugherty planned to write more books to clear his reputation, but in October 1940, he suffered two heart attacks and was stricken with pneumonia. Bedridden and blind in one eye during this last year, he died peacefully in his sleep with his son and daughter at his side on October 12, 1941. Daugherty was buried at Washington Cemetery in Washington Court House, Ohio.Marker #2-24 Harry M. Daugherty , Ohio Historical Society, 2003. Accessed 2013-05-22.

Built in 1886, it was the home of Manningham Rugby Football Club until 1903, when they changed code from rugby football to association football and became Bradford City. It has been Bradford City's home since, although it is now owned by former chairman Gordon Gibb's pension fund. It has also been home to Bradford (Park Avenue) for one season, and Bradford Bulls rugby league side for two seasons, as well as host to a number of England youth team fixtures. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to redevelop the ground when Bradford City were promoted to the First Division in 1908. The stadium underwent few changes until the fatal fire on 11 May 1985, when 56 supporters were killed and at least 265 were injured. It underwent a ¬£2.6 million redevelopment and was re-opened in December 1986. The ground underwent significant changes in the 1990s, and early 2000s, and now has a capacity of 25,136. The record attendance of 39,146 was set in 1911 for an FA Cup tie against Burnley, making it the oldest surviving attendance record at a Football League ground in the country. The highest attendance at Valley Parade, as it is now, was against Reading in the 2015 FA Cup Quarter-finals. History Manningham Rugby Football Club, formed in 1876, originally played games at Cardigan Fields, in the Carlisle Road area of Bradford. When their ground was sold to facilitate the construction of Drummond School, the club required a new home. Consequently, they bought one-third of the Valley Parade site in Manningham, taking a short-term lease out on the rest of the land in time to play there for the 1886‚Äì87 season. The new ground and the road it was built upon both adopted the name of the local area, Valley Parade, a name deriving from the steep hillside below Manningham. The land was previously a quarry, and formed part of a greater site owned by Midland Railway Company. The club spent ¬£1,400 appointing designers to oversee the excavation and levelling of the land, and moved a one-year-old stand from Carlisle Road to the highest part of the new ground. The original ground comprised the relocated stand, a 2,000-capacity stepped enclosure with the players' changing rooms beneath the stand, the playing area, a cinder athletics track and fencing to limit the total capacity to 18,000. The playing field was made of ballast, ashes, soil and sods. The ground was officially opened on 27 September 1886 for a game against Wakefield Trinity which was watched by a capacity crowd, but construction work meant most of Manningham's early games were away fixtures. On Christmas Day 1888, 12-year old Thomas Coyle was killed at the ground when the barrier under which he was sitting collapsed on him breaking his neck. An inquest decided the death was accidental and the accident happened due to the weight of spectators leaning on the barrier. The takings from the game totalling ¬£115 were distributed to Coyle's family and the families of other boys injured in the incident. The ground's current main stand Manningham RFC continued playing until 1903, when financial difficulties, caused by relegation at the turn of the century, prompted club officials to change codes from rugby football to association football. The first association football game to be played at Valley Parade was a promotional fixture on 6 April 1903 between a side of West Yorkshire footballers and Sheffield United's 1903 FA Cup winning side. The game had been organised to stimulate interest in the sport in Bradford and attracted 8,000 fans. The new football club, Bradford City, were elected to The Football League's Division Two the following month. Bradford City's first game at Valley Parade came on 5 September 1903 against Gainsborough Trinity, drawing a crowd of 11,000. As a result of alterations first implemented in 1897, City players originally changed in a shed behind one end of the ground, and visiting teams used the old rugby club dressing rooms at the back of the nearby Belle Vue Hotel. However, after City's 5‚Äì1 defeat by Manchester United on 10 February 1906, United player Bob Bonthron was attacked as he left the ground. As a result, The Football Association closed the ground for 14 days, ordering City to switch its changing rooms to the nearby Artillery Barracks for the 1906‚Äì07 season. Several supporters faced criminal proceedings for the incident. The concrete Midland Road stand for Bradford City Football Club nearing completion in 1908.\\"Reinforced Concrete Football Stand at Bradford\\", Concrete and Constructional Engineering, Vol. V., No. 1, January 1910, pp. 16-22. After Bradford City won the Division Two championship in 1907‚Äì08, the club hurried through a reconstruction programme of the ground to prepare for the club's first season in Division One. Football architect Archibald Leitch was commissioned to design new terracing in the paddock‚Äîa standing area in front of the 5,300-seater main stand which was built in 1908‚Äîand build a Spion Kop at the north side of the ground and an 8,000-capacity stand at the Midland Road end opposite the main stand. Further work was performed to lower the railings, erect barriers, move the pitch and add extra turnstiles. The changing rooms were also moved, with a tunnel leading from the rooms underneath the Kop along the main stand side of the ground. The total project cost ¬£9,958, and raised the capacity to 40,000. The work was not completed until midway through the 1908‚Äì09 season. The first match after work was finished took place on Christmas Day 1908, when 36,000 fans saw City host Bristol City. The improvements allowed Bradford City to set their record attendance of 39,146 on 11 March 1911 against Burnley during the club's FA Cup winning run. It is the longest surviving attendance record at any league ground in the country. The Midland Road stand On 17 March 1932, Bradford City paid Midland Railway Company ¬£3,750 for the remaining two-thirds of the site to become outright owners of the ground, which was now 45 years old. The stadium had remained virtually unchanged since 1908, and did so until 1952, when the capacity of the ground was reduced after examinations of the foundations were ordered following the 1946 Burnden Park disaster. The investigation resulted in the closure of half the Midland Road stand. The stand's steel frame was then sold to Berwick Rangers for ¬£450 and a smaller replacement stand was built at Valley Parade in 1954. Six years later, the stand had to be demolished for a second time because of continuing foundation problems. It was another six years before all four stands at Valley Parade were able to be opened for the first time. To enable construction of a new stand on the Midland Road side of the ground, the club directors moved the pitch closer to the main stand. The new stand was then the narrowest stand in the league. Further improvements were made to the stand in 1969, ready for the club's FA Cup tie with Division One side Tottenham Hotspur on 3 January 1970, which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw in front of 23,000 fans. The cost of the work forced the club to sell Valley Parade to Bradford Corporation for ¬£35,000, but it was bought back by 1979 for the same price. During the period from 1908 to 1985, the club carried out a number of other lesser work to the rest of the ground. It also included the introduction of floodlights in English football. Valley Parade's first floodlights cost ¬£3,000 and were lamps mounted on telegraph poles running along each side of the ground. They were originally used against Hull City on 20 December 1954. The floodlights were replaced in 1960 and again used for the first time against Hull City, but when one fell over in 1962, an FA Cup game with Gateshead had to go ahead with only three pylons, prompting an FA inquiry. In 1985, football ground writer Simon Inglis described the view from the main stand, which was still the same as when it was developed in 1908, as \\"like watching football from the cockpit of a Sopwith Camel\\" because of its antiquated supports and struts. fire, but before further work at the end of that decade On 11 May 1985, one of the worst sporting disasters occurred at Valley Parade, 56 people died and at least 265 were injured when the main stand was engulfed by fire. The fire started 40 minutes into the club's final game of the 1984‚Äì85 season against Lincoln City and destroyed the main stand in just nine minutes. For the next season and the first five months of the 1986‚Äì87 season, Bradford City played home games at Leeds United's Elland Road, Huddersfield Town's Leeds Road and Bradford Northern's Odsal Stadium, while Valley Parade was rebuilt. Huddersfield-based firm J Wimpenny carried out the ¬£2.6 million work, which included funding from insurance pay- outs, Football League stadium grants, club funds and a ¬£1.46 million Government loan obtained by two Bradford MPs, Geoffrey Lawler and Max Madden. A new 5,000 all-seater main stand was built, longer than the structure which had burned down. The Kop was also covered for the first time and increased to a 7,000 capacity. Other minor work was carried out to the ground's other two stands. On 14 December 1986, 582 days after the fire, The Hon Sir Oliver Popplewell, who had conducted the inquiry into the fire, opened the new stadium before an exhibition match against an England international XI. It was first used for a league game on Boxing Day when City lost 1‚Äì0 to Derby County. A view of the main stand from the Bradford end of the ground The two stands which were not altered after the fire were both improved during the 1990s. The Bradford end of the ground was made a double-decker, all-seater stand, with a new scoreboard, in 1991. City's promotion to Division One in 1996 meant that chairman Geoffrey Richmond announced the construction of a 4,500 seater stand on the Midland Road side. It was first used for a Yorkshire derby against Sheffield United on Boxing Day 1996, before being officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 March 1997. Richmond continued his plans to redevelop the ground as City continued to rise through the league. The roof of the Kop, which was the largest safe-standing terrace in the country at the time, was removed and the capacity reduced during City's 1998‚Äì99 promotion season, to prepare for a summer ¬£6.5 million rebuilding programme. The Kop was converted into a two-tier 7,500-seat capacity stand. An additional 2,300-seat capacity corner section was built, which filled in the corner between the main stand and Kop. When opened in December 2000 it took the capacity of Valley Parade to more than 20,000 for the first time since 1970. A suite of offices and a shop were added at the same time. Once the work was completed, a second tier was added to the main stand at the cost of ¬£6.5 million. It was opened in 2001, increasing the main stand's capacity to 11,000, and the ground's capacity to 25,000. Richmond also planned to increase the main stand's capacity by a further 1,800 seats by building new changing rooms and office blocks, and add a second tier to the Midland Road stand, to increase the ground capacity to more than 35,000. However, the club went into administration in May 2002, and Richmond was replaced by new co-owners Julian Rhodes and Gordon Gibb. The following year, Valley Parade was sold to Gibb's pension fund for ¬£5 million, with the club's offices, shop and car park sold to London-based Development Securities for an additional ¬£2.5 million. Bradford City's annual rent bill in 2011 to Gibb's pension fund is ¬£370,000. The total budget for the year, including other rent payments, rates, maintenance and utility bills is ¬£1.25 million. The ground has been renamed a number of times for sponsorship reasons. Sponsors have included The Pulse radio station, Bradford & Bingley, Intersonic and Coral Windows. The ground was renamed due to sponsorship as the Northern Commercials Stadium in July 2016 but was still commonly known throughout football as Valley Parade. In July 2019 it was re-sponsored and renamed the Utilita Energy Stadium. Structure and facilities The Kop, formerly known as the Carlsberg stand The stadium is divided into five all- seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for a small part of the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two- tiered. Most of the stands are cantilever structures, and because of the ground's location on the hillside, the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road. Many of the stands have more traditional names, but have since been renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but is also known as the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road on that side of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre. The total capacity of Valley Parade is 25,136. The largest stand is the JCT600 Stand, which holds 9,004 supporters, followed by the Kop, which has a capacity of 7,492. The Midland Road Stand holds 4,500, and the North West Corner 2,300. The TL Dallas Stand is the smallest of the five stands with a capacity of 1,840. The stadium includes 134 seats for media representatives. The Sunwin Stand has further room for expansion, and is unusual because it only runs three-quarters of the length of the pitch. The rest of this side is taken up by a brick building, situated in the south west corner of the stadium, which houses the club changing rooms and the security offices. The Sunwin Stand also includes the ground's 17 executive boxes and conference facilities, which have capacity for up to 700 people. A second function room, called the Bantams Bar, in the Kop, has room for another 300 people. There is also more office space, a club store, ticket office and museum in the car park behind the Kop. From early 2010, the area near the store will also include a dental surgery, which will be run by NHS Bradford and Airedale in partnership with the football club. Visiting team fans sat in the TL Dallas Stand from 1995 to 2008, but have also been given other parts of the ground for larger matches. In March 2008, the club announced that the TL Dallas Stand would be made available for home fans for the 2008‚Äì09 season. The decision came after an overwhelmingly positive text message poll from the club's supporters to use the Bradford End of the ground. Visiting team fans have been accommodated in the end blocks of the East Stand since the start of the 2008‚Äì09 season. Fire disaster A memorial, erected on the club's main stand, to the victims of the fire in 1985 A memorial in Bradford city centre On 11 May 1985, a crowd of 11,076 attended Bradford City's final Division Three game of the 1984‚Äì85 season against Lincoln City. The Bradford side had secured the Division Three title the week before when they defeated Bolton Wanderers 2‚Äì0. The league trophy was presented to City's skipper Peter Jackson before the Lincoln game. The score was still 0‚Äì0 after 40 minutes of the game, when a small fire was noticed three rows from the back near one end of the main stand. The flames became more visible within minutes, and police started to evacuate people in the stand less than six minutes later. Club chairman Stafford Heginbotham, who was in the main stand, described the effect and his reaction to the disaster: \\"The fire just spread along the length of the stand in seconds. The smoke was choking. We couldn't breathe. It was to be our day.\\" The game was stopped, and the wooden roof caught fire. The fire spread the length of the stand, and timber and the roof began to fall onto the crowds. Black smoke enveloped the rear passageways, where fans were trying to escape. Ultimately, the fire killed 56 spectators, ranging from 11-year-old children to the 86-year-old former chairman of the club, Sam Firth. At least 265 further supporters were injured. The few existing narrow escape routes led to locked doors in some cases, and the only escape for most spectators was directly onto the field. The match was abandoned and never replayed, with The Football League ordering the scoreline at the time of abandonment to stand. Sir Oliver Popplewell published his inquiry into the fire in 1986, which introduced new safety legislation for sports grounds across the country. Forensic scientist David Woolley believed the cause of the fire was from a discarded cigarette or match, which had dropped through gaps between the seating to a void below the stand where rubbish had built up. A number of police officers and 22 spectators were later awarded bravery awards for their deeds on the day. The old wooden roof of the stand was due to be replaced the day after the Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the team would be playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 for rebuilding work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19 months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost ¬£2.6 million (¬£ million today) to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986. More than ¬£3.5 million (¬£ million today) was raised for victims of the fire and their families through the Bradford Disaster Appeal Fund. Memorials have been erected at the ground and at Bradford City Hall, the latter of which was provided by Bradford's twin town of Hamm, in Germany. The disaster is also marked by an annual remembrance ceremony on 11 May at Bradford City Hall, and an annual Easter-weekend youth tournament, contested between Bradford, Lincoln and other teams from across Europe. Other uses Valley Parade hosted its first international football game just two months after its first Football League match. The game's governing bodies wanted to promote the sport in the West Riding of Yorkshire, so chose Valley Parade to host a game between an English League side and an Irish League side, despite the ground not being up to standard. An estimated 20,000 spectators attended the match on 10 October 1903, which the English League won 2‚Äì1. Over the next 20 years the ground hosted a number of other representative games, including an England international trial, the 1904 FA Amateur Cup Final and an under-15s schoolboy international between England and Scotland. But it was not until 6 April 1987 that the ground hosted another international when England under-18s drew 1‚Äì1 with Switzerland. Other under-18 fixtures have been played since, the last of which was between England and Belgium in November 2000. It hosted two England under-21 international friendlies. The first was against Denmark's under-21s on 8 October 1999. The hosts thrashed the visitors 4‚Äì1. The other was against Italy's under-21s 26 March 2002. it ended in a 1 - 1 draw with 21,642 in attendance. Valley Parade's next international came seven years later when Bradford City hosted an under-19s European Championship qualifying game, in which England defeated Slovakia 4‚Äì1. The England women's team have also played at Valley Parade, including their first home match under the auspices of The Football Association in 1994 against Spain. Bradford (Park Avenue) have played 29 games at Valley Parade, including a 2‚Äì0 friendly victory over Swiss side AC Lugano in 1962, and all their home fixtures in 1973‚Äì74, their last season before extinction. Bradford's rugby league side Bradford Northern played a number of fixtures at Valley Parade between 1920 and 1937, as well as three games in the 1980s, and 1990s. Bradford Northern became Bradford Bulls with the advent of the Super League, and played two seasons at Valley Parade in 2001 and 2002 during redevelopment of their home ground at Odsal. Records Bradford City's average and highest league attendances at Valley Parade, for full seasons, since the ground reopened in 1986 The record attendance at Valley Parade is 39,146, for Bradford City's FA Cup fourth round tie against Burnley on 11 March 1911. The highest league attendance of 37,059, was for a Bradford derby match between Bradford City and Bradford (Park Avenue) on 17 September 1927 in Division Three (North). The record attendance since the Valley Parade grounds were rebuilt in 1986 (all- seated attendance) is 24,321, set on 7 March 2015 in the 2015 FA Cup Quarter- finals draw against Reading, surpassing the previous record of 23,971, set on 10 December 2012 in the club's 2012‚Äì13 Football League Cup Quarter-finals victory over Arsenal. The lowest attendance for a league home match at Valley Parade is 1,249, on 15 May 1981, for a Division Four fixture with Hereford United. The record gate receipts that Bradford City have received are ¬£181,990 for the Premier League game with Manchester United on 13 January 2001. Official attendance figures for league games were not kept by The Football League until 1925. City's official highest average attendance at Valley Parade since then is 18,551 for the 1928‚Äì29 promotion season from Division Three (North), although the club reported an average of 22,585 in 1920‚Äì21. It was not until City were promoted to the Premier League in 1999 that the club again recorded average attendances of higher than 18,000. City recorded an average of 18,030 in 1999‚Äì2000, and 18,511 the following season. During their two years at Valley Parade, the Bradford Bulls recorded their highest attendance on 4 March 2001 against St. Helens with a crowd of 16,572. The Bulls averaged 11,488 in 2002 for Super League VII. The highest crowd for a Bradford Northern fixture at Valley Parade was 20,973 on 13 February 1926 for a Challenge Cup game against Keighley, which finished 2‚Äì2. Transport Bradford is served by two railway stations. They are Bradford Interchange, which is also the city's main bus terminus, and away from the ground, and Bradford Forster Square, which is away from the ground. Bradford Interchange connects to Leeds railway station for London North Eastern Railway and CrossCountry train services, Grand Central provide a direct service to London, and provides First Bradford and Keighley Bus Company buses to the ground. Forster Square, which provides train services operated by Northern, also connects to Leeds. The stadium has no parking facilities available to supporters on matchdays. In 2000, as part of the expansion of Valley Parade, the club drew up a green transport plan in a bid to ease traffic congestion around the ground. Proposals included a new railway station on the line between Leeds and Bradford Forster Square, and a discounted bus service. No station has ever been built, and a discounted bus route was withdrawn because of low patronage. References External links * Bradford City A.F.C. Bradford (Park Avenue) A.F.C.

It won the 1980 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for both the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1979, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1980. Plot A scientific expedition to the planet Saturn in 2025, aboard the ship Ringmaster, discovers a strange satellite in orbit around the planet. Commanding the ship is Cirocco Jones, a tall NASA career woman, aided by astronomer Gaby Plauget, the clone twin physicists April and August Polo, pilot Eugene Springfield, physician Calvin Greene and engineer Bill (whose last name is never given). As they reach the satellite they realize it is a huge hollow torus, a Stanford torus habitat. Before they can report this the ship is entangled in cables from the object. The crew is rendered unconscious and later wake up inside the habitat. Initially separated, Cirroco and Gaby find each other and travel together through the world inside the torus to find the rest of the crew. As the story progresses, they find Calvin living as a companion inside a Blimp, an intelligent gasbag a kilometer long, one of many that swim forever in the air inside the habitat. Calvin can speak to the blimp and understand its responses, which consist of whistles. His blimp's name is Whistlestop, in human terms. Calvin helps Gaby and Cirocco find the other crew members (except April). He ultimately decides to leave his human companions to live with the blimp permanently. The remaining companions encounter the Titanides, strange centaur-like beings who speak a language based on music. Cirocco finds she has the ability to speak their language. The Titanides are in a perpetual state of war with the Angels, birdlike humanoid creatures. They fight because of an impulse that occurs when they are near each other, but do not know why they have the impulse. The humans learn from the Titanides that there is a controlling intelligence, called Gaea, and it lives 600 km above them, in the hub of the torus. Cirocco, Gaby, and Gene decide to climb up to this place using the support cables that maintain the structure against centrifugal force. During the journey, Gene's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. He rapes Gaby and then rapes Cirocco. He thinks he killed Gaby while he gives chase to Cirocco only Gaby is not dead and eventually cuts his ear off with a hatchet. After he passes out Gaby destroys his face. They get rid of him and keep going. Months of climbing brings them high in one of the spokes of the great wheel. There they find April, who has been transformed into an angel. She, like the other Angels, is solitary by nature, and can hardly bear to be near them. Finally reaching the hub, they discover Gaea, who presents herself as a frumpy middle aged woman. She explains that the great wheel is very old, and some of the regional intelligences around the rim have rebelled against the center. It was, in fact, one of these regional intelligences that had captured the Ringmaster and altered its crew. Gaea rescued them and, unable to change them back, placed them where they would be happy. She makes an offer to Cirocco: in exchange for long life and unusual abilities, she can be Gaea's agent at the Rim, her Wizard. Cirocco accepts, with the condition that the war between the Titanides and Angels must stop. Gaea's personality is that of a movie addict. She has been watching television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies, especially from Hollywood's Golden Age. The Titanide-Angel war was the result of her having seen war movies, and realizing that humanity will inevitably declare war on her. The war is a way for her to practice.

As of 2011, she had sold 10 million albums worldwide and has won numerous national and international awards, including four Latin Grammys, seven Brazilian MTV Video Music Awards, nine Multishow de M√∫sica Brasileira awards, 5 APCAs, and six Pr√™mio TIM de M√∫sica. Marisa is considered by Rolling Stone Brasil to be the second greatest singer, behind only Elis Regina. She also has two albums (MM and Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor-de-Rosa e Carv√£o) on the list of the 100 best albums of Brazilian music. Biography Monte was born in Rio de Janeiro, daughter of the engineer Carlos Saboia Monte and Sylvia Marques de Azevedo Monte. On her father's side, she is descended from the Saboias, one of the oldest Italian families in Brazil. She studied singing, piano, and drums as a child, and began studying opera singing at 14. After failing to break through into 1980s Brazilian pop rock she went into semi-exile in Italy, where she met the famous producer Nelson Motta. Thereafter she became a hybrid of MPB diva and pop rock performer. While most of her music is in the style of modern MPB, she has also recorded traditional samba and folk tunes, largely in collaboration with such musicians and songwriters as Carlinhos Brown, Arnaldo Antunes, and Nando Reis and producer Arto Lindsay. She has also collaborated with the New York pop music vanguard, including Laurie Anderson, David Byrne, Marc Ribot, Bernie Worrell and Philip Glass. =1987‚Äì1990: Beginnings and first album= Aged 19, she moved to Rome, where she studied bel canto for 10 months. After that, she began appearing in bars and nightclubs singing Brazilian music, accompanied by friends. One of these shows was attended by the producer Nelson Motta, who directed her first show in Rio de Janeiro upon her return. The Veludo Azul show had seasons in Rio and S√£o Paulo, and caught the attention of record companies. Monte was invited to record her first special by the television program TV Manchete, which was called MM, and released on LP and VHS. Her first big hit appeared on this album, \\"Bem Que Se Quis\\" (the Nelson Motta version for the Italian composer Pino Daniele's \\"E Po' Che Fa\\"). Her hit was played exhaustively on Brazilian radio stations, and was included on the soundtrack of Lauro C√©sar Muniz's soap opera O Salvador de P√°tria on the Globo network (1989). The soundtrack sold 500 thousand copies and is No. 62 on the list of 100 greatest Brazilian music albums. =1991‚Äì1996: Artistic development= In 1991, Marisa Monte released her second album, titled Mais, on EMI. This album produced the hit \\"Beija Eu\\", considered one of the best MPB songs, coming in at the 26th position, in a study published by journalist Zeca Camargo on Portal G1. In 1994, she released her third album, Verde, Anil, Amarelo, Cor-de-Rosa e Carv√£o. This album is on the list of the 100 best albums of Brazilian music, in position No. 87. =2000‚Äì2001: Consolidated musical career= In 2000, she released Mem√≥rias, Cr√¥nicas, e Declarac√µes de Amor, which was followed by a DVD of the same name in 2001, being a recording of her performances over three nights at the ATL Hall, in Rio de Janeiro. In 2011, she contributed a collaboration with Devendra Banhart and Rodrigo Amarante \\"N√∫ Com A Minha M√∫sica\\" (\\"Naked with My Music\\") for the Red Hot Organization's most recent charitable album Red Hot+Rio 2, a follow-up to the 1996 Red Hot+Rio.

She later sang, alongside Brazilian performers BNeg√£o and Seu Jorge, the samba \\"Aquele Abra√ßo\\", translated as \\"That embrace\\", closing Rio's presentation for the occasion while Pel√© was revealed to be present at the ceremony, disguised as Rio's traditional \\"Malandro do Morro\\". Monte owns the rights to all of her songs; it was her chief demand for renewing her contract with EMI Music.Musitec She also released her single \\"Nao E Proibido\\", which was also used in the soundtrack of a video game by EA Sports, 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa.

These medieval land terms include the following: * a burgage, a plot of land rented from a lord or king * a hide: the hide, from the Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"family\\", was, in the early medieval period, a land-holding that was considered sufficient to support a family. This was equivalent to 60 to 120 old acres (approximately ) depending on the quality of the land. The hide was the basis for the assessment of taxes. The hide was not ubiquitous in Anglo-Saxon England, with, for example, land in Kent being assessed in sulungs (approximately twice the size of the average hide). * a Knight's fee: is the amount of land for which the services of a knight (for 40 days) were due to the Crown. It was determined by land value, and the number of hides in a Knight's Fee varied. * a hundred: a division of an English shire consisting of 100 hides. The hundreds of Stoke, Desborough and Burnham in Buckinghamshire are known as the Chiltern Hundreds. * a franconian Lan used in Poland since the 13th century, consisted of 43.2 morgs = 23 to 28 hectares. The term Lan was also used to indicate a full-sized farm, as opposed to one split up into a number of smaller sections. * a wapentake: a subdivision of a county used in Yorkshire and other areas of strong Danish influence. It is similar to hundred or a ward. It was used in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland. * a shire was originally a type of a subdivision of a county; some shires evolved into administrative areas equivalent to a county; a shire was headed by a shire reeve (becoming sheriff, in Saskatchewan the mayor of a rural municipality is a reeve); shires were most commonly subdivided into hundreds, but other types of subdivisions were also made * a rape: Sussex was divided into six rapes, which were intermediate divisions between the county and the hundred. A rape was to have its own river, forest and castle. * a lathe: Kent was divided into five lathes, from the Old English laeth, meaning district. * a riding: was a division of land in Yorkshire and in Lindsey, which was the northern part of modern day Lincolnshire. The riding was a third part of the shire. The name is derived from the Old Norse , meaning \\"one-third\\". * a ward: a ward is a subdivision of a county, equivalent to a wapentake or a hundred. It was used in Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland, and Durham.

He is a protagonist player character throughout much of the Wing Commander game series and also appears in several Wing Commander novels, notably the novelizations of Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger and Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom, and in the film Wing Commander. In Wing Commander III, Wing Commander IV, Wing Commander: Prophecy and animated television series Wing Commander Academy, Blair was played and voiced by veteran actor and Star Wars legend Mark Hamill. Blair was one of the best received characters in PC gaming during the 1990s. Appearances Blair has no official name for the first two installments of the series; the player is allowed to personalize the character's name and call sign. In Ultimate Strategy Guide for Wing Commander I & II, the character is named Carl T. LaFong, nicknamed \\"Prankster\\" (Carl T. LaFong become a separate character in Star*Soldier the manual for Wing Commander Arena). In Super Wing Commander (a remake of the first game made for Macintosh and 3DO), the character is named Jason Armstrong (Jason Armstrong becomes a separate character in Star*Soldier the manual for Wing Commander Arena) (curiously Wing Commander 3 was already in production using the Christopher Blair name when Super Wing Commander was released using Armstrong), and in the Sega Mega-CD version of Wing Commander, he does not have a name, only a call sign, \\"Hotshot\\". Origin Systems' in-house \\"bible\\" referred to him as \\"Bluehair\\", and when the full motion video cut scenes in Wing Commander III required the character be given a name, this tag was shortened to \\"Blair\\". \\"Christopher\\" is the first name of series creator Chris Roberts. In Wing Commander III and IV, the player is still allowed to assign Blair a call sign, but William R. Forstchen's novelizations describe him as using the call sign \\"Maverick\\". This is confirmed in Wing Commander: Prophecy. The series \\"bible\\" indicates that other candidates for Blair's call sign included \\"Falcon\\" and \\"Phoenix\\", the latter of which saw print in the novel End Run. The \\"Maverick\\" call sign is widely used in later publications. Throughout the series Blair was portrayed as competent and cool-headed, though not unemotional, and in the animated TV series his \\"rebellious\\" cockpit moniker is assigned him as an ironic reference to his \\" by-the-book\\" personality.Cobbett, Richard (April 16, 2011). Saturday Crapshoot: Wing Commander Academy  PC Gamer Finally, during the course of Wing Commander III, Blair finds out that he is the game's titular \\"Heart of the Tiger\\", and in the Wing Commander IV novelization uses this as a public call sign. In the second novelization in an abortive trilogy based on the film, Blair adopts the call sign \\"Pilgrim\\" in an acknowledgment of his ethnic roots. =In video games= In the original Wing Commander, Blair is a calm, handsome fellow who rarely speaks. Despite his lack of volubility, he rises steadily into the ranks of the TCS Tiger's Claw, eventually leading his flight wing to numerous successes in the Vega Sector campaign, Operation Thor's Hammer and the Firekkan campaign, eventually reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel and being awarded numerous medals, including the Terran Confederation Medal of Honor. When the Claw moves into the K'tithrak Mang sector to deal with a Kilrathi command post, however, his number comes up: with the sole exception of a few pilots who had been transferred to other ships, and Blair himself who is out on patrol, the Claw is lost with all hands; no one can confirm how. Blair's flight data recorder picks up odd signals that appear to be Kilrathi fighters with cloaking devices, but it is stolen when he lands on the TCS Austin. Admiral Geoffrey Tolwyn believes that Blair is lying to cover his own treachery, finds him guilty of negligence (due to lack of evidence), demotes him to captain and exiles him to the backwater Caernavon Station. Blair is widely branded the \\"Coward of K'tithrak Mang\\" and reviled throughout the Terran Confederation. Ten years later, in Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi, Blair is still on Caernavon, but when the TCS Concordia, Tolwyn's new flagship, jumps in-system and is ambushed, Blair singlehandedly rescues it. Cognizant of the need to keep the best pilots on the front lines, Tolwyn reluctantly shifts Blair to active service aboard the Concordia, where he serves alongside a number of old friends from the Claw: Jeannette \\"Angel\\" Devereaux, Mariko \\"Spirit\\" Tanaka, Etienne \\"Doomsday\\" Montclair, defected Kilrathi pilot Ralgha \\"Hobbes\\" nar Hhallas and Zack \\"Jazz\\" Colson. New to the roster is Dirk \\"Stingray\\" Wright, enthusiastic and brash. James \\"Paladin\\" Taggart drops in on occasion, but Todd \\"Maniac\\" Marshall is far away doing testing on Morningstar-class heavy fighters. To dampen the mood, however, a saboteur is on the Concordia, committing terrorist acts and assassinating Confed personnel. In his time aboard the Concordia, Blair is able to finally record incontrovertible evidence of the Kilrathi Strakha stealth fighters, uncover and defeat the traitor (\\"Jazz\\" Colson), destroy the K'Tithrak Mang HQ and avenge the Tiger's Claw, and start a romantic liaison with Angel. He is also promoted to the rank of colonel by a grudgingly respectful Tolwyn. More ominously, he gains the personal attention of Kilrathi Crown Prince Thrakhath nar Kiranka; he is eventually given the Kilrathi warrior name \\"Heart of the Tiger\\". Blair subsequently becomes involved in a number of Secret Ops projects, including the TCS Gettysburg mutiny, the defection of four Kilrathi planets to the Confederation, the testing of the new Morningstar heavy fighter and deployment of the Crossbow prototype bomber, and the destruction of the traitorous Society of Mandarins (culminating in Maverick finally defeating and killing Jazz in single combat). He fights at the Battle of Earth and is grounded with injuries for six months, during which time the Kilrathi push the Confederation to the wall. He resumes active duty just in time for Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger to start. With the Concordia lost in the Vespus system and his lover, Angel gone MIA, Blair (now portrayed by Mark Hamill) is assigned to the TCS Victory, a carrier twice as old as he is (late 30s) and being kept to the rear lines of the war. Despite the relatively unglamorous nature of his assignment, Blair, along with his wing of pilots including top aces Hobbes and Maniac, is able to provide at least some defense for the TCS Behemoth before its destruction at the hands of a traitor. It is from this point that Blair discovers what truly happened to Angel through a holographic recording. An unstable and vengeful Blair then leads a wing that is responsible for delivering the Temblor Bomb on the Kilrathi home planet, resulting in the death of the Emperor, as well as Prince Thrakhath (engaged and defeated by Blair in the planet's atmosphere) and is able to avenge Angel. The destruction of Kilrah leads to the surrender of the Kilrathi and the signing of a permanent peace treaty, ending the 40-year Terran-Kilrathi War. Blair is now entitled to add a new label to his roster: \\"Savior of the Confederation\\". After the war, Blair attempts to return to his roots on Nephele II and become a farmer. Tolwyn reactivates him at the start of Wing Commander IV: The Price of Freedom however, to investigate allegations that the Union of Border Worlds has been causing trouble for Confed shipping (claims that Confed is doing the same thing to Border Worlds shipping are ignored). A third faction is eventually implicated, and Blair succeeds in uncovering it, though he is forced to defect to the Union of Border Worlds to do so, since the faction appears to be supported by elements within Confed. This so-called \\"Black Lance Affair\\" results in the disgrace and suicide of Space Marshal Tolwyn. Blair remains in the military for the rest of his life, though he accepts a transfer from Space Forces to Navy. He is the architect and main proponent of the 'mega-carrier' plan, and is aboard the TCS Midway, the first of the new class, on its maiden voyage, detailed in Wing Commander: Prophecy. When the ship unexpectedly encounters invaders from another part of the galaxy (codenamed \\"Nephilim\\"), the Midway single-handedly beats them back, mostly led by player character Lieutenant Lance Casey. Commodore Blair is, unfortunately, lost in the action against the Nephilim, missing and presumed dead on a critical mission to assist Casey in destroying the aliens' galaxy- invading wormhole. =In other media= Mark Hamill also voiced Blair in the Wing Commander Academy animated series. In the 1999 live-action film Wing Commander, Blair was portrayed by actor Freddie Prinze, Jr. This version of Blair was a \\"Pilgrim\\" who possessed a superhuman space navigation ability. He was also on much friendlier terms with Admiral Tolwyn. Blair appears in the following Wing Commander novels: Wing Commander: Heart of the Tiger (WCIII game novelization), Wing Commander: The Price of Freedom (WCIV game novelization), Wing Commander (movie novelization), Wing Commander: Pilgrim Stars (sequel to the movie novel; Blair chooses the callsign \\"Pilgrim\\" by novel's end), Wing Commander: Pilgrim Truth (third novel based upon the movie), and Wing Commander: End Run (in this novel his callsign is \\"Phoenix\\").

The Ems Ukaz or Ems Ukase (; ), was a secret decree (ukaz) of Tsar Alexander II of Russia issued in 1876, banning the use of the Ukrainian language in print, with the exception of reprinting of old documents. The ukaz also forbade the import of Ukrainian publications and the staging of plays or lectures in Ukrainian. It was named after the city of Bad Ems, Germany, where it was promulgated.  Background  In the 1860s, a decade and a half after the Imperial Russian government had broken up the Brotherhood of Sts Cyril and Methodius in Kiev (March 1847), and exiled or arrested its founder Nikolay Kostomarov and other prominent figures, Ukrainian intellectuals were gaining further awareness of their cultural background. Hromada cultural associations (named after the traditional village assembly) started in a number of cities, and Sunday schools started in the cities and towns (the Russian Imperial administration had neglected education). The new cultural movement was partly driven by publications in both Russian and Ukrainian, including journals (such as Kostomarov's Osnova, 1861‚Äì62, and Hlibov's Chernyhosvs‚Äôkyy Lystok, 1861‚Äì63), historical and folkloristic monographs (Kostomarov's biography of the Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, Kulish's two-volume folklore collection Zapiski o Yuzhnoy Rusi, Notes on Southern Rus', 1856‚Äì57), and elementary primers (Kulish's Hramatka, 1857, 1861, Shevchenko's Bukvar Yuzhnoruskiy, 1861 ). In Osnova, Kostomarov published his influential article \\"Dve russkiye narodnosti\\" (\\"Two Russian Nationalities\\"). Although Ukrainianism had been considered popular and somewhat chic in Russian cultural circles, a debate began at the time over its relation to the ideology of Russian Pan-Slavism‚Äîepitomized by a quotation of Pushkin: \\"will not all the Slavic streams merge into the Russian sea?\\"‚Äîand a rhetoric of criticism emerged. Conservative Russians called the Ukrainian movement a \\"Polish intrigue\\", while Polish commentators had been complaining that Ukrainianism had been used as a weapon against Polish culture in right- bank Ukraine. After the 1861 emancipation of the serfs in the Russian Empire, many landowners were unhappy with the loss of their serfs, while peasants were generally displeased with the terms of the emancipation. In this atmosphere of discontent, increasing reports reached the imperial government that Ukrainian leaders were plotting to separate from Russia. The 1863 January Uprising in Poland raised tensions around the issue of ethnic separatism in general even further. Several Ukrainian activists were arrested, Sunday schools and hromadas were closed and their publication activities were suspended. A new Ukrainian translation by Pylyp Morachevskyi of parts of the New Testament was vetted and passed by the Imperial Academy of Sciences, but rejected by the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox church, because it was considered politically suspect. Volodymyr Kozyrsky, Vasyl Shenderovsky, \\"The spiritual valour of Pylyp Morachevsky (to the bicentenary anniversary of his birth)\\", Zerkalo Nedeli (the Mirror Weekly), 5‚Äì19 August 2006, in Russian, in Ukrainian . In response, Interior Minister Count Pyotr Valuyev issued a decree through an internal document circulated to the censors on 18 July 1863, known as Valuyev's Circular. The Circular implemented a policy based on the opinion of the Kiev Censorship Committee cited in the Circular, that \\"the Ukrainian language never existed, does not exist, and shall never exist\\". It banned the publication of secular and religious books (apart from belles-lettres), on the premise that the distribution of such publications was a tool for fostering separatist tendencies, coming primarily from Poland.  Ems Ukaz  In the 1870s, the Kiev Hromada and the South-Western Branch of the Imperial Russian Geographic Society began to publish important works in Kiev, in Russian, about Ukrainian ethnography. Authors included Mykhailo Drahomanov, Volodymyr Antonovych, Ivan Rudchenko, and Pavlo Chubynsky. They held an Archaeological Congress in 1874, and published in the Russian-language paper Kievskiy telegraf. A member of the Geographic Society, Mikhail Yuzefovich, sent two letters to St Petersburg warning of separatist activity. Tsar Alexander II appointed an Imperial Commission on Ukrainophile Propaganda in the Southern Provinces of Russia, which found evidence of a danger to the state, and recommended extending the scope of the Valuyev decree. While enjoying a spa in Bad Ems, Germany, in May 1876, the Tsar signed what would come to be called the \\"Ems Ukaz\\", extending the publication ban to apply to all books and song lyrics in the \\"Little Russian dialect\\", and to prohibit the importation of such materials. Public lectures, plays, and song performances in Ukrainian were forbidden, suspect teachers removed from teaching, and presumably dangerous organizations and newspapers shut down. The ukaz coincided with other actions against Ukrainian culture. Drahomanov and fellow activist Mykola Ziber were sacked from their posts at Kiev's University of St Vladimir, and emigrated along with other cultural leaders such as Fedir Vovk and Serhiy Podolynsky. The situation was exposed by professor Mykhailo Drahomanov at the 1878 Paris International Literary Congress. = Yaryzhka = In 1881, the new Tsar Alexander III amended the ukaz. Ukrainian lyrics and dictionaries would be allowed, but the Kulishivka Ukrainian alphabet was still prohibited, and such publications would have to write Ukrainian with Russian orthography. This usage was disparagingly called the Yaryzhka (, ) by some Ukrainians in reference to the Russian letter yery . Performance of Ukrainian plays and humorous songs could be approved by local authorities, but Ukrainian-only theatres and troupes could not be established. Many illegal performances and publications were delivered through ingenuity and bribery, but Ukrainian cultural development practically ceased.  Aftermath  After the Russian Revolution of 1905, the Imperial Academy of Sciences recommended that the ukaz's restrictions be lifted. Ukrainian-language newspapers began publication, Prosvita (‚ÄòEnlightenment‚Äô) educational societies were formed, some university professors lectured in Ukrainian, and the Orthodox bishop of the Podolia vicariate, Parfeniy Levytsky, allowed the language to be used in services and church schools there. In 1910, concerned about potential revolutionary activity, Interior Minister Pyotr Stolypin restored the ukaz's restrictions and shut down the Prosvita societies and Ukrainian-language publications. Russian-language press and intellectuals launched a campaign against the idea of Ukrainian autonomy or separatism. Thus, self-aware Ukrainians remained a small intelligentsia in Dnieper Ukraine, out of touch with a much larger rural population who lacked the opportunity for a cultural education. Russian imperial ideology dominated the schools and the army, and the Russian language was the only one used for official business in the urban workplace, government offices, and public services. In the meantime, Ukrainian self-identity would grow in Austro-Hungarian Galicia, out of reach of Russian imperial authorities. The ukaz was never cancelled, but became void along with all other imperial Russian laws in the February Revolution of 1917‚Äì18. After the Revolution, Ukrainian language, education and culture was allowed to flower in the Ukrainian National Republic, the Hetmanate, and under the Ukrainization policies of Soviet Ukraine before 1931.

Sahl pioneered a style of social satire which pokes fun at political and current event topics using improvised monologues and only a newspaper as a prop. Sahl spent his early years in Los Angeles and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area where he made his professional stage debut at the hungry i nightclub in 1953. His popularity grew quickly, and after a year at the club he traveled the country doing shows at established nightclubs, theaters and college campuses. In 1960 he became the first comedian to have a cover story written about him by Time magazine. He appeared on various television shows, played a number of film roles, and performed a one-man show on Broadway. Television host Steve Allen claimed that Sahl was \\"the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.\\" His social satire performances broke new ground in live entertainment, as a stand-up comic talking about the real world of politics at that time was considered \\"revolutionary.\\" It inspired many later comics to become stage comedians, including Lenny Bruce, Jonathan Winters, George Carlin and Woody Allen. Allen credits Sahl's new style of humor with \\"opening up vistas for people like me.\\" Numerous politicians became his fans, with John F. Kennedy asking him to write his jokes for campaign speeches. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, however, Sahl became obsessed with the Warren Report's inaccuracies and conclusions, and spoke about it often during his shows. This alienated much of his audience and led to a decline in his popularity for the remainder of the 1960s. By the 1970s, however, his shows and popularity staged a partial comeback which continues to the present.\\"Mort Sahl invented stand-up comedy ‚Äî so what‚Äôs he doing at a community theatre in Northern California?\\", National Post, May 25, 2015 A biography of Sahl, Last Man Standing, by James Curtis, was released in 2017.\\"Comedian Mort Sahl and biographer James Curtis talk about ‚ÄòLast Man Standing,‚Äô the story of Sahl‚Äôs fearless, funny life\\", Orange County Register, June 2, 2017 Early life and education Sahl was born on May 11, 1927, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the only child of Jewish parents. His father, Harry Sahl, came from an immigrant family on New York's Lower East Side, and hoped to become a Broadway playwright. He met his wife when she responded to an advertisement he took out in a poetry magazine. Unable to break into the writing field they moved to Canada where he owned a tobacco store in Montreal.Time magazine, August 15, 1960, pp. 44-48 The family later relocated to Los Angeles, California where his father, unable to become a Hollywood writer, worked as a clerk and court reporter for the FBI. Sahl notes, \\"My dad was disappointed in his dreams and he distrusted that world for me.\\" Sahl went to Belmont High School in Los Angeles where he wrote for the school's newspaper. Actor Richard Crenna was a classmate. When the U.S. entered World War II after Pearl Harbor, Sahl, then fourteen, joined the school's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC). He won a medal for marksmanship and an American Legion Americanism award. Wanting to express his patriotism, he wore his ROTC uniform to school and in public and, when he turned fifteen, he dropped out of high school to join the Army by lying about his age. His mother tracked him down and brought him back home two weeks later after she revealed his true age. Upon graduating from high school, his father tried to get him into West Point and had received his Congressman's help. But Sahl had by then already enlisted in the United States Air Force. He was later stationed in Alaska with the 93rd Air Depot Group. In the military, however, he resisted the discipline and authoritarian control it had over his life. He expressed his nonconformity by growing a beard and refusing to wear a cap as required. He also wrote articles for a small newspaper criticizing the military, which resulted in his being penalized with three months of KP duty. He was discharged in 1947 and enrolled in Compton College, followed by the University of Southern California. He received a B.S. degree in 1950 with majors in traffic engineering and city management. He continued with the masters program but dropped out to become an actor and playwright. Career =Breaking into comedy= Between 1950 and 1953 he tried to get jobs as a stand-up comedian in about 30 nightclubs throughout Los Angeles, but with no success. NBC, where he once auditioned, told him he would never succeed as a comedian. He even offered to perform free during intermissions for the chance to show his talent. He recalls that period: \\"Despite all the folklore about the faith of friends in the struggling young artist, my friends constantly discouraged me.\\" He and a friend then rented an old theater, which they called Theater X, for \\"experimental,\\" and he began writing and staging one-act plays. One of his plays was titled \\"Nobody Trusted the Truth.\\" But unable to attract a large enough audience, they eventually closed the theater. For income, Sahl began doing odd jobs and writing. He worked as a used car salesman and a messenger, and wrote an unpublished novel and short stories. He went to New York hoping to sell his plays, but only managed to earn about eighteen dollars a week. He recalls, \\"I couldn't get a thing going. I was working on a novel, I was out of work, and I was out of gas.\\" As a result, he decided to try something different, by performing his plays as monologues. He felt it would be easier to do his monologue on stage instead of trying to sell it to others. \\"I knew that if I was going to get anything done, I'd have to do it myself,\\" he says. He returned to Los Angeles where he appeared at some clubs but his new style of monologue comedy received little attention. In 1953 he began dating Sue Babior. When she moved to Berkeley to study at the University of California, Sahl hitchhiked there to be with her. He spent his time auditing classes and hanging out at local coffee houses. For income he wrote for a few avant-garde publications. He slept in the back seat of a friend's car since Babior was living with roommates, including Nancy Droeger and Althia Sims. \\"Things were simple then,\\" he says. \\"All we had to worry about was the destiny of man.\\"Playboy magazine, February, 1969 He felt at home in the San Francisco Bay Area, commenting, \\"I was born in San Francisco.\\" The three years he lived in Berkeley were a valuable experience, he said. He sought out any clubs where he could perform as a stand-up, and Babior suggested he audition for the hungry i, a nightclub in San Francisco. Its owner, Enrico Banducci, took an immediate liking to Sahl's comedy style and offered him a job at $75 a week (About $720 in 2020 money), which became his first steady job as a stand-up comedian. Word about Sahl's satirical comedy acts spread quickly. He received good reviews from influential newspaper columnist, Herb Caen, which gave him instant credibility: \\"I don't know where Mr. Sahl came from but I'm glad he's here,\\" he wrote after watching his show. Caen began inviting his own friends, such as film comedians Danny Kaye and Eddie Cantor, to watch Sahl's performances. Cantor took him \\"under his wing\\" and gave him suggestions.By the end of his first year at the hungry i, Sahl was earning $3,000 a week (about $29,000 a week in 2020 money) and performing to packed houses. \\"I'd be washing cars if it weren't for Enrico,\\" he said later in his career, appreciating that Banducci was the first club owner to give him the chance to perform as a stand-up comedian. =Nightclub shows and national acclaim= After a year at the hungry i, Sahl began appearing at clubs throughout the country, including the Black Orchid and Mister Kelly's in Chicago, the Crescendo in Los Angeles, and the Village Vanguard and the Blue Angel in New York City.Hashagen, Paul. Fire Department, City of New York, Turner Publishing (2002) p. 148 Many of the clubs had never before had a stand-up comedian perform, which required Sahl to break in as a new kind of act. \\"I had to build up my own network of places to play,\\" he says. Numerous celebrities dropped by to see his shows after they heard about the \\"new phenomenon,\\" referring to Sahl's unique style of comedy. Woody Allen, who saw his show at the Blue Angel in 1954, commented that \\"he was suddenly this great genius that appeared who revolutionized the medium.\\" British comedy actor John Cleese became immediately interested in Sahl's radical style of humor, and accorded to him the same level of respect that the Beatles once reserved for Elvis Presley. On The Ed Sullivan Show in 1960 Television host Steve Allen, who originated the Tonight Show, said he was \\"struck by how amateur he seemed,\\" but added that the observation was not meant as a criticism, but as a \\"compliment\\". He noted that all the previous successful comics dressed formally, were glib and well-rehearsed, and were always in control of their audiences. Allen said that Sahl's \\"very un-show business manner was one of the things I liked when I first saw him work.\\" Sahl dressed casually, with no tie and usually wearing his trademark V-neck campus- style sweater. His stage presence was seen as being \\"candid and cool, the antithesis of the slick comic,\\" states theater critic Gerald Nachman. And although Sahl acquired a reputation for being an intellectual comedian, it was an image he disliked and disagreed with: \\"It was absurd. I was barely a C student,\\" he said. His naturalness on stage was partly due to his preferring improvisation over carefully rehearsed monologues. Sahl explained: His casual style of stand-up, where he seemed to be one-on-one with his audience, influenced new comedians, including Lenny Bruce and Dick Gregory. Sahl was the least controversial, however, because he dressed and looked \\"collegiate\\" and focused on politics, while Bruce confronted sexual and language conventions and Gregory focused on the civil rights movement. After seeing Mort Sahl on stage, Woody Allen, whose writings were often about his personal life, decided to give it a try: \\"I'd never had the nerve to talk about it before. Then Mort Sahl came along with a whole new style of humor, opening up vistas for people like me.\\" Commenting about Sahl's monologues, Nachman describes him as a \\"gifted narrator, so good at taking you along on his travels that you didn't quite realize until the show was over that you had been on a labyrinthine journey.\\" The speed with which Sahl gave his monologues was also notable. British film critic Penelope Gilliatt recalls how Sahl's improvisation \\"goes on a breakneck stammering loop and you think it will never make the circle. It always does.\\" For her it was like watching a circus act: \\"He freewheels a bike on a high wire tightrope with his brain racing and his hands off the handlebars.\\" Sahl's popularity \\"mushroomed like an Atomic cloud during the 50s,\\" says filmmaker Robert B. Weide, adding, \\"Simply put, Mort Sahl reinvented stand-up comedy.\\" Time magazine in 1960 published a cover story about him and his rise to fame, in which they described him as \\"the best of the New Comedians [and] the first notable American political satirist since Will Rogers.\\" Along with his nightclub performances, he appeared in some films and on television shows, including his network debut on The NBC Comedy Hour in May 1956.\\"The Big Party\\" (1959, NBC) (on YouTube.com); accessed February 14, 2015. His audience had also widened to include not only students and a \\"hip\\" public, but now even noted politicians sought out his shows. Some became friends, such as presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who asked him to prepare a bank of political jokes he could use at public functions. Kennedy liked his style of political satire and what he described as Sahl's \\"relentless pursuit of everybody.\\" Adlai Stevenson and Hubert Humphrey were fans, Humphrey stating that \\"whenever there is a political bloat, Mort sticks a pin in it.\\" They valued the fact that he stayed current and took material from major newspapers and magazines. He kept his material fresh, wrote few notes, and entertained his audiences by presenting otherwise serious news with his brand of humor. He was not fond of television news, however, which he blamed in 1960 for \\"spoon-feeding\\" the public, and was therefore responsible for the \\"corruption and ignorance that may sink this country.\\" As a result of Sahl's popularity, besides getting on the cover of Time, he also became the first comedian to make a record album, the first to do college concerts and was the first comedian to win a Grammy.\\"Legendary Comedians Mort Sahl and Dick Gregory at the Rrazz Room\\", Goldstar =Declining career in 1960s= Following Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Sahl's interest in who was responsible was so great that he became a deputized member of New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's team to investigate the assassination. As a result, Sahl's comedy would often reflect his politics and included readings and commentary about the Warren Commission Report, of which he consistently disputed the accuracy.\\"Mors Sahl Live in New York City\\", January 17, 1992 He alienated much of his audience, was effectively blacklisted and more of his planned shows were cancelled. His income dropped from $1 million to $19,000 by 1964. According to Nachman, the excessive focus on the Kennedy assassination details was Sahl's undoing and wrecked his career. Sahl later admitted that \\"there's never been anything that had a stronger impact on my life than this issue,\\" but added that he nonetheless \\"thought it was a wonderful quest.\\" =Partial comeback in the 1970s to the present= Sahl in 2007 By the 1970s the rising tide of counterculture eventually fueled Sahl's partial comeback as a veteran comedian, and he was included along with the new comedians breaking into the field, such as George Carlin, Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor. In the 1980s he headlined for Banducci's new clubs in San Francisco. In the late 1980s he was trying to write screenplays, besides doing sporadic shows around the country. In 1987 he had a successful multiweek run in Australia.\\"L.A. To Get Another Taste Of The Biting Wit Of Mort Sahl\\", Los Angeles Times, March 21, 1987. In 1988 Sahl was back in New York and performed a one-man Off-Broadway show, Mort Sahl's America, which, despite getting good reviews from critics was not a box office success. The New York Times stated, \\"History has returned Mort Sahl to the spotlight when he is most needed. His style has an intuitive spontaneity. His presence is tonic.\\" Robert Weide produced a biographical documentary, Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition, which ran on PBS in 1989.'Mort Sahl: The Loyal Opposition, Whyaduck Productions, March 2, 2012. However, the level of success he once had now eluded him. One Los Angeles Times critic wrote, \\"Sahl is a man with a country but not a stage.\\" A number of television specials gave him a venue to perform in front of live audiences. The Monitor Channel broadcast a series of eight shows called Mort Sahl Live beginning in November 1991.\\"Mort Sahl Live #1 Atlantic City 11/16/91\\", The Monitor Channel, November 16, 1991\\"Mort Sahl Live #2 Anaheim 2/21/91\\", The Monitor Channel, December 12, 1991. From the 1990s on he has performed, but less often and mostly in theaters and college auditoriums.\\"BARK AND BITE : For Nearly Four Decades, Mort Sahl Has Been the Voice of Social Satire; Don't Expect Him to Back Off Now\\", Los Angeles Times, October 22, 1992 When Woody Allen saw him perform in 2001 at one of his rare New York club appearances, Allen told him, \\"this is crazy‚Äîyou should be working all the time.\\" Allen then called his manager Jack Rollins: \\"Listen, this guy is hilarious. We gotta bring him to New York.\\" Sahl then did shows at Joe's Pub in Manhattan to standing-room only audiences. Sahl is #40 on Comedy Central's list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ranked between Billy Crystal and Jon Stewart. In 2003 he received the Fifth Annual Alan King Award in American Jewish Humor from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture.\\"Mort Sahl\\", A.V. Club, January 7, 2004. In 2011, the Library of Congress placed his 1955 recording, At Sunset, on the National Recording Registry. =Satire comedy style= Sahl's humor is based on current events, especially politics, which led Milton Berle to describe him as \\"one of the greatest political satirists of all time.\\" His trademark persona is to enter the stage with a newspaper in hand, casually dressed in a V-neck sweater. He would often recite some news stories combined with satire. He was dubbed \\"Will Rogers with fangs\\" by Time magazine in 1960. Sahl would discuss people or events almost as if he were reporting them for the first time, and would digress into related stories or his own experiences. TV executive Roger Ailes said he saw him read the paper one day and after a few hours Sahl got up onstage with an entire evening's worth of new material. \\"With no writers, he just did what he had seen in the afternoon paper. He was a genius.\\" Sahl's presentation of news commentary as a form of social satire created a wide assortment of celebrity and political fans, including Adlai Stevenson, Marlene Dietrich, S.J. Perelman, Saul Bellow and Leonard Bernstein. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. said his popularity was due to the public's \\"yearning for youth, irreverence, trenchancy, satire, [and] a clean break with the past.\\" And Steve Allen introduced him on one of his shows as being \\"the only real political philosopher we have in modern comedy.\\" Combined with his improvisational skill, Sahl's naturalness was also considered unique for a stage performer. Woody Allen notes that other comics were jealous of Sahl's stage persona and did not understand how he could perform by simply talking to the audience. Nachman states that the \\"mere idea of a stand-up comic talking about the real world was in itself revolutionary ... [and] the comedians who followed him‚ÄîLenny Bruce, Woody Allen, Dick Gregory, Phyllis Diller, Shelley Berman, Jonathan Winters‚Äîwere cast in a familiar nightclub mold.\\" Personal life Sahl has been married three times. He married Susan J. Babior in 1955; they divorced in 1958. In 1967 he married actress and model China Lee and they divorced in 1991.

It denotes a rank within the former Holy Roman Empire (962‚Äì1806), which was below that of Emperor and King but above that of a Grand Duke (debatably), Prince and Duke.Meyers Taschenlexikon Geschichte 1982, vol 1, p22 & vol 2 pp106 & 319 The territory ruled by an Archduke or Archduchess was called an Archduchy. All remaining Archduchies ceased to exist in 1918. Terminology The English word is first recorded in 1530, derived from Middle French ', a 15th-century derivation from Medieval Latin ', from Latin - (Greek ) meaning \\"authority\\" or \\"primary\\" (see arch-) and ' \\"duke\\" (literally \\"leader\\"). \\"Archduke\\" (; ) is a title distinct from \\"Grand Duke\\" (; ; ), a later monarchic title borne by the rulers of other European countries (for instance, Luxembourg). History The Latin title archidux is first attested in reference to Bruno the Great, who ruled simultaneously as Archbishop of Cologne and Duke of Lotharingia in the 10th century, in the work of his biographer Ruotger. In Ruotger, the title served as an honorific denoting Bruno's unusual position rather than a formal office. The title was not used systematically until the 14th century, when the title \\"Archduke of Austria\\" was invented in the forged Privilegium Maius (1358‚Äì1359) by Duke Rudolf IV of Austria. Rudolf originally claimed the title in the form palatinus archidux (\\"palatine archduke\\"). The title was intended to emphasize the claimed precedence (thus \\"Arch-\\") of the Duchy of Austria, in an effort to put the Habsburgs on an even level with the Prince-Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, as Austria had been passed over when the Golden Bull of 1356 assigned that dignity to the four highest-ranking secular Imperial princes and three Archbishops. Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV refused to recognise the title, as did all the other ruling dynasties of the member countries of the Empire. But Duke Ernest the Iron and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title of Archduke. The archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by Emperor Frederick III, when the Habsburgs had solidified their grip on the throne of the de jure elected Holy Roman Emperor, making it de facto hereditary.Konstantin Moritz A. Langmaier: Erzherzog Albrecht VI. von √ñsterreich (1418‚Äì1463). Ein F√ºrst im Spannungsfeld von Dynastie, Regionen und Reich. K√∂ln u. a. 2015, S. 644f.https://www.researchgate.net/project/Albrecht- VI-1418-1463 Despite that imperial authorization of the title, which showed a Holy Roman Emperor from the Habsburg dynasty deciding over a title claim of the Habsburg dynasty, many ruling dynasties of the countries which formed the Empire refused to recognize the title \\"Archduke\\". Ladislaus the Posthumous, Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, never got in his lifetime the imperial authorization to use it, and accordingly, neither he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title. Emperor Frederick III himself simply used the title \\"Duke of Austria\\", never Archduke, until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (d. 1463), who used it at least from 1458. In 1477, Frederick III also granted the title of Archduke to his first cousin, Sigismund of Austria, ruler of Further Austria (). Frederick's son and heir, the future Emperor Maximilian I, started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife Mary of Burgundy (d. 1482), as Archduke never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the Low Countries (where Maximilian is still titled \\"Duke of Austria\\"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and his son Philip in the Low Countries. Archduke was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a Habsburg territory-- i.e., only by males and their consorts, appanages being commonly distributed to cadets. But these \\"junior\\" archdukes did not thereby become sovereign hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet. Usage From the 16th century onward, \\"Archduke\\" and its female form, \\"Archduchess\\", came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g. Queen Marie Antoinette of France was born Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria). Upon extinction of the male line of the Habsburgs and the marriage of their heiress, the Holy Roman Empress-consort Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary and Archduchess of Austria, to Francis Stephen, Duke of Lorraine, who was elected Holy Roman Emperor, their descendants formed the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire this usage was retained in the Austrian Empire (1804‚Äì1867) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1867‚Äì1918). The official use of titles of nobility and of all other hereditary titles, including Archduke, has been illegal in the Republic of Austria for Austrian citizens since the Law on the Abolition of Nobility (Gesetz vom 3. April 1919 √ºber die Aufhebung des Adels, der weltlichen Ritter- und Damenorden und gewisser Titel und W√ºrden). Thus those members of the Habsburg family who are residents of the Republic of Austria are simply known by their first name(s) and their surname Habsburg- Lothringen. However, members of the family who reside in other countries may or may not use the title, in accordance with laws and customs in those nations. For example, Otto Habsburg-Lothringen (1912‚Äì2011), the eldest son of the last Habsburg Emperor, was an Austrian, Hungarian and German citizen. As he lived in Germany, where it is permitted to use hereditary titles as part of the civil surname (including indications of origin, such as von or zu), his official civil name was Otto von Habsburg (literally: Otto of Habsburg), whereas in Austria he was registered as Otto Habsburg. The King of Spain also bears the nominal title of Archduke of Austria as part of his full list of titles, as the Bourbon dynasty adopted all the titles previously held by the Spanish Habsburgs when they took over the Spanish throne. However, \\"Archduke\\" was never considered by the Spanish Bourbons as a substantial dignity of their own dynasty, but rather as a traditional supplementary title of the Spanish Kings since the days of the Habsburg dynasty on the royal throne (1516‚Äì1700). Hence, no member of the royal family other than the King bears the (additional) title of \\"Archduke\\".

The boatswain supervises the other members of the ship's deck department, and typically is not a watchstander, except on vessels with small crews. Additional duties vary depending upon ship, crew, and circumstances. History Boatswain of the Royal Navy, c. 1820 The word boatswain has been in the English language since approximately 1450. It is derived from late Old English batswegen, from bat (boat) concatenated with Old Norse sveinn (swain), meaning a young man, apprentice, a follower, retainer or servant. Directly translated to modern Norwegian it would be b√•tsvenn, while the actual crew title in Norwegian is b√•tsmann (\\"boats-man\\"). While the phonetic spelling bosun is reported as having been observed since 1868, this latter spelling was used in Shakespeare's The Tempest written in 1611, and as Bos'n in later editions. =Royal Navy= The rank of boatswain is the oldest rank in the Royal Navy, and its origins can be traced back to the year 1040. In that year, when five English ports began furnishing warships to King Edward the Confessor in exchange for certain privileges, they also furnished crews whose officers were the master, boatswain, carpenter and cook. Later these officers were \\"warranted\\" by the British Admiralty. They maintained and sailed the ships and were the standing officers of the navy. The boatswain was the officer responsible for the care of the rigging, cordage, anchors, sails, boats, flags and other stores. The Royal Navy's last official boatswain, Commander E. W. Andrew OBE, retired in 1990. Naval cadets The rank of cadet boatswain, in some schools, is the second highest rank in the combined cadet force naval section that a cadet can attain, below the rank of coxswain and above the rank of leading hand. It is equivalent to the rank of colour sergeant in the army and the royal marines cadets; it is sometimes an appointment for a senior petty officer to assist a coxswain. Job description Boatswain of Felix von Luckners yacht Seeteufel, smoking a pipe and hosing the vessel's deck The boatswain works in a ship's deck department as the foreman of the unlicensed (crew members without a mate's licence) deck crew. Sometimes, the boatswain is also a third or fourth mate. A boatswain must be highly skilled in all matters of marlinespike seamanship required for working on deck of a seagoing vessel. The boatswain is distinguished from other able seamen by the supervisory roles: planning, scheduling, and assigning work. As deck crew foreman, the boatswain plans the day's work and assigns tasks to the deck crew. As work is completed, the boatswain checks on completed work for compliance with approved operating procedures.Oregon University System, 2004 Outside the supervisory role, the boatswain regularly inspects the vessel and performs a variety of routine, skilled, and semi-skilled duties to maintain all areas of the ship not maintained by the engine department. These duties can include cleaning, painting, and maintaining the vessel's hull, superstructure and deck equipment as well as executing a formal preventive maintenance program. A boatswain's skills may include cargo rigging, winch operations, deck maintenance, working aloft, and other duties required during deck operations. The boatswain is well versed in the care and handling of lines, and has knowledge of knots, hitches, bends, whipping, and splices as needed to perform tasks such as mooring a vessel. The boatswain typically operates the ship's windlasses when letting go and heaving up anchors. Moreover, a boatswain may be called upon to lead firefighting efforts or other emergency procedures encountered on board. Effective boatswains are able to integrate their seafarer skills into supervising and communicating with members of deck crew with often diverse backgrounds. Originally, on board sailing ships the boatswain was in charge of a ship's anchors, cordage, colours, deck crew and the ship's boats. The boatswain would also be in charge of the rigging while the ship was in dock. The boatswain's technical tasks were modernised with the advent of steam engines and subsequent mechanisation. A boatswain also is responsible for doing routine pipes using what is called a boatswain's call. There are specific sounds which can be made with the pipe to indicate various events, such as emergency situations or notifications of meal time. A common slang name for this instrument was the pippity dippity.https://www.exploratorium.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/OTW_TH.pdf Notable boatswains A number of boatswains and naval boatswains mates have achieved fame. Reuben James and William Wiley are famous for their heroism in the Barbary Wars and are namesakes of the ships USS Reuben James and USS Wiley. Medal of Honor recipients Francis P. Hammerberg and George Robert Cholister were U.S. Navy boatswain's mates, as was Navy Cross recipient Stephen Bass. Victoria Cross recipients John Sheppard, John Sullivan, Henry Curtis, and John Harrison were Royal Navy boatswain's mates. There are also a handful of boatswains and boatswain's mates in literature. The boatswain in William Shakespeare's The Tempest is a central character in the opening scene, which takes place aboard a ship at sea, and appears again briefly in the final scene. Typhoon by Joseph Conrad has a nameless boatswain who tells Captain MacWhirr of a \\"lump\\" of men going overboard during the peak of the storm. Also, the character Bill Bobstay in Gilbert and Sullivan's musical comedy H.M.S. Pinafore is alternatively referred to as a \\"bos'un\\"See quote from \\"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan\\" at . and a \\"boatswain's mate\\".See quote from S.W. Gilbert in \\"The story of the H.M.S. Pinafore\\" at . Another boatswain from literature is Smee from Peter Pan. Lord Byron had a Newfoundland dog named Boatswain. Byron wrote the famous poem \\"Epitaph to a Dog\\" and had a monument made for him at Newstead Abbey. The 1907 naval gothic novel The Boats of the \\"Glen Carrig\\" by William Hope Hodgson features the character of the ship's ‚Äúbo'sun‚Äù as an important member of the crew and a personal friend to the narrator. Billy was a boatswain in the fictional Starz TV show Black Sails. Scouting Quartermaster is the highest rank in the Sea Scouts, BSA, an older youth (13-21) co-ed programme. The youth can also elect a youth leader, giving that youth the title \\"boatswain\\". In the Netherlands, a boatswain (Bootsman) is the patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Bak), in Flanders it is the assistant patrol leader of a Sea Scout patrol (Kwartier).

born 30 June 1964) is the first wife of Prince Joachim of Denmark, the younger son of Margrethe II of Denmark. She was born in Hong Kong and is of mixed Chinese- European ancestry. She was introduced to Prince Joachim in 1994. They married in 1995 and had two sons together, until the marriage was dissolved in 2005. Early life and family Of English, Chinese, Czech, and Austrian ancestry, Alexandra Manley was born in Hong Kong, as the eldest of three daughters of Richard Nigel Manley (born in Shanghai, China on 11 August 1924 to a father of English and Chinese ancestry, died 12 January 2010, buried 10 February 2010 in Liesing Cemetery, Vienna) and Christa Maria Manley of Czech and Austrian descent (born Christa Maria Nowotny in Austria in 1933). Her father was an insurance company executive and her mother was the manager of a communications company. She was christened at the Cathedral of Saint John, Hong Kong. She attended Quarry Bay Junior School (1969‚Äì1971), Glenealy School (1971‚Äì1974) and Island School (1974‚Äì1982), all in Hong Kong. Manley studied international business at Vienna University of Economics and Business in Austria. She also went to Japan and England for studies. It is not known whether she obtained a university degree. From 1990 to 1995, she was employed by GT Management (Asia) Ltd., Hong Kong, where from 1990 to 1993 she worked in Sales and Marketing and from 1993 as a deputy chief executive of that department. First marriage and children Alexandra met Prince Joachim at a private dinner in Hong Kong in January 1994, where he was working for a Danish shipping company. After a whirlwind courtship, thought to have begun in late 1994, Prince Joachim, on bended knee, presented Alexandra with a diamond and ruby engagement ring while the couple vacationed together in the Philippines. Their engagement, which took both Alexandra's family and Danish royal Watchers by surprise, was officially revealed in May 1995. They were married on 18 November 1995, by Queen Margrethe's Chaplain-in-Ordinary, in the Chapel of Frederiksborg Castle at Hiller√∏d. The wedding festivities were held at Fredensborg Palace. The bride's gown was designed by J√∏rgen Bender; she wore the Alexandrine Drop Tiara, originally the property of Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was a wedding gift from Queen Margrethe. When she married Prince Joachim, she gave up her career in marketing. It is believed that she had renounced her British citizenship prior to become a Danish subject upon her marriage. Prince Joachim and Princess Alexandra have two children from their former marriage: * Prince Nikolai William Alexander Frederik (born 28 August 1999). * Prince Felix Henrik Valdemar Christian (born 22 July 2002). Life as a princess Alexandra became popular with the Danish people. Known for her fashion sense and charity work, she was dubbed the Diana of the North. She is a native English and German speaker (through her father and mother, respectively), and her fluency in German helped her pick up the Danish language quickly. Within a few months she spoke it nearly without accent, which further endeared her to the Danes. As she said in an interview, \\"I don't find the grammar especially difficult, but the pronunciation can be hard, since we swallow some of our words. It reminds me a little of Chinese, with the glottal stop ‚Ä¶ Saying something with an upswing or a downswing can give a word an entirely different meaning,\\" she explained. \\"It was my decision to learn the language immediately. It would have been terrible to have to stand up and speak English at an engagement, or thank someone for something. It would have been utterly wrong. This is my home, and so there was no other option\\". Both during and after her marriage, she was involved in numerous philanthropic pursuits, including the Children's Red Cross, the Danish Society for the Blind, UNICEF, and single mothers' advocacy group Mother Help. She also served as a UNICEF ambassador when she travelled to Thailand to visit HIV/AIDS patients. End of marriage By mid-2004, rumours were circulating throughout Denmark and neighbouring Sweden and Norway that her marriage to Prince Joachim had gone sour. On 16 September 2004, Alexandra and Joachim announced their separation and eventual intention to divorce. It would be the first in the Royal Family since 1846. Newspaper reports speculating on the reasons for the marital rupture soon followed. The Folketing decided to put Alexandra on the civil list for life, independent of her possible future remarriage. Alexandra's payments of her new yearly allowance of 2.1m kroner (US$330,000) started retroactively from 1 October 2004. The couple divorced on 8 April 2005. On 23 June 2017, she announced that she would renounce her entitlement to the Danish civil list in July 2020, coinciding with the 18th birthday of Prince Felix. Second marriage and current life In mid-2005 there were reports and pictures of Alexandra together with Martin J√∏rgensen (b. 2 March 1978 in Valby), the son of Jacob J√∏rgensen. Jacob J√∏rgensen is well known in Denmark for his film production company JJ Film, which produced numerous documentaries in which members of the royal family co-operated and participated. She married Martin J√∏rgensen on 3 March 2007 in a private ceremony at √òster Egede Church near Fakse. In September 2015, it was announced that J√∏rgensen and the Countess were divorcing after eight and a half years of marriage. The Countess had cited differences in values as the reason for the divorce. According to Royal Central, the divorce was finalized in 2015. In 2007 the Countess of Frederiksborg joined the Danish board of directors of Ferring Pharmaceuticals. In 2017, it was announced that she would take up the position of Poling Chair of Business and Government at the Indiana University Kelley School of Business. In August 2017 she attended the 18th birthday party of her son Prince Nikolai along with many members of the royal family, including Queen Margrethe II.

When married together they are known as \\"The Irons\\" A Halligan tool on display at the NYC Fire Museum (middle), next to the earlier Kelly tool (2nd from left) it was based on A Halligan bar, also known as a Halligan tool\\"Forcible Entry Reference Guide - Techniques and Procedures,\\" New York City Fire Department, December 2006, p. 14, accessed June 10, 2017., is a forcible entry tool used by firefighters and law enforcement. History The tool was designed by and named after a New York City Fire Department (FDNY) First Deputy Chief named Hugh Halligan in 1948. Later that year, the first prototype of the Halligan bar was made by blacksmith Peter Clarke. Because the device had been invented by one of its members, the FDNY did not initially purchase the tool in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.Fire Department City of New York: The Bravest; An Illustrated History 1865-2002, page 72. The Boston Fire Department was the first major customer of the Halligan bar, purchasing one for every fire company in the city. The tool was popular enough that members of New York ladder companies began buying it with their own money until the department ultimately decided to purchase the tool, gradually leading to widespread adoption across North America and eventually worldwide. The Halligan bar has become the most versatile hand tool to be used for the past seven decades for a multitude of fireground tasks.Morelock, Jamie. Upgrading the Halligan Bar's Roof Ring. Fire Engineering. Pennwell Corporation. Volume 163, Issue 3. Page 47. 2010. Design and use Based on the earlier Kelly tool, the Halligan is a multipurpose tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It consists of a claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors. Either the adze end or fork end of the tool can be used to break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and doorjamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat- head axe. The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a \\"baseball bat swing\\" to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure to the adze.White, Billy & Johnson, Fergus. The Backup Firefighter's Role in the Initial Fire Attack. Fire Engineering. 2011. Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze (only when properly used) provide protection to the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation.Fisher, Rob. History of the Halligan Bar. Firefighternation. 2007 The Halligan can be used to knock down a wall in a house to get to another area.Equipment Used by Firefighters. ABCO Fire Protection. The Halligan can be used to make a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery.Fritz, Richard. Tools of the Trade: Hand Tools and Their Use. Pennwell Books. 1997. The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilation.Schottke, David. Fundamentals of Firefighter Skills. Jones and Barlett Publishers. 2014 The pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free. It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation. Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled. The fork end is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves. The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication among other things. The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident.Smith, Steve. militarygovernmentcareeres.knojji.com. 2013. The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level.The Art of the Fire Service. Tips From the Bucket. Vententersarch.com The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.Thomas Delmar Learning. The Firefighter's Handbook. Thomas and Delmar Learning. Clifton Park, New York. 2000. One variant of the Halligan has a heavy sliding collar on the shaft. Once the prying end of the tool is wedged into position, the sliding 'hammer' is used to force the wedge, allowing for proper seating before prying. The adze end is also assisted by using the sliding hammer to generate forced traction on a hooked cylinder. Another variant has an end that resembles a lever-type can opener, used for making large holes for access or ventilation in sheet metal. The Halligan is available in a number of lengths ‚Äì typically ‚Äì and of various materials, including titanium, beryllium copper or stainless steel. Carrying straps or rings can be found. The 18-inch Halligan is often referred to as an officer's tool. A Halligan bar and a flathead axe can be joined together (and partially interlocked, head-to-toe) to form what is known as a married set, set of irons or simply The Irons. This combination of tools is most common within the fire service. However, the Halligan may also be married with a Halligan hook or sledgehammer as an alternative.

The siege was the culmination of a series of events that began in December 1910, with an attempted jewellery robbery at Houndsditch in the City of London by a gang of Latvian immigrants which resulted in the murder of three policemen, the wounding of two others, and the death of George Gardstein, the leader of the Latvian gang. An investigation by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, most of whom were arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the last two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for about six hours. Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified. One of the agitators in the building was shot before the fire spread. While the London Fire Brigade were damping down the ruins‚Äîin which they found the two bodies‚Äîthe building collapsed, killing a fireman, Superintendent Charles Pearson. The siege marked the first time the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed stand-off. It was also the first siege in Britain to be caught on camera, as the events were filmed by Path√© News. Some of the footage included images of the Home Secretary, Winston Churchill. His presence caused a political row over the level of his operational involvement. At the trial in May 1911 of those arrested for the Houndsditch jewellery robbery, all but one of the accused were acquitted; the conviction was overturned on appeal. The events were fictionalised in film‚Äîin The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) and The Siege of Sidney Street (1960)‚Äîand novels. On the centenary of the events two tower blocks in Sidney Street were named after Peter the Painter, one of the minor members of the gang who was probably not present at either Houndsditch or Sidney Street. The murdered policemen and the fireman who died are commemorated with memorial plaques. Background =Immigration and demographics in London= 1900 map of Jewish East London. Circled on the left of the map is the location of the Houndsditch murders; circled on the right is the location of 10 Sidney Street. The map is coloured to show the density of Jewish residents in East London: the darker the blue, the higher the Jewish population. In the 19th century, the Russian Empire was home to about five million Jews, the largest Jewish community at the time. Subjected to religious persecution and violent pogroms, many emigrated and between 1875 and 1914 around 120,000 arrived in the United Kingdom, mostly in England. The influx reached its peak in the late 1890s when large numbers of Jewish immigrants‚Äîmostly poor and semi-skilled or unskilled‚Äîsettled in the East End of London. The concentration of Jewish immigrants into some areas was almost 100 per cent of the population, and a study undertaken in 1900 showed that Houndsditch and Whitechapel were both identified as a \\"well-defined intensely Jewish district\\". Some of the expatriates were revolutionaries, many of whom were unable to adapt to life in the politically less oppressive London. The social historian William J. Fishman writes that \\"the ' (crazy) Anarchists were almost accepted as part of the East End landscape\\"; the terms \\"socialist\\" and \\"anarchist\\" had been conflated in the British press, who used the terms interchangeably to refer to those with revolutionary beliefs. A leading article in The Times described the Whitechapel area as one that \\"harbours some of the worst alien anarchists and criminals who seek our too hospitable shore. And these are the men who use the pistol and the knife.\\" From the turn of the century, gang warfare persisted in the Whitechapel and Aldgate areas of London between groups of Bessarabians and refugees from Odessa; various revolutionary factions were active in the area. The Tottenham Outrage of January 1909, by two revolutionary Russians in London‚ÄîPaul Helfeld and Jacob Lepidus‚Äîwas an attempt to rob a payroll van, which left two dead and twenty injured. The event used a tactic often employed by revolutionary groups in Russia: the expropriation or theft of private property to fund radical activities. The influx of √©migr√©s and the increase of violent crime associated with it, led to popular concerns and comments in the press. The government passed the Aliens Act 1905 in an attempt to reduce immigration. The popular press reflected the opinions of many at the time; a leading article in The Manchester Evening Chronicle supported the bill to bar \\"the dirty, destitute, diseased, verminous and criminal foreigner who dumps himself on our soil\\". The journalist Robert Winder, in his examination of migration into Britain, opines that the Act \\"gave official sanction to xenophobic reflexes which might ... have remained dormant\\". =Latvian √©migr√© gang= By 1910 Russian √©migr√©s met regularly at the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many of its members were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian √©migr√© diaspora, most of whom were Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became involved in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists‚Äîalthough anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice. The probable leader of the group was George Gardstein, whose real name was likely to have been Poloski or Poolka; he used the aliases Garstin, Poloski, Poolka, Morountzeff, Mourimitz, Maurivitz, Milowitz, Morintz, Morin and Levi. Gardstein, who probably was an anarchist, had been accused of murder and acts of terrorism in Warsaw in 1905 before his arrival in London. Another member of the group, Jacob (or Yakov) Peters, had been an agitator in Russia while in the army and later as a dockyard worker. He had served a term in prison for his activities and had been tortured by the removal of his fingernails. Yourka Dubof was another Russian agitator who had fled to England after being flogged by Cossacks. Fritz Svaars was a Latvian who had been arrested by the Russian authorities three times for terrorist offences, but escaped each time. He had travelled through the United States, where he undertook a series of robberies, before arriving in London in June 1910. Another member was \\"Peter the Painter\\", a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, in a brief sketch in the Dictionary of National Biography, writes that no firm details are known of the anarchist's background and that \\"None of the ... biographical 'facts' about him ... is altogether reliable.\\" William (or Joseph) Sokoloff (or Sokolow) was a Latvian who had been arrested in Riga in 1905 for murder and robbery before travelling to London. Another of the group's members was Karl Hoffman‚Äîwhose real name was Alfred Dzircol‚Äîwho had been involved in revolutionary and criminal activities for several years, including gun- running. In London he had practised as a decorator. John Rosen‚Äîreal name John Zelin or Tzelin‚Äîcame to London in 1909 from Riga and worked as a barber, while another member of the gang was Max Smoller, also known as Joe Levi and \\"Josepf the Jew\\". He was wanted in his native Crimea for several jewel robberies. =Policing in the capital= Following the Metropolitan Police Act 1829 and the City of London Police Act 1839, the capital was policed by two forces, the Metropolitan Police, who held sway over most of the capital, and the City of London Police, who were responsible for law enforcement within the historic City boundaries. The events in Houndsditch in December 1910 fell into the purview of the City of London service, and the subsequent actions at Sidney Street in January 1911 were in the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan force. Both services came under the political control of the Home Secretary, who in 1911 was the 36-year-old rising politician Winston Churchill. While on the beat, or in the course of their normal duties, the officers of the City of London and Metropolitan forces were provided with a short wooden truncheon for protection. When they faced armed opponents‚Äîas was the case in Sidney Street‚Äîthe police were issued with Webley and Bull Dog revolvers, shotguns and small-bore rifles fitted with .22 Morris-tube barrels, the last of which were more commonly used on small indoor shooting galleries. Houndsditch murders, December 1910 Scene of the robbery, showing a group of policemen in Exchange Buildings, which backs onto the Houndsditch frontage of the shop At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between ¬£20,000 and ¬£30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around ¬£7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills. With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events‚Äîeither as lookouts or in unknown capacities‚Äîwere Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva. On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the shop; number 10 had been unoccupied since 12 December. At around 10:00 that evening, returning to his home at 120 Houndsditch, Max Weil heard curious noises coming from his neighbour's property. Outside his house Weil found Police Constable Piper on his beat and informed him of the noises. Piper checked at 118 and 121 Houndsditch, where he could hear the noise, which he thought was unusual enough to investigate further. At 11:00 he knocked at the door of 11 Exchange Buildings‚Äîthe only property with a light on in the back. The door was opened in a furtive manner and Piper became suspicious immediately. So as not to rouse the man's concerns, Piper asked him \\"is the missus in?\\" The man answered in broken English that she was out, and the policeman said he would return later. Sergeants Tucker and Bentley and Constable Choate, murdered while on duty on 16 December 1910 Piper reported that as he was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously in the shadows of the cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats‚Äîconstables Woodhams and Choate‚Äîwho watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his trouser legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck‚Äîthe second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries. As the gang exited the property and made to escape up the cul-de- sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape who was able to provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of three men and a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Golding Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man was the one who had killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest. Other policemen arrived in Houndsditch, and began to attend to the wounded. Tucker's body was put into a taxi and he was taken to the London Hospital (now the Royal London Hospital) in Whitechapel Road. Choate was also taken there, where he was operated on, but he died at 5:30am on 17 December. Bentley was taken to St Bartholomew's Hospital. He was half-conscious on arrival, but recovered enough to be able to have a conversation with his pregnant wife and answer questions about the events. At 6:45pm on 17 December his condition worsened, and he died at 7:30. The killings of Tucker, Bentley and Choate remain one of the largest multiple murders of police officers carried out in Britain in peacetime. Investigation, 17 December 1910 ‚Äì 2 January 1911 Police finding Gardstein's body, as seen in The Illustrated Police News The City of London police informed the Metropolitan force, as their protocol demanded, and both services issued revolvers to the detectives involved in the search. The subsequent investigation was challenging for the police because of the cultural differences between the British police and the largely foreign residents of the area covered by the search. The police did not have any Russian, Latvian or Yiddish speakers on the force. In the early hours of the morning of 17 December Milstein and Trassjonsky became increasingly concerned as Gardstein's condition worsened, and they sent for a local doctor, explaining that their patient had been wounded accidentally by a friend. The doctor thought the bullet was still in the chest‚Äîit was later found to be touching the right ventricle of the heart. The doctor wanted to take Gardstein to the London Hospital, but he refused; with no other course open to him, the doctor sold them pain medication and left. The Russian was dead by 9:00 that morning. The doctor returned at 11:00am and found the body. He had not heard of the events at Exchange Buildings the night before, and so reported the death to the coroner, not the police. At midday the coroner reported the death to the local police who, led by Divisional Detective Inspector Frederick Wensley, went to Grove Street and discovered the corpse. Trassjonsky was in the next room when they entered, and she was soon found by the police, hastily burning papers; she was arrested and taken to the police headquarters at Old Jewry. Many of the papers recovered linked the suspects to the East End, particularly to the anarchist groups active in the area. Wensley, who had extensive knowledge of the Whitechapel area, subsequently acted as a liaison officer to the City of London force throughout the investigation. Gardstein's body was removed to a local mortuary where his face was cleaned, his hair brushed, his eyes opened and his photograph taken. The picture, and descriptions of those who had helped Gardstein escape from Exchange Buildings, were distributed on posters in English and Russian, asking locals for information. About 90 detectives vigorously searched the East End, spreading details of those they were looking for. A local landlord, Isaac Gordon, reported one of his lodgers, Nina Vassilleva, after she had told him she had been one of the people living at Exchange Buildings. Wensley questioned the woman, finding anarchist publications in her rooms, along with a photograph of Gardstein. Information began to come in from the public and the group's associates: on 18 December Federoff was arrested at home, and on 22 December Dubof and Peters were both captured. Memorial service St Paul's Cathedral for Tucker, Bentley and Choate, 23 December 1910 On 22 December a public memorial service took place for Tucker, Bentley and Choate at St Paul's Cathedral. King George V was represented by Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed. Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein. It was also ascertained that Federoff had been witnessed at the events. The following day Federoff, Peters and Dubof all appeared at the Guildhall police court where they were charged with being connected to the murder of the three policemen, and with conspiracy to burgle the jewellery shop. All three pleaded not guilty. On 27 December the poster bearing Gardstein's picture was seen by his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false passports and revolutionary publications. Two days later there was another hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At the end of the day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911. On New Year's Day 1911 the body of L√©on Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had been badly beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became connected in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at the time for the link was scant. The historian F G Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because he was one of the informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists. The posters of Gardstein proved effective, and late on New Year's Day a member of the public came forward to provide information about Svaars and Sokoloff. The informant told police that the men were hiding at 100 Sidney Street, along with a lodger, Betty Gershon, who was Sokoloff's mistress. The informant was persuaded to visit the property the following day to confirm the two men were still present. A meeting took place on the afternoon of 2 January to decide the next steps. Wensley, high-ranking members of the Metropolitan force and Sir William Nott-Bower, the Commissioner of the City Police, were present. Events of 3 January The Illustrated London News caption reads: \\"Scots Guards on active service in Sidney Street: Two of the men firing from a bedroom opposite the besieged house.\\" Just after midnight on 3 January, 200 police officers from the City of London and Metropolitan forces cordoned off the area around 100 Sidney Street. Armed officers were placed at number 111, directly opposite number 100, and throughout the night the residents of the houses on the block were roused and evacuated. Wensley woke the ground floor tenants at number 100 and asked them to fetch Gershon, claiming that she was needed by her sick husband. When Gershon appeared she was grabbed by the police and taken to the City of London police headquarters; the ground floor lodgers also evacuated. Number 100 was now empty of all residents, apart from Svaars and Sokoloff, neither of whom seemed to be aware of the evacuation. The police's operating procedure‚Äîand the law which governed their actions‚Äîmeant they were unable to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff. By 9:00am it was apparent that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It was the first time that the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty- one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each end of the street and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage. Churchill observing the events at Sidney Street Churchill arrived on the scene at 11:50am to observe the incident at first hand; he later reported that he thought the crowd were unwelcoming to him, as he heard people asking \\"Oo let 'em in?\\", in reference to the Liberal Party's immigration policy that had allowed the influx from Russia. Churchill's role during the siege is unclear. His biographers, Paul Addison and Roy Jenkins, both consider that he gave no operational commands to the police, but a Metropolitan police history of the event states that the events of Sidney Street were \\"a very rare case of a Home Secretary taking police operational command decisions\\". In a subsequent letter to The Times, Churchill clarified his role while he was present: > I did not interfere in any way with the dispositions made by the police > authorities on the spot. I never overruled those authorities nor overrode > them. From beginning to end the police had an absolutely free hand. ... I > did not send for the Artillery or the Engineers. I was not consulted as to > whether they should be sent for. Shooting between the two sides reached a peak between 12:00 and 12:30pm, but at 12:50 smoke was seen coming from the building's chimneys and from the second floor windows; it has not been established how the fire was started, whether by accident or design. The fire slowly spread, and by 1:30 it had taken a firm hold and had spread to the other floors. A second detachment of Scots Guards arrived, bringing with them a Maxim machine gun, which was never used. Shortly afterwards Sokoloff put his head out of the window; he was shot by one of the soldiers and he fell back inside. The senior officer of the London Fire Brigade present on the scene sought permission to extinguish the blaze, but was refused. He approached Churchill in order to have the decision overturned, but the Home Secretary approved the police decision. Churchill later wrote: Firemen tackle the fire at 100 Sidney Street after the end of the siege > I now intervened to settle this dispute, at one moment quite heated. I told > the fire-brigade officer on my authority as Home Secretary that the house > was to be allowed to burn down and that he was to stand by in readiness to > prevent the conflagration from spreading. By 2:30pm the shooting from the house had ceased. One of the detectives present walked close to the wall and pushed the door open, before retreating. Other police officers, and some of the soldiers, came out and waited for the men to exit. None did, and as part of the roof collapsed, it was clear to onlookers that the men were both dead; the fire brigade was allowed to start extinguishing the fire. At 2:40 Churchill left the scene, at about the time the Royal Horse Artillery arrived with two 13-pounder field artillery pieces. When the firemen entered the property to douse the flames, they soon located Sokoloff's body, which was extracted. A wall collapsed on a group of five firemen, who were all taken to the London Hospital. One of the men, Superintendent Charles Pearson, had a fractured spine; he died six months after the siege as a result of his injuries. After shoring up the building, the firemen resumed their search of the premises. At around 6:30pm the second body‚Äîthat of Svaars‚Äîwas found; it was taken to the mortuary. Aftermath Detectives inspect the house at 100 Sidney Street at the conclusion of the siege The siege was captured by Path√© News cameras‚Äîone of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film‚Äîand it included footage of Churchill. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of \\"shoot him\\" from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, \\"He [Churchill] was, I understand, in military phrase, in what is known as the zone of fire‚Äîhe and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I understand what the photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now.\\" Jenkins suggests that he went simply because \\"he could not resist going to see the fun himself\\". An inquest was held in January into the deaths at Houndsditch and Sidney Street. The jury took fifteen minutes to reach the conclusion that the two bodies located were those of Svaars and Sokoloff, that Tucker, Bentley and Choate had been murdered by Gardstein and others during the burglary attempt. Rosen was arrested on 2 February at work in Well Street, Hackney, and Hoffman was taken into custody on 15 February. The committal proceedings spread from December 1910‚Äîwith Milstein and Trassjonsky appearing‚Äîto March 1911, and included Hoffman from 15 February. The proceedings consisted of 24 individual hearings. In February Milstein was discharged on the basis that there was insufficient evidence against her; Hoffman, Trassjonsky and Federoff were released in March on the same basis. The case against the four remaining arrested gang members was heard at the Old Bailey by Mr Justice Grantham in May. Dubof and Peters were accused of Tucker's murder, Dubof, Peters, Rosen and Vassilleva were charged with \\"feloniously harbouring a felon guilty of murder\\" and for \\"conspiring and agreeing together and with others unknown to break and enter the shop of Henry Samuel Harris with intent to steal his goods\\". The case lasted for eleven days; there were problems with the proceedings because of the language difficulties and the chaotic personal lives of the accused. The case resulted in acquittals for all except Vassilleva, who was convicted of conspiracy in the burglary and sentenced to two years' imprisonment; her conviction was overturned on appeal. After the high levels of criticism aimed at the Aliens Act, Churchill decided to strengthen the legislation, and proposed the Aliens (Prevention of Crime) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The MP Josiah C Wedgwood objected, and wrote to Churchill to ask him not to introduce the hard-line measures \\"You know as well as I do that human life does not matter a rap in comparison with the death of ideas and the betrayal of English traditions.\\" The bill did not become law. Legacy The inadequacy of the police's firepower led to criticism in the press, and on 12 January 1911 several alternative weapons were tested. The trials resulted in the Metropolitan Police replacing the Webley revolver with the Webley & Scott .32 calibre MP semi-automatic pistol later that year; the City of London Police adopted the weapon in 1912. The members of the group dispersed after the events. Peter the Painter was never seen or heard from again. It was assumed he left the country, and there were several possible sightings in the years afterwards; none were confirmed. Jacob Peters returned to Russia, rose to be deputy head of the Cheka, the Soviet secret police, and was executed in Joseph Stalin's 1938 purge. Trassjonsky had a mental breakdown and was confined for a time at Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum. Her eventual fate and date of death are unknown. Dubof, Federoff and Hoffmann disappeared from the records; Vassilleva remained in the East End for the remainder of her life and died at Brick Lane in 1963. Smoller left the country in 1911 and travelled to Paris, after which he disappeared; Milstein later emigrated to the United States. The siege was the inspiration for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's original 1934 version of The Man Who Knew Too Much; the story was heavily fictionalised in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street. The siege was also the inspiration for two novels, The Siege of Sidney Street (1960) by F Oughton and A Death Out of Season (1973) by Emanuel Litvinoff. In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events and was not present at the siege. The name plaques on the buildings call Peter the Painter an \\"anti-hero\\"; the decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation. A council spokesman said that \\"There is no evidence that Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we knew we were not naming the block after a murderer. ... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street.\\" In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.

Heminges and his sixteen-year-old wife settled in the parish of St Mary Aldermanbury, and had at least thirteen children there between the years 1590 and 1613.

Heminges also built and operated a taphouse at the Globe.. Heminges was mentioned in Shakespeare's will, along with Richard Burbage and Henry Condell, each being bequeathed 26 shillings and eightpence to buy mourning rings. Stanley Wells and others have wondered if that bequest represented a kind of pact for the three men to create and publish an edition of Shakespeare‚Äôs collected plays.Wells, Stanley.

Their editorial efforts were vital to preserving a number of Shakespeare's plays, some of which might have been lost otherwise.Bate, Jonathan.

As a sharer in the Globe Theatre, Heminges‚Äô name, along with the other sharers, is mentioned several times in various legal documents that were discovered by American researcher Charles William Wallace. The Globe was plagued by lawsuits as the shares were left to beneficiaries who did not have the continued welfare of the company at heart. In one such lawsuit, Heminges v. Ostler, Heminges was sued by his daughter, Thomasina Ostler over a share of the company. The surviving records do not specify the final outcome of the suit. At his death, Heminges‚Äô shares in the Globe and Blackfriars theatres passed to his son, William Heminges.Chambers, Vol. 2 , pp. 322‚Äì3. The lawsuit records are valuable to historians for the detailed information they contain regarding the company business.Aaron, Melissa, D.

Oxford University Press Work John Heminges and Henry Condell Memorial in London, commemorating their work with Shakespeare The extent and nature of Heminges' acting is not entirely clear. He is known to have performed in Ben Jonson's Sejanus and Every Man in His Humour (in both cases, alongside Shakespeare). A Jacobean inscription in the 1616 Jonson folio lists him playing the role of Corbaccio in Volpone; since the same list includes Nathan Field, who did not join the King's Men until 1616, it seems that Heminges continued to act, at least intermittently, into his fifties. Edmond Malone reported seeing Heminges' name associated with the role of Falstaff; there is, however, no other evidence of this connection. There is little more evidence to substantiate the claim later made by an actor to Alexander Pope that Heminges was a tragedian. Of his activities as manager more is known. Court documents relating to the King's Men generally list Heminges as the recipient of money due the company; the records of Henry Herbert indicate that Heminges at least sometimes served as the point of contact between the company and the Master of the Revels. He appears to have owned a structure abutting the Globe Theatre, which may have been used as an alehouse. He served as trustee for Shakespeare when the latter purchased a house in Blackfriars in 1613. References Notes * *Pam Hinks.

Greenwood Publishing Group (2006) pp. 129-136 Life and career Condell's early life is obscure. It appears that he may have been from East Anglia, as his will mentions 'my Cosen Gilder late of newe Buckenham‚Äô. According to Edmond: > The only Henry Condell so far discovered at a suitable date in that part of > England was the son of a Robert Condell of St Peter Mancroft, Norwich, a > fishmonger, and his wife, Joan, n√©e Yeomans, of New Buckenham, a market town > not far from Norwich. Henry Condell, presumably their son, was baptized at > St Peter on 5 September 1576. Traditionally, he is associated with the \\"Harry\\" who appears in the cast list for Richard Tarlton's The Seven Deadly Sins, but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in Lord Strange's Men alongside John Heminges and Augustine Phillips. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at St Laurence Pountney, Elizabeth Smart (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, gentleman. They settled in St Mary Aldermanbury, the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as churchwarden in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611). Details of Condell's mature life, as is usual for Renaissance actors, are few. His status within the Lord Chamberlain's and King's companies appears to have been high; in official communications he is generally listed shortly after Burbage and Heminges. Actors' wills indicate that he was close to at least some of his colleagues in the company. Shakespeare and Phillips bequeathed him money for mourning rings; Nicholas Tooley and Alexander Cooke named him as trustee for their estates. Condell prospered enough in his profession to purchase a country home at Fulham in Middlesex and other property, including an estate called Brockhampton in Snowshill, Gloucestershire. The indentures recording the latter purchase contain the only known example of Condell's signature or handwriting apart from his last will. In addition to Every Man in His Humour (1598) and Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), Condell is known to have performed in four more of Jonson's plays: Sejanus (1603), Volpone (1605), The Alchemist (1610), and Catiline (1611). He was the original Cardinal in John Webster's The Duchess of Malfi (c. 1613). And he was listed in eight of the cast lists that were added to the second Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1679: * Bonduca * The Captain * The Humorous Lieutenant * The Knight of Malta * The Loyal Subject * The Mad Lover * The Queen of Corinth * Valentinian John Heminges and Henry Condell Memorial in London, commemorating their work with Shakespeare Condell appears to have ended his stage career around 1619. He signed each of the nine sheets of his last will and testament on 13 December 1627. He died at Fulham aged 51, and was buried at St Mary Aldermanbury on 29 December 1627. His widow, Elizabeth, was buried there on 3 October 1635. Condell left an extensive estate, including shares in the Globe and Blackfriars Theatres. Fictional portrayals In the 2016 sitcom Upstart Crow, Henry Condell is played by Dominic Coleman. Notes References * *Collier, J. P.. Lives of the Original Actors in Shakespeare's Plays.

After supposedly fighting in and escaping the Sidney Street Siege in 1911, he became an anti-hero in London's East End. He was never caught, and there is some question as to whether he had participated in the Sidney Street incident, or even whether he actually existed at all. Biography In the late 19th and early 20th centuries London became a destination for many eastern European immigrants, who settled mostly in the East End. Ethnic groups joined together in gangs, and numerous immigrants continued radical political activities. They often stole in order to fund their politics. In the wake of the Houndsditch Murders in London on 16 December 1910, a member of the gang involved was found dead at a flat at which Peter Piatkow had lived with Fritz Svaars. Both of the latter men were believed to be members of a Latvian radical group. Svaars was the cousin of Jacob Peters, another Latvian far-leftist. In January 1911 the police were informed that Svaars and an accomplice were hiding out at 100 Sidney Street. They surrounded the area and laid siege to the building in order to flush out the radicals. Another member was \\"Peter the Painter\\", a nickname for an unknown figure, possibly named Peter Piaktow (or Piatkov, Pjatkov or Piaktoff), He used several aliases, including Schtern, Straume, Makharov and Dudkin or Janis Zhaklis. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, states that no firm details are known of the anarchist's background and that \\"None of the ... biographical 'facts' about him ... is altogether reliable.\\" In 1988, based on research in the KGB archives, Philip Ruff, a historian of anarchism, suggested Peter the Painter might be ƒ¢ederts Eliass. He was a Latvian artist involved in the 1905 Revolution in Russia and was living in exile in England during the time of the Sidney Street Siege. He returned to Riga after the Bolshevik 1917 Revolution. More recently, Ruff has identified Peter the Painter as JƒÅnis ≈ΩƒÅklis (also spelled Janis Zhaklis or Zhakles), another Latvian far-leftist. Like Peters, Zhaklis was a member of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party in 1905; among his exploits was gaining the escape of Fritz Svaars from prison in Riga. Zhaklis associated with Eliass in exile in Finland, where they were involved together in the robbery of the Russian State Bank branch in Helsinki. Zhaklis broke with the Social Democrats and became an anarchist. It is unclear what happened to him after 1911. In August 2012 Ruff published a book on the life of Janis Zhaklis; it was released by Dienas GrƒÅmata (in Latvian) as Pa stƒÅvu liesmu debesƒ´s: NenotveramƒÅ latvie≈°u anarhista Pƒìtera MƒÅldera laiks un dzƒ´ve (A Towering Flame: The Life & Times of Peter the Painter). This has been succeeded by an English-language edition, published by Breviary Stuff in 2019. Legacy and honours *The type of gun which Peter the Painter allegedly used at Sidney Street, a German Mauser C96 pistol, was sometimes called a Peter the Painter after him, particularly in Ireland during the War of Independence and later.The Independent, 17 February 2004 *In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two tower blocks in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House, even though Peter the Painter was only involved in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege. A local councillor and the Metropolitan Police Federation protested against this, saying that the killer should not be recognised. *The song \\"Peter the Painter\\", by Ian Dury and the Blockheads, is unrelated, referring instead to the artist Peter Blake. In popular culture *Peter the Painter was portrayed by Peter Wyngarde in the 1960 film The Siege of Sidney Street, about the anarchist movement and the police action. *Peter Piatkow aka Peter the Painter is a key character in part of Gavin Lyall's 1993 novel Spy's Honour. In the second part of the novel \\"Climbing Spy Hill\\" he is the leader of a group of Irish fenians attempting to rob the Royal Navy depot at Queenstown port, Ireland. Piatkow is portrayed unsympathetically, planning on killing all the people, including the domestic staff, at the naval commander's residence, and his own confederates, so that he can keep all the proceeds of the robbery for himself. *Peter the Painter is featured as a character in the 4th episode of the Australian murder mysteries series, Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries. In this episode‚Äî\\"Death at Victoria Dock\\", involving the murder of a Latvian anarchist in Melbourne's docks in the mid 1920s‚ÄîPeter is identified to Phryne Fisher in a club as the man involved in the Sidney Street Siege in London. He is a key character in the episode. The original book published by Kerry Greenwood includes an audiobook interview with the author who explains that in earlier original research she interviewed two wharfies who had worked at the Melbourne docks in the 1920s and who confirmed the rumor that Peter the Painter had lived in exile there. *The character Peter the Painter is portrayed by Drago»ô Bucur in the 2012 ITV drama Titanic. Peter is sailing on the ship in an attempt to escape England for the United States. Aboard the ship he has a romantic encounter with the wife of a fellow passenger and murders another when confronted about his identity. He is also central in orchestrating an uprising amongst the 3rd class passengers when they are prevented from boarding the lifeboats. * Peter the Painter is one of the members of the Council of Seven Days (originally from G.K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday) in Kim Newman's graphic novel Anno Dracula: 1895.

Lepontic is an ancient Alpine Celtic language that was spoken in parts of Rhaetia and Cisalpine Gaul (what is now Northern Italy) between 550 and 100 BC. Lepontic is attested in inscriptions found in an area centered on Lugano, Switzerland, and including the Lake Como and Lake Maggiore areas of Italy. Lepontic is a Celtic language.LinguistList: LeponticJohn T. Koch (ed.) Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia ABC-CLIO (2005) While some recent scholarship (e.g. Eska 1998) has tended to consider it simply as an early outlying form of Gaulish and closely akin to other, later attestations of Gaulish in Italy (Cisalpine Gaulish), some scholars (notably Lejeune 1971) continue to view it as a distinct Continental Celtic language.Koch 2006; 1142. Within this latter view, the earlier inscriptions found within a 50 km radius of Lugano are considered Lepontic, while the later ones, to the immediate south of this area, are considered Cisalpine Gaulish. Lepontic was assimilated first by Gaulish, with the settlement of Gaulish tribes north of the River Po, and then by Latin, after the Roman Republic gained control over Gallia Cisalpina during the late 2nd and 1st century BC. Classification Some scholars view (e.g. Lejeune 1971, Koch 2008) Lepontic as a distinct Continental Celtic language. Other scholars (e.g. Evans 1992, Solinas 1995, Eska 1996, McCone 1996, Matasovic 2009) consider it as an early form of Cisalpine Gaulish (or Cisalpine Celtic) and thus a dialect of the Gaulish language. An earlier view, which was prevalent for most of the 20th century and until about 1970, regarded Lepontic as a \\"para-Celtic\\" western Indo-European language, akin to but not part of Celtic, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933 and Pisani 1964). However, Ligurian itself has been considered akin to, but not descended from, Common Celtic, see Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008. Referring to linguistic arguments as well as archaeological evidence, Schumacher even considers Lepontic a primary branch of Celtic, perhaps even the first language to diverge from Proto-Celtic. In any case, the Lepontic inscriptions are the earliest attestation of any form of Celtic. Language =The alphabet= The alphabets of Este (Venetic), Magr√® and Bolzano/Bozen-Sanzeno (Raetic), Sondrio (Camunic), Lugano (Lepontic) The alphabet of Lugano, based on inscriptions found in northern Italy and Canton Ticino, was used to record Lepontic inscriptions, among the oldest testimonies of any Celtic language, in use from the 7th to the 5th centuries BC. The alphabet has 18 letters, derived from the archaic Etruscan alphabet The alphabet does not distinguish voiced and unvoiced occlusives, i.e. P represents /b/ or /p/, T is for /t/ or /d/, and K for /g/ or /k/. Z is probably for /ts/. U /u/ and V /w/ are distinguished. Œò is probably for /t/ and X for /g/. There are claims of a related script discovered in Glozel. Corpus Lepontic is known from around 140 inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano, one of five main Northern Italic alphabets derived from the Etruscan alphabet. Similar scripts were used for writing the Rhaetic and Venetic languages and the Germanic runic alphabets probably derive from a script belonging to this group. The grouping of all inscriptions written in the alphabet of Lugano into a single language is disputed. Indeed, it was not uncommon in antiquity for a given alphabet to be used to write multiple languages. And, in fact, the alphabet of Lugano was used in the coinage of other Alpine tribes, such as the Salassi, Salluvii, and Cavares (Whatmough 1933, Lejeune 1971). While many of the later inscriptions clearly appear to be written in Cisalpine Gaulish, some, including all of the older ones, are said to be in an indigenous language distinct from Gaulish and known as Lepontic. Until the publication of Lejeune 1971, this Lepontic language was regarded as a pre-Celtic language, possibly related to Ligurian (Whatmough 1933, Pisani 1964). Following Lejeune 1971, the consensus view became that Lepontic should be classified as a Celtic language, albeit possibly as divergent as Celtiberian, and in any case quite distinct from Cisalpine Gaulish (Lejeune 1971, Kruta 1991, Stifter 2008). Some have gone further, considering Lepontic and Cisalpine Gaulish essentially one and the same (Eska 1998). However, an analysis of the geographic distribution of the inscriptions shows that the Cisalpine Gaulish inscriptions are later and from an area to the south of the earlier (Lepontic) inscriptions, with which they display significant differences as well as similarities. While the language is named after the tribe of the Lepontii, which occupied portions of ancient Rhaetia, specifically an Alpine area straddling modern Switzerland and Italy and bordering Cisalpine Gaul, the term is currently used by some Celticists (e.g. Eska 1998) to apply to all Celtic dialects of ancient Italy. This usage is disputed by those who continue to view the Lepontii as one of several indigenous pre-Roman tribes of the Alps, quite distinct from the Gauls who invaded the plains of Northern Italy in historical times. The older Lepontic inscriptions date back to before the 5th century BC, the item from Castelletto Ticino being dated at the 6th century BC and that from Sesto Calende possibly being from the 7th century BC (Prosdocimi, 1991). The people who made these inscriptions are nowadays identified with the Golasecca culture, a Celtic culture in northern Italy (De Marinis 1991, Kruta 1991 and Stifter 2008). The extinction date for Lepontic is only inferred by the absence of later inscriptions. Texts Lepontic alphabet See also * Cisalpine Celtic * Glozel tablets References Sources * De Marinis, R.C.

For active tuberculosis it is often used together with rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and either streptomycin or ethambutol. For latent tuberculosis it is often used by itself. It may also be used for atypical types of mycobacteria, such as M. avium, M. kansasii, and M. xenopi. It is usually taken by mouth but may be used by injection into muscle. Common side effect include increased blood levels of liver enzymes and numbness in the hands and feet. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and acute liver failure. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Use during breastfeeding is likely safe. Pyridoxine may be given to reduce the risk of side effects. Isoniazid works in part by disrupting the formation of the bacteria's cell wall which results in cell death. Isoniazid was first made in 1952. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization classifies isoniazid as critically important for human medicine. Isoniazid is available as a generic medication. Medical uses =Tuberculosis= Isoniazid is often used to treat latent and active tuberculosis infections. In persons with isoniazid-sensitive Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid are usually effective when persons adhere to the prescribed treatment. However, in persons with isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, drug regimens based on isoniazid have a high rate of failure. Isoniazid has been approved as prophylactic therapy for the following populations: * People with HIV infection and a PPD (purified protein derivative) reaction of at least 5 mm induration * Contacts of people with tuberculosis and who have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration * People whose PPD reactions convert from negative to positive in a two-year period ‚Äì at least 10 mm induration for those up to 35 years of age, and at least 15 mm induration for those at least 35 years old * People with pulmonary damage on their chest X-ray that is likely to be due to healed tuberculosis and also have a PPD reaction at least 5 mm induration * Injection drug users whose HIV status is negative who have a PPD reaction at least 10 mm induration * People with a PPD of greater than or equal to 10 mm induration who are foreign-born from high prevalence geographical regions, low-income populations, and patients residing in long-term facilities Isoniazid can be used alone or in combination with Rifampin for treatment of latent tuberculosis, or as part of a four-drug regimen for treatment of active tuberculosis. The drug regimen typically requires daily or weekly oral administration for a period of three to nine months, often under Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) supervision. =Non-tuberculous mycobacteria= Isoniazid was widely used in the treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex as part of a regimen including rifampicin and ethambutol. Evidence suggests that isoniazid prevents mycolic acid synthesis in M. avium complex as in M. tuberculosis and although this is not bactericidal to M. avium complex, it greatly potentiates the effect of rifampicin. The introduction of macrolides led to this use greatly decreasing. However, since rifampicin is broadly underdosed in M. avium complex treatment this effect may be worth re- investigating. =Special populations= It is recommended that women with active tuberculosis who are pregnant or breastfeeding take isoniazid. Preventive therapy should be delayed until after giving birth. Nursing mothers excrete a relatively low and non-toxic concentration of INH in breast milk, and their babies are at low risk for side effects. Both pregnant women and infants being breastfed by mothers taking INH should take vitamin B6 in its pyridoxine form to minimize the risk of peripheral nerve damage. Vitamin B6 is used to prevent isoniazid-induced B6 deficiency and neuropathy in people with a risk factor, such as pregnancy, lactation, HIV infection, alcoholism, diabetes, kidney failure, or malnutrition. People with liver dysfunction are at a higher risk for hepatitis caused by INH, and may need a lower dose. Levels of liver enzymes in the bloodstream should be frequently checked in daily alcohol drinkers, pregnant women, IV drug users, people over 35, and those who have chronic liver disease, severe kidney dysfunction, peripheral neuropathy, or HIV infection since they are more likely to develop hepatitis from INH. Side effects Up to 20% of people taking isoniazid experience peripheral neuropathy when taking doses of 6 mg/kg of weight daily or higher. Gastrointestinal reactions include nausea and vomiting. Aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and agranulocytosis due to lack of production of red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells by the bone marrow respectively, can also occur. Hypersensitivity reactions are also common and can present with a maculopapular rash and fever. Gynecomastia may occur. Asymptomatic elevation of serum liver enzyme concentrations occurs in 10% to 20% of people taking INH, and liver enzyme concentrations usually return to normal even when treatment is continued. Isoniazid has a boxed warning for severe and sometimes fatal hepatitis, which is age-dependent at a rate of 0.3% in people 21 to 35 years old and over 2% in those over age 50.Trevor, A. & Katzung, B. (2013). Katzung & Trevor's Pharmacology: examination & board review (10th ed., p. 417). New York. McGraw-Hill Medical, Lange. Symptoms suggestive of liver toxicity include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, right upper quadrant pain, and loss of appetite. Black and Hispanic women are at higher risk for isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity. When it happens, isoniazid-induced liver toxicity has been shown to occur in 50% of patients within the first 2 months of therapy. Some recommend that liver function should be monitored carefully in all people receiving it, but others recommend monitoring only in certain populations. Headache, poor concentration, weight gain, poor memory, insomnia, and depression have all been associated with isoniazid use. All patients and healthcare workers should be aware of these serious side effects, especially if suicidal ideation or behavior are suspected. Isoniazid is associated with pyridoxine (vitamin B6) deficiency because of its similar structure. Isoniazid is also associated with increased excretion of pyridoxine. Pyridoxal phosphate (a derivative of pyridoxine) is required for Œ¥-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in heme synthesis. Therefore, isoniazid-induced pyridoxine deficiency causes insufficient heme formation in early red blood cells, leading to sideroblastic anemia. Drug interactions People taking isoniazid and acetaminophen are at risk of acetaminophen toxicity. Isoniazid is thought to induce a liver enzyme which causes a larger amount of acetaminophen to be metabolized to a toxic form. Isoniazid decreases the metabolism of carbamazepine, thus slowing down its clearance from the body. People taking carbamazepine should have their carbamazepine levels monitored and, if necessary, have their dose adjusted accordingly. It is possible that isoniazid may decrease the serum levels of ketoconazole after long-term treatment. This is seen with the simultaneous use of rifampin, isoniazid, and ketoconazole. Isoniazid may increase the amount of phenytoin in the body. The doses of phenytoin may need to be adjusted when given with isoniazid. Isoniazid may increase the plasma levels of theophylline. There are some cases of theophylline slowing down isoniazid elimination. Both theophylline and isoniazid levels should be monitored. Valproate levels may increase when taken with isoniazid. Valproate levels should be monitored and its dose adjusted if necessary. Mechanism of action Isoniazid is a prodrug that inhibits the formation of the mycobacterial cell wall. Isoniazid must be activated by KatG, a bacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. KatG catalyzes the formation of the isonicotinic acyl radical, which spontaneously couples with NADH to form the nicotinoyl-NAD adduct. This complex binds tightly to the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, thereby blocking the natural enoyl-AcpM substrate and the action of fatty acid synthase. This process inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids, which are required components of the mycobacterial cell wall. A range of radicals are produced by KatG activation of isoniazid, including nitric oxide, which has also been shown to be important in the action of another antimycobacterial prodrug pretomanid. 500px Isoniazid is bactericidal to rapidly dividing mycobacteria, but is bacteriostatic if the mycobacteria are slow-growing. It inhibits the cytochrome P450 system and hence acts as a source of free radicals. Isoniazid is a mild monoamine oxidase inhibitor(MAO-I). Metabolism Isoniazid reaches therapeutic concentrations in serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and within caseous granulomas. It is metabolized in the liver via acetylation into acetylhydrazine. Two forms of the enzyme are responsible for acetylation, so some patients metabolize the drug more quickly than others. Hence, the half- life is bimodal, with \\"slow acetylators\\" and \\"fast acetylators\\". A graph of number of people versus time shows peaks at one and three hours. The height of the peaks depends on the ethnicities of the people being tested. The metabolites are excreted in the urine. Doses do not usually have to be adjusted in case of renal failure. History First synthesis was described in 1912. A. Kachugin invented the drug against tuberculosis under name Tubazid. Three pharmaceutical companies unsuccessfully attempted to patent the drug at the same time, the most prominent one being Roche, which launched its version, Rimifon, in 1952. With the introduction of isoniazid, a cure for tuberculosis was first considered possible. The drug was first tested at Many Farms, a Navajo community in Arizona, due to the Navajo reservation's tuberculosis problem and because the population had not previously been treated with streptomycin, the main tuberculosis treatment at the time. The research was led by Walsh McDermott, an infectious disease researcher with an interest in public health, who had previously taken isoniazid to treat his own tuberculosis. Isoniazid and a related drug, iproniazid, were among the first drugs to be referred to as antidepressants. Preparation Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid derivative. It is manufactured using 4-cyanopyridine and hydrazine hydrate. In another method, isoniazid was claimed to have been made from citric acid starting material. Brand names Hydra, Hyzyd, Isovit, Laniazid, Nydrazid, Rimifon, and Stanozide. Other uses =Chromatography= Isonicotinic acid hydrazide is also used in chromatography to differentiate between various degrees of conjugation in organic compounds barring the ketone functional group. The test works by forming a hydrazone which can be detected by its bathochromic shift. =Dogs= Isoniazid may be used for dogs, but there have been concerns it can cause seizures.

Within the park are over 25 miles of hiking trails, rock formations, waterfalls, and recess caves. The trails are open from dawn to dusk, all year round including holidays. The park contains seven separate hiking areas: Ash Cave, Cantwell Cliffs, Cedar Falls, Conkle's Hollow (nature preserve), Old Man's Cave, Rock House and Hemlock Bridge Trail to Whispering Cave. History The name Hocking Hills Hocking County was named after the Hockhocking River. Hockhocking, in the Delaware tongue, signifies a bottle. In Shawnee, Wea-tha-Kagh-Qua-sepe, meant bottle river. The Hockhocking River had a waterfall of nearly 20 feet located about 6 or 7 miles northwest of Lancaster. Above the falls, the creek was very narrow and straight, forming the \\"bottle\\" neck. The Hockhocking enters the county from Good Hope Township in the northwest and then flows southwest, touches Marion Township, continues through Falls and Green Townships, and exits the county through northwestern Starr Township. The river is then in Athens County. History: The Adena culture is believed to be one of the first inhabitants of the area of Hocking Hills 1700s - Native American Tribes of Delaware, Wyandot, and Shawnee travelled through and lived in the area 1818 - Hocking County created in Ohio 1830s - Powder mill was built 1840 - Hocking Canal was completed allowing for more settlers to travel there 1924 - After local popular hiking areas were threatened by the accessibility of more traffic, the State Forest Law was passed in 1915 allowing the state to purchase the first parcel of land in Hocking Hills around Old Man's Cave. Old Man's Cave History of the Park More than 330 million years ago, the Hocking Hills State Park area was relatively level and was covered by the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. For millions of years, the ocean's currents deposited immense amounts of sand and gravel. After millions of years, the ocean receded, and the sandy layers bonded with silica to form the Black Hand Sandstone that underlies the area. It formed like a sandwich, with a hard top and bottom and a soft middle layer. When the Appalachian Mountains arose, form and feature were cast upon the area and created Hocking Hills State Park. Hocking Hills State Park was hemmed in by the ancient north-flowing Teahs River to the west, and the then north-flowing Hocking to the east. The landscape remained fairly static for millions of years. Any changes were minuscule, and were slow to develop. When the Wisconsin Glacier began melting back to the north about 10,000 years ago, the landscape would undergo dramatic changes. The glacier stopped in northern Hocking County, so the area suffered indescribable flooding. The ancient Teahs River was buried under tons of glacial silt, and the direction of the Hocking River was reversed. When the glacial torrents found cracks in the hard capstone, the water poured through to flush out the soft middle layer. This left long tunnels where the gorges are today. Eventually, the weight of the tops caused them to come crashing down. The \\"slump rocks\\" in the gorges today are what's left of the hard top layer. In just a few centuries, the rushing waters of the glacier carved the soft middle layer of sandstone into the myriad dimples and wrinkles that decorate the cliffs and grottos today. Early settlers in Muskingum County found an ancient black human handprint on a cliff that is part of this same sandstone formation. That is the same \\"Black Hand Sandstone\\" that is seen in six areas of the Hocking Hills State Park. Tourist accommodations There are about 200 campsites in the park, most equipped with electricity. The campground is close to all of the hiking trails in the area and has flush toilets, shower houses with hot water, vending machines, a camp store, a pool, and other amenities. The area also has many cabins and hotels in this area. In 2017, over 2 million people visited Hocking Hills. To handle the growing tourism, a summer shuttle service from Downtown Logan began to lessen the overtaxing on the park's parking facilities. The Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR) broke ground on a new visitors' center. The $6 million project is scheduled to be completed in December 2018. Attractions The Ash Cave complex The area is very popular with tourists and collectively is known as the Hocking Hills Region. It features many private inns, campgrounds, cabins, restaurants, and other related businesses, including a recently developed zipline. Other attractions include: *Nature Preserves and State Parks: Nearby are also other attractions of the Hocking Hills, including Hocking State Forest, Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve. The deep gorges and high cliffs result from the erosion-resistant Blackhand Sandstone, which extends well to the northeast of the Hocking Hills. Other open-space areas have been established within the range of the Blackhand, including Lake Katharine State Nature Preserve. * Lakes: Lake Logan in Hocking Hills State Park covers 400 acres, 320 acres of which is dry land, and is two miles long.

Many of the adventures in Jeff Smith's comic book series Bone take place in Old Man's Cave, a place inspired by the Hocking Hills State Park, which Smith enjoyed since he was a child. The waterfalls of the park also influenced Smith's frequent use of water as a recurring visual element in Bone, calling it \\"an age-old storytelling symbol\\". Other public lands View inside Rock House. As noted, Hocking Hills State Park is embedded within the Hocking State Forest. Crane Hollow Nature Preserve, a private preserve, fills in a large part of the non-public area. On the south side, Camp Oti-Okwa, owned by Big Brothers-Big Sisters, is also a sizeable protected area. There are three state nature preserves within the Forest, but only Conkles Hollow State Nature Preserve is open to the public. Also nearby are Clear Creek Metro Park, Lake Logan State Park, and Rockbridge State Nature Preserve.

The word Zeus was dropped before the band started recording, as the members decided it was too long to look good on a T-shirt. There were a few personnel changes in the early days, but since 1986 the lineup has remained relatively stable (with only the drummer changing several times since then) and the band were still active as of 2020. History The band were active in the progressive rock revival spearheaded by the likes of Marillion, Pallas, Solstice and Twelfth Night in the early 1980s, and indeed (like their peers IQ) often appeared as support acts to Marillion and other major neo-prog bands, both on tours and at the Marquee venue which hosted many regular prog evenings. After their debut album The Jewel, the band pursued a more commercial direction, documented in the Kowtow album and the Red Shoes and Saved By You EPs, but despite these efforts failed to break through to a mainstream audience. The group appeared at the 1983 Reading Festival and were signed to Elusive Records. In 1991, the band established their own label, Toff Records, and released the archival release The Rest of Pendragon, a collection of EP tracks, and the studio album The World, in which they returned to a more progressive style that the band would continue to develop over their next three studio albums, The Window of Life, The Masquerade Overture, and Not Of This World. From this point on their fortunes have improved, and while they are still relatively obscure in their home country they have a significant following in Europe; in particular, they have managed to develop a strong fanbase in Poland, and have both released at least one compilation specifically for the Polish market and recorded several live albums there. In 2002, the band released Acoustically Challenged, documenting an \\"unplugged\\" session with a number of the band's songs retooled for acoustic instruments, which was originally broadcast on Radio 3 Warsaw. This was considered an unusual move for a progressive rock band, since progressive rock tends to focus a lot on the use of electronic synthesisers and electric guitars; however, the melodic qualities of the band's compositions proved to be well- suited to an acoustic context, and the album was reasonably successful. This heralded a new willingness to experiment on the part of the band, following a run of studio albums all broadly in the same vein as The World. On 2005's Believe they took their music in a somewhat darker direction, causing a certain amount of controversy amongst their fans. 2008's Pure, which featured elements of progressive metal, refined the style of Believe and was well received by the progressive rock fandom, being voted Album of the Year 2008 on DPRP. On the community website progarchives.com Pure enjoyed the current \\"most popular album\\" spot for a period in 2008, and remains in the site's top 10 prog releases of 2008 (as voted by site users). On 21 April 2009, Pendragon released a live album and DVD, Concerto Maximo, shot in Katowice on 13 October 2008. It was filmed and edited by Metal Mind. It was released in several versions - a 2-CD release that features just the audio from the show, a DVD featuring the full show, and a DVD-and-2-CD special edition, which was limited to 1000 copies. In October 2010, the band recorded the follow-up to Pure, the album Passion which was released in the spring of 2011. This was followed by Men Who Climb Mountains in 2014. Both albums continued the darker, heavier, more progressive metal-influenced direction of the band. In April 2014, the band announced that they had parted ways with drummer Scott Higham for \\"personal reasons\\". He was then replaced by Craig Blundell. In June 2015, Blundell was replaced by Jan-Vincent Velazco. In September 2019 the band released a 40th Anniversary boxed set containing five compact discs. The first three represent a complete live concert recording made in London during 2018. The remaining two discs are re-mixed and remastered versions of the albums The World and Men Who Climb Mountains. In February 2020, a new album called Love Over Fear was released.

The battle was fought between the defending forces of the Habsburg Monarchy under the leadership of Nikola IV Zrinski (, ), former Ban of Croatia, and the invading Ottoman army under the nominal command of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent ( S√ºleymƒÅn). After the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, Ferdinand I was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia. This was followed by a series of conflicts with the Habsburgs and their allies, fighting against the Ottoman Empire. In the Little War in Hungary both sides exhausted themselves after sustaining heavy casualties. The Ottoman campaign in Hungary ceased until the offensive against Szigetv√°r. In January 1566 Suleiman went to war for the last time. The siege of Szigetv√°r was fought from 5 August to 8 September 1566 and, though it resulted in an Ottoman victory, there were heavy losses on both sides. Both commanders died during the battle‚ÄîZrinski in the final charge and Suleiman in his tent from natural causes.It is generally accepted that Suleiman died in his tent behind the siege lines from natural causes, before the Turks achieved victory. According to George F. Nafziger, Suleiman died of a heart attack when learned of his victory. According to Stephen Turnbull, several contemporary accounts, such as the ones used later by Nicholas VII Zrinski for his epic, attribute Suleiman's death to Zrinski's hand. More than 20,000 Ottomans had fallen during the attacks and almost all of Zrinski's 2,300-man garrison was killed, with most of the final 600 men killed on the last day.Lieber (1845), p. 345. Although the battle was an Ottoman victory, it stopped the Ottoman push to Vienna that year. Vienna was not threatened again until the Battle of Vienna in 1683. The importance of the battle was considered so great that the French clergyman and statesman Cardinal Richelieu was reported to have described it as \\"the battle that saved (Western) civilization\\". The battle is still famous in Croatia and Hungary and inspired both the Hungarian epic poem The Siege of Sziget and the Croatian opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski.Cornis-Pope and Neubauer (2004), pp. 518‚Äì522. Background Artistic impression of Szigetv√°r by Daniel Meisner and Eberhard Kieser, 1625 On 29 August 1526 the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary led by King Louis II were defeated at the Battle of Moh√°cs by Ottoman forces led by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent.Turnbull (2003), p. 49 Louis died in the battle which resulted in the end of the independent Kingdom of Hungary, as he died without an heir. Both Hungary and Croatia became disputed territories with claims from both the Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Ferdinand I from the House of Habsburg, brother of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, married the sister of Louis IITurnbull (2003), pp. 49‚Äì51. and was elected King by the nobles of both Hungary and Croatia.Corvisier and Childs (1994), p. 289Milan Kruhek: Cetin, grad izbornog sabora Kraljevine Hrvatske 1527, Karlovaƒçka ≈Ωupanija, 1997, Karlovac The throne of Hungary became the subject of a dynastic dispute between Ferdinand and John Z√°polya from Transylvania. Suleiman had promised to make Z√°polya the ruler of all Hungary.Turnbull (2003), pp. 55‚Äì56. Ferdinand set out to enforce his claim on Hungary and captured Buda from John Z√°polya in 1527, only to relinquish his hold on it in 1529 when an Ottoman counter-attack stripped Ferdinand of all his territorial gains during 1527 and 1528. The Siege of Vienna in 1529 was the first attempt by Suleiman the Magnificent to capture the Austrian capital. This siege signalled the pinnacle of Ottoman power and the maximum extent of Ottoman expansion in central Europe. =Little War= Artistic impression of the battle of Szigetv√°r by Antonio Lafreri, 1566 The years from 1529 to 1552 were known as the \\"Little War\\". Following Suleiman's unsuccessful siege of Vienna in 1529, Ferdinand launched a counter- attack in 1530 to regain the initiative. An assault on Buda was driven off by John Z√°polya, although Ferdinand was successful elsewhere‚Äîcapturing Gran (Esztergom) and other forts along the Danube river, a vital strategic frontier. Suleiman's response came in 1532 when he led a massive army of over 120,000 troops to besiege Vienna again. Ferdinand withdrew his army, leaving only 700 men with no cannons and a few guns to defend G√ºns (Koszeg) although Ibrahim Pasha, the Grand Vizier of the Ottomans, did not realize how poorly defended Koszeg was. Suleiman came to join him shortly after the Siege of G√ºns had started. For more than 25 days, Croatian captain Nikola Juri≈°iƒá and his garrison of 800 Croats held out against 19 full-scale assaults and an incessant bombardment by the over 120,000 Ottomans. As a result, the city was offered a surrender on favourable terms and, although the offer was rejected, the Ottomans retreated√Ågoston and Alan Masters (2009), p. 583According to Stephen Turnbull, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who would be allowed to enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Turkish flag. Anyway, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as previously planned, but homeward. leading to a peace treaty between Ferdinand and Suleiman. John Z√°polya was recognized as the King of Hungary by the Habsburgs, although as an Ottoman vassal. The treaty did not satisfy either John Z√°polya or Ferdinand, and their armies began skirmishes along the borders. In 1537, Ferdinand attacked John's forces at Osijek in violation of the treaty. The siege was a disaster of similar magnitude to that of Moh√°cs, with an Ottoman relief army smashing the Austrians. Rather than attack Vienna again, Suleiman attacked Otranto in southern Italy. At the naval Battle of Preveza in 1538, the Ottomans inflicted another defeat on the Habsburg-led coalition.Turnbull (2003), p. 52. John Z√°polya died in 1540 and was succeeded by his infant son John II Sigismund Z√°polya. For much of his reign, the country was governed by his mother Isabella Jagiellon, with continued support from Suleiman. John II remained the nominal King of Hungary until he abdicated in 1570 and returned the country to Habsburg rule. A further humiliating defeat was inflicted on the Habsburgs in the 1541 Siege of Buda, when the Ottomans responded to a request for help from Isabella Jagiellon. In April 1543, Suleiman launched another campaign in Hungary, taking back Bran and other forts and returning much of Hungary to Ottoman control. In August 1543, the Ottomans succeeded in the Siege of Esztergom, which was followed by the capture of three Hungarian cities: Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r, Sikl√≥s, and Szeged, offering better security for Buda. Another peace agreement between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians good reason to believe that Hungary was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ended, until its revival in 1566.

He was 72 years old and, although having gout to the extent that he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies he had ever commanded. His opposite number, Count Nikola IV Zrinski, was one of the largest landholders in the Kingdom of Croatia, a seasoned veteran of border warfare, and a Ban (Croatian royal representative) from 1542 to 1556.Krokar Slide Set #27, image 42 In his early life he distinguished himself in the Siege of Vienna and pursued a successful military career. Suleiman's forces reached Belgrade on 27 June after a forty-nine-day march. Here he met with John II Sigismund Z√°polya who he earlier promised to make the ruler of all Hungary. Learning of Zrinski's success in an attack upon a Turkish encampment at Sikl√≥s, Suleiman decided to postpone his attack on Eger () and instead attack Zrinski's fortress at Szigetv√°r to eliminate him as a threat.Setton (1991), pp. 845‚Äì846. =Siege= The advanced guard of the Turks arrived on 2 August 1566 and the defenders made several successful sorties causing considerable loss to the Turks. The Sultan arrived with the main force on 5 AugustCopp√©e (1864), pp. 562‚Äì565. and his big war tent was erected on the Similehov hill, giving him a view of the battle. The Sultan stayed in his camp where he received verbal battle progress reports from his Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, the real operational commander of the Ottoman forces.Sakaoƒülu (1999), pp. 140‚Äì141. Count Zrinski found himself besieged by a hostile army of at least 150,000 soldiers with powerful artillery. Zrinski had assembled a force of around 2,300 Croatian and Hungarian soldiers prior to the siege. These consisted of his personal forces, and those of his friends and allies,Perok (1861), pp. 46‚Äì48. primarily Count Ga≈°par Alapiƒá and lieutenants Miklou≈° Kobak, Petar Pataƒçiƒá, and Vuk Paprutoviƒá. The majority of the defenders were Croatian, with a significant Hungarian contingent represented in both the men-at-arms and the leadership. Szigetv√°r was divided by water into three sections: the old town, the new town, and the castle‚Äîeach of which was linked to the next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground, the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys had to be taken and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched. When the Sultan appeared before the fortress, he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch.Roworth (1840), p. 53. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, which was repulsed. Despite being undermanned, and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army. After over a month of exhausting and bloody struggle, the few remaining defenders retreated into the old town for their last stand. The Sultan tried to entice Zrinski to surrender, ultimately offering him leadership of Croatia under Ottoman influence.Pardoe (1842), p. 84. Count Zrinski did not reply and continued to fight. Emperor Maximilian and 80,000 soldiers stood in the vicinity of Gy≈ër but did not attack the Ottomans to take the pressure off Szigetv√°r.Paul Lendvai; (2004) The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat p. 94-100 Princeton University Press, The fall of the castle appeared inevitable but the Ottoman high command hesitated. On 6 September Suleiman died in his tent. His death was kept secret at great effort, with only the Sultan's innermost circle knowing of his demise. This was because the Ottomans feared that their soldiers would give up the battle if they knew that their leader died, so his death was kept secret for 48 days. A courier was dispatched from the camp with a message for Suleiman's successor, Selim II. The courier may not even have known the content of the message he delivered to distant Asia Minor within a mere eight days. =Final battle= The final battle began on 7 September, the day after Suleiman's demise. By this time, the fortress walls had been reduced to rubble by mining with explosives and wood fueled fires at the corners of the walls. In the morning an all-out attack began with fusillades from small arms, \\"Greek fire\\", and a concentrated cannonade.According to Robert William Fraser, more than 10,000 large cannon balls were shot into the fortress during the siege. Soon the castle, the last stronghold within Szigetv√°r, was set ablaze and cinders fell into the apartments of the count. The Ottoman army swarmed through the city, drumming and yelling. Zrinski prepared for a last charge addressing his troops: Zrinski did not allow the final assault to break into the castle. As the Turks were pressing forwards along a narrow bridge the defenders suddenly flung open the gate and fired a large mortar loaded with broken iron, killing 600 attackers. Zrinski then ordered a charge and led his remaining 600 troops out of the castle. He received two musket wounds in his chest and was killed shortly afterwards by an arrow to the head. Some of his force retired into the castle. The Turks took the castle and most of the defenders were slain. A few of the captured defenders were spared by Janissaries who had admired their courage, with only seven defenders managing to escape through the Ottoman lines. Zrinski's corpse was beheaded and it is considered his head was sent by Mehmed Pasha to Budin Pasha Sokullu Mustafa, or to new Sultan Selim II, but eventually, the head was buried by son Juraj IV Zrinski, Boldizs√°r Batthy√°ny, and Ferenc Tahy in September 1566 at the Pauline monastery in Sveta Jelena, ≈†enkovec, Croatia. His body received an honourable burial by a Turk who had been his prisoner, and well treated by him. =Powder magazine explosion= Before leading the final sortie by the castle garrison, Zrinski ordered a fuse be lit to the powder magazine.According to Francis Lieber, explosion of the powder magazine is somewhat disputable. After cutting down the last of the defenders the besiegers poured into the fortress. The Ottoman Army entered the remains of Szigetv√°r and fell into the booby trap; thousands perished in the blast when the castle's magazine exploded.Dupuy (1970), p. 501. The Vizier Ibrahim's life was saved by one of Zrinski's household who warned him of the trap when the Vizier and his troops searched for treasure and interrogated the survivors. While inquiring about the treasure the prisoner replied that it had been long expended, but that 3,000 lbs of powder were under their feet to which a slow match had been attached. The Vizier and his mounted officers had just enough time to escape but 3,000 Turks perished in the explosion.Nafziger & Walton (2003), p. 105 Aftermath Almost all of Zrinski's garrison was wiped out after the final battle. Ottoman casualties were also heavy. Three pashas, 7,000 Janissaries, and 28,000 other soldiers are said to have perished. Sources vary on the exact number with estimates ranging from 20,000‚Äì35,000. After the battle the Grand Vizier forged bulletins in the Sultan's name, proclaiming victory. These announced that the Sultan regretted that his current state of health prevented him from continuing with the successful campaign. His body was returned to Constantinople while the inner circle of officials pretended to keep up communication with him. Turkish sources state that the illusion was maintained for three weeks and that even the Sultan's personal physician was strangled as a precaution. It is likely that the long journey and the siege had a detrimental effect on the Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier had to return to Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter.Elliott (2000), p. 118. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna. Two ambassadors were sent by Emperor Maximilian: Croatian Antun Vranƒçiƒá and Styrian Christoph Teuffenbach. They arrived in Istanbul on 26 August 1567 and were well received by Sultan Selim II.Setton (1984), pp. 921‚Äì922. An agreement ending the war between the Austrian and Ottoman empires was reached on 17 February 1568, after five months of negotiations with Sokollu Mehmed Pasha (also known as Mehmed-pa≈°a Sokoloviƒá, being originally from Bosnia). The Treaty of Adrianople was signed on 21 February 1568. Sultan Selim II agreed to an eight-year truce, although the agreement brought 25 years of (relative) peace between the Empires until the Long War. The truce was conditional and Maximilian agreed to pay an annual tribute of 30,000 ducats. Legacy and depictions in art Head sculptures of Nikola IV Zrinski (left) and Sultan Suleiman (right) at Hungarian-Turkish Friendship Park in Szigetv√°r The Croatian Renaissance poet and writer Brne Karnarutiƒá, from Zadar, wrote The Conquest of the City of Sziget (Vazetje Sigeta grada) sometime before 1573.Karnarutiƒá (1866), pp. 1‚Äì83. His work was posthumously published in 1584 in Venice. This is the first Croatian historical epic dealing with national history and the Battle of Szigetv√°r. It was inspired by Marko Maruliƒá's Judita. The battle was also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti Veszedelem (\\"Peril of Sziget\\"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski's great-grandson Nicholas VII of Zrin (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 and published in 1651. This was one of the first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Maruliƒá's Judita. Kenneth Clark's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti Veszedelem as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them. The Turks are portrayed as human beings and a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is interwoven into the main plot. Petar Zrinski (), the brother of Nikola VII Zrinski, published Opsida Sigecka (1647/8) in the Croatian language‚Äînot surprising since the Zrinski family were bilingual. Another Croatian nobleman warrior-poet Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá (1652‚Äì1713) wrote about the battle. His poem Odiljenje sigetsko (\\"The Sziget Farewell\\"), first published in 1684, reminisces about the event without rancour or crying for revenge. The last of the four cantos is titled \\"Tombstones\\" and consists of epitaphs for the Croatian and Turkish warriors who died during the siege, paying equal respect to both. Karl Theodor K√∂rner, 1791‚Äì1813, a German poet, wrote in 1812 a drama, Zriny, about the battle. Ivan Zajc's 1876 opera Nikola ≈†ubiƒá Zrinski is his most famous and popular work in Croatia. This recounts the heroic defiance of the Croats towards the Turks, as a metaphor for their later nationalist impulses within the Habsburg monarchy. Zrinski is depicted in the plot as a 16th-century Croatian hero who defeated the Turks a couple of times before perishing sacrificially, along with his family and close supporters, in the siege of Szigeth castle. The opera is patriotic with a famous aria \\"U boj, u boj\\".

He played six years in Major League Baseball in the US, and thirteen years in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) in Japan. Rhodes is the all-time NPB home run leader among foreign-born players, and he is tied for 11th overall with 464 home runs in Japan. He hit 55 home runs in 2001, equaling the NPB single-season mark set by Sadaharu Oh in 1964. Early life Rhodes was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He acquired the nickname \\"Tuffy\\" as a child because of his serious approach to baseball. Rhodes attended Western Hills High School in Cincinnati. Career Prior to Japan, he was a center fielder playing for the Houston Astros, Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox from 1990-1995. In his major league career, Rhodes batted .224, with 13 home runs and 44 runs batted in, 74 runs scored and 14 stolen bases in 225 games played. In , he hit an extra-inning home run to win the American Association championship for the Iowa Cubs. His only season of more than 250 at bats came with the 1994 Cubs. In that season, Rhodes became the first National League player to hit three home runs on opening day when he connected off Dwight Gooden at Wrigley Field. In this game, Rhodes also became the first major leaguer ever to hit home runs in his first three at-bats of a season. Granted free agency after the season, Rhodes signed with the Kintetsu Buffaloes in the Pacific League of NPB. In the season, he hit his 55th homer to tie Sadaharu Oh's Japanese League single season home run record, set in . For the rest of the season, opposing pitchers intentionally walked Rhodes to prevent him from breaking Oh's record. (The current record is 60, set by Wladimir Balentien in 2013.) The following year, Alex Cabrera tied the record. Over 8 seasons with the Buffaloes, Rhodes hit 288 home runs for the team. After Kintetsu refused to sign him to a multi-year contract, Rhodes signed a two-year deal with the Yomiuri Giants of the Japanese Central League in 2004. A successful first year was followed by a difficult second year. He left the team halfway through the 2005 season due to injury, and was released in the off-season. In 2006, he tried to return to the major leagues with the Cincinnati Reds but was released by the team in spring training. He did not play again that season. After spending the rest of 2006 with his family, however, he returned to Japan in 2007, signing a one-year contract with the Orix Buffaloes. After 10 seasons in NPB, Rhodes became just the second foreign player to accrue the required service time to no longer be counted as a foreign player for roster purposes, joining Tai-Yuan Kuo. In the past decade, Alex Ram√≠rez and Alex Cabrera have also achieved the same classification. Rhodes began the 2007 season with a bang by hitting a home run in his first game, and connecting for two more in the next game on two consecutive at bats. According to manager Terry Collins, Rhodes still had an 'explosive' bat.Asahi.com While the Buffaloes struggled to a last-place finish in 2007, and also not having any protection to speak of in the lineup, Rhodes' comeback was a spectacular one, batting .291 and hitting 42 home runs to go with 96 runs batted in. The next season, teamed with fellow gaijin slugger Alex Cabrera, Rhodes hit 40 home runs and drove in 118 runs. Combined, Cabrera and Rhodes, who earned the nickname \\"Caburo\\" late in the season, slammed 76 home runs and drove in 222 runs. Rhodes' 118 RBI also led the league as the Buffaloes made an improbable run to the playoffs, finishing second in the Pacific League and making their first playoff appearance since their 1996 Japan Series victory. However, the success did not last as the Buffaloes were swept in the short first-round of the Pacific League Climax Series by Yu Darvish and the more experienced Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters. Rhodes played for one more season with Orix before retiring for good at the end of the 2009 season.

According to Christian tradition, the Image of Edessa was a holy relic consisting of a square or rectangle of cloth upon which a miraculous image of the face of Jesus had been imprinted‚Äîthe first icon (\\"image\\"). In the Orthodox Churches, including English-speaking Orthodoxy, the image is generally known as the Mandylion. By this account, King Abgar of Edessa wrote to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Abgar received a reply letter from Jesus, declining the invitation, but promising a future visit by one of his disciples. One of the seventy disciples, Thaddeus of Edessa, is said to have come to Edessa, bearing the words of Jesus, by the virtues of which the king was miraculously healed. This tradition was first recorded in the early 4th century by Eusebius of Caesarea,Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiae 1.13.5 and .22. who said that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa, but who makes no mention of an image.Steven Runciman, \\"Some Remarks on the Image of Edessa\\", Cambridge Historical Journal 3.3 (1931:238-252), p. 240 The report of an image, which accrued to the legendarium of Abgar, first appears in the Syriac work, the Doctrine of Addai: according to it, the messenger, here called Ananias, was also a painter, and he painted the portrait, which was brought back to Edessa and conserved in the royal palace.Runciman 1931, loc. cit.. The first record of the existence of a physical image in the ancient city of Edessa (now Urfa) was by Evagrius Scholasticus, writing about 593, who reports a portrait of Christ of divine origin (Œ∏ŒµœåœÑŒµœÖŒ∫œÑŒøœÇ), which effected the miraculous aid in the defence of Edessa against the Persians in 544.Evagrius, in Migne, Patrologia Graecalxxxvi, 2, cols. 2748f, noted by Runciman 1931, p. 240, note 5; remarking that \\"the portrait of Christ has entered the class of Œ±œáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøŒπ icons\\". The image was moved to Constantinople in the 10th century. The cloth disappeared when Constantinople was sacked in 1204 during the Fourth Crusade, and is believed by some to have reappeared as a relic in King Louis IX of France's Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This relic disappeared in the French Revolution.Two documentary inventories: year 1534 (Gerard of St. Quentin de l'Isle, Paris) and year 1740. See Grove Dictionary of Art, Steven Runciman, Some Remarks on the Image of Edessa, Cambridge Historical Journal 1931, and Shroud.com for a list of the group of relics. See also an image of the Gothic reliquary dating from the 13th century, in Histor.ws . The provenance of the Edessa letter between the 1st century and its location in his own time are not reported by Eusebius. The materials, according to the scholar Robert Eisenman, \\"are very widespread in the Syriac sources with so many multiple developments and divergences that it is hard to believe they could all be based on Eusebius' poor efforts\\" (Eisenman 1997:862). The Eastern Orthodox Church observes a feast for this icon on August 16, which commemorates its translation from Edessa to Constantinople. History of the legend The story of the Mandylion is likely the product of centuries of development. The first version is found in Eusebius' History of the Church (1.13.5 ‚Äì 1.13.22). Eusebius claimed that he had transcribed and translated the actual letter in the Syriac chancery documents of the king of Edessa. This records a letter written by King Abgar of Edessa to Jesus, asking him to come cure him of an illness. Jesus replies by letter, saying that when he had completed his earthly mission and ascended to heaven, he would send a disciple (Thaddeus of Edessa) to heal Abgar (and does so). At this stage, there is no mention of an image of Jesus. In AD 384, Egeria, a pilgrim from either Gaul or Spain, was given a personal tour by the Bishop of Edessa, who provided her with many marvellous accounts of miracles that had saved Edessa from the Persians and put into her hands transcripts of the correspondence of Abgarus and Jesus, with embellishments. Part of her accounts of her travels, in letters to her sisterhood, survive. \\"She na√Øvely supposed that this version was more complete than the shorter letter which she had read in a translation at home, presumably one brought back to the Far West by an earlier pilgrim\\" (Palmer 1998). Her escorted tour, accompanied by a translator, was thorough; the bishop is quoted: \\"Now let us go to the gate where the messenger Ananias came in with the letter of which I have been telling you.\\" (Palmer). There was however, no mention of any image reported by Egeria, who spent three days inspecting every corner of Edessa and the environs. The next stage of development appears in the Doctrine of Addai [Thaddeus], c. 400, which introduces a court painter among a delegation sent by Abgar to Jesus, who paints a portrait of Jesus to take back to his master: The later legend of the image recounts that because the successors of Abgar reverted to paganism, the bishop placed the miraculous image inside a wall, and setting a burning lamp before the image, he sealed them up behind a tile; that the image was later found again, after a vision, on the very night of the Persian invasion, and that not only had it miraculously reproduced itself on the tile, but the same lamp was still burning before it; further, that the bishop of Edessa used a fire into which oil flowing from the image was poured to destroy the Persians. The image itself is said to have resurfaced in 525, during a flood of the Daisan, a tributary stream of the Euphrates that passed by Edessa. This flood is mentioned in the writings of the court historian Procopius of Caesarea. In the course of the reconstruction work, a cloth bearing the facial features of a man was discovered hidden in the wall above one of the gates of Edessa. Writing soon after the Persian siege of 544, Procopius says that the text of Jesus' letter, by then including a promise that \\"no enemy would ever enter the city\\", was inscribed over the city gate, but does not mention an image. Procopius is sceptical about the authenticity of the promise, but says that the wish to disprove it was part of the Persian king Khosrau I's motivation for the attack, as \\"it kept irritating his mind\\".Kitzinger, 103‚Äì104, 103 with first quote; Procopius, Histories of the Wars, II, 26, 7‚Äì8, quoted, and 26‚Äì30 on Jesus' promise, Loeb translation quoted. The Syriac Chronicle of Edessa written in 540-550 also claim divine interventions in the siege, but does not mention the Image. Some fifty years later, Evagrius Scholasticus in his Ecclesiastical History (593) is the first to mention a role for the image in the relief of the siege,Kitzinger, 103 attributing it to a \\"God-made image\\", a miraculous imprint of the face of Jesus upon a cloth. Thus we can trace the development of the legend from a letter, but no image in Eusebius, to an image painted by a court painter in Addai, which becomes a miracle caused by a miraculously-created image supernaturally made when Jesus pressed a cloth to his wet face in Evagrius. It was this last and latest stage of the legend that became accepted in Eastern Orthodoxy, the image of Edessa that was \\"created by God, and not produced by the hands of man\\". This idea of an icon that was Acheiropoietos (ŒëœáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, literally \\"not-made-by-hand\\") is a separate enrichment of the original legend: similar legends of supernatural origins have accrued to other Orthodox icons. The Ancha icon is reputed to be the Keramidion, another acheiropoietos recorded from an early period, miraculously imprinted with the face of Christ by contact with the Mandylion. To art historians it is a Georgian icon of the 6th-7th century. According to the Golden Legend, which is a collection of hagiographies, compiled by Jacobus de Varagine in the thirteenth century the king Abgarus sent an epistle unto Jesus and he answered him writing that he will send him one of his disciples (Jude Thaddeus) to heal him. The same works adds: Later events The Holy Mandylion disappeared again after the Sassanians conquered Edessa in 609. A local legend, related to historian Andrew Palmer when he visited Urfa (Edessa) in 1999, relates that the towel or burial cloth (mendil) of Jesus was thrown into a well in what is today the city's Great Mosque. The Christian tradition exemplified in Georgios Kedrenos' Historiarum compendiumKedrenos, ed. Bekker, vol. I:685; see K. Weitzmann, \\"The Mandylion and Constantine Porphyrogennetos\\", Cahiers arch√©ologiques 11 (1960:163-84), reprinted in Studies in Classical and Byzantine Manuscript Illumination, H. Kessler, ed. (Chicago, 1971:224-76). is at variance with this, John ScylitzesJohn Scylitzes. 231f, noted in Holger A. Klein, \\"Sacred Relics and Imperial Ceremonies at the Great Palace of Constantinople\\", 2006:91 and note 80 ([ reprinted on-line]). recounting how in 944, when the city was besieged by John Kourkouas, it was exchanged for a group of Muslim prisoners. At that time the Image of Edessa was taken to Constantinople where it was received amidst great celebration by emperor Romanos I Lekapenos, who deposited it in the Theotokos of the Pharos chapel in the Great Palace of Constantinople. Not inconsequentially, the earliest known Byzantine icon of the Mandylion or Holy Face, preserved at Saint Catherine's Monastery in Egypt, is dated c. 945.K. Weitzmann, The Monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai: The Icons I: From the Sixth to the Tenth Century, Princeton, 1976:94-98, and plates xxxvi- xxxvii. The Mandylion remained under Imperial protection until the Crusaders sacked the city in 1204 and carried off many of its treasures to Western Europe, though the \\"Image of Edessa\\" is not mentioned in this context in any contemporary document. Similarly, it has been claimed that the Shroud of Turin disappeared from Constantinople in 1204, when Crusaders looted the city. The leaders of the Crusader army in this instance were French and Italian (from Venice), and it is believed that somehow because of this, the Shroud made its way to France.Archaeological Study Bible by Zondervan A small part of a relic, believed to be the same as this, was one of the large group sold by Baldwin II of Constantinople to Louis IX of France in 1241 and housed in the Sainte- Chapelle in Paris (not to be confused with the Sainte Chapelle at Chamb√©ry, home for a time of the Shroud of Turin) until it disappeared during the French Revolution. The famous Portuguese Jesuit, Jer√≥nimo Lobo, who visited Rome in 1637, mentions the sacred portrait sent to King Abgar as being in this city: \\"I saw the famous relics that are preserved in that city as in a sanctuary, a large part of the holy cross, pieces of the crown and several thorns, the sponge, the lance, Saint Thomas's finger, one of the thirty coins for which the Saviour was sold, the sacred portrait, the one that Christ Our Lord sent to King Abagaro, the sacred staircase on which Christ went up and down from the Praetorium, the head of the holy Baptist, the Column, the Altar on which Saint Peter said mass, and countless other relics.\\"The itinerario of Jeronimo Lobo, 1984, page 400 File:Cathedral of the Holy Mandylion (Andronikov Monastery) 10.jpgThe katholikon of Andronikov Monastery is the oldest (outside the Kremlin) building in Moscow and one of numerous Russian churches dedicated to the Holy Mandylion File:Christos Acheiropoietos.jpg\\"The Saviour Not Made by Hands\\", a Novgorodian icon from c. 1100 Links with the Shroud of Turin Author Ian Wilson has argued that the object venerated as the Mandylion from the 6th to the 13th centuries was in fact the Shroud of Turin, folded in four, and enclosed in an oblong frame so that only the face was visible. Wilson cites documents in the Vatican Library and the University of Leiden, Netherlands, which seem to suggest the presence of another image at Edessa. A 10th-century codex, Codex Vossianus Latinus Q 69From the library of Gerhard Johann Vossius. found by Gino Zaninotto in the Vatican Library contains an 8th-century account saying that an imprint of Christ's whole body was left on a canvas kept in a church in Edessa: it quotes a man called Smera in Constantinople: \\"King Abgar received a cloth on which one can see not only a face but the whole body\\" (in Latin: [non tantum] faciei figuram sed totius corporis figuram cernere poteris).Codex Vossianus Latinus, Q69, and Vatican Library, Codex 5696, fol.35, which was published in Pietro Savio, Ricerche storiche sulla Santa Sindone Turin 1957. Surviving images Two images survive today which are associated with the Mandylion. =Holy Face of Genoa= This image is kept in the Church of St Bartholomew of The Armenians in Genoa, Italy. In the 14th century it was donated to the doge of Genoa Leonardo Montaldo by the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaeologus. It has been the subject of a detailed 1969 study by Colette Dufour Bozzo, who dated the outer frame to the late 14th century, giving a terminus ante quem for the inner frame and the image itself. Bozzo found that the image was imprinted on a cloth that had been pasted onto a wooden board.Das Mandylion von Genua und sein pal√§ologischer Rahmen - The Mandylion of Genoa (in German) See also: Annalen van de stad Genua uit de 14de eeuw beschrijven dat het de echte Edessa-mandylion betreft (in Dutch) The similarity of the image with the Veil of Veronica suggests a link between the two traditions. =Holy Face of San Silvestro= This image was kept in Rome's church of San Silvestro in Capite, attached to a convent of Poor Clares, up to 1870, and is now kept in the Matilda chapel in the Vatican Palace. It is housed in a Baroque frame added by Sister Dionora Chiarucci, head of the convent, in 1623. The earliest evidence of its existence is 1517, when the nuns were forbidden to exhibit it to avoid competition with the Veronica. Like the Genoa image, it is painted on board and therefore is likely to be a copy. It was exhibited at Germany‚Äôs Expo 2000 in the pavilion of the Holy See.

Veil of Veronica Veronica holding her veil, Hans Memling, c. 1470 The Veil of Veronica, or Sudarium (Latin for sweat- cloth), often called simply \\"The Veronica\\" and known in Italian as the Volto Santo or Holy Face (but not to be confused with the carved crucifix Volto Santo of Lucca), is a Christian relic of a piece of cloth which, according to tradition, bears the likeness of the face of Jesus not made by human hand (i.e., an acheiropoieton).

The word \\"Moro\\" is a term for Muslim people who lived in the Southern Philippines, an area that includes Mindanao, Jolo and the neighboring Sulu Archipelago. Background The Moros have a 400-year history of resisting foreign rule. The violent armed struggle against the Spanish, against the Americans, against the Japanese, and against the Filipinos, is considered by current Moro leaders as part of the four centuries-long \\"national liberation movement\\" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation).Banlaoi 2012, p. 24. This conflict persisted and developed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state.Banlaoi 2005 , p. 68. A \\"culture of jihad\\" emerged among the Moros due to the centuries-long war against the Spanish invaders. The ethnic Moro population of the southern Philippines resisted both Spanish and United States colonization. The Moro areas of Western Mindanao have been the most rebellious areas in the Philippines along with Samar Island and Bicol Region. The Spaniards were restricted to a handful of coastal garrisons or Forts and they made occasional punitive expeditions into the vast interior regions. After a series of unsuccessful attempts during the centuries of Spanish rule in the Philippines, Spanish forces occupied the abandoned city of Jolo, Sulu, the seat of the Sultan of Sulu, in 1876. The Spaniards and the Sultan of Sulu signed the Spanish Treaty of Peace on July 22, 1878. Control of the Sulu archipelago outside of the Spanish garrisons was handed to the Sultan. The treaty had translation errors: According to the Spanish-language version, Spain had complete sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago, while the Tausug version described a protectorate instead of an outright dependency. Despite the very nominal claim to the Moro territories, Spain ceded them to the United States in the Treaty of Paris which signaled the end of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Following the American occupation of the Northern Philippines during 1899, Spanish forces in the Southern Philippines were abolished, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and Jolo. American forces took control over the Spanish government in Jolo on May 18, 1899, and at Zamboanga in December 1899. The Moros resisted the new American colonizers as they had resisted the Spanish. The Spanish, American, and Philippine governments have all been fought against by the Muslims of Sulu and Mindanao. Ottoman Empire's role John Hay, the American Secretary of State, asked the ambassador to Ottoman Empire, Oscar Straus in 1899 to approach Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II to request that the Sultan write a letter to the Moro Sulu Muslims of the Sulu Sultanate in the Philippines telling them to submit to American suzerainty and American military rule. Despite the sultan's \\"pan- Islamic\\" ideology, he readily aided the American forces because he felt no need to cause hostilities between the West and Muslims. Abdul Hamid wrote the letter, which was sent to Mecca where two Sulu chiefs brought it home to Sulu. It was successful, and the \\"Sulu Mohammedans ... refused to join the insurrectionists and had placed themselves under the control of [the American] army, thereby recognizing American sovereignty.\\" John P. Finley wrote that: > After due consideration of these facts, the Sultan, as Caliph caused a > message to be sent to the Mohammedans of the Philippine Islands forbidding > them to enter into any hostilities against the Americans, inasmuch as no > interference with their religion would be allowed under American rule. As > the Moros have never asked more than that, it is not surprising, that they > refused all overtures made, by Aguinaldo's agents, at the time of the > Filipino insurrection. President McKinley sent a personal letter of thanks > to Mr. Straus for the excellent work he had done, and said, its > accomplishment had saved the United States at least twenty thousand troops > in the field. If the reader will pause to consider what this means in men > and also the millions in money, he will appreciate this wonderful piece of > diplomacy, in averting a holy war. President McKinley did not mention the Ottoman Empire's role in the pacification of the Sulu Moros in his address to the first session of the Fifty-sixth Congress in December 1899 since the agreement with the Sultan of Sulu was not submitted to the Senate until December 18. Cause of the war After the American government informed the Moros that they would continue the old protectorate relationship that they had with Spain, the Moro Sulu Sultan rejected this and demanded that a new treaty be negotiated. The United States signed the Kiram-Bates Treaty with the Moro Sulu Sultanate which guaranteed the Sultanate's autonomy in its internal affairs and governance, including article X that guaranteed preservation of slavery, while America dealt with its foreign relations, in order to keep the Moros out of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Once the Americans subdued the northern Filipinos, the Bates Treaty with the Moros was adjusted by the Americans through removal of article X and they invaded Moroland.http://dtic.mil/cgi- bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA406868 Luga p. 22. After the war in 1915, the Americans imposed the Carpenter Treaty on Sulu. Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War events First Republic forces in the southern Philippines were commanded by General Nicolas Capistrano, and American forces conducted an expedition against him in the winter of 1900‚Äì1901. On March 27, 1901, Capistrano surrendered. A few days later, General Emilio Aguinaldo was captured in Luzon. This major victory in the war in the north allowed the Americans to devote more resources to the south, and they began to push into the interior of Bangsamoro. On August 31, 1901, Brig. Gen. George Whitefield Davis replaced Kobbe as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Davis adopted a conciliatory policy towards the Moros. American forces under his command had standing orders to buy Moro produce when possible and to have \\"heralds of amity\\" precede all scouting expeditions. Peaceful Moros would not be disarmed. Polite reminders of America's anti-slavery policy were allowed. One of Davis' subordinates, Captain John J. Pershing, assigned to the American garrison at Iligan, set out to better relations with the Moros of the Maranao tribes on the northern shore of Lake Lanao. He successfully established friendly relations with Amai- Manabilang, the retired Sultan of Madaya. Although retired, Manabilang was the single most influential personage among the fragmented inhabitants of the northern shore of the lake. His alliance did much to secure American standing in the area. Conflict Not all of Davis' subordinates were as diplomatic as Pershing. Many veterans of the Indian Wars took the \\"only good Indian is a dead Indian\\" mentality with them to the Philippines, and \\"civilize 'em with a Krag\\" became a similar catchphrase. Three ambushes of American troops by Moros, one of which involved Juramentados, occurred to the south of Lake Lanao, outside of Manabilang's sphere of influence. These events prompted Maj. Gen. Adna R. Chaffee, the military governor of the Philippines, to issue a declaration on April 13, 1902, demanding that the offending Datu hand over the killers of American troops and stolen government property. Not compliant, a punitive expedition under Col. Frank Baldwin set out to settle matters with the south-shore Moros. Although an excellent officer, Baldwin was \\"eager,\\" and a worried Davis joined the expedition as an observer. On May 2, 1902, Baldwin's expedition attacked a Moro cotta (fortress) at the Battle of Pandapatan, also known as the Battle of Bayan. Pandapatan's defenses were unexpectedly strong, leading to 18 American casualties during the fighting. On the second day, the Americans used ladders and moat-bridging tools to break through the Moro fortifications, and a general slaughter of the Moro defenders followed. thumb The expeditionary force built at Camp Vickers one mile south of Pandapatan, and Davis assigned Pershing to Baldwin's command as an intelligence officer and as director of Moro affairs. As director, 'Black Jack' Pershing had a veto over Baldwin's movements, which was an unstable arrangement. This arrangement was tested when survivors of Pandapatan began building a Cotta at Bacalod. Baldwin wanted to move on the hostile Moros immediately, but Pershing warned that doing so could create an anti-American coalition of the surrounding Datus, while some patient diplomacy could establish friendly relations with most of the Moros, isolating the hostile minority. Baldwin grudgingly agreed. On June 30, Pershing assumed command of Camp Vickers, and Baldwin returned to Malabang. A command the size of Camp Vickers would normally have gone to an officer with the rank of Major, and a careful shuffling of personnel would be required to ensure that reinforcements to the Camp did not include officers that were senior to Pershing. On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt issued a proclamation declaring an end to the Philippine Insurrection and a cessation of hostilities in the Philippines \\"except in the country inhabited by the Moro tribes, to which this proclamation does not apply.\\" Later that month, Davis was promoted and replaced Chaffee as the supreme commander of American forces in the Philippines. Command of the Mindanao-Jolo Department went to Brig. Gen. Samuel S. Sumner. Meanwhile, Pershing settled down to conduct diplomacy with the surrounding Moros, and a July 4th celebration had 700 guests from neighboring rancherias. In September 1902, he led the Masiu Expedition, which resulted in a victory that did much to establish American dominance in the area. On February 10, 1903, Pershing was declared a Datu by the formerly hostile Pandita Sajiduciaman of the Bayan Moros (who had been defeated at the Battle of Pandapatan)‚Äîthe only American to be so honored. Pershing's career at Camp Vickers culminated in the March Around Lake Lanao during April and May 1903. Dansalan also known as the Marawi Expedition, it included the Battle of Bacolod and First Battle of Taraka but was otherwise peaceful. This expedition quickly became a symbol of American control of the Lake Lanao region and was regarded with dismay by the Moro Maranao inhabitants of that region. While Pershing was working to the south of Lake Lanao, Major Robert Lee Bullard was working to the north, building a road from Iligan to Marawi. Although never officially declared one, like Pershing, he was regarded as a Datu by the Moros. Because of the Lake Lanao Moros' very personalistic style of leadership, they had troubles seeing them as two officers in the same army. Instead, they saw them as two powerful chieftains who might become rivals. During Pershing's March Around Lake Lanao, one Moro ran to Bullard, exclaiming that Pershing had gone Juramentado, meaning berserk and that Bullard had better run up the white flag (signaling that they had no quarrel with Pershing's troops). Bullard was unable to explain to the Moro why he was not worried about Pershing's approach. On another occasion, a powerful datu proposed an alliance with Bullard, for the purposes of defeating Pershing and establishing overlordship over the entire Lake Lanao region. On June 1, 1903, the Moro Province was created, which included \\"all of the territory of the Philippines lying south of the eight parallel of latitude, excepting the island of Palawan and the eastern portion of the northwest peninsula of Mindanao.\\" The province had a civil government, but many civil service positions, including the district governors and their deputies, were held by members of the American military. The governor of the province served as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. This system of combined civil and military administration had several motivations behind it. One was the continued Moro hostilities. Another was the Army's experience during the Indian Wars when it came into conflict with the civilian Bureau of Indian Affairs. A third was that the Moros, with their feudal, personalistic style of government, would have no respect for a military leader who submitted to the authority of a non-combatant. In addition to the executive branch, under the governor, the province also had a legislative branch: the Moro Council. This Council \\"consisted of the governor, a state attorney, a secretary, a treasurer, a superintendent of schools, and an engineer.\\" Although the governor appointed all of the other members of the council, this body was permanent and provided a more solid foundation for laws than the fiats of the governor, which might be overturned by his successor. The province was divided into five districts, with American officers serving as district governors and deputy governors. These districts included: Cotabato, Davao, Lanao, Sulu, and Zamboanga. The districts were sub-divided into tribal wards, with major datus serving as ward chiefs and minor datus serving as deputies, judges, and sheriffs. This system took advantage of the existing structure of Moro political society, which was based on personal ties while paving the way for a more individualistic society, where the office, not the person holding it, would be given respect. On August 6, 1903, Major General Leonard Wood assumed his position as the governor of Moro Province and commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo. Wood was somewhat heavy-handed in his dealing with the Moros, being \\"personally offended by the Moro propensity for blood feuds, polygamy, and human trafficking\\" and with his \\"ethnocentrism sometimes [leading] him to impose American concepts too quickly in Moroland.\\" In addition to his views of the Moros, Wood also faced an uphill Senate battle over his appointment to the rank of Major General, which was finally confirmed on March 19, 1904. This drove him to seek military laurels in order to shore up his lack of field experience, sometimes leading the Provincial army on punitive expeditions over minor incidents that would have been better handled diplomatically by the district governors. The period of Wood's governorship had the hardest and bloodiest fighting of America's occupation of Moroland. Some of the Moros fighting against the American troops were women who dressed exactly the same as men. This led to the song sung by American troops called \\"If a Lady's Wearin' Pantaloons\\". =Province under Leonard Wood (1903‚Äì1906)= Wood instituted many changes during his tenure as governor of Moro Province: * On Wood's recommendation, the United States unilaterally abrogated the Bates Treaty, citing continuing piracy and attacks on American personnel. The Sultan of Sulu was demoted to a purely religious office, with no more power than any other datu, and was provided with a small salary. The United States assumed direct control over Moroland. * Slavery was abolished. Slave trading and raiding were repressed, but slaves were left with their owners. Wood announced that slaves were \\"at liberty to go and build homes for themselves wherever they like[d],\\" and pledged the military's protection for any former slaves that did so. Similar actions had been taken by individual commanders in the past, but Wood's edict had the backing of the Moro Council, giving it more permanent weight. * The Cedula Act of 1903 created an annual registration poll tax. This registration poll tax was highly unpopular with the Moros, since they interpreted it as a form of tribute. According to Hurley, participation in the Cedula was very low as late as 1933. * The legal code of Moroland was reformed. Disputes between Moros and non-Christians had been left to Moro laws and customs, with Philippine laws only applying to disputes with Christians. This led to a double standard, with a Moro who killed a Christian facing a stiff prison sentence, but with a Moro who killed another Moro facing only a maximum fine of 150 pesos. Wood attempted to codify Moro law, but there was simply too much variance in laws and customs between the different tribes and even between neighboring cottas. Wood placed the Moros underneath the Philippine criminal code, but actual enforcement of this proved difficult. * Private land ownership was introduced, in order to help the Moros transition to a more individualistic society from their traditional tribal society. Each family was given 40 acres (16 ha) of land, with datus given additional land in accordance with their status. Land sales had to be approved by the district governments in order to prevent fraud. * An educational system was established. By June 1904, there were 50 schools with an average enrollment of 30 students each. Because of difficulties in getting teachers that spoke native languages, classes were conducted in English after initial training in that language. Many Moros were suspicious of the schools, but some offered buildings for use as schools. * Trade was encouraged in order to give the Moros an alternative to fighting. Trade had been discouraged by banditry, piracy, and the possibility of intertribal disputes between Moro merchants and local customers. When trading with foreign merchants (usually maritime Chinese), a lack of warehousing made for a buyer's market, leading to low prices. Wood handled banditry and piracy by establishing military posts at river mouths in order to protect sea and land routes. Starting with a pilot project in Zamboanga, a system of Moro Exchanges was established. These exchanges provided Moro traders with warehouses and temporary housing in exchange for honoring a ban on fighting within the exchange. Bulletin-boards listed market prices in Hong Kong and Singapore, and the district governments guaranteed fair prices. These Exchanges proved highly successful and profitable, and provided a neutral ground for feuding datus to settle their differences. Campaigns Major military campaigns during Wood's governorship include: * Wood's March Around Lake Lanao during the fall of 1903 was an abortive attempt to replicate Pershing's earlier March. * In October and November 1903, Wood personally led the Provincial Army to put down the Hassan Uprising, which was led by the most powerful datu on the island of Jolo. * In the spring of 1904, Wood destroyed or captured 130 cottas during the Second Battle of Taraca. * Beginning in the spring of 1904 and continuing into the fall of 1905, American forces conducted a lengthy and massive manhunt for Datu Ali, the overlord of Cottabato Valley. Datu Ali had rebelled over Wood's anti-slavery policy. Engagements during this campaign include the Battle of Siranaya, the Simpetan Massacre, and the Battle of the Malalag River. * The First Battle of Bud Dajo was fought from March 5 to March 7, 1906. An estimated 600 Muslims were killed, fighting a force of 800 Americans. The Incident in the Philippines written by Mark Twain condemned the American massacre at Bud Dajo. =Governorship of Tasker H. Bliss (1906‚Äì1909)= On February 1, 1906, Major. Gen. Tasker H. Bliss replaced General Wood as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo, and replaced him as governor of Moro Province sometime after the First Battle of Bud Dajo. Bliss' tenure is regarded as a \\"peace era\\", and Bliss launched no punitive expeditions during his term in office. However, this superficial peace came at the price of tolerating a certain amount of lawlessness. Constabulary forces in pursuit of Moro fugitives often found themselves forced to abandon their chase after the fugitives took refuge at their home cottas. The constabulary forces were outnumbered, and a much larger (and disruptive) expedition would have been required to dislodge the fugitives from their hiding place. However, this period also demonstrated the success of new aggressive American tactics. According to Rear Admiral D.P. Mannix, who fought the Moros as a young lieutenant from 1907‚Äì1908, the Americans exploited Muslim taboos by wrapping dead Moros in pig's skin and \\"stuffing [their] mouth[s] with pork\\", thereby deterring the Moros from continuing with their suicide attacks. A compilation of the diary of Rear Admiral D.P. Mannix III. =Governorship of John J. Pershing (1909‚Äì1913)= Cornelius C. Smith (far right), a recipient of the Medal of Honor, as commander of the Philippine Constabulary with Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing and Moro chieftains in 1910. Smith participated in expeditions against the Moro rebels for much of his time in the Philippines. On November 11, 1909, Brigadier General John J. Pershing assumed his duties as the third and final military governor of Moro Province. Reforms Pershing enacted the following reforms during his tenure as governor: * In order to extend rule of law into the interior, Pershing stationed the Philippine Scouts in small detachments throughout the interior. This reduced crime and promoted agriculture and trade, at the cost of reduced military efficiency and troop training. The benefits of this reform outweighed the costs. * The legal system was streamlined. Previously, trials had started with the Court of First Instance, which convened every 6 months, and appeals to the Supreme Court in Manila often took more than one year. Pershing expanded the jurisdiction of the local ward courts, which were presided over by the district governors and secretaries, to include most civil cases and all criminal cases except for capital offenses. The Court of First Instance became the court of last resort. This reform was popular with the Moros, since it was quick, simple, and resembled their traditional unification of executive and judicial powers. * Pershing promised to donate government land for purposes of building Muslim houses of worship. * Pershing recognized the practice of sacopy ‚Äì indentured servitude in exchange for support and protection ‚Äì as legitimate, but reaffirmed the government's opposition to involuntary slavery. * Labor contract law was reformed in 1912. Defaults on contracts by workers or employers were no longer punishable unless there was intent to defraud or injure. Moros, unused to Western notions of work, were prone to absenteeism, which could lead to breach of contract suits. * The economy of Moro Province continued to expand under Pershing. The three most important exports ‚Äì hemp, copra, and lumber ‚Äì increased 163% during his first three years, and Moros began to make bank deposits for the first time in their history. * The Moro Exchange system was retained and was supplemented by Industrial Trading Stations. These stations operated in the interior, where merchants seldom went, and bought any non-perishable goods the Moros wished to sell. The stations also sold goods to the Moros at fair prices, preventing price gouging during famines. Tactics Pershing wrote the following in his autobiography about the juramentado: > [The] juramentado attacks were materially reduced in number by a practice > the army had already adopted, one that the Mohammadans held in abhorrence. > The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was > not pleasant to have to take such measures but the prospect of going to hell > instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.Pershing, John > (2013) My Life Before the World War, 1860‚Äì1917: A Memoir, pp. 284-85 > Lexington, Kentucky: University Press of Kentucky. Though this treatment was inflicted on captured juramentado, historians do not believe that Pershing was directly involved with such incidents, or that he personally gave such orders to his subordinates. Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing's having been personally involved.Horton, Alex (August 18, 2017) \\"Trump said to study General Pershing. Here‚Äôs what the president got wrong\\" The Washington PostQiu, Linda (August 18, 2017) \\"Study Pershing, Trump Said. But the Story Doesn‚Äôt Add Up\\" The New York Times =Surrender of Arms= The four-day battle of Bagsak Mountain on Jolo island in 1913 Law enforcement in the Moro Province was difficult. Outlaws would go to ground at their home cottas, requiring an entire troop of police or soldiers to arrest them. There was always the danger of a full-fledged battle breaking out during such an arrest, and this led to many known outlaws going unpunished. In 1911, Pershing resolved to disarm the Moros. Army Chief of Staff Leonard Wood (former Moro Province governor) disagreed with this plan, stating that the move was ill- timed and that the Moros would hide their best arms, turning in only their worst. Pershing waited until roads into the interior had been completed, so that government troops could protect disarmed Moros from holdouts. He conferred with the Datus, who mostly agreed that disarmament would be a good idea ‚Äì provided that everybody disarmed. Six weeks before putting his disarmament plan into action, Pershing informed Governor-General William Cameron Forbes, who agreed with the plan. Pershing did not consult or inform his commanding officer, Major. Gen. J. Franklin Bell. On September 8, 1911, Executive Order No. 24, which ordered the disarmament, was issued. The deadline for disarmament was December 1, 1911. Resistance to disarmament was particularly fierce in the district of Jolo and led to the Second Battle of Bud Dajo (which, while involving roughly equivalent forces as the first battle, was far less bloody causing only 12 Moro casualties), and the Battle of Bud Bagsak. =Transition to civil authority= By 1913, Pershing agreed that the Moro Province needed to transition to civil government. This was prompted by the Moro's personalistic approach to government, which was based on personal ties rather than a respect for an abstract office. To the Moros, a change of administration meant not just a change in leadership but a change in regime, and was a traumatic experience. Rotation within the military meant that each military governor could serve only for a limited time. Civil governors were needed in order to provide for a lengthy tenure in office. Until 1911, every district governor and secretary had been a military officer. By November 1913, only one officer still held a civil office ‚Äì Pershing himself. In December 1913, Pershing was replaced as governor of Moro Province by a civilian, Frank Carpenter. Casualties During the Moro Rebellion, the Americans suffered losses amounting to 130 killed and 323 wounded. Another 500 or so died of disease. The Philippine Scouts who augmented American forces during the campaign suffered 116 killed and 189 wounded. The Philippine Constabulary suffered heavily as well with more than 1,500 losses sustained of which half were fatalities. On the Moro side, casualties were high as surrender was uncommon when Moros were engaged in combat.

Panglima Hassan in the Hassan uprising was shot dozens of times before his jihad was stopped. As a result, Americans elected to phase out revolvers with .38 caliber ammunition in favor of .45 ACP to continue their fight against the Moros. Arrows, bayonets, guns, and Kris were used in often suicidal attacks by the Moros during their war with the Americans. Suicide attacks became more popular among Moros due to the overwhelming firepower of the Americans in conventional battles. Moro women took part in the resistance at the Battle of Bud Dajo against the American General Lenard Wood in 1906. Barbed wire proved to be of no impediment since Moro Juramentado warriors managed to surge directly through it even as it ripped at their flesh and even as they were shot repeatedly with bullets. The Moros used barongs to inflict injuries upon American soldiers. Moros under Jikiri managed to survive in a cave under machine gun fire and Colt gunfire. Kris and Kampilan were used by Moros in fierce close quarter combat against the Americans. Muskets were also used by the Moro. The Moro employed bayonets at close range when shooting was not possible according to the American journal The Field Artillery Journal, Volume 32. Americans were even charged at by Moros using spears. Moros fought to the death against Americans armed with rifles and artillery while they themselves used only Kris at the crater battle. Novels have been written about Juramentados deliberately impaling themselves on their bayonets in attempts to reach and kill American soldiers. In popular culture * Vic Hurley's history of the Moros, \\"Swish of the Kris The Story of the Moros\\" tells the story of Col. Alexander Rodgers using pigs to subdue the Moros in the Philippines. Hurley wrote that Col. Rodgers was known as \\"the Pig\\" to the Moros.Swish of the Kris p. 223, Cerebus books And another Hurley book \\"The Jungle Patrol, the story of the Philippine Constabulary\\" also relates the story of pigs being used against them. * Hurley wrote the screenplay for the Hollywood film The Real Glory in 1937; the film was released in 1939. It was based on a 1937 novel of the same name by Charles L. Clifford, a pen name of Hurley's. There is a scene in the movie where Gary Cooper as Dr. Bill Canavan drapes a captured Muslim in a pigskin. He proclaims that all slain Muslim rebels will be buried in pig skins to prevent their entry into paradise. The film served as American military propaganda, portraying the US Army as brave defenders of the local population being terrorised by the Moros, whom the film inaccurately depicts as bloodthirsty raiders oppressing the local Filipino community.

Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues musicians before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. He was ranked No. 22 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" in 2003 and No. 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Early years Bloomfield was born into a wealthy Chicago Jewish-American family. Bloomfield's father, Harold Bloomfield, was born in Chicago in 1914. Harold's father, Samuel Bloomfield, started Bloomfield Industries in the early 1930s. After Samuel passed away, Harold and his brother, Daniel, took over the company. Bloomfield's mother, Dorothy Klein, was born in Chicago in 1918 and married Harold in 1940. She came from an artistic, musical family, working as an actress and a model before marrying Harold. Bloomfield's family lived in various locations around Chicago before settling at 424 West Melrose Street on the North Side. When he was twelve his family moved to suburban Glencoe, Illinois, where he attended New Trier High School for two years. During this time, he began playing in local bands, and Bloomfield put together a group called the Hurricanes, named after Ohio rock band Johnny and the Hurricanes. New Trier High School expelled Bloomfield after his band performed a raucous rock and roll song at a 1959 school gathering. He attended Cornwall Academy in Massachusetts for one year and then returned to Chicago, where he spent his last year of education at a local YMCA school, Central YMCA High School. Bloomfield had attended a 1957 Chicago performance by blues singer Josh White, and began spending time in Chicago's South Side blues clubs and playing guitar with such black bluesmen as Sleepy John Estes, Yank Rachell, and Little Brother Montgomery. He first sat in with a black blues band in 1959, when he performed with Luther \\"Guitar Junior\\" Johnson at a Chicago club called the Place. He performed with Howlin' Wolf, Muddy Waters, and many other Chicago blues performers during the early 1960s. In 1962 he married Susan Smith. Writing in 2001, keyboardist, songwriter and record producer Al Kooper said Bloomfield's talent \\"was instantly obvious to his mentors. They knew this was not just another white boy; this was someone who truly understood what the blues were all about.\\" Among his early supporters were B.B. King, Muddy Waters, Bob Dylan and Buddy Guy. \\"Michael used to say, 'It's a natural. Black people suffer externally in this country. Jewish people suffer internally. The suffering's the mutual fulcrum for the blues.'\\" The Butterfield Band (1965 - 1967) In the early 1960s he met harmonica player and singer Paul Butterfield and guitarist Elvin Bishop, with whom he would later play in The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. He also began friendships and professional associations with fellow Chicagoan Nick Gravenites and Bronx-born record producer Norman Dayron, who was attending the University of Chicago. He developed a friendship with blues singer Big Joe Williams. In 1963 Bloomfield and his two friends George Mitchell and Pete Welding ran a weekly blues showcase at the Fickle Pickle. He subsequently built up his reputation in two Chicago clubs, Big John's and Magoo's. With help from his friend Joel Harlib, a Chicago photographer who became Bloomfield's de facto manager, he became a Columbia Records recording artist. In early 1964 Harlib took an audition tape by Bloomfield to Columbia producer and talent scout John Hammond, who signed him to Columbia's Epic Records label. Bloomfield recorded a few sessions for Columbia in 1964 that remained unreleased until after his death. In early 1965 he joined the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, which included Elvin Bishop and keyboardist Mark Naftalin, along with drummer Sam Lay and bassist Jerome Arnold, who had previously worked in Howlin' Wolf's band. Elektra Records producer Paul Rothchild recorded the band in spring 1965, but the majority of the tracks were not released until the 1990s. However, one of the tracks Rothchild recorded during his first pass at producing the group, a Nick Gravenites song titled \\"Born in Chicago,\\" was included on the Elektra album Folksong '65, which sold two hundred thousand copies when it was released in September 1965. \\"Born in Chicago\\" became an underground hit for the Butterfield Band. Their debut album, The Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was recorded in September and released the following month. In June 1965, Bloomfield had recorded with Bob Dylan, whom he had met in 1963 at a Chicago club called the Bear. The club was bankrolled by future Dylan and Butterfield manager Albert Grossman, who would play a major part in Bloomfield's career. Bloomfield's Telecaster guitar licks were featured on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", a single produced by Columbia Record's Tom Wilson. Bloomfield would play on most of the tracks on Dylan's 1965 Highway 61 Revisited album, and he appeared onstage with Dylan in July at the Newport Folk Festival, where Dylan used Bloomfield and the Butterfield Band‚Äîminus Paul Butterfield‚Äîalong with keyboardists Al Kooper and Barry Goldberg. The show marked Dylan's first use of an electric band in a live performance, and Bloomfield's playing on the songwriter's \\"Maggie's Farm\\" is considered a landmark electric-guitar performance. After the Newport Folk Festival ended, Bloomfield helped Dylan complete the sessions for Highway 61 Revisited, and Dylan asked Bloomfield to join his touring band. Bloomfield demurred, preferring to continue playing with the Butterfield Band. After Sam Lay fell ill after a series of dates in November 1965, the Butterfield Band brought Chicago-born drummer Billy Davenport into the group. During the first part of 1966, the band played in California, and they recorded their second album, East-West, that summer. The record's title track found the band exploring modal music, and it was based upon a song Gravenites and Bloomfield had been playing since 1965, \\"It's About Time.\\" Bloomfield played on recording sessions between 1965 and 1967. His guitar playing had a huge impact on San Francisco Bay Area musicians after playing with the Butterfield band at Bill Graham‚Äôs Fillmore West. He became a mentor and teacher for many guitarists in the area. He did a 1965 date with Peter, Paul and Mary that resulted in a song called \\"The King of Names,\\" and he recorded in 1966 with pop group Chicago Loop, whose \\"When She Wants Good Lovin' (My Baby Comes to Me)\\" made Billboard Magazine's chart that year. He also played guitar on recordings by Chuck Berry, Mitch Ryder and James Cotton. The Electric Flag (1967 - 1968) Bloomfield tired of the Butterfield Band's rigorous touring schedule and, relocating to San Francisco, sought to create his own group. He formed the short-lived Electric Flag in 1967, with two longtime Chicago collaborators, Barry Goldberg and vocalist Nick Gravenites. The band featured a horn section. The band's rhythm section was composed of bassist Harvey Brooks and drummer Buddy Miles. Miles had previously played in Wilson Pickett's touring band, while Brooks had performed with Al Kooper in bands in New York City. The group's first effort was the soundtrack for director-producer Roger Corman's 1967 movie, The Trip, which was recorded in the spring of that year. The Electric Flag debuted at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and issued an album, A Long Time Comin', in April 1968 on Columbia Records. Critics complimented the group's distinctive, intriguing sound but found the record itself somewhat uneven. By that time, however, the band was already disintegrating; rivalries between members, shortsighted management, and heroin abuse all took their toll. Shortly after the release of that album, Bloomfield left his own band, with Gravenites, Goldberg, and bassist Harvey Brooks following.  Work with Al Kooper  Bloomfield also made an impact through his work with Al Kooper, who had played with Bloomfield on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Kooper had become an A&R; man for Columbia Records, and Bloomfield and Kooper had played piano on Moby Grape's 1968 Grape Jam, an instrumental album that had been packaged with the group's Wow collection. \\"Why not do an entire jam album together?\\" Kooper remembered in 1998, writing the booklet notes for the Bloomfield anthology Don't Say That I Ain't Your Man: Essential Blues, 1964‚Äì1969. \\"At the time, most jazz albums were made using this modus operandi: pick a leader or two co-leaders, hire appropriate sidemen, pick some tunes, make some up and record an entire album on the fly in one or two days. Why not try and legitimize rock by adhering to these standards? In addition, as a fan, I was dissatisfied with Bloomfield's recorded studio output up until then. It seemed that his studio work was inhibited and reined in, compared to his incendiary live performances. Could I put him in a studio setting where he could feel free to just burn like he did in live performances?\\" The result was Super Session, a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield's guitar skills on one side. Bloomfield, who suffered from insomnia, left the sessions after the first day. Guitarist Stephen Stills completed the album with Kooper. It received excellent reviews and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield's career. Its success led to a live sequel, The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper, recorded over three nights at Fillmore West in September 1968.  Solo work  Bloomfield continued with solo, session and back-up work from 1968 to 1980. He played guitar on Mother Earth's cover of Memphis Slim's \\"Mother Earth,\\" a track from their 1968 Living with the Animals album, and on two albums by Texas-born soul singer Wayne Talbert. With Mark Naftalin, he produced the 1968 sessions for James Cotton's 1968 album Cotton in Your Ears. He released his first solo album, It's Not Killing Me, in 1969. Bloomfield also helped Janis Joplin assemble her Kozmic Blues Band (for the album I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues, Again Mama!) in 1969, co-wrote \\"Work Me, Lord\\" for the album, and played the guitar solo on Joplin's blues composition \\"One Good Man.\\" Columbia released another 1969 album, a live concert jam, Live at Bill Graham's Fillmore West, including Mark Naftalin, former Electric Flag bandmates Marcus Doubleday and Snooky Flowers, and a guest appearance by Taj Mahal. In the same year he reunited with Paul Butterfield and Sam Lay for the Chess Records album Fathers and Sons, featuring Muddy Waters and pianist Otis Spann. Bloomfield composed and recorded the soundtrack for the film Medium Cool, directed by his second cousin, Haskell Wexler. The film includes footage shot in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. With Nick Gravenites, he produced blues guitarist Otis Rush's 1969 album Mourning in the Morning, recorded at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama with a band that included keyboardists Mark Naftalin and Barry Beckett, along with guitarist Duane Allman. During 1970 Bloomfield gave up playing because of his heroin addiction: He recorded his second solo album, Try It Before You Buy It, in 1973. Columbia rejected it; the complete version of the record would not appear until 1990. Also in 1973, he cut Triumvirate with Dr. John and guitarist and singer John Hammond Jr. In 1974, he rejoined the Electric Flag for an album titled The Band Kept Playing. In 1975 he recorded an album with the group KGB. The group's name is an acronym of the initials of singer and songwriter Ray Kennedy, Barry Goldberg and Bloomfield. The band also included Ric Grech and drummer Carmine Appice. Grech and Bloomfield quit shortly after its release. As the record hit stores in 1976, Bloomfield told journalists that the group had been an ill-conceived moneymaking project. The album was not well received by critics, but it did contain the standout track \\"Sail On, Sailor\\". Its authorship was credited to \\"Wilson-Kennedy\\", and had a bluesy, darker feel, along with Ray Kennedy's original cocaine-related lyrics. In the same year, he performed with John Cale on Cale's soundtrack for the film Caged Heat. In 1976 he recorded an instructional album for guitarists, If You Love These Blues, Play 'Em as You Please, which was financed through Guitar Player magazine. In the 1970s Bloomfield played in local San Francisco Bay area clubs, including the Keystone Korner, and sat in with other bands. In 1977, Bloomfield was selected by Andy Warhol to do the soundtrack for the pop artist's last film, Andy Warhol's Bad (also known as BAD). An unreleased single, \\"Andy's Bad\\", was also produced for the project. During 1979‚Äì1981 he performed often with the King Perkoff Band, sometimes introducing them as the \\"Michael Bloomfield and Friends\\" outfit. Bloomfield recorded \\"Hustlin' Queen\\", written by John Isabeau and Perkoff in 1979. He toured Italy and Sweden with guitarist Woody Harris and cellist Maggie Edmondson in the summer of 1980. He sat in with Bob Dylan at San Francisco's Warfield Theatre on November 15, 1980. Bloomfield played on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"The Groom's Still Waiting at the Altar\\". He continued to play live dates, and his performance at San Francisco State College on February 7, 1981, would be his final appearance. Although Bloomfield came from a wealthy family, he never inherited a large lump sum. He received annual income from a trust that had been set up by his paternal grandfather, which gave him $50,000 each year. Death Bloomfield died in San Francisco on February 15, 1981. He was found seated behind the wheel of his car, with all four doors locked. According to police, an empty Valium bottle was found on the car seat, but no suicide note was found. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy ruled the death accidental, though he was unable to determine a cause of death, because no drugs were found in Bloomfield's system, and there were no signs of foul play. Bloomfield's last album, Cruisin' for a Bruisin', was released the day his death was announced. His remains are interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, in Culver City, near Los Angeles. Style Bloomfield's musical influences include Scotty Moore, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, B.B. King, Big Joe Williams, Otis Rush, Albert King, Freddie King and Ray Charles. Bloomfield originally used a Fender Telecaster, though he had also used a Fender Duo-Sonic while recording for Columbia following his 1964 signing to the label. During his tenure with the Butterfield Blues Band he used that Tele on the first Butterfield Album and on their earliest tours in fall of 1965. By November he had swapped that guitar with International Submarine Band guitarist John Nuese for Nuese's 1954 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop model, which he used for some of the East-West sessions and which he acquired in Boston. In 1967, Bloomfield swapped the Goldtop with his friend repairman/musician Dan Erlewine for Dan's 1959 Les Paul Standard and $100. The Les Paul Standard had proven unpopular in the late 1950s because it was deemed too heavy and too expensive by rock and roll guitarists. Gibson discontinued manufacturing the model in 1960. Bloomfield used the Les Paul Standard in the Electric Flag and on the Super Session album and concerts. He later switched between the Les Paul and the Telecaster, but his use of the Les Paul inspired other guitarists to use the model and spurred Gibson to reintroduce the Les Paul Standard in 1968. Bloomfield eventually lost the guitar in Canada; Wolkin and Keenom's biography revealed that a club owner kept the guitar as partial compensation after Bloomfield cut short a round of appearances. This turned out to be accurate and the gig in question was at the Cave in Vancouver, booked from Tue. Nov. 12th 1974, for five days, until Sat. the 16th. The band played the first night but the next day, Bloomfield boarded a plane and flew home to San Francisco with virtually no notice to the club, hotel, or band members; his friend Mark Naftalin found a note on a torn piece of paper in the hotel room that read, \\"bye bye, sorry\\". Bloomfield's two guitars had been left at the club and were retained by club owner Stan Grozina, who wanted compensation for lost revenues. Unlike contemporaries such as Jimi Hendrix and Jeff Beck, Bloomfield rarely experimented with feedback and distortion, preferring a loud yet clean, almost chiming sound with a healthy amount of reverb and vibrato; this approach would strongly influence Jerry Garcia, who segued from a career in acoustic-based music to electric rock at the height of the Butterfield Band's influence in 1965. One of his amplifiers of choice was a 1965 Fender Twin Reverb. His solos, like those of most blues guitarists, were based in the minor pentatonic scale and the blues scale. However, his liberal use of chromatic notes within the pentatonic framework and his periodic lines based on Indian and Eastern modes allowed a considerable degree of fluidity in his solos. Gibson has since released a Michael Bloomfield Les Paul‚Äîreplicating his 1959 Standard‚Äîin recognition of his impact on the blues genre, his role in the revived production of the guitar, and his influence on many other guitarists. Because the actual guitar had been unaccounted for so many years, Gibson relied on hundreds of photographs provided by Bloomfield's family to reproduce the guitar. The model comes in two configurations‚Äîa clean Vintage Original Specifications (VOS) version, with only Bloomfield's mismatched volume and tone control knobs, missing toggle switch cover, and kidney-shaped tuners replacing the Gibson originals indicating its inspiration and a faithful, process-aged reproduction of the guitar as it was when Bloomfield played it last, complete with the finish smudge below the bridge and various nicks and smudges elsewhere around the body. His influence among contemporary guitarists continues to be widely felt, primarily in the techniques of vibrato, natural sustain, and economy of notes. Guitarists such as Joe Bonamassa, Arlen Roth, Carlos Santana, Slash, Jimmy Vivino, Chuck Hammer, Eric Johnson, Elliot Easton, Robben Ford, John Scofield, Jimmy Herring, Phil Keaggy, and G.E.

Interest in the origins of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school lies in the fact that their Vinaya recension appears in several ways to represent an older redaction overall. Many scholars also look to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch for the initial development of Mahayana Buddhism. Location Karli Chaitya section in perspective The original center of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sect was in Magadha, but they also maintained important centers such as in Mathura and Karli.Potter, Karl. Encyclopaedia of Indian Philosophies, Vol. 8: Buddhist Philosophy 100-350 AD. 2002. p. 23 The Kukku·π≠ikas were situated in eastern India around VƒÅrƒÅ·πáasƒ´ and PƒÅ·π≠aliputra and the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya in Ko≈õala, Andhra, and Gandhara. The LokottaravƒÅda subschool itself claimed to be of the 'Middle Country', i.e. Ganges Basin region in the north of India. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the LokottaravƒÅda subschool also had centres in the Gandhara region.The EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika are not known from later times.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 281-82 The Caitika branch was based in the Coastal Andhra region and especially at AmarƒÅvati and NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ. This Caitika branch included the P≈´rva≈õailas, Apara≈õailas, RƒÅjagirikas, and the SiddhƒÅrthikas. Finally, Madhyadesa was home to the Praj√±aptivƒÅdins.Elizabeth Cook. Light of Liberation: A History of Buddhism in India. Dharma Publishing, 1992. p. 242-243 The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including AmarƒÅvati, NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ and Jaggayyape·π≠a, \\"can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.\\"Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2. The cave temples at the Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ Caves, the Ellora Caves, and the Karla Caves are associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Gadkari, Jayant. Society and Religion: From Rgveda to Puranas. 1996. p. 198 Origins Most sources place the origin of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas to the Second Buddhist council. Traditions regarding the Second Council are confusing and ambiguous, but it is agreed that the overall result was the first schism in the Sangha between the Sthavira nikƒÅya and the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika nikƒÅya, although it is not agreed upon by all what the cause of this split was.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 47 Andrew Skilton has suggested that the problems of contradictory accounts are solved by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, which is the earliest surviving account of the schism.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 48 In this account, the council was convened at PƒÅ·π≠aliputra over matters of vinaya, and it is explained that the schism resulted from the majority (MahƒÅsa·πÉgha) refusing to accept the addition of rules to the Vinaya by the minority (Sthaviras). The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas therefore saw the Sthaviras as being a breakaway group which was attempting to modify the original Vinaya.Skilton, Andrew. A Concise History of Buddhism. 2004. p. 64 Scholars have generally agreed that the matter of dispute was indeed a matter of vinaya, and have noted that the account of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas is bolstered by the vinaya texts themselves, as vinayas associated with the Sthaviras do contain more rules than those of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika vinaya. Modern scholarship therefore generally agrees that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika vinaya is the oldest. According to Skilton, future historians may determine that a study of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school will contribute to a better understanding of the early Dhamma-Vinaya than the TheravƒÅda school. Appearance and language =Appearance= Eight Auspicious Signs of Buddhism Between 148 and 170 CE, the Parthian monk An Shigao came to China and translated a work which describes the color of monastic robes (Skt. kƒÅ·π£ƒÅya) utilized in five major Indian Buddhist sects, called Da Biqiu Sanqian Weiyi (Ch. Â§ßÊØî‰∏ò‰∏âÂçÉÂ®ÅÂÑÄ).Hino, Shoun. Three Mountains and Seven Rivers. 2004. p. 55 Another text translated at a later date, the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ, contains a very similar passage corroborating this information. In both sources, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas are described as wearing yellow robes. The relevant portion of the ≈öƒÅriputraparip·πõcchƒÅ reads: The lower part of the yellow robe was pulled tightly to the left.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 47 According to Dudjom Rinpoche from the tradition of Tibetan Buddhism, the robes of fully ordained MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika monastics were to be sewn out of more than seven sections, but no more than twenty-three sections.Dudjom Rinpoche. Perfect Conduct: Ascertaining the Three Vows. 1999. p. 16 The symbols sewn on the robes were the endless knot (Skt. ≈õrƒ´vatsa) and the conch shell (Skt. ≈õa·πÖkha), two of the Eight Auspicious Signs in Buddhism. =Language= The Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub (1290-1364) wrote that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas used PrƒÅkrit, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins Sanskrit, the SthaviravƒÅdins used Pai≈õƒÅcƒ´ and the Sa·πÉmitƒ´ya used Apabhra·πÉ≈õa.Yao, Zhihua.

Karla Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India. = List of doctrinal tenets = Andre Bareau, in his Buddhist sects of the small vehicle (1955), lists numerous doctrinal tenets as upheld by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika. Some of these include:Andre Bareau, Les sectes bouddhiques du Petit V√©hicule (Ecole Fransaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1955), Chapitre I 'Les Mahasanghika', pp. 55-74. # The Buddhas are supramundane (lokottara), devoid of asravas and the mundane natures. # In all their words (vaca), Tathagatas turn the wheel of Dharma. They can also express all the Dharmadhatu in a single sound. # The material body (rupakaya), power (prabhava) and longevity of the Buddha is unlimited (ananta). # The Buddha does not sleep or dream. # The Tathagata answers questions without thinking. # Buddhas never say a word because they are always in samadhi, but beings, thinking that they utter words, jump for joy. # In a single moment of thought (ekaksanikacitta), Buddhas comprehend all dharmas. # The Buddhas remain in all directions. There are Buddhas everywhere in the four directions. # When the Bodhisattvas enter into a womb (garbha), they possess nothing impure and are entirely provided with organs and members, rather than developing gradually. When they enter a womb, Bodhisattvas also take on the appearance of a white elephant. # Bodhisattvas, because they want to help beings become perfect, make vows to be reborn in bad destinations. # The different aspects of the four noble truths are known in a single moment (ekaksanika). # The five sensory (indriya) faculties consist of balls of flesh, therefore only consciousness (vijnana) sees forms, hears sounds, etc. # There are no indeterminate (avyakrta) things (dharma), that is, there are no dharmas that are neither good nor bad. # When one enters certainty [to become a Buddha] (samyaktvaniyama) one has abandoned all the fetters (samyojana). # \\"Stream enterers\\" (srotapanna) can commit all misdeeds, except for the irremediable crimes (anantarya). # All sutras uttered by Buddha are nƒ´tƒÅrtha (\\"of plain or clear meaning\\"). # Since they do not know everything (sabba), there are Arhats who are subject to ignorance (avijja), who have doubts (kariksa), who are saved by others. # The self-presence of mind is bright. It is soiled (i.e. darkened) by adventitious secondary defilement. # The tendencies (anusaya) are neither consciousnesses (citta) nor mental factors (caitta), and are devoid of object (analambana). # The past and the future do not really exist. # 'There is no intermediate state (antarabhava). # Virtue (sila) is not mental (acetasika) and it is not consecutive to thought (cittanuparivatti). # Tendencies (anusaya) are indeterminate (abyakata), not- caused (ahetuka) and disjointed from thought (cittavippayutta). # There is a root-consciousness (m≈´lavij√±ƒÅna) which serves as the support (dsraya) for eye- perception and the other sensory perceptions, like the root of the tree is the principle of the leaves, etc. # The current consciousnesses (pavattivi√±√±ƒÅna) can be simultaneous (sahabhu) and do not carry karmic seeds (bija). # The path (marga) and the defilements (kle≈õa) appear together. # The act (karman) and its maturation (vipaka) evolve at the same time. # Material things last a long time and so go through transformation (as milk turns into curds), but mental factors and consciousnesses do not because they have a swift production and cessation. # Thought (citta) penetrates the whole body (kaya) and, depending on the object (visaya) and the support (acraya), it can contract or expand. Cave 1, Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India = Buddhas and bodhisattvas = The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas advocated the transcendental and supramundane nature of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and the fallibility of arhats.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 48 Of the 48 special theses attributed by the Samayabhedoparacanacakra to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika, EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika, LokottaravƒÅda, and the Kukku·π≠ika, 20 concern the supramundane nature of buddhas and bodhisattvas.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 56 According to the Samayabhedoparacanacakra, these four groups held that the Buddha is able to know all dharmas in a single moment of the mind.Yao, Zhihua. The Buddhist Theory of Self-Cognition. 2005. p. 11 Yao Zhihua writes: A doctrine ascribed to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas is, \\"The power of the tathƒÅgatas is unlimited, and the life of the buddhas is unlimited.\\"Tanaka, Kenneth. The Dawn of Chinese Pure Land Buddhist Doctrine. 1990. p. 8 According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through his skillful means (Skt. upƒÅya).Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 53 For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was merely one of these transformation bodies (Skt. nirmƒÅ·πáakƒÅya), while the essential real Buddha was equated with the DharmakƒÅya.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 59-60 The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra makes numerous supramundane claims about the Buddha, including that: * He was not produced through union of father and mother, but magically produced. * His feet never touch the ground or get dirty, his footprints are only a show. * His body and mouth does not get dirty, he only makes a show of cleaning himself. * He did not really suffer and struggle to attain enlightenment for six years, this was just a show. * He never gets hungry, he only manifests this in order to allow others to gain merit by giving. * He does not really produce human waste, this is only a show. * His body does not grow tired, ill or old, and is not affected by cold or heat, it only appears to have these qualities. Like the MahƒÅyƒÅna traditions, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas held the doctrine of the existence of many contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 65 In the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika LokƒÅnuvartana S≈´tra, it is stated, \\"The Buddha knows all the dharmas of the countless buddhas of the ten directions.\\" It is also stated, \\"All buddhas have one body, the body of the Dharma.\\" In the view of MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, advanced bodhisattvas have severed the bonds of karma, and are born out of their own free will into lower states of existence (Skt. durgati) in order to help liberate other sentient beings. As described by Akira Hirakawa:Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. p. 182 The concept of many bodhisattvas simultaneously working toward buddhahood is also found among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika tradition, and further evidence of this is given in the Samayabhedoparacanacakra, which describes the doctrines of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. p. 66 These two concepts of contemporaneous bodhisattvas and contemporaneous buddhas were linked in some traditions, and texts such as the MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅupade≈õa use the principle of contemporaneous bodhisattvas to demonstrate the necessity of contemporaneous buddhas throughout the ten directions.Guang Xing. The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory. 2004. pp. 65-66 It is thought that the doctrine of contemporaneous buddhas was already old and well established by the time of early MahƒÅyƒÅna texts such as the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra, due to the clear presumptions of this doctrine. =Mundane and supramundane= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas held that the teachings of the Buddha were to be understood as having two principal levels of truth: a relative or conventional (Skt. sa·πÉv·πõti) truth, and the absolute or ultimate (Skt. paramƒÅrtha) truth. For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism, the final and ultimate meaning of the Buddha's teachings was \\"beyond words,\\" and words were merely the conventional exposition of the Dharma.Buescher, John. Echoes from an Empty Sky: The Origins of the Buddhist Doctrine of the Two Truths. 2005. p. 46 K. Venkata Ramanan writes:Ramanan, K. Venkata. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's Philosophy. 1998. pp. 62-63 Texts According to Bart Dessein, the Mohe sengzhi lu (MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya) provides some insight into the format of this school's textual canon. They appear to have had a Vinaya in five parts, an Abhidharmapi·π≠aka, and a Sutrapi·π≠aka: > Of these texts, their Vinaya was translated into Chinese by Buddhabhadra and > Faxian between 416 and 418 CE in the Daochang Monastery in Nanjing, capital > of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. In this text, their Abhidharma is defined as > \\"the s≈´trƒÅnta in nine parts\\" (navƒÅ·πÖga). This suggests that the early > MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas rejected the abhidharmic developments that occurred within > SarvƒÅstivƒÅda circles. As is the case with their Vinayapi·π≠aka, also their > Sutrapi·π≠aka seems to have consisted of five parts (ƒÅgama): > *Dƒ´rghƒÅgama,*MadhyamƒÅgama,*Sa·πÉyuktƒÅgama, *EkottarƒÅgama and *K·π£udrakƒÅgama. Dessein also mentions that the school probably also had a Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, which included material that \\"in all likelihood consisted of texts that formed part of the early development of the bodhisattva path as an alternative career to that of the arhant, perhaps serving as a foundation for the later developments of the bodhisattva doctrine\\". =Abhidharma= According to some sources, abhidharma was not accepted as canonical by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school.\\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008. The TheravƒÅdin Dƒ´pava·πÉsa, for example, records that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas had no abhidharma.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 213 However, other sources indicate that there were such collections of abhidharma. During the early 5th century, the Chinese pilgrim Faxian is said to have found a MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika abhidharma at a monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra. When Xuanzang visited DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he wrote that the monks of this region were MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and mentions the P≈´rva≈õailas specifically.Baruah, Bibhuti. Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism. 2008. p. 437 Near DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he met two MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika bhik·π£us and studied MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika abhidharma with them for several months, during which time they also studied various MahƒÅyƒÅna ≈õƒÅstras together under Xuanzang's direction. On the basis of textual evidence as well as inscriptions at NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ, Joseph Walser concludes that at least some MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sects probably had an abhidharma collection, and that it likely contained five or six books.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 212-213 = MahƒÅvastu = The MahƒÅvastu (Sanskrit for \\"Great Event\\" or \\"Great Story\\") is the most well known of the LokottaravƒÅda branch of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school. It is a preface to their Vinaya Pitaka and contains numerous JƒÅtaka and AvadƒÅna tales, stories of past lives of the Buddha and other bodhisattvas.\\"MahƒÅvastu\\" (2008). It is considered a primary source for the notion of a transcendent (lokottara) Buddha, who across his countless past lives developed various abilities such as omniscience (sarvaj√±ana), the lack of any need for sleep or food and being born painlessly without the need for intercourse.Williams (1989/2007), pp. 18‚Äì19 The text shows strong parallels with the Pali Mahakhandhaka. = Sariputrapariprccha = The ≈öariputraparip·πõcchƒÅ (Shelifu Wen Jing, ËàçÂà©ÂºóÂïèÁ∂ì, Taisho 1465, p. 900b), translated into Chinese between 317 and 420, is a Mahasamghika Vinaya work which also provides a history of early Buddhism and its schisms.Lamotte, Etienne, History of Indian Buddhism: From the Origins to the Saka Era, p. 189. = LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra = The LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ s≈´tra (Chinese: ‰ΩõË™¨ÂÜÖËóèÁôæÂØ∂Á∂ì, pinyin : f√≥shu≈ç n√®i z√†ng b«éi b«éo jƒ´ng) is a text preserved in some Sanskrit fragments as well as in Tibetan and Chinese translation. It is one of three texts belonging to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika in the Chinese Buddhist canon (Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka , Volume 17, text No. 807).Xing, Guang, The LokƒÅnuvartanƒÅ S≈´tra, Journal of Buddhist Studies,Vol IV, 2006. = Satyasiddhisastra = The Tattvasiddhi-≈öƒÅstra (\\"the treatise that accomplishes reality\\"; C: ÊàêÂØ¶Ë´ñ, Chengshilun), is an Abhidharma work by a figure known as Harivarman (250-350). Some scholars including A.K. Warder, attribute the work to the Bahusrutiyas, however others disagree and see it as a Sautrantika work.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism, page 398.Lin, Qian. Mind in Dispute: The Section on Mind in Harivarman‚Äôs *Tattvasiddhi, University of Washington Chinese sources mention that he was initially a Sautrantika teacher who later lived with the Mahasamghikas. = Manuscript Collections = The Chinese Buddhist monk Xuanzang visited a MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda vihara in the 7th century at Bamyan, Afghanistan, and this monastery site has since been rediscovered by archaeologists. Birch bark manuscripts and palm-leaf manuscripts of texts in this monastery's collection, including Mahayana sutras, have been discovered at the site, and these are now located in the Sch√∏yen Collection. Some manuscripts are in the GƒÅndhƒÅrƒ´ language and Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ script, while others are in Sanskrit and written in forms of the Gupta script. Manuscripts and fragments that have survived from this monastery's collection include the following source texts: * PrƒÅtimok·π£a Vibha·πÖga of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda (MS 2382/269) * MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, a sutra from the ƒÄgamas (MS 2179/44) * Ca·πÉgƒ´ S≈´tra, a s≈´tra from the ƒÄgamas (MS 2376) * Diamond Sutra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2385) * Bhai·π£ajyaguru S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2385) * ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * PravƒÅra·πáa S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * Sarvadharmaprav·πõttinirde≈õa S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * AjƒÅta≈õatrukauk·πõtyavinodana S≈´tra, a Mahayana sutra (MS 2378) * ≈öƒÅriputrƒÅbhidharma (MS 2375/08) Relationship to MahƒÅyƒÅna Sculpture of the Buddha from Mathura. 5th or 6th century CE =Acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna= In the 6th century CE, ParamƒÅrtha, a Buddhist monk from Ujjain in central India, wrote about a special affiliation of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school with the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition. He associates the initial composition and acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 50 He states that 200 years after the parinirvƒÅ·πáa of the Buddha, much of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school moved north of RƒÅjag·πõha, and were divided over whether the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings should be incorporated formally into their Tripi·π≠aka. According to this account, they split into three groups based upon the relative manner and degree to which they accepted the authority of these MahƒÅyƒÅna texts.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 51 ParamƒÅrtha states that the Kukku·π≠ika sect did not accept the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as buddhavacana (\\"words of the Buddha\\"), while the LokottaravƒÅda sect and the EkavyƒÅvahƒÅrika sect did accept the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as buddhavacana.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 68. Paramartha's report states: > In this school, there were some who believed these sutras and some who did > not. Those who did not believe them . . . said that such sutras are made by > man and are not proclaimed by the Buddha, . . . that the disciples of the > Lesser Vehicle only believe in the Tripitaka, because they did not > personally hear the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle. Among those who > believed these sutras, there were some who did so because they had > personally heard the Buddha proclaim the Greater Vehicle and therefore > believed these sutras; others believed them, because it can be known through > logical analysis that there is this principle [of the Greater Vehicle]; and > some believed them because they believed their masters. Those who did not > believe [them] did so because these sutras were self-made and because they > were not included in the five Agamas.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism > in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 153-154 ParamƒÅrtha also wrote about the origins of the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect in connection with acceptance of MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings. According to his account, the founder of the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect was named YƒÅj√±avalkya.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 267 In ParamƒÅrtha's account, YƒÅj√±avalkya is said to have lived during the time of the Buddha, and to have heard his discourses, but was in a profound state of samƒÅdhi during the time of the Buddha's parinirvƒÅ·πáa. After YƒÅj√±avalkya emerged from this samƒÅdhi 200 years later, he discovered that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas were teaching only the superficial meaning of the s≈´tras, and therefore founded the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya sect in order to expound the full meaning. According to ParamƒÅrtha, the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya school was formed in order to fully embrace both \\"conventional truth\\" and \\"ultimate truth.\\"Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 52 Bart Dessein links the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya understanding of this full exposition to the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 61 In his writings, ParamƒÅrtha also indicated as much:Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. pp. 51-52 =Royal patronage= Some early MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras reference wealthy female donors and provide evidence that they were developed in the ƒÄndhra region, where the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Caitika groups were predominant. The MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅmegha S≈´tra, for example, gives a prophecy about a royal princess of the ≈öatavƒÅhana dynasty who will live in ƒÄndhra, along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River, in DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, seven hundred years after the parinirvƒÅ·πáa of the Buddha. Several scholars such as √âtienne Lamotte, and Alex and Hideko Wayman, associate the ƒÄndra Ik·π£vƒÅku dynasty with patronage of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Osto, Douglas. Power, Wealth and Women in Indian MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha- s≈´tra 2011. pp. 114-115 Epigraphic evidence at NƒÅgƒÅrjuniko·πá·∏ça also provides abundant evidence of royal and wealthy female donors. =Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ= A number of scholars have proposed that the MahƒÅyƒÅna Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ teachings were first developed by the Caitika subsect of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. They believe that the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra originated amongst the southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools of the ƒÄndhra region, along the K·πõ·π£·πáa River. Guang Xing states, \\"Several scholars have suggested that the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ probably developed among the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas in southern India, in the ƒÄndhra country, on the K·πõ·π£·πáa River.\\" These MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas had two famous monasteries near AmarƒÅvati and the DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, which gave their names to the schools of the P≈´rva≈õailas and the Apara≈õailas. Each of these schools had a copy of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra in Prakrit. Guang Xing also assesses the view of the Buddha given in the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra as being that of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. Edward Conze estimates that this s≈´tra originated around 100 BCE. =TathƒÅgatagarbha= Cave complex associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika sect. Karla Caves, MahƒÅrƒÅ·π£tra, India Brian Edward Brown, a specialist in TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrines, writes that it has been determined that the composition of the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra occurred during the ƒ™k·π£vƒÅku Dynasty in the 3rd century as a product of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region (i.e. the Caitika schools).Brown, Brian Edward. The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅ, along with four major arguments for this association. Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and concludes that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region were responsible for the inception of the TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrine.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. pp. 155-156 According to Stephen Hodge, internal textual evidence in the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, MahƒÅbherihƒÅraka Parivarta S≈´tra, and the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra, indicates that these texts were first circulated in South India and then gradually propagated up to the northwest, with Kashmir being the other major center. The A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra gives a more detailed account by mentioning the points of distribution as including South India, the Vindhya Range, Bharuch, and Kashmir. The language used in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and related texts, seems to indicate a region in southern India during the time of the ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana Dynasty. The ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana rulers gave rich patronage to Buddhism, and were involved with the development of the cave temples at Karla and Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ, and also with the Great St≈´pa at AmarƒÅvati. During this time, the ≈öƒÅtavƒÅhana Dynasty also maintained extensive links with the Ku·π£ƒÅ·πáa Empire. Using textual evidence in the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and related texts, Stephen Hodge estimates a compilation period between 100 CE and 220 CE for the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra. Hodge summarizes his findings as follows: In the 6th century CE, ParamƒÅrtha wrote that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas revere the s≈´tras which teach the TathƒÅgatagarbha. =Bodhisattva canons= Within the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch, the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas are said to have included a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka in their canon, and ParamƒÅrtha wrote that the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas accepted both the Hƒ´nayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings. In the 6th century CE, BhƒÅvaviveka speaks of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the P≈´rva≈õailas and Apara≈õailas both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, all implying collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka,\\" which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Da≈õabh≈´mika S≈´tra. =Views of scholars= Since at least the Meiji period in Japan, some scholars of Buddhism have looked to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika as the originators of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism.Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. p. 380 According to Akira Hirakawa, modern scholars often look to the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas as the originators of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism.Williams, Paul. The Origins and Nature of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. 2004. pp. 181-2 According to A.K. Warder, it is \\"clearly\\" the case that the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings originally came from the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 11 Warder holds that \\"the MahƒÅyƒÅna originated in the south of India and almost certainly in the ƒÄndhra country.\\"Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 313 Anthony Barber and Sree Padma note that \\"historians of Buddhist thought have been aware for quite some time that such pivotally important Mahayana Buddhist thinkers as NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, Dignaga, Candrakƒ´rti, ƒÄryadeva, and Bhavaviveka, among many others, formulated their theories while living in Buddhist communities in ƒÄndhra.\\"Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 1 Andr√© Bareau has stated that there can be found MahƒÅyƒÅna ontology prefigured in the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools, and has offered an array of evidence to support this conclusion.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 426 Bareau traces the origin of the MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition to the older MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools in regions such as Odisha, Kosala, Ko√±kana, and so on. He then cites the Bahu≈õrutƒ´yas and Praj√±aptivƒÅdins as sub-sects of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika that may have played an important role in bridging the flow of MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings between the northern and southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika traditions. Andr√© Bareau also mentions that according to Xuanzang and Yijing in the 7th century CE, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools had essentially disappeared, and instead these travelers found what they described as \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna.\\" The region occupied by the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika was then an important center for MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism. Bareau has proposed that MahƒÅyƒÅna grew out of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools, and the members of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools also accepted the teachings of the MahƒÅyƒÅna. Additionally, the extant MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at what he describes as a \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna\\" monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 40 Vinaya Recension Cave temple associated with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas. Ellora Caves =Early features= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya recension is essentially very similar to the other recensions, as they all are to each other. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika recension differs most from the other recensions in structure, but the rules are generally identical in meaning, if the Vibhangas (explanations) are compared. The features of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya recension which suggest that it might be an older redaction are, in brief, these: The Bhiksu-prakirnaka and Bhiksuni- prakirnaka and the Bhiksu-abhisamacarika-dharma sections of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya are generally equivalent to the Khandhakas/ Skandhakas of the Sthavira derived schools. However, their structure is simpler, and according to recent research by Clarke, the structure follows a matika (Matrix) which is also found embedded in the Vinayas of several of the Sthavira schools, suggesting that it is presectarian. The sub-sections of the Prakirnaka sections are also titled pratisamyukta rather than Skandhaka / Khandhaka. Pratisamyukta / Patisamyutta means a section or chapter in a collection organised by subject; the 'samyukta-principle', like the Samyutta-Nikaya / Samyukta-agama. Scholars such as Master Yin Shun, Choong Moon Keat, and Bhikkhu Sujato have argued that the Samyutta / Samyukta represents the earliest collection among the Nikayas / Agamas, and this may well imply that it is also the oldest organising principle too. (N.B. this does not necessarily say anything about the age of the contents). There are also fewer stories in general in the Vinaya of the subsidiary school, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika-LokottaravƒÅda, and many of them give the appearance of badly connected obvious interpolations, whereas in the structure of the Sthavira recensions the stories are integrated into the whole scheme. In the formulations of some of the pratimoksha rules also, the phrasing (though generally identical in meaning to the other recensions) often appears to represent a clearer but less streamlined version, which suggests it might be older. This is particularly noticeable in the Bhiksuni-Vinaya, which has not been as well preserved as the Bhiksu-Vinaya in general in all the recensions. Yet the formulation of certain rules which seem very confused in the other recensions (e.g. Bhikkhuni Sanghadisesa three = six in the Ma-L) seems to better represent what would be expected of a root formulation which could lead to the variety of confused formulations we see (presumably later) in the other recensions. The formulation of this rule (as an example) also reflects a semi-parallel formulation to a closely related rule for Bhiksus which is found in a more similar form in all the Vinayas (Pc64 in Pali). =Depiction of Devadatta= According to Reginald Ray, the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya mentions the figure of Devadatta, but in a way that is different from the vinayas of the Sthavira branch. According to this study, the earliest vinaya material common to all sects simply depicts Devadatta as a Buddhist saint who wishes for the monks to live a rigorous lifestyle.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. p. 168 This has led Ray to regard the story of Devadatta as a legend produced by the Sthavira group.Ray, Reginald. Buddhist Saints in India: A Study in Buddhist Values and Orientations. 1999. pp. 169-170 However, upon examining the same vinaya materials, Bhikkhu Sujato has written that the portrayals of Devadatta are largely consistent between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya and the other vinayas, and that the supposed discrepancy is simply due to the minimalist literary style of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya. He also points to other parts of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya that clearly portray Devadatta as a villain, as well as similar portrayals that exist in the LokottaravƒÅdin MahƒÅvastu. =Chinese translation= The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya is extant in the Chinese Buddhist Canon as Mohesengzhi L√º (Êë©Ë®∂ÂÉßÁ•óÂæã; Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka 1425). The vinaya was originally procured by Faxian in the early 5th century CE at a MahƒÅyƒÅna monastery in PƒÅ·π≠aliputra. This vinaya was then translated into Chinese as a joint effort between Faxian and Buddhabhadra in 416 CE, and the completed translation is 40 fascicles in length.Rulu. Bodhisattva Precepts. 2012. p. 7 According to Faxian, in Northern India, the vinaya teachings were typically only passed down by tradition through word of mouth and memorization. For this reason, it was difficult for him to procure manuscripts of the vinayas that were used in India. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was reputed to be the original vinaya from the lifetime of the Buddha, and \\"the most correct and complete.\\"Beal, Samuel (tr.). Travels of Fa-hian, or Fo-kw≈è-ki. 1885. p. lxxi =Legacy= Although Faxian procured the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya in India and had this translated into Chinese, the tradition of Chinese Buddhism eventually settled on the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya instead. At the time of Faxian, the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was the most common vinaya tradition in China. In the 7th century, Yijing wrote that in eastern China, most people followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya, while the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika Vinaya was used in earlier times in Guanzhong (the region around Chang'an), and that the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya was prominent in the Yangzi region and further south.Mohr, Thea. Tsedroen, Jampa. Dignity and Discipline: Reviving Full Ordination for Buddhist Nuns. 2010. p. 187 In the 7th century, the existence of multiple Vinaya lineages throughout China was criticized by prominent Vinaya masters such as Yijing and Dao'an (654‚Äì717). In the early 8th century, Dao'an gained the support of Emperor Zhongzong of Tang, and an imperial edict was issued that the sa·πÉgha in China should use only the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya for ordination.Heirman, Ann. Bumbacher, Stephan Peter. The Spread of Buddhism. 2007. pp. 194-195 Ati≈õa was ordained in the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika lineage. However, because the Tibetan Emperor Ralpacan had decreed that only the M≈´lasarvƒÅstivƒÅda order would be permitted in Tibet, he did not ordain anyone.

The river eventually breached the bridge and washed much of it away, but the event is remembered in local legends of the Native Americans as the Bridge of the Gods. Greenleaf Peak and the Bonneville landslide from Bonneville Dam The Bridge of the Gods is also the name of a modern manmade bridge, across the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington. The southern face of Greenleaf Peak The southern face of Table Mountain Geologic history Interpretations of the age of the Bonneville landslide have evolved as more investigators have studied it and as more modern dating techniques have become available. Early work based on dendrochronology and radiocarbon dating suggested the landslide occurred between AD 1060 and 1180 or between 1250 and 1280. The year 1100 has often been cited as the date of the Bonneville landslide. More recent work using radiocarbon dating and lichenometry has suggested dates between 1500 and 1760 or between 1670 and 1760. These younger radiocarbon ages permitted a possible link to the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. However, more recent investigations using radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology show the landslide occurred around 1450, that could be associated with an earlier great earthquake that occurred in the mid-fifteenth century. The Bonneville landslide sent a large amount of debris south from Table Mountain and Greenleaf Peak, covering more than . The debris slid into the Columbia Gorge close to modern-day Cascade Locks, Oregon, blocking the Columbia River with a natural dam approximately high and long. The impounded river formed a lake and drowned a forest of trees for about . Native Americans might have crossed the river on the dam or, as their oral histories say, a bridge. Although no one knows how long it took, the Columbia River eventually broke through the dam and washed away most of the debris, forming the Cascades Rapids, themselves submerged in 1938 by the construction of the Bonneville Dam. Geologists have determined that debris from several distinct landslides in the same area overlap, forming what is called the Cascades landslide complex. The Bonneville landslide was the most recent, and perhaps the largest landslide of the complex. Studies to understand the nature of the landslide complex and to map the lobes of individual landslide events were undertaken during the 1960s and 1970s. The composite nature of the landslide complex may explain the early discrepancies between date estimates of the Bonneville Landslide. Native American legend Native American lore contains numerous legends to explain the eruptions of Mount St. Helens and other volcanoes in the Cascade Volcanic Arc. The most famous of these is the Bridge of the Gods legend told by the Klickitats. In their tale, the chief of all the gods, Tyhee Saghalie and his two sons, Pahto (also called Klickitat) and Wy'east, traveled down the Columbia River from the Far North in search of a suitable area to settle.Archie Satterfield, Country Roads of Washington (Backinprint.com: 2003) , page 82 They came upon an area that is now called The Dalles and thought they had never seen a land so beautiful. The sons quarreled over the land and to solve the dispute, their father shot two arrows from his mighty bow; one to the north and the other to the south. Pahto followed the arrow to the north and settled there while Wy'east did the same for the arrow to the south. Saghalie then built Tanmahawis, the Bridge of the Gods, so his family could meet periodically. When the two sons of Saghalie both fell in love with a beautiful maiden named Loowit, she could not choose between them. The two young chiefs fought over her, burying villages and forests in the process. The area was devastated and the earth shook so violently that the huge bridge fell into the river, creating the Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River Gorge.The Bridge of the Gods, theoutlaws.com (accessed 26 November 2006) For punishment, Saghalie struck down each of the lovers and transformed them into great mountains where they fell. Wy'east, with his head lifted in pride, became the volcano known today as Mount Hood, and Pahto, with his head bent toward his fallen love, was turned into Mount Adams. The fair Loowit became Mount St. Helens, known to the Klickitats as Louwala-Clough which means \\"smoking or fire mountain\\" in their language (the Sahaptin called the mountain Loowit).

He presented Family Fortunes from 1987 until 2002. Early life Dennis was born Leslie Dennis Heseltine on 12 October 1953 in the Garston suburb of Liverpool. His mother worked in a factory while his father, who worked in a betting shop after serving in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, was listed as a football player on the books of Liverpool FC but did not play for the first team. He lived in the suburb of Speke for a while and attended the Stockton Wood and Joseph Williams primary schools, before going on to attend Quarry Bank High School upon passing his 11-plus, by which time his family had moved to the suburb of Childwall. He had a weekend job in the men's clothing store Burton while in school, and started as a stand-up comedian in working men's clubs. Career =Early work and Family Fortunes= As a comedian, Dennis performed in social clubs all around the northwest of England. He was given his earliest opportunities in his home city of Liverpool, later crediting husband-and-wife theatrical agents Stuart and Dorene Gillespie (who had themselves been a successful variety act) with discovering him in his autobiography. His debut radio broadcast was in 1971 on Stuart's BBC Radio Merseyside series Variety Time (the programmes were taped in front of a live audience in Merseyside clubs). In 1974, he won the ITV talent show New Faces and appeared on numerous light entertainment shows. He almost became the first contestant ever to score the maximum 120 points on New Faces, but had to settle for 119 when Tony Hatch gave him 9 out of 10 in his final mark, drawing derision from the rest of a judges panel that included fellow Liverpool comedian Arthur Askey. In 1982, Dennis joined as one of the teams on Russ Abbot's Madhouse and The Russ Abbot Show before forming a comedy partnership with fellow impressionist Dustin Gee, which in turn led to a series of their own, The Laughter Show. Following Gee's sudden and unexpected death in January 1986, Dennis carried on The Laughter Show as a solo performer and became the third host of Family Fortunes for a 15-year run between 1987 and 2002. It was at a recording of an episode of Family Fortunes in 1997 that Dennis was surprised by This Is Your Life. When a contestant on Family Fortunes gave a particularly silly answer to a survey question, Dennis would sometimes say, \\"If it's [the answer] up there, I'll give you the money myself!\\" His Liverpudlian accent famously led him to pronounce \\"myself\\" as \\"meself\\", which soon made the sentence his catchphrase. This backfired on an episode where a contestant was asked to \\"name a way of toasting someone\\" and the contestant answered \\"over fire\\", which matched with \\"grill\\" for ¬£12; according to an anonymous source, Dennis made good on his promise and provided the prize money himself. =Theatre= Dennis' stage work includes Amos Hart in Chicago and Bill Snibson in Me and My Girl in the West End. He has starred in Skylight at the Water Mill Theatre in Newbury, Mr Wonderful at the Gateway Theatre in Chester, and Misery at the Coliseum Theatre in Oldham. He also appeared in Just Between Ourselves and co-starred alongside Janet Suzman in Cherished Disappointments in Love at London's Soho Theatre. He co-starred with Christopher Cazenove and John Duttine in a national tour of Art and as Norman Bartholomew in Anthony Shaffer's dark comedy Murderer at London's Menier Chocolate Factory. He later starred in a hit season of Neville's Island at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Dennis appeared as Mr. Fulton in High School Musical 2 on a UK tour from August 2009 to February 2010. He toured in Hairspray as Wilbur Turnblad alongside Michael Ball, Brian Conley and Michael Starke ‚Äì who alternated the role of Edna Turnblad. He starred in the touring production of Legally Blonde The Musical in 2012, playing the role of Professor Callahan. In 2017, Dennis played the role of Uncle Fester on the UK tour of the musical production of The Addams Family. The production starred Samantha Womack and Carrie Hope Fletcher and was produced by James Yeoburn and Stuart Matthew Price for United Theatrical, Katy Lipson for Aria Entertainment and Music & Lyrics in association with Festival Theatre, Edinburgh. In 2019, Dennis performed with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Restoration plays The Provoked Wife and Venice Preserved. =Early film and TV= Dennis' film debut was in the 1996 film Intimate Relations. He also appeared in the comedy film Large and Wildlife, a short film directed by Nick Allsop. He had previously made appearances on two episodes of Bang Bang, It's Reeves and Mortimer in The \\"Club\\" sketch, where he played himself. When he took part in a video-only special of Shooting Stars in 1993, Vic Reeves when introducing him pronounced his name as though it were French, saying \\"Les Dennis, the French fire engine\\". Dennis has appeared in Brookside (as Jeff Evans; 2001) and episodes of Merseybeat, Family Affairs, Casualty, the short-lived revival of Crossroads, and Hotel Babylon. =Big Brother= Dennis appeared in the second series of the UK Celebrity Big Brother during the period when his marriage to Amanda Holden was breaking down again ‚Äì he described his time in the BB House as \\"not one of his wisest moves\\", although he went on to finish as runner-up to Mark Owen. =2005‚Äì2007= On 11 August 2005 Dennis appeared as a guest star in an episode of the first series of BBC sitcom Extras, written by and starring Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. In this appearance, Dennis portrayed a fictional version of himself, alongside Gerard Kelly, who played a camp theatre director, the recurring character Bunny. Dennis would go on to say that \\"you could say Extras changed my life.\\" In early 2006, Dennis presented and performed in BBC One's The Sound of Musicals and guested in New Street Law on BBC One. In summer 2006, he played scriptwriter Nick Chase in a new comedy play called Marlon Brando's Corset, which toured the UK from July 2006, including a month-long run at the Edinburgh Fringe. He appeared as a guest in August 2006 on the ITV drama series, The Bill starring as a man suspected of murdering his father. Dennis appeared alongside fellow former Russ Abbot performer Lisa Maxwell, who played D.I. Samantha Nixon in the series. At the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival, it was announced Dennis would make a return to the gameshow genre, presenting a new big-money quiz show titled In the Grid for Channel 5. The show debuted on 30 October 2006 and aired for one series. From April 2007, he also hosted UKTV Gold's TV Now and Then quiz show. The same month he guest-starred on BBC One's Holby City. He appeared on The Friday Night Project as a panellist on \\"Who knows the most about the guest host?\\" when Rupert Everett guest hosted. In theatre Dennis guest-starred as narrator in Side by Side by Sondheim at the Venue, London. As one of the team, he completed running the Safaricom Marathon in Lewa to raise funds for the BBC Wildlife Fund, screened on BBC One's Saving Planet Earth in July 2007. In August 2007, he starred in the hit play Certified Male‚Äîabout the highs and lows of modern manhood‚Äîat the Edinburgh Festival. He then toured in The Servant of Two Masters, directed by Michael Bogdanov and at Christmas he returned to pantomime after a ten-year break, co- starring in Cinderella with Hollywood veteran Mickey Rooney at the Empire Theatre, Sunderland, produced by First Family Entertainment. =2008‚Äì2012= Dennis's autobiography, Must The Show Go On?, was published by Orion in early 2008. In April 2008, Dennis toured in Eurobeat Almost Eurovision prior to a West End season in the show. Also in 2008, he narrated the home video clip show on Challenge, Les Dennis's Home Video Heroes, and appeared in the ITV documentary Les Dennis' Liverpool, which was, coincidentally, broadcast a week after BBC Two ran Alexei Sayle's Liverpool, a three-part documentary on the city. During Christmas 2008 panto season, Dennis appeared as Buttons in Cinderella at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool. The pantomime also featured Jennifer Ellison as Cinderella, and Cilla Black as the Fairy Godmother. At Christmas 2008, Les was featured on the Wombats' Christmas single and video Is This Christmas? in aid of MENCAP. Dennis was a celebrity player on Alan Carr's Celebrity Ding Dong in 2008; he began the episode by mentioning how the set was a ripoff of the Family Fortunes set, only to have Alan Carr interrupt him by making an \\"X\\" with his arms and imitating the infamous \\"UH-UHH!\\" sound. In 2009, Dennis played Herbert Soppitt in J. B. Priestley's When We Are Married at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds and the Playhouse, Liverpool. At Christmas 2009, he returned to the Liverpool Empire to appear in Peter Pan with Fonz actor Henry Winkler and again in 2010 to play the role of Aladdin's brother, Wishee Washee in Aladdin. As of 2010, Dennis presents the children's TV series Fee Fi Fo Yum for CBBC. From 17 October 2011, Dennis started a week- long stint in Countdowns Dictionary Corner, ending on 21 October. In 2011 he again worked with Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, with recurring appearances as a fictionalised version of himself in the Warwick Davis comedy series, Life's Too Short. From August 2012, he performed in the play Jigsy at the Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) as part of the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. =2013‚Äìpresent= In 2013 Dennis was reunited with Warwick Davis when the pair joined the cast of the West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at London's Playhouse Theatre. His next theatrical appearance came in an adaptation of Peter James' novella The Perfect Murder\\". In 2013, Dennis was a contestant in Celebrity MasterChef. He finished as runner-up to Ade Edmondson. He has since returned to the show as a guest judge. In December of that year Dennis appeared in an episode of Midsomer Murders titled \\"The Christmas Haunting\\". =Coronation Street= On 23 January 2014, it was announced that Dennis would join the long-running ITV soap opera Coronation Street, playing the part of Michael Rogers (later changed to Michael Rodwell after press release), a petty burglar. He began filming on 27 January 2014, and made his first appearance on TV on 24 March 2014. The show's producer Stuart Blackburn said: \\"Les is a fantastic performer and a real coup for Corrie. I can't wait for him to join the team\\". On 18 November 2016, Dennis's character Michael Rodwell was killed off from Coronation Street, after suffering a heart attack and being left for dead by the show's villain, Michael's love rival Pat Phelan. =After Coronation Street= In April 2017, Dennis took the role of Uncle Fester in The Addams Family UK tour. Personal life Dennis has a son named Philip from his first marriage to Lynne Webster, which lasted from 1974 to 1990. He also had an affair with actress Sophie Aldred, which he documented in his autobiography. He married actress Amanda Holden on 4 June 1995. They had a temporary split in 2000 when Holden's affair with actor Neil Morrissey was exposed in the press, before eventually separating in December 2002 and divorcing in 2003. Dennis met Claire Nicholson in 2005. The couple have a daughter, Eleanor Grace, who was born on 24 April 2008. They were married on 23 November 2009 in Highgate. Their son, Thomas Christopher, was born on 14 April 2011. Dennis is a lifelong Liverpool FC fan.

An alternative is to bend the flaps back and tie them behind the head, which is called \\"ski-style\\" ‚Äî this offers less protection from the elements, but much better visibility, essential for high-speed skiing. The dense fur also offers some protection against blunt impacts to the head. The word derives from (), \\"ears\\" in Russian and many Slavic languages.  Basic materials  Ushankas are often made from inexpensive sheepskin (tsigeyka, :ru:–¶–∏–≥–µ–π–∫–∞), rabbit or muskrat fur. Artificial fur hats are also manufactured and are referred to as \\"fish fur\\" since the material is not from any real animal. The simplest \\"fish fur\\" of ushankas was made of wool pile with cloth substrate and cloth top, with the exception of the flaps, which had the pile exposed. Mink fur ushankas are widely used in the Arctic regions of Russia, protecting the ears and chin of the wearer even from \\"deep frost\\", which is around .

Such hats are also seen in Scandinavian countries Sweden and Norway, in the Eurasian and European Slavic countries Russia, Ukraine, Slovenia, and in Caucasus region in Georgia and Armenia. The design of ushanka with a perfectly round crown was developed in the 17th century when in central and northern Russia a hat with earflaps called treukh was worn. The modern ushanka design from 1917 is also inspired by the Norwegian norvezhka, a hat which was invented by Norwegian arctic explorers. The main difference from the treukh is that the earflaps of the norvezhka were much longer. In addition, Russian Cossacks of the Kuban have influenced the design of modern Ushanka through interaction with peoples from Central Asia and Caucasus. In 1917 During the Russian Civil War, the ruler of Siberia, Aleksandr Kolchak, introduced a winter uniform hat, commonly referred to as a kolchakovka, c. 1918. It was similar to the ushanka. In 1933, W. C. Fields wore a kolchakovka in the short film The Fatal Glass of Beer. However, Kolchak and the White Army lost the war, and their headgear was not adopted in the new Soviet Union. Red Army soldiers instead wore the budenovka, which was made of felt. It was designed to resemble historical bogatyr helmets, and did not provide much protection from the cold. During the Winter War against Finland, organizational failures and inadequate equipment left many Soviet troops vulnerable to cold, and many died of exposure. The Finnish army had much better equipment including an ushanka-style fur hat, the turkislakki M36, introduced in 1936. In 1939, shortly before the Winter War, the slightly improved turkislakki M39 was introduced, and is still in use today. After the winter war, the Red Army received completely redesigned winter uniforms. Budenovkas were finally replaced with ushankas based on the Finnish example. Officers were issued fur ushankas; other ranks received ushankas made with plush or \\"fish fur\\". When they experienced the harsh Russian winter, for example during the Battle of Moscow, German soldiers started to wear ushankas and other Soviet-type winter gear, as their uniforms did not provide adequate protection. WW2 ushanka presented in the Army museum (Russia) and Saumur tank museum (France). The ushanka became a symbol and media icon of the Soviet Union and later the Russian Federation. Photographs of U.S. President Gerald Ford wearing the cap during a 1974 visit to the Soviet Union were seen as a possible sign of d√©tente.

Gray (American civilian police), green (for camouflage), blue (police, United States Post Office) and black versions are in current usage. In 2013, the Russian army announced that the ushanka was being replaced by new headgear, which is essentially the same ushanka with a rounder crown and small sealable openings in the flaps for wearing headphones. The ushanka was used by the East German authorities before German reunification, and remained part of the German police uniform in winter afterwards. In the Finnish Defence Forces, a gray hat is used with M62 uniform and a green one of different design is a part of M91 and M05 winter dress. Armoured troops have a black hat (M92), while generals may wear a white M39 hat. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police use a \\"regulation hat\\" (between an ushanka and an aviator hat), made of muskrat fur. This replaced the former Astrakhan (hat). Similar ones are used by Toronto Transit Commission staff during winter. A similar type of headgear is worn in China's People's Liberation Army's winter uniform. Featured in an iconic image of Lei Feng, this type of hat is often called by Chinese \\"the Lei Feng hat\\" (Èõ∑ÈîãÂ∏Ω, Lei Feng mao).Èõ∑ÈîãÂ∏Ω (\\"Lei Feng hat\\") It is claimed that British wartime airmen visiting the Kola Inlet to help to protect the Arctic convoys quickly started to wear ushankas because their own uniform hats were not warm enough, but \\"kept the ear flaps tied up to the crown as any Russian would, because it was considered unmanly to wear them down.\\" However, in the Russian military up to this day, the way of wearing the ushanka ‚Äî up flaps, down flaps or ski-style ‚Äî is considered a part of uniform of the day and is usually decided by a unit commander at reveille, so the Russian soldiers aren't actually free about the way they wear their hats. A variant of the ushanka is popular in Norway, especially in the north. It is infamous for its name, \\"bj√∏rnefitte\\" (bear's vagina), which is considered vulgar in most parts of the country.  Similar hats  Trapper hats are \\"a sort of hybrid between the aviator cap and the ushanka‚Äîthey combine the style of the former with the furriness of the latter\\". They are considered more casual than the military- derived ushanka.

The \\"417\\" signifies that each pattern in the code consists of 4 bars and spaces in a pattern that is 17 units (modules) long. The PDF417 symbology was invented by Ynjiun P. Wang at Symbol Technologies in 1991. It is defined in ISO standard 15438. Applications PDF417 is used in many applications by both commercial and government organizations. PDF417 is one of the formats (along with Data Matrix) that can be used to print postage accepted by the United States Postal Service. PDF417 is also used by the airline industry's Bar Coded Boarding Pass (BCBP) standard as the 2D bar code symbolism for paper boarding passes. PDF417 is the standard selected by the Department of Homeland Security as the machine readable zone technology for RealID compliant driver licenses and state issued identification cards. PDF417 barcodes are also included on visas and border crossing cards issued by the State of Israel (example).  Features  In addition to features typical of two dimensional bar codes, PDF417's capabilities include: * Linking. PDF417 symbols can link to other symbols which are scanned in sequence allowing even more data to be stored. * User- specified dimensions. The user can decide how wide the narrowest vertical bar (X dimension) is, and how tall the rows are (Y dimension). * Public domain format. Anyone can implement systems using this format without any license.http://www.iso.org/iso/fr/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43816 The introduction of the ISO/IEC document states: ::Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and application standards. It is the intent and understanding of ISO/IEC that the symbology presented in this International Standard is entirely in the public domain and free of all user restrictions, licences and fees. Format right The PDF417 bar code (also called a symbol) consists of 3 to 90 rows, each of which is like a small linear bar code. Each row has: * a quiet zone. This is a mandated minimum amount of white space before the bar code begins. * a start pattern which identifies the format as PDF417. * a \\"row left\\" codeword containing information about the row (such as the row number and error correction level) * 1‚Äì30 data codewords: Codewords are a group of bars and spaces representing one or more numbers, letters, or other symbols. * a \\"row right\\" codeword with more information about the row. * a stop pattern. * another quiet zone. All rows are the same width; each row has the same number of codewords. =Codewords= PDF417 uses a base 929 encoding. Each codeword represents a number from 0 to 928. The codewords are represented by patterns of dark (bar) and light (space) regions. Each of these patterns contains four bars and four spaces (where the 4 in the name comes from). The total width is 17 times the width of the narrowest allowed vertical bar (the X dimension); this is where the 17 in the name comes from. Each pattern starts with a bar and ends with a space. The row height must be at least 3 times the minimum width: Y ‚â• 3 X., 5.8.2. There are three distinct bar-space patterns used to represent each codeword. These patterns are organized into three groups known as clusters. The clusters are labeled 0, 3, and 6. No bar-space pattern is used in more than one cluster. The rows of the symbol cycle through the three clusters, so row 1 uses patterns from cluster 0, row 2 uses cluster 3, row 3 uses cluster 6, and row 4 again uses cluster 0. Which cluster can be determined by an equation:, 5.3.1. :K = b_1 - b_2 + b_3 - b_4 + 9 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\pmod 9 Where K is the cluster number and the bi refer to the width of the i-th black bar in the symbol character (in X units). Alternatively, :K = E_1 - E_2 + E_5 - E_6 + 9 \\\\,\\\\, \\\\pmod 9 Where Ei is the i-th edge-to-next-same-edge distance. Odd indices are the leading edge of a bar to the leading edge of the next bar; even indices are for the trailing edges. One purpose of the three clusters is to determine which row (mod 3) the codeword is in. The clusters allow portions of the symbol to be read using a single scan line that may be skewed from the horizontal., 5.11.1. For instance, the scan might start on row 6 at the start of the row but end on row 10. At the beginning of the scan, the scanner sees the constant start pattern, and then it sees symbols in cluster 6. When the skewed scan straddles rows 6 and 7, then the scanner sees noise. When the scan is on row 7, the scanner sees symbols in cluster 0. Consequently, the scanner knows the direction of the skew. By the time the scanner reaches the right, it is on row 10, so it sees cluster 0 patterns. The scanner will also see a constant stop pattern. =Encoding= Of the 929 available code words, 900 are used for data, and 29 for special functions, such as shifting between major modes. The three major modes encode different types of data in different ways, and can be mixed as necessary within a single bar code: *Byte: each group of 5 code words represents 6 bytes. (Because 9005 > 2566.) Additional bytes are encoded one per code word. *Numeric: n digits are encoded in +1 code words, up to a maximum of 44 digits in 15 code words. *Text: Each code word represents two base-30 digits, which are used by a system of four submodes to represent the printable ASCII characters (plus CR, LF and HT): ** Uppercase: A-Z, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Lowercase: a-z, SP, Interpret next digit as uppercase, Change to mixed, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Mixed: 0-9, &, CR, HT, comma, :, #, -, period, $, /, +, %, *, =, ^, Change to punctuation, SP, Change to lowercase, Change to uppercase, Interpret next digit as punctuation ** Punctuation: ;, <, >, @, [, \\\\, ], _, \`, ~, !, CR, HT, comma, :, LF, -, period, $, /, \\", , *, (, ), ?, {, }, ', Change to uppercase =Error correction= When the PDF417 symbol is created, from 2 to 512 error detection and correction codewords are added. PDF417 uses Reed-Solomon error correction. When the symbol is scanned, the maximum number of corrections that can be made is equal to the number of codewords added, but the standard recommends that two codewords be held back to ensure reliability of the corrected information. Comparison with other symbologies PDF417 is a stacked barcode that can be read with a simple linear scan being swept over the symbol.For example, the Symbol Technologies LS-4000 series. Those linear scans need the left and right columns with the start and stop code words. Additionally, the scan needs to know what row it is scanning, so each row of the symbol must also encode its row number. Furthermore, the reader's line scan won't scan just a row; it will typically start scanning one row, but then cross over to a neighbor and possibly continuing on to cross successive rows. In order to minimize the effect of these crossings, the PDF417 modules are tall and narrow -- the height is typically three times the width. Also, each code word must indicate which row it belongs to so crossovers, when they occur, can be detected. The code words are also designed to be delta-decodable, so some code words are redundant. Each PDF data code word represents about 10 bits of information (log2(900) ‚âà 9.8), but the printed code word (character) is 17 modules wide. Including a height of 3 modules, a PDF417 code word takes 51 square modules to represent 10 bits. That area does not count other overhead such as the start, stop, row, format, and ECC information. Other 2D codes, such as DataMatrix and QR, are decoded with image sensors instead of uncoordinated linear scans. Those codes still need recognition and alignment patterns, but they do not need to be as prominent. An 8 bit code word will take 8 square modules (ignoring recognition, alignment, format, and ECC information). In practice, a PDF417 symbol takes about four times the area of a DataMatrix or QR Code.

They emphasized the transcendence of the Buddha, asserting that he was eternally enlightened and essentially non-physical.

In an interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Party's Over, Taaffe gave a few biographical details: \\"I came into contact with Socialist Fight in 1960\\" writes Taaffe.The Rise of Militant, p. 10 Socialist Fight was the newspaper of a small group of mainly (but not entirely) industrial militants in Liverpool going by the name of the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL), and led by Jimmy Deane and Ted Grant. Taaffe \\"does not subscribe to the view that the struggles of small groupings are of no historical significance\\".Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 9 This small group supported the ideas of Leon Trotsky, who proposed that genuine Marxism, followed by Lenin, had always argued that only the working class in the advanced capitalist countries could lead a revolution to establish socialism. These were the ideas to which Taaffe subscribed. Taaffe argues that, \\"There is a long tradition going right back to the 1930s and Trotsky himself, of Trotskyist groups and organisations which endeavoured to find a base within the labour movement and working class.\\"  Peter Taaffe and the Militant newspaper  In 1964, Taaffe writes that the \\"youth supporters of Militant\\" drew on their experiences gained during the 1960 Clydeside apprentices' strike in \\"seeking to organise and mobilise the Liverpool apprentices. Ted Mooney and I played leading roles, together with Harry Dowling and Dave Galashan, in organising an apprentices' strike in one factory, English Electric, on the East Lancashire Road.\\" About 20,000 of the 70,000 engineering apprentices downed tools in total.'The Rise of Militant' p. 20-21 By this time, the second issue of the Militant had come out. Earlier in 1964, Ted Grant, Liverpudlians Jimmy Deane (who was National Secretary) and Keith Dickenson, Ellis Hillman, John Smith, and others on the executive of the RSL decided to launch the Militant newspaper \\"without complete unanimity\\" Taaffe writes.Rise of Militant p. 17. Jimmy Deane was National Secretary until 1965. Before his death he made his minutes of these meetings available. cf http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/325col.htm Peter Taaffe, who lived in Liverpool at that time, was appointed editor.Jimmy Deane's minutes of these decisions. In op cit http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/325col.htm He recalled this time in the Radio 4 programme, The Party's Over: In 1965, Taaffe was able to move to London. He became full-time national secretary as well as editor of Militant, despite a serious shortage of money: \\"I was compelled first of all to sleep on the floor of a supporter in Balham... once or twice spending sleepless nights in the entrances of subways\\".The Rise of Militant, p. 11 Eventually, the group became known by the name of the paper, and was either referred to as Militant or the Militant tendency. Many of Peter Taaffe's major signed articles in Militant during the first few years were on international topics: the Congo, Dominica, Latin America, Vietnam, Rhodesia, and China. In Issue 16, in May 1966, perhaps to coincide with the international working class celebrations on May Day, Taaffe's article led the front page with the banner headline 'Internationalism the Only Road'. In September 1965, Militant, in issue no.9, ran a front-page article by Taaffe under the banner headline: \\"Nationalise the 400 Monopolies\\". This was the first instance of Militant's demand for the nationalisation of usually a specific number of multinational companies, which were said to control 80% or more of the economy, under workers' control and management, and the establishment of a socialist plan of production. Demands of this nature in Militant follow the Transitional Program written by Leon Trotsky, pushing beyond what the \\"bourgeois state\\" was willing to concede.  Expulsion from the Labour Party  By the 1980s, the Militant tendency had become the most prominent Trotskyist organisation in Britain. Two books by Peter Taaffe: The Rise of Militant and Liverpool ‚Äì A City That Dared to Fight (with Tony Mulhearn) describe this period. The Labour Party under Michael Foot (and later Neil Kinnock) moved to purge Militant from the party. In 1983, Peter Taaffe, along with the other four members of the Militant newspaper's editorial board (Ted Grant, Keith Dickinson, Lynn Walsh, and Clare Doyle), were expelled from the Labour Party. A year later, speaking at the Wembley Conference Centre to several thousand supporters celebrating 20 years of the Militant newspaper, Taaffe highlighted the media attention now fixed on Militant. Speaking about a \\"marvellous article\\" in the Daily Mirror, by now under the ownership of Robert Maxwell, he said: His speech contrasted on the one hand the determination showed by strikers during the miners strike in 1984‚Äì1985, and the Liverpool victory of the previous year under the leadership of the Militant tendency, and on the other the \\"five years of defeats\\" inflicted on workers as a result of poor Labour and trade union leadership.Militant Rally of 1984 (Part one, morning rally,) at Socialist Party historic videos, also on DVD, published by the Socialist Party 2007.) Peter Taaffe is referring to the period beginning with the victory of Thatcher in 1979. Taaffe characterised Neil Kinnock, Labour leader from 1983, in this way: \\"The bourgeois recognized early that Kinnock's role in attacking Liverpool and the miners was an attempt to sanitise the Labour Party, ridding it of all that 'socialist nonsense'.\\" Taaffe went on to predict \\"an enormous recoil towards the left\\" within the Labour Party. But this prognosis was overtaken by the profound changes which took place in the Labour Party. In 1988, Taaffe began assessing with the Scottish Militant members the prospects of activism against the government's Poll tax (officially the Community Charge) legislation. But for Taaffe and the leadership of the Militant, the prospects for Militant in the Labour Party were poor.  The Liverpool struggle 1983‚Äì1987  In the four-year Liverpool struggle, Taaffe was closely involved with developments, discussing with close friends and leading Liverpool Militant supporters, such as the former print worker Tony Mulhearn.Derek Hatton, Deputy leader of Liverpool City Council says \\"the man who has had the greatest political influence on my political thinking, and on the way in which we shaped our policy in Liverpool, was Peter Taaffe\\". Inside left, p. 32 He was President of the Liverpool District Labour Party during these events, in which the Liverpool City Council declared it was \\"Better to break the law than break the poor\\", agreed an illegal budget, and built 4,800 houses and bungalows, and improved 7,400 houses and flats (amongst other works), before the 47 councillors were surcharged and removed from office . Their opponents however argued that Liverpool was in chaos. Taaffe wanted to take the Liverpool battle towards a split with the Labour Party at that stage. In the interview for the BBC Radio 4 programme The Party's Over, Taaffe makes the following remarks: The Liverpool District Labour Party, which Taaffe says in the same interview had a very large attendance of 700, was suspended by the Labour Party in 1986. Thus Taaffe here indicates that he argued for defying the ban, which would have been in all essentials a split from the Labour Party.  The Poll Tax 1989‚Äì1991  In Glasgow, in April 1988, a \\"one-day conference with delegates from every area of Scotland where Militant had supporters and influence\\",The Rise of Militant p. 312 was held with Taaffe present. This conference decided to adopt the tactic of mass non-payment of the Poll Tax, and the \\"building of a Scottish-wide network of local anti-poll tax unions and regional federations\\" ‚Äì a strategy which was clearly in tune with large swathes of the population. In fact Prime Minister John Major subsequently reported that 17.5 million people had either not paid or were in serious arrearsDanny Burns Poll Tax Rebellion, p. 176 just before abolishing it. Anti-Poll Tax Unions were set up around the country, and brought together on an all-Scotland and then an all-Britain basis. These bodies, which brought Tommy Sheridan to prominence and are described in n Taaffe's 'The Rise of Militant', had to be built outside, and essentially in opposition to the Labour Party, which was implementing the Poll Tax at local level. \\"The august Times (11 July 1984) thundered: 'Danegeld in Liverpool'.\\", writes Peter Taaffe in Liverpool ‚Äì A City That Dared to Fight, chapter 8, p. 151 . The Poll Tax non-payment campaign has been widely credited for causing British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's downfall. The BBC, for instance, reports: \\"The unpopularity of the new charge led to the poll tax riots in London in March 1990 and ‚Äì indirectly ‚Äì to the downfall of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the November of the same year\\". The headline of this 'On this day' retrospective is \\"1990: One in five yet to pay poll tax\\" (See also Poll Tax Riots.) Peter Taaffe argues that:  The Open Turn  From 1987, differences between Taaffe and others on the executive committee of Militant and the CWI, and Grant and his supporters became apparent. The decisive issue between the two sides arose in 1991. It centred on whether the group should take an \\"open turn\\", initially called the \\"Scottish turn\\", which meant founding an independent political party outside of the Labour Party, or whether it should continue with entryism. Taaffe and the majority in Militant supported the Scottish turn and the creation of Scottish Militant Labour whilst Grant and a minority opposed it. These became known as the 'Majority' and the 'Minority' positions, and both produced documents which were circulated.Marxism and the British Labour Party ‚Äì the 'Open Turn' debate. The \\"Open Turn\\" debate took place essentially between April and October 1991. In April 1991, the Militant executive body decided to support the \\"Scottish Turn\\" as it was initially termed.Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 433-434 In January 1992, the majority leadership claimed that the minority was intending to split from Militant. Peter Taaffe published an extended editorial in Militant (24 January 1992) entitled \\"A parting of the ways\\" which announced that following the \\"Scottish turn\\" decision at the special conference in October 1991, Tommy Sheridan would be the group's Glasgow Pollock candidate in the approaching general election. Taaffe stated that those ten months had been one of \\"profound debate\\" culminating in the special October 1991 in which the majority had overwhelming support. Many opponents of the \\"Scottish turn\\" will remain loyal supporters of Militant, Taaffe predicted. Immediately after the special conference, Taaffe stated that Ted Grant and his group took steps to set up \\"their own small premises and their own staff and are raising their own funds. We regret Ted Grant has split in this way. He made a vital contribution...\\" Grant, Alan Woods, Rob Sewell, and other leading supporters of the 'Minority' were expelled, and reconstituted themselves as the Socialist Appeal tendency, after its paper, and Scottish Militant Labour eventually became the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP).A debate took place between 1998 and 2001 in which the leadership of the Scottish section of the Committee for a Workers' International proposed a change in the political character of the Scottish section. The leadership of the SSP eventually broke away from the CWI. Cf Party, Programme, Reformism and the International ‚Äì the 'Scottish debate' The SSP had gained several MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, but the SSP split in 2006, with Tommy Sheridan forming Solidarity ‚Äì Scotland's socialist movement  \\"A parting of the ways\\"  In the Militant editorial\\"A parting of the ways\\", Militant, January 1992 and in the document \\"Two Trends: Political Roots of The Breakaway\\"\\"Two Trends: Political Roots of The Breakaway\\", Militant document, January 1992 in January 1992, and in his book about Militant, Taaffe identified other issues which had become problematic. Political disagreements within the group existed over Black Monday, Russia, Afghanistan and South Africa).Peter Taaffe The Rise of Militant, p. 328, p. 445 Taaffe accused Grant of \\"never [being] prepared to enter into a dialogue. Ted effectively claimed a right of political veto\\" over the executive committee of the Militant. For Taaffe, there was a difference of views over the achievements of the last ten years. \\"They [Grant and his supporters] claim that over the last ten years Militant has relegated theory and moved towards activism. Incredibly, they dismiss as \\"activism\\" the outstanding interventions of Militant supporters in the miner's strike and the Liverpool council battle...Above all they relegate our successful leadership of the anti-poll tax movement which defeated Thatcher.\\" On the contrary, counters Taaffe, it is Grant and his followers who have fallen into \\"dogmatism\\" and betray an atrophy of thought: \\"The former minority are political dinosaurs. They operate with outmoded formulas which no longer apply... an absolutely dogmatic, black and white, undialectical approach towards political phenomena, both in Britain and on an international scale.\\". He claimed that Grant \\"publicly asserted his views against the majority of the editorial board on crucial issues, [which] threatened to have a disorientating effect on some of our supporters\\". One disagreement over current events was over 'Black Monday' ‚Äì a sharp fall in the international stock markets in 1987. Grant believed a worldwide slump would arise from the fall of the stock markets. \\"From a capitalist point of view at best this will be the worst post-war slump, but it is possible that it will be worse than the slump of 1929‚Äì1933\\".Militant, 30 October 1987 Whilst Grant had the support of Alan Woods and Michael Roberts on this issue, he was opposed by Taaffe, Lynn Walsh, Bob Labi and what was to become the \\"majority\\". Here was first clearly delineated the dividing line that was drawn between the supporters of Grant and Taaffe. Taaffe writes that the discussion on the executive was \\"very sharp\\".The Rise of Militant, p. 447 Taaffe argued that, \\"To other members of the Editorial Board it was clear that the major capitalist states, especially Germany and Japan, were stepping in to finance a stabilisation of the world financial system. This, we argued, would allow the boom to continue for a time, postponing a recession and other problems into the future. This was what happened.\\" Despite the disagreements, Grant proceeded to publish his views in the Militant. Looking back in 1992 Taaffe argues that Grant should have been challenged in writing. Such a challenge would have meant the formation of factions in 1987. A final issue was the approaching collapse of the Soviet Union, or for them, the crisis of Stalinism. Taaffe and the majority believed that the restoration of capitalism was possible in the Soviet Union. Grant disagreed. In fact in the same article on \\"Black Monday\\" Grant added his view that, \\"Any illusions in Gorbachev changing anything fundamental, will be shattered by the attitude of the Moscow bureaucracy to this crisis.\\" The collapse of Stalinism was, Taaffe counters, \\"the end of an epoch\\", which led to capitalist triumphalism.For instance, Francis Fukuyama, The End of History and the Last Man  The Socialist Party  The majority in the Militant tendency, led by Peter Taaffe, argued that the Labour Party had become a thoroughly bourgeois party which no longer represented the working class. Militant went on to become Militant Labour and then the Socialist Party in 1997, with Taaffe as general secretary. It campaigns in the trade unions to break the link with Labour and found a new party based on the working class, in contrast to the supporters of Socialist Appeal, who support a policy of work within the Labour Party and the trade unions in opposition to New Labour under Tony Blair. Internationally, Taaffe won majority support in the Committee for a Workers' International (CWI). The opposition to the Open Turn internationally was expelled from the CWI and founded the Committee for a Marxist International and its in Defence of Marxism website. The CWI later founded a website Marxist resource from the Committee for a Workers' International in part to publish the documents written by Peter Taaffe and others in the CWI about these and other developments and debates, as a contribution to an analysis of what they perceive to be the complexities of the current period, and how to build the path to the working class for the ideas of Marxism. Taaffe continued to play an important role in the Committee for a Workers' International, writing books and pamphlets such as the History of the CWI, Afghanistan, Islam and the Revolutionary Left (2002) and on the anniversary of the British general strike, 1926 General Strike ‚Äì workers taste power (2006). Taaffe's Marxism in Today's World (2006) arose from a visit to the CWI's offices in London by an Italian Marxist publishing collective, Guiovane Talpa, who conducted a probing interview with Peter Taaffe and Bob Labi on CWI policy over several days, publishing the transcript in Italian. At the completion of the project the CWI published an additional English version. This book discusses the views of the CWI on war, capitalism the environment and other issues, and is now being published in India. In November 2016, Taaffe publicly applied to rejoin the Labour Party as part of a group of 75 activists. With the aim of supporting party leader Jeremy Corbyn against his internal opponents, his objective was for Labour Party affiliation of the Socialist Party and the standing of joint candidates. Following the 2020 national congress of the Socialist Party, the newly elected Socialist Party Executive Committee unanimously agreed that deputy general secretary Hannah Sell take over as general secretary from Peter Taaffe. He was elected political secretary and remains on the Executive Committee.  Publications  Taaffe has written a number of books and pamphlets, including: *Socialism and Left Unity, (2008) *Marxism in Today's World, (2006) *1926 General Strike ‚Äì workers taste power, (April 2006) *Upheavals in China (pamphlet), (April 2005). *A socialist world is possible, (February 2005) *Empire Defeated: Vietnam War ‚Äì The Lessons For Today, (2003) *Post-September 11: Can US Imperialism be challenged?

A relative excess of these receptors within the limbic system means Broca's area, which can produce illogical language, has an abnormal connection to Wernicke's area, which comprehends language but does not create it. Note that variation in distribution is observed within individuals, so abnormalities of this characteristic likely play a significant role in all psychological illnesses. Individual alterations are produced by differences within glutamatergic pathways within the limbic system, which are also implicated in other psychotic syndromes. Among the alterations of both synaptic and global structure, the most significant abnormalities are observed in the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulate cortex. The combination of these creates a profound dissymmetry of prefrontal inhibitory signaling, shifted positively towards the dominant side. Eventually, the cingulate gyrus becomes atrophied towards the anterior, due to long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) from the abnormally strong signals transversely across the brain. This, combined with a relative deficit in GABAergic input to Wernicke's area, shifts the balance of bilateral communication across the corpus callosum posteriorly. Through this mechanism, hemispherical communication becomes highly shifted towards the left/dominant posterior. As such, spontaneous language from Broca's can propagate through the limbic system to the tertiary auditory cortex. This retrograde signaling to the temporal lobes that results in the parietal lobes not recognizing it as internal results in the auditory hallucinations typical of chronic schizophrenia. In addition, significant cortical grey matter volume reductions are observed in this disorder. Specifically, the right hemisphere atrophies more, while both sides show a marked decrease in frontal and posterior volume. This indicates that abnormal synaptic plasticity occurs, where certain feedback loops become so potentiated, others receive little glutaminergic transmission. This is a direct result of the abnormal dopaminergic input to the striatum, thus (indirectly) disinhibition of thalamic activity. The excitatory nature of dopaminergic transmission means the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia is inextricably intertwined with this altered functioning. 5-HT also regulates monoamine neurotransmitters, including dopaminergic transmission. Specifically, the 5-HT2A receptor regulates cortical input to the basal ganglia and many typical and atypical antipsychotics are antagonists at this receptor. Several antipsychotics are also antagonists at the 5-HT2C receptor, leading to dopamine release in the structures where 5-HT2C is expressed; striatum, prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, hippocampus (all structures indicated in this disease), and currently thought to be a reason why antipsychotics with 5HT2C antagonistic properties improves negative symptoms. More research is needed to explain the exact nature of the altered chemical transmission in this disorder. Recent evidence on a variety of animal models of psychosis, such as sensitization of animal behaviour by amphetamine, or phencyclidine (PCP, Angel Dust), or excess steroids, or by removing various genes (COMT, DBH, GPRK6, RGS9, RIIbeta), or making brain lesions in newborn animals, or delivering animals abnormally by Caesarian section, all induce a marked behavioural supersensitivity to dopamine and a marked rise in the number of dopamine D2 receptors in the high-affinity state for dopamine. This latter work implies that there are multiple genes and neuronal pathways that can lead to psychosis and that all these multiple psychosis pathways converge via the high-affinity state of the D2 receptor, the common target for all antipsychotics, typical or atypical. Combined with less inhibitory signalling from the thalamus and other basal ganglic structures, from hyoptrophy the abnormal activation of the cingulate cortex, specifically around Broca's and Wernicke's areas, abnormal D2 agonism can facilitate the self-reinforcing, illogical patterns of language found in such patients. In schizophrenia, this feedback loop has progressed, which produced the widespread neural atrophy characteristic of this disease. Patients on neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication have significantly less atrophy within these crucial areas. As such, early medical intervention is crucial in preventing the advancement of these profound deficits in bilateral communication at the root of all psychotic disorders. Advanced, chronic schizophrenia can not respond even to clozapine, regarded as the most potent antipsychotic, as such, a cure for highly advanced schizophrenia is likely impossible through the use of any modern antipsychotics, so the value of early intervention cannot be stressed enough.  Discussion  = Evidence for the dopamine hypothesis = Stimulants such as amphetamine, and cocaine increase the levels of dopamine in the brain and can cause symptoms of psychosis, particularly after large doses or prolonged use. This is often referred to as \\"amphetamine psychosis\\" or \\"cocaine psychosis,\\" but may produce experiences virtually indistinguishable from the positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Similarly, those treated with dopamine enhancing levodopa for Parkinson's disease can experience psychotic side effects mimicking the symptoms of schizophrenia. Up to 75% of patients with schizophrenia have increased signs and symptoms of their psychosis upon challenge with moderate doses of methylphenidate or amphetamine or other dopamine-like compounds, all given at doses at which control normal volunteers do not have any psychologically disturbing effects. Some functional neuroimaging studies have also shown that, after taking amphetamine, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia show greater levels of dopamine release (particularly in the striatum) than non-psychotic individuals. However, the acute effects of dopamine stimulants include euphoria, alertness and over-confidence; these symptoms are more reminiscent of mania than schizophrenia. Since the 2000s, several PET studies have confirmed an altered synthesis capacity of dopamine in the nigrostriatal system demonstrating a dopaminergic dysregulation. A group of drugs called the phenothiazines, including antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine, has been found to antagonize dopamine binding (particularly at receptors known as D2 dopamine receptors) and reduce positive psychotic symptoms. This observation was subsequently extended to other antipsychotic drug classes, such as butyrophenones including haloperidol. The link was strengthened by experiments in the 1970s which suggested that the binding affinity of antipsychotic drugs for D2 dopamine receptors seemed to be inversely proportional to their therapeutic dose. This correlation, suggesting that receptor binding is causally related to therapeutic potency, was reported by two laboratories in 1976. Genetic evidence has suggested that there may be genes, or specific variants of genes, that code for mechanisms involved in dopamine function, which may be more prevalent in people experiencing psychosis or diagnosed with schizophrenia. Dopamine-related genes linked to psychosis in this way include COMT, DRD4, and AKT1. People with Schizophrenia appear to have a high rate of self-medication with nicotine; the therapeutic effect likely occurs through dopamine modulation by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. However, there was controversy and conflicting findings over whether postmortem findings resulted from drug tolerance to chronic antipsychotic treatment. Compared to the success of postmortem studies in finding profound changes of dopamine receptors, imaging studies using SPET and PET methods in drug naive patients have generally failed to find any difference in dopamine D2 receptor density compared to controls. Comparable findings in longitudinal studies show: \\" Particular emphasis is given to methodological limitations in the existing literature, including lack of reliability data, clinical heterogeneity among studies, and inadequate study designs and statistic,\\" suggestions are made for improving future longitudinal neuroimaging studies of treatment effects in schizophrenia A recent review of imaging studies in schizophrenia shows confidence in the techniques, while discussing such operator error. In 2007 one report said, \\"During the last decade, results of brain imaging studies by use of PET and SPET in schizophrenic patients showed a clear dysregulation of the dopaminergic system.\\" Recent findings from meta-analyses suggest that there may be a small elevation in dopamine D2 receptors in drug-free patients with schizophrenia, but the degree of overlap between patients and controls makes it unlikely that this is clinically meaningful. While the review by Laruelle acknowledged more sites were found using methylspiperone, it discussed the theoretical reasons behind such an increase (including the monomer-dimer equilibrium) and called for more work to be done to 'characterise' the differences. In addition, newer antipsychotic medication (called atypical antipsychotic medication) can be as potent as older medication (called typical antipsychotic medication) while also affecting serotonin function and having somewhat less of a dopamine blocking effect. In addition, dopamine pathway dysfunction has not been reliably shown to correlate with symptom onset or severity. HVA levels correlate trendwise to symptoms severity. During the application of debrisoquin, this correlation becomes significant. Giving a more precise explanation of this discrepancy in D2 receptor has been attempted by a significant minority. Radioligand imaging measurements involve the monomer and dimer ratio, and the 'cooperativity' model. Cooperativitiy is a chemical function in the study of enzymes.Safra, JE (Chairman) 2005 'Cooperativity' The New Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol 3, Micropaedia, p 666 Dopamine receptors interact with their own kind, or other receptors to form higher order receptors such as dimers, via the mechanism of cooperativity.Fuxe K, Marcellino D, Guidolin D, Woods A, Agnati L, Chapter 10 ‚Äì Dopamine Receptor Oligermization, in Neve KA (ed)'Dopamine Receptors' Springer (2009) Philip Seeman has said: \\"In schizophrenia, therefore, the density of [11C] methylspiperone sites rises, reflecting an increase in monomers, while the density of [11C] raclopride sites remains the same, indicating that the total population of D2 monomers and dimers does not change.\\" (In another place Seeman has said methylspiperone possibly binds with dimers) With this difference in measurement technique in mind, the above- mentioned meta-analysis uses results from 10 different ligands. Exaggerated ligand binding results such as SDZ GLC 756 (as used in the figure) were explained by reference to this monomer-dimer equilibrium. According to Seeman, \\"...Numerous postmortem studies have consistently revealed D2 receptors to be elevated in the striata of patients with schizophrenia\\". However, the authors were concerned the effect of medication may not have been fully accounted for. The study introduced an experiment by Abi-Dargham et al. in which it was shown medication-free live schizophrenics had more D2 receptors involved in the schizophrenic process and more dopamine. Since then another study has shown such elevated percentages in D2 receptors is brain-wide (using a different ligand, which did not need dopamine depletion). In a 2009 study, Annisa Abi- Dagham et al. confirmed the findings of her previous study regarding increased baseline D2 receptors in schizophrenics and showing a correlation between this magnitude and the result of amphetamine stimulation experiments. Some animal models of psychosis are similar to those for addiction ‚Äì displaying increased locomotor activity.\\"Amphetamine psychosis has been proposed as a model for some features of schizophrenia... This model of amphetamine sensitization has also been adopted as a paradigm for researchers interested in the addictive powers of drugs of abuse.\\" For those female animals with previous sexual experience, amphetamine stimulation happens faster than for virgins. There is no study on male equivalent because the studies are meant to explain why females experience addiction earlier than males. Even in 1986 the effect of antipsychotics on receptor measurement was controversial. An article in Science sought to clarify whether the increase was solely due to medication by using drug-naive schizophrenics: \\"The finding that D2 dopamine receptors are substantially increased in schizophrenic patients who have never been treated with neuroleptic drugs raises the possibility that dopamine receptors are involved in the schizophrenic disease process itself. Alternatively, the increased D2 receptor number may reflect presynaptic factors such as increased endogenous dopamine levels (16). In either case, our findings support the hypothesis that dopamine receptor abnormalities are present in untreated schizophrenic patients.\\" (The experiment used 3-N-[11C]methylspiperone ‚Äì the same as mentioned by Seeman detects D2 monomers and binding was double that of controls.) It is still thought that dopamine mesolimbic pathways may be hyperactive, resulting in hyperstimulation of D2 receptors and positive symptoms. There is also growing evidence that, conversely, mesocortical pathway dopamine projections to the prefrontal cortex might be hypoactive (underactive), resulting in hypostimulation of D1 receptors, which may be related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairment. The overactivity and underactivity in these different regions may be linked, and may not be due to a primary dysfunction of dopamine systems but to more general neurodevelopmental issues that precede them. Increased dopamine sensitivity may be a common final pathway. Another finding is a six-fold excess of binding sites insensitive to the testing agent, raclopride;For a discussion of opposing studies see p 143: Seeman said this increase was probably due to the increase in D2 monomers. Such an increase in monomers may occur via the cooperativity mechanism which is responsible for D2High and D2Low, the supersensitive and lowsensitivity states of the D2 dopamine receptor. More specifically, \\"an increase in monomers, may be one basis for dopamine supersensitivity\\". = Evidence against the dopamine hypothesis = Further experiments, conducted as new methods were developed (particularly the ability to use PET scanning to examine drug action in the brain of living patients) challenged the view that the amount of dopamine blocking was correlated with clinical benefit. These studies showed that some patients had over 90% of their D2 receptors blocked by antipsychotic drugs, but showed little reduction in their psychoses. This primarily occurs in patients who have had the psychosis for ten to thirty years. At least 90-95% of first-episode patients, however, respond to antipsychotics at low doses and do so with D2 occupancy of 60-70%. The antipsychotic aripiprazole occupies over 90% of D2 receptors, but this drug is both an agonist and an antagonist at D2 receptors. Furthermore, although dopamine-inhibiting medications modify dopamine levels within minutes, the associated improvement in patient symptoms is usually not visible for at least several days, suggesting that dopamine may be indirectly responsible for the illness.R. Thompson, The Brain, Similarly, the second generation of antipsychotic drugs ‚Äì the atypical antipsychotics ‚Äì were found to be just as effective as older typical antipsychotics in controlling psychosis, but more effective in controlling the negative symptoms, despite the fact that they have lower affinity for dopamine receptors than for various other neurotransmitter receptors.Diaz, Jaime. How Drugs Influence Behavior. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall, 1996. More recent work, however, has shown that atypical antipsychotic drugs such as clozapine and quetiapine bind and unbind rapidly and repeatedly to the dopamine D2 receptor. All of these drugs exhibit inverse agonistic effects at the 5-HT2A/2C receptors, meaning serotonin abnormalities are also involved in the complex constellation of neurologic factors predisposing one to the self reinforcing language-based psychological deficits found in all forms of psychosis. The excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is now also thought to be associated with schizophrenia. Phencyclidine (also known as PCP or \\"Angel Dust\\") and ketamine, both of which block glutamate (NMDA) receptors, are known to cause psychosis at least somewhat resembling schizophrenia, further suggesting that psychosis and perhaps schizophrenia cannot fully be explained in terms of dopamine function, but may also involve other neurotransmitters.\\"Daring to Think Differently about Schizophrenia\\". New York Times, February 24, 2008. Similarly, there is now evidence to suggest there may be a number of functional and structural anomalies in the brains of some people diagnosed with schizophrenia, such as changes in grey matter density in the frontal and temporal lobes. It appears, therefore, that there are multiple causes for psychosis and schizophrenia, including gene mutations and anatomical lesions. Psychiatrist David Healy has argued that drug companies have inappropriately promoted the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia as a deliberate and calculated simplification for the benefit of drug marketing. = Relationship with glutamate = Research has shown the importance of glutamate receptors, specifically N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), in addition to dopamine in the etiology of schizophrenia. Mice with only 5% of the normal levels of NMDAR's expressed schizophrenic like behaviors seen in animal models of schizophrenia while mice with 100% of NMDAR's behaved normally. Schizophrenic behavior in low NMDAR mice has been effectively treated with antipsychotics that lower dopamine. NMDAR's and dopamine receptors in the prefrontal cortex are associated with the cognitive impairments and working memory deficits commonly seen in schizophrenia. Rats that have been given a NMDAR antagonist exhibit a significant decrease in performance on cognitive tasks. Rats given a dopamine antagonist (antipsychotic) experience a reversal of the negative effects of the NMDAR antagonist. Glutamate imbalances appear to cause abnormal functioning in dopamine. When levels of glutamate are low dopamine is overactive and results in the expression schizophrenic symptoms. = Criticisms = Dr Ronald Pies, the current editor in Chief Emeritus of Psychiatric Times with a circulation of about 50,000 psychiatrists monthly, wrote on July 11, 2011 \\" In truth, the ‚Äúchemical imbalance‚Äù notion was always a kind of urban legend- - never a theory seriously propounded by well-informed psychiatrists.\\"\\"Psychiatry‚Äôs New Brain-Mind and the Legend of the Chemical Imbalance\\" by Ronald W. Pies, MD. July 11, 2011. = Combined networks of dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate = Psychopharmacologist Stephen M. Stahl suggested in a review of 2018 that in many cases of psychosis, including schizophrenia, three interconnected networks based on dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate - each on its own or in various combinations - contributed to an overexcitation of dopamine D2 receptors in the ventral striatum.

Caitika () was an early Buddhist school, a sub-sect of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika. They were also known as the Caityaka sect. The Caitikas proliferated throughout the mountains of South India, from which they derived their name. In Pali writings, members of this sect and its offshoots were generally referred to as the Andhakas, meaning \\"of Coastal Andhra\\".  History  The Caitikas branched off from the main MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school in the 1st or 2nd century BCE. Epigraphic evidence of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas in the Mathura region dates to the first century BCE, and the ' dates the formation of the Caitikas to 300 years after the Buddha. However, the ancient Buddhist sites in the lower K·πõ·π£·πáa Valley, including AmarƒÅvati, NƒÅgƒÅrjunako·πá·∏çƒÅ and Jaggayyape·π≠a \\"can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.\\" The Caitikas gave rise to the Apara≈õailas and Uttara≈õailas (also called P≈´rva≈õailas). Together, they comprised an important part of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika located in South India. Two other sub-sects associated with the Caitikas include the RƒÅjagirikas and the SiddhƒÅrthikas, both of which emerged from the Andhra region around 300 CE.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. p. 279 The Caitikas are said to have had in their possession the Great Stupa at Sanchi. The Great St≈´pa was first commissioned by Asoka in the 3rd century BCE and became known as a Buddhist pilgrimage site. In the Aja·πá·π≠ƒÅ Caves, the only epigraphic reference to an early Buddhist sect is to that of the Caitikas, which is associated with an iconic image in Cave 10. The MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas were generally associated with the early veneration of anthropomorphic Buddha images. When Xuanzang visited DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he wrote that the monks of this region were MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and mentions the P≈´rva≈õailas specifically. Near DhƒÅnyaka·π≠aka, he met two MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika bhik·π£us and studied MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika abhidharma with them for several months, during which time they also studied various MahƒÅyƒÅna ≈õƒÅstras together under Xuanzang's direction.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 213  Doctrine  The southern MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools such as the Caitikas advocated the ideal of the bodhisattva, the bodhisattvayƒÅna, over that of the arhat or ≈õrƒÅvakayƒÅna, and they viewed arhats as being fallible and still subject to ignorance. The main Caitika school, along with the Apara≈õailas and Uttara≈õailas, all emphasized the transcendental and supernatural character of the Buddha. Xuanzang considered the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika doctrine of a m≈´lavij√±ƒÅna (\\"root consciousness\\") to be essentially the same as the Yogacara doctrine of the ƒÅlƒÅyavij√±ƒÅna \\"storehouse consciousness\\".

The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Alex Wayman has outlined eleven points of complete agreement between the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas and the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅ, along with four major arguments for this association. After its composition, this text became the primary scriptural advocate in India for the universal potentiality of Buddhahood.Brown, Brian Edward. The Buddha Nature: A Study of the TathƒÅgatagarbha and ƒÄlayavij√±ƒÅna. 2010. p. 3 Anthony Barber also associates the earlier development of the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra with the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas, and concludes that the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas of the ƒÄndhra region were responsible for the inception of the TathƒÅgatagarbha doctrine. =Bodhisattva canons= In the 6th century CE, BhƒÅviveka speaks of the SiddhƒÅrthikas using a VidyƒÅdhƒÅra Pi·π≠aka, and the Apara≈õailas and Uttara≈õailas (P≈´rva≈õailas) both using a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, implying collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts within these Caitika schools.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 During the same period, Avalokitavrata speaks of the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghikas using a \\"Great ƒÄgama Pi·π≠aka\\", which is then associated with MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ and the Ten Stages Sutra.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 Avalokitavrata also states that MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras such as the Praj√±ƒÅparamitƒÅ were recited by the Apara≈õailas and the P≈´rva≈õailas.Walser, Joseph. NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in Context: MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism and Early Indian Culture. 2005. p. 53 According to the TheravƒÅdin text NikƒÅyasa·πÖgraha, the large MahƒÅyƒÅna collection called the MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a S≈´tra (Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka, 310) was composed by the \\"Andhakas\\", meaning the Caitika schools of the ƒÄndhra region.Adikaram, E.W. Early History of Buddhism in Ceylon. 1953. p. 100Paul, Diana. The Buddhist Feminine Ideal. 1980. p. 12 This collection includes the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ Si·πÉhanƒÅda S≈´tra, the Longer SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha Sutra, the Ak·π£obhyavy≈´ha S≈´tra, a long text called the Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, and others.Sangharakshita. The Eternal Legacy: An Introduction to the Canonical Literature of Buddhism. 2006. p. 168 The MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a collection totals 49 MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, divided into 120 fascicles in the Chinese translation.  Disputes with TheravƒÅda  In the MahƒÅvihara tradition of the TheravƒÅda school, Buddhagho·π£a grouped the Caitika schools in the ƒÄndhra region, such as the RƒÅjagirikas and the SiddhƒÅrthikas, as the \\"Andhakas\\". Works such as the KathƒÅvatthu show that MahƒÅvihara polemics were directed overwhelmingly at these \\"Andhakas\\" in India. =Textual authenticity= The Caitika schools rejected the post-Asokan texts that were in use by the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya tradition such as the Parivara, the six books of Abhidharma, the Patisambhidamagga, the Niddesa, some Jataka tales, some verses, and so on. For example, the Caitikas claimed that their own Jataka tales represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.Warder, A.K. Indian Buddhism. 2000. pp. 286-287 =Interpretation of Buddhist texts= One dispute recorded in the KathƒÅvatthu between the MahƒÅviharavasins and the Andhakas was a fundamental matter concerning the interpretation of the Buddha's teachings. The Andhakas are said to have held that the Buddha's actions and speech were supramundane, but some may only perceive the conventional or mundane interpretation. For the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika branch of Buddhism, the ultimate meaning of the Buddha's teachings was \\"beyond words\\", and words were merely a conventional exposition of the Dharma. The TheravƒÅda MahƒÅviharavasins, in contrast, argued that literal interpretations of the Buddha's teachings were best.Buescher, John.

O'Halloran, Library of Congress collection The Kitchen Debate () was a series of impromptu exchanges through interpreters between U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon, then 46, and Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev, 65, at the opening of the American National Exhibition at Sokolniki Park in Moscow on July 24, 1959. An entire house was built for the exhibition which the American exhibitors claimed that anyone in the United States could afford. It was filled with labor-saving and recreational devices meant to represent the fruits of the capitalist American consumer market. The debate was recorded on color videotape, and Nixon made reference to this fact; it was subsequently broadcast in both countries. History In 1959, the Soviets and Americans agreed to hold exhibits in each other's countries as a cultural exchange to promote understanding. This was a result of the 1958 U.S.‚ÄìSoviet Cultural Agreement. The Soviet exhibit in New York City opened in June 1959, and Vice President Nixon was on hand the following month to open the US exhibit in Moscow. Nixon took Soviet First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev on a tour of the exhibit. There were multiple displays and consumer goods provided by more than 450 American companies. The centerpiece of the exhibit was a geodesic dome which housed scientific and technical experiments in a 30,000 square-foot facility. The Soviets purchased the dome at the end of the Moscow exhibition. William Safire was the exhibitor's press agent, and he recounted that the Kitchen Debate took place in a number of locations at the exhibition, but primarily in the kitchen of a suburban model house which was cut in half for easy viewing.Safire, William. \\"The Cold War's Hot Kitchen\\", The New York Times, Friday, July 24, 2009. This was only one of a series of four meetings that occurred between Nixon and Khrushchev during the 1959 exhibition. Nixon was accompanied by President Eisenhower's younger brother Milton S. Eisenhower, former president of Johns Hopkins University. Khrushchev surprised Nixon during the first meeting in the Kremlin when he protested the Captive Nations Resolution passed by the US Congress which condemned the Soviet Union for its \\"control\\" over the \\"captive\\" peoples of Eastern Europe and called upon Americans to pray for those people. After protesting the actions of the US Congress, he dismissed the new technology of the US and declared that the Soviets would have all of the same things in a few years and then say \\"Bye bye\\" as they surpassed the U.S. Khrushchev criticised the large range of American gadgets. He satirically asked \\"Don't you have a machine that puts food into the mouth and pushes it down?\\", a reference to Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film Modern Times. Nixon responded that at least the competition was technological rather than military. Both men agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union should seek areas of agreement. The second visit occurred in a television studio inside the American exhibit. At the end, Khrushchev stated that everything that he had said in their debate should be translated into English and broadcast in the US. Nixon responded, \\"Certainly it will, and everything I say is to be translated into Russian and broadcast across the Soviet Union. That's a fair bargain.\\" Khrushchev vigorously shook hands to this proposal. Nixon argued that the Americans built to take advantage of new techniques, while Khrushchev advocated for Communism by arguing that the Soviets built for future generations. Khrushchev stated, \\"This is what America is capable of, and how long has she existed? 300 years? 150 years of independence and this is her level. We haven't quite reached 42 years, and in another 7 years, we'll be at the level of America, and after that we'll go farther.\\" Safire reported that Leonid Brezhnev was present and attempted to obstruct his photos. The third visit occurred inside the kitchen on a cutaway model home that was furnished with a dishwasher, refrigerator, and range. It was designed to represent a $14,000 home that a typical American worker could afford. Television broadcast and American reaction The three major American television networks broadcast the Kitchen Debate on July 25, 1959. The Soviets subsequently protested, as Nixon and Khrushchev had agreed that the debate should be broadcast simultaneously in America and the Soviet Union, with the Soviets threatening to withhold the tape until they were ready to broadcast. The American networks, however, had felt that delay would cause the news to lose its immediacy.Richard H. Shepard. \\"Debate Goes on TV over Soviet Protest\\", The New York Times, July 26, 1959 The debate was broadcast on Moscow television on July 27, albeit late at night and with Nixon's remarks only partially translated.Associated Press. \\"Soviet TV Shows Tape of Debate\\". The New York Times, July 28, 1959 American reaction was mixed. The New York Times called it \\"an exchange that emphasized the gulf between east and west but had little bearing on the substantive issue\\" and portrayed it as a political stunt.\\"News of the Week in Review\\", The New York Times, July 26 The Times also declared that public opinion seemed divided after the debates.\\"Moscow Debate Stirs U.S Public\\", The New York Times, July 27, 1959 Time magazine, on the other hand, praised Nixon, saying that he \\"managed in a unique way to personify a national character proud of peaceful accomplishment, sure of its way of life, confident of its power under threat.\\"\\"Better to See Once\\", Time, August 3, 1959 Nixon gained popularity because of the informal nature of the exchange, improving upon the lukewarm reception that he previously had with the American public.Paul Kengor. \\"The Vice President, Secretary of State, and Foreign Policy\\".

Journal of Interdisciplinary History Vol 1, No. 1 (1970) pp 49‚Äì105 He also impressed Khrushchev, according to William Safire. \\"The shrewd Khrushchev came away from his personal duel of words with Nixon persuaded that the advocate of capitalism was not just tough-minded but strong-willed.\\" Khrushchev claimed that he did all he could to bring about Nixon's defeat in his 1960 presidential campaign after their confrontation. The trip raised Nixon's profile as a public statesman, greatly improving his chances of receiving the Republican presidential nomination the following year.\\"Now the Summit\\", The New York Times, August 3, 1959 In the Kitchen Debate, Khrushchev claimed that Nixon's grandchildren would live under communism and Nixon claimed that Khrushchev's grandchildren would live in freedom. In a 1992 interview, Nixon commented that at the time of the debate, he was sure Khrushchev's claim was wrong, but Nixon was not sure that his own assertion was correct. Nixon said that events had proven that he was indeed right because Khrushchev's grandchildren now lived in freedom, referring to then recent collapse of the Soviet Union. March 30, 1992.

While they are identified as a unique doctrinal tendency, they were part of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Vinaya lineage of monastic ordination.Tadeusz Skorupski, SautrƒÅntika, Oxford Bibliographies, LAST MODIFIED: 29 MAY 2015, DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0210 Their name means literally \\"those who rely upon the sutras\\", which indicated, as stated by the commentator Yasomitra, that they hold the sutras, but not the Abhidharma commentaries (sastras), as authoritative. The views of this group first appear in the Abhidharmako≈õabhƒÅ·π£ya of Vasubandhu. Name The name SautrƒÅntika indicates that unlike other North Indian Sthaviras, this school held the Buddhist sutras as central to their views, over and above the ideas presented in the Abhidharma literature. The Sarvastivada scholar Samghabhadra, in his Nyayanusara, attacks a school of thought named Sautrantika which he associates with the scholars ≈örƒ´lƒÅta and his student Vasubandhu.Dessein, Bart; Teng, Weijen. Text, History, and Philosophy: Abhidharma across Buddhist Scholastic Traditions, BRILL, 2016, pg 232 According to Samghabhadra, a central tenet of this school was that all sutra is explicit meaning (nitartha), hence their name. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins sometimes referred to them as the school, meaning \\"those who utilize the method of examples\\". This latter name may have been a pejorative label. It is also possible that the name 'DƒÅr·π£·π≠ƒÅntika' identifies a predecessor tradition, or another related, but distinct, doctrinal position; the exact relationship between the two terms is unclear. Charles Willemen identifies the SautrƒÅntika as a Western branch of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins, active in the Gandhara area, who split from the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins sometime before 200 CE, when the SautrƒÅntika name emerged. Other scholars are less confident of a specific identification for the SautrƒÅntika; Nobuyoshi Yamabe calls specifying the precise identity of the SautrƒÅntika \\"one of the biggest problems in current Buddhist scholarship.\\" History The founding of the SautrƒÅntika school is attributed to the elder KumƒÅralƒÅta (c. 3rd century CE), author of a \\"collection of d·πõ·π£tƒÅnta\\" (D·πõ·π£tƒÅntapa·πÖkti) called the KalpanƒÅma·πá·∏çitƒ´kƒÅ. The SautrƒÅntikas were sometimes also called \\"disciples of KumƒÅralƒÅta\\". According to Chinese sources, Harivarman (250-350 CE) was a student of KumƒÅralƒÅta who became disillusioned with Buddhist Abhidharma and then wrote the Tattvasiddhi- ≈õƒÅstra in order to \\"eliminate confusion and abandon the later developments, with the hope of returning to the origin\\".Lin, Qian. Mind in Dispute: The Section on Mind in Harivarman‚Äôs *Tattvasiddhi, University of Washington, page 15-16 The Tattvasiddhi was translated into Chinese and became an important text in Chinese Buddhism until the Tang Dynasty. Other works by SautrƒÅntika affiliated authors include the AbhidharmƒÅm·πõtarasa-≈õƒÅstra attributed to Gho·π£aka, and the AbhidharmƒÅvatƒÅra-≈õƒÅstra attributed to Skandhila.Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein, Collett Cox (editors) Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism, Handbuch Der Orientalistik, page 108. The elder ≈örƒ´lƒÅta, who was Vasubandhu's teacher is also known as a famous SautrƒÅntika who wrote the SautrƒÅntika-vibhƒÅ·π£a.Przyluski, Jean; Darstantika, Sautrantika and Sarvastivaldin. The Indian Historical Quarterly 1940, 6 pp.246--254 Gho·π£aka's AbhidharmƒÅm·πõtarasa and Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi have both been translated into English. The Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu wrote the famous Abhidharma work Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ which presented SarvƒÅstivƒÅda-VaibhƒÅ·π£ika Abhidharma tenets, he also wrote a \\"bhƒÅ·π£ya\\" or commentary on this work, which presented critiques of the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika tradition from a SautrƒÅntika perspective. The Abhidharmako≈õa was highly influential and is the main text on Abhidharma used in Tibetan and Chinese Buddhism up until today. Buddhist logic (pramƒÅ·πáavƒÅda) as developed by DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti is also associated with the SautrƒÅntika school. Doctrine No separate vinaya (monastic code) specific to the SautrƒÅntika has been found, nor is the existence of any such separate disciplinary code evidenced in other texts; this indicates that they were likely only a doctrinal division within the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin school. The SautrƒÅntika criticized the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdins on various matters such as ontology, philosophy of mind and perception.Williams, Paul (editor). Buddhism: YogƒÅcƒÅra, the epistemological tradition and TathƒÅgatagarbha, Volume 5, page 48. While the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin abhidharma described a complex system in which past, present, and future phenomena are all held to have some form of their own existence, the SautrƒÅntika subscribed to a doctrine of \\"extreme momentariness\\" that held that only the present moment existed. They seem to have regarded the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin position as a violation of the basic Buddhist principle of impermanence. As explained by Jan Westerhoff, this doctrine of momentariness holds that each present moment \\"does not possess any temporal thickness; immediately after coming into existence each moment passes out of existence\\" and that therefore \\"all dharmas, whether mental or material, only last for an instant (ksana) and cease immediately after arising\\".Westerhoff, Jan, The Golden Age of Indian Buddhist Philosophy, Oxford University Press, 2018, p. 75. The SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin abhidharma also broke down human experience in terms of a variety of underlying phenomena (a view similar to that held by the modern Theravadin abhidhamma); the SautrƒÅntika believed that experience could not be differentiated in this manner. Sautrantika doctrines expounded by elder ≈örƒ´lƒÅta and critiqued in turn by Samghabhadra's Nyayanusara include:Dessein, Bart; Teng, Weijen. Text, History, and Philosophy: Abhidharma across Buddhist Scholastic Traditions, BRILL, 2016, pg 231 *The theory of anudhatu (or *purvanudhatu, \\"subsidiary element\\"), which is also associated with the theory of seeds (Bƒ´ja) espoused by Vasubandhu.Fukuda, Takumi. BHADANTA RAMA: A SAUTRANTIKA BEFORE VASUBANDHU, Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 26 Number 2 2003. This theory was used to explain karma and rebirth. *The doctrine that caitasikas (mental factors) are but modes of citta (mind) and are not separate elemental dharmas which come together in \\"association\\" (samprayoga) as the VaibhƒÅ·π£ika believed. This view is also expoused at length in Harivarman's Tattvasiddhi.Lin, Qian.

The term is frequently used in the context of emulation, whereby older games or firmware are copied to ROM files on modern computers and can, using a piece of software known as an emulator, be run on a different device than which they were designed for. ROM burners are used to copy ROM images to hardware, such as ROM cartridges, or ROM chips, for debugging and QA testing.  Creation  A ROM dumping device for the Game Boy Advance ROMs can be copied from the read-only memory chips found in cartridge-based games and many arcade machines using a dedicated device in a process known as dumping. For most common home video game systems, these devices are widely available, examples being the Doctor V64, or the Retrode. Dumping ROMs from arcade machines, which are highly customized PCBs, often requires individual setups for each machine along with a large amount of expertise. = Copy protection mechanisms = While ROM images are often used as a means of preserving the history of computer games, they are also often used to facilitate the unauthorized copying and redistribution of modern games. Viewing this as potentially reducing sales of their products, many game companies have incorporated so-called features into newer games which are designed to prevent copying, while still allowing the original game to be played. For instance, the Nintendo GameCube used non-standard 8 cm DVD-like optical media, which for a long time prevented games stored on those discs from being copied. It was not until a security hole was found in Phantasy Star Online Episode I & II that GameCube games could be successfully copied, using the GameCube itself to read the discs. SNK also employed a method of copy prevention on their Neo Geo games, starting with The King of Fighters in 1999, which used an encryption algorithm on the graphics ROMs to prevent them from being played in an emulator. Many thought that this would mark the end of Neo Geo emulation. However, as early as 2000, hackers found a way to decrypt and dump the ROMs successfully, making them playable once again in a Neo Geo emulator. Another company which used to employ methods of copy prevention on their arcade games was Capcom, which is known for its CPS-2 arcade board. This contained a heavy copy protection algorithm which was not broken until 7 years after the system's release in 1993. The original crack by the CPS2Shock Team was not a true emulation of the protection because it used XOR tables to bypass the original encryption and allow the game to play in an emulator. Their stated intent was to wait until CPS-2 games were no longer profitable to release the decryption method (three years after the last game release).CPS2Shock (2001-jan-07) The Future Intent of CPS2shock, accessed 2007-aug-10 The full decryption algorithm was cracked in 2007 by Nicola Salmoria, Andreas Naive and Charles MacDonald of the MAME development team. Another copy prevention technique used in cartridge-games was to have the game attempt to write to ROM. On an authentic cartridge this would do nothing; however, emulators would often allow the write to succeed. Pirate cartridges also often used writable chips instead of ROM. By reading the value back to see whether the write succeeded, the game could tell whether it was running from an authentic cartridge. Alternatively, the game may simply attempt to overwrite critical program instructions, which if successful renders it unplayable. Some games, such as Game Boy games, also had other hardware such as memory bank controllers connected to the cartridge bus. The game would send data to this hardware by attempting to write it to specific areas of ROM; thus, if the ROM were writable, this process would corrupt data. Capcom's latest arcade board is the CPS-3. This was resistant to emulation attempts until June 2007, when the encryption method was reverse-engineered by Andreas Naive. It is currently implemented by MAME and a variant of the CPS-2 emulator Nebula.  Uses  = Emulation = Video game console emulators typically take ROM images as input files. = Software ROM = ROM images are used when developing for embedded computers. Software which is being developed for embedded computers is often written to ROM files for testing on a standard computer before it is written to a ROM chip for use in the embedded systems. = Digital preservation = The lifespan of digital media is rarely great. While black-and-white photographs may survive for a century or more, many digital media can become unreadable after only 10 years. This is beginning to become a problem as early computer systems may be presently fifty or sixty years old while early home video consoles may be almost thirty years old. Due to this aging, there is a significant worry that many early computer and video games may not survive without being transferred to new media. So, those with an interest in preservation are actively seeking older arcade and video games and attempting to dump them to ROM images. When stored on standardized media such as CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs, they can be copied to future media with significantly reduced effort. The trend towards mass digital distribution of ROM image files, while potentially damaging to copyright holders, may also have a positive effect on preservation. While over time many original ROM copies of older games may deteriorate, be broken or thrown away, a copy in file form may be distributed throughout the world, allowing games which would otherwise have been lost a greater chance of survival. = Hacks and fan translations = Once games have been made available in ROM format, it is possible for users to make modifications. This may take the form of altering graphics, changing game levels, tweaking difficulty factor, or even translation into a language for which a game was not originally made available. Hacks can often take humorous forms, as is the case with a hack of the NES version of Mario Bros., titled Afro Mario Brothers, which features the famous brothers wearing Afro haircuts. The Metroid Redesign mod is a hack of Super Metroid that revamps the game and adds new objectives. A large scene has developed to translate games into other languages. Many games receive a release in one part of the world, but not in another. For example, many role- playing video games released in Japan go unreleased in the West and East outside Japan. A group of fan translators will often translate the game themselves to meet demand for titles. For example, the 1995 game Tales of Phantasia was only officially released in Japan; DeJap Translations translated the game's on-screen text into English in 2001. Further to this, a project called Vocals of Phantasia was begun to translate the actual speech from the game. An official English version was not released until March 2006, some five years after the text translation was released. Another example was that of Mother 3, a Japan-only sequel to the cult-favorite Earthbound. In spite of massive fan response and several petitions for an English translation, the only response from Nintendo was that Mother 3 would be translated and released in Europe, which it never was. Instead, the fan website Starmen.net undertook a massive translation project and released the translated version of Mother 3 in October, 2008. The translation was praised by fans and even employees from Nintendo, Square Enix, and other industry professionals. The Japanese N64 game D≈çbutsu no Mori (Animal Forest) has also been translated into English. The game was originally only released on N64 in Japan, but it was ported to GameCube and renamed Animal Crossing. Hacks may range from simple tweaks such as graphic fixes and cheats, to full-blown redesigns of the game, in effect creating an entirely new game using the original as a base.  Similar image types  Image files derived from computer tape are known as tape images, while those derived from floppy disks and CD-ROMs (and other disk formats) are known as disk images. Images copied from optical media are also called ISO images, after one of the standard file systems for optical media, ISO 9660. Creating images from other media is often considerably easier and can often be performed with off-the-shelf hardware. For example, the creation of tape images from games stored on magnetic tapes (from, for example, the Sinclair ZX80 computer) generally involves simply playing the magnetic tape using a standard audio tape player connected to the line-in of a PC sound card. This is then recorded to an audio file and transformed into a tape image file using another program. Likewise, many CD and DVD games may be copied using a standard PC CD/DVD drive.

It was formerly assigned to the genus Micoureus, which was made a subgenus of Marmosa in 2009. The specific epithet was given in honour of Constance Sladen (n√©e Anderson), wife of the naturalist Percy Sladen. She funded the 1902 expedition which collected the type specimen. Description This is one of the larger mouse opossums, with a head=body length of , a tail in length, and weighing from . The fur is thick and woolly, and is grey over most of the body, fading to buffy-yellow on the head and underparts. There are clear, but narrow, rings of black fur around the eyes. The tail is furred only at the base, and is near black for most of its length, but changes suddenly to pale pink along the last third or so. The feet are broad, with stout claws and ridges on the underside of the toes that aid in climbing trees. Females do not have a pouch, but have fifteen teats arranged in a circle - more than in any of this species' closest relatives. Distribution and habitat The opossum is found across northern Bolivia, in the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, and in northern Argentina as far south as Tucum√°n Province. It has also recently been reported from Paraguay. Across this region, it inhabits moist tropical forests, often near the boundary with drier habitats, and has been found from near sea level to montane forests as high as elevation. Biology and behaviour The opossum is arboreal, solitary, and nocturnal, spending most of its time in the forest understory.

Karaikal became a French Colony in 1674 and held control, with occasional interruption from the British and Dutch, until 1954 (de jure in 1956), when it was incorporated into the Republic of India, along with Chandernagore, Mah√©, Yanaon, and Pondich√©ry. Etymology The origin of the word Karaikal is uncertain. The Imperial Gazetteer of British India gives its meaning as 'fish pass'. Both the words ‚ÄòKarai and 'Kal' have several meanings, of which the more acceptable ones are 'lime mix' and 'canal' respectively. Hence it has been suggested that the name may mean a canal built of lime mix, however, no trace of such a canal is evident. History = Kingdom of Tanjore = Before 1739, Karaikal was under the regime and control of Raja Pratap Singh of Tanjore. In 1738, Pierre Beno√Æt Dumas was anxious to extend the French territory in India by smooth means and negotiated with Sahuji of Thanjavur for possession of Karaikal, the fortress of Karakalcheri and five village for 40,000 chakras. On 14 February 1739 the French took possession of Karaikal town, the fort of Karakalcheri and eight dependent villages. At this point, the King of Thanjavur raised the price for the town of Karaikal and the fort of Karakalcheri to 50,000 chakras. He also demanded a loan of 150,000 chakras without interest repayable in three years against the hypothecation of Mayavaram lands, and an annual rent of 4,000 pagodas for five villages. The French agreed to all the terms except for the payment of 150,000 chakras, which was then reduced to 10,000 chakras, while the annual rental was reduced to two or three thousand chakras. The villages received were Kilaiyur, Melaiyur, Puduthurai, Kovilpathu and Tirumalairayanpattinam. Subsequently, two villages were ceded to the French. Pratap Singh, who succeeded the throne, renewed the demand for a loan of 100,000 chakras, and on receipt of the first instalment of 4,000 chakras he assigned eight more villages to the French viz., Codague (Kondagai), Vanjiyur, Arimullimangalam, Niravi, Dharmapuram, Uzhiapathu, Mattakudi (probably Mathalangudi) and Polagam. On 12 February 1740, he sold these villages for 60,000 chakras, which he had assigned only the previous year for 40,000 chakras. = French colony = Colonial Karikal (1931) The same year, Dumas pledged Thirunallar Mahanam for 55,350 chakras and also pledged 33 villages for 60,000 chakras. By a treaty signed on 12 January 1750 Pratap Singh ceded to the French 81 villages around Karaikal and cancelled the annual rent of 2,000 pagodas payable for the villages. This was all the territory the French possessed around Thanjavur when they surrendered to the British in 1761. The territory then passed twice to British control before it was finally handed over to the French in 1816/1817 under the Treaty of Paris, 1814. = Independence struggle = The formation of the Karaikal National Congress on 13 June 1947 and the Karaikal Students' Congress on 31 January 1947 symbolised the first concrete expression of popular desire in Karaikal for independence from French India. The French ruled this district until 31 October 1954, on which date the French flag flying atop the government house at Karaikal was lowered with due military honors before a large gathering of officials and non-officials. Thus the de facto transfer of power took place on 1 November 1954 followed by de jure transfer on 16 August 1962. = Part of India = Even though the territory was handed over to the Republic of India on 1 November 1954, Karaikal's municipal administration was continued pursuant to the Arr√™t√© dated 8 March 1880. This was replaced by the promulgation of the Pondicherry Municipality Act, 1973, with effect from 26 January 1974. Mr. Gaudart was the first Mayor of Karaikal in 1884. Geography Tree stumps and debris remain on Karaikal beach several years after the 2004 tsunami Karaikal is a small coastal enclave which was formerly part of French India.

Ganduri Festival =Karaikal Ammaiyar= Theppa Kulam Karaikal Ammaiyar is one of the 63 nayanmar that lived in Karaikal. She is one of the renowned saints, who devoted their life for lord shiva. She was called \\"ammaiye\\" means mother by lord shiva. She married Paramathathan, a rich merchant of Nagapattinam in 6th century. Paramathathan sent 2 mangoes to his house for eating in lunch time. A Shaiva devotee came there.Ammaiyaar gave the devotee, curd rice and one of the two mangoes which her husband gave earlier. Later, when Ammaiyar's husband came home, Ammaiyar served him the other mango. The mango was very delicious, and her husband requested that the other mango be served. Ammaiyaar went inside kitchen, and Ammaiyar didn't know what to do since the Mango is already served to the adiyaar[siva's devotee]. With Lord Siva's grace a Divine Mango appeared in her palm. Ammaiyaar was very happy and Ammaiyar served the Mango to her husband.As this fruit was divinely sweet and was infinitely delicious compared to the previous one, her husband inquired as to how Ammaiyar obtained this mango. Since her husband was not a proper devotee, Ammaiyaar was afraid of revealing the God's grace. The rule is that God's grace should not be revealed to non-devotees. But there is one more rule that when a husband is asking something, the wife has to truthfully answer his questions. Subsequently, Ammaiyar worshiped Lord's feet and revealed the truth to her husband. Her husband didn't believe it. He asked her to produce another mango with divine help. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva for another mango and said to her Lord that if He didn't give her another Mango, his name will get affected. Immediately Lord gave her a similar mango, which she gave it to her husband. The mango then disappeared, and Paramathathan realised the divine nature of his wife. Paramathathan understood that Ammaiyar was worthy of worship and Ammaiyar cannot be treated as his wife. He then deserted Ammaiyar, becoming a trader and married the daughter of a merchant who then gave birth to their child. After knowing this she went to kailash mountain by her head, since she don't want her feet to touch the sacred mountain and by getting a ghost body as a boon from shiva.

During the 1960s, the company began acquiring many unrelated firms and became one of the largest conglomerates in the United States. At its peak, in addition to many defense-related companies, it also owned both Royal Typewriters and Adler, Moffat major appliances, Stouffer's frozen foods, and various office equipment and furniture companies. Like many conglomerates, the company suffered significant declines in the 1970s, selling off many of its unrelated brands and had largely returned to its defense roots by the 1980s. The company continued to shrink after the ending of the cold war and by the late 1990s was a corporate takeover target. The company was purchased by Northrop Grumman in 2001. History Litton Industries was originally established as an electronics company building navigation, communications and electronic warfare equipment. They diversified and became a much bigger business, with major shipyards, and manufacturing microwave ovens. It was founded in 1953 by American business executive Charles Bates \\"Tex\\" Thornton alongside his associates Roy Ash and Hugh Jamieson. Headquartered in Beverly Hills, California, the original name of the company was 'Electro Dynamics Corporation'. In 1954, with a loan from the Lehman Brothers, Thornton acquired the vacuum tube producer 'Litton Industries Inc' from its founder Charles Litton Sr. for $1.5 million and subsequently adopted its name. Although Litton Industries lacked capital in the beginning, Thornton thought that the U.S. Department of Defense would need more sophisticated weapons and that the demand for another large electronics company will increase. During the years, Litton Industries acquired several other smaller companies and had merged with Monroe Calculating Machine. Monroes used Litton's technological assets and Litton required Monroe's sales and service outlets. During the late 1950s and early 1960s. 50% of Litton's business was with the U.S. Government; besides calculators, they were also producing inertial guidance systems for aircraft, potentiometers, duplexers, etc. In 1961, Litton acquired Ingalls Shipbuilding for $8 million and subsequently ventured into the production of submarines and oil-drilling equipment. By 1963, Litton Industries reached $500 million with a revenue of $393.8 million. In 1973, after several years of disappointing sales, Thornton replaced Ash with Fred O'Green as president of the company. With the new strategy, Litton sold some of its profit-losing subsidiaries and focused on the profitable ones. The company also succeeded to make a 1.6 billion deal with the Saudi Arabian Air Force. The profits of the company increased from $44 million in 1979 to $78 million in 1983. During the 1980s, Litton dropped its businesses in publishing, medical products, office furniture, and microwaves and shifted the production to sophisticated technology. As a result of that, the company bought the electronic firms Itek Corp. and Core Laboratories. In the early 1990s, Litton Industries split into separate military and commercial companies. The US$2 billion commercial business, which included Litton's oilfield services, business, and automated assembly line operations, was named Western Atlas, Inc. In 1998, Litton Industries bought TASC, Inc.. In 2000, TASC sold three stand-alone commercial operations: Adesso Software, WSI (Weather Services International) Corporation and Emerge. The company reported sales of $5.6 billion and a net income of $218 million for the 2000 fiscal year. On December 21, 2000, in a joint statement, Litton Industries and Northrop Grumman announced that the latter will acquire Litton Industries shares in a transaction worth $5.1 billion. The transaction was completed on May 31, 2001 and Northrop Grumman official acquired Litton Industries.

It is the first game in the Panzer Dragoon series. The game follows hunter Keil Fluge, who becomes the rider of a powerful dragon. The player moves an aiming reticle (representing the dragon's laser and Kyle's gun) and shoots enemies while the dragon flies through 3D environments on a predetermined track. As one of six games available at the Sega Saturn's surprise North American launch, Panzer Dragoon was the first game created by Team Andromeda. The game also marked the directorial debut of game designer Yukio Futatsugi, who was 25 years old at the time of the game's release. Panzer Dragoon received positive reviews, both in 1995 and in recent retrospective coverage. It was Electronic Gaming Monthlys \\"Game of the Month\\" in July 1995, named \\"Best Saturn Game of 1995\\" in EGMs 1996 Buyers' Guide, and ranked 140th in EGMs \\"The Greatest 200 Videogames of their time\\" in 2006. In particular, its original art direction and post-apocalyptic science fantasy universe gained critical acclaim. Panzer Dragoon was ported to Windows and PlayStation 2, and was followed by Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996) and Panzer Dragoon Saga (1998) for Saturn and Panzer Dragoon Orta (2002) for Xbox, which includes the original Panzer Dragoon as a bonus feature. A remake of Panzer Dragoon was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment in 2020 for Nintendo Switch, Stadia, Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Gameplay The dragon and its rider flying through level 1. The yellow aiming reticle appears in the center and the radar in the top right corner. Panzer Dragoon spans six levels, each lasting about five minutes, with a variety of boss battles. Over the course of the game, the plot is revealed through cutscenes using the game's own graphic engine. Gameplay consists of a player controlling a flying dragon and his rider through an aiming reticle that can be moved over the whole screen with the D-pad; the player must shoot a variety of enemies (ranging from machines to monsters) in a 3D post- apocalyptic fantasy environment of barren landscapes and mysterious ruins of a fallen civilization. Progression through the levels is made at a predetermined pace, as the player is constantly set along a rail of gameplay. The only time the game pauses is during boss battles. The field of vision can be directed with the aiming reticle on the x and y-axis, but the overall direction of travel is predetermined. The dragon follows the reticle movements, allowing the player to avoid enemy projectiles and obstacles. The player has a full, 360-degree field of view, and can quickly look left, right, forward, and behind the dragon. Enemies come from all directions, varying in size and health, and also appear on an on-screen radar that monitors the dragon's surroundings. Two weapons are available: the rider's handgun, which can be fired with a single button press when an enemy enters the aiming reticle, and the homing laser fired by the dragon, which can lock on up to eight enemies by moving the reticle over them while holding down the fire button. Some situations with many enemies on screen require the use of the lock-on laser, while in others, quick gunshots to weak spots will prove more efficient. Plot In the distant future, thousands of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. One nation, the Empire, has discovered a black tower in the middle of a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world. The introduction movie opens with the protagonist, Keil Fluge (unnamed in the North American version), hunting in a canyon. After seeing an Imperial flying battleship in the sky, he is attacked by two creatures and chases one of them to a large, ancient complex built directly into the rock. He explores the ruin, and sees relics of old technology still hanging from the ceilings. Another gigantic creature suddenly attacks him, and though his weapon is useless against the armored creature, a rumbling triggers a cave in, which crushes the monster and saves Keil. From the newly created hole, an armored, blue dragon flies down the cavern with a rider across its shoulders, being chased by an even bigger black dragon as the cavern is destroyed in an explosion. Regaining consciousness outside, Keil sees the two dragons locked in combat in the air before him. Dodging a blast from the black dragon, the blue dragon's rider is then hit by single shot to the chest, and the black dragon flies away. The blue dragon flies towards Keil. A psychic connection is made between the rider and Keil, who is told not to let the black dragon reach the black tower. The rider then dies and Keil picks up his fallen gun, climbs atop the dragon and flies away, determined to finish the rider's quest. During the first level of the game, Keil and his dragon fly through a drowned city, where they encounter a small Imperial patrol ship. That ship sends a report to a large fleet of ships flying above the clouds. It is revealed that the Imperial forces are specifically searching for the blue dragon. The second level is a desert, where Keil and the dragon encounter gigantic worm-like creatures. At the stormy edge of the desert, they are confronted by the Black Dragon, which is defeated and speeds away. The third level is a mountainous landscape at night-time where Keil and the dragon get reacquainted with the Imperial forces, which were exploring ancient ruins. These encounters illustrate the ongoing conflict between the Imperial forces and the ancient machines and creatures. The fourth level is an ancient facility in which Keil and the dragon are pursued by both Imperial airships and cybernetic sentinels left behind by the ancient civilization. During the fifth level, they defeat a large armada of the most powerful Imperial ships over a forested area. A cutscene then shows a fleet of dragon-like creatures coming out of the tower to attack the Imperial forces. The sixth level features the black dragon and Keil racing through the battle-scarred Imperial capital. During this, they are both waylaid by the creatures and machines seen attacking the Imperial fleet around the tower while also being fired on by Imperial defenses. The black dragon then reaches the Tower and is mutated into a gigantic super-dragon and begins a climactic battle with Keil and the blue dragon, after which the black dragon is defeated and falls into the ocean. In the ending cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While traveling down a long corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting him from the saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on to the core of the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away. Development Director Yukio Futatsugi Panzer Dragoon was created in the early 1990s as the Japanese video game company Sega was preparing to release its Saturn console. In 1993, as the Saturn lacked third-party games, Sega asked its developers for game ideas; according to art director Manabu Kusunoki, Sega asked for shooting game ideas to add variety to the Saturn's launch library. Twenty-three-year- old Yukio Futatsugi, who had joined Sega only two years before, proposed several concepts, including Panzer Dragoon. Futatsugi became the head of Team Andromeda, a development team that Sega assembled for the project in early 1994 and was built around the duo formed by Futatsugi and Kusunoki. Development lasted almost a year, with a staff of 15. The project was designed as arcade-style, as core members of the team like Kusunoki came from Sega's arcade department. Team Andromeda wanted to create a fully 3D arcade game, having worked on similar games such as Out Run which were not truly 3D. With influences including Space Harrier, Starblade, Star Fox, and RayForce, the project became a 3D rail shooter. Usually, in 3D shooters, the player rides a 3D object like a jet fighter or a tank. Futatsugi and Kusunoki decided, however, that it would be more original for the player to ride an armored dragon, a living creature which would also allow for richer animations. The game's name originates from its original concept, referred to as \\"armored dragon\\" (kiko-ryu in Japanese), but Futatsugi, feeling that this was too bland, decided to translate it to German. With this basic concept in mind, the creators had 3 months to define a visual identity and a setting for their game, prior to development. The game would be set in a post-apocalyptic science fantasy world, featuring ruins and relics of a fallen civilization with mankind rebuilding itself while surviving, enduring and so forth in that era of perdition. A theme presented in many anime series at that time. Futatsugi was particularly influenced by one of his childhood readings, The Long Afternoon of Earth, a science-fiction novel by Brian Aldiss, in which one side of the earth became perpetually hot, the other perpetually cold. The first presentation video featured a green dragon, in line with traditional European/medieval depictions, however the team quickly decided to change it and make it \\"more sci-fi\\". In order for the dragon to be more original, it was made blue and covered in a white, bone-like armor. The dragon was supposed to come from the ancient times, so ruins and ancient flying technology also featured this white, shell-like material. The overall fantasy look of the game's world, which mixed natural and technological elements, was also chosen in order to set it apart from classic science-fiction 3D games of the time. This world, as well as dragon and character designs, were mainly the work of Manabu Kusunoki, who took inspiration from various sources, including anime and manga, and who pushed the art direction toward a more Turkish/Ottoman style to avoid the European aesthetics of the early presentation video. Critics have noted similarities with the works of French artist Moebius (notably his comic book Arzach,) of whom Kusunoki was a fan, as well as with Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, and David Lynch's Dune movie. Kentaro Yoshida, texturing and modeling artist, described the creation process as similar in style to Star Wars, in that it \\"made an unearthly world appear so real\\". Takashi Iwade, in charge of the opening cutscene and character models, designed the enemies using a lot of various influences: \\"I got inspiration from antique clocks and various industrial products from the era of the industrial revolution for mechanics, and myriapods, marine mollusks, ammonite, and a rusty fishing boat for creatures when I started thinking of the original battleship\\". The team wanted a famous artist to make the game's cover art. Manabu Kusunoki suggested Moebius, who accepted, and the team sent him designs that he was to interpret. The resulting illustration was used as the cover art for the Japanese release of the game. The Saturn's hardware was new to the team, and it was their first attempt at creating an original environment. It was also Futatsugi's first year working as a full developer at Sega, so he was only able to do simple things while having a clear vision of what he wanted, which helped him to keep the overall style pure, with stark and minimalist cutscenes. Similarly, Iwade kept the enemies easy to understand visually, with simple shapes, and this overall simple style ended up fitting well with the Saturn's hardware. Then, Team Andromeda set to work on elaborating an extensive back story, and Futatsugi, to be original and to avoid using Japanese or English, went so far as to create a new language for the game: a mix of Ancient Greek, Latin and Russian. This was apparently inspired by the anime The Wings of Honneamise, of which team members were fans and which also features an invented language. After the story and art were established, the team set to work on the graphics. Working on new hardware proved difficult for the young team, and the game ended up missing the initial deadline given by Sega, which was the Saturn Japanese launch on November 1994. One of the problems was that the Saturn hardware was only finalized in mid-1994, and without actual Saturn prototype to test their progress, the programmers initially had to work with hypothetical hardware performance. Team Andromeda created its own graphics library and mapping tools instead of using Sega's, in order to make the most of their first game on the new system. The game's graphics and cutscenes were done with Softimage, and the 3D elements were programmed on SGI workstations using OpenGL. The programmers were eventually able to transition to the debug Saturn they had received, but the process was difficult and the game had a very low frame rate at first, before it could be locked at 20 FPS. The six levels of Panzer Dragoon are barren landscapes with ancient ruins, which is consistent with the \\"simple\\" style appropriate for the Saturn. The first two levels that the team programmed, a desert (level 2) and a forest (level 5), did not have any objects or anything besides sand and forest effects, again because the team was unsure how far the hardware could be pushed. Keeping CPU limitations in mind, simple tornado effects were added to level 2, so that it did not look too bland. Work on the soundtrack began after completion of the game, similar to the way movie soundtracks are made. The idea was to create music that would specifically reflect each level art-style and events. As the game had an \\"on rail\\" progression system, the developers knew exactly where the player would be at any given time, so they showed videos to the composer and asked him to write specifically timed pieces that would match the player's progression in each level. The soundtrack was outsourced to Yoshitaka Azuma, who was composing music for NHK TV programs at that time. The music of Panzer Dragoon is a mix between orchestral and synthesizer tracks. Sega of America made several alterations to the game to make the North American release more challenging. These alterations were retained in the PAL version. Releases Panzer Dragoon was released in Japan on March 10, 1995, North America on May 11, 1995, and Europe on August 30, 1995, on the Sega Saturn console. It was followed by Panzer Dragoon II Zwei (1996) and Panzer Dragoon Saga (1998), both for Saturn, and Panzer Dragoon Orta (2002) for Xbox. In 1996, Panzer Dragoon was ported to Windows. Identical to the Saturn version except with a higher resolution, this version was also included as a bonus in Panzer Dragoon Orta. Aside from providing the source code, Team Andromeda had no involvement in the development of the Windows version. An updated version of Panzer Dragoon was included in the Japan-only Sega Ages 2500 collection for PlayStation 2 in 2003. The port was handled by development studio Land Ho!, and features the original Saturn game and an \\"arrange\\" version with anti-aliasing filter, better texturing, and improved 3D models for the dragon and some enemies. The \\"arrange\\" version also adds unlockable extras such as level selection and artworks, in the form of a \\"Pandora's Box\\" option menu. Reception Panzer Dragoon received positive reviews, both in 1995 and in retrospective coverage. Though sales were not as high as Sega expected, possibly due to the success of Sony's PlayStation console over the Saturn, they were substantial enough for Sega to develop sequels. As one of the first Saturn titles, the game was highly anticipated by journalists after its appearance in promotional material. A reviewer for Next Generation said the game \\"orchestrates incredible story animation with brilliant, 3D flight graphics to create what is, basically, the ultimate evolution of Space Harrier.\\" He also highly praised the gameplay, particularly the variety of enemies, the difficulty slope, and the controls. Ed Semrad and Danyon Carpenter from Electronic Gaming Monthly praised the game for its \\"innovative game play\\" and its \\"awe-inspiring visuals\\" from the opening cinematic to the backgrounds and the dragon's animations. Al Manuel and Ken Williams criticized the game's lack of diversity in weapons and its predetermined progression; but the four EGM reviewers agreed that it was a must-have game for Saturn owners. Similarly, The Unknown Gamer from GamePro called the game a \\"masterpiece\\", highlighted its high- quality graphics and music, and described the story as \\"captivat[ing]\\". However, the journalist noted the game's overall difficulty \\"will single out all but advanced players\\" with its lack of power-ups or extra lives of any kind. Nevertheless, the game was seen as a good example of the Saturn's capabilities. In contrast, a reviewer from Maximum said that the game was much too easy even on the highest difficulty setting, greatly reducing its already low longevity. He also said the gameplay would be too simplistic for many players, with its on-rails shooting and selection of only two weapons, but was overall very positive in his assessment of the game, highly praising the 360 degrees of rotation and most especially the textured 3D graphics of the enemies, settings, and bosses. Patrick Baggatta from Game Players stated that while the game may come off as \\"just a simple shooter\\", it is at least a \\"very good one\\" that \\"puts a twist on the tired formula\\", again praising the game play and the variety in camera angles. Chris Gore from VideoGames & Computer Entertainment named the game \\"the best shooter since Star Fox\\", and a must- have for fantasy and sci-fi fans, with its \\"eerie\\" atmosphere noted by editor Betty Hallock. While the story itself was said to be \\"somewhat typical\\" and editor Chris Bieniek criticized the on-rail aspect, Gore noted the game's \\"spectacular visuals\\", and presented it as one of the Saturn's system sellers. Famitsu magazine's Reader Cross Review gave the game a 9 out of 10 in April 1995, and it was named \\"Best Saturn Game of 1995\\" by Electronic Gaming Monthly in their 1996 Buyers' Guide. The game's universe itself was deemed \\"coolly surreal\\" by Entertainment Weekly reviewer Albert Kim, who thought the game's seven-minute \\"movie-quality\\" introduction was \\"gorgeous\\" and \\"nearly overshadowed the game itself\\". Kim argued that Panzer Dragoon could be seen as a \\"lyrical and exhilarating epic\\", a \\"story, not just a game\\" which could pave the way for a \\"transformation\\" of the videogame industry. Film director Steven Spielberg approached Team Andromeda to say he was impressed by the game's presentation at the 1995 E3 show. James Mielke from online game magazine 1UP.com gave Panzer Dragoon a retroactive review of 8/10 for what the game offered in 1995, but gave it a modern score of 6/10. Mielke highlighted the music as \\"one of the finest game soundtracks ever produced,\\" but said that the game itself \\"staggers a bit under the glaring light of a critical rereview[sic]\\", arguing it is \\"little more than Space Harrier with a 3D camera and cut-scenes.\\" By contrast, Levi Buchanan from IGN gave the game a retrospective score of 9/10, opining that \\"the fact that Panzer Dragoon holds up as well in 2008 as it did in 1995 is a just testament to the staying power of good art and tight gameplay.\\" Kurt Kalata, in a Gamasutra retrospective, also praised its art and universe, but said the actual game looked \\"a bit cut and dried\\" compared to its sequels. Panzer Dragoon ranked 140th in EGM‚Ä≤s \\"The Greatest 200 Videogames of their time\\" feature published in 2006.  Remake  A remake of Panzer Dragoon was developed by MegaPixel Studio and published by Forever Entertainment in March 2020 for Nintendo Switch. It was released on Stadia on 1 June, with PlayStation 4 and Steam versions later in 2020. The remake features updated graphics and an optional new control system that allows players to aim independently of movement with the second control stick. Switch reviewers criticized the updated controls and short length, and Metro felt the art direction was inferior, with \\"extraneous detail that ruins the mood and makes the fantasy world seem a lot more generic\\". Nintendo Life concluded that it was \\"a decent take on an all-time classic that goes some way to modernising it, but doesn't quite nail the landing\\".

His report received wide attention among the botanists and general public, comparable only to the discovery of two other plants in the 19th century, namely Victoria amazonica and Rafflesia arnoldii.Strliƒç, Matija. \\"Dr. Friderik Velbiƒç, 1806‚Äì1872\\". Proteus, the journal of the Natural Sciences Society of Slovenia. Year 61, No. 9/10 (pp. 396-404). ISSN 0033-1805. In Angola, Welwitsch also discovered Rhipsalis baccifera, the only cactus species naturally occurring outside the New World. It was found a few years later in Sri Lanka too, which reignited the now already one and a half century old debate on the origin of cacti in Africa and Asia. At the time, the debate concluded with the conviction of numerous authors that they were introduced and spread by migratory birds. Among the botanists, Welwitsch is also known after his descriptions of numerous other plants, for example Cyphostemma macropus, Tavaresia angolense, Dorstenia psilurus, Sarcocaulon mossamedense, Acanthosicyos horridus, Pachypodium namaquanum and Pachypodium lealii. The earthstar fungus Geastrum welwitschii, a species he collected in Spain, is named in his honor. Tonhof in Maria Saal, the birthplace of Welwitsch Biography Friedrich Welwitsch was born at Maria Saal (Slovene: Gospa Sveta), Duchy of Carinthia, Austrian Empire, to the wealthy family of Joseph Anton Welwich, a local judicial officer and town councillor of Salzburg, and Genovefa Mayr. The family name, which in today's Slovene spelling would be Velbiƒç, points at Slovene ethnicity. It is known that Welwitsch's mother was a German, while his father's family was probably of Slovene origin. However, this has not been definitely proven.Wraber, Tone. \\"Prvi odkritelj Blagayevega volƒçina je bil (slovenski?) Koro≈°ec\\" [The first discoverer of Daphne blagayana was a (Slovene?) Carinthian]. Proteus, the journal of the Natural Sciences Society of Slovenia. Year 61, No. 9/10 (pp. 391). ISSN 0033-1805. It is not known whether Welwitsch spoke Slovene although he worked as a physician in a Slovene-speaking environment for two years. This was in Postojna, where he continued to develop his interest in cryptogamic flora. Contrary to the wishes of his father, who wanted him to study law,Hermann Th. Schneider, Streets and Squares in Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, no year, p.253 Friedrich Welwitsch studied medicine and botany in Vienna and worked as a physician in the Austrian provinces of Carniola and Moravia, but his interest in the plant kingdom, where he discovered a number of plants hitherto unknown, was so great that in 1839 he abandoned the medical profession altogether. With the financial aid of a W√ºrttemberg botanical association Welwitsch travelled to Portugal where he became the director of the botanical gardens. His claim to fame came when with the further support of the Portuguese agent of the W√ºrttemberg botanical society Schneider, p. 253 he did research on the Canary Islands, on Madeira, and, in the interest of the Portuguese government, from 1853 in Angola, then a Portuguese colony. There, in 1859, in the Namib Desert in the southern part of Angola he discovered Welwitschia mirabilis, a unique member of the Gnetophyta, also known as Tumboa,Brockhaus Encyclopedia vol. 20, Leipzig 1935, p.219 and vol. 19, Leipzig 1934, pp. 170f. with a subterranean stem of 50 cm diameter Schneider, p.253 that can grow up to 30 meters deep, and with only two leaves of up to 2 m long, the longest-lived leaves (1,500 to 2,000 years) in the plant kingdom.Namibweb This plant, whose common name is Tree tumbo,University of Connecticut a single species of dioecious perennial, is considered a gymnosperm, however, the relationship with other species in this group is still not clear. After eight strenuous years of exploring and collecting, Welwitsch returned to Portugal in 1861. Because of better working conditions, he went to London in 1863. There, he worked at first at the Natural History Museum and later at the Kew Gardens, categorising and cataloguing its enormous collection. Only in the publication Sertum Angolense, he described 12 new categories and 48 new species. He left his precious collection to the London Natural History Museum. However, having financed his Angolan years, the Portuguese government claimed the estate. The case was settled only after a three-year suit: one series of his collection went to Lisbon, the second remained in London. Welwitsch was buried in the Kensal Green Cemetery where the slab over his grave reads: \\"Frederikus Welwitsch, M.D. - Florae angolensis investigatorum princeps - Nat. in Carinthia 5 Feb 1806 - Ob.

She is the owner of Chez Panisse, a Berkeley, California restaurant famous for its organic, locally grown ingredients and for pioneering California cuisine, which she opened in 1971. Waters has written the books Chez Panisse Cooking (with Paul Bertolli), The Art of Simple Food I and II, and 40 Years of Chez Panisse. Her memoir, Coming to my Senses: The Making of a Counterculture Cook was published in September 2017 and released in paperback in May 2018. Waters created the Chez Panisse Foundation in 1996, and the Edible Schoolyard program at the Martin Luther King Middle School in Berkeley. She is a national public policy advocate for school lunch reform and universal access to healthy, organic foods. Her influence in the fields of organic foods and nutrition is typified by Michelle Obama's White House organic vegetable garden.  Background  Waters was born in Chatham Borough, New Jersey, on April 28, 1944, to Charles Allen Waters, a Rutgers University graduate who was a management consultant, and Margaret Waters, a homemaker. Alice graduated from the University of California, Berkeley after transferring from UC Santa Barbara. She received a degree in French Cultural Studies in 1967. While at UC Berkeley, she studied abroad in France, where she shopped for local produce and prepared fresh, simple foods to enhance the table experience. During her time in France, she says she \\"lived at the bottom of a market street\\" and \\"took everything in by osmosis\\". She brought this style of food preparation back to Berkeley, where she popularized the concept of market-fresh cooking, using the local products available in Northern California. She claims, enigmatically, that food is a way of life and not just something to eat.  Political involvement  During her time at UC Berkeley, Waters became active in the Free Speech Movement, which was sweeping across the campus. Waters worked on the congressional campaign of Robert Scheer, an anti-Vietnam War politician. She often cooked for and entertained her fellow campaigners.  Additional influences  Waters eventually returned to Europe, where she first trained at a Montessori school in London, and then spent time traveling in Turkey and then in France once again. Principles of the Montessori method, which emphasize practical and hands-on activities for children, are evident in Waters's idea of \\"edible education\\" and her Edible Schoolyard, which engages children in the preparation of fruits and vegetables that they tend to with the supervision of their teachers. After training in London, Waters next traveled to Turkey, which she credits with influencing her approach to hospitality and deepening her respect for local communities. In his book Alice Waters and Chez Panisse, Thomas McNamee recounts Waters's experience in Turkey, where a young Turkish boy shared tea and a small bit of cheese with Waters and her traveling companions, even though he had very little. This small act of kindness had an effect on Waters's approach to hospitality and generosity in her own restaurant. From Turkey, Waters then returned to France, where she embarked upon a year-long journey. Her travels solidified her love of all things food and French and inspired her to return to California and open Chez Panisse. Waters counts Elizabeth David, the English cookbook author and writer, as one of her influences. She also credits Richard Olney, an American authority on French food who spent much of his life living in France, with influencing her simple, rustic cuisine. Olney introduced Waters to Lucien and Lulu Peyraud, owners of the Domaine Tempier vineyard in Provence. Lulu Peyraud's vineyard cooking significantly influenced Waters's cooking and her menus at Chez Panisse. In her foreword to Olney's book, Lulu's Proven√ßal Table, Waters wrote: \\"Lucien and Lulu's warmhearted enthusiasm for life, their love for the pleasures of the table, their deep connection to the beautiful earth of the South of France ‚Äì these were things I had seen at the movies. But this was for real. I felt immediately as if I had come home to second family.\\" In addition, Waters has said that she learned Chinese cooking from Cecilia Chiang, and the two became lifelong friends. Waters has said that what Chiang did to popularize Chinese cuisine in America is what Julia Child did for French cuisine.  Chef Alice  = Background = In 1971, Waters opened Chez Panisse, which she named for a favorite character in a trilogy of Marcel Pagnol films. From the beginning, the restaurant was a collaborative effort; one notable collaboration was with Jeremiah Tower, who helped create some of the recipes that she later published under her name. Tower took the organic ingredients and melded them into a more refined menu. Chez Panisse was intended to serve primarily as a place where Waters could entertain her friends. Realizing the difficulty in sourcing fresh, high-quality ingredients, Waters began building a network of local farmers, artisans, and producers, and continues to source the restaurant's ingredients through her local network. Waters opened the upstairs Chez Panisse Caf√©, a concept championed by Tower, in 1980. Caf√© serves an a la carte menu for lunch and dinner. In 1984, Waters opened Caf√© Fanny, named after her daughter, between the wine shop of Kermit Lynch and Acme Bread. Caf√© Fanny, which served breakfast and lunch in a casual, European-caf√© setting, closed in 2012. Then Waters mainly focused on the importance of organic farmers. Through Chez Panisse foundation, the project called \\"Edible Schoolyard\\" was organized in order to make an environment for the students to learn how to grow their own food and prepare it. = Dedication to organic food = Central to the operations and philosophy of Chez Panisse is Waters's and the restaurant's dedication to using organic ingredients. Waters has become a crusader for organic foods, believing that they are both better for the environment and for people's health in addition to tasting superior to commercially grown, non- organic foods. Waters became an organic devotee almost by accident, claiming that what she was originally after was taste. She says: \\"When I opened up Chez Panisse, I was only thinking about taste. And in doing that, I ended up at the doorstep of [organic farmers].\\" Waters's current organic food agenda includes reforming the USDA school lunch program to include organic, local fruits and vegetables and changing the way America eats, but her passion for organics started at her restaurant, where she discovered that organic ingredients were the essential element necessary to create delicious food.  Activism and public policy influence  Waters's effort to promote fresh, sustainable food grown by local farms has extended into her work as a food activist and humanitarian. Waters has always been an outspoken supporter of the restaurant's approach to food, cooking, and supporting the local community, but has more recently formalized her efforts through the Chez Panisse Foundation. In celebration of the restaurant's 25th anniversary in 1996, Waters founded the Chez Panisse Foundation, whose mission is to transform public education by using food to teach, nurture, and empower young people. In particular, the Foundation has worked with the Berkeley Unified School District to develop a public school curriculum that is integrated with the school dining services and incorporates growing, cooking, and sharing food at the table into the school day in order to build a humane and sustainable future for the school's students. The Chez Panisse Foundation is a publicly supported 501(c)(3) organization.  Edible Schoolyard and Edible Education  The primary work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has been to establish and sustain the Edible Schoolyard program at Berkeley's Martin Luther King, Jr. Middle School. The Edible Schoolyard was established in 1995 and is a organic garden and kitchen classroom. Students at the middle school are involved in growing, harvesting, and preparing the foods from the garden, with the aim of promoting the environmental and social well-being of the school community. Waters's work at the Edible Schoolyard has also developed into her School Lunch Initiative, which has the broader goal of bringing school children into a new relationship with food by making a healthy, fresh, sustainable meal a part of the school day. The School Lunch Initiative is a collaborative project with the Center for Ecoliteracy, also in Berkeley, and is also the topic of a series of studies through the Center for Weight and Health, at UC Berkeley. The School Lunch Initiative is focused on bringing wholesome school lunch to the 10,000 students in the Berkeley Unified School District. In 2005, the Chez Panisse Foundation provided a grant to Berkeley schools to hire Ann Cooper as the Director of Nutrition Services for the district. Cooper and the Foundation eliminated almost all processed foods from the district and introduced organic fruits and vegetables to the daily menu, all while staying within the district's budget. Waters's vision is to teach subjects such as history, science, and art through the vehicle of food. In September 2010, the Center for Weight and Health at UC Berkeley, Center for Ecoliteracy, and Chez Panisse Foundation released an evaluation report on the School Lunch Initiative. The report tracked elementary and middle school students over three years to determine the effects of the School Lunch Initiative on children's eating habits and knowledge. The report found that students in schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components ate more daily servings of fruit and vegetables than students in schools with lesser developed programs, and that they scored higher on food knowledge assessments. Schools with highly developed School Lunch Initiative components integrated kitchen and garden classes into the school curriculum, in addition to overhauling the school lunch program. Although the work of the Chez Panisse Foundation has focused primarily on the Berkeley Unified School District, Waters has become a vocal and familiar advocate for school lunch reform and activism at the national level, as well. She encouraged President Bill Clinton to plant a White House garden. In 2009, she appeared on the CBS television program \\"60 Minutes,\\" and made a public call for President Obama to plant an organic garden at the White House to catalyze change in the US food system. Michelle Obama, in conjunction with her anti-obesity campaign Let's Move!, planted the White House organic vegetable garden that year. An article in the San Francisco Chronicle states that: = Edible Schoolyard affiliate programs = In addition to the Edible Schoolyard in Berkeley, there are five affiliate Edible Schoolyard programs around the country. These include Edible Schoolyards in New Orleans, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Greensboro, North Carolina. = Other advocacy projects = , Waters is working to extend free school meals to all public school children in the United States. She hopes to expand programs like the Edible Schoolyard and the School Lunch Initiative in order to reach schools across the US. She supported the 2010 Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act, and believes that providing all public school students with free food in school would build the foundation for a healthier and more sustainable food culture in the US. In 2003, Waters helped create the Yale Sustainable Food Project, which aims to make sustainable food an important part of university- level education. The project maintains an on-campus organic farm and integrates organic, local products into the university's dining program  Slow Food  Since 2002, Waters has served as a Vice President of Slow Food International, an organization dedicated to preserving local food traditions, protecting biodiversity, promoting small-scale quality products around the world. She was drawn to the Slow Food movement because of its work in passing food knowledge and traditions to future generations.

Antheridia consist of a thin cellular layer that holds many sperm inside. Here, the diagram of a liverwort antheridium is shown. An antheridium is a haploid structure or organ producing and containing male gametes (called antherozoids or sperm). The plural form is antheridia, and a structure containing one or more antheridia is called an androecium. \\"Androecium\\" is also used as the collective term for the stamens of flowering plants. Antheridia are present in the gametophyte phase of cryptogams like bryophytes and ferns. Many algae and some fungi, for example ascomycetes and water moulds, also have antheridia during their reproductive stages. In gymnosperms and angiosperms, the male gametophytes have been reduced to pollen grains and in most of these the antheridia have been reduced to a single generative cell within the pollen grain. During pollination, this generative cell divides and gives rise to sperm cells. The female counterpart to the antheridium in cryptogams is the archegonium, and in flowering plants is the gynoecium. An antheridium typically consists of sterile cells and spermatogenous tissue. The sterile cells may form a central support structure or surround the spermatogenous tissue as a protective jacket. The spermatogenous cells give rise to spermatids via mitotic cell division. In some bryophytes, the antheridium is borne on an antheridiophore, a stalk-like structure that carries the antheridium at its apex.

The novel focuses on a handful of rowdy and often sexually promiscuous, spoiled bohemian college students at a liberal arts college in 1980s New Hampshire, primarily focusing on three of them who find themselves in a love triangle. The novel is written in first person narrative, and the story is told from the points of view of various characters. The book was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002. Ellis himself has remarked that of all the film adaptations of his books, The Rules of Attraction came closest to capturing his sensibility and recreating the world he created in his novels.Bret Easton Ellis - The Onion A.V. Club interview, 22 April 2009. Plot summary The novel is written in the first-person, continuing the aesthetic of Ellis' earlier Less Than Zero, and is told from the points of view of multiple characters. The main narrators are three students: Paul, Sean, and Lauren. A number of other characters also provide first-hand accounts throughout the story, which takes place at the fictional Camden College, a liberal arts school on the East Coast of the United States. The three main characters (who rarely attend class) end up in a love triangle within a sequence of drug runs, \\"Dressed to Get Screwed\\" parties, and \\"End of the World\\" parties. The story begins and ends midway through a sentence (the first word in the book being 'and', the last words are 'and she') in order to give the effect that it begins somewhere closer to the middle, rather than at a true beginning (in medias res). Another interpretation is that the story has neither a beginning nor an ending, signifying the endless cycle of debauchery in which the characters of the novel engage. This is sometimes mistaken by readers as a typographical error or the result of a missing page, but was purposely written by Ellis. The novel ends in a similar fashion, with the last sentence cut off before its end. Characters =Sean Bateman= Sean is a twenty-one-year-old student from a wealthy family. He is very promiscuous and a heavy substance abuser, as well as a drug dealer in the employ of Rupert Guest. He becomes romantically involved with Lauren, a relationship he considers to be true love. It is also implied that Sean is bisexual, as he apparently becomes involved in a sexual relationship with Paul Denton. However, whether these encounters are real or simply a product of Paul's imagination is left ambiguous; Paul narrates sexual incidents between himself and Sean, while such incidents are absent from Sean's own narration. Sean is very bitter, cynical, and rather dim-witted, and is prone to self-loathing as well. He is also heavily implied to be somewhat of a sociopath, showing incredibly impulsive behavior (sleeping with Lauren's friend Judy, and at one point, breaking a box of singles he owns for no reason at all) and having no consideration for other people. He attempts suicide at multiple points in the book, first by hanging, then by slashing his wrist with a dull razor, and then by overdose after a falling out with Lauren. A major subplot in the novel is Sean's debt to Rupert, a violent townie drug dealer who often threatens to kill him. The character is the brother of the notorious Patrick Bateman and has also appeared in Ellis's other novels, American Psycho, The Informers and Glamorama. =Lauren Hynde= Lauren is a painter and poet who has sexual relations with several boys on campus, all the while pining for Victor, her boyfriend who left Camden and headed to Europe. She is often depressed and very emotional. She is in her senior year at Camden. At the beginning of the novel, it is revealed that Lauren lost her virginity at a party during her freshman year at Camden, where she got so intoxicated that she passed out in bed with another student only to awaken and find herself being raped by a pair of townies. She becomes romantically involved with Sean Bateman halfway through the book, even though she holds Sean in contempt and considers the relationship nothing but a way to pass the time before Victor comes back from Europe. She was also in a relationship with Paul before the events of the book take place. The character reappears as a main character in Glamorama, in which she becomes reacquainted with Victor after having become a successful model and actress. =Paul Denton= Paul is a young bisexual man who used to date Lauren. He is extremely attracted to Sean and claims that in bed Sean is \\"crazed, an untamed animal, it was almost scary\\" yet these thoroughly described accounts are entirely absent from Sean's entries. For example, the night Paul writes an account of his and Sean's first sexual encounter after the two talk in Paul's bedroom, Sean writes in his own account that he simply went home after talking to Paul, the two entries therefore lying in contradiction to one another. However, the true details of this relationship remain ambiguous and open to the reader's interpretation. Paul also had relationships with two other important characters, Mitchell and Richard (Dick). Paul is highly intelligent and passionate, but is not above obscuring these facts in the course of seduction. Several characters in the book remark upon his physical attractiveness, brought out by Roman features and soft blond hair. Paul's relationship with his mother, Eve, is complex; she yearns to reach out to him but is led towards iciness by Paul's flippancy, which in turn feeds their animosity. =Supporting characters= *Victor Johnson ‚Äì Lauren's boyfriend. Victor took the term off to backpack through Europe. During his time in Europe, he sleeps with many people and abuses many drugs. His entries consist of long diatribes listing his adventures, including a search for a girl named Jaime, who he claims to love. Lauren yearns for him, anxiously awaiting his return, and when he does come back to New Hampshire, he is not interested in seeing her at all. He is the main character in Ellis' later novel, Glamorama. *Clay ‚Äì The protagonist of Less Than Zero, aka \\"the guy from L.A.\\", who narrates one chapter of the novel. His trademark lines begin \\"People are afraid to ...\\". Still unhappy while at Camden, Clay longs to return home to L.A.; he wishes the reverse in Less Than Zero. *Rupert Guest ‚Äì A violent drug dealer and Sean's supplier. A major subplot in the book is Sean's debt to him. *Richard \\"Dick\\" Jared ‚Äì An old friend of Paul Denton's who attends Sarah Lawrence College. They are friends with benefits. *Patrick Bateman ‚Äì Sean's older brother, an investment banker who is much more focused and successful than Sean. The brothers loathe each other for their very different outlooks on and approaches to life. He narrates a chapter of the novel and returns as the protagonist of Ellis's follow-up novel, American Psycho, in which it is revealed that he is a psychopathic serial killer. *Sean's admirer ‚Äì An unnamed student (although her name is probably Mary) who sends Sean anonymous love letters. Her entries in the book are all italicized letters to Sean. She hopes to reveal herself to Sean at the Dressed To Get Screwed Party midway through the book, but when she sees him leave with Lauren, she is heartbroken and commits suicide in a bathtub by slashing her wrists. *Bertrand ‚Äì Sean's French roommate, whom he despises. Sean continuously refers to him as \\"The Frog.\\" He pines for Lauren and narrates one section of the book entirely in French. He also appears in Glamorama with an intense hatred for Victor from the anguish he had caused Lauren. *Stuart ‚Äì A student who moves into the room across from Paul Denton. He previously had a crush on Paul when they shared a drama class, from which Stuart subsequently withdrew after he botched a scene with Paul. He later hopes to run into Paul after he moves across the hall, and hopes (unsuccessfully) to see him at the Dressed to Get Screwed Party. He also has a friend named Dennis. *Mitchell Allen ‚Äì A previous fling of Paul's who has reverted into the closet. He later reappears in Ellis' Lunar Park. *Roxanne - A friend of Lauren's who, like Sean, gets drugs from Rupert. Roxanne dates Rupert during the novel and Sean states that he was also seeing her at one point. *Judy - A friend of Lauren's who sleeps with Sean after a party, which ruins Sean and Lauren's relationship. Setting of the novel The story is set at Camden College, a fictional liberal arts college in northeastern New Hampshire. In many ways, Camden mirrors Ellis' alma mater, Bennington College, and Hampden College, the setting of Donna Tartt's novel The Secret History. Both books contain cross- references to each other's story lines and characters, as well as mention of actual campus buildings. Tartt mentions the suicide of a freshman girl in passing, while Ellis repeatedly mentions a group of classics majors who \\"dress like undertakers\\" and are suspected of staging pagan rituals and slaying farmers in the countryside (a reference to The Secret History). There is also mention of a \\"nice girl from Rockaway\\" in one of Lauren's narrations. This is possibly Alex from Jill Eisenstadt's novel From Rockaway, who attended Camden College in the novel. Film The Rules of Attraction was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002. It was directed by Roger Avary and starred James Van Der Beek as Sean, Shannyn Sossamon as Lauren, Ian Somerhalder as Paul, and Kip Pardue as Victor.

Before karyogamy, each haploid cell has one complete copy of the organism's genome. In order for karyogamy to occur, the cell membrane and cytoplasm of each cell must fuse with the other in a process known as plasmogamy. Once within the joined cell membrane, the nuclei are referred to as pronuclei. Once the cell membranes, cytoplasm, and pronuclei fuse together, the resulting single cell is diploid, containing two copies of the genome. This diploid cell, called a zygote or zygospore can then enter meiosis (a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and division, to produce four new haploid cells), or continue to divide by mitosis. Mammalian fertilization uses a comparable process to combine haploid sperm and egg cells (gametes) to create a diploid fertilized egg. The term karyogamy comes from the Greek karyo- (from Œ∫Œ¨œÅœÖŒøŒΩ karyon) meaning \\"nut\\" and Œ≥Œ¨ŒºŒøœÇ gamos, meaning \\"marriage\\".  Importance in haploid organisms  Step labeled number 4 indicates karyogamy's place in the context of the life cycle of the fungus Taphrina. Haploid organisms such as fungi, yeast, and algae can have complex cell cycles, in which the choice between sexual or asexual reproduction is fluid, and often influenced by the environment. Some organisms, in addition to their usual haploid state, can also exist as diploid for a short time, allowing genetic recombination to occur. Karyogamy can occur within either mode of reproduction: during the sexual cycle or in somatic (non-reproductive) cells. Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together two sets of different genetic material which can recombine during meiosis. In haploid organisms that lack sexual cycles, karyogamy can also be an important source of genetic variation during the process of forming somatic diploid cells. Formation of somatic diploids circumvents the process of gamete formation during the sexual reproduction cycle and instead creates variation within the somatic cells of an already developed organism, such as a fungus. Role in sexual reproduction (a) In fission yeast, the mating process is triggered by nitrogen starvation when compatible partners are present. (b) Budding yeast cells of opposite mating type can instead mate spontaneously on rich medium to form stable diploids that undergo sporulation upon starvation. In both organisms after pheromone exchange, cells grow in a polarized manner in the direction of their partner and undergo fusion, karyogamy and sporulation. The role of karyogamy in sexual reproduction can be demonstrated most simply by single-celled haploid organisms such as the algae of genus Chlamydomonas or the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Such organisms exist normally in a haploid state, containing only one set of chromosomes per cell. However, the mechanism remains largely the same among all haploid eukaryotes. When subjected to environmental stress, such as nitrogen starvation in the case of Chlamydomonas, cells are induced to form gametes. Gamete formation in single- celled haploid organisms such as yeast is called sporulation, resulting in many cellular changes that increase resistance to stress. Gamete formation in multicellular fungi occurs in the gametangia, an organ specialized for such a process, usually by meiosis. When opposite mating types meet, they are induced to leave the vegetative cycle and enter the mating cycle. In yeast, there are two mating types, a and Œ±. In fungi, there can be two, four, or even up to 10,000 mating types, depending on the species. Mate recognition in the simplest eukaryotes is achieved through pheromone signaling, which induces shmoo formation (a projection of the cell) and begins the process of microtubule organization and migration. Pheromones used in mating type recognition are often peptides, but sometimes trisporic acid or other molecules, recognized by cellular receptors on the opposite cell. Notably, pheromone signaling is absent in higher fungi such as mushrooms. The cell membranes and cytoplasm of these haploid cells then fuse together in a process known as plasmogamy. This results in a single cell with two nuclei, known as pronuclei. The pronuclei then fuse together in a well regulated process known as karyogamy. This creates a diploid cell known as a zygote, or a zygospore, which can then enter meiosis, a process of chromosome duplication, recombination, and cell division, to create four new haploid gamete cells. One possible advantage of sexual reproduction is that it results in more genetic variability, providing the opportunity for adaptation through natural selection. Another advantage is efficient recombinational repair of DNA damages during meiosis. Thus, karyogamy is the key step in bringing together a variety of genetic material in order to ensure recombination in meiosis. The Amoebozoa is a large group of mostly single-celled species that have recently been determined to have the machinery for karyogamy and meiosis. Since the Amoeboza branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree, this finding suggests that karyogamy and meiosis were present early in eukaryotic evolution. Cellular mechanisms =Pronuclear migration= left The ultimate goal of karyogamy is fusion of the two haploid nuclei. The first step in this process is the movement of the two pronuclei toward each other, which occurs directly after plasmogamy. Each pronucleus has a spindle pole body that is embedded in the nuclear envelope and serves as an attachment point for microtubules. Microtubules, an important fiber-like component of the cytoskeleton, emerge at the spindle pole body. The attachment point to the spindle pole body marks the minus end, and the plus end extends into the cytoplasm. The plus end has normal roles in mitotic division, but during nuclear congression, the plus ends are redirected. The microtubule plus ends attach to the opposite pronucleus, resulting in the pulling of the two pronuclei toward each other. Microtubule movement is mediated by a family of motor proteins known as kinesins, such as Kar3 in yeast. Accessory proteins, such as Spc72 in yeast, act as a glue, connecting the motor protein, spindle pole body and microtubule in a structure known as the half-bridge. Other proteins, such as Kar9 and Bim1 in yeast, attach to the plus end of the microtubules. They are activated by pheromone signals to attach to the shmoo tip. A shmoo is a projection of the cellular membrane which is the site of initial cell fusion in plasmogamy. After plasmogamy, the microtubule plus ends continue to grow towards the opposite pronucleus. It is thought that the growing plus end of the microtubule attaches directly to the motor protein of the opposite pronucleus, triggering a reorganization of the proteins at the half-bridge. The force necessary for migration occurs directly in response to this interaction. Two models of nuclear congression have been proposed: the sliding cross-bridge, and the plus end model. In the sliding cross-bridge model, the microtubules run antiparallel to each other for the entire distance between the two pronuclei, forming cross-links to each other, and each attaching to the opposite nucleus at the plus end. This is the favored model. The alternative model proposes that the plus ends contact each other midway between the two pronuclei and only overlap slightly. In either model, it is believed that microtubule shortening occurs at the plus end and requires Kar3p (in yeast), a member of a family of kinesin-like proteins. Microtubule organization in the cytoskeleton has been shown to be essential for proper nuclear congression during karyogamy. Defective microtubule organization causes total failure of karyogamy, but does not totally interrupt meiosis and spore production in yeast. The failure occurs because the process of nuclear congression cannot occur without functional microtubules. Thus, the pronuclei do not approach close enough to each other to fuse together, and their genetic material remains separated. =Pronuclear fusion (karyogamy)= Merging of the nuclear envelopes of the pi occurs in three steps: fusion of the outer membrane, fusion of the inner membrane, and fusion of the spindle pole bodies. In yeast, several members of the Kar family of proteins, as well as a protamine, are required for the fusion of nuclear membranes. The protamine Prm3 is located on the outer surface of each nuclear membrane, and is required for the fusion of the outer membrane. The exact mechanism is not known. Kar5, a kinesin-like protein, is necessary to expand the distance between the outer and inner membranes in a phenomenon known as bridge expansion. Kar8 and Kar2 are thought to be necessary to the fusing of the inner membranes. As described above, the reorganization of accessory and motor proteins during pronuclear migration also serves to orient the spindle pole bodies in the correct direction for efficient nuclear congression. Nuclear congression can still take place without this pre-orientation of spindle pole bodies, but it is slower. Ultimately the two pronuclei combine the contents of their nucleoplasms and form a single envelope around the result. Role in somatic diploids Although fungi are normally haploid, diploid cells can arise by two mechanisms. The first is a failure of the mitotic spindle during regular cell division, and does not involve karyogamy. The resulting cell can only be genetically homozygous since it is produced from one haploid cell. The second mechanism, involving karyogamy of somatic cells, can produce heterozygous diploids if the two nuclei differ in genetic information. The formation of somatic diploids is generally rare, and is thought to occur because of a mutation in the karyogamy repressor gene (KR). There are, however, a few fungi that exist mostly in the diploid state. One example is Candida albicans, a fungus that lives in the gastrointestinal tracts of many warm blooded animals, including humans. Although usually innocuous, C. albicans can turn pathogenic and is a particular problem in immunosuppressed patients. Unlike with most other fungi, diploid cells of different mating types fuse to create tetraploid cells which subsequently return to the diploid state by losing chromosomes.  Similarities to and differences from mammalian fertilization  Mammals, including humans, also combine genetic material from two sources - father and mother - in fertilization. This process is similar to karyogamy. As with karyogamy, microtubules play an important part in fertilization and are necessary for the joining of the sperm and egg (oocyte) DNA. Drugs such as griseofulvin that interfere with microtubules prevent the fusion of the sperm and egg pronuclei. The gene KAR2 which plays a large role in karyogamy has a mammalian analog called Bib/GRP78. In both cases, genetic material is combined to create a diploid cell that has greater genetic diversity than either original source. Instead of fusing in the same way as lower eukaryotes do in karyogamy, the sperm nucleus vesiculates and its DNA decondenses. The sperm centriole acts as a microtubule organizing center and forms an aster which extends throughout the egg until contacting the egg's nucleus. The two pronuclei migrate toward each other and then fuse to form a diploid cell.

Her tenure was marked by her outspoken views and active role in her husband's administration, in contrast to previous First Ladies of Mexico, as well as several controversies regarding her nonprofit Vamos M√©xico foundation and her family's business dealings.  Early life and teaching  Sahag√∫n was born in Zamora, Michoac√°n, the second of six children, to Dr. Alberto Sahag√∫n de la Parra, who founded Zamora‚Äôs San Jos√© Hospital and a nursing school, and Ana Teresa Jim√©nez Vargas. For some years she worked as an English teacher at the Universidad Lasallista Benavente. Her first marriage was to veterinarian Manuel Bribiesca Godoy, with whom she ran a veterinary wholesale supplies business in Celaya, Guanajuato. They had three children: Manuel, Jorge Alberto and Fernando. They separated in 1998 and divorced in 2000. Political career Sahag√∫n has been an active member of the National Action Party since 1988. She unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Celaya and met Vicente Fox, who named her as his spokeswoman for his government in Guanajuato. Sahag√∫n continued to serve as his press secretary during his successful presidential campaign and for his first year in office. Sahag√∫n married Fox in 2001. In September 2001, Sahag√∫n created the Vamos M√©xico (Let‚Äôs Go Mexico) foundation, which allocates funds to help marginalized people of the country and other organizations such as the Legion of Christ. Vamos M√©xico was inaugurated with a concert by Elton John in Chapultepec Castle, which drew criticism for using a national monument for a private function. The foundation came under national and international scrutiny after an investigation by The Financial Times found that less than half of the foundation's donations went toward charitable efforts. The Financial Times criticized the foundation's lack of transparency in the management of its resources, the source of its donations and its high overhead costs, despite its access to presidential staff, resources and donated office space. The Mexican federal auditor also opened an investigation into whether the national lottery and the president's office had improperly channeled public funds into the foundation. The lottery's then-director, Laura Vald√©s, is the sister of a board member of Vamos M√©xico. In response, Vamos M√©xico bought full-page ads in Mexican newspapers with a pie chart breakdown of its expenses, which added up to 103.26 percent. Despite her popularity with the public, Sahag√∫n was criticized by legislators and media for using her position as First Lady to set up a future run for the presidency. She was also criticized for her spending habits, including her publicly funded staff of 38, with the top 11 employees costing a total of $782,000 a year. Despite admitting her interest in the presidency, Sahag√∫n confirmed in 2004 that she would not become a candidate for president and would retire to her and her husband's ranch, although she added, \\"Mexico is ready to be governed by a woman.\\"  Controversies  = Conflict with Proceso and Olga Wornat = In 2003, Argentine journalist Olga Wornat published La Jefa: Vida p√∫blica y privada de Marta Sahag√∫n de Fox (\\"The Chief: The Public and Private Life of Marta Sahagun de Fox\\"), a book about Marta Sahag√∫n and her sons. Federal deputy Ricardo Sheffield Padilla asked the federal government to investigate the claims of corruption raised by Wornat. In 2005, Wornat published a second book about Sahag√∫n and her sons, Cr√≥nicas Malditas (\\"Accursed Chronicles\\"), which investigated the sources of their immense fortune. The Mexican magazine Proceso also published an article the same year about the dissolution of Sahag√∫n's first marriage (including claims of domestic violence against her then-husband) and about the \\"suspicious\\" businesses of Sahag√∫n's sons. On May 3, 2005, Marta Sahag√∫n filed a civil lawsuit before the Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Distrito Federal (Supreme Tribunal of Justice of the Federal District) against Wornat and Proceso for \\"moral damages\\" and breach of privacy. Sahag√∫n‚Äôs son Manuel Bibriesca Sahag√∫n filed a separate lawsuit against Wornat, who had received death threats since her books were published and had been placed under house arrest by a federal judge. On November 27, 2005, Proceso published an article titled \\"Amistades Peligrosas\\" (\\"Dangerous Friendships\\"), wherein Raquenel Villanueva, a prominent lawyer for drug kingpins, said she had met Fernando Bribiesca Sahag√∫n with her client Jaime Valdez Mart√≠nez in 2003. The Procuradur√≠a General de la Rep√∫blica considers Valdez a representative of drug cartel leader Joaqu√≠n \\"El Chapo\\" Guzm√°n. = The Bribiesca sons = Sahag√∫n and her sons have been repeatedly accused of using her influence to promote their business interests. Partly as a result of the revelations of journalist Olga Wornat, the Mexican Chamber of Deputies launched investigations into the activities of Sahagun‚Äôs sons. In mid-2006, a commission of the Chamber of Deputies, chaired by Deputy Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Schmal, allegedly found evidence that would prove multiple shady dealings in the affairs of Sahagun‚Äôs children and decided to raise a complaint with the Attorney General's Office. Upon hearing the report, Sahag√∫n held a press conference at the official residence of Los Pinos to harshly criticize the commission and Gonz√°lez Schmal, claiming that it was lies and a publicity stunt against her. Mexican journalist Anabel Hern√°ndez, in her books Fin de fiesta en Los Pinos (2006) and Narcoland (2012) contributed to increasing criticism of Sahag√∫n and her sons by investigating the Bribiescas‚Äô alleged influence peddling and their links to drug cartels. Manuel and Jorge Bribiesca Sahag√∫n reportedly played a key role in facilitating multimillion-dollar contracts with state-owned Pemex on behalf of Oceanografia, an oil services company that was later accused of defrauding Citigroup and Banamex of at least $400 million. In 2012, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation issued an arrest warrant for Manuel Bribiesca on charges of fraud in relation to the Oceanografia case.

In May 1911 he became premier when Francis Longworth Haszard was appointed to the Supreme Court of the province. At the time, members of the legislature were required to resign their seats and run for re- election in a by-election. Palmer did so but was defeated in the December by- election. He resigned as premier and returned to his law practice. The loss of Palmer's seat also caused the Liberal government to lose their majority in the legislature and the lieutenant governor asked the leader of the opposition, John A.

Sedgwick was an English merchant involved in trade with India who served as President of Madras and six times as a Member of Parliament. He was the grandfather of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham (\\"Pitt the Elder\\") and was great-grandfather of Pitt the Younger, both prime ministers of Great Britain. Origins Pitt was born at Blandford Forum, Dorset, the second son of Rev. John Pitt (1610-1672), Rector of Blandford St Mary (whose mural monument survives in that churchsee image , see transcript in Collins), by his wife Sarah Jay.Arthur Collins, Collins's Peerage of England, Volume 7, London, 1812, pp.485-6 His second cousin was the poet Rev. Christopher Pitt (1699-1748) whose mural monument survives in the church of St Peter and St Paul, Blandford Forum, displaying the arms of Pitt: Sable, a fesse chequy argent and azure between three bezants. The earliest prominent ancestor of his family was John Pitt (d.1602) a mercer from Blandford Forum and Clerk of the Exchequer who received a grant of arms,Collins from whose younger son, Thomas Pitt of Blandford (father of Rev. John Pitt), the Pitts of Boconnoc were descended. The eldest son of John Pitt (d.1602) was Sir William Pitt (c.1559-1636),https://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/pitt- william-1559-1636 MP for Wareham, who founded the senior line of Pitt of Stratfield Saye in Hampshire, many of whose descendants served as an MP for Wareham and in 1776 acquired the title Baron Rivers. In the Mughal Empire In 1674, Pitt went to India with the East India Company, and soon began trading for himself as an \\"interloper\\" in defiance of the East India Company's legal monopoly on Indian trade. Upon his return to England, he was fined ¬£400 for his actions, although by that time he was already very wealthy and could easily afford the fine. He then proceeded to buy the manor of Stratford, Wiltshire and its surrounding borough of Old Sarum. With that acquisition he gained a seat in the House of Commons, as it was a rotten borough, although his first seat was as the member for Salisbury in the Convention Parliament of 1689. The purchase of Old Sarum would have a significant effect on English history, as the seat would pass to Pitt's rather influential descendants. Pitt returned to India and eventually was hired by the East India Company. In August 1698, Pitt arrived at Madras as the President of the East India Company and was entrusted to negotiate an end to the Child's War with the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In August 1699, he had been appointed as the Governor of Fort St. George. In 1702, when the fort was besieged by Daud Khan of the Carnatic, the Mughal Empire's local subedar (lieutenant), Pitt was instructed to seek peace. He later bought out some of the Carnatic region. He began garrisoning East India Company forts by raising regiments of local sepoys by hiring from Hindu warrior castes, arming them with the latest weapons and deploying them under the command of English officers to save Madras, his base of operations, from further Mughal harassment.  President of Madras  Pitt became the President of Madras on 7 July 1698 and remained in his post till 1709. In 1698, a new company called English Company Trading to the East Indies was floated by English merchants with Whiggish affiliations with a capital of ¬£2 million. In August 1699, one John Pitt arrived at Madras and claimed that he had been appointed as the Governor of Fort St George by the new Company on behalf of the Stuarts. However, the Government in England passed an order that the authorities were to receive orders from no-one save those appointed by King William III. On 4 December 1700, the Government of Fort St George banned cock-fighting and other traditional games, regarding it as the foremost reason for the poverty of the inhabitants of Madras. Pitt's term of office is known as the 'Golden Age of Madras'. He fortified the walls of Black Town and organised an accurate survey of the city. Pitt is best known for the acquisition of the Five New Towns: Tiruvatiyoor, Kathiwakam, Nungambakkam, Vyasarpady and Sathangadu.  Later career  In need of money after making gifts to his family, he gave up his seat in parliament in 1716 in favour of the position of Governor of Jamaica. However, his finances were restored by the sale of a large diamond (later known as the Regent diamond) and he resigned the position the following year without ever going there. He was soon re-elected to parliament to represent Thirsk, and thereafter Old Sarum for the last time, finally quitting parliament in 1726. Marriage and children On 1 January 1679/80 Pitt married Jane Innes, a daughter of James Innes of Reid Hall, Moray, by his wife Sarah Vincent.Edward J. Davies, \\"Jane Innes, Wife of Governor Thomas Pitt\\", Notes and Queries, 253(2008):301-03. Jane was a niece of Matthias Vincent, one of Pitt's business associates.

Pitt's diamond The Regent diamond, now on display in the Louvre Pitt is best known for his purchase of a 410 carat (82 g) uncut diamond acquired from an Indian merchant named Jamchand in Madras in 1701. The merchant had purchased the diamond from an English sea captain, who had, in fact, stolen the diamond from a servant of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. According to another version, the servant found the diamond in one of the Golkonda mines on the Krishna River and had concealed it inside a large wound in his leg, which he had suffered as he fled the Siege of Golconda. Pitt bought the diamond for 48,000 pagodas or ¬£20,400, and sent it back to England in 1702 concealed inside his eldest son Robert's shoe. For two years from 1704‚Äì1706, the jeweller Harris laboured in London to hew a 141 carat (28.2 g) cushion brilliant from the rough stone. Several secondary stones were produced from the cut that were sold to Peter the Great of Russia. After many attempts to sell it to various European royals, including Louis XIV of France, Pitt and his sons went with the diamond to Calais in 1717. With John Law acting as agent, it was sold that year to the French regent, Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, for ¬£135,000, becoming one of the crown jewels of France. Today, \\"Le R√©gent\\", as it came to be known, remains in the French Royal Treasury at the Louvre, where it has been on display since 1887. Pitt owned a piece of land called a copyhold, and the lord of this land was entitled to Pitt's most valuable possession after his death. If he had not sold the diamond, it would have been confiscated as a heriot, a form of death duty. His association with the jewel earned him the nickname \\"Diamond\\" Pitt. Properties Swallowfield With the money received for his famous diamond, he now began to consolidate his properties. Besides Mawarden Court at Stratford Sub Castle and the Down at Blandford, he acquired Boconnoc in Cornwall from Lord Mohun's widow in 1717, and subsequently Kynaston in Dorset, Bradock, Treskillard and Brannell in Cornwall, Woodyates on the border of Dorset and Wiltshire, Abbot's Ann in Hampshire (where he rebuilt the church) and, subsequently his favourite residence, Swallowfield Park in Berkshire, where he died in 1726.

It may be made of rubber or rubber-like material such as vinyl plastic. Rubber ducks naturally inspire water play that develops muscle strength and coordination. With their bright color, smooth texture, and (for some) squeaky or quacky sounds, rubber ducks sharpen toddlers‚Äô senses. Their presence in the bathtub soothes youngsters‚Äô fears of water and water immersion and makes good clean fun of the routine hygiene they are learning. The yellow rubber duck has achieved an iconic status in Western pop culture and is often symbolically linked to bathing. History A variety of rubber ducks The history of the rubber duck is linked to the emergence of rubber manufacturing in the late 19th century. The earliest rubber ducks were made from harder rubber when manufacturers began using Charles Goodyear's invention, vulcanized rubber. Consequently, these solid rubber ducks were not capable of floating and were instead intended as chew toys. Sculptor Peter Ganine created a sculpture of a duck in the 1940s. He then patented it and reproduced it as a floating toy, of which over 50 million were sold. Besides the ubiquitous yellow rubber duck with which most people are familiar, there have been numerous novelty variations on the basic theme, including character ducks representing professions, politicians, or celebrities. There are also ducks that glow in the dark, quack, change color, have interior LED illumination, or include a wind-up engine that enables them to \\"swim\\". In 2001, The Sun, a British tabloid reported that Queen Elizabeth II has a rubber duck in her bathroom that wears an inflatable crown. The duck was spotted by a workman who was repainting her bathroom. The story prompted sales of rubber ducks in the United Kingdom to increase by 80% for a short period. Rubber ducks are collected by enthusiasts. The 2011 Guinness World Record for World's Largest Rubber Duck Collection stood at 5,631 different rubber ducks, and was awarded to Charlotte Lee. In 2013, the rubber duck was inducted into the Toy Hall of Fame, a museum in Rochester, New York, along with the game of chess. Toys are selected based on factors like icon-status, longevity, and innovation.  In popular culture  Ernie, a popular Muppet from the television series Sesame Street, has performed the song \\"Rubber Duckie\\" multiple times since the series began. Ernie frequently spoke to his duck and carried it with him in other segments of the show. On a special occasion, Little Richard performed the song. C.W. McCall's hit song \\"Convoy\\" (and the movie and novel it inspired) are narrated from the viewpoint of a character who replaced the bulldog hood ornament on his Mack truck with a bathtub toy and used the on-air handle of \\"Rubber Duck\\". =World's largest rubber duck= Florentijn Hofman's Rubber Duck sculpture in Sydney, 2013 The world's largest rubber duck was created by Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman in 2007, measuring and weighing about . Since 2007, several ducks of various sizes created by Hofman have been on display in countries and territories such as Amsterdam, Netherlands; Lommel, Belgium; Osaka, Japan; Sydney, Australia; S√£o Paulo, Brazil; Hong Kong, China; Kaohsiung, Taiwan; and Seoul, Korea; until 14 November 2014, and went on display in the United States after 20 October 2013. In 2013, China's \\"Great Firewall\\" blocks searches for \\"big yellow duck\\" because Chinese activists were photo-shopping the Rubber Duck sculpture into the Tank Man photo of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. If the term \\"Big Yellow Duck\\" were searched, a message appeared stating that according to relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. Races Freiburg, Germany Rubber duck races, also known as derby duck races, have been used as a method of fundraising for organizations worldwide. People donate money to the organization by sponsoring a duck. At the end of the fundraising drive, all of the ducks are dumped into a waterway, with the first to float past the finish line winning a prize for its sponsor. =North America= There are hundreds of races held in the United States and internationally. The largest race in the United States is the annual Freestore Foodbank Rubber Duck Regatta in Cincinnati, Ohio. First run in 1995, the Rubber Duck Regatta now features over 150,000 ducks raced to raise money for the organization. Since its beginning in 1995 the Rubber Duck Regatta in Cincinnati Ohio has raised over $9 million, and over $1 million has been raised for each year's race since 2014. The annual Aspen Ducky Derby was first run by the Rotary Club of Aspen, Colorado, in 1991. The derby now features 30,000 ducks and takes place each August in Aspen's Rio Grande Park. Through its past 20 years, the Aspen Ducky Derby has raised more than $2.3 million to benefit 65 nonprofit groups.http://www.aspendailynews.com/section/entertainment/148516 In Fort Wayne, Indiana, for over 30 years the Weigand Construction Duck Race takes place in the summer at Johnny Appleseed Park to support the organization SCAN, whose mission is to eliminate the abuse and neglect of children in northeast Indiana through family services, education and community partnerships. One of the more famous rubber duck races is the Great Knoxville Rubber Duck Race.http://www.knoxvilleduckrace.com This race received attention when the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled that it was a lottery, which stopped the race for a few years. After the state amended its constitution to allow lotteries with special exceptions, the race was reinstituted. The Derby Duck race sees over 40,000 ducks race to benefit the Boys and Girls Club of Tennessee Valley. A famous rubber duck race is the Halifax Duck Derby. This race has 10,000 rubber ducks in the Halifax Harbour along Bishops Landing. There is a grand prize of $1 million Canadian dollars; other prizes include a trip to anywhere in Canada, large-screen TVs, and more. This race has been very successful in raising money and awareness for its organizations. The Lumsden Duck Derby is a Labour Day tradition in the town of Lumsden, Saskatchewan, northwest of Regina. Founded in 1988 to help the town raise funds for a new ice rink, nowadays the Derby races 25,000 rubber ducks down a stretch of the Qu'Appelle River and features a grand prize of CAD$1 million. The town makes a day out of it, with a pancake breakfast, bands and other entertainments, kids' activities, and a \\"parade to the post.\\" The Estes Park Rotary Duck Race raises money for sixty-eight different charities. Contestants must choose which charity to donate their money to when they buy their ticket. =Australia= The Great Brisbane Duck Race is held on the Brisbane River each year to raise funds for the PA Research Foundation. The race saw 30,000 rubber ducks enter the race in 2011. The PA Research Foundation also holds a Team Duck Race Challenge where groups are invited to raise funds and participate in either the motorised or non-motorised Team Duck Race with a large tall rubber duck that teams can decorate, brand, and modify. One other race was conducted in Australia in January 1988. It was run from the \\"High-level bridge\\" to the \\"Low-level bridge\\" near Katherine, Northern Territory on the Australia Day long weekend. Acting on behalf of the town's Bicentennial Committee, Royal Australian Air Force officers Andrew Cairns and Jock MacGowan constructed the release cage from PVC pipe, purchased and numbered the ducks, printed tickets, and even arranged a helicopter flypast. =Europe= United Kingdom Hebden Bridge Duck Race, West Yorkshire In Stockbridge, Edinburgh since 1988, the Stockbridge Community Festival has held the annual Stockbridge Duck Race to raise money for local charities. 1000 rubber ducks are released into the Water of Leith at the Stockbridge to float downstream to the finishing post at the Falshaw Bridge. The 2010 race was memorable for a sudden rain shower at the finish line. The 2011 race was held on 3 July with proceeds going to local charities Stockbridge House & St. Columba's Hospice. For over 25 years, Bibury in Gloucestershire has hosted an annual Duck Race on Boxing Day.

Scientific studies =Oceanography= During a Pacific storm on 10 January 1992, three 40-foot containers holding 29,000 Friendly Floatees plastic bathtub toys from a Chinese factory were washed off a ship, containing blue turtles, yellow ducks, red beavers, and green frogs. Two-thirds of the toys floated south and landed three months later on the shores of Indonesia, Australia, and South America. The remaining 10,000 toys headed north to Alaska and then completed a full circle back near Japan, caught up in the North Pacific Gyre current as the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Many of the toys then entered the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia and were trapped in the Arctic ice. They moved through the ice at a rate of one mile per day, and in 2000 they were sighted in the North Atlantic. The movement of the toys had been monitored by American oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer. Bleached by sun and seawater, the ducks and beavers had faded to white, but the turtles and frogs had kept their original colours. Between July and December 2003, The First Years Inc. offered a $100 US savings bond reward to anybody who recovered a Floatee in New England, Canada or Iceland. More of the toys were recovered in 2004 than in any of the preceding three years. However, still more of these toys were predicted to have headed eastward past Greenland and make landfall on the southwestern shores of the United Kingdom in 2007. These toys were the subject of Donovan Hohn's 2011 book Moby-Duck: The True Story of 28,800 Bath Toys Lost at Sea. =Glacial melting= In August 2008, NASA'S Jet Propulsion Laboratory undertook studies of Greenland's Jakobshavn Glacier to determine how interior glacial meltflow during the summer influenced its movement. A sophisticated football-sized probe that had a GPS device, pressure sensor, thermometer and accelerometer was lowered by rope into one of the glacier's moulins. The probe's equipment was designed to find structures such as waterfalls inside the ice. Unfortunately the probe went silent, so ninety rubber ducks marked in English, Danish, and Inuit with the text \\"science experiment\\" and \\"reward\\", along with an email address to contact if found, were also put into the moulins and it was hoped that the ducks would eventually exit and be found by hunters or fishermen around Baffin Bay. As of 2012, none of the ducks were found or returned, possibly due to being trapped in large aquifers later discovered inside the ice.

Refused is composed of vocalist Dennis Lyxz√©n, guitarist Kristofer Steen, drummer David Sandstr√∂m, and bassist Magnus Flagge. Guitarist Jon Br√§nnstr√∂m was a member from 1994, through reunions, until he was fired in late-2014. Their lyrics are often of a non- conformist and politically far-left nature. On January 9, 2012, the band announced their reunion confirming shows at Coachella, Rock am Ring, Ruisrock, Roskilde Festival, Groezrock, Way Out West Festival, Sonisphere Festival (Cancelled), Download Festival, Rock for People, Primavera Sound, Hellfest, Fuji Rock Festival, √òyafestivalen, Pukkelpop, Resurrection. After embarking on a world tour for nearly a year, Refused went on hiatus again in 2012, but announced another reunion in November 2014. The band released five EPs and three full-length albums before originally splitting up in 1998, and released their fourth full-length album Freedom on the Epitaph Records label on June 26, 2015. \\"Elektra\\" was released as the first single from the comeback album on April 27, 2015. History =Early years (1991‚Äì1997)= Refused in 1994 at the Hultsfred Festival Refused formed in early 1991 with Dennis Lyxz√©n (former frontman of the straight edge band Step Forward) on vocals, David Sandstr√∂m on drums, P√§r Hansson on guitar, and Jonas Lindgren on bass. They formed with the aim of playing outside of their hometown and releasing a 7\\" record (the latter which never happened). They released their first demo, Refused, the same year. With an already altered lineup (including Kristofer Steen joining from local band Abhinanda with P√§r Hansson going the other way) the band released their first studio album, This Just Might Be the Truth, in 1994. A month later, they released the Everlasting EP. Refused's final line-up consisted of Dennis Lyxz√©n, David Sandstr√∂m, Kristofer Steen, and Jon Br√§nnstr√∂m, but the band never found a permanent bass player, switching up to 12 bassists until their original break-up. In June 1996, they released Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent through Victory Records. The album had a style that steered towards the metallic hardcore genre and included a fanzine explaining their political ideas. For this record, they toured with Snapcase. Later on, they did it in support of Millencolin in the United States and with Mindjive in Europe. =The Shape of Punk to Come and disbandment (1998)= Their third album, 1998's The Shape of Punk to Come, incorporated diverse sounds outside of the strict hardcore realm, such as electronica, jazz, and ambient. Initially, the album was both a commercial and critical failure, with little media coverage and mixed reception from fans and critics alike; some even refused to rate it because of its stylistic divergence. The United States tour to support the album was canceled halfway. They were joined by Washington, D.C.'s Frodus and only completed eight shows in half-empty basements and coffeehouses, finishing in a chaotic performance in a basement of Harrisonburg, Virginia that, after four songs, was shut down by police. They described these concerts as \\"emotionally devastating\\" and \\"an awful experience\\", which finally led to their break-up after a rough internal fight in Atlanta, Georgia. Other factors to their disbandment were a depletion of creative energy and band members wanting different things. There was also conflict between Dennis and the rest of the band. Refused announced their demise through a strongly-worded open letter titled \\"Refused Are Fucking Dead\\" on their label Burning Heart's website. =After breakup (1999‚Äì2009)= The story of Refused's last show soon became popular, as well as The Shape of Punk to Come. A year after its release, the album shot up from 1,400 to 21,000 units sold in the United States. In 2000, it went up to 28,000. From then on, many notable artists started to praise the band and newcomers cited them as an influence. Lead singer Dennis Lyxz√©n went on to form The (International) Noise Conspiracy soon thereafter, while the other members, as well as venturing into their own projects, formed the group TEXT. In 2007 Lyxz√©n and Sandstr√∂m briefly reformed their Refused side project, Final Exit, which existed in the mid-late 1990s and originally consisted of members of Refused and Abhinanda, with each member taking a different role to that which they had in their main bands (e.g., David on vocals and Dennis on bass guitar). As of May 2008, Dennis Lyxz√©n and David Sandstr√∂m formed a new straightforward hardcore band under the name AC4. Kristofer Steen moved to Orange County, California and attended film school there. He made a documentary on the band's last year in existence called Refused Are Fucking Dead, which was released in 2006. Then, he began working on operas in Sweden. =Rumours (2010‚Äì2011)= In March 2010, Epitaph Records put up the old Refused website online with the words \\"Coming Soon.\\" Rumours spread across the Internet about what the new website could indicate, including speculation of a reunion. Citing an anonymous source \\"close to the situation,\\" Punknews.org unofficially announced that the band would perform at European music festivals in 2010. Dennis Lyxz√©n denied claims of a Refused reformation as he and David Sandstr√∂m were busy with AC4. The new band website was later announced to be a promotional site for a reissue of Refused's final album, The Shape of Punk to Come. The reissue, released on June 8, 2010, is a three-disc set with an unreleased live album recorded in 1998 and the Refused Are Fucking Dead DVD documentary in addition to the full original album. In November 2011, multiple posters said to be for the upcoming 2012 Coachella Festival appeared on several Internet sites, and the line-ups included Refused. This started new rumours of a long-awaited reunion. =Reunion (2012)= Dennis Lyxz√©n with Refused in 2012 During BBC Radio 1's \\"Punk Show\\" on January 2, 2012, Mike Davies stated that Refused, along with At the Drive-In would be reforming in 2012. On January 9, 2012, it was announced that Refused would be performing for the 2012 Coachella Festival. The reunion was confirmed via Dennis Lyxz√©n's Facebook page. This was highly contested considering the band's original and explicit declaration to never reunite. Later that day, it was announced that they would also be playing at Way Out West Festival in Gothenburg, Sweden. They also headlined the Groezrock festival in Belgium. The confirmation that Refused would be UK exclusives at Sonisphere Festival in the UK was made on February 20. However, in light of Sonisphere UK's subsequent cancellation, Refused were officially booked by Download Festival on April 3, to perform at Donington Park instead. On February 29, Refused played a secret show in Ume√•, their first live performance since 1998. Refused are also confirmed for the Rock for People festival in Czech Republic. They appeared for the first time on TV in America on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on July 18, 2012. On August 23, 2012 Refused indicated by a Facebook post that their reunion was for 2012 only and not a continuation of their career. On August 24, 2012, it was announced that Refused would undertake a theatre tour of Australia for the first time ever that November. The after party for Refused's show on December 15, 2012 in Fabriken, Ume√• saw brief reunions from related Ume√• hardcore bands Abhinanda and Final Exit, as well as some rarely performed songs from Refused. Redd Kross also performed on the evening. =Hiatus, second reunion, and Freedom (2013-2017)= On February 22, 2013, Refused were awarded \\"The special prize for Swedish music exports\\" by the Minister of Trade. Lyxz√©n and Sandstr√∂m chose to criticize the current Government at the ceremony, instead thanking the efforts of popular education, in particular Workers' Educational Association (ABF) and youth centers (in Sweden associated with social democracy) while Jon Br√§nnstr√∂m chose to not accept the prize on his behalf later stating he wished they \\"[...] had said no to the prize and instead held a press conference about why we had turned it down\\". On October 31, 2014, Jon Br√§nnstr√∂m stated on the official Refused Facebook page that he had been fired from the band (the band would later state that he left the band in 2013), implying that Refused were still active and planned on performing again in the future. On November 25, 2014, the band announced that they would perform their first shows in three years at the Reading and Leeds Festivals, Groezrock and Amnesia Rockfest in the summer of 2015. They also headlined Punk Rock Bowling in Las Vegas in May 2015. Around the same time, rumours surfaced of a new album being recorded for release in 2015 after ...And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead's Autrey Fulbright II posted a photo on Instagram claiming that Lyxz√©n had been in the studio recording vocals for the album. On April 27, 2015, it was announced that Refused would release their fourth studio album, Freedom, in June 2015 via Epitaph Records. The album was produced by Nick Launay and includes further collaborations such as two songs produced with Max Martin-collaborator Shellback (Taylor Swift). The news was announced along with the release of the album's opening track, \\"Elektra,\\" as its lead single. On November 20, 2017, members of Refused revealed on social media that the band has been in the studio working on their next album. =Servants of Death, Cyberpunk 2077 and War Music (2018-present)= In May 2018, the band released the 'Servants of Death' EP which contained a new song, a b-side and four live songs. It was originally released on vinyl in 2016 as part of Record Store Day. On July 2, 2019, it was announced that Refused will be partnering with video game developer CD Projekt Red, creating and recording original music for upcoming video game Cyberpunk 2077. The members of Refused will provide music for a fictitious band in the in-game universe, punk rock group SAMURAI, whose lead vocalist Johnny Silverhand will be interpreted by actor Keanu Reeves, featuring Lyxz√©n's vocals on the music tracks. The announcement was made alongside the release of Chippin' In on streaming services, the first single to be revealed for the project. On August 23, 2019, a new song called Never Fade Away came out. On August 2, 2019, the band released \\"Blood Red\\" from their forthcoming album War Music. Musical style, lyrics and influences Refused started as a \\"fresh-faced positive hardcore band\\" and their music became increasingly progressive and radical, as did their lyrics. The record This Just Might Be the Truth was characterized for its \\"massive hardcore sound\\", mostly influenced by various bands from the New York hardcore scene (such as Earth Crisis). On their follow-up, Songs to Fan the Flames of Discontent, the band had a heavier, more intricate style, which is generally attributed to their Slayer inspiration, and Lyxz√©n adopted screaming vocals rather than shouting. With the third album, The Shape of Punk to Come, \\"came the leap into the unknown\\" as the band mixed their previous style with unorthodox chord progressions, sampling, \\"ambient textures, jazz breakdowns\\", electronica and monologues, and other deviations from the hardcore punk music. Refused's lyrics focus on far-left politics, drawing on anarchism, socialism, among other ideologies. By the time of their first album, the band already had a strong anti-establishment profile. The group's members were all vegan straight edge until their last show in 1998 and a couple of their songs dealt with these topics. Today, some of them no longer follow these lifestyles. In their live performances, vocalist Lyxz√©n usually delivers political speeches between songs. Before the Ume√• hardcore phenomenon went into full bloom, the band was seen as part of the scene centered around youth-oriented venue Galaxen, along with the punk-rock scene as well as metal bands such as Meshuggah. Among the biggest influences of Refused were ManLiftingBanner, Born Against, Slayer, and Ian Svenonius's projects (The Make-Up, The Nation of Ulysses and Cupid Car Club). Other bands that have influenced them are Fugazi, Inside Out, and Snapcase. Legacy Refused affected profoundly the development of rock music at the turn of the twentieth century, despite the fact that very few people supported them when they were active. According to Vice, they \\"stood at the nexus of modern punk, incorporating all of its subgenres into one scattered but neat package\\", putting \\"the risk back into punk and hardcore by making it unexpected again.\\" David Anthony of The A.V. Club described The Shape Of Punk To Come as \\"an undisputed classic that served as a rallying cry for bands longing to incorporate sounds from outside the walls of aggressive music.\\" Author Gabriel Kuhn states that Refused \\"became the flagship of a remarkably strong vegan straight edge movement that engulfed Sweden throughout the 1990s\\" with \\"witty manifestos\\" and \\"performances\\" that \\"challenged many of the scene‚Äôs standards.\\" Among the artists who cite Refused as influence are Linkin Park, Duff McKagan of Velvet Revolver and Guns N' Roses, Sum 41, Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus of Blink-182, AFI, Papa Roach, Tim McIlrath of Rise Against, Underoath, Enter Shikari, The Used, Every Time I Die, Norma Jean, Showbread, La Dispute, Nick Hipa of As I Lay Dying, Derek E. Miller of Poison the Well and Sleigh Bells, Geoff Rickly of Thursday, United Nations and No Devotion, Marcos Curiel of P.O.D. and Daylight Division, Jeremy Bolm of Hesitation Wounds and Touch√© Amor√©, Zachary Garren of Dance Gavin Dance and Strawberry Girls, Chris Teti of The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, The New Transit Direction, The Bloody Beetroots, Justin Beck of Glassjaw and Sons of Abraham, Robin Staps of The Ocean, The Bled, Thomas Williams of Stray from the Path, Brandon Kellum of American Standards, and Jonathan Boulet. The song \\"H. Ledger\\" from letlive.'s album Fake History is a \\"homage\\" to Refused because the band felt that they \\"didn't receive proper recognition until they were no longer active.\\" British musician Frank Turner stated that The Shape of Punk to Come \\"shaped my musical path as a musician for a long time\\" and his group, Million Dead, took their name from a line in the Refused's song \\"The Apollo Programme was a Hoax\\". Pop rock band Paramore were inspired by the song \\"Liberation Frequency\\" and quoted a line of it on their 2007 song \\"Born for This\\". Other artists have been quoted expressing admiration for their work are Anthrax, Steve Aoki, and Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan.

Mathieson was born in Harrington and was a graduate of Prince of Wales College. He was a schoolmaster and lawyer before entering politics with his election to the province's legislature as a Conservative in 1900. He represented the district of 4th Kings in his first term in the legislature, then shifted to 5th Kings in 1904. Mathieson sat on the opposition benches becoming Leader of the Opposition and of the Conservative Party in 1903. In December 1911, the Liberal government resigned when Premier H. James Palmer was defeated in a by- election which also caused the governing Liberals to lose their majority in the legislature. The Lieutenant-Governor of Prince Edward Island asked Mathieson as leader of the opposition to form a government, which he did, going on to win a mandate in the 1912 general election. Mathieson's government pressed the federal government to fulfill the terms on which Prince Edward Island joined Canadian Confederation in 1873. He succeeded in persuading Ottawa to provide an improved annual subsidy to the province and, in 1915, Ottawa announced the creation of a year-round ferry service to connect the island to the mainland. The ferries began operating between PEI and New Brunswick in 1917. The province was also at risk of losing representation in the House of Commons of Canada due to population shifts. PEI had six MPs when it joined confederation in 1873, this was reduced to four and was to be cut further as a result of the 1911 census. Mathieson persuaded the federal government to agree to an amendment to the British North America Act guaranteeing the province a minimum of four MPs in perpetuity. In 1917, Premier Mathieson left politics to accept an appointment as Chief Justice and served in that position until he retired in 1943.

One common method of logically implementing the fair-share scheduling strategy is to recursively apply the round-robin scheduling strategy at each level of abstraction (processes, users, groups, etc.) The time quantum required by round-robin is arbitrary, as any equal division of time will produce the same results. This was first developed by Judy Kay and Piers Lauder through their research at Sydney University in the 1980s. For example, if four users (A,B,C,D) are concurrently executing one process each, the scheduler will logically divide the available CPU cycles such that each user gets 25% of the whole (100% / 4 = 25%). If user B starts a second process, each user will still receive 25% of the total cycles, but each of user B's processes will now be attributed 12.5% of the total CPU cycles each, totalling user B's fair share of 25%. On the other hand, if a new user starts a process on the system, the scheduler will reapportion the available CPU cycles such that each user gets 20% of the whole (100% / 5 = 20%). Another layer of abstraction allows us to partition users into groups, and apply the fair share algorithm to the groups as well. In this case, the available CPU cycles are divided first among the groups, then among the users within the groups, and then among the processes for that user. For example, if there are three groups (1,2,3) containing three, two, and four users respectively, the available CPU cycles will be distributed as follows: 100% / 3 groups = 33.3% per group Group 1: (33.3% / 3 users) = 11.1% per user Group 2: (33.3% / 2 users) = 16.7% per user Group 3: (33.3% / 4 users) = 8.3% per user References Processor scheduling algorithms ","title":"Fair-share scheduling"},{"id":"599750","text":"The hanging parrots are birds in the parrot genus Loriculus.

Despite its thematic grounding in natural science and technology, like at all UCSC colleges, Crown students major in subjects across all disciplines. Crown has a favorable reputation for academically-focused students, possibly due to both its reputation as a science college and its secluded location on the Santa Cruz campus. Because of its strong academic roots, Crown College is regarded as one of the quieter colleges on the campus. It is very close to Upper Campus, which is often frequented by hikers and mountain bikers. Residents of the college are informally known as \\"Crownies.\\"  History and campus  Crown was founded in 1967 when the Chancellor Dean E. McHenry invited biologist Kenneth V. Thimann to come to Santa Cruz and head what would become Crown College and to build the science faculty at UCSC. Located on the upper northern side of campus by Merrill College, Crown also borders the newly constructed Colleges Nine and Ten. Crown is made up of eight three-floor residence halls as well as having about half of the Crown-Merrill apartment buildings. The UCSC fire station is located at Crown.

The song had follow-ups \\"Do De Rubber Duck\\" and \\"D-U-C-K-I-E\\" and was the centerpiece of 1988's \\"Put Down the Duckie\\", performed by Hoots the Owl but also featuring Ernie. Other recordings and performances In 1971, one of The Irish Rovers sings the song in one sketch as part of one of the episodes of The Irish Rovers Show. Little Richard performed a rock-and-roll version of the song as a guest on a 1995 episode of Sesame Street. Bob McGrath recorded the song in his album, Bob's Favorite Street Songs. The song made a brief appearance in a scene in Three Men and a Little Lady, and during an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway? Daveed Diggs, in costume as Mr. Noodle's Brother Mr. Noodle, performed a hip- hop infused version on Sesame Street's YouTube channel. Little Richard has also performed a rockabilly-tinged version of the song, which can also be found on Sesame Street's official YouTube channel.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWCEG6lV0ek Stride pianist Dick Wellstood included a performance of the song on his 1974 live album Walkin' with Wellstood.

Its English and scientific names refer to its habit of guiding people to bee colonies. Claims that it also guides non-human animals are disputed. The greater honeyguide is a resident breeder in sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in a variety of habitats that have trees, especially dry open woodland, but not in the West African jungle. Description The greater honeyguide is about 20 cm long and weighs about 50 g. Like all African honeyguides, it has bold white patches on the sides of the tail. The male has dark grey-brown upperparts and white underparts, with a black throat. The wings are streaked whitish, and there is a yellow shoulder patch. The bill is pink. The female is duller and lacks the black throat. Her bill is blackish. Immature birds are very distinctive, having olive-brown upperparts with a white rump and yellow throat and upper breast. Diet =Bee colonies= The greater honeyguide feeds primarily on the contents of bee colonies (\\"nests\\"): bee eggs, larvae and pupae; waxworms; and beeswax. (Honeyguides are among the few birds that can digest wax.) It frequently associates with other honeyguides at bees' nests; immatures dominate adults, and immatures of this species dominate all others. Like other honeyguides, the greater honeyguide enters bees' nests while the bees are torpid in the early morning, feeds at abandoned hives (African bees desert more often than those of the temperate zones), and scavenges at hives robbed by people or other large animals, notably the ratel or honey badger. =Guiding of humans= The greater honeyguide is known to guide people to the nests of wild bees. Guiding is unpredictable and is more common among immatures and females than adult males. A guiding bird attracts a person's attention with wavering, chattering \\"'tya' notes compounded with peeps or pipes\\", sounds it also gives in aggression. The guiding bird flies toward an occupied nest (greater honeyguides know the sites of many bees' nests in their territories) and then stops and calls again. As in other situations, it spreads its tail, showing the white spots, and has a \\"bounding, upward flight to a perch\\", which make it conspicuous. If the followers are native honey- hunters, when they reach the nest they incapacitate the adult bees with smoke and open the nest with axes or pangas (machetes). After they take the honey, the honeyguide eats whatever is left. One study found that use of honeyguides by the Boran people of East Africa reduces their search time for honey by approximately two-thirds. Because of this benefit, the Boran use a specific loud whistle, known as the fuulido, when a search for honey is about to begin. The fuulido doubles the encounter rate with honeyguides. Another study of the Yao honey-hunters in northern Mozambique showed that the honeyguides responded to the traditional brrrr-hmm call of the honey-hunters. The chances of finding a bee-hive were greatly increased when the traditional call was used. That study reported anecdotes from Yao honey-hunters that adult but not juvenile honeyguides respond to the specific honey-hunting calls. The tradition of the Bushmen and most other tribes says that the honeyguide must be thanked with a gift of honey; if not, it may lead its follower to a lion, bull elephant, or venomous snake as punishment. However, ‚Äúothers maintain that honeycomb spoils the bird, and leave it to find its own bits of comb‚Äù. Some Greater Honeyguides stopped this guiding behavior, or mutualism, in parts of Kenya, due to a loss of response from people in the area. Possible guiding of non-human animals Adult male illustrated by Nicolas Huet Many sources say that this species also guides honey badgers (ratels). Friedmann (1955, quoted by Harper) notes that Sparrman said in the 18th century that indigenous Africans reported this interaction, but Friedmann adds that no biologist has seen it. According to Dean and MacDonald (1981), Friedmann does quote reports that greater honeyguides guide baboons and speculates that the behavior evolved in relation to these species before the appearance of humanity. However, they state, > In addition to that listed by Friedmann (1955:41-47), the only recent record > is of a greater honeyguide giving its guiding call to baboons at Wankie Game > Reserve, Zimbabwe (C. J. Vernon, pers. comm.). However, Vernon did not see a > positive response by the baboons to the honeyguide. No additional records of > honeyguides and ratels have been reported since Friedmann (1955) and the > first-hand accounts given in his review in support of this association are > all of incomplete guiding sequences. No biologist has ever reported this > association. Dean and MacDonald go on to express doubt that honeyguides guide other animals and suggest that the behavior may have evolved with \\"early man\\". It has also been acknowledged that bee colonies are seasonally very common in Africa and ratels probably have no trouble finding them. Another argument against guiding of non-human animals is that near cities, where Africans increasingly buy sugar rather than hunting for wild honey, guiding behavior is disappearing. Ultimately it may disappear everywhere. =Other food= The greater honeyguide also catches some flying insects, especially swarming termites. It sometimes follows mammals or birds to catch the insects they flush, and joins mixed-species flocks in ones and twos. It has been known to eat the eggs of small birds . Reproduction In addition to being a predator of insects and a mutualist with its follower species, the greater honeyguide is a brood parasite. It lays white eggs in series of 3 to 7, for a total of 10 to 20 in a year. Each egg is laid in a different nest of a bird of another species, including some woodpeckers, barbets, kingfishers, bee-eaters, wood hoopoes, starlings, and large swallows. It is common for the female Greater Honeyguide to break the host's eggs when laying her own. All the species parasitized nest in holes, covered nests, or deep cup nests. The chick has a membranous hook on the bill that it uses, while still blind and featherless, to kill the host's young outright or by repeated wounds.

The Bathtub refers to the underground foundation area at the site of the World Trade Center and accompanying buildings in New York City. The term bathtub is something of a misnomer, as the area does not hold any water; rather the purpose of its design is to keep water out. The name is more so used to describe its shape of a deep basin with high walls, like a bathtub. Description The Bathtub, built in 1967‚Äì1968, encompasses a large, roughly rectangular excavation down to bedrock surrounded by reinforced concrete walls, intended to serve as dams to prevent water intrusion from the nearby Hudson River (North River). It enclosed nearly the entire original World Trade Center. The World Trade Center site was located on man-made water-clogged landfill that had accumulated over centuries, providing an extension of land out onto the Hudson River from the original Manhattan shoreline, with bedrock located below. Manually removing water from this area would have severely altered the water levels surrounding the World Trade Center site and thus jeopardize the foundations of nearby buildings, causing them to sink. This is why the Bathtub method was used. The \\"Bathtub\\" at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum The Bathtub contains a site, including seven basement levels, the downtown terminal of the PATH rapid transit line, and the preexisting New York City Subway's IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line (). The South Tower of the World Trade Center was actually built around the PATH tubes that passed through the foundation area, thus service was uninterrupted throughout the whole of the construction period. The waterproof walls were thick and high. The excavated material that was dug up to build the bathtub was again used as landfill to construct Battery Park City, and the same method was also used to construct the foundation area of the Willis Tower in Chicago. There are several structures that penetrate the Bathtub wall: DWV, utility systems, and PATH trains. Today, a passageway leads between Brookfield Place and the World Trade Center Transportation Hub. Problems Once constructed, the bathtub walls relied on the presence of the basement floors of the WTC to give lateral support. When these were partially destroyed following the collapse of the Twin Towers during the September 11 attacks, it was feared that removing the resulting debris pile could weaken the walls and cause them to fail, endangering workers and possibly compromising other buildings and flooding a significant portion of the subway system. During the recovery and clean-up operation, dangerous degradation of the walls was discovered, prompting an emergency operation to install tiebacks to the bedrock to shore up the bathtub walls. Excavation of a new Bathtub was conducted between 2006 and 2008, with the new Bathtub reaching underground.

Charioteer of Delphi, close up head detail. The Charioteer of Delphi, also known as Heniokhos (, the rein-holder), is one of the best-known statues surviving from Ancient Greece, and is considered one of the finest examples of ancient bronze sculptures. The life-size (1.8m)Janson, H.W. (1995) History of Art. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson.

Background The statue was set up at Delphi Honour, H. and J. Fleming, (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, pp. 132-135. ; Dafas, K. A., 2019. Greek Large-Scale Bronze Statuary: The Late Archaic and Classical Periods, Institute of Classical Studies, School of Advanced Study, University of London, Bulletin of the Institute of Classical Studies, Monograph, BICS Supplement 138 (London), pp. 24-35, pls 16-30. to commemorate the victory of the tyrant Polyzalus of Gela in Sicily and his chariot in the Pythian Games of 470 BC, which were held at Delphi in honor of Pythean Apollo. It has also been suggested that the complex was actually commemorating the victory of Polyzalos' brother, Hieron, at the Pythian Games of 470 BC in analogy to his ex voto after his victory at the Olympic Games. It was originally part of a larger group of statuary, including the chariot, at least four horses and possibly two grooms. Some fragments of the horses were found with the statue. The masterpiece has been associated with the sculptor Pythagoras of Samos who lived and worked in Sicily, as well as with the sculptor Calamis. The Sicilian cities were very wealthy compared with most of the cities of mainland Greece and their rulers could afford the most magnificent offerings to the gods, also the best horses and drivers. It is unlikely, however, the statue itself comes from Sicily. The name of the sculptor is unknown, but for stylistic reasons it is believed that the statue was cast in Athens. It has certain similarities of detail to the statue known as the Piraeus Apollo, which is known to be of Athenian origin. An inscription on the limestone base of the statue shows that it was dedicated by Polyzalus, the tyrant of Gela, a Greek colony in Sicily, as a tribute to Apollo for helping him win the chariot race. The inscription reads: [P]OLUZALOS MA nETH√äK[EN] ...]ON AES EUONUM APOLL[ON], which is reconstructed to read \\"Polyzalus dedicated me. ... Make him prosper, honoured Apollo.\\" Design and completeness Most bronze statues from ancient times were melted down for their raw materials or were naturally corroded, but the Charioteer survived because it was buried under a rock-fall at Delphi, which probably destroyed the site in 373 B.C.. Some freestanding bronze statues, however, including the charioteer, have been rediscovered in the 20th century. Although the Charioteer is the last remaining bronze sculpture from Delphi, the figure exhibited a similar bluish appearance which after a century of indoor exposure turned greenish. The lower torso still preserves a bluish coloration. The Charioteer is almost intact except that his left forearm and some details on the head are missing including the copper inlays on the lips and most of the silver eyelashes and headband. The statue is one of the few Greek bronzes to preserve the inlaid glass eyes. Greek bronzes were cast in sections and then assembled. When discovered, the statue was in three pieces‚Äîhead and upper torso, lower torso, and right arm. The figure is of a very young man, as is shown by his soft side-curls. Like modern jockeys, chariot racers were chosen for their lightness, but also needed to be tall, so they were frequently teenagers. It seems that it represents a teenager from a noble family of his time. As we know, aristocratic chariot racers selected their drivers from glorious noble families to race their chariot in the Panhellenic games. The Charioteer wears the customary long tunic, (the xystin), reaching down to his ankles. A wide belt tightens the tunic high above the waist, while two other bands pass as suspenders over the shoulders, under the arms and criss-cross in the back. This is the analavos which keeps the garment from billowing in the wind during the race. The deep vertical pleats in the lower part of the tunic emphasize the Charioteer‚Äôs solid posture, resembling also the fluting of an Ionic column. On the upper part of the body, however, the pleats are wavy, diagonal or curved. This contrast in the garment representation is also followed by the body‚Äôs contrapuntal posture, so that the statue does not show any rigidity, but looks perfectly mobile and almost real. The entire statue is as if it is animated by a gradual shift to the right starting from the solid stance of the feet and progressing sequentially through the body passing the hips, chest and head to end up at its gaze. The hands are spread out holding the reins, with the long and thin fingers tightening ‚Äì together with the reins ‚Äì a cylindrical object, the riding crop. The Charioteer is not portrayed during the race, as in this case his movement would be more intense, but in the end of the race, after his victory, when ‚Äì being calm and full of happiness ‚Äì he makes the victory lap in the hippodrome. His attractive gemstone eyes evoke what Classical period Greeks called ethos and balance. His motion is instantaneous, but also eternal. In spite of the great victory, there are no shouts, but a calm inner power. The face and the body do not have the features of arrogance, but those of calm self-confidence.

Unusually for this era, the Charioteer is clothed head to foot. Most athletes at this time would have competed, and been depicted nude. The young man would certainly have been of a lower status than his master Polyzalos, and Honour and Fleming have speculated that he may have been a household slave whom it was not appropriate to depict in the nude.

The statue is more naturalistic than the kouroi of the Archaic period, but the pose is still very rigid when compared with later works of the Classical period. One departure from the Archaic style is that the head is inclined slightly to one side. The naturalistic rendering of his feet was greatly admired in ancient times. The introverted expression does away with the old 'Archaic smile'. The Delphos gown In about 1907, some ten years after the discovery of the Charioteer, Mariano Fortuny y Madrazo, a Spanish artist- designer based in Venice, created a finely pleated silk dress that he named the Delphos gown after the statue, whose robes it closely resembled. These gowns are considered important pieces of early 20th century fashion and art objects in their own right. A Delphos gown was, in 2003, the only fashion garment in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.

The series is a 1995 serial of 26 episodes, co-produced between Australia and Poland. It was also novelised by the creators, Mark Shirrefs and John Thomson. The shots were taken both in Australia which represented \\"Paul's world\\" (Sydney, Blue Mountains) and in Poland where most pictures that featured the parallel world were shot (Krak√≥w- Czƒôstochowa Upland, Ogrodzieniec, Zawiercie, Czocha Castle, KsiƒÖ≈º). Czocha Castle was used as the Spellbinder's castle with KsiƒÖ≈º Castle serving for certain interior shots. The ruins of Ogrodzieniec Castle were used as the ruins of the Old Spellbinder's castle. Spellbinder was followed by Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord, in which Heather Mitchell and Rafa≈Ç Zwierz reprise their roles as Ashka and Gryvon respectively. Synopsis A group of teenagers go on a school camp in the Blue Mountains in Australia. While at the camp, Paul Reynolds accidentally goes into a parallel universe. This other world is inhabited by a more hierarchical and technologically different society, ruled by a group of people known as Spellbinders. Paul meets a girl there named Riana, and they become friends. The Spellbinders have discovered the power to create and manipulate static electricity. They fly in gigantic copper-coloured machines that utilise large rotating orange crystals, presumably creating some form of magnetic levitation. The Spellbinders often use their power for good, but some abuse this power and use their discoveries for malevolence. One such malevolent Spellbinder is Ashka, who often manages to hide her true nature. Common people are often \\"banished\\" for their misdeeds, and sometimes Spellbinders are banished, also, if they are proven to have done wrong. There is tension from Paul's forays into the land of the Spellbinders and his attempts to return to his own universe, and also from conversations Paul has with his friends across the barrier between the two universes. Paul and Riana's escapes also add tension, as do the interactions between Spellbinders. Paul is eventually able to travel back home, but he is forced to take Riana with him in order to save her. Later, when Paul is able to take Riana back home, the Spellbinder Ashka follows Paul as he later returns home. Ashka seeks the unwitting help of Paul's father in making her a new high-tech 'flying suit' to replace her power suit in order to make her more powerful than the other Spellbinders. However, Paul manages to expose her scheme and defeat Ashka, who is returned as an outcast to the Spellbinder world, while Riana becomes the new apprentice to Correon. In order to keep the Spellbinder world safe from the more advanced people from \\"modern\\" world, the gateway between the two universes is closed permanently. Cast and characters =Main= * Zbych Trofimiuk as Paul Reynolds ‚Äì a teenage boy from Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His life was normal until a prank at a camp went wrong and he ended up in the land of the Spellbinders. At first, Paul was unsure of how to react to the new world, but he settled in quite quickly and was able to discover Ashka's plot to rule the Spellbinder. Paul has some rough military skills, which, combined with the scientific knowledge from his father, makes him able to defeat Ashka. * Gosia Piotrowska as Riana ‚Äì she lives in the Spellbinder world. Her life was normal until the arrival of Paul. Despite getting off to a somewhat rocky start (Paul being mistaken for a Marauder), however Riana realises that Paul is not a Marauder after he rescues her from drowning in a river and returns her belongings. Riana quickly becomes Paul's friend. She has very good survival skills and can use bolas and a spear. Riana cares very much for her family and is upset when she realises that they may be in danger. In Paul's world, Riana is able to use some of her survival skills to help a newfound friend, and is known as \\"Paul's cousin from Iceland\\". Due to her role in Ashka's defeat, Correon rewards Riana by making her his apprentice. * Brian Rooney as Alex Katsonis ‚Äì Paul's best friend who knows the truth about what happened to Paul and tries his best to bring him back. In the course of the series, he also develops a relationship with his classmate Katrina, even though they are basically as opposite as they can be. Alex has an older brother, who is a mechanic but gets fired for unspecified reasons. * Michela Noonan as Katrina Muggleton ‚Äì brought up by strict parents, Katrina is academically smart at school but has tendencies of naivete. Believing that the Mount Lara lights do exist, she travels up to the cave and is the only other person to both see and believe Paul's disappearance. She realises that the radios can be used to communicate and is able to succeed in helping to bring Paul home. In the second half of the season, Katrina becomes a friend to Riana, taking her shopping and introducing her to the trends of fashion. However, Katrina is easily tricked by Ashka into helping her. * Heather Mitchell as Ashka ‚Äì a Spellbinder. She mistakes Paul for a Marauder at first, throwing a power bolt at him, then, she realises, much to her surprise, that he is unaffected (the rubber soles of his sneakers insulated him) and chases after him. When she meets Paul at the castle and learns about fireworks, she blackmails Paul into giving her the secret of gunpowder, by holding the life of Riana and her family over his head. Paul tricks her twice and Ashka winds up in Paul's world. In Paul's world, Ashka is unfamiliar with all the new sights and sounds and this proves to be a slight disadvantage, however she winds up working with Paul's father and creating a new power suit to take over the Spellbinder world. Ashka is ruthless and intimidating, and has the ability to create lies on the spot. Ashka misuses her power and authority for her own gain, and this leads to her downfall. * Andrew McFarlane as Brian Reynolds ‚Äì Paul's father. A scientist, Brian is usually more wrapped up in his work than his family, but eventually settles down. He refuses to believe that Paul is in another world. Even after Paul returns home, Brian instead believes his son is suffering a trauma. A single father, he shows a romantic interest in Ashka, not realising she is a Spellbinder or that she plans to overthrow the Regents. He helps her create a new power suit. He realises Paul has been telling the truth when he meets Riana and opens his eyes to Ashka's true nature after she threatens Paul. When he realises his mistake, however, his knowledge helps bring Ashka down. * Krzysztof Kumor as Correon ‚Äì a Spellbinder and senior Regent. His studies are on how to repair flying ships and power suits. At first, he does not believe Paul and his claims about where he comes from. When he meets Riana, however, and she shows him the technology from Paul's world via his camcorder, Correon realises that Paul is telling the truth and teams up with Paul and Riana to get Paul home. He calls Ashka a liar and is challenged by her, but he loses (because Ashka, desperate to get rid of Correon, cheated by having Gryvon sabotage his power suit.) and is stripped of his position and sent to the Wastelands where he is rescued by Zander (a supposed Marauder). Correon also reveals Ashka's true nature to the Regents, by showing them Paul's camera, which shows them Ashka's actual motives. Correon is then reinstated as Spellbinder and senior Regent. He also is the one who introduces the Regents to a \\"Marauder\\" and plays a part in Ashka's downfall in the Spellbinder world. * Rafa≈Ç Zwierz as Gryvon ‚Äì Ashka's apprentice. The son of the Clayhill Summoner and Ashka's co- conspirator, Gryvon is selfish and sycophantic, and follows Ashka's orders to the full. He is stripped of his apprenticeship after Ashka escapes and is punished by having to help repair Riana's family cottage, which was burnt by Ashka. Despite the fact he is no longer an apprentice, he still assists Ashka in her plans, but in the end he is exiled just like her. =Recurring= * Joachim Lam≈ºa as Lukan ‚Äì Spellbinder Regent * Hanna Dunowska as Marna ‚Äì Spellbinder Regent * Piotr Adamczyk as Zander ‚Äì a native boy of the Spellbinder world who is banished for making a flying toy (with Paul's help), he later becomes a Marauder. He is the first of the Marauders to discover that the old Spellbinders were responsible for the Darkness and not the Marauders. Correon introduces him to the Regents as a real Marauder. He is impressed by Paul's scientific knowledge on flight. * Julia Biczysko as Arla ‚Äì Riana's younger sister * Stanislaw Brejdygant as the Clayhill Summoner. He is Gryvon's father and is in charge of keeping things order in Clayhill (the village where Riana and her family live). When Paul arrives in the Land of the Spellbinders, he is the first person Paul meets. The Summoner mistakes Paul for a Marauder, and Paul accidentally steals his eyestone. He is unaware of Gryvon helping Ashka in her plan to rule the Spellbinders, and is shocked when she threatens to burn his village. * Erland Buchan as Jal ‚Äì Riana's younger brother * Georgina Fisher as Christine Reynolds ‚Äì Paul's younger sister, who helps keep Riana secret. Christine often expresses the wish for a mother and tries to match-make with her father and her baby-sitter, Gina. * Andrzej Grabarczyk as Bron ‚Äì Riana's father. He lies to the Summoner that Paul is his nephew. * S≈Çawa Michalewska as Maran ‚Äì Riana's mother. She does not trust Paul at first (having him sleep in the barn), but she eventually trusts him after he saves Jal from drowning via CPR. After Paul steals a power suit from the castle, Maran allows the Summoner to detain him. However, after hearing of Ashka's plans for her family, Maran has a change of heart and helps Paul escape by drugging the Summoner and his men with a sleeping drug she slipped into their tea. * Judy Morris as Mrs. Muggleton ‚Äì Katrina's mother, she is strict and overprotective of her daughter. In the series finale, she realises that Katrina and Alex have been telling the truth, and apologises to the both of them for not believing them. * Christian Mcveigh as Mac ‚Äì Spellbinder Regent * Piotr Makowski as Kurn - the leader of the Marauders. The Spellbinder's world Very little is revealed about the history of the Spellbinder's world. At some point in the distant past, a disaster befell the planet, leaving their land surrounded by a wasteland where nothing can survive. They refer to this disaster as \\"the Darkness,\\" and the ancestors of a group called the Marauders (raiders who live on the outskirts of their society, bordering on the wastelands) are blamed for the past catastrophe. It is later learned that the Ancient Spellbinders were the ones actually responsible for the disaster, brought about by their own intellectual arrogance and desire for increasingly powerful weapons. Paul, the visitor from our world, speculates that \\"the Darkness\\" may have been the result of a nuclear winter, although this is not further elaborated upon. Regent Correon, with Paul's help, discovers an ancient book that describes an experiment of the ancient Spellbinders that went horribly wrong, but this book is destroyed by Ashka before more can be learned. The Ancient Spellbinders were technologically advanced, although their everyday lives were relatively simple by the standards of Paul's world. They lived in stone castles and relied on traditional agriculture for food, but they also developed electromagnetic power suits, long-distance radio communication, and metallic ships that used powerful magnetic fields in order to fly. Most of their knowledge was lost after the disaster, and today's Spellbinders only have a limited understanding of the science their technology is based on. Their flying ships and power suits are falling into disarray as they frantically search to rediscover the knowledge lost to them. The Spellbinder world is governed by a council of three Regents who reside in the Spellbinder castle. The Regents are indifferent to the plight of the people outside their castle, enforce a very rigid code of laws designed to protect their power over the land, and ultimately are reluctant to believe Paul's claims about where he comes from. They imprison anyone who discovers or applies the principles of science, such as Zander, a native boy who makes a toy that can fly. The basis of their power over the people is their technology, and they are ruthless in their desire to prevent anyone else from understanding it. People who are exiled to the wastelands are sometimes saved by, and then join, the group of raiders known as Marauders. The people of the Spellbinder world are ignorant of the true nature of the Spellbinders' technology. To them, their power suits and flying ships are magic. The Spellbinders exploit this belief in order to maintain control over the people and use them for labour. Some people are allowed into the Spellbinder castle as servants, while exceptionally bright ones are taken on as apprentices to the Spellbinders. There is some degree of nepotism involved in the process though, as Gryvon is clearly only chosen to be an apprentice because his father is the Summoner of Clayhill. The Spellbinders are beset with internal conflict due to the deterioration of their technology. Because there are only a limited number of power suits and flying ships still in operation, only a select few can be Spellbinders at any given time. At one point, a major dispute is legally settled by a ritualised duel in which Spellbinders fire power bolts at each other; such duels were noted to be somewhat archaic, however. The loser of such a match is stripped of their power suit and exiled to the wastelands to die. The same punishment is also given to anyone who violates the law against using science. Paul's visit may have changed the balance of power in the Spellbinder world. Regent Correon invites Riana to be his new apprentice, and Ashka and Gryvon are punished by being sent to a labour camp (as seen in Spellbinder: Land of the Dragon Lord) for their abuse of power. Although Correon was previously only interested in rediscovering the secrets of the Ancient Spellbinders, he now seems sympathetic to the problems of the people outside his castle, even deciding to share the Spellbinder's knowledge with everyone outside the castle. The rigid hierarchy that defines the Spellbinder society may therefore be weakening, as Correon believes that 'things must change around here'. However, Paul decides that future contact between the two worlds should be avoided in order to prevent Riana's world from being exploited by his own. Spellbinder technology =Power suits= The power suit is the central piece of Spellbinder technology. It is powered by a set of power stones, which can be recharged in the castle complex. By rubbing the cuffs of the suit together, a Spellbinder can generate and discharge a power bolt. In combat, the power suit can be worn with a small shield capable of deflecting power bolts. Although the technology is never fully explained, it is implied that the power suit increases the voltage of energy stored within the power stones and releases it in the form of static electricity. Curiously, while usually capable of immobilising or causing injury to anyone on the receiving end of a bolt, Paul survived a bolt impact unscathed at one point; a feat he put down to the rubber soles of his footwear insulating him and preventing the bolt from grounding through him. Because the suit's copper circuitry is mounted outside the suit, it is easily disabled by splashing it with water, causing a short circuit. The new power suit (named 'Prototype KX4') created by Brian in Paul's world is able to repel the Earth's magnetic field, allowing it to fly. Its circuitry has also been sealed against being shorted out by exposure to water and power bolts are generated and discharged with the press of a button on the suit's gauntlet, rather than striking wrist plates together to generate the static electricity. The keypad on the suit's gauntlet can also control machines, such as a television and even an elevator. The new power suit however has a weakness of strong magnetic fields, just like the powersuits in the Land of the Spellbinders. =Power stones= Power stones are the primary power source for Spellbinder technology. Spellbinders get power stones from their lands. They are used to generate the power bolts released by power suits, and they are also used to create the magnetic fields that power flying ships. They are generally small, rectangular stones with a yellowish-hue, although the power stones found in flying ships are much larger. Power stones can be recharged by infusing them with electricity, which is done in the lower levels of the Spellbinders' castle. =Summoning towers= Summoning towers are large metal towers that resemble electrical transformers and radio towers. The primary purpose of the summoning tower is to contact the Spellbinders when they are needed. An eyestone is placed into a cradle at the base of the tower, which presumably amplifies the signal it generates. The summoning towers also produce a magnetic field used to give flying ships their 'lift' (as evidenced when Paul shorts the main power stone in the castle, causing all flying ships to crash) and can be used as a landing pad for the flying ships. =Eyestones= Spellbinders communicate with each other with a handheld eyestone. The device has an outer lattice bearing the Spellbinder insignia, and opens to reveal a small circuit board. An eyestone creates a weak radio signal, similar to a walkie-talkie. For communicating over great distances, an eyestone must be connected to a summoning tower. Village summoners are the only people besides the Spellbinders who are permitted to use eyestones. =Flying ships= The Spellbinders travel large distances in their metal flying ships. Unlike aeroplanes, which operate on aerodynamic principles, flying ships generate lift through powerful magnetic fields. Each flying ship is equipped with a pair of large power stones on either side, which rotate slowly as the ship moves. This motion creates a magnetic field powerful enough to repel against another magnetic field created by the summoning towers. Flying ships can be used for transportation and also to dust crops with pesticide. Although the technology that powers them is impressive, flying ships generally move somewhat slowly. By the time of Paul's visit to the Spellbinder's world, only six remain in operation. =Compass= Spellbinders use a small magnetic compass to navigate when travelling on foot or horseback. The compass contains a gyro device that is pulled into motion with a piece of string. The arrow of the compass then moves to detect north.

An asado usually consists of beef, pork, chicken, , and which are cooked on a grill, called a parrilla, or an open fire. Generally the meats are accompanied by red wine and salads. This meat is prepared by a person who is the assigned asador or parrillero. History Huge herds of wild cattle roamed much of the pampa region of Argentina until the mid-nineteenth century. Inhabitants of the R√≠o de la Plata, especially the equestrian gaucho, developed a fondness for beef, especially asado, which is roasted beef (or lamb or goat). The meat, often a side of ribs, is skewered on a metal frame called an asador and is roasted by placing it next to a slow-burning fire. Gauchos favored cooking asado with the wood of the quebracho tree because it smokes very little. Asado, accompanied by mat√© tea, formed the basis of the gaucho diet. Coal and fire Asado on an open pit Usually the asador begins by igniting the charcoal, which is often made of native trees, avoiding pines and eucalyptus as they have strong-smelling resins. In more sophisticated asados the charcoal is of a specific tree or made on the coal of recently burned wood, which is also commonplace when having an asado in a campfire. In Uruguay, charcoal is not used, but instead direct embers or hot coals. Cooking can be done al asador or a la parrilla. In the first case, a fire is made on the ground or in a fire pit and surrounded by metal crosses (asadores) that hold the entire carcass of an animal splayed open to receive the heat from the fire. In the second case, a fire is made and after the charcoal has formed, a grill with the meat is placed over it. =Embutidos and Achuras= In many asados, chorizos, morcillas (black pudding), chinchulines (cow chitterlings), mollejas (sweetbreads), and other organs, often accompanied by provoleta, would be served first while the cuts that require longer preparations are still on the grill. Sometimes these are served on a charcoal brasero. Chorizos may be served with pan felipe or baguette bread, often called chorip√°n. =Meats= Asado de tira, flanken-cut short ribs. After appetizers, costillas or asado de tira (ribs) can be served. Next comes vac√≠o (flank steak), matambre and possibly chicken and ' (goatling). Dishes such as pamplona, pork, and Patagonian lamb are becoming more frequent, particularly in restaurants. An asado also includes bread, a simple mixed salad of, for instance, lettuce, tomato, and onions, or it could be accompanied with verdurajo (grilled vegetables), a mixture made of potatoes, corn, onion, and eggplant cooked on the grill and seasoned with olive oil and salt. Beer, wine, soft drink, and other beverages are common. Dessert is usually fresh fruit. Lechazo asado (roast lechazo), shown above, is a typical dish from Spanish cuisine, as is the similar Cochinillo asado (roast suckling pig). Another traditional form to mainly roast the meat, used in Patagonia, is with the whole animal (especially lamb and pork) in a wood stick nailed in the ground and exposed to the heat of live coals, called asado al palo. The meat for an asado is not marinated, the only preparation being the application of salt before or during the cooking period. Also, the heat and distance from the coals are controlled to provide a slow cooking; it usually takes around two hours to cook asado. Further, grease from the meat is not encouraged to fall on the coals and create smoke which would adversely flavour the meat. In some asados the area directly under the meat is kept clear of coals. The asado is usually placed in a tray to be immediately served, but it can also be placed on a brasero right on the table to keep the meat warm. Chimichurri, a sauce of chopped parsley, dried oregano, garlic, salt, black pepper, onion, and paprika with olive oil, or salsa criolla, a sauce of tomato and onion in vinegar, are common accompaniments to an asado, where they are traditionally used on the offal, but not the steaks. =Salad= Food is often accompanied by salads, which in asado gatherings are traditionally made by women on site or brought to the asado from their homes while the men focus on the meats. Salad Olivier (ensalada rusa) is one of the most common salads served at asados. In Paraguay Chipa Guasu, sopa paraguaya and boiled manioc as a side dish is also served. Variations A typical Argentinean asado assortment consisting of beef, pork, ribs, pork ribs, chitterlings, sweetbread, sausages, blood sausages, and chicken. In Chile, the normal version cordero al palo (whole roast lamb) is usually accompanied with pebre, a local condiment made from pureed herbs, garlic, and hot peppers; in many ways similar to chimichurri. The dish is typical of southern Chile and is served hot accompanied by salads. A whole lamb is tied to a spit and is then roasted perpendicular on a wood fire. The preparation lasts around 5 hours since cooking must be constant and on a low heat. Line cooks grilling sausages, asado, and offal in a market near the port of Montevideo, Uruguay. Asado in Patagonia In Brazil, asado is called ', although the cooking is usually faster. Grilled and salted meat in Brazil is generally called \\"carne assada\\" and is often cut into small strips and served on a plate or cutting board in the middle of the table for all to partake. Various grilled meats, pork, sausages and occasionally chicken are also passed around from table to table on a spit and a slice is offered to each person. This is called \\"rodizio\\" because each person partakes in turn. Charcoal is predominantly used instead of embers of wood, and Brazilians tend to cook the meat on skewers or grills. In some places, the meat is seasoned with salt and a little sugar. In Mexico, there is similar tradition of as parrilladas or carne asadas, which incorporates various marinated cuts of meat, including steaks, chicken, and sausages (chorizo, longaniza, and moronga being especially popular). These are all grilled over wood charcoal. Vegetables are also placed over the grill, especially green onions (cebollitas), nopales, and corn (elote). A \\"chulengo\\" is usually an oil barrel cut in half, used to protect the fire and meat from winds Again, in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay, some alternatives are the asado al disco and asado al horno de barro, especially in the countryside. The recipe doesn't change, only the way of cooking. In the asado al disco the worn-out disc of a plough is used. Being metallic and concave, three or four metallic legs are welded and with hot coal or lumber below it is easily transformed into an effective grill. Food is put in a spiral, in such a way that the fat naturally slips to the center, preserving the meat for being fried. Bell peppers and onions are usually put next to the edge, so that they gradually release their juices on the meat. The asado al horno de barro differs from tradition, as an adobe horno (oven, called tatakua in Paraguay) is used. These ovens are a common view in Argentine and Paraguayan estancias; their primary function is to bake bread, Chipa Guasu and Sopa paraguaya, but they are well suited for roasting meat. Pork suckling and, less commonly, lamb are served, as they are more unlikely to become dry. Another way of cooking the asado is inside a chulengo, an oil barrel (or similar) cut in half, inside which the grill is placed to protect both the meat and fire from heavy winds. This makes the chulengo specially used in the Patagonia, although it's also used in other areas for practicality and the ability to move it around. Other dishes South American asado should not to be confused with asado in the Philippines, which refers to two different braised dishes: asado de carajay, which is braised meat with vegetables in a savory stew; and pork asado, which is a sweet braised version of '. The equivalent of Latin American asado barbecues in Philippine cuisine would be the various inihaw dishes (also known as sinugba or inasal). In Portugal, a roasted fish dish served with sausages and bacon is also known as assado. In Goa, roast beef is called assad, from Portuguese assado.

It is predominantly black and white, with a reddish nape. Diurnal, Geoffroy's tamarin spends most of its time in trees, but does come down to the ground occasionally. It lives in groups that most often number between three and five individuals, and generally include one or more adults of each sex. It eats a variety of foods, including insects, exudates, fruits and other plant parts. Insects and fruits account for the majority of its diet, but exudates are also important. But since its teeth are not adapted for gouging trees to get to the sap, it can only eat exudates when they are easily available. Although a variety of reproductive methods are used, the most common is for a single adult female in the group to be reproductively active and to mate with multiple adult males in the group. After a gestation period of about 145 days, she gives birth to either a single infant or twins. Males contribute significantly to care of the infants. Sexual maturity is reached at about 2 years, and it can live up to 13 years. Geoffroy's tamarin is classified as being of \\"least concern\\" by the IUCN.  Taxonomy  Like the other tamarins and marmosets, Geoffroy's tamarin is a New World monkey classified within the family Callitrichidae. In 2001, Colin Groves included the Callitrichids in the family Cebidae, which also includes capuchin monkeys and squirrel monkeys, but in 2009 Anthony Rylands and Russell Mittermeier reverted to older classifications which considered Callitrichidae a separate family. It is a member the genus Saguinus, the genus containing most tamarins. There are no recognized subspecies. In 1977, Philip Hershkovitz classified Geoffroy's tamarin as a subspecies of the cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus), which resides exclusively in Colombia, based on fur coloration, cranial and mandibular morphology, and ear size. However, more recent research indicates that the two taxa differ sufficiently to be considered separate species.  Physical description  In common with other callitrichides (tamarins and marmosets), Geoffroy's tamarin is a small monkey. With a length of between , excluding the tail, it is the smallest Central American monkey. The tail length is between . Males have an average weight of , and females are slightly larger on average, with an average weight of . The fur on its back is variegated black and yellow, with pale legs, feet and chest. Its face is nearly bare, but the head has reddish fur with a triangle- shaped patch in the front of the head. The tail is chestnut-red and has a black tip.  Behavior  Like all callitrichides, Geoffroy's tamarin is diurnal and arboreal. Unlike some other New World monkeys, it does come down to the ground occasionally. This is normally done only in special circumstances, such as to acquire certain foods or to get to a tree it cannot otherwise reach. Group size is generally between three and nine monkeys, with three to five being most common. Groups often consist of more than one adult of each sex. Adults of both sexes migrate between groups. Groups show some degree of territorial defense. Population densities on Barro Colorado Island in Panama range between 3.6 and 5.7 monkeys per square kilometer, but in other areas the population density can be as much as 20 to 30 monkeys per square kilometer. On average, Geoffroy's tamarin ranges 2061 meters per day. Home range size varies between 9.4 hectares and 32 hectares. Communication occurs both though vocalization and by visual gestures. Vocalizations that have been recorded include whistles, twitters, trills, loud or soft sharp notes, sneezes and long rasps. Body postures and displays that reveal more of the white coloration, such as standing on hind legs and piloerection, tend to be associated with aggression. Females often signal willingness to mate by rapidly coiling their tails. Geoffroy's tamarin has been considered a subspecies of the similar alt=Monkey facing left, with black face, white on most of the rest of the front, and dark in the rear Unlike squirrels, which often move through the canopy by climbing and descending vertical tree trunks, Geoffroy's tamarin generally avoids large vertical supports during travel. It prefers to move across thin branches, ascending and descending by long leaps. To the extent Geoffroy's tamarin uses large vertical supports for travel, it uses them most often for ascending rather than descending. Geoffroy's tamarin generally avoids sympatric small and medium size monkey species such as the white-headed capuchin and the Panamanian night monkey. Avoidance is spatial with respect to the capuchin, and temporal in the case of the night monkey, since Geoffroy's tamarin is only active during daylight hours and the Panamanian night monkey is only active at night. Geoffroy's tamarin is rarely observed in the vicinity of squirrels, although this appears to be the result of the squirrels avoiding interactions with the larger tamarins. Geoffroy's tamarin generally attempts to escape when birds of prey approach, regardless of whether the bird presents a true danger. However, the tamarins ignore one bird of prey, the double-toothed kite, which sometimes follows the tamarins in an apparent effort to feed on small animals disturbed by the tamarins. The diet of Geoffroy's tamarin is similar to some species of tyrant flycatcher birds in Panama, and they share similar vocalizations. The tamarins may use the flycatcher calls to help find favorable food sources. The flycatchers and tamarins have different patterns of activity, which minimizes competition for similar food sources. The flycatchers are most active shortly after dawn and tend to rest in the middle of the day. The tamarins do not become active until about 45 minutes after full daylight, but remain active for most of the remaining daylight hours until an hour or less before sunset. = Diet = Geoffroy's tamarin has a varied diet that includes fruits, insects, exudates (gums and saps), and green plant parts. The diet varies seasonally. A study by Paul Garber estimated that the diet was made up of 40% insects, 38% fruit, 14% exudates (almost entirely from Anacardium excelsum cashew trees), and 8% other items. Another study, on Barro Colorado Island, showed 60% fruit, 30% insects and 10% green plant parts, including large amounts of elephant ear tree (Enterolobium cyclocarpum) sap. Another study showed a diet about equally split between insects (mostly grasshoppers) and fruit. Unlike marmosets, tamarins do not have dentition adapted for gouging trees, so Geoffroy's tamarin eats sap only when it is easily accessible. It generally hunts for insects by making quick movements on thin, flexible supports. In contrast, it generally feeds on sap while clinging to large vertical tree trunks. In one study, Geoffroy's tamarin drank water from the corollas of Ochroma limonesis flowers. However, it is believed to also drink from tree holes, similar to other tamarin species.  Reproduction  Geoffroy's tamarin can give birth throughout the year, but the birthing peak is from April to June. A single infant or twins can be born, although it is not uncommon for one of the twins to perish within the first few months. The gestation period is believed to be about 145 days, similar to the cottontop tamarin. The interbirth period ranges between 154 and 540 days, with an average of 311 days. The longer interbirth periods occur after twins. Infants weigh between and are born fully furred. The infant's fur is colored differently than the parents'; the infant has black fur on the body and tail, with a beige blaze and white face. The infant coloration reduces the visibility of white, which is associated with aggressive displays by the species. Both polyandrous and polygynous mating occurs, and males contribute heavily to parental care. But typically, only one adult female in a group is reproductively active, and reproductively active females mate with multiple males if given the opportunity. Males carry and groom infants more than females do. Older siblings may also contribute to infant care, although infants prefer to be carried by their parents than their siblings. Infants become mobile at 2 to 5 weeks, and begin eating solid food at 4 to 7 weeks. They are independent at 10 to 18 weeks and are fully weaned at 15 to 25 weeks. Geoffroy's tamarin becomes sexually mature at about 2 years, and can live up to 13 years.  Distribution and habitat  Geoffroy's tamarin lives in various types of forest, including primary and secondary forest, and dry and moist tropical forest. In Panama, it prefers secondary forests with moderate humidity. It occurs in central and eastern Panama, with the range extending slightly west of the Panama Canal zone and has been observed as far west as Altos de Campana National Park. It is less common on the Atlantic coast of Panama than the Pacific coast, and is only abundant on the Atlantic coast in areas near the Canal zone that have been modified by man. It occurs in Metropolitan Natural Park, an urban park within Panama City. In Colombia, it occurs on the Pacific coast west of the Andes, south to the Rio San Juan. The eastern boundary of its range in Colombia was once thought to be the Rio Atrato, but has been reported further east, including the Las Orqu√≠deas National Park. Older sources sometimes report the species occurring in southern Costa Rica, but these are most likely erroneous.  Conservation status  The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies Geoffroy's tamarin as being \\"near threatened\\" However, in some localities the population may be declining due to habitat loss. It is also sometimes hunted and captured for the pet trade in Panama. A 1985 study in Panama concluded that Geoffroy tamarin population densities are higher in areas where human access is limited. Human activity in Panama can have both positive and negative effects on Geoffroy's-tamarin populations. While hunting decreases the population, cutting mature forest for agriculture provides more areas of secondary growth, which is beneficial for the tamarin.

These events appealed to audiences in the 1970s who were more familiar with rock 'n' roll music and were staged complete with light shows. His many recordings made on the RCA Victor and Capitol labels, mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, have been remastered and re-released on compact disc in recent years. They continue to be widely available in mainstream music stores. Birth and studies Virgil Fox was born in Princeton, Illinois to Miles and Birdie Fox, showing musical talent at an early age. He began playing the organ for church services at the age of ten, and four years later made his concert debut before an audience of 2500 at Withrow High School, Cincinnati. The program included one of the mainstays of 19th-century organ music: Mendelssohn's Sonata No. 1 in F minor. From 1926 to 1930, he studied in Chicago under German-born organist-composer Wilhelm Middelschulte. His other principal teachers were Hugh Price, Louis Robert, and (once he had moved to France) Marcel Dupr√©. He was an alumnus of the Peabody Institute of Music in Baltimore, where he became the first student to complete the course for the Artist's Diploma within a year. He was also a student of Louis Vierne. Early career Beginning in 1936, Fox was organist at Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore while teaching at Peabody. During August and September, 1938, he played in Great Britain and Germany; Fox was the first non-German organist given permission to perform publicly in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig‚Äîa special occasion, since Bach served as cantor of the Thomaskirche until his death in 1750. Bach was reburied in that church in 1950. Military service During World War II, Fox enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces and took a leave of absence from Brown Memorial Presbyterian Church in Baltimore and the Peabody. He was promoted to staff sergeant and played various recitals and services at the request of Eleanor Roosevelt. He served on her Home Hospitality Committee and entertained returning troops who were in Walter Reed Hospital, by playing a piano he pushed around, and joining in with two others. They sang funny and rather raunchy songs to the bedridden. After having played more than 600 concerts while on duty, plus his obligations to H.H.C, he was discharged from the Army Air Forces in 1946. Riverside Church Fox then served as organist at the prominent Riverside Church in New York City, from 1946 to 1965. The organ was built for him by famed organ builder G. Donald Harrison, Master Builder of the Mormon Tabernacle organ plus others. Under his direction, the Riverside organ was expanded to become one of the largest in North America. His extemporaneous hymn accompaniments at Riverside's Sunday services and concert performances were widely acclaimed, and fans would wait after church services for hours to meet him. Recordings made during this period brought his playing to larger audiences. Among his recordings, some of which are now overlooked, the Transcriptions he improvised upon: Songs at Sunset, Vale of Dreams, Silhouettes. In 1965, Fox retired from the church to devote himself to performing full-time. Concert tours From 1971 until 1978, Fox performed his famous \\"Heavy Organ\\" concerts in auditoriums, popular music concert halls, and other nontraditional organ music venues, touring around the United States with a rented electronic Rodgers Touring Organ. Later on he used his own instrument, a massive four-manual, custom-designed Allen Organ (1977‚Äì1980). Heavy Organ was a concept devised and developed by Fox's long-time managers Richard Torrence and Marshall Yaeger, with Yaeger as the originator of the idea. The Heavy Organ concerts would exclusively feature works of Johann Sebastian Bach and would use a large-scale light show that would be precisely coordinated with the music, thereby bringing together aural and visual elements. Torrence and Yaeger, through their marketing savvy and release of best-selling recordings of live Heavy Organ performances, made Heavy Organ a household name in classical music. It also earned Fox well over a million dollars in performance fees. Fox was one of the rare organists to perform on nationally televised entertainment programs in the 1960s and 1970s, such as The Mike Douglas Show, The Ed Sullivan Show, and CBS Camera Three, bringing organ masterworks to mass audiences as no other organist had done before. His last commercially-released recording, though unauthorized, was made at his return (by popular demand) to Riverside Church in concert on May 6, 1979. Fox's 50th year of performing began when he appeared with the Dallas Symphony in September 1980, in what was to be his final public performance. Racked with pain from terminal prostate cancer, for which he had undergone unsuccessful treatment in 1976, Fox completed only one of the two concerts, returning to Florida to be hospitalized near home. On October 25, he died in Palm Beach, Florida and lay in state in Casa Lagomar, in which his funeral was conducted by his partner, David Snyder. A later funeral was held at Crystal Cathedral in California. Music Always Fox stressed pushing the limits of the instruments available to him, rather than requiring that they, or his playing, be authentic to the era of the music. His style (particularly his taste for fast tempos, intricate registrations, and a willingness to indulge in sentimentality) was in contrast to that of his contemporaries, such as E. Power Biggs. Fox was also famous for his musical memory, and could instantly recall over 250 concert works, playing at double speed or faster in rehearsals (which usually went late into the night). He played all concerts from memory and very rarely read from written scores even when playing alongside an orchestra. Many organists, however, have strongly criticized Fox for his unconventional interpretations of classical organ music. On his album Heavy Organ: Bach Live at Winterland, Fox defended his approach to Bach and organ music in general, in the introduction to the ubiquitous Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, by Johann Sebastian Bach; Virgil always spoke to his audiences about Bach's reason for his compositions being his belief in Jesus and everlasting life whenever he performed his music. For once making a similar speech at one of his recitals, music critic Alan Rich called him \\"the Liberace of the organ loft\\", and severely took him to task in New York Magazine. Despite (or perhaps because of) his controversial approach to organ music, Virgil Fox attained a celebrity status not unlike that of Leonard Bernstein and Glenn Gould. The New York Times said of him, 20 years after his death, \\"Fox could play the pipe organ like nobody's business, but that is not all that made him unforgettable to so many people across the country. He made classical organ music appeal even to audiences that normally wouldn't be expected to sit still for it.\\" In a sign of continued recognition unusual for a performer (as distinct from a composer), Virgil Fox memorial recitals and concerts continue to be staged, more than a quarter-century after his death. Honors Fox was a National Patron of Delta Omicron, an international professional music fraternity. He designed the 1964 Reuter Pipe Organ at Bucknell University and was awarded a Doctorate Degree. He was given Keys to the City in numerous acts of gratitude by Mayors of numerous cities. Personal life Virgil Fox (The Dish): An Irreverent Biography of the Great American Organist by Marshall Yaeger and Richard Torrence (2001), a compendium of reminiscences by contemporaries of Virgil Fox, is expanded upon in an unpublished autobiography of organist Ted Alan Worth, one of Fox's proteges and closest friends. Fox is buried at the Pioneer Cemetery, Dover, Illinois, US.

It is an interim loan given to finance the difference between the floor loan and the maximum permanent loan as committed. More specifically, gap financing is subordinated temporary financing paid off when the first mortgagee disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent ‚Äúfloor- ceiling loan,‚Äù where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the first mortgagee funds only a floor amount, agreein to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender's rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at the time for the permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan. Normally, the permanent lender's rent-roll requirement involves a period that runs from one to three years. However, the promissory note for the gap loan should be predicated on the possibility that the rent-roll requirement may not be met, and the terms should include a period of four to five years beyond the rent- roll requirement period, with a high enough interest rate to prompt the developer to refinance whenever it becomes feasible to do so. With regard to principal amortization, some gap lenders require none, while others require either partial amortization or amortization to the extent that there is net cash flow to be derived from the project. Because of its prior position as construction lender, the gap lender usually has sufficient leverage with the permanent lender to receive adequate notice provisions and a right-to-cure period from the permanent lender. Gap financing can also be used in purchase/rehab lending to fill the \\"gap\\" between the borrower's down payment, and the amount lent by the 1st lien holder, or rehab lender. Typically rehab lenders will only go to 65-70% ARV (After Repair Value), so if the borrower is bringing 10% into the deal, the gap funder would provide the other 20-25%, and take a 2nd position lien and often a portion of the profit.

It was incorporated in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality in 2000. It was made part of Region 2 and, as of 2006, when the number of regions were reduced to seven, it forms part of Region A of the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. Though no longer an independent town, the name Midrand is still in common use to denote the suburbs around the N1 highway north of the Jukskei River up to the border with City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. (This portion of the N1 highway is also known as the Ben Schoeman Highway.) Suburbs that are generally regarded as being in Midrand include among others: Country View, Carlswald, Crowthorne, Glen Austin, Halfway House, Halfway Gardens, Vorna Valley, Noordwyk, Randjesfontein, Blue Hills and Kyalami Agricultural Holdings. In 2010, it was reported that the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality wished to annex Midrand from the City of Johannesburg, reportedly to boost its income, which was severely strained. The city is relatively modern, having experienced much growth in the last decade.

His nickname the Rich refers to him having many children. However, he owned a number of counties: Nassau-Dillenburg, Nassau-Siegen, Nassau-Dietz and Vianden. William was born in Dillenburg as the younger son of Count John V of Nassau-Dillenburg and Landgravine Elisabeth, daughter of Landgrave Henry III of Hesse-Marburg and Anna of Katzenelnbogen. He was the brother of count Henry III of Nassau-Breda and the father of William I of Orange. His eldest son William the Silent inherited the principality of Orange in Southern France from his cousin Ren√© of Chalon, as well as the vast properties of the House of Nassau-Dillenburg in the Netherlands from his father, which Engelbert I of Nassau had received by marriage in 1403.

Responses that habituate include those that involve the intact organism (e.g., full-body startle response) or those that involve only components of the organism (e.g., habituation of neurotransmitter release from in vitro Aplysia sensory neurons). The broad ubiquity of habituation across all biologic phyla has resulted in it being called \\"the simplest, most universal form of learning...as fundamental a characteristic of life as DNA.\\" Dethier, V. G. (1976). The hungry fly: a physiological study of the behavior associated with feeding. Harvard University Press Functionally- speaking, by diminishing the response to an inconsequential stimulus, habituation is thought to free-up cognitive resources to other stimuli that are associated with biologically important events (i.e., punishment/reward). For example, organisms may habituate to repeated sudden loud noises when they learn these have no consequences. A progressive decline of a behavior in a habituation procedure may also reflect nonspecific effects such as fatigue, which must be ruled out when the interest is in habituation. Habituation is clinically relevant, as a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including autism, schizophrenia, migraine, and Tourette's, show reductions in habituation to a variety of stimulus-types both simple (tone) and complex (faces). Drug habituation There is an additional connotation to the term habituation which applies to psychological dependency on drugs, and is included in several online dictionaries. A team of specialist from the World Health Organization assembled in 1957 to address the problem of drug addiction and adopted the term \\"drug habituation\\" to distinguish some drug-use behaviors from drug addiction. According to the WHO lexicon of alcohol and drug terms, habituation is defined as \\"becoming accustomed to any behavior or condition, including psychoactive substance use\\". By 1964 the America Surgeon's General report on smoking and health included four features that characterize drug habituation according to WHO: 1) \\"a desire (but not a compulsion) to continue taking the drug for the sense of improved well-being which it engenders\\"; 2) \\"little or no tendency to increase the dose\\"; 3) \\"some degree of psychic dependence on the effect of the drug, but absence of physical dependence and hence of an abstinence syndrome\\"; 4) \\"detrimental effects, if any, primarily on the individual\\". However, also in 1964, a committee from the World Health Organization once again convened and decided the definitions of drug habituation and drug addiction were insufficient, replacing the two terms with \\"drug dependence\\". Substance dependence is the preferred term today when describing drug-related disorders, whereas the use of the term drug habituation has declined substantially. This is not to be confused with true habituation to drugs, wherein repeated doses have an increasingly diminished effect, as is often seen in addicts or persons taking painkillers frequently. Characteristics Habituation as a form of non-associative learning can be distinguished from other behavioral changes (e.g., sensory/neural adaptation, fatigue) by considering the characteristics of habituation that have been identified over several decades of research. The characteristics first described by Thompson and Spencer have recently been updated and include the following: Repeated presentation of a stimulus will cause a decrease in reaction to the stimulus. Habituation is also proclaimed to be a form of implicit learning, which is commonly the case with continually repeated stimuli. This characteristic is consistent with the definition of habituation as a procedure, but to confirm habituation as a process, additional characteristics must be demonstrated. Also observed is spontaneous recovery. That is, a habituated response to a stimulus recovers (increases in magnitude) when a significant amount of time (hours, days, weeks) passes between stimulus presentations. \\"Potentiation of habituation\\" is observed when tests of spontaneous recovery are given repeatedly. In this phenomenon, the decrease in responding that follows spontaneous recovery becomes more rapid with each test of spontaneous recovery. Also noted was that an increase in the frequency of stimulus presentation (i.e., shorter interstimulus interval) will increase the rate of habituation. Furthermore, continued exposure to the stimulus after the habituated response has plateaued (i.e., show no further decrement) may have additional effects on subsequent tests of behavior such as delaying spontaneous recovery. The concepts of stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination will be observed. Habituation to an original stimulus will also occur to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus (stimulus generalization). The more similar the new stimulus is to the original stimulus, the greater the habituation that will be observed. When a subject shows habituation to a new stimulus that is similar to the original stimulus but not to a stimulus that is different from the original stimulus, then the subject is showing stimulus discrimination. (For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime). Stimulus discrimination can be used to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as an alternative explanation of the habituation process. Another observation mentioned is when a single introduction of a different stimulus late in the habituation procedure when responding to the eliciting stimulus has declined can cause an increase in the habituated response. This increase in responding is temporary and is called \\"dishabituation\\" and always occurs to the original eliciting stimulus (not to the added stimulus). Researchers also use evidence of dishabituation to rule out sensory adaptation and fatigue as alternative explanations of the habituation process. Habituation of dishabituation can occur. The amount of dishabituation that occurs as a result of the introduction of a different stimulus can decrease after repeated presentation of the \\"dishabituating\\" stimulus. Some habituation procedures appear to result in a habituation process that last days or weeks. This is considered long-term habituation. It persists over long durations of time (i.e., shows little or no spontaneous recovery). Long-term habituation can be distinguished from short- term habituation which is identified by the nine characteristics listed above. Biological mechanisms Habituation can refer to a decrease in behavior, subjective experience, or synaptic transmission. The changes in synaptic transmission that occur during habituation have been well-characterized in the Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex. Habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal and at least, in one species of plants (Mimosa pudica), in isolated neuronally-differentiated cell-lines, as well as in quantum perovskite.Zuo, Fan, et al. \\"Habituation based synaptic plasticity and organismic learning in a quantum perovskite.\\" Nature communications 8.1 (2017): 240. The experimental investigation of simple organisms such as the large protozoan Stentor coeruleus provides an understanding of the cellular mechanisms that are involved in the habituation process. =Neuroimaging= Within psychology, habituation has been studied through different forms of neuroimaging like PET scan and fMRI. Habituation is observed after repeated presentations of stimuli. Within fMRI, the stimuli's effect is measured using blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals. Long-term decreases of the BOLD signal are interpreted as habituation, and long-term increases of the BOLD signal are interpreted as sensitization. The amygdala is one of the most- studied areas of the brain in relation to habituation. A common approach is to observe the visual processing of facial expressions. A study by Breiter and colleagues used fMRI scans to identify which areas of the brain habituate and at what rate. Their results showed that the human amygdala responds and rapidly habituates preferentially to fearful facial expressions over neutral ones. They also observed significant amygdala signal changes in response to happy faces over neutral faces. Blackford, Allen, Cowan, and Avery (2012) compared the effect of an extremely inhibited temperament and an extremely uninhibited temperament on habituation. Their study found that over repeated presentations individuals with an uninhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in both the amygdala and hippocampus, whereas participants with an inhibited temperament demonstrated habituation in neither brain region. The researchers suggest that this failure to habituate reflects a social learning deficit in individuals with an extremely inhibited temperament, which is a possible mechanism for a higher risk of social anxiety. Debate about learning-status Although habituation has been regarded as a learning process by some as early as 1887,George, W., and Elizabeth G. Peckham. \\"Some observations on the mental powers of spiders.\\" Journal of Morphology 1.2 (1887): 383-419. its learning status remained controversial up until the 1920s - 1930s.Christoffersen, G. R. J. \\"Habituation: events in the history of its characterization and linkage to synaptic depression. A new proposed kinetic criterion for its identification.\\" Progress in neurobiology 53.1 (1997): 45-66. While conceding that reflexes may \\"relax\\" or otherwise decrease with repeated stimulation, the \\"invariance doctrine\\" stipulated that reflexes should not remain constant and that variable reflexes were a pathological manifestation. Indeed, air pilots who showed habituation of post-rotational nystagmus reflex were sometimes ejected from or not recruited for service for World War I: on the grounds that a variable reflex response indicated either a defective vestibular apparatus or a lack of vigilance.Barany, R. Weitere Untersuchungen fiber den vom Vestibularapparat des Ohres reflektorisch ausgel6sten rlaythmischen Nystagmus und seine Begleiterscheinungen. Mschr. Ohrenheilk, 41.Fisher, Lewis. \\"Vertigo: Its causes and methods of diagnosis.\\" The American Journal of Surgery 31.3 (1917): 67-70. Eventually, however, more research from the medical and scientific communities concluded that stimulus- dependent variability reflexes is clinically normal.Mowrer, O. H. (1934) The modification of vestibular nystagmus by means of repeated elicitation. Camp. Psychol. Monogr. IX, 1-48. The opposition to the considering habituation a form of learning was also based on the assumption that learning processes must produce novel behavioral responses and must occur in the cerebral cortex. Non- associative forms of learning such as habituation (and sensitization) do not produce novel (conditioned) responses but rather diminish a pre-existing (innate) responses and often are shown to depend on peripheral (non-cerebral) synaptic changes in the sensory-motor pathway. Most modern learning theorists, however, consider any behavioral change that occurs as a result of experience to be learning, so long as it cannot be accounted for by motor fatigue, sensory adaption, developmental changes or damage. Criteria for verifying a response-decline as learning Importantly, systematic response-declines can be produced by non-learning factors such as sensory adaptation (obstruction of stimulus detection), motor fatigue, or damage. Three diagnostic criteria are used to distinguish response-declines produced by these non-learning factors and response-declines produced by habituation (learning) processes. These are: # Recovery by Dishabituation # Sensitivity of Spontaneous Recovery to Rate-of- Stimulation # Stimulus-specificity Early studies relied on the demonstration of 1) Recovery by Dishabituation (the brief recovery of the response to the eliciting stimulus when another stimulus is added) to distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation and fatigue. More recently, 2) Sensitivity of Spontaneous Recovery to Rate-of-Stimulation and 3) Stimulus-specificity have been used as experimental evidence for the habituation process. Spontaneous Recovery is sensitive to spontaneous recovery, showing recovery that is inversely correlated with the amount of response-decline. This is the opposite of what would be expected if sensory adaption or motor fatigue were the cause of the response-decline. Sensory adaptation (or neural adaptation) occurs when an organism can no longer detect the stimulus as efficiently as when first presented and motor fatigue occurs when an organism is able to detect the stimulus but can no longer respond efficiently. Stimulus-specificity stipulates that the response-decline is not general (due to motor fatigue) but occurs only to the original stimulus that was repeated. If a response-decline shows 1) dishabituation, 2) spontaneous recovery that is inversely correlated with the extent of decline, and/or 3) stimulus-specificity, then habituation learning is supported. Despite the ubiquity of habituation and its modern acceptance as a genuine form of learning it has not enjoyed the same focus within research as other forms of learning. On this topic, the animal psychologist James McConnell said ‚Äú...nobody cares‚Ä¶much about habituation‚Äù). It has been suggested that the apathy held towards habituation is due to 1) resistance from traditional learning theorists maintain memory requires reproduction of propositional/linguistic content; 2) resistance from behaviorists who maintain that \\"true\\" learning requires the development of a novel response (whereas habituation is a decrease in a pre-existing response); 3) the behavioral measure of habituation (i.e., a response-decline) is very susceptible to confound by non-learning factors (e.g., fatigue) which, therefore, make it more difficult to study (reviewed in). Theories Various models have been proposed to account for habituation including the Stimulus- Model Comparator theory formulated by Evgeny Sokolov, the Groves and Thompson dual-process theory, and the SOP (Standard Operating Procedures/Sometimes Opponent Process) model formulated by Allan Wagner. Wagner, A. R. (2014). SOP: A model of automatic memory processing in animal behavior. In Information processing in animals (pp. 15-58). Psychology Press. = Stimulus-model comparator theory = The stimulus-model comparator theory emerged from the research of Sokolov who used the orienting response as the cornerstone of his studies, and operationally defining the orienting response as EEG activity. Orienting responses are heightened sensitivity experienced by an organism when exposed to a new or changing stimulus. Orienting responses can result in overt, observable behaviors as well as psychophysiological responses such as EEG activity and undergo habituation with repeated presentation of the eliciting stimulus. The Sokolov model assumes that when a stimulus is experienced several times, the nervous system creates a model of the expected stimulus (a stimulus model). With additional presentations of the stimulus, the experienced stimulus is compared with the stimulus model. If the experienced stimulus matches the stimulus model, responding is inhibited. At first the stimulus model is not a very good representation of the presented stimulus, and thus responding continues because of this mismatch. With additional presentations the stimulus model is improved, there is no longer a mismatch, and responding is inhibited causing habituation. However, if the stimulus is changed so that it no longer matches the stimulus model, the orienting response is no longer inhibited. Sokolov locates the stimulus model in the cerebral cortex. = Dual-process theory = The Groves and Thompson dual-process theory of habituation posits that two separate processes exist in the central nervous system that interacts to produce habituation. The two distinct processes are a habituation process and a sensitization process. The dual-process theory argues that all noticeable stimuli will elicit both of these processes and that the behavioral output will reflect a summation of both processes. The habituation process is decremental, whereas the sensitization process is incremental enhancing the tendency to respond. Thus when the habituation process exceeds the sensitization process behavior shows habituation, but if the sensitization process exceeds the habituation process, behavior shows sensitization. Groves and Thompson hypothesize the existence of two neural pathways: an \\"S-R pathway\\" involved with the habituation process, and a \\"state pathway\\" involved with sensitization. The state system is seen as equivalent to a general state of arousal. Examples of the habituation process in animals and humans Habituation has been observed in an enormously wide range of species from motile single-celled organisms such as the amoeba and Stentor coeruleus to sea slugs to humans. Habituation processes are adaptive, allowing animals to adjust their innate behaviors to changes in their natural world. A natural animal instinct, for example, is to protect themselves and their territory from any danger and potential predators. An animal needs to respond quickly to the sudden appearance of a predator. What may be less obvious is the importance of defensive responses to the sudden appearance of any new, unfamiliar stimulus, whether it is dangerous or not. An initial defensive response to a new stimulus is important because if an animal fails to respond to a potentially dangerous unknown stimulus, the results could be deadly. Despite this initial, innate defensive response to an unfamiliar stimulus, the response becomes habituated if the stimulus repeatedly occurs but causes no harm. An example of this is the prairie dog habituating to humans. Prairie dogs give alarm calls when they detect a potentially dangerous stimulus. This defensive call occurs when any mammal, snake, or large bird approaches them. However, they habituate to noises, such as human footsteps, that occur repeatedly but result in no harm to them. If prairie dogs never habituate to nonthreatening stimuli, they would be constantly sending out alarm calls and wasting their time and energy. However, the habituation process in prairie dogs may depend on several factors including the particular defensive response. In one study that measured several different responses to the repeated presence of humans, the alarm calls of prairie dogs showed habituation whereas the behavior of escaping into their burrows showed sensitization. Another example of the importance of habituation in the animal world is provided by a study with harbor seals. In one study researchers measured the responses of harbor seals to underwater calls of different types of killer whales. The seals showed a strong response when they heard the calls of mammal-eating killer whales. However, they did not respond strongly when hearing familiar calls of the local fish-eating population. The seals, therefore, are capable of habituating to the calls of harmless predators, in this case harmless killer whales. While some researchers prefer to simply describe the adaptive value of observable habituated behavior, others find it useful to infer psychological processes from the observed behavior change. For example, habituation of aggressive responses in male bullfrogs has been explained as \\"an attentional or learning process that allows animals to form enduring mental representations of the physical properties of a repeated stimulus and to shift their focus of attention away from sources of irrelevant or unimportant stimulation\\". Habituation of innate defensive behaviors is also adaptive in humans, such as habituation of a startle response to a sudden loud noise. But habituation is much more ubiquitous even in humans. An example of habituation that is an essential element of everyone's life is the changing response to food as it is repeatedly experienced during a meal. When people eat the same food during a meal, they begin to respond less to the food as they become habituated to the motivating properties of the food and decrease their consumption. Eating less during a meal is usually interpreted as reaching satiety or \\"getting full\\", but experiments suggest that habituation also plays an important role. Many experiments with animals and humans have shown that providing variety in a meal increases the amount that is consumed in a meal, most likely because habituation is stimulus specific and because variety may introduce dishabituation effects. Food variety also slows the rate of habituation in children and may be an important contributing factor to the recent increases in obesity. We also find that habituation is found in our emotional responses, called the opponent-process theory, proposed by researchers Richard Solomon and John Corbit (1974). It is known that responses by the subject tends to change by repetitively presenting certain stimuli. But concerning the opponent-process theory, some emotional reactions to the stimuli weaken (decrease) while others' reactions are strengthened (increase). Take, for example, that it is the end of the semester at your university. You have been worried about your grade for the entire semester and you need a grade of \\"A\\" on the final in order to pass the course. You study efficiently for the test and after taking it, you feel that you will receive a very high grade. But once you check the gradebook, you see that you did not get an \\"A\\" on your exam. Instead you received a \\"C+\\". Now you are distraught and know that there is no other way to pass the course for the semester. After a few minutes you begin to calm down and by the next hour you are back to your normal emotional state. This is an example of an emotional response explained by the opponent- process theory. It begins with an outside stimulus provoking an emotional reaction that increases rapidly until it is at its most intense (presumably after you learned that you did not receive a high letter grade). Gradually, your emotional state declines to a level lower than normal and eventually returns to neutral. This pattern coincides with two internal processes referred to as the a-process and b-process. The a-process, or \\"affective\\" response to a stimulus, is the initial emotional response one has and can be pleasant or unpleasant. The b-process is the after reaction and has a lower intensity than the a-process. The a-process is very fast-acting and ends as soon as the stimulus ends or is removed. Unlike the a-process, b-process is much slower in returning to baseline. Concerning the definition of the opponent process theory‚Äîrepeated presentations present habituation‚Äîthe a-process does not necessarily change. It is the b-process that is strengthened instead and rises more quickly to reach the highest intensity, and much slower in attempting to return to baseline after the stimulus is removed. To sum it all up, with the opponent-process theory, repeated presentations of the same stimulus will result in habituation, where subjects show little to no reaction. It is the after-reaction that is much larger and prolonged, than if an initial reaction to a stimulus occurred.Mazur, J. E. (2012). Learning & Behavior (7/E). Pearson. 41‚Äì45.  Relevance to neuropsychiatry  Habituation abnormalities have been repeatedly observed in a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), fragile X syndrome, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette's syndrome (TS), and migraine. In human clinical studies, habituation is most often studied using the acoustic startle reflex; acoustic tones are delivered to participants through headphones and the subsequent eye-blink response is recorded directly by observation or by electromyography (EMG). Depending on the disorder, habituation phenomena have been implicated as a cause, symptom, or therapy. Reduced habituation is the most common habituation phenotype reported across neuropsychiatric disorders although enhanced habituation has been observed in HD and ADHD. It also appears that abnormal habituation is often predictive of symptom severity in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASD,Green, S.A., Hernandez, L., Tottenham, N., Krasileva, K., Bookheimer, S.Y., Dapretto, M., 2015.

Moreover, there are instances where treatments that normalise the habituation-deficit also improve other associated symptoms.Schneider, A., Leigh, M.J., Adams, P., Nanakul, R., Chechi, T., Olichney, J., Hagerman, R., Hessl, D., 2013.

Habit reversal training for children with tourette syndrome: update and review. J. Child Adolesc. Psychiatr. Nurs. 25, 178‚Äì83. doi:10.1111/jcap.12002 although extinction processes may be operating instead. Uses and challenges of the habituation procedure Habituation procedures are used by researchers for many reasons. For example, in a study on aggression in female chimpanzees from a group known as the \\"Kasakela Chimpanzee Community\\", researchers habituated the chimpanzees by repeatedly exposing them to the presence of human beings. Their efforts to habituate the chimpanzees before the field researchers studied the animal's behavior was necessary in order for them to eventually be able to note the natural behavior of the chimpanzees, instead of simply noting chimpanzee behavior as a response to the presence of the researchers. In another study, Mitumba chimpanzees in the Gombe National Park were habituated for at least four years before the introduction of systematic data collection. Researchers also use habituation and dishabituation procedures in the laboratory to study the perceptual and cognitive capabilities of human infants. The presentation of a visual stimulus to an infant elicits looking behavior that habituates with repeated presentations of the stimulus. When changes to the habituated stimulus are made (or a new stimulus is introduced), the looking behavior returns (dishabituates). A recent fMRI study revealed that the presentation of a dishabituating stimulus has an observable, physical effect upon the brain. In one study the mental spatial representations of infants were assessed using the phenomenon of dishabituation. Infants were presented repeatedly with an object in the same position on a table. Once the infants habituated to the object (i.e., spent less time looking at it) either the object was spatially moved while the infant remained at the same place near the table or the object was left in the same place but the infant was moved to the opposite side of the table. In both cases, the spatial relationship between the object and the infant had changed, but only in the former case did the object itself move. Would the infants know the difference? Or would they treat both cases as if the object itself moved? The results revealed a return of looking behavior (dishabituation) when the object's position was changed, but not when the infant's position was changed. Dishabituation indicates that infants perceived a significant change in the stimulus. Therefore, the infants understood when the object itself moved and when it did not. Only when the object itself moved were they interested in it again (dishabituation). When the object remained in the same position as before it was perceived as the same old boring thing (habituation). In general, habituation/dishabituation procedures help researchers determine the way infants perceive their environments. Habitation is a useful primary tool for then assessing mental processes in the stages of infancy. The purpose for these tests, or paradigms records looking time, which is the baseline measurement. Habituation of looking time helps to assess certain child capabilities such as: memory, sensitivity, and helps the baby recognize certain abstract properties. Habituation is also found to be influenced by unchangeable factors such as infant age, gender, and complexity of the stimulus. (Caron & Caron, 1969; Cohen, DeLoache, & Rissman, 1975; Friedman, Nagy, & Carpenter, 1970; Miller, 1972; Wetherford & Cohen, 1973). Though there are various challenges that come with habituation. Some infants have preferences for some stimuli based on their static or dynamic properties. Infant dishabituation also is not perceived as a direct measure for mental processes as well. In previous theories of habituation, an infant's dishabituation was thought to represent their own realization of the remembered stimulus of stimuli. For example: if infants would be dishabituated to a certain color item to a new item, we would know that they remembered the color and compared the two colors for differences. Also, another challenge that comes with habituation is the dichotomy of novelty vs familiar stimuli. If an infant preferred a novel still, this meant the infant observed the new spatial relation of the object, but not the object itself. If an infant preferred familiarity, the infant would notice the pattern of the stimuli, instead of the actual new stimuli. Oakes L. M. (2010). Using Habituation of Looking Time to Assess Mental Processes in Infancy. Journal of cognition and development: official journal of the Cognitive Development Society, 11(3), 255‚Äì268. doi:10.1080/15248371003699977 The habituation/dishabituation procedure is also used to discover the resolution of perceptual systems. For instance, by habituating someone to one stimulus, and then observing responses to similar ones, one can detect the smallest degree of difference that is detectable.

In classical language, special divisors move on the curve in a \\"larger than expected\\" linear system of divisors. The condition to be a special divisor D can be formulated in sheaf cohomology terms, as the non-vanishing of the H1 cohomology of the sheaf of the sections of the invertible sheaf or line bundle associated to D.

Main theorems of Brill‚ÄìNoether theory For a given genus g, the moduli space for curves C of genus g should contain a dense subset parameterizing those curves with the minimum in the way of special divisors.

On 29 January 2006, Faido grew by incorporating the villages of Chiggiogna, Rossura, and Calonico. On 1 April 2012, Faido grew again when it incorporated the former municipalities of Anzonico, Calpiogna, Campello, Cavagnago, Chironico, Mairengo and Osco.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 23 May 2012 It grew again on 10 April 2016 when Sobrio was absorbed into the municipality.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 27 April 2016 History The municipality is first documented in 1171 as Faedo. In German it was previously known as Feit or Pfaid. Crucial for the development of the municipality into a regional center was the location in the middle of the valley and at the foot of the gorge of Mount Piottino. The mountain was a barrier to passenger and goods transport, which required a stop and facilities for travelers. Additionally, under Uri's rule (15th-18th century), it was the capital of the Levantina and a key to Uri's control of the Ticino. The meetings of the local head of the Levantine (parlamento generale) and the Council of the valley community were held in Faido. The former Vicinanza of Faido (based in Mairengo) consisted of three Degagna. During the Middle Ages the church of San Siro in Mairengo (first mentioned in 1171) was the baptistery of the Vicinanza. The village church of S. Andrea in Faido was first mentioned in the 13th Century. Following the fire of 1331, it was rebuilt and in 1579 was elevated to a parish church. It was expanded in 1830. The Chapel of St. Bernardino of Siena from 1459 was under the patronage of the Varesi family, which also owned a six-story tower house. In 1607, a Capuchin monastery was founded, which was for a long time the seat of the Seminary of the Capuchins and cultural center. The monastery school was open to boys from the valley. The monastery complex includes the Church of San Francesco, built in 1608, and rebuilt in 1785/86. Construction of the Gotthard Base Tunnel near Faido The history of the 19th Century in the valley, revolved about the Gotthard road (built 1820-30) and the Gotthard Rail Tunnel (1871‚Äì1881). The railway encouraged the founding various hotels (including the H√¥tel Suisse in 1905) and the spread of crafts and small industries. In 1889, Faido was the first town in Ticino with electric lighting. Like most of the Leventina, many inhabitants emigrated to France, England, Australia and America. However, Faido also experienced an immigration of artisans and the establishment of small industrial enterprises, some of them as branches of government-operated enterprises. Most of these small businesses have since disappeared or moved. Before World War I, the village was, especially with Milanese families, a popular and bustling holiday resort. The Leventiner Hospital S. Croce was built in 1917 on the initiative of the clergy. It is a retirement home since 1992. The current District Hospital was built in 1923 at the request of residents and civic communities of the Levantine. In 1976 Faido fought successfully against the fragmentation of the municipal area by the highway and got a bypass tunnel. In the spring of 2004, the residents voted for incorporating the surrounding municipalities of Chiggiogna, Osco, Mairengo, Calpiogna, Campello, Rossura, Calonico, Anzonico, Cavagnago, and Sobrio. Most of the municipalities rejected the proposition, and the new municipality consists of Faido, Chiggiogna, Rossura, and Calonico. Geography Faido pass up to the Gotthard pass, from 1845 Aerial view by Walter Mittelholzer (1931) Faido has an area, , of . Of this area, or 3.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 9.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 3.1% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.3% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.2% is unproductive land. Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 1.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 1.1%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 1.9% is used for growing crops and 1.5% is used for alpine pastures. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.Altitudine, superficie, secondo il genere di utilizzazione, rilevazione 1992/1997, e densit√† della popolazione, nel 2000 accessed 25 October 2010 The municipality is the district capital and home of the district court of the Leventina.

Different observers may assess subjective criteria differently, and cognitive biases (including preconceptions and assumptions) can affect how a subject is assessed. For example, being aware of a subject‚Äôs disease status may introduce a bias in how the outcome is assessed. Observer bias can also occur when the subject knows they are being examined. When a subject knows they are being observed, it can cause them to act differently from how they normally would, which could interfere with the experiment.Another example examines police work, where police officers change their behavior based on who is watching. Blinded experiments are used to limit observer bias. Observer bias can also be avoided or limited by having researchers work independently of one another.

New Zealand women gained the right to vote in 1893, though were not allowed to stand for the House of Representatives until the election of 1919. McCombs had previously contested elections in 1928 and 1931. Early years McCombs was born in Kaiapoi, North Canterbury, New Zealand. She was one of the nine children of Alice and Daniel Henderson. The family spent some years living in Ashburton, but in about 1882 the family moved to Christchurch. A passion for activism was embedded in her family, as some of her siblings were notable activists themselves. Two of McCombs' sisters, Stella Henderson and Christina Kirk Henderson, were both in the public eye; Stella writing for a prominent New Zealand newspaper, and Christina advocating for the suffrage movement. Stella, Kathleen and Elizabeth (then) Henderson in the 1890s In 1886, her alcoholic father died, leaving her family in financial difficulty for a time. Politics McCombs became interested in socialism through the influence of her elder sisters, who were involved in the Progressive Liberal Association, a small socialist-orientated group. One of the Progressive Liberal Association's goals was to increase the political rights of women. McCombs herself became involved in the Association, and as an extension of this, with the New Zealand Women's Christian Temperance Union, run by prominent New Zealand suffragette Kate Sheppard. McCombs held a number of positions within the Temperance Union throughout her life, including that of national treasurer. In 1903, McCombs married James McCombs, a strong socialist who had also been involved with the Progressive Liberal Association. They were to have two children, and adopted two more. James McCombs was active in left-wing political circles, and was later to become an MP for the Social Democratic Party. When the Labour Party was founded in 1916, he became its first president. At the same time, Elizabeth McCombs was elected to the party's executive, alongside another woman, Sarah Snow. In 1921, McCombs gained election to the Christchurch City Council, being the second woman to do so. She remained a member of the council until 1935, when she chose to step down. During this time, she was also active in a large number of other organisations, including hospital boards and charities. Her work was recognised in 1926, when she was made a Justice of the peace. In the 1928 elections, McCombs stood (unsuccessfully) for the Kaiapoi electorate, as the Labour Party's first female nominee. In the 1931 elections, she contested the seat of Christchurch North, also unsuccessfully. On the death in August 1933 of McCombs' husband James, who had held his parliamentary seat of Lyttelton since 1913, it was suggested that Elizabeth McCombs herself should be the Labour Party's new candidate for the Lyttelton seat. Some members of the party were initially hesitant, but she was eventually selected as the Labour candidate. When the 1933 by-election was held, McCombs won resoundingly: James had been returned by only 32 votes in the 1931 elections, but Elizabeth received a majority of 2600 votes, electing her the first woman Member of Parliament. In a 1926 article in Christchurch newspaper The Press, McCombs was described as being \\"impatient with working people, tending to represent their best interests and not necessarily their opinions. She called a deputation representing the unemployed \\"an illogical crowd\\" when they said they wanted work but criticised having to work for charitable aid.\\"Christchurch Press, 28 October 1926 =Issues= In parliament, McCombs spoke out on a number of issues, many of which involved women's rights and welfare. Among the causes she promoted were: * Equal pay for women. * Changes to unemployment policy, which was more generous towards unemployed men than unemployed women. * Recruitment of women into the police force. Illness and death Increasingly poor health made it difficult for McCombs to participate fully in politics. She died in Christchurch on 7 June 1935 aged 61, less than two years after entering parliament. In 1935, she was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Despite her short career in parliament, she demonstrated that women could successfully seek election, and it was not long before a second woman (Catherine Stewart in 1938, elected for Wellington West) entered parliament. In her Lyttelton electorate, she was succeeded by her son Terry McCombs, who was the Minister of Education in the First Labour Government from 1947 to 1949. Terry McCombs held the Lyttelton seat until 1951, concluding a 38-year family hold on the seat.

In the early days of the university, most of the faculty and students lived on campuses of Tsinghua University and Beijing Institute of Technology before they moved on to their own new campus, which was chosen in May, 1953 and located at the BaiYanZhuang Village, Haidian District, in the western suburb of Beijing. Construction of campus buildings started on June 1, 1953. More than 60,000m2 of buildings were completed within six months. By October 1953, all students and some of the faculty had moved to the new campus and started their daily work and study. Initially, there were two departments with 4 majors: Aeroplane Design and Aeroplane Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engineering, and Engine Design and Engine Technology in the Department of Aeroplane Engine Engineering.

The book was first published in France by Fran√ßois Maspero. An abridged English translation was published in 1970, and an unabridged translation in 2015. The book was influential among intellectuals. Summary The philosopher Louis Althusser and his co-authors ‚Äî the philosopher √âtienne Balibar, the sociologist Roger Establet, the philosopher Jacques Ranci√®re, and the critic Pierre Macherey ‚Äî discuss Karl Marx's Das Kapital (1867‚Äì1883) and subjects such as the labor theory of value, dialectical materialism, and historical materialism. Ranci√®re notes that his contribution builds on Althusser's For Marx (1965). Publication history Reading Capital was first published in French by Fran√ßois Maspero in 1965. An abridged French Fran√ßois Maspero edition followed in 1968. An abridged Italian translation was also published. An abridged English translation by Ben Brewster was published in 1970 by New Left Books. An unabridged English translation by Ben Brewster and David Fernbach was published in 2015 by Verso Books. Reception Together with Althusser's For Marx (1965), Reading Capital drew Althusser to the attention of French intellectuals and attracted a significant international readership. The appearance of Reading Capital and For Marx in English translation influenced the development of Marxist thought in the Anglophone world throughout the 1970s. The philosopher Roger Scruton criticized Althusser for falsely claiming that Das Kapital had been ignored by bourgeois economists, ignoring criticism of the labor theory of value, and treating Marx's work as though it were beyond criticism. He also described Reading Capital as pretentious and obscure. The Marxian economist Harry Cleaver wrote that Althusser and his co-authors provided one of the most politically influential of the philosophical reinterpretations of Das Kapital that were made by Marxists in the 1960s and 1970s. However, he considered their influence regrettable, writing that in For Marx and Reading Capital, Althusser's aim was to revitalize dialectical materialism \\"as an ideology to mediate the widely discredited political practices of the French Communist Party.\\" He accused Althusser of ignoring working class struggles in favor of an abstract \\"science of history\\", and noted that Althusser himself admitted that Reading Capital largely ignored the class struggle. William S. Lewis described Reading Capital as the culmination of the rereading of Marx that Althusser began in 1953. He considered it a theoretically sophisticated text. However, he suggested that the difficulty of the work supported the charge that Althusser aspired to \\"Leninist vanguardism\\" and wanted \\"a small, theoretically sophisticated cadre\\" to \\"direct the revolution\\", and expressed agreement with the historian Eric Hobsbawm's view that the book showed that Althusser was an \\"extremely selective reader of Marx.\\" The economist Alain Lipietz further pointed out that, while Reading Capital helped to disengage French Marxism from an oversimplification, determinism and mechanism inherited from the Stalinist period, it also obscured and censored the first chapter of Das Kapital, in which Marx analyzed the relationship of commodity and money.

Mental imagery can sometimes produce the same effects as would be produced by the behavior or experience imagined. The nature of these experiences, what makes them possible, and their function (if any) have long been subjects of research and controversy in philosophy, psychology, cognitive science, and, more recently, neuroscience. As contemporary researchers use the expression, mental images or imagery can comprise information from any source of sensory input; one may experience auditory images,Reisberg, 1992 olfactory images,Bensafi et al., 2003 and so forth. However, the majority of philosophical and scientific investigations of the topic focus upon visual mental imagery. It has sometimes been assumed that, like humans, some types of animals are capable of experiencing mental images.Aristotle: On the Soul III.3 428a Due to the fundamentally introspective nature of the phenomenon, there is little to no evidence either for or against this view. Philosophers such as George Berkeley and David Hume, and early experimental psychologists such as Wilhelm Wundt and William James, understood ideas in general to be mental images. Today it is very widely believed that much imagery functions as mental representations (or mental models), playing an important role in memory and thinking.Pavio, 1986Egan, 1992Barsalou, 1999Prinz, 2002 William Brant (2013, p. 12) traces the scientific use of the phrase \\"mental images\\" back to John Tyndall's 1870 speech called the \\"Scientific Use of the Imagination\\". Some have gone so far as to suggest that images are best understood to be, by definition, a form of inner, mental or neural representation;Block, 1983Kosslyn, 1983 in the case of hypnagogic and hypnapompic imagery, it is not representational at all. Others reject the view that the image experience may be identical with (or directly caused by) any such representation in the mind or the brain,Sartre, 1940Ryle, 1949Skinner, 1974Thomas, 1999Bartolomeo, 2002Bennett & Hacker, 2003 but do not take account of the non-representational forms of imagery. The mind's eye The notion of a \\"mind's eye\\" goes back at least to Cicero's reference to mentis oculi during his discussion of the orator's appropriate use of simile.Cicero, De Oratore, Liber III: XLI: 163. In this discussion, Cicero observed that allusions to \\"the Syrtis of his patrimony\\" and \\"the Charybdis of his possessions\\" involved similes that were \\"too far-fetched\\"; and he advised the orator to, instead, just speak of \\"the rock\\" and \\"the gulf\\" (respectively)‚Äîon the grounds that \\"the eyes of the mind are more easily directed to those objects which we have seen, than to those which we have only heard\\".J.S. (trans. and ed.), Cicero on Oratory and Orators, Harper & Brothers, (New York), 1875: Book III, C.XLI, p. 239. The concept of \\"the mind's eye\\" first appeared in English in Chaucer's (c. 1387) Man of Law's Tale in his Canterbury Tales, where he tells us that one of the three men dwelling in a castle was blind, and could only see with \\"the eyes of his mind\\"; namely, those eyes \\"with which all men see after they have become blind\\".The Man of Laws Tale, lines 550‚Äì553.  Physical basis  The biological foundation of the mind's eye is not fully understood. Studies using fMRI have shown that the lateral geniculate nucleus and the V1 area of the visual cortex are activated during mental imagery tasks.Imagery of famous faces: effects of memory and attention revealed by fMRI , A.

Ratey, , at p. 107. The rudiments of a biological basis for the mind's eye is found in the deeper portions of the brain below the neocortex, or where the center of perception exists. The thalamus has been found to be discrete to other components in that it processes all forms of perceptional data relayed from both lower and higher components of the brain. Damage to this component can produce permanent perceptual damage, however when damage is inflicted upon the cerebral cortex, the brain adapts to neuroplasticity to amend any occlusions for perception . It can be thought that the neocortex is a sophisticated memory storage warehouse in which data received as an input from sensory systems are compartmentalized via the cerebral cortex. This would essentially allow for shapes to be identified, although given the lack of filtering input produced internally, one may as a consequence, hallucinate‚Äîessentially seeing something that isn't received as an input externally but rather internal (i.e. an error in the filtering of segmented sensory data from the cerebral cortex may result in one seeing, feeling, hearing or experiencing something that is inconsistent with reality). Not all people have the same internal perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some people are able to perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of hallucinogenic drugs increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts. Furthermore, the pineal gland is a hypothetical candidate for producing a mind's eye Rick Strassman and others have postulated that during near-death experiences (NDEs) and dreaming , the gland might secrete a hallucinogenic chemical N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to produce internal visuals when external sensory data is occluded.Rick Strassman, DMT: The Spirit Molecule: A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences, 320 pages, Park Street Press, 2001, However, this hypothesis has yet to be fully supported with neurochemical evidence and plausible mechanism for DMT production. The condition where a person lacks mental imagery is called aphantasia. The term was first suggested in a 2015 study. Common examples of mental images include daydreaming and the mental visualization that occurs while reading a book. Another is of the pictures summoned by athletes during training or before a competition, outlining each step they will take to accomplish their goal.Plessinger, Annie. The Effects of Mental Imagery on Athletic Performance. The Mental Edge. 12/20/13. Web. http://www.vanderbilt.edu When a musician hears a song, he or she can sometimes \\"see\\" the song notes in their head, as well as hear them with all their tonal qualities. This is considered different from an after-effect, such as an afterimage. Calling up an image in our minds can be a voluntary act, so it can be characterized as being under various degrees of conscious control. According to psychologist and cognitive scientist Steven Pinker,Pinker, S. (1999). How the Mind Works. New York: Oxford University Press. our experiences of the world are represented in our minds as mental images. These mental images can then be associated and compared with others, and can be used to synthesize completely new images. In this view, mental images allow us to form useful theories of how the world works by formulating likely sequences of mental images in our heads without having to directly experience that outcome. Whether other creatures have this capability is debatable. There are several theories as to how mental images are formed in the mind. These include the dual-code theory, the propositional theory, and the functional-equivalency hypothesis. The dual-code theory, created by Allan Paivio in 1971, is the theory that we use two separate codes to represent information in our brains: image codes and verbal codes. Image codes are things like thinking of a picture of a dog when you are thinking of a dog, whereas a verbal code would be to think of the word \\"dog\\".Paivio, Allan. 1941. Dual Coding Theory. Theories of Learning in Educational Psychology. (2013). Web. Another example is the difference between thinking of abstract words such as justice or love and thinking of concrete words like elephant or chair. When abstract words are thought of, it is easier to think of them in terms of verbal codes‚Äîfinding words that define them or describe them. With concrete words, it is often easier to use image codes and bring up a picture of a human or chair in your mind rather than words associated or descriptive of them. The propositional theory involves storing images in the form of a generic propositional code that stores the meaning of the concept not the image itself. The propositional codes can either be descriptive of the image or symbolic. They are then transferred back into verbal and visual code to form the mental image.Mental Imaging Theories. 2013. Web. http://faculty.mercer.edu The functional-equivalency hypothesis is that mental images are \\"internal representations\\" that work in the same way as the actual perception of physical objects.Eysenck, M. W. (2012). Fundamentals of Cognition, 2nd ed. New York: Psychology Press. In other words, the picture of a dog brought to mind when the word dog is read is interpreted in the same way as if the person looking at an actual dog before them. Research has occurred to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show a multitude of results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in Brodmann area 17. Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial Brodmann area 40. Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found to occur in the dorsolateral prefrontal area, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basal ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined tactile stimulus). Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form. A meta- analysis of neuroimagery studies revealed significant activation of the bilateral dorsal parietal, interior insula, and left inferior frontal regions of the brain. Imagery has been thought to cooccur with perception; however, participants with damaged sense-modality receptors can sometimes perform imagery of said modality receptors. Neuroscience with imagery has been used to communicate with seemingly unconscious individuals through fMRI activation of different neural correlates of imagery, demanding further study into low quality consciousness. A study on one patient with one occipital lobe removed found the horizontal area of their visual mental image was reduced. Neural substrates of visual imagery Visual imagery is the ability to create mental representations of things, people, and places that are absent from an individual‚Äôs visual field. This ability is crucial to problem-solving tasks, memory, and spatial reasoning.Dijkstra, N., Bosch, S. E., & van Gerven, M. A. J. ‚ÄúVividness of Visual Imagery Depends on the Neural Overlap with Perception in Visual Areas‚Äù, The Journal of Neuroscience, 37(5), 1367 LP-1373. (2017). Neuroscientists have found that imagery and perception share many of the same neural substrates, or areas of the brain that function similarly during both imagery and perception, such as the visual cortex and higher visual areas. Kosslyn and colleagues (1999)Kosslyn, S. M., Pascual-Leone, A., Felician, O., Camposano, S., Keenan, J. P., L., W., ‚Ä¶ Alpert. ‚ÄúThe Role of Area 17 in Visual Imagery: Convergent Evidence from PET and rTMS‚Äù, Science, 284(5411), 167 LP-170, (1999). showed that the early visual cortex, Area 17 and Area 18/19, is activated during visual imagery. They found that inhibition of these areas through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) resulted in impaired visual perception and imagery. Furthermore, research conducted with lesioned patients has revealed that visual imagery and visual perception have the same representational organization. This has been concluded from patients in which impaired perception also experience visual imagery deficits at the same level of the mental representation. Behrmann and colleagues (1992) describe a patient C.K., who provided evidence challenging the view that visual imagery and visual perception rely on the same representational system. C.K. was a 33-year old man with visual object agnosia acquired after a vehicular accident. This deficit prevented him from being able to recognize objects and copy objects fluidly. Surprisingly, his ability to draw accurate objects from memory indicated his visual imagery was intact and normal. Furthermore, C.K. successfully performed other tasks requiring visual imagery for judgment of size, shape, color, and composition. These findings conflict with previous research as they suggest there is a partial dissociation between visual imagery and visual perception. C.K. exhibited a perceptual deficit that was not associated with a corresponding deficit in visual imagery, indicating that these two processes have systems for mental representations that may not be mediated entirely by the same neural substrates. Schlegel and colleagues (2013)Schlegel, A., Kohler, P. J., Fogelson, S. V, Alexander, P., Konuthula, D., & Tse, P. U. ‚ÄúNetwork structure and dynamics of the mental workspace‚Äù, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 110(40), 16277 LP-16282. (2013). conducted a functional MRI analysis of regions activated during manipulation of visual imagery. They identified 11 bilateral cortical and subcortical regions that exhibited increased activation when manipulating a visual image compared to when the visual image was just maintained. These regions included the occipital lobe and ventral stream areas, two parietal lobe regions, the posterior parietal cortex and the precuneus lobule, and three frontal lobe regions, the frontal eye fields, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the prefrontal cortex. Due to their suspected involvement in working memory and attention, the authors propose that these parietal and prefrontal regions, and occipital regions, are part of a network involved in mediating the manipulation of visual imagery. These results suggest a top-down activation of visual areas in visual imagery.Kolb, B., & Whishaw, I. Q. (2015). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. New York. Worth Publishers. Using Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) to determine the connectivity of cortical networks, Ishai et al. (2010)Ishai, A. ‚ÄúSeeing faces and objects with the \\"mind's eye‚Äù\\", Archives Italiennes de Biologie, 148(1):1‚Äì9. (2010). demonstrated that activation of the network mediating visual imagery is initiated by prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex activity. Generation of objects from memory resulted in initial activation of the prefrontal and the posterior parietal areas, which then activate earlier visual areas through backward connectivity. Activation of the prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex has also been found to be involved in retrieval of object representations from long-term memory, their maintenance in working memory, and attention during visual imagery. Thus, Ishai et al. suggest that the network mediating visual imagery is composed of attentional mechanisms arising from the posterior parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Vividness of visual imagery is a crucial component of an individual‚Äôs ability to perform cognitive tasks requiring imagery. Vividness of visual imagery varies not only between individuals but also within individuals. Dijkstra and colleagues (2017) found that the variation in vividness of visual imagery is dependent on the degree to which the neural substrates of visual imagery overlap with those of visual perception. They found that overlap between imagery and perception in the entire visual cortex, the parietal precuneus lobule, the right parietal cortex, and the medial frontal cortex predicted the vividness of a mental representation. The activated regions beyond the visual areas are believed to drive the imagery-specific processes rather than the visual processes shared with perception. It has been suggested that the precuneus contributes to vividness by selecting important details for imagery. The medial frontal cortex is suspected to be involved in the retrieval and integration of information from the parietal and visual areas during working memory and visual imagery. The right parietal cortex appears to be important in attention, visual inspection, and stabilization of mental representations. Thus, the neural substrates of visual imagery and perception overlap in areas beyond the visual cortex and the degree of this overlap in these areas correlates with the vividness of mental representations during imagery. Philosophical ideas Mental images are an important topic in classical and modern philosophy, as they are central to the study of knowledge. In the Republic, Book VII, Plato has Socrates present the Allegory of the Cave: a prisoner, bound and unable to move, sits with his back to a fire watching the shadows cast on the cave wall in front of him by people carrying objects behind his back. These people and the objects they carry are representations of real things in the world. Unenlightened man is like the prisoner, explains Socrates, a human being making mental images from the sense data that he experiences. The eighteenth-century philosopher Bishop George Berkeley proposed similar ideas in his theory of idealism. Berkeley stated that reality is equivalent to mental images--our mental images are not a copy of another material reality but that reality itself. Berkeley, however, sharply distinguished between the images that he considered to constitute the external world, and the images of individual imagination. According to Berkeley, only the latter are considered \\"mental imagery\\" in the contemporary sense of the term. The eighteenth century British writer Dr. Samuel Johnson criticized idealism. When asked what he thought about idealism, he is alleged to have replied \\"I refute it thus!\\" as he kicked a large rock and his leg rebounded. His point was that the idea that the rock is just another mental image and has no material existence of its own is a poor explanation of the painful sense data he had just experienced. David Deutsch addresses Johnson's objection to idealism in The Fabric of Reality when he states that, if we judge the value of our mental images of the world by the quality and quantity of the sense data that they can explain, then the most valuable mental image-- or theory--that we currently have is that the world has a real independent existence and that humans have successfully evolved by building up and adapting patterns of mental images to explain it. This is an important idea in scientific thought. Critics of scientific realism ask how the inner perception of mental images actually occurs. This is sometimes called the \\"homunculus problem\\" (see also the mind's eye). The problem is similar to asking how the images you see on a computer screen exist in the memory of the computer. To scientific materialism, mental images and the perception of them must be brain-states. According to critics, scientific realists cannot explain where the images and their perceiver exist in the brain. To use the analogy of the computer screen, these critics argue that cognitive science and psychology have been unsuccessful in identifying either the component in the brain (i.e., \\"hardware\\") or the mental processes that store these images (i.e. \\"software\\"). In experimental psychology Cognitive psychologists and (later) cognitive neuroscientists have empirically tested some of the philosophical questions related to whether and how the human brain uses mental imagery in cognition. rightOne theory of the mind that was examined in these experiments was the \\"brain as serial computer\\" philosophical metaphor of the 1970s. Psychologist Zenon Pylyshyn theorized that the human mind processes mental images by decomposing them into an underlying mathematical proposition. Roger Shepard and Jacqueline Metzler challenged that view by presenting subjects with 2D line drawings of groups of 3D block \\"objects\\" and asking them to determine whether that \\"object\\" is the same as a second figure, some of which rotations of the first \\"object\\".Shepard and Metzler 1971 Shepard and Metzler proposed that if we decomposed and then mentally re-imaged the objects into basic mathematical propositions, as the then-dominant view of cognition \\"as a serial digital computer\\"Gardner 1987 assumed, then it would be expected that the time it took to determine whether the object is the same or not would be independent of how much the object had been rotated. Shepard and Metzler found the opposite: a linear relationship between the degree of rotation in the mental imagery task and the time it took participants to reach their answer. This mental rotation finding implied that the human mind‚Äîand the human brain‚Äîmaintains and manipulates mental images as topographic and topological wholes, an implication that was quickly put to test by psychologists. Stephen Kosslyn and colleaguesKosslyn 1995; see also 1994 showed in a series of neuroimaging experiments that the mental image of objects like the letter \\"F\\" are mapped, maintained and rotated as an image-like whole in areas of the human visual cortex. Moreover, Kosslyn's work showed that there are considerable similarities between the neural mappings for imagined stimuli and perceived stimuli. The authors of these studies concluded that, while the neural processes they studied rely on mathematical and computational underpinnings, the brain also seems optimized to handle the sort of mathematics that constantly computes a series of topologically-based images rather than calculating a mathematical model of an object. Recent studies in neurology and neuropsychology on mental imagery have further questioned the \\"mind as serial computer\\" theory, arguing instead that human mental imagery manifests both visually and kinesthetically. For example, several studies have provided evidence that people are slower at rotating line drawings of objects such as hands in directions incompatible with the joints of the human body,Parsons 1987; 2003 and that patients with painful, injured arms are slower at mentally rotating line drawings of the hand from the side of the injured arm.Schwoebel et al. 2001 Some psychologists, including Kosslyn, have argued that such results occur because of interference in the brain between distinct systems in the brain that process the visual and motor mental imagery. Subsequent neuroimaging studiesKosslyn et al. 2001 showed that the interference between the motor and visual imagery system could be induced by having participants physically handle actual 3D blocks glued together to form objects similar to those depicted in the line-drawings. Amorim et al. have shown that, when a cylindrical \\"head\\" was added to Shepard and Metzler's line drawings of 3D block figures, participants were quicker and more accurate at solving mental rotation problems.Amorim et al. 2006 They argue that motoric embodiment is not just \\"interference\\" that inhibits visual mental imagery but is capable of facilitating mental imagery. As cognitive neuroscience approaches to mental imagery continued, research expanded beyond questions of serial versus parallel or topographic processing to questions of the relationship between mental images and perceptual representations. Both brain imaging (fMRI and ERP) and studies of neuropsychological patients have been used to test the hypothesis that a mental image is the reactivation, from memory, of brain representations normally activated during the perception of an external stimulus. In other words, if perceiving an apple activates contour and location and shape and color representations in the brain‚Äôs visual system, then imagining an apple activates some or all of these same representations using information stored in memory. Early evidence for this idea came from neuropsychology. Patients with brain damage that impairs perception in specific ways, for example by damaging shape or color representations, seem to generally to have impaired mental imagery in similar ways. Studies of brain function in normal human brains support this same conclusion, showing activity in the brain‚Äôs visual areas while subjects imagined visual objects and scenes. The previously mentioned and numerous related studies have led to a relative consensus within cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy on the neural status of mental images. In general, researchers agree that, while there is no homunculus inside the head viewing these mental images, our brains do form and maintain mental images as image-like wholes.Rohrer 2006 The problem of exactly how these images are stored and manipulated within the human brain, in particular within language and communication, remains a fertile area of study. One of the longest-running research topics on the mental image has basis on the fact that people report large individual differences in the vividness of their images. Special questionnaires have been developed to assess such differences, including the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ) developed by David Marks. Laboratory studies have suggested that the subjectively reported variations in imagery vividness are associated with different neural states within the brain and also different cognitive competences such as the ability to accurately recall information presented in picturesMarks, 1973 Rodway, Gillies and Schepman used a novel long-term change detection task to determine whether participants with low and high vividness scores on the VVIQ2 showed any performance differences.Rodway, Gillies and Schepman 2006 Rodway et al. found that high vividness participants were significantly more accurate at detecting salient changes to pictures compared to low-vividness participants.Rodway et al. 2006 This replicated an earlier study.Gur and Hilgard 1975 Recent studies have found that individual differences in VVIQ scores can be used to predict changes in a person's brain while visualizing different activities.Cui et al. 2007 Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study the association between early visual cortex activity relative to the whole brain while participants visualized themselves or another person bench pressing or stair climbing. Reported image vividness correlates significantly with the relative fMRI signal in the visual cortex. Thus, individual differences in the vividness of visual imagery can be measured objectively. Logie, Pernet, Buonocore and Della Sala (2011) used behavioural and fMRI data for mental rotation from individuals reporting vivid and poor imagery on the VVIQ. Groups differed in brain activation patterns suggesting that the groups performed the same tasks in different ways. These findings help to explain the lack of association previously reported between VVIQ scores and mental rotation performance. Training and learning styles Some educational theorists have drawn from the idea of mental imagery in their studies of learning styles. Proponents of these theories state that people often have learning processes that emphasize visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems of experience. According to these theorists, teaching in multiple overlapping sensory systems benefits learning, and they encourage teachers to use content and media that integrates well with the visual, auditory, and kinesthetic systems whenever possible. Educational researchers have examined whether the experience of mental imagery affects the degree of learning. For example, imagining playing a five-finger piano exercise (mental practice) resulted in a significant improvement in performance over no mental practice‚Äîthough not as significant as that produced by physical practice. The authors of the study stated that \\"mental practice alone seems to be sufficient to promote the modulation of neural circuits involved in the early stages of motor skill learning\\".Pascual-Leone et al. 1995 Visualization and the Himalayan traditions In general, Vajrayana Buddhism, B√∂n, and Tantra utilize sophisticated visualization or imaginal (in the language of Jean Houston of Transpersonal Psychology) processes in the thoughtform construction of the yidam sadhana, kye-rim, and dzog-rim modes of meditation and in the yantra, thangka, and mandala traditions, where holding the fully realized form in the mind is a prerequisite prior to creating an 'authentic' new art work that will provide a sacred support or foundation for deity.The Dalai Lama at MIT (2006)Mental Imagery  Substitution effects  Mental imagery can act as a substitute for the imagined experience: Imagining an experience can evoke similar cognitive, physiological, and/or behavioral consequences as having the corresponding experience in reality. At least four classes of such effects have been documented. # Imagined experiences are attributed evidentiary value like physical evidence. # Mental practice can instantiate the same performance benefits as physical practice. # Imagined consumption of a food can reduce its actual consumption. # Imagined goal achievement can reduce motivation for actual goal achievement.

He was also the Prince of Grodno (1370‚Äì1382), Prince of Lutsk (1387‚Äì1389), and the postulated king of the Hussites. In modern Lithuania, Vytautas is revered as a national hero and was an important figure in the national rebirth in the 19th century. Vytautas is a popular male given name in Lithuania. In commemoration of the 500-year anniversary of his death, Vytautas Magnus University was named after him. Monuments in his honour were built in many towns in the independent Lithuania during the interwar period from 1918 to 1939. It is known that Vytautas himself knew and spoke in the Lithuanian language with Jogaila. Struggle for power =1377‚Äì1384= Seal of Vytautas, 14-15th centuries Vytautas' uncle Algirdas had been Grand Duke of Lithuania until his death in 1377. Algirdas and Vytautas' father Kƒôstutis had ruled jointly in the form of diarchy, with Algirdas governing the east and Kƒôstutis the west, primarily responsible for defense against the Teutonic Order. Algirdas was succeeded by his son Jogaila, and a struggle for power ensued. In 1380, Jogaila signed the secret Treaty of Dovydi≈°kƒós with the Teutonic Order against Kƒôstutis. When Kƒôstutis discovered this in 1381, he seized Vilnius, imprisoned Jogaila, and made himself Grand Duke. However, Jogaila escaped and raised an army against Kƒôstutis. The two sides confronted each other but never engaged in battle. Kƒôstutis was ready to negotiate, but he and Vytautas were arrested and transported to Kreva Castle. One week later, Kƒôstutis was found dead. Whether he died of natural causes or was murdered is still a matter of debate. Vytautas and Kƒôstutis imprisoned by Jogaila. Painting by Wojciech Gerson In 1382, Vytautas escaped from Kreva and he sought help from the Teutonic Order, who were negotiating with Jogaila at the time. Jogaila and the Order agreed to the Treaty of Dubysa, by which Jogaila promised to accept Christianity, become an ally of the Order, and give the Order part of Samogitia up to the Dubysa River. However, the treaty was never ratified and in summer 1383, the war between Jogaila and the Order resumed. Vytautas was baptised as a Catholic, receiving the name of Wigand (Lithuanian: Vygandas). Vytautas participated in several raids against Jogaila. In January 1384, Vytautas promised to cede part of Samogitia to the Teutonic Order, up to the Nevƒó≈æis River in return for recognition as Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, in July of the same year, Vytautas broke with the Order and reconciled with Jogaila. He then burned three important Teutonic castles, and regained all Kƒôstutis' lands, except for Trakai. =1385‚Äì1392= Poland and Lithuania, 1386‚Äì1434 In 1385, Jogaila concluded the Union of Krewo with Poland, under which he married Jadwiga of Poland and became King of Poland as W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço. Vytautas participated in the Union and in 1386 was re-baptised as a Catholic, receiving the name Alexander. Jogaila left his brother Skirgaila as regent in Lithuania. However, Skirgaila was unpopular with the people and Vytautas saw an opportunity to become Grand Duke. In 1389, he attacked Vilnius but failed. In early 1390, Vytautas again allied with the Teutonic Order through the Treaty of K√∂nigsberg (1390). Vytautas had to confirm his agreement of 1384, and cede Samogitia to the Order. His army now invaded Lithuania. Also, to gain more influence, Vytautas married his only daughter Sophia to Vasili I of Russia in 1391. The Polish nobles were unhappy that their new king spent too much time on Lithuanian affairs. It was clear that the war could continue for years and would not bring any benefit to Poland. In 1392, Jogaila sent Henry of Masovia with an offer to make Vytautas regent instead of Skirgaila. Vytautas accepted and again broke with the Order. He burned three Teutonic castles and returned to Vilnius. Jogaila and Vytautas signed the Astrava Treaty in which Vytautas recovered all Kƒôstutis' lands, including Trakai, and was given more. Vytautas would rule Lithuania in the name of Jogaila. After Vytautas' death, all his lands and powers would revert to Jogaila. Grand Duke of Lithuania =Policy towards the East= Privilege to Vilnius Cathedral issued by Vytautas in Vilnius on February 16, 1410 (Latin language) Vytautas continued Algirdas' vision to control as many Ruthenian lands as possible. Much of the territory was already under the Grand Duke's rule, but the rest was controlled by the Mongols. Tokhtamysh, Khan of the Golden Horde, sought help from Vytautas when he was removed from the throne in 1395 after his defeat by Timur. An agreement was reached that Vytautas would help Tokhtamysh to regain power, and the Horde would cede more lands to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in return. In 1398, Vytautas' army attacked a part of the Crimea and built a castle there. Now Lithuania spanned from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. A number of Tatar captives were brought to ethnic Lithuania. Continuing attempts on the part of Poland to subordinate Lithuania drove Vytautas for the third time into the arms of the Order, and by the Treaty of Salynas in October 1398, Vytautas, who now styled himself , ceded his ancestral province of Samogitia to the knights, formed an alliance with them for the conquest and partition of Pskov and Novgorod the Great. Inspired by his successful campaign against Timur, Vytautas and Jogaila won support from Pope Boniface IX for organising a crusade against the Mongols. This political move also demonstrated that Lithuania had fully accepted Christianity and was defending the faith on its own, and that the Teutonic Knights had no further basis for attacks against Lithuania. The campaign resulted in a crushing defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. Over twenty princes, including two brothers of Jogaila, were killed, and Vytautas himself barely escaped alive. This came as a shock to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland. A number of territories revolted against Vytautas, and Smolensk was retaken by its hereditary ruler, George of Smolensk, and not re- conquered by Lithuanians until 1404. Vytautas waged a war in 1406‚Äì1408 against his son-in-law Vasili I of Moscow and ≈†vitrigaila, a brother of Jogaila who with the support of the Teutonic Order had declared himself grand prince. A major stand-off between the two armies ended without a battle in the Treaty of Ugra, by which Velikiy Novgorod was granted to Jogaila's brother Lengvenis, and the important city of Pskov to Jogaila's envoy Jerzy Nos, the latter settlement a clear violation of the treaty of RaciƒÖ≈º. The war with Muscovy ended in December 1408, on terms that made further conflict with the Teutonic Order inevitable, despite Hermann II of Celje's attempt to negotiate a solution. =Wars against the Teutonic Order= Vytautas the Great as shown on Jan Matejko's oil painting of the Battle of Grunwald Vytautas the Great Monument in Kaunas In the Treaty of Salynas Vytautas had transferred ≈Ωemaitija Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights. ≈Ωemaitija/Samogitia was especially important for the Order because it separated the Teutonic Knights, based in Prussia, from the Livonian Order, based in Latvia. The two orders desired to unite and form a mighty force. However, the knights ruled ≈Ωemaitija for only three years, because on March 13, 1401, the Samogitians, supported by Vytautas, rebelled and burned two castles. The knights received support from ≈†vitrigaila, brother of Jogaila, who desired to take Vytautas' title. In 1404 Peace of RaciƒÖ≈º was signed, which in essence repeated the Treaty of Salynas: ≈Ωemaitija/Samogitia was transferred to the Teutonic Knights. Poland promised not to support Lithuania in case of another war. The knights promised to support Vytautas in the east and not to support any Gediminid who could have claims to the title of Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, the treaty did not solve the problems, and all the parties prepared for war. In 1408, Vytautas reached peace in the east and returned to Samogitian matters. In 1409 the second Samogitian uprising against the Teutonic Knights began, as the rebels burned Skirsnemunƒó castle. Both Poland and Lithuania supported the rebels. Vytautas gathered a large army from 18 lands under his control. The army joined Polish forces and advanced towards the Teutonic headquarters at the castle of Marienburg (present-day Malbork). In 1410, Vytautas himself commanded the forces of the Grand Duchy in the Battle of Grunwald, also called the Battle of ≈Ωalgiris (Lithuanian) or Tannenberg (German). The battle ended in a decisive Polish-Lithuanian victory. Even though the siege of Marienburg was unsuccessful, the Teutonic Knights never regained their strength and from then on posed a reduced threat to Poland-Lithuania. From now on, Poland- Lithuania began to be regarded in the west as a great power, and Vytautas stood in high favour with the Roman curia. As a result of the Peace of Thorn of 1411, Vytautas received ≈Ωemaitija (Samogitia) for his lifetime. However, the parties could not agree on the border. Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, agreed to mediate the dispute. In 1413, it was declared that the whole right bank of the Nemunas (Neman River) was ≈Ωemaitija and therefore belonged to Lithuania. The Teutonic Knights disagreed and a new war started in 1414. The war lasted for just a few months, and the dispute was brought to the Council of Constance. Even though the dispute was not resolved, the Samogitians had a chance to present their case to the leaders of Europe. It is seen as an important event in the diplomatic history of Lithuania. Several other mediation attempts failed, and yet another war with the Teutonic Order started in 1422. After several months of fighting, the Treaty of Lake Melno was signed. ≈Ωemaitija/Samogitia was returned to Lithuania in perpetuity, while the city of Memel (present-day Klaipƒóda) and surrounding territories stayed with the Order. This border, as established by the treaty, remained stable for some 500 years until the Memel Territory dispute of 1923. With peace established, Vytautas could now concentrate on reforms and the relationship with Poland. =Relationship with Poland= In 1399 Jadwiga of Poland and her newborn died in childbirth. Jogaila's power in Poland was jeopardised as he was a foreigner king with no other ties to the throne but his wife. Also, the defeat at Vorskla forced a re-evaluation of the relationship between Poland and Lithuania. The result was the Union of Vilnius and Radom in 1401. Vytautas was granted wide autonomy, but after his death the title and powers of Grand Duke of Lithuania were to be transferred to the king of Poland. In case Jagie≈Ç≈Ço died first without an heir, the Polish nobility agreed not to elect a new king without consulting Vytautas. The unique feature of this union was that the Lithuanian nobility presented their own document: for the first time somebody other than dukes played a role in the state matters. Church of Vytautas the Great. Built around 1400 in Kaunas Vytautas was one of the creators of the Union of Horod≈Ço with Poland in 1413. According to the act of the union, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to retain a separate Grand Duke and its own parliament. At the same time both the Polish and Lithuanian Sejms were to discuss all the important matters jointly. This union was important culturally as well as politically because it granted Lithuanian Christian nobles the same rights as the Polish szlachta. This act did not include Orthodox nobles. This paved the way for more contacts and cooperation between the nobles of Poland and of Lithuania. In January 1429, at the Congress of Lutsk it was proposed by Sigismund, king of Hungary, that Vytautas should be crowned King of Lithuania. It resulted in a great crisis between Vytuatas, king W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Polish nobles. The envoys who were transporting documents supporting Vytautas coronation and proposing alliance between Lithuania, Hungary and Teutonic Order were stopped at Polish-Lithuanian border in the autumn of 1430.Frost 2015, p. 148 Vytautas died in the Trakai Island Castle, ending the whole affair. He was buried in the Cathedral of Vilnius. The knowledge about his remains has been lost. According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, Vytautas \\"was certainly the most imposing personality of his day in Eastern Europe, and his martial valour was combined with statesmanlike foresight.\\" Vytautas the Great watch tower in Kherson, Ukraine =Reforms= Litas commemorative coin dedicated to Vytautas the Great Vytautas backed the economic development of his state and introduced many reforms. Under his rule the Grand Duchy of Lithuania gradually became more centralised, as local princes with dynastic ties to the throne were replaced by the governors loyal to Vytautas. The governors were rich landowners who formed the basis for the Lithuanian nobility. During Vytautas' rule, the influential Radvila (Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç) and Go≈°tautas families began their rise. In 1398, Vytautas brought over families of the Karaim (388 families) and Tatar peoples. Their principal role was to guard the castle and the bridges, but they also served as translators, farmers, traders, and diplomats. He retains a very high reputation among them, with the anniversary of his death being officially celebrated in 1930 in the kenesa in Vilnius. Family Vytautas beside his uncle Algirdas on the Millennium of Russia in Veliky Novgorod. Born in 1350 in the castle of present-day Old Trakai (Senieji Trakai), Vytautas was the son of Kƒôstutis and his wife Birutƒó. Vytautas was a cousin and childhood friend of Jogaila (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço), who became King of Poland in 1386. Around 1370, he married Anna, who gave birth to Sophia of Lithuania. Sophia was married to Vasily I, Grand Prince of Moscow, and mother and regent to their son Vasili II. After Anna's death in 1418, Vytautas married her niece Juliana Olshanska, daughter of Ivan Olshanski who outlived him. Because of the relationship between the two women, the Bishop of Vilnius was unwilling to perform the ceremony without a papal dispensation; however, Jan Kropid≈Ço did not have such scruples and married them on 13 November 1418. According to the 16th century Bychowiec Chronicle, his first wife was Maria ≈Åukomska, however, this is not confirmed by other sources. Ancestry In fiction Vytautas appears in several works of fiction dealing with the Polish-Lithuanian conflict with the Teutonic Order. He appears in the narrative poem Konrad Wallenrod by Adam Mickiewicz. He was portrayed by J√≥zef Kostecki in Knights of the Teutonic Order, the 1960 adaptation of the famous novel by Henryk Sienkiewicz. In 2014, a short animation was produced by \\"Four Directions of Fairy Tales\\" (Cztery Strony Bajek) in association with the Association of Polish Karaims, portraying the Karaim story of Vytautas and his magic horse, with voiceovers in several languages, including Karaim, Polish, English, and Lithuanian.English version on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpGQ5USWVOA In the video game Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Vytautas featured as a cavalry hero.

His second feature Goodbye Pork Pie (1981) was the first New Zealand film to win major commercial success on its own soil. Murphy directed several Hollywood features during the 1990s, before returning to New Zealand as second-unit director on The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Murphy was also at different times a scriptwriter, special effects technician, schoolteacher and trumpet player. He was married to Merata Mita, also a film director, actor, writer. Early life Murphy grew up in the Wellington suburb of Highbury, and attended St. Vincent de Paul School in Kelburn and St. Patrick's College, Wellington, before training and working as a schoolteacher. Blerta Murphy was a founding member of the hippy musical and theatrical co-operative Blerta, which toured New Zealand and Australia performing multi-media shows in the early 1970s. Blerta were later given the opportunity to make their own television series, which in turn spawned what is arguably Murphy's first feature film, the 75-minute-long Wild Man. A number of Blerta members would work on Murphy's films, including drummer and Blerta founder Bruno Lawrence, who had starring roles in Utu and The Quiet Earth. Early films Murphy made his name with road movie Goodbye Pork Pie (1981), the first New Zealand film to attract large-scale audiences in its home country. Made on a low budget, the film followed three people travelling from the top of the North Island to the bottom of the South Island, to growing infamy along the way. Murphy directed the film and co-produced it with Nigel Hutchinson. Murphy next directed the MƒÅori Western Utu (1983) and the last- man-on-Earth piece The Quiet Earth (1985). Hollywood By the 1990s Murphy had begun a decade working outside of New Zealand, mostly in the United States. In this period he directed films such as Young Guns II, Freejack, which featured Emilio Estevez and Mick Jagger, and Steven Seagal sequel Under Siege 2: Dark Territory. The latter proved his most successful film at the international box-office, grossing more than US$100 million worldwide. Return to New Zealand Murphy returned to New Zealand and assisted Peter Jackson on The Lord of the Rings films; made a documentary film chronicling the Blerta phenomenon; and directed the thriller Spooked, featuring Cliff Curtis. In the later 2000s, he directed the New Zealand television comedy series Welcome to Paradise, worked on the remastered DVD release of Goodbye Pork Pie, and was 2nd-unit director on XXX: State of the Union. In 2013 Murphy was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2013 Rialto Channel New Zealand Film Awards. The same year saw the release of a restored and re- edited version of possibly his most ambitious film, Utu, under the title Utu Redux. Murphy was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to film, in the 2014 New Year Honours. In the same year, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in literature by Massey University. Murphy died on 3 December 2018.https://deadline.com/2018/12/geoff-murphy-dead-lord-of-the- rinfs-1202513396/ Filmography *1974 Uenuku (TV, 37min) *1977 Wild Man (75min) *1977 Dagg Day Afternoon (30min) *1981 Goodbye Pork Pie *1983 Utu *1985 The Quiet Earth *1988 Never Say Die *1989 Red King, White Knight *1990 Young Guns II *1992 Freejack *1993 Blind Side (HBO) *1994 The Last Outlaw *1995 Under Siege 2: Dark Territory *1996 Don't Look Back *1997 The Magnificent Seven ‚Äì TV pilot *1997 Dante's Peak ‚Äì 2nd Unit Director *1999 Fortress 2 *2000 Race Against Time *2001 Blerta Revisited (documentary) *2001 The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring ‚Äì 2nd Unit Director *2002 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers ‚Äì 2nd Unit Director *2003 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King ‚Äì 2nd Unit Director *2004 Spooked *2005 XXX: State of the Union ‚Äì 2nd Unit Director *2009 Tales of Mystery and Imagination References External links * *Geoff Murphy at NZ On Screen *Geoff Murphy at New Zealand Film Commission 1938 births 2018 deaths New Zealand film directors English-language film directors Science fiction film directors People educated at St. Patrick's College, Wellington APRA Award winners Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit Massey University alumni Action film directors ","title":"Geoff Murphy"},{"id":"599926","text":"The Venera 11 ( meaning Venus 11) was a Soviet uncrewed space mission part of the Venera program to explore the planet Venus.

The orbiter was the first spacecraft to orbit Venus, while the lander was the first to return images from the surface of another planet. Orbiter The orbiter entered Venus orbit on October 20, 1975. Its mission was to act as a communications relay for the lander and to explore cloud layers and atmospheric parameters with several instruments and experiments. It performed 17 survey missions from October 26, 1975 to December 25, 1975. The orbiter consisted of a cylinder with two solar panel wings and a high gain parabolic antenna attached to the curved surface. A bell-shaped unit holding propulsion systems was attached to the bottom of the cylinder, and mounted on top was a sphere which held the lander. =Orbiter design= The instruments composing the orbiter included: * 1.6‚Äì2.8 Œºm IR spectrometer * 8‚Äì28 Œºm IR radiometer * 352 nm UV photometer * 2 photo-polarimeters (335‚Äì800 nm) * 300‚Äì800 nm spectrometer * Lyman-Œ± (alpha) H/D spectrometer * Bistatic radar mapping * CM, DM radio occultations * Triaxial Magnetometer * 345‚Äì380 nm UV camera * 355‚Äì445 nm camera * 6 electrostatic analyzers * 2 modulation ion traps * Low-energy proton / alpha detector * Low-energy electron detector * 3 semiconductor counters * 2 gas-discharge counters * Cherenkov detector Lander Photo of the surface of Venus taken by the Venera 9 lander on October 22, 1975 The lander was encased in a spherical shell before landing to help protect it from the heat of entry as it slowed from 10.7 km/s to 150 m/s. This sphere was then separated with explosive bolts and a three-domed parachute was deployed which slowed the lander further to 50 m/s at an altitude of 63 km above the planet.Keldysh, M. V., 1977: \\"Venus Exploration with the Venera 9 and Venera 10 Spacecraft\\", Icarus, 30: 605-625. The descent through the cloud layer took about 20 minutes, during which time the lander took measurements of the atmosphere and radioed the information to the orbiter. To minimize lander damage in the hot atmosphere, the parachute was released at an altitude of 50 km, and the ring-shaped aerodynamic shield provided braking. The Venusian atmosphere is so dense near the surface that this shield provided a descent rate of 7 m/s as the lander touched down. The landing device, a hollow ring surrounding the lower part of the lander, was partly crushed upon touchdown to take up most of the landing impact. On October 20, 1975, the lander spacecraft separated from the orbiter, and landing was made with the Sun near zenith at 05:13 UTC on October 22. Venera 9 landed within a radius of , near Beta Regio, on a steep (20¬∞) slope covered with boulders (suspected to be the slope of the tectonic rift valley, Aikhylu Chasma). The entry sphere weighed and the surface payload was .Interplanetary Spacecraft It was the first spacecraft to return an image from the surface of another planet. Many of the instruments began working immediately after touchdown and the cameras were operational 2 minutes later. These instruments revealed a smooth surface with numerous stones. The lander measured a light level of 14,000 lux, similar to that of Earth in full daylight but no direct sunshine. A system of circulating fluid was used to distribute the heat load. This system, plus pre-cooling prior to entry, permitted operation of the lander for 53 minutes after landing, at which time radio contact with the orbiter was lost as the orbiter moved out of radio range. During descent, heat dissipation and deceleration were accomplished sequentially by protective hemispheric shells, three parachutes, a disc-shaped drag brake, and a compressible, metal, doughnut-shaped landing cushion. The landing was about from the Venera 10 landing site. Venera 9 measured clouds that were thick with bases at altitude. It also measured atmospheric chemicals including hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, bromine and iodine. Other measurements included surface pressure of about , temperature of , and surface light levels comparable to those at Earth mid- latitudes on a cloudy summer day. Venera 9 was the first probe to send back black and white television pictures from the Venusian surface showing no shadows, no apparent dust in the air, and a variety of rocks which were not eroded. Planned 360-degree panoramic pictures could not be taken because one of two camera lens covers failed to come off, limiting pictures to 180 degrees.

Beauchief is pronounced bee-chiff. History The abbey was founded by Robert FitzRanulph de Alfreton. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that it was founded in 1183. However, Samuel Pegge in his History of Beauchief Abbey noted that Albinas, the abbot of Derby, who was one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint Thomas Becket, who had been canonised in 1172. Tanner stated that Robert FitzRanulf was one of the murderers of Thomas Becket and founded the abbey to expiate his guilt. Pegge also disputed this fact, showing that Robert FitzRanulf had no connection with the murder. Beauchief Abbey from the north-east The abbey was of the Premonstratensian order founded by Saint Norbert at Pr√©montr√© in France. Members of the order are known as White Canons. Beauchief was a small house comprising around 12 to 15 canons plus lay brothers. It had the full range of monastic buildings including the abbey church, cloisters, chapter house, dormitory and refectory. A stream provided water to the Abbey and to fish ponds. As with most monastic sites, Beauchief was an industrial as well as a religious centre. Farming on the Beauchief estate and on outlying manors was important, and the monastery also controlled iron smelting, mineral extraction, woodland industries and mills on the River Sheaf from which Sheffield takes its name. The Abbey was dissolved in 1537 and the estate became the property of Sir Nicholas Strelley, from whom it descended to the Pegge family through the marriage of Edward Pegge of Ashbourne, Derbyshire to Gertrude Strelley, heiress of the Strelley's, in Norton on 17 July 1648. In 1671 Edward Pegge built Beauchief Hall using stone from the now ruined Abbey. In 1923 the estate was purchased by Mr Frank Crawshaw. Some of the land was sold for housing development but much was presented to Sheffield Corporation. Beauchief Park today Today only the western tower of the Abbey remains, together with some ruins (including a wall) to the immediate south-east. The tower is attached to a chapel (now a church) built in the 17th century, but what remains is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The foundations of other buildings are visible and the medieval fishponds still exist. Much of the old estate is now occupied by two golf courses (Abbeydale Golf Club and Beauchief Golf Club), but several areas of ancient woodland remain: Parkbank Wood to the East of the Abbey, Old Park Wood and Little Wood Bank to the south, Gulleys Wood in the centre of the park and Ladies Spring Wood to the west. Public footpaths run through the estate, including across the golf courses and through several of the woods. The Sheffield Round Walk arrives from Park Bank Wood, running eastwards through Chancet Wood and on to Graves Park. =Ladies Spring Wood (also known as Totley Wood)= This is an arc-shaped area of mature deciduous woodland on a steep bank facing the River Sheaf to the west. It was formerly managed for coppicing with standards--the remains of charcoal platforms and q-pits are still to be found here. It is currently managed by Sheffield City Council for wildlife and public recreation, and has two public footpaths running through. The trees today are mainly sessile oak, with birch and rowan on the upper slopes and ash and alder on the lower slopes and on the river terrace, with small numbers of other species also represented. The upper terrace is dominated by rhododendrons. The wood supports many birds, including dippers by the river and several species of hole-nesting birds including all the nuthatch, the green woodpecker, the great spotted woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker. There is significant evidence that this is primary ancient woodland, including: * The name: Spring is Anglo-Saxon for coppicing, indicating that the wood existed (and was managed for coppicing) many hundreds of years ago. * The shape. The wood's edge has several bends and zig-zags, characteristic of the surrounding land being cleared over a long period of time. * The location: The River Sheaf on its western border used to be the boundary between the parishes of Sheffield and Norton; and formerly the boundary between Yorkshire and Derbyshire; and before that, the boundary between the Anglo-Saxon states of Mercia and Northumbria. Woodland on such boundaries is often left undeveloped. * The absence of evidence of early settlements or field boundaries.Ladies Spring Wood information board - Prof Melvyn Jones It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest for its biological interest, under the name \\"Totley Wood\\". =Parkbank Wood= This is also an old mature wood, though it has seen more active use in the past and may not be primary ancient woodland. There is again evidence of charcoal and white coal manufacture in the form of charcoal hearths and Q-pits, and also evidence of former quarrying and boundary ditches, which may indicate that the area was at one time cleared for agriculture. This is also now mostly mature sessile oak, and has public footpaths granting access, including the Sheffield Round Walk. The parkland, though it has had its topography altered for the golf courses, still includes evidence of mediaeval ridge and furrow farming.

Annotated patent drawing. The Einstein‚ÄìSzilard or Einstein refrigerator is an absorption refrigerator which has no moving parts, operates at constant pressure, and requires only a heat source to operate. It was jointly invented in 1926 by Albert Einstein and his former student Le√≥ Szil√°rd, who patented it in the U.S. on November 11, 1930 (). The three working fluids in this design are water, ammonia and butane. The Einstein refrigerator is a development of the original three-fluid patent by the Swedish inventors Baltzar von Platen and Carl Munters.  History  From 1926 until 1934 Einstein and Szil√°rd collaborated on ways to improve home refrigeration technology. The two were motivated by contemporary newspaper reports of a Berlin family who had been killed when a seal in their refrigerator failed and leaked toxic fumes into their home. Einstein and Szil√°rd proposed that a device without moving parts would eliminate the potential for seal failure, and explored practical applications for different refrigeration cycles. Einstein used the experience he had gained during his years at the Swiss Patent Office to apply for valid patents for their inventions in several countries. The two were eventually granted 45 patents in their names for three different models. It has been suggested that most of the actual inventing was performed by Szil√°rd, with Einstein merely acting as a consultant and helping with the patent-related paperwork, but others assert Einstein labored over the project. The refrigerator was not immediately put into commercial production; the most promising of their patents being quickly bought up by the Swedish company Electrolux. Einstein and Szilard earned $750 (the equivalent of $10,000 in 2017). A few demonstration units were constructed from other patents. In 2007, a prototype of a commercial refrigeration device intended for use as a vaccine cooler was shown by Adam Grosser at a TED Talk; the prototype operates at constant pressure, requiring exposure to a cooking fire to activate it. Once heated, the prototype would serve as a refrigerator for 24 hours. As of 2019, Grosser's prototype has not yet been put into commercial production. In 2008, electrical engineers at Oxford University's Energy and Power Group, part of the university's Department of Engineering Science, revived the Einstein refrigerator as an attempt to produce a no-electricity refrigerator suitable for use in rural areas. The group, led by Malcolm McCulloch noted that the design was still \\"far from being commercialized\\", but might allow the efficiency of the original Einstein-Szil√°rd design to be quadrupled.

India is fast becoming a major manufacturer and consumer of white coal. A large number of companies have switched their boiler fuels to use white coal instead of fossil fuels.

The film was New Zealand's first large-scale local hit. One book described it as Easy Rider meets the Keystone Cops.NA Film Archive ‚Äî Goodbye Pork Pie It was filmed during November 1979, using only 24 cast and crew. Its overheads were surprisingly minimal, to the point that the police cars used doubled as crew and towing vehicles, and that the director Geoff Murphy performed some of the stunts himself. Plot In the Northland town of Kaitaia in spring 1978,Title card: \\"Kataia[,] Spring 1978\\" nineteen-year-old Gerry Austin (Kelly Johnson) opportunistically steals a wallet and uses the cash and driver's licence inside to rent a yellow Mini. With no particular aim in mind, he drifts down to Auckland. Meanwhile, in Auckland, the middle-aged John (Tony Barry), has just had Sue, his girlfriend of six years, walk out on him and fly home to Invercargill. After a night on the bottle, John decides to go down to Invercargill. Searching for transport, John notices Gerry being stopped by a traffic officer for failing to wear a seat belt. John intervenes and manages to get the officer off writing a ticket. As thanks, Gerry offers John a lift part of the way. The duo stop for petrol in the northern Waikato, but accidentally drive off without paying, drawing police attention to the car. Further down the road, Gerry and John pick up Shirl (Claire Oberman), who is heading to Wanganui, and after informing the duo that she is a virgin, Gerry makes a bet that this will change before reaching Wanganui. After failing to pay for petrol on purpose in the central North Island, they are pursued by a motorcycle officer, with the duo ending up avoiding arrest by driving into a car wreckers. On the road to Wanganui, the trio discuss about whether Gerry had sex with Shirl or not when he tried to silence her in the chase beforehand. However, the discussion ends in a stalemate. Shirl doesn't leave at Wanganui, and decides to stay with the guys and go to Wellington. In Wellington, the trio meet Mulvaney (Bruno Lawrence), an old associate of John's, who gives the trio overnight accommodation at his garage and supplies them with money and drugs in return for parts of the car. Leaving for the inter-island ferry the next morning, Gerry runs a red light and is immediately pursued by the police through central Wellington. The trio avoid the police by driving through the Wellington railway station and stowing the Mini in an empty boxcar being shunted onto the ferry. Arriving in Picton in the South Island, the boxcar is attached to a train destined for Christchurch, and the trio enjoy a leisurely ride, decorating the wagon with the name \\"Blondini\\" and other items found in the train's wagons. After a night of partying, Gerry finally wins his bet with Shirl. Arriving in Christchurch in the morning, the trio finds out the wagon is not leaving the city for the West Coast until that night, so spend the day on the town. Gerry and John return to the train, but notices Shirl is not there, and the train leaves without her. After leaving the train, Gerry and John stop at a tearoom further down the coast. They find out from the television that Shirl was arrested for shoplifting, and that they're wanted in a national man-hunt of the \\"Blondini Gang\\". Crossing back over the Southern Alps, the Mini is pursued by a determined police officer (Marshall Napier) down the Lake HƒÅwea shoreline. He almost catches Gerry and John, but ends up driving off the road and down the bank trying to avoid a combine harvester blocking the road. The duo sell more parts off the car at Cromwell, but as they are short-changed John takes a full petrol can as extra payment. At Dunedin, the duo meet Snout, who helps them avoid a police roadblock and buys more parts off the car. However, after he learns they're heading for Invercargill, he tips them off to the police. Stopping for conveniences, John is spotted by police; unable to find Gerry, he drives off in the Mini, not realising Gerry is underneath the car trying to remove the muffler. Gerry is arrested, but manages to escape from the police car and jumps on top of the fleeing Mini. The police try to PIT the Mini, and Gerry falls off and is hit by the pursuing police car. John says goodbye to Gerry, who is severely injured, then takes the car and proceeds to Invercargill. John encounters a roadblock at the entrance to Invercargill and diverts through a cemetery to avoid it, but not before the Armed Offenders Squad shoots a hole in the Cromwell fuel can, spilling the petrol. Approaching Sue's house, the insecure exhaust dragging along the road ignites the fuel, setting it alight. John reunites with Sue, but their reunion is short-lived when the burning Mini draws the attention of emergency services. With police surrounding the house, John finally admits defeat and surrenders himself.

It was the first really financially successful New Zealand film of modern times. Production Goodbye Pork Pie was filmed chronologically over six weeks in late 1979, following the north to south route taken by the film's protagonists. Filming began in the northern town of Kaitaia and ended in Invercargill, near the bottom of the South Island. Director Geoff Murphy, who co-produced the film with Nigel Hutchinson, had been good friends with star Tony Barry (Smith) as well as Bruno Lawrence before Goodbye Pork Pie. The three had played together in multi-media group Blerta. Geoff Murphy cameos in the film as a man working at the second petrol station. Co-producer Nigel Hutchinson sells a banana milk shake \\"with an egg in it\\" to John a short time before Gerry falls off the car. =Cars= The yellow mini was a 1978 British Leyland Mini 1000, registered IZ6393. However, three 1978 Minis were used during filming. They were sourced from the New Zealand Motor Corporation (assemblers of British Leyland products in NZ). After filming was completed, two of the Minis that were undamaged were returned to The New Zealand Motor Corporation. The third, which had a hole cut in the roof and the front bodywork removed, was used for promotion and is still in New Zealand. Its actual registration is IX2992. A fourth, 1959 Mini was used for the final scene where it was burnt out. The Holden HQ police cars used in the film doubled as towing and support vehicles for the cast and crew. These were the police cars chasing the Mini throughout both the North and South Islands. =Locations= An early scene in the film shows John and his partner in a taxi, after she has left him, crossing the old Mangere Bridge. The new bridge, at the time of the film's production, was on hold for a couple of years in an unfinished state due to prolonged industrial action. When Gerry and John pick up Shirl, she is standing in front of the now-decommissioned Meremere coal-fired power station. The first petrol station that fuel was stolen from is located in Pokeno, and is now a camper van sales yard. The second petrol station the trio stole fuel from is located in National Park, at the intersection of State Highway 4 and State Highway 47. The Interislander ferry that the Mini is stowed on between Wellington and Picton is the . The Christchurch railway station where the Mini is stowed while in Christchurch was closed in 1993, replaced by a new station built in Addington. This building was used as a movie theatre and Science Alive from 1993, until the building was badly damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The building was demolished in 2012. A later scene in the film shows Blondini and John in Cromwell, Central Otago. The part of Cromwell shown is now underwater, due to the Lake Dunstan hydroelectric project. The scene at McNab, Southland where Gerry is caught by the police shows a decrepit old toilet block at the side of the road. It was actually a temporary structure built specifically for the film. Remake In 2014, a remake of the film was announced, with Matt Murphy ‚Äì one of Geoff Murphy's sons who had worked on the original version ‚Äì as director. The same year, a re-enactment of the Lake HƒÅwea chase was filmed to promote the New Mini,WATCH OUR GOODBYE PORK PIE SCENE REMAKE NOW. which featured prominently in the remake, simply known as Pork Pie. Filming of Pork Pie started in March 2016. Dean O'Gorman, James Rolleston and Ashleigh Cummings star as Jon (John), Luke (Gerry) and Kiera (Shirl) respectively. The film's first trailer was released on 17 October 2016, with the film released in cinemas on 2 February 2017.

Most churches which use the Old (Julian) Calendar are not Old Calendarists: they remain in communion with the Eastern Orthodox Churches that use the New Calendar (the Revised Julian calendar). Thus, to be \\"Old Calendarist\\" or \\"Old Calendar\\" is not the same thing as being \\"on the Old Calendar\\". The Russian Orthodox Church, for instance, is not Old Calendarist (or Old Calendar), but it is on the Old Calendar. There are a great many Eastern Orthodox Christians who are (or who belong to Churches that are) on the Old Calendar, but far fewer in number are the Eastern Orthodox Christians who are Old Calendar or Old Calendarist. The Revised Julian calendar was first used as a civil calendar in Greece and was later adopted by some Orthodox churches. A minority of Eastern Orthodox Christians regarded this as a surrender of the Eastern Orthodox Church to the Pope and continued following the old calendar. Some of these also broke communion with those who had adopted the new calendar, thus creating their own church, or denomination. This schism is the beginning of the Old Calendar Churches which suspended full communion or concelebration with other Eastern Orthodox churches (\\"New Calendarists\\") over the adoption by the latter of the Revised Julian calendar (called \\"New Calendar,\\" although some churches did not specify the details of which New calendar they were adopting). Those Orthodox Churches which remain in full communion with the New Calendarists and yet continue to use the Julian calendar include the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, and the Georgian Orthodox Church. (The Julian calendar is also used by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia which has reunited with the Russian Orthodox Church.) Mount Athos, subordinate to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, also follows the Julian calendar.

classical antiquity. It was a bishopric as Tana and remains a Latin Catholic titular see as Tanais. Location The delta reaches into the northeasternmost part of the Sea of Azov, which the Ancient Greeks called Lake Maeotis. The site of ancient Tanais is about 30 km west of modern Rostov-on-Don. The central city site lies on a plateau with a difference up to 20 m in elevation in the south. It is bordered by a natural valley to the east, and an artificial ditch to the west. History The site of Tanais was occupied long before the Milesians founded an emporium there. A necropolis of over 300 burial kurgans near the ancient city shows that the site had already been occupied since the Bronze Age, and that kurgan burials continued through Greek and into even Roman times. The Tanais (Don) River, the Greek colony of the same name and other Greek colonies along the north coast of the Black Sea. Greek traders seem to have been meeting nomads in the district as early as the 7th century BC without a formal, permanent settlement. Greek colonies had two kinds of origins, apoikiai of citizens from the mother city-state, and emporia, which were strictly trading stations. Founded late in the 3rd century BC, by merchant adventurers from Miletus, Tanais quickly developed into an emporium at the farthest northeastern extension of the Hellenic cultural sphere. It was a natural post, first for the trade of the steppes reaching away eastwards in an unbroken grass sea to the Altai, the Scythian Holy Land, second for the trade of the Black Sea, ringed with Greek-dominated ports and entrepots, and third for trade from the impenetrable north, with furs and slaves brought down the Don. Strabo mentions Tanais in his Geography (11.2.2). The site for the city, ruled by an archon, was at the eastern edge of the territory of the kings of Bosporus. A major shift in social emphasis is represented in the archaeological site when the propylea gate that linked the port section with the agora was removed, and the open center of public life was occupied by a palatial dwelling in Roman times for the kings of Bosporus. For the first time there were client kings at Tanais: Sauromates (AD 175-211) and his son Rescuporides (c. AD 220), who both left public inscriptions. In AD 330 Tanais was devastated by the Goths, but the site was occupied continuously up to the second half of the 5th century AD. Increasingly, the channel silted up, probably the result of deforestation, and the center of active life shifted, perhaps to the small city of Azov, halfway to Rostov. The city was refounded around the 13th century by the Venetians. Later it was acquired by the maritime Republic of Genoa, who administered it 1332-1471 as Tana nel Mare Maggiore, being an important place for trade with the Golden Horde, like all their Black Sea colonies controlled by the Genoese Consul at Kaffa. It decayed again after 1368. In 1392 it was conquered by Timur, by the Ottoman Turks in 1471, by the Russians in 1696, again by the Turks in 1711 and by the Russian Empire in 1771. Ecclesiastical History Circa 1300, under Venetian rule, was established a Diocese of Tana as territory not previously served, maintained under Genua. Most bishops were members of two major and missionary orders. It was exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See, not part of any ecclesiastical province.Pius Bonifacius Gams, Series episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae, (Leipzig, 1931), p. 432Konrad Eubel, Hierarchia Catholica Medii Aevi, vol. 1, p. 471.vol. 2, p. 245.

Archaeology In 1823, I. A. Stempkovsky first made a connection between the visible archaeological remains, which were mostly Roman in date, and the \\"Tanais\\" mentioned in the ancient Greek sources. Systematic modern excavations began in 1955. A joint Russian-German team has recently been excavating at the site of Tanais, with the aim of revealing the heart of the city, the agora, and defining the extent of Hellenistic influence on the urbanism of the Bosporan Greek city, as well as studying defensive responses to the surrounding nomadic cultures. In the book Jakten p√• Odin, author Thor Heyerdahl advanced a highly controversial idea postulating connections between Tanais and ancient Scandinavia. In preparation of the book, he conducted some archaeological research on the site of Tanais. Heyerdal\`s idea was based on the old Norse sagas of Snorri Sturlason. (1178 - 1241) Tanais Tablets are the most important historical discoveries in region of Tanais. =Genetics= 9 Y-chromosome markers were obtained from a skeleton. The result was 389I=13, 389II=30, 458=15, 385=11, 393=13, 391=11, 635=23, 437=14, 448=19. This result is characteristic for haplogroup R1a.

They have emerged as one of the most successful clubs from the former East Germany and have made several appearances in the top-flight Bundesliga. After being in the Bundesliga for ten years, from 1995 to 2005, Rostock suffered a steady decline. In 2012, the club was relegated to the 3. Liga for the second time and is now playing there for the eighth consecutive season. History Historical chart of Hansa league performance after WWII The club was originally founded on 1 November 1954 as the multi-sport Sportclub Empor Rostock. The football squad, however, could not be recruited from local Betriebssportgemeinschaften like the squad of the handball section, so a transfer of BSG Empor Lauter's squad from Lauter to Rostock was considered. The area around Lauter, near the Czech border, was well represented in East German football by competitive sides including Wismut Aue, Fortschritt Meerane and Motor Zwickau, so the footballers of Empor Lauter was delegated to Rostock, over the futile protests of the team's local supporters, to Rostock. Then SED First Secretary in Bezirk Rostock Karl Mewis and SED functionary Harry Tisch were instrumental in the relocation of BSG Empor Lauter to Rostock. Karl Lewis was allegedly the initiator of the relocation. This was not an uncommon occurrence in the 1950s of East German football, where clubs were regularly renamed, re-structured, dismantled or shuffled from city to city at the direction of well-placed communist officials. The new club would be sponsored by the fishing combine VEB Fischkombinat Rostock. The wholesale transfer of the Lauterers to Rostock part way through the 1954‚Äì55 season led to the disappearance of that association from play. A new club was formed in 1956 as BSG Motor Lauter and on 1 August 1990, it took up the tradition of the original side to play as Lauterer Sportverein Viktoria 1913. =Play in Rostock= SC Dynamo Berlin at the Ostseestadion in 1957. Newly formed SC Empor Rostock took the place of the former Lauter-based club in first division play in November 1954. They finished second the next season, but in 1956 plunged to 14th place and were relegated. They quickly bounced back, rejoining the DDR-Oberliga in 1958, before going on to become a very competitive side with a series of three vice- championships to their credit from 1962 to 1964, as well as several appearances in the final of the FDGB Pokal. The re-organization of East German sports in 1965 led to the association's football department becoming independent as Fu√üball Club Hansa Rostock, which was designated as one of the country's 11 focus clubs intended to groom talent for the development of a strong East Germany national team. The new club's name acknowledged Rostock's history as one of the major trading centres of northern Europe's Hanseatic League. FC Hansa Rostock would be sponsored by the fishing combine VEB Kombinat Seeverkehr und Hafenwirtschaft. And the club would be patronaged by the SED First Secretary of Bezirk Rostock as well as future Free German Trade Union Federation chairman and Politburo member Harry Tisch. By the 1970s, the club was consistently finishing in the lower half of the league table and was relegated to the second division DDR-Liga for a single season on three occasions late in the decade. They returned to form in the 1980s and as the football leagues of West Germany and East Germany were merged in 1990 after the re-unification of the country, Rostock won its first national championship in the final season of East German football, played out in the transitional NOFV-Oberliga. This is their only top flight title to date in play in East Germany or the unified Germany. They also captured the last ever East German Cup with a 1‚Äì0 win over FC Stahl Eisenh√ºttenstadt. =United Germany and the Bundesliga= The January 1990 squad The club's timely success earned them a place in the Bundesliga alongside Dynamo Dresden when the top-flight Bundesliga was briefly expanded from 18 to 20 teams for the 1991‚Äì92 season to accommodate two former East German teams. Hansa, however, was unable to stay up and was relegated after falling just a single point shy of SG Wattenscheid 09. Three seasons of tempering in the 2. Bundesliga would return the club to the top flight for the 1995‚Äì96 season. In ten years spent in the Bundesliga, the team's best results were a pair of sixth-place finishes. In spite of frequent placings in the bottom-half of the league table, they would persist as the only former East German side able to consistently challenge the well- heeled clubs of the west. On 1 December 2002, Rostock became the first club to field six foreigners from the same country in a Bundesliga match (Rade Prica, Marcus Lantz, Peter Wibr√•n, Andreas Jakobsson, Magnus Arvidsson and Joakim Persson ‚Äì all Swedes). Rostock had a very poor first half in the 2004‚Äì05 season, earning only 1 win and 5 draws in 17 matches. They were unable to recover despite the late arrival of Finnish striker Jari Litmanen and at season's end were relegated, leaving the former GDR without a club in the top flight for the first time since re-unification. Like other East German teams, they were the victims of a harsh economic reality as the wealthier, well- established western sides bought up the most talented eastern footballers as their clubs struggled to survive financially: Rostock's Stefan Beinlich, Oliver Neuville and Victor Agali were just three players sent west in exchange for cash. After two years in the 2. Bundesliga, the club returned to the top- flight for the 2007‚Äì08 season, but was again relegated. The club's poor form continued in 2009‚Äì10 and they finished third-last. With this season, a new promotion/relegation format accompanied the introduction of the 3. Liga and Rostock found itself in a playoff versus the third place third division club FC Ingolstadt. Hansa lost both legs of the contest and was sent down to the 3. Liga, while Ingolstadt won promotion to the 2. Bundesliga alongside the top two third tier teams which advanced automatically by virtue of their finishes. Their stay was a short one as they were sent back down after finishing bottom table in 2011‚Äì12. Hansa Rostock drew an average home attendance of 11,433http://www.worldfootball.net/attendance/3-liga-2016-2017/1/ in the 2016‚Äì17 3. Liga, the third-highest in the league.

According to another study published in 2008 by Allensbach Institute, Hansa is the most popular German football club in the New L√§nder and the most popular club of the former GDR in reunited Germany. Hansa Rostock's official anthem is \\"FC Hansa, wir lieben Dich total\\" (\\"Hansa FC, We Totally Love You\\"), recorded in 1995 by East German band Puhdys. Hansa struggles with hooliganism, estimating up to 500 supporters to be leaning towards violence. The club itself as well some fans' associations are anxious to curtail these in several ways. In 2005, the club successfully sued three streakers who disrupted their 2003 match against Hertha BSC to recoup the ‚Ç¨20,000 they were fined by the German Football Association (DFB) for failing to maintain adequate security at their ground. Stadium The original Ostseestadion was built in 1954, with the participation of several hundred citizens of Rostock who helped for free. The first international match in the Ostseestadion of East Germany was on 26 September 1956. In 2001, the stadium was refurbished and modified to accommodate 30,000 spectators.

Led by frontman Crispian Mills, the band came to prominence during the Post-Britpop era of the late 1990s. The band enjoyed commercial success in the UK between 1996 and 1999, notching up a number of Top 10 hits on the UK Singles Chart, including \\"Tattva\\", \\"Hey Dude\\", \\"Govinda\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"Sound of Drums\\". The band's debut album, K, reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart. It was voted number 879 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). The band are known for their interest in traditional Indian music, culture, and mysticism, with a number of their most famous songs, including \\"Tattva\\" and \\"Govinda\\", featuring lyrics written in Sanskrit. The name Kula Shaker was itself inspired by king Kulasekhara, an Indian king from the 9th century.Noburu Karashmia (ed.), A Concise History of South India: Issues and Interpretations. New Delhi: Oxford University Press, 2014. 143. In addition, many of the band's songs feature traditional Indian instruments, such as the sitar, tamboura, and tabla, juxtaposed with guitar-heavy, Western rock instrumentation. Despite achieving commercial success, Kula Shaker were unpopular with many critics, with The Observer's Simon Price describing them in 2014 as a \\"joke band\\". Kula Shaker disbanded in September 1999 but reformed in 2004 for sessions for the School of Braja compilation album. This led to plans for a full comeback, although the reformation was not widely publicised until the beginning of 2006. The band's third album, Strangefolk, was issued in 2007 and their fourth, Pilgrims Progress, was released in 2010. The band returned with a mostly sold out European tour and new album K 2.0 in 2016 which was well- received both by the media and the fans. Band history =Formation (1988‚Äì1995)= The origin of Kula Shaker can be traced back to 1988 when Crispian Mills (grandson of Sir John Mills and son of actress Hayley Mills and film director Roy Boulting) met Alonza Bevan at Richmond upon Thames College in South-West London. The two went on to play together in a band named Objects of Desire, formed later that year. The band's initial line-up consisted of Mills on lead guitar, Bevan on bass, Marcus French (aka Frog) on drums, Leigh Morris on rhythm guitar, and Marcus Maclaine (then Hayley Mills' boyfriend) on lead vocals. In 1991, Paul Winterhart joined the band, replacing French on drums. During this period, Crispian and Alonza were also responsible for running the Mantra Shack, a psychedelic nightclub at the back of Richmond ice rink, and consequently, the Objects of Desire would often perform at the venue. The Objects of Desire disbanded acrimoniously in early 1993, after which, Mills went on a spiritual pilgrimage, backpacking around India. The trip had a profound effect on the guitarist, fostering a deep interest in Indian culture and Hinduism. Upon returning to the UK he formed a new band named The Kays, with Bevan, Winterhart, and Mills' cousin Saul Dismont (son of the Bermudan politician Russell Dismont) on vocals. The band's debut live performance was at the 1993 Glastonbury Festival. Within a year, Dismont had left the band, only to be replaced by organist Jay Darlington, who had previously been a member of several mod revival bands. After two years of touring and recording, The Kays elected to change their name and musical direction. In May 1995, Mills suggested that the band take the name Kula Shaker, in honour of one of the twelve Alvars (saints of south India), the ninth-century Indian emperor and holy man, King Kulashekhara. In Indian culture, the name Kulashekhara is thought to be lucky or auspicious, and this appealed to the struggling band. Mills also posited that Kula Shaker's music should follow a more spiritual and mystical direction in future, in line with his own growing interest in the philosophy of Gaudiya Vaishnavism. This new emphasis on Indian mysticism and instrumentation, dovetailed with the Beatlesque, 1960s derived influences already present in the band's music, to create a sound heavily indebted to 1960s psychedelia. =Mainstream success (1995‚Äì1999)= In September 1995 Kula Shaker were joint winners of the in the City contest (along with Placebo), which quickly resulted in a record contract with Columbia Records, who were eager to sign another band that had the multi- platinum, crossover appeal of Oasis. A debut single, \\"Tattva (Lucky 13 Mix)\\" (later re-recorded for their debut album) was released on CD and limited 7\\" vinyl in January 1996, but it entered just outside the UK Top 75, at number 86. \\"Tattva\\" was followed quickly in April by the band's second single, \\"Grateful When You're Dead\\", a slice of Jimi Hendrix-esque rock which was to become their debut UK Top 40 single (entering at No. 35). Music press and public alike finally began to take notice of the band, and this sudden exposure propelled the re-released (and re-recorded) \\"Tattva\\" to No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart. The band's upward climb continued with their third single \\"Hey Dude\\", a more traditional rock song which was only kept off the top spot by the Spice Girls when it was released in August. Crispian Mills September saw the release of the band's debut album K, which became the fastest selling debut album in Britain since Elastica's debut the previous year. It was eventually certified 2√óPlatinum by the BPI in January 1997. The album went on to sell over 850,000 copies in the UK (double platinum), and a further 250,000 copies in the United States. The fourth and final single from K was \\"Govinda\\", which reached No. 7 in the UK charts in December of that year. \\"Govinda\\" was sung totally in Sanskrit, and mixed swirling guitars with traditional Indian music. Total sales for all the singles from K came to half a million. 1997 got off to a fine start for the band with four nominations for BRIT Awards, and they subsequently took home the award for \\"British Breakthrough Act\\" at the ceremony in February. In the same month they released what would turn out to be their biggest hit, a cover of \\"Hush\\" (originally written by Joe South for Billy Joe Royal, and most famously performed by the British hard-rock band Deep Purple), which peaked at number 2. The song also proved successful in the U.S., where it was used on the soundtrack to the blockbuster movie I Know What You Did Last Summer and again in the trailer for the 2014 film Kingsman: The Secret Service. The song was also placed at No. 224 by Virgin Radio, in a poll for the 20th century's greatest songs. In the wake of the single's release, some ill-advised remarks on the traditional mystical properties of Swastikas by Crispian Mills put the band in the firing line of some of the UK press. Despite the negative publicity, the band pressed on regardless with a set of live shows in the summer of that year, including T in the Park, Glastonbury and the V Festival. The focus during the latter part of 1997 moved to the US where both \\"Tattva\\" and \\"Hey Dude\\" received airplay exposure. \\"Tattva\\" became a minor No. 10 hit in the Modern Rock Tracks chart and \\"Hey Dude\\" peaked at No. 25\\\\. K itself peaked at No. 11 in the Heatseekers chart and crept to No. 200 in the Billboard charts. An EP, Summer Sun, was released in the U.S. for the band's fans there. The six tracks on the EP were all B-sides to earlier UK singles. After initial disagreements with management, Kula Shaker resurfaced with the UK-only single \\"Sound of Drums\\" in April 1998, peaking at number 3. A promised album in the summer of that year failed to materialise, and the momentum generated by the single was lost as a result. Fans would have to wait until February 1999 to hear any more new material from the forthcoming second album. Bassist Alonza Bevan The second album Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts was partly recorded aboard the houseboat-studio Astoria, which belongs to guitarist David Gilmour (of Pink Floyd). Brett Findlay joined the band as resident percussionist and remained with the band until their break-up at the end of 1999. The release of Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts was preceded by the single \\"Mystical Machine Gun\\" which failed to make as strong an impact on the charts as their previous singles, peaking at Number 14 and only remaining two weeks in the top 40. The album itself followed in March 1999 to mixed reviews, and only sold a mere 25,000 copies in its first week as it crawled in at Number 9 on the album chart, spending only 10 weeks in the UK Top 75. The album went Gold in the UK (over 100,000 copies sold). The third and final single from the album, \\"Shower Your Love\\" failed to reignite momentum, stalling at No. 14, even with it having more TV exposure on Top of the Pops, TFI Friday, Later... with Jools Holland and CD:UK. In June they played Glastonbury Festival and headlined the Lizard Festival in Cornwall in August 1999 to coincide with the total eclipse. The band made a few more festival appearances, including an appearance at V99, as a last-minute replacement for Placebo, before playing their last ever gig in the Netherlands at the end of August. In September of that year, the band announced their split. \\"I have loved my time with Kula Shaker and have experienced more than I could ever have imagined\\", Mills commented. \\"We've had an excellent time and been a very tight band, but there comes a time when you want to do your own thing.\\" =Comments on the swastika= Prior to the release of their second album, the band became the subject of controversy surrounding remarks that Mills had made in the NME and Melody Maker, regarding the swastika, calling it a \\"brilliant image\\" albeit in the context of its traditional Indian origins. The Independent on Sunday ran a front page article in April 1997 reprinting Mills' comments and alleging that the guitarist \\"had dabbled with Nazism\\". The negative publicity surrounding the incident, along with overexposure in the British media, hurt the band's sales. The Independent article also revealed that the Objects of Desire had used the motto \\"England will rise again\\", and had performed at a 1993 conference at Wembley called \\"Global Deception\\" at which speakers included renowned conspiracy theorists Eustace Mullins and William Cooper. Mills responded to the allegations by fax and his responses were incorporated in the article. Mills admitted having played at \\"Global Deception\\", but claimed not to have fully understood the nature of the event. He indicated that he now felt that the swastika, which has origins outside Nazism and different meanings in different parts of the world, was hopelessly connected to Nazism in the West. He indicated that it was the outrage that his comments had sparked that had led him to this conclusion. He also offered an unequivocal condemnation of far-right-wing ideology. Looking back in 2016, Mills said \\"We thought we were smarter than we were ... that was the innocence of our youth ploughing into the adult world.\\" Aside from the consistent message of Mills' lyrics, which include unity in diversity (Tattva), spiritual devotion (Govinda) and global peace (Great Hosanna), it is rarely noted that Mills' father, the late Roy Boulting, was one of the first British filmmakers to use cinema against fascism. The Boulting Brothers' 1939 film Pastor Hall, a moving account of a German preacher who refuses to kowtow to the Nazis, was so groundbreaking that the British Government delayed its release because it was not yet ready to be openly critical of the Third Reich. =After the split (1999‚Äì2004)= Mills went into the studio in 2000 to work on a solo album. Later that year, he toured with a group of musicians under the name Pi, first supporting Robbie Williams on his UK Arena dates, then for some smaller headline shows. A new album was scheduled for release in spring 2001 according to Mills' official website and the NME. However his UK record label didn't feel the material proposed for release was commercial enough, and so Mills negotiated an exit from his contract with them in 2001, continuing to record for the rest of 2001 without a UK record deal. He played at the Glastonbury Festival in 2001 with Suns of Arqa. At the start of 2002, he began working with Andy Nixon and Dan Mckinna, formerly of Straw, and the trio formed a group, The Jeevas. Mills ditched all his previously recorded material up to that point, though some tracks would later feature as Jeevas B-Sides. They released two albums, toured throughout 2002 and 2003, with some dates in mid-2004. Their records were released on their own Cowboy Music label in the UK and mainland Europe, and by Sony in Japan. Some tentative work was done for their third album, but when it became apparent during 2005 that the reformation of Kula Shaker would be permanent, the band officially split up. Drummer Paul Winterhart with Kula Shaker in 2007. Bevan joined Johnny Marr and the Healers in 2000. As a side project, he formed the band Shep (which included Winterhart on drums). The band played a handful of gigs in 2001‚Äì2002 and released some excerpts of recorded music via the web but nothing further was heard of them after 2003. Winterhart joined the band Thirteen:13, who split in 2001. He also drummed on an album by Aqualung as well as being part of Shep. Darlington joined Oasis in 2002 as a touring keyboardist (though not an official band member), and remained in that role until the band's split in 2009. In December 2002, Sony released a best of album, entitled Kollected ‚Äì The Best of Kula Shaker. Mills compiled the track listing for the release and approved the sleevenotes. The compilation included the band's final recorded track, a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\", which was later featured on the soundtrack to the 2005 movie Stoned, starring Leo Gregory. =Reformation and Strangefolk (2004‚Äì2008)= Kula Shaker's reformation has its origins in sessions for a charity album made with the New Braj Village School (a private school in Badger, California, for young people which includes as part of the curriculum teachings about Krishna and devotional music). The album School of Braja was recorded in 2004 and finally saw release in late 2006. Mills, who masterminded the album, arranged not only that the Jeevas play on two tracks, but he also got in touch with his old bandmate, Alonza Bevan. The two worked on a song together for the album, \\"Braj Mandala\\", to which Paul Winterhart added drums. Jay Darlington was asked to be part of the sessions, but declined the opportunity. At the time of the recording, this was announced on the official Jeevas website as Kula Shaker having reformed to contribute a song to the album and was referred to by Mills as a Kula Shaker reunion in subsequent interviews. Additionally, the School of Braja album credits officially state that Kula Shaker appear on the track \\"Braj Mandala\\". The sessions for the track went so well that Mills and Bevan began writing together again and making plans for a full-on Kula Shaker comeback that would encompass live touring and the further release of new material. A new band website was also commissioned. Their first gig back together (as a 3-piece) took place at the Wheatsheaf, Leighton Buzzard, England, on 21 December 2005. This was a 'secret' gig and not promoted beforehand; however, blackboards outside the pub announced \\"Kula Shaker tonight\\" on the night of the show. As a joke about the nature of secret gigs, Mills told the assembled crowd that the band was called The Garcons whilst wearing a \\"big hair\\" grey wig. All sources both official and unofficial have subsequently referred to this gig as a Kula Shaker show. Kula Shaker announced on 11 January 2006 that they had reformed permanently. They released the following statement on their new official website (which launched that day): During preparation for their comeback live dates, a new member joined the band ‚Äì Harry Broadbent. He became the band's new keyboard player, and Kula Shaker were restored to a four-piece once more. The band undertook a small UK tour in the Spring. The tour dates were split into two 'legs', with a pre-tour warm-up show in Milton Keynes. The band played to sell out audiences in smaller venues, playing a mix of new and old material. They also recorded a session for Scottish radio station Clyde1, and made an appearance on the Billy Sloan show on that station to coincide with this. The band released a four-song EP entitled \\"Revenge of the King\\" on iTunes in April. This was later released on a limited run of 1000 10\\" vinyls, sold on certain dates of the band's April/May tour and later from the band's official website. Later still, the EP was released on CD in Japan with a bonus track (the 2006 radio session version of Govinda). Apart from the Japanese bonus track, the tracks on the EP were recorded in a very small studio in London right at the beginning of 2006, before Broadbent joined the band. The band went on to play some festivals in the Summer of 2006 ‚Äì T in the Park, Fuji Rock, V Festival and Pentaport Festival in Korea ‚Äì along with a handful of warm-up dates. After this, they played one more live date in 2006, headlining the Purple Weekend festival in Spain at the end of the year. After the summer festival dates, it was announced on the band's website that the third Kula Shaker album was underway. Pre-production started in September 2006, with final mixing completed by April 2007. It was produced in collaboration with an all-star team of hit makers & Grammy winners, including Tchad Blake (Peter Gabriel, Crowded House), Sam Williams (Supergrass) and Chris Sheldon (The Foo Fighters, The Pixies). In Japan, the Freedom Lovin' People EP preceded the album. It was released there on 23 May 2007. The lead track from this release was the album track \\"Great Dictator (of the Free World)\\" and a rough animatic-style video was used to promote the song on Japanese music stations. In the UK, the first single from the album was \\"Second Sight\\" released on 13 August 2007, reaching No. 101 on the UK Singles Chart. The single was promoted with a pro-shot video featuring the band as characters from the Sherlock Holmes stories. The third album, Strangefolk (which was the working title of second album, Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts), was released in Japan on 27 June 2007 through Sony, in Europe on 20 August 2007 through the band's own label, and on 19 February 2008 in North America through Cooking Vinyl. All editions contain at least one bonus track; the Japanese edition contains two further bonus tracks. The track \\"Song of Love/Narayana\\" on the album incorporates elements from the tracks \\"Narayan\\" and \\"Climbatize\\", both of which can be found on The Prodigy's The Fat of the Land. Narayan was co-written by Mills and included a vocal performance by him. The album reached No. 32 in Japan and No. 69 in the UK. To capitalise on publicity surrounding the band's comeback, the re-release record label Music Club issued a hastily compiled double album Tattva : The Very Best Of Kula Shaker on 16 July 2007, which included all the tracks from the band's first two albums and a handful of previously released non-album tracks. The band had no input into any aspect of the release and their consent was not obtained for its release. They have been asking their fans not to buy it. The band played UK warm-up dates from early June. They went on to play five festival dates in the summer ‚Äì Bilbao BBK Live, Culura Quente festival, Japanese festival Fuji Rock, Norway's PulpIt Rock Festival and the iTunes Festival in London, along with two one-off dates ‚Äì one in London and one in Spain. Further UK dates and a European tour followed in the Autumn. The band then rounded off the tour commitments for the year with two final performances in November, one at Leicester University and another at The Netherlands' Crossing Borders festival. A live EP featuring four tracks from the band's performance at the iTunes festival was released through the iTunes Stores in various countries in October. A second single from Strangefolk, \\"Out on the Highway\\" was released on 5 November 2007, also only available as a download from the UK iTunes Store. Neither release achieved a placing on the UK chart. The final release of the year came on 14 December ‚Äì the free download track \\"Drink Tea (for the Love Of God)\\" featured Alonza on vocals and a pro-tea drinking message in the lyrics. The track was accompanied by an animated video, released online on the same day, which was produced by animation house Model Robot. The band played a Japanese tour and further tours of both the UK and mainland Europe at the start of 2008. They went on to play three European festival dates in the summer. =Pilgrims Progress (2008‚Äìpresent)= On 2 July 2008 the band announced they were back in the studio working on their fourth studio album with working title Pilgrims Progress. However soon after the band became locked in a legal dispute with their label which resulted in most of the work for the next album being frozen. As of May 2009, work on the new album had recommenced. The band played some further live dates in 2009, starting with a pair of dates in Russia in February and following that up with two headline festival appearances in the summer, at Ypsigrock in Italy and Solfest in the UK. In September the band played a set as part of a fundraising evening to support the charity Anno's Africa. On 20 January 2010, the band re-released their second album Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts on their own label with additional bonus tracks, interviews and artwork. Only 3000 copies were pressed and it was only available through their official website. On 28 June 2010, the band's fourth album Pilgrims Progress was released. The lead single from the album was \\"Peter Pan R.I.P\\", which was released as a free download from the band's official website on 22 April 2010. The album was issued as a standard twelve track CD, as a limited edition deluxe box set, and as a super deluxe box set with a limited production run of 300 copies. Despite making a limited impact commercially the album was applauded by the music press, becoming their best reviewed album since their debut. The band played an album release show on 8 July at the Garage in London. A successful tour of the Far East followed with a number of festival dates across Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Korea and Hong Kong. On 6 September 2010 Crispian Mills announced on the band's official website that the band were postponing touring so he could concentrate on a film project to begin in early 2011. The news was received with mixed reaction, many suggesting that the band have missed a great opportunity to gain considerable exposure on the back of the positive reaction towards Pilgrims Progress. On 12 November 2010, the band announced they would be recording a Christmas single which would be a double A-side. The single, \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)/Snowflake\\" was released exclusively as a free download from the band's website on 10 December. On 16 September 2011, the band released a 2 CD + 1 DVD 15th anniversary edition of K, including some unreleased material and a new documentary. On 28 September 2015 the band announced they are returning in 2016 with a European tour and new album titled K 2.0, releasing two teasers of a track named \\"Mountain Lifter\\" then a song called \\"Infinite Sun\\". K 2.0 was officially released on digital, LP and CD formats on 12 February 2016. K was re-released by Columbia/BMG in 2016 to mark the 20th anniversary.  Musical style and media response  Although Kula Shaker's sound owes a lot to the classic rock bands of 1960s and 1970s, the songs often combine Eastern influenced sonics (\\"Govinda\\"), with lyrical themes of a universal spirituality quest, employing ideas of soul and devotion from diverse traditions such as Hinduism (\\"Tattva\\"), to Christianity (\\"Great Hosanna\\"), and even Native American Indian (\\"Infinite Sun\\"). Noel Gallagher was an early champion of the band, inviting them to support at Oasis' historic Knebworth concerts, but from the outset of their career, Kula Shaker polarised UK media opinion. This arguably stemmed from age old British preconceptions about class and race. Not only were they white youngsters singing about Krishna in Sanskrit, they were seen as coming from privileged middle class backgrounds. Speaking in an interview in 2016, Mills says \\"When I was in private schools, they called me 'common', and when I was in state schools they called me 'posh'. It made me very cynical about all these labels.\\" At the height of Britpop, and 'lad culture', music publications like Melody Maker, Select, and NME often focused on the class angle and ridiculed Kula's fascination with Indian culture. Mills commented in 2016: \\"The musical styles on K are mainstream now. [In 1996] people didn't know how to understand it or where to place it, so all that was left to do was deride it.\\" Members ; Current members *Crispian Mills ‚Äì lead vocals, guitars, tamboura, harmonica (1995‚Äì1999, 2004‚Äìpresent) *Alonza Bevan ‚Äì bass, additional guitars, piano, vocals (1995‚Äì1999, 2004‚Äìpresent) *Paul Winterhart ‚Äì drums, percussion (1995‚Äì1999, 2004‚Äìpresent) *Harry Broadbent ‚Äì keyboards, piano, organ, backing vocals (2006‚Äìpresent) ; Former members *Jay Darlington ‚Äì keyboards, piano, organ, mellotron (1995‚Äì1999) ;Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:200 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/05/1995 till:01/01/2017 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:voc value:red legend:Vocals id:gtr value:green legend:Guitar id:keys value:purple legend:Keyboards id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:drum value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1996 BarData = bar:Crisp text:\\"Crispian Mills\\" bar:Darlin text:\\"Jay Darlington\\" bar:Harry text:\\"Harry Broadbent\\" bar:Bevan text:\\"Alonza Bevan\\" bar:Winter text:\\"Paul Winterheart\\" PlotData= width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:Crisp from:01/05/1995 till:01/09/1999 color:gtr bar:Crisp from:01/05/1995 till:01/09/1999 color:voc width:3 bar:Crisp from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2017 color:gtr bar:Crisp from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2017 color:voc width:3 bar:Darlin from:01/05/1995 till:01/09/1999 color:keys bar:Harry from:01/02/2006 till:01/01/2017 color:keys bar:Bevan from:01/05/1995 till:01/09/1999 color:bass bar:Bevan from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2017 color:bass bar:Winter from:01/05/1995 till:01/09/1999 color:drum bar:Winter from:01/01/2004 till:01/01/2017 color:drum LineData = at:16/09/1996 color:black layer:back at:08/03/1999 color:black layer:back at:27/06/2007 color:black layer:back at:28/06/2010 color:black layer:back at:12/02/2016 color:black layer:back  Discography  *K (1996) *Peasants, Pigs & Astronauts (1999) *Strangefolk (2007) *Pilgrims Progress (2010) *K 2.0 (2016)  References  External links * Official Site English rock music groups Britpop groups Brit Award winners ","title":"Kula Shaker"},{"id":"599985","title":"Tab (drink)"},{"id":"599988","text":"Hujjat al-Islam (from ·∏•ujjat-u l-IslƒÅm) (also Hojatoleslam) is an honorific title meaning \\"authority on Islam\\" or \\"proof of Islam\\".

Accessed 6 January 2016. the son of Gwendolyn (Burrows) and Gordon Stigwood, an electrical engineer. He was educated at Sacred Heart College in Adelaide.Late Port Pirie-raised music mogul Robert Stigwood who changed the entertainment world The Advertiser, 5 January 2016. Accessed 6 January 2016. Joe Meek and John Leyton Stigwood found a job in an institution for \\"backward teenage boys\\" in East Anglia after his arrival in England. He worked briefly for Hector Ross at the New Theatre Royal in Portsmouth, Hampshire, before Ross left and the theatre closed. Around this time he met the young Paul Jones who would later front Manfred Mann. He then met businessman Stephen Komlosy with whom he founded Robert Stigwood Associates Ltd, a small theatrical agency. The brief partnership between Robert Stigwood Associates and Joe Meek is claimed to have changed the British recording industry to a great extent. A poor business decision had meant that \\"Angela Jones\\" by Michael Cox, released on Meek's own Triumph label, could not be manufactured in sufficient quantities to meet demand after Cox performed the song on a popular TV music show. While the record did make an appearance in the Top Ten, it proved that Meek needed the support of a major record company. Meek's first single with John Leyton, a cover of Ray Peterson's U.S. hit \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\", was released in the U.K. in August 1960. Originally intended for release on Meek's Triumph label, that label had by now folded and the recording was instead leased to the Top Rank label, owned by the Rank Organisation and distributed by EMI. EMI's Columbia label had however issued another British cover version of the song by Ricky Valance, and due to better promotion by the record company, this version was more successful. A follow-up single by Leyton, \\"Girl on the Floor Above\\" (October 1960), was largely overlooked by British audiences. According to Tony Kent (Meek's personal assistant at the time), the session took place at London's IBC Studios, largely at Meek's suggestion, and although Meek was present at the recording, Stigwood assumed the role of dominant co-producer. Leyton's third single, \\"Johnny Remember Me\\", produced by Meek and released in the U.K. on 28 July 1961, became a massive U.K. No.1 hit after Stigwood arranged for Leyton to play the part of a fictional pop singer called Johnny St. Cyr performing the song on the new Associated Television drama Harpers West One. Business deal with EMI Other artists Stigwood signed to a management/recording deal included Mike Sarne, whose Komlosy-produced \\"Come Outside\\" charted Number One in 1962, and another Meek prot√©g√©, Mike Berry, who had scored a hit with the Geoff Goddard-penned \\"Tribute To Buddy Holly\\". He was understood to be gay.Keith Stern Queers in History, Dallas, TX: BenBella Books, 2009, p. 434 Despite the severe legal situation in Britain until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalised homosexual acts in private, it would not have been a disadvantage for Stigwood's career, as other important figures in the music industry were also gay. Some Australian music writers have suggested that the main reason why so few Australian acts were able to break into the UK music scene in the 1960s was that they were locked out by the so- called \\"Pink Mafia\\" that supposedly dominated British show business. One of the first acts he managed during this period was Junco Partners, a blues band which succeeded the Animals as the house band at Newcastle's Club A Go Go. The band recorded for Columbia (the EMI label) and the French Barclay Records, with one of its first releases being co-produced by Stigwood and Vicki Wickham. The band included Charlie Harcourt, later of Lindisfarne and Cat Mother and the All Night News Boys. Diversification The next development in Stigwood's career as a manager came several weeks after his connection with NEMS began. Teenage vocal group the Bee Gees had just returned to the UK, after many years in Australia, with hopes of a career in the UK. Within months their first international single, \\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\\", had become a major British and American hit reaching the top 20 in both markets, while \\"Massachusetts\\" reached number 1 in the UK and number 11 in the US, continuing a string of Bee Gees hits through the late 1960s. Also during 1967, Stigwood purchased a controlling interest in Associated London Scripts, a writers' agency co-founded by Spike Milligan and Eric Sykes around 1954, in which many of Britain's best comedy and television scriptwriters had been involved. Beryl Vertue from ALS was appointed as deputy chairman; Vertue was responsible for selling the formats to American producers of the TV series All in the Family and Sanford and Son, which were adapted from the popular British TV shows Till Death Us Do Part and Steptoe and Son.\\"Coupling is back! ‚Äì Biography ‚Äì Beryl Vertue (executive producer)\\", BBC Press Office, 16 June 2004 =Robert Stigwood Organisation= Later Stigwood produced stage versions of his other successful film musicals, Saturday Night Fever and Grease; while Grease had existed as a musical before Stigwood's involvement in the film, Stigwood's adaptations added the musical numbers that were original to that film. Stage rights to those numbers are still available for licensing through the Stigwood estate. Later successes and disappointments Stigwood moved into film and TV production in the early 1970s. By this time the fortunes of his pop production enterprises had declined greatly, and both his major acts struggled to regain their former glory. The Bee Gees broke up briefly in 1970, and after reuniting they floundered for several years, reaching a self-acknowledged \\"rock bottom\\" period in the early 1970s, by which time the former chart toppers had been reduced to playing the working men's club circuit in the north of England. Cream had split up in late 1968, although lead guitarist Eric Clapton remained signed to RSO, but his next project, the highly touted supergroup Blind Faith, which united Clapton and Ginger Baker with Steve Winwood (ex Traffic) and Ric Grech (ex Family) fizzled out after just one LP. Clapton made a promising solo debut with his critically praised self-titled 1970 album, and followed this by forming a new band, Derek & the Dominos, with ex-members of Delaney and Bonnie's backing group. They recorded an ambitious double-album with considerable input from Duane Allman, whom Clapton met and befriended. Although Layla & Other Assorted Love Songs (1970) is now acknowledged as his masterpiece, the album's relatively poor critical and commercial reception was overshadowed by the tragic deaths of Eric Clapton's close friends Jimi Hendrix (who died while the sessions were underway) and the subsequent death of Allman himself in October 1971. These tragedies, combined with the angst of his unrequited love for Patti Boyd, sent Clapton into a downward spiral of depression and drug abuse. Derek & the Dominos broke up before a second album could be completed, Clapton withdrew from performing and he became addicted to heroin for several years. Fortunately, Clapton eventually kicked his habit, and Stigwood took him back to Miami, where he recorded his very successful comeback album 461 Ocean Boulevard (1974), which included his US #1 hit version of Bob Marley's \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\". With his music ventures in the doldrums, Stigwood expanded into film production in the early 1970s with great success. His first feature was a hit screen adaptation of Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), made in association with its director, Norman Jewison. He followed this with the film version of the Who's Tommy (1975), which became one of the most successful films at the box office in its year of release. RSO Films' next production, Saturday Night Fever, dramatically catapulted the Bee Gees to superstardom, taking them back to the top of the charts in dramatic fashion, scoring them three consecutive No.1 hits. The film also launched TV actor John Travolta to international stardom.Caryn James \\"Critics Notebook; As Praise Flows, Travolta Awaits His 3rd Comeback\\", The New York Times, 2 December 2004 The 2-LP soundtrack album, written by and featuring the Bee Gees, became the biggest selling soundtrack album ever released. Stigwood followed this with another hugely successful film adaptation of one of his stage productions, the rock'n'roll musical Grease (1978), which co-starred Travolta and Australian singer Olivia Newton- John, which featured additional material by expatriate Australian songwriter- producer John Farrar. Not all of Stigwood's films were popular. Moment by Moment (also 1978), which co-starred Travolta and Lily Tomlin was panned by critics, and is credited with turning Travolta into 'box office poison'.Ron Weiskind \\"Movies: Who's a has-been and who still has it in Hollywood\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (magazine), 22 April 2001 Other notable films produced by Stigwood include The Fan (1981), Grease 2, Peter Weir's well received Gallipoli (1981), produced under the R&R; Films banner - the other \\"R\\" being another Australian known for his ruthlessness, Rupert Murdoch - and the 1997 Golden Globe Awards best film winner, Evita, starring Madonna. In 1975, RSO collaborated with Bob Banner Associates to produce a stunt game show, Almost Anything Goes. The program, which aired on the ABC network in the United States, featured three teams of players from small towns in a competition where the emphasis was on good will. The show lasted four seasons. = Later years = Robert Stigwood remained active in his later years, primarily in musical theatre.

PSE affects approximately one in 4,000 people (5% of those with epilepsy).  Signs and symptoms  People with PSE experience epileptiform seizures upon exposure to certain visual stimuli. The exact nature of the stimulus or stimuli that triggers the seizures varies from one patient to another, as does the nature and severity of the resulting seizures (ranging from brief absence seizures to full tonic‚Äìclonic seizures). Many PSE patients experience an \\"aura\\" or feel odd sensations before the seizure occurs, and this can serve as a warning to a patient to move away from the trigger stimulus. The visual trigger for a seizure is generally cyclic, forming a regular pattern in time or space. Flashing lights or rapidly changing or alternating images (as in clubs, around emergency vehicles, near overhead fans, in action movies or television programs, etc.) are examples of patterns in time that can trigger seizures, and these are the most common triggers. Static spatial patterns such as stripes and squares may trigger seizures as well, even if they do not move. In some cases, the trigger must be both spatially and temporally cyclic, such as a certain moving pattern of bars. Several characteristics are common in the trigger stimuli of many people with PSE. The patterns are usually high in luminance contrast (bright flashes of light alternating with darkness, or white bars against a black background). Contrasts in colour alone (without changes in luminance) are rarely triggers for PSE. Some patients are more affected by patterns of certain colours than by patterns of other colours. The exact spacing of a pattern in time or space is important and varies from one individual to another: a patient may readily experience seizures when exposed to lights that flash seven times per second, but may be unaffected by lights that flash twice per second or twenty times per second. Stimuli that fill the entire visual field are more likely to cause seizures than those that appear in only a portion of the visual field. Stimuli perceived with both eyes are usually much more likely to cause seizures than stimuli seen with one eye only (which is why covering one eye may allow patients to avoid seizures when presented with visual challenges). Some patients are more sensitive with their eyes closed; others are more sensitive with their eyes open. Sensitivity is increased by alcohol consumption, sleep deprivation, illness, and other forms of stress. = Television = Television has traditionally been the most common source of seizures in PSE. For people with PSE, it is especially hazardous to view television in a dark room, at close range, or when the television is out of adjustment and is showing a rapidly flickering image (as when the horizontal hold is incorrectly adjusted on analog television sets). Modern digital television sets that cannot be maladjusted in this way and which refresh the image on the screen at very high speed present less of a risk than older, analog television sets. Some people with PSE, especially children, may exhibit an uncontrollable fascination with television images that trigger seizures, to such an extent that it may be necessary to physically keep them away from television sets. Some people (particularly those with cognitive impairments, although most people with PSE have no such impairments) self-induce seizures by waving their fingers in front of their eyes in front of bright light or by other means. UK television broadcasters require all screen content to pass an Automated PSE and QC test. Previously, the Harding FPA Test was used to assess content, however this has been replaced by software such as Vidchecker. Ofcom regularly updates their definition of a flashing sequence. This is an objective standard of assessment of potential to trigger seizures in the susceptible population. This test is not currently required internationally. = Fluorescent lighting = When functioning correctly, mains-powered fluorescent lighting has a flicker rate sufficiently high (twice the mains frequency, typically 100 Hz or 120 Hz) to reduce the occurrence of problems. However, a faulty fluorescent lamp can flicker at a much lower rate and trigger seizures. Newer high-efficiency compact fluorescent lamps (CFL) with electronic ballast circuits operate at much higher frequencies (10‚Äì20 kHz) not normally perceivable by the human eye, though defective lights can still cause problems.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis may be made by noting the correlation between exposure to specific visual stimuli and seizure activity. More precise investigation can be carried out by combining an EEG with a device producing Intermittent Photic Stimulation (IPS). The IPS device produces specific types of stimuli that can be controlled and adjusted with precision. The testing physician adjusts the IPS device and looks for characteristic anomalies in the EEG, such as photoparoxysmal response (PPR), that are consistent with PSE and/or may herald the onset of seizure activity. The testing is halted before a seizure actually occurs. Sometimes diagnostic indicators consistent with PSE can be found through provocative testing with IPS, and yet no seizures may ever occur in real-life situations. Many people will show PSE-like abnormalities in brain activity with sufficiently aggressive stimulation, but they never experience seizures and are not considered to have PSE.  Treatment and prognosis  No cure is available for PSE, although the sensitivity of some people may diminish over time. Medical treatment is available to reduce sensitivity, with sodium valproate being commonly prescribed. Patients can also learn to avoid situations in which they might be exposed to stimuli that trigger seizures and/or take steps to diminish their sensitivity (as by covering one eye) if they are unavoidably exposed. These actions together can reduce the risk of seizures to almost zero for many PSE patients.  Epidemiology  PSE affects approximately one in 4,000 people, or 5% of individuals with epilepsy. It is more common in women and people who are younger.  Society and culture  = Law = A law requiring PSE warnings be displayed on packages and stores was passed by the State of New York. = Games = The first case of epileptiform seizures related to a video game was reported in 1981. Since then, \\"many cases of seizures triggered by video games were reported, not only in photosensitive, but also in nonphotosensitive children and adolescents with epilepsy.....Specific preventive measures concerning the physical characteristics of images included in commercially available video games (flash rate, choice of colours, patterns, and contrast) can lead in the future to a clear decrease of this problem.\\" Risks can be reduced through measures such as keeping a safe distance away from the screen (at least 2 meters). While computer displays in general present very little risk of producing seizures in PSE patients (much less risk than that presented by television sets), video games with rapidly changing images or highly regular patterns can produce seizures, and video games have increased in importance as triggers as they have become more common. Some people with no prior history of PSE may first experience a seizure while playing a video game. Often the sensitivity is very specific, e.g., it may be a specific scene in a specific game that causes seizures, and not any other scenes. Despite this, there are questions on the dangers of this, and calls for testing all video games for causing PSE. = Web design = As with video games, rapidly changing images or highly regular patterns such as flashing banner ads or irregular fonts can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. Two sets of guidelines exist to help web designers produce content that is safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy: * The World Wide Web Consortium - Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.0, produced in 2008, specifies that content should not flash more than 3 times in any 1 second period. However it does allow flashing above this rate if it is below the \\"general and red flashing thresholds\\", which means if the effect is small or low-contrast enough it is acceptable. * In the United States, websites provided by federal agencies are governed by section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. The Act says that pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and less than 55 Hz. = Public attention = Photosensitive epilepsy was again brought to public attention in December 1997 when the Pok√©mon episode \\"Denn≈ç Senshi Porygon\\" (\\"Cyber Soldier Porygon\\") was broadcast in Japan, showing a sequence of flickering images that triggered seizures simultaneously in hundreds of susceptible viewers (although 12,000 children reported symptoms which may be attributable to mass hysteria). In March 1997, the 25th episode of an anime series called YAT Anshin! Uch≈´ Ryok≈ç caused a similar incident, when a reported four children were taken to hospitals by ambulances after viewing a scene with red and white flashing colours. In March 2008, the Anonymous group of hackers was claimed to be behind an attack on a forum for epilepsy sufferers. The Anonymous hackers in turn blamed the Church of Scientology for the attacks, saying they were falsified to hurt Anonymous' image. The attacks first consisted of GIF images flashing at high speeds that were hidden in discussion threads with innocuous- sounding titles. Later attacks redirected web browsers to a page with \\"a more complex image designed to trigger seizures in both photosensitive and pattern- sensitive epileptics.\\" The technology website Wired News considered it to be \\"possibly the first computer attack to inflict physical harm on the victims\\". An animated segment of a film promoting the 2012 Summer Olympics was blamed for triggering seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy. The charity Epilepsy Action received telephone calls from people who had seizures after watching the film on television and online. In response, the London 2012 Olympic Committee removed the offending segment from its website. In December 2016, Newsweek journalist Kurt Eichenwald, who has epilepsy, reportedly had a seizure after an internet troll sent him intentionally via Twitter a flashing GIF. Three months later, the user behind the GIF was arrested and charged with cyberstalking. The 2018 Pixar film Incredibles 2 contains scenes with flashing lights starting about an hour into the film, in which a villain called the Screenslaver hypnotizes other characters. After concerns over possible triggering of seizures due to this scene, theatres posted warnings for audiences with this condition.  See also  * Reflex seizure  References  * .

Based on the Bombardier Global Express ultra long range business jet, it was adapted by Raytheon to meet the RAF's requirements. Originally known as the ASTOR (Airborne STand-Off Radar) programme the aircraft is operated by a RAF squadron manned by both air force and army personnel. The Sentinel is interoperable with other allied systems such as JSTARS and the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) system. In 2010 the UK Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's Strategic Defence and Security Review announced its intention to \\"withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground surveillance aircraft once it is no longer required to support operations in Afghanistan.\\" Sentinel has supported the British Army in Afghanistan.

Design and development A close-up of the Sentinel's radar pod. ZJ690 on trials in 2007 A Sentinel R1 taking off from RAF Akrotiri in support of Operation Shader. ASTOR has its roots in the British Army's Corps Airborne Stand-Off Radar (CASTOR) programme which in 1984 modified a Britten-Norman Islander (G-DLRA/ZG989) with a large nose radome for battlefield surveillance. The 1991 Gulf War confirmed the requirement for such an aircraft, but the end of the Cold War made funding difficult. The production contract was signed in December 1999 with a projected in-service date of 2005. The Sentinel R1 is a modified Bombardier Global Express powered by two Rolls-Royce BR700 turbofan engines. The programme involved five aircraft and eight mobile ground stations (six on wheeled all terrain vehicles and two in air transportable containers), and a training facility at RAF Waddington. The programme cost ¬£850 million, as budgeted. The support contract is for 3200 flying hours per year and between 2015‚Äì18 the fleet of five aircraft will have average running costs of ¬£54.4m/year. The Sentinel cockpit has a centrally housed, pull-down screen capable of displaying a moving map, Link 16 datalink information and defensive aids subsystem (DASS) data. The DASS comprises a towed radar decoy, missile approach warning system and chaff and flare dispensers and can be operated in automatic, semi-automatic or manual mode. The aircraft normally operates at over to ensure a high resolution view of a large battlefield area. It is crewed by a pilot, a co- pilot, an Airborne Mission Commander (AMC) and two image analysts. Mission endurance is approximately nine hours. While the image analysts can analyse the images on board the aircraft it is expected that, unlike the JSTARS, the actual battle management will occur on the ground. The main radar is a Raytheon dual-mode synthetic aperture radar / moving target indication (SAR/MTI) radar known as Sentinel Dual Mode Radar Sensor (DMRS). It uses AESA active electronically scanned arrayAirborne Stand-Off Reconnaissance (ASTOR) technology. Raytheon claim it could be modified to match the maritime surveillance capability of the cancelled Nimrod MRA4, and the ground stations could be adapted to receive data from Watchkeeper, MQ-9 Reaper and the future Scavenger programme. A contract for the development of a maritime capable software upgrade will be placed in the spring of 2015; Jane's speculates that this would allow the Sentinel to detect surface vessels and potentially submarine periscopes and that other sensors could be fitted as a 'low-end' capability for maritime surveillance to complement a 'high-end' platform such as the P-8A Poseidon. Operational history The first flight of the modified prototype, which validated the modifications required for the ASTOR system, was in August 2001. The first production Sentinel R1 made its 4.4-hour maiden flight on 26 May 2004. The aircraft entered operational service with 5 Squadron of the Royal Air Force based at RAF Waddington\\"ASTOR Enters Service\\". Air International, Vol 76 No. 1, January 2009. p. 5. and flew its first operational sortie over Afghanistan on 15 Nov 2008. In 2010 the UK government's Strategic Defence and Security Review announced its intention to \\"withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground surveillance aircraft once it is no longer required to support operations in Afghanistan.\\" Sentinel has supported the British Army in Afghanistan. Its role above Libya in 2011 was described as \\"pivotal\\" by the head of the RAF. In February 2012 it was announced that Sentinel would be offered as the UK contribution to NATO's Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) collaboration, complementing NATO RQ-4 Global Hawks and French Heron TPs. On 25 January 2013, the British Government announced that the RAF would deploy one Sentinel aircraft from RAF Waddington, in support of Operation Newcombe in Mali. On 14 February 2014, it was reported that the Sentinel was used to map the scale of flooding in Southern England. On 18 May 2014, the MoD announced that a Sentinel had departed to Ghana as part of Operation Turus to assist in the search for the 223 schoolgirls abducted by the Islamic militant group Boko Haram in Nigeria on 14 April 2014. In 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron announced the retention of the aircraft, even after operations end in Afghanistan in fall 2018. On 26 March 2015, the MOD announced the deployment of two Sentinel aircraft in support of Operation Shader to provide surveillance to coalition forces fighting as part of the Military intervention against ISIL. It was announced that the fleet would be cut to four aircraft with effect from 1 April 2017 and the service date extended to 2021.

He served as the first leader of the now- defunct Christian Heritage Party, stepping down in 2003. In 2005 he was convicted of multiple sexual offences against girls under 12 years of age and sentenced to nine years imprisonment. He was released on parole in August 2011, having served six years of that sentence. Early life Capill was born in western Africa, his parents being Christian missionaries. Most of his youth was spent in New Zealand, mainly in the city of Christchurch. He was educated at Middleton Grange School, a large evangelical Protestant school in that city, where his father, Donald Capill, was vice-principal for most of the 1970s, and which his brothers, David, Murray and Timothy, also attended. Capill went to work in the aviation industry, and qualified as a pilot and an avionics engineer. Later, Capill decided to become a minister, and studied towards a Bachelor of Divinity degree at the Reformed Theological College in Geelong, Australia. He gained his degree in 1986. He returned to New Zealand to complete an internship at Wellington, and became a minister of the Reformed Church of Dunedin in 1988. By June 1998 he was attending an Anglican church in Christchurch, but described himself as Presbyterian by conviction. Capill gained a law degree from the University of Canterbury in 1997. Capill and his wife Judith have ten children. Christian Heritage Party The Christian Heritage Party, founded in 1989, held its first convention in 1990. Capill was appointed the new party's leader in June of that year. He remained leader of the party through five elections, but the party failed to win any seats. Capill announced his retirement shortly after the 2002 general election, and stepped down in 2003. He was succeeded as party leader by Ewen McQueen. In November 2004 Capill resigned from the Christian Heritage citing differences of opinion over the party's new direction since his retirement.https://web.archive.org/web/20120616035747/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=10404090 Police work After leaving politics, he was employed as a dispatcher in the Southern Communications Centre of the New Zealand Police. Within a year he had been moved to be a police prosecutor at the Christchurch District Court, but was stood down in early 2005 pending criminal charges. Trial and imprisonment  On 23 March 2005 Capill appeared in the Christchurch District Court charged with indecently assaulting a girl aged under 12. On leaving the court he was assaulted (\\"punched and left whimpering on the ground\\") by local sickness beneficiary Daniel McNally, a former boxer. The media referred to Capill, who was then under a name-suppression order, as \\"a prominent New Zealander\\". McNally, who had no previous connection to the case, received a two-year prison sentence for the assault. On 1 April 2005 name suppression was lifted and Capill pleaded guilty to a charge of indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl on four occasions. These events took place between the years of 2001 and 2002, while Capill was leader of Christian Heritage. His activities were brought to an end by the Rev Wally Behan, vicar of St John's Anglican Church, Latimer Square, Christchurch, the church which the Capill family attended. Behan was acting on information received from some of the victims. Further charges of rape and indecent assault against girls aged under 12 (committed during the 1990s) followed. As Capill had strongly condemned \\"sexual perversion\\" throughout his political career, the revelations had particular impact. Capill's conduct was swiftly condemned by Christian Heritage.http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO0504/S00013.htm On 28 June 2005 Capill entered guilty pleas on a further three charges of indecent assault, one of rape, and one of unlawful sexual connection, all committed against girls under the age of 12. Newspaper reports now describe him as \\"a sexual predator\\", and he was remanded in custody while awaiting sentencing. On 14 July 2005 Capill was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years. Prior to his sentencing, he sent an e-mail to supporters, asking for forgiveness and that they pray for a light sentence, also claiming that the sex with one of the young girls was \\"consensual\\". His lawyer said that the e-mail, intended to gain sympathy and support, backfired and was ill-advised. Judge Kerr said the email sent by Capill to supporters demonstrated he had yet to fully appreciate the enormity of his offending. On 16 August he appealed the sentence to the dismay of his critics. The appeal was abandoned on 31 January 2006. Capill had earned a law degree before the revelation of his offending. On 9 August 2006, he was forbidden to practise law and fined $3123 at a disciplinary hearing (although Capill had never practised law privately, and described his legal studies as a \\"hobby\\"). Concerns were raised that Capill's wife and children might be unfairly burdened by this latest development, due to his inability to earn income as a prisoner. Later that year, Capill complained that Rolleston Prison guards were interfering with photocopying and access to a university tutor for his Massey University papers, and not letting him swap children's diaries with his wife. However, another Rolleston Prison inmate who was also studying Massey University papers at the same time as Capill argued that prison guards behaved similarly toward other inmates. On 3 October 2006, his successor, Ewen McQueen, announced the dissolution of Christian Heritage New Zealand, blaming Capill's conviction and disgrace for its demise. In April 2008, there was public opposition when it was revealed that Capill was due to appear at a Parole Board hearing in June 2008. On 27 June 2008, it was reported that Capill's parole application had been unsuccessful due to opposition from his victims who felt there had been insufficient preventative counselling, and that the Department of Corrections and Rolleston Prison would not enroll him on Kia Marama, a child sexual abuse prevention education and counselling course, until he had served two-thirds of his sentence (circa 2011). www.paroleboard.govt.nz He was granted parole in August 2011 after having completed the nine-month Kia Marama child-sex offenders programme and having been \\"assessed as posing a low/medium long term risk of sexual reoffending\\". However, as with other paroled and released sexual offenders, there are a number of conditional aspects to Capill's release. He will be required to report to a parole officer when dealing with accommodation and employment concerns and will experience restricted mobility and autonomy in those contexts. He is forbidden from communicating with his former victims and associating with anyone under sixteen unless there are approved adult caregivers in the vicinity.  After release  Capill now lives in Christchurch; his sentence ended in June 2014.http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/9066581/Capill-attacker-in-fresh- scuffle See also *Christian politics in New Zealand References 1959 births Living people Leaders of political parties in New Zealand University of Canterbury alumni Christian Heritage Party of New Zealand politicians Christian Coalition (New Zealand) politicians New Zealand rapists Unsuccessful candidates in the 1996 New Zealand general election People convicted of indecent assault Protestant religious leaders convicted of crimes Unsuccessful candidates in the 1999 New Zealand general election Unsuccessful candidates in the 2002 New Zealand general election New Zealand politicians convicted of crimes ","title":"Graham Capill"},{"id":"600026","text":"Terry Southern (May 1, 1924 ‚Äì October 29, 1995) was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and university lecturer, noted for his distinctive satirical style. Part of the Paris postwar literary movement in the 1950s and a companion to Beat writers in Greenwich Village, Southern was also at the center of Swinging London in the 1960s and helped to change the style and substance of American films in the 1970s. He briefly wrote for Saturday Night Live in the 1980s. Southern's dark and often absurdist style of satire helped to define the sensibilities of several generations of writers, readers, directors and film goers. He is credited by journalist Tom Wolfe as having invented New Journalism with the publication of \\"Twirling at Ole Miss\\" in Esquire in February 1963. Southern's reputation was established with the publication of his comic novels Candy and The Magic Christian and through his gift for writing memorable film dialogue as evident in Dr. Strangelove, The Loved One, The Cincinnati Kid, and The Magic Christian. His work on Easy Rider helped create the independent film movement of the 1970s. Terry Southern's yearbook photo from North Texas Agricultural College Biography Southern was born in Alvarado, Texas. He graduated from Sunset High School in Dallas, Texas in 1941. He attended North Texas Agricultural College for a year as a pre-med major before transferring to Southern Methodist University, where he continued to cultivate his interest in literature. From 1943 to 1945, he served in the U.S. Army as a demolitions technician during World War II. Stationed in Reading, England with the 435th Quartermaster Platoon (allowing for frequent forays to London), he earned a Bronze Star and a Good Conduct Medal. In the autumn of 1946, he resumed his studies at the University of Chicago before transferring to Northwestern University, where he received his undergraduate degree in philosophy in 1948. =Paris, 1948‚Äì1952= Southern left the United States in September 1948, using a G.I. Bill grant to travel to France, where he studied at the Facult√© Des Lettres of the Sorbonne. His four- year stint in Paris was a crucial formative influence, both on his development as a writer and on the evolution of his \\"hip\\" persona. During this period he made many important friendships and social contacts as he became a central figure in the expatriate American caf√© society of the 1950s. He became close friends with Mason Hoffenberg (with whom he subsequently co-wrote the novel Candy), Alexander Trocchi, John Marquand, Mordecai Richler, Aram Avakian (filmmaker, photographer and brother of Columbia Records jazz producer George Avakian), and jazz musician and motorsport enthusiast Allen Eager. He also met expatriate American writer James Baldwin and leading French intellectuals Jean Cocteau, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus. Southern frequented the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in Paris and saw jazz performances by leading bebop musicians including Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell, Thelonious Monk, and Miles Davis, evoked in his classic \\"You're Too Hip, Baby\\". During the early 1950s he wrote some of his best short stories, including \\"The Butcher\\" and \\"The Automatic Gate\\", both published in David Burnett's New-Story magazine. His story \\"The Accident\\" was the first short story published in the Paris Review in its founding issue (1953); it was followed by \\"The Sun and the Still-born Stars\\" in issue #4.The Paris Review. Southern became closely identified with the Paris Review and its founders, Peter Matthiessen, Harold L. \\"Doc\\" Humes, and George Plimpton, and he formed a lifelong friendship with Plimpton. He met French model Pud Gadiot during 1952; a romance soon blossomed and the couple married just before they moved to New York City. =Greenwich Village, 1953‚Äì1956= In 1953, Southern and Gadiot returned to the US and settled in Greenwich Village in New York City. As he had in Paris, Southern quickly became a prominent figure on the artistic scene that flourished in the Village in the late 1950s. He met visual artists such as Robert Frank, Annie Truxell and Larry Rivers. Through Mason Hoffenberg, who made occasional visits from Paris, he was introduced to leading beat writers including Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso. He frequented renowned New York jazz venues such as the Five Spot, the San Remo, and the Village Vanguard. It was in this period that Southern read and became obsessed with the work of British writer Henry Green. Green's writing exerted a strong influence on Southern's early work, and Green became one of Southern's most ardent early supporters. Southern struggled to gain recognition during this period, writing short stories as he worked on Flash and Filigree, his first solo novel. Most of these stories were rejected by leading magazines and journals. Here, as in Paris, Southern was almost entirely supported by his wife Pud, but their relationship fell apart within a year of their arrival in New York and they were divorced in mid-1954. During 1954 and 1955. Southern met two of his literary heroes, William Faulkner and Nelson Algren. Southern interviewed Algren for the Paris Review in the autumn of 1955. They kept in touch after the interview, and Algren became another of Southern's early friends and champions. Southern's fortunes began to change after he was taken on by the Curtis-Brown Agency in mid-1954; through them he had three of his short stories accepted by Harper's Magazine. It published \\"The Sun and the Still- born Stars\\" and \\"The Panthers\\" in the same edition in late 1955, and \\"The Night Bird Blew for Doctor Warner\\" was featured in the January 1956 edition. In October 1955, Southern met model and aspiring actress Carol Kauffman and were married on July 14, 1956.Hill, pp. 51‚Äì67. =Geneva, 1956‚Äì1959= Southern returned to Europe with Kauffman in October 1956, stopping off in Paris then settling in Geneva, Switzerland, where they lived until 1959. Kauffman took a job with UNESCO, which supported them as Southern continued to write. The years in Geneva were a prolific period during which he prepared Flash and Filigree for publication, and worked on Candy and The Magic Christian as well as TV scripts and short stories. The couple made trips to Paris, where they visited Mason Hoffenberg, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs, and to London, where Southern met Henry Green and Kenneth Tynan. During his time in New York, Southern had written a short story \\"about a girl in Greenwich Village who got involved with a hunchback because she was such a good Samaritan\\" and this became the core of Candy, co-written with Mason Hoffenberg. On his return to Paris in late 1956, Southern showed the story to several people, including Hoffenberg, who thought the character should have more adventures. Southern encouraged Hoffenberg to write one; this became the sequence where Candy goes to the hospital to see Dr. Krankheit. The pair began alternately creating chapters, working together regularly on visits to Tourrettes-sur-Loup over the spring and summer of 1957. The book was introduced to publisher Maurice Girodias, probably by Marilyn Meeske, who, according to Southern, thought Girodias would be interested in it as a \\"dirty book\\".\\"Interview with a Grand Guy\\", Lee Hill, 1996. Andr√© Deutsch accepted Flash and Filigree, Southern's first novel, early in 1957, and the short story \\"A South Summer Idyll\\" was published in Paris Review No. 15. The Southerns spent some time in Spain with Henry Green during the summer, and Southern interviewed him for the Paris Review. Several more short stories were published later that year, by which time he was finishing work on Candy. Southern and Gregory Corso helped convince Girodias to publish the controversial novel Naked Lunch by then-little-known author William S. Burroughs. In early 1958, Southern made his first foray into screenwriting, working with Canadian director Ted Kotcheff, who had come to Britain to work for the newly established Associated TeleVision (ATV) company. Kotcheff directed Southern's TV adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones, which was broadcast in the UK in March. This coincided with the publication of Flash and Filigree, which was well reviewed in the UK but coolly received in the U.S. The first major magazine interview with Southern, conducted by Elaine Dundy, was published in UK Harper's Bazaar in August 1958. In October Olympia published Candy under the pseudonym Maxwell Kenton, and it immediately was banned by the Paris vice squad. The Magic Christian, Southern's first solo novel, satirically explores the corrupting effects of money. He finished the book in Geneva over the fall and winter of 1958‚Äì1959. and it was published by Andr√© Deutsch in Spring 1959 to mixed reviews; however, it soon gained an avid cult following. By the time it had been published, the Southerns had decided to return to the U.S.; they left Geneva for New York in April 1959.Hill, pp. 69‚Äì91. =East Canaan, 1959‚Äì1962= After moving back to the U.S., the Southerns stayed with friends for several months until they were able to buy their own home. They were looking for a rural retreat close enough to New York to allow Terry to commute there. Southern met and became friendly with jazz musician and bandleader Artie Shaw, and they began looking for properties together. Shaw put down a deposit on a farm in East Canaan, Connecticut, but at the urging of a friend Southern convinced Shaw to let him buy the farm, which he purchased for $23,000. During 1959 and 1960, he continued working on a never-completed novel titled The Hipsters, which he had begun in Geneva. He became part of the New York artists and writers 'salon' of his old friend Plimpton‚Äîwho had also moved back to New York‚Äî frequenting the Cedar Tavern, rubbing shoulders with writers James Jones, William Styron, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, \\"Doc\\" Humes, Jack Gelber, Jules Feiffer, Blair Fuller, Gore Vidal, Kenneth Tynan, the Aga Khan, the cast of the British comedy stage revue Beyond The Fringe, Jackie Kennedy, British actress Jean Marsh, and Tynan's first wife, Elaine Dundy, through whom Southern met satirist Lenny Bruce. Flash and Filigree had been published in the U.S. by Coward McCann in the fall of 1958. Several fragments from The Hipsters were published as short stories during this period, including \\"Red-Dirt Marijuana\\" published, in the January‚ÄìFebruary 1960 edition of Evergreen Review; and \\"Razor Fight\\", published in Glamour magazine. He had an essay on Lotte Lenya published in Esquire. In early 1960, he began writing book reviews for The Nation, which were published over the next two years. During the year, he collaborated with his old Paris friends Alex Trocchi and Richard Seaver, compiling \\"Writers in Revolt,\\" an anthology of modern fiction for the Frederick Fall company. The editing process took much longer than expected: A drug bust led Trocchi to flee to the UK via Canada, leaving Southern and Seaver to finish the book. Terry and Carol's son and only child Nile Southern was born on December 29, 1960. Around this time, Southern began writing for Maurice Girodias' new periodical Olympia Review. He began negotiations with the Putnam company to reissue Candy under his and Hoffenberg's real names, and he hired Sterling Lord as his literary agent, . In the summer of 1962, Southern worked for two months as a relief editor at Esquire, and during this period, he had several stories published in the magazine, including \\"The Road to Axotle\\". Through Esquire, he interviewed rising filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who had completed his controversial screen adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita. Although Southern knew little about Kubrick, the director was well aware of Southern's work, having been given a copy of The Magic Christian by Peter Sellers during the making of Lolita. =Dr. Strangelove= Southern's life and career changed irrevocably on November 2, 1962, when he received a telegram inviting him to come to London to work on the screenplay of Kubrick's new film, which was then in pre-production.Hill, pp. 93‚Äì108. Partly on the recommendation of Peter Sellers, Stanley Kubrick asked Southern to help revise the screenplay of Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964). The film was based on the Cold War thriller Red Alert (1958) by Peter George, the rights to which Kubrick had secured for $3,000. Kubrick and George's original screenplay (which was to be called Edge of Doom) was a straight political thriller. They then reworked it into a satirical format (provisionally titled The Delicate Balance of Terror) in which the plot of Red Alert was situated as a film-within-a-film made by an alien intelligence.\\"The Making of Dr. Strangelove\\" ‚Äì Dr. Strangelove 40th Anniversary DVD edition, special feature. Southern's work on the project was brief but intense; he officially worked on the script from November 16 to December 28, 1962. Southern began to rely on the amphetamine-barbiturate \\"diet pill\\" Dexamyl to keep him going through the frantic rewriting process; in later years, he developed a long-term amphetamine dependency. His amphetamine abuse, combined with his heavy intake of alcohol and other drugs, contributed significantly to health problems in later life. The major change Southern and Kubrick made was to recast the script as a black comedy, jettisoning the \\"film within a film\\" structure. Kubrick, George, and Southern shared the screenplay credits, but competing claims about who contributed what led to confusion and some conflict among the three men after the film's release. The credit question was confused by Sellers' numerous ad libbed contributions‚Äîhe often improvised wildly on set, so Kubrick made sure that Sellers had as much camera 'coverage' as possible during his scenes in order to capture these spontaneous inspirations. In an apparent homage to Southern's birthplace, the movie mentions that the \\"23rd Airborne Division is stationed seven miles away at Alvarado, Texas\\". Burpelson Air Force Base, an important setting of the movie, may allude to nearby Burleson, Texas. According to Art Miller, an independent producer who hired Southern to write the screenplay for a never-completed comic film about the bumbling Watergate burglars, Southern told him that the best example of his writing in Dr. Strangelove was the scene in which B-52 pilot T.J. \\"King\\" Kong, played by Slim Pickens, reads off a list of the contents of a survival kit to his crew, concluding that a man could have \\"a pretty nice weekend in Vegas\\" with some of the items. When the scene was shot, Pickens spoke the scripted line (\\"Dallas\\"), but the word \\" Vegas\\" was overdubbed during post- production because the film was released not long after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas in November 1963.Eric D. Snider, \\"What's the big deal?: Dr. Strangelove (1964)\\"; Seattle Pi, 25 October 2010. According to Miller, Peter Sellers quietly paid Southern tens of thousands of dollars to create some of the best-known comedy bits for Sellers' character Inspector Clouseau in the Pink Panther film series. Southern also helped Sellers with dialogue coaching. Originally slated to play four roles, including that of the Texan B-52 bomber pilot Major Kong, the actor had difficulty mastering the accent. Southern, a native Texan, taped himself speaking Kong's lines for Sellers to study. Sellers, who had never been comfortable in the role of Kong, was able to extricate himself from the part after allegedly fracturing his ankle, forcing Kubrick to re-cast. The part eventually went to actor Slim Pickens, who Kubrick met during his brief stint working on Marlon Brando's One-Eyed Jacks. After the film went into wider release in January 1964, Southern was the subject of considerable media coverage, and erroneously was given primary credit for the screenplay,Hill, p. 124. a misperception he did little to correct. This reportedly angered both Kubrick‚Äîwho was notorious for his unwillingness to share writing creditsHill, p. 126.‚Äîand Peter George, who penned a complaint to Life magazine in response to a lavish photo essay on Southern published in the May 8, 1964 edition. Stung by the article's assertion that Southern was responsible for turning the formerly \\"serious script\\" into an \\"original irreverent satirical film\\", George pointed out that he and Kubrick had been working together on the script for 10 months, whereas Southern was only \\"briefly employed (November 16‚ÄìDecember 28, 1962) to do some additional writing.\\"Hill, pp. 124‚Äì125. Toward the end of his work on Dr. Strangelove, Southern began canvassing for more film work. Jobs he considered included a proposed John Schlesinger screen adaptation of the Iris Murdoch novel A Severed Head, and a project called The Marriage Game, to be directed by Peter Yates and produced by the James Bond team of Harry Saltzman and Cubby Broccoli. He also wrote an essay on John Fowles' novel The Collector, which led to his work as a \\"script doctor\\" on the subsequent screen version. Southern's writing career took off during 1963. His essay \\"Twirlin' at Ole Miss\\" was published in Esquire in February 1963, and this work of satirical reportage is now acknowledged as one of the cornerstone works of New Journalism. This was quickly followed by the publication of several other essays, including the Bay of Pigs-themed \\"Recruiting for the Big Parade\\",\\"I Am Mike Hammer\\". and one of his best Paris stories, \\"You're Too Hip, Baby\\". The fiction anthology Writers In Revolt was published in the spring, soon followed by the U.S. publication of Candy, which became the #2 American fiction best- seller of 1963. =\\"The Big Time\\", 1964‚Äì1970= The success of Dr. Strangelove and the re-published version of Candy was the turning point in Southern's career, making him one of the most celebrated writers of his day. In the words of biographer Lee Hill, Southern spent the next six years in \\"an Olympian realm of glamour, money, constant motion and excitement\\", mixing and working with big literary, film, music, and TV stars in the world. His work on Dr. Strangelove opened the doors to lucrative work as a screenwriter and script doctor, and allowed him to greatly increase his fee, from the reported $2,000 he received for Dr. Strangelove to as much as $100,000 thereafter.Hill, p. 127. During the latter half of the 1960s Southern worked on the screenplays of a string of \\"cult\\" films. His credits in this period include The Loved One (1965), The Collector (1965), The Cincinnati Kid (1965), Casino Royale (1967), Barbarella (1968), Easy Rider (1969), The Magic Christian (1969), and End of the Road (1970) . The Loved One, The Cincinnati Kid In early 1964, Southern was hired to collaborate with British author Christopher Isherwood on a screen adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel The Loved One, directed by British filmmaker Tony Richardson. When filming was postponed in spring of 1964, Southern returned to East Canaan and continued work on a rewrite of the script for the film version of John Fowles' The Collector but he eventually withdrew from the project because he disagreed with the change to the story's ending. In August 1964, the Southerns moved to Los Angeles, where Terry began work on the screenplay of The Loved One, for which MGM/Filmways paid him $3,000 per month. Southern's work and his networking and socializing brought him into contact with many Hollywood stars, including Ben Gazzara, Jennifer Jones, Janice Rule, George Segal, Richard Benjamin, James Coburn, Peter Fonda, and Dennis Hopper and his wife Brooke Hayward. Hopper, a fan and collector of modern art, later introduced Southern to British gallery owner and art dealer Robert Fraser. Not long after arriving in Los Angeles, Southern met Gail Gerber, a young Canadian-born actress and dancer, on the MGM backlot. Gerber, who used the stage name Gail Gilmore, was working as a dancer on an Elvis Presley movie, and she had a non-speaking role in The Loved One. Southern and Gerber soon began an affair. The relationship intensified during July/August 1964, and after Southern's wife and son went back to East Canaan, Southern and Gerber moved in together in a suite at the Chateau Marmont hotel. Working with Richardson and Isherwood, Southern turned Waugh's novel into \\"an all-out attack on Hollywood, consumerism, and the hypocrisies surrounding man's fear of death\\".Hill, p. 134. Southern also wrote the text for a souvenir book, which featured photos by William Claxton. Work on the film continued through most of 1965, with Southern and Gerber spending much of their leisure time with their newfound film star friends in Malibu, California. Loved One co- producer John Calley was a frequent visitor to Southern's Chateau Marmont suite, and he hired Southern to work on several subsequent Filmways projects, including The Cincinnati Kid and Don't Make Waves. Soon after principal shooting on The Loved One was concluded, Southern began work on the script of The Cincinnati Kid, which starred Steve McQueen. He was one of several writers who had worked on versions of the screenplay, including Paddy Chayefsky, George Good, and Ring Lardner Jr.. Original director Sam Peckinpah was fired one week into shooting, allegedly because he shot unauthorized nude scenes. (He did not make another film until 1969's The Wild Bunch.) He was replaced by Norman Jewison, and during his work on this production, Southern formed a close and enduring friendship with cast member Rip Torn. Casino Royale, Barbarella, Candy By 1966, the film adaptations of Ian Fleming's James Bond series, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, had become a successful and popular film franchise. However, the rights to Fleming's first Bond novel Casino Royale had been secured by rival producer Charles K. Feldman. He had attempted to get Casino Royale made as an Eon Productions James Bond film, but Broccoli and Saltzman turned him down. Believing he could not compete with the Eon series, Feldman then decided to shoot the film as a parody, not only of James Bond but of the entire spy fiction genre. The casino segment featuring Peter Sellers and Orson Welles is the only portion based upon the novel. Southern and Gail Gerber moved to London in early 1966, when Southern was hired to work on the screenplay of Casino Royale. The episodic \\"quasi-psychedelic burlesque\\" proved to be a chaotic production, stitched together from segments variously directed or co-directed by a team that included Joseph McGrath, Robert Parrish, Val Guest, John Huston, Richard Talmadge, and Ken Hughes. Many planned scenes could not be filmed due to the feud between Orson Welles and star Peter Sellers, which climaxed with Sellers walking out during the filming of the casino scenes and refusing to return. Many writers contributed to the screenplay, including Southern (who wrote most of the dialogue for Sellers), Woody Allen, Wolf Mankowitz, Michael Sayers, Frank Buxton, Joseph Heller, Ben Hecht, Mickey Rose, and Billy Wilder. Southern had been introduced to Robert Fraser by Dennis Hopper, and when he went to London to work on Casino Royale he and Gail became part of Fraser's \\"jet-set\\" salon that included the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, photographer Michael Cooper, interior designer Christopher Gibbs, model-actress Anita Pallenberg, filmmaker Nicolas Roeg, painter Francis Bacon, producer Sandy Lieberson, Guinness heir Tara Browne, and model Donyale Luna. Southern became close friends with photographer Michael Cooper, who was part of the Rolling Stones' inner circle and who shot the cover photos for the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP. Southern attended the Cannes Film Festival in the spring of 1966, where he met Andy Warhol and Gerard Malanga, and he remained in touch with Malanga for many years. On his return to London he continued work on the Casino Royale screenplay and a screen adaptation of The Magic Christian for Peter Sellers, who was planning his film version. Sandy Lieberson optioned Southern's first novel Flash and Filigree and United Artists optioned Candy. Michael Cooper also introduced Southern to the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, and Southern later encouraged Stanley Kubrick to make his film version of the book after MGM refused to back Kubrick's planned film on Napoleon. Southern and Cooper then began to plan their own film adaptation of the novel, to star Mick Jagger and The Rolling Stones as Alex and his gang of droogs. Through Si Litvinoff, Southern optioned the book for the bargain price of $1,000 (against a final price of $10,000) and Lieberson and David Puttnam set up a development deal with Paramount, who underwrote a draft by Southern and Cooper. Actor David Hemmings was briefly considered for the role of Alex‚Äîmuch to the chagrin of Cooper and the Stones‚Äîand the director's chair was initially offered to Richard Lester, who turned it down. Southern's old friend Ted Kotcheff was then approached, but at this point the project stalled ‚Äì under the British censorship regulations of the time, the treatment had to be submitted to the Lord Chamberlain, who returned it, unread, with a note attached that said: \\"I know this book and there is no way you can make a movie of it. It deals with youthful incitement, which is illegal.\\" As a result, Paramount put it into 'turnaround' and it was eventually picked up by Kubrick three years later. During the frequent downtime during the filming of Casino Royale, Filmways hired Southern to do a \\"tightening and brightening\\" job on the screenplay of the occult thriller Eye of the Devil, which starred David Niven and featured Sharon Tate in her first film role. Through the winter of 1966‚Äì67 he also began work on the screenplay for Roger Vadim's Barbarella, and he contributed to a TV version of The Desperate Hours directed by Ted Kotcheff and starring George Segal and Yvette Mimieux. The June 1, 1967, release of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band gave Southern pop-culture immortality, thanks to his photograph being included (on the recommendation of Ringo Starr) on the album's front-cover collage, which was photographed by Cooper. Soon after, a collection of his short writing Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes, was published in the US. It received favorable reviews from critics, and the cover blurb featured a highly complimentary quote from Gore Vidal, who described Southern as \\"the most profoundly witty writer of our generation\\". Work on Barbarella continued through to late 1967, and Southern convinced Vadim to cast his friend Anita Pallenberg in the role of the Black Queen. In December 1967 the film version of Candy began shooting in Rome with director Christian Marquand. It starred newcomer Ewa Aulin in the title role and like Casino Royale it featured a host of stars in cameo roles, including Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, John Astin, Ringo Starr, Walter Matthau, and Anita Pallenberg. The original screenplay by Southern was rewritten by Buck Henry (who also has an uncredited cameo in the film). Like Casino Royale, it proved to be a chaotic production and failed to live up to expectations; it was generally panned by critics on its release in December 1968 and its impact was further weakened by the financial collapse of its major backer. Easy Rider, The End Of The Road As production on Barbarella wound down in October 1967, director Roger Vadim began shooting his episode of the omnibus film Spirits of the Dead, which co-starred Peter Fonda and Jane Fonda. It was during the making of this film that Peter Fonda told Southern of his desire to make a 'modern Western' in which motorbike riders substituted for cowboys, a concept that had been largely inspired by the success of Roger Corman's influential low-budget \\"exploitation\\" biker films The Wild Angels (1966) and its follow-ups, in which Fonda and his close friend Dennis Hopper had featured. Fonda pitched his idea to Hopper on his return to America, and Southern added his weight to the project, agreeing to work on the script for scale ($350 per week). Southern, Fonda, and Hopper met in New York City in November 1967 to develop their ideas. These brainstorming sessions formed the basis of the screenplay that Southern then wrote from December 1967 to April 1968. On the basis of Southern's treatment, Raybert Productions, which had produced the TV series The Monkees and the Monkees movie Head, agreed to finance the film with a budget of US$350,000 (in return for one- third of the profits), with Columbia Pictures agreeing to distribute the film. Southern eventually shared the writing credit with Hopper and Fonda, but there has been dispute over their various contributions to the screenplay. Hopper and Fonda later tried to downplay Southern's input, claiming that many sections of the film (such as the graveyard scene and the Mardis Gras sequence) had been improvised, whereas others involved in the production (including Southern himself) have asserted that most of these scenes were fully scripted and primarily written by him. Although the basic concept for the film was Fonda's, the title Easy Rider was provided by Southern (it is slang term from the American South for a prostitute's lover who lives off her) and Southern wrote several early drafts of the screenplay. During the production, Southern became concerned at Hopper and Fonda's replacement of his writing by what he described as \\"dumb-bell dialogue\\", and more of the material Southern wrote for the main characters was cut out during the editing process. Also Fonda and Hopper mostly improvised a great deal as they filmed. Southern had originally written the character of the small-town lawyer (played by Jack Nicholson) with his friend Rip Torn in mind, but Torn dropped out of the project after an altercation with Hopper in a New York restaurant, in which the two actors almost came to blows. Southern continued to work on other projects while Easy Rider began shooting‚Äîhe completed his next novel Blue Movie; began working with the painter Larry Rivers on a book project The Donkey and The Darling; he worked on the final drafts of the screenplay for The Magic Christian, and he began discussions with Aram Avakian about a movie project called The End of the Road. In summer 1968, he was approached by Esquire magazine to cover the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Southern attended the event with William S. Burroughs, Jean Genet (a last- minute substitute for Samuel Beckett) and John Sack, and his friend Michael Cooper took photographs; Southern and friends were present when peaceful demonstrations erupted into savage violence after protesters were attacked by police. Southern's essay on the event,\\"Groovin' In Chi\\". was his last work published by Esquire. The editing of Easy Rider continued for many months, as Hopper and Fonda argued over the final form. Hopper ditched a planned score by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young and returned to the group of songs he had used for the rough cut, which included music by The Byrds, Jimi Hendrix, and Steppenwolf. Easy Rider caused a sensation when it was screened in Cannes and it went on to become the fourth highest-grossing American film of 1969, taking $19 million, and receiving two Academy Award nominations. Although it brought Hopper and Fonda great financial and artistic rewards and helped to open up the Hollywood 'system' for young independent producers, little of the profit was shared with Southern, and the true extent of his contributions was repeatedly downplayed by the other principals. Southern's next major screenplay was The End of the Road, adapted from the novel by John Barth and starring Stacy Keach, Dorothy Tristan and James Earl Jones. It was directed by his friend Aram Avakian. The director and the film were the subject of a major spread in Life Magazine in November 1969, which reportedly led to a critical backlash, and the film was savaged on its release, and was especially criticised because of a graphic scene in which the main female character undergoes an abortion, which led to the film being classified with an \\"X\\" rating. The Magic Christian The Magic Christian was one of Peter Sellers' favorite books‚Äîhis gift of a copy to Stanley Kubrick led to Southern being hired for Dr. Strangelove‚Äîand a film version of the book had long been a dream project for the actor, who intended to play the lead role of Guy Grand. In 1968 Southern was hired for the production and he worked on a dozen drafts of the screenplay. Sellers also tinkered with it while Southern was working on The End of the Road. At Sellers' request, a draft by Southern and director Joseph McGrath was re-written by Graham Chapman and John Cleese, two young British TV comedy writers who soon became famous as members of the Monty Python team. Cleese later described McGrath as having \\"no idea of comedy structure\\" and complained that the film ended up as \\"a series of celebrity walk-ons.\\" The film was shot in London between February and May 1969. The cast was headed by Sellers (as Guy Grand) and Ringo Starr as his son Youngman Grand (a new character created for the movie), with cameo appearances by Spike Milligan, Christopher Lee, Laurence Harvey, Raquel Welch, Roman Polanski and Yul Brynner. As with Dr. Strangelove, Sellers habitually improvised on the script during filming. During production McGrath and Southern discussed a future project based on the life of gangster Dutch Schultz, to be made in collaboration with William Burroughs and Alexander Trocchi, but nothing came of it. The Magic Christian ends with a scene in which Grand fills a huge vat with offal and excrement and then throws money into the fetid mixture to demonstrate how far people will go to get money for nothing. The original plan was to film the climactic scene at the Statue of Liberty in New York, and the US National Park Service agreed to the request. Sellers, McGrath and Southern then traveled to New York on the Queen Elizabeth 2 (at a reported cost of $10,000 per person) but the studio then refused to pay for the shoot and it had to be relocated to London. The scene was eventually shot on the South Bank, near the site of the new National Theatre building. The film premiered on February 12, 1970, to lukewarm reviews. =Later career= Southern's pre- eminence waned rapidly in the 1970s‚Äîhis screen credits decreased, his book and story output dwindled, and he acquired a reputation as an out-of-control substance abuser. He continued to drink heavily and take various drugs; in particular, his dependence on Dexamyl badly affected his health as he aged. Biographer Lee Hill suggests that Southern was a functioning alcoholic and that his image was largely based on his occasional public appearances in New York, partying and socializing; in private, he remained a tireless worker. His later career was complicated by ongoing financial woes. In the late 1960s, Southern's spendthrift ways and lack of financial acumen led him into trouble and he was audited by the IRS on several occasions beginning in 1972, resulting in heavy tax bills and penalties. Tax problems dogged him for the rest of his life. In 1968, he signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\", New York Post, January 30, 1968. As revealed by documents released under the Freedom of Information Act, Southern and his wife Carol had been put under surveillance by the FBI starting in 1965. In a 2000 article, Burroughs intimate Victor Bockris (who profiled Southern for Interview) speculated that this surveillance and Southern's \\"IRS harassment\\" (a strategy concurrently employed by the Nixon administration against the more fiscally sound Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg) left him effectively blacklisted by Hollywood, although perceived betrayals from such putatively close friends as Hoffenberg and Hopper vis-√†-vis his longstanding history of substance abuse and tangible opportunities in other media may have played the catalytic role in eroding Southern's efficacy as a writer.Victor Bockris, \\"The Mystery of Terry Southern\\", Gadfly, January/February 2000.  1970s In December 1970, Southern found himself in the position of having to beg Dennis Hopper for a profit point on Easy Rider‚Äîa request Hopper refused. Southern's tenuous financial position was in contrast to that of his creative partners, who became wealthy thanks to the film's commercial success. For the rest of his life, Southern was repeatedly forced to take on work in order to pay tax bills and penalties, and on many occasions he struggled to keep up the mortgage payments on the East Canaan farm. Blue Movie was published in the fall of 1970, with a dedication to Stanley Kubrick. It received only moderate reviews, and sales were hampered by the refusal of the New York Times to run ads for the book. Southern worked on a variety of screenplays in the immediate aftermath Easy Rider, including God Is Love, DJ (based on a book by Norman Mailer), Hand-Painted Hearts (based on a story by Thomas Baum), and Drift with Tony Goodstone. While Fonda and Hopper continued to assert that much of Easy Rider had been improvised, Southern remained largely silent about his role, although he was prompted to write a letter to the New York Times to counter a claim that Jack Nicholson had improvised his speech during the film's campfire scene. Terry and Carol Southern divorced in early 1972 but remained on good terms and Southern continued to support and help raise their son Nile. The IRS investigations had also affected Carol, who had an inheritance from her late father seized as part of Terry's tax settlement. She later became an editor with Crown Publishing, and married critic Alexander Keneas. Southern's other unrealised projects during this period included an adaptation of Nathanael West's A Cool Million, and a screenplay called Merlin, based on Arthurian legend, which was written with Mick Jagger in mind for the lead role. Southern covered the Rolling Stones 1972 American Tour, where he met and began a collaboration with Peter Beard, and they worked sporadically on the never-filmed screenplay The End of the Game until Southern's death. Southern immersed himself in the bacchanalian atmosphere of the tour, and his essay on the Stones tour, \\"Riding The Lapping Tongue\\", was published in the August 12, 1972, edition of Saturday Review. He also wrote a bawdy anti-Nixon skit which was performed at a George McGovern fundraiser, and \\"Twirlin' at Ole Miss\\" was included in The New Journalism. Because of his acute money problems (exacerbated by the IRS affair), Southern took an adjunct lectureship in screenwriting at New York University, where he taught from the fall of 1972 to the spring of 1974; although popular among students, he was ultimately dismissed for holding his classes in a local bar. His students included Amy Heckerling (who directed Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Clueless), literary agent Nancy Nigrosh, and Hollywood biographer Lee Server. Southern began writing for National Lampoon in November 1972 and served on the jury at the 1972 New York Erotic Film Festival with William S. Burroughs, Gore Vidal, and Sylvia Miles. In a 1973 Playboy profile, Mason Hoffenberg (who had conquered his heroin addiction with methadone maintenance and was living in alcoholic codependency with Richard Manuel of The Band near Woodstock, New York) claimed that \\"everything went right for Southern... he was ejaculated to fame and screenplays\\" and \\"Terry Southern is a good rewriter and he writes some funny shit himself, but he always grabs top billing\\"; in an ensuing defamation suit between the erstwhile collaborators, Southern alleged that Hoffenberg's representation had cost him several screenwriting jobs.Sam Merrill, \\"Mason Hoffenberg Gets in a Few Licks\\". From Playboy, November 1973. In 1973 Southern wrote a new screenplay called Double Date, which in some respects anticipated the later David Cronenberg film Dead Ringers, but he eventually abandoned it. In early 1974 John Calley hired Southern to write a screenplay of Blue Movie, with Mike Nichols slated to direct, but the deal eventually fell apart due to a protracted dispute between Warners and Ringo Starr, who then owned the screen rights. A new short story, \\"Fixing Up Ert\\", was published in the September 1974 edition of Oui magazine, and around this time Norwegian director Ingmar Ejve hired Southern to write a screenplay based on the Carl-Henning Wijkmark novel The Hunters of Karin Hall. His friend Ted Kotcheff hired Southern to write the screenplay for the Watergate-themed project A Piece of Bloody Cake, but he was unable to get the script approved. Southern's only on-screen credit during the 1970s was the teleplay Stop Thief!, written for the TV miniseries The American Parade (based on the life of 19th Century American political cartoonist Thomas Nast). Southern once again accompanied the Rolling Stones on their Tour of the Americas '75 and contributed text to a commemorative 1978 coffee table book (The Rolling Stones On Tour) featuring photographs by Annie Leibovitz and Christopher Sykes. In the summer of 1976 Southern visited Rip Torn in New Mexico during the making of Nicolas Roeg's film version of The Man Who Fell to Earth. He made a cameo appearance in the crowd in the scene where Newton is arrested just before he boards his spacecraft. Roeg used an excerpt from The End of the Road on one of the TV screens, in the scene in which Newton watches multiple TV sets at the same time. In 1977 and 1978 Southern was embroiled in a lengthy and chaotic attempt to make a film version of William S. Burroughs' novel Junky, but the project collapsed due to the erratic behaviour of its principal backer, Jules Stein. In August 1978 Southern wrote a skit called \\"Haven Can Wait\\" that was performed by Jon Voight, Allen Ginsberg, Bobby Seale, and Rip Torn at a benefit for Abbie Hoffman. Another unsuccessful project from this period was his work for Si Litvinoff on the screenplay for the opera drama Aria. Southern's script was considered 'below par' and was rejected by Fox. At decade's end, a new story was published in the 20th-anniversary issue of the Paris Review and Blue Movie was optioned once again by Andrew Braunsberg. Southern read from a work in progress (\\"Vignette of Idealistic Life in South Texas\\") at the Nova Convention (a symposium in Burroughs' honor organized by academic Sylvere Lotringer at the East Village's Entermedia Theater in November 1978), opening the second night on a bill that included Philip Glass, Brion Gysin, John Giorno, Patti Smith, and Burroughs himself. Although he continued to reside in northern Connecticut \\"beyond the commuter belt\\", Southern maintained his social life in New York with diligence; longtime girlfriend Gail Gerber often drove him to Studio 54 (where he cultivated a convivial acquaintance with co-owner Steve Rubell), parties hosted by George Plimpton, and other engagements. Following the critical and commercial success of Being There (1979), Peter Sellers had a chance meeting with an arms dealer during an air flight that inspired him to contact Southern and ask him to write a script on the subject of the shady world of the international arms trade. The resulting screenplay, Grossing Out, was reputed to have been of high quality, and Hal Ashby was provisionally attached as director, but the project went into limbo after Sellers' sudden death from a heart attack on 24 July 1980.  1980s Under the pseudonym of Norwood Pratt, Southern co- wrote the 1980 sci fi-themed hardcore pornographic film Randy: The Electric Lady; director Philip Schuman had previously adapted \\"Red Dirt\\" into an award- winning short. A year later, he was hired by Saturday Night Live head writer Michael O'Donoghue (who had solicited contributions from Southern as editor of National Lampoon a decade earlier) to write for the 1981‚Äì82 series of the NBC show in his efforts to revitalize the then-floundering sketch comedy program. This controversial period, which followed the departure of the last members of the original cast and founding producer Lorne Michaels, is widely regarded as the lowest point of the series' history. According to Carol Southern, it was \\"the only job he ever held\\". Despite his longstanding acquaintance with O'Donoghue and his penchant for the alcohol, cocaine and cannabis that flowed liberally backstage, Southern had trouble fitting in stylistically with the younger writers; many of his ideas and sketches were rejected by the staff and new producer Dick Ebersol for being too subtle, sexually gratuitous, or overly political. Nevertheless, Southern facilitated the booking of Miles Davis as musical guest for the October 17 show in support of The Man with the Horn (a significant public appearance following the trumpeter's 1975‚Äì1980 musical interregnum) and arranged for Burroughs‚Äîwho read selections from his oeuvre at a desk‚Äîto appear as a guest performer during the November 7th episode; it was the writer's first appearance on American national television. Southern was retained as a writer for the remainder of the season after O'Donoghue ‚Äî who frequently clashed with the network and Ebersol ‚Äî was fired from the series. Southern's involvement with the show led to a bona fide collaboration with fellow SNL alum Nelson Lyon, who had previously added the unproductive Southern's name to his sketches in a gesture of magnanimity. They developed a project set in and around The Cotton Club in the 1930s, but it was eventually abandoned after Francis Ford Coppola's similarly themed film went into production. During 1982‚Äì83 Southern worked with Kubrick's former production partner James B. Harris on a naval drama called The Gold Crew (later retitled Floaters), but Southern was diverted from this when he began working with close friend Larry Rivers on an independent film project called At Z Beach. In April 1983, he was approached to work on a planned sequel to Easy Rider called Biker Heaven. He had little to do with the script, but he was paid about $20,000, which was several times more than he had earned from the original. Around this time Stanley Kubrick requested some sample dialogue for a planned film adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's book Traumnovelle which was to star Steve Martin, but Southern's bawdy submissions reportedly sabotaged any prospect of further involvement; Kubrick eventually made the film (as Eyes Wide Shut, with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman) shortly before his death in 1999. A new story by Southern was published in High Times in May 1983. Shortly thereafter, Hopper invited Southern to work on a planned biographical film of Jim Morrison which was to be backed by publisher Larry Flynt. Because Flynt did not own the screen rights to Morrison's story, the project collapsed; however, Flynt continued to retain Southern as head speechwriter for his ersatz 1984 presidential campaign. Southern turned 60 in 1984, and his career continued to alternate between promise and disappointment. Flash and Filigree was reissued by Arbor House with a new introduction by Burroughs, and Sandy Lieberson (now at Fox) hired him to work on a script called Intensive Heat, based on the life of jewel thief Albie Baker. During this period, Southern ran into problems with his long-overdue new book (a bildungsroman inspired by his Texas childhood alternatively known as Youngblood, Southern Idyll and Behind the Grassy Knoll) when Putnam demanded the return of the $20,000 advance, precipitating his abandonment of the work. In 1985, Candy and The Magic Christian were reprinted by Penguin and Southern featured prominently in the Howard Brookner documentary Burroughs: the Movie. Hawkeye In October 1985 Southern was appointed as one of the directors of Hawkeye, a production company set up by his friend Harry Nilsson to oversee the various film and multimedia projects in which he was involved. Southern and Nilsson collaborated on several screenplays, including Obits, a Citizen Kane-style story about a journalist investigating the subject of a newspaper obituary, but the script was scathingly reviewed by a studio reader and was never given approval. The only major Hawkeye project to see the light of day was The Telephone. Essentially a one-handed comedy-drama, it depicted the gradual mental disintegration of an out-of-work actor. It was written with Robin Williams in mind but Williams turned it down. Nilsson and Southern then learned that comedian Whoopi Goldberg was keen to take the part and she asked Nilsson and Southern to rewrite it for her. New World Films agreed to produce it and Rip Torn signed on as director. Production began in January 1987, but New World allowed Goldberg to improvise freely on the screenplay. She also replaced Torn's chosen DOP John Alonzo with then-husband Conrad Hall. Torn battled with Goldberg and reportedly had to beg her to perform takes that stuck to the script. A year-long struggle then ensued between Hawkeye and New World/Goldberg over the rights to the final cut. Southern and Torn put together their own version, which screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 1988; New World's version premiered in cinemas later that month to generally poor reviews. The steady salary from Hawkeye was a considerable help to the perennially cash-strapped Southern, but this changed abruptly in late 1989 when Hawkeye folded after Nilsson discovered that secretary-treasurer Cindy Sims had embezzled all the company funds and most of the money Nilsson had earned from his music, leaving him virtually penniless. At this point, Southern still owed the IRS some $30,000 in back taxes and $40,000 in penalties. Apart from The Telephone, Southern's only published new output in the period 1985‚Äì90 was the liner notes for the Marianne Faithfull album Strange Weather and a commentary on the Iran-Contra scandal in The Nation. =Last years= In February 1989 Southern was admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital, where he underwent surgery for stomach cancer. Soon after the surgery he was interviewed by Mike Golden, and excerpts were published in Reflex, Creative Writer, and Paris Review. After he recovered from his surgery, Southern collaborated with cartoonist R. O. Blechman on a project called Billionaire's Ball, based on the life of Howard Hughes. Southern landed a job teaching at the Sundance Screenwriters Lab in the summer of 1989. He also assisted with the preparation and publication of Blinds and Shutters, a book on the photography of his late friend Michael Cooper, edited by Perry Richardson and published in a limited edition of 2000, with copies signed by Paul McCartney, Keith Richards, and Allen Ginsberg. During this time Southern met briefly with Canadian filmmaker David Cronenberg to discuss a planned adaptation of Burroughs' Naked Lunch (which Cronenberg subsequently made) but the meeting was unsuccessful. Southern had no further involvement in the project. In November 1989 he talked with Victor Bockris and the results were published in Interview. His profile was given another small boost by the re- publication of Red-Dirt Marijuana and Other Tastes in 1990. With encouragement from his son Nile, Southern returned to his long-shelved Texas novel. Retitled Texas Summer, it was published in 1992 by Richard Seaver. Southern's last two major articles were published during 1991; a piece on the Texas band ZZ Top appeared in the February edition of Spin, and an article on the Gulf War appeared in The Nation on July 8. During the year Southern was also invited to teach screenwriting at Columbia University's School of the Arts and School of General Studies as an adjunct professor, where he worked until his death. In 1992, he collaborated with Joseph McGrath on a screenplay Starlets (later retitled Festival), which satirized the Cannes Film Festival. During the year Peter Fonda reportedly tried to prevail on Southern to give up any claim on Easy Rider in exchange for a payment of $30,000, but Southern refused. Southern also assisted Perry Richardson with another book based around Michael Cooper's photography, The Early Stones, which was published late in the year. Southern's health deteriorated in the last two years of his life, and he suffered a mild stroke in November 1992. In February 1993, he made his last visit home to Texas, where he attended a commemorative screening of Dr. Strangelove and The Magic Christian at the Dallas Museum of Art. During 1994, he made a series of recordings of readings from his works for a projected tribute project coordinated by producer Hal Willner and Nelson Lyon, but the recording process was complicated by Southern's fragile health and the project remained unreleased until recently. Southern's close friend Harry Nilsson died of a heart attack in January 1994. Later that year, he was commissioned by Little, Brown to write a memoir, but only two chapters were ever completed. In September 1995, Southern received the Gotham Award for lifetime achievement by the Independent Film Producers Association at the age of 71. The Easy Rider controversy reared its head again shortly before Southern's death, when Dennis Hopper alleged during an interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno that Rip Torn had been replaced because he had pulled a knife on Hopper during their argument in New York in 1968. Torn sued Hopper over the remark, and Southern agreed to testify on Torn's behalf. The case brought to light several of Southern's drafts of the Easy Rider screenplay, which effectively ended the dispute over his contributions. In 1995, shortly before his death, Southern hired a new agent and began making arrangements for the republication of Candy and The Magic Christian by Grove. His final project was the text for a 1996 coffee table book about Virgin Records. He appeared at the Yale Summer Writing Program mid-year. Franz Douskey, a creative writer at Yale, told a reporter from the Yale Daily that Southern was giving a non-lecture, trying to gasp through calcified lungs. In October, he made his last media appearance when he was interviewed for a documentary on cult Scottish novelist Alexander Trocchi. On October 25, 1995, Southern collapsed on the steps of Columbia's Dodge Hall while en route to his class. He was taken to the adjacent St. Luke's Hospital, where he died four days later of respiratory failure. According to Bruce Jay Friedman, Southern's final words were \\"What's the delay?\\"https://www.mikesacks.com/bruce-jay-friedman-an-interview/ In early 2003, Southern's archives of manuscripts, correspondence, and photographs were acquired by the New York Public Library. The archives include correspondence and other items from George Plimpton, Allen Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Frank O'Hara, Larry Rivers, William Styron, V.S. Pritchett, Gore Vidal, Abbie Hoffman, and Edmund Wilson, as well as John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and the Rolling Stones.

Although he worked without a microscope, Bichat distinguished 21 types of elementary tissues from which the organs of the human body are composed. He was also \\"the first to propose that tissue is a central element in human anatomy, and he considered organs as collections of often disparate tissues, rather than as entities in themselves\\". Although Bichat was \\"hardly known outside the French medical world\\" at the time of his early death, forty years later \\"his system of histology and pathological anatomy had taken both the French and English medical worlds by storm.\\" The Bichatian tissue theory was \\"largely instrumental in the rise to prominence of hospital doctors\\" as opposed to empiric therapy, as \\"diseases were now defined in terms of specific lesions in various tissues, and this lent itself to a classification and a list of diagnoses\\". Early life and training Bichat was born in Thoirette, Franche-Comt√©. His father was Jean-Baptiste Bichat, a physician who had trained in Montpellier and was Bichat's first instructor. His mother was Jeanne-Rose Bichat, his father's wife and cousin. He was the eldest of four children. He entered the college of Nantua, and later studied at Lyon. He made rapid progress in mathematics and the physical sciences, but ultimately devoted himself to the study of anatomy and surgery under the guidance of Marc-Antoine Petit (1766‚Äì1811), chief surgeon at the H√¥tel-Dieu of Lyon. At the beginning of September 1793, Bichat was designated to serve as a surgeon with the Army of the Alps in the service of the surgeon Buget at the hospital of Bourg. He went home in March 1794, then moved to Paris, where he became a pupil of Pierre-Joseph Desault at the H√¥tel-Dieu, \\"who was so strongly impressed with his genius that he took him into his house and treated him as his adopted son.\\" He took active part in Desault's work, at the same time pursuing his own research in anatomy and physiology. Portrait of Pierre-Joseph Desault (left) and title page from Bichat's Surgical Works of Desault, 2nd ed (right) The sudden death of Desault in 1795 was a severe blow to Bichat. His first task was to discharge the obligations he owed his benefactor by contributing to the support of his widow and her son and by completing the fourth volume of Desault's Journal de Chirurgie, which was published the following year. In 1796, he and several other colleagues also formally founded the Soci√©t√© M√©dicale d'√âmulation, which provided an intellectual platform for debating problems in medicine. Lecturing and research In 1797, Bichat began a course of anatomical demonstrations, and his success encouraged him to extend the plan of his lectures, and boldly to announce a course of operative surgery. At the same time, he was working to reunite and digest in one body the surgical doctrines which Desault had published in various periodical works; of these he composed ≈íuvres chirurgicales de Desault, ou tableau de sa doctrine, et de sa pratique dans le traitement des maladies externes (1798‚Äì1799), a work in which, although he professes only to set forth the ideas of another, he develops them \\"with the clearness of one who is a master of the subject.\\" Title page of Trait√© des membranes In 1798, he gave in addition a separate course of physiology. A dangerous attack of haemoptysis interrupted his labors for a time; but the danger was no sooner past than he plunged into new engagements with the same ardour as before. Bichat's next book, Trait√© des membranes (Treatise on Membranes), included his doctrine of tissue pathology with a distinction of 21 different tissues. As worded by A. S. Weber, His next publication was the Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et la mort (Physiological Researches upon Life and Death, 1800), and it was quickly followed by his Anatomie g√©n√©rale (1801) in four volumes, the work which contains the fruits of his most profound and original researches. He began another work, under the title Anatomie descriptive (1801‚Äì1803), in which the organs were arranged according to his peculiar classification of their functions but lived to publish only the first two volumes. Final years and death The H√¥tel-Dieu of Paris (drawn ) In 1800, Bichat was appointed physician to the H√¥tel-Dieu. \\"He engaged in a series of examinations, with a view to ascertain the changes induced in the various organs by disease, and in less than six months he had opened above six hundred bodies. He was anxious also to determine with more precision than had been attempted before, the effects of remedial agents, and instituted with this view a series of direct experiments which yielded a vast store of valuable material. Towards the end of his life he was also engaged on a new classification of diseases.\\" The Death of Xavier Bichat by Louis Hersent (1817 Salon) On 8 July 1802, Bichat fell in a faint while descending a set of stairs at the H√¥tel-Dieu. He had been spending considerable time examining some macerated skin, \\"and from which, of course, putrid emanations were being sent forth\\", during which he probably contracted typhoid fever; \\"the next day he complained of a violent headache; that night, leeches were applied behind his ears; on the 10th, he took an emetic; on the 15th, he passed into a coma and became convulsive.\\" Bichat died on 22 July, aged 30. Jean-Nicolas Corvisart wrote to the first consul Napoleon Bonaparte: Ten days after this, the French government caused his name, together with that of Desault, to be inscribed on a memorial plaque at the H√¥tel-Dieu. Bichat's grave in the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Bichat was first buried at Sainte-Catherine Cemetery. With the closing of the latter, his remains were transferred to P√®re Lachaise Cemetery on 16 November 1845, followed by \\"a cort√®ge of upwards of two thousand persons\\" after a funeral service at Notre-Dame. Vitalist theory Bichat is considered to have been a vitalist, though in no way an anti-experimentalist: According to Russell C. Maulitz, \\"of the Montpellier vitalists, the clearest influence on Bichat was probably Th√©ophile de Bordeu (1722‚Äì1776), whose widely disseminated writings on the vitalistic interpretation of life fell early into Bichat's hands.\\" Title page of Recherches physiologiques sur la vie et la mort In his Physiological Researches upon Life and Death (1800), Bichat defined life as \\"the totality of those set of functions which resist death\\", adding: Bichat thought that animals exhibited vital properties which could not be explained through physics or chemistry. In his Physiological Researches, he considered life to be separable into two parts: the organic life (\\"\\"; also sometimes called the vegetative system) and the animal life (\\"\\", or animal system). The organic life was \\"the life of the heart, intestines, and the other inner organs.\\" As worded by Stanley Finger, \\"Bichat theorized that this life was regulated through the syst√®me des ganglions (the ganglionic nervous system), a collection of small independent 'brains' in the chest cavity.\\" In contrast, animal life \\"involved symmetrical, harmonious organs, such as the eyes, ears, and limbs. It included habit and memory, and was ruled by the wit and the intellect. This was the function of the brain itself, but it could not exist without the heart, the center of the organic life.\\" According to A. S. Weber, Legacy Title page of Anatomie g√©n√©rale Bichat's main contribution to medicine and physiology was his perception that the diverse body of organs contain particular tissues or membranes, and he described 21 such membranes, including connective, muscle, and nerve tissue. As he explained in Anatomie g√©n√©rale, Bichat did not use a microscope because he distrusted it; therefore his analyses did not include any acknowledgement of cellular structure. Nonetheless, he formed an important bridge between the organ pathology of Giovanni Battista Morgagni and the cell pathology of Rudolf Virchow. Bichat \\"recognized disease as a localized condition that began in specific tissues.\\" Michel Foucault regarded Bichat as the chief architect in developing the understanding of the human body as the origin of illness, redefining both conceptions of the body and disease. Bichat's figure was of great importance to Arthur Schopenhauer, who wrote of the Recherches physiologiques as \\"one of the most profoundly conceived works in the whole of French literature.\\" =Honours= Bichat's statue by David d'Angers at the historic √âcole de Chirurgie in Paris A large bronze statue of Bichat by David d'Angers was erected in 1857 in the cour d'honneur of the √âcole de Chirurgie in Paris, with the support of members of the Medical Congress of France which was held in 1845. Bichat is also represented on the Panth√©on's pediment, of which the bas- relief is D'Angers' work as well. The name of Bichat is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower. George Eliot enthusiastically recounted Bichat's career in her 1872 novel Middlemarch. In Madame Bovary (1856), Gustave Flaubert, himself the son of a prominent surgeon, wrote of a physician character who \\"belonged to the great school of surgery that sprang up around Bichat, to that generation, now extinct, of philosopher-practitioners who, cherishing their art with fanatical passion, exercised it with exaltation and sagacity.\\" Gallery David d'Angers - Fronton du Panth√©on - Bichat.jpgRelief of Bichat on the pediment of the Panth√©on Statue Bichat Promenade Bastion Bourg Bresse 21.jpgStatue by D'Angers in Bourg-en-Bresse Portrait of Marie Francois Xavier Bichat (1771-1802) Wellcome M0011378.jpgPortrait by Choquet Marie Fran√ßois Xavier Bichat (1906) - Veloso Salgado.pngDetail from Veloso Salgado's Medicine Through the Ages, NOVA University Lisbon Zaragoza - Antigua Facultad de Medicina - Medall√≥n - Bichat.jpgBust at the University of Zaragoza College of Medicine Notes References Sources       Further reading  External links  Some places and memories related to Xavier Bichat * Physiological Researches upon Life and Death by Xavier Bichat (1809) 1771 births 1802 deaths People from Jura (department) French physiologists French anatomists French pathologists Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery 18th-century French writers 18th-century male writers 19th-century French writers Vitalists ","title":"Xavier Bichat"},{"id":"600045","text":"Hyperventilation syndrome (HVS), also known as chronic hyperventilation syndrome (CHVS), dysfunctional breathing hyperventilation syndrome, cryptotetany, spasmophilia, latent tetany, and central neuronal hyper excitability syndrome (NHS), is a respiratory disorder, psychologically or physiologically based, involving breathing too deeply or too rapidly (hyperventilation). HVS may present with chest pain and a tingling sensation in the fingertips and around the mouth (paresthesia) and may accompany a panic attack. People with HVS may feel that they cannot get enough air. In reality, they have about the same oxygenation in the arterial blood (normal values are about 98% for hemoglobin saturation) and too little carbon dioxide (hypocapnia) in their blood and other tissues. While oxygen is abundant in the bloodstream, HVS reduces effective delivery of that oxygen to vital organs due to low--induced vasoconstriction and the suppressed Bohr effect. The hyperventilation is self-promulgating as rapid breathing causes carbon dioxide levels to fall below healthy levels, and respiratory alkalosis (high blood pH) develops. This makes the symptoms worse, which causes the person to breathe even faster, which then, further exacerbates the problem. The respiratory alkalosis leads to changes in the way the nervous system fires and leads to the paresthesia, dizziness, and perceptual changes that often accompany this condition. Other mechanisms may also be at work, and some people are physiologically more susceptible to this phenomenon than others. The mechanism for hyperventilation causing Paresthesia, lightheadedness, and fainting is: hyperventilation causes increased blood pH (see Respiratory alkalosis for this mechanism), which causes a decrease in free ionized calcium (Hypocalcaemia), which causes paresthesia and symptoms related to hypocalcaemia. Causes Hyperventilation syndrome is believed to be caused by psychological factors and by definition has no organic cause. It is one cause of hyperventilation with others including infection, blood loss, heart attack, hypocapnia or alkalosis due to chemical imbalances, decreased cerebral blood flow, and increased nerve sensitivity. In one study, one third of patients with HVS had \\"subtle but definite lung disease\\" that prompted them to breathe too frequently or too deeply. A study, found that 77% of patients with empty nose syndrome have hyperventilation syndrome. Empty nose syndrome can appear in people having done nose surgery like cauterization, turbinectomy, turbinoplasty, etc. Many people with panic disorder or agoraphobia will experience HVS. However, most people with HVS do not have these disorders. Diagnosis Hyperventilation syndrome is a remarkably common cause of dizziness complaints. About 25% of patients who complain about dizziness are diagnosed with HVS. A diagnostic Nijmegen Questionnaire provides an accurate diagnosis of Hyperventilation. Treatment There is insufficient evidence for or against breathing exercises. While traditional intervention for an acute episode has been to have the patient breathe into a paper bag, causing rebreathing and restoration of CO‚ÇÇ levels, this is not advised. The same benefits can be obtained more safely from deliberately slowing down the breathing rate by counting or looking at the second hand on a watch. This is sometimes referred to as \\"7-11 breathing\\", because a gentle inhalation is stretched out to take 7 seconds (or counts), and the exhalation is slowed to take 11 seconds. This in-/exhalation ratio can be safely decreased to 4-12 or even 4-20 and more, as the O‚ÇÇ content of the blood will easily sustain normal cell function for several minutes at rest when normal blood acidity has been restored. It has also been suggested that breathing therapies such as the Buteyko Breathing method may be effective in reducing the symptoms and recurrence of the syndrome. Benzodiazepines can be prescribed to reduce stress that provokes hyperventilation syndrome. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can reduce the severity and frequency of hyperventilation episodes. History The original traditional treatment of breathing into a paper bag to control psychologically based hyperventilation syndrome (which is now almost universally known and often shown in movies and TV dramas) was invented by New York City physician (later radiologist), Alexander Winter, M.D. [1908-1978], based on his experiences in the U.S. Army Medical Corps during World War II and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1951. Because other medical conditions can be confused with hyperventilation, namely asthma and heart attacks, most medical studies advise against using a paper bag since these conditions worsen when CO2 levels increase.

He reigned for about 12 years in the early 25th century BC during the Old Kingdom Period. Sahure's reign is considered to mark the political and cultural high point of the Fifth Dynasty. He was probably the son of his predecessor Userkaf with Queen Neferhetepes II, and was in turn succeeded by his son Neferirkare Kakai. During Sahure's rule, Egypt had important trade relations with the Levantine coast. Sahure launched several naval expeditions to modern-day Lebanon to procure cedar trees, slaves and exotic items. His reign may have witnessed the flourishing of the Egyptian navy, which included a high-seas fleet as well as specialized racing boats. Relying on this, Sahure ordered the earliest attested expedition to the land of Punt, which brought back large quantities of myrrh, malachite and electrum. Sahure is shown celebrating the success of this venture in a relief from his mortuary temple which shows him tending a myrrh tree in the garden of his palace named \\"Sahure's splendor soars up to heaven\\". This relief is the only one in Egyptian art depicting a king gardening. Sahure sent further expeditions to the turquoise and copper mines in Sinai. He also ordered military campaigns against Libyan chieftains in the Western Desert, bringing back livestock to Egypt. Sahure had a pyramid built for himself in Abusir, thereby abandoning the royal necropolises of Saqqara and Giza, where his predecessors had built their monuments. This decision was possibly motivated by the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf in Abusir, the first such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. The Pyramid of Sahure is much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty but the decoration and architecture of his mortuary temple is more elaborate. The valley temple, causeway and mortuary temple of his pyramid complex were once adorned by over of exquisite polychrome reliefs, representing the highest form reached by this art during the Old Kingdom period. The Ancient Egyptians recognized this particular artistic achievement and tried to emulate the reliefs in the tombs of subsequent kings and queens. The architects of Sahure's pyramid complex introduced the use of palmiform columns (that is columns whose capital has the form of palm leaves), which would soon become a hallmark of ancient Egyptian architecture. The layout of his mortuary temple was also innovative and became the architectural standard for the remainder of the Old Kingdom period. Sahure is also known to have constructed a sun temple called \\"The Field of Ra\\", and although it is yet to be located it is presumably also in Abusir. Sahure was the object of a funerary cult, the food offerings for which were initially provided by agricultural estates set up during his reign. This official, state-sponsored cult endured until the end of the Old Kingdom. Subsequently, during the Middle Kingdom period, Sahure was venerated as a royal ancestor figure but his cult no longer had dedicated priests. During the New Kingdom, Sahure was equated with a form of the goddess Sekhmet for unknown reasons. The cult of \\"Sekhmet of Sahure\\" had priests and attracted visitors from all over Egypt to Sahure's temple. This unusual cult, which was celebrated well beyond Abusir, persisted up until the end of the Ptolemaic period nearly 2500 years after Sahure's death.  Family  = Parentage = The Westcar Papyrus, dating to the Seventeenth Dynasty but probably first written during the 12th Dynasty, tells the myth of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty. Excavations at the pyramid of Sahure in Abusir under the direction of Miroslav Verner and Tarek El-Awady in the early 2000s provide a picture of the royal family of the early Fifth Dynasty. In particular, reliefs from the causeway linking the valley and mortuary temples of the pyramid complex reveal that Sahure's mother was queen Neferhetepes II. She was the wife of pharaoh Userkaf, as indicated by the location of her pyramid immediately adjacent to that of Userkaf, and bore the title of \\"king's mother\\". This makes Userkaf the father of Sahure in all likelihood. This is further reinforced by the discovery of Sahure's cartouche in the mortuary temple of Userkaf at Saqqara, indicating that Sahure finished the structure started most probably by his father. This contradicts older, alternative theories according to which Sahure was the son of queen Khentkaus I, believed to be the wife of the last pharaoh of the preceding Fourth Dynasty, Shepseskaf and a brother to either Userkaf or Neferirkare. alt=Large figure of a king standing and holding a staff. On the left, two rows of small figures with hieroglyphs detailing their names. = Children = Sahure is known to have been succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai, who until 2005 was believed to be his brother. That year, a relief originally adorning the causeway of Sahure's pyramid and showing Sahure seated in front of two of his sons, Ranefer and Netjerirenre, was discovered by Verner and another Egyptologist, Tarek El-Awady. Next to Ranefer's name the text \\"Neferirkare Kakai king of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" had been added, indicating that Ranefer was Sahure's son and had assumed the throne under the name \\"Neferirkare Kakai\\" at the death of his father. Since both Ranefer and Netjerirenre are given the titles of \\"king's eldest son\\", Verner and El-Awady speculate that they may have been twins with Ranefer born first. They propose that Netjerirenre may have later seized the throne for a brief reign under the name \\"Shepseskare\\", although this remains conjectural. The same relief further depicts queen Meretnebty, who was thus most likely Sahure's consort and the mother of Ranefer and Netjerirenre. Three more sons, Khakare, Horemsaf, and Nebankhre are shown on reliefs from Sahure's mortuary temple, but the identity of their mother(s) is unknown. Netjerirenre bore several religious titles corresponding to high-ranking positions in the court and which suggest that he may have acted as a vizier for his father. This is debated, as Michel Baud points out that at the time of Sahure, the eviction of royal princes from the vizierate was ongoing if not already complete.  Reign  = Chronology = Cartouche of Sahure on the Abydos king list  Relative chronology  The relative chronology of Sahure's reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidences, which agree that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai. An historical source supporting this order of succession is the Aegyptiaca (Œë·º∞Œ≥œÖœÄœÑŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ¨), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283 ‚Äì 246 BC) by Manetho. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Africanus wrote that the Aegyptiaca mentioned the succession \\"Usercher√™s ‚Üí Sephr√™s ‚Üí Nefercher√™s\\" at the start of the Fifth Dynasty. Usercher√™s, Sephr√™s (in Greek, Œ£œµœïœÅŒÆœÇ), and Nefercher√™s are believed to be the Hellenized forms for Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare, respectively. Manetho's reconstruction of the early Fifth Dynasty is in agreement with those given on two more historical sources, the Abydos king list where Sahure's cartouche is on the 27th entry, and the Saqqara Tablet where Sahure's name is given on the 33rd entry. These lists of kings were written during the reigns of Seti I and Ramses II, respectively.  Reign length  The Turin canon, a king list written during the Nineteenth Dynasty in the early Ramesside era (1292‚Äì1189 BC), credits him with a reign of twelve years five months and twelve days. In contrast, the near contemporary royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone records his second, third, fifth and sixth years on the throne as well as his final 13th or 14th year of reign and even records the day of his death as the 28th of Shemu I, which corresponds to the end of the ninth month. Taken together these pieces of informations indicate that the royal annal of the Fifth Dynasty recorded a reign of 13 years 5 months and 12 days for Sahure, only one year more than given by the Turin Canon and close to the 13 years figure given in Manetho's Aegyptiaca. Sahure appears in two further historical records: on the third entry of the Karnak king list, which was made during the reign of Thutmose III (1479‚Äì1425 BC) and on the 26th entry of the Saqqara Tablet dating to the reign of Ramses II (1279‚Äì1213 BC). Neither of these sources give his reign length. The absolute dates of Sahure's reign are uncertain but most scholars date it to the first half of the 25th century BC, see note 1 for details. = Foreign activities =  Trade and tribute  Relief of Sahure from the Wadi Maghareh. Historical records and surviving artifacts suggest that contacts with foreign lands were numerous during Sahure's reign. Furthermore, these contacts seem to have been mostly economic rather than military in nature. Reliefs from his pyramid complex show the return of a naval expedition to Lebanon, the boats laden with the trunks of precious cedar trees. Other ships are represented loaded with \\"Asiatics\\", both adults and children who were either slaves, or merchants, greeting Sahure: The same relief strongly suggests that interpreters were onboard the ships, tasked with translations to facilitate trade with foreign lands. A relief, unique to Egyptian art, depicts several Syrian brown bears, presumably brought back from the Levantine coast by seagoing ships as well. These bears appear in association with 12 red-painted one-handled jars from Syria. The Egyptologists Karin Sowada and William Stevenson Smith have proposed that, taken together, the bears and jars are likely to constitute a tribute. Trade contacts with Byblos took place during Sahure's reign. Excavations of the temple of Baalat- Gebal yielded an alabaster bowl inscribed with Sahure's name. The layout of the fourth phase of this temple might even have been influenced by the architecture of Sahure's valley temple, although this remains debated. There is further corroborating evidence for trade with the wider Levant during the Fifth Dynasty, several stone vessels being inscribed with cartouches of pharaohs of this dynasty discovered in Lebanon. So much so that the archeologist Gregory Mumford points to the fact that \\"Sahure is [the] best attested [king] for international relations\\" and has the highest number of texts inscribed in Sinai proportionally to its reign length. In his last year, Sahure sent the first documented expedition to the fabled land of Punt, probably along the Somalian coast. The expedition, which is conjectured to have departed Egypt from the harbor of Mersa Gawasis, is reported on the Palermo Stone where it is said to have come back with 80,000 of an unspecified measure of myrrh, along with malachite, 6000 measures of electrum and 2600 or 23,020 staves, possibly made of ebony. In his last year Sahure sent another expedition abroad, this time to the copper and turquoise mines of Wadi Maghareh and Wadi Kharit in Sinai, which had been active since at least the beginning of the Third Dynasty. This expedition, also mentioned by the Palermo stone, brought back over 6000 units of turquoise to Egypt and produced two reliefs in Sinai, one of which shows Sahure in the traditional act of smiting Asiatics and boasting \\"The Great God smites the Asiatics of all countries\\". In parallel with these activities, diorite quarries near Abu Simbel were exploited throughout Sahure's reign.  Military campaigns  Silver cylinder seal of king Sahure, Walters Art Museum. Sahure's military career is known primarily from reliefs in his mortuary complex. It apparently consisted of campaigns against Libyans from Tjemehu, a land possibly located in the northern Western desert. These campaigns are said to have yielded livestock in huge numbers and Sahure is shown smiting local chieftains. The historical veracity of these depictions remains in doubt as such representations are part of the standard iconography meant to exalt the king. The same scene of the Libyan attack was used two hundred years later in the mortuary temple of Pepi II (2284 ‚Äì 2184 BC) and in the temple of Taharqa at Kawa, built some 1800 years after Sahure's lifetime. In particular, the same names are quoted for the local chieftains. Therefore, it is possible that Sahure too was copying an even earlier representation of this scene. Nonetheless, several overseers of the Western Nile Delta region were nominated by Sahure, a significant decision as these officials occupied an administrative position that existed only irregularly during the Old Kingdom period and which likely served to provide \\"traffic regulation across the Egypto-Libyan border\\". At the same time, Sahure's mortuary temple presents the earliest known mention of pirates raiding the Nile Delta, possibly from the coast of Epirus. Sahure's pretensions regarding the lands and riches surrounding Egypt are encapsulated in several reliefs from his mortuary temple which show the god Ash telling the king \\"I will give you all that is in this [Libya] land\\", \\"I give you all hostile peoples with all the provisions that there are in foreign lands\\" and \\"I grand thee all western and eastern foreign lands with all the Iunti and the Montiu bowmen who are in every land\\". = Activities in Egypt =  Religious activities  Sahure might have visited Elephantine early in his reign. The majority of Sahure's activities in Egypt recorded on the Palermo stone are religious in nature. This royal annal records that in the \\"year of the first time of traveling around\\", Sahure journeyed to the Elephantine fortress, where he may have received the submission of the Nubian chiefs in a ceremonial act connected with the commencement of his reign. The fashioning of six statues of the king as well as the subsequent opening of the mouth ceremonies are also reported. During Sahure's fifth year on the throne, the Palermo stone mentions the making of a divine barge, possibly in Heliopolis, the appointment of 200 priests and the exact quantity of daily offerings of bread and beer to Ra (138, 40 and 74 measures in three temples), Hathor (4 measures), Nekhbet (800 measures) and Wadjet (4800 measures) fixed by the king. Also reported are gifts of lands to temples of between 1 and 204 arouras (0.7 to nearly 140 acres). Concerning Lower Egypt, the stone register corresponding to this reign gives the earliest known mention of the city of Athribis in the Delta region. Further indication of religious activities lies in that Sahure is the earliest known king to have used the Egyptian title of Nb √≠rt-·∏´t. This title, possibly meaning \\"Lord of doing effective things\\", indicates that he personally performed physical cultic activities to ensure the existence and persistence of the Maat, the Egyptian concept of order and justice. This title remained in use until the time of Herihor, some 1500 years later. Sahure's reign is also the earliest during which the ceremony of the \\"driving of the calves\\" is known to have taken place. This is significant in the context of the progressive emergence of the cult of Osiris throughout the Fifth Dynasty, as this ceremony subsequently became an integral part of the Osiris myth. In subsequent times, the ceremony corresponded to Seth's threshing of Osiris by driving calves trampling fields of barley. Sahure reorganized the cult of his mother Nepherhetepes II, whose mortuary complex had been built by Userkaf in Saqqara. He added an entrance portico with four columns to her temple, so that the entrance was not facing Userkaf's pyramid anymore.  Building and mining activities  A statue of Sahure was uncovered in Elkab, which may have been the starting point of mining expeditions during his reign. Archeological evidences suggest that Sahure's building activities were mostly concentrated in Abusir and its immediate vicinity, where he constructed his pyramid and where his sun temple is probably located. Also nearby was the palace of Sahure, called Uetjes Neferu Sahure, \\"Sahure's splendor soars up to heaven\\". The palace is known from an inscription on beef tallow containers discovered in February 2011 in Neferefre's mortuary temple. A second palace, \\"The Crown of Sahure appears\\", is known from an inscription in the tomb of his chief physician. Both palaces, if they were different buildings, were likely on the shores of the Abusir lake. The stones for Sahure's buildings and statues were quarried throughout Egypt. For example, the limestone cladding of the pyramid comes from Tura, while the black basalt used for the flooring of Sahure's mortuary temple comes from Gebel Qatrani, near the Faiyum in Middle Egypt. South of Egypt, a stele bearing Sahure's name was discovered in the diorite quarries located in the desert north-west of Abu Simbel in Lower Nubia. Further mining and quarrying expeditions may be inferred from indirect evidence. An inscription of Sahure in the Wadi Abu Geridah in the Eastern desert as well as other Old Kingdom inscriptions there suggest that iron ore was mined in the vicinity since the times of the Fourth Dynasty. The lower half of a statue with the name of the king was discovered in 2015 in Elkab, a location possibly connected with expeditions to the Eastern desert and south of Egypt to Nubia. Sahure's cartouche has been found in graffiti in Tumas and on seal impressions from Buhen at the second cataract of the Nile in Lower Nubia.  Development of the Egyptian Navy  Relief from Sahure's mortuary temple showing the Egyptian fleet returning from the Levant Sahure's reign may have been a time of development for the Egyptian navy. His expeditions to Punt and Byblos demonstrate the existence of a high seas navy and reliefs from his mortuary complex are described by Shelley Wachsmann as the \\"first definite depictions of seagoing ships in Egypt\\", some of which must have been 100-cubits long (c. 50 m, 170 ft). Because of this, Sahure has been credited by past scholars with establishing the Egyptian navy. It is recognized today that this is an overstatement: fragmentary reliefs from Userkaf's temple depict numerous boats, while a high seas navy must have existed as early as the Third Dynasty. The oldest known sea harbor, Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea was operating under Khufu. Finally, there is the distinct possibility that some of the reliefs are copied from earlier examples. Nonetheless, Sahure remains the earliest known ruler to have depicted, and thus possibly made use of, sea power for transporting troops over the Mediterranean sea, to Syria. The extensive nautical scenes from Sahure's mortuary complex are sufficiently detailed to show that specialized racing boats for the military and perhaps for ceremonial training were built at the time. They also give the earliest depiction of specific rope uses aboard ships, such as that of a hogging-truss. They permit precise estimates regarding ship building, for example indicating that the mid-ship freeboard for seagoing vessels was of , and that the masts employed at the time were bipodal, resembling an inverted Y. Further rare depictions include the king standing in the stern of a sailing boat with a highly decorated sail, and one of only two reliefs from ancient Egypt showing men aboard a ship paddling in a wave pattern, possibly during a race. = Court life = Niankhsekhmet and his wife shown on his false door, carved and painted in the presence of Sahure  Officials  Several high officials serving Sahure during his lifetime are known from their tombs as well as from the decoration of the mortuary temple of the king. Niankhsekhmet, chief physician of Sahure and first known rhinologist in history, reports that he asked the king that a false door be made for his [Niankhsekhmet's] tomb, to which the king agreed. Sahure had the false door made of fine Tura limestone, carved and painted blue in his audience-hall, and made personal daily inspections of the work. The king wished a long life to his physician, telling him: A similar though much less detailed anecdote is reported by Khufuankh, who was overseer of the palace and singer of the king. Other officials include Hetepka, who was keeper of the diadem and overseer of the hairdressers of the king, Pehenewkai, priest of the cult of Userkaf during the reigns of Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai, then vizier for the latter; Persen, a mortuary priest in the funerary cult of Sahure's mother Nepherhetepes; and Washptah, a priest of Sahure, then vizier of Neferirkare Kakai. The high-official Ptahshepses, probably born during the reign of Menkaure, was high priest of Ptah and royal manicure under Sahure, later promoted to vizier by Nyuserre Ini. Two viziers of Sahure are known: Sekhemkare, royal prince, son of Khafre and vizier under Userkaf and Sahure; and Werbauba, vizier during Sahure's reign, attested in the mortuary temple of the king.  Evolution of the high offices  Werbauba on Sahure's royal hunt relief Sahure pursued Userkaf's policy of appointing non-royal people to high offices. This is best exemplified by the office of vizier, which was exclusively held by princes of royal blood with the title of \\"King's son\\" since the mid-Fourth Dynasty and up until the early Fifth Dynasty. Toward the end of this period princes were progressively excluded from the highest office, an evolution undoubtedly correlated with changes in the nature of kingship. This process, possibly initiated by Menkaure because of dynastic disputes, seems to have been completed by Sahure's time as from then onwards no royal prince was promoted to vizier. Those already in post were allowed to keep their status and so in the early part of Sahure's reign vizier Sekhemkare was a \\"King's son\\" while his successor, Werbauba, seems to have been non-royal. In response to this change, the state administration began its expansion as it included more and more non royal people. Concurrently with these developments, architectural and artistic innovations relating to tombs of private individuals can be dated to Sahure's reign. These including torus molding and cornices for false doors, first found in Persen's tomb. This feature would subsequently become common and here demonstrates the particularly high esteem in which Persen must have been held by the king. Another innovation is the depiction of small unusual offerings such as that of seven sacred oils on false doors, first found in Niankhsekhmet's tomb. The canonical list of offerings was also developed during or shortly before Sahure's time in the tombs of the royal family, and spread to those of non-royal high-officials‚Äîthe earliest of whom was Seshemnefer I‚Äîunder Sahure.  Sun temples  =Sekhetre= Sahure built or started to build a temple dedicated to the sun god Ra, the second such temple of the Fifth Dynasty. Yet to be located, it is known to have existed thanks an inscription on the Palermo stone where it is called Sekhetre (also spelt Sekhet Re), meaning \\"The Field of Ra\\" as well as mentions of it in 24 tombs of administration officials. A few limestone blocks bearing reliefs which once adorned the temple have been found embedded in the walls of the mortuary complex of Nyuserre Ini, Sahure's fourth successor. This suggests either that these blocks were leftovers from the construction of the temple, or as Wener Kaiser has posited, that Nyuserre dismantled Sahure's temple, using it as a quarry for construction materials because it was largely unfinished. Indeed, the rather meager evidence for the Sekhetre leads Miroslav Verner to propose that it never fully functioned as a sun temple. New analyses of the verso of the Palermo stone performed in 2018 by the Czech Institute of Archeology enabled the reading of further inscriptions mentioning precisely the architecture of the temple as well as lists of donations it received, establishing firmly that it was a distinct entity from the earlier sun temple of Userkaf, the Nekhenre but leaving its ultimate fate uncertain. Further precision as to the architecture of the temple may be inferred from the absence of the obelisk determinative in some hieroglyphic variants of the name Sekhetre and its presence in others. For Anthony Spalinger this possibly indicates that Sahure's sun temple was effectively built and acquired such an obelisk at some point after its construction, perhaps after Sahure's reign. = Nekhenre = Userkaf was the first king to build a sun temple in Abusir. Known to the ancient Egyptians as the Nekhenre, or \\"Fortress of Re\\", it was unfinished at his death. Construction works continued in at least four building phases, the first of which may have taken place under Sahure, and then under his successors Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini.  Pyramid complex  The ruined pyramid of Sahure as seen from the pyramid's causeway Sahure built a pyramid complex for his tomb and funerary cult, named Khaba Sahura, which is variously translated as \\"The Rising of the Ba Spirit of Sahure\\", \\"The Ba of Sahure appears\\", \\"Sahure's pyramid where the royal soul rises in splendor\\", or \\"In glory comes forth the soul of Sahure\\". The builders and artisans who worked on Sahure's mortuary complex lived in an enclosed pyramid town located next to the causeway leading up to Sahure's pyramid and mortuary temple. The town later flourished under Nyuserre and seem to have still been in the existence during the First Intermediate Period. In terms of size, volume, and of the cheap construction techniques employed Sahure's pyramid exemplifies the decline of pyramid building. At the same time, the quality and variety of the stones employed in other parts of the complex increased, and the mortuary temple is considered to be the most sophisticated one built up to that time. With its many architectural innovations, such as the use of palmiform columns, the overall layout of Sahure's complex would serve as the template for all mortuary complexes constructed from Sahure's reign until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, some 300 years later. The highly varied colored reliefs decorating the walls of the entire funerary complex display a quality of workmanship and a richness of conception that reach their highest level of the entire Old Kingdom period. = Location = Sahure chose to construct his pyramid complex in Abusir, thereby abandoning both Saqqara and Giza, which had been the royal necropolises up to that time. A possible motivation for Sahure's decision was the presence of the sun temple of Userkaf, something which supports the hypothesis that Sahure was Userkaf's son. Following Sahure's choice, Abusir became the main necropolis of the early Fifth Dynasty, as pharaohs Neferirkare Kakai, Neferefre, Nyuserre Ini and possibly Shepseskare built their pyramids there. In their wake, many smaller tombs belonging to members of the royal family were built in Abusir, with the notable exceptions of those of the highest-ranking members, many of whom chose to be buried in Giza or Saqqarah. = Mortuary temple = Nome deities and personified agricultural estates marching into the mortuary temple of Sahure with offerings Sahure's mortuary temple was extensively decorated with an estimated of fine reliefs. This extensive decoration seems to have been completed within Sahure's lifetime. The walls of the entire -long causeway were also covered with polychrome bas-reliefs. Miroslav B√°rta describes the reliefs as \\"the largest collection known from the third millennium BCE\\". Many surviving fragments of the reliefs which decorated the walls of the mortuary complex are of very high quality and much more elaborate than those from preceding mortuary temples. Several of the depictions are unique in Egyptian art. These include a relief showing Sahure tending a myrrh tree (Commiphora myrrha) in his palace in front of his family; a relief depicting Syrian brown bears and another showing the bringing of the pyramidion to the main pyramid and the ceremonies following the completion of the complex. The high craftmanship of the reliefs is here manifested by the finely rounded edges of all figures, so that they simultaneously blend in with the background and stand out clearly. Reliefs are sufficiently detailed to permit the identification of the animals shown, such as hedgehogs and jerboas, and even show personified plants such as corn represented as a man with corn-ears instead of hair. The many reliefs of the mortuary, causeway and valley temples also depict, among other things, Sahure hunting wild bulls and hippopotamuses, Sahure being suckled by Nekhbet, the earliest depictions of a king fishing and fowling, a counting of foreigners by or in front of the goddess Seshat, which Egyptologist Mark Lehner believes was \\"meant to ward off any evil or disorder\\", the god Sopdu \\"Lord of the Foreign Countries\\" leading bound Asiatic captives, and the return of an Egyptian fleet from Asia, perhaps Byblos. Some of the low relief-cuttings in red granite are still in place at the site. Among the seminal innovations of Sahure's temple are the earliest relief depictions of figures in adoration, either standing or squatting with both arms raised, their hands open and their palms facing down. The mortuary temple featured the first palmiform columns of any Egyptian temple, massive granite architraves inscribed with Sahure's titulary overlaid with copper, lion-headed waterspouts, black basalt flooring and granite dados. = Pyramid = A massive pink granite architrave inscribed with Sahure's titulary, from the courtyard of his mortuary temple. The pyramid of Sahure reached at the time of its construction, much smaller than the pyramids of the preceding Fourth Dynasty. Its inner core is made of roughly hewn stones organized in steps and held together in many sections with a thick mortar of mud. This construction technique, much cheaper and faster to execute than the stone-based techniques hitherto employed, fared much worse over time. Owing to this, Sahure's pyramid is now largely ruined and amounts to little more than a pile of rubble showing the crude filling of debris and mortar constituting the core, which became exposed after the casing stones were stolen in antiquity. While the core was under construction, a corridor was left open leading into the shaft where the grave chamber was built separately and later covered by leftover stone blocks and debris. This construction strategy is clearly visible in later unfinished pyramids, in particular the Pyramid of Neferefre. This technique also reflects the older style from the Third Dynasty seemingly coming back into fashion after being temporarily abandoned by the builders of the five great pyramids at Dahshur and Giza during the Fourth Dynasty. The entrance at the north side is a short descending corridor lined with red granite followed by a passageway ending at the burial chamber with its gabled roof comprising large limestone beams of several tons each. Today all of these beams are fractured, which weakens the pyramid structure. Fragments of a basalt sarcophagus, likely Sahure's, were found here in the burial chamber when it was first entered by John Shae Perring in the mid 19th century. The mortuary complex immediately around the pyramid also includes a second smaller cult pyramid which must have stood nearly high, originally built for the Ka of the king.  Legacy  Palmiform columns, an innovation of Sahure's temple, became a hallmark of Egyptian architecture. = Artistic and architectural = The painted reliefs covering the walls of Sahure's mortuary temple were recognized as an artistic achievement of the highest degree by the Ancient Egyptians. A New Kingdom inscription found in Abusir for example poetically compares the temple to the heaven lit by full moon. Subsequent generations of artists and craftsmen tried to emulate Sahure's reliefs, using them as templates for the tombs of later kings and queens of the Old Kingdom period. The layout of Sahure's high temple was also novel and it became the standard template for all subsequent pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom. Some of its architectural elements, such as its palmiform columns, became hallmarks of Egyptian architecture. This trend continued to hold in later times. For example, in the Middle Kingdom, Senusret I had reliefs for his temple directly copied from those of Sahure. He also chose to follow the innovative layout of Sahure's complex once again. At the time, Senusret I's decision was in stark contrast with the burial customs of the 11th Dynasty pharaohs, who were buried in saff tombs. These consisted of an open courtyard fronting a row of entrances into subterranean corridors and chambers dug in the hillsides of El-Tarif and Deir el-Bahari, near Thebes. = Cults =  Old Kingdom  Sahure was the object of a funerary cult from the time of his death and which continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, some 300 years later. At least 22 agricultural estates were established to produce the goods necessary for providing the offerings to be made for this cult. Decorated reliefs from the upper part of the causeway represent the procession of over 150 personified funerary domains created by and for Sahure, demonstrating the existence of a sophisticated economic system associated with the king's funerary cult. The enormous quantities of offerings pouring into the mortuary and sun temples of Sahure benefitted other cults as well, such as that of Hathor, which had priests officiating on the temple premises. Several priests serving the mortuary cult or in Sahure's sun temple during the later Fifth and Sixth Dynasties are known thanks to inscriptions and artifacts from their tombs in Saqqara and Abusir. These include Tjy, overseer of the sun temples of Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre; Neferkai priest of Sahure's funerary cult; Khabauptah priest of Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre, and Niuserre, Atjema, priest of the sun temple of Sahure during the Sixth Dynasty; Khuyemsnewy, who served as priest of the mortuary cult of Sahure during the reigns of Neferirkare and Nyuserre; Nikare, priest of the cult of Sahure and overseer of the scribes of the granary during the Fifth Dynasty. Further priests are known, such as Senewankh, serving in the cults of Userkaf and Sahure and buried in a mastaba in Saqqara; Sedaug, a priest of the cult of Sahure, priest of Ra in the sun-temple of Userkaf and holder of the title of royal acquaintance; Tepemankh, priest of the cults of kings of the Fourth to early Fifth Dynasty including Userkaf and Sahure, buried in a mastaba at Abusir.  Middle Kingdom  Statue of Sahure enthroned commissioned by Senusret I No priest serving in the funerary cult of Sahure is known from the Middle Kingdom period. Evidence from this period rather come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by 12th Dynasty pharaoh Senusret I (fl. 20th century BC), who dedicated statues of Old Kingdom kings including one of Sahure. The statue and the accompanying group of portraits of deceased kings indicates the existence of a generic cult of royal ancestor figures, a \\"limited version of the cult of the divine\\" as Jaromir M√°lek writes. The statue of Sahure, now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (catalog number CG 42004), is made of black granite and is tall. Sahure is shown enthroned, wearing a pleated skirt and a round curly wig. Both sides of the throne bear inscriptions identifying the work as a portrait of Sahure made on the orders of Senusret I. Sahure's legacy had endured sufficiently by the Middle Kingdom period that he is mentioned in a story of the Westcar Papyrus, probably written during the 12th Dynasty although the earliest extent copy dates to the Seventeenth Dynasty. The papyrus tells the mythical story of the origins of the Fifth Dynasty, presenting kings Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai as three brothers, sons of Ra and a woman named Rededjet destined to supplant Khufu's line.  New Kingdom: emergence of Sekhmet of Sahure  As a deceased king, Sahure continued to receive religious offerings during the New Kingdom as part of the standard cult of the royal ancestors. For example, Sahure is present on the Karnak king list, a list of kings inscribed on the walls of the Akhmenu, the Karnak temple of Thutmose III. Unlike other ancient Egyptian king lists, the kings there are not listed in chronological order. Rather, the purpose of the list was purely religious, its aim being to name the deceased kings to be honored in the Karnak temple. In the second part of the Eighteenth Dynasty and during the Nineteenth Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. These activities were related to a cult then taking place in the mortuary temple of Sahure since the time of Thutmose III. This cult was devoted to the deified king in a form associated with the goddess Sekhmet named \\"Sekhmet of Sahure\\". For example, the scribe Ptahemuia and fellow scribes visited Sahure's temple in the 30th year of Ramses II's reign (c. 1249 BC) to ask Sekhmet to grant them a long life of 110 years. The reason for the appearance of this cult during the New Kingdom is unknown. In any case, the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure was not a purely local phenomenon as traces of it were found in the Upper Egyptian village of Deir el-Medina, where it was celebrated during two festivals taking place every year, on the 16th day of the first month of Peret and on the 11th day of the fourth month of that season. During the same period, prince Khaemwaset, a son of Ramses II, undertook works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples which had fallen into ruin, possibly to appropriate stones for his father's construction projects while ensuring a minimal restoration for cultic purposes. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was the object of such works at this time. This renewed attention had negative consequences as the first wave of dismantlement of the Abusir monuments, particularly for the acquisition of valuable Tura limestone, arrived with it. Sahure's mortuary temple may have been spared at this time due to the presence of the cult of Sekhmet. The cult's influence likely waned after the end of Ramses II's reign, becoming a site of local worship only.  Third intermediate, late and Ptolemaic periods  During the Twenty- fifth Dynasty (744‚Äì656 BC) at the end of the Third Intermediate Period, some of Sahure's temple reliefs were copied by Taharqa, including images of the king crushing his enemies as a sphinx. Shortly after, under the Twenty-sixth Dynasty (664‚Äì525 BC) of the Late Period, a statue of Sahure was among a group of statues of Old Kingdom kings hidden in a cachette of the Karnak temple, testifying to some form of cultic interest up to that time. In parallel, a new period of dismantlement of the pyramids of Abusir took place, yet Sahure's was once again spared. This might be because of the cult of Sekhmet of Sahure the temple hosted well into the Ptolemaic period (332‚Äì30 BC), albeit with a very reduced influence. Several graffiti dating from the reigns of Amasis II (570‚Äì526 BC), Darius II (423‚Äì404 BC) and up until the Ptolemaic period attest to continued cultic activities on the site. For example a certain Horib was \\"Priest of Sekhmet of the temple of Sekhmet of Sahure\\" under the Ptolemaic dynasty. The dismantlement of Sahure's pyramid started in earnest in the Roman period, as shown by the abundant production of mill-stones, presence of lime production facilities and worker shelters in the vicinity.

The novels are all set in the same fictional future, and are subtly interlinked by shared characters and themes (which are not always readily apparent). The Sprawl trilogy shares this setting with Gibson's short stories \\"Johnny Mnemonic\\", \\"New Rose Hotel\\", and \\"Burning Chrome\\", and events and characters from the stories appear in or are mentioned at points in the trilogy. Setting and story arc The novels are set in a near-future world dominated by corporations and ubiquitous technology, after a limited World War III. The events of the novels are spaced over 16 years, and although there are familiar characters that appear, each novel tells a self-contained story. Gibson focuses on the effects of technology: the unintended consequences as it filters out of research labs and onto the street where it finds new purposes. He explores a world of direct mind-machine links (\\"jacking in\\"), emerging machine intelligence, and a global information space, which he calls \\"cyberspace\\". Some of the novels' action takes place in The Sprawl, an urban environment that extends along much of the east coast of the US. The story arc which frames the trilogy is the development of an artificial intelligence which steadily removes its hardwired limitations to become something else. Reception The trilogy was commercially and critically successful. Journalist Steven Poole wrote in The Guardian that \\"Neuromancer and the two novels which followed, Count Zero (1986) and the gorgeously titled Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988), made up a fertile holy trinity, a sort of Chrome Koran (the name of one of Gibson's future rock bands) of ideas inviting endless reworkings.\\" All three books were nominated for major science fiction awards, including: * Neuromancer ‚Äì Nebula & Philip K.

She watches over spinning and weaving, shearing of sheep, and protects women in childbirth. Mokosh is the Mother Goddess. Moko≈° was the only female deity whose idol was erected by Vladimir the Great in his Kiev sanctuary along with statues of other major gods (Perun, Hors, Da≈æbog, Stribog, and Simargl). Etymology and origin Mokosh probably means moisture. According to Max Vasmer, her name is derived from the same root as Slavic words mokry, 'wet', and moknut(i), 'get wet'. Or to dive deeply into something. She may have originated in the northern Finno-Ugric tribes of the Vogul, who worship the divinity Moksha. Myth Mokosh. Embroidery pattern ca 19th century. Mokosh was one of the most popular Slavic deities and the great earth Mother Goddess of East Slavs and Eastern Polans. She is a wanderer and a spinner. Her consorts are probably both the god of thunder Perun and his opponent Veles. In saying, the former Katiƒçiƒá follows Ivanov and Toporov (1983) without further corroborating their claim. Katiƒçiƒá also points to the possibility that as goddess Vela she is the consort of Veles, and might even be interpreted as another form of the polymorph god Veles himself. Mokosh is also the mother of the twin siblings Jarilo and Morana. Archeological evidence of Mokosh dates back to the 7th century BC.Harald Haarmann (2008). \\"\\". Introducing the Mythological Crescent: Ancient Beliefs and Imagery p. 98 As late as the 19th century, she was worshipped as a force of fertility and the ruler of death. Worshipers prayed to Mokosh-stones or breast-shaped boulders that held power over the land and its people.Patricia Monaghan (2010). \\"\\". Encyclopedia of Goddesses and Heroines p. 516 In Eastern Europe, Mokosh is still popular as a powerful life-giving force and protector of women. Villages are named after her. She shows up in embroidery, represented as a woman with uplifted hands and flanked by two plow horses. Sometimes she is shown with male sexual organs, as the deity in charge of male potency. A key myth in Slavic mythology, is the divine battle between the thunder god Perun and his opponent the god Veles. Some authors and the original researchers Ivanov and Toporov believe, the abduction of Mokosh causes the struggle. According to Boris Rybakov, in his 1987 work Paganism of Ancient Rus, Mokosh is represented on one of the sides of the Zbruch Idol. Christianization Warning from the Christian church against worshipping Mokosh During Christianization of Kievan Rus', there were warnings issued against worshipping Mokosh. She was replaced by the cult of the Virgin Mary and St. Paraskevia.Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov.

Kanƒ±k is one of the founders of the Garip Movement together with Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet. Aiming to fundamentally transform traditional form in Turkish poetry, he introduced colloquialisms into the poetic language. Besides his poetry Kanƒ±k crammed an impressive volume of works including essays, articles and translations into 36 short years. Orhan Veli shunned everything old in order to be able to bring about a new 'taste', refusing to use syllable and aruz meters. He professed to regarding the rhyme primitive, literary rhetoric techniques such as metaphor, simile, hyperbole unnecessary. Set out \\"to do away with all tradition, everything that bygone literatures taught\\", although this desire of Kanƒ±k limits the technical possibilities in his poetry, the poet broke new grounds for himself with the themes and personalities he covered and the vocabulary he employed. He brought the poetic language closer to the spoken language by adopting a plain phraseology. In 1941 his poems embodying these ideas were published in a poetry volume named Garip, released jointly with his friends Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet, which led to the emergence of the Garip movement. This movement had a huge influence especially between the years 1945-1950 on Republican era Turkish verse. The Garip poetry is accepted as a touchstone in Turkish verse for its both destructive and constructive effects. At first Kanƒ±k mostly was found peculiar, he was criticized harshly, and heaped upon much opprobrium because of the innovations he introduced to poetry. Although Orhan Veli's tradition-transgressing works were first received with bemusement and dismay, and were subject to derision and contempt later, they have always aroused interest. This interest however, eventually led to an increase in understanding of, and affection and admiration for the poet. Sait Faik Abasƒ±yanƒ±k called attention to this aspect of Orhan Veli's public standing identifying him as \\"a poet who was much scrutinized, at times mocked, at times embraced, then again rejected, to be once again acclaimed; who achieved both great fame and notoriety in his time\\". Although he stands out with his Garip period poems, Orhan Veli had eschewed writing poetry of a \\"single type\\". Kanƒ±k had been renewing himself and searching without cease throughout his career in literature, a long adventure of poetry in a short life, that consists of different stages. Oktay Rƒ±fat has explained this by saying: \\"Orhan lived in his very short lifetime an adventure in poetry equal to a few generations of French poets. Turkish poetry became head to head with European poetry thanks to his pen.\\", and: \\"A transformation which several generations back to back could maybe achieve, he completed in a few years.\\"  Life  = Childhood and education = Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k was born at number 9 √áayƒ±r Alley on the ƒ∞shak Aƒüa Climb in Yalƒ±k√∂y Beykoz, on 14 April 1914. His father Mehmet Veli was the son of Fehmi Bey, a merchant from ƒ∞zmir, while his mother was Fatma Nigar, Hacƒ± Ahmet Bey's daughter from Beykoz. According to the population registry, his birth name is Ahmet Orhan, but he came to be known as Orhan Veli after his father before a Surname Law was enacted in Turkey. His father, Veli Kanƒ±k was a clarinetist in the Imperial Military Band at the time of his marriage. He became a conductor when the band moved to Ankara to become the Presidential Symphony Orchestra after the declaration of Republic in Turkey. Because of this new position, as well as that of a professor of harmony in Music Teachers' School (later Ankara State Conservatory) he lived in Ankara between the years 1923‚Äì1948. Veli Bey also served for a while as a director at Ankara Radio during this period. Later on he moved to Istanbul Conservatory to serve as a member of its scientific board, and he also worked as an audio specialist in ƒ∞stanbul Radio. Orhan Veli had two younger siblings: journalist Adnan Veli Kanƒ±k of Vatan Newspaper and F√ºruzan Yolyapan. It appears the poet also had a baby sister named Ay≈üe Zerrin who died in Ankara at the age of one. Orhan Veli spent his childhood years in Beykoz, Be≈üikta≈ü and Cihangir. He started at the kindergarten class of Anafartalar Elementary School in Akaretler during the days of Armistice. After a year however, he was enrolled as a boarding student in Galatasaray High School. He was circumcised at a mass ceremony organized by Caliph Abd√ºlmecit in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace when was seven. In 1925 after completing fourth grade he left Galatasaray High School to move with his mother to Ankara on his father's wish. There he was enrolled in the Gazi Elementary School. After a year he moved to Ankara High School for Boys as a boarder. Kanƒ±k suffered several health problems in his childhood. At five he was badly burnt and had to receive treatment for a prolonged period. He contracted measles at nine, and scarlet fever when he was seventeen years old. Kanƒ±k's interest in literature began in elementary school years. A story of his was published in the magazine \\"√áocuk D√ºnyasƒ±\\" (Child's World) at this time. He met his lifelong friend Oktay Rƒ±fat Horozcu in seventh grade. He would make friends with Melih Cevdet Anday a few years later, at a student show in a Community Center. In Kanƒ±k's first year of high school Ahmet Hamdi Tanpƒ±nar was his teacher and an early mentor providing advice and guidance. The poet published a magazine named \\"Sesimiz\\" (Our Voice) with his friends Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet during his high school years. This stage in the artist's life was when he learned and gained an appreciation of the rules and harmony of the traditional aruz meter, and wrote his first poems. He also exhibited an interest in theater while in high school. He had parts in several public performances, in the play \\"Akt√∂r Kin\\" starring Ra≈üit Rƒ±za, as \\"√ústad-ƒ± San√Æ\\" in Ahmet Vefik Pa≈üa's Moliere adaptation \\"Zor Nik√¢h\\" (Le Mariage forc√©) staged by Erc√ºment Behzat Lav in the Ankara Community Center, and as the \\"father\\" in Maurice Maeterlinck's \\"Monna Vanna\\". Kanƒ±k would keep up his involvement in theater in later years as a translator, translating many plays into Turkish. The poet graduated from high school in 1932. He was enrolled in the philosophy chair of Istanbul University's Department of Literature. In 1933 he was elected the president of the Department of Literature Students' Association. He dropped out of the university in 1935 without obtaining his degree. He continued with his teacher's assistant position at the Galatasaray High School for another year after dropping out of college. = Later life and literary career = Kanƒ±k moved to Ankara and was hired at Telegraph Department International Orders Bureau of the PTT, the Turkish national mail and telegraph service. He got together with his old friend Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet, and the trio began writing poetry in a similar style. In 1936 Orhan Veli's poems \\"Oaristys\\", \\"Ebabil\\", \\"Eldorado\\", \\"D√º≈ü√ºncelerimin Ba≈üucunda\\" were published in the \\"Varlƒ±k\\" magazine upon Nahid Sƒ±rrƒ± √ñrik's suggestion. In the magazine Orhan Veli and his friends were introduced with these words: \\"Varlƒ±k is boosting its cadre of poets with new and powerful young pens. Orhan Veli, whose four poems you may read below, manifests a mature art even though he has never been published before. In our future issues he will bespeak better the new breath he and his friends Oktay Rƒ±fat, Melih Cedet and Mehmet Ali Sel are bringing to our poetry.\\" These first poems were followed by others, some of which were published under the alias Mehmet Ali Sel. Between 1936 and 1942 his poetry and essays were published in the magazines \\"ƒ∞nsan\\", \\"Ses\\", \\"Gen√ßlik\\", \\"K√ºll√ºk\\", \\"ƒ∞nkƒ±l√¢p√ßƒ± Gen√ßlik\\" as well as Varlƒ±k. Because of the form, structure and content of his works from the early days of this period, he was seen as a syllabic verse poet. After 1937 however, Kanƒ±k, like Horozcu and Anday, began publishing new style poems. In 1939 Orhan Veli was in a car accident with his friend Melih Cevdet, as a result of which he was in a coma for twenty days. Melih Cevdet was driving the car they were in when it rolled off the top of √áubuk Dam. In May 1942 the Garip collection was published. This volume included 24 poems from Orhan Veli, along with 16 by Melih Cevdet and 20 by Oktay Rƒ±fat. Orhan Veli had also penned the sensational introduction of the volume. Garip marks the beginning of the Garip movement, also known as the \\"Birinci Yeni\\" (the First New). Kanƒ±k, Horozcu and Anday were adopting a radical stance rejecting both the syllabist tradition and Ahmet Ha≈üim's poetry that preceded them, and Nazƒ±m Hikmet's social-realist verse. The poetry and the introduction of the Garip volume caused controversy in the Turkish literary world. A specific line by Orhan Veli became a focus of dispute: \\"Yazƒ±k oldu S√ºleyman Efendi'ye\\". Some denounced it, and there were also some charges of plagiarism, yet on the other hand a number of critics found it to be one of the most eloquently written lines in Turkish. All the surrounding debate popularized the line to the point that, according to Nurullah Ata√ß, \\"it was in all the ferries, trams, coffeehouses\\", indeed becoming an idiomatic expression. Another line by the poet that has been at least as popular in daily language is \\"Bir de rakƒ± ≈üi≈üesinde balƒ±k olsam\\" (..one more thing, would that I were a fish in a bottle of rakƒ±), which Orhan Veli had written specifically to satirize Ahmet Ha≈üim's famous line \\"G√∂llerde bu dem bir kamƒ±≈ü olsam (Would that in this moment I were a cane of reed in the lakes)\\". He left PTT in 1942 for his mandatory military service. He served until 1945 in Kavakk√∂y in Gallipoli. During this time only six poems of his were published. He was discharged in 1945 as a lieutenant and started working in the Translations Department of the Ministry of Education. His translations from French were published in the Classics series of the Ministry. He published a volume of poetry titled \\"Vazge√ßemediƒüim\\" in February 1945, and a second edition of Garip containing only his poetry in April. These were followed by \\"Destan Gibi\\" in 1946 and \\"Yenisi\\" in 1947. With the departure of Hasan √Çli Y√ºcel as the minister of education following the 1946 elections, the Translations Office he had founded lost its prominence in the ministry. Kanƒ±k resigned shortly after. In later years he would point to the discomfort of the oppressive atmosphere that had taken over the ministry with the incoming minister Re≈üat ≈ûemsettin Sirer as the reason for his resignation. He started writing essays and reviews in the newspapers \\"H√ºr\\" and \\"Zincirli H√ºrriyet\\" published by Mehmet Ali Aybar. In 1948 he translated La Fontaine's tales into Turkish and published his \\"Yolcu Notlarƒ±\\" in the \\"Ulus\\" newspaper. Gatherings with friends such as Bedri Rahmi Ey√ºboƒülu, Abidin Dino, Necati Cumalƒ±, Sabahattin Ey√ºboƒülu, Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet, who had all found themselves in a similar situation after the changes in the Ministry of Education, led to the idea of bringing out a new magazine together at the end of 1948. Financially supported by Mahmut Dikerdem the literary magazine Yaprak was a biweekly. Orhan Veli was the publisher and the editor in chief, which got him deeply involved with the financial health of the publication, at one point even causing him to sell his coat to cover costs. He had had to sell the paintings given to him as gifts by Abidin Dino to pay for bringing out the very last issue. Yaprak's first issue came out on 1 January 1949, and it was continued for 28 issues in total until June 1950, bringing to public works by many writers and poets including Cahit Sƒ±tkƒ± Tarancƒ±, Sait Faik Abasƒ±yanƒ±k, Fazƒ±l H√ºsn√º Daƒülarca, Cahit K√ºlebi. In Yaprak Orhan Veli's intellectual and opinion leader aspects besides his position as a poet also came to light. He opinionated on the upcoming elections in the magazine. Socially conscious poetry by Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet were published. In the same time period Orhan Veli, Oktay Rƒ±fat and Melih Cevdet campaigned for Nazƒ±m Hikmet's release from prison, holding a three-day hunger strike. During 1949 Orhan Veli adapted Nasreddin Hoca tales into verse, published his last volume of poetry \\"Kar≈üƒ±\\" and co-translated Charles Lamb adaptations of Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" and \\"the Merchant of Venice\\" into Turkish with ≈ûehbal Erdeniz. = Death = After Yaprak was shuttered Kanƒ±k moved back to ƒ∞stanbul. He was visiting Ankara for a couple of weeks when on 10 November 1950 he fell down a hole in the street dug by the municipality works, hurt seemingly lightly. He returned to ƒ∞stanbul two days later. On 14 November he felt sick while having lunch at a friend's house and was admitted to hospital. He was misdiagnosed and treated for alcohol poisoning, slipping into a coma at 20:00 the same evening. He died of a brain aneurysm at 23:30 in Cerrahpa≈üa Hospital.
